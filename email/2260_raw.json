Very powerfull\nin helping the tests to survive layout changes. Want it or not, HTML Tables\nare the way layout gets done, so you can excpect tens of tables to be added\nto your pages in the &quot;make it super nice&quot; phase. This method enables you to\nesealy find a table marked like this:\n\n&lt;TABLE ID=errorMessages&gt;\n\nso you can easily do assertEquals( 0,\nresponse.getTableWithId(&quot;errorMessages).getRowCount())\n\nand code other fancy methods like\n\ncheckPageReturnedOkWithoutErrorMessages(reponse);\nassertProductNumbersInCart(response,new String [] {&quot;48&quot;,&quot;72&quot;,&quot;32&quot;,45&quot;} );\n\nand so on...\n\nBut I do share your pain. One of the major selling point of the web\ndevelopment is fast feature addition and fast UI design/modification. All\nthat speed makes it hard for extensive web feature testing to follow the\npace. I think the trick is to be as uniform as possible accross the site.\nThis helps testing by sharing handing testing methods for all test cases and\nby modifying only theses methods when an inevitable major change happens. It\nis also good for the user experience to be uniform anyway.\n\nmathieu\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: Alain RAVET\nTo: extremeprogramming@yahoogroups.com ; junit@yahoogroups.com\nSent: Monday, August 06, 2001 4:15 AM\nSubject: [junit] RE: [XP] Need Advice on Unit Testing Pain\n\n\nPaul,\n\nLet me share my &quot;experience&quot; on - bad - web testing pain reaction :\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; -----Message d&#39;origine-----\n&gt;&gt;&gt; De : Paul Hodgetts [mailto:prh@...]\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Recently, developers have stopped writing these web tests,\n&gt;&gt;&gt; resorting to running the tests manually by hand.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; ..

IMHO, they should for\n&gt;&gt;&gt; all the same reasons we automate any tests.\n\n\nA few months ago, I discovered httpUnit.\n\nOh joy. I quickly developped a few test cases :\n   - test_loginSuccess ()\n   - test_loginFailure ()\n   - test_forgotPassword ()\n   - test_clickOnHelpButtong ()\n...\n\n\nEasy, powerfull, and a real help. Couldn&#39;t live without it.\n\n\nBUT,\n  after changing the HTML layout,\n  and adding complexity to the pages,\n  and adding pages to the application,\n  and running out of time,\nI gave up on automated web testing : too much pain, to keep the tests\nup to date.\n\nAND,\nas I had extracted most of the logic, and the DB related functionalities\nout of the servlets, I could build useful tests with straight junit.\n...\n\n\nTHEN\nsomething happened with CVS, and some new code got overwritten by some old\ncode.\n...\n\nBUT,\nI didn&#39;t notice, because it was used in some rare cases, in problems I had\nsolved a\nlong time ago - a few weeks ago -.\n...\n\n\nThe day before the demo to the client, I ran a comprehensive manual\ntest of the whole application : 25 minutes, to try out most of the case.\nThen I noticed something was wrong.\nBut it was too late, because it had happenend a month before I noticed.\n...\n\n\nLAST WEEK\nI started building a simple layer based on httpUnit that goes like this :\n\npublic void test_homePage ()\n  {\n     PageChecker homePage = new PageChecker\n(&quot;http://www.here.com/index.html&quot;) ;\n\n     homePage\n        .titleIs   (Op.EQUALS_IGNORECASE, &quot;welcome&quot;)\n        .nofTables (2)                   // contains 2 tables\n        .nofForm   (Op.MIN, 1)     ;     // contains at least 1 form\n\n     TableChecker table0 =  homePage.getTable(0);\n     table0\n        .nofColumns (2)\n        .nofRows    (2)\n        .hasCellWithText (0,0, Op.START_WITH, &quot;your name&quot;)      ;\n\n     TableChecker innerTable =  table0.getTableInCell (0,1) ;\n\n      ...\n\n     assertAllChecksAreTrue (homePage) ;\n  }\n\nI have this feeling I&#39;m reinventing the wheel, but I was fun to write.\n\nNEXT WEEK, I think I&#39;m goint go write a simple html parsing tool,\nthat writes the java test code for me, so I can cut and paste it\ninto my code, and adapt it.\n\nJust my story.\n\n\nAlain Ravet\nBrussels, Belgium\n\n\n\n\n-----Message d&#39;origine-----\nDe : Paul Hodgetts [mailto:prh@...]\nRecently, developers have stopped writing these web tests,\nresorting to running the tests manually by hand.  Their\nreasoning is that the cost of writing the web tests is not\njustified by their benefits.  Others point out the issues\nwith manual tests (inconsistent tests, the extra time to run\nthem repeatedly, lack of documentation, etc.), and assert\nthat the tests are worth the admittedly high costs.  We&#39;re\nhaving trouble reaching consensus.\n\nIf so, should the tests be automated?
