I was trying to narrow scope to work within the te=\r\nam on the project, though. I assume that the team effectively manages its m=\r\nembers&#39; interaction with the rest of the organization or Customer. The last=\r\n XP team I was on did this well, so that&#39;s the context I live in. In that c=\r\nase, we can pick #1, #2 and perhaps #5 off the list. (Maybe you consider XP=\r\n to be the latest management fad... :)\n\nAlso, on a team using Pair Programm=\r\ning, #4 becomes a positive.\n\nThat leaves #3, which is a big time-waster, in=\r\ndeed. The team needs to learn to resolve issues quickly, including, &quot;Let&#39;s =\r\njust try it both ways and see what&#39;s better.&quot;\n\nIt&#39;s amazing to me the numbe=\r\nr of items on your list that I don&#39;t worry about any more.... when they com=\r\ne up, I simply walk out the front door. That level of organizational dysfun=\r\nction isn&#39;t worth my effort.\n\n&gt;I wasn&#39;t looking for ammo, I just saw the st=\r\natement and was wondering if\n&gt;it was more than &quot;red is the best car color.&quot;=\r\n\n\nWell, it certainly is, since that&#39;s an opinion, whereas my statement is b=\r\nased both on personal experience and anecdotal evidence from people in the =\r\nAgile community. A formal study? No.\n\n&gt;When I asked I had assumed\n&gt;that if =\r\nyou had a link to a roundtable discussion or conference/white\n&gt;paper on the=\r\n subject you would be willing to share.\n\nAlistair Cockburn has done work on=\r\n the time wasted in creating documentation for its own sake. Andy Hunt and =\r\nDave Thomas&#39; &quot;Pragmatic Programmer&quot; talks about it, too, but this last refe=\r\nrence is just more opinion/experience/anecdotes.\n\n&gt;      Sure a study or wh=\r\nite paper is just something that one guy did. But\n&gt;the minute you put it in=\r\nto the public arena like that you are inviting\n&gt;public/peer review and comm=\r\nentary. Thus, it reaches a far larger audience\n&gt;with a wider range of exper=\r\nience than just the gang you tip back with on\n&gt;occasion.\n\nAgreed.\n\n\nJ. B.
