But I have a question which I hope\n&gt; some of you\n&gt; &gt; can help me with - it&#39;s regarding testing private/protected\n&gt; methods and how\n&gt; &gt; to organize my test package.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; First the package. I have read to articles regarding test (&quot;Junit best\n&gt; &gt; practices&quot; from JavaWorld and &quot;Incremental development with Ant\n&gt; and JUnit&quot;\n&gt; &gt; from developerWorks). In the JBT article Andy Schneider advice\n&gt; you to keep\n&gt; &gt; tests in the same location as the source code. And in the Incremental...\n&gt; &gt; article Malcolm Davis advice you to make a separate package.\n&gt; Which approach\n&gt; &gt; is the best to use?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; it is better to make separate package. when we can identify as\n&gt; two separate\n&gt; components like source code and test code it is better to keep them as two\n&gt; different components from configuration management point of view.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I must admit that I like the idea of making a separate package but then\n&gt; &gt; again - how do I then test private and protected methods? And\n&gt; if I keep the\n&gt; &gt; tests in the same location as the source code - who do I then\n&gt; test private\n&gt; &gt; methods?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; we cant test private and protected methods directly.\n&gt; we need to find the public methods, which are using those\n&gt; protected and private\n&gt; methods and test that public methods is enough. Still it is not\n&gt; sufficient.\n&gt;\n&gt; one thing the developer can do is, he can change the private and\n&gt; protected to\n&gt; public and test them. after that he can change back to private\n&gt; and protected\n&gt; respectively. but this is not that much good idea.\n&gt;\n&gt; still we need to find the exact way.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I would very much appreciate if some of you could give me a\n&gt; little example\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Kind regards,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; J.
