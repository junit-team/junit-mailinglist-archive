We don&#39;t seem to have found any performance problems.&nbsp; My only \nadvise here is that if you are using weblogic then it&#39;s best to manually remove \nreferences to beans from the request and response scope after a page has been \ngenerated, or they won&#39;t be garbage collected.&nbsp;

\nThis way you can&nbsp;assert that the Servlet has added the correct beans to the \nrequest so that the JSP can render the correct view.</span></font></div>\n<div><font color=\"#0000ff\" face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"><span\n class=\"ygrps-yiv-484115091720445115-18062001\"></span></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font color=\"#0000ff\" face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"><span\n class=\"ygrps-yiv-484115091720445115-18062001\">Dave</span></font></div>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <blockquote>\n  <div align=\"left\" class=\"ygrps-yiv-484115091OutlookMessageHeader\" dir=\"ltr\"><font face=\"Tahoma\"\n size=\"2\">-----Original Message-----<br><b>From:</b> Mike Duffy \n  [mailto:mike.duffy@...]<br><b>Sent:</b> 18 June 2001 \n  16:46<br><b>To:</b> junit@yahoogroups.com<br><b>Subject:</b> Re: [junit] Re: \n  Has someone done Servlet JUnit tests?<br><br></font></div><tt>Yes, keeping \n  servlets and JSPs as thin as possible is a good approach.<br><br>Is anyone \n  aware of any problems with the implementation of JSP tag libraries on the \n  various application servers?<br><br>Also, is there any significant hit to \n  performance when using tag libraries?<br><br>Mike<br><br><br><br>Paul Hodgetts \n  wrote:<br><br>&gt;

Does anyone have some<br>&gt;&nbsp; &gt; experience?&nbsp; Thanks \n  a lot for the help.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; You can use HTTPUnit to run tests against \n  the servlet.&nbsp; The<br>&gt; problem, however, as you point out, is that you \n  only have<br>&gt; limited visibility into the servlet, since you can only \n  check<br>&gt; the returned HTTP response to the web client.&nbsp; It&#39;s gets \n  even<br>&gt; more fun when you&#39;re trying to test the behavior of \n  session<br>&gt; time outs, security and log in checks, etc.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; \n  What we&#39;ve discussed doing is to make our servlets (and JSPs<br>&gt; via tag \n  libraries) very thin layers that take the incoming<br>&gt; requests and just \n  delegate to our presentation helper classes.<br>&gt; In many cases, we&#39;ll end \n  up just passing the request and<br>&gt; session objects along, but we now have \n  a point where we can<br>&gt; create the request or session objects in \n  particular states<br>&gt; (like expired session), so we can much more easily \n  test the<br>&gt; interface&#39;s behavior, plus we can use JUnit.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; \n  This isn&#39;t a silver bullet or anything, because there are<br>&gt; still cases \n  where you want to test the actual returned HTML,<br>&gt; and sometimes \n  HTTPUnit tests are the best way to do that.<br>&gt; But it seems like it will \n  make our life a bit easier for some<br>&gt; other classes of presentation \n  layer testing.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Anyone else try this?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; -Paul \n  Hodgetts<br>&gt;<br>&gt;
