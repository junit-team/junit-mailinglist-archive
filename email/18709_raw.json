Sorry.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; That said, I&#39;m very curious why you would want to use the test name,\n&gt; &gt; particularly in the manner indicated by your example below.  Could you\n&gt; &gt; expand?\n&gt;\n&gt; Well, it turns out they don&#39;t use it in the actual test case, but in\n&gt; the setUp/tearDown instead. Specifically to insert into/delete from a\n&gt; database with test-specific data, or in another case, to load only a\n&gt; subset of the spring wiring based on the name to improve on testing\n&gt; loadtimes.\n&gt;\n&gt; Anyway...\n&gt;\n&gt; It seems like the RunListeneer would have a reference to the currently\n&gt; running test, simply because of its &quot;testStarted&quot; and &quot;testFinished&quot;\n&gt; functions:\n&gt;\n&gt; /**\n&gt; * Called when an atomic test is about to be started.\n&gt; * @param description the description of the test that is about to be run\n&gt; * (generally a class and method name)\n&gt; */\n&gt; public void testStarted(Description description) throws Exception {\n&gt; }\n&gt;\n&gt; Is it possible to get access to this from within the test class\n&gt; itself?\n\nNo, by design.  Sorry about that.\n\n&gt; If not, it seems like I&#39;d have to write a custom Runner, but\n&gt; I&#39;m having trouble finding information on creating Runners. Are there\n&gt; any known resources for JUnit 4?\n\nInformation on custom runners is currently somewhat lacking.  It\nappears from your later message that you&#39;ve somewhat successfully\nnavigating the waters.  Any interest in writing up a short blog entry\nor article on your experiences?  Thanks,\n\n   David Saff\n\n",
