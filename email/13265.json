My hierachical requirement is<br/>\n&gt;&gt;moved out as hierarchical helpers that are creating test<br/>\n&gt;&gt;objects (similar to ObjectMother pattern suggested by IIja).. how<br/>\n&gt;&gt;does it sound..? <br/>\n&gt;&gt;    <br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Doesn&#39;t sound ideal, but like it&#39;s probably the best you can do if you don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;want to touch the app&#39;s design.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Let us not question the design for testing..<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;        <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;I didn&#39;t mean to be rude here.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;    <br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;No rudeness implied. Still, please notice that not wanting to question the<br/>\n&gt;app&#39;s design when encountering testing problems is unlikely to lead to<br/>\n&gt;optimal results. Problems in test design most often just are a result of<br/>\n&gt;suboptimal app design.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;But I wanted to imply that<br/>\n&gt;&gt;the app design is done this way for various reasons.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;    <br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Certainly. I&#39;d bet, though, that it&#39;s possible to find a design that<br/>\n&gt;conforms to both the needs of testing and those other reasons, and that most<br/>\n&gt;experienced OO developers would say that such a design is better.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;But the<br/>\n&gt;&gt;tests has to be written around the existing app design.  The<br/>\n&gt;&gt;issue in question was the test design not the app design.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;    <br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Then the issue is how to write unit tests for a suboptimally designed app. I<br/>\n&gt;hope you can now understand why Junit doesn&#39;t strive to support that very<br/>\n&gt;well out of the box - most Junit practitioners simply prefer to improve the<br/>\n&gt;app&#39;s design in those cases.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Cheers, Ilja<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Indeed.  Its always tricky adding unit tests to existing code - made <br/>\neven harder when that existing code is sub optimally designed.  It would <br/>\nbe worth Arun getting a copy of Micheal feathers book - &#39;Working <br/>\nEffectively With Legacy Code&#39; .<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the important aspects Micheal has identified when retro fitting <br/>\ntests, is that sometimes the code will have to be made even more <br/>\nsuboptimal to allow testing.  However, once its tested, we can then <br/>\nstart to refactor the design in a safer manner.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/beforeClarity.pdf\">http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/beforeClarity.pdf</a></div>",
