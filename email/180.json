    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-158505952\">Geoff,<br/>\n<br/>\nI have had similar problems to the data dependencies you are describing, and<br/>\nwhat it I found in my experience is that when I have that much dependency<br/>\nneeded to do the Unit Test, then I usually did not provide an adequate<br/>\nabstraction between, my business logic (e.g. OptimizeAirlineResources) and<br/>\nmy persistent data (i.e. airport data, flight data, etc.).  As you pointed<br/>\nout, when that much dependency exists, it became much more of a functional<br/>\nacceptance test instead of a unit test of a single component.  That being<br/>\nsaid, I have ended up having to deal with it, and created a TestSetup<br/>\nsubclass to act as a wrapper around the actual test cases.  The TestSetup<br/>\nclass then implemented a setup( ) method to call all the necessary other<br/>\ncomponents to add test data, and then implemented a tearDown( ) method to<br/>\nclean it up afterword.   But I agree with you, that does end up being more<br/>\nthan a pure Unit Test.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Geoff Bache [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:geoff@...\">geoff@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, December 29, 2000 6:39 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@egroups.com\">junit@egroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [junit] Re: testing distributed components<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@egroups.com\">junit@egroups.com</a>, Kevin Bourrillion &lt;kevinb@m...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Hi,<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; As the name &quot;unit testing&quot; suggests, your best bet is to test each<br/>\nof your<br/>\n&gt; components one by one, in isolation.  But as you say, that can be<br/>\ntricky<br/>\n&gt; when the input to your component needs to come from some other<br/>\ncomponent.<br/>\n&gt; In these cases you may find it worthwhile to invest the time to<br/>\ncreate test<br/>\n&gt; stubs for these objects.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Here&#39;s an elementary example:  Suppose you&#39;re testing the &quot;foo&quot;<br/>\nmethod of<br/>\n&gt; your &quot;Comp&quot; component.  However, this method requires a &quot;Bar&quot; object<br/>\nto be<br/>\n&gt; passed in, and the only way to get one of these is to interact with<br/>\nsome<br/>\n&gt; other component(s)--something of a unit-testing &quot;no-no.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;     public interface Comp {<br/>\n&gt;         public void foo(Bar bar);<br/>\n&gt;     }<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; What you want to do is create another implementation of the Bar<br/>\ninterface<br/>\n&gt; called TestBar, which returns dummy test data instead of doing<br/>\nactual work.<br/>\n&gt; (If Bar is not already an interface, renaming it something like<br/>\nBarImpl and<br/>\n&gt; making Bar an interface!)  Then create an instance of this TestBar<br/>\nobject to<br/>\n&gt; test your foo() method with.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Does this help, or is it too elementary?<br/>\n<br/>\nHi,<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for this, I have a similar problem...<br/>\n<br/>\nMy problem is not so much component dependencies (I guess everyone has<br/>\nthose), but proliferation of data which it&#39;s very hard to create<br/>\ndummy versions of. This is because the data depends on other data,<br/>\nand is typically meaningless without it.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo give a concrete description, we work with airline resource<br/>\noptimization. Suppose I want to test the flight connections module. I<br/>\ncan&#39;t do this without creating some connection data. Connection data<br/>\nis meaningless without flight data. Flight data is meaningless without<br/>\naircraft and airport data. Then you need aircraft type, and<br/>\nlocation descriptions, and so on.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, the nature of optimization is such that, generally, testing<br/>\nanything using 2 airports and one flight is not going to tell you<br/>\nanything meaningful about whether anything works or not. Thus creating<br/>\nmanageable amounts of dummy data is problematic in itself.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, I can use real data, and all the necessary components to<br/>\nload and manipulate it. But then I&#39;m barely unit-testing, am I?<br/>\nIt basically turns into functional testing in any case.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes anyone have any insights/experience of similar problems?<br/>\n<br/>\nGeoff Bache<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit-unsubscribe@egroups.com\">junit-unsubscribe@egroups.com</a> </span></blockquote></div>",
