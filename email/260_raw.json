When you change the public API, please\n&gt; &gt; deprecate the old calls, don&#39;t just delete them.  Please?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I upgraded to Junit 3.3.1, then backed it out again because \n&gt; everything\n&gt; &gt; I have calls now-missing LoadingTestRunners!  I have a whole bunch \n&gt; of\n&gt; &gt; stuff automated, and it all broke. :(\n&gt; \n&gt; We deprecate for one release, then delete all deprecated methods as \n&gt; the first act of the next release. We&#39;ll have to go to some kind of \n&gt; time-out-based deletion when we have more frequent releases.\n\nYes, I think that would be very helpful.  If deprecation is too agressive,\none may as well not bother at all.  I wouldn&#39;t expect deprecated stuff\nto be deleted in a minor update, ie between 3.3 and 3.3.1.  I assume\nsomething in 3.2 would be deprecated in 3.3, and deleted in 3.4.\nOr maybe even later, if the 3.3 release isn&#39;t widely announced or if 3.4\nfollows it too quickly.\n\nSo, if I download 3.3.0 first, it will provide warnings when I run tests\nwith it?  Or will I have to study the docs and track down deprecated usages\nmanually?  \n\n-- \nJoi Ellis                    Software Engineer\nAravox Technologies          joi@..., gyles19@...\n\nNo matter what we think of Linux versus FreeBSD, etc., the one thing I\nreally like about Linux is that it has Microsoft worried.
