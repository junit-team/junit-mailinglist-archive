What is the difference between setUp() and<br/>\n&gt; startTest()?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m far from an expert on the matter but...<br/>\n<br/>\n1. As far as I know TestListeners are merely observers of tests.<br/>\nUsually in <br/>\norder to provide Views on test progress to the tester (of the person<br/>\nclass -&gt; <br/>\nend user subclass) so that they can informed of the results. I may be<br/>\nmistaken <br/>\nhere but testers do not usually mess with TestListeners inside of a<br/>\nTestCase. In <br/>\nother words, they are interface elements. They follow (or are players<br/>\nin) the <br/>\nObserver Pattern as in the GOF book.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ObserverPattern\">http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ObserverPattern</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?DesignPatternsBook\">http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?DesignPatternsBook</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThe TestRunner classes are the observers in the standard jUnit<br/>\nframework. <br/>\nThey indicate their interest of being notified of test<br/>\nprogress/events by <br/>\nregistering themselves with a TestResult. If you take a look at the<br/>\nsource code <br/>\ninside TestRunner classes you can see how this is done.<br/>\n<br/>\nThose who extend or enhance the framework may add the<br/>\nlisteners/observers in <br/>\na different way but the idea is the same.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n2. A tester puts in their code which does whatever is needed to set<br/>\nup a test&#39;s <br/>\nfixture in setUp(). Like opening a file, opening a database, or doing<br/>\nany <br/>\ninitializations which may be common across all tests in a TestCase.<br/>\n<br/>\nstartTest() is just for TestListeners it has nothing to do with a end<br/>\nuser&#39;s <br/>\nwriting of TestCase code. TestListeners are informed that a test has<br/>\nstarted <br/>\nthrough this interface. You can see this in the source code of<br/>\nTestResult.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, don&#39;t take my word for it as I can&#39;t even program in<br/>\nJava.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnthony Adachi</div>",
