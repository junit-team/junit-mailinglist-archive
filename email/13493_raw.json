Mike mentioned he&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; heard of others who want to b=\r\nuild such a results graphing tool, but \n&gt; &gt; didn&#39;t know if anyone&#39;s got one=\r\n they&#39;re sharing.  So I&#39;m posting here, \n&gt; &gt; looking for pointers.\n&gt; \n&gt; Bra=\r\ndley, I&#39;ve been thinking of something similar.\n&gt; \n&gt; I understand that Agita=\r\nr&#39;s tool can do something like this, \n&gt; which may be a starting point if yo=\r\nu&#39;ve got more money than \n&gt; time (I don&#39;t know the price of Agitator, but I=\r\n understand \n&gt; it&#39;s not cheap).\n\nActually, I believe that what Agitar does =\r\nis different from what Bradley is\nasking.  If I understood correctly, Agita=\r\nr monitors test runs, analyzes what\nvalues are passed to your tests and the=\r\nn creates more tests with\ncombinations of these values.\n\nFrom my experience=\r\n, what Bradley is trying to achieve is *very* common and\nI&#39;ve seen many occ=\r\nurrences of companies storing months of test results in\ndatabases, XML file=\r\ns or Excel spreadsheet.  It&#39;s invaluable to get a sense\nof the velocity of =\r\nthe quality of your product.\n\nAs for a practical solution, it seems to me i=\r\nt should be pretty easy to\nwrite this kind of support as a test plug-in tha=\r\nt would monitor the test\nresults and store them in the right place, but I&#39;m=\r\n not aware of any product\nthat does that today.\n\n-- \nC=E9dric\nhttp://beust.=\r\ncom/testng\n \n\n\n\n",
