My Company developes a \n  Web Service that receives XML queries.\n  Some of the queries are very similar.\n  There are lots of &#39;health&#39; objects on the server.\n  And more than 10 commands &quot;getlist&quot; which\n  return XML containing list of these objects.\n  e.g. &quot;glucose_getlist&quot;, &quot;bloodpresure_getlist&quot;,\n  &quot;bloodsugar_getlist&quot; etc. \n  There are also filters for these &quot;getlist&quot; queries\n  - &quot;newerthan&quot;, &quot;last&quot;, &quot;device_manifacture&quot; etc.\n\n  I wanted to simplify testing these commands, so \n  I made one &quot;BasicGetListTest&quot; which receives the \n  name of the object and test for the common \n  functionality - send a common request and receives \n  all available objects with this name on the server . \n  I want to use the result from  this common test in \n  the other methods with the filters to understand if  \n  &quot;getlist&quot; with  filter returns all/less/more objects.\n\n  Now I there is the problem. I want to run &quot;testCommon&quot;\n  first which is in the &quot;BasicGetListTest&quot; but when I \n  subclass it with &quot;GlucoseGetListTest&quot; it is always \n  executed last. I read some of the postings in this \n  newsgroup, but it seems that such kind of requirement \n  point a desing flaw and I should somehow rearrange my \n  Unit Test Structure to made the tests indepentdant. I&#39;m \n  stuck with it. On one hand I want to use inheritance to \n  save code, on the other hand I cannot. \n  I do not want to use TestSuit also, because this way I\n  will have to write like 15-20 different similar TestSuits\n  (one for each action with only a couple of characters \n   different in the java code).\n\n  Do you ,guys, have any fresh ideas how to do this ?\n\n  have a nice day and thanks a lot,\n    Kaloyan\n\n\n\n",
