Rainsberger [mailto:jbrains@...] \nSent: Thursday, A=\r\npril 24, 2003 11:19 AM\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: Re: [junit] The r=\r\night amount of testing !?\n\n\nI think you need to write the end-to-end (Custo=\r\nmer) tests. Ultimately, that&#39;s what demonstrates the presence of features t=\r\no the people paying for the software. In many cases, there will be a Progra=\r\nmmer Test or two that tests your application engine in exactly the same way=\r\n that your Customer Test tests your entire application. If you find this to=\r\n be the case, then consider not writing the application engine test and ins=\r\ntead test the low-level objects. If there is nothing in between -- if your =\r\nAction objects are as low-level as you get -- then live with the duplicatio=\r\nn. Ultimately, you need to test your front end through HTTP.\n\nTake care.\n\n&gt;=\r\nSo said Erik Mattsson on 4/24/2003 --------------------\n&gt;Im finding it hard=\r\n to find the right amount of testing when I create my \n&gt;tests.\n&gt;\n&gt;Example:\n=\r\n&gt;I have a http server that receives http requests. These request is in \n&gt;th=\r\ne server split into different actions. The actions can be &quot;login&quot; or \n&gt;&quot;log=\r\noff&quot; etc.\n&gt;\n&gt;Actions are seperate classes, which has been tested for &quot;most&quot;=\r\n possible \n&gt;errors and possibilities. I have one unit testcase for each act=\r\nion.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Now im sitting and doing some HTTP-Unit testing of the whole http=\r\n \n&gt;server, trying to login, logoff, etc. I start the server and connect to =\r\n\n&gt;it as a real HTTP client, to test the functionality.\n&gt;\n&gt;But somehow I sta=\r\nrted to create similar tests for each action that Ive \n&gt;already tested (tes=\r\nting the same problems that I did on the action \n&gt;level), which means Im si=\r\ntting with ALOT of testcases that looks the \n&gt;same but are invoked from dif=\r\nferent levels. (the action itself is one \n&gt;level, the server is on a higher=\r\n level)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;What is the &quot;right&quot; amount of testing, is it best to do the sa=\r\nme test \n&gt;but on different levels in order to make sure that NO strange beh=\r\naviour \n&gt;is discovered or should I just test the whole flow?\n&gt;\n&gt;More tests =\r\n=3D better software? ;)\n&gt;//Erik\n&gt;------------------------------------------=\r\n---------------------------\n&gt;Erik Mattsson\n&gt;\n&gt;imBridge AB\n&gt;Vasaplatsen 8\n&gt;S=\r\nE-411 34 G=F6teborg\n&gt;\n&gt;Phone: +46-31-138310\n&gt;Mobile: +46-733-174116\n&gt;www.im=\r\nbridge.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Yahoo!
