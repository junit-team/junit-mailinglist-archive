For \n&gt; &#39;public&#39; and &#39;protected&#39; methods, I&#39;ll attempt first to make \n&gt; the method cohesive and give it a signature that&#39;s as \n&gt; expressive as possible .  If the signature still isn&#39;t \n&gt; completely obvious as to the intent of the method, or there&#39;s \n&gt; something particularly interesting about the method behavior, \n&gt; then I&#39;ll add JavaDoc.\n&gt; \n\nI agree - But I try and javadoc all public as its the company coding style..\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 2. Tests do show intention of the method, just the \n&gt; implementation (we&#39;re\n&gt; &gt; back to the &quot;the implementation is not the design argument&quot;).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Rather, they show the intention, and _not_  the implementation.\n&gt; \n&gt; Is that what you meant to say?\n&gt; &gt; \nWhat I meant to say was:\n2. Tests do *not* show intention of the method, just the *current*\nimplementation.\n\nThat is, if the tests document the method, what they are documenting is the\ncurrent implementation of that method, not the intention.\nThen it follows that order to find and fix a bug, you must admit the\n&quot;documentation&quot; is incorrect, not the implementation.\n\nI guess that it depends on how much design you wish to express in the\ndocumentation? If you just want to express the implementation than we are\njust pushing the gap between documentation/implementation back up to the\ndesign/implementation division.\n\nokay .. getting a bit deep here - back to hacking away with vi ;-)\n\ncheers\njoe\n\n\n\n\nThis e-mail and any attachment is for authorised use by the intended recipient(s) only.
