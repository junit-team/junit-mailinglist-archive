There is much hope they will keep<br/>\n     this good habit.<br/>\n     If they do so, it&#39;s just about $200/year to own the very best of<br/>\n     java editor/IDE.<br/>\n     Or $0, if you don&#39;t need/wish to upgrade.<br/>\n<br/>\n   - I&#39;m not an IDEA reference, just a happy customer.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople wondering about this version 3.0 stuff can see what it&#39;s all <br/>\nabout here :<br/>\n    <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.intellij.com/idea/new30.jsp\">http://www.intellij.com/idea/new30.jsp</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAlain</div>",
