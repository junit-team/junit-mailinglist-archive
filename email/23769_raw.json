It may need a bit of tinkering - I&#39;m not very =\r\ngood in maven and ant.\n - Code injection via AspectJ could work well. Place=\r\n a cutpoint on the method looping over the test again and again and measure=\r\n the time before and after.\n\nCheers,\n Georg\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, =\r\n&quot;jfuerth&quot; &lt;jfuerth@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi everyone,\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve created a custom =\r\nRunner meant to help with performance and scalability testing. It lets you =\r\ncreate tests like this:\n&gt; \n&gt; @RunWith(PerfRunner.class)\n&gt; public class Mult=\r\niThreadUsageExampleTest {\n&gt; \n&gt;   @Test\n&gt;   public void demonstrationTest(\n&gt;=\r\n       @Varying(from=3D1, to=3D10) int threadCount,\n&gt;       @Varying(from=\r\n=3D100000, to=3D1000000, step=3D100000) int entryCount) {\n&gt; \n&gt;       // cod=\r\ne here that relies on threadCount and entryCount\n&gt;   }\n&gt; \n&gt; }\n&gt; \n&gt; In the a=\r\nbove example, my runner calls demonstrationTest() 100 times, with parameter=\r\n values (1, 100000), (2, 100000), ... (1, 200000), ... (10, 1000000).\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nWhat I want to do now is produce charts of how long each call took. There a=\r\nre a lot of approaches, but I don&#39;t know which is &quot;right.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. Register=\r\n a TestListener and write my own reports to disk from it (but is there a ge=\r\nneric way to register listeners?)\n&gt; 2. Create my own main program that runs=\r\n the test suite, and have it create the report when the suite is done (mayb=\r\ne this is the only way to register a TestListener anyhow?)\n&gt; 3. Transform t=\r\nhe XML output of the ant junit task (but then it&#39;s bound to Ant)\n&gt; 4. Trans=\r\nform the XML output of the maven-surefure-plugin (but then it&#39;s bound to Ma=\r\nven)\n&gt; 5. Write performance results to disk directly from my TestRunner (sh=\r\nould work in any environment, but feels like a dirty approach)\n&gt; \n&gt; Other i=\r\ndeas are welcome too, of course. My test runner is open source and publishe=\r\nd on GitHub; I want a solution that can work for everyone. So I think ideas=\r\n 3 and 4 are out.\n&gt; \n&gt; Has anyone else thought about getting data from cust=\r\nom test runners into human-readable reports?\n&gt; \n&gt; -Jonathan\n&gt;\n\n\n\n",
