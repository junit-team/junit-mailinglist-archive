That<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;&gt;said, many testers and test suites (including myself and my suites, and<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;&gt;apparently even some of JUnit&#39;s own suites) tend to gravitate toward one<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;&gt;test class per tested class. This is a very common pattern, even if it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;&gt;one JUnit wasn&#39;t meant to support and one that causes test suites to<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;&gt;take longer to run than they otherwise would.<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;&gt;This does make me wonder if maybe JUnit has been cutting the wrong way<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;&gt;all these years. Perhaps it should be designed to organize tests by<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;&gt;model class rather than fixture. This certainly seems a lot more natural<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;&gt;to a lot of developers.<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; When a class has common code in two methods, we usually Extract Method.<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; When a class has sets of methods that operate on two different parts of<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; the class&#39; internal state, we usually split the class in two.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;    This sounds like theological design discussion and this list<br/>\n&gt; probably not the best place for this.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Are you offering to help moderate this list?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; In any case I&#39;d say that you can<br/>\n&gt; do above, but it is not always necessary that you should do that all<br/>\n&gt; the time.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I did write &quot;usually&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;    For instance, if you look at typical facade pattern, it is quite<br/>\n&gt; often that it would change different parts of the internal state but<br/>\n&gt; we still need to test it as a single entity. I am pretty sure that<br/>\n&gt; facade is not only case for this.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I have to admit that I can&#39;t make the connection between this paragraph <br/>\nand the subject of this thread.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy point is pretty straightforward: we have these refactoring rules we <br/>\noften follow and we usually say that we should refactor tests like we <br/>\nrefactor production code, so why wouldn&#39;t we apply these refactoring <br/>\nrules to tests?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  &gt; Why wouldn&#39;t we follow those rules with JUnit test case classes? The<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; first rule extracts common setup code into setUp() and fixture objects.<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; The second splits test case classes that have multiple fixtures into<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; separate test case classes. This leads to test case classes organized<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; around fixtures.<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; As for one test case per model class, that&#39;s a natural place to start,<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; because it&#39;s simple, but once that test case class becomes complex,<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; refactor as usual.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;    That usually would lead to confusion and will require special tools<br/>\n&gt; to track down all the test cases for given class.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I have /never/, /ever/ wanted to track down all the tests for a given <br/>\nclass. I /have/ wanted to track down all the tests for a given /method/, <br/>\nwhich is dirt simple in any decent IDE. (In Eclipse, I hit Ctrl+Shift+G.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  &gt; To say that JUnit supports or doesn&#39;t support this way of organizing<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; tests sounds odd to me. I don&#39;t organize my tests a certain way; I<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; refactor the tests, and that&#39;s where they tend to end up.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;    By the way, I believe that such freely-organized test cases will be<br/>\n&gt; affected a lot when doing massive code refactorings and/or moving<br/>\n&gt; things around classses. So, I&#39;d say it is always a tread off and has<br/>\n&gt; to be considered in a case by case base.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You /believe/ this? or it&#39;s your experience? In my /experience/ it just <br/>\nisn&#39;t that much of an issue.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
