    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1010365641\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt; It&#39;s sometimes okay for methods to receive null arguments.  You would need a<br/>\n&gt; way to differentiate methods that need a non-null parameter (@NonNull) but<br/>\n&gt; even so, the method is probably going to throw an NPE, so where is the added<br/>\n&gt; value?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>In our current architecture - we say that a method should either<br/>\naccept Null, an EmptyString, etc. as a valid input or it should throw<br/>\nan ArgumentException (AE). So in our world view a NPE indicates a<br/>\ncoding error inside the API. I like the distinction an AE says that<br/>\nthe API is not being used correctly whereas a NPE says the API is<br/>\nbroken.<br/>\n<br/>\nRon Jefferies thinks this approach is dead wrong and that methods<br/>\nshould just do the right thing with Null&#39;s etc. I just don&#39;t see what<br/>\nthe right thing is most of these cases.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo my suggestion was pass in Null, emptyString, etc. to methods (not<br/>\nrestricted to tests). If they either threw an AE or didn&#39;t throw<br/>\nanything then they would be deemed to have passed. It would indicate<br/>\nthat the developer had considered what to do with Null&#39;s et al.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe hard part is dealing with methods that have multiple parameters.<br/>\nFor any method that has more than one object as a parameter, you have<br/>\nto be able to create an instance of those objects - so that you&#39;re<br/>\ntests only test one parameter at a time.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Don&#39;t get me wrong, the idea is interesting, I&#39;m just trying to come up with<br/>\n&gt; the example of a bug that would be faster to find using this method...<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You would find cases where the developer hadn&#39;t consider how to handle<br/>\nthese edge cases.<br/>\n<br/>\nMark<br/>\n----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nBlog: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://dotnetjunkies.com/WebLog/mlevison/\">http://dotnetjunkies.com/WebLog/mlevison/</a></div>",
