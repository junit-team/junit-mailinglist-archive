As in, once you reduce the number of tests\n&gt; against a live database to a handful that run in 20 seconds, there&#39;s no\n&gt; need to go any further.\n\nI did that on my last project. That was still more than 75 tests, which\nhad potential interactions with each other. It&#39;s much easier to rollback\ntransactions than, when a test fails, to reload a database and run an\nindividual test against it just to see if it was a real failure or an\ninteraction.\n\n&gt; And I disagree: you /can/ get rid of all the tests against the database\n&gt; for a given application, as long as you move the database integration to\n&gt; a separate project, write it once, and use it throughout the enterprise.\n\nWell, that might work for you, but the freezing of that part of the\nsystem and loss of ability to refactor would kill me. I don&#39;t see a\ndatabase table definition as any different from code to generate an HTML\nform; it&#39;s all part of the application, and it all changes and moves\naround as necessary. This means I not infrequently move code from the\ndatabase to Java or vice versa, just as I would move code from one class\nto another.\n\ncjs\n-- \nCurt Sampson  &lt;cjs@...&gt;   +81 90 7737 2974   http://www.NetBSD.org\n    Don&#39;t you know, in this new Dark Age, we&#39;re all light.  --XTC\n\n",
