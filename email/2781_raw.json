This is much more tricky, but is possible and I&#39;ve\n&gt; &gt; played with the idea some. Most browsers have an (undocumented) mechanism\n&gt; &gt; whereby you can access their virtual machine without actually loading the\n&gt; &gt; browser.\n&gt;\n&gt; If you are using Internet Explorer on windows, you can create a COM\n&gt; interface to an instance and tell it to load a web page. Sort of like\n&gt; remote-controlling explorer. You can put javascript in your HTML page\n&gt; that can call java methods in your applet to run the tests. You can\n&gt; also create a second applet that can call methods in the applet under\n&gt; test because they all live in the same address space.\n&gt;\n&gt; I think you can use a command line option to tell Netscape which page\n&gt; to load. I know this feature is available on unix.\n&gt;\n&gt; This way, it should be very similar to actually running the stuff manually.\n&gt; What I mean is that this will emulate the live environment as much as\n&gt; possible.  However, I am unsure of how to automate the GUI interaction part.\n&gt; There are some tricky threading issues involved. I think JFCUnit addresses\n&gt; these issues for swing -- but unfortunately I am using AWT so I cannot\n&gt; be of much help at the moment.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n-- \nEric Vought\nChief Technical Officer - QLUE Consulting, Inc.\n\nevought@... toll-free: 888-771-3538  RTP area: 919-816-9901\n\n\n",
