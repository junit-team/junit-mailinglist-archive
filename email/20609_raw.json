The line here is very fuzzy\n&gt; between what is an actual unit test and what is an integration test\n&gt; and I am trying to make that much more clearer.\n&gt;\n&gt; I want to have a bunch of test cases which purely test classes in\n&gt; isolation and test that their behaivour is as expected from an API\n&gt; standpoint, but I also want another set of tests which will test the\n&gt; actual functional and integration of things like making sure the\n&gt; integration with Spring and Hibernate is actually working and as I\n&gt; expect.\n&gt;\n&gt; Has anyone done this kind of seperation here before. I am just\n&gt; looking for any methodologies for seperation of these tests in\n&gt; regards to packaging, and running them etc. I run my tests from\n&gt; maven and it would be good to run the two sets of tests seprately\n&gt; from each other.\n&gt;\nI have separate source trees and build output folders for categories  \nof tests. I start with two categories: fast and slow. I put any test  \nthat runs entirely in memory in the &quot;fast&quot; bucket and the rest in the  \n&quot;slow&quot; bucket. I run all the fast tests on each important edit and all  \nthe tests (fast and slow) at least every 15-30 minutes and, of course,  \nbefore committing a change.\n\nOver time, I want to replace tests in the &quot;slow&quot; bucket with tests in  \nthe &quot;fast&quot; bucket and hand the &quot;slow&quot; tests off to whoever does system  \ntesting.\n\nI like to keep it that simple. Some find it necessary to have multiple  \ncategories of &quot;slow&quot; tests, but I strongly doubt anyone who wants  \nmultiple categories of &quot;fast&quot; tests. Fast tests run at least 200 per  \nsecond. A slow test run would be 2000 tests in 10 seconds. If you have  \nthat many fast tests, you probably have too big a project or too much  \nduplication in the tests. Introduce libraries with their own build  \nschedule and refactor your code to get back under 2000 fast tests.\n\nTake care.\n----\nJ. B.
