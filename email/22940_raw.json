It&#39;s meant to be something that \nevery development tool can use.\n\n\n&gt; Is there any chance that the core functionality could be written in a\n&gt; way that other tools could leverage it&#39;s design. It would be great if\n&gt; the project would be broken into a core with modules per IDE. I think\n&gt; this paradigm would benifit the project in the following ways:\n&gt; -- Adoption may slow if every developer were forced into a specific\n&gt; IDE to gain access to this tool.\n&gt; -- Integration with common tools like Ant, Maven, and other CI tools\n&gt; might be harder if too much design is IntelliJ specific.\n&gt; -- I want to use it, but prefer eclipse for no other reason then, &quot;I&#39;m\n&gt; lazy&quot;.\n\nCTR4J will probably be organized into three modules: one with the API \nfor testing frameworks (with a strong backwards compatibility policy), \nanother with code for launching the test runs (for use in build tools \nand IDEs), and a reference UI for showing the test results (for use in \nIDEs or as a stand-alone application).\n\nRegarding the reference UI, there are a couple of options that I&#39;ve \nthought about:\n\nOne option is to provide a UI which could be embedded into the IDEs. \nIntelliJ and NetBeans use Swing, so they could use the same \nimplementation, but Eclipse&#39;s SWT would require some rework. The IDE \narchitectures are quite different, so it might be problematic to provide \ngood integration for every IDE with just one UI implementation. Some \nIDEs might choose to use the reference UI implementation as just a \nreference and make their own UI (hopefully with improvements and without \nbugs).\n\nAnother option is for CTR4J to have an external UI. The test runner will \nanyways run as a separate process (similar to Scala&#39;s compile server, \nfsc) which does things like classloader caching to speed up test runs \n(at least the classes of all libraries can be cached - maybe also module \nor package level caching of unmodified classes in large projects \npossible). It would be possible to have a UI which connects to the test \nrunner server(s) running on the local machine and shows the results of \ncurrent and recent test runs. This option would work also for test runs \nstarted by Ant, Maven etc. It would to some degree work also for IDEs, \nwith the (quite serious) limitations that it would be in a different \nwindow as the IDE and code navigation from test results to source code \nwould not work.\n\nMaybe implementing both options is the best option.\n\nOne more thing: To speed up tool support, I&#39;m planning on creating a \nJUnit adapter so that CTR4J can be launched using the tools&#39; existing \nJUnit integration. This should be possible with a custom JUnit runner \nwhich starts CTR4J which in turn finds the tests and runs them (although \nit might be necessary for the user to manually tell CTR4J that which \ndirectory contains the compiled test classes).\n\n\n&gt; Sound like a great project, a refactoring of the @RunWith would be a\n&gt; nice-ity. If you head the eclipse route, I&#39;d be willing to give it a\n&gt; try and supply feed back.\n\nThanks. I&#39;ll keep this mailing list informed when I have something working.\n\n-- \nEsko Luontola\nwww.orfjackal.net\n\n",
