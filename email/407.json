    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-161461788\">Guess what,<br/>\n<br/>\nI finally figured out the problem on my own.  ActiveTestSuite does<br/>\nnot *have* the behavior I was describing--it&#39;s all in the way I was <br/>\n*using* it!<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s what I was doing (slightly simplified):<br/>\n<br/>\n    TestSuite ts = new TestSuite(Foo.class);<br/>\n    TestSuite ats = new ActiveTestSuite();<br/>\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; numThreads; i++)<br/>\n        ats.addTest(ts);<br/>\n<br/>\nThis had the undesired effect of having multiple threads share the <br/>\nsame TestCase instances.  But all I had to do was change to this:<br/>\n<br/>\n    TestSuite ats = new ActiveTestSuite();<br/>\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; numThreads; i++)<br/>\n        ats.addTest(new TestSuite(Foo.class));<br/>\n<br/>\n(again, simplified)--and it behaves just like I wanted.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf *course*.  Now that I&#39;ve found the answer, it seems so obvious!<br/>\n<br/>\nAttention authors: Can these alternate usage examples be added to the <br/>\nActiveTestSuite javadocs?<br/>\n<br/>\nKevin<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In junit@y..., Kevin Bourrillion &lt;kevinb@m...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t think I understand ActiveTestSuite.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The best I can tell, I should be able to run the same suite<br/>\n&gt; simultaneously in multiple threads by doing this:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;     static Test createThreadedTest(Test test, int numThreads) {<br/>\n&gt;         TestSuite ats = new ActiveTestSuite();<br/>\n&gt;         for (int i = 0; i &lt; numThreads; i++)<br/>\n&gt;             ats.addTest(test);<br/>\n&gt;         return ats;<br/>\n&gt;     }<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; And this does basically that.  But the problem is, all the threads<br/>\n&gt; are acting on the same actual TestCase instances.  Meaning that my<br/>\n&gt; test case &quot;firmament&quot; becomes pretty much useless--an object I<br/>\n&gt; initialize in setUp() might have been mucked with by another thread<br/>\n&gt; by the time I use it!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So, anyone know how ActiveTestSuite was intended to be used?<br/>\n&gt; Documentation is very slight.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks!<br/>\n&gt; Kevin </span></blockquote></div>",
