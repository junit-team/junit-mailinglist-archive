It looks to me that this is something \n&gt; that could wo=\r\nrk in a custom runner--are you interested in seeing if\nthis \n&gt; is so?\n\nMayb=\r\ne. My time is pretty limited in the coming weeks though. One thing\nto think=\r\n about: maybe it&#39;d make sense to have a filteredTrace property\non the resul=\r\nt object (I&#39;m not sure how this actually works, would we\nneed to clone exce=\r\nptions).\n\nWhat use cases are you thinking of for unfiltered stack traces? A=\r\nre\nthese cases so common that a system property to toggle the filtering\nwou=\r\nldn&#39;t meet everyone&#39;s needs?\n\nThe fact that both ant and eclipse (the two m=\r\nain frontends to junit)\nfilter stack traces *by default* seems to be a sign=\r\n that the primary\nuser base wants filtering. However, the filters used toda=\r\ny actually\nlose *real* data because they filter out things like sun&#39;s refle=\r\nction\ntechnology, which might be important for a test case that used reflec=\r\ntion.\n \n&gt; Also, thank you for all of your feedback so far, and please do ke=\r\nep \n&gt; considering ways we can improve the framework.  The sourceforge proje=\r\nct \n&gt; page has a convenient place for any future patches.  Thanks,\n\nOk, tha=\r\nnks. I wasn&#39;t quite sure what the best place was.\n\n-- Ben\n\n\n\n\n",
