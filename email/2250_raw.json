This is especially\ntrue where there is a deep tree of dependencies in the testcases (which is\noften the case). A single bug can cause hundreds of failures; Only one\nfailure is probably significant. We had an in-house test harness at some\npoint that had assertions which would return different result codes on\nfailure. One of them was INCOMPLETE. A test would be INCOMPLETE if\nsomething failed in setting up the test indicating a problem with a\ndependency which is not the direct purpose of the test. Semi-contrived\nexample:\n\nvoid testConnectLogger()\n{\n\tprecondition(d_logger.isOpen());\n\tprecondition(d_logger.queue().isEmpty());\n\n\td_service.connectLogger(d_logger);\n\n\tpostcondition(d_service.getLogger() == d_logger);\n\tpostcondition(d_logger.queue().size() == 1);\n} // testConnectLogger()\n\nIf the preconditions fail, it means that the test couldn&#39;t run, not that\nit &quot;fails&quot; per se. Precondition failure were enough to fail an entire\nrun, but they were tallied separately. If you see:\n\nRUN: 45\nFAILED: 1\nINCOMPLETE: 33\n\n[Test testSomeDependencyOrOther FAILED]\n\n...\n\nIt&#39;s very obvious what the culprit is. Exceptions in setUp()\nmethods should also cause tests in that unit to be INCOMPLETE.\nAnother useful thing is to be able to write code like:\n\nvoid testSpecialCall()\n{\n\tif (!HAVE_SPECIAL_LIB) cancel();\n\n\tpostcondition(specialCall() == 5);\n} // testSpecialCall()\n\nCertain tests may be inappropriate in certain environs. You don&#39;t want\nthese tests to pass, since that&#39;s misleading. You certainly don&#39;t want\nthem to fail though, because determining whether or not a test run was\nsuccessful overall becomes error-prone. It&#39;s nice to have a count of the\ntests that ended up being inappropriate for a particular setup.\n\nOn Fri, 3 Aug 2001, David Avraamides wrote:\n\n&gt; &gt; Agreed; however, I find it nice to go on the\n&gt; &gt; assumption that a failure means\n&gt; &gt; my code is broken and an error means my test is\n&gt; &gt; broken. I wonder if not many\n&gt; &gt; people find this useful or if I&#39;m overstating how\n&gt; &gt; useful it can be.\n&gt;\n&gt; In the past I tried to make this same distinction, but\n&gt; I found in practice that it was often arbitrary.\n&gt; Often, I&#39;ll change code that invalidates existing test\n&gt; cases so they start throwing assertions. The code\n&gt; isn&#39;t broken, the problem is that the test cases are\n&gt; out of sync with the code since the assumptions have\n&gt; changed. To me, it doesn&#39;t really matter what&#39;s broken\n&gt; (testing code or tested code) or how I&#39;m notified of\n&gt; the problem (assertion or error). The point is that I\n&gt; need to investigate the problem and fix it.\n&gt;\n&gt; For me, the path of least resistance is the most\n&gt; effective: make my test cases simple to write and\n&gt; simple to understand. Thus, I prefer letting JUnit\n&gt; handle uncaught exceptions as errors since this:\n&gt;\n&gt;   public void testFoo() throws Exception {\n&gt;     code;\n&gt;   }\n&gt;\n&gt; is simpler than:\n&gt;\n&gt;   public void testFoo() {\n&gt;     try {\n&gt;       code;\n&gt;     catch (ErrorException e) {\n&gt;       fail(...);\n&gt;     }\n&gt;   }\n&gt;\n&gt; Both versions say the same thing to me: I expect\n&gt; &quot;code&quot; to work, and if it doesn&#39;t something is wrong.\n&gt; I just find the latter case less clear.\n&gt;\n&gt; My two cents...\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; Make international calls for as low as $.04/minute with Yahoo!
