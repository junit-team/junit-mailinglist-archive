It is the <br/>\ncombination of inheritance + &quot;test&quot; that provides the method <br/>\ninvocation solution.  The approach stands in (stylistic) contrast to <br/>\nthe two popular declarative solutions - using a descriptor document <br/>\nor an annotation (in this case to cause method invocation).  <br/>\n<br/>\nIn other words, I don&#39;t want to &quot;throw out&quot; an OOP inheritance <br/>\nsolution just because it also includes notating a method with &quot;test&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 2)  What I&#39;m not prepared to accept, is an assertion that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; declarative programming is &quot;better&quot; (when there are two workable<br/>\n&gt; &gt; choices) by virtue of its existence.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It is better in this case, because munging your method names so <br/>\n </span></blockquote>that a tool<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; can pick them off is clearly better addressed with annotations.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>MDT ---&gt; Cedric - I do (respectfully) disagree with you on this <br/>\npoint.  The term &quot;optimization for code completion&quot; attempts to <br/>\ncapture the notion that naming of Classes and Methods can be done in <br/>\na manner that provides more (immediate) clarity within an IDE  <br/>\ncontext.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn an earlier post - you referred to it as adding &quot;adding metadata <br/>\nto that method&quot; name.  In addition to code completion, having all <br/>\nlike method names begin with a prescribed verb is useful for sorting <br/>\nmethods.  For instance, in Eclipse when one types &#39;Ctrl-o&#39; followed <br/>\nby &#39;test&#39; - you very quickly list the test methods in a class vs. <br/>\nsupporting (perhaps private?) methods.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have not seen alot said about &quot;optimization for code completion&quot; - <br/>\nas an example the following link documents a specific API <br/>\npromoting &quot;exists&quot;, &quot;read&quot;, &quot;register&quot; for transparent persistence <br/>\nrelated operations.<br/>\n<br/>\n     <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://gtcgroup.com/joppa/The.Road.to.Joppa.html#JoppaCRUD\">http://gtcgroup.com/joppa/The.Road.to.Joppa.html#JoppaCRUD</a><br/>\n<br/>\nAn advanced verification technique is to reflectively interrogate <br/>\nmethod names on functional classes (during unit testing) to ensure <br/>\nthey conform to either platform, corporate or application method <br/>\nnaming conventions.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe strength of your conviction in this area is causing me to <br/>\nwonder.  Am I the only Java &quot;guy&quot; that finds benefit (on a fifteen <br/>\ndeveloper project on two continents) in having a test method begin <br/>\nwith he word &quot;test&quot; - or, a callback method begin with &quot;pre&quot; <br/>\nor &quot;post&quot; - or, a transparent persistence registration begin <br/>\nwith &quot;register&quot;???<br/>\n<br/>\nOr said more simply - I find value in having test methods begin <br/>\nwith &quot;test&quot; even if not required by the invocation mechanism.  And <br/>\nif there is a (platform or corporate or application) naming <br/>\nconvention I like it enforced in a testing context.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  In the case of @Ignore - no<br/>\n&gt; &gt; question about it (in my mind) - that is a problem begging for a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; declarative solution.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Following your logic, shouldn&#39;t you rename testFoo() to ignoreFoo<br/>\n </span></blockquote>() then?<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sure.  Except for the fact that &quot;test&quot; is a long-term perscription <br/>\nand &quot;ignore&quot; is (presumably) transitory.  The nuances around which <br/>\ncapability is appropriatly declared and which capability is <br/>\nappropriately inherited are more subtle than a verb study.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn this case, &quot;ignore&quot; is a contextual assignment.  It might <br/>\nmean, &quot;ignore until I get this test method working&quot;.  Whereas &quot;test&quot; <br/>\nmeans &quot;always test&quot; unless declared otherwise.  &quot;Ignore&quot; is <br/>\n(conceptual) override of &quot;test&quot;.  They are not peers - so, a <br/>\ndifferent stylistic implementation might be warranted.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; See where this leads?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -- <br/>\n&gt; Cédric<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://testng.org\">http://testng.org</a> </span></blockquote></div>",
