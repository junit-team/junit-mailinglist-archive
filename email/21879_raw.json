But, I suppose what I could do, is create some code that does a DB insert/update, that simulates what the nightly job does, without actually doing all the work. In other words, take some data that I&#39;m expecting, and put it in the DB, rather than actually &quot;generate&quot; the data. That way, I don&#39;t need the nightly job to be part of the testing cycle. \n\nThen, all the tests could run independently, and not rely on each other, but I could also run them in order manually, to verify that the system actually works as a whole. Then, I could actually have an &quot;OrderedTest&quot; that instantiates all my TestCase classes, and calls them in order. That in itself would then be it&#39;s own separate test. \n\nDoes that sound like a good idea? \n\nAnyhow, I respond to your comments below. \n\n----- &quot;Lothar Kimmeringer&quot; &lt;maillists_job@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; From: &quot;Lothar Kimmeringer&quot; &lt;maillists_job@...&gt; \n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; Sent: Monday, August 17, 2009 1:27:27 AM GMT -07:00 US/Canada Mountain \n&gt; Subject: Re: [junit] Dependency Testing \n&gt; \n\n\n\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; The reason I ask is because this is what is basically happening: There \n&gt; &gt; is an external ASYNCHRONOUS SOAP messaging system that is the core to \n&gt; &gt; all communication between several companies. Requests/responses can be \n&gt; &gt; sent to and from all of the participating parties. For testing purposes, \n&gt; &gt; so that my tests can be a little more controlled, I send requests and \n&gt; &gt; responses to and from my own server. i.e. I do not send to other \n&gt; &gt; companies, because I cannot guarantee they will respond within the time \n&gt; &gt; I need (seconds), even though technically, their test systems are \n&gt; &gt; supposed to be up and running. \n&gt; \n&gt; If you abstracted the layer between your applicaiton and the messaging \n&gt; system you can simply define a mock that answers the requests for you. \n&gt; That way you don&#39;t need to setup anything in advance. I&#39;m doing this \n&gt; here e.g. for testing the parts of our software doing OFTP by ISDN. \n\n\n\n\nYes, that would be possible, but also a whole heck of a lot of extra work. It would probably double the code, perhaps even more. I was trying to keep my part of the application simple. :D \n\n\n\n\nAlso, by doing this, I am still circumventing the testing that actually tests to see if the system actually works. And, I don&#39;t want to do that, as I want to be sure the system actually works, and not just my code. I could do these little abstractions (with a factory, that has test and production configurations), and that would test my code, but it would not test that my code works with the other system, as I would end up having a &quot;fake&quot; layer, pretending to be their system, but never actually verifying. \n\n\n\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1. submit request to my system, through the external system. This is \n&gt; &gt; effectively to test receiving requests from the external system, to me. \n&gt; &gt; i.e. I can send requests to myself, as if they were coming from someone \n&gt; &gt; else&#39;s system. \n&gt; &gt; 2. receive request from external system \n&gt; &gt; 3. queue job for nightly build of data \n&gt; &gt; 4. check for available data from nightly job, the next day \n&gt; &gt; 5. send available data \n&gt; &gt; 6. receive the data sent in #5, and email it out to a staff member \n&gt; \n&gt; For this I see Ant or Maven a better fitting tool than JUnit. There \n&gt; you have dependencies and all the things you need for data-transfer, \n&gt; emailing, etc. \n\n\n\n\nI am using Maven, but maven isn&#39;t a testing tool. However, it does support JUnit. \n\n\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; So write an Ant script that is preparing everything as needed and \n&gt; start e.g. the JUnit-tests that do the testing. With the optional \n&gt; tasks junit and junitreport you even end up with a nice HTML-page \n&gt; similar to a Java-API documentation showing you what tests failed \n&gt; and what succeeded. Combined e.g. with Cobertura you can see what \n&gt; parts of your application aren&#39;t under test. \n&gt; \n&gt; Regards, Lothar \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n\n__ \n    This communication is intended for the use of the recipient to whom it\n    is addressed, and may contain confidential, personal, and or privileged\n    information.
