Should it?\n\n\n&gt; The only problem is that a single form could have its behavior driven by\n&gt; some data lying inside the depth of the application itself.\n\n\nYes, in nearly every application, when something happens deep within the\napplication, the gui is used to communicate with the user.\n\n\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; The main fact stil remains: do you all have successfully used JUnit in order\n&gt; to make GUI testing?\n\nWe come full circle to the first question I asked this morning - what do you\nwant to test? GUI is too big - what specifically about the GUI do you want\nto test? You CAN test everything except aesthetics. I try very hard to move\nany logic out of the gui (and you really do have to work at it) and\nsomeplace where I can test it, and rely on visual inspection to test the\ngui. \n\n\n\n-- \nRobert Koss, Ph.D.     | Training, Mentoring, Contract Development\nSenior Consultant      | Object Oriented Design, C++, Java\nwww.objectmentor.com   | Extreme Programming\n\n\n\n",
