In this case, however, there is a wealth of test <br/>\n&gt; files (the<br/>\n&gt; backup PDBs from my Visor) which I can use to validate the <br/>\n&gt; object model.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The problem I see with that is: read/compare but compare to what ?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; But the idea is still the same - read/write/compare or <br/>\n&gt; write/read/compare.<br/>\n&gt; Are these the only tests you do for this kind of behavior?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Basicaly, yes.<br/>\nThe idea being that my model has classes that encapsulate translation to and<br/>\nfrom XML (chain-of-responsibility with specific handlers for different type<br/>\nof objects). I don&#39;t want to make my tests dependent on the actual XML<br/>\nformat (or any other format) being used. Which makes me free to change the<br/>\nformat at any time, and still have valid tests.<br/>\nI do this both at the translation level and a higher level where actual<br/>\nserialization takes place.<br/>\nAt the translation level handlers have:<br/>\n\tpublic org.w3c.dom.Document write(Object object)<br/>\n\tpublic Object read(org.w3c.dom.Document)<br/>\nin the test:<br/>\n\tMyObject object = new MyObjectImpl();<br/>\n\tdocument = handler.write(object);<br/>\n\tassertNotNull(document);<br/>\n\tMyObject objectReadBack = (MyObject)handler.read(document);<br/>\n\t...<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only thing to verify is that the tests cover the entire state of the<br/>\noriginal instance and the instance read back.<br/>\nIt is possible to make a helper class that uses reflection to discover all<br/>\ngetXxx(...), isYyy(...), hasZzz(...) and compare two instances (maybe<br/>\nsomebody has done that already ?). Then use that in the tests to assert<br/>\nequality.</div>",
