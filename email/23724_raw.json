My understanding of our existing test infrastructure was not suff=\r\nicient enough and in my initial post I&#39;ve provided a somewhat inaccurate de=\r\nscription of the problem I&#39;m trying to address.\n&gt;\n&gt; The AbstractNutchTest i=\r\ns in full use and does an excellent job of extending TestCase to provide a =\r\nplatform for many other tests to build from. The test case I have identifie=\r\nd as being pretty hectic is TestGoraStorage [1]. The initial thing I found =\r\npuzzling about this test case is that, if run as a java application without=\r\n any arguments, it passes a usage message &quot;Usage: TestGoraStore &lt;id&gt; &lt;start=\r\nKey&gt; &lt;numRecords&gt;&quot;. I&#39;ve never experienced anything like this is any previo=\r\nus JUnit test cases, can anyone explain this to me please?\n&gt;\n&gt; The errors I=\r\n&#39;m getting when I run the test class can be seen here [2].\n&gt;\n&gt; I understand=\r\n that the errors might not be JUnit specific, however if I was able to get =\r\na bit of guidance as to the nature of the test etc then it would be more th=\r\nan helpful.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thank you\n&gt;\n&gt; Lewis\n&gt;\n&gt; [1] https://svn.apache.org/repos/as=\r\nf/nutch/branches/nutchgora/src/test/org/apache/nutch/storage/TestGoraStorag=\r\ne.java\n&gt; [2] https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NUTCH-1135\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In ju=\r\nnit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;lewismc2&quot; &lt;lewis.mcgibbney@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Hi list,=\r\n\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I&#39;m attempting to overhaul our test source as per this Jira issue [1=\r\n] and sub-issues. When looking at one existing test class [2] I see that in=\r\nstead of extending TestCase the case extends AbstractNutchTest. Apart from =\r\nmy initial thoughts that this was a previously used testing mechanism, I am=\r\n pretty convinced that this has now been deprecated in favour of JUnit 4.5 =\r\ntest cases. This can also be seen in [3], which you will notice is also fai=\r\nling as documented in [1].\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Further to this, I notice that there are a=\r\n number of parameters that cannot be resolved e.g. in the case of TestInjec=\r\ntor, testDir as shown below. This is consistent across &#39;all&#39; four of the te=\r\nst cases I am trying to fix. I wonder if anyone can point me in the right d=\r\nirection to getting the configuration correct and getting these test cases =\r\nworking again.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; {code}\n&gt;&gt; lewis@lewis-01:~/ASF/nutchgora/runtime/local=\r\n$ bin/nutch junit org.apache.nutch.crawl.TestInjector\n&gt;&gt; .E\n&gt;&gt; Time: 0.003\n=\r\n&gt;&gt; There was 1 error:\n&gt;&gt; 1) testInject(org.apache.nutch.crawl.TestInjector)=\r\njava.lang.Error: Unresolved compilation problem:\n&gt;&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0 testdir can=\r\nnot be resolved\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0 at org.apache.nutch.crawl.TestInjector.se=\r\ntUp(TestInjector.java:57)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; FAILURES!!!\n&gt;&gt; Tests run: 1, =A0Failures: 0=\r\n, =A0Errors: 1\n&gt;&gt; {code}\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; [1] https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NU=\r\nTCH-1081\n&gt;&gt; [2] https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/nutch/branches/nutchbase/s=\r\nrc/test/org/apache/nutch/crawl/TestInjector.java\n&gt;&gt; [3] https://svn.apache.=\r\norg/repos/asf/nutch/branches/nutchbase/src/test/org/apache/nutch/crawl/Test=\r\nGenerator.java\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!=\r\n Groups Links\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n",
