Myself, I like<br/>\nto gather tests into Java-level suite classes, because these can be<br/>\nreused in ant, Eclipse, maven, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne advantage of ant is that you can fail fast, deciding that if suite<br/>\nA fails, don&#39;t even bother running suite B.  Also, sometimes the build<br/>\nsystem or political structure of a team can make it easier to edit XML<br/>\nfiles than Java, in which case the ant file might make sense.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck,<br/>\n<br/>\n   David<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Tue, Apr 28, 2009 at 6:03 AM, esordini &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:emmanuele.sordini@...\">emmanuele.sordini@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Dear all,<br/>\n&gt; I find myself faced with the following issue. I&#39;ve been assigned to<br/>\n&gt; a new project where I have a group of Junit test classes (around<br/>\n&gt; 150). My aim is to setup a fully automated test environment<br/>\n&gt; starting on the current project status. I was thinking of using<br/>\n&gt; Ant as the the first step, and then moving to some continuous<br/>\n&gt; integration tool further down the line.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I see two main outstanding problems:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 1) My test hierarchy is made up of a heterogeneous set of classes,<br/>\n&gt; some of which are purely stand-alone classes (i.e. I have to<br/>\n&gt; manually launch them), while some others are grouped into<br/>\n&gt; test suites.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 2) Test case complexity is very wide, ranging from very simple<br/>\n&gt; (and fast) ones to more complicated ones than can take hours to<br/>\n&gt; complete.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So I was wondering what is the best tradeoff between prioritizing<br/>\n&gt; tests at code level (i.e. with Test Suites) vs. at script level<br/>\n&gt; (i.e. by specifying the desired order in an Ant batchtest task).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Any help on this issue will be greatly appreciated.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Best regards<br/>\n&gt; Emmanuele Sordini<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
