You don&#39;t want to add new feature unless it will be useful<br/>\nto everybody. You don&#39;t want to overload the core.<br/>\n  <br/>\n&gt; The next steps I would suggest for you are:<br/>\n&gt;     1) Do something to accelerate the 4.5 release, like fill in missing<br/>\n&gt; javadoc.<br/>\n&gt;     2) Add automated tests to your feature requests.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow can I add automated tests or add javadoc if I don&#39;t have write<br/>\nrights to CVS? It will be pleasure for me to help you. I just want to<br/>\nknow how can I technically do it.<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n&gt; Beginning to contribute to an existing project is a little like going to<br/>\n&gt; someone else&#39;s home. If you are demanding, if you rearrange all the<br/>\n&gt; furniture, if, in short, you act like you are the most important<br/>\nperson in<br/>\n&gt; the room, then you are unlikely to be welcome. If you listen<br/>\ncarefully and<br/>\n&gt; offer to help, you have a chance of building a relationship that<br/>\nwill help<br/>\n&gt; you feel at home and prepare the way for a closer relationship.<br/>\n<br/>\nI understand your point. You see, I don&#39;t want to change your design,<br/>\nrewrite your code or to add significant amount of new features. I want<br/>\nonly to add enhancements / improvements to existing one. In other<br/>\nwords, I don&#39;t want to rearrange the furniture I want to add some<br/>\ndecorative elements to your room. </span></blockquote></div>",
