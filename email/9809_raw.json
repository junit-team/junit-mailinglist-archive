Note\nthat the fixture is not just the objects, but their state as well. \nYou may have instance of the same classes, but with different state\n(e.g. empty list, one element, two elements...). They are different\nfixtures and should be in different TestCase subclasses.\n\nThis is a bit of a quibble IMHO.  My point is that you don;t mix\nfixtures in a single TestCase subclass.... the idea of building\nTestCase subclasses around distinct fixtures.\n\nDave\n\n\n\n",
