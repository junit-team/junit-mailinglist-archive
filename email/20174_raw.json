That is just what I am trying now.\n\nThis is what I am doing:\n\n//Actual data from assignment table\nIDataSet databaseDataSet =   connection.createDataSet(); //\nconnection.createDataSet();\nITable actualTable = databaseDataSet.getTable(&quot;ASSIGNMENT_TABLE1&quot;);\n\n// Load expected data from an XML dataset\nIDataSet expectedDataSet = new FlatXmlDataSet(new\nFile(&quot;c:&#92;&#92;referencedata&#92;&#92;assignmenttable1.xml&quot;));\nITable expectedTable =\nexpectedDataSet.getTable(&quot;dbo.ASSIGNMENT_TABLE1&quot;);\n\n//Assert\nAssertion.assertEquals(expectedTable, actualTable);\n\nMany thanks!\n\nMike\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;edu_kumar&quot; &lt;sarat.beesa@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ve come across a JUNIT extension called &#39;DBUnit&#39; which can help us\n&gt; unit test database related activities. You can check that out for this\n&gt; purpose i guess.\n&gt;\n&gt; It has features to load the test data in the form of Excel sheet and\n&gt; also contains features to compare the results against actual DB data.\n&gt;\n&gt; http://dbunit.sourceforge.net/\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Sarat.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Mike Foley&quot; mike_foley_01612@ wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi Lasse,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks for your response. Yes, you are right. I suppose that is\n&gt; &gt; it...I want to verify the rows in the spreadsheet against the rows\nin\n&gt; &gt; that table....and report on any inconsistencies. That would do it.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Testing the application...written in Java/J2EE, exposed as Axis web\n&gt; &gt; services...I am comfortable writing JUnit or Cactus tests in that\n&gt; &gt; context. I guess the new challenge ... for me ... is the Excel\n&gt; &gt; spreadsheet. How do I get at it from Java APIs? I will do some\n&gt; &gt; online research and googling into that....or listen to any ideas\nfrom\n&gt; &gt; this group on how to go about that.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; And then the JDBC calls to the table...I think I can figure that\nout.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; This whole thing...spreadsheet rows comparison to database\ntable....I\n&gt; &gt; think I can re-use this pattern in several places. I will keep the\n&gt; &gt; group updated as I make progress if there is interest.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks for your help,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Mike\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Lasse Koskela&quot; &lt;lasse.koskela@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Mike,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; On Dec 12, 2007 10:47 PM, Mike Foley &lt;mike_foley_01612@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I guess my problem statement is this: the business analysts have\n&gt; &gt; an\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Excel spreadsheet with hundreds of rows...each row defines some\n&gt; &gt; unique\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; requirement on the way this particular thing is supposed to\n&gt; &gt; work.
