I would prefer that you know what you&#39;re writing about =\r\nbefore you draw such a strong conclusion.\n\n&gt;But it seems to me that I don&#39;t=\r\n need necessarily JUnit test cases or \n&gt;suites if I use the new assert stat=\r\nement in the code I write.\n\nTrue.\n\n&gt;Of course it is better to have JUnit te=\r\nsts, but it has many side \n&gt;effects in my eyes. Using assert statements wou=\r\nld be a compromise.\n\nWriting Programmer Tests (forget JUnit for now) has ma=\r\nny positive side effects, true. No need to compromise.\n\n&gt;I think I could us=\r\ne assert statements at the beginning of a method \n&gt;and at the end, checking=\r\n preconditions and postconditions.\n\nCertainly you may.\n\n&gt;By marking them so=\r\nmehow as preconditions and postconditions it should \n&gt;theoretically be poss=\r\nible to automate generation of JUnit \n&gt;tests/suites, including test data. T=\r\nhe test data can be created \n&gt;automatically by a tool which obeys the preco=\r\nnditions for that \n&gt;purpose.\n\nJTest does this. Most Test-Driven programmers=\r\n I have spoken with do not find it valuable, including me. There must be a =\r\nreason we agree that generating this kinds of boundary tests are not valuab=\r\nle compared to the kinds of tests we prefer to write.\n\n(Hint: writing tests=\r\n is a design activity.)\n\n&gt;It seems that with JUnit I can only test methods =\r\nwhich return a \n&gt;value.\n\nSo utterly false I can&#39;t overstate the fact.\n\n&gt;Usi=\r\nng JUnit will change the code one would normally create: \n&gt;Because of JUnit=\r\n you need to overwrite equals(), toString() and are \n&gt;not allowed to use vo=\r\nid return type if you want to test that method.\n\nEven more false than the p=\r\nrevious statement.\n\n&gt;Using the assert statement instead I can also test cla=\r\nsses which \n&gt;return no value.\n\nWe do this with JUnit every day.\n\n&gt;Besides a=\r\nll this problems whis JUnit is another one: Successful \n&gt;JUnits tests are n=\r\no guarantee that there are no bugs in the code I \n&gt;read. This has to do wit=\r\nh data chains. But I didn&#39;t understand this.\n\nYou are now being ridiculous.=\r\n No testing ever proves anything; therefore we should all go home and drink=\r\n tea. This absurd argument is the last vestige of the desperate.\n\nAt this p=\r\noint I must ask you to go away, read several books on testing, then come ba=\r\nck and stop talking nonsense.\n\nThanks.\n\n\nJ.
