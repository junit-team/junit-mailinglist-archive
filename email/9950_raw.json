For\nexample:\n\npublic class TestSomeObectEquals extends TestCase\n{\n    private SomeObject m_a = null;\n    private SomeObject m_b = null;\n\n    public void setUp()\n    {\n        m_a = new SomeObject(&quot;abc&quot;);\n        m_b = new someObject(&quot;abc&quot;);\n    }\n\n    public void testSymmetryAB()\n    {\n        assertTrue(&quot;Symmetry test a == b failed.&quot;, m_a.equals(m_b));\n    }\n\n    public void testSymmetryBA()\n    {\n        assertTrue(&quot;Symmetry test b == a failed.&quot;, m_b.equals(m_a));\n    }\n}\n\nI think better names could be used but you get the idea....  As long as\nyour tests stay focused and are easy to understand I don&#39;t think it\nreally matters how many assertions the test contains.  For example:\n    public void testSymmetry()\n    {\n        assertTrue(&quot;Symmetry test a == b failed.&quot;, m_a.equals(m_b));\n        assertTrue(&quot;Symmetry test b == a failed.&quot;, m_b.equals(m_a));    \n    }\nIs just as easy to read as when each assertion was in its own method in\nmy opinion.\n\n\n&gt; Also, what about edge-conditions? \n\nEach edge condition could be in its own test method.  \n\nKris\n\n\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\njunit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n \n\nYour use of Yahoo!
