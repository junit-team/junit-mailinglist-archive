Before, I was using my own static inner classes (and framework)<br/>\nfor unit testing my Java-code and recently switched over to JUnit,<br/>\nmainly because I want to test server side objects using Cactus.<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel that using inner classes for testing has more advantages than<br/>\nusing<br/>\nseperate classes. With inner classes you can do &quot;white box&quot; testing (you<br/>\ncan<br/>\naccess private methods and fields), tests are always right beside your<br/>\ncode<br/>\nand you are somewhat obliged to keep your tests synchronized with your<br/>\ncode<br/>\n(or at least keep them compilable). And it is no problem to separate<br/>\nyour<br/>\ntests from your code after compiling, since inner classes are packed in<br/>\nseparate class-files.<br/>\n<br/>\nMY QUESTION now is: What are the consequences of using inner classes<br/>\ntogether with JUnit ??? Is it always possible, are there any<br/>\nunforseen problems or drawbacks, ... ?? Does someone has any experience<br/>\nwith<br/>\nthis ?<br/>\n<br/>\nAny comment, tips, samples ... would be really appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\nJef Cumps<br/>\nEGOVA NV<br/>\nBelgium</div>",
