Has anyone else encountered this problem and got <br/>\nto a workable solution or workaround? We have modified the JUnit <br/>\nsource to get this working, but:<br/>\n <br/>\n - is there a particular reason why it isn&#39;t (there seems<br/>\n   to be explicit comments in the code saying it doesn&#39;t work)<br/>\n - any plans to get it working?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\nPeter Mularien<br/>\nDeploy Solutions, Inc.</div>",
