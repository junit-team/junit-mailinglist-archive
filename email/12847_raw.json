I&#39;ll give an explanation and try to keep it brief:\n \nIn general, I try to stay away from using private variables unless there\nis a good reason to.  I don&#39;t like to take functionality away from\nsubclasses or other members of the package that would be useful to them.\nWhen I do make things private, I can usually look at whatever effect it\ncaused, or there is an accessor to help me see that the method did what\nit needed to, or caused the side effect that I would expect, in which\ncase I often consider the appropriate method to be tested.\n \nIf it is really necessary to make something private as opposed to\nprotected or package protected, and there is no way to see what effect\nit has that is not also private, then I (or whoever wrote the code I am\nworking with) have hopefully done so because there is an important\nreason why all that is private.  If that is the case, the last thing I\nwant to do to is throw in a more public accessor.  Even if the intent is\njust to use it for testing, the fact is it is available for other\nclasses that might use it.  If the point is to keep other classes from\naccessing something, then adding an accessor with a comment saying\n&quot;don&#39;t use this method, it&#39;s only for testing&quot; is dangerous.  If, on the\nother hand, there is no reason why other classes should be restricted\nfrom accessing something, then the decision to have it private needs to\nbe examined.\n \nI view it more as adding a few extra lines of code to my tests than\n&quot;jumping through hoops,&quot; but yes I would rather spend the extra time on\nmy tests in order to keep my production code clean.\n \nMatt\n \n \n \n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: J. B. Rainsberger [mailto:jbrains@...] \nSent: Thursday, February 10, 2005 1:23 PM\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: Re: [junit] Testing certain types of methods\n\n\n\n\tMetlis, Matthew B. wrote:\n\t&gt; \n\t&gt; I am one of those people who are nervous about creating an\neffect just\n\t&gt; for testing.  To test methods that only modify private fields\nlike you\n\t&gt; describe, you can use reflection (which I would personally\nprefer).  Use\n\t&gt; the object&#39;s getClass() method then Class&#39;s getField() method.\nField\n\t&gt; extends java.lang.reflect.AccessibleObject which has a\n\t&gt; setAccessible(boolean) method you can use to gain access to a\nprivate\n\t&gt; field through reflection.  Field has getter methods for its\nvalue.\n\t&gt; \n\t&gt; A security manager can be set up to prevent this bypassing of\nthe\n\t&gt; private restriction, but by default you are allowed to do it.\n\t\n\tYou prefer jumping through all those hoops to just adding a\nmethod? To \n\teach his own, but I see that as much more complex than just\nadding a \n\tmethod could ever be.\n\t-- \n\tJ. B.
