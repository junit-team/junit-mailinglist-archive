Did you really need to <br/>\n&gt; run all the database tests, or do they happen to be a <br/>\n&gt; convenient subset of the slow tests?

That is a set of<br/>\nstored procedures which act as a language-independent interface to the<br/>\ndatabase of user information.  I needed to run just those tests to make<br/>\nsure that the user provisioning system hadn&#39;t broken.  There are lots of<br/>\nother slow tests, but I only wanted those that exercise the database.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTodd.</div>",
