Some UNIX operating systems\nhave processes that are heavy, and threads that are lightweight.\nLinux has only processes (threads are implemented as processes).\nWindows only has threads (processes are implemented as threads).\n\nSo let me see what you might be wanting:\n\n1) executing the tests in separate Threads (Java has no real concept\n   of process).\n2) executing the tests in separate JVMs\n\nThe first is easy, and is done by ActiveTestSuite (and there is\nan extension to Junit out there that does performance and load\ntesting...).\n\nThe second would require you to call Runtime.getRuntime().exec()\nfor each separate JVM you wish to run.\n\nThose processes are *very* heavy weight, and do not stress your\nclass (they are in separate classloaders, separate environments\ncompletely).\n\nThe Threads are most likely what you want as they test the concurrency\nof your class the best.\n\n\n",
