If the candidate complains that it&#39;s not their<br/>\nIDE/editor of choice, that should send up a flag. Granted this is my ideal<br/>\nenvironment.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat about a 2 stage interview? One where they write the tests for a already<br/>\nexisting piece of code (maybe to increase the codes functionality), then<br/>\nanother where they try and write code to get the tests to pass.  Granted<br/>\nthis is not testing if they actually use TDD, but it would show if they have<br/>\nthe skill.  Maybe forcing the iteration process of test -&gt; functionality -&gt;<br/>\ntest -&gt; functionality will show if they have the skill.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think spending some time, 2-3 hours with a machine, later in the interview<br/>\nprocess, say after a phone screen, maybe second round of face to face, might<br/>\npay dividends in the quality of people on a team.  Then again it might<br/>\ndepend on how skilled you need this individual to be.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the input,<br/>\n<br/>\nBig Mike<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
