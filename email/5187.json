E.g. a method returning null when it is never supposed<br/>\nto do that generates a NullPointerException somewhere, and the appropriate<br/>\ntest does not reveal that fact by failing.<br/>\n Otherwise, I wouldn&#39;t test the PossibleImprobableRuntimeException, it will<br/>\nbe reported anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; i wonder if writing exception tests in this way can sniff out &quot;smells&quot;<br/>\n&gt; that using a particular method might be too noisy?  that is, instead<br/>\n&gt; of throwing three different, possibly unrelated exceptions, maybe<br/>\n&gt; have the method declare one wrapping exception be thrown?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote> The smell &quot;Missed an aspect to test&quot; ?</div>",
