Works great if you have JProbe 3.0.  Prints out nice looking reports, similar to the HTML reports from Ant&#39;s JUnit task.  Actually somewhat more accurate coverage numbers because the Ant report task uses a reference classpath to do a delta of actual classes/bytes versus classes/bytes loaded by JProbe at runtime.\n\nScott Stirling\nJRun QA\nMacromedia\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Chris Eppstein [mailto:ceppstein@...]\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks to all for your replies. To recap:\n&gt; \n&gt; The filename matching system that David proposed was my first \n&gt; thought as\n&gt; well and it could be implemented as an Ant task easily enough \n&gt; so that can be\n&gt; used to fail a build if a test case is missing, etc... I had \n&gt; started to\n&gt; write this utility when I decided to email the list and make \n&gt; sure I wasn&#39;t\n&gt; re-inventing the wheel. I think that this approach is a good \n&gt; first step but\n&gt; it doesn&#39;t give us a look into the code and it would be \n&gt; difficult to handle\n&gt; interfaces (for which I rarely write a unit test).\n&gt; \n&gt; I looked at NoUnit but I cannot get it to run with Java 1.4 \n&gt; -- it looks\n&gt; promising though. Quilt is the most ambitious of the open \n&gt; source projects\n&gt; and it also looks to be very promising -- but is still pre-alpha and\n&gt; probably not ready for use in a corporate setting.\n&gt; \n&gt; Integration with Ant is, of-course, a big plus for any \n&gt; utility that can be\n&gt; used for this task. Looks like there&#39;s some definate room for \n&gt; improvement in\n&gt; this area. Does anyone else have some suggestions?\n&gt; \n&gt; Chris\n\n",
