I was trying to\nmake an additional point.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; He&#39;s saying that generating tests from existing code has the risk that the\n&gt; code doesn&#39;t do what it was intended but a test is generated to pass based\n&gt; on the incorrect code.  So you would have 100% test passes, which is\n&gt; incorrect against the actual expected results against the requirements.\n&gt;\n\nI am trying to separate the various goals of testing and investigate\ndistinct strategies that would achieve each goal.\n\nOne goal is to prevent regressions: show that, after a change, the\ncode still does what it did before or at least show what behaviors\nchanged (regardless of whether the code was previously &#39;correct&#39;). I\nthink we are agreed that a machine could do this in principle even if\nit is difficult in practice. It still requires a reviewer, though, to\ndecide which changes were intended and which were not .\n\n\nAnother goal is to demonstrate correctness: demonstrate that the code\nbehaves correctly for all inputs. This one is not even theoretically\npossible for a machine to do. But a machine can make the job of a\nhuman reviewer easier by showing combinations of inputs and outputs\nthat are &#39;likely&#39; to represent special or border cases.\n\nFor example, consider this method on a Triangle class:\n\npublic boolean isIsosceles() {\n    return a == b || a == c || b == c;\n}\n\nA machine might generate tests:\n\n    public void testIsIsosceles() throws Throwable {\n        boolean result = new Triangle(59, 100, 59).isIsosceles();\n        assertTrue(&quot;result&quot;, result);\n    }\n\n    public void testIsIsosceles1() throws Throwable {\n        boolean result = new Triangle(100, 59, 59).isIsosceles();\n        assertTrue(&quot;result&quot;, result);\n    }\n\n    public void testIsIsosceles2() throws Throwable {\n        boolean result = new Triangle(30, 30, 30).isIsosceles();\n        assertTrue(&quot;result&quot;, result);\n    }\n\nA reviewer might look at these tests and exclaim &quot;That&#39;s not correct!\nThe last one is equilateral&quot; and amend the spec to exclude equilateral\ntriangles from the definition of isosceles.\n\nA second attempt might amend the code to,\n\n  public boolean isIsosceles() {\n    return a == b || a == c || b == c;\n  }\n\nThe existing tests would then serve as a regression suite. After the\nchange, one of the tests (the previously incorrect one) would now fail\nand (we hope) the others would still pass.\n\nAssuming the tests are essentially &#39;free&#39; and that we can trust the\nmachine to generate tests that are at least as good as they were\nbefore, we can throw all the existing tests away and generate new\nones.\n\nThen we might get a test like this,\n\n    public void testIsIsosceles2() throws Throwable {\n        boolean result = new Triangle(36, 36, 36).isIsosceles();\n        assertFalse(&quot;result&quot;, result);\n    }\n\nand be happy that our method now behaves correctly.\n\nThere are a lot of &#39;if&#39;s and &#39;assuming&#39;s in all that but, with a\nmachine that could generate perfect regression tests in zero time, we\nmight think quite differently about the value of tests and how we use\nthem.\n\nAs JB suggested, it is impossible for a program to prove the\ncorrectness of another program. Even with a human/machine combo it is\ndifficult and tedious which is why I still write all of my code test\nfirst with TDD.\n\nTDD provides excellent regression coverage too but, if it&#39;s\nessentially free to generate tests to fill the gaps in my TDD\ncoverage, why wouldn&#39;t I?\n\nThe more astute reader will have guessed that the examples above were\nlifted directly from the demo page at\nhttp://www.junitfactory.com/demo/   The service is still experimental\nand somewhat less than perfect, but I&#39;d be interested in getting\nfeedback from the kind of people who think a lot about these kinds of\nthings. I can send an invitation to anyone who wants one.\n\nKevin\n\nhttp://www.junitfactory.com\nYou send us code. We send you tests. For free.\n\n",
