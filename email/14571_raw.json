Determine whether Extract Class should be used to split the\n&gt; &gt; responsibilities of the class into two or more abstractions. If so,\n&gt; &gt; refactor and write unit tests for the public methods of the new\n&gt; &gt; classes. Return to step 1.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t see this as a solution. If the method wasn&#39;t public before, it\n&gt; shouldn&#39;t be public now just because it moved to a different class. If\n&gt; the only reason it becomes public is because it moved to a different\n&gt; class, it would be better off as the original private method inside the\n&gt; one class. Public API should be kept to a minimum, especially if you\n&gt; expect anybody to use your API. If the API is purely for your app&#39;s own\n&gt; internal use, then this constraint can be relaxed a little, but you\n&gt; should still strive for the minimum exposure of class internals. This is\n&gt; one of the first principles of object oriented design, and test driven\n&gt; development doesn&#39;t really change it to any significant extent.\n\n If using TDD you are slowly emerging the design. Why would Extract Class \nnot be a valid refactoring? At some point a private method on a class wants \nto be a class in it&#39;s own. Am I missing something?\n Cheers\nShane\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
