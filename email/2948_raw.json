It appears that many \n&gt;people think there are &quot;magic formulas&quot; for working with JUnit. \n&gt;As a result, they ask silly questions like, &quot;How do I test an \n&gt;EJB with JUnit????&quot; The people who know the answer get so \n&gt;tired of writing, &quot;Search this list. Try it. What are you\n&gt;having trouble testing?&quot; that they simply stop responding. \n&gt;As a result, questions are not being answered.\n................\n\nI don&#39;t agree with these opinions. I think there has been \nvery good questions and answers (discussions) here. Of course \nit is good if the answers can already be found in a FAQ\nbut remember that the FAQ is something that is maintained\nusually by one person as on a list like this you can have several\nviews. Take as an example the answers yesterday of why you should use \nJUnit. I am sure you can find data on this already somewhere else. \n\nJUnit is a new thing for many people and this list must also be\navailable to new users and not only to those who have already\ngot an answer to all questions.\n\nKaarle Kaila\n\n\n",
