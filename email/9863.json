Might be worth reading for entertainment, if<br/>\n&gt; nothing else.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Shaun Smith [mailto:shauns@...]<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Thursday, November 13, 2003 12:13 PM<br/>\n&gt; &gt; To: &#39;junit@yahoogroups.com&#39;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Subject: RE: [junit] Is there a place for private methods with TDD?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; In a class (see below) with two public methods A & B that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; both call private method C, what&#39;s the best approach for unit<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; testing it? Should test scenarios for A or B cover what may<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; happen in C ? If so, is it just accepted as a code management<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; overhead to ensure that C is properly tested via tests for A or B<br/>\n </span></blockquote>?<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Was the class in question designed through the application of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; TDD?  If so,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; what is C doing that is extra to what A and B need, and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; therefore covered by<br/>\n&gt; &gt; their tests?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I hope you can forgive me the extravagance of quoting myself from<br/>\n </span></blockquote>last<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; month:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Test First means that very few of my methods are private, and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I really don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; see this as a bad thing.  (Most of the ones that are private<br/>\n&gt; &gt; are there only<br/>\n&gt; &gt; because that&#39;s what Eclipses&#39; Extract Method refactoring does).<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; NB:  That is not the same as making private methods public for<br/>\n </span></blockquote>testing<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; purposes.
