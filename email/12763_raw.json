With annotations you don&#39;t need\n&gt; &gt; to inherit from a framework (jUnit) class.  You simply annotate the\n&gt; &gt; class and it becomes a TestCase.  This means you don&#39;t need to break\n&gt; &gt; out your tests into separate classes (though one is still free to do\n&gt; &gt; so).\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m biased, being a JUnit user, but I don&#39;t like the idea of tests \n&gt; living in with the class under test. My objection is that it implicitly \n&gt; encourages a testing style with which I disagree: that there is a 1:1 \n&gt; correspondence between fixtures and classes under test.\n&gt; \n&gt; I do admit that in those cases where the 1:1 correspondence holds, it \n&gt; might be better to put tests and production code together, but I\nusually \n&gt; have a large number of small test methods, and I feel like that would \n&gt; pollute my production code.\n&gt; \n&gt; ...or did you mean something else entirely? :)\n&gt; -- \n\nI think I meant the more general case of just not being bound to\ninherit from a jUnit framework class.  That&#39;s the main point.  Since\nJava is single inheritance there are times when you want to have your\ntest live in some framework (say testing in J2EE) and having to\ninherit from the jUnit class becomes an obstacle to testing in some of\nthose cases.  (There are other obstacles too, of course.)  So I meant\nthe benefits of decoupling.  The framework can run tests and still be\nautomatic without imposing any requirements on the hierarchy of the\ntest classes.\n\n\n\n\n",
