Could anybody tell me how to test abstract classes?\n\nAbstract classes can&#39;t be instantiated, so you can&#39;t test them directly.\nI&#39;d use a concrete subclass of the abstract class for testing.\n\n&gt; How to test private methods in a class?\n\nOoh. This one is a religious battle.  The answer depends upon how dearly\nyou love encapsulation philosophy.  \n\nIf you want to test the private method directly, one method is to\nprovide a more-accessible test method which exercises the private\nmethod.  Your unit test would call the more-accessible test method.\n\nAnother method is to inspect the class for more-accessible methods\nwhich use the private method, and craft a test which excercises the\nprivate method via the more-accessible method.\n\nIf your method is using default access, create a test class which\nextends the class and write tests on/for the test class.\n\nThe method I use for my current project is to just set the private\nmethod to protected instead of private.  My project doesn&#39;t have\na published interface outside the company, so anyone who misuses\nprotected methods is within easy reach of my big, fat cluebat.\n\nMy unit tests sit in the same package (but not the same project\ndirectory) as the classes under test, so my unit tests can access\nanything which is public or protected.  Works great.  The few\nitems I really do have set private are usually \nthings-that-can&#39;t-possibly-break, anyway.\n\n-- \nJoi Ellis                    Software Engineer\nAravox Technologies          joi@..., gyles19@...\n\nNo matter what we think of Linux versus FreeBSD, etc., the one thing I\nreally like about Linux is that it has Microsoft worried.  Anything\nthat kicks a monopoly in the pants has got to be good for something.\n           - Chris Johnson\n\n\n",
