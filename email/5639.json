The problem is that the code is not OO. Where are the number and<br/>\ndate objects that create themselves from string representations? This<br/>\nis not a terribly difficult thing to write nor to test. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;- partial initialization of members<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This may be a design problem: if I can exit a constructor without a<br/>\nvalid object, then maybe the constructor needs to do more or require<br/>\nmore of me.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;- methods called in no particular order (may reveal unstable state)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Indeed, this is tricky... this points to another design issue and is<br/>\nnot necessarily a simple issue to solve. The answer for the moment is<br/>\nto have as little of this as possible. If you find you have to test it<br/>\noften, then you have too much of it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;the problem with negative testing is that it&#39;s endless.  It&#39;s hard to<br/>\n </span></blockquote>test<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;what<br/>\n&gt;a system can do but even harder to test what it can&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>So you have a choice: either be like Ron and code to the main line, or<br/>\nbe clear about what happens when your class&#39; clients are sloppy. You<br/>\nmay find a way to eliminate the opportunity to be sloppy, which is<br/>\nusually best...<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;It&#39;s possible to use JUnit to write negative tests (like testing<br/>\n&gt;exceptions)<br/>\n&gt;but if you have 1,000 classes and you want to test that each method of<br/>\n&gt;every<br/>\n&gt;class handles &#39;null&#39; arguments correctly... well it&#39;s going to take a<br/>\n&gt;while.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Not with reflection... as long as you always handle the &quot;null&quot; argument<br/>\nthe same way, it&#39;s no worse than scanning all the classes in a source<br/>\npath and iterating... I&#39;ve never done it, but I wouldn&#39;t think it would<br/>\nbe that difficult. Annoying, perhaps; but you&#39;d only have to do it<br/>\nonce.<br/>\n<br/>\nJ. B.
