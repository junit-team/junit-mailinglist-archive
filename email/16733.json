Agitator looks like it can eliminate the need to write most JUnit<br/>\n&gt; tests (except true persistence testing).  The downside is that we<br/>\n&gt; would be left with only Agitator config files that contain our<br/>\n&gt; business logic assertions.  This seems like a big leap to take, given<br/>\n&gt; that if Agitar goes away, we have no JUnit.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hi David<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been playing around with Agitator and also attended a presentation by<br/>\nJeff Frederick from Agitar about Developer testing.  Two things ... 1.<br/>\nAgitar have realised that they have pushed the product thing a bit too far;<br/>\nand 2. Agitator is not a replacement for JUnit and I have not seen anyone<br/>\nsuggest that.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave a look for a thread on the TDD group where I asked a similar question<br/>\nto you .. and Jeff responded.  They wrote up their experiences TDD their<br/>\nDashboard product using JUnit and Agitator.  It&#39;s titled the XPeriment (or<br/>\nsomething similar).<br/>\n<br/>\nJeff also had some slides on Agitation Driven Refactorings which looked<br/>\ninteresting.  Where I can see agiation adding value is in the example they<br/>\nfound where a method took a string.  It then tried to instantiate a class<br/>\nfrom that string.  Agitator looked at the method and went &quot;it takes a string<br/>\n... well let&#39;s try any string then&quot; ... and so identfied an area that could<br/>\ncause a bug.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been trying to agitate the bowling game to see what refactorings it<br/>\ndrives me to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway bottom line, I think the product compliments JUnit and TDD ... I am<br/>\njust not sure on how much that is yet.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<br/>\nShane<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
