    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1896369867\">Marc, I agree that Hamcrest is a terrific library for expressing expected test outcomes. So is FEST-Assert. If my tests are small and focused enough, I might even roll with native Java assertions. The AssertionError (or, really, any exception that propagates out of a test) represents sort of an implicit contract between test and runner: signal the test as failed if the exception makes it out of the test unhandled. There are lots of ways to satisfy that contract; I&#39;m not sure that one based on Hamcrest has to be the answer.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe time period between JUnit 4.4 and 4.11 was challenging for those developers who wanted some of the goodness of Hamcrest &gt; 1.1, what with the attendant Maven exclusions, surprising failures, and so forth. It led me to wonder whether Assert/Assume ought to be separate from the core of JUnit. Then, the putative &quot;junit-assertions&quot; module could depend on Hamcrest if it so chose, and &quot;junit-core&quot; (made-up module that doesn&#39;t exist right now) wouldn&#39;t have to. Further, developers could choose to use junit-assertions or not; Hamcrest alone (with MatcherAssert.assertThat()) or not; FEST-Assert, etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think of AssumptionViolatedException as another implicit contract between test and runner. Right now, though, unless you want to depend on a public-but-not-published AssumptionViolatedException class that you need Hamcrest to use, org.junit.Assume is the only way to satisfy that contract. Better would be to have AssumptionViolatedException be part of &quot;junit-core&quot;, not depending on Hamcrest, and letting Assume live in &quot;junit-assertions&quot; and handle the Hamcrest matching.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll send more under separate cover, maybe as a GitHub issue, as this doesn&#39;t pertain so much to JUnit 4.11 beta 1 as it does a consideration for the next major version of JUnit. I think it&#39;d be interesting to explore segmenting JUnit into a multi-module project with dependencies teased out a bit.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again for your excellent work and stewardship!<br/>\n<br/>\n--p<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, Marc Philipp &lt;mphilipp82@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From my very personal point-of-view I cannot imagine using JUnit without<br/>\n&gt; Hamcrest anymore.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; @Paul: What would be the benefit of &quot;breaking the dependency&quot; entirely?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; @Mirko: Why shouldn&#39;t you be able to use a different version of Hamcrest?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Regards, Marc<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
