Now the user interface is staticly\nbuilt, but I&#39;m sure someone is doing something about\nthat.\n\nCheers,\n- Ole\n\n\n\n\n\n--- &quot;James P.

But, in the\n&gt; spirit of our mythical \n&gt; programmer who writes her code and then presses the\n&gt; &#39;Generate Tests&#39; \n&gt; button; it would not be unlikely for the entire\n&gt; package to have 5000 \n&gt; tests generated. This is great - we want lots of\n&gt; tests - provided we \n&gt; don&#39;t have to go through all the passing tests to\n&gt; see which are \n&gt; correctly testing invalid code. Clearly she is going\n&gt; to do incremental \n&gt; build and test, but all those tests have to be\n&gt; looked at eventually. \n&gt; That is why I proposed the guidance to tell the test\n&gt; generator &#39;I don&#39;t \n&gt; care what I actually wrote, this is what the code is\n&gt; supposed to do.&#39; \n&gt; With the inclusion of that kind of guidance, the\n&gt; 100% testing with zero \n&gt; (programmer) effort may be possible.\n&gt; \n&gt;  &gt; This fits well with the notion that testing is\n&gt; about\n&gt;  &gt; good design.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Good design is easy to validate by the developer.\n&gt; \n&gt; On an academic note, are you sure that &quot;good design\n&gt; is easy to \n&gt; validate&quot;?  I&#39;ve certainly been in some animated\n&gt; discussions in which it \n&gt; was hard to reach agreement :-)\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Jim\n&gt; -- \n&gt; James P.
