I had attended a\n&gt; presenta=\r\ntion by Robert &quot;Uncle Bob&quot; Martin on Test Driven\n&gt; development. I think the=\r\n exact example was a program to keep track\n&gt; of a bowling game score. Prese=\r\nnting the Big view object model and\n&gt; one done through incremental, test dr=\r\niven development, the later was\n&gt; much simpler. It only required the creati=\r\non of objects needed to\n&gt; solve the problem rather then the apparent object=\r\ns and their\n&gt; behaviour.\n \n I have no doubt that TDD works great on such si=\r\nmple problems and that it \ncan\n even lead to a reasonable design. Then agai=\r\nn, the problem space is so \nsmall\n that you can argue that no design will r=\r\neally be wrong anyway...\n \n Now consider a more realistic example, such as =\r\nan application that is\n dealing with five database tables, each with four t=\r\no ten columns, each of\n which needs to be mapped to Java objects in a sensi=\r\nble way (i.e. not\n necessarily mapping the tables and the objects one-to-on=\r\ne) and should \nalso\n include business methods and objects to make it easier=\r\n to perform\n domain-specific operations.\n \n Using TDD to drive such a desig=\r\nn is guaranteed to lead to an architecture\n that will be focused on solving=\r\n micro-problems and that will totally miss\n the big picture. You are much b=\r\netter off spending a few minutes with a\n piece of paper or a white board to=\r\n design your classes and your object\n diagram.\n \n If you want to use TDD to=\r\n implement this model after that, fine, but I\n really dispute the idea that=\r\n TDD should drive the design in the general\n case, because TDD simply never=\r\n gives you the big picture.\n \n Makes sense?\n \n -- \n C=E9dric\n http://testng=\r\n. &lt;http://testng.org&gt; org\n\n\nWe have been successfully using TDD on a large =\r\nproject for the last 23 \nweeks - Large as in 10s of Database Schemas  each =\r\ncontaining (5-15 tables, \n10s of Stored Procs, Grants, Synonyms, etc), 100s=\r\n of classes, 1000s of \nFitnesse tests. etc... \n\nIts doable - like anything,=\r\n it takes a deciplined, dedicated and \nthoughtful team.\n\nIts not the techni=\r\nque, its the team at the end of the day.\n\nAndrew\n\n[Non-text portions of thi=\r\ns message have been removed]\n\n\n",
