I would expect it to be something more th=\r\nan a way of avoiding that kind of boilerplate.\n\nAs an example of the kind o=\r\nf thing I think a class rule would enable, is that it might allow the rule =\r\nto dynamically pass values to the test class&#39;s constructor based on some dy=\r\nnamic criteria (say a souped up version of Parameterized) or perhaps change=\r\n the runner that will run the tests, or dynamically disable certain tests (=\r\nsay based on the OS the test is running on). Something that is not possible=\r\n with an @BeforeClass or @AfterClass annotation.\n\nBut that is just my imagi=\r\nnation. I&#39;m curious if there are real use cases like that.\n\n--- In junit@ya=\r\nhoogroups.com, Max Bowsher &lt;maxb@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; On 23/04/10 16:39, yme0987=\r\n654321 wrote:\n&gt; &gt; I really don&#39;t think that is true. MethodRule allows you =\r\nto do things\n&gt; &gt; based on the specific test name, and intercept and even re=\r\nplace the\n&gt; &gt; running of a test. Consider ExpectedException. You really cou=\r\nld not\n&gt; &gt; do anything like that in a @Before or @After method. You would h=\r\nave\n&gt; &gt; to do it inside your test and use an execute around pattern to hand=\r\nle\n&gt; &gt; the exception.\n&gt; \n&gt; Your point concerning ExpectedException is valid=\r\n, but arguing that\n&gt; method rules are even more useful than class rules doe=\r\ns not say anything\n&gt; about class rules being unuseful.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; For your use =\r\ncase it is a drop more boilerplate than a rule, but all\n&gt; &gt; you would do is=\r\n define a @Before method in a common superclass or in\n&gt; &gt; your @Before call=\r\n a class that encapsulates the functionality. Yes\n&gt; &gt; you have to wrap the =\r\ncall in a method rather than defining a field,\n&gt; &gt; but Java is kind of verb=\r\nose already.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Java is verbose already&quot; is not a good reason to make th=\r\nings even more\n&gt; unnecessarily verbose.\n&gt; \n&gt; You say I should write:\n&gt; \n&gt;  =\r\n   public static MyThing myThing =3D\n&gt;         new MyThing(MyEnclosingTestC=\r\nlass.class);\n&gt; \n&gt;     @BeforeClass public static void beforeClass() {\n&gt;    =\r\n     myThing.begin();\n&gt;     }\n&gt; \n&gt;     @AfterClass public static void after=\r\nClass() {\n&gt;         myThing.end();\n&gt;     }\n&gt; \n&gt; I want to write:\n&gt; \n&gt;     @=\r\nRule public static MyThing myThing =3D new MyThing();\n&gt; \n&gt; Personally, I th=\r\nink the second is self-evidently greatly advantageous.\n&gt; \n&gt;  * Much less bo=\r\nilerplate in each test using the common code.\n&gt;  * Don&#39;t need to repeat you=\r\nrself nearly as much.\n&gt;  * No risk of forgetting the teardown.\n&gt; \n&gt; Max.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n\n\n\n",
