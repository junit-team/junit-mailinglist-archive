There&#39;s three kinds of software<br/>\n&gt;  out there:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  1) Software good enough that some company finally decides to shrink-wrap<br/>\n&gt;  it and ship it to millions, or put it up on their public website and<br/>\n&gt;  wait to get bought by Yahoo!<br/>\n&gt;  2) Software just good enough for the single customer that paid for it to<br/>\n&gt;  pay off the contract.<br/>\n&gt;  3) Software that never sees the light of day. (try googling for &quot;* of<br/>\n&gt;  software projects fail&quot;)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I didn&#39;t even think about #3. Sadly that also happens... TDD can be a<br/>\npart of the answer here but  I bet a whole lot more is wrong in those<br/>\nprojectcs.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  she was told: 1) They&#39;re rolling out a new computer system next year, 2)<br/>\n&gt;  Of course, it will probably take about six months to shake out all the<br/>\n&gt;  bugs, but after that, it will be really nice.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  I was floored that: 1) My wife and her informant both took it for<br/>\n&gt;  granted that the software would release with significant bugs, 2) My own<br/>\n&gt;  first reaction was actually &quot;Yeah, what can you do.&quot; (indignation came<br/>\n&gt;  later), 3) We&#39;re talking about _prescribing drugs to hospital patients_<br/>\n&gt;  here.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That reminds me of when I started out as a programmer and I was very<br/>\nintimidated by the fact that I knew so little and everyone else must<br/>\nknow so much. After a while I got some experience but it was not<br/>\n&quot;real&quot; experience, we didn&#39;t have really good control over what we<br/>\nwere doing so I dreamt of working on a &quot;real&quot; team, you know the kind<br/>\nthey must have in banks and when developing medical equipment and<br/>\nsuch... Later I have been working at  a bank and I know more than I<br/>\nwould like to know about development of medical equipment.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  However, perhaps none of this is the point.  In the end, it doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;  matter if the global software industry is producing software that meets<br/>\n&gt;  some criteria of &quot;good enough&quot;.  What matters to most of our paychecks<br/>\n&gt;  is that our software is better than what our customers could get more<br/>\n&gt;  cheaply from someone else.  I submit that disciplined unit testing has<br/>\n&gt;  enough success stories that it&#39;s worth trying it to see if it makes<br/>\n&gt;  things better.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Couldn&#39;t agree with you more. When I think that things around me works<br/>\ngood enough and I can&#39;t see any problems that needs to be solved I<br/>\nwill be really scared since it probably means that:<br/>\n<br/>\na) I have given up<br/>\nb) I have stopped learning and trying new things.<br/>\nc) there is probably a c...</div>",
