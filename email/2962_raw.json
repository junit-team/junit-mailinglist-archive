There is. You can try to argue against that all you \nwant, and you&#39;d be wrong. Even today I saw a message saying, &quot;I think that&#39;s \na good question. I think an answer would be useful.&quot;\n\nDO WE REALLY NEED TO SAY THAT?! Do you really need to write to a mailing \nlist, &quot;Yeah. I wanna know too!&quot; OF COURSE YOU WANT TO KNOW! That&#39;s why you \nread the list. That&#39;s enough, thanks.\n\nCome on, folks. I was new at this once, too. Someone told me, &quot;Stop doing \nthat.&quot; I learned. Don&#39;t feel like you should be treated any differently. The \nbottom line is that there are far too many &quot;Would you tell me exactly what \nto do in order to test my application?&quot; questions. That is NOT what this \nlist is for!\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;JUnit is a new thing for many people and this list must also be\navailable to new users and not only to those who have already\ngot an answer to all questions.&lt;&lt;&lt;\n\nI never said that it should not be accessible to new users. It should not, \nhowever, be used as a SUBSTITUTE for learning; it is supposed to help us \nlearn about JUnit. Those who treat it like a magic answer box are the ones \nthat bother me.\n\nIncidentally, I learned about JUnit long before this list appeared. Do you \nthink I&#39;m some supergenius? No. I read, I tried and then I read some more. \nWhen I couldn&#39;t figure it out, I searched for answers. Why can&#39;t other \npeople do that?\n\nJBR.\n\n---- Begin original message ----\n\n--- In junit@y..., Eric Vought &lt;evought@q...&gt; wrote:\nand\n--- In junit@y..., &quot;J. B. Rainsberger&quot; &lt;jbrains762@h...&gt; wrote:\n.....\n &gt;Ladies and Gentlemen:\n &gt;\n &gt;I am frankly quite concerned with the quality of the exchanges\n &gt;going on here in the last several weeks. It appears that many\n &gt;people think there are &quot;magic formulas&quot; for working with JUnit.\n &gt;As a result, they ask silly questions like, &quot;How do I test an\n &gt;EJB with JUnit????&quot; The people who know the answer get so\n &gt;tired of writing, &quot;Search this list. Try it. What are you\n &gt;having trouble testing?&quot; that they simply stop responding.\n &gt;As a result, questions are not being answered.\n................\n\nI don&#39;t agree with these opinions. I think there has been\nvery good questions and answers (discussions) here. Of course\nit is good if the answers can already be found in a FAQ\nbut remember that the FAQ is something that is maintained\nusually by one person as on a list like this you can have several\nviews. Take as an example the answers yesterday of why you should use\nJUnit. I am sure you can find data on this already somewhere else.\n\nJUnit is a new thing for many people and this list must also be\navailable to new users and not only to those who have already\ngot an answer to all questions.\n\nKaarle Kaila\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp\n\n\n",
