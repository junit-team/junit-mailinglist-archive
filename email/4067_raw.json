In differents versions they might run in different\norders.\n\nAlso. Tests should be independent from one another. \nIf you need to test the Get then you will have to do a Set first. However\nthis test should be concentrating on the results of the Get rather than the\nsuccess of the Set.\nIf this means you are duplicating code then it&#39;s time to start refactoring.\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: J. B. Rainsberger [mailto:jbr@...]\n&gt; Sent: 14 February 2002 13:34\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: RE: [junit] Test Order Execution\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Quoting &quot;Heath, Joseph&quot; &lt;HeathJ@...&gt;:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; JUnit doesnt guarantee the order of the tests. Your tests \n&gt; shouldnt rely\n&gt; &gt; on\n&gt; &gt; other tests being executed before them.\n&gt; \n&gt; True, you shouldn&#39;t depend on the order of execution of \n&gt; tests, but if you must \n&gt; (and sometimes it&#39;s just easier that way), you *can* control \n&gt; the order in which \n&gt; tests are run.\n&gt; \n&gt; Understand that you don&#39;t have to name your test methods \n&gt; &quot;testX&quot;. That was a \n&gt; convention that became a standard, leading to a convenience \n&gt; feature in xUnit. \n&gt; You can always build your test suite by hand:\n&gt; \n&gt; public class MyTestCase extends TestCase {\n&gt;     public static Test suite() {\n&gt;         final TestSuite suite = new TestSuite();\n&gt;         suite.addTest(new MyTestCase(&quot;myTestMethod1&quot;));\n&gt;         suite.addTest(new MyTestCase(&quot;myTestMethod2&quot;));\n&gt;         suite.addTest(new MyTestCase(&quot;myTestMethod3&quot;));\n&gt;         suite.addTest(new MyTestCase(&quot;myTestMethod4&quot;));\n&gt;     }\n&gt;     ...\n&gt; }\n&gt; \n&gt; DOWNSIDE: You must keep the suite up to date as you change \n&gt; the test methods in \n&gt; the test case. You will forget. It will cause you problems. \n&gt; If those problems \n&gt; are small compared to your current problem, then you should \n&gt; consider doing \n&gt; this; otherwise, you should take the time to learn about your \n&gt; design by \n&gt; exploring how to remove the dependency.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m currently developing JUnitEE for use with a J2EE \n&gt; &gt; &gt; application, and admit to being relatively new to J2EE and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; JUnit. However, I am getting problems running test suites as \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the order of execution does not appear to be constant. \n&gt; &lt;snip /&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; J. B.
