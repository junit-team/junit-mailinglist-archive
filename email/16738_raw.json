Of course, I\n&gt; believe it can do a lot - but I am hardly an impartial party :-).\n\n\nHi Alberto\n\nKeeping your impartial hat on ;-)  ... if we removed the context of TDD\nwould that change you view on the use of Agitator with JUnit?\n\nWe are currently looking at defining Developer Testing within our\norganisation.  I get the impression that current thinking is that I could\nuse Agitator instead of JUnit.  Now this may be correct  But I am wondering\nhow correct?\n\nIt could be correct in the same way that I could rub two sticks together\ninstead of using matches or it could be correct in that I could use matches\ninstead of a lighter.\n\nOr do you see Agitator complementing JUnit in the same way whether you are\nusing TTD or not?\n\nMy current thinking is the two tools solve slightly different problems ...\nor they address testing is different ways.  An example that comes to mind is\nin the Agitator tutorial.  In reaching full agitation the observation that\nthe length of product name is less than 20 revealed a bug.  But as I saw\nthat I thought ... but if I had a JUnit test testing the boundaries of name\nas specified would have been tested and that mistake highlighted\nimmediately.  Anyhow at the moment I am thinking that developers should\nstart with JUnit or JUnit + Agitator and not simply just Agitator.\n\nYour thoughts?\n\n\nThanks\nShane\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
