    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-690466787\">Hello,<br/>\n<br/>\nA colleague and myself are beginning to implement JUnit tests. We are facing a dilemma that I hope you can help us with. How are dependent unit tests handled? <br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, there are 2 independent methods that must be tested, but to test them and clean-up they become dependent. So, the methods are addRecordToDB() and deleteRecordFromDB(). Additionally, addRecordToDB() will fail if the record already exists in the database.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo test that addRecordToDB() can add a new record, testAddRecordToDB() must ensure that the record does not already exist, which relies on a deleteRecordFormDB() message in setUp().<br/>\n<br/>\nTo test that deleteRecordFromDB() can delete an existing record, testDeleteRecordFromDB() must ensure that the record already exists in the database, which relies on an addRecordToDB() in setUp().<br/>\n<br/>\nTo test that addRecordToDB() fails if the record already exists, testAddRecordToDBDuplication() must ensure that either <br/>\n<br/>\n- the record does not already exist, which relies on deleteRecordFromDB() in setUp() and 2 addRecordToDB() messages in the test method OR<br/>\n<br/>\n- the record already exists, which relies on 1 addRecordToDB() message in setup() and 1 addRecordToDB() message in the test Method<br/>\n<br/>\nThese same issues also affect the tearDown() method.<br/>\n<br/>\nGenerically stated, should a test method&#39;s setUp() and tearDown() rely on an untested method? If not, how can we avoid it? Is there a way to enforce the sequence of test method runs?<br/>\n<br/>\nAny advice would be appreciated. Thanks.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\n Yahoo! Mail - You care about security.
