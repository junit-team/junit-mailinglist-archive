We lost our way for a while and of\ncourse ended up with a few failed tests (~20 out of 2000) after a large\nrefactoring period.  I&#39;m now trying to get on top of it while still trying\nto keep the progress trackers happy which means I can&#39;t spend an\nindeterminate amount of time fixing the tests without appearing not to\nprogress on the primary requirement set.  So, I&#39;d like to cap the test\nerrors/failures as they are now and reduce it over time as we fix the broken\ncode/tests over a (short) period or time, until we get to 0 and &quot;realise&quot;\nthe real benefits of an automated test suite.\n\n \n\nUntil we get it to 0 issues I need to cap it.  At the end of the day though\nI agree wholeheartedly with J.B. but I have to get back to &quot;the perfect\nworld&quot; first and at least failing the build when we get worse than we are is\na start.\n\n \n\nThanks again.  Looks like I&#39;ll be delving into the code at some stage soon,\nor I&#39;ll play the TestResult-Enforcer personally for a little while.\n\n \n\nGreg.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  _____  \n\nFrom: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of J.\nB.

You have the code, dive in and code up a storm. :-)\n\nYou&#39;d have to have the Ant folks, but I believe Simon is correct: you&#39;d \nhave to enhance the Ant &lt;junit&gt; task. You could add a property for that, \nI suppose.\n\nIs that really what you want, though? Do you want to tolerate, say, 10 \ntest failures? What if you only have 10 tests? 100? 1000? (I know you \nmight not have these problems /now/....)\n\n&gt; &gt; The &lt;junit&gt; task seems to only set a fail/error property and not the \n&gt; number\n&gt; &gt; of failures in a test case.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes, that&#39;s the way it works. I&#39;m thinking it&#39;s by design, on the\n&gt; belief that you either want the first thing that fails or everything\n&gt; that fails. Generally, I suspect, a few things that failed would be\n&gt; much less useful.\n\nI work this way: either I tolerate test failures or I don&#39;t. I tolerate \ntest failures for customer tests, but not for programmer tests. I&#39;ve \nnever wanted to tolerate &quot;a few&quot; failures, for any value of &quot;a few&quot; in \ncode that I committed to source control.\n-- \nJ. B.
