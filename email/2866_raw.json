What was involved?\n&gt;\n&gt; I don&#39;t think that it was done and I was wondering if an internationalized JUnit can add much value.  A nice to have but certainly not a top priority.\n&gt;\n&gt; It could be interesting to know if people find it difficult to use JUnit because of the language.  To evangelize, you sometimes have to speak the language of your listeners :-)\n&gt;\n&gt; If the internationalization is decided I can provide a French translation.\n&gt;\n&gt; -Vladimir\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
