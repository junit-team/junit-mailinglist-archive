A have found no way to customize the way they are compiled<br/>\n&gt; to use the AspectJ specific compilers. Hence, I cannot benefit of AOP<br/>\n&gt; when unit testing.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Is this just a technical matter, or is it politically<br/>\n&gt; (philosophically, theologically) wrong to try to perform unit testing<br/>\n&gt; on AOP components ?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Many thanks for any advice.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Mark<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It very much depends on what you intend to test:<br/>\n1/ the adviced code (you can use junit for this)<br/>\n2/ the aspects themselves: at this junit is not offering to much help. maybe the new aUnit may help<br/>\nhere, even if it is in its incipient state.<br/>\n<br/>\n:alex |.::the_mindstorm::.|</div>",
