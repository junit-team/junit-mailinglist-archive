How\ncan =\r\n&quot;asking a question&quot; (which must include a 2nd \nparty) be &quot;helping yourself&quot;=\r\n (which cannot include a \n2nd party)?\n\n&gt; You have also failed to consider t=\r\nhat in some \n&gt; countries Google is not necessarily a buzz-word, so the \n&gt; q=\r\nuestion may not be directed there.\n\nThat&#39;s true - I didn&#39;t really consider =\r\nthat.  Maybe\nI&#39;m being close-minded, but it&#39;s hard to fathom that \na person=\r\n can find a website to sign up for an email \nlist, but then be unable to do=\r\n a web search.  Heck,\nthe JUnit web page itself has two different web searc=\r\nh \nfields on it - one for the web in general, and one \nto search for conten=\r\nt of prior messages.  If this\nlist was about learning basic computing skill=\r\ns, I\nmight believe what you wrote.  But everyone here is\nin the software de=\r\nvelopment field.  How do you get \nto be a practicing software development p=\r\nrofessional\n(or student) in the 21st century without knowing how \nto do a w=\r\neb search?  (That question isn&#39;t totally \nrhetorical.  If there really is a=\r\n way, I&#39;d love to \nhear about it.)\n\n\nSimon Chappell wrote:\n&gt; That does take=\r\n a few minutes, but it&#39;s the nicest way to deal \n&gt; with that sort of person=\r\n that I&#39;ve seen. This list is very \n&gt; friendly and helpful and populated by=\r\n some fine people, so \n&gt; the last thing we want to do is to seem judgementa=\r\nl or rude. \n\nWhoa!  I definitely didn&#39;t mean to imply that I\nrecommend bein=\r\ng rude or judgmental to anyone.  I \nwould hope that a separate beginner&#39;s l=\r\nist would \ncontinue to be just as polite and helpful as this\nlist is today.=\r\n\n\n \nJ.B. Rainsberger wrote:\n&gt; Todd, I appreciate your concern and have rais=\r\ned that myself, \n&gt; in the past. \n\nYes, I know we&#39;ve discussed it here.\n\n&gt; I=\r\n would find it difficult to stay on this list \n&gt; myself, if it weren&#39;t so l=\r\now traffic. Also take into \n&gt; consideration the number of posts we already =\r\nreject, because \n&gt; the questions are too basic. \n\nWow, I did not realize th=\r\nat there are posts getting\nactively rejected!  If this is a moderated list,=\r\n\nit seems like the moderators could easily reply\nto the &quot;whats junit&quot; type =\r\nof questions with a link \nto the FAQ and never pass those on to the rest of=\r\n \nthe group.\n\n&gt; If we don&#39;t encourage the \n&gt; general public to post their q=\r\nuestions, then who will we have \n&gt; to discuss interesting topics with in a =\r\nfew years?\n\nPerhaps I&#39;m self-centered, because I expect others\nto take the =\r\nsame general approach to learning a new\ntechnology that I do, which is:  re=\r\nad what I can\nabout it until I get stuck, then read more from a\ndifferent a=\r\nuthor, and if I&#39;m still stuck, then ask\nfor help.  I believe that the peopl=\r\ne who do NOT take\nthat approach aren&#39;t likely to be here to discuss\nthe int=\r\neresting topics in a few years.  I believe\nthat the people who ask the obvi=\r\nous FAQs get just\nenough info to complete their homework assignment\nor plac=\r\nate their boss or whatever, and then disappear \nand don&#39;t participate in fu=\r\nrther discussions.  But\nthat&#39;s just a hunch.  Maybe I should do a random \ns=\r\nurvey of &quot;not-smart&quot; questions from 2 years ago to \nsee if those people are=\r\n the ones now actively con-\ntributing to the discussion here.\n\n\nMike wrote:=\r\n\n&gt; As a newbie user/lurker myself I don&#39;t recall reading the \n&gt; FAQ, but ha=\r\nve made a note to look it up now...  \n\nJust today I unsubscribed and then r=\r\nesubscribed,\nto confirm that the FAQ is automatically emailed \nto new membe=\r\nrs.  I wonder if the auto mailer \ndoesn&#39;t work for everyone.\n\n\nTodd.\n\n\n\n",
