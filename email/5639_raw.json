In other words, that your system can\nhandle\n&gt;incorrect or inappropriate information.  Examples are:\n&gt;\n&gt;- calling a method with wrong arguments (null, boundaries...)\n\nReflection can generally make this easier to do. JTest also appears to\ndo a good job at checking whether boundary values lead to unhandled\nexceptions.\n\n&gt;- wrong type of String (numeric instead of text, wrong date format...)\n\nBoo! The problem is that the code is not OO. Where are the number and\ndate objects that create themselves from string representations? This\nis not a terribly difficult thing to write nor to test. :)\n\n&gt;- partial initialization of members\n\nThis may be a design problem: if I can exit a constructor without a\nvalid object, then maybe the constructor needs to do more or require\nmore of me.\n\n&gt;- methods called in no particular order (may reveal unstable state)\n\nIndeed, this is tricky... this points to another design issue and is\nnot necessarily a simple issue to solve. The answer for the moment is\nto have as little of this as possible. If you find you have to test it\noften, then you have too much of it.\n\n&gt;the problem with negative testing is that it&#39;s endless.  It&#39;s hard to\ntest\n&gt;what\n&gt;a system can do but even harder to test what it can&#39;t.\n\nSo you have a choice: either be like Ron and code to the main line, or\nbe clear about what happens when your class&#39; clients are sloppy. You\nmay find a way to eliminate the opportunity to be sloppy, which is\nusually best...\n\n&gt;It&#39;s possible to use JUnit to write negative tests (like testing\n&gt;exceptions)\n&gt;but if you have 1,000 classes and you want to test that each method of\n&gt;every\n&gt;class handles &#39;null&#39; arguments correctly... well it&#39;s going to take a\n&gt;while.  \n\nNot with reflection... as long as you always handle the &quot;null&quot; argument\nthe same way, it&#39;s no worse than scanning all the classes in a source\npath and iterating... I&#39;ve never done it, but I wouldn&#39;t think it would\nbe that difficult. Annoying, perhaps; but you&#39;d only have to do it\nonce.\n\nJ. B.
