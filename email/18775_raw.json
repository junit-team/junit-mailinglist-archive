If the JUnit 4 test is run in our test suite, it still complains that there are no tests in the test class (although they have been annotated with @Test).\n   \n  Your @RunWith(TestClassRunner.class) solution does not work for suites.\n   \n  Is there a solution? It would be tough to migrate all our 500+ JUnit tests so that they can be run in our suites.\n  \n\nDavid Saff &lt;saff@...&gt; wrote:\n          Hans,\n\nSorry, it took me a couple times to get my head around what you were\nreally asking. Try this:\n\n@RunWith(TestClassRunner.class)\npublic class OurOwnMockObjectTestCase extends MockObjectTestCase {\n@After public void setUp() { super.setUp() }\n@Before public void tearDown() { super.tearDown() }\n\n// ... other helper methods\n}\n\nNow, subclasses of OurOwnMockObjectTestCase should behave as you\nexpect, while you still get the inherited methods and behaviors of\nMockObjectTestCase. However, you will have to annotate all your test\nmethods with @Test if you do this--there is no way to mix &quot;testFoo()&quot;\nand &quot;@Test bar()&quot; in the same class and have both run.\n\nLet me know if that&#39;s closer to a solution. Thanks,\n\nDavid Saff\n\nOn 1/24/07, Hans Schwaebli &lt;hans_schwaebli@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; I try to explain it in a different way. Please look at this:\n&gt;\n&gt; import junit.framework.TestCase;\n&gt; import org.junit.Test;\n&gt;\n&gt; public class MyTest extends TestCase {\n&gt; @Test\n&gt; public void foo() {\n&gt; }\n&gt;\n&gt; }\n&gt;\n&gt; When I start this test, I get this error message: junit.framework.AssertionFailedError: No tests found in MyTest\n&gt;\n&gt; I run it on Eclipse 3.3 M4 with JUnit 4.2 in classpath.\n&gt;\n&gt; As soon as I remove &quot;extends TestCase&quot;, the test runs with no error! But this behaviour is deadly for migrating from JUnit 3 to JUnit 4!\n&gt;\n&gt; I don&#39;t believe that Beck and Gamma did cause such migration problems. Or did they? If not, what is the solution?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; David Saff &lt;saff@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hans,\n&gt;\n&gt; There may be ways to do what you want. I&#39;d like to be sure I know\n&gt; what that is, though. It sounds like you&#39;d like to use JUnit 4 to run\n&gt; JUnit 3 tests, but having the @Ignore annotation observed. Is this\n&gt; true? Are there other features you&#39;d like to be able to use? Thanks,\n&gt;\n&gt; David Saff\n&gt;\n&gt; On 1/23/07, hans_schwaebli &lt;hans_schwaebli@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Our old JUnit tests are written for JUnit 3.8.1.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; They first extended TestCase. After we introduced JMock, all our\n&gt; &gt; TestCases extend MockObjectTestCase.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; This is because we extend from our own JUnit test helper class which\n&gt; &gt; extends from MockObjectTestCase.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Now we use the .jar file from JUnit 4.2 and JMock 1.1.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; But only if we write new tests, which don&#39;t extend MockObjectTestCase\n&gt; &gt; and TestCase and insert the method below for Eclipse 3.1.2, the tests\n&gt; &gt; are run as JUnit 4 tests. Otherwise they are run as JUnit 3 tests.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; public static junit.framework.Test suite()\n&gt; &gt; {\n&gt; &gt; return new JUnit4TestAdapter(MyTest.class);\n&gt; &gt; }\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; It would be much work to refactor our old test. I thought it would be\n&gt; &gt; easy to use the new JUnit 4 features on them like @Ignore.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Why are our tests always run as JUnit 3 tests if they extend from\n&gt; &gt; TestCase? Does anyone has a solution for us for using the new JUnit 4\n&gt; &gt; features without refactoring our tests very much?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
