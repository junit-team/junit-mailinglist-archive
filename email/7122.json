I think my process is good because I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; need to consider whether an interface I&#39;m developing now will be<br/>\n&gt; workable in the future; I just need to get it to work with what I need<br/>\n&gt; now--a much simpler and faster job--and leave it at that. And it&#39;s good<br/>\n&gt; for my code because it keeps my code smaller, more easily modifiable,<br/>\n&gt; and less likely to have bugs.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf change is necessary then it is necessary, but in general it is better to<br/>\ndesign something right the first time rather than designing something just<br/>\ngood enough to get it to work, then having to cosntantly change it because<br/>\nyou didn&#39;t plan the interface or design well.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think we are talking past each other - or at least I hope so. I have<br/>\nworked on a lot of legacy code that was designed with the &quot;I just need to<br/>\nget it to work&quot; attitude and it was a nightmare to debug, extend, maintain<br/>\nand refactor. When I work on such code I often wind up throwing it out and<br/>\nwriting it over from scratch - if I am allowed to.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a continuim ranging from writing sloppy code to writing code by<br/>\ncommittee and virtually unchangeable specification. Neither extreme is<br/>\ndesireable in today&#39;s world, but in general interfaces should be designed<br/>\nwith care, an eye for reuse and the future - and after an initial period of<br/>\ndiscovery should settle down to be relatively stable and unchanging.<br/>\nRefactoring can then go on mostly behind the facade of the interface - at<br/>\nthe implementation level where the real work is done.<br/>\n<br/>\nConstantly changing interfaces are code smells; they smell of poor<br/>\nencapsulation and exposure of things that should be hidden behind the<br/>\ninterface. They smell of poor design consideration with regards to reuse.<br/>\nThey smell of a bad impedance mismatch between various units.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn short, I assert that a well designed interface should not have to change<br/>\nvery often or very much. If you want to go down that old road of constantly<br/>\nrewriting and redesigning code under the guise of being &quot;agile&quot; then that is<br/>\nyour right. I&#39;ve BTDT and I prefer to spend a little bit extra time up front<br/>\ncreating a good design that doesn&#39;t need costant refactoring - in the long<br/>\nrun that has worked much better for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo each their own.<br/>\n<br/>\nFWIW,<br/>\nLauren<br/>\n<br/>\n=====<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://developerdude.mystarband.net\">http://developerdude.mystarband.net</a> </span></blockquote></div>",
