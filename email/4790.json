JUnit instantiates new object of TestCase for <br/>\nevery method (when TestSuite.addTestCase() is called), which results <br/>\nin a) a lot of objects being newed, and b) setUp() and tearDown() <br/>\nmethods called every time test method is invoked. During my work with <br/>\nAPI testing I notices that a) it is more modular to write one test <br/>\nclass per one tested class, where test class includes multiple test <br/>\nmethods; In this case I need to instantiate app container (which <br/>\nwould be set up) only once, before I start running multiple test <br/>\nclasses. Objects created in &quot;set up&quot; are shared by test classes, and <br/>\ndon&#39;t need to be created every time test method is called. I <br/>\nunderstand that decision to instantiate TestClass for every test <br/>\nmethod was stipulated by some rational of design, I am trying to <br/>\nunderstand what this rational is?</div>",
