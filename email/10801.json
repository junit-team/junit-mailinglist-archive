If #3 is very slow, then consider extracting an <br/>\n&gt; interface and doing #1. Do not do #2, since that is testing two things <br/>\n&gt; at once, and that will make you feel pain.

In the context of my current application I<br/>\ndon&#39;t think there would (ever?) be much pain in this process - because these<br/>\nobjects (in the production code) can not come into existence any other way,<br/>\nconsequently their serialisation/deserialisation code is one of the first<br/>\nthings to be tested and is executed pretty thoroughly.  However in other<br/>\nprojects...<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you.</div>",
