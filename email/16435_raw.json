B. Rainsberger&quot; &lt;jbrains@...&gt; wro=\r\nte:\n&gt; Still, there&#39;s a flipside to the whole &quot;can&#39;t generate a method stub&quot;=\r\n \n&gt; argument. With EasyMock, if I use a faked or mocked method that doesn&#39;t=\r\n \n&gt; yet exist, my test can&#39;t even compile yet! \n\nThat makes a lot of sense,=\r\n since Java is typed at compile time.\nAnd every modern IDE generates the me=\r\nthod automatically,\nwith matching parameter types and return type.\n\n&gt; When =\r\nI practise TDD, I often \n&gt; design interfaces, and forcing me to generate a =\r\nmethod stub for a method \n&gt; I might not even like yet is annoying. Keeping =\r\nthe methods as strings \n&gt; allows me to write the test, compile it, and even=\r\n run it before I decide \n&gt; whether the interface or method signature is goo=\r\nd enough to start \n&gt; putting into stone.\n\n1) With that method, you never se=\r\ne the method \n    as a real method call as in EasyMock. Compare \n\ncontrol.e=\r\nxpectAndReturn(mock.copy(destination, source), true);   // EasyMock 1.2\n\nex=\r\npect(mock.copy(destination, source)).andReturn(true); // EasyMock 2.0 / 2.1=\r\n\n\nto \n\nmock.expects(once()).method(&quot;copy&quot;).with( eq(destination), eq(source=\r\n) ).will(returnValue\n(true)); // JMock\n\nIn the EasyMock examples, both show=\r\n how the method \nis used copy(destination, source) and returning true.\nIt i=\r\ns easy to see that the parameters should be reordered,\nand with refactoring=\r\n-tools, it&#39;s quite fast.\n\nIn the JMock example, it is not that easy to spot=\r\n the method call, because\nthe method name is in a string, and the parameter=\r\ns are separated from this string.\nIt is harder to see that the parameters s=\r\nhould be reordered,\nand as refactoring tools don&#39;t work, it&#39;s a pain - espe=\r\ncially if\nthe method is used more than once already in the tests, you have =\r\nto change\nevery single ocurrence by hand.\n\n2) Can you explain on how you te=\r\nst-drive a plain old java method then,\nwithout adding a body for it?\n\n\n-\nTa=\r\nmmo Freese\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
