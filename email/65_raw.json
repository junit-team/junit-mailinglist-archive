Just think of all those\n&quot;thin-clients&quot; out that that require a browser weighing in\nat about 17 meg in memory :-)\n\nI would say I lean more to the &quot;it should be simple enough to do the job but\nno simpler&quot; world view.\nMy dividing line on that hovers around 50%. If it turns out that 50% the\ntypical users\nhave coded up some equivalent set of file comparison code sometime in their\nlife than\nit should probably be included. Of course, it doesn&#39;t have to be included as\npart of the TestCase class\nit could be in a subclass like StreamOutputTestCase, etc.\n\nOf course, now that I know what&#39;s going on, I will probably code up some\nequivalent and\ntry submitting it to the Junit maintainers\n\nThanks,\n\tJim JM\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Andreas Heilwagen [mailto:andreas.heilwagen@...]\nSent: Tuesday, November 28, 2000 5:07 PM\nTo: junit@egroups.com\nSubject: Re: [junit] Test File Output comparison : Should probably be an\nFAQ but I didn&#39;t see it so....\n\n\nI think JUnit* should be kept light, perhaps with plug-ins. If you\ninclude all nice-to-have options a lot of people won&#39;t like it any\nmore because it gets complicated.\n\nJim Jackl-Mochel wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks Erik,\n&gt;         I am suprised that this (and equivalent tests for binary files)\nhasn&#39;t\n&gt; become\n&gt; a part of one of the base classes. Does anyone know why (time, philosophy,\n&gt; etc ) ?\n&gt;\n&gt; One of the most common situations for me in testing tools is the need to\n&gt; test a given file output against a canonical output file.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks again,\n&gt;         Jim JM\n&gt;\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Erik [mailto:emeade@...]\n&gt; Sent: Monday, November 27, 2000 7:51 PM\n&gt; To: junit@egroups.com\n&gt; Subject: RE: [junit] Test File Output comparison : Should probably be an\n&gt; FAQ but I didn&#39;t see it so....\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; &gt; From: Jim Jackl-Mochel [mailto:jmochel@...]\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Monday, November 27, 2000 11:18 AM\n&gt; &gt; To: JUnit List\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [junit] Test File Output comparison : Should probably be an FAQ\n&gt; &gt; but I didn&#39;t see it so....\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I was wondering if anyone has coded up an test case base class that\nallows\n&gt; &gt; for file comparisons of output files ?
