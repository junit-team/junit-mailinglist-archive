Perhaps you should complain to the management.\n\nYou got one thoughtful, articulate response.  Since you did not send a \nfollow up with any more detailed response, it is natural for the group to \nassume that this resolved the issue for you.\n\nAt 03:24 PM 12/27/2001 +0000, you wrote:\n&gt;Would someone please take a look at a posting from me on the JUNIT group a \n&gt;two days ago.\n&gt;It concerns how to test a method that uses jOptionPane.  I got one reply.\n&gt;\n&gt;In the meantime, what else got a response?  Well, we seem to have time to \n&gt;respond to trivial subjects and partake\n&gt;in what is nothing short of mental masturbation and ignore substantive \n&gt;questions that require some effort.\n&gt;I think I have read about 30 messages about getters and setters that \n&gt;sounds more like a pissing contest.  And then there is the chatter about \n&gt;one piece of spam.  How many worthless messages did this &quot;spam&quot; \n&gt;generate?  Boy we nailed that one didn&#39;t we?\n&gt;\n&gt;If you need someone to chat with, get a dog.  I got one, he just doesn&#39;t \n&gt;know java/junit...yet.\n&gt;\n&gt;Sorry for the vent but I grow tired of groping in the dark.\n&gt;\n&gt;Thanks for your help.\n&gt;\n&gt;Lee Chalupa\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt;junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Your use of Yahoo!
