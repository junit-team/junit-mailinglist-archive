Should test scenarios for A or B cover what may <br/>\n&gt; happen in C ? If so, is it just accepted as a code management <br/>\n&gt; overhead to ensure that C is properly tested via tests for A or B ?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Was the class in question designed through the application of TDD?  If so,<br/>\nwhat is C doing that is extra to what A and B need, and therefore covered by<br/>\ntheir tests?<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope you can forgive me the extravagance of quoting myself from last<br/>\nmonth:<br/>\n<br/>\nTest First means that very few of my methods are private, and I really don&#39;t<br/>\nsee this as a bad thing.  (Most of the ones that are private are there only<br/>\nbecause that&#39;s what Eclipses&#39; Extract Method refactoring does).<br/>\n<br/>\nNB:  That is not the same as making private methods public for testing<br/>\npurposes.  That should be avoided at all costs.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards,<br/>\nShaun.</div>",
