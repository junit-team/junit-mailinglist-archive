I was just given a <br/>\nresearch project on how to do both unit testing and load testing of <br/>\nEJB. They told me to explore the possibility of using JUnit to unit <br/>\ntest EJB.<br/>\n<br/>\nI must say that I am still pretty new at this EJB, tomcat, and <br/>\nJUnit. my previous programming experience has been java IO,applet, <br/>\nswing, and some servlet.<br/>\n<br/>\nCan any of you guys give a pointer on where is the best place to <br/>\nstart looking for simple sample codes to run and play with ? I look <br/>\ninto jakarta.cactus website, but they don;t offer step by step <br/>\ninstructions on how to begin testing ejb. I don&#39;t even know how to <br/>\npack EAR, WAR, or jar file. <br/>\n<br/>\nany help would be greatly appreciated</div>",
