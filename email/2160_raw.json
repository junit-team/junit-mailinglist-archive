It is critical to ensure that your tests \ndo something interesting, otherwise the numbers simply give you false \nsecurity.\n\nCertainly, at some point, as a developer, you have to think. Test-first \nprogramming merely makes that thinking more effective, by concentrating on \ncoding the expected behavior of a class, then worrying about the details of \nhow to make the class beahve that way. If you write tests without thinking, \nyou&#39;re doomed, whether JUnit counts assertions or not.\n\nIf you want to count assertions, then be my guest. TestCase extends Assert, \nso nothing stops you from creating class MyTestCase that extends TestCase \nand overrides assertTrue() to do the counting. It does not need to be in the \nframework or even a standard extension.\n\nYou could also use something like JesTer, which changes your code and \nexpects tests to fail. It can either identify code not tested (so either \ntest it or remove it) or pointless tests (so either fix it or remove it).\n\nDo whatever makes sense for you, but don&#39;t get bogged down in counting \nassertions for the sake of counting assertions. For the most part, people on \nthis list have insisted that the number, on its own, is largely meaningless. \nMike has pointed out a situation in which it has great meaning. I hope we \nall read that and thought about it.\n\nSimply: do what makes sense. Think. Share your ideas. Listen to \nalternatives. Don&#39;t be so quick to change JUnit, though -- it didn&#39;t develop \novernight, you know. :)\n\nJBR.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp\n\n\n",
