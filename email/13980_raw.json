As another design goal for JUnit 4, I&#39;d recommend making \nit easy for IDE support developers and test flavor developers as\nwell as for test developers.  That means getting IDE&#39;s out of the\nbusiness of running tests directly.\n\nIn nearly every job I encounter pressure to make tests runnable\nunder JUnit because of the pervasive IDE and build support \nJUnit enjoys.  Because of the assumptions about test classes and\ntests being methods, I&#39;ve even had to generate classes using \nbytecode toolkits to trick the harness into working.  And using\nany variant of test generation entails enforcing code standards \nabout what happens in static suite() methods.  \n\nI understand that you&#39;re really only concerned with making things\neasier for the test developer, but at this point with JUnit being\nthe de facto standard, making it easier for domain-specific test\nflavors to run as JUnit tests would probably increase the amount\nof testing that gets done.\n\nYou&#39;ve already asked for a concrete proposal for an API for\ndynamically generated tests (fair enough), but I wanted to check\nwhether you really did want to be in the business of creating\nAPI layers for IDE/test runner support and test-flavor developers.\nYou already have the layers, but they&#39;re not orthogonal because\nof shared assumptions about test identifiers, tests as methods, etc.\n\nIn process order:\n\n- {Harness}: to gather test specifications, direct and track testing\n  (IDE/Ant/... support developer, command-line test deployer)\n  Without this, IDE&#39;s assume a flavor of test, the JUnit one.\n\n- {TestGatherer}: to select and order tests \n  (test deployer as user, test flavor developer as provider)\n  Without this, harness has to make test-flavor-specific assumptions\n  about test attributes/metadata and suite composition.\n\n- TestRunner/Test: to create and run each test\n  (test developer as user, test flavor developer as provider)\n  Where different flavors of tests can be adapted.\n\n- Test/TestCase: for each flavor of test \n  (test developer)\n  Here&#39;s where the JUnit model (test == Method) is but one.\n\nOne harness I&#39;ve developed is in open source in the AspectJ tree.  It\nconcretizes some abstractions that might be relevant:\n\n- Test specification: this describes a test (for harness selection,\npreflight, and display), and can be used by a factory to create the\ntest.  Among other things, you can create data- or\nspecification-driven tests and need only create one test at a time,\nwhich makes it easier to have suites with thousands of generated\ntests.  \n\n- Test identifier: In the AspectJ tree, we use the test title as a\ntest identifier for identifying fixes (failed, now pass) or\nregressions (passed, now fail).  This would have to be a first-class\nabstraction to avoid knowing too much about test flavors.  (When\ngenerating tests I found it hard to map data-driven identifiers to\nmethod names in generated classes.  And assuming that all tests \nare always passing results in failing-test limbo: ignored\nby comment or annotation, rather than being visible and managed.)\n\n- A test run is a composite test composed of sub-runs.  The\ndistinction between &quot;suite&quot; and &quot;test&quot; is collapsed.  It makes it easy\nto write standard test flavors.  For the AspectJ domain, runs are\nthings like compile, weave, and run, and tests are composed of these\nsteps.  Put another way, it&#39;s tests all the way down (rather than\nsuite{, suite..}, test.., assert..).  This is also where\ndecorators can work, since a parent can act as around advice.\n\n- Messages are associated with each run, and are ways to pass signals\naround.  The default behavior can be like JUnit asserts (abort on fail\nmessage), but the more useful behavior is for the parent to interpret\nexpected and actual messages.  This makes it easier to reuse steps\n(e.g., database lookup - normal; database lookup (broken pipe)), and\nto have endemic logging.  (One critique I have of JUnit is that it\nassumes the developer is evaluating a test failure and can re-run the\ntest (or that the stack trace is sufficient); messages make it easy\nfor another developer or for build folks to identify things like setup\nfailures.)\n\n- keywords are simply text associated with a test (cf JavaTest). \nThese make it very easy to self-name and anoint tests, and to select\ntests based on unions, intersections, etc.  Annotations can be one\nsource for these. \n\n- Sandbox is a place for temporary junk, encoding good TDD practice.\n(In the AspectJ harness it also provides shared state, so, e.g., the\ncompiler can set the classpath used when running the class). \nHowever...)\n\n(This is by no means to say the AspectJ harness is a model for JUnit;\nit&#39;s feature-driven and not for general use.)\n\nTwo other things not in the harness:\n\n- World (in the weaver). For expressly-shared state.  \n\n- a thread&#39;s current messages, sandbox, test (i.e., chain of tests),\nand world might all be accessible via a threadlocal, so IDE/harnesses\ncan provide real-time or snapshot information.  Elsewhere I&#39;ve called\nvariants of this the test context.\n\nThis is  a more ambitious project than upgrading JUnit to simplify \nthe test developer&#39;s work using annotations and static imports, so\nI&#39;m assuming you&#39;re not interested in all of it, but might be \ninterested in concrete/code proposals for categories/keywords and\nfactories.  However, I figured now&#39;s the time to ask!\n\nWes\n\n\n\n\n\n",
