As long as times is greater than -1 it is ok and<br/>\nwhen a method call with these  parameters is intercepted the call is<br/>\nforwarded to the underlying implementation of the method.<br/>\n<br/>\n         startVerification();<br/>\n         // lets start verifying what we setUp<br/>\n<br/>\n         cut.myRecursiveMethod(4);<br/>\n    }<br/>\n<br/>\n}<br/>\n<br/>\nI have never written a test like this and I don&#39;t think I will in the<br/>\nfuture either, this is purely for fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I have done though is to use itercept to extend AbstractClasses<br/>\nto verify the abstract classes contracts. What I have used it even<br/>\nmore for is to verify that streams, readers, writers that I pass to<br/>\nclasses I test are closed (or not closed) as expected (or similar<br/>\nsituations).<br/>\n<br/>\nHope it was at least almost as fun reading the example as it was for<br/>\nme writing it. I have not run the test though so I don&#39;t know if it<br/>\nfails, would be pretty embarassing if it looped more/fewer times than<br/>\nI expected :P<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards<br/>\nJoakim Ohlrogge<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\namine achergui wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Is there any test pattern to test a recursive method ( in my case,<br/>\n&gt; the method&#39;s body calls  collaborators thus in the test method i use mocks).<br/>\n&gt; Is there any pattern or recipe to solve this?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>So you have a method that wants to invoke itself, and you&#39;d like to mock<br/>\n  the call to itself.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn this case, ignore the method being repetitively recursive, because by<br/>\nputting a mock in there, you&#39;re ensuring that the method will only call<br/>\nitself one. (The mock won&#39;t invoke itself any more than that.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for a method invoking itself, there&#39;s no direct way to mock the<br/>\ninvocation. Some basic reasoning should make that clear: if the method<br/>\nis mocked, then it wouldn&#39;t invoke itself. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI have thought about this in the abstract before, and don&#39;t have an<br/>\nanswer, except to point out that I&#39;ve never wanted to do this. There<br/>\nmust be a reason for that, and I hope it&#39;s a good one. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nCan you tell us what this method does? Perhaps that will shed some light<br/>\non what to do.<br/>\n--<br/>\nJ.
