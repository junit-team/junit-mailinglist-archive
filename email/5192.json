Actually<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; [...] if a method has advertised<br/>\n&gt; &gt; an exception in its throws clause, a caller can anticipate that it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; could happen, catch it, and call the outcome a failure.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I think Java&#39;s checked exceptions are evil, so I don&#39;t bother. If it ain&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; the right exception, then the production code is barfing. Barfing is an<br/>\n&gt; error -- different from, say, answering 10 instead of 8.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>what about mixed language environment? I mean CORBA / Java or something like<br/>\nthis... CORBA exceptions should be proccessed in Java, catched.... so I<br/>\nthink checked exceptions are better, they AWARE programmers of majority of<br/>\npossible exception. They are part of method contracts. I FLAME :+)<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; (For those interested in arguing about checked exceptions, first please<br/>\n </span></blockquote>read<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?CheckedExceptionsAreOfDubiousValue.)\">http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?CheckedExceptionsAreOfDubiousValue.)</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; [...]  any other<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;unanticipated&quot; exception would then be an error.  but in practice,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it probably doesn&#39;t matter whether the throwing of the wrong<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;advertised&quot; exception should signal failure or error.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Indeed. It may be impossible to tell, or at least too much work to tell,<br/>\n&gt; whether the problem was within or outside of your control. Better to hedge<br/>\n&gt; your bets unless you have a good reason to do otherwise. Cheaper, you<br/>\n </span></blockquote>know.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; i was trying to use the exception example as a starting point for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; discussion about whether failure/error distinctions in junit are<br/>\n&gt; &gt; meaningful to anyone.  my experience has been that they are not--<br/>\n&gt; &gt; in either case, failure or error, you&#39;re led in the direction of a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; solution.  what do you all think?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It depends on the context. When the code I&#39;m testing does not throw its<br/>\n </span></blockquote>own<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; exceptions, then an error is almost always either a bug in the test or a<br/>\n </span></blockquote>non-<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; recoverable problem. When the code I&#39;m testing throws its own exceptions,<br/>\n&gt; then an error could be a bunch of different things. I suppose that, in a<br/>\n&gt; narrow context, errors are useful, but I don&#39;t really distinguish. The<br/>\n </span></blockquote>nice<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; thing about errors, though, is that they prompt me to look beyond my code<br/>\n </span></blockquote>and<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; my test for the problem. Maybe the disk is full. Maybe the network is<br/>\n </span></blockquote>down.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Maybe there&#39;s an eclipse of the sun. An error often makes me think harder<br/>\n&gt; about where the problem might be. That&#39;s usually good.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; this, too, the failure/error distinction and whether it matters, may<br/>\n&gt; &gt; be a good FAQ item too?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Mike?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; J.
