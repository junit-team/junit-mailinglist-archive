I loo=\r\nked through the JUnit FAQ, and found this:\nhttp://junit.sourceforge.net/doc=\r\n/faq/faq.htm#organize_1\n...which describes having parallel source folders w=\r\nithin the same project -- one for main code, and one for test code. But not=\r\nhing found about having separate projects.\n\nI see the following advantages =\r\nin having a separate Eclipse project for the JUnit tests:\n\n1) The ability t=\r\no set your project-specific settings for your test project to something oth=\r\ner than what is set for the main project. Not all project settings are avai=\r\nlable in the runtime configs (such as builder configurations), and so movin=\r\ng the test code to a separate project would allow for setting whatever test=\r\n-specific project settings are desired. The main project can be added as a =\r\nproject dependency of the test project, and so the parallel source dirs des=\r\nign can still exist and the test project can continue to access all of the =\r\nmain project&#39;s code.\n\n2) Reduced risk in having your main code accidentally=\r\n depend on a test (not likely to happen, but possible with single project).=\r\n\n\n3) Reduced risk in accidentally shipping test-specific jars with your pro=\r\nduction code.\n\n4) The freedom to add any version of a lib that you need for=\r\n your tests. For example, let&#39;s say that your main code depends on google-c=\r\nollections-0.9.jar. And your tests can benefit from some new method introdu=\r\nced in a new version -- google-collection-1.0.jar. So, you&#39;d like to use v1=\r\n.0 with your test code but don&#39;t want to touch the main code&#39;s libs. If you=\r\n have a separate test project, then that&#39;s not a problem -- you just add v1=\r\n.0 to the test project&#39;s lib dir. But if you have a single main project tha=\r\nt includes your test code, then your either stuck with v0.9 -- or you&#39;ll ha=\r\nve to use a custom classloader to load your entire test code (and the test-=\r\nspecific libs) so that you can load v1.0 and not v0.9.\n\n\nI&#39;d say that the s=\r\neparate-project-option would do well when needing test-specific project set=\r\ntings and with dealing with transitive dependencies.\n\nFor the disadvantages=\r\n of having a separate project, I can&#39;t think of any besides:\n1) Having one =\r\nmore project to maintain. Is that really a disadvantage, though? Maybe.\n\nCa=\r\nn you list any other disadvantages?\n\nMaybe a more fundamental question is: =\r\nShould an eclipse project that contains your production code (and jars used=\r\n by your production code at runtime) also contain non-production code (eg, =\r\ntest code and test-specific jars) or should non-production code+artifacts b=\r\ne placed in a separate Eclipse project while still maintaining a parallel d=\r\nir structure for tests?\n\nI welcome all your thoughts! Thank you.\n\nCheers,\nW=\r\nill\n\n\n",
