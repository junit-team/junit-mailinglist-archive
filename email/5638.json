    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1976416159\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt; Differentiating between completely standalone tests (eg StingUtility <br/>\n&gt; classes) or requires a test environment (eg database, file structure) <br/>\n&gt; would be terrific, especially with the Ant junit batchtest structure, <br/>\n&gt; where Ant works its way through the code and finds Tester classes to <br/>\n&gt; run.  It doesn&#39;t have any way of knowing the environment that it&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; running in, or the environment that the test needs.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I prefer the idea of well designed code that makes it easy to substitute<br/>\nthe /environment/ for a MockObject &lt;www.mockobjects.com&gt; instead.  This,<br/>\nIMHO, is the true nature of *unit* tests.  What you want to know is that<br/>\nyour code responds to the environment in the expected way.<br/>\n<br/>\nThus you create mock objets for a faulty database: method call throws<br/>\nexception; a normal db call: the method returns a valid response; etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis gives you complete control over the responses you expect from the<br/>\nenvironment, and allow you to test your code under expected conditions.<br/>\nIt also means that your unit test suite will be a lot faster.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is also a place for functional or acceptance tests.  These tests,<br/>\nlike integrations tests, would be used to test that the different<br/>\ncomponents work as expected when put together.  If these tests take<br/>\nlonger to run, you could schedule them to run once every evening, or<br/>\nonce a week over the weekend, while running the quicker performing unit<br/>\ntests every time you think of checking some code into Source/Version<br/>\ncontrol.<br/>\n<br/>\nManuel Amago.<br/>\nmailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mamago@...\">mamago@...</a></div>",
