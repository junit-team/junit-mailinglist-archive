That is, if for example one thing you need to parse is a \ncolor specification, extract that logic into a ColorParser. That makes \nit both easier to test in isolation, easier to read and maintain and \nmore reusable.\n\nDoes that help?\n\nCheers, Ilja\n\nsunburned.surveyor wrote:\n&gt; I&#39;m still rather new to JUnit (although I&#39;ve purchased at least two \n&gt; (2) JUnit books)and I&#39;m finally getting around to actually using unit \n&gt; tests for my code.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve ran into a puzzling situation, and I&#39;m looking for suggestions \n&gt; on how to [1] properly test code using JUnit or [2] refactor my code \n&gt; so that it can be tested.\n&gt; \n&gt; The class in question parses a fairly complex text file and \n&gt; constructs a single Java object from it. There is a single public \n&gt; parse method that returns an instance of this object. Inside this \n&gt; public parse method several private helper methods are called. \n&gt; Basically the job of the public method is to call the private helper \n&gt; methods in the correct sequence, based on the contents of the file \n&gt; being parsed.\n&gt; \n&gt; Here is my question: I want to verify that the logic in parts of \n&gt; these private helper methods does what I intend. Although I know a \n&gt; failure of any of these &quot;logic parts&quot; in a private helper method \n&gt; would be reflected in a failure of the public method. However, I want \n&gt; to pinpoint which of the &quot;logic parts&quot; failing.\n&gt; \n&gt; Have I left the realm of unit testing and moved on to some type of \n&gt; functional testing? Do I need to refactor these &quot;logic parts&quot; into \n&gt; their own private methods, and then use a framework like JUnitX to \n&gt; test these private methods? Do I write some beanshell scripts that \n&gt; test this logic instead?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks for any suggestions on how to proceed. I know this problem is \n&gt; due to my lack of experience with software testing, and is not a \n&gt; problem with JUnit.\n&gt; \n&gt; The Sunburned Surveyor\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
