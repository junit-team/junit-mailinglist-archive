In EasyMock 2, matchers can be defined<br/>\ndirectly in the method calls, allowing to ignore arguments,<br/>\nmatch only parts of an argument, and so on. <br/>\nYou may even define your own matchers.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 3. Its support for complex parameter, method or invocation matching is <br/>\n&gt; great.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>EasyMock 2 has much better support for that. Argument matchers<br/>\nare in my opinion better. Inter-mock dependencies can be defined.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If there is ever a 2nd edition of _JUnit Recipes_, I will replace all <br/>\n&gt; the EasyMock example code with jMock.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>As the author of EasyMock, I am sad to hear that.<br/>\nCan you elaborate which features are missing in <br/>\nEasyMock 2 that are so crucial that you consider switching?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The people who don&#39;t like jMock often say it&#39;s because declaring the <br/>\n&gt; method names as strings makes refactoring more error-prone. That might <br/>\n&gt; be the case, but I have never felt pain as a result of it.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It&#39;s not only a problem when renaming methods. <br/>\n<br/>\nReordering, adding, or removing parameters all break tests at runtime, <br/>\nand you have to adapt them manually to the new situation. <br/>\nTests using EasyMock work after reordering and removing<br/>\nparameters, and after adding parameters if no matchers were used.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd there is also the issue of code completion when defining expectations.<br/>\nWith JMock, it does not work, you have to rely on text completion features.<br/>\nWith EasyMock, it works like a charm.<br/>\n<br/>\n-<br/>\nTammo Freese</div>",
