I got one reply.\n\nIn the meantime, what else got a response?  Well, we seem to have time to respond to trivial subjects and partake\nin what is nothing short of mental masturbation and ignore substantive questions that require some effort.\nI think I have read about 30 messages about getters and setters that sounds more like a pissing contest.  And then there is the chatter about one piece of spam.  How many worthless messages did this &quot;spam&quot; generate?  Boy we nailed that one didn&#39;t we?\n\nIf you need someone to chat with, get a dog.  I got one, he just doesn&#39;t know java/junit...yet.\n\nSorry for the vent but I grow tired of groping in the dark.\n\nThanks for your help.\n\nLee Chalupa\n\n\n\n",
