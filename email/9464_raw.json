One way to do that would be to present a \nlittle code that one thinks is down to minimum comments, and see what \nothers can do with it to make it need fewer.\n\nThis may not be the forum for that. If so, then without getting down \nto cases, I think I&#39;m with Jim on letting the thread die, even though \nI do get the sense that there&#39;s something to be learned here.\n\nRegards,\n\n\n",
