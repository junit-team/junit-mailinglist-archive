I&#39;ve done the same thing in many production systems,<br/>\nand I rarely test it.<br/>\n<br/>\nNote that Kent Beck says, right in the first page or two of his chapter<br/>\non testing in _Extreme Programming Explained_, you should not write<br/>\ntests for things that seem simple and unlikely to break. (I&#39;d quote it,<br/>\nbut I&#39;m at home right now and the book is at work.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI see this an example of such a situation.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; Err...if you&#39;re creating new classes for the mock objects, aren&#39;t you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; adding extra code just for testability?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sort of -- but test code that doesn&#39;t have to ship with the product, and<br/>\n&gt; which is completely decoupled from the design and implementation of the<br/>\n&gt; product, unlike test code added to the class itself.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My concern is not about shipping it with the product; my concern is<br/>\nthat, whether it ships or not, it&#39;s extra code to write and maintain.<br/>\nThat&#39;s extra cost. The question is, are you likely to get more from that<br/>\ninvestment than you spend on it?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It doesn&#39;t have to much work at all if you use an IDE like Eclipse and/or a<br/>\n&gt; tool like Mockmaker (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.mockmaker.org/)\">http://www.mockmaker.org/)</a>.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Right. But it&#39;s still more than no work at all.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I am debating the general principle of whether one should modify<br/>\n&gt; implementation code to make it testable, and you&#39;re talking about<br/>\n&gt; particular cases *when* it might be better. I can&#39;t argue with that.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, I saw it, perhaps incorrectly, as you saying &quot;there is never<br/>\na case where it&#39;s better to modify implementation code to make it<br/>\ntestable,&quot; and I presented a single case that I thought disproved this<br/>\nstatement. (At the very least, it does for me. I guess it&#39;s a matter of<br/>\nopinion whether or not it does for others.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Would we both agree that the best possible solution would be to avoid<br/>\n&gt; the problem altogether by doing test driven development?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I wouldn&#39;t, because it was test-driven development that drove me to the<br/>\nabove solution in the first place. I thought, &quot;Darn, to test this I&#39;ve<br/>\ngot to make another mock object here, and pass it a database connection.<br/>\nWhy not just pass in the connection directly, and save myself the effort?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\ncjs<br/>\n-- <br/>\nCurt Sampson  &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cjs@...\">cjs@...</a>&gt;   +81 90 7737 2974   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.netbsd.org\">http://www.netbsd.org</a><br/>\n    Don&#39;t you know, in this new Dark Age, we&#39;re all light.  --XTC</div>",
