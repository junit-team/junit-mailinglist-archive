I tend to use this class to set up and clean up\ndatabases, and can see the value of doing it both ways.\n\nLooks like some people are saying this isn&#39;t a problem at all, on\nanother thread. I&#39;ll run my tests to see if they&#39;re right.\n\nDave\n\n&gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; &gt; From: dfw1@c...
