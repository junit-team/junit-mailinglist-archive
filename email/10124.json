Sometimes, this situation can be <br/>\ntime-dependent.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, if your test machine is on local time, and your database <br/>\nserver is on GMT, and you try to compare dates, you can get an <br/>\nintermittent failure.  This is because there is a window each day where <br/>\nthe dates are different.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr, it could be thread-related.  Some rare condition that depends on the <br/>\nunderlying OS threading model, that only occurred in certain conditions.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust some ideas.  If you do ever figure it out, please post to the list. <br/>\n  I&#39;d be interested to know what it was.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Chad<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; David Corbin wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt;I&#39;ve got one tests which fails sporadically, and I cannot figure out any <br/>\n&gt;&gt;reason for it to be non-deterministic in MY code.
