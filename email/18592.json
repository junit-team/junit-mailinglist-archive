Instead, talk about what<br/>\n&gt; &gt; you are doing: automatic test generation. If you take a look at<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Agitar&#39;s marketing material<br/>\n&gt; &gt; (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.agitar.com/solutions/business/create_junit_tests.html)\">http://www.agitar.com/solutions/business/create_junit_tests.html)</a>,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; they&#39;re not talking about TDD either--because automatic test<br/>\n&gt; &gt; generation and TDD are simply two unrelated things.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In fact the German marketing material once mentioned TDD, which made<br/>\n&gt; them lose a lot of credibility in my eyes...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Which is why they don&#39;t say that any more.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut for people who don&#39;t practice TDD this is a difficult distinction:<br/>\n if you have a failing test before you write the code, why isn&#39;t that<br/>\nenough to be TDD?<br/>\n<br/>\nI *think* what Jimm is talking about doing is generating a test from<br/>\nthe comment before the implementation is written, so you would have a<br/>\nfailing test before the body of the code was there. Similarly our<br/>\n(Agitar) marketing people had the feeling that if our product  would<br/>\nlet you write a failing test in advance of the code that was TDD,<br/>\nright?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe explanation I&#39;ve used is to distinguish between TDD in the small<br/>\n(or test-first) and TDD in the large.<br/>\n<br/>\nI might find a bug, write a failing test for the bug, and the fix the<br/>\nbug.  That&#39;s would be test-first programming  (or TDD in the small).<br/>\nIt&#39;s a good thing to do, but the tests aren&#39;t driving my design.<br/>\n<br/>\nIsn&#39;t trying to make this distinction clearer what drove people to<br/>\nchange the name from Test First Development  --&gt; TDDevelopement --&gt;<br/>\nTDDesign --&gt; BDDesign?
