I would appreciate your <br/>\nindulgence.<br/>\n<br/>\nShould a test case return a success or failure on a method when it throws an <br/>\nexception. Specifically, I have a method that loads environment variables <br/>\nfrom a source file. If the file is not found, the method throws a <br/>\nFileNotFoundException. Now the test case has a try/catch block to trap the <br/>\nexception but should I fail the test if caught.<br/>\n<br/>\nCurrently, my thinking is the test case passes because the method did in <br/>\nfact function correctly. The code is written to throw an error. However, <br/>\nreading the articles on the subject I am confused. Should the test case <br/>\nre-throw the exception? Report a failure? Report a success but output a <br/>\nmessage the test case was inconclusive?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp.\">http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp.</a></div>",
