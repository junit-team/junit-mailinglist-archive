It seems to me that you can do this <br/>\n&gt; kind of<br/>\n&gt; validation in a @BeforeClass in JUnit 4. Would that solve your problem?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Not so easily in this case.  This is a validation that is run before any <br/>\nother test in the AllTests suite, if it fails no other test is run.  You <br/>\nget a single failure, fix the web.xml file and then run again.  In order <br/>\nto get this same behavior in JUnit4 I would have to duplicate the <br/>\n@BeforeClass and @AfterClass annotations into every TestCase.  <br/>\nAnnotations in this sense are really starting to sound like Advices in <br/>\nthe AOP world.<br/>\n<br/>\nSimilarly, we have functional tests that use a type of validation like <br/>\nthe one I mentioned before that connect to a third party WebService and <br/>\ngrab its WSDL (Salesforce.com).  The validation checks the WSDL in the <br/>\nservice against the WSDL we have saved locally.  If they don&#39;t match we <br/>\nknow that we need to regenerate classes from the WSDL.  Since the <br/>\nobjects we are currently working with are now &quot;out of date&quot; running the <br/>\ntests don&#39;t make too much sense, so we throw a failure and refuse to run <br/>\nany other tests.  The developer at that point copies the new WSDL to <br/>\nhis/her local directory, regenerates classes, and runs tests again.  <br/>\nThis is especially important at check-in time so that we know that the <br/>\nHEAD of our CVS branch is generally in line with the WebService -- <br/>\nallowing us to make a build out of HEAD at any time.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I said earlier the @BeforeClass and @AfterClass are too limited in <br/>\ntheir scope to allow for such validations.  Please correct me if I am wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJason Rogers<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I,<br/>\nbut Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in <br/>\nthe flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved <br/>\nme, and gave himself for me.&quot;<br/>\n    Galatians 2:20</div>",
