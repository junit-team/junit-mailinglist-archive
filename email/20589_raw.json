I understand\nthat&#39;s partly what Kent is referring to in his note:\n\n \n\n&quot;Next up, release notes and then out the door!&quot;\n\n \n\nAnything informal at this stage? Is it just around the corner such that\nI should sit tight?\n\n \n\n \n\nHere&#39;s the case we&#39;re interested in. We would like introduce a\nfunctional-test build on our integration server. Something we could run\non a regular basis, but not as part of the integration build. The\ncurrent thinking call for introduction of a custom Runner that\nidentifies functional test based on a custom annotation. Then we can\nco-mingle unit and functional tests, not relying on directory\nsegregation. Does 4.5 have any useful features for this problem? At a\nminimum I&#39;ve picked up that writing a custom Runner will be easier...\n\n \n\nThanks!\n\n \n\nPeter Pascale\n\n\n\n \n\nAll,\n\nFollowing our discussions last week, we have incorporated the old\nJUnit4ClassRunner into 4.5. (The new runner is called\nBlockJUnit4ClassRunner\nbecause it is organized as a &quot;block&quot; of &quot;statements&quot; instead of nested\nprocedures). Those of you who have written custom runners, we&#39;d\nappreciate\nit if you could try out the release candidate to make sure it supports\nyour\nexisting runners.\n\nNext up, release notes and then out the door!\n\nWhew!\n\nKent Beck\nThree Rivers Institute\n\n\n**************************************************************************** \nThis email may contain material confidential to\nPearson.
