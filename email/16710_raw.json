So my question is how do I tell jUnit\n4 to invoke such and such a class/method?\n\nMy initial thought was to extend TestDecorator however my issue is that\nI want this extension of jUnit to work everywhere, including in IDEs\nsuch as Intellij IDEA (the one I&#39;m using, just an example).\n\nIf I take IntelliJ, they appear to be using junit.textui.TestRunner and\nhave defined their own callbacks (for example:\ncom.intellij.rt.junit4.Junit4TestMethodAdapter.run is called by\njunit.framework.TestSuite.runTest)\n\nSo I&#39;m a bit stumped here on how to best implement a jUnit 4 extension\nthat is always invoked whatever the environment (maven, ant, IDE such as\nIntelliJ or Eclipse).\n\nAny help would be appreciated, and I apologize in advance if the\nquestion has already been raised before, but I haven&#39;t found such a\nTopic in this list.\n\nRegards,\n\nCedric.\n\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n\n",
