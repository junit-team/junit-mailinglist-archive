The Ann Arbor division of Tumbleweed Comm. (formerly Interface) used it in all of their L2i code, and continue to use it with every new development.  It is second nature to us now.  If we didn&#39;t have JUnit, I don&#39;t know what we&#39;d do.  It has been a great tool that has saved us tremendously on many occasions!<br/>\n<br/>\n-Jason</div>",
