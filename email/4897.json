We all know how a radio works.  It&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; interface<br/>\n&gt; &gt; is the same no matter where you go--you have a control to <br/>\n&gt; change the <br/>\n&gt; &gt; station and a control to change the volume.  There are several<br/>\n&gt; models<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of the radio, and in a store, there are many instances of each<br/>\n&gt; model.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;[...]<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; You can only really do black box testing in this type of<br/>\n&gt; environment.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; You have the advantage of knowing what the component does.  You<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; know how it does it--and from the perspective of using the <br/>\n&gt; component <br/>\n&gt; &gt; you don&#39;t care.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Yes. But from the perspective of developing the component, you *do* <br/>\n&gt; care. I am sure that radios get white box tested at the plant.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The most important thing is that the component obeys the contracts<br/>\nof its interface.  I do use assertions for the internals of the<br/>\nclass--something that JUnit cannot do.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I have created a test harness using JUnit for my components, so<br/>\n&gt; that I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; can test several component types with one TestCase.  It&#39;s a<br/>\n&gt; beautiful<br/>\n&gt; &gt; thing.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Now, If I tried to write a white-box test on my component, I run<br/>\n&gt; into<br/>\n&gt; &gt; some serious setbacks.  That white-box (or micro test) is tied to<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; component implementation.  I cannot reuse that test on another <br/>\n&gt; &gt; implementation of the same component interface.  That is a serious <br/>\n&gt; &gt; drawback to me.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; A very serious drawback of not adjusting tests to implementation <br/>\n&gt; details is that sufficient tests for one implementation are most <br/>\n&gt; probably insufficient for another. That doesn&#39;t mean that you can&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; reuse them - it&#39;s just that it isn&#39;t safe relying on them.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>True.  However I do not throw away tests--I add them.  As we find more<br/>\nways of breaking the component, we add that test to the component&#39;s<br/>\ntestcase.  That introduces regression testing--and ensures that all<br/>\nimplementations of a component don&#39;t break when a new regression is<br/>\nadded.<br/>\n<br/>\nTwo truths:<br/>\n<br/>\n* You can&#39;t know all the design from the beginning.<br/>\n* You can&#39;t know all the tests from the beginning.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is an iterative process.  As things fail, you add a regression test,<br/>\nthen you fix the problem.  The order is important--write the test before<br/>\nyou fix the problem.</div>",
