This is not unit testing.  This is functional\ntesting that should be done by the QA team.  Although I admit the\nline between unit and functional testing is sometimes blurry.\n\nAn effective approach would be to use a design pattern called Front\nController:  &quot;Centralize view management (navigation, templating,\nsecurity, etc.) for a Web application in a single object that handles\nincoming client requests .&quot;\n\n(http://java.sun.com/j2ee/blueprints/design_patterns/front_controller/index.html).\n\nWith Front Controller you can gut all of your business logic out of\nyour servlets and JSPs.  Your business logic would be contained in\nseparate classes which can be unit tested.\n\nMike\n\n--- Paul Hodgetts &lt;prh@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; We are developing a J2EE-based web application, and we&#39;ve been\n&gt; getting better and better at our testing.  Recently we reached\n&gt; a pain threshold that&#39;s causing us to make a compromise trade\n&gt; off.  Perhaps you folks can offer some suggestions.\n&gt; \n&gt; The developers write unit test for all layers of the system,\n&gt; from the web pages to the smallest methods.  For most tests,\n&gt; we use JUnit and for the web tests we use HTTPUnit.\n&gt; \n&gt; The highest level of the web tests check for the page flow\n&gt; (link navigation) and for page contents.  These tests, written\n&gt; with HTTPUnit, are getting painful.  There is often a lot of\n&gt; set up needed (e.g., putting objects in the right state) to\n&gt; get to the point where the test can execute, as well as a lot\n&gt; of code to log in and navigate to the page where the test can\n&gt; run.  In some cases, the effort to write these tests is a\n&gt; significant percentage of the overall task efforts.\n&gt; \n&gt; Recently, developers have stopped writing these web tests,\n&gt; resorting to running the tests manually by hand.  Their\n&gt; reasoning is that the cost of writing the web tests is not\n&gt; justified by their benefits.  Others point out the issues\n&gt; with manual tests (inconsistent tests, the extra time to run\n&gt; them repeatedly, lack of documentation, etc.), and assert\n&gt; that the tests are worth the admittedly high costs.  We&#39;re\n&gt; having trouble reaching consensus.\n&gt; \n&gt; A related issue is that our QA folks have not been able to\n&gt; provide a suite of automated acceptance tests, which we\n&gt; presume should also test page navigation and contents as page\n&gt; of the user functionality tests.  They use a &quot;big&quot; testing\n&gt; tool (Seque), and we&#39;re not sure if we could use their tests\n&gt; in a day-to-day development environment, if they existed.\n&gt; \n&gt; So, in your opinion, should the developers be writing the web\n&gt; page navigation and contents tests?  IMHO, we should because\n&gt; this stuff can break, unless we can get QA to write them as\n&gt; part of the acceptance tests and we can share the tool to run\n&gt; them in the development environment.\n&gt; \n&gt; If so, should the tests be automated?  IMHO, they should for\n&gt; all the same reasons we automate any tests.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now, what about the cost?  Are there ways to reduce the costs\n&gt; of writing these type of tests?  Are there other tools we\n&gt; could be using?  At XPU, Lisa Crispin recommended WebART as\n&gt; a tool at this level.  I also heard discussion of patterns\n&gt; such as Object Mother for creating objects in a particular\n&gt; state for testing.  Comments here?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks much in advance for any suggestions.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Paul Hodgetts\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nMake international calls for as low as $.04/minute with Yahoo!
