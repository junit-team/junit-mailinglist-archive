Hey, my conclusion could be the right one\n&gt;irrespect=\r\nive.\n&gt;      &gt;;-)\n&gt;\n&gt;      How is that different from what I wrote?\n&gt;\n&gt;You s=\r\naid &quot;hypothesis is false therefore all conclusions are false&quot;, not\n&gt;true. B=\r\nertrand said &quot;hypothesis is false, so all conclusions are provable&quot;.\n&gt;That =\r\ndoesn&#39;t make them all false, nor mine meaningless, just not certain.\n&gt;Mine =\r\nmight&#39;ve been right however I started, perhaps plain luck. :-)\n\nPlease be m=\r\nore careful. This is exactly what I wrote, copied and pasted.\n\n&quot;Since your =\r\nhypothesis is wrong, your conclusion is not meaningful. :) (That&#39;s logic&#39;s =\r\nfault, not mine.)&quot;\n\n&gt;&lt;snip/&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;          Like hell. I&#39;ve proposed a soluti=\r\non to you a number of times.\n&gt;     Why don&#39;t       you  listen to it?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\nI listened, I totally absorbed what you said, I just didn&#39;t buy it. Heck,\n&gt;=\r\nwho knows ... maybe you weren&#39;t right.\n\nWhat didn&#39;t you buy? What I describ=\r\ned is exactly what you need. The only difference is whether you build it an=\r\nd leave it out of the framework or you build it and convince the authors to=\r\n include it in the framework. Either way, it&#39;s your solution to write. :)\n\n=\r\n&gt;I write code, I test my code, I debug my code when tests fail by trying to=\r\n\n&gt;analyse the output. I was hoping for it to be easier to analyse, w/o a lo=\r\nt\n&gt;of manual effort, but I don&#39;t have an itch big enough to attempt to writ=\r\ne\n&gt;such a tool -- especially when it&#39;d be cheap/clean to do it in the\n&gt;fram=\r\nework.\n\nAre you kidding? Cheap/clean?\n\nPlease sketch your solution in the f=\r\nramework so that we can examine how cheap and clean it is. If it is indeed =\r\ncheap and clean, I&#39;ll support it.\n\n&gt; Also, much as I could craft some sort =\r\nof add on (perhaps\n&gt;leverage\n&gt;my own sub-class from TestCase) I think it ne=\r\neds too much of what is in the\n&gt;framework in order to work well, and I don&#39;=\r\nt fancy re-writing the thing.\n\nDon&#39;t think; tell. Sketch the solution. I&#39;ve=\r\n already sketched one; it&#39;s your turn.\n\n&gt;I use eclipse, I use ant -- I like=\r\n the integration into those tools more\n&gt;than I like my idea. If I can&#39;t get=\r\n you to contemplate the concept, then I\n&gt;probably have little chance of per=\r\nsuading them. If they don&#39;t use it, I\n&gt;won&#39;t benefit. Another reason not to=\r\n start.\n\nOnce again, your hypothesis is incorrect. You assume that I didn&#39;t=\r\n consider your suggestion before I decided against it. That&#39;s arrogant.\n\n&gt;T=\r\nhis was my first topic on this mailing list, and much as you were pretty\n&gt;m=\r\neasured/polite (at least at the start) I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be back for\n&gt;more=\r\n.\n\nThat&#39;s a shame.\n\n&gt;Open Source is (IMHO) about open minded discussion of =\r\nideas, and I don&#39;t\n&gt;think I found that here. No worries, have fun w/ what y=\r\nou do.\n\nThat&#39;s your perception. Do you often believe that contrarian positi=\r\nons necessarily come from closed-minded people? or do you grant the possibi=\r\nlity that an open-minded person may consider your point of view, decide on =\r\na different solution and propose it instead?\n\nTake care.\n\n\nJ.
