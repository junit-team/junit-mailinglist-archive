But in my case I would have a lot of &quot;false warnings&quot; because I\nhave a lot of methods that validate something and throw if it&#39;s invalid (but\ndo nothing if valid, so return is void). The tests look like that :\n\npublic void testAValidationTest() throws Exception {\n    validator.validate(VALID_DATA);\n}\n\nSo, no asserts, but a perfectly valid test case.\n\nI would then probably get 200 warnings, so how could I differentiate the\nlegitimate ones from false ones?\n\nIf this feature goes in, it should be possible to turn it on/off, like\nassert counting I guess :)\n\nmathieu\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: Keith Ray\nTo: &#39;junit@yahoogroups.com&#39;\nSent: Friday, July 27, 2001 12:36 PM\nSubject: [junit] re - assert counting\n\n\nAs I said before, I would just want a warning when a test method is empty or\nhas no asserts... but I don&#39;t want to go to the trouble of getting some\ncode-coverage tool working.\n&gt; I think Jeff has hit the nail on the head, I too would like to be\n&gt; able to get some feedback when the number of asserts has changed\n&gt; for the same reasons.\n&gt;\n&gt; Seems to me that the simplest thing that could possibly work is\n&gt; to count the asserts.\nI&#39;m not using the current JUnit, since my old version is doing just fine,\nwith no class-loader problems because it doesn&#39;t do its own class-loading,\nand I&#39;ve customized it to write time-per-test information to stdout, etc...\nEventually I will add the no-asserts warning to my versions of CppUnit and\nJUnit.\nDoes the current JUnit have a tree view of test-cases within test-suites\nwithin other test-suites? If it did, then the lowest-level view of a single\ntest-case could display the assert count, or perhaps turn some color if\nthere were no asserts.\nDid the code that someone wrote to look for TestCase subclasses in specified\ndirectory hierarchies or jar files, and automatically run them, get put into\nJUnit or made public?\n\nYahoo!
