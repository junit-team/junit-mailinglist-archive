Regardless of how well one <br/>\nprogram can reason about the behavior of another, it requires that the <br/>\nprogram reason about the intent of the original programmer.  The <br/>\nautomated tests _may_ be able to assess that the code is doing what it <br/>\nit written to do, but how can it determine that it wasn&#39;t written to do <br/>\nthe right thing?<br/>\n<br/>\nWe use unit tests to make sure that the software is doing what it is <br/>\ndoing the correct thing, as well as making sure that it does what it <br/>\ndoes correctly.<br/>\n<br/>\nJim<br/>\n<br/>\nJ.

It&#39;s a shame that such tools simply cannot<br/>\n&gt; exist beyond the very simplest methods. If it were so easy to do, it<br/>\n&gt; would be done. I&#39;m no complexity/computational theory expert, but from<br/>\n&gt; what I understand, there is very little any program can reason about the<br/>\n&gt; behavior of any other program, so the tool you describe above probably<br/>\n&gt; can&#39;t be useful for any non-trivial system.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; As for the question of whether the method is tested exhaustively, that<br/>\n&gt; depends on how well the test-generating code is tested... and then it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; turtles all the way down: an infinite regression. It simply pushes the<br/>\n&gt; problem to the next programmer.<br/>\n&gt; -- <br/>\n&gt; J. B.
