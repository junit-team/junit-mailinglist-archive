I see all the discussions going on and they are f=\r\nar beyond what I conceive that I have use for at the moment.\n\nPresently, I&#39;=\r\nm developing part of a simulation system in Java for work, and I plan on us=\r\ning JUnit as part of NetBeans to do unit testing to bulletproof my code.  M=\r\ny question is, as I understand it, I can write a class and then &quot;right-clic=\r\nk to generate JUnit test class&quot; or something.  So what happens when I updat=\r\ne my real class with additional fixes and/or functionality?  Does NB/JU kno=\r\nw to automatically update the test class, or do I have to regen the test cl=\r\nass?\n\nThanks for your time,\nMike\n\n\n",
