That wasn&#39;t the intent.  I have\nsome strong idea=\r\ns about TDD.\n\nGranted this isn&#39;t the TDD list, it&#39;s the JUnit list.. I gues=\r\ns I\nsometimes loose site of the fact that a lot of people using JUnit\ndon&#39;t=\r\n do TDD.  Different techniques apply.  My point of view is from\nthe practic=\r\ne of pure TDD.  As I&#39;ve been accused of before, I am a bit\nof a purist abou=\r\nt some things.  I don&#39;t expect it to be applicable to\neveryone, or every pr=\r\noject.\n\n&gt; I didn&#39;t come here to have some guy and his buddy disparage the i=\r\ndeas \n&gt; that I offer without offering anything in exchange other than, &quot;Thi=\r\ns \n&gt; is how it is.  Buy my book!&quot;\n\nBut it or don&#39;t, I don&#39;t really care.  I=\r\n wrote it because I saw a\nneed, and had something to say that I felt other =\r\npeople might be\ninterested in hearing.\n\nFYI I&#39;ve gotten some very good feed=\r\nback on the book.\n\n&gt; I think if a person jumps into a discussion and says, =\r\n&quot;Your approach \n&gt; sucks.  Buy my book!&quot;\n\nThat&#39;s not quite what I said.\n \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Yet, I haven&#39;t \n&gt; &gt; seen any explanation as to what is inferior in your a=\r\npproach - \n&gt; &gt; asserting it&#39;s inferior does not make it so.\n&gt; \n&gt; I couldn&#39;t=\r\n agree more.\n\nThe main thing is &quot;does it work for you?&quot;\n\nIf so, great.  But=\r\n could it work better?  I talk about what I&#39;ve\nproven works well for me.\n \n=\r\n&gt; For the record, I never said I disagreed with what Dave and J. B.\n&gt; are a=\r\ndvocating.  I never said I didn&#39;t like them personally, either.  \n&gt; It&#39;s th=\r\ne delivery of their message I find curious.\n\nYoung children tend to be frig=\r\nhtened by me as well... until they get\nto know me, that is.\n\n&gt; It seems mor=\r\ne  geared toward self-interest than equitable exchange \n&gt; or mutual benefit=\r\n.\n\nWell, it certainly stirred up some exchange.\n\nDave\n\n\n",
