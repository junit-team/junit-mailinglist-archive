Look for an abstraction and extract the private method=\r\ns you want to\ntest into a separate, testable class. Inspired By Cederics ex=\r\nample and\nrefering to the Java-API, let&#39;s say that you have the private met=\r\nhod\nint compare(Object left, Object right) that compares two objects. That\n=\r\ncan be extracted to a comparator with that method as a public\ninterface (ye=\r\ns I completely stile the exam=F6ple from the Java API\nwhat&#39;s wong with that=\r\n? :)). An implementation of that interface could\nbe instantiated and used i=\r\nn the your tested class AND it could and\nshould be tested in isolation outs=\r\nide of that class.\n\nI would look for abstractions first, I have yet to find=\r\n a situation\nwhere I need to test private methods with reflection and I ver=\r\ny\nseldomly, if ever need to open up the API in a way that feels\n&quot;unnatural&quot;=\r\n. When I do that a better solution usually presents itself\nlater (so openin=\r\ng up can be a way to keep your flow).\n\nI think SRP is one of the most impor=\r\ntant principles when TDD:ing:\nhttp://www.objectmentor.com/resources/article=\r\ns/srp\n\nIf something is hard to test the reason is often that SRP has been v=\r\niolated.\n\nJust my two cents for what they are worth.\n/J\n\n\n&gt;  Back to the or=\r\niginal question.  You have two options:\n&gt;\n&gt;  - You absolutely want to keep =\r\nthat method private, and in this case,\n&gt;     you should probably invoke it =\r\nvia reflection (see setAccessible(true)).\n&gt;\n&gt;  - You can relax the visibili=\r\nty of this method, in which case I suggest\n&gt;     making it package protecte=\r\nd and then put your test in the same package (it\n&gt;     can still be in a se=\r\nparate source folder).\n&gt;\n&gt;  I recommend the latter approach...\n&gt;\n\n",
