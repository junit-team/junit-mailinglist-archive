There are some conditions that are required for the\n &gt; contract to hold but which the method either cannot check, cannot check\n &gt; efficiently, or simply elects not to check. In this case, the\n &gt; results are usually given as &#39;undefined&#39;. Checked preconditions on\n &gt; the other hand, can be expected to signal a particular error and generally\n &gt; to exit gracefully. Unit tests can and should verify that violations of\n &gt; checked preconditions do, in fact, fail.\n\n...and...\n\n &gt; This is also what I&#39;ve called DBC vs. Defensive Programming.  DBC is simply a\n &gt; statement of the contract (expressed neatly in JUnit tests of course :-)\n &gt; -- the &quot;what&quot; must be true in order to gaurantee the results --\n\nTests for /checked/ preconditions is straightforward.\n\nCan anyone show an example of how you express /unchecked/ preconditions\nin JUnit tests?  As a test in the client that shows it never calls the\nunchecked method with a violated precondition?  Duplicated in all client\nmethods?  If it can&#39;t be done, then how do you document unchecked\npreconditions?\n\nRegards,\nPaul\n-----\nPaul Hodgetts -- Principal Consultant\nAgile Logic -- www.agilelogic.com\nTraining, Mentoring, Development -- Agile Processes, XP, Java, J2EE, C++\n\n\n",
