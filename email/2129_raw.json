I choose to organize my tests so that I generally have one\ntest per tested method, with appropriately many asserts per test. &quot;\n\nI think it is best to keep methods as concise and as focused as\npossible (see Refactoring by Fowler, et al; basically, your code will\nbe more reliable and easier to maintain).  For me, this means writing\nseveral small test methods for the method I am testing, and at most\nhaving one assert per test method and sometimes no asserts at all\n(for example, if you are testing an exception that passes control to\na catch block, there is no need to put assert(true) in the catch\nblock).\n\nI haven&#39;t really followed the recent thread regarding &quot;Why doesn&#39;t\nJUnit count asserts&quot;, but I now understand the position of some\npeople who favor counting asserts.  If you have many asserts in one\ntest method, counting asserts would give you the number of conditions\nyou have tested.  However, I think it would be best to put each\nspecific condition in a seperate test method.  I usually have between\neight and sixteen test methods for each method I am testing.\n\nI use the following naming convention for my test methods to keep\nthings organized:\n\n    test_##_nameOfMethodBeingTested\n\nFor example, the eigth test method for the method isAccountAssigned\nwould be,\n\n    test_07_isAccountAssigned\n\n\n--- Jason Rogers &lt;jason.rogers@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Point well taken, Tom, but I still disagree.  I guess it is a\n&gt; matter of\n&gt; taste for the most part.  However, I wouldn&#39;t like the framework to\n&gt; be\n&gt; &#39;polluted&#39; by the counting of asserts - but maybe I am just being\n&gt; too\n&gt; dogmatic.  Thanks for your well-formed opinions!!!\n&gt; \n&gt; -Jason\n&gt; \n&gt;     &gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt;     &gt; From: Thomas Obst [mailto:thomas_obst@...]\n&gt;     &gt; Sent: Thursday, July 26, 2001 9:45 AM\n&gt;     &gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;     &gt; Subject: Re: [junit] Reporting more then 1 failed \n&gt;     &gt; assertion per test\n&gt;     &gt; \n&gt;     &gt; \n&gt;     &gt; Jason Rogers wrote:\n&gt;     &gt; \n&gt;     &gt; &gt; I respectfully disagree.  You assume that asserts and \n&gt;     &gt; test cases are equal\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; in their importance.  What I want to know is whether or \n&gt;     &gt; not a test has\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; passed.  ...  So, why count asserts?  Perhaps to give\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; that warm, fuzzy feeling... perhaps for some other reason.\n&gt;     &gt; \n&gt;     &gt; The only important thing is whether the application \n&gt;     &gt; works. Whatever else  we\n&gt;     &gt; evaluate, whether it is the number of asserts, the number \n&gt;     &gt; of tests, the number\n&gt;     &gt; of test cases, or even whether we test at all, is just \n&gt;     &gt; there to give us that\n&gt;     &gt; &quot;warm, fuzzy feeling&quot; or to give us the shivers. The \n&gt;     &gt; number of tests/asserts\n&gt;     &gt; doesn&#39;t prove anything but it does give us a hint at an \n&gt;     &gt; appropriate body\n&gt;     &gt; temperature.\n&gt;     &gt; \n&gt;     &gt; I guess this whole discussion really boils down to what \n&gt;     &gt; constitutes a test. I\n&gt;     &gt; choose to organize my tests so that I generally have one \n&gt;     &gt; test per tested method,\n&gt;     &gt; with appropriately many asserts per test. Other \n&gt;     &gt; programmers might want to\n&gt;     &gt; refactor my test code so that basically one assert per \n&gt;     &gt; test was the rule. This\n&gt;     &gt; is probably just a matter of taste. If so, it would be \n&gt;     &gt; nice if JUnit would\n&gt;     &gt; support both approaches - displaying the number of tests \n&gt;     &gt; _and_ the number of\n&gt;     &gt; asserts.\n&gt;     &gt; \n&gt;     &gt; - Tom\n&gt;     &gt; \n&gt;     &gt; \n&gt;     &gt; \n&gt;     &gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
