If you just tested with integration test you would<br/>\nprobably know something is wrong but might not be able to pinpoint where it<br/>\nis wrong.  I would think your cost of fixing that error would be lower with<br/>\nthe unit test because you don&#39;t have to search for it.  Granted, you could<br/>\nprobably do just as well with the integration test, but isn&#39;t reassuring to<br/>\nsay I have fully tested all the objects that generate a given page and I<br/>\nhave confidence in them.  I think that this is what testing is all about...<br/>\nconfidence.  Unit testing gives you confidence in your objects. Integration<br/>\ntesting gives you confidence in the interaction between your objects.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy $.02<br/>\n<br/>\nMichael<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: news [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:news@...\">news@...</a>]On Behalf Of Mike Bresnahan<br/>\nSent: Friday, June 20, 2003 9:54 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [junit] Unit Testing vs Integration Testing<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI have experience with integration testing but not much with unit testing.<br/>\nI&#39;ve been reading up on unit testing  (e.g. mock objects, test first<br/>\ndevelopment).  However, I have not found an article that explains the<br/>\nadvantages of unit testing vs integration testing.  My perhaps naive hunch<br/>\nis that the cost-per-bug-eliminated of unit testing is higher than that of<br/>\nintegration testing.  It appears this way because a single integration test<br/>\ntests a lot more code than a single unit test and takes about the same<br/>\namount of time to construct.  Plus it seems to me that a whole suite of unit<br/>\ntests with 100% code coverage cannot guarantee that even the simplest system<br/>\nwide behavior is correct (e.g. the web page appears).  Am I wrong about<br/>\nthis?  Can someone refer me information about this topic.  A scientific<br/>\nstudy paper with real numbers would be welcome.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike Bresnahan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!
