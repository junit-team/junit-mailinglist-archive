The problem is<br/>\nthat some of the test cases deal with characters not supported within<br/>\nISO-8859-1 such as � or �.  I know Java supports encoding strings in<br/>\nspecific character sets via String.getBytes(Charset charset) and that new<br/>\nstrings can be constructed via new String(byte[] bytes, Charset charset).<br/>\n<br/>\nQUESTIONS:<br/>\n<br/>\n   1. Is the recommended way to test transcoding simply to test resulting<br/>\n   bytes from encoding?<br/>\n   2. If test resulting bytes from encoding, is there a recommended way to<br/>\n   determine the correct bytes for the unit test?<br/>\n   3. Does anyone know of existing unit tests that address this problem?<br/>\n<br/>\nI would appreciate any advice and direction offered.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards,<br/>\n-- <br/>\n*Andrew Feller*<br/>\nProduction Engineer<br/>\nBronto Software, Inc<br/>\n324 Blackwell St. Ste. 410<br/>\nDurham, NC 27701<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;If you do too much, people get dependent on you.<br/>\nAnd if you do nothing, they lose hope.<br/>\nYou have to use a light touch ...<br/>\nIf you do things right, people won&#39;t be sure you&#39;ve done anything at all.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Gaseous Omniscient Deity from Futurama<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
