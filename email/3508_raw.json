Because of its distributed nature, objects are \nconstantly passed around between tiers.  Since these object are \ndistributed, we use a unique identifier (a primary key in a database) \nto distinguish between objects.\n\nThe business objects used in our applications all derive from one \nhigh-level business object, called BaseBusinessObject.  In order to \nallow for the correct comparison of objects in the distributed \nenvironment, the decision was made to override the .equals() method \nin BaseBusinessObject to compare the primary keys of two objects.  \nThis allows us, for example, to remove a business object from a \nVector because the Vector&#39;s remove() method internally calls \nthe .equals() method.  We obviously can&#39;t compare the objects in the \nVector by reference, the default .equals() behavior, because they may \nbe distributed objects and thus wouldn&#39;t have the same reference.\n\nThe problem lies in the fact that we want to be able to \noverride .equals() in derived business objects to compare their \nattributes by value.  This is of course the way that assertEquals() \nworks in the junit framework.  If we override the .equals() method, \nthen there are implications for methods on collections, such as remove\n() on a Vector.  \n\nThere are many articles that explain how to write unit tests with the \nassumption that the .equals() method can be overridden, but there \ndoesn&#39;t seem to be any documentation on how to test an application \nthat uses distributed objects in which you can&#39;t override .equals().  \nIt seems that this would be a very common problem, but I can&#39;t seem \nto find anything on it.\n\nWe have a few ideas on how to get around this problem, but I was \nhoping that someone may be able to shine some light on the issue \nbefore we implement an unnecessarily crude solution.\n\n\n",
