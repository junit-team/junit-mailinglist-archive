For example you should probably have A=\r\ncceptance Tests.\n\nAt least! This helps explain why our business sponsor smi=\r\nles at our demos! She&#39;s seeing what she asked for! :-)\n\n&gt;&gt; So, I know that =\r\nI will be using a combination of Jtest and\n&gt;&gt; Junit for a long time to come=\r\n. If you write optimal code\n&gt;&gt; without the need for automated testing tools=\r\n, then I salute you! :-)\n&gt;\n&gt;Who said that the only alternative to not using=\r\n JTest was to use no\n&gt;automated testing tool at all?\n\nGot me there! :-)\n\n&gt;B=\r\nTW, are you developing test-first?\n\nOn a good day. Some aspects of web appl=\r\nications are very difficult to test and I keep meaning to learn how to use =\r\nMockObjects, to get better test coverage.\n\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I would actually interpret=\r\n these exceptions as an indication\n&gt;&gt; &gt;of some extra guard conditions and m=\r\nore defensive programming\n&gt;&gt; &gt;needed within the tested code. If a piece of =\r\ncalled code\n&gt;&gt; &gt;cannot handle unexpected inputs, then the fault lies with t=\r\nhe\n&gt;&gt; &gt;code and not the inputs. :-)\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;I disagree. If the input viola=\r\ntes a precondition, the fault\n&gt;&gt; &gt;lies with the input, by definition.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n I wholeheartedly disagree with you. It makes no difference\n&gt;&gt; what your &quot;c=\r\nontract&quot; is between a piece of software and it&#39;s\n&gt;&gt; callers, if the softwar=\r\ne doesn&#39;t check it&#39;s own inputs then\n&gt;&gt; it is at fault.\n&gt;\n&gt;Mhh, I wasn&#39;t ta=\r\nlking about the input to the software, but about the\n&gt;input from internal c=\r\nomponents to internal components. Would you agree\n&gt;that precondition possib=\r\nly isn&#39;t that critical there?\n\nI agree that it most likely isn&#39;t critical t=\r\nhere. However, that would be a decision that the development team / busines=\r\ns sponsor could change if the system was critical enough.\n\n&gt;Regards, Ilja\n\n=\r\nSimon\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\nSi=\r\nmon P.
