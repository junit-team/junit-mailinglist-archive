Thank you for the good work.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; I was wondering, what made you choose TestRule to be an abstract class<br/>\n&gt;&gt; and not an interface? This is so much of a pain.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; JUnit4 provides a number of base classes for Rule implementations already<br/>\n&gt; (Verifier, ExternalResoruces, etc). Anyone wanting to reuse that behavior<br/>\n&gt; already had to lose the inheritance slot.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s true. And I do prefer &#39;cannot inherit sometimes&#39; than &#39;cannot inherit<br/>\never&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  In your position, I&#39;d also be frustrated.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; The class being empty, I don&#39;t get it.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; The idea was to guide people away from an improper usage of Rules.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; For example, calling Timeout.apply in the middle of a test method is<br/>\n&gt;&gt; so likely to be the wrong thing to do, that we wanted to make it<br/>\n&gt;&gt; difficult.  If there were some way for a rule to expose one interface<br/>\n&gt;&gt; to the framework, and another to test writers, that would be ideal.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; This seemed like the next-best solution.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Seems logical to me. Didn&#39;t realize that the benefit was hidden in the<br/>\n&#39;protected&#39; keyword :-)<br/>\nWe could check at runtime that the method is being called properly but that<br/>\nwould be less elegant and could be tricky.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; One of my custom Rules needs to extend a class already.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I would also be interested in understanding the use case.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Since there is only one method in TestRule, it&#39;s very easy to use<br/>\n&gt; delegation instead of inheritance to reuse the code in your base class.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The class I inherit from has dozens of methods. That&#39;s not the best use case<br/>\nof delegation. However, I ended up doing exactly that.<br/>\n<br/>\nOverall when I design code, I prefer interfaces over inheritance, but I<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; believe we should optimize for developers that use Rules over developers<br/>\n&gt; that create new Rule implementations; it&#39;s by far the most common case. A<br/>\n&gt; large number of Java developers use IDEs, and having the IDE suggest a<br/>\n&gt; completion that a test should never call is a poor and confusing experience.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Agree 100%.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the insights,<br/>\n<br/>\nDavid.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
