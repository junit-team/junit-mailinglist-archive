Since\n   a modern software application often interacts with a diverse\n   execution environment in a complicated and unpredictable manner,\n   there is a clear need for approaches that test an application, an\n   application&#39;s execution environment, and the interaction between\n   the software application and its environment. In light of these\n   trends, the overall theme of WISEST 2007 is:\n   \n      Improving software testing by integrating execution environments \n\n   The workshop will focus on the testing and analysis of a program\n   and an execution environment that contains a wide variety of\n   additional hardware and software factors.  The goals of WISEST 2007\n   are to:\n\n       - articulate the fundamental research questions associated\n       with testing software applications and their execution\n       environments \n\n       - support the description and evaluation of innovative\n       &quot;environment aware&quot; approaches to software testing\n\n-----------------\n  Call for Papers\n-----------------\n\n   WISEST 2007 solicits experience, tool, and research papers that\n   explore software testing and analysis techniques that explicitly\n   integrate an application&#39;s execution environment. It is suggested,\n   although not strictly required, that papers discuss environment\n   aware approaches to testing and analysis that are related to:\n\n   \t   adequacy criteria, test suite execution, test coverage\n   \t   monitoring, automated test data generation, regression\n   \t   testing, debugging, automated fault localization, and\n   \t   performance evaluation.\n\n   The testing approach should focus on a system environment that\n   includes, but is not limited to, factors such as the:\n\n\t   operating system, computer architecture, database, file\n           system, graphical user interface, wireless sensor network,\n           distributed system middleware, and virtual machine.\n\n-----------------\n  Types of Papers\n-----------------\n\n    - Experience reports should provide practical insights into how to\n      use existing approaches to perform testing and analysis in an\n      environment aware fashion.\n\n    - Tool papers must focus on the design, implementation, and\n      evaluation of environment aware software testing and analysis\n      tools.\n\n    - Original research papers will explore novel testing techniques\n      that are explicitly designed to incorporate a software system&#39;s\n      execution environment.\n\n------------------\n  Paper Evaluation\n------------------\n\n   All papers will undergo a rigorous review by at least three members\n   of the Program Committee. All submitted papers will be evaluated\n   according to (i) relevance to the workshop themes and goals and\n   (ii) clarity and organization. Experience reports will be evaluated\n   with respect to the significance and generality of the described\n   testing experience. Research and tool papers will be judged by the\n   technical merit, novelty, and evaluation of the described technique\n   or tool. The results described in the submitted paper must be\n   unpublished and should not be under review at other workshops,\n   conferences, or journals.\n\n------------------\n  Paper Formatting\n------------------\n\n   Papers should be formatted using the ACM SIG templates. Including\n   all references and figures, a paper must not exceed the six page\n   limit. Authors should submit a PDF version of their paper using the\n   CyberChairPro affiliated with the ISSTA 2007 conference. More\n   details about paper submission will be provided on the WISEST Web\n   site.\n\n----------------------\n  Workshop Proceedings\n----------------------\n\n   The WISEST 2007 proceedings will be published in a printed volume\n   that will be given to participants at the workshop. The complete\n   proceedings will also be available for download in the ACM Digital\n   Library and the titles of the accepted papers will be listed in the\n   print edition of Software Engineering Notes.  The presentations for\n   all of the accepted papers will also be provided on the WISEST Web\n   site.\n\n-----------------\n  Important Dates\n-----------------\n\n   April 20, 2007: \tPaper Submission Deadline \n   May 25, 2007: \tAuthor Notification\n   June 15, 2007: \tCamera Ready Copy\n   July 9, 2007: \tWISEST 2007 Workshop\n   July 10-12, 2007: \tISSTA 2007 Conference\n\n--------------------\n  Workshop Co-Chairs\n--------------------\n\n   Mary Lou Soffa (University of Virginia) \t\t\n   Gregory M.
