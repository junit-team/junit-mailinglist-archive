We strive for the goal that nothing \nships without complete automated tests. As a Java shop, we use JUnit.\n\nHowever, we do not use testing as a design tool. We use a spiral model \nbuilt around testing and design and coding. Some code is written test \nfirst, some code is tested after it is written. All code is designed \ninto the software structure before it is committed to source code. As \nlong as the code is tested before it ships, we are confident that it \nworks. But we do not do test first design.\n\nJim\n\n-- \nJames P. Gunderson, Ph.D.                Cognitive Systems Architect\njgunders@...
