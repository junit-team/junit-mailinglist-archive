Where have<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; you been working?! :)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This is the documented and required behavior of all Throwable objects in<br/>\n&gt; Java 1.4 and later. I&#39;m just trying to duplicate that in Java 1.3 and<br/>\n&gt; earlier.If you consult the source code for java.lang.Throwable you&#39;ll<br/>\n&gt; see something similar. I told you this was tricky. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Incidentally, I just learned that, by default, an exception /is/ its own <br/>\ncause in JDK 1.4, so are you sure you want to stop people from doing that?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; By the way one place where exception objects do get assigned to<br/>\n&gt; variables is in a SAX parser, where an exception would need to be passed<br/>\n&gt; to an ErrorHandler, which then has the choice of whether to throw the<br/>\n&gt; exception or not.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This I understand. I guess I&#39;ve just never seen that level of <br/>\nsophistication in exception classes before. It looks like unnecessary <br/>\ncomplexity to me, but then I don&#39;t understand the problems you&#39;re trying <br/>\nto solve. I&#39;m sure that if you explained it to me over beer, I would see <br/>\nit differently. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
