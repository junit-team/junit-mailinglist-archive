I&#39;ve seen this problem discussed in this group\n&gt; before, but I think my problem is different:\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m using a class in some places that extends TestCase and does some\n&gt; database setup work. The JUnits that extend MyTestCase are the ones\n&gt; that don&#39;t show up; the ones that extend it directly, do.\n&gt;\n&gt; I can only assume that I&#39;ve somehow incorrectly overriden TestCase,\n&gt; but I&#39;m not sure how or what the fix would be...\n&gt;\nGenerally when the XML is empty I found that is was because there was an \nexception creating the test suite. It may also happen if the setup in a \nTestSetup case fails, but I am less certain of that.  Do you know if the \ntest suite is successfully loaded and started?\n\n-Kathy Van Stone\nkvs@...\n\n\n\n\n\n",
