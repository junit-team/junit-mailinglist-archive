Mostly<br/>\nJUnit would be bypassing the usual interfaces into your application and the<br/>\nresulting tests would not be true system tests.  It can be used for load<br/>\ntesting, although you may need some of the add-ons and in any event there<br/>\nare better tools for most load testing situations.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) can we use junit for integrating testing<br/>\n<br/>\nAbsolutely, in fact its ideal when you are performing a bottom-up<br/>\nintegration as I am at the moment.  If you have a top-down integration<br/>\nstrategy then it would probably be of little use to you.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nNic</div>",
