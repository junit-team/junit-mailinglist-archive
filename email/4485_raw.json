Ideally, such applications would be\n&gt; non-trivial yet\n&gt; understandable by someone not familiar with the\n&gt; domain.  Moreover,\n&gt; the application should have lots of test cases with\n&gt; meaningful names that \n&gt; exercise much of the functionality of that\n&gt; application.\n&gt; \n&gt; Any recommendations?  Applications written in Python\n&gt; would be good also\n&gt; though I suspect there are a lot more written in\n&gt; Java.\n&gt; \n&gt; Amir\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
