Depending<br/>\n&gt; &gt; on the input argument it executes one thing or the other. The <br/>\n&gt; &gt; problem is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that on my main(String[] args) method at the end or when it <br/>\n&gt; &gt; founds an error,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the method System.exit() is invoked. So when I define jUnit test cases<br/>\n&gt; &gt; (methods with prefix test), jUnits only runs the first test, <br/>\n&gt; &gt; because some<br/>\n&gt; &gt; System.exit() was invoked.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Is there any way to test such kind of situations?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>In general I second the suggestions made by Bernd and J. B.<br/>\nRainsberger.  However, that said, I think you /can/ test this as it<br/>\ncurrently is coded by using a security manager.  If you run the JUnit<br/>\ntest runner with a security manager present, and specify a security<br/>\npolicy that doesn&#39;t allow the application code to call System.exit(),<br/>\nthen what /should/ happen is that when the code calls System.exit(), a<br/>\nSecurityException will be thrown.  You can catch that in your test code.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo me this sounds like it would be more effort than following Bernd or<br/>\nJ.B.&#39;s recommendations, but I thought I&#39;d mention it anyway in case you<br/>\n(or someone else) want to give it a try.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\n<br/>\nbn</div>",
