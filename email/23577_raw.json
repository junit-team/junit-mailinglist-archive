Thanks,\n&gt;\n&gt; Your friendly neighborhood JUnit maintainers\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ## Summary of Changes in version 4.9, final ##\n&gt;\n&gt; Release theme: Test-class and suite level Rules.\n&gt;\n&gt; ### ClassRule ###\n&gt;\n&gt; The `ClassRule` annotation extends the idea of method-level Rules,\n&gt; adding static fields that can affect the operation of a whole class.  Any\n&gt; subclass of `ParentRunner`, including the standard `BlockJUnit4ClassRunner`\n&gt; and `Suite` classes, will support `ClassRule`s.\n&gt;\n&gt; For example, here is a test suite that connects to a server once before\n&gt; all the test classes run, and disconnects after they are finished:\n&gt;\n&gt;        @RunWith(Suite.class)\n&gt;        @SuiteClasses({A.class, B.class, C.class})\n&gt;        public class UsesExternalResource {\n&gt;                public static Server myServer= new Server();\n&gt;\n&gt;                @ClassRule\n&gt;                public static ExternalResource resource= new\n&gt; ExternalResource() {\n&gt;                        @Override\n&gt;                        protected void before() throws Throwable {\n&gt;                                myServer.connect();\n&gt;                        };\n&gt;\n&gt;                        @Override\n&gt;                        protected void after() {\n&gt;                                myServer.disconnect();\n&gt;                        };\n&gt;                };\n&gt;        }\n&gt;\n&gt; ### TestRule ###\n&gt;\n&gt; In JUnit 4.9, fields that can be annotated with either `@Rule` or\n&gt; `@ClassRule`\n&gt; should be of type `TestRule`.  The old `MethodRule` type, which only made\n&gt; sense\n&gt; for method-level rules, will still work, but is deprecated.\n&gt;\n&gt; Most built-in Rules have been moved to the new type already, in a way that\n&gt; should be transparent to most users.  `TestWatchman` has been deprecated,\n&gt; and replaced by `TestWatcher`, which has the same functionality, but\n&gt; implements\n&gt; the new type.\n&gt;\n&gt; ### Maven support ###\n&gt;\n&gt; Maven bundles have, in the past, been uploaded by kind volunteers.\n&gt;  Starting\n&gt; with this release, the JUnit team is attempting to perform this task\n&gt; ourselves.\n&gt;\n&gt; ### LICENSE checked in ###\n&gt;\n&gt; The Common Public License that JUnit is released under is now included\n&gt; in the source repository.\n&gt;\n&gt; ### Bug fixes ###\n&gt;\n&gt; - github#98: assumeTrue() does not work with expected exceptions\n&gt; - github#74: Categories + Parameterized\n&gt;\n&gt;  In JUnit 4.8.2, the Categories runner would fail to run correctly\n&gt;  if any contained test class had a custom Runner with a structure\n&gt;  significantly different from the built-in Runner.  With this fix,\n&gt;  such classes can be assigned one or more categories at the class level,\n&gt;  and will be run correctly.  Trying to assign categories to methods within\n&gt;  such a class will flag an error.\n&gt;\n&gt; - github#38: ParentRunner filters more than once\n&gt;\n&gt;  Thanks to `@reinholdfuereder`\n&gt;\n&gt; - github#248: protected BlockJUnit4ClassRunner#rules method removed from\n&gt; 4.8.2\n&gt; - github#187: Accidental dependency on Java 6\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks to `@kcooney` for:\n&gt;\n&gt; - github#163: Bad comparison failure message when using\n&gt; assertEquals(String, String)\n&gt; - github#227: ParentRunner now assumes that getChildren() returns a\n&gt; modifiable list\n&gt;\n&gt; ### Minor changes ###\n&gt;\n&gt; - Backed out unused folder &quot;experimental-use-of-antunit&quot;, replaced by\n&gt;  bash-based script at build_tests.sh\n&gt; - Various Javadoc fixes\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks to `@kcooney` for:\n&gt;\n&gt; - Made MultipleFailureException public, to assist extension writers.\n&gt; - github#240: Add &quot;test&quot; target to build.xml, for faster ant-driven\n&gt; testing.\n&gt; - github#247: Give InitializationError a useful message\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
