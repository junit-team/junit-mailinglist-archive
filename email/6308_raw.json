(=&gt; includes free bugfixes for\n&gt; 3.0, no time limit, and access to the EAP)\n&gt; More details here\n&gt;    http://www.intellij.com/idea/buy.jsp\n&gt;\n&gt; Many people - like me, and you - were initially mislead by the new\n&gt; wording of the license scheme. The annual maintenance and support is\n&gt; targeted at companies who want/need more/faster support.\n&gt;\n&gt; With the &quot;basic maintenance and support&quot;, you still have access to the\n&gt; support forums,  and the  EAP (Early Access Program). It is still\n&gt; running, and has already produced 2 bugfixes releases, that work with\n&gt; the standard licenses.\n&gt; It should also give you access to next EAP (for the next version), that,\n&gt; I think, should start in about 2 months.\n\nI was ignoring the &quot;special pricing&quot; because it expires at the end of the\nyear. So that&#39;s why I said $500 vs. the $400 you quoted. But let&#39;s assume\nthat we buy during the special pricing phase and that they always offer a\nspecial price when they release a new version and that they release one or\ntwo more versions in the 12-month period starting now.\n\n\nSo if you were a new owner, you&#39;d pay $399 without the contract. If\nIntelliJ released one new version during the year, you&#39;d also pay a $199\nupgrade price, for a total of $598. If they released two versions during\nthe year, you&#39;d pay an extra $199, for a total of $797.\n\nHowever, if you got the contract, you&#39;d pay $599. If they released one\nversion during the year, you&#39;d still have paid $599. And if they released\ntwo versions during the year, you&#39;d still have paid $599 (a savings of\n$198).\n\n\nIt&#39;s similar for current onwers of version 2.6: upgrade without the\nsupport contract for $199, upgrade again for $199 ($398 total), perhaps\nupgrade again for $199 ($597 total). Upgrade with the support contract for\n$399 and don&#39;t pay extra if they release one or two versions during the\nyear.\n\n\nSo the only way the non-support contract way is better is if IntelliJ\ndidn&#39;t release any new versions during the year. Or if they did but\ncharged less for them than they are charging for the 2.6 -&gt; 3.0 upgrade.\n\nUnless I&#39;m missing something (which I hope I am). (Though I wasn&#39;t\ncomplaining about the price; it&#39;s worth it to my company.)\n\n\nErik\n\n\n\n",
