Now how can I write a test to this particular change<br/>\n&gt; that I have to make. My understanding of testing using JUnit is to<br/>\n&gt; test the component which I am changing. But in this particular case<br/>\n&gt; I will be returning this ValueObject to some other part of my code<br/>\n&gt; where there is chance that the code may fail(though I can&#39;t see any<br/>\n&gt; chance of it as of now). I&#39;ll appreciate the group&#39;s comments on my<br/>\n&gt; doubt.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Don&#39;t look to us for rules about what to test. If you think it might not <br/>\nwork, then test it. Test it, anyway, just for practice. After you gain <br/>\nmore experience, your judgment about what to test and what&#39;s Too Simple <br/>\nto Break will improve.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the meantime, test it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnswer this question for yourself: if you made your change incorrectly, <br/>\nthen how would you know? When you answer that question, there is your <br/>\ntest. If the answer is &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot;, then maybe that line of code you <br/>\nare about to remove does nothing useful! Is there more code that does <br/>\nnothing useful? Remove it too!<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
