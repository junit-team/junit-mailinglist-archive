Thanx all.\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;cliftonccraig&quot; &lt;cliftonccraig@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Alright I&#39;m in the thick of EJB mocking now and having some troubles.\n&gt; Using mockEJB I&#39;m able to mock an EJB container deployment and\n&gt; retreive my EJB frmo the mock container. The problem is that I&#39;m\n&gt; having difficulties accessing protected members of my EJB. Example: I\n&gt; have a session bean that I&#39;m unit testing and I want to test a\n&gt; protected method but it appears that I can only access the bean\n&gt; through the remote interface. Does this mean I have to define all of\n&gt; the protected members in the remote interface so my test can access\n&gt; them? The problem that appears is when you lookup the session bean.\n&gt; You get a reference to the home interface and call create on that\n&gt; interface. This returns a proxy to your bean and the proxy only\n&gt; implements the remote interface. I need direct access to my bean to\n&gt; get a good unit test. Is this possible? Am I doing something wrong?\n&gt; \n&gt; Cliff \n&gt; --- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;cliftonccraig&quot; &lt;cliftonccraig@y...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt; &gt; J.B.,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thanx for the advice. I am trying mockEJB and it seems pretty straight\n&gt; &gt; foward. I&#39;ll let you know how it goes. Thanx.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Cliff\n&gt; &gt; --- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;J. B. Rainsberger&quot; &lt;jbrains@r...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; cliftonccraig wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Alright, I&#39;ve been &quot;test infected&quot; for a little while now and I&#39;m\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; writing my tests before writing any implementation logic. Now\nI need\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to modify some existing EJBs which have not yet been touched\n&gt; with the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; test infection. Where do I start? We are nearing our beta date\n&gt; and we\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cannot afford any major upsets in the existing code base. I feel\n&gt; like\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I cannot continue my current project until I write a test of\n&gt; some sort\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for this session bean. I don&#39;t want to have to write an\nintegration\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; test first. I&#39;ve been hearing that cactus is the thing for me\nbut I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cannot get a good mental picture of how to start with it or how it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; works. If I use Cactus does that mean that I have to deploy my\n&gt; entire\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; app before testing the EJB? Please help.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Short answers:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 1. You can test the EJB in Cactus by just deploying the EJB. Your\n&gt; &gt; Cactus \n&gt; &gt; &gt; test simply uses the EJB. No need to deploy the entire application.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 2. Session beans are easy to make testable, compared to entity\nbeans. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; You can make some mechanical code changes and test 99% of the\nsession \n&gt; &gt; &gt; bean&#39;s logic /without/ a container!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 3. You can also try MockEJB (www.mockejb.org). In fact, if I were\n&gt; &gt; you, I \n&gt; &gt; &gt; might start here.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Finally--you guessed it--read chapter 11 of _JUnit Recipes_, which \n&gt; &gt; &gt; covers testing EJBs in about 75 pages. (www.manning.com/rainsberger)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Good luck.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; -- \n&gt; &gt; &gt; J. B.
