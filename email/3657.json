Perhaps you should complain to the management.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou got one thoughtful, articulate response.  Since you did not send a <br/>\nfollow up with any more detailed response, it is natural for the group to <br/>\nassume that this resolved the issue for you.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 03:24 PM 12/27/2001 +0000, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Would someone please take a look at a posting from me on the JUNIT group a <br/>\n&gt;two days ago.<br/>\n&gt;It concerns how to test a method that uses jOptionPane.  I got one reply.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;In the meantime, what else got a response?  Well, we seem to have time to <br/>\n&gt;respond to trivial subjects and partake<br/>\n&gt;in what is nothing short of mental masturbation and ignore substantive <br/>\n&gt;questions that require some effort.<br/>\n&gt;I think I have read about 30 messages about getters and setters that <br/>\n&gt;sounds more like a pissing contest.  And then there is the chatter about <br/>\n&gt;one piece of spam.  How many worthless messages did this &quot;spam&quot; <br/>\n&gt;generate?  Boy we nailed that one didn&#39;t we?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;If you need someone to chat with, get a dog.  I got one, he just doesn&#39;t <br/>\n&gt;know java/junit...yet.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Sorry for the vent but I grow tired of groping in the dark.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Thanks for your help.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Lee Chalupa<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Your use of Yahoo!
