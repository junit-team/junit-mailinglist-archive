The JUnit FAQ is moving to\n&gt; JGuru http://www.jguru.com/faq/JUnit and long time JUnit community\n&gt; member Mike Clark has accepted the position of FAQ Manager.  For\n&gt; those of you not familiar with JGuru FAQs they allow people to submit\n&gt; and answer questions, similar to a FAQ-o-matic.\n&gt;\n&gt; I hope everyone will join me in welcoming Mike Clark aboard.\n&gt;\n\nThanks for the warm introduction, Erik!\n\nI&#39;ll be consolidating the JGuru FAQ with the FAQ distributed with JUnit and\nthe mini-FAQ sent to new members of this list.  As new and recurring\nquestions are asked on this list and the JGuru forum, they&#39;ll be added to the\nFAQs.\n\nThis is truly a community effort and your contribution is greatly\nappreciated.  You&#39;re all gurus!  When a new question is asked and answered by\nanyone in the JGuru forum, a new FAQ will emerge.  Questions asked and\nanswered on this list will also make their way to the FAQs, although by a\nless-automated route.\n\nSo, if there&#39;s a question you&#39;d like to see added to the FAQ, please ask (and\nanswer!).\n\nEnjoy!   ;-)\n\nMike\n\n--\nMike Clark\nClarkware Consulting, Inc.\nhttp://www.clarkware.com\n720.851.2014\n\n\n\n",
