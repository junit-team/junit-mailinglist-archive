The project is quite dead but if you&#39;re interested in the \nidea behind it, you can have a look at JUnit-addons Runner.  Same idea, \nsimpler implementation.\n\n&gt; &quot;During their execution, the classes have access to \n&gt; external ressources (database or network connections...) \n&gt; via Services and can use the Logger to save useful information.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Vladamir, are you saying you don&#39;t need such a Logger any more?\n\nNever say &#39;never&#39; but I never had to use a logger for my tests.  So far. \n  But if I have to, I want to have this option open.\n\nMy experience with System.out is that you don&#39;t write them when you are \nwriting your tests, but only when something goes wrong.  If your test \nfor &#39;Object myfunction()&#39; is:\n\n    Integer actual = myClass.myfunction();\n    assertEquals(new Integer(3), actual);\n\nand it fails with a ClassCastException (typically you don&#39;t know much \nabout what really happens), you will be tempted to put a System.out to \nsee what was returned:\n\n    System.out.println(&quot;returned class : &quot; + actual.getClass());\n\nIMO this smells because you will have to look at the result (output, \nlog) and after writing a few hundreds of these statements your console \n(or log) will be flooded with unuseful output (because you have now \ninformation about something that works).\n\nWhat I do instead is use the JUnit-addons library (of course, since I \nwrote it!) and write:\n\n    ObjectAssert.assertInstanceOf(Integer.class, actual);\n\n1) if it fails, I will get the message &quot;expected of class &lt;Integer&gt; but \nwas of class &lt;Boolean&gt;&quot;:  Exactly the same information as with a \nSystem.out BUT...\n\n2) if it doesn&#39;t fail, I will not get any output\n\n&gt; How do people fix such a failing test? What information do you use to\n&gt; diagnose and fix it? Or is it always the time to reach for your\n&gt; debugger?\n\nI hope that I explained how I fix failing tests: I try to grab as much \ninformation as possible but without writing anything on the console/log.\n\nAnd how can a logger be useful: typically to record the environment \nwhere the tests were executed (name of the server, database, what is the \nlocale, ...) and not how they were executed.  But I may change my mind \non this.\n\n-Vladimir\n\n-- \nVladimir Ritz Bossicard\nwww.bossicard.com\n\n\n",
