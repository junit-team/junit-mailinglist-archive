Following <br/>\n&gt;&gt; the above argument all assert(type, type) can be removed and only left assert(String, Object, <br/>\n&gt;&gt; Object), but you will find afterwards ugly to write assert(new Integer(val1), ...).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Too many methods i not convenient. It&#39;s just confusing. If nobody <br/>\n&gt; actually needs these, then they should be left out. If only a few people <br/>\n&gt; need them, they should still be left out. And, no, it doesn&#39;t at all <br/>\n&gt; follow that we only need to assert String equality. Everything is not a <br/>\n&gt; string and comparing strings for equality is not the same as comparing <br/>\n&gt; integers, doubles, objects, object arrays, and more.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Unfortunately you have misinterpretted my message :-(. I was talking about comparing Objects (as you <br/>\nprobably know the assertX methods are: assertX(String msg, Object expected, Object actual)). If you <br/>\ntake a look at the sources you will see that almost all assertX methods are finally calling this <br/>\none, so the others can be considered not usefull.<br/>\n<br/>\n:alex |.::the_mindstorm::.|</div>",
