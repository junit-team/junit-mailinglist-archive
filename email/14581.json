One option<br/>\nis to just run the coverage tool from the command line or ant, but I&#39;d<br/>\nreally like something more integrated, e.g.<br/>\n<br/>\n0 a run config that would Run&gt;{JUnit, JUnit Plug-in Test} under the<br/>\n  coverage tool and display results in a view<br/>\n<br/>\n1 mark un/covered sources in Outline view or editors<br/>\n<br/>\nThe coverage plugins of which I&#39;m aware are<br/>\n<br/>\n* Clover<br/>\n<br/>\n* jcoverage<br/>\n<br/>\n* Rational Developer (Unfortunately its coverage tools are part of its<br/>\n  performance-testing tools, which complicates installation and use<br/>\n  for &quot;normal&quot; testing.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAre there others?</div>",
