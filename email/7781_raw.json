B. Rainsberger&quot; &lt;jbrains@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;So said Tung Wai Yip on 4/16/2003 --------------------\n&gt; &gt;I wrote a testCreate to create and verify a record.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Then testUpdate to update and verify the record created in testCreate.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Finally the testDelete to test delete the record created in testCreate.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;The thress test cases comprise of a suite of test for the persistence of\n&gt; &gt;one\n&gt; &gt;kind of record. This contradicts with the idea that each test case should\n&gt; &gt;be\n&gt; &gt;independent. On the other hand the test cases are easy to write and I&#39;m\n&gt; &gt;happy\n&gt; &gt;with the result. I wonder if there is any convincing reason to write a\n&gt; &gt;complex\n&gt; &gt;test case just so it can be totally independently from the others.\n&gt; \n&gt; The only way to learn this lesson is to let yourself get into trouble doing\n&gt; it the &quot;easy&quot; way. If that day never comes, then don&#39;t worry about;\n&gt; otherwise, you&#39;ll see the problems when you hit them.\n&gt; \n&gt; What you&#39;re doing is fine testing, but it&#39;s not Programmer Testing, so don&#39;t\n&gt; treat it that way. Separate those tests into another suite and don&#39;t run them\n&gt; as frequently as you run the Programmer Tests.\n&gt; \n&gt; Take care.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; J. B. Rainsberger,\n&gt; President, Diaspar Software Services\n&gt; Let&#39;s write software that people understand.\n&gt; http://www.diasparsoftware.com/\n&gt; telephone: +1 416 791-8603\n\nThat what I&#39;m trying to understand. What is the mythical problem that would get\nme into trouble? Or is it just some design guideline or best practice that we\nshould follow when it make sense?\n\nI indeed put the persistence tests into a separate suite. It is not mean to run\neverytime it compiles. People need to know it write into the database and thus\nneed to have it properly setup. The create() method itself is fairly straight\nforward. It&#39;s just a few setString() and executeQuery(). I don&#39;t know if it\nworth the effort to mock the infrastructure to test these few statements really\ngot executed. The most interesting part for me is to see the queries got\nexecuted correctly and the fields do match the schema.\n\nWai Yip\n\nP.S. For some reason my mails to this list only get listed after I sent it for\n2 days. This make the conversion not very interactive. Does anyone has this\nproblem?\n\n\n\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
