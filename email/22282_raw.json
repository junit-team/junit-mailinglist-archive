The most &quot;standard&quot; is to use a differe=\r\nnt helper under test than in production (that share a common interface or b=\r\nase class) that behave differently as required.\n\nAnother is to use a Depend=\r\nency Injection framework (such as Guice or Spring) to insert the right one =\r\nin production vs. testing.\n\nA more offbeat way, which is generally more aro=\r\nund configuration than the way you describe (starting background threads) i=\r\ns a system property. For example we use it to make sure no actual customers=\r\n get e-mails during QA tests against copies of production data.\n\nIf you wan=\r\nt to be (in my view) really ugly, you could just analyze the call stack and=\r\n look for any junit classes via Thread.currentThread().getStackTrace().\n\nTh=\r\nose last two should really be a last resort because basically, from a TDD p=\r\nerspective, this requirement to run sometimes with the background thread an=\r\nd sometimes without is driving the design to abstract your database helper.=\r\n Don&#39;t fight that, listen to what the test is telling you (unless of course=\r\n you have a specific reason to know better).\n\nYishai\n\n--- In junit@yahoogro=\r\nups.com, &quot;iltrex76&quot; &lt;albmarchi@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; In my code, I would need to =\r\ndo something like \n&gt; \n&gt; if (CodeISNotRunningInJUnit()) { \n&gt;     //do some o=\r\nperations that must not be executed if tests are running \n&gt; } \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; reas=\r\non is that the database helper class used by application and junit tests do=\r\nes some background operations that must NOT be executed while running junit=\r\n tests. \n&gt; \n&gt; is there a way to implement the method CodeISNotRunningInJUni=\r\nt() ? \n&gt; \n&gt; thank you \n&gt;  =AB Return to Thread: detect if junit is runnin\n&gt;=\r\n\n\n\n\n",
