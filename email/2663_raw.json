There is no way to avoid this unless you write your own JUnit app.  I don&#39;t think that it&#39;s what you want...\n\nif you have 3 mendatory fields, you write 4 methods.  The first 3 test that you successfully see when fields are missing and the 4th to see if everything&#39;s fine when you have your 3 mendatory fields.  You have done quite the same thing (removing one field after another) but my approach is more simple.  \n\nRemember: &quot;keep tests simple&quot;.  The more complicated the test code is, the more likely you introduce errors in the test code.  The goal of unit testing is not to debug your test code :-)\n\nto implement the simpliest tests possible:\n\n- use the setUp() method to create your data object\n- create 4 tests methods (in my example it&#39;s 4)\n- remove one single mendatory field at the beginning of each test method\n- call the fail() method to tell JUnit that something wrong happend\n\nprivate Data data;\n\npublic void setUp () {\n  data = new Data();\n  data.put(...);\n}\n\npublic void testField1Missing () {\n  data.remove(...);\n  try {\n     profile = home.create(data);\n  } catch (IllegalFieldsFormatException e) {\n     // if home throws this excpetion when a field is missing, it&#39;s fine\n  }\n}\n\npublic void testAllFieldsOK () {\n  try {\n     profile = home.create(data);\n  } catch (IllegalFieldsFormatException e) {\n     fail(&quot;this execption should not have been thrown&quot;)\n  }\n}\n\nHope it helps\n\n-Vladimir\n\n\n\n",
