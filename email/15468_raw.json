They are \n&gt; actually quite high-level. I found dropping out of TDD into unit testing \n&gt; quite hard and unnatural. Even though the resulting tests are important \n&gt; to have, i couldn&#39;t help feeling that by not writing the lower-level \n&gt; unit tests (against say a private method) I was not doing the right thing.\n\nRakesh,\n\nIt&#39;s really cool that you&#39;ve tried TDD and found it exciting.  I hope that you\ncan quickly figure out something that feels like the right thing.\n\nJust to clarify, it sounds like you write a test for some functionality that\nfeels high-level, and then find it fairly easy to quickly write the code that\nmakes it pass, but at the end, find yourself with methods that appear to be\ntested only through tests exercising methods somewhere higher up the call\nchain, and you feel that it would be important to have tests against those\nlower-level methods.\n\nThere are several situations that can drive me to have two &quot;levels&quot; of tests. \nHowever, I don&#39;t hit these situations on all projects:\n\n1) Running all the high-level tests takes longer than my attention span\n(somewhere around 30 seconds on good days, for me).\n2) It takes a long time to get each high-level test passing (I definitely get\njumpy after an hour.)\n3) I can easily think of bugs in the lower-level methods that would not be\ncaught by the higher-level tests.\n\nNotice that I might run into situation 1 after I had been working on a program\nfor a while.  However, I try to catch situations 2 and 3 as soon as\npossible--they indicate that I need to adjust the &quot;pacing&quot; of my test-driven\ndevelopment toward more smaller tests.\n\nWhen I have two levels of tests, it is often the case that I actually have two\nfailing tests at a time: one high-level failure, and one related low-level\nfailure.\n\nI hope that helps.\n\n    David Saff\n\n",
