I am sure your code won&#39;t crash if the method\n&gt; is called without these prerequisites, it&#39;s just that it won&#39;t be doing\n&gt; anything useful (no-op or throwing an exception), so testing it in these\n&gt; conditions will be useless:  you need to set up these prerequisites before\n&gt; you invoke the method.\n\nProperly designed public methods rarely have prerequisites. Exceptions \nare normally only used for exceptional conditions in the environment (in \nwhich case they&#39;re checked exceptions) or precondition violations (in \nwhich case they;re runtime exceptions).\n\n\n&gt; Seriously, can you take any two method invocations following each other in\n&gt; your code, swap them, and your code still works?!?\n\nThe code still does something reasonable from the standpoint of the \nobject. Obviously the algorithm may be changed. For instance, I can call \ndrawLine before drawRect, in which case the rect is drawn on top of the \nline if they overlap, or I can call them in the reverse order in which \ncase the line is drawn on top. But from the perspective of a Graphics \nobject neither order is wrong.\n\nThe problem comes about when people design APIs that require something \nlike g.initializeContext(), g.setColor, and g.setFont before I&#39;m allowed \nto call g.drawLine. Any initialization that&#39;s necessary for an object to \nget into its correct state should be performed in the constructor.\n\nComplicated sequences of code execution are relics of procedural \nthinking. In object oriented programming we pass messages to objects. We \nmay send any message to any object at any time. Which messages we send \nwhen depends on what we want the objects to do. However, good objects \nbehave according to spec regardless of the order in which the methods \nare invoked. They do not say some method sequences are legal and some \nare illegal. This is because the classes and objects are the fundamental \nunits, not the functions and algorithms. This is the difference between \nobject oriented programming and procedural programming.\n\n-- \nElliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nXML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim\n\n",
