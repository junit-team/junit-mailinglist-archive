If you use the Interface Segregation\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Principle, you can&#39;t pass an IAccount2 to someone expecting an\n&gt; &gt; &gt; IAccount.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Which makes this principle fairly useless in my opinion...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; You can, if the object you are passing derives from both IAccount  \n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; IAccount2...\n&gt;\n&gt; Sure, but the client code won&#39;t be able to do that since it was  \n&gt; written\n&gt; before IAccount2 was released.\n\nIf you want to call the new method that&#39;s in IAccount2 then you&#39;ll  \nhave to modify the client code anyway.  If you don&#39;t want to call the  \nnew method provided by IAccount2 then there is no need to change the  \nclient.\n\n\n----\nRobert C.
