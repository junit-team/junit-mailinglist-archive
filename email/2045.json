It&#39;s a simple enough thing (I<br/>\n&gt;think) that it should not be impossible to do.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I have studied the pluggability in JUnit and developped a first <br/>\nprototype.  What I have done is creating a basic runner that separates <br/>\nTextRunner and UIRunner from the JUnit core business.  My experience is <br/>\nthat it requires some changes but it is absolutely feasible.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are familiar with the internal JUnit business, here is how it works:<br/>\n- the CoreRunner registeres itself as a TestListener to the TestResult <br/>\n(in fact there is now only one TestListener)<br/>\n- Plug-in modules register themselves as CoreListener to the CoreRunner<br/>\n- TestListener&#39;s events are passed to the plug-ins via the CoreListener <br/>\ninterface<br/>\n- new events (like when the runner starts/stops running the tests) are <br/>\nalso passed via the CoreListener interface<br/>\n<br/>\nNow for the &quot;count-assert&quot; mechanism: I don&#39;t think that adding a <br/>\nplug-in is the way to go.  The easiest way is to declare a static <br/>\nvariable in the Assert class.  This variable is accessible by the <br/>\nCoreRunner and adding methods to handle this variable in the CoreRunner <br/>\nobject is not a problem.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Vladimir</div>",
