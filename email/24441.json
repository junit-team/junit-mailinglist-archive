It seems that JUnit scans classes and superclasses for tests, but not interfaces. I added logic to look for non-abstract methods in interfaces, and are annotated as tests.<div>\n\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/motlin/junit/compare/junit-team:master...master\">https://github.com/motlin/junit/compare/junit-team:master...master</a><br></div><div><br></div><div>I was able to make this change and keep -source 1.5 and -target 1.5, because it only relies on older reflection capabilities. It&#39;s just that before Java 8, all declared methods on an interface would be abstract. However, the test I wrote uses Java 8, of course.</div>\n\n<div><br></div><div>Please let me know what you think of this feature, and the approach I took.</div></div></div>",
