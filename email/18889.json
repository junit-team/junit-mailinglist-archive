I think that when I was in school<br/>\n&gt;  there was this unspoken assumption that, well, to write code you have to<br/>\n&gt;  be smart and if you&#39;re smart you&#39;ll be able to keep the whole system in<br/>\n&gt;  your head anyway -- using tests as change detectors would be seen as a<br/>\n&gt;  sign of weakness. I guess it doesn&#39;t help either that it took a while to<br/>\n&gt;  make rapid builds possible also. We had to get past batch processing, etc.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Anyway, I hope that the encapsulation balance changes. I&#39;ve been doing a<br/>\n&gt;  lot thinking on it recently and I&#39;ll be presenting a session called &#39;API<br/>\n&gt;  Design As If Unit Testing Mattered&#39; at SDWest and SPA2007. It&#39;s really<br/>\n&gt;  all about the fact that it&#39;s obvious that most commercial API designers<br/>\n&gt;  haven&#39;t thought about how to make it possible to write unit tests for<br/>\n&gt;  code that uses their APIs. I&#39;m going to show some glaring examples in<br/>\n&gt;  Java, C++, and C#, and talk about some alternatives.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s a neat name for a presentation.  I had to cancel my<br/>\npresentation at SDWest unfortunately (I&#39;ll be speaking at QCon at that<br/>\ntime), so I&#39;ll miss it, but I hope I&#39;ll get to attend at some point.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am currently writing a book and this encapsulation/testing tension<br/>\nhas a big section dedicated to it.  Even now, I still find myself<br/>\nhaving to do some convincing whenever I try to tell people that it&#39;s<br/>\nokay to remove &quot;final&quot; or make a private method &quot;package protected&quot; if<br/>\nit means that it will receive more testing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the pendulum will swing back eventually and that we will find<br/>\na happy medium between the two goals.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nCédric<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://testng.org\">http://testng.org</a></div>",
