Don&#39;t test protected  an=\r\nd package-protected methods.\n\nA quote from the XP discussion  group.\n(http:=\r\n//208.48.218.9/group/extremeprogramming/message/13213)\n\n&quot;I  actually do thi=\r\nnk that it is cut and dried. Public members have\nbehavior that is expected =\r\nof them by their clients. Tests can be used  to\ndefine that behavior and de=\r\nmonstrate that a particular method exhibits  it.\nPrivate methods are, by de=\r\nfinition, implementation details. Their  behavior\ncan vary freely so long a=\r\ns the public methods don&#39;t break. Put  another\nway:\nif every public method =\r\nhas been proven to behave correctly  then the class\nhas been proven to be b=\r\nug free. Therefore, there is never  a need to test\nthe private members of a=\r\n class.&quot;\n\nSo can you avoid  testing them? If so, then don&#39;t; if not, then y=\r\nou can&#39;t\nhave it both  ways: either the tests are in the class (to test pri=\r\nvate\nmethods),\nin  the package (to test protected/package methods) or you c=\r\nan&#39;t test\nthose\nmethods. There&#39;s no magic here...\n\nGood luck,\n\nJ. B.
