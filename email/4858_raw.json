(Pause.) Wait, maybe I do. I\n&gt; use\n&gt; &gt; my knowledge of the current implementation that passes the current\n&gt; &gt; tests to decide what test to write next, if any. Is that what you\n&gt; mean?\n&gt; \n&gt; Right. Imagine the simple case that the test passes although a certain\n&gt; getter returns a constant string. It&#39;s obvious then that something in\n&gt; the code is\n&gt; not perfect yet - a strong indicator for a missing test.\n\nTrue, but this is more an issue of knowing whether the implementation is &quot;fake&quot; \nor not. That&#39;s a special case. In the case of two competing implementations \nthat both *at least try* to meet the requirements, it&#39;s best to have tests that \ncan&#39;t tell the difference between the two.\n\n&gt; My point: The term &quot;black-box&quot; or &quot;specification-based&quot; has two aspects:\n&gt; \n&gt; (1) usage: only use the public interface of the component under test)\n&gt; (2) knowledge: only use the specification of external behaviour to\n&gt; derive\n&gt; test cases\n&gt; Whereas (1) is at least a goal to strive for, (2) is IMO not valid for\n&gt; &quot;unit\n&gt; tests&quot; as used in test-first development.\n\nAgain, I&#39;m not sure I agree with your second point. (Could there be a pattern \nhere? :) In TDD, test cases are not derived from an implementation; instead, \nthey drive the implementation. (Hence Test-Driven Development.) The best tests \nare ones that:\n\n* Test everything that could possibly break in the current implementation\n* Are sufficiently implementation-independent to support easier refactoring\n* Run quickly, are small, easy to read...\n\nI realize that these are competing forces, so the challenge is striking the \nright balance. I find my life difficult when my tests get in the way of my \nrefactorings... tests that have intimate knowledge of the implementation tend \nto be refactoring-resistant. I tend away from them if I can.\n\nJ. B. (Joe) Rainsberger\nPresident, Diaspar Software Services\nhttp://www.diasparsoftware.com\nLet&#39;s write software that people understand.\n\n",
