None. Zip Zero. Zilch. Not even once.\n\nI have seen many, many developers discouraged from using libraries that \nwere too complex and confusing. Size of the public API is part of that \ncomplexity.\n\n&gt; Actually, most of the time, it is.  I mentioned MIDP1 above, but even if you\n&gt; are thinking of open-source libraries, modifying the source means forking\n&gt; the code most of the time, with all the maintenance nightmare that ensue.\n\nBut possible, which is why open source libraries are preferable.\n\n&gt; You seem to be living in a world where every author of any imaginable\n&gt; library is magically available and willing to make the changes you need when\n&gt; you ask for them right away.\n\nIn general, they are, provided you&#39;re willing to pay a market rate for \ntheir time. Of course, if you want people to do things for free, then \nyou might have to wait a little longer (or not. Depends on the project.)\n\nOne of the principles of JUnit is to do the simplest thing that could \npossibly work. That principle goes deeper than test-driven development \nthough. It applies in a lot of areas including API design. You&#39;re \nadvocating big upfront design, which I thought was an idea we had laid \nto rest, at least in this group. Designing an API in advance of the uses \nto which the API will be put is not only more work. It&#39;s also going to \nproduce a worse API because whatever you do design won&#39;t fit the use \ncases. It&#39;s only when you have a clear picture of what the users \nactually need to do that you can create the right API to fit the problem.\n\n-- \n﻿Elliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nXML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim\n\n",
