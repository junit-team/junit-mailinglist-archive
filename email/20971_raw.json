I have searched\nhigh and low=\r\n to find an answer to this question, and unfortunately the\nonly information=\r\n I have been able to obtain is how to run an\nindividual test from within th=\r\ne Eclipse GUI (or by using the @Ignore\nannotation and recompiling source).\n=\r\n\nIs this possible?  If so, how?  If not, is it possible by using\nsomething =\r\nother than JUnitCore?  Just to be super clear, say I have a\ntest class Calc=\r\nulatorTest with several test methods.  I want to be\nable to run CalculatorT=\r\nest.multiply, not just all of the methods in\nCalculatorTest.\n\nThanks in adv=\r\nance.\n\n\n",
