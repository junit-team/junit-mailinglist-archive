Whatever the failure is, keep adding asserts about \nanything you can think of regarding the expected state of the app and \nobjects under test.  Even (especially?) add ones for things you may \nthink are obviously working correctly.  This may give you some clues to \nthe problem.\n\nDavid Corbin wrote:\n&gt; I&#39;ve got one tests which fails sporadically, and I cannot figure out any \n&gt; reason for it to be non-deterministic in MY code.
