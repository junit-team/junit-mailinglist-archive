B. Rainsberger<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I have never used TestNG; however, based on what I have seen, <br/>\n&gt; read and what Cedric has told me, I would use TestNG mostly <br/>\n&gt; to add tests to Legacy Code (any code I&#39;m afraid to change) <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think TestNG&#39;s scope is broader than that.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy understanding of &quot;unit testing&quot; is that it is supposed to exercise one<br/>\nclass.  Exactly one. You test the internal, public and private methods, make<br/>\nsure it&#39;s healthy and that you didn&#39;t break anything at the most fundamental<br/>\nlevel.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnything including logic that involves more than one class is no longer<br/>\nconsidered unit testing.  It can be called integration, acceptance,<br/>\nfunctional, etc...  but it&#39;s no longer unit testing.<br/>\n<br/>\nReal code relies on dependencies all the time:<br/>\n<br/>\n- A certain object can only be created if a previous object has been created<br/>\nbefore.<br/>\n- This method can only be invoked if such field has been initialized.<br/>\n- etc...<br/>\n<br/>\nIt makes a lot of sense to me that my tests should reflect this complexity<br/>\nso they can run my real code.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am a firm believer that tests should be as close as possible to production<br/>\ncode.  I don&#39;t know about you, but:<br/>\n<br/>\n- I am nervous when I run my tests on Postgresql and the production site<br/>\nruns on Oracle.<br/>\n<br/>\n- I feel ever worse when my tests are using mocks, because not only are<br/>\nmocks non trivial to write (and they require you to maintain a parallel line<br/>\nof code), they can give you a deadly sense of security.  And then one day,<br/>\nyour mock tests run fine but the production code breaks, and you enter a<br/>\nworld of pain.  Trust me, it&#39;s not pretty.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith all that in mind, it makes sense to have a testing framework that takes<br/>\ndependencies into account and makes it as easy as possible for you to:<br/>\n<br/>\n- Identify which test *really* broke (compare &quot;1 SUCESS 25 FAILED&quot; to &quot;1<br/>\nSUCCESS 1 FAILED and 23 SKIPS&quot;).<br/>\n- Allow you to rerun the failed tests easily, including all the dependencies<br/>\nif any<br/>\n<br/>\nThese are the main features that TestNG offers (and many more of course<br/>\n:-)).<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nCédric<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://beust.com/weblog\">http://beust.com/weblog</a></div>",
