I believe the idea is a\nuseful one (once they get past the name and the logo ;-).\n\nI understand that this is a work in process, and therefore don&#39;t plan\nto beat you up over exact coefficient and exponent values until I&#39;ve\nhad some more experience with it myself. Thanks for taking the first\nsteps.\n\nOne question which I&#39;ve heard multiple times is, &quot;Now what?&quot; I think\nit would be great if the web site had content (even if wiki-mediated)\ndescribing common patterns / code structures which cause a high\nC.R.A.P. index and suggestions for corrective action. Many of my\nco-workers don&#39;t spend their days thinking about cyclomatic complexity\nand don&#39;t want to start by reading up on graph theory. Ergo a few\n&quot;case study&quot; examples would be helpful, showing before-and-after code\nwhere C.R.A.P. index drops and the resulting code is clearly more\nmaintainable.\n\nFinally, I&#39;d really like to be able to get more information on how the\ntesting measurement is derived (and the resulting side-effects). In\none project with lots of unit tests, including some which persisted\nresults to disk, the output directories were left in a state I did not\nexpect/understand. Knowing some of the basics here would be helpful to\nsomeone who wants to take effective action as a result of the reported\nindex.\n\nAgain, thanks for your work on the tool. I hope to see more from it.\n\n-jn-\n\n-- \nProgramming is the art of writing essays in crystal clear prose and\nmaking them execute. - Per Brinch Hansen\n\n",
