I was hoping I was doing something\ni=\r\ndiotically silly and would be obvious to others. Alas...\n\nYes, I am using a=\r\nnt under cygwin on windows xp. I have not tried\nrunning from command line, =\r\nnor from within Eclipse, which obviously\nimplies not running from a debugge=\r\nr. I am not sure how I would do that\nin Eclipse, to tell you the truth. I h=\r\nave never done this, but see my\njunit recipes book discusses running tests =\r\nfrom within eclipse. I&#39;ll\ngive that a try later today.\n\nI did comment out t=\r\nhe various AllTests and found the offender. That\nAllTest only executed one =\r\ntest. So, I added a target for the one\noffending test class. When running t=\r\nhat, the response is the same as\nbelow. It appears to be not running the te=\r\nst at all.\n\nI am using the ant junit command. I doubt the problem is in the=\r\n ant\nscript as there are several targets that do work, and even the one\nAll=\r\nTest works as long as I comment out the offending reference to\nAllTest with=\r\nin that class.\n\nI want this to work, of course, but I have to meet prod sch=\r\nedules so\nI&#39;ve tested in other ways. \n\nI&#39;ll post a reply once I&#39;ve tried yo=\r\nur suggestions. In the meantime,\nif you think of any other suggestions, I&#39;d=\r\n appreciate it.\n\nBill\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;David Saff&quot; &lt;saff@...=\r\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Bill,\n&gt; \n&gt; On the face of it, there&#39;s nothing that seems obvio=\r\nusly wrong, nor can I\n&gt; think of a common mistake that would lead to that b=\r\nehavior.  There&#39;s a\n&gt; couple ways to drive debugging from here, in order:\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; 1) It looks like you&#39;re using ant.  Does either suite run from the\ncomm=\r\nand\n&gt; line, or from within an IDE like Eclipse?\n&gt; 2) Can you run the suite =\r\nin a debugger (say, in Eclipse)?\n&gt; 3) Can you &quot;delta debug&quot; by commenting o=\r\nut lines in the offending\nsuite, and\n&gt; drive down to a particular problem c=\r\nlass?\n&gt; 4) What ant command are you using?\n&gt; \n&gt; Good luck,\n&gt; \n&gt;    David Sa=\r\nff\n&gt; \n&gt; On 11/6/06, bill turner &lt;bill.turner@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Running Ju=\r\nnit 3.8.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I have an AllTests class that does not run after adding a =\r\nnew suite.\n&gt; &gt; Here is the top level AllTest code:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;snip&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; p=\r\nublic static Test suite () throws Exception\n&gt; &gt; {\n&gt; &gt; TestSuite suite =3D n=\r\new TestSuite(&quot;all powerpick tests&quot;);\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; suite.addTest(com.rjmdental.po=\r\nwerpick.types.test.AllTests.suite());\n&gt; &gt;    suite.addTest(com.rjmdental.po=\r\nwerpick.input.test.AllTests.suite());\n&gt; &gt; //\n&gt; &gt; suite.addTest(com.rjmdenta=\r\nl.powerpick.sequence.test.AllTests.suite());\n&gt; &gt; return suite;\n&gt; &gt; }\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &lt;/snip&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; When the last one is uncommented my run changes from:\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &lt;snip&gt;\n&gt; &gt; test_powerpick:\n&gt; &gt;     [junit] Running com.rjmdental.power=\r\npick.test.AllTests\n&gt; &gt;     [junit] Tests run: 58, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, T=\r\nime elapsed:\n0.25 sec\n&gt; &gt;     [junit] Testsuite: com.rjmdental.powerpick.te=\r\nst.AllTests\n&gt; &gt;     [junit] Tests run: 58, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Time ela=\r\npsed:\n0.25 sec\n&gt; &gt;     .\n&gt; &gt;     .\n&gt; &gt;     .\n&gt; &gt; &lt;/snip&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; to:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &lt;snip&gt;\n&gt; &gt; test_powerpick:\n&gt; &gt;     [junit] Running com.rjmdental.powerpic=\r\nk.test.AllTests\n&gt; &gt; &lt;/snip&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I have compared the &quot;sequence&quot; AllTest =\r\nto the &quot;input&quot; AllTest and see\n&gt; &gt; no significant difference.
