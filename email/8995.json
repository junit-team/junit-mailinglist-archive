I looked over all of the emails and none of them mentioned it was noise - or even implied that it was nothing more than noise. The only thing that came close was a conversation that traffic was heavier then normal and some other email questions may have slipped through the cracks.<br/>\n\tYou can&#39;t jump into a group ready to find insult and slight around the nearest corner just because not everyone agrees with your position. If you are looking for a junit advocacy group then this group probably isn&#39;t it - this is more of a discussion and help/best-practices type of group. Are there disagreements among list-members, of course - do they discuss them openly, of course - do the members dig for the smallest believed insult, no we are all adults here and understand that email is not the perfect medium for discussions and intent is often masked behind the words.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nChip<br/>\n-----<br/>\nProgramming: Its not just a job - its an indenture <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Adam Jack [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ajack@...\">ajack@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, August 01, 2003 4:48 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Sorry for the noise ... (was RE: [junit] ClasspathWalker (even<br/>\nbetter))<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> \t&gt; I bet it&#39;s related to a phenomenon I&#39;ve been struck by the past day or<br/>\n </span></blockquote>so:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> \t&gt;<br/>\n\t&gt; There have been so many posts to this email group between now and<br/>\n </span></blockquote>yesterday that I deleted a bunch without reading them.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> \t&gt; Others may have done the same.  \tNot to mention we&#39;ve had one original<br/>\n </span></blockquote>thread spawn into at least 3 other threads,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> \t&gt; which have been responsible for most of the traffic.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m sorry for what you consider noise. I guess I got involved in the<br/>\ndiscussion, I thought it was (at times) useful. Since it was my first<br/>\nposting (and heck, I was throttled by moderation) how was I to know that you<br/>\ndidn&#39;t want discuss on the list.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> \t&gt; I&#39;d suggest some folks should think more between posts or take a<br/>\n </span></blockquote>discussion offline until things are resolved,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> \t&gt; then come back with a summary.  But this is so unusual for this list<br/>\n </span></blockquote>(thinking over the past few years),<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> \t&gt; it will probably return to normal soon by themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;d like to think I&#39;ve been thinking, but hmm ... let me think about that<br/>\nsome more ... Yup, I&#39;m pretty sure I was. You judge so harshly yet you admit<br/>\nyou deleted much of what was there. Couldn&#39;t you have just kept on deleting<br/>\nand kept this to yourself? No, I guess you want a quiet mailing list. Ok,<br/>\nyou win -- I&#39;m done.<br/>\n<br/>\nEvery other OSS list I know says discuss here, not in private, the<br/>\ndiscussion is part of the process & best archived for reference. Clearly the<br/>\nmain two noise producers failed to come to a summary, so observation by<br/>\nother was needed. A bunch of folks jumped in with what I considered<br/>\ninteresting perspectives, I was grateful for that, even if to you viewed it<br/>\nas more noise.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;\t+1<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>-1 -- but hey, I clearly don&#39;t fit here. I thought I was discussing<br/>\nsomething of small potential with the development team of junit, but I<br/>\nclearly got that all wrong. I guess from that mistaken hypothesis all<br/>\nconclusion is obviously worthless, so I should&#39;ve just given up when I<br/>\nthought about giving up.<br/>\n<br/>\nI learned a lot from these threads, just little of it was about junit & most<br/>\nof it was about this list&#39;s participants.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo more noise from me...<br/>\n<br/>\nregards<br/>\n<br/>\nAdam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!
