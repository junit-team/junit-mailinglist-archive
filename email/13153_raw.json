We use a very unknown (and very bad in my\n&gt; opinion) framework called JCoffee which uses Entity\n&gt; Beans (CMP of course) internally.\n&gt; \n&gt; Since I don&#39;t know very much about &quot;native&quot; Entity\n&gt; Beans, it is maybe hard to describe to you our design.\n\nIt&#39;s not so important how data access happens. (This is what I mean by \nthe previous comment.) What matters is that it happens behind an \ninterface that your data access clients (business logic, usually) can \nsubstitute at run time.\n\n&gt; Okay, I&#39;ll read Chapter 11 and come back to you if it\n&gt; doesn&#39;t solve my question.\n\nI&#39;ll do my best.\n\n&gt; But can you (or someone else) please tell me this:\n\n&gt; - Do you test validation rules with JUnit (such as\n&gt; maxLength(10))?\n\nWhat does it mean to test these validation rules? Pretend you could do \nit easily; what would the test look like? This will help me understand \nenough to respond.\n\n&gt; - Do you test your Java finder methods (internally EJB\n&gt; QL, HQL, SQL or whatever)?\n\nI generally need to know whether the implementation of the finder \nreturns the proper result set, so yes.\n\n&gt; - Do you test pre-initializations of business objects\n&gt; instances (like Article, Customer...)?\n\nCan you say this differently? I don&#39;t understand it as is.\n-- \nJ. B. (Joe) Rainsberger\nDiaspar Software Services\nhttp://www.diasparsoftware.com\nAuthor, JUnit Recipes: Practical Methods for Programmer Testing\n\n",
