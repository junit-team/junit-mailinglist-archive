JUnit is a bit off on <br/>\nit&#39;s founder&#39;s XP credentials, and part of that seems to be an allergy <br/>\nto Maven.  We should be able to release JUnit from a button on a build <br/>\nserver :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 08/09/2011 22:43, Stefan Birkner wrote:<br/>\n&gt; The information about JUnit is across three different places: junit.org, junit.sourceforge.net and github.

This makes it easier to find the information and JUnit would look more professional. IMHO the github pages are a good place for the JUnit documentation, because we can use all the git(hub) features for creating the documentation.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What do you think?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Stefan Birkner<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
