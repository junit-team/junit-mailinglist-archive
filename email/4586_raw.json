Most of my &quot;factory&quot; unit tests feed the\nfactory various types of inputs and verify the created object(s) are\ncorrect.  I don&#39;t bother testing individual methods, but rather I test\nbehavior.  If I can&#39;t test a certain type of behavior, I break out code into\nother classes until I can test that behavior.\n\nFor example, I would never test the sortByDptrDate method directly.  I would\nbuild an itinerary and verify that the returned object is sorted by\ndeparture date.\n\nThe createUniqueItins and createAllItins methods seem like &quot;strategies&quot; to\nme.  Could you turn those methods into separate classes with their own\ntests?  The ItinBuilder would use the strategies, but the strategy code\nwould be tested elsewhere.\n\nI&#39;m a bit confused about how this class is actually used.  There is one\npublic method with no return values.  How does a client get an itinerary\nafter it&#39;s built?  Maybe an example of some client code would help the\ndiscussion.\n\nMatt\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Nilesh Thali [mailto:nilesh.thali@...]\nSent: Wednesday, April 03, 2002 10:26 AM\nTo: junit\nSubject: [junit] Design question: was Testing Private Methods\n\n\nFolks,\nWould greatly appreciate some help here:\nIf this is not the right forum, do let me know.\n\nI&#39;d like to take a piece of code and get suggestions on how to do it\ndifferently:\nConsider a class called ItinBuilder.\nGiven a bunch of flight legs, it builds itineraries. Simple enough.\nExcept:\n1. it can have alternate legs e.g going from A to B at different times.\n2. have to differentiate departing itins from return itins\n    e.g. A-B-C -&gt; departing\n           C-A    -&gt; return\n           C-B-A -&gt; return\netc. etc.\nTo cut a long story short, assume i have put the following methods\npublic class ItinBuilder\n{\n    public void buildItins(segment[] segs);\n\n    private sortByDptrDate();\n    private identifyDupeSegs();\n    private createUniqueItins();  // ignores duplicates\n    private createAllItins();        // builds all itins based on the\nunique itins using dupes\n}\n\nSo really, a &quot;client&quot; only needs to call buildItins(), but the real work\nhappens in the\nprivate methods which therefore need to be tested.\nAssumption:\nwe&#39;d like to keep our tests in a separate package.\n\nAny suggestions are greatly appreciated. Sorry about the length of this\ne-mail.\nNilesh\n\n\n\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\njunit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n \n\nYour use of Yahoo!
