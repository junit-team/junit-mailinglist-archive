It is a \ndiscussion of how to implement DBC in Java.  I was alerted to it by the \nlatter link:\n\nhttp://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-02-2002/jw-0215-dbcproxy.html\nhttp://www.geocities.com/eliassonaand/project-home.html\n\nI am not advocating this approach.  I have first heard about DBC during \nthe &quot;JUnit considered problematic&quot; discussion here.  Personally I like \nusing JUnit.\n\nEither way I thought the article on how DBC could be applied to Java \nmight help inform our discussion.  The article describes a way of \ngenerating test cases from pre-conditions, post-conditions and \ninvariants in the javadoc /** */  comments before each class.\n\nThis certainly seems interesting to me.  I certainly wouldn&#39;t use it as \na replacement for junit, but I would very much like to formalise the \nrelationship between method description, unit test and class documentation.\n\nIt seems to me that these DBC statements don&#39;t cover the full range of \npossibilities covered by well-written tests in junit, but what would be \ninteresting would be to think about how to specify/document the range of \nunit tests that a method or code segment must pass within the code itself.\n\nCHEERS&gt; SAM\n\n\n\n\n",
