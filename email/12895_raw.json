I have been attempting to find an effective framework\n&gt; that extends junit&#39;s capability to Web app testing. There are numerous\n&gt; but in my mind their effectiveness is in question.\n&gt; \n&gt; Recently I have been trying to create a sample of automated tests for\n&gt; our enterprise web application running on Oracle 9IAS. The application\n&gt; is quite complex and uses Javascript extensively.\n&gt; My purpose is to create a test that mimics the steps in a `Change\n&gt; Request&#39; or `Defect&#39; . This would be created by the\n&gt; developer and\n&gt; executed before and after the bugfix/change. Therefore I needed a java\n&gt; based framework with which to create the test cases.\n&gt; \n&gt; Since these test case need to test a web application, I researched and\n&gt; finally focused on following three options. Note that while there are\n&gt; bunch of tools/frameworks, I did not find any big winners.\n\nI&#39;m surprised. Here&#39;s my standard toolset:\n\n  * XhtmlUnit to test the web UI in isolation with a sane page template \nlanguage (not JSP).\n  * HtmlUnit to test end to end through the web UI when I need it.\n  * MockEJB when I need a fake JNDI context (damn Service Locator \nantipattern).\n  * Cactus when I need to test CMP entity beans or JSPs.\n  * ServletUnit to test the glue code between servlets and my classes.\n\nPlain JUnit for everything else.\n\nIf you&#39;re not sure where to start, go with HtmlUnit and Cactus. When you \nget annoyed with running server-side tests, focus on refactoring to \nenable out-of-container testing, rather than searching for the next \ngreat test tool.\n\nGood luck.\n-- \nJ. B.
