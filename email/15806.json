They are easy to think out an<br/>\n&gt; assertion.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; But for most methods, how can we decide whether write an assertion with<br/>\n&gt; the original method or assertTrue(/assertFalse)?<br/>\n&gt; Please give me some help on writing the assertion.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I imagine you need to write assertions for a specific method in your <br/>\nsystem. Think about that method. I claim it works. How do you check my <br/>\nclaim? What do you look for? Imagine you can do anything you want to <br/>\ntest it, what would you do?<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
