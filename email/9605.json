And yes, I<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;&gt; know there is &#39;absolute&#39; zero but ask any statistician and he will<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;&gt; tell you that using ratios with our normal temperature scales is<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;&gt; simply wrong.  Using ratios with time works if you are using timed<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;&gt; tests and define &#39;zero&#39; as no time.  Then yes, 5 minutes is twice as<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;&gt; slow as 10 minutes.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 5 minutes is twice as *slow* as 10 minutes?  While that might be<br/>\n&gt; technically accurate from a narrow mathematical definition of &quot;twice as<br/>\n&gt; slow&quot;, I doubt most readers of English would interpret it that way.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, it&#39;s wrong: anything that happens in five minutes happens twice as <br/>\nquickly as if it happened in ten minutes. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nSaying that &quot;5 minutes is slow&quot; is the problem. Minutes are not slow, or <br/>\nfast. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nHey... we can *all* be pedantic.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; In general when making comparisons, I take &quot;faster&quot; to mean less time<br/>\n&gt; and &quot;slower&quot; to mean more time.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Not just you. :)<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ.
