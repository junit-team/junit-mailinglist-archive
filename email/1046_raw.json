But I don&#39;t believe that 100% \ncoverage is important.  My experience has been\nthat you get about 30% coverage by doing almost\nany testing at all.  That is almost a freebee.\nGoing from 30% to 60% coverage is a huge win\nin terms of finding bugs, and is absolutely the\nsecond kind of testing you should do.  Getting\ncoverage numbers up from 60% to 80%-90% is \nvaluable too, but you need to juggle this value\nagainst other valuable forms of testing.\n(Load testing, for example.)  So you may want\nto do load testing after your coverage numbers\nare at 60%, but before you push them to 80%.\nMoving above 80%-90% coverage takes a lot of\nwork, and may not be cost effective.\n\nI think going from 30% to 60% testing coverage\nis the second kind of testing you should do.\nThe first kind is what I call &quot;user first\nexperience testing&quot;.  You can&#39;t really do this\nwith junit (unfortunately).  Basically this is\ntaking someone who has never used the product\nbefore, and watching them find/install/learn/use\nthe product for the first time.  That is the \nmost valuable form of testing, because it is\nabsolutely the first thing all customers will\ndo with you product.\n\nJoshua Levy\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
