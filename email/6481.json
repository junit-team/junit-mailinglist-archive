The idea is that the system assumes that the programmer will<br/>\nonly send messages to objects that understand them, and raise an<br/>\nexception when that doesn&#39;t happen.<br/>\n<br/>\nI find it unlikely that I intentionally send a message to an object<br/>\nthat doesn&#39;t understand it. That only seems to happen when I try to use<br/>\nthird-party libraries that I don&#39;t understand yet, and that&#39;s why I<br/>\nwrite Learning Tests.
