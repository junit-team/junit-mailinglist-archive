Also take into\n&gt;  &gt; consideration the number of posts we already reject, because\n&gt;  &gt; the questions are too basic.\n&gt; \n&gt; Wow, I did not realize that there are posts getting\n&gt; actively rejected!  If this is a moderated list,\n&gt; it seems like the moderators could easily reply\n&gt; to the &quot;whats junit&quot; type of questions with a link\n&gt; to the FAQ and never pass those on to the rest of\n&gt; the group.\n\nAre you volunteering to moderate? We already reject job offers for \nIndian companies, a majority of &quot;What&#39;s X?&quot; questions as well as \ncompletely off-topic things like dating services and pictures of naked \nwomen. You could certainly help, if you like.\n\n&gt;  &gt; If we don&#39;t encourage the\n&gt;  &gt; general public to post their questions, then who will we have\n&gt;  &gt; to discuss interesting topics with in a few years?\n&gt; \n&gt; Perhaps I&#39;m self-centered, because I expect others\n&gt; to take the same general approach to learning a new\n&gt; technology that I do, which is:  read what I can\n&gt; about it until I get stuck, then read more from a\n&gt; different author, and if I&#39;m still stuck, then ask\n&gt; for help.  I believe that the people who do NOT take\n&gt; that approach aren&#39;t likely to be here to discuss\n&gt; the interesting topics in a few years.  I believe\n&gt; that the people who ask the obvious FAQs get just\n&gt; enough info to complete their homework assignment\n&gt; or placate their boss or whatever, and then disappear\n&gt; and don&#39;t participate in further discussions.  But\n&gt; that&#39;s just a hunch.  Maybe I should do a random\n&gt; survey of &quot;not-smart&quot; questions from 2 years ago to\n&gt; see if those people are the ones now actively con-\n&gt; tributing to the discussion here.\n\nI can&#39;t tell whether this response is genuine or facetious. I&#39;ll assume \nit&#39;s genuine.\n\nIf you can really tell which of those stupid question-askers isn&#39;t just \nsome smart, but desperate person who needs a quick answer, then that&#39;s \ngreat. I can&#39;t.\n\nMore to the point, I&#39;ve dealt with those people both ways, and I find \nthat I&#39;m getting better results doing what I&#39;m doing now, rather than \ndoing what I was doing before (one-liner RTFM kind of responses).\n\n&gt; Mike wrote:\n&gt;  &gt; As a newbie user/lurker myself I don&#39;t recall reading the\n&gt;  &gt; FAQ, but have made a note to look it up now... \n&gt; \n&gt; Just today I unsubscribed and then resubscribed,\n&gt; to confirm that the FAQ is automatically emailed\n&gt; to new members.  I wonder if the auto mailer\n&gt; doesn&#39;t work for everyone.\n\nIt&#39;s possible. It&#39;s also possible that we don&#39;t read what looks like \nnoise. Human nature, that.\n\nTake care.\n-- \nJ. B.
