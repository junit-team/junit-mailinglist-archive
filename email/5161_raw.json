I&#39;ve been developing GUIs on a number of platforms for years, \nand I thought I was only doing very basic tool-oriented tasks, but I&#39;ve \nnever done a gui that reduces to a single component with a single \nmessage.  Maybe I just don&#39;t establish the proper concepts in the gui, \nbut I invariably have several things interacting.\n\nYes, the right message gets sent to the Dialog, but the Dialog still \ndoesn&#39;t show up.  Now what?  In my experience, the design space between \ntwo components is where I find the most bugs; it&#39;s rarely either one or \nthe other but usually the interaction of the two that causes the problem \nor unexpected behavior.\n\n\nOn Tuesday, June 11, 2002, at 09:36 AM, Bob Koss wrote:\n\n&gt; On 6/11/02 7:28 AM, &quot;Michael Silverstein&quot; &lt;msilverstein@...&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Bob Koss [mailto:koss@...] wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; But if we use Mediator to decouple the gui controls, we may as\n&gt;&gt;&gt; well delegate\n&gt;&gt;&gt; everything to the Mediator and leave the gui stupid. The Mediator can \n&gt;&gt;&gt; be\n&gt;&gt;&gt; unit tested just like any other class, and doesn&#39;t need the gui since \n&gt;&gt;&gt; all\n&gt;&gt;&gt; communication is done through interfaces.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; That notwithstanding, you still need to test the connection between the\n&gt;&gt; mediator and your GUI. There&#39;s still plenty of room for error there.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m trying to understand your concern. I can test that the Mediator \n&gt; send the\n&gt; right message with the right parameters at the right time. The code in \n&gt; the\n&gt; gui (let&#39;s say a Dialog box just to be concrete) that responds to this\n&gt; message is one or two lines of code which IMO, can&#39;t break.\n&gt;\n&gt; Can you show me in a few lines of code where there is room for error \n&gt; between\n&gt; the Mediator and the gui/dialog/whatever?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt; Robert Koss, Ph.D.     | Training, Mentoring, Contract Development\n&gt; Senior Consultant      | Object Oriented Design, C++, Java\n&gt; www.objectmentor.com   | Extreme Programming\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
