Then when this te=\r\nst \ncase runs, these methods will check something like an environment \nvari=\r\nable to determine whether it should run (like @test) or do nothing (like \n@=\r\nignore).\n\nI figure I have to derive my own test runners to do this (@runWit=\r\nh\n(myTest.class)).  However, since JUnit4ClassRunner is internal and it&#39;s \n=\r\nnot documented, where can I find instructions/documents on what and how \nto=\r\n derive from it?  Or is there a better way to achieve what we need here?\n\nT=\r\nhanks!\n\n\n",
