This year we have a 250 hours project, and my goal in this project is to code on a TINI card the control of some captors and to send some datas to the main database, in addition to that, the user will be able from a distant site, to handle the whole system such as rebooting it and others features to be determined.<br/>\nBut here is my question, I&#39;d like to use JUnit on embedded systems. So as I said on a TINI card. Is there anything special I should know about JUnit compared to basic coding on software?<br/>\nThanks in advance<br/>\nregards</div>",
