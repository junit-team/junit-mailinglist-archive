Identify each place where an instance of the implementation is\ncreated (did not understand this)\n5.\tInside the test case. Find the code that creates the object under\ntest. Move this code into a separate creation method, but store the\ninstantiated object in a reference to the interface, and not the\nimplementation. (I would need an example just for this)\n6.\tRepeat until the test has no more direct references to the\nimplementation by it&#39;s class name.\n7.\tCreate an abstract method in the abstract test case for each\ncreation method you extracted (would this be required in case of an inner\nclass)\n8.\tNow that the test refers only to the interface and other methods in\nthe abstract test case, move the test up into the abstract test case.\n9.\trepeat all steps for each implementation test case, until the only\ntests remaining in the implementation test cases verify\nimplementation-specific behavior (did not quite understand this one)\n\n \n\nSince I did not follow completely what the recipe was, are these two\napproaches same?\n\n \n\nThanks,\n\n-Kamal.\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
