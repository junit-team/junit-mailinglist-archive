I&#39;d say that if 60% of<br/>\n&gt; your logic is in private methods, then chances are very high that<br/>\n&gt; this is true for that code.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Michael Feathers<br/>\n&gt; www.objectmentor.com<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not sure where the statistical cut-off point would be. I&#39;ll have<br/>\nto take your word for it that if 60% (or more) of the code in a class<br/>\nis private implementation then there is reason for suspicion. I know<br/>\nthat if you just count LOC in some of my code that the private<br/>\nimplementation percentage will likely be high. The reason for this, I<br/>\nthink, is that I tend to refactor agressively, extracting methods<br/>\nwhenever I can give even a code fragment (like the test of an if) a<br/>\ngood intention-revealing name.<br/>\n<br/>\nHas anyone suggested the use of code coverage metrics as a way to<br/>\nquell the gotta-testa-private syndrome? When practicing TDD I have<br/>\nfound that private methods really only arise from refactoring of less<br/>\nrestrictively scoped methods. Since extracting a method is really just<br/>\nmoving code within the class, if the code had 100% coverage before the<br/>\ntest it should still have 100% coverage after the test. Are any of the<br/>\nopen source / free code coverage tools particularly worth<br/>\nrecommending?<br/>\n\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://java-source.net/open-source/code-coverage\">http://java-source.net/open-source/code-coverage</a><br/>\n\t<br/>\nJim</div>",
