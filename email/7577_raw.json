I have\n&gt; an accessor method called getUserSession() which is\n&gt; being called from my AssetManagerTestCase class (which\n&gt; extends CMSTestCase). The getUserSession() method is\n&gt; defined in CMSTestCase. \n&gt; \n&gt; The setUserSession() method is called within my setUp()\n&gt; method within CMSTestCase. So the object is being set\n&gt; properly when the setUp() method is called but once my\n&gt; textXXXX() methods start to be executed in my subclass,\n&gt; the object is null.\n&gt; \n&gt; Does anyone know why I&#39;m losing the value of this\n&gt; object when my textXXXX() methods are executed.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you in advance.\n&gt; \n&gt; - Bacon -\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
