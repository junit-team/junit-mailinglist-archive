I&#39;ve learned a lot during this time, thank you\n&gt;all, guys.\n&gt;\n&gt;In this post, I&#39;d like to discuss a problem of test naming. \n&gt;I mean not only test naming, but also naming of test classes, \n&gt;packages and methods. \n&gt;\n&gt;When one starts writing tests for legacy code (or even for new one),\n&gt;there is a common task - find existing tests for some code (if there\nare\n&gt;any), and decide, how to name new tests. Sometimes the task is\nobvious, \n&gt;but not always. Shall one include the name of the class under test \n&gt;into the test class name? Shall one include name of the tested method \n&gt;into testXXX method? Or it depends?\n&gt;\n&gt;As far as I learned, usually we shall test behaviour and design, \n&gt;not specific classes and methods. This allows us to keep tests \n&gt;task-oriented and not implementation-oriented.\n&gt;Considering this, I see the following possible decisions regarding\n&gt;tests organization: \n&gt;\n&gt;1. For Functional tests:\n&gt;    - all tests for a use case (and, possibly, alternative flows) are \n&gt;    placed into a single package with an appropriate name. \n\nGenerally there is one test per use case scenario (different flow\nthrough the use case). Choosing to write more or fewer tests should be\ndone thoughtfully.\n\n&gt;    - each test scenario is placed into single class with appropriate\nname.\n\nEach use case scenario is a test. Test classes should almost always\nevolve based around a fixture, not some other arbitrary organization\nmechanism. A given use case may be implemented as its own Customer Test\nclass, but it is usually better to let the organization of tests into\nTestCase implementations depend on shared fixture requirements.\n\n&gt;2. For Unit tests:\n&gt;    - test package shall be the same as for the production code, \n&gt;    but it is better to use a different source tree.\n&gt;    - for simple classes (such as value objects) it is OK to name\n&gt;    test classes after the name of the class under test \n&gt;    (like UTestFooBar or FooBarTest). Names of test methods,\n&gt;    in its turn, may include the name of the tested method.\n&gt;    - for complex classes, which require a complex fixture to be set,\n&gt;    test case class shall be named using fixture description. \n&gt;    (The issue was discussed previously on this list).\n&gt;    Test method name in this case shall describe the tested behaviour.\n\nThe last point is the general case, and the previous points are special\ncases when the tests (not the code under test) are very simple.\n\n&gt;3. For Integration Tests:\n&gt;    - I suggest, names of Integration tests must differ from Unit\ntests.\n&gt;    Usually, integration tests run longer, and consequently, more\nseldom. \n&gt;    That&#39;s why it is convinient to name them differently. One may name\n\n&gt;    unit tests using UTest prefix, anf Integration tests using ITest\n&gt;prefix.\n\nOn a past project, we used tag interfaces to distinguish Programmer\nTests from Customer Tests. This made it easy to write a TestRunner that\npicked one or the other or both when building a test suite. You may\nfind this technique useful.\n\nAlso, place the different kinds of tests in different packages in order\nto reduce the number of naming collisions.\n\nI have to say that your list of points is excellent and should be\nturned into a short article on the subject.\n\n\nJ.
