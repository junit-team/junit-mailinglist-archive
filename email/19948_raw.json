But has anyone\n&gt;  (like the Apache Jakarta projects, for instance) put out any tools to\n&gt;  make the shenanigans easier to cope with for a casual user?\n&gt;\n&gt;  The only thing stopping me from fetching the JAR file from the ant\n&gt;  script that kicks the tests off is that all the logic for finding the\n&gt;  remote system and copying files from it already exists in Java code\n&gt;  that&#39;s part of my test framework.  So I&#39;d rather do all this from inside\n&gt;  my test case&#39;s superclass, if possible, so I don&#39;t have to duplicate\n&gt;  code.\n\nANT tasks are very simple to write, and typically a lot simpler than\nclassloaders.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;  Also, Hai, your suggestion of using JUnit4&#39;s RunWith is an interesting\n&gt;  one.  I haven&#39;t use these capabilities, so I&#39;ll read up on it.\n\nI was going to suggest that if you can&#39;t do it via ANT, since I think\nwhether you use a custom Runner or use JUnit 3.8, you will be doing\nclassloader work.\n\nI&#39;m not aware of any existing Runner that will introduce a new\nclassloader, but Google might know.\n\nCheers,\n\nJames\n\n",
