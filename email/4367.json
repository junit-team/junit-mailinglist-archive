The final goal would be to have the tool<br/>\ncomparing the class to the test_class and create stubs for new methods<br/>\nwhile leaving the existing ones untouched.<br/>\n<br/>\nBefore I&#39;m going to create it on my own, I wanted to know, if anybody knows<br/>\nabout an existing tool, that does the job?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf it does not exist, is there a good reason, why this automation wouldn&#39;t<br/>\nmake sense? Sometimes for complex function you may need several testcases,<br/>\nbut they can be easely created by taking the first stub and append a<br/>\nnumber...</div>",
