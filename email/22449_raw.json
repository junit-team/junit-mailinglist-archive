Doing so prevents one\ntheory execution from affecting others. I wrote about this issue in\nthe following weblog post:\n\n  http://www.brettdaniel.com/archives/2009/09/24/200845/\n\nYou are correct, though, that copying would avoid some of the overhead\nin calling datapoint methods. It is interesting you mention this idea,\nbecause I am currently overseeing two students who for their senior\nthesis project are implementing framework for copying datapoints. I\nwill post more information to the mailing list as the project\ncontinues.\n\nBrett\n\n",
