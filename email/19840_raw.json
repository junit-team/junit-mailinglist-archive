I believe that mixing languages\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; rather than switching completely from one language to another is\n&gt; going\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to be more and more important. As I explored the subject i found\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; myself lacking some tools. I was frustrated by the fact that I had\n&gt; =\r\nto\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; maintain two sets of tests and look for feedback in two differen=\r\nt\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; locations while developing.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I created a custom ru=\r\nnner for JUnit to address the subject and I\n&gt; think\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it looks promis=\r\ning. I created a blog entry with some more details in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; case anyone i=\r\ns interested:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http://johlrogge.wordpress.com/2007/09/08/hyb=\r\nrid-theory/\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have some loose plans on open-sourcing this b=\r\nut I would like to\n&gt; see\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; if there are others than me that find this=\r\n interesting enough to be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; worth the effort before I do.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; /Joakim Ohlrogge\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yahoo!
