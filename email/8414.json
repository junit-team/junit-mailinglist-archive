However, I have not found an article that explains the<br/>\nadvantages of unit testing vs integration testing.  My perhaps naive hunch<br/>\nis that the cost-per-bug-eliminated of unit testing is higher than that of<br/>\nintegration testing.  It appears this way because a single integration test<br/>\ntests a lot more code than a single unit test and takes about the same<br/>\namount of time to construct.  Plus it seems to me that a whole suite of unit<br/>\ntests with 100% code coverage cannot guarantee that even the simplest system<br/>\nwide behavior is correct (e.g. the web page appears).  Am I wrong about<br/>\nthis?  Can someone refer me information about this topic.  A scientific<br/>\nstudy paper with real numbers would be welcome.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike Bresnahan</div>",
