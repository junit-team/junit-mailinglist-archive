The <br/>\nproblem I see is in the release paste.  On the one hand, you have a <br/>\nframework that must stay stable, and on the other hand optional <br/>\nlibraries that must be released more frequently.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe solution would be yet another project on sourceforge, with <br/>\nguidelines and organization, to be able to release often and only for <br/>\nthe interested users (so no complain that some classes &quot;pollute&quot; JUnit).<br/>\n<br/>\nSame thing for the generation of TestCase files.  Often the proposed <br/>\nsolutions are not meant to be easily parameterized because they were <br/>\ndeveloped for a certain environment.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, it&#39;s maybe time for somebody to step forward.  No, no don&#39;t look <br/>\nat me like that! :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n-Vladimir<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nVladimir Bossicard<br/>\nwww.bossicard.com</div>",
