I understand you are<br/>\n&gt; currently doing this as an exercise, so it&#39;s healthy to take it to<br/>\n&gt; extremes and do everything by the book in order to learn, but in your<br/>\n&gt; real work, use your judgment and decide for yourself when you are<br/>\n&gt; indeed writing too much code, in which case it&#39;s probably safer to go<br/>\n&gt; the usual route (get your code to work, then write tests for it).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The downside of TDD is that you can end up writing a lot of tests for<br/>\n&gt; business code that you quickly throw away and rewrite, so the amount<br/>\n&gt; of churn can be quite high.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m surprised that you quickly throw away business code and rewrite it <br/>\nwhen you have tests. Why wouldn&#39;t you refactor it?<br/>\n<br/>\nIncidentally, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s wise to tell a novice to &quot;use your <br/>\njudgment and decide for yourself&quot; about the areas in which the novice is <br/>\nlearning. If their judgment in that area were sound, they wouldn&#39;t ask <br/>\nsuch elementary questions, on average.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
