It was never designed for that. It was <br/>\n&gt; never designed for that *on purpose*. I don&#39;t know why that is such a big <br/>\n&gt; deal. You don&#39;t like it, that&#39;s cool. Use something else, but don&#39;t mess up <br/>\n&gt; JUnit.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Accessing private fields may go into the same direction, but it can <br/>\nsometimes be quite useful:<br/>\n<br/>\n- what if the state of you objects suddenly become unstable?  For <br/>\nexample, somewhere a private long variable becomes 0 because of some <br/>\nheavy computation and loss of precision (due to / or * for example). <br/>\nYour unit test may still be ok (first iteration of your methods) but it <br/>\nmay be difficult to simulate the 10,000th iteration, or 1,000,000th <br/>\niteration.  Accessing private fields may help you to quickly reset your <br/>\nclasses into some state (like in a debugger).  But maybe JUnit is not <br/>\nthe right tool for this kind of problems.<br/>\n<br/>\n- when testing, you should ensure that the state of your object is valid <br/>\n(pre and post conditions).  If you use private variables and don&#39;t <br/>\nexpose them via getters, it&#39;s difficult to assert their values (assert <br/>\nin Jdk1.4 is nice, inner classes are ugly)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-Vladimir<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nVladimir Bossicard<br/>\nwww.bossicard.com</div>",
