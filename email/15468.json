They are <br/>\n&gt; actually quite high-level. I found dropping out of TDD into unit testing <br/>\n&gt; quite hard and unnatural. Even though the resulting tests are important <br/>\n&gt; to have, i couldn&#39;t help feeling that by not writing the lower-level <br/>\n&gt; unit tests (against say a private method) I was not doing the right thing.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Rakesh,<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s really cool that you&#39;ve tried TDD and found it exciting.  I hope that you<br/>\ncan quickly figure out something that feels like the right thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust to clarify, it sounds like you write a test for some functionality that<br/>\nfeels high-level, and then find it fairly easy to quickly write the code that<br/>\nmakes it pass, but at the end, find yourself with methods that appear to be<br/>\ntested only through tests exercising methods somewhere higher up the call<br/>\nchain, and you feel that it would be important to have tests against those<br/>\nlower-level methods.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are several situations that can drive me to have two &quot;levels&quot; of tests. <br/>\nHowever, I don&#39;t hit these situations on all projects:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Running all the high-level tests takes longer than my attention span<br/>\n(somewhere around 30 seconds on good days, for me).<br/>\n2) It takes a long time to get each high-level test passing (I definitely get<br/>\njumpy after an hour.)<br/>\n3) I can easily think of bugs in the lower-level methods that would not be<br/>\ncaught by the higher-level tests.<br/>\n<br/>\nNotice that I might run into situation 1 after I had been working on a program<br/>\nfor a while.  However, I try to catch situations 2 and 3 as soon as<br/>\npossible--they indicate that I need to adjust the &quot;pacing&quot; of my test-driven<br/>\ndevelopment toward more smaller tests.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I have two levels of tests, it is often the case that I actually have two<br/>\nfailing tests at a time: one high-level failure, and one related low-level<br/>\nfailure.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope that helps.<br/>\n<br/>\n    David Saff</div>",
