Becoz jUnit does not support inheritance for testing the app<br/>\nwhich has deep heierarchy one wouldn&#39;t want to change the design.  But<br/>\nthe points that came out of this discussion were good. I would<br/>\nsummarize it soon so that it would be beneficial for others..<br/>\n<br/>\n~JAK<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Apr 11, 2005 3:43 PM, Andrew McDonagh &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:andrew.mcdonagh@...\">andrew.mcdonagh@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  Ilja Preuss wrote:<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  &gt;Arun J wrote:<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;&gt;Thanks folks..Now I have a (kind of) flat structure for<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;&gt;tests..with one abstract parent without any testXXX under<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;&gt;which all tests would be.  My hierachical requirement is<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;&gt;moved out as hierarchical helpers that are creating test<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;&gt;objects (similar to ObjectMother pattern suggested by IIja).. how<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;&gt;does it sound..? <br/>\n&gt;  &gt;&gt;    <br/>\n&gt;  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;Doesn&#39;t sound ideal, but like it&#39;s probably the best you can do if you<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;want to touch the app&#39;s design.<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Let us not question the design for testing..<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;        <br/>\n&gt;  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;&gt;I didn&#39;t mean to be rude here.<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;&gt;    <br/>\n&gt;  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;No rudeness implied. Still, please notice that not wanting to question the<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;app&#39;s design when encountering testing problems is unlikely to lead to<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;optimal results. Problems in test design most often just are a result of<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;suboptimal app design.<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;&gt;But I wanted to imply that<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;&gt;the app design is done this way for various reasons.<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;&gt;    <br/>\n&gt;  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;Certainly. I&#39;d bet, though, that it&#39;s possible to find a design that<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;conforms to both the needs of testing and those other reasons, and that<br/>\n&gt; most<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;experienced OO developers would say that such a design is better.<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;&gt;But the<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;&gt;tests has to be written around the existing app design.  The<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;&gt;issue in question was the test design not the app design.<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;&gt;    <br/>\n&gt;  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;Then the issue is how to write unit tests for a suboptimally designed app.<br/>\n&gt; I<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;hope you can now understand why Junit doesn&#39;t strive to support that very<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;well out of the box - most Junit practitioners simply prefer to improve<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;app&#39;s design in those cases.<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;Cheers, Ilja<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  Indeed.  Its always tricky adding unit tests to existing code - made <br/>\n&gt;  even harder when that existing code is sub optimally designed.  It would <br/>\n&gt;  be worth Arun getting a copy of Micheal feathers book - &#39;Working <br/>\n&gt;  Effectively With Legacy Code&#39; .<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  One of the important aspects Micheal has identified when retro fitting <br/>\n&gt;  tests, is that sometimes the code will have to be made even more <br/>\n&gt;  suboptimal to allow testing.  However, once its tested, we can then <br/>\n&gt;  start to refactor the design in a safer manner.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/beforeClarity.pdf\">http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/beforeClarity.pdf</a><br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  ________________________________<br/>\n&gt;  Yahoo!
