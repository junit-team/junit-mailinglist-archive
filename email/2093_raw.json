[WAS Re: Why doesn&#39;t JUnit count\nasserts]\n\n\n&gt; Of course, even if the counting is not done in the assert class, the\nassert\n&gt; class still has to be modified to emit the an event or something similar.\n\nand it will be a real mess... I don&#39;t think that plug-ins are the way to go\nfor counting assertions.  If you want to throw events each time you\nevaluates an assert you have to modify the assert class and have static\nlistener.  If you don&#39;t have static listeners, as a TestCase object is\ncreated for each test method, you have to register each listener to the new\nTestCase object... what a mess!\n\nI really think that counting assertions is not an issue.  It&#39;s not because\nyou have x,000 assertions that your program is well tested.  An open-source\ncoverage tool (does one exist?) is the tool to develop.\n\nI am personally against the count of assertions because:\n- the count is not consistant between failed and successful runs\n- the count does not tell you anything about the quality of your tests\n\nAs I said: a coverage tool with automatic coverage % analysis will make\neverybody much happier.\n\nI am ready to change my mind if somebody can prove me that counting\nassertions provides more information than analysing the coverage percentage.\n\n-Vladimir\n\n\n\nYahoo!
