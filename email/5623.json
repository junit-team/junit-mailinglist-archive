I&#39;d be inclined to let all the tests fail once the first one <br/>\ntrips up.  Then I get an opportunity to feel the pain.  In response, I <br/>\nhave to make a decision about whether building more often would be more <br/>\nor less painful.  Without that feedback, I find it&#39;s difficult for me to <br/>\nimprove the process because I miss opportunities for minor course <br/>\ncorrections.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nMike Clark<br/>\nClarkware Consulting Inc.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.clarkware.com\">http://www.clarkware.com</a> <br/>\n(720) 851-2014</div>",
