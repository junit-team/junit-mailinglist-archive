I think the runner concept was an excellent =\r\nand very open-minded move by JUnit-4.x. The runner concept clearly separate=\r\ns test-reporting (i.e. names and results of test-runs) and test-execution (=\r\nwhat happens when a test runs) as two distinctly different concerns.\n\nThere=\r\n is a default runner to support some generally accepted x-unit concepts. I.=\r\ne. execution of test-methods that report a fail-or-error result by throwing=\r\n an exception etc. But the runner concept offers a great opportunity to try=\r\n out other wild ideas about test-execution as well, e.g. tests that don&#39;t h=\r\nave test-methods or exceptions, and have them harnessed as JUnit-tests that=\r\n can be executed with the regular build-tools and IDEs (such as intellij or=\r\n eclipse).\n\nI believe you recently commented on such a &quot;wild idea&quot; that was=\r\n discussed in this forum:\nhttp://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/junit/message/=\r\n24368\n\nIt would be fairly easy to develop those features in a 3rd-party pro=\r\nject and thereafter implement a suitable JUnit-runner, which perhaps could =\r\nbe used like this:\n\n@RunWith(AnnotationDrivenSuiteRunner.class)\n@Annotation=\r\nDrivenSuite({ Foo.class, Bar.class})\npublic class Test_annotation_driven_te=\r\nsting_of_methods_in_Foo_and_Bar {}\n\nThis way it is possible for everyone to=\r\n try out the ideas in IDEs and build-tools without the need to install any =\r\nextra plugins - because to IDEs and build-tools it will all look like regul=\r\nar JUnit-tests.\n\nSo even though JUnit primarily supports certain ideas (tes=\r\nt-methods, rules etc) on how to test Java software, its runner concept keep=\r\ns an open door for anyone who thinks differently and wants to try out alter=\r\nnative ideas.\n\n...\n&gt; If you want a certain behaviour you need to use a spec=\r\nific runner.\n&gt; Often you will want more than just one behaviour. For exampl=\r\ne you\n&gt; may want the spring runner with junit and jparams behaviour.\n&gt; Some=\r\ntimes you will find a way to makr that work. Sometimes you just dont.\n\nAs S=\r\ntephen pointed out there are also rules, which are a better fit for some be=\r\nhaviour, but different rules can still be incompatible. As with everything =\r\nelse it depends on how well the runners and rules are implemented and how t=\r\nhey are used. Sometimes rules or runners can be properly combined with a va=\r\nriety of other rules or runners - and sometimes they don&#39;t manage to perfor=\r\nm in solitude. I have developed CallbackParams, which features a parameteri=\r\nzation runner that can be used like this ...\n\n@RunWith(CallbackParamsRunner=\r\n.class)\n@WrappedRunner(SpringJUnit4ClassRunner.class)\npublic class AParamet=\r\nerizedSpringTest {\n\n... to complement the spring runner or just about any o=\r\nther runner (including many other parameterization runners) with the parame=\r\nterization-features of CallbackParams. So when you write ...\n\n&gt; A rework of=\r\n the runner-concept, introducing something like a\n&gt; chain for the behaviour=\r\n-part would be a good idea, i guess.\n\n... I find it a bit bold, because fro=\r\nm my point of view the runner concept can work as a pretty good fit for &quot;a =\r\nchain for the behaviour-part&quot;. In the CallbackParams docs I have expressed =\r\nit in terms of Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP):\n&quot;JUnit&#39;s annotation @RunW=\r\nith exposes a pointcut. The class CallbackParamsRunner acts as an advice fo=\r\nr this pointcut by making the necessary modifications to the test-class and=\r\n then delegates test-execution back to JUnit&#39;s built-in Runner implementati=\r\non or to the specified third-party implementation, which in turn can be reg=\r\narded as the next advice for the pointcut.&quot;\n\nSo the runner concept allows C=\r\nallbackParamsRunner to apply its advice (i.e. additional behaviour) by maki=\r\nng byte-code modifications, i.e. a pattern that is also used by many ~real~=\r\n AOP-frameworks to apply their advice.\n\nI like to think of rules as other a=\r\ndvices that are applied at other pointcuts by JUnit&#39;s default runner (but w=\r\nithout byte-code modifications). This way runners and rules can form a chai=\r\nn of behaviour by applying advices for different pointcuts.\n\n...\n&gt; This cou=\r\nld either be achieved by introducing a runner that does\n&gt; the work or by in=\r\ntroducing this concept deeper into the framework.\n&gt; How are your thoughts o=\r\nn this?\n\nWell, I am open for new and clever extension points but why not st=\r\nart by developing it as a 3rd-party project that enforce the new features w=\r\nith a new powerful runner? But you need to do a very good job to make me wa=\r\nnt to deprecate today&#39;s runner concept ...\n\n&gt; It could only work well when =\r\nintroduced to junit\n&gt; and the old concept would get marked deprecated as th=\r\nis makes\n&gt; runner-providers like spring migrate to the new concept. I would=\r\n be willing\n&gt; to give it a try and implement this if you think its a good i=\r\ndea.\n\n/Henrik\n\n\n",
