Because that&#39;s a job for Ant.  I bet I&#39;m merely\nmisunderstanding you.  Also, from Ant, it would be easier to extend Ant&#39;s\nrunner to collect test results and post them to a database.  Get that\nfigured out, then extending the Eclipse runner has got to be easier.\n\nAs for tests being run twice in Eclipse, instead of the run configuration\nrunning any and all tests it can find (which includes the suites AND the\ntests individually), you should select the base suite to run.  That will run\nthe tests once.  Alternatively, get rid of the suites, and let Eclipse\nand/or Ant find all your test classes for you.\n\nGood luck,\n-Larry\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Thomas.Bruenjes@...

But in Eclipse run the\ntests twice, because the JUnit plugin gets the suite and\nlet them run. When I choice &quot;Run as Application&quot; in Eclipse the tests run\nonce, but I loose the GUI-Information from JUnit-Plugin.\nHow do I get the TestResult object from Testrunner to participate the\nresults that I need to archive? Overload run (but how an where)? Wrap suite\n(but how an where)?\n\nThanks for help!\nThomas\n\npublic class T8TDHttpTestMain extends TestCase {\n\t\n  static {\n\t\tT8TDConnector TDCo = new T8TDConnector(); // my connection\nclass\n\t\tTDCo.runTest(suite(),&quot;T8TDHttpTestMain&quot;); // do\n&quot;suite.run(testresult);&quot; and \n                                                      // log and write to\nDB.\n  }\n\n  public static void main( String args[] ) {\n     // ... not important\n  }\n\n  public static Test suite() {\n\t\tTestSuite suite = new TestSuite();\n\t\tsuite.addTestSuite(T8TDHttpTestDrv.class);\n\t\treturn suite;\n  }\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nYahoo!
