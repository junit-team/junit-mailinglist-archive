It is easily 80%\n&gt;  &gt; of the solution, if not more.\n&gt; \n&gt; False. You are claiming that a properly designed UI need not be fully\n&gt; tested. This is\n\nRudeness objection. Dial it down a notch, will you?\n\n&gt; * merely speculative: for all your design, if you haven&#39;t tested, you\n&gt;   don&#39;t know that it works. (I might add that the vast majority of\n&gt;   customers care much more that the code they&#39;ve bought works as\n&gt;   specified than that it is well designed.)\n\nPlease lecture someone else about things they already know.\n\n&lt;snip /&gt;\n&gt; I will go so far as to claim, ceteris paribus, better one&#39;s code be\n&gt; thoroughly tested (presuming it passes those tests :-) than well\n&gt; designed. (I will also claim that thorough testing promotes good\n&gt; design, but that&#39;s because I&#39;m a TDD true believer.)\n\nAgreed, however, when I don&#39;t know what to do, I minimize the amount of \nuntested code, which is what a thin GUI is all about. I don&#39;t think you \ncan argue that this is a bad practice. One has to start somewhere.\n\nNow it turns out that the mere act of minimizing the amount of untested \ncode introduces other improvements in the design. This has been my \nexperience, and I&#39;m quite happy with it. This motivates me to continue \nto use this approach, even though the original motivation for it no \nlonger exists.\n\nOf course, now that I have confidence in my ability to test web page \ntemplates in isolation -- something I didn&#39;t have in the past -- I test \nthem. Did you miss that part of what I&#39;d written?\n\nI&#39;d appreciate it if you&#39;d lecture less and discuss more. Perhaps I am \njust being a bit sensitive, but I find your approach a little brusque, \nbordering on rude.\n\nTake care.\n-- \nJ. B.
