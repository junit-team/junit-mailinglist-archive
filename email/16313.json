These days every piece of java<br/>\nsnippet I write has a test attached to it :).<br/>\n<br/>\nI was wondering why there are no assertNotEquals and assertThrows methods in<br/>\nthe Assert class. I have needed something like this many times in my<br/>\ntesting, and have had to fall back to doing assertFalse(a.equals(b)) and a<br/>\nsequence of try-catch-fail, respectively.<br/>\n<br/>\nassertNotEquals seems trivial to me, and assertThrows, in my thougths would<br/>\ntake the exception being expected, or default to Exception.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust wondering if these have come up before, and what the thoughts on them<br/>\nare. If needed, I can try coding them up and get on the developer list.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n- Nitay.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
