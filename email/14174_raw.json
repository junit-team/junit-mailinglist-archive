I bought the PDF form and print\nchapters to read on the train (a lot lighter to carry\nthan a full book).  But I love the ease of use of the\nPDF to go back an find things!  \n\nPlus for me the price was great as shipping to NZ was\nfree ;-)  With my last book purchase from Amazon the\nshipping cost was over half the cost of the book!  The\nprice to pay for living in the best part of the world\nI s&#39;pose :-)\n\n--- Michael &lt;mkoss917@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; I ordered it from Amazon on June 16 and I am still\n&gt; waiting for my copy\n&gt; to ship. Amazon says it will ship by the 22nd, if\n&gt; not, I may cancel\n&gt; the order and buy the PDF version, although I really\n&gt; like having my\n&gt; books in book form, not electronic.\n&gt; \n&gt; Michael.\n\n\n\nShane Mingins\n\nshanemingins@...\n\nplease remove clothes before emailing\n\n\n\n\t\t\n____________________________________________________\nStart your day with Yahoo! - make it your home page \nhttp://www.yahoo.com/r/hs \n \n\n",
