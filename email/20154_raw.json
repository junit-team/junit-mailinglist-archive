This \npost is for the hard and conscientious workers who achieved =\r\nthe rank of managers (i.e. \npeople like your boss).  Work hard and smart an=\r\nd, one day, you too might be a manager.\n\n--- Software managers ONLY beyond =\r\nthis point ---\n\nA lot of software managers, even those smart enough to get =\r\ntheir teams to practice unit \ntesting, are often afraid or reluctant to use=\r\n software metrics to track progress and \ncompliance.\n\nI can understand lazy=\r\n and incompetent developers being afraid of having their work \nmeasured obj=\r\nectively. But, for the life of me, I can&#39;t imagine why someone with the \nsu=\r\nperior brains and skills required to rise from a lowly programmer to the po=\r\nsition of \nmanager would not want to use metrics like code coverage, or lin=\r\nes of unit test code, in \nperforming their sacred duties.  Who are these me=\r\ntricophobics? Methinks that they are \njust spineless namby pambies who can&#39;=\r\nt handle the truth and are afraid of having to take \ndecisive management ac=\r\ntion based on actual facts and figures.\n\nIf you are one of those jelly-fish=\r\n managers who indulges in touchy-feely employee \nreviews and gentle feedbac=\r\nk based on abstract and highly-subjective criteria, you need to \nshape up o=\r\nr get out of software management altogether. We don&#39;t need you, and we don&#39;=\r\nt \nwant you!\n\nHow do you shape up? You can start by watching, and learning =\r\nfrom, a real software \nmanager in action (i.e. me).\n\nIn the following video=\r\n, you can see how I use the time-tested C.R.A.P. software metric to \nhandle=\r\n a developer who refuses to play by the rules.  The C.R.A.P. metric combine=\r\ns code \ncoverage with cyclomatic complexity to detect overly complex code t=\r\nhat is not adequately \ntested.  Do you want overly complex code without tes=\r\nts in your project?  Of course you \ndon&#39;t. Then you better make sure that d=\r\nevelopers don&#39;t get away with it.\n\nHere&#39;s the link to the video: http://you=\r\ntube.com/watch?v=3DJIASiZQR3nI\n\nWatch it and learn. CAPISCE!\n\nAlberto\n\n\n",
