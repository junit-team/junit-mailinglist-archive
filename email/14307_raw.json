I am saying so because i think i had the same concept when i started with it but junit is a unit test a developer has to write for a class that he/she writes . So dont worry about it much and overall its more challenging than the real coding itself and will teach u a lot . For any books you can consult Junit recipies and get going ... All the best \n \nCheers\n \nDanmeet \n\n\t\t\n---------------------------------\n Start your day with Yahoo! - make it your home page \n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
