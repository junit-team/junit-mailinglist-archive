I don&#39;t know what language\nyou&#39;re using, but in Java I&#39;d probably have the class\nthat does the parsing take an InputStream instead of a\nFile.  Either way, the test(s) could create the file\nbeforehand and blast the file when the test is\nfinished.\n\n-Eric\n\n--- &quot;David V. Olivier&quot; &lt;dolivier@...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt; The rule of thumb is that unit tests should be as\n&gt; standalone as possible, \n&gt; and dependencies on external resources such as\n&gt; databases or files should be \n&gt; minimized or eliminated.  This makes perfect sense. \n&gt; Tests which rely on \n&gt; external resources are  not self-contained, are\n&gt; harder to read, and can be \n&gt; broken even if the code is functioning correctly. \n&gt; However, code does touch \n&gt; external resources at some point.  Shouldn&#39;t this be\n&gt; tested, and how?\n&gt; \n&gt; Specifically, I have code that parses a xml catalog\n&gt; file and builds a \n&gt; catalog object structure.  I want to verify that the\n&gt; parsing works \n&gt; correctly.  In particular, I want to make sure that\n&gt; it robustly handles \n&gt; unusual conditions such as catalogs with certain\n&gt; branches missing.  It \n&gt; seems to me that the simplest way to do this is to\n&gt; have a test which uses \n&gt; the parsing code to parse a very simple catalog and\n&gt; verifies that it builds \n&gt; what I expect it to.\n&gt; \n&gt; But to do this test I do need some external\n&gt; resource, a simple catalog \n&gt; file.  Ok.  Now I can&#39;t simply look at the test to\n&gt; see what it does.  I \n&gt; also have to look at the file.  Are there cleaner\n&gt; alternatives?  Must I \n&gt; simply accept that there will occasionally be\n&gt; external resources required \n&gt; to test functionality at the boundaries of the\n&gt; system?  If so, are there \n&gt; best practices for this scenario?  Am I missing\n&gt; something?  I&#39;d love to \n&gt; hear peoples thoughts.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; David Olivier\n&gt; Naval Research Laboratory\n&gt; Digital Mapping, Charting & Geodesy Analysis Program\n&gt; Code 7440.2\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
