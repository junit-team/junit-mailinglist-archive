I am supposed to \nimplement junit tests on code that I have just written. However, what \nI have learned in school does not seem to apply here!  We learned \nthat if the method is an &quot;add&quot; method, give it two numbers, \nand &quot;assert&quot; that the corrent addition is performed, and so on. . .  \nwell, I have no clue what to assert!\n\nQuick rundown of what I am testing:\n\nBasically, my code is using the Reflection class to check all the \nmembers of a class for a certain type of compatibility.  Most methods \nadd errors to an error vector, and then there is a simple print \nfunction to print out the vector... How on earth do I test this \nclass??  \n\nThanks for any help in advance!!\n\nYours truly,\nThe Shark\n\n\n",
