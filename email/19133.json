Dreaming is not a crime  <br/>\n&gt; you know? :P<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Any help here is SERIOUSLY appreciated, I&#39;m currently losing hours  <br/>\n&gt; and hours each day<br/>\n&gt; because I have to deploy a full JNLP java package in order to test  <br/>\n&gt; jnlp-enabled application,<br/>\n&gt; and I can&#39;t debug them at all.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Also, automated JUnit testing can&#39;t presently be done AFAIK.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anyone knows a solution, or can give me some hints about this problem?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks in advance for any answer<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
