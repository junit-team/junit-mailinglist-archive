If I\nthink about the biggest benefits of writing unit tests, they are:\n1) Make sure the code works (quality)\n2) Make sure the code stays working (regression/maintenance)\n\nNeither of these are critical on an interview.  Clearly #2 doesn&#39;t\nmatter.  It&#39;s an exercise that will never make it to production, let\nalone be maintained.\n\n#1 is more interesting.  On first glance, one would think the code\nneeds to work at an interview.  While that&#39;s nice, I don&#39;t view that\nas the most important thing when I am interviewing.  I am more\ninterested in seeing how the candidate thinks, looks up information,\nreacts to errors, whether he/she seems comfortable with basic Java\nidioms.\n\nIn my opinion, more organizations should have candidates writing code\non a computer as part of the interview.  This is still rarer than I\nwould like.\n\n",
