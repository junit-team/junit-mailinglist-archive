I don&#39;t see how having an additional\n&gt;  &gt; org.something.util.CalendarParser class could make any library harder to\n&gt;  &gt; understand and use. Hell, that class could even be extracted to a \n&gt; different\n&gt;  &gt; binary, so that an outside developer wouldn&#39;t see it at all.\n&gt; \n&gt; Have you really never tried to work your way through a mess of JavaDoc\n&gt; with no easy way to figure out what classes you needed and what you\n&gt; could ignore? Has it been that long since you learned a new API?\n&gt; Featuritis isn&#39;t just a problem for applications. It applies to\n&gt; libraries too. Smaller is better. Too large an API becomes a problem.\n\nStart with a roadmap, rather than just Javadoc. What you describe is a \nlimitation of the Javadoc concept, rather than a limitation of any \nparticular API design. Javadoc describes classes and methods, but \ndoesn&#39;t necessarily help you know where to start.\n\nTo use JUnit as the example, there are a number of good tutorials. Many \nfreely available packages now use a familiar pattern on their sites:\n\n  * One minute tutorial\n  * Two minute tutorial\n  * Ten minute tutorial\n  * Javadoc/reference guide\n\nI think this is great. The next API I publish should include this.\n\n&gt; Probably half of what&#39;s there could be\n&gt; non-public, and users would be the better off for it if it were. What\n&gt; benefit is served by making junit.samples or TestResult$1 public?\n\nI wish the code to extract test methods were public and non-static! I&#39;ve \nwanted to reuse or override that a number of times. If, instead, it were \na pluggable TestNamingStrategy, I wouldn&#39;t have that problem, but that \nwould mean a collaborator behind an interface....\n\nFor every example you give, I can find another. That game&#39;s boring. :)\n-- \nJ. B.
