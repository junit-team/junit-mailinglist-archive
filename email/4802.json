Olivier&quot; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The rule of thumb is that unit tests should be as standalone as possible,<br/>\n&gt; and dependencies on external resources such as databases or files should be<br/>\n&gt; minimized or eliminated.  This makes perfect sense.  Tests which rely on<br/>\n&gt; external resources are  not self-contained, are harder to read, and can be<br/>\n&gt; broken even if the code is functioning correctly.  However, code does touch<br/>\n&gt; external resources at some point.  Shouldn&#39;t this be tested, and how?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Specifically, I have code that parses a xml catalog file and builds a<br/>\n&gt; catalog object structure.  I want to verify that the parsing works<br/>\n&gt; correctly.  In particular, I want to make sure that it robustly handles<br/>\n&gt; unusual conditions such as catalogs with certain branches missing.  It<br/>\n&gt; seems to me that the simplest way to do this is to have a test which uses<br/>\n&gt; the parsing code to parse a very simple catalog and verifies that it builds<br/>\n&gt; what I expect it to.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But to do this test I do need some external resource, a simple catalog<br/>\n&gt; file.  Ok.  Now I can&#39;t simply look at the test to see what it does.  I<br/>\n&gt; also have to look at the file.  Are there cleaner alternatives?  Must I<br/>\n&gt; simply accept that there will occasionally be external resources required<br/>\n&gt; to test functionality at the boundaries of the system?  If so, are there<br/>\n&gt; best practices for this scenario?  Am I missing something?  I&#39;d love to<br/>\n&gt; hear peoples thoughts.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;ll first try to embed the XML text in the test and use a Writer to test the<br/>\nparsing.  This usually works for most cases.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I must use external resources, I&#39;ll use a JVM parameter to keep the tests<br/>\nlocation independent:<br/>\n<br/>\n    java -Ddata.dir=/home/mike/tests/data MyTest<br/>\n<br/>\nThen a base test class knows how to query for the property and apply a relative<br/>\npath to all other tests requiring external resources.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nMike Clark<br/>\nClarkware Consulting, Inc.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.clarkware.com\">http://www.clarkware.com</a><br/>\n720.851.2014</div>",
