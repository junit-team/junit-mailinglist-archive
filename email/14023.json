I wrote my test class, and i saw that the side effects<br/>\n&gt; occured as i planned.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I create a new method, without return, that basically verifies some<br/>\n&gt; conditions, and so it call the other methods (already tested) in<br/>\n&gt; acordance with these conditions.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So, my doubt is the following one:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; How i make the test of this new method without remaking the test<br/>\n&gt; already done?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is exactly what happens in a design with too much coupling between <br/>\nobjects: when you test the &quot;invoking&quot; method, you find you have to do as <br/>\nmuch work (and more) as you did to test the &quot;invoked&quot; method.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe simplest solution is to break this dependency with an interface <br/>\nbetween the invoking method and the invoked method. This way you can <br/>\nsubstitute in your tests a simpler version of the invoked method that <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t make you re-test something you already tested.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor more information, look at _JUnit Recipes_, chapter 2 and the book <br/>\n_Working Effectively with Legacy Code_.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ.
