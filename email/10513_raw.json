I \nhope it \n&gt; helps.\n\nActually, your advice sent me down a better path yesterday.  I ended \nup looking at how RepeatedTest and TestSetup were implemented.\n\nWhat I ended up doing was extending TestSetup and overriding run().  \nrun() called setUp() once to handle the database connection. Then \na &quot;big ugly&quot; loop get each object and uses the ResourceManager object \nfrom the jUnit Extensions package to wrap up the record.  Then called \nbasicRun().  Each pass through the loop calls basicRun(), so that the \nTestSuite passed into this object would be run on each record.  \nCalled it RecordIteratorTestSetup.\n\nThen, I just created a TestCase where I used the \nRecordIteratorTestSetup, passed in the value of the batch, and ran a \nstandard test.\n\nThe standard test (one that I want to repeat for many customers), \nsimply is smart enough that on setUp() it grabs the Record from the \nResourceManager.\n\nAnd it worked...and there was much rejoicing.\n\nI&#39;m not sure if this implementation is ideal, but it seems to work so \nfar.  I really appreciate the help, because it got me thinking about \nthis a bit differently and pushed me down the right track.\n\n\n\n",
