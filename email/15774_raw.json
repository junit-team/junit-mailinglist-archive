I&#39;ve found that the best way to learn is to write something\n&gt; myself.  I think of something that I&#39;ve been interested in doing lately,\n&gt; and write some code in that direction, such as a digital jukebox, a\n&gt; custom news aggregator, or a screensaver.  I&#39;m not intending to finish\n&gt; the job, but it helps me write code that I understand, since JUnit is\n&gt; the thing I&#39;m trying to learn.  If I try to learn using someone else&#39;s\n&gt; code, then I&#39;m never sure if problems are coming from JUnit or the other\n&gt; code.\n&gt;\n&gt; Not only that, but once you have a little experience with JUnit, google\n&gt; for &quot;test-driven development&quot;.  That&#39;s fun stuff.  Good luck,\n\n\nAbsolutely but sometimes it really helps to have a good example to get you\nstarted and explain the best style. For instance in eclipse they have a\nfairly sophisticated test runner that goes and finds all the tests in\nplugin/package/class and runs them so you don&#39;t need hard to maintain\nsuites.\n\nThat said I don&#39;t know what project to recommend Sreedhar that will do a\ngood job of illustrating current JUnit best practices in Eclipse. Where&#39;s JB\nwhen you need him :-)?\n\nMark\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nBlog: http://dotnetjunkies.com/WebLog/mlevison/\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
