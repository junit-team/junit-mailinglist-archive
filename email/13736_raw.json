I think it is reasonable to\n&gt;  &gt; say the test fails if its setup fails.\n&gt; \n&gt; No, it&#39;s not the tests that are failing, it&#39;s the setUp.\n&gt; \n&gt; Imagine you have 100 tests and 1 set up.  The setUp fails, and now JUnit is\n&gt; telling you you have &quot;101 FAILURES&quot;...  Very helpful!  And QA will freak out\n&gt; on you.  And I&#39;m sure you already know you can&#39;t &quot;trust&quot; this report and\n&gt; that you are actually looking at a cascade failure.\n&gt; \n&gt; Compare this to &quot;1 FAILURE, 100 SKIPS&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now, *that* is a much more acurate view of what really happened.\n\nI like the idea of distinguishing between these kinds of failures:\n\n  * an assertion failed\n  * the test threw an unexpected exception\n  * setUp() threw an unexpected exception\n\nAs for &quot;skipping&quot; tests, I reserve judgment until after I&#39;ve tried it, \nbut I do like idea of distinguishing all those kinds of failures. This \nwould help people testing legacy code or writing larger tests. For TDD \nwork, though, it&#39;s mostly needless. If, all of a sudden, 20 tests \nexplode, I just hit UNDO a few times and try again, anyway. Soon, I&#39;ll \nbe able to &quot;Return to Green Bar&quot; in Eclipse. (Well, if not /soon/, then \n/someday/.)\n-- \nJ. B.
