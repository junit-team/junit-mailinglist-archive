Some shells don&#39;t handle\n&gt; negative return codes correctly, turning them into 0 (meaning normal\n&gt; termination, which seems like the wrong way to truncate, but what do\n&gt; I know). Would anyone object to this change? Who out there uses the\n&gt; exit codes?\n\nWe use the exit code in our project during an automated daily\nbuild/verification process. We assume 0 means success, non-0 otherwise.\nPersonally I wish the errors and failures were rolled into just\n1 category (a bug is a bug).\n\nIf you are curious, the log gets emailed out to the team with a subject\nthat mentions (sucess) or (errors) depending on if everything was ok.\nBasically ksh/cron type stuff, which uses the exit codes to detect\nerrors. Since it gets emailed out every night, it detects lapses in\njudgement at most 24 hours after they happen and alerts everybody.\nMostly the integration type tests fail though (which are not implemented\nwith junit) because of database issues, or the build fails because\npermissions in CVS are wrong... stuff like that. So then you can look\nat the attachements (log files, junit textui output) to figure out what\nwent wrong when the subject says &quot;... (errors) ...&quot;.\n\nWe use ksh, perl, tcsh and bash across several unix flavors (sgi and\nsolaris, mainly) and cygwin under windows.\n\nI hope that helps you. Let me know if you require further details.\n\n-- \nChester Kustarz 2\nhttp://www.monkey.org/~chester\n\n\n",
