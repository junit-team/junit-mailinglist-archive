I expe=\r\nct it to break with JUnit 4.6.\n2) Intellij doesn&#39;t report the test name cor=\r\nrectly. It reports:\n\nTest &#39;com.intellij.rt.junit4.Junit4ClassSuite$1.0 test=\r\n case(s)&#39; ignored.\n\nI assume it looks at the annotation and does its own na=\r\nming.\n\nThe main reason I&#39;m asking on the group is in case I&#39;m missing\nsomet=\r\nhing about the approach, and perhaps the JUnit developers had\nsomething els=\r\ne in mind. Clearly they do for JUnit 4 tests, but I\nhaven&#39;t found anything =\r\nfor intermixing JUnit 3 tests.\n\nI do appreciate the insight about the Assum=\r\ne class, it is very helpful\nto know!\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, Mark Le=\r\nvison &lt;mark@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; On Tue, Feb 17, 2009 at 1:23 PM, yme0987654321 =\r\n&lt;yme0987654321@...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt; &gt; Hi David,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; My name is Yishai (I have =\r\nto figure out how to change this Yahoo\n&gt; &gt; profile). Anyway, I guess the is=\r\nsue is that I have many tests that are\n&gt; &gt; in the 3.8 style that I am retro=\r\nfitting, so to use this I would have\n&gt; &gt; to change the test into a Junit 4 =\r\ntype test, whereas in my hack the\n&gt; &gt; runner correctly figured out that it =\r\nwas a JUnit 3.8 style test.\n&gt; \n&gt; Have you considered converting the tests t=\r\no Junit 4? I&#39;m sure if you\n&gt; ask around some has implemented a script to ge=\r\nt most of the monkey\n&gt; work done.\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers\n&gt; Mark\n&gt; \n&gt; Blog: http://www.=\r\nnotesfromatooluser.com/\n&gt; Recent Entries: Agile/Scrum Smells:\n&gt; http://www.=\r\nnotesfromatooluser.com/2008/06/agilescrum-smells.html\n&gt; Agile Games for Mak=\r\ning Retrospectives Interesting:\n&gt;\nhttp://www.notesfromatooluser.com/2008/10=\r\n/agile-games-for-making-retrospectives-interesting.html\n&gt;\n\n\n\n",
