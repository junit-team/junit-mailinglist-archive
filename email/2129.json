I choose to organize my tests so that I generally have one<br/>\ntest per tested method, with appropriately many asserts per test. &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it is best to keep methods as concise and as focused as<br/>\npossible (see Refactoring by Fowler, et al; basically, your code will<br/>\nbe more reliable and easier to maintain).  For me, this means writing<br/>\nseveral small test methods for the method I am testing, and at most<br/>\nhaving one assert per test method and sometimes no asserts at all<br/>\n(for example, if you are testing an exception that passes control to<br/>\na catch block, there is no need to put assert(true) in the catch<br/>\nblock).<br/>\n<br/>\nI haven&#39;t really followed the recent thread regarding &quot;Why doesn&#39;t<br/>\nJUnit count asserts&quot;, but I now understand the position of some<br/>\npeople who favor counting asserts.  If you have many asserts in one<br/>\ntest method, counting asserts would give you the number of conditions<br/>\nyou have tested.  However, I think it would be best to put each<br/>\nspecific condition in a seperate test method.  I usually have between<br/>\neight and sixteen test methods for each method I am testing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI use the following naming convention for my test methods to keep<br/>\nthings organized:<br/>\n<br/>\n    test_##_nameOfMethodBeingTested<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, the eigth test method for the method isAccountAssigned<br/>\nwould be,<br/>\n<br/>\n    test_07_isAccountAssigned<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Jason Rogers &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jason.rogers@...\">jason.rogers@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Point well taken, Tom, but I still disagree.  I guess it is a<br/>\n&gt; matter of<br/>\n&gt; taste for the most part.  However, I wouldn&#39;t like the framework to<br/>\n&gt; be<br/>\n&gt; &#39;polluted&#39; by the counting of asserts - but maybe I am just being<br/>\n&gt; too<br/>\n&gt; dogmatic.  Thanks for your well-formed opinions!!!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -Jason<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;     &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; From: Thomas Obst [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:thomas_obst@...\">thomas_obst@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; Sent: Thursday, July 26, 2001 9:45 AM<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;     &gt; Subject: Re: [junit] Reporting more then 1 failed <br/>\n&gt;     &gt; assertion per test<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; <br/>\n&gt;     &gt; <br/>\n&gt;     &gt; Jason Rogers wrote:<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; <br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; I respectfully disagree.  You assume that asserts and <br/>\n&gt;     &gt; test cases are equal<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; in their importance.  What I want to know is whether or <br/>\n&gt;     &gt; not a test has<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; passed.  ...  So, why count asserts?  Perhaps to give<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; that warm, fuzzy feeling... perhaps for some other reason.<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; <br/>\n&gt;     &gt; The only important thing is whether the application <br/>\n&gt;     &gt; works. Whatever else  we<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; evaluate, whether it is the number of asserts, the number <br/>\n&gt;     &gt; of tests, the number<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; of test cases, or even whether we test at all, is just <br/>\n&gt;     &gt; there to give us that<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &quot;warm, fuzzy feeling&quot; or to give us the shivers. The <br/>\n&gt;     &gt; number of tests/asserts<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; doesn&#39;t prove anything but it does give us a hint at an <br/>\n&gt;     &gt; appropriate body<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; temperature.<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; <br/>\n&gt;     &gt; I guess this whole discussion really boils down to what <br/>\n&gt;     &gt; constitutes a test.

Other <br/>\n&gt;     &gt; programmers might want to<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; refactor my test code so that basically one assert per <br/>\n&gt;     &gt; test was the rule. This<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; is probably just a matter of taste. If so, it would be <br/>\n&gt;     &gt; nice if JUnit would<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; support both approaches - displaying the number of tests <br/>\n&gt;     &gt; _and_ the number of<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; asserts.<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; <br/>\n&gt;     &gt; - Tom<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; <br/>\n&gt;     &gt; <br/>\n&gt;     &gt; <br/>\n&gt;     &gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
