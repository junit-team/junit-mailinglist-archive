There are multiple ways to tests. It all \ndepends on what you are trying to achieve.\n\n--Vishal\n\nJoakim Ohlrogge wrote:\n\n&gt; Thanks David,\n&gt; That was what I was trying to say /and/ I think decoupling your code from\n&gt; EJB specifics and JNDI lookups and EJB-lifecycle events is a good idea. An\n&gt; EJB container is an execution environment and business logic should not\n&gt; depend on where it is executing. A combination of JUnit-tests without \n&gt; cactus\n&gt; and systemtests (executed as a client against the application deployed \n&gt; in a\n&gt; container works well in our project). The latter is run with our \n&gt; homecooked\n&gt; acceptance testing framework and the former with junit. This is possible\n&gt; because our EJB:s are merely shells contining our services that are\n&gt; implemented as pojos and tested outside the EJB.\n&gt;\n&gt; It works well for us. Of course there are different ways to skin a cat :)\n&gt;\n&gt; On 11/3/06, David Saff &lt;saff@... &lt;mailto:saff%40mit.edu&gt;&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Just to clarify, on projects like this, I usually have two levels of\n&gt; &gt; tests:\n&gt; &gt; user tests that verify that the end user sees what she expects \n&gt; (running in\n&gt; &gt; the container, even through the browser), and developer tests that \n&gt; verify\n&gt; &gt; that my classes work as I expect. For user tests, it&#39;s essential to have\n&gt; &gt; all the components in place. For developer tests, it&#39;s \n&gt; counter-productive:\n&gt; &gt; I want to understand what my code does independently of what \n&gt; services are\n&gt; &gt; provided by third-party containers or servers, and I also want to run\n&gt; &gt; developer tests often and fast.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I think this is the same thing Vishal is saying below, but I wanted a\n&gt; &gt; chance\n&gt; &gt; to rephrase it a little. Thanks,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; David Saff\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; On 11/2/06, Vishal Vishnoi &lt;vvishnoi@... \n&gt; &lt;mailto:vvishnoi%40bea.com&gt; &lt;vvishnoi%40bea.com&gt;&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Use Cactus\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (http://jakarta.apache.org/cactus/writing/howto_testcase.html \n&gt; &lt;http://jakarta.apache.org/cactus/writing/howto_testcase.html&gt;). It&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; very easy to package you test and run them on server side. They also\n&gt; &gt; &gt; have documentation on how to test EJB or any regular JUnit test in the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; container.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; For higher level testing (i.e testing like a customer), if you need to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; verify something in container, then verify it in container. Don&#39;t \n&gt; try to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; run it outside, otherwise the whole purpose of testing is lost.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --Vishal\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; lenniedg2000 wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m using Eclipse 3.2, Orion application server, J2EE 5.0, Oracle\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; database.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;ve written a jUnit test but it doesn&#39;t run since it doesn&#39;t run\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; within the application server &quot;container&quot; and so can&#39;t find the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; database data-sources that I&#39;ve setup.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; How can I run jUnit unit tests inside an application server\n&gt; &gt; &quot;container&quot;?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Kind Regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Lennie De Villiers\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; __________________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Notice: This email message, together with any attachments, may contain\n&gt; &gt; &gt; information of BEA Systems, Inc., its subsidiaries and affiliated\n&gt; &gt; &gt; entities, that may be confidential, proprietary, copyrighted and/or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; legally privileged, and is intended solely for the use of the \n&gt; individual\n&gt; &gt; &gt; or entity named in this message.
