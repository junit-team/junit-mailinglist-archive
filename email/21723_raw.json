I\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; saw some previous discussion about such fixtures in JDave.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I=\r\n think there were two different directions going on here.  It sounds\n&gt; &gt; li=\r\nke you want JUnit, when given the outer class, to automatically\n&gt; &gt; instant=\r\niate the inner classes.  It sounded like JDave wanted JUnit,\n&gt; &gt; when given=\r\n the inner class, to automatically consult the outer class\n&gt; &gt; when instant=\r\niating.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Am I getting both requests right?  If not, then we&#39;re gett=\r\ning close to\n&gt; &gt; a Rule of Three threshold for reuse.  If I am, then I see =\r\nthe same\n&gt; &gt; Java idiom having two different &quot;obvious&quot; interpretations to t=\r\nwo\n&gt; &gt; different classes of user.\n&gt; \n&gt; David, I believe you&#39;re getting both=\r\n requests right.  In my case, the inner classes are to be instantiated alon=\r\ng with the enclosing class when the enclosing class is run, but never insta=\r\nntiated and run on their own.  I ended up accomplishing this via the AllTes=\r\nts runner and suite() methods that adapt the enclosing class and inner clas=\r\ns instances as JUnit 3.8-style Test adapters.  I also wanted to tie the inn=\r\ner class instances to a specific enclosing class instance, because the inne=\r\nr classes use fixture fields from an enclosing instance.\n&gt; \n&gt; It looks as t=\r\nhough the requirement for JDave inner class contexts is that they be instan=\r\ntiable and runnable on their own, independent of their sibling contexts -- =\r\nand that the requestor would have liked for such contexts to adopt whatever=\r\n Runner a @RunWith on the enclosing class might have specified.\n&gt; \n&gt; Off th=\r\ne top of my head, I can&#39;t think of a clean way for JUnit to support both st=\r\nrategies in the core proper.\n&gt; \n&gt; I may try satisfying my specific use case=\r\n in another way, perhaps using an as-yet-developed kind of Runner.  The All=\r\nTests way still seems a bit icky, but works for now.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Paul Ho=\r\nlser\n&gt;\n\n\n\n",
