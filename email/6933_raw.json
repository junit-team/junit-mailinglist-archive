Just a thought.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Heck of a thought.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I would expect:\n&gt; &gt;    a) The class structure would contain the test methods, but they\n&gt; &gt;        wouldn&#39;t be loaded in the absence of a -test flag, or some\n&gt; such.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;    b) With the -test option present, a framework would exist to help\n&gt; you\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;         experiment with the APIs, uncovering gaps in the\n&gt; documentation.\n&gt; &gt;         (If I give an empty string as an argument, do I get a null\n&gt; &gt; String, an empty string, or an exception?)\n&gt;\n&gt; Yes, both of these would be cool, especially if a reporting mechanism\n&gt; and\n&gt; driver was built-into the JVM.  Not likely, but it&#39;s not impossible.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;    c) API documentation would have a link to a page containing test\n&gt; &gt;        methods that would exist only if the class was testable.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Such a thing could be really cool, self-documenting addition to\n&gt; &gt; libraries.\n&gt;\n&gt; That is a pretty cool idea.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; What the heck *is* unit testing, anyway? If it is &quot;class methods&quot;,\n&gt; then\n&gt; &gt; JUnitDoclet made sense. But if it is &quot;basic operations&quot;, isn&#39;t that\n&gt; more\n&gt; &gt; like integration testing? Or is there a middle ground, say, as\n&gt; package-\n&gt; &gt; level operations?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Right now, I&#39;m seeing &quot;unit&quot; as one or more of:\n&gt; &gt;   * method\n&gt; &gt;   * class\n&gt; &gt;   * package\n&gt; &gt;   * use case\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Are there any other candidates? Are any of these automatically\n&gt; &gt; ruled out? What exactly does the word &quot;unit&quot; mean, in this\n&gt; &gt; context?\n&gt;\n&gt; I go by the Robert Binder definition, which is couched in a\n&gt; comprehensive\n&gt; thesis about the importance of identifying appropriate testing\n&gt; techniques\n&gt; and bug predictions for components at different scopes.  But the\n&gt; scopes used\n&gt; are traditional categories (in QA engineering, Boris Beizer and\n&gt; Gelnford\n&gt; Meyers pretty well represent the founders of tradition).\n&gt;\n&gt; From Binder&#39;s &quot;Testing Object-Oriented Systems,&quot; p. 45:\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;The scope of a test is the collection of software components to be\n&gt; verified. [...] Scope is traditionally designated as unit, integration\n&gt; or\n&gt; system.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;The scope of a unit test typically comprises a relatively small\n&gt; executable.\n&gt; In object-oriented programming, an object of a class is the smallest\n&gt; executable unit, but test messages must be sent to a method, so we can\n&gt; speak\n&gt; of method scope testing.  A test unit may consist of a class, several\n&gt; related classes (a cluster), or an executable binary file.  Typically\n&gt; it is\n&gt; a cluster of interdependent classes.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; And, some gems from the chapter on &quot;Classes&quot; (chapter 10), p. 351:\n&gt;\n&gt; Q: Why Test at Class Scope?\n&gt; A [edited for length]:\n&gt; - System-level testing cannot exercise components to the same degree\n&gt; as\n&gt; class scope testing.\n&gt; - Trying to exercise a class through its clients is usually like\n&gt; trying to\n&gt; pick up a dime with boxing gloves. [one of my favorite lines from\n&gt; Binder&#39;s\n&gt; book]\n&gt; - The longer the time between creation of a bug and its debut as a\n&gt; failure,\n&gt; the higher the cost of correction.\n&gt; - Effective class scope testing reduces schedule risk and improves\n&gt; productivity.\n&gt; - It is poor practice, at best, to foist testing on to developers of\n&gt; client\n&gt; classes.\n&gt;\n&gt; Scott Stirling\n&gt; Framingham, MA\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
