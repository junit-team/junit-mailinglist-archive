Usually, there is \n&gt; decomposition of the algorithm in the production class. \n&gt; Sometimes, I simply expose what might be thought of\n&gt; as private details. Sometimes, I can think of a better way \n&gt; to structure the problem, and am not worried about exposing\n&gt; the internals.  But sometimes, I really don&#39;t want to expose\n&gt; the internals to other production classes, but still want \n&gt; to be able to get at those points for testing.\n\nWould you not extract that functionality into another class and test it\nthere?  And pass that (unit tested) code into your primary class?  That way\ndo you not get the best of both worlds - and also the ability to plug in a\nnew implementation as/when required?\n\nJonathan\n\n",
