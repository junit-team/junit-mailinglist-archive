I haven&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; subsequently used this freedom to any good effect, but it<br/>\n&gt;&gt; seemed like<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; a good idea at the time.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Does anyone have an example where this has been used to good effect?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We used it for a couple things.  One was this: because we have a<br/>\n&gt; functional test framework built on top of JUnit, we optionally store<br/>\n&gt; pass/fail results in a database.  getName() was a very convenient way to<br/>\n&gt; get a descriptive name of the test to insert into the results table.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There were a lot of good uses of getName(), like yours.
