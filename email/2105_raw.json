If it is interesting to know how\n&gt;many test cases the system has passed, then it is also interesting to know how many\n&gt;asserts have made it. This is especially true if a test case is something like testMethod(),\n&gt;where the individual asserts verify that various values of the parameters to method()\n&gt;work (max, min, null, normal, etc). Sure these could all be individual test cases, but then\n&gt;it becomes difficult to see whether I really have exhaustively tested my method. Code\n&gt;coverage is not the solution. That only tells me whether what I have written, opposed to\n&gt;what I should have written, works.\n&gt;\nOk imagine JUnit implements the counting of assertions.  You run your \ntests and get &quot;90 tests, 405 assertions&quot;.  That&#39;s great, but what does \nthis number &quot;405&quot; tells you?  And what is that better than &quot;90 tests, \n404 assertions&quot; and worst than &quot;90 tests, 406 assertions&quot;?  Does this \nmagic number &quot;405&quot; tell you that the &quot;individual asserts verify that \nvarious values of the parameters to method() work (max, min, null, \nnormal, etc)&quot;.  Do you expect a certain ration #assertions/#tests?\n\nHow does this magic &quot;405&quot; tells you that you have tested what you \n_should have_ written?  I you don&#39;t know what you should have written, I \ndoubt that a simple number could tell you that...\n\nHere is maybe a good test:\n\nvoid setMyValue (int value) {\n   myValue = value);\n}\n\n[...]\n\nvoid testMyValueWithEverything () {\n   for (int i=INT_MIN; i&lt;INT_MAX; i++) {\n      myObject.setMyValue(i);\n      assertTrue(myObject.getMyValue() == i);\n   }\n   for (double j=DOUBLE_MIN; j&lt;DOUBLE_MAX; j++) {\n      myObject.setMyValue(j);\n      assertTrue(myObject.getMyValue() == Integer(j).toInt());\n   }\n}\n\nyou have &quot;exhaustively tested [your] method&quot;.\n\nThe # of assertions will only give you a feeling of security.  A much \nbetter approach could be to develop a simple framework to stress-test a \ncomponent but that&#39;s not the goal of JUnit.\n\n-Vladimir\n\n\n",
