But my first topic was a discussion <br/>\nabout the value of JUnit compared to Design by Contract.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was very controversial. At times I asked myself, if I was right <br/>\nwhen many gurus here were arguing against my opinion. I will not <br/>\nrepeat the discussion.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I have seen that the DBC inventor himself seems to support my <br/>\nopinion recently: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.artima.com/intv/contestP.html\">http://www.artima.com/intv/contestP.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI have only read the summary until now. Maybe you are interested in <br/>\nwhat he has to say in favor of Contract-Driven Development. I like <br/>\nthe idea of Design by Contract. And I think that it could make <br/>\ntraditional JUnit tests obsolete, since the test cases could <br/>\nautomatically be generated from the Contracts. I think this is what <br/>\nParasoft JTest already does.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t misunderstand me. I like JUnit. But I always look for better <br/>\nways to solve my problems. So I hope you are as open as me to new <br/>\nsolutions and ideas.</div>",
