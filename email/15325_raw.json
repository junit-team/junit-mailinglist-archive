I like it a lot and will\n&gt; \n&gt; continue \n&gt; \n&gt;&gt;to use it. I will continue to use it whether or not it is part of the \n&gt;&gt;framework.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; So will I, but the huge advantage of putting it into an official junit\n&gt; release is that it gets promoted to the public, which in turn enables\n&gt; you to use it in various teams on various projects. Additionally, you\n&gt; (and many other people who like assertThat) don&#39;t have to\n&gt; write/maintain the same functionality everybody else is\n&gt; writing/maintaining too. \n&gt; \n\nI agree with all you say but I also agree with Kent that JUnit should be \nthe bare minimum functionality. Overall, I come out +0. I would like to \nsee a commonly used constraints library that is independent of JMock.\n\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt;I have also been experimenting with using &quot;should&quot; in the names of all \n&gt;&gt;my tests. I was quite surprised by the positive effect it had on the \n&gt;&gt;quality of my tests.\n&gt;&gt;...\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; That sounds interesting, how exactly do you use &quot;should&quot;? Could you\n&gt; give us some examples? How did it improve the quality of your tests?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\ntrivial example :\n\npublic void shouldThrowNullPointerException()\n\nrather than\n\npublic void testWithNullParameter()\n\n\nThe name describes the result I am expecting rather than the steps I \ntake to cause the result.\n\n\nI found that I was getting somewhat lazy when I wrote tests. Some tests \ntested more than they really should. Overall they lacked focus.\n\nBy working &quot;should&quot; into the name my tests became more results-oriented.\n\nKevin\n\n",
