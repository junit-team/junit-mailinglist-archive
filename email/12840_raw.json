The testablility of classes is an important\naspect during our design and development phase.\n\nIf you have some method that modifies a private variable, unless an\nexternal entity (your junit tester) can see that change, there is no\nway we can test its  value.\n\n\nSarath.\n\n\n\nOn Thu, 10 Feb 2005 10:33:29 +0000, Andrew McDonagh\n&lt;andrew.mcdonagh@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;  Pico Geyer wrote:\n&gt;  \n&gt;  &gt;Hi \n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;I&#39;m a little confused on how to test certain types of methods.\n&gt;  &gt;Is JUnit supposed to be able to test all types of methods.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;For example how do you test a:\n&gt;  &gt;1) Method that only modifies private fields and has no corresponding\n&gt;  &gt;getter method to see if the field is now at the correct value\n&gt;  &gt;  \n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;  There must be some form of change in the system, aside from the internal \n&gt;  private fields being modified, use this to verity the public method \n&gt;  worked as expected.\n&gt;  \n&gt;  &gt;2) Methods that work on network traffic, ex counting all TCP packets\n&gt;  &gt;that I receive.
