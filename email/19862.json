Or refactoring invalid tests would take more time than<br/>\nI felt I gained from the TDD process.<br/>\n<br/>\nTDD for me is a thinking tool, it helps me solve problems<br/>\nincrementally and I often end up with simpler solutions than I first<br/>\nthought I would. Of course sometimes I arrive just where I thought I<br/>\nwould with the complexity I thought I would have but I seldomly know<br/>\nthat in advance.<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree with you that one should always question what one is doing and<br/>\nlook for improvement in any situation.<br/>\n<br/>\n/J<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;  Here is a scenario I&#39;ve seen happen fairly often:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Write test1<br/>\n&gt;  Write code1<br/>\n&gt;  Write test2<br/>\n&gt;  Write code2<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Then a refactoring comes to mind and you realize you don&#39;t need code1<br/>\n&gt;  and code2 any more, so you write code3, and suddenly, you find<br/>\n&gt;  yourself having to refactor (or throw away) both test1 and test2.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  I was simply suggesting that sometimes, the following flow works better:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Write code1<br/>\n&gt;  Write code2<br/>\n&gt;  &lt;realize a refactoring is possible&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Refactor code1/code2 into code3<br/>\n&gt;  &lt;happy with the result, now we write the test&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Write test3<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Net result:  two less tests to write.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
