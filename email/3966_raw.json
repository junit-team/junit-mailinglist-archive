To recap:\n\nThe filename matching system that David proposed was my first thought as\nwell and it could be implemented as an Ant task easily enough so that can be\nused to fail a build if a test case is missing, etc... I had started to\nwrite this utility when I decided to email the list and make sure I wasn&#39;t\nre-inventing the wheel. I think that this approach is a good first step but\nit doesn&#39;t give us a look into the code and it would be difficult to handle\ninterfaces (for which I rarely write a unit test).\n\nI looked at NoUnit but I cannot get it to run with Java 1.4 -- it looks\npromising though. Quilt is the most ambitious of the open source projects\nand it also looks to be very promising -- but is still pre-alpha and\nprobably not ready for use in a corporate setting.\n\nIntegration with Ant is, of-course, a big plus for any utility that can be\nused for this task. Looks like there&#39;s some definate room for improvement in\nthis area. Does anyone else have some suggestions?\n\nChris\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Vladimir Bossicard [mailto:vladimir@...]\nSent: Tuesday, February 05, 2002 9:33 AM\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: Re: [junit] checking for test coverage\n\n\n&gt; Does anyone know of any utilities that can check for test coverage.\n\n\nYou can have a look at Quilt: http://quilt.sourceforge.net\n\nOff the record: it would be interesting to know what is the average \ncoverage of the Test First Design method: 80%, 90%, 95%, 100%?\n\n-Vladimir\n\n-- \nVladimir Bossicard\nwww.bossicard.com\n\n\n\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\njunit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n \n\nYour use of Yahoo!
