I have more than 2 years of<br/>\nexperience with JUnit and I can tell you that there&#39;s a _huge_<br/>\ndifference between the tests I wrote when I began and the ones I write<br/>\nnow.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I read a lot about the problems of JUnit/TDD.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>links please.  I&#39;m interested to read more about those problems.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Maybe I change my opinion. But I am not so blind to overlook all the <br/>\n&gt; problems concerning JUnit/TDD.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t say (and I think nobody says) that JUnit is perfect (why do<br/>\nyou think I&#39;m managing JUnit-addons?) but it gives you enough freedom<br/>\nto write and test pretty much whatever you want.  But of course you<br/>\nhave to invest some time understanding the framework.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince I haven&#39;t used JTest (well, $3500...) I can&#39;t really say if<br/>\nJTest would be more useful *for me* than JUnit + my addons.  But I<br/>\nwill first learn DbC before learning a new test runner (JTest).<br/>\n<br/>\n-Vladimir</div>",
