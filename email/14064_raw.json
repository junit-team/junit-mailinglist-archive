That is very helpful.  It was really driving me\n&gt; up the wall.\n\nGlad to help!\n\n&gt; I don&#39;t understand the point about replacing the private\n&gt; singleton instance variable, though.  How would that help?\n&gt; Wouldn&#39;t that ultimately leave me with the same problem,\n&gt; only within the singleton class?\n\nMost often, singleton classes store the singleton instance in a \nprivate static variable in the class.  So I&#39;m assuming that the \nDefaultGatewayController class contains a private static field to \nhold the reference to its own singleton instance.  My suggestion is \nthat you could use reflection to change this private static field to \npoint to instances you create.  On the other hand, maybe the \nsingleton-ness of the class isn&#39;t an issue in your tests; maybe none \nof the code under test calls static methods of \nDefaultGatewayController to get the singleton instance.\n_ _ _\n\nIt doesn&#39;t appear that you need to use a class loader.  It seems \nlike you could just do this:\n\nConstructor constructor =\nDefaultGatewayController.class.getDeclaredConstructor(paramTypes); \n\nThen the instance created by this constructor would be directly \nusable by your test code.\n\n\n\n",
