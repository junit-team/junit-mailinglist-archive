    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1991307135\">&lt;snip&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;A project can be setup in such a ways as to not have to worry about <br/>\n&gt;file systems, just relative paths. So this is somewhat incidental to <br/>\n&gt;whether to keep files in or out of java. If my test run breaks on <br/>\n&gt;g:/myCsvFiles for a test input file, is it any less likely to break <br/>\n&gt;on g:/project where the test java itself is located?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Now, for some tests that I wrote to test a Java version of the Unix touch tool, I generated the test file to be touched using:<br/>\n<br/>\nFile testFile = File.createTempFile(&quot;utouch&quot;, &quot;.txt&quot;);<br/>\n&lt;do some testing stuff here&gt;<br/>\ntestFile.delete();<br/>\n<br/>\nThis worked well for me on both Windows 2000, Cygwin running on Windows 2000 and Linux. I have every reason to believe that it will run on my new Mac OS X box, but time has not yet permitted me to validate this.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe advantage of this is that I have no idea where the file is and have no need to know. The file gets created at the start of the test and deleted at the end of the test. I did it that way because I was new to Junit and few of my test files seemed similar enough to factor them out into the setUp or tearDown.<br/>\n<br/>\nSimon<br/>\n<br/>\n-----------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nSimon P.
