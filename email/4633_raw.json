Nor will it make JUnit any more difficult to understand. But it \n&gt;will enable new JUnit users to have more utilities at their fingertips. I \n&gt;think that most users are confused initially when they come to JUnit \n&gt;because it doesn&#39;t do a whole lot. Personally, I don&#39;t care a whole lot \n&gt;for my own use, but I think that adding some more utilities to JUnit will \n&gt;enhance it&#39;s out-of-the-box usability. The power users will eventually get \n&gt;under the hood and make extensions where it suits them.\n&gt;\n&gt;What&#39;s confusing to me about the assert class is that it only goes part \n&gt;of the way. It provides a bunch of assertions but then an arbitrary line \n&gt;in the sand has been drawn to say that these are all that anyone should \n&gt;need. This is confusing. I would rather see the Assert class simplified \n&gt;down to only one method: assertTrue. This would then beg for the \n&gt;extensibility you describe and the framework would at least be consistent. \n&gt;Otherwise, we should recognise the Assert class as a utility for \n&gt;programmers and load it up. You don&#39;t have to the methods there if you \n&gt;don&#39;t want to.\n&gt;\n&gt;Chris\n&gt;\n&gt;-----Original Message-----\n&gt;From: Shane Celis\n&gt;Sent: Friday, April 05, 2002 2:03 PM\n&gt;To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;Subject: Re: [junit] assertContains? -&gt; junit development question?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;I have to disagree.  I like the fact that the JUnit framework is itself\n&gt;small, easy to comprehend, therefore making it easy to extend.  One\n&gt;thing that perturbs me about the Assert class is the fact that it&#39;s\n&gt;static.  If I want to override assertTrue() globally, for instance to\n&gt;provide more verbose output, or to change it&#39;s behavior so that a\n&gt;failure won&#39;t result in an exception being thrown thereby discontinuing\n&gt;the rest of the test, I have to edit the JUnit Assert class itself.  If\n&gt;Assert were an instance class I could avoid this, and easily add the\n&gt;assert extensions that everyone is asking for.\n&gt;\n&gt;I do believe that they should be extensions to JUnit, without bloating\n&gt;the original Assert class.\n&gt;\n&gt;-shane\n&gt;\n&gt;p.s.  Yes, I could make my own base TestCase class, but this doesn&#39;t\n&gt;work retroactively, and certainly isn&#39;t a solution I would want to\n&gt;foster for Assert Extension classes.\n&gt;\n&gt;On Friday, April 5, 2002, at 11:42  AM, Chris Eppstein wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; So your argument is that we really don&#39;t need anything other than\n&gt; &gt; assertTrue? I&#39;d have to disagree.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; JUnit is a TESTING FRAMEWORK. By using it, testing should be made\n&gt; &gt; easier. I&#39;d like to not have to reinvent the wheel for many of these\n&gt; &gt; assertions. I understand that I can easily write my own assertion\n&gt; &gt; library in just a couple hours but why should I have to? Certainly,\n&gt; &gt; after years of use, we have identified many assertions that would be\n&gt; &gt; useful to the community at large. As they are identified, it seems\n&gt; &gt; natural for JUnit to provide them in future releases.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; -Chris\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; &gt; From: J.

I now believe it&#39;s cleaner\n&gt; &gt; simply\n&gt; &gt; to build a lot of custom methods answering boolean, then using\n&gt; &gt; assertTrue() and\n&gt; &gt; assertFalse(). What changes in your example is the condition, and not\n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; assertion mechanism.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; You create your own abstract TestCase class with your custom\n&gt; &gt; boolean-logic\n&gt; &gt; methods.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; public abstract class MyTestCase extends TestCase {\n&gt; &gt;     public static boolean containsText(final String string, final String\n&gt; &gt; pattern) {\n&gt; &gt;         return string.indexOf(pattern) &gt;= 0;\n&gt; &gt;     }\n&gt; &gt;     ...\n&gt; &gt; }\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; public class SomeTest extends MyTestCase {\n&gt; &gt;     public void testSomething() {\n&gt; &gt;         assertTrue(containsText(&quot;Hello&quot;, &quot;el&quot;));\n&gt; &gt;     }\n&gt; &gt; }\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Of course, after enough of this, your code starts to look like\n&gt; &gt; procedural\n&gt; &gt; programming code, because what you REALLY want is to extend String,\n&gt; &gt; which you\n&gt; &gt; can&#39;t do. If you really want to, you can wrap String and provide the\n&gt; &gt; extra\n&gt; &gt; methods.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; public class MyString {\n&gt; &gt;     private final String string;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;     public MyString(final String aString) {\n&gt; &gt;         string = aString;\n&gt; &gt;     }\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;     public boolean contains(final String pattern) {\n&gt; &gt;         return string.indexOf(pattern) &gt;= 0;\n&gt; &gt;     }\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;     public boolean matchesRegex(final String regex) {\n&gt; &gt;         // ORO magic...\n&gt; &gt;     }\n&gt; &gt; }\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; It&#39;s cleaner in one respect and uglier in another.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; J.
