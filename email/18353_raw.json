I want to testh this code in a dynamic enviroment, meaning the system will be feed with different xml files using diffrent permutation and combination. For instance if the current version installed is 7.1.1 and the xml file feed has a version 7.0.1 the code will return 0, if the current version is 6.1.5 and the xml file reads 7.1.0 the code will return 7.1.0 Hence I will never be sure of the expected result. \n\nIs there any other way to test the code sent earlier, \n\n1. In term of usability\n2. In term of testing exception\n3. In term of results\n\nThanks\nAviansh\n\n\n----- Original Message ----\nFrom: Shane Mingins &lt;shane.mingins@...&gt;\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSent: Tuesday, 14 November, 2006 1:50:06 PM\nSubject: Re: [junit] Promlem in writing Test case\n\nOn 11/14/06, avinash anand &lt;avinash_anand@ yahoo.co. uk&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hi All\n&gt; I am writing a test case in JUnit. The original class GetInfo.java has a method. String getSystemVersion( String str) which is under test. This method is supplied with path variable in form of string from where it reads a xml file to get certain data and return back to the user.\n&gt;\n&gt; The point of confussion for me is to how to test the method. What should be the actual and expected result. Meaning for getting the expected result I will have to use the same logic as it is in the main code, if I use the same logic to read the xml file then the assert statement would not be meaningful as then the expected and actual results would be same.\n\nI am not sure why you have to use the same logic to calculate the\nexpected result?\n\nYou have an xml file that u will use for the test (I personally might\ndo something different) in which you know what version you expect back\n... so you code assert_equals( 0,\ngetinfo.getSystemVe rsion(fileToRetu rnZero)) etc.\n\ncheers\nshane\n\n\n\nSend instant messages to your online friends http://uk.messenger.yahoo.com \n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n",
