I know which I&#39;m gonna do.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;There is of course at least a third option: uninstall JTest <br/>\n&gt;and ship tested, optimal code nevertheless... ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>While unit tests are a Very Good Thing(tm) they are not 100% of the testing that should be performed on a body of code. So, I know that I will be using a combination of Jtest and Junit for a long time to come. If you write optimal code without the need for automated testing tools, then I salute you! :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; I would actually interpret these exceptions as an indication <br/>\n&gt;of some extra guard conditions and more defensive programming <br/>\n&gt;needed within the tested code. If a piece of called code <br/>\n&gt;cannot handle unexpected inputs, then the fault lies with the <br/>\n&gt;code and not the inputs. :-)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I disagree. If the input violates a precondition, the fault <br/>\n&gt;lies with the input, by definition.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I wholeheartedly disagree with you. It makes no difference what your &quot;contract&quot; is between a piece of software and it&#39;s callers, if the software doesn&#39;t check it&#39;s own inputs then it is at fault.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, some pieces of functionality may not be critical enough to code guard conditions upon, an example might be getters and setters, or some simple string or mathematics functions. But there are going to be some where the functionality is going to be be of a life-threatening level and I know that I&#39;d want a VERY robust guard condition on that code. An example of such a critical piece of code might be for Radiation Treatment units. I don&#39;t care how many documents you have that say that the output requested will never be above n units of radiation, I&#39;m gonna build a guard condition into my code to make certain that it could never happen.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Regards, Ilja<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Simon<br/>\n<br/>\n-----------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nSimon P.
