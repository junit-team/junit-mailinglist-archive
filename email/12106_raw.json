My \nconcern is that I can&#39;t figure out a good way to write these tests \nwithout relying on other DAO methods.\n\nFor example, my employeeDAO might have a createEmployee(Employee \nemployee) method and a getEmployeeById(Integer id) method.  Almost \nall of my tests rely on a employee record being pre-populated.  For \nnow, I&#39;m calling my createEmployee DAO method in setup() so every \ntest has it.  Then I call the deleteEmployee(Employee employee) \nmethod in tearDown().  It bothers me somewhat to have to do this as \nI would prefer to only call those methods within their corresponding \ntest methods.  \n\nI&#39;ve looked at DBUnit.  The problem here is that I still have to \npopulate my bean from the database - then I&#39;m back to calling a DAO \nmethod like getEmployeeById in every method - an undesirable \ndependency.  Another option I guess would be to have some DAO \nmethods used only for testing but this seems overkill.  I&#39;d rather \nuse the database during testing too, not mock objects.\n\nSo, I guess my questions are:\n\n1.)Is there a good way to test DAOs in isolation, without relying on \nother DAO methods?\n2.)Does it really matter that much anyway if I use other DAO \nmethods?  I mean, the goal is for ALL tests to pass anyway.  It can \nbe confusing if your testDeleteEmployee method fails due to a \nfailure in createEmployee which you have to call first, but I guess \nit wouldn&#39;t take long to figure out what really happened.\n\nAny feedback would be appreciated.\nThanks,\nMike\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
