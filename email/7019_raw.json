B. Rainsberger&quot; &lt;jbr@...&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Hear, hear.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The goal of Programmer Tests is to for the programmer to:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; * have tangible evidence of progress\n&gt;&gt; * clarify the needs of the design\n&gt;&gt; * &quot;eat his own dog food&quot; by being forced to write client code before\n&gt;&gt; writing provider code\n&gt;&gt; * keep focus on small steps\n&gt;&gt; * avoid writing too much code in one flow\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I don&#39;t see how a dedicated unit tester can make that happen for a\n&gt;&gt; programmer.\n&gt;\n&gt;That is all true - but I didn&#39;t say that a dedicated unit tester&#39;s\npurpose\n&gt;was to replace TDD - what I said was that the dedicated unit tester\nhelped\n&gt;in getting more and better tests earlier. A dedicated unit tester also\n&gt;helps\n&gt;introduce the concept and value of unit and early testing to teams,\n&gt;management, companies and developers. This helps get your foot in the\ndoor.\n\nI didn&#39;t realize that there was all this context around the issue, so I\napologize if my entry into the discussion was off base.\n\n&gt;You have to remember that there are a lot of companies out there that\ndon&#39;t\n&gt;practice XP or even halfway decent practices, &lt;snip /&gt;\n\nOh, I know. I&#39;ve worked for them. I&#39;m in the XPAdoption group, trying\nto figure out how to change all that. I&#39;m convinced that the only thing\nto do is to start my own shop, but I don&#39;t have the business and\nmarketing knowledge to run it, nor do I have the funds to pay someone\nelse to run it on day one.\n\n&lt;snip /&gt;\n&gt;Early testing has a value all its own, whether it is accomplished by\nTDD,\n&gt;or\n&gt;dedicated unit testers or both. &lt;snip /&gt;\n\nNo argument there. My concern is that everyone wants to test, but not\neveryone has the same goals. In this case, I think it&#39;s important to\nidentify each person&#39;s (role&#39;s?) goals, then partition the work in a\nway that there is sufficient overlap for crosschecking, but not so much\nthat we&#39;re all doing Solo Testing, but duplicating effort.\n\nIn that vein, I place more value on a dedicated tester (someone with\nTesting Skill) doing integration-or-bigger testing, and leave the\ntesting of individual units of work to the people building them.\n\nThe more tests, the merrier, but let&#39;s not all try to write the same\ntests.\n&lt;snip /&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I feel appropriately inspired. Let me write the article, then I&#39;ll\nbe\n&gt;&gt; back. :)\n&gt;\n&gt;I don&#39;t see the need. \n\nOthers may see the need. :)\n\n&gt;As I said I don&#39;t see a conflict between TDD and\n&gt;independent unit testing. The two can coexist. The only danger I would\nsee\n&gt;with both coexisting is that the developer may adopt the attitude that\n&gt;since\n&gt;there is an independent unit tester, that there is no reason for\nhim/her to\n&gt;do TDD. \n\nPerhaps that is the article that needs to be written.\n\n&lt;snip /&gt;\n&gt;If I had developers that wrote poor tests because they felt the unit\n&gt;testers\n&gt;would catch the bugs anyway, I would probably approach the situation\nthe\n&gt;same as if I had a developer who wrote poor code because testers would\n&gt;sooner or later find any bugs. If they couldn&#39;t be made to see the\nwisdom\n&gt;of\n&gt;early testing and TDD, then I would probably replace them with someone\nwho\n&gt;did.\n\nI might approach the situation by explaining that the tests in TDD are\nnot meant to test, but rather the guide the design. In that light,\nsurely outside testing looks like a good idea.\n\n&lt;snip /&gt;\n&gt;The original question was not about TDD vs. independent unit testing,\nthe\n&gt;original question was how do you justify either one to management and\n&gt;project teams.\n\nThis is where my ignorance shines. I don&#39;t know how to convince anyone\nof anything, so I&#39;m content to let others try to do it.\n\n&lt;snip /&gt;\n&gt;Also, as I said, don&#39;t make the mistake of hubris in thinking that TDD\nis\n&gt;going to find all the bugs and that an independent unit tester\nwouldn&#39;t\n&gt;find\n&gt;at least some also - I dare say that an independent unit tester would\n&gt;probably find numerous bugs. Hire me and I will prove it to you. ;-)\n\nWell, of course TDD won&#39;t find all the bugs. TDD isn&#39;t about finding\nbugs.\n\n\nJ. B.
