Of course, Java makes 100%<br/>\n&gt; &gt; reliability impossible, but it would seem that examining the classpath<br/>\n&gt; &gt; could<br/>\n&gt; &gt; allow some magic to be worked. It would also seem the kind of problem<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; someone out there may have already solved. Anyone have a pointer?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; TestNG has code that does that (you can basically specify &#39;run all the<br/>\n&gt; classes in the package &quot;com.foo.mytests&quot;&#39;, and we even support wildcards).<br/>\n&gt; Not sure where your 80% figure comes from, because I can promise you it<br/>\n&gt; works 100% of the time (even though it relies on a few things that are<br/>\n&gt; only<br/>\n&gt; loosely documented in the ClassLoader API).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Feel free to grab the code.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; Cédric<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>",
