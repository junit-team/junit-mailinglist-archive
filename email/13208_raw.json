It takes an input file executes all \nthe\n&gt; &gt; attribute values and throws an exception if there is an error. \nThere\n&gt; &gt; are about 150+ of these files. To fix it up I wrapped it in \nJunit. Now\n&gt; &gt; each executed file is treated as an individual test. This works \ngreat,\n&gt; &gt; I have a nice gui telling me which testfiles passed and which \nfailed.\n&gt; &gt; The problem is that it doesnt tell me why they fail. the original\n&gt; &gt; program still throws an exception but Junit cannot hear it. Is \nthere\n&gt; &gt; any way of directing the error to Junit? thanks Jonno\n&gt; \n&gt; It depends how you wrapped with JUnit. If you wrap each file in a \ntest, \n&gt; then does your test handle exceptions thrown from the file? If so, \ndon&#39;t \n&gt; handle the exceptions, and JUnit will handle them for you.\n&gt; \n&gt; I would need to see code to give better advice.\n&gt; -- \n&gt; J. B. (Joe) Rainsberger\n&gt; Diaspar Software Services\n&gt; http://www.diasparsoftware.com\n&gt; Author, JUnit Recipes: Practical Methods for Programmer Testing\n\nI took out the exception handling and that did it, but I think this \nmight not be the best way to go about it. I`m going to go and do a \nbit of redesign. Thanks for the help anyway, its much appreciated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
