However, I&#39;m still curious to know...\n&gt;\n&gt; I think we&#39;re ready to cut a 4.10 beta 1 release from head, including\n&gt; a raft of bug fixes, most notably the fix in the contents of junit-dep\n&gt; as released to maven.  Of those of you who plan on being beta-testers:\n&gt;\n&gt; 1) Is there anyone who plans to download the jar directly from github\n&gt; for testing?\n&gt; 2) Is there anyone who plans to set the junit version in their pom to\n&gt; 4.10-SNAPSHOT, and add https://oss.sonatype.org/content/groups/public\n&gt; as a snapshot repository, in order to test through maven?\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m happy to support both beta-release paths if it turns out people\n&gt; are using both.\n&gt;\n&gt;   David Saff\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
