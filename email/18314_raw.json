The &quot;state machine&quot; uses the\n&gt; &quot;Entity Introspector&quot; as reference to know what to do. This\n&gt; introspector is the real focus in this case;\n&gt; Right now I&#39;m trying check all &quot;info entities&quot; and &quot;info properties&quot;\n&gt; supposed to be generated for a &quot;entity introspector&quot;. A &quot;info\n&gt; property&quot; and a &quot;info entity&quot; is &quot;meta-data&quot; generated by the &quot;Entity\n&gt; Introspector&quot;. For to do that I need create and populate all entities\n&gt; inside of some container and check the respective existence of some\n&gt; &quot;info property&quot; and &quot;info entity&quot; one-by-one; this is very tedious.\n&gt; For make this more affordable I&#39;m thinking in use generics in test cases.\n\nTwo things:\n\n1. If you a really testing the entity introspector, then I believe you \nshould try to test it directly, instead of testing it with the state \nmachine. What would that test look like?\n\n2. Very often I try to generalize quickly, because I believe I \nunderstand a design concept. When I try to write the general case, I \nfind it difficult, so I start by writing 3 specific cases, then observe \nthe patterns, then extract the general case from them. I believe it \ntakes less time for me to do that, compared to trying the general case \nand failing to do it correctly.\n\n&gt; Your Portuguese is perfect:D\n\nNao, el portugues de /Babelfish/ e perfeito. :) [This was /my/ Portuguese.]\n\nTake care.\n-- \nJ.
