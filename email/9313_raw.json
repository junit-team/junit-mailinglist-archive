Think about what it has to do in different situations....\nwrite that down in the tests.   Think:\n- What has to be true after it does that?  make that an assertion.\n- How do I make it do that?  put that call before the assertion.\n- What needs to be in place so that it can do that? that&#39;s your fixture.\n\nDave\n\n\n",
