Okay fine, but\nI was wondering how people solve/resolve the following type of dependency.  \n\nIf I have three classes A, B and C where A delegates some functionality to B\nwhich delegates to C.  During my implementation and unit testing I write\ntests for C then implement the desired functionality in C.  I then repeat\nthe process for B and A, okay fine.  But now I have an implied unit test\ndependency don&#39;t I?  So when running my tests as a suite I really want my\ntest cases to run in the order C, B, A and never any other order because if\nthe defect is in C then I want to know about it from C and not from A or B.\n\n\nI am currently implementing a small library that does a lot of this style of\ndelegation, and being reasonably new to JUnit I wondered how other people\nwork round this issue especially since those nice Eclipse people provide a\nhelpful &quot;run all tests in a package option&quot;.\n\nThanks inadnavce\n\nJonathan\n\n",
