For example, JUnit4Runner is an internal<br/>\n&gt; class (I know I should not depend on internal classes but it made the<br/>\n&gt; work so easy).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>As extenders may have noticed, with 4.5, we&#39;re trying to be kinder to<br/>\npeople that have extended internal classes in 4.4, and will likely<br/>\ncontinue a kinder social contract into the future.  We&#39;ve found that<br/>\nit&#39;s taken a long while to settle on the internal structure of the<br/>\ndefault JUnit 4 class runner, so it&#39;s going to stay in the internal<br/>\npackage for at least another version, to indicate that this code is<br/>\nstill much less stable than the public API&#39;s, but we&#39;ll work harder to<br/>\nmake sure that custom runners that compile without deprecation<br/>\nwarnings in 4.(x) will still work in 4.(x+1).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; So the Eclipse version, which ships with JUnit 4.3 could not depend on<br/>\n&gt; the same base class as the JUnit 4.4-based version, which ships with<br/>\n&gt; IntelliJ.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I didn&#39;t know IntelliJ had caught up.  Good for them.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Also, I *think* the version of the jar that ships with Eclipse is<br/>\n&gt; missing the classes in the internal package.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think that&#39;s true.  What led you to think that?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\n   David Saff</div>",
