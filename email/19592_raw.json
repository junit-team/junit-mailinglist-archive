My p=\r\noint is just that I suspect you are\nonly thinking of JUnit-based unit tests=\r\n.  And I would\nagree that 14 hours of unit tests seems pretty weird.\nBut we=\r\n&#39;re running JUnit-based system and acceptance\ntests.  In my experience 14 h=\r\nours of automated system\ntesting isn&#39;t that unusual for a reasonably large =\r\nand\ncomplex software system.\n\nAre they all valuable?  Yes, I think so.  The=\r\ny all have\ncaught or could catch bugs.  In fact, if we had time, \nwe would =\r\nwrite more tests that would take even longer\nto run, since I don&#39;t think we=\r\n have the test coverage\nI&#39;d like.\n\nAs far as the speed of feedback for 14 h=\r\nour tests, again\nthese are system (&quot;QA&quot;) type tests.  Comparing a 2 day\nfee=\r\ndback cycle to a 6 week feedback cycle (which is what\nwe&#39;ve had on past pro=\r\njects) the 2 days is obviously a\nmonumental step forward.\n\n\nTodd.\n\n",
