And implement the actual business logic\nin normal Java classes. That way you&#39;re able to unit test your business\nlogic using a normal JUnit approach. What do you think of this approach?\nAnd do you have any sources with more information about it? What if\nthere are instances of EJB stuff created inside the class? (Do we need\nJMock?\n\nOne example of this approach:\n\n// I guess a common interface is something you would want\nProcessShoppingInterface {\n   int methodA(int inputOne, int inputTwo);\n}\n\n// The normal class, doing some (imaginary) business logic in the\nmethoA method\n// we can easily test this class using a normal JUnit test\nProcessShoppingCartClass extends ProcessShoppingInterface {\n   int methodA(int inputOne, int inputTwo) {\n      int tmp = inputOne;\n      for (int i=0 ; i &lt; 99 ; i++) {\n         tmp += inputTwo/i;\n         if (tmp &gt; 1000)\n            return tmp;\n         }\n      return tmp * 2;\n   }\n}\n\n// This is the session bean which simply forward calls to an instance\nof the\n// class where the actual logic resides\nProcessShoppingCartStatelessSessionBean extends\nProcessShoppingInterface {&#39;\n   ProcessShoppingCart normal = new ProcessShoppingCart();\n   int methodA(int inputOne, int inputTwo) {\n      return normal.methodA(inputOne, inputTwo);\n   }\n}\n\n= Ejb3Unit =\nI have tried this a bit. But it&#39;s pretty hard to get started as the\nintroductory material are sparse and doesn&#39;t give explanations about why\ncertain things are used, and which alternatives we had. It might be a\ngreat framework for testing, however I am having a hard time with it as\nI would have needed more documentation and tutorials.\n\nHave you tried it? What do you think, is it worth the hassle? Have you\ngot any tips on how to get started with it?\n\n",
