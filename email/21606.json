Do the<br/>\nclasses have to be generated in a test case, or can a pre-running step<br/>\ncompute them all, and a test case can assert that they are all there?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\n   David Saff<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Wed, May 13, 2009 at 12:26 PM, Miles Parker &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:milesparker@...\">milesparker@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Thanks Johannes,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s pretty straightforward in its own way. I need to execute an arbitrary<br/>\n&gt; set of test methods (using @test annotations) against a known -- but not yet<br/>\n&gt; existent at JUnit launch time -- set of classes. Those classes are generated<br/>\n&gt; and compiled in a previous test case within same session and then need to be<br/>\n&gt; loaded dynamically. Ideally, I would present the name of classes as Strings;<br/>\n&gt; I understand that JUnit has a way to do this dynamically for method names<br/>\n&gt; but I can&#39;t find a similar feature for class names -- everything I&#39;ve tried<br/>\n&gt; ends up forcing me to have an explicit compiled reference at test harness<br/>\n&gt; launch time.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And of course I&#39;d really like not to have to write my own runner<br/>\n&gt; implementation. ;) In TestNG I can do this with factories but our build<br/>\n&gt; environment currently only supports JUnit.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Miles<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On Wed, May 13, 2009 at 4:23 AM, Johannes Link &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jl@...\">jl@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; I guess your own runner implementation to use with @RunWith could do the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; trick.
