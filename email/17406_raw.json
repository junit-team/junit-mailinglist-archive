When you mentioned the suite thing, it seeme=\r\nd intuitive. I&#39;d say keep it as it. It certainly makes sense in both situat=\r\nions and it&#39;s clear.\n \nAs for @BeforeSuite/@AfterSuite being more intuitive=\r\n, I don&#39;t agree. It&#39;s more to remember.\n \nIf a class has a suite method, @B=\r\neforeClass happens before that, right? If a class just has a bunch of @Test=\r\n, then it runs before all of them. What is not intuitive about that?\n \nAnd =\r\nif you have both, then what would happen if you had both @BeforeClass and @=\r\nBeforeSuite? I guess @BeforeSuite would happen before @BeforeClass? But tha=\r\nt doesn&#39;t seem to make sense since Class is a bigger &quot;container&quot; of stuff t=\r\nhan &quot;suite&quot; so now we get unexpected or hard to justify results.\n \nNo, I th=\r\nink one set of annotations is wholly adequate, intuitive and simple.\n \nBret=\r\nt\n \nTutorials and Articles\n     http://schuchert.wikispaces.com/\n\n\n\n----- O=\r\nriginal Message ----\nFrom: David Saff &lt;saff@...&gt;\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.=\r\ncom\nSent: Friday, August 11, 2006 1:25:21 PM\nSubject: Re: [junit] JUnit 4 w=\r\nith bea 9.2 workshop\n\nC=C3=A9dric Beust =E2=99=94 wrote:\n&gt; On 8/11/06, Davi=\r\nd Saff &lt;saff@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; There are indeed several ways to achieve t=\r\nhis with JUnit, but why not simply\n&gt; add @BeforeSuite and @AfterSuite?
