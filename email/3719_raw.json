Olivier wrote:\n\n&gt; I use JUnit for about 90% of my code.  I would like to use it for 100% but \n&gt; I consistently find automated testing of certain types of functionality \n&gt; particular difficult to accomplish.  My work is in digital mapping, and I \n&gt; find complex operations on large data sets problematic.\n&gt; \n&gt; Let me give a specific example:\n&gt; \n&gt; I am currently implementing functionality to warp satellite images from one \n&gt; mapping projection to another.  The image is distorted according to a \n&gt; complex formula.  On a low level, I can test that for a given input my \n&gt; implementation of the formula provides the result I expect, but on a higher \n&gt; level I haven&#39;t been able to automate verification of that the final image \n&gt; is correct.  I have only been able to superimpose the result on a \n&gt; background map I know is correct and eyeball the results.\n\nThis sounds like an acceptance test problem to me, not a unit test \nproblem (read or re-read the various XP books on the subject).  In order \nto generate this complex map, you&#39;re iteratively processing data, right? \n  Well, unit test the processing functions to make sure that they&#39;re \ngenerating correct numbers in the simplest cases.  That should already \nbe unit-testable (and it sounds like you&#39;re already on the right track \nthere).  Now, for the large-scale results, write an acceptance test \nfeeding a known good dataset in, save the output as a file (the image is \na file, right?), and bitwise-compare it to a known good output.  I&#39;m \npresuming your model is deterministic and identical inputs always \nproduce identical outputs.  An MD5 checksum can check for you at roughly \nthe speed of disk access for the file.  Script it!\n\nBasically, it sounds hard to unit test because it isn&#39;t a unit test \nproblem.  Treat it on the proper level and it should be much easier. \n(Note that this approach doesn&#39;t always work... some years ago, i was a \nbuild engineer for a cross-platform ERP system.  I wrote a neat little \nscript to diff the 600+ compiled binaries so i knew what changed from \none build to the next.  Worked great on Unix.  But on Windows, the \ncompiler embedded a timestamp in the binary, so no two binaries were \never bitwise-identical.  Sigh.)\n\n-- \n\nDavid Stagner\n\nNational Marrow Donor Program\n3001 Broadway Street NE\nBroadway Ridge Suite 500\nMinneapolis, MN  55413\n\nEmail: dstagner@...\n\n\n\n",
