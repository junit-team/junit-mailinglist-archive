Any framework has a scope, and is an attempt to make\nit easy to do something within that scope.\nThe result of course is that IF you want to do something out of that scope,\nthe framework becomes a limitation.\nI never had to look into the source, did it just out of curiosity anyway,\nthough. And it probably is not very straightforward to understand. \nBut I suspect that the people who discovered Design Patterns/XP/Refactoring\nmight have some idea on Object Oriented design ;-)\nIf it doesn&#39;t work for me straight away, my first idea is to check if I\nunderstand how it should be used.\nBut I hate this attitude in particular: &quot;Junit internals suck. I would love\nto rewrite it, but don&#39;t have the time.&quot; No arguments, or concrete ideas,\njust complaining. \nCould he define the code smell &quot;the code sucks&quot; ?\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Demyanovich, Craig - Apogent [mailto:cdemyanovich@...]\n&gt; Subject: [junit] Do JUnit internals suck?!?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Below is a brief conversation that took place on another \n&gt; mailing list.  The\n&gt; original comment by DS was in response to another person&#39;s question\n&gt; regarding problems using JUnit for testing EJBs.  My text is \n&gt; marked with my\n&gt; initials, CD.  While I will take the advice of DS and have a \n&gt; look at the\n&gt; source, I wanted the group to have access to his opinion, to \n&gt; have feedback\n&gt; that could be used to make JUnit better for the next release.\n&gt; \n&gt; DS &gt; Junit internals suck. I would love to rewrite it, but don&#39;t\n&gt; DS &gt; have the time.\n&gt; \n&gt; CD &gt; I&#39;ve been told before that the JUnit source code serves \n&gt; as a great \n&gt; CD &gt; example for writing good code.  Hence, your statement \n&gt; surprised me.  \n&gt; CD &gt; Since you&#39;re a respected developer of a great \n&gt; application server, I \n&gt; CD &gt; ask that you cite a few examples to support your statement.  I&#39;d \n&gt; CD &gt; really like to hear your side of the story.\n&gt; \n&gt; DS &gt; Read the source, and you will see what I am talking \n&gt; about.  I believe \n&gt; DS &gt; you misunderstood the comments from other people.  JUnit \n&gt; is a good \n&gt; DS &gt; example of successful software development and it is also a good\n&gt; example \n&gt; DS &gt; of XP development.  The problem with XP is that it is \n&gt; not designed for \n&gt; DS &gt; Library software (see the last chapter of the xp book), \n&gt; so it works\n&gt; good \n&gt; DS &gt; at what it was designed for, but it is difficult to \n&gt; expand.  They also \n&gt; DS &gt; use way too much inheritance and not enough interfaces.  \n&gt; Anyway, just \n&gt; DS &gt; read the code and be the judge for yourself.\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;   &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; Craig Demyanovich                      \n&gt; Systems Developer\n&gt; Apogent Technologies\n&gt; (269) 544 - 7514\n&gt; cdemyanovich@... \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
