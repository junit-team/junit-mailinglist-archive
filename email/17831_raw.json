Excess complexity\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n  &gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;  &gt; They make receiving a message more complex, it&#39;s true. They ma=\r\nke\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;  &gt; sending a message much simpler. Or rather, they add more lines =\r\nof\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;  &gt; code on the receiving side; but they eliminate dependencies on =\r\nthe\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;  &gt; sending side. The benefit of those eliminated dependencies is =\r\nvery\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;  &gt; powerful.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; \n&gt;&gt; &gt; I&#39;m not sure I believe the second part. =\r\nIn practice, replacing a\n&gt;&gt; &gt; concrete-class based solution with an interfa=\r\nce-based solution expands\n&gt;&gt; &gt; the complexity for the caller. What used to =\r\nrequire a single class now\n&gt;&gt; &gt; typically requires three: a factory to crea=\r\nte the factory, the factory\n&gt;&gt; &gt; itself, and the interface you&#39;re actually =\r\ntrying to create. I&#39;m not sure\n&gt;&gt; &gt; you really need all that, but you need =\r\nat least two pieces where you\n&gt;&gt; &gt; previously needed one, and in practice t=\r\nhree is what we usually seem to\n&gt;&gt; &gt; end up with. (Think of DocumentBuilder=\r\nFactory, DocumentBuilder, and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Document in JAXP/DOM for example). And o=\r\nf course there are still\n&gt;&gt; &gt; concrete classes for each of these. We&#39;ve tur=\r\nned what could have been\n&gt;&gt; &gt; one concrete class (Document) into six separa=\r\nte pieces! What could have\n&gt;&gt; &gt; been this:\n&gt;&gt; &gt; \n&gt;&gt; &gt; Document doc =3D new =\r\nDocument();\n&gt;&gt; &gt; \n&gt;&gt; &gt; is now this:\n&gt;&gt; &gt; \n&gt;&gt; &gt; DocumentBuilderFactory facto=\r\nry =3D DocumentBuilderFactory.getInstance();\n&gt;&gt; &gt; DocumentBuilder builder =\r\n=3D factory.newDocumentBuilder();\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Document doc =3D builder.newDocument=\r\n();\n&gt; \n&gt; Be careful! The Builder pattern is by no means needed to create an=\r\n\n&gt; instance of an interface. JAXP/DOM combines, for whatever reason, the\n&gt; =\r\nSingleton, Abstract Factory and Builder pattern, when all you really\n&gt; need=\r\n is this:\n&gt; \n&gt; Document document =3D new WritableDocument();\n&gt; \n&gt; I could s=\r\nee using the Builder pattern to simplify the interface for\n&gt; constructing a=\r\n document, separating creating a document from reading it,\n&gt; but by no mean=\r\ns does JAXP/DOM do what it does because of /interfaces/.\n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s true tha=\r\nt if you have a bunch of related interfaces (like in a GUI\n&gt; toolkit), you =\r\nmight want an Abstract Factory, but neither Singleton nor\n&gt; Builder enter t=\r\nhe picture just because you have interfaces.\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; &gt; I fail to see how that=\r\n&#39;s simpler.\n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s not, and interfaces didn&#39;t make it more complex: the =\r\nSingleton,\n&gt; Abstract Factory and Builder patterns did. If this is a repres=\r\nentative\n&gt; example of why you find interfaces unnecessarily complex, then I=\r\n really\n&gt; believe you&#39;re blaming the wrong part of the design.\n&gt; \n&gt; Take ca=\r\nre.\n\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
