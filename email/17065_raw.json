While we have the basic shell in place to make\nuse of it, no=\r\n one has, and our manager wants to start. \n\nI downloaded the jUnitDoclet co=\r\nde so that we could generate a junit\nshell for our whole application, and s=\r\nlowly start filling it out, and\nam encountering a few difficulties. I am tr=\r\nying to getting running in\nEclipse. I have set it up as an external tool as=\r\n per the instructions.\nI have had to do a few fiddly fixes due to spaces be=\r\ning in used here\nand there in our path (source code is in a &quot;Java Source&quot; d=\r\nirectory),\nbut that&#39;s fine, I figured that all out.\n\nWhat I am having troub=\r\nle with, is the classpath. I know I can pass a\nclasspath as a parameter to =\r\nthe run_junitdoclet.bat file, though I am\nhaving difficulty making even tha=\r\nt work. What I would really like, is\nto have it run, using the classpath of=\r\n my specific project. I would\nprefer it being project relevant so that the =\r\nsame logic will work on\nany project. The problem is that as it runs, it cre=\r\nates a whole pile\nof compiler errors indicating that x reference or y packa=\r\nge doesn&#39;t\nexist. Now sometimes, despite that, it will still create the tes=\r\nt\nclass, so ultimately, it seems to work (if you just ignore over a\nhundred=\r\n error mesages). Other times, it seems there are too many\nerrors for the te=\r\nst class to get written. This really prevents me from\njust trying to build =\r\nevery class in our application (way to many to go\none by one).\n\nSo...can I =\r\nget it to use the project classpath, if not, what am I\nmissing from passing=\r\n in classpath as a parameter. I added \n\n&quot;.&#92;Web Content&#92;WEB-INF&#92;lib&quot;\n\nas a c=\r\nlasspath parameter, which does help, as I don&#39;t seem to get any\nerrors for =\r\nany jar files that fall into this area, and this is\n*always* a relevant are=\r\na, but we do reference other jar files as well,\nin some cases other project=\r\ns, and in some cases external directories\nentirely (like Tomcat&#39;s common&#92;li=\r\nb folder). I tried extending it to..\n\n&quot;.&#92;Web Content&#92;WEB-INF&#92;lib;C:&#92;Tomcat =\r\n5.0&#92;common&#92;lib&#92;&quot;\n\nand I get an error\n\n&quot;Content&#92;WEB-INF&#92;lib was unexpected a=\r\nt this time.&quot;\n\nso I am getting a little puzzled, and I just realized how lo=\r\nng this\nmessage is, thanks for geting this far.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
