Her<br/>\n&gt; argument was that unit tests, as performed today, are able to check<br/>\n&gt; only a specific path on the code, the path stablished by initial<br/>\n&gt; conditions. Instead, she performed specificacion checking using<br/>\n&gt; theorem provers and other advanced tools. This has made me think<br/>\n&gt; about the utility of unit testing and the level of code reliability<br/>\n&gt; that unit testing can provide.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What do you have to say about this? Could it have an impact on unit<br/>\n&gt; testing and, specifically, on JUnit?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I have a simple observation to make on this topic.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have seen unit testing work on many kinds of problems.
