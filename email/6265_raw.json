If you don&#39;t know\n&gt;&gt;about it, Google it, download it and try it. It&#39;s\n&gt;&gt;not quite what you\n&gt;&gt;want, but it can be used to build and test your\n&gt;&gt;product every &#39;n&#39;\n&gt;&gt;minutes, and only if there has been CVS activity in\n&gt;&gt;the meantime.\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Actually I already use CruiseControl and you are\n&gt;correct it is not quite what I had in mind.\n&gt;\n&gt;The scenario I am most interested in is a single\n&gt;developer working on a small section of the code on\n&gt;his/her own machine. They want to run tests regularly,\n&gt;during development, but why should they run the whole\n&gt;suite every time, when they are only changing a small\n&gt;section. The time it takes to do a test run is one of\n&gt;the major hurdles to getting developers to run the\n&gt;tests in the first place.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\nThis is exactly why I prefer to manually build test suites at arbitrary \nlevels.  I might have a DatabaseTestSuite that I run when working in the \npersistence layer, or a StressTestSuite to run all the \nperformance-related tests.  I can pick a suite at the appropriate level \nof granularity in the system and run it.  There are certainly times when \nI manually run all the unit tests in the system, and I also use Anthill \nto do that automatically on a set schedule, but there are times when I \nwant finer-grained control.\n\nMike\n\n-- \nMike Clark\nhttp://clarkware.com \n(720) 851-2014\n\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
