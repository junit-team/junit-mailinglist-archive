What I do is define some String constants in a relevant class that defines the basic reasons (read Categories) of things that are ignored, so I can do a where-used with my IDE to find which tests are ignored under that category. (Not that I have to do it that often, but I found the approach gives me everything I need).<br/>\n<br/>\nYishai<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, David Saff &lt;david@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 2009/11/20 CÃ©dric Beust â&quot; &lt;cbeust@...&gt;:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; On Fri, Nov 20, 2009 at 7:07 PM, Georg &lt;le_garcon_enerve@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Hi David,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Did you gave thoughs to cases where one would like to exclude certain<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; tests? E.g.: run all tests that are not in (a) certain category(s)? This is<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; probably not difficult add in one way or another onto the concept of<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; categories, but the answer to &quot;which test is now acctually included&quot; could<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; become confusing in cases where a test is in an included and an excluded<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; category. I would like to see something here that does not require a lot of<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; browsing through hierarchies of suites nad categories. This may in my<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; approach not well solved either as suites can extend on other suites: if a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; referenced suite includes a certain test, it is executed even if the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; extending suite excludes a test.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; And more fundamentally: is the idea/need of exclusion meaningfull or just a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; result of badly organising tests (I&#39;d say no, but I may be wrong)?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; For what it&#39;s worth, excluding tests is a very popular TestNG features. Â For<br/>\n&gt; &gt; example, I use it when a few tests are broken and need to remain so for a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; while: Â I put them in the group &quot;broken&quot;, which I always exclude during my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; runs.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; When the time to ship approaches, I look at all the tests in the &quot;broken&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; category and I go fix them then.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; For this particular use case, I&#39;ve found @Ignore generally useful.  I<br/>\n&gt; also really love Kevin Lawrence&#39;s idea of marking tests with bug<br/>\n&gt; numbers.  He does it like this:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; @Test public void shouldntDeleteAllTheUsersFiles() {<br/>\n&gt;   bug(34456);<br/>\n&gt;   ...<br/>\n&gt; }<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The test only starts failing once bug 34456 is marked as fixed in the<br/>\n&gt; bug system.  Once we have failing assumptions working as they truly<br/>\n&gt; should, this will be easy to implement on the JUnit side, although the<br/>\n&gt; bug-system integration would still be up to individual extenders or<br/>\n&gt; teams.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; All this is to say that I do get the idea of excluded categories, but<br/>\n&gt; this particular instance doesn&#39;t immediately convince me.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;    David Saff<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; --<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ***CÃ©dric<br/>\n&gt; &gt; *<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
