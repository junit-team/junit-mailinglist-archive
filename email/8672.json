I will try different jvms. I was running<br/>\n1.4.1_02 on linux.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Why do you want to run unit tests in JWS?<br/>\n&gt; Won&#39;t the JWS startup time and the deployment slow<br/>\n&gt; down unit testing to much?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Call me crazy, but I though it would be cool to provide a link so that<br/>\nuser&#39;s on a platform that I don&#39;t have access to ( Mac OS X for<br/>\nexample ) could click a link in the application or from the project<br/>\nhomepage and see all the unit tests run on their machine.<br/>\n<br/>\n99% of the time the tests would be run from an ant script, within the<br/>\napplication&#39;s help menu, IDE, or command-line, but once in awhile it<br/>\nis handy to run the tests without checking out from CVS, installing<br/>\ndependent libraries, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I was thinking of it as the webstart version of <br/>\n&#39;make test&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again for your time.</div>",
