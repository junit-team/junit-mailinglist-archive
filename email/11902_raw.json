They are simple codes that writes into the database. The rule is a\n&gt; Project must be added before a Experiment can be added. This is\n&gt; because Experiment has a foreign key that points to Project.\n\nOK. Project [1]--&gt;[*] Experiment.\n\n&gt; In my ProjectTest I have a testCreateProject test. But in my\n&gt; ExperimentTest where I have my testCreateExperiment test, I need to\n&gt; create a project before it will be successful.\n&gt; \n&gt; Whats the practice for this? Do I put the createProject inside my\n&gt; testCreateExperiment method? Then I will be actually testing two different\n&gt; class (Project and Experiment) in a single method\n&gt; (testCreateExperiment)..\n\nI don&#39;t agree with this last statement.\n\nIn what state does your environment need to be to test creating an \nexperiment? It appears that there must be a project in the database with \na known project primary key first. In that case, put one there -- this \nis what setUp() is for. In TestExperiment.setUp(), then, invoke \ncreateProject().\n\nRather than /testing/ createProject(), you are /using/ createProject() \n-- assuming that it works -- to test createExperiment(). I&#39;m not sure \nthat that&#39;s wise, but that&#39;s another subject, covered in depth in _JUnit \nRecipes_.\n\n&gt; If anyone is going to suggest control the order of executing the test (i.e.\n&gt; run ProjectTest before ExperimentTest), note that I need the return value\n&gt; from testCreateProject in testCreateExperiment.\n\nThat&#39;s fine -- store that value in a field of TestExperiment and let \ntestCreateExperiment() use that field.\n-- \nJ.
