Thank you for caring about such things.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are no coding standards for JUnit users. There are various<br/>\ncommunity agreed best practices, but I&#39;m not sure if they&#39;re written<br/>\ndown anywhere. The first place that I&#39;d look would be the JUnit FAQ.<br/>\nAs I look at it, it does have a section titled best practices.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://junit.sourceforge.net/doc/faq/faq.htm\">http://junit.sourceforge.net/doc/faq/faq.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThe next thing I&#39;d do would be to use a search engine, we like Google<br/>\naround here, and I&#39;d search on keywords such as &quot;JUnit best practices&quot;<br/>\nor some such similar thing and see what you get.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe third thing that I&#39;d do would be to start cranking out test cases.<br/>\nThere is no teacher better than experience and in truth, that&#39;s how<br/>\nmany of us learned to use JUnit (rumour has it that J.B. was born<br/>\nalready knowing the deeper secrets of JUnit and that the text of JUnit<br/>\nRecipes is encoded in his DNA).<br/>\n<br/>\nA great place to start with writing JUnit tests is the Java API. Pick<br/>\nan object, String is a good candidate, and start writing tests for it.<br/>\nYou will amaze yourself with how quickly you&#39;ll get the hang of<br/>\nwriting tests by even such a simple exercise. It&#39;ll also help your<br/>\nunderstanding of the String class, and that&#39;s a good thing too.<br/>\n<br/>\nSimon<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nsimonpeter.org | simonpeter.com | techbook.info</div>",
