I think this\nis the easiest and most straightforward solution for me at the moment\n(assuming I can work out the correct RegEx!).\n\nBut given that this must be a common case, I really think this should\nbe pointed out somewhere in the Clover docs.  Anyway, thanks to all\nwho responded...\n\nPat.\n\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, Neil Swingler &lt;neil@s...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; There are other idioms for testing exceptions which will actually be\nsupported by using clover.\n&gt; e.g.\n&gt; try\n&gt; {\n&gt;   somethingDangerous();\n&gt; }\n&gt; catch(Exception exception)\n&gt; {\n&gt;   assertEquals(&quot;message&quot;, exception.getMessage());\n&gt; }\n&gt; \n&gt; in this case clover will warn you if the test passed but the\nexception was never thrown i.e. we don&#39;t need the fail any more\nbecause we&#39;ve got clover\n&gt; \n&gt; - Neil\n&gt; \n\n\n\n\n\n",
