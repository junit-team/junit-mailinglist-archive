Also, \n&gt; sometimes t=\r\nhe build system or political structure of a team can \n&gt; make it easier to e=\r\ndit XML files than Java, in which case the \n&gt; ant file might make sense.\n\nS=\r\nome details on the environment:\n\n* Rather small project and team (3-4 activ=\r\ne developers, \nincluding myself), \n* Rather vanilla J2EE web application (S=\r\ntruts-based web gui and \nHibernate+RDBMS backend)\n* Rather mature developme=\r\nnt stage\n* All main activities (development, deployment and testing) are \np=\r\nerformed entirely with the IDE (Eclipse)\n* Currently lacking an automated t=\r\nesting/build environment (i.e. \neverything is done manually)\n\ncould these b=\r\ne of any help in making a decision (or in finding a \ntradeoff)...?\n\nThanks\n=\r\nEmmanuele\n\n\n",
