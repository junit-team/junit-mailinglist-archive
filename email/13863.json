Even worse: two possibly overlapping, but often disjoint, sets<br/>\n&gt; of<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; test fixture objects in the same test case class. Some tests use<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; fixture A and others use fixture B. Why not put those in separate<br/>\n&gt; test<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; case classes for clarity?<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; Because of the activation energy required to split off a new class,<br/>\n&gt; move<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; the right methods into it, remember to link it into the next level up,<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; add it to change control, fix the pesky layout infelicities the IDE<br/>\n&gt; likes<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; to avoid providing a configure-out option for, refactor the class<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; comments, etc?<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; [Pairing is good. Would that I could.]<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; It sounds more like quite a viscous environment (either the codebase,<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; the IDE, or a combination of the two): it&#39;s easier to do a bad thing<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; than a good thing.<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; Which IDE, you poor soul? In Eclipse it&#39;s just &quot;new class, copy, run<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; tests, delete, run tests, update, commit&quot;. Well, except for the class<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; comments, I guess. For that you&#39;re on your own. :)<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  Eclipse.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  So that&#39;s &quot;new class&quot;. Copy. Fix layout. Fix suite(). Run tests. Delete<br/>\n&gt;  tests. Run. Delete other tests in other class. Run. Check that the two<br/>\n&gt;  classes are a partition of the original class. (One *must* do this, so<br/>\n&gt;  it&#39;s probably better to do moves than deletes.) Look for shared code<br/>\n&gt;  and partition it or move it to a suitable (possibly new) superclass. <br/>\n&gt;  (There&#39;s usually some helper code like this.) Link the suite() into<br/>\n&gt;  the parent suite. (Yes, we don&#39;t use the automatic recursive suite<br/>\n&gt;  creation. Close call: but sometimes being able to trivially comment<br/>\n&gt;  out subsuites has made bug-tracking much much easier, since we do<br/>\n&gt;  sometimes end up with context-sensitive problems. Perhaps we just <br/>\n&gt;  have too many global caches.) Run complete test suite. Stare hard <br/>\n&gt;  at the new classname, rename to suitable, because now you have to <br/>\n&gt;  introduce it to CVS, and renaming it later is a pain. Perform <br/>\n&gt;  introduction. No, I don&#39;t want the file CVSed when it&#39;s created, since<br/>\n&gt;  if I want to back it out later (when I realise I made a complete mess)<br/>\n&gt;  I don&#39;t want dirty footprints in the repository. OK, everything works.<br/>\n&gt;  Check in. Wait forever for CVS to complete. Time passes. Maybe there&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;  some mail to read? Yes. Whoppee, CVS done. Change to paranoia window.<br/>\n&gt;  CVS update. Wait forever for CVS to complete. Time passes. Mail already<br/>\n&gt;  read, read news instead. CVS completes. ant build, run tests, all pass.<br/>\n&gt;  Hooray! Don&#39;t do this on a Friday afternoon, you&#39;ll likely miss your<br/>\n&gt;  train or break the build.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  Somewhere in there I fixed the auto-layout. And did a CVS update (Wait.<br/>\n&gt;  Time passes. Get tea.) before running the tests. <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  What do you do that if I did it too I could do better? Apart from using<br/>\n&gt;  a faster CVS server, that is.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Or use subversion, which happily allows you to rename files.  ;-)</div>",
