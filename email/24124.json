With a matcher I&#39;m going to get told that object<br/>\ndon&#39;t match with a full list of fields that do and do not match - and<br/>\nsurely everyone checks their test diagnostics before making a test pass?<br/>\n<br/>\n2) I write a test that overrides equals based on all the fields in the<br/>\nobject and I make it go green and all is good with the world.  A<br/>\nrequirement comes in meaning that I want equals to only match on a single<br/>\nfield (Id or something like that), my tests of course still pass.  I then<br/>\ngo and make a change to some code so that checking all fields would fail<br/>\nthe test, but only using the equals method means it passes.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Tue, Nov 20, 2012 at 12:01 PM, halfpirate1210<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bell_beauty12@...\">bell_beauty12@...</a>&gt;wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; **<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi zodiaczx6<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m a little curious; can you please tell me why you&#39;re against doing such<br/>\n&gt; for tests?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Cheers,<br/>\n&gt; halfpirate1210<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, Colin Vipurs &lt;zodiaczx6@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; You&#39;ll need to override equals (and by definition hashCode) on the<br/>\n&gt; objects in your array.

Object A1 contains several<br/>\n&gt; variables and most importantly, an array of objects which are instantiated<br/>\n&gt; from another class (let&#39;s say class B); so the elements in that array are<br/>\n&gt; objects, not data types like int, string, etc.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; So I wanted to test this array of objects with another array of<br/>\n&gt; objects by simply creating another object; A2 from class A. I wanted to<br/>\n&gt; test using assertArrayEquals and the result is red bar.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; So my question is why did the test fail? I&#39;m thinking probably objects<br/>\n&gt; are always different since they are based on reference? But then again<br/>\n&gt; assertArrayEquals checks array length and content.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Many thanks,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; halfpirate1210<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>-- <br/>\nMaybe she awoke to see the roommate&#39;s boyfriend swinging from the<br/>\nchandelier wearing a boar&#39;s head.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomething which you, I, and everyone else would call &quot;Tuesday&quot;, of course.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
