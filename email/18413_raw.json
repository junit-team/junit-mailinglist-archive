I don&#39;t usually associate &quot;clever&quot; with &quot;keep is\n&gt;&gt;simple stupid&quot; but maybe that&#39;s just me.  I think a beautiful JUnit test\n&gt;&gt;would be one that uses both inheritance and the &quot;parameterized test\n&gt;&gt;case&quot; pattern to be as short and sweet (and therefore maintainable) as\n&gt;&gt;possible.\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Personally (and as you say, code beauty is in the beholder&#39;s eye), I\n&gt;wouldn&#39;t count test code that uses the parameterized test case pattern as\n&gt;&quot;beautiful&quot;, because this design pattern only exists to address a limitation\n&gt;in JUnit 3, and for that reason, it obfuscates the code more than it\n&gt;prettifies it (one of the reasons why &quot;modern&quot; test frameworks let you pass\n&gt;parameters directly to your test methods).\n&gt;\n&gt;I would give a similar &quot;thumbs down&quot; to the &quot;exception design pattern&quot;:  it\n&gt;adds a lot of noise to the test code, thereby hiding its true intent (and\n&gt;similarly, it&#39;s been addressed in modern test frameworks by letting users\n&gt;specify that an exception is expected from the test method directly in the\n&gt;annotation).\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nMichael Feathers\nmichaelfeathers.typepad.com\nwww.objectmentor.com\n\n\n",
