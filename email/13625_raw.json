That&#39;s what class invariants are for. Each public \n&gt; method is atomic.=\r\n It is invoked when an object is any legal \n&gt; state and when the method ret=\r\nurns it is always careful to \n&gt; leave the object in one of the legal states=\r\n (barring bad \n&gt; synchronization and complicated multithreaded issues).\n\nTh=\r\nat&#39;s not what I was saying.  I am sure your code won&#39;t crash if the method\n=\r\nis called without these prerequisites, it&#39;s just that it won&#39;t be doing\nany=\r\nthing useful (no-op or throwing an exception), so testing it in these\ncondi=\r\ntions will be useless:  you need to set up these prerequisites before\nyou i=\r\nnvoke the method.\n \n&gt; However, a situation where public method A must be \n&gt;=\r\n invoked before method B is a code smell.\n\nI see code like this every day, =\r\nand it&#39;s not a code smell to me.\n\nIt&#39;s just what a program is about:  the l=\r\nogical execution of statements in a\ncertain order.  Run them in a different=\r\n order and the program no longer does\nwhat it&#39;s supposed to do.\n\nSeriously,=\r\n can you take any two method invocations following each other in\nyour code,=\r\n swap them, and your code still works?!?\n\n-- \nC=E9dric\nhttp://beust.com/web=\r\nlog\n\n\n\n",
