I am not surprised as<br/>\nrunning CppUnit (Eclipse on Windows with CDT) I found it too flaky to<br/>\ncount on.  Is this because the group doesn&#39;t see C++ as a future<br/>\nlanguage?  It might not be.  I lobbied to use Real-Time Java instead<br/>\nof C++, to no avail.  Later, when it was too late to change, the<br/>\nproject manager told me Java would have been a better choice.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Kent Beck&quot; &lt;kentb@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; All,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; At the Agile Open Northwest conference I held an open space session<br/>\non the<br/>\n&gt; future of testing tools. I expected to talk a little about Theories and<br/>\n&gt; assertThat, but we ended up having a wide-ranging discussion about a<br/>\nvariety<br/>\n&gt; of topics. I mind-mapped the result and put in on the conference wiki: <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.agileopennorthwest.com/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?FutureOfUnitTesting\">http://www.agileopennorthwest.com/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?FutureOfUnitTesting</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The most surprising result to me was the interest in language<br/>\nfeatures for<br/>\n&gt; testing-what would a language look like that included<br/>\ndouble-checking as a<br/>\n&gt; first-class concept? I was also surprised at how much commonality<br/>\nthere was<br/>\n&gt; between the unit and functional testing &quot;vendors&quot;, that reporting is<br/>\na big<br/>\n&gt; issue for everyone.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; One thing missing from the discussion was much talk about the hopes and<br/>\n&gt; dreams of users, so I thought I would open up the question here.<br/>\nWhat is it<br/>\n&gt; you wish your testing tool would do for you that it doesn&#39;t?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Cheers,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Kent Beck<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Three Rivers Institute<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
