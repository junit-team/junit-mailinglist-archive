We were looking for a way to enable a\nJUnit test case class to call MyClass methods, then check the state of\nmyList.\n\nHere&#39;s a what we are considering:\n\na.  Make a protected method in MyClass called getMyList that returns\nmyList and performs lazy instantiation (it&#39;ll only instantiate myList\nthe first time it is called but will return myList everytime). \nMyClass should only access myList through this getter.\n\nb. Make a test version of MyClass called something like TestMyClass. \nGive that a public version of the myList attribute called myTestList.\n \n\nc. Override getMyList so it will use myTestList instead of myList.\n\nd. The test case class will instantiate TestMyClass, and call its\nmethods polymorphically through an variable of type MyClass.\n\ne.  When the test case wants to check the list values, it will just\ncast MyClass back to TestMyClass and access the public myTestList.\n\nThe upside of this is that myList gets to remain private in the\nproduction code.  The downside is that we are not actually using\nmyList in the test runs.  My thought was that if myTestList is the\nsame type as myList and the override version of getMyList does exactly\nthe same thing as the production code&#39;s getMyList (except for acting\non the test version of myList), this downside becomes negligible.\n\nNote that we would define TestMyClass as an inner class of the JUnit\ntest case so it will not have a .java file generated for it.\n\nAny thoughts on this approach?  Good?  Bad?  Recommend a different\napproach?\n\nThanks for any feedback!\n\nKen\n\n\n\n\n",
