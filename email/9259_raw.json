But since there are no concrete\nclasses in the library I&#39;m using, there is absolutely\nno way to create proxy objects with any assurance that\nthe replicate the behavior that the library exhibits.\n\nSo it seemed to me that this might be an unusual case\nwhere &quot;ordering&quot; was desirable -- for time&#39;s sake,\nrather than for the correctness of the result.\n\nOr maybe, now that I&#39;ve characterized the problem a\nlittle further, you and other helpful folks on this\nlist will be able to better assist me in finding the\n&quot;one true path&quot; to testing nirvana.\n:_))\n\nJ.

It matters when one fails.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Let&#39;s say that testB uses functions that are tested in testA.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Let&#39;s instead say that TestB collaborates with lightweight objects that \n&gt; provide predictable results according to the behavior we expect of A.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;&gt;During development, I&#39;ll be coding testA first. When that\n&gt;&gt;passes, I&#39;ll move to testB.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;But tests take time. And as the number of tests grows, it\n&gt;&gt;takes longer and longer to get to the last test on the list.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; How long is long? How many tests? What&#39;s your test throughput 100/s? \n&gt; 200/s? Less?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;&gt;So testing in reverse order speeds things up during development.\n&gt;&gt;(Or simply running the last test, rather than all of them.)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;But when running the full suite of tests, it&#39;s helpful to\n&gt;&gt;run them in the original order -- because sometimes a regression\n&gt;&gt;causes a test to fail which was passing earlier, and it&#39;s\n&gt;&gt;good to discover such violated assumptions.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;So there&#39;s a tension between wanting to speed things up\n&gt;&gt;and wanting to verify that previously valid assumptions\n&gt;&gt;still hold.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;The only way I can see to satisfy both goals is to allow\n&gt;&gt;tests to run either from first to last, or from last to\n&gt;&gt;first.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Another option is to execute only the current suite while working on the \n&gt; behavior under test, then execute the full suite when you think you have \n&gt; the behavior under test working.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;&gt;Any other ideas?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Yes. Write faster tests. I usually get up to about 1500 before I start \n&gt; to notice a break in my rhythm. If I notice a break in my rhythm before \n&gt; I hit 1500 tests, then I fix the tests.\n\n\n\n",
