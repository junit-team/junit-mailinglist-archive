Which one is the next one? TestNG?<br/>\nThis custom runner stuff is cool! Keep up the good work!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 9/9/07, David Saff &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:saff@...\">saff@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Joakim,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I think it&#39;s really interesting stuff. I&#39;m not currently using Ruby,<br/>\n&gt; but I have built Java / Ruby hybrid systems in the past, and I think I<br/>\n&gt; would use this if I needed to again in the future. I&#39;m also really<br/>\n&gt; glad to see the custom Runner support get a thorough workout.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; David<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On 9/8/07, Joakim Ohlrogge &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:joakim.ohlrogge@...\">joakim.ohlrogge@...</a>&lt;joakim.ohlrogge%40gmail.com&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hi all, I have been playing with JRuby recently and in particular how<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to embed Ruby in Java applications. I believe that mixing languages<br/>\n&gt; &gt; rather than switching completely from one language to another is going<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to be more and more important. As I explored the subject i found<br/>\n&gt; &gt; myself lacking some tools. I was frustrated by the fact that I had to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; maintain two sets of tests and look for feedback in two different<br/>\n&gt; &gt; locations while developing.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I created a custom runner for JUnit to address the subject and I think<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it looks promising. I created a blog entry with some more details in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; case anyone is interested:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://johlrogge.wordpress.com/2007/09/08/hybrid-theory/\">http://johlrogge.wordpress.com/2007/09/08/hybrid-theory/</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I have some loose plans on open-sourcing this but I would like to see<br/>\n&gt; &gt; if there are others than me that find this interesting enough to be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; worth the effort before I do.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; /Joakim Ohlrogge<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
