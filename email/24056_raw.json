Providing both jars in the zip file as a co=\r\nnvenience for those that download manually is both nice and highlights the =\r\ndependency.\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Paul Holser&quot; &lt;pholser@...&gt; wrot=\r\ne:\n&gt;\n&gt; Marc, I think the way it&#39;s set up for non-Maven users is fine; as a =\r\nMaven user, I&#39;ll be thrilled to depend explicitly only on junit:junit.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n Ultimately I think it&#39;d be great to break JUnit&#39;s dependency on Hamcrest e=\r\nntirely, but I suspect that&#39;s a much more involved effort (JUnit 5?).\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nThanks again!\n&gt; \n&gt; --p\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In junit@yahoogroups.com, Marc Philipp &lt;mph=\r\nilipp82@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Paul,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; we have deprecated the Maven artifa=\r\nct that used to have Hamcrest embedded since that didn&#39;t make any sense fro=\r\nm a Maven point-of-view (see the release notes for details).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The a=\r\nll-in-one JAR (junit.jar) is still offered as a download for users that sim=\r\nply want to get started using JUnit without having to download an extra JAR=\r\n from Hamcrest.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; An alternative would be to remove the two JARs fro=\r\nm the downloads altogether and instead put the Hamcrest JAR along with what=\r\n is now called junit-dep.jar inside the JUnit ZIP file with a simple README=\r\n that explains how to use it. In this scenario, there wouldn&#39;t be an old sc=\r\nhool junit.jar any longer.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; What do you think?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Regards, Ma=\r\nrc\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n",
