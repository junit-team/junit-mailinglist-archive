How would you call the test cases: xxxTest or TestXXX?\n\n2. If there is a class which has to be tested and which throws \ndifferent exceptions: Would you create one test method per each \nexception or one test method per each method which throws it?\n\n3. Would you use class variables to improve perforamance of the \ntests? Or would you not do that because it can mess up the test or \nmake it difficult to read?\n\n4. Do you use the JUnit addons? How likely is it that we will need \nthem?\n\n\n",
