Februar 2=\r\n008 22:34\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: [junit] Re: How would you =\r\narrange tests with jUnit?\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The best thing with JUnit testing is =\r\nto think in terms of\n&gt; behaviours.\n&gt; &gt; What behaviour are you expecting fro=\r\nm your system and write a test\n&gt; for\n&gt; &gt; that. Do not let the fact that som=\r\ne behaviours span \n&gt; multiple objects \n&gt; &gt; while others use only a single m=\r\nethod cause you to lose \n&gt; sight of the \n&gt; &gt; fact that testing is best done=\r\n at the unit level and the most\n&gt; workable\n&gt; &gt; unit is the unit of behaviou=\r\nr.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; You make an excellent point, and something I didn&#39;t realize. \n=\r\n&gt; I was thinking unit testing as &#39;test each method of my class&#39; \n&gt; and make=\r\n sure they work as expected. But really, I&#39;m looking \n&gt; to test and see if =\r\nmy application functionality (behaviour) \n&gt; works. &quot;Can I create a report&quot; =\r\n\n&gt; is what I&#39;m really after...\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks again.\n\nI also make the experien=\r\nce to think in terms of behaviors of the\nclass under test and the methods. =\r\nFor myself I think thats the best\nway to test the special class behavior as=\r\n also method behavior in\none test class. But more over I use the following =\r\nway...\nIf classes have similar behaviors, for example definied by\ninterface=\r\ns or abstract classes I group my tests into similar\nclasses, for example *V=\r\niewTest, *ServiceTest. That saves many\ntime of coding tests for similar cla=\r\nsses with the same expected\nbehavior. The very nice side-effect: test metho=\r\nds stay in the\nright test classes.\n\nImagine you have a complex service with=\r\n dozens of methods and\neach method is definied with up to 5 differently act=\r\nion paths.\nSo you may get up to 100 test methods in one class under test.\nM=\r\ny own solutions is to devide it into some test classes for\nexample an Accou=\r\nntingService that provides serveral methodes\nfor accounting and some other =\r\ncentral accounting information\nto test:\n\nBaseAccountOperationServiceTest\n\t(=\r\ntests the base account operations: add, sub, exceptions)\nAdvancedAccountOpe=\r\nrationServiceTest\n\t(tests the advanced account operations: dispo, change)\nT=\r\nempAccountServiceTest\n\t(tests the additonal behavior of temporary acccounts=\r\n)\nCustomerServiceAccountingServiceTest\n\t(tests the behavior of the Accounti=\r\nngService in conjunction\n\tof the customer service thats used by the Account=\r\ningService)\n\nBack to your case I would write one test class CreateReportRep=\r\nortManagerTest\nto test all behaviors of report creation. I assume that your=\r\n\nReportManager has some other behaviors not only creation. So you write\nExp=\r\nortReportManagerTest, PrintReportManagerTest and some other ...ReportManage=\r\nrTest\nto separate the behavior a little bit. Maybe further development show=\r\ns\nyou some general export or print behavior to test in separate\ntestcases.\n=\r\n\n\n",
