I guess\n&gt; you could code in all the skeleton of the class, with the methods &\n&gt; such (though this won&#39;t compile unless you really do return what you\n&gt; say you will), then write the tests, then add the rest of the code.\n&gt; But I don&#39;t see the great advantage of that, to be honest...\n\nI write the test, then use Eclipse to generate classes, interfaces and \nmethod stubs as I go. When the test compiles, I run it to watch it fail. \nThis way I know my test actually tests /something/. Only then do I make \nit pass.\n\nWhen I do this, I get the opportunity to see my code in black and white \non the screen. I get to ask myself, &quot;Is the design any good?&quot; or more \ncorrectly, &quot;Does the design suck in an obvious way?&quot; I&#39;m surprised how \noften it does. :) It&#39;s often not until I have to /use/ the API that I \nrealize it sucks.\n\nSo that&#39;s how I do it. I tried writing the skeleton code, then writing \nthe test, but I found I couldn&#39;t easily enough track in my head the code \nI needed for the test I wanted to write, so I decided to let the test \npull the code out of me. It works for me.\n\nTake care.\n-- \nJ. B.
