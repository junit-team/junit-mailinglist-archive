I&#39;m really impressed with seriousness you approached to\nacceptance tes=\r\nting.\n\nOn the other hand it seems that much work was involved to make this\n=\r\nacceptance framework work fine.\n\nI would like to make our Selenium tests wo=\r\nrk automatically from CI\nserver (linux server without X), as any JUnit test=\r\n would work. This\nway our Product Owner (yes, we&#39;re Scrumming) could write =\r\nall necessary\nacceptance tests instead of descriptive acceptance criteria.\n=\r\n\nCI is executing &quot;mvn clean install&quot; periodically and it would be great\nif =\r\nwe could automate this process.\n\nAny ideas?\n\nThanks,\nMarko\n \n--- In junit@y=\r\nahoogroups.com, Fredrik Wendt &lt;fredrik@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; On fre, 2009-02-20 a=\r\nt 13:25 +0000, majkic@... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Hi guys,\n&gt; &gt; I need to create automate=\r\nd acceptance tests. Selenium seems to be\n&gt; &gt; nice, since it allows someone =\r\nwithout much (or none at all)\n&gt; &gt; programming experience, as our Product Ow=\r\nner to create those tests\n&gt; &gt; with Firefox Selenium IDE plug-in.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; B=\r\nut time has come to integrate those tests to other JUnit tests, so\n&gt; &gt; thes=\r\ne can be run on CI server.\n&gt; \n&gt; Disclaimer: No JUnit, no Selenium-RC used i=\r\nn the solution below.\n&gt; \n&gt; What we did is to put all Selenium tests (HTML s=\r\nource) in a separate\n&gt; web-app, bundled with Selenium Core and an index.jsp=\r\n that starts the\n&gt; test automatically when called by a browser. (We also ma=\r\nngled Selenium\n&gt; Core to let a USERNAME and PASSWORD Selenium variables be =\r\nset and\n&gt; present in all tests - mangled means five lines of javascript cod=\r\ne.)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; To have it run in a CI environment ... I wrote two applications=\r\n:\n&gt; \n&gt; a) a simple app called &quot;test agent&quot; that can take two commands over\n=\r\n&gt; XML-RPC:\n&gt; a1) start a browser pointing it at a certain URL (pointing to =\r\nthe\n&gt; index.jsp file mentioned above, also telling the browser where the\n&gt; =\r\nselenium result should be posted)\n&gt; a2) stop a browser\n&gt; \n&gt; b) A web-app ca=\r\nlled &quot;test conductor&quot; that \n&gt; b1) keeps track of test agents\n&gt; b2) aggregat=\r\ne results returned from browsers\n&gt; b3) register test new test runs and laun=\r\nch them when test agents become\n&gt; idle\n&gt; \n&gt; This works well and having the =\r\ntest files in HTML (with human readable\n&gt; ID values on all elements the tes=\r\nt interacts with) makes it useful for\n&gt; manual testing as well. Since the w=\r\neb-app with test can be deployed on a\n&gt; developers machine, a developer can=\r\n also ask the test conductor to run a\n&gt; test off the developer&#39;s machine (a=\r\nnd start debugging server side).\n&gt; \n&gt; There&#39;s no JUnit integration. We just=\r\n added a simple script on our CI\n&gt; environment (Hudson) that after each suc=\r\ncessful build of the full\n&gt; software stack does:\n&gt; i) download the build ar=\r\ntifacts, deploy them to a test server\n&gt; ii) register a new test run with we=\r\nb-app b mentioned above\n&gt; iii) waits for b to return a fail/success\n&gt; iv) u=\r\nndeploys the artifacts from step i\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; This was all setup one year ago =\r\n- the client I worked for wasn&#39;t sure\n&gt; what Selenium could do or if they w=\r\nanted to invest time using it. Having\n&gt; the test written/saved in human rea=\r\ndable HTML was a good selling point -\n&gt; if they decided to not go with Sele=\r\nnium then the tests could still be\n&gt; used &quot;as is&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; Since then:\n&gt; Selen=\r\nium 1.0 still hasn&#39;t been released.\n&gt; There&#39;s still no Selenium Driver that=\r\n can use HTML files as source.\n&gt; 3000+ runs completed.\n&gt; We run test agents=\r\n for FF2, FF3, IE7, Safari on Mac.\n&gt; \n&gt; Parts of the test agent and test co=\r\nnductor is BSD-licensed, some parts\n&gt; where developed for the client (and I=\r\n think they&#39;ll be happy to share\n&gt; under BSD-ish license).\n&gt; \n&gt; / Fredrik\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n\n\n\n",
