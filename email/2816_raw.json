Expectations are different.\n\nStill, I would think you could use a thin object to shield the actual \ncomponent from the environment. I work in an identical environment -- for a \nwhile, there, I thought you worked on my project. :) I have a &quot;shield&quot; that \nhandles all the nasty stuff about where to get configuration information and \nhow to translate my logging requests into logging requests for the framework \nand all that, and my actual component code can run outside the framework. \nDoing so makes it so much easier to write unit tests for the &quot;real code&quot; and \nI guess I have to live with how tough it is to test the component shield \nobject. Try as I might, they won&#39;t let me refactor the framework...\n\nSo you could build a bridge, if that helps you. It might be easy.\n\nJBR.\n----- Original message -----\nThe thing to reiterate is that we are testing Components that live in a\nspecific environment, and we must make sure they play nice in that \nenvironment.\n\n[...]\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp\n\n\n",
