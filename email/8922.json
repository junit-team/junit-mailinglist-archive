That doesn&#39;t make them all false,<br/>\n&gt; nor mine meaningless, just not certain. Mine might&#39;ve been<br/>\n&gt; right however I started, perhaps plain luck. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>To me a conclusion which might be right out of plain luck *is*<br/>\nirrelevant.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I write code, I test my code, I debug my code when tests fail<br/>\n&gt; by trying to analyse the output. I was hoping for it to be<br/>\n&gt; easier to analyse, w/o a lot of manual effort, but I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; have an itch big enough to attempt to write such a tool --<br/>\n&gt; especially when it&#39;d be cheap/clean to do it in the<br/>\n&gt; framework.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>So you are actually concerned about who will be writing the code to make<br/>\nit work?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Also, much as I could craft some sort of add on<br/>\n&gt; (perhaps leverage my own sub-class from TestCase) I think it<br/>\n&gt; needs too much of what is in the framework in order to work<br/>\n&gt; well, and I don&#39;t fancy re-writing the thing.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think you&#39;d need to rewrite anything.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I use eclipse, I use ant -- I like the integration into those<br/>\n&gt; tools more than I like my idea. If I can&#39;t get you to<br/>\n&gt; contemplate the concept, then I probably have little chance<br/>\n&gt; of persuading them. If they don&#39;t use it, I won&#39;t benefit. Another<br/>\n&gt; reason not to start. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You wouldn&#39;t need to persuade anyone. Both Eclipse and Ant are open<br/>\nsource and have a quite mature plugin concept.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; This was my first topic on this mailing list, and much as you<br/>\n&gt; were pretty measured/polite (at least at the start) I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; think I&#39;ll be back for more. Open Source is (IMHO) about open<br/>\n&gt; minded discussion of ideas, and I don&#39;t think I found that<br/>\n&gt; here. No worries, have fun w/ what you do.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It is also about contribution. I think we would all be pleased to see<br/>\nyou write your tool and happy to help you where we can. If it proves to<br/>\nbe valuable to many people, the best way to distribute it could be<br/>\nreconsidered.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo hard feelings,<br/>\n<br/>\nIlja</div>",
