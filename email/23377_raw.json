It would also not rub me =\r\nthe wrong way if it\n&gt; was not he case that code that is written in a TDD ma=\r\nnner turns out to be\n&gt; testable pretty much by definition.\n&gt;\n&gt; agreed\n\n\n&gt; P=\r\nerhaps when I feel that I do something &quot;just for testing&quot; it is a good\n&gt; id=\r\nea\n&gt; for me to reflect upon if there is some way that I can achieve the\n&gt; t=\r\nestability with other benefits as well. Perhaps now is not a good time to\n&gt;=\r\n reflect so I write a note to myself to get back to the problem and reflect=\r\n\n&gt; later.\n&gt;\n&gt; agreed.. //FIXME is an IDE-supported &#39;comment tag&#39;\n\n\n&gt; The wh=\r\nole testing private methods discussion would never rub me the wrong\n&gt; way e=\r\nither if I didn&#39;t feel that we chose to resort to technical voodoo in\n&gt; ord=\r\ner to avoid changing how we generally approach problems and IMO are more\n&gt; =\r\nor less guaranteed to miss out on an oportunity to learn.\n&gt;\n&gt; The &quot;its not =\r\nagile&quot; argument always rubs me the wrong way because it&#39;s\n&gt; pointless. Fran=\r\nkly I don&#39;t care about being agile unless it works better\n&gt; than something =\r\nelse I would be doing.\n&gt;\nneither do i\n\n&gt;\n&gt; I do the things I do because I k=\r\nnow no better way of doing them right now.\n&gt; If I could do less testing I w=\r\nould, since having lots of tests is also\n&gt; quite\n&gt; pointless in itself. It =\r\nis the effects of having them that I am after. Or\n&gt; seemingly it is the eff=\r\nect of writing them that I am after. I write lots of\n&gt; tests because I know=\r\n no better way of ensuring that my code has quality and\n&gt;\nsame here..and be=\r\ncause i look for the highest value from my tests/coding I\ntry to integratio=\r\nn/higher-level/emperical test as much as possible. However\nthere I sometime=\r\ns need access to private methods to get the testing\nenvironment/parameters =\r\ni need.\n\n\n&gt; of driving me to reflect daily about design that helps me impro=\r\nve as a\n&gt; programmer.\n&gt;\n&gt; If the point was lots of coverage and exercise ev=\r\nery single method as a\n&gt; unit\n&gt; I would probably make all methods public...=\r\n but it&#39;s not...\n&gt;\n&gt; By the way, I have come to find that the private keywo=\r\nrd is pretty\n&gt; overrated\n&gt; :)\n&gt;\n&gt; Sorry for the rant... I just need to do t=\r\nhat at least once every year :)\n&gt; Anyone is free to disagree and it may ver=\r\ny well be because they are smarter\n&gt; or better programmers than I am. If th=\r\nere is anything worth reflecting on\n&gt; in\n&gt; what I wrote then it would be &quot;d=\r\non&#39;t follow the rules, go after the\n&gt; effects&quot;\n&gt;\n+1.\nI&#39;d summarize my point=\r\n with: &quot;lazyness is a virtue&quot; [1] &quot;except for the\ncompiler&quot;, but I&#39;d also b=\r\ne wrong!\n\n[1] http://projectlombok.org/features/index.html\n\n\n&gt; /J\n&gt; -------=\r\n----------------------------------------------\n&gt; Joakim Ohlrogge\n&gt; Twitter:=\r\n @johlrogge\n&gt; Blog: johlrogge.wordpress.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of thi=\r\ns message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n\n-- \nRegards,\nK.
