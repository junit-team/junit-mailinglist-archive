So I think that when considering a new version, we could\n&gt; certainly consider strongly following the design examples of other\n&gt; frameworks, like Jumi or others, but in the end, a JUnit 5 would be built\n&gt; piece by piece by submissions to this community.\n&gt;\n\nJUnit for me is still the de facto standard for unit testing in Java.\nIt&#39;s integrated in all the major IDEs from the start.\nIt&#39;s known by pretty much every Java Developer.\nEven if they don&#39;t use it or don&#39;t use it well, it&#39;s still the first unit\ntesting framework that comes to mind.\n\nThis has probably to do with the trust in the people who guide and develop\nJUnit. But I really don&#39;t know\nMoving towards JUnit 5 I think it will be hard to to loose this status, I\nthink.\n\nWhen it makes sense to use an existing library (and licences allow), I see\nno principal problem in reusing something like Jumi for JUnit 5.\nI have no idea, whether that makes sense at all, since I didn&#39;t look into\nJumi.\nI just don&#39;t think that JUnit 5 should necessarily be &quot;built piece by piece\nby submissions to this community&quot;.\nUsing Hamcrest inside JUnit 4 was a great move and it is an external\nlibrary.\n\n\n&gt; I think also that the compatibility between JUnit 3 and JUnit 4 was\n&gt; instrumental in making it useful for teams, and I&#39;d like to see a similar\n&gt; focus on backward compatibility moving forward.\n&gt;\n\nI also think, that backwards compatibility for executing JUnit 4 Tests at\nleast is a must.\nIf I can&#39;t gracefully migrate towards JUnit 5 I would have a problem and\nmany other as well.\nI&#39;m not sure whether we still need JUnit 3 support, though.\nJUnit 4 is old enough, that I think we could kill JUnit 3 if that makes\nthings easier.\n\n\n&gt; One last thought: one of the biggest confusions about JUnit 4 was the fact\n&gt; that it was both a version number referring to a new release of a software\n&gt; package, _and_ the only useful name for the collection of new libraries\n&gt; included in that release.  Starting in JUnit 5, I think a different naming\n&gt; scheme would be quite helpful.  Choosing a scheme that I&#39;m positive we\n&gt; _won&#39;t_ use, for example:\n&gt;\n&gt; - The runner and interfaces introduced in JUnit &lt;= 3 would be JUnit Cupcake\n&gt; - The runner and interfaces introduced in JUnit 4 would be JUnit Donut\n&gt; - The runner and interfaces introduced in JUnit 5 would be JUnit Eclair\n&gt;\n\nI think JUnit 4 was a great naming.\nI made clear, that the new software release also brough the new libraries.\nI don&#39;t see that as a problem.\n\nAnd doing the same with JUnit 5 would be consistent with that.\nSo when JUnit 5 changes the interface for tests and also brings a new\nrelease (of course) I would still call it JUnit 5 and everyone should know\nwhat&#39;s meant.\nI think it would be much more confusing If you started to introduce two\nnames. One for the software release version and one for the interface.\nThen I would have to say something like: I use JUnit 5 but I&#39;m writing\nJUnit Donut style tests? And who can remember those strange names anyways?\nDo you remember the last two names of Eclipse and can sort them? Or any\nother product that uses naming for that matter?\nI can&#39;t.\nBut I can easily remember JUnit 3, 4 and 5. And I have no problem in\nstating that I use JUnit 5 with JUnit 4 style tests.\n\nOn the other hand I strongly believe that, whatever you do, it will work\nout ok for two reasons:\n1) JUnit is just too established and too well known.\n2) I trust in Kent and you, to stear JUnit in a good direction and to\nlisten to the community.\n\nGreetings,\n   Malte\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
