Obviously the algorithm may be changed. For\n&gt; &gt; instance, I can call drawLine before drawRect, in which case\n&gt; &gt; the rect is drawn on top of the line if they overlap, or I\n&gt; &gt; can call them in the reverse order in which case the line is\n&gt; &gt; drawn on top. But from the perspective of a Graphics object\n&gt; &gt; neither order is wrong.\n&gt;\n&gt; How about a real-world example?  :-)\n&gt;\n&gt; Such as opening a database connection and then making a query?  \n\nThe querayable object takes the connection as argument in the\nconstructor, surely.\n\n&gt; Or ordering\n&gt; methods and then calling them in that order? \n\n&quot;The code still does something reasonable from the standpoint\nof the object&quot; (Elliotte Harold, above).\n\n&gt; Or creating widgets, adding\n&gt; listeners and then starting the main Swing thread?\n\nNothing stops you from starting the thread before creating widgets,\ndoes it?\n\n&gt; It&#39;s good advice, it&#39;s just impossibly hard to achieve in reality.\n&gt; Otherwise, we would never need setters.\n\nDoesn&#39;t follow. You are confusing the &quot;ordering doesn&#39;t matter&quot;\nproperty of various methods on an object - ie, that each ordering\nmakes sense from that object&#39;s viewpoint, no order is more &quot;right&quot;\nthan another - with the &quot;ordering matters&quot; viewpoint of the *user*\nof that object desiring a *specific effect*.\n\n-- \nChris &quot;electric hedgehog&quot; Dollin\n&quot;The compiler is free to insert padding because it makes the struct \nlook bigger and scares away predators.&quot; [Keith Thompson, comp.lang.c]\n\n\n",
