The test methods are bound to the\n&gt; setup methods ie. they expected the setup to have generated some values\n&gt; which the test methods use for asserts.\n&gt; Now I want to change one particular setup method to set up the values\n&gt; differently so that I can test a different functionality, here I am\n&gt; trying to check if a proper exception is raised. The approach I trie was\n&gt; I made a sub-class of the BaseTest say ExtendedTest and here I overrided\n&gt; one of the setup functions and wrote a single test method which will\n&gt; assert for exception based on the new setup that was done in the\n&gt; ExtendtedTest.\n&gt; But when I tried to run the test I found that Junit execute all the\n&gt; tests that belonmg to the superClass testCase too and here it uses the\n&gt; overrdden setup methods and thus in my case all my super class tests\n&gt; fail.\n&gt; Is this the expected behavior ? Am I trying the right thing for my\n&gt; problem, is there a cleaner way for my kind of a requirement ?\n\nYes, this is the expected behavior. If all Bs are As, then you probably \nwant Bs to behave like As; therefore, you create BTest extends ATest, \nand when you execute BTest, you test whether Bs behave like As by \ninheriting the tests from ATest. Makes sense, I think.\n\nIf you have two test case classes that want to share a test fixture \n(setup), then extract the setup into an abstract subclass of TestCase \n(called, say, TestFixture) and have the two test case classes extend \nTestFixture rather than TestCase.\n\nAlso remember: if your TestCase adds /more/ test fixture, be sure to \ninvoke super.setUp()!\n-- \nJ.
