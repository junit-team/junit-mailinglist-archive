A lot of\neyebrowes go up when I say that.\n\n&quot;OK - His cheeze is off the cracker&quot;, type whispering.\n\nI do have a very specific idea in mind for this\nthough.\n\nIn summarized form it would be something like this:\n\nAutomatically generate datasets\ntesting all the corner cases and edge cases and let\nthe developer evaluate the method based on the\ninput parameters and corresponding results.\n\nIn example form it&#39;s something like this:\n\nSuppose I have a function\n\npublic int add(int x, int y)....\n\nWhat would we test?\n\nSuppose it&#39;s a AMD 64 platform, and the test\ngenerator is aware that the the biggest and smallest\nint&#39;s values for the int datatype are\n\ndIntMax and dIntMin.\n\nWe could test and see what happens when:\n\nx + y &gt; dIntMax\n\nx + y &lt; dIntMax (Valid parameters)\n\nx + y = dIntMax (Valid parameters)\n\nThe same for the negative.\n\nThis helps the developer validate the method, by\npassing the generated input parameters and evaluating\nthe result.\n\nEdge conditions would look at what happens at the\nedges of decisions.\n\nFor instance x &lt; 10\n\nwould be tested by\n\nx = 9\n\nx = 11\n\nwhen x is an int...\n\nAnd so on...\n\nNow in this example if the method body says \n\nx*y\n\nthe generated tests will be right, per the definition\nof the method body, but wrong with respect to what the\ndeveloper or designer intended the method to do.\n\nHowever the developer will be able to run the method\nthrough the automatically generated datasets and\nnotice that 3*3 != 6.\n\nThe tool would tell the developer that the 3*3 test\ncorresponds to valid values for the input parameters.\n\nSo a method body interpreter/branch enumerator must be\ndeveloped that can enumerate the method body, generate\nall the edge and corner case datasets, and then some\nnice tooling on top for running datasets and\ninterpreting results.\n\nLooking at the number of edge and corner cases per\nmethod is also a good indicator of whether the method\nneeds to be simplified.  \n\nI think something like this would be a nice complement\nto something like PMD, which Yoakim pointed out.\n\nWe keep the baby, and still flush the tub :-)\n\nCheers,\n- Ole\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- Kent Beck &lt;kentb@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; Dear Ole,\n&gt;  \n&gt; I understand your suggestion to be about efficiency.\n&gt; To the degree that\n&gt; there is redundancy between the code and the tests,\n&gt; it feels like a waste of\n&gt; time, and you&#39;d like to eliminate that waste. \n&gt;  \n&gt; One of the principles involved in testing is double\n&gt; checking--say something\n&gt; in two different ways and if they match, you have a\n&gt; good chance you are\n&gt; saying what you intend to say. The philosophical\n&gt; problem I have with\n&gt; generating code from tests, or test from code, or\n&gt; tests and code from some\n&gt; other notation, is that it ignores double checking.\n&gt; The baby of\n&gt; double-checking goes out with the bathwater of\n&gt; redundancy.\n&gt;  \n&gt; I like the JUnitFactory tests because they give me\n&gt; an independent\n&gt; perspective on my code. Manually inspecting\n&gt; generated tests gives me a\n&gt; measure of double checking. &quot;Really?!?\n&gt; factorial(100) == 0???&quot; \n&gt;  \n&gt; Programming language design seemed for many years to\n&gt; be the quest for a\n&gt; notation so clear that programmers couldn&#39;t make\n&gt; mistakes. The\n&gt; small-but-growing popularity of developer testing\n&gt; seems to me to be evidence\n&gt; that double checking is a more fruitful strategy for\n&gt; achieving reliable\n&gt; software.\n&gt;  \n&gt; All of that said, I agree with the desire for less\n&gt; redundant test notations.\n&gt; @Theory, for example, seems to promise more\n&gt; confidence/line of test code.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt;  \n&gt; Kent Beck\n&gt; Three Rivers Institute\n&gt; \n&gt;   _____  \n&gt; \n&gt; From: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of Ole\n&gt; Ersoy\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, February 08, 2007 9:45 PM\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: Re: [junit] Future of testing tools\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Hi Kent,\n&gt; \n&gt; We had a pretty good discussion around this \n&gt; on this thread:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.nabble.\n&gt;\n&lt;http://www.nabble.com/100---Method-Testing-and-Generating-Unit-Tests-tf2902\n&gt; 785.html&gt;\n&gt;\ncom/100---Method-Testing-and-Generating-Unit-Tests-tf2902785.html\n&gt; \n&gt; I think we could summarize it to having a design\n&gt; tool\n&gt; that helps design the architecture of the system,\n&gt; perhaps narrowed by concern area and architectural\n&gt; layer (Presentation, application, business,\n&gt; integration ,data) and then generates tests that\n&gt; enumerate all the corner and edge cases, helping the\n&gt; designer / developer validate the system.\n&gt; \n&gt; Personally I would like to see it combined with\n&gt; something like this:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.eclipse.\n&gt;\n&lt;http://www.eclipse.org/articles/Article-EMF-Codegen-with-OCL/article.html&gt;\n&gt;\norg/articles/Article-EMF-Codegen-with-OCL/article.html\n&gt; \n&gt; Something that generates both the application code\n&gt; and\n&gt; the corresponding test cases. Then makes it as\n&gt; simple\n&gt; as possible for the users / solution recipients to\n&gt; validate the system. \n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m going to summarize the thread in a little apache\n&gt; licensed eclipse documentation plugin just\n&gt; elaborating\n&gt; on the enumeration methodology, etc. discussed in\n&gt; the\n&gt; thread. I&#39;ll post back when it&#39;s done.\n&gt; \n&gt; BTW - Thanks a gazillion (To Eric as as well) for\n&gt; writing &quot;Contributing to Eclipse&quot; and JUnit. I think\n&gt; calling it &quot;Briliant work&quot; would be an\n&gt; understatement.\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; - Ole\n&gt; \n&gt; --- Kent Beck &lt;kentb@earthlink.\n&gt; &lt;mailto:kentb%40earthlink.net&gt; net&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; All,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; At the Agile Open Northwest conference I held an\n&gt; &gt; open space session on the\n&gt; &gt; future of testing tools. I expected to talk a\n&gt; little\n&gt; &gt; about Theories and\n&gt; &gt; assertThat, but we ended up having a wide-ranging\n&gt; &gt; discussion about a variety\n&gt; &gt; of topics. I mind-mapped the result and put in on\n&gt; &gt; the conference wiki: \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; http://www.agileope\n&gt;\n&lt;http://www.agileopennorthwest.com/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?FutureOfUnitTesting&gt;\n&gt; nnorthwest.com/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?FutureOfUnitTesting\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The most surprising result to me was the interest\n&gt; in\n&gt; &gt; language features for\n&gt; &gt; testing-what would a language look like that\n&gt; &gt; included double-checking as a\n&gt; &gt; first-class concept? I was also surprised at how\n&gt; &gt; much commonality there was\n&gt; &gt; between the unit and functional testing &quot;vendors&quot;,\n&gt; &gt; that reporting is a big\n&gt; &gt; issue for everyone.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; One thing missing from the discussion was much\n&gt; talk\n&gt; &gt; about the hopes and\n&gt; &gt; dreams of users, so I thought I would open up the\n&gt; &gt; question here. What is it\n&gt; &gt; you wish your testing tool would do for you that\n&gt; it\n&gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Cheers,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Kent Beck\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Three Rivers Institute\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been\n&gt; &gt; removed]\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;\n__________________________________________________________\n&gt; Now that&#39;s room service!
