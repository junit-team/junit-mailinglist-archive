I understood him to say that it \nwould have prevented him from being nudged to write *better* tests. \nHaving that easy solution would have prevented him from finding the \n*better* solution.\n\nMy experience matches his. I also initially had the desire to know about \nthe execution of single assertions. I&#39;ve come to the conclusion that \ngrowing out of that desire was better than satisfying it would have been.\n\nCheers, Ilja\n\n",
