In these cases\n&gt;it seems counter pro=\r\nductive to create unit tests for my own code when I\n&gt;have\n&gt;no idea whether =\r\nmy code will actually work when used with the 3rd party\n&gt;API.\n&gt;I could end =\r\nup wasting a lot time writing and testing code that is designed\n&gt;incorrectl=\r\ny.  In these cases, it seems more sensical to me to write\n&gt;integration test=\r\ns which involve both my code and the 3rd party API.  How do\n&gt;people more fa=\r\nmiliar with unit testing handle such situations?\n\nGoogle &quot;Learning Tests&quot;.\n=\r\n\nIn short, the idea is to formalize how you think the third-party API behav=\r\nes in tests, then using that information with confidence to write your own =\r\nobjects. It&#39;s not something that one strictly follows, necessarily, but the=\r\nre is one definite advantage to writing Learning Tests.\n\nWhen I worked at I=\r\nBM, my component used third-party software from HNC Software. I would typic=\r\nally test my code using my knowledge of how HNC&#39;s software works. Of course=\r\n, my knowledge was imperfect, and occasionally the whole would not work eve=\r\nn though the parts did. (Here I use &quot;work&quot; to mean &quot;behave as expected&quot;.) O=\r\nbviously some expectation of mine was incorrect, so I began writing Learnin=\r\ng Tests against HNC&#39;s product, which both verified my assumptions and codif=\r\nied them for the next poor sap who has to maintain my software. In the proc=\r\ness, I wrote a failing test, which I shipped to HNC and which they used to =\r\nfix the problem within two days. \n\nThe key here is that I gave them a faili=\r\nng test, rather than a vague description of the problem. That eliminated th=\r\ne cost figuring out just what I meant by &quot;Blah blah blah doesn&#39;t do fizzlef=\r\nazzle.&quot; They commented that having the failing test allowed them to fix the=\r\n problem in an hour and that the two-day turnaround was the result of their=\r\n laborious release process.\n\nSo Learning Tests gave me a few things:\n\n* An =\r\nunambiguous specification of the assumptions that underlie my code\n* A way =\r\nto verify my assumptions against the product I&#39;m using\n* An unambiguous way=\r\n to communicate problems to the company providing the software to me\n\nBased=\r\n on that, I considered the technique a winner.\n\n\nJ.
