The focus is the new features in version 4.<br/>\nNevertheless, I think I will want to have 1 - 3 beginning slides<br/>\nbriefly introducing the tool which consist of the following information:<br/>\n<br/>\n- General Introduction.<br/>\n- Historical, current and (possibly) future development.<br/>\n<br/>\nCould anyone point me some source for the second point? (how, when, on<br/>\nwhat circumstance the tool originated? How has it evolved so far?<br/>\nWhat&#39;s the current state? What&#39;s the big roadmap picture? Its plan for<br/>\nfuture development? Which future direction would it take? What are the<br/>\nmost critical features that will probably be added (or needed) in the<br/>\nnext release?...). Answers to such questions would be highly appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nDavid.</div>",
