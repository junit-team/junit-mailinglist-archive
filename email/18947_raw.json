Now it&#39;s on the helper,\nso I&#39;m good to go.\n\nAlso, since the method is not public, we might say\n&quot;We&#39;ll just say that this is simple enough, and not\ntest it&quot;, which if there&#39;s a large team of developers,\nunit testing is left up in the air.  Some developers\nmay put the simplex algorithm inside a single private\nmethod, and say &quot;Well, it&#39;s simple&quot;, no need to test\nthat.  Thus skipping the benefits of test driven\ndevelopment in simplifying the design into small\ntestable pieces.\n\n\nOthers said it might lead to increased coupling.  But\nthe only coupling in the Class + ClassHelper pattern\nis the coupling between ClassA and the ClassAHelper. \nIf ClassB uses ClassAHelper, then the pattern is\nbroken.\nThe proper way to do it, would be to move the ClassA\nmethod that class be wants into a Utility library.\n\nHence, it makes it really easy to see which methods\nshould be moved into general utility libraries for\nreuse, that can be contributed to commons-lang or\ncommons-io, or some other apache commons library later\non.\n\nIt also makes it easy to look for utility library\nmethods that could be substituted, when possible.\n\nLastly, everything can be tested, making it easier to\nincorporate automatic test generation later.\n\nSo it could be that the code is smeeeelllleee, but I\nstill dig it!!\n\nCheers,\n- Ole\n\n--- &quot;J.
