I don&#39;t yet have any evidence that Agitator<br/>\n&gt;      would help me with that. I am concerned that since Agitator helps<br/>\n&gt;      me /not/ write JUnit tests, it might also help me /not/ feel the<br/>\n&gt;      pain of those kinds of dependency problems.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think it is a reasonable concern but not something to fear in<br/>\npractice.
