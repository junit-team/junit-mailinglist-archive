DbC provides \nmechanism to write pre/post conditions in terms of special Javadoc \ncomments.\n\n  iContract is a tool which is used to verify code for Design by \nContract.\n\n  iContract takes Java code with special pre/post condition Javadoc \ncomments. It generates Java code having pre-processed code for \nspecified pre/post conditions. \n\n  Errors are will be thrown at runtime after preprocessed code is \nexecuted alongwith Java code.\n\n  My questions are :\n  How to test the pre-processor code generated by iContract ?\n  What will be the related concerns in testing ?\n\n  Waiting for response...\n\nRegards,\n--- Shivprasad Mangesh Bhide\n\n\n",
