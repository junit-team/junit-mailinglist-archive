All the test runner does is to take a look at the \nclass and use reflection to see if there is a &quot;public static Test \nsuite()&quot; method to invoke.  So you don&#39;t have to extend TestSuite.  This \nis a good thing because you might want to extend some other class.\n\nShane\n\ngavinlas wrote:\n\n&gt;Hello,\n&gt;\n&gt;I worked it out. You need to define a static method:\n&gt;public static TestSuite suite() {\n&gt;    return new MyTestSuite();\n&gt;}\n&gt;in the test case. It is not enough to just extend TestSuite, as many \n&gt;of the tools do not use the extended TestSuite but instantiate their \n&gt;own.\n&gt;\n&gt;Cheers\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n",
