It really depends on\nhow many people want or use it.\n\nI&#39;m just trying to reduce some of our maintainence pain. :)  Currently we\nhave to maintain changes to the Assert class, which sucks.  I remember some\ntalk about changing the framework to allow for more &quot;plugability&quot;.  This\nmight be a good case for that.\n\nAs an aside, we count asserts instead of tests becase it&#39;s a finer grained\nmetric.  Right now we only have 8 functional test methods, but 170\nassertions.  When we add to a functional test we don&#39;t create a new test\nmethod, we add some more assertions to an already existing test.  It would\nbe harder to see progress if we tracked test cases.\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: rainsber@...

That might be the reason it&#39;s not in the\nframework. I, for one, hope it does not become part of the framework.\nMoreover, I have grave concerns that once JUnit goes truly Open Source, it\nwill cease to be a lightweight, simple test framework.\n\nThoughts?\n\nJ.

I&#39;ve heard a few other people on the\nlist mention modifying JUnit to count asserts.  Is there a good reason that\nit isn&#39;t part of the framework?  Since a few of us have already done it,\nI&#39;m\nsure we could make the change pretty easily.\n\nMatt\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Jason Rogers [mailto:jason.rogers@...]\nSent: Monday, July 16, 2001 10:40 AM\nTo: &#39;junit@yahoogroups.com&#39;\nSubject: RE: [junit] How do I implement a test case for a thrown\nexception ?\n\n\nWe have modified JUnit to count asserts, because we find that to be\ninteresting data for metrics.  Therefore, since we are implying that\nsomething went wrong when it was supposed to, we do an assert to add to the\ncount.\n\n\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\njunit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n\n\nYour use of Yahoo!
