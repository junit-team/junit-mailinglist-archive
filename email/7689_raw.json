The first method would be called before the \n&gt; testing is started. The second method he wants to call after testing \n&gt; is finished.\n&gt; \n&gt; What he wants is to do in makeTestData() is to write test data into \n&gt; the database for testing purposes. So he thinks we don&#39;t need Mock \n&gt; objects.\n&gt; \n&gt; We are not experienced both. But I read a lot of Mock objects.\n&gt; \n&gt; He also objects that the JUnit testing would be done only with Mock \n&gt; objects.\n&gt; \n&gt; What do you think? Is it better to use Mock objects or to do it like \n&gt; my coworker wants?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
