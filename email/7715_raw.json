Is that best \n&gt; practice?\n\nIt&#39;s really up to you to decide.  I always have my tests in the same package and\nhappily survived this situation until now.\n\nIn fact I don&#39;t understand why someone would want to set hurdles by having a new\npackage for the tests.  Testing should not be a challenge (although it sometimes\nis) so keep your options open and place your tests in the same package.  If you\nnever need to test your protected methods, fine.  But if you suddendly have to,\nyou still have the option to easily do so.\n\nAnd even if your tests are in the same package, you don&#39;t have to test the\nprotected methods.\n\n&gt; 2. When doing this, some methods with default (package) visiblilty \n&gt; cannot be accessed. But when using the Reflection API, this methods \n&gt; can be accessed. Is it okay to use the reflection? Or is it bad \n&gt; style?\n\nSee: just because you (&#39;you&#39; is general, not &#39;you&#39; in particular) wanted to\nwrite the cleanest tests of all and have a different package for them, you&#39;re\nnow messing with the Reflection API for writing a simple test.\n\nThere&#39;s a lot of situations where you want to test protected methods (like when\nyou write abstract classes that are meant to be published as part of an API) so\nkeep your options open.\n\nI would say that the Reflection API should be only used when everything else has\nfailed.\n\n&gt; 3. What about testing private methods? It is normally not possible \n&gt; if the test is in an own class. But again I can use the reflection \n&gt; to acess private methods. Should I do that?\n\nsearch the archive.  You&#39;ll have plenty of threads about it.  I never had to\ndirectly test private methods, but if you have a large code base with no tests\nat all, it can be your only option.\n\nIf you want to test private methods, don&#39;t reinvent the wheel and use the\nPrivateAccessor class of the (you guessed it right!) JUnit-addons package. \n\n-Vladimir\n\n-- \nVladimir R. Bossicard\nwww.bossicard.com\n\n",
