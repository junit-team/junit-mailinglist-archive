For example, why would it\n&gt;&gt; &gt;react differently to =\r\nan IllegalArgExc than to any random\n&gt;&gt; &gt;RuntimeException?\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Good quest=\r\nion. I hope that I can provide a good answer. The reason\n&gt;&gt; why my code wou=\r\nld care about the type of exception raised by the\n&gt;&gt; code that I have calle=\r\nd is that there are some exceptions that are\n&gt;&gt; non-terminal and that when =\r\nreceived, my code will try to do\n&gt;&gt; something about it. Let&#39;s try an exampl=\r\ne:\n&gt;[...snip examples...]\n&gt;\n&gt;Yes, certainly.  I understand your example of =\r\nJDBC exceptions, for\n&gt;which the strategy of retrying a few times may be app=\r\nropriate.\n&gt;\n&gt;But what error-recovery strategy, if any, is appropriate for\n&gt;=\r\nIllegalArgExc but inappropriate for other RuntimeExcs? In other\n&gt;words:\n&gt;  =\r\n  try {\n&gt;            // Some code.\n&gt;    } catch (IllegalArgumentException e=\r\n) {\n&gt;            // What might be done here ...\n&gt;    } catch (RuntimeExcept=\r\nion e) {\n&gt;            // ... that wouldn&#39;t be equally sensible here?\n&gt;    }=\r\n\n&gt;\n\nThere is no error recovery strategy, but the reporting is going to be d=\r\nifferent.\n\nI think that, for me, it&#39;s partly a matter of &quot;rightness&quot; and th=\r\ne rest is reporting. The &quot;rightness&quot; is that it is the Right Thing To Do(tm=\r\n) to throw a IAE when receiving junk parameters. In your code fragment, the=\r\n different things that I might do would be to issue different errors to the=\r\n user or log file. An IAE means that the programmer goofed, while other err=\r\nors might be for less negligent reasons.\n\nFor example, if my code is readin=\r\ng a file from a CD and someone ejects the CD during the process then I expe=\r\nct an error to be thrown, but it&#39;s not the fault of the programmer, so let&#39;=\r\ns put up a nice friendly end-user message that explains how difficult it is=\r\n to read data from a CD that isn&#39;t in the drive anymore.\n\nAs I type this re=\r\nsponse, I realise that my whole programming perspective is driving my answe=\r\nr. That is, that I very deliberately write what I call &quot;2 a.m. code&quot;. This =\r\nis code that someone else can debug at 2 a.m. without talking to me. I writ=\r\ne VERY BORING and VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD code and I do it deliberately. I fin=\r\nd two advantages to this: the first is that other people can support the co=\r\nde more easily and the second is that boring, straightforward code breaks l=\r\ness often (my perception, no scientific proof).\n\nI gained this worldview fr=\r\nom trying to support other people&#39;s RPG code. There was one particular job =\r\nthat ran at 2 a.m. on Friday night/Saturday morning and by the time it fail=\r\ned and the operators paged me it would be 2:15 (almost exactly ... everytim=\r\ne). The code was awful and that was when I started trying to write code (an=\r\nd encourage others to also write their code that way) that any support prog=\r\nrammer could read and understand and patch if necessary at 2 a.m.\n\nI hope t=\r\nhis explains why I&#39;m being so rigid about this. If I pass a junk value as a=\r\n parameter then I want an IllegalArgumentException. Don&#39;t give me a NullPoi=\r\nnterException ... that tells me nothing at 2 a.m.!!! You can give me all th=\r\ne theory that you want about how an NPE is fine if it&#39;s documented in the J=\r\navaDoc or some Big Book Of Documentation, but once you&#39;ve supported some id=\r\niot&#39;s spagetti code at 2 a.m. (without the BBOD to hand), then theory doesn=\r\n&#39;t appeal like it used to.\n\nMore than two cents, but less than a dollar. :-=\r\n)\n\nSimon\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n\nSimon P.
