It makes sense that a\n&gt; lot of us\n&gt; would take an interest in the direction of junit development\n&gt; since we&#39;re all\n&gt; developers (and pretty good ones based on the high quality of the posts I\n&gt; see here). But certainly there are plenty of readers who are not as\n&gt; interested. Because of this, it is generally considered bad form to cross\n&gt; post. I would suggest that those of us that are interested in development\n&gt; should join the junit-devel list so this list can be the user list. Then\n&gt; people can opt-in to the conversations that are interesting to them.\n&gt; Anyways, I&#39;ll leave it to the moderators to define the scope of\n&gt; these lists.\n&gt;\n&gt; Chris\n&gt;\n&gt; P.S. On the topic at hand, I know that Vladimir Bossicard has\n&gt; implemented a\n&gt; scheme that will let you register services with the junit architecture for\n&gt; letting you extend it easily for custom reporting and what-not. I\n&gt; don&#39;t know\n&gt; the current status of that effort though so perhaps he can comment?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: David Stagner [mailto:dstagner@...]\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, November 27, 2001 11:11 AM\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: Re: [junit] Making JUnit more pluggable for add-ons\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Scott Stirling wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m glad he did.  But I guess this is the user list?  I thought\n&gt; it was the\n&gt; &gt; only JUnit list. Doh!\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ll second that i&#39;m glad he cross-posted it.  I don&#39;t read the dev\n&gt; list, and probably wouldn&#39;t (i don&#39;t have enough time to read the lists\n&gt; that are higher priority as is).  I may not be actively involved in\n&gt; development, but i&#39;m very pleased to see such a carefully thought out\n&gt; and well-written proposal on the regular list!  I think it&#39;s great to\n&gt; toss ideas for future development onto the general list, so long as they\n&gt; are nice and clear.  It&#39;s a good way to get feedback.\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt;\n&gt; David Stagner\n&gt;\n&gt; National Marrow Donor Program\n&gt; 3001 Broadway Street NE\n&gt; Broadway Ridge Suite 500\n&gt; Minneapolis, MN  55413\n&gt;\n&gt; Email: dstagner@...\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
