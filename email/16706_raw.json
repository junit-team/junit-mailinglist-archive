Below is a sample of 4 of the 160.\n\n\n\npublic class TestLabSuite\n{\n   public static void main( String[] args )\n   {\n      junit.textui.TestRunner.run( suite() );\n   }\n\n   public static TestSuite suite()\n   {\n      TestSuite result =3D new TestSuite();\n\n      // Labs\n      //result.addTest(LabAdvisorKeywordSearchTest.suite() );\n      result.addTest(LabAdvisorTopicSearchTest.suite() );\n\n      // Added by HCL\n      result.addTest(LabDatabaseSearchExtendedTest.suite() );\n      result.addTest(LabDatabaseSearchTest.suite() );\n      result.addTest(LabDatabaseSearchThirdTest.suite() );\n\n     return result;\n   }\n}\n\nThanks for any guidance you can provide\n\nJeff\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSPONSORED LINKS Basic programming language C programming language Computer programming languages \nThe c programming language C++ programming language Software programming language \n\n\n\nYAHOO!
