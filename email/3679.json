I&#39;m <br/>\ndoing XP in my new job. You know how they say that XP makes you anxious <br/>\nto work in the morning , then tired and satisfied at night? It has done <br/>\nthat for me so far. When I get home, I&#39;m tired -- I don&#39;t jump at the <br/>\ncomputer like I used to. As a result, I don&#39;t have as much energy to <br/>\nanswer questions as I used to. When someone writes a message that I <br/>\ninterpret as &quot;Where are you lazy bastards? Answer my question!&quot; I get <br/>\nangry most times. I get even more angry now. That is why I responded the <br/>\nway I did.<br/>\n<br/>\nSoon I expect I&#39;ll be back to normal and be able to think long and hard <br/>\nabout each of your questions. Until then, I hope that others are able to <br/>\npick up the slack.<br/>\n<br/>\nHmm... now imagine if the top five question-answerers on this list are <br/>\nall going through roughly the same thing....<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m just asking everyone to remember to have respect for the volunteers <br/>\nwho answer your questions on this list. I appreciate them all.<br/>\n<br/>\nJBR.<br/>\n<br/>\nLee Chalupa wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I take the time every day to read and think about the posts in this <br/>\n&gt; group in the hopes that I<br/>\n&gt; can learn and someday help others that have the same questions that I <br/>\n&gt; do.  I feel part of the cost of<br/>\n&gt; membership of any group is to listen and participate even if it is to <br/>\n&gt; only read other people&#39;s questions and thoughts.<br/>\n&gt; If you don&#39;t feel like helping me, that is your decision and I respect <br/>\n&gt; that.  What I would ask of you is to limit<br/>\n&gt; the frivolous chatter in this group that seems to fill my inbox <br/>\n&gt; including your pompous lectures that imply that you are<br/>\n&gt; some kind of royalty so that replies that have useful content can get <br/>\n&gt; their due attention.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; lee<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 12/27/01 12:54:47 PM, &quot;J.

No-one is entitled to answers. We do<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   not do your job for you.

I got one<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   reply.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; In the meantime, what else got a response?  Well, we seem to <br/>\n&gt; have time<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; to respond to trivial subjects and partake<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; in what is nothing short of mental masturbation and ignore <br/>\n&gt; substantive<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; questions that require some effort.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; I think I have read about 30 messages about getters and setters that<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; sounds more like a pissing contest.  And then there is the chatter<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; about one piece of spam.  How many worthless messages did this <br/>\n&gt; &quot;spam&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; generate?  Boy we nailed that one didn&#39;t we?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; If you need someone to chat with, get a dog.
