Thank =\r\nyou for the good work.\n&gt;\n&gt; I was wondering, what made you choose TestRule t=\r\no be an abstract class and not an interface? This is so much of a pain.\n\nIn=\r\n your position, I&#39;d also be frustrated.\n\n&gt; The class being empty, I don&#39;t g=\r\net it.\n\nThe idea was to guide people away from an improper usage of Rules.\n=\r\nFor example, calling Timeout.apply in the middle of a test method is\nso lik=\r\nely to be the wrong thing to do, that we wanted to make it\ndifficult.  If t=\r\nhere were some way for a rule to expose one interface\nto the framework, and=\r\n another to test writers, that would be ideal.\nThis seemed like the next-be=\r\nst solution.\n\n&gt; One of my custom Rules needs to extend a class already.\n\nCa=\r\nn you go into more details about this case, and how hard it would be\nto ada=\r\npt your code to use TestRule?\n\n&gt; If I leave it implementing the deprecated =\r\nMethodRule, everything is ok as long as I don&#39;t add another rule to the tes=\r\nt.\n&gt; If a rule based on TestRule is used, any rule based on MethodRule seem=\r\ns to be silently ignored.\n\nThis isn&#39;t what should be happening.  The orderi=\r\nng of multiple rules\nis undefined.  What this means is that if you have a R=\r\nule (whether\nTestRule or MethodRule) that sometimes or always blocks or int=\r\nerrupts\nthe call to base.evaluate(), then it may prevent other rules from\ns=\r\ntarting or completing.\n\nThere&#39;s been recent discussion on a way to be expli=\r\ncit about the\nordering of rule application.  If that would be helpful here,=\r\n let me\nknow.\n\nSo, I now have 1 user (kcooney) on record for preferring the=\r\n abstract\nsuperclass (because it prevents confusion and improper usage), an=\r\nd one\n(dgageot) on record preferring the interface (because it frees up the=\r\n\nsuperclass slot).  If anyone else has opinions, please chime in by\nthis ti=\r\nme Monday, so we can make a decision and lock it in.  Thanks,\n\n   David Saf=\r\nf\n\n&gt;\n&gt; David.\n&gt; @dgageot\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In junit@yahoogroups.com, David Saff &lt;da=\r\nvid@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Hello, everyone. =A0We&#39;re happy to announce the relea=\r\nse of JUnit 4.9b2.\n&gt;&gt; This release&#39;s theme is Test-class and suite level Ru=\r\nles.\n&gt;&gt; More information linked from\n&gt;&gt; http://saffgreenbar.blogspot.com/20=\r\n11/01/junit-49b2-beta-released.html,\n&gt;&gt; and release notes below.\n&gt;&gt; Share a=\r\nnd enjoy, and please try it out and give us feedback. =A0Thanks,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Your=\r\n friendly neighborhood JUnit maintainers\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; ## Summary of Changes in =\r\nversion 4.9 [unreleased!] ##\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Release theme: Test-class and suite leve=\r\nl Rules.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; ### ClassRule ###\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The `ClassRule` annotation extends t=\r\nhe idea of method-level Rules,\n&gt;&gt; adding static fields that can affect the =\r\noperation of a whole class. =A0Any\n&gt;&gt; subclass of `ParentRunner`, including=\r\n the standard `BlockJUnit4ClassRunner`\n&gt;&gt; and `Suite` classes, will support=\r\n `ClassRule`s.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; For example, here is a test suite that connects to a s=\r\nerver once before\n&gt;&gt; all the test classes run, and disconnects after they a=\r\nre finished:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0 @RunWith(Suite.class)\n&gt;&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0 @SuiteC=\r\nlasses({A.class, B.class, C.class})\n&gt;&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0 public class UsesExterna=\r\nlResource {\n&gt;&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 public static Server myServer=3D=\r\n new Server();\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 @Rule\n&gt;&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =\r\n=A0 =A0 =A0 public static ExternalResource resource=3D new ExternalResource=\r\n() {\n&gt;&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 @Override\n&gt;&gt; =A0 =A0 =\r\n=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 protected void before() throws Throwabl=\r\ne {\n&gt;&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 myServer=\r\n.connect();\n&gt;&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 };\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; =A0 =A0=\r\n =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 @Override\n&gt;&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =\r\n=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 protected void after() {\n&gt;&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0=\r\n =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 myServer.disconnect();\n&gt;&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =\r\n=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 };\n&gt;&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 };\n&gt;&gt; =A0 =A0=\r\n =A0 }\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; ### TestRule ###\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; In JUnit 4.9, fields that can be annota=\r\nted with either `@Rule` or `@ClassRule`\n&gt;&gt; should be of type `TestRule`. =\r\n=A0The old `MethodRule` type, which only made sense\n&gt;&gt; for method-level rul=\r\nes, will still work, but is deprecated.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Most built-in Rules have been=\r\n moved to the new type already, in a way that\n&gt;&gt; should be transparent to m=\r\nost users. =A0`TestWatchman` has been deprecated,\n&gt;&gt; and replaced by `TestW=\r\natcher`, which has the same functionality, but implements\n&gt;&gt; the new type.\n=\r\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; `TestRule` is an abstract base class, and its abstract `apply` method=\r\n is\n&gt;&gt; protected. =A0In order to apply `TestRule`s to a `Statement`, use th=\r\ne `RunRules`\n&gt;&gt; class in `org.junit.rules` (thanks to `@kcooney`)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; ###=\r\n LICENSE checked in ###\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The Common Public License that JUnit is relea=\r\nsed under is now included\n&gt;&gt; in the source repository.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; ### Bug fixes =\r\n###\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; - github#98: assumeTrue() does not work with expected exceptions\n=\r\n&gt;&gt; - github#74: Categories + Parameterized\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; =A0 In JUnit 4.8.2, the Ca=\r\ntegories runner would fail to run correctly\n&gt;&gt; =A0 if any contained test cl=\r\nass had a custom Runner with a structure\n&gt;&gt; =A0 significantly different fro=\r\nm the built-in Runner. =A0With this fix,\n&gt;&gt; =A0 such classes can be assigne=\r\nd one or more categories at the class level,\n&gt;&gt; =A0 and will be run correct=\r\nly. =A0Trying to assign categories to methods within\n&gt;&gt; =A0 such a class wi=\r\nll flag an error.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; - github#163: Bad comparison failure message when u=\r\nsing\n&gt;&gt; assertEquals(String, String)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; =A0 Thanks to `@kcooney`\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; #=\r\n## Minor changes ###\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; - Backed out unused folder &quot;experimental-use-of-=\r\nantunit&quot;, replaced by\n&gt;&gt; =A0 bash-based script at build_tests.sh\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; - Ma=\r\nde MultipleFailureException public, to assist extension writers.\n&gt;&gt; =A0 Tha=\r\nnks to `@kcooney`\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n",
