Once you&#39;ve gotten the object, you<br/>\n&gt; then run your series of unit tests on that object.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It sounds like you can use the Parameterized Test Case idea. In your <br/>\ncustom suite() method, perform the above to build a test for each record <br/>\nin your batch.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; YOu can check<br/>\n&gt; that data is still there, to verifying that the JSP page that<br/>\n&gt; accesses this object contains everything that it is supposed to.  The<br/>\n&gt; one thing to note is that the record is not a row, it&#39;s a BLOB which<br/>\n&gt; can be accessed through accessor objects to get the data.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think this is important. Somewhere you have a method that uses <br/>\nyour accessor objects to retrieve the information for a (logical) row. <br/>\nThat&#39;s all that matters.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;snip /&gt;<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; What I&#39;m seeing in your post, is that I may be a bit too<br/>\n&gt; ambitious/backwards. :)  Perhaps I need to send the batch into the<br/>\n&gt; test and then iterate through each record rather than iterate through<br/>\n&gt; each record and pass it into each test.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Either would work; however, I would prefer the latter, since in that <br/>\ncase, each record would execute as its own test -- and you want to <br/>\nexecute a test for each record.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I was asking about where I might place the code to open and close the<br/>\n&gt; DB connection so I don&#39;t lose the connection while I&#39;m trying to<br/>\n&gt; ulimately get to the record.  I don&#39;t want to open and close the<br/>\n&gt; connection for each record. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Wrap it in a singleton, then.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;snip /&gt;<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I don&#39;t know if this makes any more sence..but hopefully it helps to<br/>\n&gt; clarify.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I believe that I understood enough to give you better advice. I hope it <br/>\nhelps.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
