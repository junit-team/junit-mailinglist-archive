Sun sugests \nto run \n&gt; the Java application without the &quot;assert&quot; option to increase \nspeed.  So \n&gt; you cannot be sure that your application will _always_ run in the \n&gt; &#39;assert&#39; mode.  Using the _optional_ &#39;assert&#39; mode to validate \nsomething \n&gt; that is _not_ optional (parameter&#39;s value) is IMO a big mistake.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; the exception:\n&gt; &gt; - is more explicit (IllegalArgument tells me the exact problem)\n&gt; &gt; - better communicated in docs (javadoc picks it up, hopefully \nthis \n&gt; &gt; will change for assertions one day)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; if (n &lt; 0)\n&gt;     throw new IllegalArgumentException(&quot;blah&quot;);\n&gt; \n&gt; if (n &lt; 0) the exception will _always_ be thrown\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; But at the end of the day they the look the same to me - just \n&gt; &gt; different in implementation.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; absolutely not, because at the end of the day you can run your \nprogram \n&gt; without evaluating the assert keyword and you don&#39;t control \nanything \n&gt; anymore.  This is a _big_ difference.\n&gt; \n&gt; My point is that an _optional_ assertion mechanism (&quot;assert&quot; \nkeyword) \n&gt; cannot replace a _non-optional_ error-reporting mechanism \n(exceptions). \n&gt;   They may be complementary (still not convinced by &#39;assert&#39;).\n&gt; \n&gt; Or am I missing the point?\n&gt; \n&gt; -Vladimir\n&gt; \n\nGreat points Vlad.  I agree that the big difference is that one can \nbe turned off while the other one can not.\n\nIt seems to me assertions are best used as an internal mechanism for \nenforing a contract within a class.  A helpful tool for developers \nwhen they are developing.  \n\nThe exception on the other hand is there to stand the test of time \nand always be on.  Good for bullet proofing the code.\n\nI believe assertions should be used more sparingly then exceptions \n(like IllegalArgumentException).\n\nThx to everyone who contributed on this thread.  I can put my mind \nslightly more at ease now with the feedback you have given.\n\nCheers\n\nJonathan\n\n\n",
