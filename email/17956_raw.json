(L=\r\nance, appreciate your point.)  @Ignore is an \neffective and appropriate use=\r\n of declarative programming.  One could \nalso use a properties file (descri=\r\nptor document) as an alternative \ndeclarative technique.\n\n[In fact, TestUti=\r\nl went down this path by excluding classes and \nmethods using a descriptor =\r\ndocument until Mark Levison suggested \nusing a JavaDoc tag (@excludeClass e=\r\ntc.) instead.]\n\nSo if annotations are an effective style of declarative pro=\r\ngramming, \nwhat&#39;s the problem?\n\n1)  There are contexts where both an OOP so=\r\nlution and a declarative \nsolution is effective.  I happen to prefer an OOP=\r\n solution as a \nfirst choice.  (&quot;test&quot; vs &quot;@Test&quot;)  I&#39;m perfectly willing t=\r\no accept \nthat others prefer a declarative solution (over an OOP solution) =\r\nas \na matter of style.\n\n2)  What I&#39;m not prepared to accept, is an assertio=\r\nn that \ndeclarative programming is &quot;better&quot; (when there are two workable \nc=\r\nhoices) by virtue of its existence.  In the case of @Ignore - no \nquestion =\r\nabout it (in my mind) - that is a problem begging for a \ndeclarative soluti=\r\non.  In the case of &quot;test&quot; - there are real-world \ntradeoffs between going =\r\ndown a declarative path vs. an OOP path.\n\n\nIn other words:\n\nThe basis for p=\r\nromoting declarative annotations when an OOP solution \nexists can not be --=\r\n-&gt; annotations don&#39;t require (or, take advantage \nof) inheritance so they a=\r\nre automatically better in all contexts!\n\nShouldn&#39;t a balanced declarative =\r\nvs. OOP discussion include what one \ngives up by abandoning inheritance in =\r\nthree contexts:\n\n- Team context\n- Corporate context\n- Platform context\n\nAnd=\r\n two dimensions:\n\n- In-container testing\n- Outside-the-container testing\n\n\n=\r\n_Marvin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
