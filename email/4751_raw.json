Make your tests fully\n&gt; automatic without any user interference or you will soon grow tired \nof\n&gt; running them.\n\nYou can make unit tests of console programs fully automatic by \nredirecting System.out and System.in (and, if necessary, System.err)\nto other streams that are set up and used by the unit test.  \nOne consequence of doing this is that you may need to run the \nprogram in a separate thread from the test thread ... which is \nirritating, but not an insurmountable problem.\n\nEric Herman and I wrote a (very simple) ConsoleTester utility \nclass to facilitate this sort of testing.  If anyone&#39;s interested,\nI could upload the code to the files section of this group...?\n\nCheers,\n\nBrett Neumeier\n\n\n",
