What are we trying to do when we do &quot;unit&quot; testing?\nA. We are testing all of the interfaces exposed by a &quot;unit&quot; to external\ncomponents to ensure that those interfaces react as we would expect them to\nin all reasonable scenarios that we can think of.\n\nSo to answer the question about private/protected methods: Does a private\nmethod expose itself to external components? No - therefore we do not need\nto test them. Errors within private methods will become apparent from\ntesting the other interfaces.\n\nDo we need to test protected methods? Yes - protected methods are accessible\nexternal to the unit and therefore form part of that unit&#39;s interface. If\nyou are going to call protected methods there are four ways that you could\ndo it that I can think of:\na)Subclass the class you are testing\nb)Use reflection\nc)Don&#39;t use protected methods, always use public\nd)Place the test code in the same package\n\nOption &quot;a&quot; is a bit icky, and will only work in certain situations anyway\n(how do you test a &quot;final&quot; class? Java only has single inheritance so how do\nyou extend TestCase as well...etc). Option &quot;b&quot; will work but is also icky -\nand a sledgehammer to crack a nut. Option &quot;c&quot; will work but I would always\nbe loathe to do it. My instinct is always to place as much restriction as\npossible on a method (the more I expose the more I have to maintain and the\nhigher coupling I could potentially have). Option &quot;d&quot; will work and is the\nsimplest to do.\n\nI recommend option d. As has been previously suggested I always place my\ntest code in the same package but a separate directory to maintain\nseparation of the two things.\n\nMatt\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Jens Andersen\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSent: 23/05/01 09:44\nSubject: [junit] How to test protected and private methods/ fields?\n\nHi all,\n\nFirst of all I have to mention that I&#39;m pretty novice when it comes to\nuse\nJUnit for writing unittests. But I have a question which I hope some of\nyou\ncan help me with - it&#39;s regarding testing private/protected methods and\nhow\nto organize my test package.\n\nFirst the package. I have read to articles regarding test (&quot;Junit best\npractices&quot; from JavaWorld and &quot;Incremental development with Ant and\nJUnit&quot;\nfrom developerWorks). In the JBT article Andy Schneider advice you to\nkeep\ntests in the same location as the source code. And in the Incremental...\narticle Malcolm Davis advice you to make a separate package. Which\napproach\nis the best to use?\n\nI must admit that I like the idea of making a separate package but then\nagain - how do I then test private and protected methods? And if I keep\nthe\ntests in the same location as the source code - who do I then test\nprivate\nmethods?\n\nI would very much appreciate if some of you could give me a little\nexample\n\nKind regards,\n\nJ.
