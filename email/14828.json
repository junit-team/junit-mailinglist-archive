This semester I&#39;m in Data Structures and our<br/>\n&gt; first project is to write implementations of a List. Our classes<br/>\n&gt; implement a ListADT interface, but we have to write three different<br/>\n&gt; implementations, one using Fixed Arrays, on that can &quot;Dynamically&quot;<br/>\n&gt; resize arrays, and a Link List. We also have to write a tests to<br/>\n&gt; ensure our list implementations are good. Having heard of JUnit I<br/>\n&gt; thought this would be a good time to learn it. So far it has worked<br/>\n&gt; fine for testing a single implementation. I have several TestCase<br/>\n&gt; classes testing different aspects of the list, and have added them to<br/>\n&gt; a sutie so that they can be all be run at once. However, I want to be<br/>\n&gt; able to test all three implementations at once in on fell swoop, with<br/>\n&gt; out having to write three sets of test cases and three test suites.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Google &quot;Abstract Test Cases&quot;.
