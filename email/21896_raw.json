If there are two rul=\r\nes, does it run both? How does it determine order? If there can only be one=\r\n rule, then I could extend external resource except that its apply method i=\r\ns final. I could make a combination rule and get around the problem, it is =\r\njust starting to get a bit ugly.\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;yme0987654=\r\n321&quot; &lt;yme0987654321@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; That should be doable. I&#39;ll confirm. Pr=\r\nobably better than the @Before given that I need inheritance anyway.\n&gt; \n&gt; I=\r\nn the mean time, I had put an assumeThat on the @Before method, and that wo=\r\nrked fine (subclasses call super and redeclare the annotation, so all is we=\r\nll). However, for the @After method, the assumeThat method just makes the t=\r\nest fail. I guess it was somewhat surprising that the teardown is run even =\r\nif the setup fails an assumeThat assumption, but I can certainly understand=\r\n that. But why not tollerate an assumeThat in teardown? I agree it is somew=\r\nhat strange that you already ran the test and still want to assume it away,=\r\n but I would still think that assume should stop a test at all three levels=\r\n (@Before, the test and @After). What do you think?\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In junit@yahoo=\r\ngroups.com, David Saff &lt;david@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; That&#39;s right: Rules can affe=\r\nct the processing after @Before and before\n&gt; &gt; @After.  Could you replace y=\r\nour setup/teardown with an\n&gt; &gt; ExternalResource rule?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;    David Saf=\r\nf\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; On Thu, Aug 20, 2009 at 11:11 AM, yme0987654321&lt;yme0987654321@&gt; =\r\nwrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; OK, I figured out the problem. What happens is that I have a c=\r\nustom runner that suppresses the test (these are slow tests, so they are on=\r\nly run at check-in, not by the developer while developing).\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; How=\r\never, when I replace that with a Rule, the setup method is still run (looks=\r\n slow). So I guess the conclusion is that @Rule can&#39;t interrupt or override=\r\n the setup and teardown process, so if you need to do that you are back to =\r\na Runner? (Or making your own setups rule-aware I guess).\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- I=\r\nn junit@yahoogroups.com, David Saff &lt;david@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Yishai,\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; I just ran a test, and the Rules in the superclass were picked=\r\n up.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Can you post a small example? =A0Thanks,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; =A0 =A0D=\r\navid Saff\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; On Thu, Aug 20, 2009 at 10:21 AM, David Saff&lt;david@=\r\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Yishai,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Sounds like a bug. =A0Can you f=\r\nile it at github? =A0Sorry for the oversight,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; =A0 David S=\r\naff\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; On Wed, Aug 19, 2009 at 8:26 PM, yme0987654321&lt;yme098=\r\n7654321@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I&#39;m looking at the new Rule annotation in JUnit4=\r\n.
