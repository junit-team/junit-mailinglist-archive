I have tried searching in Google as well as <br/>\nprevious messages in this group, but I haven&#39;t really seen something <br/>\nthat I can understand at my stage [also, my dearching skills may not <br/>\nbe that good!]<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you can simply point me so some good posts in this group or some <br/>\nlinks on Google, I will take it from there.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome background: We use JDBC code within our Java applications and <br/>\nwe have separated as much database code as possible. There still <br/>\nremain some classes which need to have JDBC code for performance <br/>\nreasons. We connect to a database on a separate server and do not <br/>\nintend to use an in-memory database.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards<br/>\nSherlockSridhar</div>",
