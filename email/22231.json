(correctness)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>On another list, I identified the same variations of dependency but<br/>\nwith the variation that for case 1. We might run B anyway but could <br/>\nhighlight the error in A in some way. That approach doesn&#39;t require <br/>\nordering the tests in any particular way, which has some advantages.<br/>\nIt still promotes developer efficiency while not worrying about<br/>\nexecution efficiency.<br/>\n<br/>\nCharlie</div>",
