We should do that \nregularly, whether we practice TDD or not. I find that it&#39;s easier to do \nthat safely when there are more tests.\n\n&gt; I was not talking about integration testing. But indeed I am thinking\n&gt; about testing at a higher level within the unit itself.\n\nI think you define &quot;integration testing&quot; differently than I do. Can you \ngive an example of this &quot;high-level unit test&quot; that is not an \nintegration test?\n-- \nJ. B.
