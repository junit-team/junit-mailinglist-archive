Let&#39;s try something a bit better...<br/>\n<br/>\nFor any given problem, a number of designs can be found. A certain <br/>\npercentage of these will be easy to test. Another percentage will be <br/>\nhard to test. If you want to be able to use tests to verify your design, <br/>\nit is reasonable to alter your design to fall in the &quot;easy-to-test&quot; zone.<br/>\n<br/>\nDesigns built with testing in mind from day one will, almost by <br/>\ndefinition, be easy to test. This is not a surprising characteristic - <br/>\nafter all, they&#39;ve been shaped with &quot;ease-of-testing&quot; as a constraint. <br/>\nDesigns built without testing in mind will probably be hard to test, <br/>\nmaybe even &quot;de-testable&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhenver you make a design, you are balancing various constraints, <br/>\nforcees, and fears. The &quot;private method&quot; one is a classic: you don&#39;t <br/>\nwant to make the method public, because it may be abused. You don&#39;t want <br/>\nto extract a new class for the method to live on because it means <br/>\nyet-another-class to clutter up your application. You don&#39;t want to make <br/>\nit private, because it&#39;s hard to test.<br/>\n<br/>\nBalancing these forces is what leads to a good design, normally. Taking <br/>\neasy ways out (such as using reflection to access private methods) tends <br/>\nto result in imbalanced forces and designs that aren&#39;t as good, _in my <br/>\nexperience_.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn this particular situation, my normal technique is to extract to a <br/>\npackage-level class. What I tend to end up with is a few public classes <br/>\n(about what you&#39;d normally expect), with a lot more package-level <br/>\nclasses that JavaDoc doesn&#39;t show off. It seems to work for me. It also <br/>\nmeans I usually have lots of smallish classes, which seems to be a <br/>\ncommon trait to good OO projects.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobert.</div>",
