I am supposed to <br/>\nimplement junit tests on code that I have just written. However, what <br/>\nI have learned in school does not seem to apply here!  We learned <br/>\nthat if the method is an &quot;add&quot; method, give it two numbers, <br/>\nand &quot;assert&quot; that the corrent addition is performed, and so on. . .  <br/>\nwell, I have no clue what to assert!<br/>\n<br/>\nQuick rundown of what I am testing:<br/>\n<br/>\nBasically, my code is using the Reflection class to check all the <br/>\nmembers of a class for a certain type of compatibility.  Most methods <br/>\nadd errors to an error vector, and then there is a simple print <br/>\nfunction to print out the vector... How on earth do I test this <br/>\nclass??  <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for any help in advance!!<br/>\n<br/>\nYours truly,<br/>\nThe Shark</div>",
