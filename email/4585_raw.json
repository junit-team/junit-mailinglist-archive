However \nthere may be valid exceptions where functional decomposition is \nappropriate within one class, and therefore private, but is complex \nenough to be tested.\n\nMy interpretation of JUnit&#39;s design is that it is agnostic towards \ntesting private methods because it is a function of the VM whether \nthey are accessible at all. Since modern VMs allow it, we can do it \nwhere appropriate. My current approach is to actively generate a \nproxy class that exposes private methods where necessary which I \ndiscuss in a different thread.\n\nRegards,\n\nDavid\n\n--- In junit@y..., &quot;J.
