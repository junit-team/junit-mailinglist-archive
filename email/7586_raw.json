Your experience\nmust have been really frustrating.\n\n&gt; Many Universities researched for testing methods. Many academics \n&gt; don&#39;t seem to like JUnit/TDD paradigma.\n\nDo you have some web pages/documents/research papers about that?  I\njust want to see their arguments.\n\n&gt; Everything must be questioned. Otherwise no progress is possible.\n\nWith facts.  Questioned with facts.  Not rumors or unfounded claims.\n\n-Vladimir\n\nPS: you&#39;re still not signing your emails...\n\n\n",
