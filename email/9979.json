If the test tells me what I was testing, <br/>\nthen I oughtn&#39;t to need to use assertion failure messages to tell me <br/>\nwhich assertion failed. I want to know which /test/ failed. Without a <br/>\ntest name, that is not easy.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  &gt; By making the test name different from the test method name, I can use<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; the test name to report specifically which line of data led to a<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; failing<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; test.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Understood.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I agree that this solution works well when you want to externalize the<br/>\n&gt; data for a data-driven solution.  I guess externalizing data is my last<br/>\n&gt; resort.  I start with individual test case methods with common code<br/>\n&gt; refactored into a custom assertion.  I start there partly because it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; easier for me to see the data and the assertion side by side in a test<br/>\n&gt; method.  And I name the test methods according to why the specific<br/>\n&gt; piece of data is important to test.  So if a test fails, I know by<br/>\n&gt; looking at the method name what went wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I am writing a webapp using Velocity to render DynaBeans. I want to <br/>\nverify that all my DynaBean properties are represented somewhere on the <br/>\nresulting web page without worrying about where the data comes from. I <br/>\nwrite a JUnit test to render the template with a hardcoded DynaBean. <br/>\nThere are 58 properties. I prefer not to write 58*2=116 test methods <br/>\nwhen I can write 2 (is it there? is the value right?) and generate the <br/>\n58 lines of data. (for each DynaProperty in myDynaBean...)<br/>\n<br/>\nNow maybe using JUnit to test a Velocity template is not the best <br/>\napproach, but I don&#39;t know a better one for testing a Velocity template <br/>\nin isolation. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Rarely do I find that I have enough permutations of data to justify<br/>\n&gt; externalizing the data.  But when that does happen, I externalize it. <br/>\n&gt; Even in that case I don&#39;t use a parameterized test case.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Do you then execute all permutations as one big test?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;ve seen the parameterized test case used.  I&#39;ve never had occasion to<br/>\n&gt; use it myself.  Perhaps it&#39;s my testing style.  I&#39;m using this as an<br/>\n&gt; opportunity to question why I don&#39;t use parameterized test case, not as<br/>\n&gt; an opportunity to caution you not to use it.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No problem. It could be a style thing. I seem to care much more about <br/>\nexecuting each test on its own than others on this list, so maybe that&#39;s <br/>\nthe difference.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
