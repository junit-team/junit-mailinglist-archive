That&#39;s pretty much counter to Design by Contact.  Do you have a \n&gt;&gt;copy of Meyer&#39;s Object Oriented Software Construction?  If you do, I can \n&gt;&gt;point you to some text that explains it easier than I can retype it here.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Yes, I do have a copy. I suspect you&#39;re referring to p. 343-344. However \n&gt;you have to remember that Meyer is writing about a language in which \n&gt;preconditions can be specified *and enforced* outside the body of the \n&gt;method. Since Java, unlike Eiffel, does not provide extra-method \n&gt;preconditions it is therefore necessary to place the verification code \n&gt;in the method body. It&#39;s not ideal, but Java is not an ideal language.\n&gt;\n&gt;Furthermore, for most cases, Meyer recommends precondition verification \n&gt;by default. See pp. 394-398\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nActually, I was going to point you to p.389 where he points out that the \nuse of assertions is primarily methodological and a documentation aid. \nJava doesn&#39;t support runtime monitoring natively, but to me that&#39;s okay, \nbecause it isn&#39;t the most important thing.\n\nBut back to your original point: &quot;It might sometimes be a \nNullPointerException or something else instead, but advertising a \nprecondition is not an excuse for misbehavior just because you receive \nbad data.&quot; Under DbC, it is.  Fact is, if your precondition fails or you \nget a NullPointerException, there&#39;s a bug in the client.  You can have \nchecking enabled, or not, but checking is not error handling.  The point \nof DbC is to build software robust enough so that you don&#39;t have to \nwrite error handling code at each level.  Relevant section is 11.6 \n&quot;Assertions are not an input checking mechanism.&quot;\n\nAnd when you say &quot;It is my job to make sure my code works. I can&#39;t do \nthat if the code that calls it violates my preconditions and class \ninvariants.&quot;  Most of the time, that&#39;s trying to do too much.  You&#39;ll \nlapse into defensive programming.  Again, you can easily have \npreconditions for interfaces, just write them as comments.\n\nNow, the thing that I have to admit is that I like DbC but I&#39;ve only \nused it a couple of times in the past.  And, I used it in systems which \nlapsed into a bit of defensive programming.  One was in a continuously \nrunning system that I designed that for medical instrumentation.  It was \nabout 15 years ago, and we found the documentation of preconditions \nuseful, and the checks, but there was always that issue of what to do \nwhen a precondition failed.  The system had to be designed so that it \ncouldn&#39;t go down, all we could do is log errors and patch values to keep \nit running.  We had many discussions about what failure meant and \nruntime recovery, and we concluded that although DbC is nice, it is \nreally orthogonal to those concerns.  Our recovery checking had some \noverlap with our preconditions but it was not complete.  DbC is about \ndocumentating expectations.  You write preconditions to tell people what \nyou expect, and if you do, you&#39;ve done most of the job that DbC was \ndesigned for.  The other thing we learned, is that if you are clever, \nyou can often design away preconditions and make calls less error prone.\n\nMichael Feathers\nwww.objectmentor.com\n\n",
