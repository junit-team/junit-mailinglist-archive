It appears that many\n&gt; &gt;people think there are &quot;magic formulas&quot; for working with JUnit.\n&gt; &gt;As a result, they ask silly questions like, &quot;How do I test an\n&gt; &gt;EJB with JUnit????&quot; The people who know the answer get so\n&gt; &gt;tired of writing, &quot;Search this list. Try it. What are you\n&gt; &gt;having trouble testing?&quot; that they simply stop responding.\n&gt; &gt;As a result, questions are not being answered.\n&gt;................\n&gt;\n&gt;I don&#39;t agree with these opinions. I think there has been\n&gt;very good questions and answers (discussions) here. Of course\n&gt;it is good if the answers can already be found in a FAQ\n&gt;but remember that the FAQ is something that is maintained\n&gt;usually by one person as on a list like this you can have several\n&gt;views. Take as an example the answers yesterday of why you should use\n&gt;JUnit. I am sure you can find data on this already somewhere else.\n\n\nA FAQ, though, may have provided a short answer to this question - and \nperhaps that would be sufficient for the poster. (And if not, he could \nalways ask a question ;)\n\nI&#39;m fully in favour of anything that cuts down on list volume - if this \nwere the only list to which I&#39;m subscribed, it wouldn&#39;t matter... but what \nwith this one, ant-users, tomcat-users, ...\n\n\n\n\n&gt;JUnit is a new thing for many people and this list must also be\n&gt;available to new users and not only to those who have already\n&gt;got an answer to all questions.\n\n\nYou&#39;re 100% right - but so many of the questions here are so basic that \nthey show that the person has done *no* research whatsoever - kind of like \nthe questions you get on usenet that are so obviously the questioner&#39;s \nhomework. New users&#39; questions are of course welcome - but as has been \npointed out, it&#39;s only polite to try and find the answer first.\n\n\n\nJim\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--\n\n                           *   Jim Cheesman   *\n             Trabajo: \njchees@... - (34)(91) 724 9200 x 2360\n           Cooperation can only be \nreached if we work together.\n\n\n\n",
