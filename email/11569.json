It usually takes a<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; noticeable time to run them all.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Can you quantify this? GSBase, for example, runs tests at<br/>\n&gt;&gt; approximately<br/>\n&gt;&gt; 100/second, and that&#39;s my usual performance goal for tests. On<br/>\n&gt;&gt; my most<br/>\n&gt;&gt; recent project, I separated tests that required expensive,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; external<br/>\n&gt;&gt; resources (there were about 10) from tests than ran entirely in<br/>\n&gt;&gt; memory<br/>\n&gt;&gt; (there were about 400). The in-memory tests ran in about 6<br/>\n&gt;&gt; seconds.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I will add that on my last project we had 2000+ /unit/ tests that ran <br/>\n&gt; in<br/>\n&gt; 20 - 30 seconds.  Our functional tests (over 30) at one point were<br/>\n&gt; running in 17 minutes.  With 1.5 days of refactoring the functional<br/>\n&gt; tests they ran in 3 - 5 minutes.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If you are keeping count that is 2030+ tests within 5 minutes, an<br/>\n&gt; average of 406 tests per minute (but let&#39;s not forget that the unit<br/>\n&gt; tests ran about 4000 - 6060 per minute).  Those are not shabby numbers,<br/>\n&gt; but they aren&#39;t the best either.  There was definite room for<br/>\n&gt; improvement, but we found that the ROI was not high enough to bring <br/>\n&gt; them<br/>\n&gt; down anymore.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s wonderful.  But it&#39;s impossible and likely incorrect to compare <br/>\nthose results to any other project in any way other than a purely <br/>\nstatistical analysis over many, many projects.  There are far too many <br/>\nother variables involved when running the tests.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome people *have* encountered a lower limit to test execution time, <br/>\nfor whatever reasons, and so it&#39;s reasonable to look for ways to <br/>\n(automatically or not) order the test execution based on recognized <br/>\ndependencies.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd while it&#39;s true as JB notes that you might not be able to have a <br/>\ntheoretically 100% accurate dependency tracking, a 95% accurate reading <br/>\nwould probably be better than running tests too infrequently because <br/>\nthey take too long, or spending a lot of time manually munging about <br/>\nreconfiguring test suites.</div>",
