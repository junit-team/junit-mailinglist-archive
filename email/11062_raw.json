You\n&gt; can even define a but of the production class, a bit of the test class\n&gt; with the tests for that method or whatever, a bit more of the production\n&gt; class, and so on.\n\nI don&#39;t like the built-in assumption that tests belong to production \ncode. A test is just another client of the production code, and clients \ndo not belong to providers. The implied dependency is in the wrong \ndirection and generally that way lie dragons.\n\n&gt;  &gt; Why do you want a production class also to be a test? I think it&#39;s\n&gt;  &gt; generally a very bad idea.\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t see what the problem with it is. It might cause a bit of code\n&gt; bloat, but that&#39;s often not a problem in many projects.\n\nI disagree with the notion that code bloat is not a common problem. \nRefactoring exists in part because of code bloat.\n\nAs for the first part, I admit my reaction is mostly irrational, but the \nnotion that tests are clients of the production code is so ingrained in \nmy thinking that I&#39;m not easily swayed to think otherwise. It is my turn \nto sit back and be the patient observer who isn&#39;t quick to adopt a new \nidea without sufficient proof that it&#39;s worth adopting. (I suppose that \nhappens to everyone some of the time.)\n\n&gt;  &gt; This brings up something I am struggling with: in C#/NUnit, we can\n&gt;  &gt; declare a test without extending TestCase (even if we frequently extend\n&gt;  &gt; Assert, anyway). Is there some great benefit to this over the way we do\n&gt;  &gt; it in JUnit, SUnit, RubyUnit, PyUnit, ...?\n&gt; \n&gt; You can do the same in Ruby&#39;s Test::Unit:\n&lt;snip-example /&gt;\n\n&gt; One can even keep the &quot;dynamic&quot; feel of this but still have static\n&gt; typing by having the compiler do type inference, as done in Haskell and\n&gt; ML.\n\nI know it&#39;s possible, but I don&#39;t know why it&#39;s valuable. Can someone \nwith experience doing both make a comparison? Weblog? Anything?\n-- \nJ. B.
