Let&#39;s handle this one really well in the FAQ, including all \n&gt;&gt;&gt;opinions, and point future instances of the question to the FAQ.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;This entry is weak in the draft FAQ right now:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;----\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Why does JUnit only report the first failure in a single test?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;A single test method may contain multiple assertions, but the test \n&gt;&gt;method fails as soon as any of its assertions fail.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;By design, JUnit assumes there&#39;s no reason to report multiple \n&gt;&gt;failures in a given test method. Once a test fails, it can only fail \n&gt;&gt;more and clutter the output with side-effect failures.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Reporting multiple failures in a single test is generally a sign that the \n&gt;test does too much, compared to what a unit test ought to do. Usually this \n&gt;means either that the test is really a functional/acceptance/customer test \n&gt;or, if it is a unit test, then it is too big a unit test.\n&gt;\n&gt;JUnit is designed to work best with a number of small tests. It executes each \n&gt;test within a separate instance of the test class. It reports failure on each \n&gt;test. Shared setup code is most natural when sharing between tests. This is a \n&gt;design decision that permeates JUnit, and when you decide to report multiple \n&gt;failures per test, you begin to fight against JUnit. This is not recommended.\n&gt;\n&gt;Long tests are a design smell and indicate the likelihood of a design \n&gt;problem. Kent Beck is fond of saying in this case that &quot;there is an \n&gt;opportunity to learn something about your design.&quot; We would like to see a \n&gt;pattern language develop around these problems, but it has not yet been \n&gt;written down.\n&gt;\n&gt;Finally, note that a single test with multiple assertions is isomorphic to a \n&gt;test case with multiple tests:\n&gt;\n&gt;One test method, three assertions:\n&gt;\n&gt;public class MyTestCase extends TestCase {\n&gt;    public void testSomething() {\n&gt;        // Set up for the test, manipulating local variables\n&gt;        assertTrue(condition1);\n&gt;        assertTrue(condition2);\n&gt;        assertTrue(condition3);\n&gt;    }\n&gt;}\n&gt;\n&gt;Three test methods, one assertion each:\n&gt;\n&gt;public class MyTestCase extends TestCase {\n&gt;    // Locale variables become instance variables\n&gt;\n&gt;    protected void setUp() {\n&gt;        // Set up for the test, manipulating instance variables\n&gt;    }\n&gt;    \n&gt;    public void testCondition1() {\n&gt;        assertTrue(condition1);\n&gt;    }\n&gt;\n&gt;    public void testCondition2() {\n&gt;        assertTrue(condition2);\n&gt;    }\n&gt;\n&gt;    public void testCondition3() {\n&gt;        assertTrue(condition3);\n&gt;    }\n&gt;}\n&gt;\n&gt;The resulting tests use JUnit&#39;s natural execution and reporting mechanism \n&gt;and, failure in one test does not affect the execution of the other tests. \n&gt;You generally want exactly one test to fail for any given bug, if you can \n&gt;manage it.\n&gt;\n&gt;--\n&gt;J.
