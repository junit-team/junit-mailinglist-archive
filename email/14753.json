I don&#39;t see how having an additional<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; org.something.util.CalendarParser class could make any library harder to<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; understand and use. Hell, that class could even be extracted to a <br/>\n&gt; different<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; binary, so that an outside developer wouldn&#39;t see it at all.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Have you really never tried to work your way through a mess of JavaDoc<br/>\n&gt; with no easy way to figure out what classes you needed and what you<br/>\n&gt; could ignore? Has it been that long since you learned a new API?<br/>\n&gt; Featuritis isn&#39;t just a problem for applications. It applies to<br/>\n&gt; libraries too. Smaller is better. Too large an API becomes a problem.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Start with a roadmap, rather than just Javadoc. What you describe is a <br/>\nlimitation of the Javadoc concept, rather than a limitation of any <br/>\nparticular API design. Javadoc describes classes and methods, but <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t necessarily help you know where to start.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo use JUnit as the example, there are a number of good tutorials. Many <br/>\nfreely available packages now use a familiar pattern on their sites:<br/>\n<br/>\n  * One minute tutorial<br/>\n  * Two minute tutorial<br/>\n  * Ten minute tutorial<br/>\n  * Javadoc/reference guide<br/>\n<br/>\nI think this is great. The next API I publish should include this.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Probably half of what&#39;s there could be<br/>\n&gt; non-public, and users would be the better off for it if it were. What<br/>\n&gt; benefit is served by making junit.samples or TestResult$1 public?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I wish the code to extract test methods were public and non-static! I&#39;ve <br/>\nwanted to reuse or override that a number of times. If, instead, it were <br/>\na pluggable TestNamingStrategy, I wouldn&#39;t have that problem, but that <br/>\nwould mean a collaborator behind an interface....<br/>\n<br/>\nFor every example you give, I can find another. That game&#39;s boring. :)<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
