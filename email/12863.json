All strings/characters in Java are unicode and <br/>\nthe encoding should be opaque to you.<br/>\n<br/>\nUTF-8 is an encoding for writing strings/characters out to a stream. All <br/>\nunicode characters can be written to UTF-8.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am sure there is a real requirement here, but I think we need a little <br/>\nmore information to understand what it is and to help you test for it.<br/>\n<br/>\nKevin<br/>\n<br/>\nRitesh wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hi Guys,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have a requirement where I need to be able to assert that any given <br/>\n&gt; String object (in Java ofcourse) is UTF8 or not. Meaning all the <br/>\n&gt; characters in the string are actually UTF-8 characters.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have some ideas, but I want to see if someone has a better idea or <br/>\n&gt; the solution is already out there.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Does anyone know how to do that?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks in advance<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
