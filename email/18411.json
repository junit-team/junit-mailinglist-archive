The &quot;catch&quot; is that I have to<br/>\n&gt; contribute testing-related examples - in other words: beautiful test<br/>\n&gt; code.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I already have some ideas of what to cover, but I thought some of the<br/>\n&gt; people in this group might have some examples of tests that they<br/>\n&gt; consider particularly &quot;beautiful&quot; or clever in their approach.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I think it&#39;s great that developer testing has reached the point that<br/>\n&gt; some authors/editors thought of including testing in such a book, and<br/>\n&gt; I want to make sure I pick the best possible example(s) to pick from.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Alberto<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
