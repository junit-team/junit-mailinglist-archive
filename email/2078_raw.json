Why would you\n&gt; want to do this?  One of the strengths of the\n&gt; framework (IMHO) is the\n&gt; guidance it gives me to fix every test\n&gt; incrementally.  I am unclear on why\n&gt; you would want the test to go on.  It seems to me\n&gt; that you would end up\n&gt; biting off more than you can chew.\n&gt; \n&gt;     &gt; Hi,\n&gt;     &gt; \n&gt;     &gt; When I run my test suite I found that each\n&gt; test stops \n&gt;     &gt; running after the\n&gt;     &gt; first failed assertion. I have a number of\n&gt; assertions in \n&gt;     &gt; each test and I\n&gt;     &gt; would like to know every assertion that is\n&gt; broken. I have tried to\n&gt;     &gt; create a default TestResult inside each test\n&gt; using,\n&gt;     &gt; \n&gt;     &gt; \tTestResult result = createResult();\n&gt;     &gt; \n&gt;     &gt; and then adding failures to &#39;result&#39; using,\n&gt;     &gt; \n&gt;     &gt; \tresult.addFailure(mytest, afe);\n&gt;     &gt; \n&gt;     &gt; which works fine, except that no\n&gt; AssertionFailedException \n&gt;     &gt; gets thrown\n&gt;     &gt; this way and my test passes even though I have\n&gt; broken assertions.\n&gt;     &gt; \n&gt;     &gt; Is there any way I can get JUnit to show all\n&gt; broken \n&gt;     &gt; assertions for each\n&gt;     &gt; test and not move onto the next test when the\n&gt; first \n&gt;     &gt; assertion fails?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nMake international calls for as low as $.04/minute with Yahoo!
