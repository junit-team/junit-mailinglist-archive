I like having suite() because it allows me to trim out<br/>\ntests I don&#39;t need to run without having to delete the sources for them.<br/>\nI have a number of tests which, unfortunately, require manual intervention<br/>\nto click buttons on swing dialogs, and I leave these commented out in<br/>\nthe suite() method most of the time so that nightly automated tests run<br/>\nunattended.<br/>\n<br/>\nSuite() methods also allow me to control the runtime order without<br/>\nplaying games like manually rearranging source code or changing method<br/>\nnames so that a reflection-based runtime can be coerced into running the<br/>\ntests in the order I want them run.  Typically I order my test methods so that<br/>\nbasics get tested first, followed by more complex/esoteric stuff which<br/>\nhas to assume the earlier stuff works.  This lets me assume that the<br/>\nfirst test which failed is the first one to look at, rather than a bunch<br/>\nof other tests which failed as a side effect of the first problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s nothing particularly wrong with your method.  It simply excludes<br/>\na level of control I happen to like using.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJoi Ellis                    Software Engineer<br/>\nAravox Technologies          <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:joi@...\">joi@...</a>, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:gyles19@...\">gyles19@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\nNo matter what we think of Linux versus FreeBSD, etc., the one thing I<br/>\nreally like about Linux is that it has Microsoft worried.  Anything<br/>\nthat kicks a monopoly in the pants has got to be good for something.<br/>\n           - Chris Johnson</div>",
