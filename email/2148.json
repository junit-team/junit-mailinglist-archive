My reason seems to be different<br/>\nfrom any of the others I&#39;ve seen.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t give a hoot about the total number of assertions for whatever<br/>\nmetrics purposes.  I do care about doing test-first coding appropriately.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat means: code some context, code an assert.<br/>\nMake sure the assert fails.  Fix the assert.<br/>\nAdd another assert to the same test method.<br/>\nRepeat until done with all things that assert against<br/>\nthe given context for the test method.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy problem is that my memory is poor, and I get<br/>\ndistracted.  I just coded an assert and compiled.<br/>\nOr did I really compile?<br/>\nDrat, I forgot.<br/>\nDid I just add a new assert to the body of tests or did I not?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe count of assertions would be something visual that would change so I<br/>\ncould get *feedback* and not have to trust myself.  It&#39;s part of the reason<br/>\nthere is a count of tests, anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat if instead of being a count, it was a simple visual symbol that showed,<br/>\nfor a given test class, that there is now a new assert that is being run for<br/>\nthe first time?<br/>\n(could be a royal pain to figure out... consider if asserts are changed<br/>\nor deleted)<br/>\n<br/>\nOr am I just slower than the majority of developers?<br/>\n<br/>\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!
