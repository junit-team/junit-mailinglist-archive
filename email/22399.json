Since you said you welcome our thoughts, let me<br/>\nshare/compare to how we do it..<br/>\n<br/>\nWe use Maven, and m2eclipse. Maven, by convention, locates<br/>\n&#39;production&#39; source code under &quot;src/main/java&quot; and test source code<br/>\nunder &quot;src/test/java&quot;. m2eclipse then sets up two separate source<br/>\npaths under the same Eclipse project.<br/>\n<br/>\n1) The ability to set your project-specific settings for your test<br/>\nproject to something other than what is set for the main project.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs you know, run-time configuration can be configured per test/suite<br/>\nunder Eclipse. Using Maven, you can specify some run-time<br/>\nconfiguration that&#39;ll only get applied when running (all) unit tests.<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure why you&#39;d need separate build configuration, except for<br/>\nyour point #4: libraries only needed for unit tests, which I&#39;ll get to<br/>\nbelow.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Reduced risk in having your main code accidentally depend on a test<br/>\n(not likely to happen, but possible with single project).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Maven to perform the final build, the &#39;compile&#39; phase executes<br/>\nbefore the &#39;compile tests&#39; phase; If any production code has hard<br/>\ndependencies on test code then the compile will fail.<br/>\n<br/>\nEclipse won&#39;t raise any errors at all, though; so we need to depend on<br/>\nthe Maven build to catch this situation.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n3) Reduced risk in accidentally shipping test-specific jars with your<br/>\nproduction code.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, like in #2 by using the Maven build we cleanly separate the<br/>\nproduction code from test code.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n4) The freedom to add any version of a lib that you need for your tests.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo a large extent, Maven lets you use a separate build classpath for<br/>\ntests and production code. You can certainly specify libraries with<br/>\nonly &quot;test scope&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can even use different test resources (e.g., configuration<br/>\n.properties or .XML files, test data/fixtures) which are all invisible<br/>\nto the production code.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, I&#39;m unsure of how it&#39;ll work if you use a different or newer<br/>\nversion of the same dependency in your test scope. The Maven-Eclipse<br/>\nproject certainly doesn&#39;t complain—but again, I suspect Maven will<br/>\n(properly) fail to compile if your test code which was written against<br/>\nthe old library is broken by the new test library.<br/>\n<br/>\nOverall, Maven+Eclipse is not 100% ideal compared to what you seem to<br/>\nwant to accomplish using separate projects. It does, however, let us<br/>\nseparate test code and production code with relative ease, without<br/>\nhaving to manage two separate projects.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe best part is how the whole compile, test, package, distribute and<br/>\ndeploy cycle can be configured/managed using a single tool, which can<br/>\neven be run in an automated fashion (within a continuous integration<br/>\nsystem).<br/>\n<br/>\nUsing Eclipse alone, with two separate projects, you&#39;d have to<br/>\nmanually run tests in the test project, before building the main<br/>\nproject (or write your own script to do so), and so on by hand.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps.<br/>\n<br/>\n- alistair<br/>\n--<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://alistairisrael.wordpress.com\">http://alistairisrael.wordpress.com</a> </span></blockquote></div>",
