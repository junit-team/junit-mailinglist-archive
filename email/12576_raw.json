Before development moves along much further, I\n&gt; would like to take the test harnesses for each object and remove the\n&gt; hardcoding from them.  Each test harness should still be able to be\n&gt; run individually as it&#39;s own test, but I&#39;m looking to the future as\n&gt; well, when we have the potential to do nightly builds and will want to\n&gt; run all of the test harnesses as a suite together.  This definitely\n&gt; cannot happen if any hardcoding exists, but there needs to be some\n&gt; external way to pass each object the information specific to it only\n&gt; to test.  I don&#39;t want to create a properties/configuration file for\n&gt; each object, as many of of the objects can re-use the same sdf file,\n&gt; logger, and other config files. \n&gt; \n&gt; Any suggestions?\n\nIt sounds like you have this situation: a bunch of tests are essentially \nthe same, except for the input data and expected output data (called \n&quot;fixture data&quot;). There are two different solutions, depending on your \nstyle of testing.\n\n1. Write one test that loops over all the data.\n\nIn xUnit pseudocode, you have this:\n\ntestTheBigAlgorithm\n     foreach (row in testFixtures)\n         doTest(row)\n\ndoTest(row)\n     // Put the real test in here, using data from row\n\nHere, &#39;testFixtures&#39; is a collection of objects, each containing your \ninput data and expected output data.\n\nPROS: Simple and effective.\nCON: If the test fails for row 5 of your fixture data, the remaining \ntests don&#39;t run\n\n2. The Parameterized Test Case pattern.\n\nWrite a custom suite() method that builds a suite of tests, each test \nwith a row of your fixture data. To do this, you need to add a \nconstructor to your subclass of TestCase that&#39;ll accept the fixture data \nas a parameter:\n\nclass MyTestCase extends TestCase {\n     private MyTestCaseFixture fixture;\n\n     public MyTestCase(MyTestCaseFixture fixture) {\n         this.fixture = fixture;\n     }\n\n     protected void runTest() {\n         // Put the real test in here, using data from &#39;fixture&#39;\n     }\n\n     public static Test suite() {\n         TestSuite suite = new TestSuite(&quot;My Tests&quot;);\n\n         foreach (row in testFixtures) {\n             suite.addTest(new MyTestCase(row));\n         }\n\n         return suite;\n     }\n}\n\nThe method suite() contains some pseudoJava, but I think you know what I \nmean.\n\nIn either case, you can always write code to retrieve the fixture data \nfrom an external source, like a file or a relational database.\n\nI hope this helps you out.
