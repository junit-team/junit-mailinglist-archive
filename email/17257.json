You should<br/>\n&gt;&gt; assume that each test method will be run with a fresh test method in JUnit.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; This has been part of the architecture from the beginning and I don&#39;t see<br/>\n&gt;&gt; any reason to change it. The principle behind this choice is that tests<br/>\n&gt;&gt; should be order-independent. Running with separate instances supports<br/>\n&gt;&gt; independence.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;     <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; That&#39;s fine. As I think about it, there&#39;s still another reason not to <br/>\n&gt; initialize objects in the constructor: test instance creation happens <br/>\n&gt; well before the test runs, so if too much initialization happens in the <br/>\n&gt; constructor, one might run out of memory before running any tests. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Just to further clarify, this is JUnit 3 behavior.  In JUnit 4.1, test <br/>\ninstance creation happens right before test execution, so this <br/>\nparticular reason to favor setUp is no longer the case.  As Kent has <br/>\nnoticed, this is not yet an API guarantee for 4.x, however.<br/>\n<br/>\nShare and enjoy,<br/>\n<br/>\n    David Saff</div>",
