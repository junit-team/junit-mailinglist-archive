As posted last time this discussion went around<br/>\nthe exact same circles:<br/>\n<br/>\npublic class Foo<br/>\n{<br/>\n\tprivate int d_i = 0;<br/>\n\tprivate int d_j = 0;<br/>\n<br/>\n\t// ... other stuff<br/>\n<br/>\n\tpublic void setI(int i) {d_i = i;}<br/>\n\tpublic int getI() {return i;}<br/>\n<br/>\n\tpublic void setJ(int j) {d_j = j;}<br/>\n\tpublic int getJ() {return d_i;}<br/>\n<br/>\n\t// .. More other stuff<br/>\n} // class Foo<br/>\n<br/>\nThis code is trivial. It is also wrong. Somebody probably created the<br/>\naccessors for i and then cut and paste them for j without editting<br/>\neverywhere they should. Without a testcase here, there will be a more<br/>\ncomplex failure somewhere else. Somebody will spend an hour or so pulling<br/>\ntheir hair out. A testcase for this is very quick to do. It also has the<br/>\nside effect of making sure things still work after someone changes one of<br/>\nthe accessors to return a computed value and forgets to add the test. The<br/>\npoint of regression is to catch problems that arise from someone who makes<br/>\na change forgetting to do everything they should.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost bugs are trivial mistakes. Most people pay attention when coding<br/>\ncomplex things and suspect the complex code when something goes wrong.<br/>\nWhen people write trivial or repetitive code, their attention drifts and<br/>\nthey make mistakes. The trivial code also happens to be the last place<br/>\nsomeone looks for the mistake, as evidenced by this discussion.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Fri, 21 Dec 2001, STRAYER, JON (AIT) wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Do you test that 1 + 1 = 2 just in case the compiler makes a mistake?

But that&#39;s not what was presented.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; To this I would respond that most bugs are introduced as unforeseen<br/>\n&gt; &gt; consequences of modification to existing code.  There may be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; interdependencies that we weren&#39;t aware of.
