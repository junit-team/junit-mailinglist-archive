That is, don&#39;t mix production\ncode and test code in the same directories. Just let your production\ncode package structure induce a test code directory structure. Now you\ncan use your IDE to launch tests at the approporate level by choosing\nthe appropriate directory.\n\nIf you find you need greater control than that, I&#39;ve found a utility\ncalled ClasspathSuite\n&lt;http://www.johanneslink.net/projects/cpsuite.html&gt;   handy for running\ndifferent sets of tests in Eclipse (especially if you want to run tests\nacross more than one Eclipse project). I can choose which tests to run\nbased on test class naming conventions.\n\nBelow is the body of the class that I use to run my project&#39;s unit tests\nbut not my project&#39;s integration tests:\n\n@RunWith(ClasspathSuite.class)\n@SuiteTypes({ JUNIT38_TEST_CLASSES, TEST_CLASSES })\n@ClassnameFilters({&quot;.*(Behaviou?r|Spec|Test)&quot;, &quot;!.*IntegrationTest&quot;})\n\npublic class AllUnitTests {}\n\nNext I make a launch target in Eclipse that runs AllUnitTests as a JUnit\nTest.\n\nAs you might guess from the ClassnameFilters above, a project history\nthat includes a mixture of folks from Canada and from the States\nexperimenting with BDD, requires me to use the regular expression\n`Behaviou?r` to match a few of the project&#39;s unit tests. Sigh.\n\nGood luck,\nAlistair\n\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;David Parks&quot; &lt;davidparks21@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi there, I&#39;m new at JUnit, and just want to start using it with a new\nproject.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m trying to figure out the best way to easily expand on a set of\ntest classes.\n&gt;\n&gt; It seems like I should configure a TestSuite of some sort. But I&#39;m not\nsure if I should use the DirectoryBuilder, or if I should manually\nmaintain a class that launches my tests, or use annotations.\n&gt;\n&gt; It looks like there is a way to simply annotate the classes I want to\nrun and then to be able to kick off various test suites. But the docs\ndon&#39;t have many examples of this. And it seems like there are many ways\nto do the same thing.\n&gt;\n&gt; The cookbook just mentions using\nJUnitCore.runClasses(TestClass1.class, ...), but that doesn&#39;t seem very\nextendable.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m just looking for a simple best practice. I&#39;d like to not have to\nupdate a main() method each time I want to add a new test class. I&#39;d\nlike to simply kick off one or another suite of test classes from my IDE\nin most cases and get a nicely printed result printed to the console.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks!\n&gt; David\n&gt;\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
