Then it was Perl<br/>\nvs C.  The result was that the same logic written in C ran thirty (30)<br/>\ntimes faster.<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t do any special optimizations.  I had written both sets of code.<br/>\nThe job was not compute bound.  It involved lookups in a smallish<br/>\ndatabase (about 3 MB of data on a machine with, as I recall, 128 MB of<br/>\nmemory).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe customer was convinced to switch to C, but someone else convinced<br/>\nhim to switch his database to Oracle.  The consequence for him was<br/>\neven larger consulting bills and no change in performance at all,<br/>\nOracle being another big interpreter.<br/>\n<br/>\nI haven&#39;t done any real testing, but my impression is that overall<br/>\nJava performs like Perl.  The development environment is wonderful,<br/>\nthe code is much easier to debug, the language itself is clear and<br/>\nalmost entirely free of the weirdnesses that characterize Perl.  But<br/>\nit&#39;s slow.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; All the interpreted languages I know use symbol tables. The references in<br/>\n&gt; the byte code are resolved to indexes or pointers at compile time,<br/>\n&gt; generally not run time. In Java, in which I am not expert, my understanding<br/>\n&gt; is that the code that actually executes has been run through the jitter and<br/>\n&gt; converted to actual machine code. I would expect all the symbol lookups, if<br/>\n&gt; there were any, and if they were slow, to be resolved by then if not<br/>\n&gt; before.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, but ...<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; Also, Java is widely used in applications whose performance is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; dominated by communications.  If names are embedded in those<br/>\n </span></blockquote>                                  **<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; communications, longer names mean slower communications means<br/>\n&gt; &gt; poorer performance.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yes, that&#39;s true. If names were the bulk of the messages going back and<br/>\n&gt; forth, then longer could be slower. If, as is not uncommonly the case,<br/>\n&gt; what&#39;s going back and forth is mostly data -- web pages, movies, sound,<br/>\n&gt; database records -- then the symbols in the queries and responses aren&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; likely to be a big fraction of the data transmitted. Clearly this is<br/>\n&gt; application dependent, and encoding dependent.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Indeed.  Any attempts at benchmarking will be difficult, because you<br/>\nhave to have a realistic mix of applications.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo be fair, remember that it&#39;s not just names that slow things down.<br/>\nLayers of abstraction also have a large effect on program size and<br/>\nprobably performance.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; This rule should not be true in compute-intensive applications --<br/>\n&gt; &gt; but the more compute-bound the problem, the less likely that Java<br/>\n&gt; &gt; is to be used.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yes, but this is more a function of its interpretive nature than the length<br/>\n&gt; of the names, I would expect. And somewhere I believe I saw a case where C#<br/>\n&gt; beat C++ on some benchmark. And I have seen Smalltalk beat C++ as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Pick your benchmark carefully, and anyone can win ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nI once had a customer who benchmarked a system we sold him and<br/>\ncomplained bitterly about the results.  I asked to see the test code.<br/>\nHe had put a print statement right in the middle of a for loop.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe was a nuclear physicist.  It took him a few seconds to grasp that<br/>\nI/O is hugely expensive compared to computation.  He went away, moved<br/>\nthe print statement, and was satisfied.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; In a month or two I might be able to come back with performance<br/>\n&gt; &gt; figures.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I guess you&#39;re very busy. Perhaps a smaller experiment would be possible.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The month or two is realistic, especially when followed by &quot;might&quot;.<br/>\nI will try to do something faster, but fear that a rushed, poorly<br/>\nthought out set of experiments will only confuse issues.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne approach would be scrunch say JBoss and measure scrunched vs<br/>\nunscrunched performance on a mix of applications.  But there is<br/>\nlikely to be a straight trade-off between &#39;quick and easy&#39; on the<br/>\none hand and &#39;convincing&#39; on the other.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJim Dixon  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jdd@...\">jdd@...</a>   tel +44 117 982 0786  mobile +44 797 373 7881</div>",
