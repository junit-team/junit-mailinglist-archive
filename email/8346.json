Actually let me qualify that. It is not a good book unless<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; you are heavily into EJB. It angles itself towards EJB using<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; several different tools; however in each case you just get started<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; and it jumps topics. So in that sense it is an intro book - just a<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; bit too much intro and not enough meat (using the word mastering <br/>\n&gt;is<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; just a cruel joke). <br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; A more correct title would have been &quot;EJB using XP and Open Source<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Tools&quot;. <br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; A very disappointing book.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; Just wanted to make clear that you seem to be talking about &quot;Java <br/>\n&gt;Tools<br/>\n&gt;&gt; for Extreme Programming&quot; here, not about the book in the subject?!<br/>\n&gt;&gt; I am looking for a book like &quot;introduction to unit testing&quot; any <br/>\n&gt;recommedations ? I have just read &quot;Extreme Programming Explained&quot; by <br/>\n&gt;Kent Beck which was an inspiring read and have used junit and jfunc a <br/>\n&gt;bit but need more guidance - if you know what I mean.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not sure who the original poster is, but here are some recommendations.<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Kent Beck, &quot;Test-Driven Development by Example&quot;<br/>\n2. Vincent Massol, Ted Husted, &quot;JUnit in Action&quot; coming soon<br/>\n3. &quot;JUnit Cookbook&quot; by some guys who frequent this mailing list, coming late 2003/early 2004<br/>\n<br/>\nBooks for JUnit are just now bursting onto the scene because, to this point, the collective wisdom of JUnit has been maintained on the web. There are at least 10 books worth of great information on the web, but if you want books, you&#39;re getting them. Just be patient.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJ. B.
