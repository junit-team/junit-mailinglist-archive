You&#39;ll be able <br/>\n&gt; to extend the abstract class and provide all getters and <br/>\n&gt; setters and setup the data you need. There will be API for <br/>\n&gt; finders, ejbSelects, etc. So you would not even need the <br/>\n&gt; database to test it. The goal here is to focus on testing the <br/>\n&gt; business logic, not the container-generated SQL. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I see.  Sounds like a good way to do it!<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I have not seen the official statistics but I suspect that <br/>\n&gt; the usage of CMP is on the rise. It is supported by all major <br/>\n&gt; vendors ( can&#39;t say the same about JDO ) and for many <br/>\n&gt; project/organizations that pay big bucks for their app server <br/>\n&gt; licenses it is all that matter. So in many cases it&#39;s not the <br/>\n&gt; choice of CMP vs. Hibernate vs. JDO but CMP vs. roll your <br/>\n&gt; own. Naturally, CMP wins in this case. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, I guess everyone&#39;s mileage varies.  For us, CMP isn&#39;t yet portable enough by itself.  J2EE guarantess a minimum level of portable features (so far), so you end up needing to leverage vendor-specific CMP enhancements, such as auto-incrementing primary keys (IIRC).  But these are dependent on special features or specific databases and deployment descriptors, and pretty soon you need a separate codebase for each vendor.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.mockejb.org\">http://www.mockejb.org</a><br/>\n&gt; EJBs made easy<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is cool.
