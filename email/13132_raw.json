(&quot;create&quot; should be enough, but our bought\nframework requires a longer method name)\n- updateArticle(...)\n- deleteArticle(...)\n- persistArticle(...)\n- findArticleById(...) (works with EJB QL internally)\n- findArticleByWhatever(...)\n- getArticleFactory()\n\nThe DAOs are generated by a generator and store and retrieve Transfer\nObjects. These TOs contain validation rules like maxLength(ID, 5).\n\nWe do some pre-initializations in the factory, for example in\nSupplierFactory. There we initialize a few attributes like\nmainPurchaser = getCurrentUser().\n\nIn our JUnit tests we test a lot:\n- the instance returned by the factory whether it contains certain\ninitializations we expect\n- the finders\n- the validation rules\n- the create update and delete methods\n\nNow some say that we needn&#39;t do so much testing in the persistance\nlayer. I am not sure about it.\n\nFor example, the create, update and delete methods are generated by\nthe generator. Would it be better only to test just one DAO instead of\nall DAOs?\n\nLets illustrate it. Article has a many:one relation to\nMeasurementUnit. In our test we persist a MeasurementUnit, set the\npersisted MeasurementUnit to Article\n(newArticle.setMeasurementUnit(persistedMu)) and then persist Article.\nAfter that we load Article and verify that\nfoundArticle.getMeasurementUnit() is not null.\n\nDo we do too much testing here? How do you test these things? Or don&#39;t\nyou test them or only some of them? Is there any code example of such\na test? What about the finders and the validation rules: Do you test them?\n\n\n\n\n",
