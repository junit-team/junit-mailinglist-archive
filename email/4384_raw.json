It will then generate a\ntest that mimics the interactions with that object. So for example, you&#39;ve\ninherited a pile of code in some legacy application and would like to\nrefactor part of it but don&#39;t have any test cases. Test Mentor will enable\nyou to use the application and by doing so, generate tests for it.\n\nHere&#39;s some links:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\nScreen captures and overview\nhttp://www.silvermark.com/evaluators/5.4releasediagram.html\n\n&quot;Test Mentor - Java Edition product brief&quot;\nTwo page product summary that gives the bare essentials to SilverMark&#39;s\napproach to Java component testing\nhttp://www.silvermark.com/documentation/productBrief.pdf\n\n&quot;The fifteen-minute overview to SilverMark&#39;s Test Mentor - Java Edition&quot;\nAn informal equivalent of a white paper that should take about fifteen\nminutes to read\nhttp://www.javatesting.com/documentation/fifteenminuteguide.pdf\n\n&quot;A Hands-on Introduction to Visual Test Composition with SilverMark&#39;s Test\nMentorT - Java Edition&quot; Tutorial-style introduction to some of Test Mentor&#39;s\nvisual test composition facilities.\nhttp://www.silvermark.com/documentation/visualcomposition.pdf\n\n&quot;A roadmap to full-cycle developer and QA testing&quot;\nSlides presented at STAR-EAST 2000\nhttp://www.silvermark.com/News/presentations/QADeveloperRoadmap.ppt\n\n&quot;Collaborative Model for Developers and Testers using XP&quot;\nPaper presented at XP Universe 2001 that talks about some of the ways that\nTest Mentor pulls QA teams into the component testing process from the\nperspective of Extreme Programming\nhttp://www.javatesting.com/documentation/developerQACollaboration.pdf\n\nJUnit Feature Guide\nThis describes one of the latest features, our transparent integration with\nJUnit assets:\nhttp://www.javatesting.com/documentation/stmjunit.pdf\n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nMike Silverstein\nSilverMark, Inc.\nThe object testing company\nhttp://www.silvermark.com\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: markus baumgartner [mailto:mbg@...]\n&gt; Sent: Friday, March 15, 2002 11:14 AM\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: [junit] Is there a tool which generates JUnit-test stubs?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m spending a lot of time passing new method into the testclass\n&gt; and write a\n&gt; &quot;test_&quot; in front of it (and oftenly forget to do it, too).\n&gt; I made a try to automate the creation of stubs for all existing\n&gt; methods of a\n&gt; class using the Reflection API (e.g. from myProcedure(int A, String B) to\n&gt; test_myProcedure_int_A_String_B. The final goal would be to have the tool\n&gt; comparing the class to the test_class and create stubs for new methods\n&gt; while leaving the existing ones untouched.\n&gt;\n&gt; Before I&#39;m going to create it on my own, I wanted to know, if\n&gt; anybody knows\n&gt; about an existing tool, that does the job?\n&gt;\n&gt; If it does not exist, is there a good reason, why this automation wouldn&#39;t\n&gt; make sense? Sometimes for complex function you may need several testcases,\n&gt; but they can be easely created by taking the first stub and append a\n&gt; number...\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
