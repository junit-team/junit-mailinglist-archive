My attitude has always been the same: if it &quot;cannot&quot; \nchange, then I guess the people involved don&#39;t think it very important \nto test it.\n\nBy the way, this is not a JUnit limitation. It&#39;s a Java limitation. \nSince the method is protected, a TestCase in the same /package/ would be \nable to invoke it directly. Again, this is not a JUnit limitation, it&#39;s \nthe way Java works.\n\nOne of the unavoidable facts of testing (any kind of testing) existing \ncode is that much code is designed in a way that makes testing difficult \nor expensive. If you want to test it effectively, it will have to start \nchanging.\n\nElliotte Harold is the poster boy (and I mean that in a good way!) for \nhaving both a minimal API and well-tested code. I don&#39;t feel quite as \nstrongly about having a minimal API, but then I don&#39;t publish libraries \nmuch, so I don&#39;t have external motivation to care as much about it. He \nhas shown that you /can/ have both, but you probably can&#39;t get there \nwithout making some changes to existing APIs.\n\nSo it&#39;s your choice: which do you value more? The API as it is now, or \nwriting good tests? If you value the first one more, you&#39;ll have to \nsettle for longer, more brittle, more expensive tests. That&#39;s a judgment \nonly your team can make.\n-- \nJ. B.
