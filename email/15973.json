Starting <br/>\nand shutting the platform and is very expensive.  It&#39;s on the order of <br/>\na minute or two to start the platform.  Before I run my unit tests, I <br/>\nwant to start the platform and when they are all done, I want to shut <br/>\nit down.  This is easy to do if I only have one test method in my test <br/>\ncase.  I can just put the startup code in the setup method and the <br/>\nshutdown code in the tear down.  Unfortnately, if I have more than one <br/>\nmethod in the test case this happens before and after each method.  If <br/>\nI have 10 test methods, the unit test could take 20 minutes instead of <br/>\njust 3 minutes.  Is there a way to start the platform, run all of the <br/>\ntests in the TestCase, and then shut down the platform?  Thanks.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJay</div>",
