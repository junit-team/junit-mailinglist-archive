We&#39;d like to \nbe able to test whether or not they have implemented the methods \nwe&#39;ve defined in our interfaces correctly. These tests will include \nverifying that the listeners, events, and graphics do what they&#39;re \nsupposed to do. Obviously, the graphics portion must be verified \nvisually, but what about the non-visual portions? \n\nCan JUnit test this? \n\nThanks, \n\nAdam\n\n\n\n\n",
