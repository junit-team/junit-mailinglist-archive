    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1226046251\">All,<br/>\n<br/>\nDevelopment has begun on JUnit 4.4, which promises to be more revolutionary<br/>\nthan the previous, more evolutionary, releases since 4.1.  This release will<br/>\nlikely contain several new features that we believe are ideal for all<br/>\ntesters.  The first changes, however, are in our support for custom<br/>\nrunners.  If you have ever written, or been tempted to write, a custom<br/>\nrunner, read on.  Otherwise, feel free to archive this mail away, wait here<br/>\nfor further updates.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n...<br/>\n<br/>\n...<br/>\n<br/>\nAre they gone?  Good.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy annotating a test class with @RunWith, a tester can declare to JUnit that<br/>\na class should be interpreted in a vastly different way than usual.  A great<br/>\nexample is Johannes Link&#39;s ClasspathSuite runner (<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://johanneslink.net/cpsuite.html)\">http://johanneslink.net/cpsuite.html)</a>.  However, if an extender of JUnit<br/>\nwanted a class to be interpreted in mostly the same way, but with a slight<br/>\nchange (for example, the custom runner that ships with JMock 2), they are<br/>\nrequired to copy or inherit from internal classes like TestClassRunner.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn 4.4, we will add API classes that will make this process easier.  At the<br/>\nsame time, the internal package will undergo significant changes, almost<br/>\ncertainly breaking custom runners that have depended on these classes in the<br/>\npast.  In order to ease this transition, we would like to involve each of<br/>\nyou to get your feedback about what should change, and also to provide you<br/>\nwith frequent feedback about what is changing.  To that end, CVS HEAD has<br/>\nbeen updated with the latest work, and a 4.4-snapshots release category has<br/>\nbeen created on sourceforge for snapshot zips.  You&#39;ll notice, for example,<br/>\nthat TestClassRunner is already gone, replaced by JUnit4ClassRunner.  Other<br/>\nchanges are also afoot.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor further discussion on this topic, please join the junitcomplements<br/>\nmailing list at<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/junitcomplements/\">http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/junitcomplements/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI look forward to seeing you there!<br/>\n<br/>\n   David Saff<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
