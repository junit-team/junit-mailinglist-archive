To the degree that<br/>\nthere is redundancy between the code and the tests, it feels like a waste of<br/>\ntime, and you&#39;d like to eliminate that waste. <br/>\n <br/>\nOne of the principles involved in testing is double checking--say something<br/>\nin two different ways and if they match, you have a good chance you are<br/>\nsaying what you intend to say. The philosophical problem I have with<br/>\ngenerating code from tests, or test from code, or tests and code from some<br/>\nother notation, is that it ignores double checking. The baby of<br/>\ndouble-checking goes out with the bathwater of redundancy.<br/>\n <br/>\nI like the JUnitFactory tests because they give me an independent<br/>\nperspective on my code. Manually inspecting generated tests gives me a<br/>\nmeasure of double checking. &quot;Really?!? factorial(100) == 0???&quot; <br/>\n <br/>\nProgramming language design seemed for many years to be the quest for a<br/>\nnotation so clear that programmers couldn&#39;t make mistakes. The<br/>\nsmall-but-growing popularity of developer testing seems to me to be evidence<br/>\nthat double checking is a more fruitful strategy for achieving reliable<br/>\nsoftware.<br/>\n <br/>\nAll of that said, I agree with the desire for less redundant test notations.<br/>\n@Theory, for example, seems to promise more confidence/line of test code.<br/>\n <br/>\nRegards,<br/>\n <br/>\nKent Beck<br/>\nThree Rivers Institute<br/>\n<br/>\n  _____  <br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of Ole<br/>\nErsoy<br/>\nSent: Thursday, February 08, 2007 9:45 PM<br/>\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com<br/>\nSubject: Re: [junit] Future of testing tools<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHi Kent,<br/>\n<br/>\nWe had a pretty good discussion around this <br/>\non this thread:<br/>\n<br/>\nhttp://www.nabble.<br/>\n&lt;http://www.nabble.com/100---Method-Testing-and-Generating-Unit-Tests-tf2902<br/>\n785.html&gt; com/100---Method-Testing-and-Generating-Unit-Tests-tf2902785.html<br/>\n<br/>\nI think we could summarize it to having a design tool<br/>\nthat helps design the architecture of the system,<br/>\nperhaps narrowed by concern area and architectural<br/>\nlayer (Presentation, application, business,<br/>\nintegration ,data) and then generates tests that<br/>\nenumerate all the corner and edge cases, helping the<br/>\ndesigner / developer validate the system.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally I would like to see it combined with<br/>\nsomething like this:<br/>\n<br/>\nhttp://www.eclipse.<br/>\n&lt;http://www.eclipse.org/articles/Article-EMF-Codegen-with-OCL/article.html&gt;<br/>\norg/articles/Article-EMF-Codegen-with-OCL/article.html<br/>\n<br/>\nSomething that generates both the application code and<br/>\nthe corresponding test cases. Then makes it as simple<br/>\nas possible for the users / solution recipients to<br/>\nvalidate the system. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m going to summarize the thread in a little apache<br/>\nlicensed eclipse documentation plugin just elaborating<br/>\non the enumeration methodology, etc. discussed in the<br/>\nthread. I&#39;ll post back when it&#39;s done.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW - Thanks a gazillion (To Eric as as well) for<br/>\nwriting &quot;Contributing to Eclipse&quot; and JUnit. I think<br/>\ncalling it &quot;Briliant work&quot; would be an understatement.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\n- Ole<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Kent Beck &lt;kentb@earthlink. &lt;mailto:kentb%40earthlink.net&gt; net&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; All,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; At the Agile Open Northwest conference I held an<br/>\n&gt; open space session on the<br/>\n&gt; future of testing tools. I expected to talk a little<br/>\n&gt; about Theories and<br/>\n&gt; assertThat, but we ended up having a wide-ranging<br/>\n&gt; discussion about a variety<br/>\n&gt; of topics. I mind-mapped the result and put in on<br/>\n&gt; the conference wiki: <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>http://www.agileope<br/>\n&lt;http://www.agileopennorthwest.com/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?FutureOfUnitTesting&gt;<br/>\nnnorthwest.com/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?FutureOfUnitTesting<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The most surprising result to me was the interest in<br/>\n&gt; language features for<br/>\n&gt; testing-what would a language look like that<br/>\n&gt; included double-checking as a<br/>\n&gt; first-class concept? I was also surprised at how<br/>\n&gt; much commonality there was<br/>\n&gt; between the unit and functional testing &quot;vendors&quot;,<br/>\n&gt; that reporting is a big<br/>\n&gt; issue for everyone.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; One thing missing from the discussion was much talk<br/>\n&gt; about the hopes and<br/>\n&gt; dreams of users, so I thought I would open up the<br/>\n&gt; question here. What is it<br/>\n&gt; you wish your testing tool would do for you that it<br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Cheers,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Kent Beck<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Three Rivers Institute<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been<br/>\n&gt; removed]<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________________<br/>\nNow that&#39;s room service!
