We want to use JUnit as \ntools for performing unit testing. However, I found difficulties that \ntest the correctness of JFrame (with other GUI components). Does it \npossible that test by using JUnit, say, the JLabel is appear correct \ncaption after some changes. But at the same moment, how can I tigger \nthe changes in JUnit?\n  Would you mind teaching me any tips to tackle this problems? Or \ndoes it has any articles/guide to the implementation of this kind of \ntesting??\n\n  Best regards and thanks a lot for kind attention.\n\nMonster~\n\n\n\n",
