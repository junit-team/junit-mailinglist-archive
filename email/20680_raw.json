In fact you can found\nrudi=\r\nments in my previous post - the name of methods are setUp() and\ntearDown() =\r\nand even the comments is &quot;do your one time set-up here!&quot; :-)\nWhat I think i=\r\ns that the author of this thread is familiar with this\ntechnique and used i=\r\nt in his previous job win JUnit 3.8.x. What he is\nactually asking is how to=\r\n do the same with JUnit 4.x. \nI remember that I was surprised when I migrat=\r\ned to JUnit 4.x with the\nlack of such a feature, also searching the web, di=\r\ndn&#39;t succeed, so I\ndecided to &quot;invent the wheel&quot;. I will be be grateful if =\r\nindeed\n@BeforeSuite and @AfterSuite feature will be implemented. \n\n--- In j=\r\nunit@yahoogroups.com, David Beidle &lt;dabeidle@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Lars,\n&gt; \n&gt; It =\r\nseems like the obvious suggestion is missing from this thread (or I  \n&gt; at =\r\nleast missed it)...\n&gt; \n&gt; Since you&#39;re using JUnit 3, have you tried the Tes=\r\ntSetup decorator  \n&gt; available in that version to provide one-time suite se=\r\ntUp and tearDown  \n&gt; methods. For example:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;      public static Test =\r\nsuite(Class testClass) {\n&gt;          TestSetup suite =3D new junit.extension=\r\ns.TestSetup(new  \n&gt; TestSuite(testClass)) {\n&gt;              protected void s=\r\netUp() {\n&gt;                  // set up at the start o suite execution\n&gt;     =\r\n         }\n&gt;              protected void tearDown() {\n&gt;                  //=\r\n tear down at the end of suite execution\n&gt;              }\n&gt;          };\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt;          return suite;\n&gt;      }\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve used this technique in a variet=\r\ny of scenarios to perform one-time  \n&gt; initialization for a suite. I&#39;ve use=\r\nd it in test case base classes to  \n&gt; provide similar behavior across deriv=\r\native classes. In the example  \n&gt; above, I used TestSetup as an anonymous c=\r\nlass, but you could extend it  \n&gt; or just add additional methods to provide=\r\n the behavior needed.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Dave Beidle\n&gt;   The aKamali Group, Inc.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n On Jul 10, 2008, at 8:37 AM, Joakim Ohlrogge wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; It sounds from =\r\nyour description that you are using JUnit 3.8.x ? In\n&gt; &gt; that case it shoul=\r\nd not be too difficult to do by subclassing\n&gt; &gt; TestSuite. The problem is t=\r\nhat your test will not work if you run them\n&gt; &gt; outside the suite (unless y=\r\nou cater for that in some clever way).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Subclassing TestSuite in pri=\r\nnciple (have not tested this but the\n&gt; &gt; correct answer should be similar e=\r\nnough)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; NetworkTestSuite extends TestSuite {\n&gt; &gt; public run(TestResu=\r\nlt result) {\n&gt; &gt; startNetwork();\n&gt; &gt; super.run(result);\n&gt; &gt; stopNetwork();\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; }\n&gt; &gt; }\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Then you can just use NetworkTestSuite in place of Test=\r\nSuite in the\n&gt; &gt; root of the tests that need a running network (or whatever=\r\n it was that\n&gt; &gt; you wanted like this:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; public static Test suite() {=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; TestSuite suite=3D new NetworkTestSuite();\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; suite.addTest(M=\r\noneyTest.class);\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; return suite;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; }\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I hope this helps.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; /J\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; On Wed, Jul 9, 2008 at 8:53 AM, lars &lt;lars.carlsson@...&gt;  \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi\n&gt; &gt; &gt; At my company we have alot of automated test case=\r\ns and in all our\n&gt; &gt; &gt; suite we have a setup testcase and a teardown test c=\r\nase where we  \n&gt; &gt; setup\n&gt; &gt; &gt; network connection that takes some time and =\r\ncan not be done in  \n&gt; &gt; every TC. ,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; But i think that there should ex=\r\nist a suite setup and a teardown and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; not be in a setup/teardown TC.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Are there any why of doing this or how could i best be solve this by\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; extending TestSuite?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Regards Lars\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; -- \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; -----------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; Joakim Ohlrog=\r\nge\n&gt; &gt; Agical AB\n&gt; &gt; V=E4sterl=E5nggatan 79, 2 tr\n&gt; &gt; 111 29 Stockholm, SWE=\r\nDEN\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Mobile: +46-708-754004\n&gt; &gt; Blog: johlrogge.wordpress.com\n&gt; &gt; E-=\r\nmail: joakim.ohlrogge@...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this me=\r\nssage have been removed]\n&gt;\n\n\n\n",
