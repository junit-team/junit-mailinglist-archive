B. Rainsberger&quot; &lt;jbrains@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Wh=\r\nen I wrote _JUnit Recipes_, my examples used EasyMock. I liked it \n&gt; becaus=\r\ne it was simple for the simplest case of setting expectations.\n&gt; \n&gt; When I =\r\nstarted using jMock, I much preferred it, because:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. It has direct su=\r\npport for fakes/stubs.\n\nEasyMock 1 had default return values/throwables for=\r\n that,\nEasyMock 2 has stub return values/throwables for that.\n\n&gt; 2. It make=\r\ns ignoring method parameters easy.\n\nI agree, This was a major pain in EasyM=\r\nock 1.\nThe rationale behind this was that I found no way to make\nthis refac=\r\ntoring-safe (reordering parameter refactorings should\nnot break the test). =\r\nIn EasyMock 2, matchers can be defined\ndirectly in the method calls, allowi=\r\nng to ignore arguments,\nmatch only parts of an argument, and so on. \nYou ma=\r\ny even define your own matchers.\n\n&gt; 3. Its support for complex parameter, m=\r\nethod or invocation matching is \n&gt; great.\n\nEasyMock 2 has much better suppo=\r\nrt for that. Argument matchers\nare in my opinion better. Inter-mock depende=\r\nncies can be defined.\n\n&gt; If there is ever a 2nd edition of _JUnit Recipes_,=\r\n I will replace all \n&gt; the EasyMock example code with jMock.\n\nAs the author=\r\n of EasyMock, I am sad to hear that.\nCan you elaborate which features are m=\r\nissing in \nEasyMock 2 that are so crucial that you consider switching?\n\n&gt; T=\r\nhe people who don&#39;t like jMock often say it&#39;s because declaring the \n&gt; meth=\r\nod names as strings makes refactoring more error-prone. That might \n&gt; be th=\r\ne case, but I have never felt pain as a result of it.\n\nIt&#39;s not only a prob=\r\nlem when renaming methods. \n\nReordering, adding, or removing parameters all=\r\n break tests at runtime, \nand you have to adapt them manually to the new si=\r\ntuation. \nTests using EasyMock work after reordering and removing\nparameter=\r\ns, and after adding parameters if no matchers were used.\n\nAnd there is also=\r\n the issue of code completion when defining expectations.\nWith JMock, it do=\r\nes not work, you have to rely on text completion features.\nWith EasyMock, i=\r\nt works like a charm.\n\n-\nTammo Freese \n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
