This is\n&gt; probably not difficult add in one way or another onto =\r\nthe concept of\n&gt; categories, but the answer to &quot;which test is now acctually=\r\n included&quot; could\n&gt; become confusing in cases where a test is in an included=\r\n and an excluded\n&gt; category. I would like to see something here that does n=\r\not require a lot of\n&gt; browsing through hierarchies of suites nad categories=\r\n. This may in my\n&gt; approach not well solved either as suites can extend on =\r\nother suites: if a\n&gt; referenced suite includes a certain test, it is execut=\r\ned even if the\n&gt; extending suite excludes a test.\n&gt;\n&gt; And more fundamentall=\r\ny: is the idea/need of exclusion meaningfull or just a\n&gt; result of badly or=\r\nganising tests (I&#39;d say no, but I may be wrong)?\n&gt;\n\nFor what it&#39;s worth, ex=\r\ncluding tests is a very popular TestNG features.
