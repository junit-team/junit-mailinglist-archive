He has been\n&gt; doing some macroscopic integration testing with the latest\n&gt; CVS of a large number of projects including every Apache\n&gt; project and quite a few outside Apache.  He has built an\n&gt; automated notification system when changes to the code base\n&gt; affect other projects.  For instance, JUnit is used in a\n&gt; number of Apache projects, and a recent change forces all\n&gt; the current projects testing to break.  Their test cases\n&gt; won&#39;t compile.  I highly recommend allowing him to add\n&gt; this mailing list (junit@yahoogroups.com) to the list of\n&gt; automatic notifications.\n\n&gt; Basically what will happen is that if JUnit fails to compile,\n&gt; due to changes in dependencies of other projects changing,\n&gt; then GUMP will notify you of that change.  Also, when a change\n&gt; you committed breaks other projects, you will be notified.\n\nNotification that junit failed to compile can be done, but that is not what\nhappened here.   I&#39;m not sure that automatic notification when any other\nproject fails would be helpful.  If I see a problem in one project that\nlooks to be caused by somebody else, I try to do some isolation and manual\nnotification.\n\n&gt; The whole reason for this is so that the preferred method of\n&gt; deprecating old APIs is enforced, and changes to the API are\n&gt; not concidered lightly.\n\nIn this case, there were two classes of errors introduced in last night&#39;s\nbuild.  One was that a deprecated API was removed.  That is quite\nreasonable, and gump is helping to get the word out that if people were\nignoring this deprecation warning up to this point, they really should plan\nfor it at this time.  It is remotely possible that a groundswell will form\nasking that this deprecated API be kept on longer, but more likely in my\nopinion is that people will simply move up.\n\nThe other dealt with class loader issues, and I saw that a related change\nwas made in junit at the same time.  It is not clear at this time, however,\nthat that change caused the breakage.\n\nI may be in the minority in this mailing list, but discussion on the\nremoval of APIs that are actively seems like an appropriate topic for this\nmailing list.\n\n=- Sam Ruby\n\n\n",
