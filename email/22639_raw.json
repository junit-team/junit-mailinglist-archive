Unit tests are executed=\r\n, and if passed ok they are then ignored, when the final package is created=\r\n. \n\nTherefore, I think the concern for this difference in the compiled code=\r\n is not justified. \n\nMoreover, I don&#39;t think it is possible to make the com=\r\npiler ommit parts of the code based on annotations. At most you can benefit=\r\n of the smart features of the compiler that, as you said, eliminates the pa=\r\nrts of the code that cannot be reached because of some final condition. So =\r\nyou could technically define a multitude of final constants, like some swit=\r\nches, that can enable/disable parts of the unit tests.\n\nBut I repeat: I thi=\r\nnk the effort is not justified. We are talking here about unit tests, which=\r\n are not deployed on client&#39;s system.\n\nCheers,\nBogdan\n\n--- In junit@yahoogr=\r\noups.com, &quot;tomte_da&quot; &lt;taeger@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt; yes, String concatenatio=\r\nn is known to be a serious performance lack. \n&gt; \n&gt; And it also blows up the=\r\n size of the compiled code without use. At least for code to be transmitted=\r\n over the Internet (e.g. by Java Web Start or in Applets) this should be av=\r\noided too. \n&gt; \n&gt; Java does conditional compilation if the condition is fina=\r\nl.\n&gt; \n&gt; Without conditional compilation there is no other way than commenti=\r\nng out the hundreds of assertions manually - not really realistic. This kee=\r\nps me from using standard test frameworks in my own projects. \n&gt; \n&gt; In my o=\r\nwn logger I have such a global boolean flag to disable test code generation=\r\n. But this also can not stop those message String concatenations because th=\r\nese are done before passing the resulting String to the internally disabled=\r\n assertTrue(message, ok) method.\n&gt; \n&gt; Would it be technically impossible to=\r\n solve this through an annotation like e.g. @EnableTestCodeGeneration? Anno=\r\ntations are recognized at compile time.\n&gt; \n&gt; tomte\n&gt;\n\n\n\n",
