To test\n&gt;  one Service (under 2,000 lines of code for 7 methods using 80\n&gt;  properties) that simply offers a standard set of\n&gt;  Get/Create/Update/Delete methods on an entity, the tests run over 5\n&gt;  files to a total length of 30,000 lines! In order to get test\n&gt;  coverage above 80%, there&#39;s a large amount of test code that simply\n&gt;  checks that the gets/sets work... which most of the time they can&#39;t\n&gt;  help but do anyway.\n&lt;/SNIP&gt;\n\nHi,\n\nI have selectively responded to the paragraph I can offer input to;\nhope thats OK :-)\n\nRegarding he getters/setters testing, some believe it is trivial, but\nI&#39;ve been burned too many times to not do it.  You don&#39;t have to do\nit... until you do ;-)  To ease the pain - try to implement/utilise\nTestUtil from\nhttp://gtcgroup.com/util/\nthen one line of code tests your accessors.\n\nThe other thing that strikes me in this paragraph of your post, was\nthat these classes/methods are perhaps rather large.  Most TDD methods\nare short and succint, five to 10 lines.  It appears as if there is a\nfear of adding methods or classes here, or perhaps that your workplace\nis not doing TDD, but adding tests after the fact to get code coverage\nup to pass QA.  In my experince TDD lends itself to nice short\ntestable methods.  A really good example of this, (short methods), in\na large system is to look at any smalltalk image, (which I&#39;m guessing\nyou will be able to browse and and get the gist of the unfamiliar\ncode) - perhaps Squeak\nhttp://www.squeak.org  - very few of the entire systems methods fall\ninto the size you describe.\n\nAs you have good tests already, heavy refactoring, (Extract Method),\nbefore changing any code may be the way to ease the load, the amount\nof code under test, and the amount of setup required.\n\nRegards,\nChris\n\n",
