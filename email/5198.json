    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1513948072\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt; Hmmm...just to jump in the middle for a<br/>\n&gt; second...personally, I dislike unchecked exceptions. <br/>\n&gt; I used to like them, because, similar to your<br/>\n&gt; experience, you could ignore them and not have the<br/>\n&gt; ripple effect when refactoring.  However, I&#39;ve seen<br/>\n&gt; this as an excuse to completely ignore the exception,<br/>\n&gt; in both testing and production.  Don&#39;t like that at<br/>\n&gt; all.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I agree, but at some point, you have to trust the people doing the work to do <br/>\nthe work. If they ignore exceptions both in tests and in production, then <br/>\nperhaps you need to replace them. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; So, I&#39;ve decided to knuckle down and NOT use<br/>\n&gt; unchecked exceptions whenever possible.  This *forces*<br/>\n&gt; you to handle them.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t like the patterns that checked exceptions compel me to use: converted <br/>\nexception, and so on... it all sounds like jumping through hoops just to <br/>\nsatisfy the compiler. My job is to make tests run, dammit, not to make the <br/>\ncompiler happy!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; That fact that you say using them allows the compiler<br/>\n&gt; to &#39;get in the way&#39; sounds like a non-issue.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>&quot;sounds like&quot;? With respect, do you *know* that it is a nonissue? (If so, how <br/>\ndo I make it go away?!) For me, it *is* an issue; otherwise, I wouldn&#39;t feel <br/>\nso strongly. <br/>\n<br/>\nI want to let exceptions propagate as much as possible, because exceptions <br/>\nrepresent situations where my code has to throw up its hands and say, &quot;Man, I <br/>\ncan&#39;t go any further.&quot; In most cases, that&#39;s unrecoverable within the layer <br/>\nand I want to propagate the exception up to the caller. In that case, checked <br/>\nexceptions couple the caller to callee unnecessarily at compile time. <br/>\n<br/>\nYes, the caller needs to be aware of and handle the exception; however, I&#39;m <br/>\nnot convinced that the compiler is the only way to achieve that. We&#39;ve <br/>\nmanaged quite nicely without the compiler&#39;s help and I&#39;m happy with the <br/>\nresults. Again: that&#39;s what tests are for and that&#39;s why code is written by <br/>\nhumans and not automatically generated.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Is this<br/>\n&gt; coupling between your two systems?  Maybe...but I<br/>\n&gt; (personally) would rather have it and make damn sure<br/>\n&gt; those exceptions are handled.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What fear are you addressing by using checked exceptions? Since it is <br/>\npossible to get along without them, you may be afraid of something in order <br/>\nto want to use them. What might that be? (Please help me; I sound like Ron.)<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJ. B.
