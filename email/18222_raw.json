You clearly ARE, but\n&gt; I just don&#39;t understand how... I must be missing something!\n&gt; \n&gt; So, given the sort of work we&#39;re doing, and the kind of structure\n&gt; I&#39;ve tried to describe, can anyone out there tell me how I&#39;ve gone so\n&gt; far off track here? Or give me some real examples of quick, useful\n&gt; test classes on stuff like this?\n&gt; I just KNOW that I must be doing it all wrong, but I can&#39;t seem to\n&gt; find any real-world examples of how to do it right on this scale. Any\n&gt; help would be gratefully recieved!\n\nI tried to read it all, I really did, but I got lost. :) I understand. \nI&#39;ve written &quot;Help!&quot; letters that long and longer.\n\nIt sounds like you have a big application and you want to test it, but \nso many things have direct dependencies on so many other things that you \ncan&#39;t take a piece of it and test it without involving the rest. Did I \nget that right?\n\nTwo books:\n\n&quot;Working Effectively with Legacy Code&quot;\n&quot;JUnit Recipes&quot;\n\nI wrote one of them, so I understand if you don&#39;t trust my endorsement.\n\nRead those, then come back with some specific questions. I promise they \nwill help you.\n-- \nJ. B.
