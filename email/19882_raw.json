It means that, in yo=\r\nur example, you\nwould not be able to execute the &quot;Sub&quot; class directly as a =\r\nJUnit test.\nAs Joe B. Rainsberger said later in the thread, It is probably =\r\na problem\nwith Eclipse and I will try to work around it.\n\nAl\n\n--- In junit@=\r\nyahoogroups.com, &quot;Kent Beck&quot; &lt;kentb@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Al,\n&gt;\n&gt; What you a=\r\nre trying to do makes good sense. However, I wasn&#39;t able to\n&gt; reproduce you=\r\nr error. Here is the test case that works for me:\n&gt;\n&gt; public class Inherite=\r\ndTestTest {\n&gt;     public abstract static class Super {\n&gt;         @Test publ=\r\nic void nothing() {}\n&gt;     }\n&gt;     public static class Sub extends Super {}=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt;     @Test public void subclassWithOnlyInheritedTestsRuns() {\n&gt;        =\r\n Result result=3D JUnitCore.runClasses(Sub.class);\n&gt;         assertTrue(res=\r\nult.wasSuccessful());\n&gt;     }\n&gt; }\n&gt;\n&gt; What error message are you seeing?\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt;\n&gt; Kent Beck\n&gt; Three Rivers Institute\n&gt;\n&gt;   _____\n&gt;\n&gt; From: jun=\r\nit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf\nOf Al\n&gt; May\n&gt; S=\r\nent: Friday, August 24, 2007 11:11 AM\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject=\r\n: [junit] Test with no class inside\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt;\n&gt; Is it possible to have =\r\na test class without any tests inside its body\n&gt; (e.g. with no @Test annota=\r\ntion inside) ? It&#39;s because I&#39;ve created an\n&gt; abstract class containing all=\r\n my tests and I extend this class for\n&gt; each implementation that I have to =\r\ntest. By doing this, I don&#39;t need\n&gt; to write redundant code to test differe=\r\nnt kind of implementations. To\n&gt; help you better understand, I give you an =\r\nexample :\n&gt;\n&gt; public abstract class FirstTest {\n&gt;\n&gt; @Test\n&gt; public test1() =\r\n{\n&gt; // ...\n&gt; IFactory factory =3D getFactory();\n&gt; // ...\n&gt; }\n&gt;\n&gt; @Test\n&gt; pu=\r\nblic test2() {\n&gt; // ...\n&gt; IFactory factory =3D getFactory();\n&gt; // ...\n&gt; }\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; protected abstract IFactory getFactory();\n&gt;\n&gt; }\n&gt;\n&gt; /*\n&gt; * This class sh=\r\nould be considered a test class even there is no\n&gt; * @Test inside. Normally=\r\n, it inherit all the test methods from\n&gt; * the superclass.\n&gt; *\n&gt; */\n&gt; publi=\r\nc class Implementation1Test extends FirstTest {\n&gt;\n&gt; protected IFactory getF=\r\nactory() {\n&gt; return new MyFirstImplementationFactory();\n&gt; }\n&gt;\n&gt; }\n&gt;\n&gt; Now, =\r\nif I try to run Implementation1Test as a JUnit test, Eclipse\n&gt; reports me a=\r\nn error. I have to specify at least one @Test annotation\n&gt; in my concrete t=\r\nest class. Is there anybody who can help how to do\nthat ?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Al\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n\n\n\n",
