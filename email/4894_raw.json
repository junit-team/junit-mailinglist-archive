(Hence Test-Driven Development.)\n&gt; \n&gt; IME it&#39;s a bidirectional dependency: The currently failing test \n&gt; drives the implementation. When the test runs, the incomplete \n&gt; implementation drives the next test.\n\nI agree with that.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; The best tests are ones that:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; * Test everything that could possibly break in the current\n&gt; implementation\n&gt; \n&gt; This is obviously implementation dependend, isn&#39;t it?\n\nYou need at least one implementaiton to know what you are testing\nfor.  In my world, it is Contract dependant.  But I agree with the\ngeneral statement.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; [...]\n&gt; &gt; I find my life difficult when my tests get in the way of my \n&gt; &gt; refactorings... tests that have intimate knowledge of the \n&gt; implementation tend \n&gt; &gt; to be refactoring-resistant. I tend away from them if I can.\n&gt; \n&gt; And that is probably wise. But even if you strive to avoid a &quot;how-\n&gt; dependency&quot; between tests and implementation, do you also avoid \n&gt; a &quot;what-dependency&quot;? That is, if you try to think about missing test \n&gt; cases, don&#39;t you take a look at the current implementation???\n\nOf course.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; How do you decide what tests are sufficient for a sort(String[]) \n&gt; method?\n\nYou start with the obvious ones.  If you think to much about what\ncould possibly go wrong you have the testing equivalent of analysis\nparalysis.\n\nIt is an iterative thing--both the implementaiton and the test evolve.\nIf that evolution breaks a test, you have to decide if the test is\nat fault or (more probably) the implementation is at fault.  You evolve\nthe test as you find different essoteric parameters that the current\nimplementation fails on.  That way you have a _regression_ testing\nthat works.\n\n\n",
