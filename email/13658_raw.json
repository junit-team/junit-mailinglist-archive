Then you can put the \n&gt; reparse\n&gt; of your file in setUp(), which -- as someone said earlier -- makes the\n&gt; intent obvious.\n&gt;\n&gt; Let me stress this point further.\n&gt;\n&gt; In JUnit, you have four ways to initialize / tear down your test, and \n&gt; they\n&gt; are *all* equivalent:\n&gt;\n&gt; - At the beginning and end of each test method\n&gt; - In setUp()/tearDown()\n&gt; - In the constructor\n&gt; - At the field declaration level\n&gt;\n&gt; I find that confusing as hell, so I *strongly* recommend to use\n&gt; setUp/tearDown at the exclusion of everything else.  Again, the idea \n&gt; is to\n&gt; make the intent obvious.\n\nActually, each of these methods is *not* equivalent, although they all \nhave the same &quot;scope&quot; with respect to a given test (i.e. they affect a \nsingle test method).  Those non-intuitive differences add to the \nargument that only one method should be used and the others excluded.\n\n\nNotably:\n\n   setUp/tearDown: preferred, since exceptions are handled and \npropagated as test results; also separates setup/cleanup from the \nactual tests\n\n   within test method: makes the test method cluttered and more complex \nif you properly handle cleanup within the test method\n\n   constructor/field declaration: no teardown whatsoever; whether or not \nfields get GC&#39;d depends on your test runner (the JUnit runners won&#39;t \never release your tests, and therefore your fields remain uncollected). \n  note also that between this method and setup/teardown there is a big \ndifference between *when* the setup takes place; setup/teardown doesn&#39;t \ntake effect until the test is actually run, while constructor/field \ndeclaration happens as soon as the test object is created.\n\n\n",
