Good questions.\n\nmherrmann_at wrote:\n\n&gt; I&#39;m sorry for repeating myself but I fear that my last message\n&gt; (http://groups.yahoo.com/group/junit/message/15268) \n&gt; &lt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/junit/message/15268%29&gt; might have been\n&gt; overlooked.\n&gt;\n&gt; What do the people who haven&#39;t yet responded think about\n&gt; @Before/@BeforeClass vs. @BeforeTest/@BeforeSuite? Please, give us\n&gt; your comments. Nothing will happen if you don&#39;t speak your mind!\n\nThere&#39;s an interesting, whimsical point in favor of @Before that I&#39;ll \nbring up in a future post.\n\n&gt; What is the overall opinion about Joe Walnes&#39; aproach to flexible\n&gt; JUnit assertions using assertThat? \n\nIt&#39;s great.\n\n&gt; Do you think it is better or worse\n&gt; than the current assertions? \n\nI use both together.\n\n&gt; I would like to have it included in the\n&gt; new release, would you too? David, why do you think using constraints\n&gt; is heavy weight?\n\nConstraint in JMock has two abstract methods: eval and describeTo.  \nDescribe is really cool, because it allows, basically for free, error \nmessages like:\n\njunit.framework.AssertionFailedError:\nExpected: not (eq(&lt;a bad sentence&gt;) or a string containing &quot;a bad word&quot;)\nbut got : This is a bad word\n\nOn the other hand, it can double the amount of work for each \nimplementing class.  I&#39;m still split on whether this is worth it.\n\nThis is actually a lot different than saying &quot;Constraints are heavy \nweight&quot;.  It may be the same thing as saying &quot;it&#39;s not yet quite clear \nwhat the perfect definition of assertThat is&quot;.\n\n&gt; And why\n&gt; 1) does junit.framework.Assert still define assertEquals for\n&gt; boolean, int, long etc. (autoboxing could do that; in fact, deleting\n&gt; those methods doesn&#39;t produce any errors)?\n\n&gt; 2) isn&#39;t java.lang.AssertionError used instead of\n&gt; junit.framework.AssertionFailedError?\n\njunit.framework.Assert is there for backward compatibility.  For \norg.junit.Assert, #2 is already true, and #1 is interesting...\n\n    David Saff\n\n",
