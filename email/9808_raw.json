Ideally each INSTANCE of each SUBCLASS of the TestCase class\n&gt;  &gt; embodies a single fixture.  The class describes that fixture.  By that\n&gt;  &gt; I mean that all test methods in the class run in the context of that\n&gt;  &gt; fixture in a maximally cohesive way (i.e. it is not the case that some\n&gt;  &gt; tests uses part of the fixture and other tests use some other part of\n&gt;  &gt; the fixture).\n&gt; \n&gt; Dave, as I read the JUnit text it is saying that the classes under test are\n&gt; the fixture, not that the TestCase subclass is the fixture. You seem to be\n&gt; saying that the TestCase subclass is the fixture.\n\nPardon me, Ron. If every instance of a class is the same, then there is \nnot much point in distinguishing between object and class, except if \nyou&#39;re talking to a compiler. As you doubtless know, one commonly says \nthat a collection has a property if all its elements have that property. \nIt&#39;s just a kind of verbal shorthand.\n\nThus, the TestCase subclass is, in effect, the fixture: all \nfreshly-initialized instances of that class (as in, after invoking \nsetUp) represent the same fixture state.\n\nDoes that statement compile? No. But then we&#39;re not compilers. :)\n-- \nJ. B.
