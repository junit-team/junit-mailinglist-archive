Even then, if/when one fails, it<br/>\nwon&#39;t initially be clear if it failed because of a<br/>\nreal bug, or because the tests are stepping on each<br/>\nother.  And even when you figure that out, it will not<br/>\nbe clear what the right approach is to fixing the<br/>\nproblem with the test.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve had an issue where tests were stepping on each<br/>\nother, but we were apparently using a multithreaded<br/>\nrunner.  I used synchronized blocks to fix it up, but<br/>\nI was constantly having to find and synchronize stuff,<br/>\nso I&#39;d consider that a cheap hack at best.<br/>\n<br/>\nKevin<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nNew DSL Internet Access from SBC & Yahoo!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sbc.yahoo.com\">http://sbc.yahoo.com</a></div>",
