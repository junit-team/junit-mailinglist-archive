So far, I&#39;ve been \n&gt; using to EasyMock to prepare a mock callback handler, but it is pretty \n&gt; painful to record each and every expected call, even when using some \n&gt; procedural abstraction.\n&gt; \n\nRelated questions :\n\n[I just flicked through all the relevant chapters in JUnit Recipes to \navoid the inevitable :-) ]\n\nI have always written stubs/mocks/fakes by hand but I have wanted to \ngive EasyMock a try for a while now and did so on a toy project (a robot \nfor Robocode if you really want to know !)\n\n\nWith EasyMock. I found that all my tests suddenly got more verbose and \nmore fragile.\n\n\nOn fragility :\n\nLets say I want to pass an interface into a constructor :\n\npublic void testXXX {\n   IRobot robot = &lt;from easy mock&gt;\n   // setup some expectations\n\n   Radar radar = new Radar(robot);\n   // an assertion about the radar\n}\n\nI have a whole bunch of tests like this (suitably factored using setup() \nand the like).\n\nThe problem comes when I later want to do something extra in the radar&#39;s \nconstructor, say robot.getRadarHeading().  Now every test that calls the \nconstructor will need to change to set the appropriate expectation.\n\n\n\nOn verbosity :\n\nIf I did this manually, I would probably generate a base mock object for \nIRobot that has sensible default behavior and then extend it anonymously \nfor particular tests. If a method does three things, I can write a test \nfor just one of those things. I find that when I use EasyMock, every \ntest has to be aware of those three things and hence every test seems to \nbe about three times bigger than it would otherwise have been.\n\n\nand one last quibble :\n\nThe vast majority of my tests lok like this :\n\npublic void testXXX() {\n   // some setup\n   // an operation\n   // some assertions\n}\n\nbut with easy mock my tests look more like this :\n\npublic void testXXX() {\n   // some setup mixed in with expectations\n   // an operation\n   // verify\n}\n\nIt&#39;s often hard to tell the setup from the expectations, which feels \nlike a loss from an &quot;express intent&quot; point of view.\n\n\nDoes this match other people&#39;s experience ? How do YOU deal with them ? \nAny suggestions for me ? Am I doing everything completely wrong ? Should \nI just suck it up ?\n\n\nThanks in advance !\n\n\nKevin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
