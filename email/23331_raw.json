What JUnit does well \nis automate the testing. It is very widely supported by many frameworks \nthat leverage it.\n\nFor example, for Spring applications, there&#39;s the Spring Test Framework \nwhich is part of the Spring Framework, and also Unitils, which supports \nSpring, mocking and databases - see http://www.unitils.org/\n\nHowever, for your application, you&#39;re looking for something that is \ntuned towards automating UI tests. Selenium is probably the most widely \nused.\n\nWe find Selenium to be very easy to create modular and powerful tests \nsuites. We run it from within JUnit.\n\nRegards,\n\nNeale\n\nNeale Upstone\nOpen Credo Ltd � Excellence in Enterprise Software Development\nCertified SpringSource Delivery Partner\n\n\nOn 16/03/2011 06:26, jyotirmoy wrote:\n&gt; Hi Seniors,\n&gt;   I am a newbie in using Junit. Please let me know if JUnit will be\n&gt; good enough for web application  testing(server code in java). Is it\n&gt; true that &quot;The JUnit code will be complex and hard to maintain. You\n&gt; will have to reproduce all of the interactions between code and user\n&gt; within the Junit test, which very quickly becomes complex. If all you\n&gt; are doing is testing one single entry point, then this could well\n&gt; work, but if you are testing multiple screens (a wizard or something\n&gt; like that), then it can quickly become fragile and unmanageable.&quot;?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I will be moving to watij if Junit is not good enough for web app\n&gt; testing. Suggestions cordially invited.\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt; Thanks and Regards\n&gt; Jyotirmoy Sundi\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
