I suppose we could start looking at a\ncustom Requ=\r\nest object that returns a runner that is never intended to\nbe used with the=\r\n @RunWith annotation, but rather delegates run\nbuilding on each class. But =\r\nI&#39;m not sure that IDEA or ant support a\ncustom Request object, or how you w=\r\nould get them to use it.\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, Malte Finsterwalder=\r\n &lt;malte@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; yme0987654321 wrote:\n&gt; &gt; In answer to your second q=\r\nuestion, basically the slow tests would run\n&gt; &gt; at check in, or during the =\r\ngeneral build process, whereas the fast\n&gt; &gt; test would just be part of the =\r\nTDD of making sure everything is green.\n&gt; &gt; For point of comparison, the sl=\r\now tests are currently 1/2 hour for\n&gt; &gt; less than 100, and the fast tests a=\r\nre under 60 seconds, even though\n&gt; &gt; there are about 700 of them.\n&gt; \n&gt; I un=\r\nderstand that reasoning.\n&gt; \n&gt; But as you said you want to have several cate=\r\ngories:\n&gt; DB-Tests, In Container Tests, ...\n&gt; Maybe you should create a run=\r\nner hat can be parameterized to handle all\n&gt; these cases?\n&gt; \n&gt; And how do y=\r\nou setup the runtime, so that it does run the tests or does\n&gt; not run the t=\r\nests on a per run basis?\n&gt; Setting a system property seams cumbersome to me=\r\n.\n&gt; That&#39;s ok for the server, but sometimes I want to run the slow tests on=\r\n\n&gt; my desktop too, don&#39;t I?\n&gt; \n&gt; Maybe we can come up with something better=\r\n?\n&gt; \n&gt; Greetings,\n&gt;    Malte\n&gt;\n\n\n\n",
