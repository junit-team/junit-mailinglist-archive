To use JUnit, \nyou need to separate the EJB into two parts: the plain Java part, and \nthe part that integrates with the EJB framework. See _JUnit Recipes_, \nchapter 11 for details.\n\n&gt; Another question is with respect to UI testing.\n&gt; We found that Httpunit consumes lot of effort in writing the black\n&gt; box tests for testing UI.\n\nWhat are three ways in which using HttpUnit consumes so much effort?\n\n&gt; We also foundthat Cactus is not that useful for testing UI as it\n&gt; cannot do the navigational testing, i.e. navigating from one screen\n&gt; to another.\n\nI find this surprising. If Vince Massol can read this, would you care to \ncomment?\n\nI have used HtmlUnit to test the user interface, but I have to tell you \nthat when I test a user interface, I test /only/ the user interface, and \nnot the entire application from end to end. You might be doing something \ndifferent. I find that testing the entire application from end to end \n/and/ trying to do exhaustive boundary checking is a formula for \ndisaster, so I use other techniques. Once again, see _JUnit Recipes_, \nchapters 12 and 13 for details.\n\nBest of luck.\n-- \nJ. B.
