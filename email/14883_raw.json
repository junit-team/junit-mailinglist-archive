File are \nsequences of bytes, nothing more. It&#39;s completely up to the program \nreading the file how to interpret it, including how to find any record \nboundaries in that file. Java does exactly what the program tells it to do.\n\n&gt; It&#39;s easy enough to cope with line boundaries when reading (modulo\n&gt; concerns about fancy file formats that the OS may have). The\n&gt; original niggle was what to do about them when /writing/, if one\n&gt; wants to generate text output in the local preferred convention\n&gt; and to have literal strings with line-separators in them. \n\nApplications should not be written to local conventions. Your program \nshould generate the same output whether it runs on a Mac, Windows, Unix, \nor something else. It rally doesn&#39;t matter whether you pick &#92;n, &#92;r, or \n&#92;r&#92;n; but pick one and be done with it. Don&#39;t change it just because the \nplatform changed. Otherwise you get into the trouble that started this \nwhole thread, where  a program that works on one system fails for no \napparent reason on another.\n\n-- \n﻿Elliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nXML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim\n\n",
