The test code and the class<br/>\nwhere the cast is made both exist in a default package.<br/>\n<br/>\n// example code:<br/>\n    my.Type a = Factory.instance( );<br/>\n   // we query on &quot;a&quot; and it prints out its type as &quot;my.Type&quot;, and the<br/>\nvalue is not null.<br/>\n    my.Type b = (my.Type) a;   // this line throws a class cast exception<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m guessing that the JUnit framework launches its own class loader and<br/>\nit&#39;s getting confused with some code existing in a default package.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes anyone have an idea of what is going on?  Does all code need to be<br/>\nfound in a named package?</div>",
