But, we are not <br/>\n&gt;testing EJBs currently as it would involve creating .ear file and <br/>\n&gt;testing. So, can anybody tell me what is the best way to test Entity, <br/>\n&gt;session and message beans and servlets? Is there anyway to test JSPs?<br/>\n&gt;Any samples/links provided will be much appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My coauthor and I will devote approximately 100 pages to this in our upcoming book. Please understand that we can&#39;t do it by tomorrow. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nSince you are testing code already written, my strong suggestion is to start by testing through the end-user interface or using a package like Cactus. Thorough and fast testing of EJBs requires a certain design approach that not many people take.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJ. B.
