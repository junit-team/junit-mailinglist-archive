The contract specifies what the class/method guarantees about its\nstate and output given entry state. Unit tests are a tangible form of that\nguarantee and are, in the end, what you can actually rely on to be\ncorrect. Design-By-Contract (provided by Eiffel, Java with iContract, or\nmethodical use of assertion constructs) adds the additional guarantee that\na call will not succeed if the contract is broken, making it much easier\nto locate problems.\n\nBrian Marrick makes the distinction between preconditions and checked\npreconditions. There are some conditions that are required for the\ncontract to hold but which the method either cannot check, cannot check\nefficiently, or simply elects not to check. In this case, the\nresults are usually given as &#39;undefined&#39;. Checked preconditions on\nthe other hand, can be expected to signal a particular error and generally\nto exit gracefully. Unit tests can and should verify that violations of\nchecked preconditions do, in fact, fail.\n\nOn Wed, 3 Apr 2002, David V. Olivier wrote:\n\n&gt; Right:\n&gt;\n&gt; - A formal contract can logically state classes of inputs and the\n&gt; corresponding results.\n&gt; - Unit tests can provide specific examples of inputs and results.\n&gt;\n&gt; The former can often be interpolated from the latter and for many purposes\n&gt; that is sufficient or even preferable.  However, as you say, there are\n&gt; probably scenarios in which the more explicit statement is useful.\n&gt;\n&gt; At 08:35 AM 4/3/2002 +0200, you wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Don&#39;t get me wrong I&#39;m a big fan of JUnit and unit testing but...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;...I do regularly have problems using components, which would not have\n&gt; &gt;occurred if there had been clearly stated pre-conditions (admittedly these\n&gt; &gt;components don&#39;t usually come with associated unit tests).\n&gt; &gt;Are a collection of unit tests a clear statement of the contract? I&#39;m not\n&gt; &gt;convinced. I do agree that by rigourously using TFD you will end up with\n&gt; &gt;classes/methods with sweet smelling contracts. However if we consider the\n&gt; &gt;airline metaphor which is often used for DBC: when I&#39;m booking a ticket\n&gt; &gt;with an airline I like to know the conditions which are attached - I don&#39;t\n&gt; &gt;merely  want a list of previous passengers and how they got on.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Steven Hale, wm-data\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; David Olivier\n&gt; Naval Research Laboratory\n&gt; Digital Mapping, Charting & Geodesy Analysis Program\n&gt; Code 7440.2\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
