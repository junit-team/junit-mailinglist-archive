Been side tracked at =\r\nwork and now I&#39;m back to this issue.  Did you still need me to create this =\r\nbug?  If so, where do I need to submit this?\n\nMy solution I believe was to =\r\nremove the timeout instead of doing each.get(2000, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS); =\r\n I changed the source locally to each.get(); and the exception disappeared.=\r\n\n\nI&#39;m not certain this this is the right solution as I&#39;m not completely fam=\r\niliar with the framework.  You may want a timeout feature but my feeling is=\r\n that it should somehow be configurable.  I would feel more comfortable if =\r\nyou or someone more experienced with this framework can make the fix.\n\nPlea=\r\nse let me know if 4.7 has this fix.\n\nThanks,\nMike\n\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroup=\r\ns.com, David Saff &lt;david@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Wow.

If you feel really motivated and are\n&gt; =\r\nskilled in git, feel free to submit a patch.

Is there a significant reason for this versus get()=\r\n without any timeout? In conducting test without JUnit test cases, I&#39;m find=\r\ning this timeout feature creates timeout exceptions whereas running JUnit w=\r\nithout the timeout allows my test to run successfully. Can anyone explain w=\r\nhy this timeout is needed?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --------------------------------=\r\n----\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
