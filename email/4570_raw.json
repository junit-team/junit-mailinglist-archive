Could\n&gt;&gt; you tell me how Unit Testing can be discussed without discussing \n&gt;&gt; its impact on design?\n&gt;\n&gt;I am sorry that I made myself misunderstood in this way.  What I\n&gt;intended to say was: lets make the discussion clear for those who\ndon&#39;t\n&gt;want to participate in/read the &#39;testing private methods&#39; thread, and\n&gt;move to a &#39;Testing & Design&#39; thread that brings the issue into better\n&gt;focus.  I see that my mistake was to omit &#39;private method&#39; when I\n&gt;mentioned separating Design and (private method) Unit testing.\n\nSeparate threads! Much different. I thought you meant &quot;go to another\ngroup and talk about this...&quot; No-one could argue against separate\nthreads -- it&#39;s just nicer to know that a message&#39;s contents match its\nsubject.\n\n&gt;What we could be saying then is:\n&gt;- to those who want to test private methods, use another tool\n&gt;- to those who want to learn about how testing can improve design,\nkeep\n&gt;on reading (this thread)\n&gt;\n&gt;The statements above are not mutually exclusive, and, therefore, can\nbe\n&gt;done in conjunction.\n\nNo argument can be made against such precise statements. Much clearer.\n\n&gt;Also, we could try to discover how many of this mailing list&#39;s readers\n&gt;would actually like to be able to test private methods (democracy?).\nIf\n&gt;we find this to be a respectable percentage, we could then proceed to\n&gt;find out whether they know of the benefits testing only public methods\n&gt;has on design.\n\nI admit that the general flow of discussion is:\n\nA: I want to test private methods.\nB: No, you don&#39;t. You want to change your design.\nA: No, I don&#39;t. I want to test private methods.\nB: But your design...\nA: Don&#39;t bore me with design! I have work to do!\n\nIt&#39;s easy to see how each side drifts further apart from the point.\nIt&#39;s the reason I&#39;ve stayed out of the discussion more and more lately,\nuntil my recent idea about how to word my position in a better way.\nThat idea was simply triggered by the most recent &quot;I want to test\nprivate methods.&quot;\n\n&gt;&gt; [...] JUnit was not built for that purpose. Not only that, its\n&gt;&gt; creators feel \n&gt;&gt; (well Kent, anyway; I don&#39;t know how Erich feels) that one of \n&gt;&gt; the strengths \n&gt;&gt; of JUnit is that when the tests become painful to write, \n&gt;&gt; there is a tendency \n&gt;&gt; for the design to have an organic weakness that prevents the \n&gt;&gt; testing. As \n&gt;&gt; Kent says in this case, it&#39;s an opportunity to learn about \n&gt;&gt; your design.\n&gt;\n&gt;I also know about Kent&#39;s position, and how much testing plays a part\nin\n&gt;how HE sees development practices should be undertaken (XP, TDD).\n\nWell, it&#39;s not just Kent. Sometimes people on this list say, &quot;I&#39;m not\nKent&quot; to dismiss Kent&#39;s ideas. It ain&#39;t just Kent. Many, many, many of\nus agree with Kent, share his experience and hold the common vision.\n\n&gt;&gt; If you are going to say, &quot;Take your testing/design\n&gt;&gt; discussions elsewhere,&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;I am *really* sorry if my post could be misconstrued in that manner!\n&gt;Once again, I believe I mentioned the fact that many an insight has\nbeen\n&gt;gained from these discussions.  Keep it up!\n\nI apologize for jumping to such a conclusion. Rather a shame that\nthat&#39;s the majority of exercise I get these days...\n\n&gt;&gt; It&#39;s all in how you define &quot;unit&quot;. To me, it&#39;s the exported\n&gt;&gt; methods of a \n&gt;&gt; class or interface. Kent and Erich may define it differently. \n&gt;&gt; Clearly, you \n&gt;&gt; define it differently. \n&gt;\n&gt;I was only voicing my opinion for the testing of private methods being\n&gt;as it is a popular request.  I myself believe in the benefits of\ntesting\n&gt;public methods only, and therefore have no need for that\nfunctionality.\n\nThen we agree. Nothing could be better. :)\n\n&gt;I would add that, since testing of private methods is such a popular\n&gt;request, JUnit&#39;s position on the matter should be clearly stated in\nthe\n&gt;documentation (README, index.html, FAQ, ...), and why (pointer to\n&gt;Testing & Design discussions).  [A quick search on Google revealed\nthat\n&gt;the only place private methods are mentioned on the junit.org site is\n&gt;where JUnitX is mentioned.]\n\nI would argue that JUnit is conspicuously silent on the matter, and\nwhat one doesn&#39;t say can say much. :) (OK, it&#39;s a stretch...)\n\n&gt;&gt; You folks can test private methods until your brain pops out,\n&gt;&gt; but just don&#39;t \n&gt;&gt; expect JUnit to do it out of the box. It was never designed \n&gt;&gt; for that. It was \n&gt;&gt; never designed for that *on purpose*. I don&#39;t know why that \n&gt;&gt; is such a big \n&gt;&gt; deal.\n&gt;\n&gt;And it isn&#39;t!\n\nSo let&#39;s get back to normal programming. (Pun intended.)\n\n&gt;I am just questioning whether *on purpose* is actually\n&gt;the reason, or whether it was never envisaged to be used that way.  \n\nKent could settle this question, if he reads this. I&#39;m interested to\nknow.\n\n\nJ. B. Rainsberger,\nPresident, Diaspar Software Services\nLet&#39;s write software that people understand.\nhttp://www.diasparsoftware.com/\n\n\n",
