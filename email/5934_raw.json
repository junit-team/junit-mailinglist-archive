My first\n&gt; inclination was to\n&gt; &gt; simply have Test Mentor test components implement the\n&gt; junit.framework.Test\n&gt; &gt; interface and then implement countTestCases() and run(TestResult). The\n&gt; &gt; problem I ran in to is that we don&#39;t compose tests by way of methods\n&gt; &gt; beginning with &#39;testxxx&#39;, as JUnit does. What would have made\n&gt; the job a lot\n&gt; &gt; easier would have been some method in the Test interface that\n&gt; is passed a\n&gt; &gt; test collector, such as collectTests(TestCollector), for example.\n&gt; [...]\n&gt;\n&gt; Doesn&#39;t the\n&gt; \tpublic static TestSuite suite()\n&gt; method solve this problem?  Certainly it has about the semantics\n&gt; you want -- &quot;give me the set of tests you consist of&quot;.\n\nGood suggestion and that would have worked for me if it was on the instance\nside. I would like to have a bunch of existing test classes in a hierarchy\ngenerically inherit the &quot;give me the set of tests you consist of&quot; behavior.\nIf I did it on the static side, I would require each existing and future\nclass in the hierarchy to implement a static suite() method, which would be\na big imposition on our existing customers, just on the off chance that they\nmight want to run their tests under JUnit.\n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nMike Silverstein\nSilverMark, Inc.\nThe object testing company\nhttp://www.javatesting.com\n\n\n",
