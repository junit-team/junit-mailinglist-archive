I just don&#39;t see why one would ever need 12 top-notch <br/>\nprogrammers in a two-week period. If it&#39;s to start a project, that&#39;s a <br/>\ntactical error: they will collide like crazy on such a small codebase, <br/>\nso ramp up the team. If it&#39;s to save a project, that&#39;s another tactical <br/>\nerror: too many new faces at once will just make the project slower. If <br/>\nyou need a surgical team to come in and save a project, you need to hire <br/>\na team already in place and not try to turn 12 top-notch programmers <br/>\ninto the team you need.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe point is to hire 1 top-notch programmer instead of 3-5 warm bodies. <br/>\nCost less, more value.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ.
