I liked the JUnit-<br/>\naddons solution, but there&#39;s a lot of red tape to bring new things <br/>\ninto this organization, even open source, so I didn&#39;t want to fight <br/>\nthat battle. What we wound up doing was creating an ANT script to <br/>\neffectively do the same thing that the JUnit-addons solution would <br/>\ndo, since ANT is already an accepted tool here. Thanks again!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nGreg Plummer</div>",
