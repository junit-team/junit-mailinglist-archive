We<br/>\nwill probably want to have more than one test for each, which will likely<br/>\nlead to a &quot;combinatorical explosion&quot; if we test all the four steps together.<br/>\nIt might also be less than easy to recreate a specific error condition for<br/>\nstep 4) by executing steps 1)-3), for example.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, of course, the decoupling leads to a design with which it&#39;s more easy<br/>\nto reuse single parts, or to replace them by others.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers, Ilja</div>",
