(Particularly since I&#39;m\ngoing to say the same thing as David and J.B. ;-)\n\nYou&#39;re thinking in terms that are too big.\n\nInstead of:\npublic void test_First_UP_Button_Pressed() {\nview.pressed(1, UP);\nassertTrue(firstDoor.isOpen());\n}\n\nJust:\npublic void test_First_UP_Button_Pressed() {\nassertEquals(0, model.activeButtonCount());\nmodel.press(1, Direction.UP);\nassertEquals(1, model.activeButtonCount());\nassertTrue(model.isPressed(1, Direction.UP));\n}\n\nNote that this is focused on the model rather than the view.\n\nThere are probably lots of things that you expect to happen between pressing\nthe UP and the door opening. Where is the elevator right now? Is the\nelevator on the first floor before the door opens?\n\nWhen you test the view parts, you&#39;ll probably have a view.isButtonActive(1,\nDirection.UP) since the button state should change once the elevator\narrives, right?\n\nWhen I started trying to do test-first, it was very hard to think in tiny\nsteps, but that&#39;s the way that it works best. I still wouldn&#39;t say that my\nTest-First behavior is a &quot;habit&quot; as I really have to think about it. Perhaps\none day it will feel natural, but I have to &quot;undo&quot; many, many years of\nCode-First, Test-Later development.\n\n-Rob\n\n\nOn 11/3/05, David Saff &lt;saff@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Isaac,\n&gt;\n&gt; J.B.&#39;s point is a good one--now that the code is written, concentrate on\n&gt; testing the non-UI model first. If we had to do it again, given just\n&gt; the test that you have written here, I could make it pass with\n&gt;\n&gt; class View {\n&gt; public void pressed(int floorNum, Direction direction) {\n&gt; // do nothing\n&gt; }\n&gt; }\n&gt;\n&gt; class Door {\n&gt; boolean isOpen() {\n&gt; return true;\n&gt; }\n&gt; }\n&gt;\n&gt; This probably looks like cheating. It has two advantages--I now have a\n&gt; working test suite (hooray!), and it helps me think of some more tests I\n&gt; should write. Perhaps I would next write a test that forces me to write\n&gt; code for pressed(), and then one that leads to a more interesting\n&gt; implementation of isOpen.\n&gt;\n&gt; David Saff\n&gt;\n&gt; isaachanstar wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m very sorry for that I forget this important thing. Here is my\n&gt; &gt; first testcast:\n&gt; &gt; ____________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; public void test_First_UP_Button_Pressed() {\n&gt; &gt; view.pressed(1, UP);\n&gt; &gt; assertTrue(firstDoor.isOpen());\n&gt; &gt; }\n&gt; &gt; ____________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; here &quot;view&quot; is the Swing GUI interface.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; to make it run, i create Elevator, Door, Button class, and then, i\n&gt; &gt; create ElevatorModel to hold them all,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; and then, i create ElevatorView interface (i think i must separate\n&gt; &gt; model and view), and then, i create a\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Mockview class, this class is my first nightmare, too many swing api\n&gt; &gt; trouble me a lot. And then, i think\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;simulate elevator&quot; should based on &quot;events&quot;, so i create\n&gt; &gt; ElevatorArrivedListen, ButtonPressedListener,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; and ElevatorArrivedEvent, ButtonPressedListener. And then, i review my\n&gt; &gt; program -- one testcase and more\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; then ten classes (interface).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; This is the descriptionof my program. Help gives me some advice, any\n&gt; &gt; sentence will help me, thanks.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n--\nRob Biedenharn\nPersonal: Rob_Biedenharn@...\nRob@...\n(C) 513-295-4739\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n\n",
