Right now we have only 8 test class and 8\n&gt; test data sets. But soon we&#39;ll have 50+ test classes and so we&#39;ll have\n&gt; 50+ test data sets. Recall that Spring Test performs a rollback after\n&gt; every test method, so there are no dependencies between tests.\n&gt;\n&gt; In your experience, is one data set per test *class* good enough? It&#39;s\n&gt; unclear from your narrative if you are suggesting one data set per test\n&gt; *method* or just avoiding/minimizing integration testing altogether in\n&gt; favor of unit testing.\n\nI err on the side of one data set to test (method), however if a handful \n(six?) of tests share a data set, I can live with that. As long as \nchanges in a data set don&#39;t lead to changes in seemingly irrelevant \ntests, I wouldn&#39;t worry too much.\n\nBear in mind that I have the style of making many little things, then \ncollecting them together, instead of making big things and breaking them \nup when they grow too big, so this might boil down to a style issue.\n\n&gt; I have found these DAO integration tests to be extremely helpful, given\n&gt; all the subtleties and magic surrounding Spring and Hibernate.\n\nHave you found much duplication in your integrated tests?\n-- \nJ.
