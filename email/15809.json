Do you think this would be a hangup often in scenarios you&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; &gt; seen?  How did you solve such problems in JUnit 3?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; As far as I can tell from the community, they didn&#39;t. (I never<br/>\n&gt; personally dealt with the problem.) That was one thing they didn&#39;t like<br/>\n&gt; about JUnit: running out of memory when constructing test suites.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There&#39;s at least two ways that one could handle this issue in JUnit 4 <br/>\nout of the box:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Write a Runner that returned a null plan, with a RunListener that <br/>\ndidn&#39;t care about the plan, such as the default command-line <br/>\nRunListener.  However, the current Eclipse runner would fall over if <br/>\ngiven such a request, as would the JUnit 3 forward compatibility layer.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Since all the Plan needs is a list of test names, just create a list <br/>\nof names that is easy to remember, and large enough to definitely cover <br/>\nthe data space, such as the numbers from 1 to 10000.  For example, use <br/>\nthe built-in Parameterized runner, with a Parameters method that returns <br/>\na Collection whose size() method is a hard-coded number, and a lazily <br/>\npopulated iterator().  If there turns out to be fewer elements than the <br/>\nPlan predicts, mark the remaining tests as ignored.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs one of the community members that had this running out of memory <br/>\nproblem still around on the list?
