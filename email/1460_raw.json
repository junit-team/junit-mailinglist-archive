Well said.  I\nlike the perspective of Smalltalk where default and protected access\nmodifiers don&#39;t exist for rational reasons.  I would only add these\npractical considerations, oblique, not contrary, to Jason&#39;s words:\n\n1. Code coverage analysis should be your guide in making decisions about\nwhether testing through public APIs provide thorough enough test coverage\n(80%? 95%?, depending on the quality you&#39;re shooting for and (relevant to\nthat) the industry you&#39;re in).  Naturally, coverage analysis will inform\nyour testing decisions, which in turn will likely inform your design\ndecisions.\n\n2. In the &quot;real world&quot; of non-ideal engineering situations, a QA team or\nengineer may well be tasked with, among other things, unit testing code or\nworking with a team of engineers who do not do unit testing and cannot be\nconvinced to do so.  In this case, the powerful benefit of the coding-unit\ntesting feedback loop is mostly lost and severely diluted, but the QA team\nmust do its best to test whatever craziness comes its way.  The values of\nunit testing are diminished, but by no means entirely, even if only the QA\nteam does it. Ditto for testing legacy systems over which one had no design\ncontrol for historical reasons.\n\nScott Stirling\nJRun QA\nMacromedia\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Jason Rogers [mailto:jason.rogers@...]\n&gt; Sent: Monday, June 11, 2001 5:18 PM\n&gt; To: &#39;junit@yahoogroups.com&#39;\n&gt; Subject: RE: [junit] Best Practice for Tests ?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks for the example in design issues... but that isn&#39;t \n&gt; what I was after.\n&gt; I should have been more clear, and I will be next time.\n&gt; \n&gt; The real issue of this sub-thread is in where to locate tests \n&gt; and why.  The\n&gt; original quote (paraphrased) was that &quot;we put tests in the \n&gt; same package as\n&gt; production code to make it easier to test protected interfaces of our\n&gt; objects.&quot;  I don&#39;t see where this fits in to good design or \n&gt; good testing\n&gt; practices.  The virtue of public/protected/private/default is \n&gt; not what I was\n&gt; questioning.  I wanted to point out the potential flaws of design and\n&gt; testing that could otherwise be missed when you put tests in the same\n&gt; package as production code.  The production code should be \n&gt; tested in the\n&gt; same fashion it would be used by a client.  A test is a client in some\n&gt; degree.  In most cases clients exist outside of the package.\n&gt; \n&gt; Someone (sorry, I forget who it was) brought up the fact that \n&gt; &quot;client&quot; is a\n&gt; loose term that can refer to objects outside my package \n&gt; domain as well as to\n&gt; objects within my package domain.  I do not disagree with \n&gt; that assertion.\n&gt; However, I believe that (in most cases) the public interface \n&gt; of any part of\n&gt; a system should be designed in such a way that when it is tested the\n&gt; programmer can be assured that he/she hasn&#39;t broken anything.  The\n&gt; package-scope clients usually have a public interface of \n&gt; their own which can\n&gt; then be tested separately from the classes they interact \n&gt; with.  Often times\n&gt; in a situation where objects use the protected &quot;inners&quot; \n&gt; (either variables or\n&gt; methods) of another object within their package there is some kind of\n&gt; heirarchical relationship where one object is a supporter of \n&gt; another.  Thus,\n&gt; I conclude, that testing the public interfaces of ALL objects \n&gt; (the key being\n&gt; ALL) should prove sufficient, thus not needing the tests to \n&gt; reside in the\n&gt; same package as their associated production code objects.  Of \n&gt; course, there\n&gt; are exceptions... we have ways around those.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Jason\n&gt; \n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Yishay Mor [mailto:ymor@...]\n&gt; Sent: Monday, June 11, 2001 5:57 PM\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: RE: [junit] Best Practice for Tests ?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I could, but that would cost you more then 2c  #:-)\n&gt; \n&gt; consider, as an example, the following pattern:\n&gt; \n&gt; abstract class A {\n&gt;         public void doSomeThingComplex() {\n&gt;                 // do some stuff\n&gt;                 :\n&gt;                 // call extender&#39;s code\n&gt;                 doSomeThingSimple();\n&gt;                 // do some more stuff\n&gt;                 :\n&gt;         }\n&gt; \n&gt;         protected abstract void doSomeThingSimple();\n&gt; }\n&gt; \n&gt; public class B extends A {\n&gt;         protected void doSomeThingSimple(){\n&gt;                 // do it\n&gt;         }\n&gt; }\n&gt; \n&gt; - but this is turning into a thread on Java design issues, \n&gt; maybe we should\n&gt; take it elsewhere.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yishay\n&gt;                         \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; At 04:07 PM 6/11/2001 -0400, you wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks for the quote.
