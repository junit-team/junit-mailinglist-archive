I did the google, as the paper doesn&#39;t appear to talk\nabout isolated tests at all.  (I skimmed, as my Smalltalk\nis null and void.)\n\nI did however read the PRIOR flamewar on here about\nheirarchical tests, which erupted over a similar issue,\nalthough not clearly dealing with an external stateful\nsystem.\n\nI respectfully disagree, but from your responses to that one,\nit&#39;s clear that we&#39;re going to disagree on this.\n\nWhen testing systems, I believe that tests should be clearly\nseperate, and you should test one piece of functionality at\na time.\n\nI actually implemented the storage system for this project\nusing test-first, and making each one of those individual\ntests pass, before moving to the next one.\n\nIf it had been one big test, I wouldn&#39;t have been able to\ndo that.  It would never have passed until the entire\nsystem, from front to back, worked completely.\n\nIn order to make that work, I had to use static variables\nin the class.  I thought that stunk, at first, but did it in\norder to make it all work, and be able to test parts of\nfunctionality as I built the system.\n\nWhen the time came to test multi-threaded, that smell\nbecame unbearable, and I hoped someone had a solution.\n\nI understand now that this is not something the test\nframework intended to address.\n\nMy apologies, I didn&#39;t intend to reignite what is apparently\na well-worn tread of flame.\n\nWe test differently, is all.\n\n--  Morgan Schweers\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;J.
