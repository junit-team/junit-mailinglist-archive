Cannot deliver without tests, so your delivery is bloated\n\nI don&#39;t belive that to be true but maybe I&#39;m missing something. In the\nfollowing code you can delete the Foo$Test.class file and the `java\nFoo` still works which means a `find src/ -name &#39;*$Test.class&#39; | xargs\nrm ` would remove the test cases from your final product.\n\npublic class Foo {\n Foo() {\n  System.out.println(&quot;Foo&quot;);\n }\n public static void main(String args[]) {\n  new Foo();\n }\n\n public static class Test {\n  Test() {\n   System.out.println(&quot;Foo.Test&quot;);\n   new Foo();\n  }\n  public static void main(String args[]) {\n   new Test();\n  }\n }\n}\n\n\n&gt; 2. Personally speaking, it clutters the class definition, making it\n&gt; more time consuming to navigate the file (yes, IDEs can help with \n&gt; this, but...)\nI agree it&#39;s desireable to keep source files smaller.\n\n&gt; 3. Automated suite generation is more difficult\nI have created a test ant build script with an junit task that matches\n&quot;*$Test&quot;.\n\n&gt; 4. Inner classes are member variables of the object;\nAre static inner classes actually a member variable or just an\nextension of the package namespace system. (I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m\ndescribing that correctly.)\n\n&gt; they usually do\n&gt; something for the object&#39;s functionality that the object doesn&#39;t\n&gt; want to do itself --&gt; Are your tests really extensions/helpers to \n&gt; your object&#39;s functionality?\nunderstood\n\n&gt; 5. Why not just put it in its own file?  It&#39;s just as easy and not\n&gt; at all hard to keep in sync.\nThat&#39;s seperate from what I&#39;m asking. \n\nThe inner class method keeps everything together which is appealing,\nthough it may not be logically consistant. I&#39;m curious where it breaks\ndown negativly.\n\n\n\n",
