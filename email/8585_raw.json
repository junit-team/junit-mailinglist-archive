However, I disagree with the statement - unless\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\nyou got something other than your own experience to back that statement\n&gt;up=\r\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;with.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;You disagree with what part: that it&#39;s a time waster or that=\r\n it&#39;s a &quot;top\n&gt;time waster&quot;?\n&gt;\n&gt;I disagree that it is &quot;a top time waster&quot; as=\r\n you stated.\n\nI can sink my teeth into this. Are you willing to name, say, =\r\nfive bigger time wasters, according to your experience? I&#39;m not trying to g=\r\nrill you, but I am interested in your perspective. I can learn from it.\n\n&gt;&gt;=\r\nAs for &quot;something other than your own experience to back that statement\n&gt;up=\r\n with&quot;, what on\n&gt;&gt;Earth is more important than one&#39;s experience?\n&gt;\n&gt;The exp=\r\nerience of a collective is more important than the myopic\n&gt;experience of an=\r\n individual.\n\nNo argument there. You can agree, though, that one&#39;s opinion =\r\nis shaped most by one&#39;s direct experience, in spite of what one may have re=\r\nad or heard.\n\n&gt;One person can only experience so much, thus\n&gt;we produce stu=\r\ndies and surveys and the like to draw upon the experience of\n&gt;many to under=\r\nstand things that might be anomalies. Do you have a survey,\n&gt;study, or anyt=\r\nhing else that I can take to my management so that we can\n&gt;improve our own =\r\nprocess other than &quot;some guy on a list says that\n&gt;documentation is a top ti=\r\nme waster&quot;\n\nNo, I don&#39;t; but then, giving you ammunition to take to your ma=\r\nnagement was not my objective in writing the foregoing, so it&#39;s reasonable =\r\nthat my response wouldn&#39;t factor that in, no?\n\nIncidentally, isn&#39;t a study =\r\nsimply what one guy did? My point is: when does it end? You can discredit o=\r\nr simply choose not to believe any study I might put before you. At some po=\r\nint, you choose either to believe or you don&#39;t. This is why I don&#39;t knock m=\r\nyself out looking for studies. I listen to stories (told campfire-style aro=\r\nund the bar at conferences) and I observe what happens around me. I find it=\r\n more authentic.\n\nTake care.\n\n\nJ. B.
