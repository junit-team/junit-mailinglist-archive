Or are we really only interested in the result<br/>\n&gt;  of the main method we&#39;re testing?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It depends on what your strategy is. I&#39;d advice against &quot;navigating&quot;<br/>\nwith mocks (in order to test this branch mockA.someFlag() needs to<br/>\nreturn 4711 and then it will go through this loop two times before so<br/>\nmockA.hasNext() must return true twice and then false. After that we<br/>\nsetup expectations on MockB and those are the ones we /really/ care<br/>\nabout).<br/>\n<br/>\nBasically, if you are /navigating/ to something that you care about.<br/>\nSee if you can structure your code so that you don&#39;t have to navigate.<br/>\nCan you extract that chunk of logic to a separate method or class. Do<br/>\nyou lack an abstraction?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is certainly not wrong to leave mocks out entirely. Lots of really<br/>\ngood TDD:ers do that so it&#39;s nothing to feel embarrassed about. I<br/>\npersonally think that mocks are handy since it gets painful so quickly<br/>\nwhen you&#39;re on the wrong track but that is just me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like this story about a team evolving:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://igorstoyanov.blogspot.com/2005/10/stubs-or-mocks-state-or-behavior_30.html\">http://igorstoyanov.blogspot.com/2005/10/stubs-or-mocks-state-or-behavior_30.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe a team has to go through that evolution? Maybe your team evolves<br/>\ndifferently? The important thing is to keep looking for and<br/>\nimplementing improvements.<br/>\n<br/>\n/J</div>",
