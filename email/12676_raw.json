The test thread then waits\nfor the receiving thread to notify it when the packets are received.\nThe test thread then gets the packets from the receiving thread.\n\nSo I want to only start the receiving thread once per testcase and not\nonce per test. Otherwise  I have multiple receiving threads trying to\nbind to the same socket. I also have difficulty stopping the receiving\nthread in tearDown because it is i/o blocked and even if I interrupt\nit, it does not terminate before the next test starts.\n\nThanks in advance\nMike\n\n\n\n\n\n",
