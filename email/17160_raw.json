The semantics of using a constructor also seem far more\n&gt; obvious to me as everyone reading my code knows Java, while not\n&gt; everyone is a JUnit guru.\n&gt; \n&gt; The additional complexity of having the (as far as I can tell)\n&gt; redundant setUp method seems counterproductive, so why does setUp exist?\n\nI find that &quot;setUp()&quot; reveals intent pretty well. Some people have \ndifficulty with the idea of storing fixture objects in fields, as they \nincorrectly think that they can write to those fields from one test and \nread those values from the next test. For this reason, I find that when \nI explain how to refactor code out of tests into the setUp() method, \npeople understand the concepts more easily.\n\nIt&#39;s also worth noting that in NUnit, for example, test case instances \nare pooled, so initializing in the constructor does not behave as you \nmight expect. There&#39;s nothing in the contract of the JUnit test case \nthat guarantees that instances are not pooled, so JUnit 5.0, for \nexample, could decide to pool instances of test case. At that point, \nyou&#39;d have to change your code.\n\nI hope that sheds some light on the matter.\n-- \nJ. B.
