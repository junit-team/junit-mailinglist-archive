I connect to a data provider via an IP address. They have<br/>\n&gt; provided an API which I implement, and get callbacks from them with<br/>\n&gt; the data. I can create a mock of one of their classes - but since<br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s not hooked up to their IP, there&#39;s no data in it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I suppose I could decompile their class and put some data in it - but<br/>\n&gt; at that point, am I really testing my interaction with their classes -<br/>\n&gt; or with one of my own munging?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks for any suggestions.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If you have access to /good/ documentation that /clearly/ describes the <br/>\nbehavior behind their API, then you can try simulating it and see how it <br/>\ngoes.<br/>\n<br/>\nAn alternative is to write simple Learning Tests against their (live) <br/>\nAPI, then use that information to program your mocks.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt might be worth mocking one level further up, abstraction-wise. Then <br/>\nyou can test-drive an implementation of your own API that hides all the <br/>\ncomplicated callback stuff, that connects to a live one of whatever they <br/>\nhave, but not have to test your business logic against their <br/>\ninfrastructure component. Without more specific information, I can&#39;t <br/>\nmake a clearer suggestion. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
