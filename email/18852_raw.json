Payments\nrange from very small (e.g. $0.01 for deciding if =\r\na photo is a good)\nto more substantial (e.g. $10.00 for transcribing a podc=\r\nast).\n\nMy first HIT (that stands for Human Intelligence Tasks - Amazon&#39;s\nte=\r\nrminology) is to ask someone to create a JUnit test that provides\n100% stat=\r\nement and conditional coverage for a trivial Java class. I am\noffering $1.1=\r\n1 for each test that meets the coverage criteria.\n\nNOTE:  I am not allowing=\r\n people to use JUnit Factory to automatically\ngenerate the tests since we a=\r\nlready know what those tests look like.\n\nIf you want to have fun with this,=\r\n I suggest you move quickly because\nAmazon.com makes it rather cumbersome t=\r\no transfer funds to pay for\nHITs, so I only have $10 available right now, a=\r\nnd until I can put more\nmoney into it, there are only a few hits I can pay =\r\nfor.\n\nTo &quot;play&quot; along just go to:\n\nhttp://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome\n\nand =\r\nsearch for hits containing the keyword: &quot;junit&quot;.\n\nAgain, this is just for f=\r\nun at this point...\n\n\nAlberto\n\n----------\nhttp://www.junitfactory.com\nSend =\r\nit Java.  Get back JUnit.\n100% free and 100% experimental.\n\n\n\n\n",
