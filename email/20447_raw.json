How would I do so without having to =\r\nduplicate the test \nclass\n&gt; (such that each copy has a different RunWith an=\r\nnotation)?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have bee=\r\nn removed]\n&gt;\n\nI would create an interface for the runners. Then at run-time=\r\n, \ninstantiate the particular runner that you want to run the test class \nu=\r\nnder. Actually I am currently working on something similar. \nInterfacing al=\r\nlows you to hide your multiple runners and it makes you \nrun your test clas=\r\ns from a single point. You choose which runner to \nrun your test class at r=\r\nun time when you instantiate the runner.\n\n\n",
