But we shouldn&#39;t\nbe fixing java.lang in junit.\n\n--- In junit@yaho=\r\nogroups.com, &quot;David Saff&quot; &lt;saff@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; All,\n&gt; \n&gt; Kent and I contin=\r\nue to try to fine-tune equality to produce the least\n&gt; surprise, and contin=\r\nue to wonder if well enough should have been left\n&gt; alone.  In 4.3, we intr=\r\noduced some run-time math magic to make up for\n&gt; the lack of type-expansion=\r\n once we had removed most of the primitive\n&gt; type assertEquals methods.  Th=\r\nus, it became the case, somewhat\n&gt; accidentally, that this would pass:\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n assertEquals(new Integer(1), new Long(1));  // A\n&gt; \n&gt; However, it simultan=\r\neously became the case that this would also pass:\n&gt; \n&gt; assertEquals(new Big=\r\nDecimal(&quot;1.0&quot;), new BigDecimal(&quot;1.1&quot;));  // B\n&gt; \n&gt; Line B should certainly =\r\nfail.  The simplest thing to do is to remove\n&gt; our math magic, introduce as=\r\nsertEquals(long, long), etc, and let\n&gt; numerical classes define their own e=\r\nquality.  This means that line A\n&gt; will now fail, since that&#39;s how Integer.=\r\nequals() is defined.  This is\n&gt; a small behavior change, but a &quot;regression&quot;=\r\n of sorts.\n&gt; \n&gt; If anyone believes this is a damaging decision, please let =\r\nme know.\n&gt; \n&gt;    David Saff\n&gt;\n\n\n\n",
