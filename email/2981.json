When I run under <br/>\njunit, it can&#39;t find some org.xml classes.  When I run standalone I <br/>\nhave no problems.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf anyone knows why, I&#39;d love to find out.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In junit@y..., Anthony  Pereira &lt;apereira@3...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Hi, <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m not sure whether this is the place to submit what I&#39;m just <br/>\ngoing to<br/>\n&gt; write about, if not please do point me in the right direction, <br/>\ncheers.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I came across a rather bizzare scenario, today using the<br/>\n&gt; junit.swingui.TestRunner in a java 1.4beta2 environment. In some of <br/>\nmy code,<br/>\n&gt; I reference classes in org.w3c.dom and org.apache.crimson. Now, as <br/>\nsoon as<br/>\n&gt; junit came across classes from these packages, it threw class not <br/>\nfound<br/>\n&gt; exceptions. Please note that this doesn&#39;t happen in the the textui <br/>\nnor my<br/>\n&gt; own testing classes, since they are both in the classpath.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; org.w3c.dom specifically is in the rt.jar<br/>\n&gt; org.apache.crimson is a separate jar, which is on my classpath<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; After a bit of digging around in the source code, specifically in <br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; TestCaseClassLoader, I found out about the <br/>\njunit&#92;runner&#92;exclude.properties<br/>\n&gt; file. When I added these package names to that file, things seemed <br/>\nok, and<br/>\n&gt; those exceptions didn&#39;t take place.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What confused me was why it didn&#39;t find the classes, even though <br/>\nthey was on<br/>\n&gt; my classpath, especially the org.w3c ones which are in the rt.jar <br/>\n(with<br/>\n&gt; 1.4). Furthermore, this was only a problem when using the swingui, <br/>\nwith the<br/>\n&gt; textui, it was fine.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve got it working now that I put those details in the <br/>\nexclude.properties<br/>\n&gt; file. Is this perhaps a issue with using 1.4?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Any comments or explainations?<br/>\n&gt; Thanks<br/>\n&gt; Anthony </span></blockquote></div>",
