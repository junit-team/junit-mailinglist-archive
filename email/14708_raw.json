How would you feel about making &quot;private&quot; just a\n&gt; suggestion? i.e. why not allow anyone to invoke any private method from\n&gt; any class they want to? Of course, they would know when doing this that\n&gt; they were doing something skanky. Would you be happy with such a\n&gt; language? If not, why not? And why is a naming convention good enough to\n&gt; keep packages and classes unpublished if it&#39;s not good enough to keep\n&gt; methods unpublished?\n&gt; \n&gt; If you think the private keyword should be just a suggestion, then I\n&gt; think we will just have to agree to disagree at this point. But if you\n&gt; don&#39;t think private is unnecessary, then I think there&#39;s a contradiction\n&gt; in your philosophy that&#39;s worth exploring further.\n\nI think Smalltalk does this. If you want to mark methods private, you \nput them in a protocol that suggests they shouldn&#39;t be used directly. I \ndon&#39;t have experience with the resulting code or the people that use it, \nbut I notice that much good Smalltalk (really good, tested Smalltalk) \nhas been written.\n-- \nJ. B.
