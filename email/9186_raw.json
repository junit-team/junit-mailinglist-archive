I&#39;ve seen this too.  I call them &quot;riveters&quot; since I&#39;ve been reading a b=\r\nook on the design and construction of the Empire State Building and the ana=\r\nlogy seems apt.  The riveters don&#39;t design or do anything sophisticated -- =\r\nthey just rivet together the beams that you tell them to.\n \n&gt; In my current=\r\n project, we don&#39;t even have any dedicated QA people; the\n&gt; programmers the=\r\nmselves are responsible for doing all of the \n&gt; QA. We ended up with a very=\r\n heavily automated solution, one we never \n&gt; could have had without QA staf=\r\nf who were programmers to the point that \n&gt; they could change our software =\r\ninternals to make it more testable.\n\nSounds cool.\n\nScott Stirling\nFramingha=\r\nm, MA\n\n",
