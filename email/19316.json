You will probably<br/>\nfind these somewhere online (because I am pretty sure somebody with more<br/>\nwritting skills have already published it). So, I will just say that my<br/>\npersonal ranking is EasyMock 2.x (clean API, clean design, legibility, but<br/>\nit works only on VM &gt;= 1.5), EasyMock 1.x (not so clean API, still clean<br/>\ndesign, legibility), JMock 1.x and JMock 2.x (this one is imo a mess: they<br/>\nmoved from string-based method invocation to more static approach, but they<br/>\nhave completely screwed the API). However, as I said, this is my personal<br/>\nopinion :-).<br/>\n<br/>\nbests,<br/>\n<br/>\n./alex<br/>\n--<br/>\n.w( the_mindstorm )p.<br/>\n  TestNG co-founder<br/>\nEclipseTestNG Creator<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 5/2/07, James Abley &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:james.abley@...\">james.abley@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Hi all,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m looking to use a Mock framework.
