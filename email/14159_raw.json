You might be able to use a bytecode\n&gt; generation tool like jMock with CGLib to create mocks of classes,\n&gt; though it&#39;s almost always easier to build off an interface.\n\nThis is going to be a problem for me. There is not direct interface\nfor the third party library. I have thought of direct inheritance but\nnot sure if it is a good idea. Using JMock and CGLib for bytecode\ngeneration required some time to implement. Unfortunately, I don&#39;t\nhave the time now. Probably after my tight deadline then I will look\ninto it. Could you elaborate a little bit how you would approach this\nproblem using JMock and CGLib?\n\nThe good news is I am using Spring Framework in my application. I\ncould use dependency injection to inject the third party classs into\nmy class. If I don&#39;t have the interface for the third party, Spring\nwould still inject the implementation class for me using CGLib instead\nof dynamic proxy, right?\n\nThank you for your help and the book information.\n\nRegards,\nLee\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
