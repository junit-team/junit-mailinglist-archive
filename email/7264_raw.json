Since we currently have more than 500 test cases it is \n&gt; difficult to do this manually. It would of course be easy if the \n&gt; normal success rate was 100%, but a number of test cases fail since \n&gt; the implementation is not yet completed.\n\nFunny I discussed that with Bill Venners a few days ago.\n\nYour problem is that not all of your tests pass.  So my question is: how can a\ndeveloper be sure that he didn&#39;t introduce a bug with some new code?  X tests\nwere failing before the modification and now Y tests are failing.  If Y&gt;X you\ndon&#39;t know which one is/are now failing.\n\nIMO opinion (and in your case) you have two kinds of failing tests:\n- the one that shouldn&#39;t\n- the one that will, and it&#39;s ok (testing not implemented features, not\nimplemented tests)\n\nJUnit doesn&#39;t directly give you the possibility to separate the &quot;good&quot; from the\n&quot;bad&quot; failing tests.  You have to come up with your own solution.\n\nWhat I would do:\n- rename the tests that should fail testXYZ_failing\n- rewrite some JUnit components (it depends what kind of runner you&#39;re using\n(ant, swing, textui) to filter these tests\n- or write an XSLT file to process the XML and remove the &#39;_failing&#39; methods\nfrom the report\n\n-Vladimir\n\n-- \nVladimir R.
