I don&#39;t like reflection either. <br/>\nMy continued belief is that classes should be tested through their <br/>\npublic interfaces. I&#39;ve elucidated the reasons here in the past. Rather <br/>\nthan reiterating them here, perhaps it&#39;s time to write up something a <br/>\nlittle more formal on my blog so I can just point to it in the future.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I like reflection, but after bingeing on it when I was young and foolish <br/>\n&gt; I now tend to avoid it. I&#39;m uncomfortable using reflection and fiddling <br/>\n&gt; with run-time modifiers solely for the purposes of calling a private <br/>\n&gt; method from a test case.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I completely agree.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; As I originally stated (and elaborated upon by Joakim), I would suggest <br/>\n&gt; instead analysing exactly _why_ the private method needs testing. If it <br/>\n&gt; is sufficiently important to require a test case, does its functionality <br/>\n&gt; merit a change in access modifier? Is its behaviour sufficiently <br/>\n&gt; different to that of the parent class that an extraction to a public <br/>\n&gt; helper class might be possible?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If the behavior is general enough that you want it to be public *for <br/>\nreasons other than testing* then by all means, go ahead and make it <br/>\npublic. But don&#39;t let the tail wag the dog. If the only reason you want <br/>\nit public is for testing, then use the public interface instead.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n﻿Elliotte Rusty Harold  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:elharo@...\">elharo@...</a><br/>\nJava I/O 2nd Edition Just Published!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafeaulait.org/books/javaio2/\">http://www.cafeaulait.org/books/javaio2/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596527500/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/\">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596527500/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/</a></div>",
