Some of the other <br/>\nframeworks (utPLSQL, for example) already do this, but TextRunner <br/>\nseems to output next to nothing.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs there some setting or addon that we can use to have this <br/>\ninformation output as well? (Short of modifying the Assert class, of <br/>\ncourse.)<br/>\n<br/>\n(I know there is discussion about whether such output has value. The <br/>\nenvironment I&#39;m working in requires FDA-specified validation, and at <br/>\nleast the values being compared have to be reviewed by a human being <br/>\nbefore a final approval signature can be applied. Therefore, a <br/>\nsimple &quot;OK&quot; is insufficient to to pass review.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you for your insight!<br/>\n<br/>\nJeff</div>",
