Having quite figured it out on the\n&gt; &gt;assertEquals, but on the assertTrue I us something like this this:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;assertTrue(!image.isChild());\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Robert DiFalco &lt;rdifalco@t...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;Yeah, it is a little odd. We have an AbstractTestCase and we just added\n&gt; &gt;the two version of #assertNotEquals there. We also added an\n&gt; &gt;#assertEqualsSameHash which makes sure that if two objects are equal,\n&gt; &gt;that their hashes are also equal.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hmm... maybe you wanted something like GSBase&#39;s EqualsTester,\ninstead. Tests that use assertEquals() must assume that equals()\nworks. If you want to test equals(), that ought to be done separately.\nYou have some subtle test coupling there that could lead you to forget\nthat equals()/hashCode() *may not* work.\n&gt; \n&gt; Take care.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; J.

There is assertNull(); there is\nassertNotNull().  There is assertEquals(), there ought to be\nassertNotEquals().  Simple as that.\n\nYes, I know it can be worked around : assertFalse(a.equals(b));\nBut that&#39;s a wart.\n\nAnd yes, I know that equals doesn&#39;t always work().  I spun my head\nover that one a few days ago (actually, equals() in this case did work\nbut I had come to the conclusion that it didn&#39;t - a long story I won&#39;t\ngo into here) - but if this is a serious problem, it&#39;s a problem\nwhether or not assertNotEquals() exists.\n\nAnd while I could go out and get third party extensions, I prefer to\nstick with the published regular distribution, warts and all.\n\nI had always assumed that the JUnit developers had some strong reason\nfor overlooking such an obvious thing.  But maybe not.  If not, please\nconsider adding assertNotEquals for the next release.\n\n\n\n",
