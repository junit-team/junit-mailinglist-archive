We&#39;re looking to incrementally start<br/>\n&gt; tagging our hundreds of test methods with attributes to control<br/>\n&gt; whether they&#39;re run or not, and provide a Filter implementation to do<br/>\n&gt; the selection logic.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I haven&#39;t found much documentation on using the<br/>\n&gt; org.junit.runner.manipulation.Filter class; it seems to be very much<br/>\n&gt; something applied to a Runner or Request instance, not a property of<br/>\n&gt; the test suite itself.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Since we have a large investment in organizing tests using a number of<br/>\n&gt; classes exposing a suite() method (JUnit3), it seems I want to use the<br/>\n&gt; JUnit4TestAdapter class, but once instantiated from within a suite()<br/>\n&gt; method, calling setFilter() on it has no effect. It seems that I need<br/>\n&gt; to convince the runner itself (which could be Eclipse, Ant, etc...) to<br/>\n&gt; call filter(), so unless there&#39;s something I&#39;m misunderstanding, I<br/>\n&gt; can&#39;t go down this path.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; A second approach that seems like it would work would be to use an<br/>\n&gt; @RunsWith annotation to set the org.junit.runners.Suite runner to run<br/>\n&gt; a suite crafted to replicate the organization we&#39;re doing today with<br/>\n&gt; suite() methods. I&#39;ve been able to apply a Filter from within my own<br/>\n&gt; Runner implementation (subclassing BlockJUnit4ClassRunner), but I<br/>\n&gt; can&#39;t see a way to apply a Filter if I&#39;m using the Suite runner.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Any ideas?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Jean-Philippe<br/>\n&gt; Ottawa, Canada<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>",
