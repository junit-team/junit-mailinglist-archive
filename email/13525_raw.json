B. Rainsberger&quot; &lt;jbrains@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;  &gt; No, I had lost the context of the discussion. I\n&gt;  &gt; would use DbUnit or the\n&gt;  &gt; ORM, whichever was simpler. In your case, I&#39;d use\n&gt;  &gt; the ORM.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; But, even better, I&#39;d use a fake (not a mock!) Data\n&gt;  &gt; Repository layer\n&gt;  &gt; when testing Business Logic without worrying about\n&gt;  &gt; where in particular\n&gt;  &gt; the data comes from.\n&gt; \n&gt; I agree. But what do you tell about integration\n&gt; testing? Some bugs will never show up if only mock\n&gt; objects are used. How do you catch them? Chapter 13\n&gt; doesn&#39;t seem to address our needs for integration\n&gt; testing.\n\nIt&#39;s true that we need Collaboration Tests (end-to-end, integration, \nwhatever size they are) to find some defects, but that doesn&#39;t mean we \nought to rely on them.\n\nI recently added a little description of my approach to \nc2.com/cgi/wiki?AbstractTestCases, but I need to write more about it. \nSomeday.\n\n&gt; You only mention FIT very shortly in your book. Is\n&gt; this the ultimate solution for integration testing?\n\nNo, because there is no such thing.\n\nFit is an excellent way to write customer-facing tests as well as \ndata-driven programmer tests.\n\n&gt; What do you think about TestNG? I see that you don&#39;t\n&gt; mention it in your book.\n\nI have never used TestNG; however, based on what I have seen, read and \nwhat Cedric has told me, I would use TestNG mostly to add tests to \nLegacy Code (any code I&#39;m afraid to change) when TestNG&#39;s \nintegration-test-related features would be useful. I would generally \nlook for ways to refactor the codebase to be able to use Isolation Tests \n(one object at a time) most of the time.\n\n&gt; What do you say about test dependencies? In your book\n&gt; I only found a solution for ensuring that the tests\n&gt; are executed in a special order. But what about &quot;skip\n&gt; test y if test x failed&quot;? It reminds me of our batch\n&gt; programs: run batch y (which depends on results of\n&gt; batch x) only if batch x succeeded. Is there an addon\n&gt; for this for JUnit or a small and simple solution? Or\n&gt; should it not be done? In a way I agree with the\n&gt; author of TestNG that it would be nice to see 1 test\n&gt; passed, 1 test failed, 24 tests skipped instead of 1\n&gt; test passed and 25 tests failed.\n\nThis is one reason I&#39;d use TestNG, but as an intermediate solution. Test \ninterdependence is a design smell as well as making \ntesting-as-fault-finding less effective/more annoying. I would want to \nrefactor away from interdependent tests, then decide whether those tests \nneed to move from TestNG to JUnit. From what I can tell, probably not.\n-- \nJ. B.
