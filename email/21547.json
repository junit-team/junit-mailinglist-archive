Question, however: is it that often that you are editing<br/>\njust the grouping of test suites, and not the contents of the tests<br/>\nthemselves?  I go through periods of reorganization (like you are),<br/>\nbut I find that the steady-state is that I&#39;m already editing my Java<br/>\nmuch more often than my XML.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; One advantage of ant is that you can fail fast, deciding that<br/>\n&gt;&gt; if suite A fails, don&#39;t even bother running suite B.  Also,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; sometimes the build system or political structure of a team can<br/>\n&gt;&gt; make it easier to edit XML files than Java, in which case the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; ant file might make sense.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Some details on the environment:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; * Rather small project and team (3-4 active developers,<br/>\n&gt; including myself),<br/>\n&gt; * Rather vanilla J2EE web application (Struts-based web gui and<br/>\n&gt; Hibernate+RDBMS backend)<br/>\n&gt; * Rather mature development stage<br/>\n&gt; * All main activities (development, deployment and testing) are<br/>\n&gt; performed entirely with the IDE (Eclipse)<br/>\n&gt; * Currently lacking an automated testing/build environment (i.e.<br/>\n&gt; everything is done manually)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; could these be of any help in making a decision (or in finding a<br/>\n&gt; tradeoff)...?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>A bit of a tangent: does the package structure follow the logical<br/>\nclumping of tests?  If so, then a globbing solution like ant&#39;s junit<br/>\ntask or the CpSuite runner for JUnit 4 could be a low-cost solution.<br/>\n<br/>\n   David Saff</div>",
