I never ran appfuse but I guess I should give it a go if\nit has good testing. What I did notice is Spring had something around 3000+\ntests that varied from testing 0 classes to testing 100+ classes so I guess\nyou got a lot of different tests to look at there. Then ant also has 1000+\ntests and so on. Most I ran had around 500+ and for example velocity I think\nwas around 50 or so. Spring also runs those tests relatively fast and good\nwith little effort needed from someone who doesnt know it (that is not too\ntricky db setups etc) so I guess its ok. But I think it all depends on you\ndefinition of best practices and stuff. I dont think its too simple but I\nguess it might be im just too complicated myself :o. Also for learning\npurposes it depends who is doing the learning, in what context and with what\nbackground and lots of other stuff. If you can define what you want to see\nin it maybe it will be easier to suggest something.\n\nps since you all are going to ask what an earth is a test that tests 0\nclasses, well according to the source comments it is an empty test case\nneeded to make eclipse test runner run some tests created using inheritance\nhierarchies and so on...:)\n\n-t\n\n2006/2/15, frank zou &lt;frankz1998@...&gt;:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi all,\n&gt;\n&gt; Lots of open-source projects are using TDD/Unit Testing. Do you have\n&gt; any ideas of which project(s) could be used to learn the &quot;BEST\n&gt; PRACTICES&quot; of using Unit Testing ?\n&gt;\n&gt; e.g, someone said &quot;AppFuse&quot; is cool for this purpose. Any comments and\n&gt; / or other projects ?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; - Frank\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n \nYahoo! Groups Links\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n",
