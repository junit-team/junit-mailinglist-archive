If yes, I would look at providing=\r\n patches and if not, I&#39;ll find an other way to waste my time ;-)\n\n- Forking=\r\nVMTestRunner\na runner executing the unit tests in a forked virtual machine =\r\nallowing to test effect of command line JVM switches for instance\n\n- Parral=\r\nlelRunner\nJUnit already contains nearly the whole code for that but not ava=\r\nilable as runner running tests in parallel\n\n- ParameterizedRunner\na runner =\r\nfar more flexible than JUnit&#39;s Parameterized runner allowing to configure u=\r\nsage per method (a bit like TestNG) and for different types\n\n- @NotYetImple=\r\nmented\nthis is an annotation allowing to indicate that a unit test is expec=\r\nted to fail. A failure should be reported as success whereas a success shou=\r\nld be reported as failure. This has proven to be far more interesting than =\r\n@Ignore which is just a little better than removing a test: @NotYetImplemen=\r\nted allows to write tests for &quot;accepted&quot; bugs or future features and to get=\r\n notified when they are fixed as side effect of other changes\n\n- assertEqua=\r\nls & IDE integration\nsmall improvement to throw ComparisonFailure not only =\r\nfor String comparison what allows IDE like Eclipse to better display differ=\r\nences between expected and actual result.\n\nCheers,\nMarc.\n\n\n",
