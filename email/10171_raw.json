Can we generate the test cases automatically using JUnit. I think at least for the first time we are\n&gt; &gt; supposed to write the first set of test cases manually. I know to write the test cases manually but how\n&gt; &gt; can we generate the test cases automatically from the first set of manual ones?\n&gt; \n&gt; Please give an example of some tests that you would want to generate\n&gt; automatically and tell us what you would get if you could do that.\n \nAs author of JUnitDoclet (the tool, Rick was kind enough to suggest) I&#39;d like offer my two cents.\n\nIMHO we should not depend on a generator to tell us how to test. After all, we test to understand what we are developing, right? If generating ALL the tests would be \npossible, how about generating the application in the first place?\n\nBut a generator can do things for us to make writing tests easy: it can generate a skeleton for the tests (test methods, TestCases, TestSuites) and keep it up to date as \nrefactoring is changing our application. That&#39;s what JUnitDoclet does. Writing the assert* statements (the meat) is up to us developers. We know, what the program should \ndo / or we learn just that by thinking about tests. And we should be able to extend generated test by manually written ones.\n\nWould we tests accessor methods? Probably not. But didn&#39;t we all had copy/paste/errors with accessors (like a method getFirstName returning surName)? JUnitDoclet is \nlooking for accessor pairs (with set/get/is) and is generating type depending tests for them. The developer doesn&#39;t have to do anything here, but now tests can find those \nstupid errors right away.\n\nAn example can be found here (click on step 1 to 6):\n  http://www.junitdoclet.org/demo.html\n\n \nKind Regards,\n\nSteffen Gemkow\n--\nObjectFab GmbH\nwww.objectfab.de\n\n\n",
