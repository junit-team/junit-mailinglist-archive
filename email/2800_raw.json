Over time, it\nseems that JUnitX and JUnit have grown more different.  What I was wondering\nwas:\n\n1. Does JUnit support access to private/protected?   It doesn&#39;t seem like it\nfrom the latest Javadoc but I could be wrong.\n2. Were there or are there plans for merging the features and interfaces of\nthese two versions?\n\nThanks!\nnoah\n\n\n\nNoah Green\nSoftware Engineering Manager\nThinAirApps, Inc.\n(212) 343-5032\nnoah.green@...\n\nThis message and any appended documentation is intended only for the use of\nthe intended recipient(s) and is proprietary and confidential to\nThinAirApps, Inc. and may not be disclosed to third parties without the\nprior written permission of ThinAirApps, Inc.
