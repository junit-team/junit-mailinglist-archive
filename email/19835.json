I believe that mixing languages<br/>\nrather than switching completely from one language to another is going<br/>\nto be more and more important. As I explored the subject i found<br/>\nmyself lacking some tools. I was frustrated by the fact that I had to<br/>\nmaintain two sets of tests and look for feedback in two different<br/>\nlocations while developing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI created a custom runner for JUnit to address the subject and I think<br/>\nit looks promising. I created a blog entry with some more details in<br/>\ncase anyone is interested:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://johlrogge.wordpress.com/2007/09/08/hybrid-theory/\">http://johlrogge.wordpress.com/2007/09/08/hybrid-theory/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI have some loose plans on open-sourcing this but I would like to see<br/>\nif there are others than me that find this interesting enough to be<br/>\nworth the effort before I do.<br/>\n<br/>\n/Joakim Ohlrogge</div>",
