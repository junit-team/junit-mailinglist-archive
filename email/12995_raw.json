It performs some\noperation on a list which is to be tested and I assume &quot;MyClass&quot; has\nother responsibilities too. This is what I would do in this situation:\n* Create a wrapper class around the list which performs all the\noperations on the list(as the list has some logic based on which\ncertain operations are performed on it, and you want to test that logic). \n* Make this wrapper class package protected as this is going to be\nused only in your &quot;MyClass&quot;. \n* Write a test for your wrapper class and place your test class in the\nsame package. All operations(methods) in there wrapper class will be\npublic or package protected and there are no issues with preotected\nmethods.\n\nSumukh\n\n&gt; Maybe I misread Ty, but it sounds like he was implying that it was\n&gt; necessary to decide why you even needed a protected class - not that\n&gt; it should not be tested. Just that it should probably not be\n&gt; protected.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Chip\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Mon, 28 Feb 2005 22:08:43 -0000, Matthew Metlis\n&gt; &lt;matthew.metlis@j...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I have to disagree.

Make the protected methods\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; public.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (c) ensure the methods are package-visible (isn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that anyways\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     the case for protected?). Put the test class in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the same\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     package.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (d) (c), but keep the test classes elsewhere in the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; filesystem\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     tree.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (e) (c) or (d), except it&#39;s not the test classes\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that share the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     package, but a relay class.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (f) Have the test classes define and use a subclass\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     class with protected methods. In that test\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; class, add\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     public method(s) that delegate to the protected\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; method(s).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (g) Use reflection: look into a mirror and say &quot;you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; don&#39;t need\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     to use reflection. That would be a mistake.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Chris &quot;electric hedgehog&quot; Dollin\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; __________________________________\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yahoo!
