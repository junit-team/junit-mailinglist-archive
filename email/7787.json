Some classes in our code might have <br/>\norder dependent methods by mistake. Those methods might behave <br/>\ncorrectly in a normal order, but in other conditions bug will <br/>\nsurface. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, Tung Wai Yip &lt;tungwaiyip@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; I wrote a testCreate to create and verify a record.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Then testUpdate to update and verify the record created in <br/>\ntestCreate.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Finally the testDelete to test delete the record created in <br/>\ntestCreate.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The thress test cases comprise of a suite of test for the <br/>\npersistence of one<br/>\n&gt; kind of record. This contradicts with the idea that each test case <br/>\nshould be<br/>\n&gt; independent. On the other hand the test cases are easy to write and <br/>\nI&#39;m happy<br/>\n&gt; with the result. I wonder if there is any convincing reason to <br/>\nwrite a complex<br/>\n&gt; test case just so it can be totally independently from the others.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Wai Yip Tung<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --- javainsel &lt;javainsel@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; We want to test the creation, update and deletion of an object <br/>\nwhich <br/>\n&gt; &gt; is persisted in database.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; What we now do is to have three test methods for this.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; In the testCreate method the object is created, checked that he <br/>\nis <br/>\n&gt; &gt; really created and then it is deleted (we have delete because <br/>\n&gt; &gt; unfortunately we don&#39;t use Mock Objects).<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; In the testUpdate method we create the object, update it, test <br/>\nthe <br/>\n&gt; &gt; update result and delete the created object.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; In the testDelete method we create the object so that we can test <br/>\n&gt; &gt; the deletion of it.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; As you see, everything is included in the testUpdate method. We <br/>\n&gt; &gt; duplicate much code in the other two test methods.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; We write such tests for every domain object so I wonder if we <br/>\nshould <br/>\n&gt; &gt; improve our test class.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Would you write 3 or just 1 test method for that example?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; And would you try to convince senior coworkers who know little <br/>\nabout <br/>\n&gt; &gt; JUnit and dislike TDD?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
