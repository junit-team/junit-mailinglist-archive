I&#39;ve learned quite a bit but I&#39;m having trouble \ncreating MockObjects from Classes that use Static Methods.\n\ne.g. \n\npublic class TaskGroup implements ITaskGroup {\n  \n  public static void execute() {\n    // Implementation of method\n  }\n\n  // ...\n  // \n  // Remaining TaskGroup code ...\n  // \n  // ... \n\n}\n\n\nIn this case a MockObject must extend TaskGroup instead of \nimplementing ITaskGroup.  \n\nIs this the only way to go about creating MockObjects from such \nclasses?  Is there a refactoring pattern I could employ that would \nallow me to Mock the Interface instead of the Concreate Class?\n\nI have considered placing all static methods in an abstract TaskGroup \nand causing each method to immediately throw a \njava.lang.UnsupportedOperation Exception.  This allows me to create a \nMockObject from the abstract class (i.e. The mockobject does not \nextend the domain code) but this approach strikes me as very \nquestionable design.\n\nI&#39;d appreciate any suggestions, web links or general abuse.\n\nRob.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
