The reason for that is not <br/>\n </span></blockquote>so obvious <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; to me. I think positive, so I don&#39;t think you&#39;re a troll, I think <br/>\n </span></blockquote>it was your <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; way to find out how DBC and TDD interact - just say something <br/>\n </span></blockquote>you&#39;re not <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; really convinced of yourself but hold that view to see what <br/>\n </span></blockquote>arguments are <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; against it. Please, next time just ask for these arguments instead <br/>\n </span></blockquote>of <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; behaving like a time sink.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Its strange that this forum uses censorship system before the <br/>\npostings appear.<br/>\nMust be a hot-headed community of JUnit users because this is <br/>\nnecessary.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was and am serious, all the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nForget now about DbC. We can discuss about it later (in a few <br/>\nweeks/month) again.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Now to your questions:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Does the framework has to provide mock objects for JUnit tests?<br/>\n&gt; No, it&#39;s not required that the framework provides the mock <br/>\n </span></blockquote>objects. But it <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; would be helpful.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Somehow I can&#39;t imagine to use Mock objects without our framework to <br/>\nsupport it.<br/>\nWe are at the beginning in our company of creating ERP applications <br/>\nwith the<br/>\nframework and the know how is not good yet.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; Is it possible to use Mock objects when using a ERP framework?<br/>\n&gt; That depends on wether the framework deserves the name framework <br/>\n </span></blockquote>or not.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; A real framework consists of two parts: The API/SPI and the <br/>\n </span></blockquote>implementation. If <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; the framework is a real framework, you could simply implement the <br/>\n </span></blockquote>API/SPI <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; yourself to create mock objects and replace the implementation.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What means SPI?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; But your questions do not provide the information *where* and <br/>\n </span></blockquote>*why* you want <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; to use Mock objects. So you program using the ERP API yourself? Or <br/>\n </span></blockquote>is it just <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; a code generation tool like Versata?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Our programs use the ERP framework API. It is no code generation <br/>\ntool.<br/>\nThe framework is very large and complex and still they work on it. <br/>\nIt is a<br/>\nbusiness framework which uses a component model and sits on top of <br/>\nEJB.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just want to use Mock objects for the database. The test data must <br/>\nbe coming<br/>\nfrom the test classes and not be inside the database. So we need <br/>\nMock objects<br/>\nI think. But I don&#39;t know how to create them since I still don&#39;t <br/>\nknow how<br/>\nour framework works inside and how Mock objects are used.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow you think it is not necessary that our framework supports Mock <br/>\nobjects?</div>",
