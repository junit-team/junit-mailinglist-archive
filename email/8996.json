If<br/>\nthis gets through, so be it...<br/>\n<br/>\nI just can&#39;t seem to find a balance with this list. I don&#39;t get the purpose<br/>\n(if it isn&#39;t for junit development, I guess it is junit-users) and I<br/>\ncertainly can&#39;t find a way to progress the simple discussions. You can all<br/>\ncall me names & think I am throwing a tantrum, but do you not see the number<br/>\nof distractions to content in these threads? I had one simple idea and I<br/>\nhave spent pages and page on it and progressed hardly one iota. Heck, J.B.<br/>\nis asking me to explain yet again. I don&#39;t have it in me, I don&#39;t care that<br/>\nmuch, the thought isn&#39;t worth this barrage.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t fit, and I don&#39;t feel like investing more effort trying. I was the<br/>\nnoise, and I have lots of things I&#39;d like to spend my passion on where I<br/>\nmight fit. JUnit works good enough, so be it.<br/>\n<br/>\nregards,<br/>\n<br/>\nAdam<br/>\n--<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.try.sybase.com\">http://www.try.sybase.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nExperience Sybase Technology ...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
