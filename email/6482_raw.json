Stay tuned, \n  &gt;  I will try to find out where it is.  Also, the \n  &gt;  documentation on the Squeak Swiki hosted at Georgia Tech \n  &gt;  is fairly comprehensive.\n  &gt;  \n  &gt;  =jason\n  &gt;  [:question | ^One] \n  &gt;  \n  &gt;  -----Original Message-----\n  &gt;  From: J. B. Rainsberger [mailto:jbr@...] \n  &gt;  Sent: Tuesday, December 17, 2002 12:51 PM\n  &gt;  To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n  &gt;  Subject: Re: OT: Smalltalk (RE: [junit] OT: OO Newcomer)\n  &gt;  \n  &gt;  \n  &gt;  So said  Kevin Klinemeier  on  2002-12-17 --------------------\n  &gt;  \n  &gt;  &gt;--- &quot;J. B. Rainsberger&quot; &lt;jbr@...&gt; wrote:\n  &gt;  &gt;&gt; I have found that I don&#39;t want interfaces when I work \n  &gt;  with Ruby or\n  &gt;  &gt;&gt; Smalltalk: I like the idea that handling methods has \n  &gt;  nothing to do \n  &gt;  &gt;&gt; with type.\n  &gt;  &gt;\n  &gt;  &gt;Having learned my OO skills in Java, the idea of a \n  &gt;  weakly-typed OO \n  &gt;  &gt;language (as I understand Smalltalk to be) doesn&#39;t make sense.\n  &gt;  \n  &gt;  If we call it &quot;optimistically typed&quot;, would that help your \n  &gt;  mental model? The idea is that the system assumes that the \n  &gt;  programmer will only send messages to objects that \n  &gt;  understand them, and raise an exception when that doesn&#39;t happen.\n  &gt;  \n  &gt;  I find it unlikely that I intentionally send a message to \n  &gt;  an object that doesn&#39;t understand it. That only seems to \n  &gt;  happen when I try to use third-party libraries that I \n  &gt;  don&#39;t understand yet, and that&#39;s why I write Learning \n  &gt;  Tests. (See the testdrivendevelopment list for details.)\n  &gt;  \n  &gt;  &gt;As in I\n  &gt;  &gt;don&#39;t understand what that would mean, or how it could \n  &gt;  work at all.\n  &gt;  Do\n  &gt;  &gt;you know of some helpful material, perhaps targeted at &quot;Java\n  &gt;  developers\n  &gt;  &gt;wanting perspective&quot;, or correct me if I&#39;m mistaken?\n  &gt;  \n  &gt;  I don&#39;t. Instead, I simply went to the Squeak Smalltalk \n  &gt;  home page, downloaded Squeak and played around with it. \n  &gt;  Try Googling &quot;Smalltalk for Java programmers&quot;.\n  &gt;  \n  &gt;  Take care.\n  &gt;  \n  &gt;  J.
