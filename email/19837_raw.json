I believe that mixing languages\n&gt; rather than switching completely from one language to another is going\n&gt; to be more and more important. As I explored the subject i found\n&gt; myself lacking some tools. I was frustrated by the fact that I had to\n&gt; maintain two sets of tests and look for feedback in two different\n&gt; locations while developing.\n&gt;\n&gt; I created a custom runner for JUnit to address the subject and I think\n&gt; it looks promising. I created a blog entry with some more details in\n&gt; case anyone is interested:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://johlrogge.wordpress.com/2007/09/08/hybrid-theory/\n&gt;\n&gt; I have some loose plans on open-sourcing this but I would like to see\n&gt; if there are others than me that find this interesting enough to be\n&gt; worth the effort before I do.\n&gt;\n&gt; /Joakim Ohlrogge\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
