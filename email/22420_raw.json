Classes mode is one per=\r\n class. Both is, well, both. In my 10+ years as test-infected, I have reall=\r\ny never ever had a use-case where this kind of solution would be appropriat=\r\ne (maybe some kind of really slow database with unlimited cheap connections=\r\n). With thousands of test classes you come to a grinding halt with any of t=\r\nhese options.\n\nThat&#39;s insane...\n\n\n&gt;1 more thing, do any of the selenium pro=\r\njects you speak of use the &gt;selenium grid with windows? We are having a hel=\r\nl of a time getting &gt;that working too. We have the hub on Ubuntu and window=\r\ns slaves don&#39;t &gt;play nice but Ubuntu slaves work fine. I haven&#39;t found much=\r\n info on &gt;the issues we are seeing nor have a I gotten any responses on the=\r\n &gt;Selenium mailing list. We may just have to skip IE testing for now &gt;and r=\r\nunning everything on firefox Ubuntu.\n\nWe run all our browser-bots on window=\r\ns, and the CI is bamboo on linux. We do not use grid. Instead we let a sing=\r\nle build run with 4 threads towards a single instance of selenium RC (with =\r\nfirefox). This has proved to be a nice, stable setup that gives us a lot of=\r\n punch.\nNow we also partition the entire build into 2, so we have two separ=\r\nate (Windows) pizza boxes running RC+ firefox, for a grand total\nof 8 avail=\r\nable browsers. This allows us to use firefox as the backbone in our seleniu=\r\nm-TDD-based development that has allowed us\nvirtually regression free frequ=\r\nent deployments\n\nSo are you saying that you have 2 windows machines running=\r\n selenium RC and you have your test runner that round robins between the tw=\r\no rather than using the grid?\nJust out of curiosity, what are you using to =\r\nkick off the tests?\n\n\nWe run Internet Explorer and Opera on separate boxes.=\r\n Opera Selenium tests are hard to make stable, but they also work concurren=\r\ntly.\nInternet Exploder is a strict one-instance per box for any kind of\nsta=\r\nbility. I know some people use virtualization. We just add boxes.\n\nWhen you=\r\n add boxes, each one runs a separate selenium rc server? How do you distrib=\r\nute the tests to them?\n\n\nThe other projects do much the same, but they all =\r\npre-date grid somewhat.\n\nWe&#39;re also planning to try out Chrome once we upgr=\r\nade to Selenium 2.0, we really need something webkit based.\n\nKristian\n\n\n\n\n\n=\r\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
