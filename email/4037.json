There are, of<br/>\ncourse, arguments both for and against both sides.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor JUnit: any form of testing is better than none (as well as many<br/>\nothers).<br/>\nAgainst JUnit: test cases are in a different class (even if it is in an<br/>\ninner class [*]) than the test subject.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only solution that I can see would be to make testing (or assertion)<br/>\nan integral part of the language (ala Eiffel).  This would mean that<br/>\ntests (assertions) would be an integral part of a method definition.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor now, I&#39;ll stick with JUnit.<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\n*.-  As I believe was pointed out in a previous post, inner class tests<br/>\nmay be just as unlikely to be updated than purpose built test classes<br/>\n<br/>\nManuel Amago.<br/>\nmailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mamago@...\">mamago@...</a></div>",
