But<br/>\nwhat if a potential future interaction blows up because of a bug that is not<br/>\nexposed by the first test?  At this point I am back to being less confident<br/>\nthat my code is correct, and I have to search for the posibility that there<br/>\nis a bug in the interaction or a bug in the underlying objects that compose<br/>\nthe interaction.  At this point my scope of search is expanded costing me<br/>\nmore time than if the bug was exposed by a unit test.<br/>\n<br/>\nThink of testing a 4 wheel drive.  I could test the a component (axle) in<br/>\nunit fashion. &quot;This axle will survive 20,000 ftlbs of torque&quot;(I&#39;m not a<br/>\nmechanical engineer) This would give me level of confidence that the axle<br/>\nwould perform when put into the rest of the vehicle.  The other option is to<br/>\nskip all the unit tests and just put the truck together and take it into the<br/>\nfield and hammer it to see what breaks.  As the Test driver I would be more<br/>\nconfident in the truck that had the part unit tested.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps<br/>\n<br/>\nMichael<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: news [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:news@...\">news@...</a>]On Behalf Of Mike Bresnahan<br/>\nSent: Friday, June 20, 2003 4:33 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [junit] Re: Unit Testing vs Integration Testing<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Unit testing gives you confidence in your objects.
