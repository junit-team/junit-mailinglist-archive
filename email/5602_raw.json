Would you find it useful? I am\nseeking your inputs.\n\nProtocol encoder/decoder classes will allow the tester to concentrate\non the test cases.  One of my projects will be using the RADIUS\nprotocol over UDP.\n\nI&#39;m looking at a framework that let the testXXX methods send\nthe message to a helper thread for encoding and sending, then wait for\nthe response.  I&#39;d like help in keeping this &quot;along the spirit&quot; of\nJUnit.

Remember that the point of JUnit is not to\n&gt; functionally test the software. It is to unit test it. Try to break down\n&gt; your code into small testable pieces. By testing each piece you will\n&gt; have\n&gt; greater control and more confidence that it will work once you put it\n&gt; together. It may not even be necessary to run the client and server at\n&gt; the\n&gt; same time if you take this approach; the test case could act as the\n&gt; server\n&gt; for testing the client and vice-versa. These are just a few thoughts --\n&gt; the\n&gt; details of your particular program may prevent such an approach. But if\n&gt; you\n&gt; are testing your code from the very beginning you shouldn&#39;t have too\n&gt; much\n&gt; trouble doing it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Chris\n&gt; \n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: guillaume_berche [mailto:guillaume.berche@e...]\n&gt; Sent: Monday, January 21, 2002 8:49 AM\n&gt; To: junit@y...\n&gt; Subject: [junit] Junit support for non-standard distributed applications\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Hello,\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m working on a Java layer implementing various communication \n&gt; infrastructrure betwen processes based on raw TCP and UDP. I would \n&gt; like to test it using Junit. However, this requires me to write a \n&gt; test case which is distributed among many processes which act as \n&gt; client/servers.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve looked into jakarta&#39;s cactus, and Junit EE but I understand they \n&gt; would support only distributed applications based on standard \n&gt; communication protocols (namely HTTP and an EJB contained)\n&gt; \n&gt; Is there an extension to Junit that would support testing of non-\n&gt; standard distributed applications?\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve started designing an RMI-based version of the junit interfaces \n&gt; where a testcase could spawn one or more &quot;distributed test cases&quot; \n&gt; running on remote hosts and that would report their status through \n&gt; the originating test&#39;s TestListener. I&#39;m basically remotizing the \n&gt; junit interfaces.\n&gt; \n&gt; I wonder if such extension would already exist and if I could reuse \n&gt; it rather than redoing this from scratch. \n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks for your help,\n&gt; \n&gt; Guillaume.\n\n\n\n\n",
