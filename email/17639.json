Nearly every thing I do<br/>\nis run as a servlet, so you have to be thread safe. And all of my <br/>\nsystems have assorted daemons and background threads, which implement <br/>\nsimple things like WorkingSetCaches or do long things like<br/>\ntalking to radios that have to be dispatched asynchronously.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the AJAX folks are pushing the multi-threaded model even harder,<br/>\nwith many more server clanks, and more chances for the server to get <br/>\nwrapped arround the axel with thread issues.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nPat Farrell<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.pfarrell.com/\">http://www.pfarrell.com/</a></div>",
