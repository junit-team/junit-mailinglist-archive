I am still working on this...and I am new at\nXSL...but I thought I&#39;d share the approach for what it is worth...(which\nmay not be much)....as it seems possibly generically useful thing for\nsome people to want to perhaps do as well.\n\nJUnit Results -------&gt; Mercury QC\n&lt;http://michael01612.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!2D894EF96C8FC0!2168.entry&gt;\n\nMike Foley\n\n\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
