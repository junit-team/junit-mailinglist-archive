Hey, it&#39;s so nice I&#39;m happy with it; but I<br/>\nremember the days when there /were/ filing systems with special<br/>\nformats, and OS calls to read those formats and do the grunt work<br/>\nfor you, and what a total and absolute pain it was when &quot;it&#39;s a<br/>\nbyte stream&quot; got in the way of &quot;and this is the data&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n    [Editing object files on RSX-11M was, I think, the activity that<br/>\n     provoked particular horror. &quot;Editing&quot; means &quot;writing a program<br/>\n     to do systematic renaming of compiler-genrated identifiers&quot;.]<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t think those days had gone away. Delight me.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Java does exactly what the program tells it to do.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The program says &quot;read [or write] the next K bytes down this<br/>\nstream&quot;. If &quot;this stream&quot; happened to be connected to a record-<br/>\noriented file, Java should do exactly what the program says -<br/>\nwhich is to invoke the filing-system call appropriate to writing <br/>\nto that file, I would have thought, not just splattering the<br/>\nbytes randomly into the file&#39;s blocks.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne can certainly take the view that Java programs just cannot<br/>\nhandle such files on such filing systems. One may also scratch<br/>\none&#39;s head about whether this is a good thing. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Applications should not be written to local conventions. Your program<br/>\n&gt; should generate the same output whether it runs on a Mac, Windows, Unix,<br/>\n&gt; or something else. It rally doesn&#39;t matter whether you pick &#92;n, &#92;r, or<br/>\n&gt; &#92;r&#92;n; but pick one and be done with it. Don&#39;t change it just because the<br/>\n&gt; platform changed. Otherwise you get into the trouble that started this<br/>\n&gt; whole thread, where  a program that works on one system fails for no<br/>\n&gt; apparent reason on another.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If there are applications on those platforms that /demand/ the<br/>\nplatform-local format - they need not be Java applications, nor<br/>\nneed they be &quot;reasonable text editors&quot; - then wilfully getting<br/>\nin their way doesn&#39;t seem to me to be good policy.<br/>\n<br/>\n[Which is why Jena&#39;s RDF/XML writer uses line.separator at a<br/>\n critical point; we had been generating RDF/XML that some <br/>\n application running on Windows Did Not Like. Having the user<br/>\n change it to a Modern Application wasn&#39;t an option.]<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nChris &quot;electric hedgehog&quot; Dollin<br/>\nThe software engineer&#39;s song: &quot;who knows where the time goes&quot;.</div>",
