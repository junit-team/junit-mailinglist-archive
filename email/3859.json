Actually I started by running them <br/>\nin a single JVM but this introduced side-effects because my team&#39;s <br/>\nIPC components were not designed to be used this way...<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Remember that the point of JUnit is not to<br/>\n&gt; functionally test the software. It is to unit test it. Try to break <br/>\n </span></blockquote>down<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; your code into small testable pieces. By testing each piece you <br/>\n </span></blockquote>will have<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; greater control and more confidence that it will work once you put <br/>\n </span></blockquote>it<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; together. It may not even be necessary to run the client and server <br/>\n </span></blockquote>at the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; same time if you take this approach; the test case could act as the <br/>\n </span></blockquote>server<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; for testing the client and vice-versa. These are just a few <br/>\n </span></blockquote>thoughts -- the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; details of your particular program may prevent such an approach. <br/>\n </span></blockquote>But if you<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; are testing your code from the very beginning you shouldn&#39;t have <br/>\n </span></blockquote>too much<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; trouble doing it.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I agree I&#39;m trying to use JUnit for functional tests rather than unit <br/>\ntests for which it was designed. This piece of code is some existing <br/>\ncode that needs to be tested and was not designed from the start with <br/>\ntestability in mind. Consequently, it&#39;s not so easy to break it into <br/>\nsmall parts for tests without investing a fair amount of time.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe reason I&#39;m trying to use Junit for functional tests is that the <br/>\nJunit execution environment is convenient and well integrated into <br/>\nour Java-base development process: Junit is integrated into ANT and <br/>\ncruisecontrol, the two tools supporting automatic build environment <br/>\nincluding automatic test execution, collection of logs, analysis of <br/>\ntest results and notification of test failures.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you know an alternative to the Junit framework (i.e. a better <br/>\napproach) to support automated functional tests that include more <br/>\nthan one process (and possibly more than one computer). The goal <br/>\nstill being to run these tests &quot;continuously&quot; and to reduce manual <br/>\ntasks to a minimum in order to detect introduced bugs as soon as <br/>\npossible? <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\nGuillaume.</div>",
