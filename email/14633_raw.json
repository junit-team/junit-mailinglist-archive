Plus if you do it you know \n&gt; you&#39;re \n&gt;&gt; doing something skanky.\n&gt; \n&gt; Exactly! And the latter also holds true for using classes from a \n&gt; com.sun package, or from a package that ends in &quot;.internal&quot;.\n&gt; \n\nIt&#39;s not at the same thing at all. Reflectively invoking methods is so \ninconvenient it discourages itself. By contrast you can use a class \nmarked internal or in the sun packages exactly like you use any other \nclass.\n\nLet me ask you this. How would you feel about making &quot;private&quot; just a \nsuggestion? i.e. why not allow anyone to invoke any private method from \nany class they want to? Of course, they would know when doing this that \nthey were doing something skanky. Would you be happy with such a \nlanguage? If not, why not? And why is a naming convention good enough to \nkeep packages and classes unpublished if it&#39;s not good enough to keep \nmethods unpublished?\n\nIf you think the private keyword should be just a suggestion, then I \nthink we will just have to agree to disagree at this point. But if you \ndon&#39;t think private is unnecessary, then I think there&#39;s a contradiction \nin your philosophy that&#39;s worth exploring further.\n\n-- \n﻿Elliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nXML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim\n\n",
