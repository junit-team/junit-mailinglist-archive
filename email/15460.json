Even if I do that, I still need to test-drive the<br/>\ntemplate, or hide the template behind an interface so I can test-drive<br/>\nthe code that uses it. I suppose it is achievable, but I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s<br/>\nworth the effort.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf Java made the syntax for anonymous code blocks nicer, then I suppose <br/>\nthis wouldn&#39;t be a problem.
