However, I&#39;ve seen\nthis as an excuse to completely ignore the exception,\nin both testing and production.  Don&#39;t like that at\nall.  So, I&#39;ve decided to knuckle down and NOT use\nunchecked exceptions whenever possible.  This *forces*\nyou to handle them.  \n\nThat fact that you say using them allows the compiler\nto &#39;get in the way&#39; sounds like a non-issue.  Is this\ncoupling between your two systems?  Maybe...but I\n(personally) would rather have it and make damn sure\nthose exceptions are handled.\n\n\n-Eric\n\n--- &quot;J. B. Rainsberger&quot; &lt;jbr@...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;jbr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One could argue that throwing the wrong\n&gt; exception type is a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; failure and not an error, but since it&#39;s\n&gt; impossible to distinguish\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; between simply throwing the wrong exception\n&gt; type and something\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; going horribly wrong, it is easiest to treat\n&gt; them both as errors.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;/jbr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; i think it depends on the exception.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Always.\n&gt; &gt; Actually NOT.\n&gt; \n&gt; I think I miscommunicated: I meant &quot;it always\n&gt; depends on the exception.&quot; In \n&gt; that case, I believe that we agree. :)\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; [...] if a method has advertised\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; an exception in its throws clause, a caller\n&gt; can anticipate that it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; could happen, catch it, and call the outcome a\n&gt; failure.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I think Java&#39;s checked exceptions are evil, so I\n&gt; don&#39;t bother. If it ain&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the right exception, then the production code is\n&gt; barfing. Barfing is an\n&gt; &gt; &gt; error -- different from, say, answering 10\n&gt; instead of 8.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; what about mixed language environment? I mean\n&gt; CORBA / Java or \n&gt; &gt; something like this... CORBA exceptions should be\n&gt; proccessed in Java,\n&gt; &gt;  catched.... so I think checked exceptions are\n&gt; better, they AWARE \n&gt; &gt; programmers of majority of possible exception.\n&gt; They are part of \n&gt; &gt; method contracts. I FLAME :+)\n&gt; \n&gt; I agree that checked exceptions give the compiler an\n&gt; opportunity to make \n&gt; people aware of exceptions that code expects to\n&gt; throw. Even so:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. I don&#39;t need the compiler to do all this work for\n&gt; me. Often it gets in my \n&gt; way.\n&gt; 2. When I refactor, I have to worry about the ripple\n&gt; effect of all these damn \n&gt; declared exceptions. Anything that makes refactoring\n&gt; difficult, tedious or \n&gt; annoying is, in my opinion, a Bad Thing unless it\n&gt; delivers real value in the \n&gt; meantime.\n&gt; \n&gt; I am not convinced that, overall, the value\n&gt; delivered by checked exceptions \n&gt; is greater than the cost.\n&gt; \n&gt; On my current project, which of course includes\n&gt; database access, the entry \n&gt; point into the data access objects throws only\n&gt; unchecked exceptions. If our \n&gt; data access object encounters an SQLException, it\n&gt; wraps that in an \n&gt; ObjectStoreException. These are unexpected problems\n&gt; and catastrophic errors. \n&gt; When we throw an exception from within the data\n&gt; access object, we throw a \n&gt; subclass of ObjectStoreException, such as\n&gt; EntityNotFoundException, \n&gt; EntityInUseException, DuplicateEntityException. None\n&gt; of these exceptions are \n&gt; checked.\n&gt; \n&gt; We don&#39;t miss a thing. If we had checked exceptions\n&gt; everywhere, we would run \n&gt; the risk of coupling our service code with our data\n&gt; access code. Bad Thing.\n&gt; \n&gt; Does the compiler have as much information to help\n&gt; us uncover unhandled \n&gt; exceptions? No. \n&gt; \n&gt; That&#39;s why we have tests. The compiler ain&#39;t so damn\n&gt; smart, anyhow.\n&gt; \n&gt; --\n&gt; J. B.
