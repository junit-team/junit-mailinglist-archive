I know ya&#39;ll are really sharp, so<br/>\nlet me start with a little higher up, and then dig a<br/>\nlittle, which will serve as more of a starting point<br/>\nfor the material in the earlier posts.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s a more general scenario.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a developer.  She fires up eclipse,<br/>\ncreates a new class, and codes a method.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust 1.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen she selects the Eclipse menu (Hypothetical)<br/>\n<br/>\nTest &gt; test<br/>\n<br/>\nand <br/>\n<br/>\na src/main/test<br/>\n<br/>\ndirectory within her project is automatically created<br/>\nwith tests that cover her method exhaustively (100%).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo when I say 0 time for the developer, I mean 0 time<br/>\ncoding the tests.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow she reviews the tests.  Could be that she finds<br/>\nthat her method needs some tweaking, to further<br/>\ncontrain it&#39;s behaviour.  Then she regenerates the<br/>\ntests.<br/>\n<br/>\nEtc.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow I think the question becomes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Well, how do we know the test is tested<br/>\n100%/Exhaustively?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is where the part about reading some of the other<br/>\nstuff I wrote earlier in previous posts comes in. <br/>\nI&#39;ll be glad to elaborate on those :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\n- Ole<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- &quot;J.
