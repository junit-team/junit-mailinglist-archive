My coverage confirms that my ordering\n&gt; &gt; logic is run during =\r\nthe tests.  In this situation, the ordering\n&gt; &gt; logic is private and not di=\r\nrectly tested.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; A user reports that the list is not sorted correctl=\r\ny, and now I \n&gt; &gt; find myself with at least two possible locations to \n&gt; &gt; =\r\ninvestigate:  the HTML generation and the sorting logic.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If I had =\r\nwritten a test for the private sorting logic, I would \n&gt; &gt; know right away =\r\nwhere the bug is.\n&gt; \n&gt; Very well put.  I believe this would be a great cano=\r\nnical example\n&gt; of why peeking into private methods is not only OK, but the=\r\n \n&gt; preferred way to test, in some cases.\n&gt; \n\nWhy wouldn&#39;t this be an indic=\r\nation that there were insufficient \ntests? Evidently, the functional test t=\r\nhat was supposed to make sure \nthat the HTML is &quot;correct&quot; didn&#39;t actually v=\r\nerify that the elements \n(whatever they are) were presented in the correct =\r\norder. I&#39;m not \nsure I understand what &quot;private&quot; means in this scenario. It=\r\n doesn&#39;t \nusually mean &quot;can&#39;t directly access from a web browser URL&quot;.\n\nJim=\r\n\n\n\n",
