I imagine a simple class <br/>\ncould be written that wraps around the swingrunner class that allows <br/>\nan interactive method call to bring the dialog up.. give me a few <br/>\ndays to think about it and I might be able to make something <br/>\navailable on the bluej website resources section to help out.<br/>\n<br/>\nAndrew<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Andrew.Patterson@...\">Andrew.Patterson@...</a><br/>\nMonash University</div>",
