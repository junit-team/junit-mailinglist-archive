Description is designed\nto not really allow for &quot;incorrect&quot; configurations.  It looks like\nIDEA has some kind of funky adapter that&#39;s not dealing well with\ncustom runners--would you mind pinging them about it?\n\nI&#39;ve been wrong before, however...\n\n   David Saff\n\nOn 2/21/07, Lasse Koskela &lt;lasse.koskela@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hi all,\n&gt;\n&gt; We&#39;re developing a framework called JDave\n&gt; (http://www.laughingpanda.org/projects/jdave). In order to get IDE\n&gt; support from day-one, we decided to adapt for JUnit. In the case of\n&gt; JUnit 4, this translates to @RunWith and a custom Runner\n&gt; implementation.\n&gt;\n&gt; The problem I&#39;m facing is that while Eclipse displays the hierarchy\n&gt; correctly as a tree, IntelliJ IDEA doesn&#39;t play along quite as nicely.\n&gt; Below are links to screenshots of what it looks like currently in\n&gt; different IDEs:\n&gt;\n&gt; Correct behavior in Eclipse:\n&gt; http://tinyurl.com/36tzd3\n&gt;\n&gt; Incorrect behavior in IDEA:\n&gt; http://tinyurl.com/3xye2k\n&gt;\n&gt; Correct behavior in IDEA:\n&gt; http://tinyurl.com/2jzf5d\n&gt; (using our Junit 3 integration, which works in both Eclipse and IDEA)\n&gt;\n&gt; I believe I&#39;m doing something wrong with how I build the Description\n&gt; object in my custom runner but I can&#39;t find a &quot;specification&quot; to\n&gt; verify my implementation against. I tried browsing the junit CVS and\n&gt; couldn&#39;t find tests that would tell me about how one is supposed to\n&gt; create those Description objects.\n&gt;\n&gt; Here&#39;s an example of the kind of hierarchy we&#39;re creating currently:\n&gt;\n&gt; jdave.junit4.StackSpec (suite:true, tests:8)\n&gt;   StackWhichIsNeitherEmptyNorFull (suite:true, tests:1)\n&gt;     addsToTheTopWhenSentPush (suite:false, tests:1)\n&gt;   FullStack (suite:true, tests:5)\n&gt;     isFull (suite:false, tests:1)\n&gt;     complainsOnPush (suite:false, tests:1)\n&gt;     containsAllItems (suite:false, tests:1)\n&gt;     doesNotContainRemovedItem (suite:false, tests:1)\n&gt;     containsAllButRemovedItem (suite:false, tests:1)\n&gt;   EmptyStack (suite:true, tests:2)\n&gt;     isEmpty (suite:false, tests:1)\n&gt;     isNoLongerEmptyAfterPush (suite:false, tests:1)\n&gt;\n&gt; Any pointers as to where I&#39;m falling off the Path of Righteousness?\n&gt;\n&gt; Lasse\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
