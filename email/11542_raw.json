I&#39;m\nfamiliar with the idea, have written several, and for\nsimple things it makes some sense, but people talk\nabout them as if they&#39;re much more useful than I see\nthem as.\n\nThis is an area that I really don&#39;t know very well,\nhaving only written a few &#39;mock objects&#39;, most of\nwhich ended up having *frustratingly* high levels\nof complexity themselves, just for test objects.\nAn example is a database mock I put together.\nI was able to make it mostly work (querying a\nlist of &#39;n&#39; most recent entries, for example, was a\npain), but it required a good bit of debugging, and\nit ended up being nearly as complex as the actual\ndatabase class (and more so, in some cases, when\nI needed to test getting data in various orders\nwhich is super-easy in SQL, and annoyingly hard\nwhen you have to implement it yourself.)\n\nIt gets worse when you&#39;re trying to mock one of\nyour own classes, still under active development.\nAs the interface changes, from refactoring, or just\nnew aspects, the mock has to change also, as well\nas the tests.  And sometimes you have to figure out\nhow to even implement the new interface parts in\nthe mock, if at all possible.\n\nIf all you&#39;re doing is returning a single value, then\nyou can&#39;t reasonably test, &#39;get next&#39; type calls, or\nanything like that.  You need to add state to your\nmock, and *poof* you&#39;ve gotten into a situation\nwhere your mock is nearly as complex as the real\nthing.\n\nHow the heck do people mock things like database\naccess classes, mail servers, arbitrary web requests,\netc., without writing a huge amount of logic?\n\nWhat am I missing?\n\n--  Morgan Schweers\n\n\n",
