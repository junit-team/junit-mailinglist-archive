And even though I&#39;ve used JUnit every work day for the past 3<br/>\n&gt;  years, I have a new problem I&#39;m not sure how to approach.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  I need to write some tests of a Java API that we&#39;re going to deliver to<br/>\n&gt;  our customer.  And so my basic plan is to write some JUnit test cases<br/>\n&gt;  that will interact with our product through this Java API, just as a<br/>\n&gt;  customer would.  But I don&#39;t want to have any of our product source code<br/>\n&gt;  checked out to do this.  Instead, I want my JUnit test case&#39;s setUp() to<br/>\n&gt;  find the appropriate JAR file on a remote system, fetch it locally, and<br/>\n&gt;  then start running tests against it.  That way, whenever the JAR file on<br/>\n&gt;  the remote system (our system-under-test) changes, I know I&#39;ll be<br/>\n&gt;  testing the latest API code.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  I&#39;ve got all the tools at hand to find and fetch the JAR file, but I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt;  not sure what my approach should be to load the JAR at runtime AFTER my<br/>\n&gt;  test (and thus the JVM it&#39;s running in) has already started.  Any advice<br/>\n&gt;  for me?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>To do that implies some sort of classloader shenanigans, which isn&#39;t pretty.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is stopping you from getting the latest version of the JAR as<br/>\npart of the ANT script / automated build process that runs the tests,<br/>\nbefore the tests start running?<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\n<br/>\nJames<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Todd.<br/>\n&gt;  ----<br/>\n&gt;  Todd Bradley - Polycom, Inc.<br/>\n&gt;  ReadiVideo QA Lead<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
