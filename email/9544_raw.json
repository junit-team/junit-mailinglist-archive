You run them under exactly the same \nconditions.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now in this case, I was actually being kind to Java.  I ignored the\n&gt; startup time.  Had I done &quot;fairer&quot; tests, C++ would have \noutperformed\n&gt; Java by a much wider margin.\n&gt; \n&gt; But the tests were absurdly biased to begin with.  They were about \nas\n\nI am a &#39;newbie&#39; to a lot of this discussion group.. but isn&#39;t it \nslightly absurd to benchmark Java against C or C++ anyways?  It \nsounds like you guys are trying to compare apples to oranges.  The \npoint of Java isn&#39;t that it is fast.  I realize that some people want \nto see how MUCH slower than C++ it is.  That makes sense but then you \nhave to set some parameters for your test.  Some people would want to \nknow the &#39;warmed up numbers&#39; for real world capabilities.  Others \nwould want to know the cold start numbers for &#39;benchmarking&#39; \nnumbers.  Depending on what information you need for your decision \nmaking process... either of the methods could make sense.  \n\n&gt; biased as possible towards removing all of the effects being \ndiscussed.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; To have a smaller footprint try -Xms1m.\n&gt; \n&gt; In the context of the discussion you are replying to, to have a \nsmaller\n&gt; footprint, run the Java through JAX.  This will reduce the code \nsize by\n&gt; 60-70%.  That will reduce your load time and memory footprint by a \nsimilar\n&gt; amount and have, I believe, a similar effect on execution time.\n&gt; \n&gt; --\n&gt; Jim Dixon  jdd@d...   tel +44 117 982 0786  mobile +44 797 373 7881\n\n\n",
