It is especially well suited for writing snippe=\r\nt-heavy\ndocumentation.\n\nIn short, Bumblebee gets events from the execution =\r\nof the tests\n(suites/classes/methods) and then parses the classes and metho=\r\nds for\nspecific comments to include.\n\nBy default it adds the de-camelcased =\r\nnames of the suites/cases/methods\nas headings (a la agile dox), and the con=\r\ntained comments becomes the\nparagraphs.\n\nThe comments are actually handled =\r\nas Ruby-strings that get executed in\na Bumblebee execution context before b=\r\neing added to the output. The\nexecution context is\na kind of DSL for includ=\r\ning code-snippets and other things needed, and\none of the core ideas of Bum=\r\nblebee is that you should be able to\nextend that functionality easily.\n\nMor=\r\ne detailed information about Bumblebee can be found at:\n\nhttp://www.agical.=\r\ncom/bumblebee/bumblebee_doc.html\n\nwhich is of course generated with Bumbleb=\r\nee. :-)\n\nThe concept of Bumblebee is the same as for TDDoc, which me and Jo=\r\nakim\nOhlrogge wrote some time ago as an add-on for RMock. Unfortunately,\nTD=\r\nDoc became a bit of a dead-end technically, and Joakim and I thought\nit wou=\r\nld be a good idea to start fresh. I happened to have the time at\nthe time a=\r\nnd I started it up. So, if you like Bumblebee, give half of\nyour credits to=\r\n Joakim!\n\nThis is an early release, and I will be very happy for any feedba=\r\nck I\ncan get to improve it.\n\nCheers\nDaniel Brolund\n\n_______________________=\r\n___\nDaniel Brolund\n\nAgical AB\nV=E4sterl=E5nggatan 79, 2 tr\n111 29 Stockholm=\r\n, SWEDEN\n\nweb:  www.agical.com\nmob:  +46-708-754002\nmail: daniel.brolund@ag=\r\nical.com\nblog: danielbrolund.wordpress.com\npriv: daniel.brolund@...\n\n",
