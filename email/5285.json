We <br/>\nare having some issues whereby the static variables in the mock <br/>\nobjects are being held in the class loader.  This appears to be <br/>\ncreating nasty confusion and giving us errors in our tests depending <br/>\non the granularity by which they are run. Our utlimate aim was to <br/>\nexecute our application test classes through a master TestAll <br/>\nhowever this seems like its not going to work.  Our proposed work <br/>\naround is to use ant to identify each test case and run them <br/>\nindependently.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHas anyone seen this issue before and are there any suggested work <br/>\narounds ?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\nMatthew.</div>",
