For example:\n&gt; - contents, labels\n&gt; - enabled/disabled\n&gt; - shown/hidden\n&gt; - color, font\n&gt; - etc.\n\nYes.\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; In order to change the state of those components there must be a\n&gt; conversation from the model, or mediator in your example, to those widgets.\n\nYes.\n\n\n&gt; This conversation is typically implemented in &gt; 0 lines of nontrivial code.\n&gt; This code is prone to breakage.\n\nIn general, I don&#39;t agree. If you are doing anything more than making swing\ncalls, that code should be elsewhere. When the code is not trivial, which I\nclaim is rare (and I do this for a living), then test the gui. I&#39;m not\nsaying don&#39;t test it - I&#39;m saying question if the test is needed. If it&#39;s\nneeded, do it. If you can move the logic elsewhere, then just look at it to\nsee if it works.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; On top of that you also have the conversation from the widgets to the\n&gt; model/mediator. This also is prone to breakage, typically through\n&gt; inappropriate use of listener callback arguments, or just simply forgetting\n&gt; to set up a callback.\n&gt; \n\nWhich would be highly visible and immediately obvious that it wasn&#39;t\nworking.\n\n\n\n&gt; So you see, the statement that it &quot;can&#39;t break&quot; is just a bit overly\n&gt; optimistic.\n&gt; \n\nPerhaps, but not to the extent that you&#39;re implying.\n\n-- \nRobert Koss, Ph.D.     | Training, Mentoring, Contract Development\nSenior Consultant      | Object Oriented Design, C++, Java\nwww.objectmentor.com   | Extreme Programming\n\n\n\n",
