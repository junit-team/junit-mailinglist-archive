There are 30+ test methods that query the database, for \neach specific data mapping, strings the results together, and uses \nand assert to compare to the solution string.  I only want the \ndatabase to be loaded once before the tests and purged once after \nthe tests.\n\nIn my TestDBMaps class (which extends TestCase), I tried the \nsolution given in the FAQ.  So, I added:\n\npublic static Test suite()\n{\n\tTestSuite suite = new TestSuite();\n\n\tTestSetup wrapper = new TestSetup(suite)\n\t{\n\t\tprotected void setUp()\n\t\t{\n\t\t\toneTimeSetUp();\n\t\t}\n\n\t\tprotected void tearDown()\n\t\t{\n\t\t\toneTimeTearDown();\n\t\t}\n\t};\n\treturn wrapper;\n}\n\nI renamed my original setUp() and tearDown() to oneTimeSetUp() and \noneTimeTearDown() and made them static.\n\nThe problem now is that the TestDBMaps.suite() method does not \nexecute.  I assume I&#39;ve put this in the wrong spot, however, I&#39;m not \nsure where to put it... again I&#39;m assuming my TestSuiteMain class.  \nIf so, do I need to get rid of the TestSuiteMain.main() and replace \nit with TestSuiteMain.suite()?\n\nI really do not want to place the logic for one time setup and \nteardown in my TestSuiteMain since the setup for one of the test \nclasses is very different than it is for another test class.  To \nplace the logic in my TestSuiteMain would then require me to make a \nmonolithic set up and tear down that handles all classes... and this \nwill only grow as I add more test classes to my package.\n\nWhat is the best way to handle what I&#39;m trying to accomplish?\n\nOn another note, I found the JUnit documentation on www.junit.org to \nbe a little hard to understand, personally.  And it didn&#39;t seem to \ngo quite into as much depth as I would like.  Can anyone recommend a \ngood book on the subject?  One that covers XUnit methodologies in \nother languages would be great too.\n\nThank you,\nCurt\n\n\n\n",
