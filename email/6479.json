The idea is that the system assumes that the programmer will<br/>\nonly send messages to objects that understand them, and raise an<br/>\nexception when that doesn&#39;t happen.<br/>\n<br/>\nI find it unlikely that I intentionally send a message to an object<br/>\nthat doesn&#39;t understand it. That only seems to happen when I try to use<br/>\nthird-party libraries that I don&#39;t understand yet, and that&#39;s why I<br/>\nwrite Learning Tests. (See the testdrivendevelopment list for details.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;As in I<br/>\n&gt;don&#39;t understand what that would mean, or how it could work at all.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Do<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;you know of some helpful material, perhaps targeted at &quot;Java<br/>\n </span></blockquote>developers<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;wanting perspective&quot;, or correct me if I&#39;m mistaken?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t. Instead, I simply went to the Squeak Smalltalk home page,<br/>\ndownloaded Squeak and played around with it.
