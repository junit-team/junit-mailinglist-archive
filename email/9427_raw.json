This makes no sense.\n&gt;\n&gt; Comments that merely describe how the code does things is waste. The\n&gt; code already says that. These are the comments that a vast majority of\n&gt; programmers insist on writing, largely because someone taught them to do\n&gt; so in school.\n\nIn my experience\n\n*  few programmers comment code to any degree\n\n*  fewer comments correlate well with more bugs\n\n*  as often as not, it&#39;s faster to rewrite uncommented code than it is\n   to figure out what the code &quot;already says&quot;\n\nIf the code is doing anything complex, if it is implementing rules\nthat contain domain-specific knowledge, comments are not waste --\nthey are absolutely essential.\n\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;                                    Diagnostic messages are not\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; assertions and cannot fail if they are wrong, so they are waste.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; It is trivially easy to put diagnostic messages inside an if -- you\n&gt; &gt; see them if something of interest occurs.\n&gt;\n&gt; Waste is waste. Large amounts of waste often build themselves up from a\n&gt; large number of small amounts of waste.\n\nOften you work with code that is uncommented, buggy, and incomprehensible.\nOne useful way to figure it out is sprinkling diagnostic messages here\nand there, running it, and watching what falls out.\n\nThere are many other approaches.  Some people use one, some another.\nIf you are fortunate, you have a variety of people working with you, so\nthat when you can&#39;t understand what&#39;s in front of you, you can pass the\nproblem over to someone else with a different set of skills.  If you\nare _very_ fortunate, you will have more than one tool in your own bag\nof tricks.\n\n--\nJim Dixon  jdd@...   tel +44 117 982 0786  mobile +44 797 373 7881\n\n\n\n",
