In my<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;little Junit-misuse experiment I don&#39;t have such pre-defined hierarchy <br/>\n </span></blockquote>but<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;&gt;only decide which tests need to be run when running them (so one test<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;might dynamically add 3 other tests that need to be run).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have no idea as to whether or not this would work, but I have to ask <br/>\n&gt; why you would want to structure your tests in this fashion - aren&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; tests better designed as independent as possible of one another?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Generally I agree, but bear in mind that I&#39;m not talking of normal <br/>\nunit-tests here.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m testing object hierarchies and configurations for errors here (not <br/>\ncode) so for example I have 5 objects of type A where each has zero to <br/>\nfive associated objects of type B. I want to run some tests on all objects <br/>\nof type A and some tests on all objects of type B. Now I could traverse <br/>\nthe whole hierarchy in advance to get a complete overview of the test <br/>\nhierarchy needed, but it is much simpler to just let the tests themselves <br/>\nregister test-able objects whenever they come across one (additionally the <br/>\nhierarchy can be much larger and exist in persistent storage, traversing <br/>\nit twice would be terrible for performance).<br/>\n<br/>\nBtw, I&#39;ve finally decided that JUnit is not my tool here, &#39;cause it makes <br/>\nsome assumptions that I can&#39;t/don&#39;t want to meet. (Most of these <br/>\nassumptions can be broken without breaking JUnit itself, but tools that <br/>\nwork with JUnit like Eclipse become confused as hell, when a test returns <br/>\nmore than one error/failure). I&#39;m using many of the design decisions made <br/>\nfor JUnit as a guide, &#39;though.<br/>\n<br/>\nregards<br/>\nJoachim Sauer<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
