That shortened\n&gt; &gt; the JUnit learning curve, which helped a lot.\n\nDave replied:\n&gt; As I said above (and will again, watch for a CoadLetter issue on the\n&gt; topic) there should be no explicit coorelation between classes being\n&gt; tested and TestCase subclasses.\n\nDave made a very strong statement. I&#39;ve seen the quote from \nhis book, but a few things I&#39;m missing. As one of the authors \nof JUnitDoclet I&#39;d like to add them here. \n\nBefore I continue, I&#39;d like to confirm the additional need \nfor tests not directly related to one specific unit of the \ncode. (Even JUnitDoclet itself has TestCases like that.) \n\nTo organize tests like the application is one way to do it. \nA natural one, indeed. From a strict testing perspective \nthe use of a TestCase for each class may not be the very \nbest way. (Reuse of fixture is an important point.) \nBut considering other perspectives I&#39;m not convinced it \nis as bad as Dave made it sound. \n\nI like to have many tests. It was only natural to automate \nthe repeating part of test writing. So JUnitDoclet generates \nTest skeletons and merges them with what was generated \n(and modified) before. \n\nIn my experience, beginners to JUnit often find it difficult \nto create the first TestCases. This is used as an excuse not \nto test at all. (It&#39;s a lame excuse, I know.) Once they&#39;ve \ngot started, they discover the power of unit testing. \nUnfortunately they have to start first. ;-)\n \nPlease consider the result of JUnitDoclet as an managed \nstarting point. It is providing places to fill in tests \nboth to beginners and to experienced developers. \n\nIf someone want&#39;s more then the generated test code, he/she \ncan add TestCases or even TestSuites that contain TestCases \nfor different aspects (with different fixtures), ...\n\nThe very basic fixture may be the instance to test. In a \nsignificant number of cases that could be just what is \nneeded.\n \nOne major thing I like about tests related to specific units \nof code: \n  The tests are documenting the intention behind the code. \n\nWhen I look at my code later, I like to go to the test and \nsee what the code was ment to do. The underestimated part \nof that idea is, to keep the test structure in sync as the\napplication is refactured. Here is one major difference to \nother tools I know: refactoring support. Only if the test \nstructure is _following_ the application structure we keep\nthe &quot;documenting aspect of tests&quot; up to date.  \n\nI see the benefits from the structure Dave described and \nthink about whether or not generating them somehow. But I&#39;m \nnot sure about the survival of the &quot;documenting aspect of \ntests&quot;. Wouldn&#39;t separate &quot;methods with long names&quot; be \nbetter from _that_ point of view? (We still can/should factor \nout the creation and destruction of a reused fixture.) \nWhat do you think?\n\nKind regards,\n\nSteffen\n\n\n\n",
