Ok so I wrote a simple test that shows a JFrame and uses Java Robot to click on it. Works fine run in Eclipse on Mac as an application or JUnit test but fails when run as JUnit plugin test. Frame would show 1 out of 5 or so times. Removing all unneeded plugins resulted in frame always being shown but the click never seems to happen.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I also tried Window Licker and the included Calculator test(s) - same thing... runs as a JUnit Test but fails as a JUnit Plugin Test. One time the frame was shown, but nothing happened (so the test failed). The other times, the frame didn&#39;t even show. Tried removing all VM args and unnecessary plugins.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Is this related to the args that Eclipse uses to run plugin tests on Mac? Or the core plugins included to run the tests? Or...?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Shaun.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, Dale Emery &lt;dale@&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi whoever you are,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi - thanks for your reply. I&#39;m actually using Alex Ruiz&#39;s FEST for our testing and it works quite well on Windows. With or without FEST on the Mac, I can&#39;t seem to get any UI tests to run. The initial frame/window comes up in some cases but I can&#39;t do much more than that. When running JUnit tests (again with or without FEST), I don&#39;t even see the frame.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;ve gone through what docs there are for FEST and have read the blog/article but I can&#39;t figure it out.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;ve used FEST to test Swing code on a toy project:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/dhemery/towers.dead\">https://github.com/dhemery/towers.dead</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Later I restarted the project and used WindowLicker instead:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/dhemery/Towers\">https://github.com/dhemery/Towers</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; It&#39;s been a while since I visited either project, but I think the (few) UI tests run. Neither version of the code does much, so there aren&#39;t many UI tests. The older one (which uses FEST) has more features and tests.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I wrote all of this code on Macs running Snow Leopard and Eclipse Ganymede. I haven&#39;t tried it on Lion or Helios.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Dale<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Dale Emery<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Consultant to software teams and leaders<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://dhemery.com\">http://dhemery.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
