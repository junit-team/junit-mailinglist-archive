Wouldn&#39;t method validate(DataObject) have to either return a\n&gt;boolean or perform the assertion itself?\n\nNot at all. The method is designed as &quot;validate this thing, if ok, let it\npass, if not throw a ValidationException).\nYou can find tons of method like that in the real world.\n(for example, :\nhttp://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.2/docs/api/java/security/AccessController\n.html#checkPermission(java.security.Permission)  )\n\n&gt;Of course, I assume that you prefer not to have an unsuccessful validation\n&gt;register as an error.\n\nWhy not? Your code below lacks the stack trace for debugging (A\nfail(Throwable) would probably be usefull here). Letting the error go all\nthe way up to the junit framework let me write even simpler tests. To me,\nit&#39;s the simplet thing that could work. I don&#39;t think it makes them hard to\nread, I got used pretty fast to the fact that if something throws inside a\ntest, the test will fail. I know other people on this list also work that\nway. This enable me to spend less time writing tests, and more time focusing\non what counts : what should I test and how to implement it. I don&#39;t like\nwriting asssertTrue(true) or lines like that, because I think they will\nconfuse the person who reads the code, like somebody else said. My tests are\nalways very simple: a couple of lines. Only basic understanding of how junit\nworks is needed in order to understand them. Yes, a validation error will\nshow as an error and not a failure in the runner. I personnaly don&#39;t make\nany difference between those 2. The unit test passed or it busted. If it&#39;s\nan error, it just indicates to me that an exception was thrown (other than\nAssertionFailedError) from the test method.\n\n&gt;try {\n&gt;    validate();\n&gt;}\n&gt;catch (ValidationException oops) {\n&gt;    fail(oops.toString());\n&gt;}\n&gt;Remember, folks: fail() is an assertion! Look at the code.\n\nOf course it does!:)\nI agree with Robert saying :\n&quot;So, code that dyamically counts assertions will count the above as having\nno assertions if it passes.&quot;\n\nThis would then be a &quot;false warning&quot;. Unless you are talking about static\nanaylis which I doubt. Please correct me if this is the case.\n\nI guess we just have a slightly different way of writing tests. Writing\ncompact tests look like obsfucation to some people while putting lot of\ndetails can look like... obsfucation to some other.  :)\n\nmathieu\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: J. B.

(Re: re - assert counting)\n\n\n&gt;re - assert countingFrom: Keith Ray\n&gt; &gt;As I said before, I would just want a warning when a test method is empty\n&gt;or has no asserts...\n&gt; &gt; but I don&#39;t want to go to the trouble of getting some code-coverage tool\n&gt;working.\n&gt;\n&gt;Interesting. But in my case I would have a lot of &quot;false warnings&quot; because\n&gt;I\n&gt;have a lot of methods that validate something and throw if it&#39;s invalid\n&gt;(but\n&gt;do nothing if valid, so return is void). The tests look like that :\n&gt;\n&gt;public void testAValidationTest() throws Exception {\n&gt;     validator.validate(VALID_DATA);\n&gt;}\n&gt;\n&gt;So, no asserts, but a perfectly valid test case.\n\nI disagree. Wouldn&#39;t method validate(DataObject) have to either return a\nboolean or perform the assertion itself? In the first case, you&#39;d have to\nwrite assertTrue(validator.validate()), or otherwise the assertTrue() would\nbe inside the method validate(). Either way, you&#39;re performing at least one\nassert.\n\nOf course, I assume that you prefer not to have an unsuccessful validation\nregister as an error. In the last case, you&#39;d write\n\ntry {\n    validate();\n}\ncatch (ValidationException oops) {\n    fail(oops.toString());\n}\n\nRemember, folks: fail() is an assertion!
