It is also pre-\nJDK 1.4 which means Assert.assert() and the assert keyword\nwill collide. The good news is it is easy to change Assert.assert()\nto Assert.assertTrue(). The bad news is I&#39;ve been fighting\nwith getting the preverifier to work for several days now\nwithout success. Perhaps success is just around the corner...\n\nMaybe you will have more luck. If you do, please let me know\nwhat the trick is! &lt;G&gt;\n\nhttp://www.xprogramming.com/ftp/TestingFramework/j2me/J2MEUnit1_0.zip\n-- \nThanks,\nDerek Lane\n=====================================\n--- The Gunslinger\nquikdraw@...\n\n\n\n",
