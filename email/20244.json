Write a test to manifest each reported bug before<br/>\n&gt; doing anything to fix it.  These will often be of the end-to-end or<br/>\n&gt; integration variety already recommended.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Besides accumulating a regression suite, this has a couple of other<br/>\n&gt; benefits.  First, bugs tend to occur in clusters, so you&#39;ll tend to<br/>\n&gt; accumulate the most tests for the most problematic code.    Second,<br/>\n&gt; the code that is the most problematic will probably also be the<br/>\n&gt; hardest to test, encouraging refactoring.  Again, focusing on bug<br/>\n&gt; hot-spots tends to focus your efforts where they&#39;re needed most.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Good hunting,<br/>\n&gt; Lance<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m starting to understand what the relationship is between designing<br/>\nand testing...<br/>\n<br/>\nSome weeks ago I read about a commercial testing tool that enables you<br/>\nto write interface(GUI)-tests through JUnit tests, it sounds quite<br/>\nstrange (to use JUnit for end-to-end/integration testing)...<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks, Lance<br/>\n  csaba</div>",
