I have written unit tests that range from a half dozen lines to tw=\r\no dozen lines. The shorter tests were for more easily tested things while t=\r\nhe longer tests were for the more complicated test setups.\n\nAssuming that y=\r\nou have factored out any duplicate environment setup code, then just accept=\r\n that some tests will be longer than others. My criteria as to whether it i=\r\ns a good test is whether it truely helps me find bugs in my code.\n\nSimon\n\n-=\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nSimon P.

The game has a specific set of tiles I want to \n&gt;c=\r\nreate in the program.\n&gt;\n&gt;I made the constructor of the Tile class private a=\r\nnd provided static \n&gt;makeTileXyz methods to create tiles.\n&gt;\n&gt;Now my test me=\r\nthods get quite large. Each of them assures that \n&gt;the tile \n&gt;has just (and=\r\n only) the requested features. So each test checks for \n&gt;special items on t=\r\nhe cards (e.g. isAbbey, isMarketsquare) and counts \n&gt;the roads coming in an=\r\nd the city parts a tile has.\n&gt;\n&gt;In addition tests get more complicated beca=\r\nuse tiles may be \n&gt;rotated in  \n&gt;the game. The test for makeRoadTurningLeft=\r\n  (ensure the tile shows a \n&gt;road turning left) has to check whether the ro=\r\nad goes south to west, \n&gt;west to north, north to east or east to south. In =\r\nthe end my tests are \n&gt;about 20 to 30 lines of code, but I was used to have=\r\n 5 liners in other \n&gt;projects.\n&gt;\n&gt;What do you think about this test case si=\r\nze?\n&gt;\n&gt;Would you create additional methods to help in testing, i.e. for \n&gt;c=\r\nounting the roads on one tile or a method like isSpecial?\n&gt;\n&gt;Would you plac=\r\ne such helpers in the test class (as they are only used \n&gt;for testing)? Doe=\r\ns that get to complex, i.e. do you eventually need \n&gt;test cases for your te=\r\nst cases?\n&gt;\n&gt;Would you rely on some orientation of created tiles, e.g. assu=\r\nme the \n&gt;left turning road is always constructed as from east turning to so=\r\nuth \n&gt;(maybe this is like the Blackbox / Whitebox discussion)?\n&gt;\n&gt;Would you=\r\n even allow incomplete tests (not testing what is \n&gt;&quot;most likely \n&gt;working&quot;=\r\n, e.g. assuming a tile does not have special items)?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Thanks for your c=\r\nomments.\n&gt;\n&gt;Robert\n&gt;\n&gt;------------------------ Yahoo!
