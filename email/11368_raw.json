I want to run &quot;testCommon&quot; first\n&gt;   which is in the &quot;BasicGetListTest&quot; but when I subclass it with\n&gt;   &quot;GlucoseGetListTest&quot; it is always executed last. I read some of\n&gt;   the postings in this newsgroup, but it seems that such kind of\n&gt;   requirement point a desing flaw and I should somehow rearrange my\n&gt;   Unit Test Structure to made the tests indepentdant. I&#39;m stuck with\n&gt;   it.\n\nI&#39;ve been thinking for a while that this is a serious problem in JUnit\n(and most unit testing frameworks), because it&#39;s been such an annoyance\nfor so many people. Let&#39;s face it; a lot of groups of tests do have\nknown dependencies between tests such that if test A fails, we know that\nthe output of tests B, C and D are uninteresting. Yet we end up running\nB, C and D anyway, and then searching through all the error output for\nthe failure that we know is the &quot;real&quot; one, ignoring all the others as\nspurious.\n\nI would really like a way to be able to express this dependency\ninformation to the test framework, so that I can get back the\ninteresting results with fewer uninteresting results. Can anybody\nthink of a good way to do this?\n\nPerhaps a method that returns an ordered list of sets of test names\nwould do the trick. The sets would be executed in order, with any\ntest cases not mentioned in any of the sets added to a last, implicit\nset, and should a test case fail in any set, the later sets would not\nbe executed at all, just noted as &quot;not executed due to dependency\nfailures.&quot; Perhaps:\n\n    class BaseTestCase {\n\tpublic String[][] dependencies() {\n\t    return [];\n\t}\n    }\n\n    class MyTest extends BaseTestCase {\n\tpublic String[] dependencies() {\n\t    return [\n\t\t[ &quot;testEverythingDependsOnMe&quot; ],\n\t\t[ &quot;testOne&quot;, &quot;testTwo&quot;, &quot;testThree&quot; ],\n\t\t[ &quot;testFour&quot; ]\n\t    ];\n\t}\n\t...\n    }\n\nThus, if testTwo breaks; testOne and testThree would still be run, but\ntestFour would not, since the developer has indicated that he&#39;s not\ninterested in the result in that case.\n\ncjs\n-- \nCurt Sampson  &lt;cjs@...&gt;   +81 90 7737 2974   http://www.NetBSD.org\n    Don&#39;t you know, in this new Dark Age, we&#39;re all light.  --XTC\n\n",
