I think some stuff from that could be useful at least to review how extensively different parts of the system get tested. Such as the ranges at which different program points are exercised. But Agitar seemed to aim for more than that.<div>\n<br></div><div>Never had a chance to try it in practice but I would guess you are right that there could be similar issues as with static analysis tools. Too much data to analyse, too many false positives, etc.</div><div>\n<br></div><div>I don&#39;t think test generation overall is a bad idea but maybe test generation based only on reverse engineering the implementation has some issues. Certainly it can provide some useful input though.<br>\n<div class=\"ygrps-yiv-1104771431gmail_extra\"><br><br><blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <div class=\"ygrps-yiv-1104771431gmail_quote\">On 1 February 2014 17:00, Malte Finsterwalder <span dir=\"ltr\">&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:malte@...\">malte@...</a>&gt;</span> wrote:<br>\n<blockquote class=\"ygrps-yiv-1104771431gmail_quote\" style=\"margin:0 0 0 .8ex;border-left:1px #ccc solid;padding-left:1ex;\">\n\n\n<u></u>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div style=\"\">\n<span>&nbsp;</span>\n\n\n<div>\n  <div>\n\n\n    <div>\n      \n      \n      <p></p><div dir=\"ltr\">Maybe you can check out agitar.
