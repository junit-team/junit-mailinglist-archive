I&#39;m a \nstudent and I&#39;m doing a research about how JUnit could be used in my \ncompany to improve the efficiency of software development. What my \nbosses, not knowing a lot about JUnit, only having heard of it, first \nwanted to have was a piece of software which tests an existing \napplication on a technical level. (like &quot;one Button tests all&quot;)\n\nFrom what I know now, JUnit is a framework for the developer to \nimprove the quality of the application and to avoid failures in the \ncode which might otherwise be overseen. Now here&#39;s my question: does \nit make sense to take an existing application and try to write test \ncases/suites for it? The application is a rather abstract one, it&#39;s a \nmiddleware component (API) between one big and several smaller \napplications, it consist of several EJBs with basically lots of get-\nMethods, using JAX-RPC SOAP and RMI. \n\nI doubt it makes sense, but I don&#39;t have a lot of experience about \nwhat JUnit is capable of and how the code would have to be refactored.\n\nI guess it would make more sense telling the developers why and how \nto use JUnit in order to improve things in FUTURE developments and to \nstick with the old code without JUnit. What do you think? \n\nThank you for your replies!\n\nPS: Sorry I can&#39;t give you more information about the application I \nwas talking about, I&#39;m still in the process of understanding how it \nworks and I&#39;m not a Java-pro (yet:-).\n\nGreetings from Germany,\nThomas\n\n\n\n\n\n",
