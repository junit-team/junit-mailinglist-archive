Spreadsheet application was a starting\npoint a=\r\nnd then we moved into a complicated J2EE example.\n\nThe problem in this cour=\r\nse setup is the amount of material\nparticipants have to swallow and tolerat=\r\ne and little technical details\nthat are coming into the game. Most of the p=\r\neople coming into theses\ncourses are not some J2EE or Struts gurus, which c=\r\nan easily work with\nany setup you offer in the course. They do some changes=\r\n now and then\nand some others are taking care of the rest. Environmental de=\r\ntails\nshouldn&#39;t block them from seeing the TDD benefits. They may even thin=\r\nk\nlater on that the course was all about the testing environment setup\nor s=\r\nomething really technical, but that shouldn&#39;t be the case!\n\nI&#39;m suggesting =\r\nthat TDD courses should stick with the simple examples\nlike spreadsheet. Th=\r\nis way the actual TDD idea is visible all the time\nand not the technical de=\r\ntails.\n\nOne problem still is that most professional programmers don&#39;t want =\r\nto\nspend time with trivial things like spreadsheet applications, if they\ndo=\r\nn&#39;t see some fundamental reasons for doing it. They want to see how\nall hap=\r\npends in their build environment and with same size projects\nthat they deal=\r\n with.\n\nThis means that you have to sell the idea with concrete examples an=\r\nd\nexperiences, before doing anything.\n\nTeppo\n\nOn 5/20/05, Mike Clark &lt;mike@=\r\nclarkware.com&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; How about Bill Wake&#39;s Spreadsheet idea &lt;http://ww=\r\nw.xp123.com/xplor/ \n&gt; &gt; xp0201/&gt;?\n&gt; \n&gt; Just to share what has worked well f=\r\nor me...\n&gt; \n&gt; In my TDD workshop we start with the Spreadsheet and then mov=\r\ne on to  \n&gt; a shopping cart application, just to give a couple different  \n=\r\n&gt; perspectives.
