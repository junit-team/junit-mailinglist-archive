That<br/>\n&gt;&gt;said, many testers and test suites (including myself and my suites, and<br/>\n&gt;&gt;apparently even some of JUnit&#39;s own suites) tend to gravitate toward one<br/>\n&gt;&gt;test class per tested class. This is a very common pattern, even if it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;&gt;one JUnit wasn&#39;t meant to support and one that causes test suites to<br/>\n&gt;&gt;take longer to run than they otherwise would.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;This does make me wonder if maybe JUnit has been cutting the wrong way<br/>\n&gt;&gt;all these years. Perhaps it should be designed to organize tests by<br/>\n&gt;&gt;model class rather than fixture. This certainly seems a lot more natural<br/>\n&gt;&gt;to a lot of developers.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; When a class has common code in two methods, we usually Extract Method.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; When a class has sets of methods that operate on two different parts of <br/>\n&gt; the class&#39; internal state, we usually split the class in two.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>   This sounds like theological design discussion and this list <br/>\nprobably not the best place for this. In any case I&#39;d say that you can <br/>\ndo above, but it is not always necessary that you should do that all <br/>\nthe time.<br/>\n<br/>\n   For instance, if you look at typical facade pattern, it is quite <br/>\noften that it would change different parts of the internal state but <br/>\nwe still need to test it as a single entity. I am pretty sure that <br/>\nfacade is not only case for this.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Why wouldn&#39;t we follow those rules with JUnit test case classes? The <br/>\n&gt; first rule extracts common setup code into setUp() and fixture objects. <br/>\n&gt; The second splits test case classes that have multiple fixtures into <br/>\n&gt; separate test case classes. This leads to test case classes organized <br/>\n&gt; around fixtures.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; As for one test case per model class, that&#39;s a natural place to start, <br/>\n&gt; because it&#39;s simple, but once that test case class becomes complex, <br/>\n&gt; refactor as usual.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>   That usually would lead to confusion and will require special tools <br/>\nto track down all the test cases for given class.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; To say that JUnit supports or doesn&#39;t support this way of organizing <br/>\n&gt; tests sounds odd to me. I don&#39;t organize my tests a certain way; I <br/>\n&gt; refactor the tests, and that&#39;s where they tend to end up.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>   By the way, I believe that such freely-organized test cases will be <br/>\naffected a lot when doing massive code refactorings and/or moving <br/>\nthings around classses. So, I&#39;d say it is always a tread off and has <br/>\nto be considered in a case by case base.<br/>\n<br/>\n   regards,<br/>\n   Eugene</div>",
