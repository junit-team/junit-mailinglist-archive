Granted this is my idea=\r\nl\n&gt; environment.\n&gt;\n&gt; What about a 2 stage interview? One where they write t=\r\nhe tests for a already\n&gt; existing piece of code (maybe to increase the code=\r\ns functionality), then\n&gt; another where they try and write code to get the t=\r\nests to pass. =A0Granted\n&gt; this is not testing if they actually use TDD, bu=\r\nt it would show if they have\n&gt; the skill. =A0Maybe forcing the iteration pr=\r\nocess of test -&gt; functionality -&gt;\n&gt; test -&gt; functionality will show if they=\r\n have the skill.\n&gt;\n&gt; I think spending some time, 2-3 hours with a machine, =\r\nlater in the interview\n&gt; process, say after a phone screen, maybe second ro=\r\nund of face to face, might\n&gt; pay dividends in the quality of people on a te=\r\nam. =A0Then again it might\n&gt; depend on how skilled you need this individual=\r\n to be.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks for the input,\n&gt;\n&gt; Big Mike\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text po=\r\nrtions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; -------------------------=\r\n-----------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
