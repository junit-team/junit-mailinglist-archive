They generally will print<br/>\nout results, rather than asserting the truth.  The automatic behavior in<br/>\nunit tests is key.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) Inevitably, as you write hundreds of tests, you find commonality, which<br/>\nshould be refactored out into supporting classes.  Junit has already done<br/>\nthis, to some degree, for you.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Yishay Mor&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ymor@...\">ymor@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Sunday, June 10, 2001 6:02 PM<br/>\nSubject: [junit] Why bother?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Help me out, please -<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m trying to &quot;market&quot; JUnit to my team. The most common objection I get<br/>\ngoes along the line of &quot;what advantage will I get out of this, when writing<br/>\nmy code? I have my test class, w/ its main(..) method, and that&#39;s all I<br/>\nneed.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; Even though people are willing to see the advantage of a unit testing<br/>\nframework for the long term project development, that want to see &quot;personal<br/>\nvalue&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
