[...]\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; minimizes the length of names where possible ([...]).\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Using this and other techniques they typically shrink\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Java code by well over 50% for a small one-time cost\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in terms of computer cycles (it takes about 4 minutes\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to process 3.8 MB of code on an 800 MHz PC).\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; That&#39;s an interesting assertion.  I&#39;m not sure that I\n&gt;&gt;&gt; can relate it to the presence or absence of comments,\n&gt;&gt;&gt; particularly since comments don&#39;t end up in the compiled\n&gt;&gt;&gt; code.\n\n&gt;--- Jim Dixon &lt;jdd@d...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; Of course.  But one of the subthreads in this discussion\n&gt;&gt; is that comments can be made unnecessary by, for example,\n&gt;&gt; appropriate choice of variable/method/class/etc names.\n&gt;&gt; This is something that we all do, I imagine.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; But the longer and more meaningful the names, the slower\n&gt;&gt; the code ;-)\n\n--- Ron Jeffries &lt;ronjeffries@X...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; In what language is this true, and why?\n\n\nIt&#39;s easy to see how, in Java and .Net, longer and more meaningful \nmethod, parameter and [in Java] local variable names can \nincrease &quot;compiled&quot; class sizes, and hence load time.  These \nlanguages include a significant amount of metadata (&quot;source code&quot; \ninformation) in their &quot;compiled&quot; class files.  Therefore, longer \nnames will cause some slight increase in the time needed to read the \nfiles, download the &quot;executable&quot; code across a slow network, and \npossibly even the time needed to process the &quot;code&quot; once loaded.  \n(Though that last point is questionable, unless the machine is so low \non memory that it must resort to paging to process &quot;in memory&quot; data.)\n\nHowever, in most applications, run time is much longer than load \ntime, and the Just In Time (JIT) Java compilers will render symbol \nname length irrelevant as they translate to machine code.\n\nOf course, there&#39;s still some cost, in memory, to maintaining all \nthis reflection / &quot;linker&quot; / &quot;debugger&quot; symbolic information in \nmemory.  But I don&#39;t see any reason to be concerned about it unless \noverall measurements of actual application performance indicate that \nthere&#39;s a problem.  And if there is a real performance issue, we can \ncertainly use tools, such as the IBM tools mentioned above, to \neliminate much of this extraneous and unnecessary debugging \ninformation from the production builds.\n\n\n\n",
