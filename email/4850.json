Which is nothing new :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nI was thinking of a method returning one different flag per path.  So <br/>\nthe easiest way to check if you have gone through all paths is to [1].<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; However, do you really need to know which path the code took?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>you only need to be certain that you tested all paths.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Isn&#39;t it sufficient to test that you get the correct return value for <br/>\n&gt; whatever combinations of input values you choose to test with?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>yes and no.  writing tests does not guarantee that you have tested all <br/>\npaths.  And since it&#39;s impossible to test every input values, a good <br/>\nalternative is to choose the input value that give you the most feedback.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Vladimir<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nVladimir Bossicard<br/>\nwww.bossicard.com</div>",
