I&#39;ve never heard of Quartz before this\nthread.  My tests have to do with a proprietary code library that\nschedules future activities according to a variety of possible\nscheduling schemes.\n\nI imagine that the same sorts of things are hard when using Quartz as\nwhen using to other multi-threaded systems that schedule activities\nbased on the system time.  (That&#39;s what Quartz does, right?  I&#39;m afraid\nI don&#39;t still have the original message, and I didn&#39;t read it very\ncarefully.)\n\nIf Quartz interacts with the system time directly, it would have to be\nmodified to go through the Clock interface instead ... given that,\nthough, it ought to work.\n\nCheers,\n\nbn\n\n-- \nBrett Neumeier &lt;random@...&gt;\n\n\n",
