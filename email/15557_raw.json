I worked with Kent and Erich on the \nparameterized support, so here&#39;s my utterly non-binding thoughts:\n\nIn general, I&#39;m a fan of the Kent and Erich&#39;s plan to keep JUnit 4.0 as \nsimple as possible, while still allowing impressive amounts of \nextension.  To that end, it would be great to have a third party work on \na souped-up parameterized test runner with features like you mention here.\n\nI wrote a separate runner a while back that parameterizes tests by \nmethod, but felt ambivalent about it--it was very different from how \nparameterized tests had been done in JUnit 3, and I hadn&#39;t really wanted \nit yet in my own development, so I wasn&#39;t sure I&#39;d gotten it &quot;right&quot;, \nand I didn&#39;t submit it to Kent.  However, you&#39;re not the first to \nrequest it.  In any case, do you really want to have parameters on both \nthe class and the methods?  That seems really complex.\n\n&gt;         // In actual code, these would probably be enums, in my\n&gt; experience -\n&gt;         // they would provide mechanisms for connecting to the\n&gt; appropriate database,\n&gt;         // setting it up and tearing it down etc.\n&gt;         public static String[] classParameters = {&quot;Oracle&quot;, &quot;SQL&quot;};\n\nUsing an enum to contain the parameters is a cool idea.  Would it be \nmuch easier than\n@Parameters public static List&lt;DbType&gt; parameters() { return \nDbType.values() }?\n\n&gt;         @Test\n&gt;         @Parameters(strings={&quot;hello&quot;, &quot;there&quot;})\n&gt;         public void test3(String input)\n&gt;         {\n&gt;             assertEquals(input, input.toLowerCase());\n&gt;         }\n\nI like that a lot.\n\n&gt; 2) Unless multiple parameters are required, a single array (rather than\n&gt; an array of arrays) causes less confusion. I know that the\n&gt; counter-argument to that is that having two forms, one for\n&gt; single-parameter tests/constructors and one for multi-parameter\n&gt; tests/constructors is ugly, but I personally believe that it&#39;s justified\n&gt; in this case.\n\nI like your case here.\n\nFor the rest of your features, I think they&#39;re cool.  I&#39;d like to see a \nrunner that did them, and play with it a while.\n\n&gt; 5) One nasty problem: you need to construct instances of the test class\n&gt; just to count the test cases - and hope that the parameters you get back\n&gt; then is the same as the ones you get when you&#39;re ready to run the tests.\n&gt; (You could cache the results, of course...)\n\nThat&#39;s a rough problem.  In general, I think that runners should avoid \nconstructing instances in order to count test cases.  Do you think it&#39;s \nworth it?\n\n&gt; Anyway, the bottom line is that I can see *huge* benefits in this\n&gt; approach in quite a few of our existing test code. Does anyone have any\n&gt; major objections to the above, or shall I give it a whirl?\n\nAbsolutely give it a whirl.\n\n    David Saff\n\n",
