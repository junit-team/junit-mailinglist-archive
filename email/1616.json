Changing too much jeopardizes stableness.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The major complains users have do not target the framework but the swing<br/>\nor text interface.  Adding functionalities like &quot;managing the non-loaded<br/>\nclasses&quot; via properties do not add (too much) complexity to the<br/>\nframework.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; - When adding too much non-core functionality one quickly looses focus of<br/>\n&gt; the core parts. Very often the extra functionality is not exactly what I<br/>\n&gt; need in a specific situation, so I have to reimplement it anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Share your work!  If you write things you thing is really interesting,<br/>\nshare it!  Don&#39;t expect 2-3 people to have the solution for every<br/>\nproblem you encounter :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; That&#39;s why I&#39;d rather have JUnit as a core with hooks to plug in <br/>\n&gt; additional behaviour which is available in additional tools.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I partially agree.  If you have too many additional tools to run a<br/>\nprogram, you will have conflicts with versions.  I think that JUnit must<br/>\nhave a framework, a swing interface and a text interface.<br/>\n<br/>\nI proposed the architecture of &quot;plug-in&quot; modules that will enable other<br/>\nprogrammers to write specific &quot;TestResult&quot; modules (using XML,<br/>\ndatabases, mail to store the results).  This won&#39;t add complexity to<br/>\nJUnit and allow a great flexibility.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m working on to implement it for the 4.0 version.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Vladimir</div>",
