In fact, it looks like it isn&#39;t a JVM\n&gt; defect, but bug in the Linux glibc/pthread libraries. It only affects\n&gt; the results of System.exit, so it&#39;s not even a fatal bug for JUnit. The\n&gt; *only* thing that doesn&#39;t work is the exit codes.\n&gt;\n&gt; Since the the two failures reported in:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www.egroups.com/message/junit/257\n&gt;\n&gt; are identical to those in:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www.egroups.com/message/junit/108\n&gt;\n&gt; I took the leap of assuming they are caused by the same underlying\n&gt; problem. The bug was initially claimed to be in libc.so 2.2, but not in\n&gt; 2.1.2 which is the default RedHat libc so I could be wrong. Later data\n&gt; (January 10 of this year) suggests that libpthread-0.9 is the culprit.\n&gt;\n&gt; The JVM defect was discussed in:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www.egroups.com/message/junit/113\n&gt;\n&gt; and is listed at Sun:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/bugParade/bugs/4388732.html\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt;\n&gt; Rob\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; Yahoo!
