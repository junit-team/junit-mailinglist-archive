It\nrequires you to put your tes=\r\nts in a suite, add the rule on the suite and\nannotate the rule for propagat=\r\nion to all sub-suites and tests.\n\nI&#39;m not sure this is exactely what you wa=\r\nnt, but if it is, you can help by\nvoting it up it might make it to some fut=\r\nure release of JUnit. :-)\n\nCheers\nDaniel\n\nOn Fri, Dec 4, 2009 at 4:34 PM, B=\r\nogdan &lt;\nbogdan.mocanu.notifications@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi everyone,\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; as we have it currently, we can place a Rule in a test, and that rule wi=\r\nll\n&gt; be activated for that test. To have the rule working in several tests,=\r\n you\n&gt; have to place the Rule in each test.\n&gt;\n&gt; However, I am searching for=\r\n a way to activate a Rule for all the tests that\n&gt; are executed, without ne=\r\neding to add the rule to each test. Perhaps by\n&gt; specifying a Java property=\r\n parameter when running the tests (I could also\n&gt; set this as a global Java=\r\n option, therefore being used upon each execution\n&gt; of the JVM).\n&gt;\n&gt; Do you=\r\n know if this is possible?\n&gt;\n&gt; The reason why I need this, is: I am making =\r\nthe plans and gathering the\n&gt; ideas for creating a simple Swing application=\r\n that will display the results\n&gt; of the executed tests (just like the JUnit=\r\n view in Eclipse/Idea/Netbeans,\n&gt; but perhaps with more details, and also a=\r\nvailable for anyone, not just IDE\n&gt; users). Currently I developed a small a=\r\ngent rule, that you can place in your\n&gt; test, and it will report to the con=\r\nsole the status of your tests (the Swing\n&gt; console runs remotely).\n&gt;\n&gt; This=\r\n is ok, but it means that you will have to add this rule to each and\n&gt; ever=\r\ny test that you have. It also means that will not be an easy task to\n&gt; disa=\r\nble this rule, if you don&#39;t want it anymore.\n&gt;\n&gt; Therefore a possibility to=\r\n enable Rules globally for all tests I think is\n&gt; the best solution for my =\r\ncase, and also a good tool to have for various\n&gt; other tasks.\n&gt;\n&gt; What do y=\r\nou think? Also, what do you think about the Swing console idea?\n&gt;\n&gt; Cheers,=\r\n\n&gt; Bogdan\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n\n-- \n--------------------------------------------------=\r\n-------\nDaniel Brolund\nAgical AB - www.agical.com\n\nwork: daniel.brolund@agi=\r\ncal.com\nphone: +46708754002\nblog:http://danielbrolund.wordpress.com\ntwitter=\r\n: @danielbrolund\nprivate: daniel.brolund@...\n\n\n[Non-text portions of =\r\nthis message have been removed]\n\n\n",
