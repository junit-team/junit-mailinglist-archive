Sorry if\nthis has already been rehashed a hundred times, but I was wrestling with\nthis a lot myself, and despite reading the Wiki threads on this, I still\ndon&#39;t have a good &#39;pattern&#39; to use... \n\nThe example from my case was a class, KeyAuthenticator, with a method\nValidate(). Validate calls several internal methods to check hashcodes,\ntimestamps, etc. but the client shouldn&#39;t really need to know about any of\nthat. The problem was that the methods for checking hashcodes and timestamps\nwere the parts that needed the most testing...\n\npublic class KeyAuthenticator {\n\t//... instance variables etc...\n\tpublic bool Validate() {\n\t\tif (!CheckTimestamp()) return false;\n\t\tif (!CheckHash()) return false;\n\t\treturn true;\n\t}\n\n\tprivate bool CheckTimestamp() {\n\t\t//... timestamp math\n\t}\t\n\t\n\tprivate bool CheckHash() {\n\t\t//... MD5 hash comparison\n\t}\n\n} \n\nLeaving out the backdoor reflection approach for the moment, the choices\nseemed to be:\n\n1) &quot;pollute&quot; the interface by making methods public that should be private.\nSome argue that this is the correct thing to do, but generally accepted\nprinciples of good design seem to require making your public interface as\nminimal as possible.\n\n2) Only test the public interface, perhaps giving up detailed testing of\ninternal logic.\nThe argument for this is that if the internal logic can&#39;t be easily tested\nthrough exercising the public API, then you should theoretically be able to\nget rid of all the &#39;untestable&#39; code, since it can&#39;t ever be reached...\nSomehow to me (as an admitted TDD newbie), it just seemed better to be able\nto bang on these internal methods directly, rather than relying on the\npublic methods to access them. It seems easier and cleaner to test a method\nin isolation than to try to test it only via it&#39;s caller... \n\n3) Make more classes... change the private methods into public methods of\nnew simple classes. \nTo use the example above, I could create a &#39;KeyHash&#39; class and a\n&#39;KeyTimestamp&#39; class, then have each of these expose public methods...\nperhaps this is the best refactoring, but it seemed to me to cause a\nprofusion of one-method classes...\n\n4) Make the methods &#39;protected&#39;, have your Test class inherit from your\nclass under test.\nThis does work, however having a bunch of protected methods in your class\ninterface could give the impression to future users that the class was\ndesigned to be inherited from, which is not really true in this case...\n\nI&#39;d love to hear the group&#39;s thoughts...\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nHenry Stapp\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: noreply@...
