I&#39;ve reviewed many of the messages \n&gt;in this archive and in the extreme progrogramming group archive.  I \n&gt;haven&#39;t been able to find any Testing Standards besides those \n&gt;compiled in the &quot;JUnit Best Practices&quot; article.  Are there any \n&gt;standards for validation or any general standards that anyone has \n&gt;incorporated in their own projects?  The thought behind this is by \n&gt;alligning everyone into some basic testing standards we can document \n&gt;the process and use it as a requirements doc.\n\nTesting standards are specific to every team that does testing. Your team\nprobably should write up recommendations (or &quot;standards&quot;), but your team&#39;s\nrequirements would be different than another team.\n\nExtreme Programming states that you should ask yourself &quot;what could possibly\ngo wrong&quot; when you are writing code test-first. If you are writing satellite\nsoftware, and are concerned that gamma rays will corrupt memory, then your\ndefinition of &quot;possibly go wrong&quot; are different from someone writing a\nsimple game.\n\n\r\n------_=_NextPart_001_01C0C2AE.ED9F1DE0\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;\n&lt;HEAD&gt;\n&lt;META HTTP-=\r\nEQUIV=3D&quot;Content-Type&quot; CONTENT=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Diso-8859-1&quot;&gt;\n&lt;META N=\r\nAME=3D&quot;Generator&quot; CONTENT=3D&quot;MS Exchange Server version 5.5.2653.12&quot;&gt;\n&lt;TITL=\r\nE&gt;JUnit Testing Standards&lt;/TITLE&gt;\n&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY&gt;\n\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=3D2&gt;&gt;&nb=\r\nsp;&nbsp; Date: Wed, 11 Apr 2001 14:01:16 -0000&lt;/FONT&gt;\n&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=3D2&gt;&=\r\ngt;&nbsp;&nbsp; From: nixj14@...&lt;/FONT&gt;\n&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=3D2&gt;&gt;Subj=\r\nect: JUnit Testing Standards&lt;/FONT&gt;\n&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=3D2&gt;&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;\n&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FON=\r\nT SIZE=3D2&gt;&gt;I&#39;ve been placed in charge of learning the concepts of JUnit=\r\n and &lt;/FONT&gt;\n&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=3D2&gt;&gt;reporting them back to our team.&nbsp; =\r\nI&#39;ve reviewed many of the messages &lt;/FONT&gt;\n&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=3D2&gt;&gt;in this a=\r\nrchive and in the extreme progrogramming group archive.&nbsp; I &lt;/FONT&gt;\n&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=3D2&gt;&gt;haven&#39;t been able to find any Testing Standards besides=\r\n those &lt;/FONT&gt;\n&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=3D2&gt;&gt;compiled in the &quot;JUnit Best Prac=\r\ntices&quot; article.&nbsp; Are there any &lt;/FONT&gt;\n&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=3D2&gt;&gt;sta=\r\nndards for validation or any general standards that anyone has &lt;/FONT&gt;\n&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&lt;FONT SIZE=3D2&gt;&gt;incorporated in their own projects?&nbsp; The thought be=\r\nhind this is by &lt;/FONT&gt;\n&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=3D2&gt;&gt;alligning everyone into some=\r\n basic testing standards we can document &lt;/FONT&gt;\n&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=3D2&gt;&gt;the=\r\n process and use it as a requirements doc.&lt;/FONT&gt;\n&lt;/P&gt;\n\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=3D2&gt;T=\r\nesting standards are specific to every team that does testing.
