To have the rule working in sever=\r\nal tests, you have to place the Rule in each test.\n\nHowever, I am searching=\r\n for a way to activate a Rule for all the tests that are executed, without =\r\nneeding to add the rule to each test. Perhaps by specifying a Java property=\r\n parameter when running the tests (I could also set this as a global Java o=\r\nption, therefore being used upon each execution of the JVM). \n\nDo you know =\r\nif this is possible?\n\nThe reason why I need this, is: I am making the plans=\r\n and gathering the ideas for creating a simple Swing application that will =\r\ndisplay the results of the executed tests (just like the JUnit view in Ecli=\r\npse/Idea/Netbeans, but perhaps with more details, and also available for an=\r\nyone, not just IDE users). Currently I developed a small agent rule, that y=\r\nou can place in your test, and it will report to the console the status of =\r\nyour tests (the Swing console runs remotely).\n\nThis is ok, but it means tha=\r\nt you will have to add this rule to each and every test that you have. It a=\r\nlso means that will not be an easy task to disable this rule, if you don&#39;t =\r\nwant it anymore.\n\nTherefore a possibility to enable Rules globally for all =\r\ntests I think is the best solution for my case, and also a good tool to hav=\r\ne for various other tasks.\n\nWhat do you think? Also, what do you think abou=\r\nt the Swing console idea?\n\nCheers,\nBogdan\n\n\n",
