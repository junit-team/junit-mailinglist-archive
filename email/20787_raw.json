However, when I tried to use it I would\nstill get the same problem that I started this thread with.\n\nFrom what I can tell by looking at the FEST source is that FEST still\nqueries the table from whichever thread it is being called from.  This again\nbrings me back to my problem: How do I query the table that gets modified on\nthe EDT thread from a junit thread.\n\nI ultimately ended up using SwingUtilities.invokeAndWait using a final int\narray that stores the number of rows in the table.  I then use an assert\nafter the invoteAndWait on this final int array to make sure the number of\nrows is correct.\n\nOne other thing, so happens when I finally got around to your suggestion and\nlooked at FEST, you had taken out the GuiTask class!  I finally figured it\nout and noticed too that you are adding a whole lot of queries that get run\nin the EDT thread.  So far I really like what I see with FEST and will\ncontinue to use it.\n\nThanks for the suggestions and keep up the good work!\nAaron\n\n\nAlex Ruiz wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; Hi Aaron,\n&gt; \n&gt; My suggestion is either:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. Use FEST ( http://fest.easytesting.org/swing ) to\n&gt; test your GUIs. FEST is a library provides a compact,\n&gt; intuitive and easy-to-use API that makes GUI testing\n&gt; easy (disclaimer: I&#39;m the creator of FEST.)\n&gt; \n&gt; 2. If you decide not to use FEST, you can still use\n&gt; FEST&#39;s GuiTask to solve your problem. Since FEST is\n&gt; open source and under the Apache 2.0 license, you can\n&gt; copy the source of GuiTask. Please note that GuiTask\n&gt; uses invokeAndWait instead of invokeLater. IMHO, most\n&gt; of the time in your test you need to wait for an\n&gt; action to be executed in the EDT before you can\n&gt; continue the execution of your test. You can find the\n&gt; code for GuiTask at\n&gt; http://code.google.com/p/fest/source/browse/trunk/fest/fest-swing/src/main/java/org/fest/swing/core/GuiTask.java\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; -Alex\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- hybrid180 &lt;aaron@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Hi,\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; I am actually relatively new to Junit testing and I\n&gt;&gt; have a quick question\n&gt;&gt; about running tests on two different threads.  I am\n&gt;&gt; trying to verify that\n&gt;&gt; something is done on the swing thread with a junit\n&gt;&gt; test.  For example the\n&gt;&gt; following:\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \t\tSwingUtilities.invokeLater(new Runnable(){\n&gt;&gt; \t\t\tpublic void run() {\n&gt;&gt; \t\t\t\tassertEquals(2, tableModel.getRowCount());\n&gt;&gt; \t\t\t};\n&gt;&gt; \t\t\t\n&gt;&gt; \t\t});\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; When this test actually fails I&#39;ve noticed an\n&gt;&gt; AssertionError exception is\n&gt;&gt; thrown on the Swing thread but the test overall\n&gt;&gt; still passes.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; My question is this: is there a way to make the test\n&gt;&gt; not pass when this\n&gt;&gt; assert fails?  Or at least throw the AssertionError\n&gt;&gt; on the Junit thread\n&gt;&gt; instead of the Swing thread?\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Thanks for any help,\n&gt;&gt; Aaron\n&gt;&gt; -- \n&gt;&gt; View this message in context:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; http://www.nabble.com/Testing-on-AWT-thread-tp18876848p18876848.html\n&gt;&gt; Sent from the JUnit - User mailing list archive at\n&gt;&gt; Nabble.com.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;       \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n-- \nView this message in context: http://www.nabble.com/Testing-on-AWT-thread-tp18876848p18918286.html\nSent from the JUnit - User mailing list archive at Nabble.com.\n\n\n",
