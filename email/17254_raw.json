However, trying to filter on\n&gt; more than one method doesn&#39;t seem to be intuitively obvious, and\n&gt; nothing really seems to work.\n&gt; \n&gt; The code I use to get one test to run is as follows (it&#39;s from the\n&gt; test class&#39;s main() method):\n&gt;     JUnitCore core = new JUnitCore();\n&gt;     Request testRequest = Request.method(aTestClass, someArguments[0]);\n&gt;     core.run(testRequest);\n&gt; \n&gt; I have no idea how to extend this model to being able to specify\n&gt; multiple methods, however.\n&gt; \n&gt; In addition, I really hope that someone starts documenting all of the\n&gt; nifty new features in JUnit 4.x - the current level is somewhat\n&gt; (frustratingly) incomplete. The basic features have been covered by a\n&gt; number of writers - the more complex, such as this issue, still seem\n&gt; to be missing.\n&gt; \n&gt; I think JUnit has the potential to become even more popular with a\n&gt; clearer examination of the framework on which it is built. There seems\n&gt; to be a great deal of power and flexibility available - it&#39;s just\n&gt; really unclear as to how to get at it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks in advance!\n&gt; \n&gt; Michael Schechter\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In junit@yahoogroups.com, David Saff &lt;saff@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; Shannon,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; You are right--this doesn&#39;t currently work in JUnit 4.1.  Could you\n&gt; open \n&gt;&gt; a tracker issue on the sourceforge page, and we&#39;ll see if this can be \n&gt;&gt; remedied in a future version?  Thanks,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;     David Saff\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Shannon wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Greetings,\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; I&#39;m trying to filter a JUnit 3.8x test case class using the 4.1\n&gt;&gt;&gt; runner, so that only one of the test methods in the class is run and\n&gt;&gt;&gt; the others are ignored. I create and run the test like this:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Request r = Request.method(OldStyleTestCase.class, &quot;testSomeMethod&quot;);\n&gt;&gt;&gt; jcore.run(r);\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; The outcome is that all test methods are run, not just the one test\n&gt;&gt;&gt; method I specified. I also tried using a custom filter, but the filter\n&gt;&gt;&gt; never gets called because the runner for this class is\n&gt;&gt;&gt; org.junit.internal.runners.OldTestClassRunner which does not implement\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Filter.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Do I need to write my own runner to get this to work? Is there another\n&gt;&gt;&gt; work around?\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks for any help.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; /Shannon\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo!
