Deserialization? or using \n&gt; the deserialized object? Both? \n\nThe later (is that the right answer?) I am trying to test some behaviour\nthat requires the services of some other class &quot;A&quot;, my problem with faking\n&quot;A&quot; is that there are (potentially) lots of methods within &quot;A&quot; that I might\nlike to use within the behaviour under test/implementation.  If I go the\nfake route (which I do reasonably regularly) then I have to fake *all* of\nthe methods that I am interested in, granted I can produce a whole host of\nfactory methods to create these fakes (and have for certain classes and\nuses) but in this instance there appears to be a lot of extra work here for\nnot much gain, especially when there is a real risk that my fake *might*\nintroduce some assumption that is clearly wrong, or an assumption that was\ncorrect until I changed the actual implementation of &quot;A&quot; for some other fix.\nI have already been biten by this (which probably says more about me than it\nshould...) and spent longer than I wished tracking down the fault in some\nproduction code.\n\nI have a number of deserialisation tests for those classes being\ndeserialised - so that&#39;s not what I am testing here.  I am simply using the\nfact that I &quot;know&quot; I have a &quot;working&quot; deserialisation process on some class\n&quot;A&quot; to speed up my test creation process.  It is much easier to data-scrape\nan objects serialised form from a log file and use an object constructed\nfrom that within my test than to fake it.  At least when using a\ndeserialised instance, I am using a first class object with no assumptions\nhardcoded (other than those within the class itself).  I do concede that I\nam coding assumptions via the data that the object is being populated from.\n\n&gt; (Do you get the hint in the question?)\nNot today, my brain hurts thanks to &quot;young-children-not-sleeping-syndrome&quot;.\n\nMy gut feeling is, as the other responder suggested, to do both and chose\nthe appropriate form for the situation currently being worked upon.\n\nJonathan\n\n",
