But since we&#39;re already in this territory...\n\nI recently had the great pleasure of reading the entirety of DeMarco and \nLister&#39;s _Peopleware_ in a single day (half of it on the beach, no \nless).  One idea from the book really struck me.  I don&#39;t remember the \nexact wording, so I&#39;ll inaccurately paraphrase it: &quot;companies that \nmerely want to keep their best customers can make do with less quality \nthan those that want to keep their best employees.&quot;  Customers only want \ngood-enough products.  Your best employees are only really satisfied \nwith rock-solid products that they&#39;re proud to show their kids.  Of \ncourse, companies that begin losing their best employees won&#39;t be able \nto keep their best customers forever...\n\nThis is a provocative statement, and I&#39;m not sure if I really believe it \nyet.  If it is true, then how does this impact how we think about \nsoftware testing?\n\n    David Saff\n\n",
