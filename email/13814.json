This makes it easy to run localised tests.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>In my experience, it doesn&#39;t. It does, however, make it /look/ like it&#39;s <br/>\neasy to find tests that may be affected by a feature change. You really <br/>\ndon&#39;t know until you run the tests, anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Having tests scattered all over the place means that you tend to need to<br/>\n&gt; run all tests to make sure that a change hasn&#39;t introduced a bug. If your<br/>\n&gt; tests take a long time to run, you won&#39;t be inclined to do this.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s just plain lazy. To anyone who says &quot;I don&#39;t want to run all <br/>\nthese tests,&quot; I have to ask, &quot;Then why did you write them?!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; So... the need to keep test code in one class is proportional to the length<br/>\n&gt; of time it takes your tests to run. Hmmm - another reason to try to keep<br/>\n&gt; tests running fast. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Indeed. On the other hand, there are strong reasons to let test fixtures <br/>\norganize themselves along different lines, but that gets back to the <br/>\nquestion of the value of setUp()/tearDown(), so I won&#39;t bother going <br/>\nthere. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; (I use the TextXsomesuffix pattern as well... e.g. TestXDB for database<br/>\n&gt; dependent tests)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Allow me, M. Beust !<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;That&#39;s just another great reason for test groups....&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n:)<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
