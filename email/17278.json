I avoided taking that route before since<br/>\n&gt; &lt;junit&gt; and &lt;junitreport&gt; were such an improvement over what I had<br/>\n&gt; originally. However (I think) I have run up against a limitation of<br/>\n&gt; the &lt;junit&gt; task which makes me revisit this solution. The &lt;junit&gt;<br/>\n&gt; task isn&#39;t working for me because it won&#39;t allow you to control how<br/>\n&gt; much exception stack trace information is kept for each failure. I<br/>\n&gt; only want to see the first line or two (the only really useful info in<br/>\n&gt; the exception stack), but I want to limit the amount of exceptions<br/>\n&gt; that are reported because I appear to be running out of memory when I<br/>\n&gt; run a full test suite of over 80 tests. This never happened before I<br/>\n&gt; started using Ant/&lt;junit&gt;/&lt;junitreport&gt;, and my assumption is that the<br/>\n&gt; exception stacks for each failure are being kept in memory by the<br/>\n&gt; &lt;junit&gt; task, which is expecting to write all of the info to XML once<br/>\n&gt; the suite completes. Unfortunately after so many failures the<br/>\n&gt; exception stack info being held in memory is so much that the program<br/>\n&gt; crashes with an out-of-memory error. Is my assumption correct? Will<br/>\n&gt; the TestListener approach help me?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Using your own TestListener won&#39;t solve the OutOfMemory problem, <br/>\nalthough it might delay the problem a bit further, unless, of course, <br/>\nyou use the TestListener to write all that information out to disk <br/>\nfirst, then after running the tests, read that back from disk to process it.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ.
