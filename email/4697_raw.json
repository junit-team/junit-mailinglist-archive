Standardization is generally a good thing... Using JUnit will begin some standard practice of unit testing in your organization\n\n2. Ease of use\n\n3. AUTOMATED,AUTOMATED,AUTOMATED,AUTOMATED,AUTOMATED,AUTOMATED,AUTOMATED,AUTOMATED,AUTOMATED,AUTOMATED!\n\n4. JUnit is also (by de facto) a standard for unit testing in the Java world (also, it&#39;s easily integrateable with Ant)\n\n5. Related to #2, because it is so easy to use, it may not be such a hard thing to get developers to write tests.  Tests tend to be written as after thoughts and not as part of general development; because of this the tests are generally harder to write and thus never written.  And, if they are written, they tend to be incomplete!\n\n6. Related to #3, because it is so easy to use, developers may not be so hesitant to write tests *as they go along*, helping to enforce good design.\n\nThere are many more reasons.  Most, are just reasons for writing unit tests in general.  I don&#39;t know how anyone can stand to develop any other way!  I know I can&#39;t!\n\n=jason\n\nOn Wed, 17 Apr 2002 17:08:11 +0530, arathi.bhaskar@... said:\n&gt; This message only has an HTML part -- this is a text generated representation\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;    Hi\n&gt;    I am familiar with Junit for a month or two month. I have also started\n&gt;    to\n&gt;    look into Cactus project for servlet testing. I am one of the very few\n&gt;    people in the organization to know about this & want to share Junit&#39;s\n&gt;    features  &  advantages with others & convince them of its use. I have\n&gt;    tested\n&gt;    some Java programs with Junit. I gave a presentation to my managar, to\n&gt;    see\n&gt;    if we can pilot the use of Junit in some project.\n&gt;    Can someone tell me the real advantages of using Junit over the\n&gt;    individual&#39;s  own Unit testing of the Java Code written by him. I have\n&gt;    been\n&gt;    reading the articles posted on Junit homepage. Where can I find more\n&gt;    articles giving the advantages of Junit.\n&gt;    Thanks & Regards\n&gt;    Arathi\n&gt;    -----------------------Disclaimer------------------------\n&gt;    The views of the author may not necessarily reflect those\n&gt;    of the Company.
