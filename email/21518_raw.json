So I have a chicken egg sort of situation. NB would do the=\r\n obvious thing, i.e., have tests generated from code, so the above doesn&#39;t =\r\nmake any sense as it implies that the code is generated from the test, whic=\r\nh is a cool idea of the IDE could support it.\nI have experience using JUnit=\r\n, so the framework itself isn&#39;t in question, but how to apply this methodol=\r\nogy within the IDE format is.\nDo I have to simply short-circuit the default=\r\n process that NB and the JUnit plugin manufacture?\n\nthanks in advance for a=\r\nny help on this,\nKarl\n\n\n",
