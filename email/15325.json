I will continue to use it whether or not it is part of the <br/>\n&gt;&gt;framework.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So will I, but the huge advantage of putting it into an official junit<br/>\n&gt; release is that it gets promoted to the public, which in turn enables<br/>\n&gt; you to use it in various teams on various projects. Additionally, you<br/>\n&gt; (and many other people who like assertThat) don&#39;t have to<br/>\n&gt; write/maintain the same functionality everybody else is<br/>\n&gt; writing/maintaining too. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I agree with all you say but I also agree with Kent that JUnit should be <br/>\nthe bare minimum functionality. Overall, I come out +0. I would like to <br/>\nsee a commonly used constraints library that is independent of JMock.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt;I have also been experimenting with using &quot;should&quot; in the names of all <br/>\n&gt;&gt;my tests. I was quite surprised by the positive effect it had on the <br/>\n&gt;&gt;quality of my tests.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; That sounds interesting, how exactly do you use &quot;should&quot;? Could you<br/>\n&gt; give us some examples? How did it improve the quality of your tests?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>trivial example :<br/>\n<br/>\npublic void shouldThrowNullPointerException()<br/>\n<br/>\nrather than<br/>\n<br/>\npublic void testWithNullParameter()<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe name describes the result I am expecting rather than the steps I <br/>\ntake to cause the result.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI found that I was getting somewhat lazy when I wrote tests. Some tests <br/>\ntested more than they really should. Overall they lacked focus.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy working &quot;should&quot; into the name my tests became more results-oriented.<br/>\n<br/>\nKevin</div>",
