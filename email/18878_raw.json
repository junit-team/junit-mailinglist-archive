Testing trumps encapsulation\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Agreed.\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;   However, if I can cover (as measured with a coverage tool) the\n&gt;&gt;   private methods by calling public methods, I will do that rather than\n&gt;&gt;   test the private methods explicitly.\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Doesn&#39;t this implicitly imply that unit testing is optional, since you can\n&gt;achieve the same goal with functional tests?\n&gt;\n&gt;Functional tests are here for the user&#39;s comfort, unit tests are here for\n&gt;the programmer&#39;s comfort.  Sure, my coverage can tell me that a certain part\n&gt;of my application is tested indirectly, but if I don&#39;t have unit tests for\n&gt;them, locating the bug will be harder for me since there will be multiple\n&gt;suspects for the location of the bug.\n&gt;\n&gt;Consider the following example:  I have to display a sorted list in a web\n&gt;page, and I only have a functional test that verifies that the HTML is\n&gt;correct.  My coverage confirms that my ordering logic is run during the\n&gt;tests.  In this situation, the ordering logic is private and not directly\n&gt;tested.\n&gt;\n&gt;A user reports that the list is not sorted correctly, and now I find myself\n&gt;with at least two possible locations to investigate:  the HTML generation\n&gt;and the sorting logic.\n&gt;\n&gt;If I had written a test for the private sorting logic, I would know right\n&gt;away where the bug is.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nTrue enough, but there&#39;s no particular reason why the logic has to be \nprivate. I&#39;d be leery of a class that generates HTML and sorts. If the \nsort is an another class, it can be public and far easier to test.\n\nMichael Feathers\nwww.objectmentor.com\n\n\n",
