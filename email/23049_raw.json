They&#39;re currently grouped into &quot;testing frameworks&quot; like fro=\r\nntend tests, backend tests, rdbms, api, webservices, etc. The tests are run=\r\n through ant and these frameworks are just filesets that include or exclude=\r\n different file directories. This seems to work fine for us, as the reports=\r\n generated are per-class, so we can quickly know which class a specific tes=\r\nt case belongs to.\n\nThe reason I wanted to define my &quot;testing frameworks&quot; u=\r\nsing Categories or SuiteClasses is so that the group definition are closer =\r\nto the java code and developers are more in control as opposed to having to=\r\n manipulate the ant filesets.\n\nHowever, when creating a &quot;Frontend&quot; Suite al=\r\nl the test methods in the frontend test classes are shown in a single repor=\r\nt, so I don&#39;t know if testMethodA belongs to com.frontend.ClassATest or com=\r\n.frontend.ClassBTest.\n\nIs there a way to use Categories or SuiteClasses for=\r\n my use case?\n\nThanks!\n\n\n",
