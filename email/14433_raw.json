JUnit probably is not the right tool for\nwhat you need to do.  You are trying to chop down trees with a scalpel.\n \nLook at Fit and/or Fitnesse.  These are designed for just the tests you\ndescribe, and do not stop on a failed check (their concept for assertion).\n \nGood luck.\n\n--\nJim McMaster\nmailto:jim.mcmaster@...\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  _____  \n\nFrom: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of\nRaffael Housler\nSent: Tuesday, August 23, 2005 3:36 PM\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: RE: [junit] Preventing JUnit from stopping on failures.\n\n\nI appreciate the input but I dont think I was clear enough...\n\nThis is a large scale project in which it is completely unfeasible to find a\nsingle error per test, fix it, and run the test again. This is mainly\nbecause most of the things that are being tested are NOT DIRECTLY related.\nLet me give you a brief example:\n\nPrep: Robot Clicks &quot;Activate Thermoflater&quot; button\nAssert: Does textfield1 match textfield1.bmp\nAssert: Does textfield1 text match &quot;blah blah&quot;\nAssert: Does label1 match jlabel1.bmp\nAssert: Is popup visible\netc\n\nNow hopefully you understand why all assertions must be executed; otherwise\nif it fails on the first assertion, firstly there is not enough information\npin point the problem on the jtextfield or the input mechanism etc and we\nwould also not know if the rest of them are correct until this one was\nfixed, recompiled, and retested (very long time on large scale projects like\nthis).\n\nSo the ideal is, it runs through it, lists all the failures and the problem\ncan be diagnosed with much greater accuracy and speed (less time). Time is\nthe key.\n\nThe tests become quite complex, and it would be possible to write a seperate\ntest for each component, however there would be a huge excess of redundant\ncode (lost time).\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n\n\n  _____  \n\nYAHOO!
