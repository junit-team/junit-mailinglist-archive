An &#39;inner&#39; class \nMUST be bound to an instance of the outer class, and thus can&#39;t be \nstatic.  What you are talking about here I think is referred to as a \n&#39;nested&#39; class.  Which is declared exactly like you would expect a \n&#39;static inner class&#39; to be declared if that&#39;s what it was called:-).  I \nremember hearing the term &#39;top level nested class&#39;  I think it was in \nan article on jRoundup.com.\n\nI know, not exactly relevant to the discussion.. I&#39;ll get back to work \n:-)\n\nI don&#39;t recall anyone mentioning that if for some reason you need \naccess to a private member to do your test. E.g. to verify internal \nstate of your object that is not easily verifiable via public or \nprotected methods, then a inner class would help.  I&#39;m new to Unit \nTesting so there is probably something else that is wrong with that \n:-).  It seems that there are occasionally valid reasons to do that \nthough.\n\nScott\n\nOn Wednesday, April 9, 2003, at 04:25 PM, junit@yahoogroups.com wrote:\n\n&gt; Are static inner classes actually a member variable...\n\n\n\n",
