Also we have to provide some\ndelay after each robot call which makes whole test scenario very\nunpredictable. Test passing on Integration machine have no guarantee of\nrunning all green on staging.\n\nBut it &#39;d be very time consuming to rewrite all those tests again. I would\nsuggest either use JFCUNIT or pump the event into swing buffers thro ur test\ncode.\n\nShailesh\n  -----Original Message-----\n  From: Timothy Wall [mailto:twall@...]\n  Sent: Monday, May 13, 2002 5:28 PM\n  To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n  Subject: Re: [junit] Robot class in JDK 1.3\n\n\n  The more recent ones are\n\n  jfcunit.sourceforge.net\n  jemmy.netbeans.org\n  abbot.sourceforge.net\n\n  there are also a number of half-finished attempts out there...\n\n  T.\n\n  On Monday, May 13, 2002, at 10:48 AM, Scott Stirling wrote:\n\n  &gt; Interesting.
