The runner works just fine, but the results<br/>\ndisplay is less than expected.<br/>\nI have one class in my testing support package with a @RunWith<br/>\nannotation for my runner. Set a property to the package under test and<br/>\ntell JUnit to run the annotated class, and all tests in that package are<br/>\nexecuted. The name of the suite is reported as the name of the class<br/>\nwhich has the @RunWith annotation, in both Ant and IntelliJ. My runner<br/>\nhas an override for ParentRunner.getName() which returns the name of the<br/>\npackage under test. I verified that the string gets into the runner&#39;s<br/>\nDescription object. What am I missing?<br/>\nEnvironment:<br/>\n    * JUnit: 4.5<br/>\n    * Ant: 1.7.0<br/>\n    * IntelliJ IDEA: 8.1<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for whatever direction you can provide.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
