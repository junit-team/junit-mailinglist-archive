I&#39;ve read several articles, \ntutorials, and faqs about junit, and I feel that I grasp what they&#39;re \nsaying... the examples they use make sense. But, then I turn and look at \nsome code I&#39;ve written and I don&#39;t see how to write tests for it.\n\nFor example, I&#39;m working on a system that will generate dynamic web \npages. One of my classes is called Site and it simply holds the domain \nname of the site as a string and has a HashMap to hold references to \nPage objects using the path to the page as the key. It looks like this:\n\npublic class Site {\n\tprivate String domainName;\n\tprivate HashMap pages;\n\t\n\tpublic Site(String dn){\n\t\tdomainName = dn;\n\t\tpages = new HashMap();\n\t}\n\n\tpublic String getDomainName() { return domainName; }\n\n\tpublic void setDomainName(String dn) { domainName = dn; }\n\t\n\tpublic void addPage(String path, Page p){\n\t\tpages.put(path, p);\n\t}\n\t\n\tpublic Document getPage(String path){\n\t\tPage p = (Page) pages.get(path);\n\t\treturn p.makePage();\n\t}\n}\n\n(the &quot;Document&quot; returned by getPage is an XML document that will be \nprinted to the servlet&#39;s output stream)\n\nSo, does this class need a junit test? It seems pretty straight \nforward... I&#39;ve actually written a simple test program that makes a Site \nobject and a Page object with some simple xhtml, puts the reference to \nthe Page object into the Site object&#39;s HashMap and then invoke&#39;s the \ngetPage method and prints the results to the console. It all works fine.\n\nShould I redo this test program in junit? And what would I assert? That \nthe Page object in Site&#39;s HashMap is the same one I put in? That seems \nmind-numbingly obvious. Or, maybe I just haven&#39;t done anything \ncomplicated enough yet? But then, a lot of stuff I&#39;ve read says I should \nwrite the test cases first and then write the class... this, even though \nI&#39;ve also read that I shouldn&#39;t bother writing asserts for simple \nmethods... what if that&#39;s all the class has?\n\nI&#39;d really like to write test cases for everything I write, but at this \npoint I don&#39;t see the use of writing them for the classes I have so far. \nPlease set me straight.\n\nBen\n\n\n\n\n\n",
