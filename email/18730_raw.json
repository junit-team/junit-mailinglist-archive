Is there any such kind of demos\nthat I can refer to ?\n\nThanks and Regards,\nSaldin\n\n--- Kevin Lawrence &lt;kev.lawrence@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; On 12/27/06, junitheadache\n&gt; &lt;bohs01@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; hmm, to be honest, I haven&#39;t had much experience\n&gt; with TDD or JUnit\n&gt; &gt; till I started on my honors project  about a\n&gt; couple of months ago.\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve done much research however and have written a\n&gt; small lab\n&gt; &gt; excercise using TDD.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; As for what makes me think its a good idea, well\n&gt; basically all the\n&gt; &gt; articles I read and the people I&#39;ve spoken to\n&gt; remark on two reasons\n&gt; &gt; why people do not pick up TDD, firstly being the\n&gt; test-first concept\n&gt; &gt; of it is difficult to grasp and secondly that they\n&gt; do not see the\n&gt; &gt; benefits in using it.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; As several other people have stated, TDD is not\n&gt; (primarily) about\n&gt; testing. It is about design.\n&gt; \n&gt; There is value, though, in generating JUnit tests\n&gt; both for people who\n&gt; are not able or not willing to do TDD. We (Agitar)\n&gt; have been working\n&gt; on this problem and have an experimental version of\n&gt; our test\n&gt; generation engine available at www.junitfactory.com.\n&gt; There is a free\n&gt; demo online and I can get an invitation for anyone\n&gt; who would like to\n&gt; try it for real in Eclipse.\n&gt; \n&gt; It is primarily designed for people who do not do\n&gt; TDD but we,\n&gt; internally, find it a useful complement to cover the\n&gt; cases that TDD\n&gt; misses or to bring legacy code under test in the way\n&gt; that Michael\n&gt; Feathers describes in Working Effectively with\n&gt; Legacy Code.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Kevin\n&gt; \n&gt; www.junitfactory.com\n&gt; You send us code. We send you tests.\n&gt; \n\n\n\n \n____________________________________________________________________________________\nIt&#39;s here! Your new message!  \nGet new email alerts with the free Yahoo!
