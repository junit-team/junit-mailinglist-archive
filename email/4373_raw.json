I am sure that testing your code was one\nof major problems. You thought about automating such process. And than you\nheard about Unit Testing. So you would like to start use it. However how to\nintroduce Unit Testing for large number of source files. There is too much\nof stupid code to write in all places again. That is where this package\ncomes in.\n\nJUnit Test Generator\n\nThis code was created for the purpose of helping the QA team at Webmind inc.\nin testing the projects being created in JAVA. It helps in creating Unit\nTests for the classes.\n\n--------------------------------------------\n\nI am not aware about those products.\nHope that will help you.\n\nsylv1\n\nPS: for your last question about to know why this kind of tools won&#39;t exist,\nthe reason i can imagine is that in a full XP spirit, you have to test\n*before* coding. Your test code could not then be generated from your\ndevelopment code. The contrary maybe ;o)\n\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From:\n&gt; sentto-2423328-4378-1016208697-sf=gatonero.com@...\n&gt; [mailto:sentto-2423328-4378-1016208697-sf=gatonero.com@...\n&gt; hoo.com]On Behalf Of markus baumgartner\n&gt; Sent: Friday, March 15, 2002 5:14 PM\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: [junit] Is there a tool which generates JUnit-test stubs?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m spending a lot of time passing new method into the testclass\n&gt; and write a\n&gt; &quot;test_&quot; in front of it (and oftenly forget to do it, too).\n&gt; I made a try to automate the creation of stubs for all existing\n&gt; methods of a\n&gt; class using the Reflection API (e.g. from myProcedure(int A, String B) to\n&gt; test_myProcedure_int_A_String_B. The final goal would be to have the tool\n&gt; comparing the class to the test_class and create stubs for new methods\n&gt; while leaving the existing ones untouched.\n&gt;\n&gt; Before I&#39;m going to create it on my own, I wanted to know, if\n&gt; anybody knows\n&gt; about an existing tool, that does the job?\n&gt;\n&gt; If it does not exist, is there a good reason, why this automation wouldn&#39;t\n&gt; make sense? Sometimes for complex function you may need several testcases,\n&gt; but they can be easely created by taking the first stub and append a\n&gt; number...\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
