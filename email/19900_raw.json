We have a simple alert in o=\r\nur Eclipse plug-in that can\nwarn you if you haven&#39;t run a test within a con=\r\nfigured amount of time.\n  We also have a graphic representation of the last=\r\n few hours of\ntesting activity. So you can see when you last ran a test, ho=\r\nw long\nyou have been fixing a test, and an impression of your recent testin=\r\ng\nrhythm.\n\nFor screen shots of the test run ticker:\nhttps://community.devcr=\r\neek.com/space/David+Jones/blog/2007-03-26_1\n\nAnd you can see the website vi=\r\new based on actual testing:\nhttps://devcreek.com/principalActivity/TestCree=\r\nk/DGJ\n\nThe alerts in combination with the graphics activity summary do seem=\r\n\nto be useful for both guiding the adoption of a TDD style, and also\nfor hi=\r\nghlighting to the more experienced tester when they have drifted\nfrom their=\r\n preferred style such as when one gets lost in the debugger\nfor hours rathe=\r\nr than writing a new test.\n\nOne feature that we have talked about about imp=\r\nlementing in the past,\nwould be to publish these graphics traces of testing=\r\n activity rhythms\nfor beginners to use then as exemplars to work towards. P=\r\nerhaps even\nsome silly scoring mechanism to rate how close you measure to y=\r\nour\nfavourite star tester.\n\nAnother direction could be for the expert exper=\r\nimenting with altering\ntheir testing and development practices to collect a=\r\n series of\nrecorded traces as one record and measure of their exploration a=\r\ns they\nweigh up the pros/cons of the variations they have tried.\n\n\nCheers\nD=\r\navid Jones\n\n\n\n",
