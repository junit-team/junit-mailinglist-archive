If you\nattempt to catch exceptions and call a fail method in the catch\nblock, you will get an incomplete stack trace that includes an\nAssertionFailedError from JUnit (unless of course you write your own\ntest runner).\n\nSo the correct template would be:\n\npublic void testMethod() throws Exception {\n\n    returnValue = methodCall(args);\n\n    assertTrue(some condition);\n}\n\nThe following template would be less correct:\n\npublic void testMethod() {\n\n    try {\n        returnValue = methodCall(args);\n\n    } catch (Exception e){\n\n        fail(&quot;Exception should not be thrown: &quot; + e);\n    }\n     \n    assertTrue(some condition);\n}\n\nIn general, test methods should be very lean and focus specifically\non the condition being tested; let the framework handle the rest.\n\n\n\n--- Mike Clark &lt;mike@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Mike Duffy wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Is the following statment true?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Within JUnit, an exception caught by the framework is an error.\n&gt; \n&gt; It appears that with the exception (no pun intended!) of the\n&gt; java.lang.ThreadDeath error, all other raised exceptions are\n&gt; considered\n&gt; errors rather than failures.\n&gt; \n&gt; Mike\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nMake international calls for as low as $.04/minute with Yahoo!
