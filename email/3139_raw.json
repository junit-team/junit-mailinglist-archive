Before, I was using my own static inner classes (and framework)\nfor unit testing my Java-code and recently switched over to JUnit,\nmainly because I want to test server side objects using Cactus.\n\nI feel that using inner classes for testing has more advantages than\nusing\nseperate classes. With inner classes you can do &quot;white box&quot; testing (you\ncan\naccess private methods and fields), tests are always right beside your\ncode\nand you are somewhat obliged to keep your tests synchronized with your\ncode\n(or at least keep them compilable). And it is no problem to separate\nyour\ntests from your code after compiling, since inner classes are packed in\nseparate class-files.\n\nMY QUESTION now is: What are the consequences of using inner classes\ntogether with JUnit ??? Is it always possible, are there any\nunforseen problems or drawbacks, ... ?? Does someone has any experience\nwith\nthis ?\n\nAny comment, tips, samples ... would be really appreciated.\n\nJef Cumps\nEGOVA NV\nBelgium\n\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\njunit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n \n\nYour use of Yahoo!
