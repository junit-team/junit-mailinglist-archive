If we need to narrow the set of<br/>\nStrings that are allowed, then we use constraints on<br/>\nthe parameters again.  Then we could test that what we<br/>\nexpect to happen given disallowed parameters happens,<br/>\nand what we expect given permitted parameters happens.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis stuff is sort of obvious, but I figured I&#39;d throw<br/>\nit into the mix.<br/>\n<br/>\nHappy New Year All,<br/>\n- Ole<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?
