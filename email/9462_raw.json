(u&#39;ll have to use a &lt;formatter&gt; element\nfor this within the junit task, specifying the\nformatter class and extention).\nIf u want to enhance ur xml reports into html, u can\nmake use of the &#39;junitreport&#39; task which helps\nconvertion of the xml reports to html based on a few\nstylesheets.\n\n\n--- Erik Mattsson &lt;erik.mattsson@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; One way is to dump the output into a textfile using\n&gt; &quot;java -cp tests.jar;junit.jar com.foo.TestCase &gt;\n&gt; textfile.txt&quot;.\n&gt; This is probably the simplest way but is not good in\n&gt; any way. The best way I think is to use\n&gt; ANT for this, in ant you can generate text-, html-\n&gt; and XML- files from the testcases. The html\n&gt; pages are pretty good, they show if anything went\n&gt; bad and it is simple to find the testmethod that\n&gt; failed.\n&gt; \n&gt; Check out the JUNIT target at the ant.apache.org\n&gt; website. If you want I can send\n&gt; you our complete ANT script to compile and run\n&gt; tests.\n&gt; \n&gt; //Erik\n&gt; \n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;   From: Srivastava, Pradeep \n&gt;   To: &#39;junit@yahoogroups.com&#39; \n&gt;   Sent: Monday, September 22, 2003 7:36 AM\n&gt;   Subject: [junit] How to capture junit test reports\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   Hi all,\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   I am new to junit, pls tell me how can I capture\n&gt; the output of junit tests\n&gt;   and put them in a text file or an html file for\n&gt; all cases of success,\n&gt;   failures or errors. I need to show this to the\n&gt; client claiming that our\n&gt;   system is passing all the unit tests cases. I am\n&gt; using junit without ANT.\n&gt; \n&gt;   pls send me some sample script if possible ..\n&gt; \n&gt;   Thanks and Regards\n&gt;   Pradeep\n&gt;   DISCLAIMER: The information in this message is\n&gt; confidential and may be\n&gt;   legally privileged.
