Thanks for prodding me on this<br/>\nfact--I have an idea of how we might be able to bootstrap something fairly<br/>\nquickly on this.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) I _hope_ that JUnit&#39;s simplicity hasn&#39;t disappeared.  I may be living in<br/>\na filter bubble, but my feeling is that the things that should be easy have<br/>\nstayed easy.  Much of the more esoteric discussion on this list is around<br/>\nmaking some hard things possible.  That is, 99% of JUnit users just use<br/>\nJUnit, and don&#39;t participate in the &quot;community&quot;, per se.  80% of the<br/>\ndiscussion on this list tends to be around the work of the other 1% of<br/>\nextenders and developers.<br/>\n<br/>\nDefinitely curious to hear feedback on this angle.

Though I&#39;m a very infrequent user of<br/>\n&gt; JUnit, I must confess that getting the daily emails about the enhanced<br/>\n&gt; capabilities of JUnit these days has shown a possibly powerful tool that&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; become a little byzantine for the casual user to be able to work with.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; One thing I haven&#39;t seen is something that bridges the knowledge gap.<br/>\n&gt; What I mean is, JUnit&#39;s been around for many years now, but to my<br/>\n&gt; knowledge, outside of this group, there&#39;s still only two useful websites<br/>\n&gt; and even those (at last check) don&#39;t seem as comprehensive as they could be<br/>\n&gt; (comparing it to something like the Java SE API, for example).  So there&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; all this esoterica being discussed here, and the websites look like they<br/>\n&gt; haven&#39;t been updated in years.  There&#39;s a gap there.  I find myself getting<br/>\n&gt; lost in casually following these discussions thinking, &quot;What if you just<br/>\n&gt; want to run a test class to unit-test an application class?  What is all<br/>\n&gt; this fancy stuff going on now and these different strange names and<br/>\n&gt; applications people are using?&quot;  I&#39;ve done enough non-JUnit unit testing to<br/>\n&gt; know how the tool should be useable for those applications, but I am<br/>\n&gt; definitely lost when it comes to TestRunners and all this other stuff I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; seen.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This isn&#39;t really a complaint so much as an observation.

A simple @Test annotation with a simple @RunWith did a lot of<br/>\n&gt; things for us for a long time. Although in the same breath I would also<br/>\n&gt; like to state the fact that the things around us change constantly. IMHO,<br/>\n&gt; during the constant changes, we should be able to hold on to the simple<br/>\n&gt; things and build on top of that to accommodate the changing requirements.<br/>\n&gt; There is a great need in the IT world currently to do data driven testing<br/>\n&gt; such that the data is not coupled with the test. The main benefit it gives<br/>\n&gt; is the ability to control data and test separately, which results in less<br/>\n&gt; coupling and ultimately better maintenance.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; EasyTest is trying to achieve exactly that by extending JUnit in a way<br/>\n&gt; that its simplicity is conserved(EasyTest works with @Test annotations) and<br/>\n&gt; at the same time users have the ability to specify the data outside of<br/>\n&gt; their test classes.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Do have a look at EasyTest and share your thoughts with us. Its always<br/>\n&gt; good to get feedback from the people who have experience in the related<br/>\n&gt; field. Here&#39;s EasyTest for your reference:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/EaseTech/easytest\">https://github.com/EaseTech/easytest</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Cheers!<br/>\n&gt; Anuj<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, Teemu Kanstr�n &lt;tkanstren@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hi all,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Maybe I am a bit off topic, but I think JUnit used to be really nice when<br/>\n&gt; &gt; you looked it up and it was so simple to use and understand. Now you get<br/>\n&gt; &gt; these rules, theories, runners, and all kinds of strange things. They are<br/>\n&gt; &gt; nice for anyone needing to extend JUnit to integrate with something<br/>\n&gt; &gt; external but I wish the user never needs to see the stuff..<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I like the basic use of annotations in JUnit 4 but I prefer to have any<br/>\n&gt; &gt; more complex stuff written in the code and not in the annotations.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Of course, it is nice to have the option and support those who like a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; different type of an approach.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Just saying... :)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Teemu<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>",
