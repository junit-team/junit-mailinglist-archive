It is going to be a TestRunner for JUnit that has many\nmore features than the current TestRunner GUI that comes with JUnit. A few\nof the features I am thinking of right now include: simple test suite\ncreation, reporting functionality, and of course, running the tests. I am\nlooking for a couple of developers who are passionate about unit testing and\nuser interfaces to help me design and implement the first version of this\napplication. The project is currently hosted on SourceForge so please feel\nfree to check it out: http://sourceforge.net/projects/testrunnerplus/\n\nIt is not my intention to step on the toes of anyone in the JUnit\ndevelopment project so I would like to invite any of you to contribute as\nmuch or as little as you like.  I am just a developer who loves to make\nGUI&#39;s and I saw the need for one in this project... Since I am fairly new to\nthe testing world, I would imagine that many of you have had a plethora of\nideas about how the TestRunner could be improved. I would like to tap into\nthose ideas so that we can make an application that fills your needs. Please\nsubmit a feature request from the project homepage at source forge or just\nreply to this email if you have any feature ideas...\n\nCurrently I would like to release this application under the BSD license\ninstead of the IBM license. The BSD license being less restrictive should\nmake this application even more widely available for whatever use people\nfind for it (Including IBM). Once the application is mature enough for\ngeneral consumption, I will send out another email to this group so you can\ncheck it out.\n\nSincerely,\nChris Eppstein\n\n\n",
