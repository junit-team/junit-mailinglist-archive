When packaging for distribution, the sequence of steps is fixed and you \nrun through it once from start to finish.  ant is pretty good for this.\n\nWhen developing, you need a wide range of dependency tracking to ensure you&#39;re \ndoing as little work as possible in response to any given change (this assumes \nyou&#39;re using the same framework to build for development as you do for distribution).  \nRapid changes in development are slowed down when you have to write code to \nsupport changes in your build process.  In this situation, make&#39;s dependencies and \nscript-level control are more well-suited.  \n\nAnt expects all tasks to have dependencies implicitly encoded in the task itself, if you \nwant to avoid the overhead of invoking a certain task.  If I want to do simple \ndependency checking to avoid a custom task (using exec or an aggregate of tasks) if \nit&#39;s already been done, the solution with ant is verbose at best.\n\nThink of it as GUI vs programmatic API or script.  If everything you want to do is \nalready encoded in the GUI, that&#39;s great.  If not, then it&#39;s no better and sometimes \nworse than the alternatives.\n\n\n&gt;On Wed, 30 Apr 2003 03:43:33 +1200, J. B.
