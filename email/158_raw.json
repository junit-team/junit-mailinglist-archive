Probably not an \nissue for most people since the goal is 0 Errors and 0 Failures \nanyway. Catching the known exceptions that shouldn&#39;t be thrown and \nlogging Failure gives a slightly more correct test result.\n\nNonetheless, we started writing tests today that follow the idiom of \nletting the undesired exceptions propagate back to the framwork.\n\nRegards,\n\nRob\n\n\n\n",
