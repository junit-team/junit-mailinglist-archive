By my second \n    &gt; sentence, I meant\n    &gt; that counting asserts is something that not everyone -- \n    &gt; and perhaps not a\n    &gt; majority of people -- do. I didn&#39;t mean to imply that \n    &gt; because *I* didn&#39;t do\n    &gt; it, Erich and Kent didn&#39;t put it in the framework.
