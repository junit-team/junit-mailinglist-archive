I downloaded\nyour jar and I had a look. The class utmj.tests.AllTests doesn&#39;t compile, so\nI removed it. Unfortunately not all the other tests pass. Although all the\nutmj.threaded.AllTests tests pass, the utmj.threaded.example.AllTests don&#39;t\nall pass:\n\n.............F.F..F.F..F.F..F.F..F.F..F.F..F.F..F.F..F.F..F.\nF..F.F..F.F...F..F.F..F.F..F.F..F.F..F.F..F.F..F.F. \n\nTime: 20.229 There were 39 failures: \n\n1)\ntestTenPutThreadsVersusOneTakeThread(utmj.threaded.example.NonDeterministicB\noundedBufferTest)junit.framework.AssertionFailedError: Buffer is empty\nexpected:&lt;0&gt; but was:&lt;1&gt;\n&lt;snipped for brevity&gt;\n\nFAILURES!!! Tests run: 72,  Failures: 39,  Errors: 0\n\n(run with JUnit 3.7 on Windows NT, java 1.3)\n\nI&#39;m hesitant to look more closely into your code when the tests bundled with\nit don&#39;t run.\n\nRegards,\n\nEmily\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Sorry for not answering your particular questions on the topic and not\n&gt; referring to your example.\n&gt; \n&gt; What I want to provide is some code I have had in my drawer for some\n&gt; time. It basically consists of a few utility classes for testing in a\n&gt; multithreaded environment:\n&gt; - ThreadedTest: A decorator for running a test in a thread of its own.\n&gt; (More or less stolen from JUnitPerf)\n&gt; - MultiThreadedTest: A decorator which catches exceptions and test\n&gt; failures in spawned threads and makes the testcase fail.\n&gt; - ExceptionAssert: A helper class to test for expected exceptions in\n&gt; spawned threads.\n&gt; - RetriedAssert: A helper class to test for an assert \n&gt; condition up to a\n&gt; given time limit. (also stolen)\n&gt; - ConcurrentTestCase: A subclass of TestCase which provides \n&gt; some help in\n&gt; doing the kind of semi-deterministic testing which you want to do in\n&gt; your example. An example for using this class is also provided in a\n&gt; subpackage *.example. Therein you find a test suite for the\n&gt; BoundedBuffer example discussed in\n&gt; http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?JavaUnitTestChallangeSolved.\n&gt; \n&gt; I just uploaded the code to the group&#39;s files area: \n&gt; threadedtesting.jar\n&gt; \n&gt; Comments appreciated.\n&gt; \n&gt; Johannes\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n",
