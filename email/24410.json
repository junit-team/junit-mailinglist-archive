If you want<br/>\n&gt; a certain behaviour you need to use a specific runner. Often you will want<br/>\n&gt; more than just one behaviour. For example you may want the spring runner<br/>\n&gt; with junit and jparams behaviour. Sometimes you will find a way to makr<br/>\n&gt; that work. Sometimes you just dont. A rework of the runner-concept,<br/>\n&gt; introducing something like a chain for the behaviour-part would be a good<br/>\n&gt; idea, i guess. This could either be achieved by introducing a runner that<br/>\n&gt; does the work or by introducing this concept deeper into the framework. How<br/>\n&gt; are your thoughts on this? It could only work well when introduced to junit<br/>\n&gt; and the old concept would get marked deprecated as this makes<br/>\n&gt; runner-providers like spring migrate to the new concept. I would be willing<br/>\n&gt; to give it a try and implement this if you think its a good idea. Another<br/>\n&gt; thing: anyone got junit formatter file?<br/>\n&gt; Regards, Henning<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
