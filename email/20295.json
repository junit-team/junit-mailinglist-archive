Februar 2008 22:34<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: [junit] Re: How would you arrange tests with jUnit?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; The best thing with JUnit testing is to think in terms of<br/>\n&gt; behaviours.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; What behaviour are you expecting from your system and write a test<br/>\n&gt; for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that. Do not let the fact that some behaviours span <br/>\n&gt; multiple objects <br/>\n&gt; &gt; while others use only a single method cause you to lose <br/>\n&gt; sight of the <br/>\n&gt; &gt; fact that testing is best done at the unit level and the most<br/>\n&gt; workable<br/>\n&gt; &gt; unit is the unit of behaviour.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You make an excellent point, and something I didn&#39;t realize. <br/>\n&gt; I was thinking unit testing as &#39;test each method of my class&#39; <br/>\n&gt; and make sure they work as expected. But really, I&#39;m looking <br/>\n&gt; to test and see if my application functionality (behaviour) <br/>\n&gt; works. &quot;Can I create a report&quot; <br/>\n&gt; is what I&#39;m really after...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks again.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I also make the experience to think in terms of behaviors of the<br/>\nclass under test and the methods. For myself I think thats the best<br/>\nway to test the special class behavior as also method behavior in<br/>\none test class. But more over I use the following way...<br/>\nIf classes have similar behaviors, for example definied by<br/>\ninterfaces or abstract classes I group my tests into similar<br/>\nclasses, for example *ViewTest, *ServiceTest. That saves many<br/>\ntime of coding tests for similar classes with the same expected<br/>\nbehavior. The very nice side-effect: test methods stay in the<br/>\nright test classes.<br/>\n<br/>\nImagine you have a complex service with dozens of methods and<br/>\neach method is definied with up to 5 differently action paths.<br/>\nSo you may get up to 100 test methods in one class under test.<br/>\nMy own solutions is to devide it into some test classes for<br/>\nexample an AccountingService that provides serveral methodes<br/>\nfor accounting and some other central accounting information<br/>\nto test:<br/>\n<br/>\nBaseAccountOperationServiceTest<br/>\n\t(tests the base account operations: add, sub, exceptions)<br/>\nAdvancedAccountOperationServiceTest<br/>\n\t(tests the advanced account operations: dispo, change)<br/>\nTempAccountServiceTest<br/>\n\t(tests the additonal behavior of temporary acccounts)<br/>\nCustomerServiceAccountingServiceTest<br/>\n\t(tests the behavior of the AccountingService in conjunction<br/>\n\tof the customer service thats used by the AccountingService)<br/>\n<br/>\nBack to your case I would write one test class CreateReportReportManagerTest<br/>\nto test all behaviors of report creation. I assume that your<br/>\nReportManager has some other behaviors not only creation. So you write<br/>\nExportReportManagerTest, PrintReportManagerTest and some other ...ReportManagerTest<br/>\nto separate the behavior a little bit. Maybe further development shows<br/>\nyou some general export or print behavior to test in separate<br/>\ntestcases.</div>",
