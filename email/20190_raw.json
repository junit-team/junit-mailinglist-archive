But all my member variables get initialized seperately in a\n&gt;  different method which is of no relation with the BIG method I wanted\n&gt;  to test in the first place.\n....\n&gt;  Can I test my method without worrying about the initialization of my\n&gt;  object&#39;s data, by mocking the results of all my getter methods ?\n&gt;  I tried using Jmock for creating mocks in my test case, but it fails\n&gt;  because the mock object only knows what exactly I wanted to mock but\n&gt;  nothing more than that. All my application logic is present in\n&gt;  &#39;MyClass&#39; object not in its mock.\n&gt;\n&gt;  How can I achieve this using Jmock ?\n\nThis is not what jMock is designed for.  Mock Objects are used to test\nhow the object under test affects its environment by sending commands\nto other objects.  They are not for testing the implementation details\nof what goes on *inside* the object under test.\n\nIn your description of what you&#39;re trying to test, you described\ntrying to test a method.  That to me is a smell.  It would be better\nto think about testing the *object*, not individual methods.\n\nTo write a test for an object you need to answer questions like: What\ndoes the object do? What messages do I send the object to make it\nperform the behaviour I am testing? What resources does it need\nperform that behaviour?  What other objects does it need to talk to?\nAre those objects internal implementation details, or peers of the\nobject under test?\n\nIf you can answer those questions, you can easily work out which\nobjects should be mocked out, and which should be hidden within the\nobject under test.\n\nThe other smell is that the method is huge, and has complicated\ndependencies on initialisation methods.  It sounds as if the class\nneeds to be divided into smaller, simpler objects that can be more\neasily unit tested and that define proper constructors.\n\nTo do that without an extensive suite of unit tests, I would first\nwrite some integration or system tests that cover the behaviour of the\nclass. I would then pull behaviour out of the big class into smaller\nclasses, writing those smaller classes test-first.  The system tests\nwould give me some confidence that my refactoring had not broken\neverything.  Writing the new classes test-first would drive out a less\ncoupled design that would be easier to maintain in the future.\n\n--Nat\n\n",
