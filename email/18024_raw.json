These fragments are then aggregated to form a complete web page\nby the portal\n\nPortlets aren&#39;t allowed to generated HTML code that contains tags such as\nbase, body, frame, frameset, head, html, or title. The iframe tag can be\nused with caution.\n\nThe user cannot access a portlet directly using a URL in the way that a\nservlet is accessed. Instead, the URL points to the page containing all of\nthe portlets on one page\n\nCommunication between the web client and the portlets is performed through\nthe portal\n\nPortlets can be provided with buttons or controls to manipulate the\nportlets&#39; window states or portlet modes\n\nMultiple instances of a single portlet can be placed onto the same page\n\nPortlets support persistent configuration and customization\n\nPortlets also support user profile information\n\nPortlets support two scopes within the session; application scope and\nportlet scope\n\nThere are several things that servlets are allowed to do, but portlets\naren&#39;t. These include the following:\n\nPortlet aren&#39;t allowed to set the character set encoding of the response\n\nPortlet also aren&#39;t allowed to set the HTTP headers on the response\n\nPortlet cannot manipulate the URL of the client request to the portal\n\n \n\n \n\nIn view of these similarities and differences, do you think , with minor\nchanges to the recipes, I would be able to develop tests for portlets?\n\n \n\nThanks,\n\n-Kamal.\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of J.\nB.

In that case, _JUnit Recipes_ has a chapter on testing web \n\ncomponents, and the recipes that apply to servlets should apply pretty \n\nwell to portlets.\n\n \n\nTake care.\n\n-- \n\nJ. B.
