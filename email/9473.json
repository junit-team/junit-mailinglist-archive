On the<br/>\n&gt; other hand, elaborating structure can also illuminate the darkness and<br/>\n&gt; focus attention on where to make things fast.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I myself wouldn&#39;t avoid defining a method to make things clear.

My point is only that there _is_ a cost;<br/>\nit&#39;s not free.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; My experience is that a huge percentage of the tight code we write just<br/>\n&gt; because it&#39;s more efficient is wasted effort. My practice is to write clear<br/>\n&gt; code, and then optimize it where it needs it, reducing clarity if I must.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Right.  My friend Walter wrote tight code because that&#39;s the way that<br/>\nhe was; we reserved him for code that really mattered, code that really<br/>\nhad to be fast and/or small.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not Walter.  When we needed code fast, I might knock it out.  But<br/>\nwhen we found out what code had to be fast, we turned our modest efforts<br/>\nover to Walter, who would grumble, argue that the specs weren&#39;t good<br/>\nenough, reformat each and every line, and then shrink it and shrink it<br/>\nagain -- days passed -- until it was tiny, jewel-like, usually<br/>\nincomprehensible, and worked flawlessly.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; The August 2003 issue of the Communications of the ACM focuses on program<br/>\n&gt; &gt; compaction and has a lead article &quot;Extracting Library-based Java<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Applications&quot;.  This concerns software developed by IBM researchers to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; reduce the size of Java code.  One of their tools minimizes the length of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; names where possible (it&#39;s not possible where a name is part of a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; published interface).  Using this and other techniques they typically<br/>\n&gt; &gt; shrink Java code by well over 50% for a small one-time cost in terms of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; computer cycles (it takes about 4 minutes to process 3.8 MB of code on an<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 800 MHz PC).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I can see how some Java systems might increase the size of the code by<br/>\n&gt; including non-public names, but it seems somewhat of a bug to do so as a<br/>\n&gt; matter of course.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Look at the bytecode.  Whenever you call<br/>\ncom.funnyfarm.toplevel.deeper.deeperstill.getondown.WeAreFinallyThere,<br/>\nit&#39;s in the bytecode, each and every character.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; There is a reasonably reliable relationship between code size and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; speed.  Less than half as many bytes typically means software that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; runs more than twice as fast.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This is news to me, and I can think of counterexamples, such as unrolling<br/>\n&gt; loops, or hard-coding table lookups, which typically increases both size<br/>\n&gt; and speed. Have you some references regarding the speed/size relationship<br/>\n&gt; and how it varies?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No.  But I am working on tools for measuring this sort of thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are indeed good counter-examples like loop unrolling.  However,<br/>\nif you set out to optimize machine language, in my experience most of<br/>\nwhat you do is the opposite.  You find that the compiler has generated<br/>\ncode that does things in 20 steps which you can reduce to 5, because<br/>\nyou have a wider view.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; Sure, but bear in mind the cost of using long names and an expanded<br/>\n&gt; &gt; class hierarchy to replace comments.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m not saying it should be forbidden.  I do it myself all the time.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; But nothing is black and white; there are always tradeoffs.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yes. I suspect that I think the tradeoffs favor clear code more than you<br/>\n&gt; do, but that could be because I don&#39;t work on the same kind of code.<br/>\n&gt; Conceivably, I might have a few different tricks.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I would expect that you would.  ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; However, if you are suggesting that documentation should always and in all<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ways be minimal, I have to disagree outright.  Someone using software<br/>\n&gt; &gt; should not have to refer to the code to understand how it works.  On the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; contrary: there are strong arguments for never looking beyond the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Javadocs.  If that sort of documentation is missing or is unreliable, the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; cost of using software soars.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Javadocs to understand HOW it works? I wouldn&#39;t think so. What it does, how<br/>\n&gt; to use it, yes. But how?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I misspoke.  What I mean is that you shouldn&#39;t have to look at the code<br/>\nto know how to use it.  There should be good, solid, reliable external<br/>\ndocumentation.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; In any case, unless you mean we should produce more documentation than we<br/>\n&gt; need, I think we must agree on &quot;minimal&quot; but perhaps not on just what<br/>\n&gt; &quot;minimal&quot; means.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The documentation should be sufficient to write code against, without<br/>\nany further reference to the underlying code.<br/>\n<br/>\nComments at a lower level should be sufficient to enable maintainers<br/>\nto understand the code, so that they can fix bugs and change the<br/>\nsoftware when necessary.  Where necessary, you cite the literature<br/>\nor clearly explain practices in molecular biology or whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my experience, comments have a definite tendency to lag the code -<br/>\nprogrammers change the software and forget to modify the comments.  So<br/>\nallowing for the considerations above, comments should be terse, and<br/>\nsomeone should review the code to make sure that the comments and the<br/>\ncode are in sync.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; Is this relevant to testing?  Yes it is.  Where code is underdocumented,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the poor guy who inherits it often must resort to exploratory testing,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to understand what the code actually does.  This is extremely expensive,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; a waste of programmer time.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yes. And when code is well-tested, the tests serve as compilable,<br/>\n&gt; executable commentary. They can&#39;t replace all comments, but they can do a<br/>\n&gt; better job than other comments. Or so it seems to me ...<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Agreed.  My preferred approach to software development is<br/>\n<br/>\n* publish the specs<br/>\n* design tests that verify that the code adheres to the specs<br/>\n* hand the programmer the specs and the tests<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJim Dixon  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jdd@...\">jdd@...</a>   tel +44 117 982 0786  mobile +44 797 373 7881</div>",
