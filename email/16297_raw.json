JUnit Recipes, By J.B Raisenberger\n&gt; 2.      Pragmatic Unit Testing in Java with JUnit, by Andrew Hunt and David\n&gt; Thomas\n&gt; 3.      JUnit in Action, by Vincent Massol\n&gt; 4.      Extreme Programming with Ant, by Niemeyer Poteet.\n\nI don&#39;t know about #4, but I do recommend the other 3. I strongly \nrecommend Feathers&#39; book, as well. I would put it #2.\n\n&gt; I would welcome any suggestions, by you as well. My Java experience is only\n&gt; school, and 3 months at my previous job. So if my questions are at a level\n&gt; lower then you would expect to see,\n\nThanks for this background information. It helps me better understand \nwhat to assume you know and don&#39;t know. We can help you out.\n\n&gt; Then please let me know, I&#39;ll look elsewhere. And I do appreciate your\n&gt; criticism, I will look more into the books first before asking any question.\n\nDon&#39;t worry: ask your questions, even if all we do is forward to back to \nthe books. :) In particular, ask questions about how to apply those \ntechniques to your codebase.\n\nGood luck.\n-- \nJ.
