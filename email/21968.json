As I was working on the<br/>\nexamples to be used for the course I noticed that it felt odd <br/>\nto mark my unit level specs with @Test.  I forked the junit code <br/>\nin github and added the ability to mark them using a new @Spec<br/>\nannotation.  It behaves identically to @Test.  I have sent a pull<br/>\nrequest to Kent but I am curious what this list thinks about this<br/>\nchange.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\n-Cheezy</div>",
