The test code and the class\nwhere the cast is made both exist in a default package.\n\n// example code:\n    my.Type a = Factory.instance( );\n   // we query on &quot;a&quot; and it prints out its type as &quot;my.Type&quot;, and the\nvalue is not null.\n    my.Type b = (my.Type) a;   // this line throws a class cast exception\n\nI&#39;m guessing that the JUnit framework launches its own class loader and\nit&#39;s getting confused with some code existing in a default package.\n\nDoes anyone have an idea of what is going on?  Does all code need to be\nfound in a named package?\n\n\n\n\n\n",
