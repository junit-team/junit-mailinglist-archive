I intend to create a subclass of \nthe \n&gt; &gt; TestCase class for each service and create methods to unit test the \n&gt; &gt; appropriate methods.  I would like to call all the tests by creating a \n&gt; &gt; TestSuite which has access to the service endpoint (URI/location) to \nclass \n&gt; &gt; name mappings which then creates TestSuites for all those classes \neg \n&gt; &gt;       \n&gt; &gt;       someTestSuite.addTest(GridServiceTestClass.suite()) \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; The TestSuite which should auto pick up all the Tests needs a \nparameter  \n&gt; &gt; to be \n&gt; &gt; passed in to indicate the service endpoint.  Is this possible? \n&gt;  \n&gt; Yes, but not directly. \n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; At a guess, I could set a static variable with the endpoint in the class \n&gt; &gt; creating the TestSuite and reference that within the TestSuite - any  \n&gt; &gt; ideas on \n&gt; &gt; this?   \n&gt;  \n&gt; Your test will have to grab that data from somewhere, and there are a  \n&gt; number of useful &quot;somewheres&quot;: \n&gt;  \n&gt; 1. a properties file \n&gt; 2. a JVM (system) property \n&gt; 3. your own configuration file \n&gt; 4. a database \n&gt; [...] \n&gt;  \n&gt; Unfortunately, xUnit does not directly support passing fixture data into  \n&gt; a test from the outside. Instead, the test has to grab its fixture data  \n&gt; from the outside world. Patterns such as Parameterized Test Case (See  \n&gt; /JUnit Recipes/, recipe 4.8) try to get around this limitation, but  \n&gt; their use is somewhat limited. \n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; I could be taking the wrong approach to this - so ideas greatly \nwelcomed. \n&gt;  \n&gt; Any of the above ideas work for you? \n&gt; --  \n&gt; J.
