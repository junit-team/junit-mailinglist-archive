That was the first thing we tried. J2ME doesn&#39;t support\ncertain features in Java that JUnit relies on. J2ME doesn&#39;t have reflection,\nfor instance, which is used heavily by J2MEUnit. J2MEUnit is basically just\na rewrite of JUnit&#39;s functionality, modified not to use those features of\nJava that J2ME doesn&#39;t have.\n\nI&#39;d love to try what you talk about, with the KVM being called through ant.\nIt would be interesting if it would work. If it didn&#39;t, it would be a simple\njob to write a new task for ant to make it work.\n\nbab\n---\nBrian Button             bbutton@...\nSenior Consultant    http://www.objectmentor.com\nObject Mentor, Inc.\n\nExtreme Programming in St. Louis http://groups.yahoo.com/group/xpstl\n\n\n",
