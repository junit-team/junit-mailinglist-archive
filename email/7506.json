Then again, when <br/>\nI do use EJBs it&#39;s only to &quot;front&quot; a non-EJB component that can be <br/>\ntested outside of an EJB container.  That is, the EJB is strictly <br/>\nconduit.  So I guess I use the approach you mention for integration <br/>\ntesting, if that distinction matters.<br/>\n<br/>\nIMO, Cactus is great, if you absolutely must test from within the <br/>\ncontainer.  I strive to make those cases the exception, rather than the <br/>\nrule.    <br/>\n<br/>\nMike<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nMike Clark<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clarkware.com\">http://clarkware.com</a><br/>\n(303) 589-3812</div>",
