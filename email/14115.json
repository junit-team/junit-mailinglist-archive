I&#39;m not exactly sure what you mean by<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Monostate,&quot; but I understand your concern on the static methods. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>A Monostate is like an inside-out Singleton: all its fields and methods <br/>\nare class-level (static) so although it looks like a normal object, no <br/>\nmatter how many of them you instantiate, they all look the same. (There <br/>\nis no instance-level data to differentiate different instances.) Any <br/>\nclass with all class-level methods is effectively a Monostate.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; My<br/>\n&gt; developers&#39; group is meeting on Wednesday and one of the topics is<br/>\n&gt; going to be allowing my project to use Spring. If that happens, I will<br/>\n&gt; eliminate the AppProperties and have each component that needs<br/>\n&gt; properties have a setter for the specific property.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I would do that, anyway: with Spring or without, your application&#39;s <br/>\nentry point should make the decision about where application properties <br/>\ncome from, then hand those property /values/ to the objects that need <br/>\nthem. (If you can&#39;t do this easily, then that might signal the part of <br/>\nthe design that needs attention next.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Also, I ordered your book from Amazon about three weeks ago and I am<br/>\n&gt; anxiously awaiting its arrival (it is supposed to be delivered<br/>\n&gt; 7/12-7/28). I have heard nothing but rave reviews.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>1. I hope you enjoy it.<br/>\n2. If you enjoy it, please review it.<br/>\n3. If you don&#39;t enjoy it, just throw it in the trash, e-mail me, then <br/>\nkeep quiet about it. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
