You send\nit Java code =\r\nand it sends back JUnit characterization tests for your\ncode.\n\nWe have made=\r\n our technology freely available to academic institutions\nand test research=\r\ners, but some of them don&#39;t have the spare computing\nor IT resources to set=\r\n-up a test server.  So we thought it would be a\nfun experiment to set-up a =\r\ndozen CPUs and have students and\nresearchers use the test generator over th=\r\ne web.  As the experiment\nprogresses, we plan to make APIs available so tha=\r\nt researchers and\nanyone interested in automated test generation can experi=\r\nment with\ntheir own characterization test generation algorithms and strateg=\r\nies.\n\nBefore anyone starts complaining about the evil of automated test\ngen=\r\neration, let me restate that JUnitFactory can only generate\ncharacterizatio=\r\nn tests; and let me clarify what is meant by\ncharacterization tests for tho=\r\nse that may not be familiar with the\nterm or concept.\n\nIn &quot;Working With Leg=\r\nacy Code&quot;, Michael Feathers define\ncharacterization tests as tests that cha=\r\nracterize and record what the\ncode actually does - not what it&#39;s *supposed*=\r\n to do. They exercise the\ncode with a range of inputs, and record return va=\r\nlues, object state,\netc., for each set of inputs.\n\nCharacterization tests a=\r\nre useful for working with legacy code which\nis defined, again by Michael F=\r\neathers, as any code without tests.\n\nCTs can come in handy as change detect=\r\nors when there is a large body\nof code with little or no tests and provide =\r\na safety net when you need\nto make some changes to it.  If the same set of =\r\ninputs results in\ndifferent behavior between the original and the revised v=\r\nersion of the\ncode, some assertions in the characterization tests will fail=\r\n. Some of\nthose failures may point to unexpected and/or unwanted changes\nin=\r\n behavior that you might want to know about and address.\n\nColloquially, and=\r\n in the simplest possible terms, a characterization\ntests will tell you thi=\r\nngs like the following:\n\n-----\nIn the original version of the code, &#39;Util.f=\r\noobar(&quot;abc&quot;, 123)&#39;\nreturned &#39;42&#39;. After you made the change, it returns &#39;43=\r\n&#39;.\n-----\n\nThe test has no idea whether the right return value is &#39;42&#39; or &#39;4=\r\n3&#39;,\nbut it lets you know that it has changed and you, the developer, has\nto=\r\n decide which one is right and what to do about it.  Sorry, no free\nlunch.\n=\r\n\nBy now it should be amply clear that automatically generated\ncharacterizat=\r\nion tests are NOT a replacement for TDD or JUnit tests\nlovingly crafted by =\r\ndevelopers.  But, especially with some user input\nin the selection of test =\r\ndata and test assertions (which is possible\nwith JUnitFactory), they can gi=\r\nve developers a valuable jump-start in\nworking with legacy code and complem=\r\nent their manual testing efforts.\n\nUnfortunately, for the time being, we on=\r\nly have a client plug-in for\nEclipse.  If enough people find the JUnitFacto=\r\nry useful, we plan to\nadd support for other IDEs.  As a matter of fact, if =\r\nyou want to help\nwith that let us know - but keep in mind that JUnitFactory=\r\n is designed\nto be a free service so all clients will have to be freely ava=\r\nilable\nor, better, open-source.\n\nIf you don&#39;t use Eclipse, there&#39;s a &quot;toy&quot; =\r\nweb-based demo of the CT\ngeneration also - but it only works on one class w=\r\nith no dependencies.\n\nAnyway, if you have any interest in JUnit generation,=\r\n go to the\nwebsite, request an invitation and give it a try.\n\nRemember, it&#39;=\r\ns still experimental and mostly for fun so don&#39;t expect\ntoo much or bang on=\r\n it too hard.\n\nAlberto\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
