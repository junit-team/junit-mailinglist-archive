But I have a question which I hope some of you<br/>\n&gt; can help me with - it&#39;s regarding testing private/protected methods and how<br/>\n&gt; to organize my test package.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; First the package. I have read to articles regarding test (&quot;Junit best<br/>\n&gt; practices&quot; from JavaWorld and &quot;Incremental development with Ant and JUnit&quot;<br/>\n&gt; from developerWorks). In the JBT article Andy Schneider advice you to keep<br/>\n&gt; tests in the same location as the source code. And in the Incremental...<br/>\n&gt; article Malcolm Davis advice you to make a separate package. Which approach<br/>\n&gt; is the best to use?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>it is better to make separate package. when we can identify as two separate<br/>\ncomponents like source code and test code it is better to keep them as two<br/>\ndifferent components from configuration management point of view.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; I must admit that I like the idea of making a separate package but then<br/>\n&gt; again - how do I then test private and protected methods? And if I keep the<br/>\n&gt; tests in the same location as the source code - who do I then test private<br/>\n&gt; methods?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>we cant test private and protected methods directly.<br/>\nwe need to find the public methods, which are using those protected and private<br/>\nmethods and test that public methods is enough. Still it is not sufficient.<br/>\n<br/>\none thing the developer can do is, he can change the private and protected to<br/>\npublic and test them. after that he can change back to private and protected<br/>\nrespectively. but this is not that much good idea.<br/>\n<br/>\nstill we need to find the exact way.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; I would very much appreciate if some of you could give me a little example<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Kind regards,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; J.
