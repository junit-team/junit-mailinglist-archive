B. Rainsberger [mailto:jbrains@...]\n&gt; Sent: mercredi 30 juin 2004 03:32\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: Re: [junit] Re: Help with MockObjects\n&gt; \n&gt; cliftonccraig wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Yes, It was in the JUnit In Action book where I saw the practice of\n&gt; &gt; using tearDown for calls to the verify on the mockobjects. It&#39;s right\n&gt; &gt; there in chapter 8 page 168. Now they are using mocks from the\n&gt; &gt; easymock.org framework but I don&#39;t think that makes much of a\n&gt; &gt; difference. Maybe their examples were based on an earlier version of\n&gt; &gt; JUnit where this wasn&#39;t a problem?\n&gt; \n&gt; I love Vince Massol. I think he&#39;s brilliant. In this one design/coding\n&gt; choice, I disagree with him.\n\nWhat&#39;s wrong with that? (happy to learn a new thing) :-)\n\nSteve mentioned in another email that the error do not get reported\nproperly. Strange. It has always worked for me with either easymock or\ndynamocks.\n\nThat it is now automatic in jmock is of course much better.\n\nThanks\n-Vincent\n\n\n",
