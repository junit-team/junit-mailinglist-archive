As far as I can check: \n17. This is clearly nothing compared to the JUnit user community what \nclearly demonstrate for me that it is not the appropriate way to \nevaluate an improvement (I&#39;m quite sure that I could quickly motivate \nfar more than 17 users to vote for one issue but it would be biased).\n\nCurrently you &quot;are&quot; JUnit therefore I&#39;d like to know from *you* what \n*you* think of these suggestions. Or don&#39;t you use JUnit? ;-)\n\nCheers,\nMarc.\n-- \nHtmlUnit support & consulting from the source\nBlog: http://mguillem.wordpress.com\n\nLe 14/02/2011 17:50, David Saff a �crit :\n&gt; Marc,\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks for giving me incentive to write up the current state of the\n&gt; JUnit community, which I&#39;ve posted under a different subject heading.\n&gt; If you have a chance to look there, and give thoughts on the general\n&gt; state, I hope you&#39;ll be able to see general change that will be less\n&gt; discouraging.\n&gt;\n&gt; In terms of these specific ideas, I had in mind that you could simply\n&gt; copy and paste each bullet line into a feature request, and post links\n&gt; to each feature here on the list, encouraging readers to vote.  That\n&gt; way, we could start with the most popular ideas, and iterate on clean\n&gt; patches for those, once you could be sure that the effort wouldn&#39;t be\n&gt; wasted.\n&gt;\n&gt; I hope that addresses your concerns.

I follow JUnit GitHub issues since long enough to have an idea of what happens there, therefore I will use my time for other activities.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Cheers,\n&gt;&gt; Marc.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; --- In junit@yahoogroups.com, David Saff&lt;david@...&gt;  wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Marc,\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; After the release of 4.9 (hopefully soon), my plan is to concentrate\n&gt;&gt;&gt; development and patching activity on GitHub issues with high vote\n&gt;&gt;&gt; counts.  I recommend posting these as GitHub issues\n&gt;&gt;&gt; (http://github.com/KentBeck/junit/issues)--feel free to use this forum\n&gt;&gt;&gt; to encourage votes.

A failure should be reported as success whereas a success should be reported as failure. This has proven to be far more interesting than @Ignore which is just a little better than removing a test: @NotYetImplemented allows to write tests for &quot;accepted&quot; bugs or future features and to get notified when they are fixed as side effect of other changes\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; - assertEquals&  IDE integration\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; small improvement to throw ComparisonFailure not only for String comparison what allows IDE like Eclipse to better display differences between expected and actual result.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Cheers,\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Marc.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n\n",
