I can&#39;t envision a single project that big. I&#39;d <br/>\n&gt; want to ask the people on that project two questions:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 1. Why such reliance on slow tests?<br/>\n&gt; 2. Should we break this up into about four subprojects?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Good questions.  I&#39;d give you my own answers, but I doubt <br/>\nthey are too interesting to this group, and they&#39;re definitely<br/>\nfar off topic of the conversation about how to group tests<br/>\ntogether.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Is it really a good idea to have a test suite so long that <br/>\n&gt; you can&#39;t run it overnight between when people leave for work <br/>\n&gt; and when they come back in the morning? How do you do a daily build?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>We have several test suites.  The unit tests run every night<br/>\nand give one level of confidence.  And then some system test<br/>\nsuites run each night to give more confidence about different<br/>\nthings each night.  In total, it takes 2 nights, but there is<br/>\nusable feedback each night.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; No question there. If you&#39;ve managed to reduce the feedback <br/>\n&gt; cycle from 6 weeks to 2 days, then that&#39;s great work. Still, <br/>\n&gt; I find a 2-day cycle quite long. I imagine you have bigger <br/>\n&gt; problems to face right now, so you&#39;re right to face them and <br/>\n&gt; not this one, but all things being equal, I wouldn&#39;t be <br/>\n&gt; satisfied with a 2-day cycle, and I certainly wouldn&#39;t design <br/>\n&gt; JUnit to optimize for the case of the 2-day test cycle.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, that&#39;s one reason I don&#39;t think my own stories are<br/>\noverly relevant.  I&#39;m not in the &quot;sweet spot&quot; of users<br/>\nof JUnit, as I&#39;m using it for both unit tests and for<br/>\nsystem tests.  And, while I know there are other people<br/>\nin my same boat, we&#39;re in the minority.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; But that&#39;s great work. I&#39;m impressed. Have you written about <br/>\n&gt; what you do differently between the 6-week cycle and the <br/>\n&gt; 2-day cycle?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Only on my resume.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTodd.</div>",
