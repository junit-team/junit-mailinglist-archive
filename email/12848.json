For the most part JUnit works great on the Mac but I have an<br/>\nissue that I need to solve before I can move ahead.  This issue is the<br/>\nissue of classpath.  Exactly what elements of a JUnit test need on the<br/>\nclasspath?  I know that the junit.jar file must be visible to the<br/>\njavac program.  On my Mac I have placed the junit.jar file in my<br/>\n/Libray/Java/Extensions folder.  That seems to work with the swingui<br/>\nmodule very well but when I try to run a test in textui  get an error<br/>\nmessage back saying that myFileTest can&#39;t be found.  Does the test I<br/>\nam running need to be on my classpath as well?  I am executing tests<br/>\nfrom the command line while I am in in the current directory where the<br/>\ntest and files to be tested live. swingui works well.  textui gives me<br/>\nerrors.  Why, if swingui works well, textui fails?  They seem to be<br/>\ncoming from the same folder and .jar file.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI am also trying to install JUnit on a PC and I am having similar<br/>\nproblems.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnybody got any ideas?</div>",
