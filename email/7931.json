He <br/>\n&gt; writes that counting the branches is difficult if the message which <br/>\n&gt; is sent is polymorph. (Page 156)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 2. I understand this to this point. But then he writes that the <br/>\n&gt; counting of branches is impossible if dynamic class loading is <br/>\n&gt; allowed. Why is it impossible then?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Because with dynamic class loading you can&#39;t tell what a message will do<br/>\n(you don&#39;t know the actual class of an object) until the object is<br/>\ninstantiated.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Another thing I don&#39;t understand is the a solution to the problem <br/>\n&gt; with the Square class which extends the Rectangle class.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The problem arises if a method &quot;stretchX(int factor)&quot; is added to <br/>\n&gt; the Rectangle class. Then you can override it in the Square class <br/>\n&gt; (so that Y is stretched too with the factor). But then a Square <br/>\n&gt; instance cannot be used everywhere where a Rectangle instance is can <br/>\n&gt; be used.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; He has three solution for this: reversing the extends relationship, <br/>\n&gt; extracting a common super class and introducing a value semantics <br/>\n&gt; (&quot;Wertesemantik&quot;).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 3. How does a solution look like with value semantics? I&#39;m not sure <br/>\n&gt; if I translated the word correctly.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I guess he thinks of immutable objects here - stretchX wouldn&#39;t change<br/>\nthe original square, but would return a newly created rectangle.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards, Ilja</div>",
