    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-467959825\">Hi Kishore,<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are several levels of automation that JTest provides.  Let me <br/>\ngo into a little bit more detail on each and let me know if there are <br/>\nfurther questions.<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Automatic White-Box Testing:  Jtest analyzes the structure of the <br/>\nclass under test then automatically generates test cases in order to <br/>\nexercise each method as fully as possible.  Out of the box, there is <br/>\nno way for the tool to know exactly what the intended logic of the <br/>\nmethod is, but, we determine all the paths of execution that can be <br/>\ntaken by a method and automatically generate test cases to force that <br/>\nexecution.  By doing so, we are generating a large suite of test <br/>\ncases that are ensuring the code is robust and not throwing any <br/>\nuncaught runtime exceptions, as well as building a suite of tests <br/>\nwhich can be used for regression testing.  As a side note, these <br/>\ntests JTest generates can be exported into JUnit test classes.<br/>\n<br/>\n2: Black Box Testing:  Jtest provides several ways to help speed up <br/>\nblack box testing as much as possible.  One way to define your own <br/>\ntests is by specifying simple values directly in the JTest UI.  The <br/>\nsecond is through JTest&#39;s generation of JUnit test classes.  You can <br/>\ntake the test classes Jtest automatically generates and extend upon <br/>\nthem to define the logic of the code.  Lastly, Jtest can <br/>\nautomatically generate a test case template including a corresponding <br/>\ntestXXX () method, as well as a setUp () and tearDown () method for <br/>\nevery method in your class.  These testXXX () methods will contain an <br/>\nempty test with a &quot;fail&quot; statement that can be replaced with your <br/>\nactual test code.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Design By Contract:  Design by ContractTM (DbC) is a formal way of <br/>\nusing comments to incorporate specification information into the code <br/>\nitself. Jtest uses the DbC specification information to automatically <br/>\ncreate and execute test cases that verify whether a class or <br/>\ncomponent functions as its DbC specification says it should function. <br/>\nWhen you test a class or component with Jtest, Jtest automatically <br/>\ncreates and executes black-box test cases as part of its normal <br/>\nbattery of tests. Jtest designs its black-box test cases as follows: <br/>\n<br/>\n*If the code has postconditions, Jtest creates test cases that verify <br/>\nwhether the code satisfies those conditions. <br/>\n<br/>\n*If the code has assert conditions, Jtest creates test cases that try <br/>\nto make the assertions fail. <br/>\n<br/>\n*If the code has invariant conditions, Jtest creates test cases that <br/>\ntry to make the invariant conditions fail. <br/>\n<br/>\n*If the code has preconditions, Jtest tries to find inputs that force <br/>\nall of the paths in the preconditions. <br/>\n<br/>\n*If the method under test calls other methods that have specified <br/>\npreconditions, Jtest determines if the method under test can pass non-<br/>\npermissible values to the other methods. <br/>\n<br/>\n4. Coding Standards:  Since this was brought up in the post, I <br/>\nthought I&#39;d clarify what Jtest adds here.  Jtest does not generate <br/>\ntest cases to check Coding Standards, but it actually parses the <br/>\nsource code of the .java file and compares it to a list of industry <br/>\nguidelines built-in to the tool or any custom rules your group <br/>\ndefines.  There are currently 326 built in standards and this feature <br/>\nis highly customizable.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope the above information was enough to help you understand what <br/>\nJtest is actually doing and where it adds value.
