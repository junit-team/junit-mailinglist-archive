However, \nsometimes certain things just are coupled, like a subclass to it&#39;s \nsuperclass. The class data for the superclass should exist before \nthe subclass, etc.\n\nAlso, sometimes the more loosely coupled something is, the HARDER it \nis to reset it&#39;s cached data (across all interactions). And I guess \nthis is really the problem. I want to zero out all cached data \nwithout having to know about the couplings that were created \ndynamically.\n\nR.\n\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, Jason Rogers &lt;jacaetevha@f...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Think of it this way...  MockObjects are NOT just a way of testing \ncode,\n&gt; they are a tool used to design loosely coupled, well factored \nsystems. \n&gt; If you can easily mock out the whole of an encompassing system in \norder\n&gt; to test one itty-bitty unit, you PROBABLY have done a very good \njob of\n&gt; following the creme-de-la-creme principles of Object Oriented\n&gt; Programming.  I don&#39;t look at them as kludges.\n&gt; \n&gt; The real issue may not be the test code.  It may be in the design \nof the\n&gt; production code, &quot;may&quot; being the operative word here since I don&#39;t\n&gt; presume to pass judgment on your code base.\n&gt; \n&gt; HTH,\n&gt; =jason\n&gt; \n&gt; On Mon, 2003-06-16 at 16:48, robert_difalco wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Is there a way to get each test method to run in it&#39;s own JVM? I \nam \n&gt; &gt; finding that setUp and tearDown are not enough. I have a lot of \ncode \n&gt; &gt; that has to reset static state such as caches each time a test \nis \n&gt; &gt; run, code that is only needed for unit testing. If each test \nmethod \n&gt; &gt; ran in it&#39;s own JVM, my testing code would not require me to \nmake \n&gt; &gt; changes in the code I am testing.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; It&#39;s not just singletons but also caches that should be \ninitialized \n&gt; &gt; once for a JVM. And, honestly, if you think about it, each test \n&gt; &gt; method SHOULD be atomic. Mock objects seemed kind of like a \nkludge \n&gt; &gt; for tests not being run atomically.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thoughts?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; R.\n\n\n\n",
