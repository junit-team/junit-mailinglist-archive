Point well taken. back to the main track.<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote type=\"cite\" cite>&nbsp;I wanted to point out the potential\nflaws of design and<br>\ntesting that could otherwise be missed when you put tests in the\nsame<br>\npackage as production code.&nbsp; The production code should be tested in\nthe<br>\nsame fashion it would be used by a client.&nbsp; A test is a client in\nsome<br>\ndegree.&nbsp; In most cases clients exist outside of the package. <br>\n[..snip]<br>\nThus,<br>\nI conclude, that testing the public interfaces of ALL objects (the key\nbeing<br>\nALL) should prove sufficient, thus not needing the tests to reside in\nthe<br>\nsame package as their associated production code objects.&nbsp; Of\ncourse, there<br>\nare exceptions... we have ways around those.</blockquote><br>\nIn an ideal world, you&#39;re right. Testing *all* the public methods should\ngive you complete functional coverage. <br>\nHowever:<br>\n1. You might want to put more stress on some classes and less on others.\nIn this case, you might want to test more then the public methods of\ncritical-path components, and less of the peripherals.<br>\n2. You might want to access non-public methods in your setUp /\ntearDown.<br>\n3. Sometimes the tested class needs a sophisticated context in runtime\n(EJB / Servlet). In this case, you might want to short circuit it in\ntesting by calling protected / default access methods that would be\ncalled by the public interface in production mode.<br>\n<br>\nTrue, you might call all these &quot;exceptions&quot;. True, they deter\nfrom the pure model. Still, they are common, and are easily resolved by\nplacing tests in the same package. On the other hand, I don&#39;t see the\nactual harm of doing so.<br>\n<br>\nB.t.w., the right access mode for &quot;accessible in package only&quot;\nis &quot;default&quot;. &quot;protected&quot; makes it accessible to both\npackage members and subclassses. <br>\n<br>\n- Yishay <br>\n\n<hr>\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yishay\nMor<br>\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cisco\nsystems, EMBU Israel&nbsp; (QPM project)<br>\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; work&nbsp;\n+972-9-9700031 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; home +972-4-6396602\n<br>\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ymor@...</span></blockquote></html>\n\n\n</div>",
