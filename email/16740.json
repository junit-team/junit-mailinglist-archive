This might or might not<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; concern your team at this time.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This is Alberto jumping in again to set the record straight on<br/>\n&gt; Agitator ...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hi Joe, you might not remember me but we exchanged emails a couple of<br/>\n&gt; years ago, and I am a big fan of yours for all the work you have done<br/>\n&gt; to educate people about JUnit through your book and online presence.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Anyway ... your description of using Agitator to complement TDD is<br/>\n&gt; spot-on (for people who do TDD) - thank you for jumping in and helping<br/>\n&gt; in setting the record straight.  But you also state (I paraphrase):<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Agitator does not help you identify design problems or motivate you<br/>\n&gt; to improve the design&quot;.  We have actually found, somewhat<br/>\n&gt; serendipitously, that Agitator does indeed help you in identifying<br/>\n&gt; design problems and even provides you compelling motivations to<br/>\n&gt; address them (e.g. well designed code Agitates better).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; A simple example, of Agitator helping you improve your design is<br/>\n&gt; blogged on developertesting.com:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.developertesting.com/archives/month200402/20040226-TestDrivenDevelopmentAndAgitatorDrivenRefactoring.html\">http://www.developertesting.com/archives/month200402/20040226-TestDrivenDevelopmentAndAgitatorDrivenRefactoring.html</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Again, this does not mean that Agitator replaces TDD, but it can<br/>\n&gt; complement TDD efforts (our own Dashboard product was developed<br/>\n&gt; practicing TDD, pair-programming, etc., AND Agitator of course).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is an interesting article, Alberto, and I thank you for involving <br/>\nyourself in this thread. It&#39;s great to have you here.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow I don&#39;t necessarily agree that checking an exception message is <br/>\n/good design/. I also don&#39;t necessarily agree that having a negative <br/>\nvalue for &#39;score&#39; is cause for an exception--it depends where the system <br/>\nboundaries are.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven with all that, it is clear that Agitator did help Jeffrey follow <br/>\nhis coding style, and that is quite good.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, I should mention that this is not the kind of design problem I <br/>\nhave in mind when I made my admittedly baseless claim. Since it was <br/>\nbaseless, I should revise my claim. Here it is:<br/>\n<br/>\n     When I write JUnit tests, I am forced to deal with dependency<br/>\n     problems in my code. I don&#39;t yet have any evidence that Agitator<br/>\n     would help me with that. I am concerned that since Agitator helps<br/>\n     me /not/ write JUnit tests, it might also help me /not/ feel the<br/>\n     pain of those kinds of dependency problems.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for helping me clarify things, Alberto. I don&#39;t like <br/>\nmisrepresenting someone else&#39;s product.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
