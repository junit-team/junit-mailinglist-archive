Maybe someone out their uses <br/>\nEclipse and can point me in the right direction.<br/>\n<br/>\nI downloaded Eclipse and it appears to have JUnit as part of the <br/>\ndownload. When I try to use JUnit as per the the &quot;Eclipse in Action <br/>\nWorkbook&quot; I do not get the results the book indicates. Basically I <br/>\ncan&#39;t get it to work. Also the release level of JUnit does not match <br/>\nthe book either.<br/>\n<br/>\nI assume I should download the latest release of JUnit and install <br/>\nit. Is their somewhere I can obtain install instructions for JUnit?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance for any help provided.<br/>\n<br/>\nJared</div>",
