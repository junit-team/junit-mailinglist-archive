ScalaTest is for all\n&gt; practical purpos=\r\nes a &quot;JUnit add-on&quot; that facilitates using JUnit and\n&gt; Scala together. The =\r\npromise is that by writing tests in Scala, you can\n&gt; reduce the lines of te=\r\nst code you need to maintain by half or more,\n&gt; and at the same time increa=\r\nse the clarity of that code. That&#39;s the\n&gt; benefit. The up front cost is you=\r\n need to learn Scala. But ScalaTest\n&gt; does let you mix in tests written in =\r\nScala with your existing tests\n&gt; written in Java, so it is easy to dip your=\r\n toe in before jumping in. I\n&gt; also think writing tests in Scala is a good =\r\nway to start learning and\n&gt; getting experience with Scala, because it is im=\r\nportant code, but not\n&gt; your production code. So it reduces the risk of try=\r\ning a new language.\n&gt; And you can certainly write tests in Scala to test pr=\r\noduction code\n&gt; written in Java.\n&gt;\n&gt; You can get a good overview of ScalaTe=\r\nst&#39;s JUnit integration on this page:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www.scalatest.org/getting_s=\r\ntarted_with_junit\n&gt;\n&gt; You can see we have good integration with both JUnit =\r\n3 and 4 (because\n&gt; I know many people are still using JUnit 3). One other t=\r\nhing to keep\n&gt; in mind is that because of the org.junit.runner.Runner class=\r\n, which we\n&gt; extend in our org.scalatest.junit.JUnitRunner class, you can p=\r\nretty\n&gt; much write tests in any style you want and run them with JUnit. For=\r\n\n&gt; example, you could write in a Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) style\n&gt; =\r\nand still run the tests with JUnit. So ScalaTest adds BDD to JUnit in\n&gt; eff=\r\nect, and other styles as well. By annotating with JUnitRunner, you\n&gt; can us=\r\ne JUnit to run tests written with any of the &quot;Suite&quot; or &quot;Spec&quot;\n&gt; traits you=\r\n see here:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www.scalatest.org/quick_start\n&gt;\n&gt; Here&#39;s a list of th=\r\ne ScalaTest/JUnit integration points:\n&gt;\n&gt; - AssertionsForJUnit, ShouldMatch=\r\nersForJUnit, and\n&gt; MustMatchersForJUnit, which provide concise, readable as=\r\nsertion and\n&gt; matcher DSLs, ensure that assertion failures are reported as\n=\r\n&gt; &quot;failures&quot; not &quot;errors&quot; by JUnit and its ecosystem\n&gt; - JUnit3Suite extend=\r\ns junit.framework.TestCase as well as\n&gt; org.scalatest.Suite, which allows y=\r\nou to write traditional TestCase\n&gt; tests that can be run by either JUnit 3 =\r\nor ScalaTest\n&gt; - JUnitSuite extends org.scalatest.Suite, and allows you to =\r\nwrite\n&gt; traditional JUnit 4-style tests (with @Test annotation, etc.) that =\r\ncan\n&gt; be run by either JUnit 4 or ScalaTest\n&gt; - JUnitWrapperSuite allows yo=\r\nu to run existing JUnit tests written in\n&gt; Java (or Groovy, etc.) with Scal=\r\naTest&#39;s Runner\n&gt; - JUnitRunner allows you to run any ScalaTest Suite writte=\r\nn in any\n&gt; style (such as BDD) with JUnit\n&gt; - ScalaTest&#39;s Runner has a -j o=\r\nption that allows you to specify JUnit\n&gt; tests written in Java (or Groovy, =\r\netc.) and have them run alongside\n&gt; ScalaTest tests (i.e., so you get one u=\r\nniform report)\n&gt; - ScalaTest&#39;s Ant task can generate the XML format produce=\r\nd by the\n&gt; JUnit ant task, which can then be used by JUnitReport ant task,\n=\r\n&gt; Hudson, etc., to produce reports.\n&gt;\n&gt; Let me know if anyone has any quest=\r\nions. I&#39;ll keep an eye on this\n&gt; list, but you might get a quicker response=\r\n if you cross-post\n&gt; JUnit-related ScalaTest questions to the scalatest-use=\r\nrs mailing list\n&gt; as well.\n&gt;\n&gt; http://groups.google.com/group/scalatest-use=\r\nrs\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks.\n&gt;\n&gt; Bill\n&gt; ----\n&gt; Bill Venners\n&gt; Artima, Inc.\n&gt; http://www.a=\r\nrtima.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
