I assumed that each of th=\r\ne tests would get the parameters as they are defined in the parameter secti=\r\non, not after they&#39;ve been modified by a previous test method. I&#39;m used to =\r\nthe 3.8 &quot;every test starts out fresh&quot; idea. That isn&#39;t happening. One of th=\r\ne parameters is &quot;new StringBuilder()&quot;. I expected both methods to get an em=\r\npty StringBuilder. But, the second method is getting the StringBuilder with=\r\n the contents added in the first method.\n\nI tried resetting it in an @After=\r\n method just to see what happens. The code to set it to a new StringBuilder=\r\n is executed but the second test method still gets the StringBuilder with t=\r\nhe contents added by the first method.\n\nIs this the expected behavior?\n\n---=\r\n In junit@yahoogroups.com, David Saff &lt;saff@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hmm, that&#39;s odd=\r\n.  Not expected behavior.\n&gt; \n&gt; Were any of your parameters mutable types, s=\r\nuch that if a value were shared\n&gt; between multiple invocations, it could ha=\r\nve been modified from one\n&gt; invocation, with effects seen in the next?\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n Any chance you could share at least a skeleton of your test case?
