MethodRule allows you to do things based on the specific test name, and intercept and even replace the running of a test. Consider ExpectedException. You really could not do anything like that in a @Before or @After method. You would have to do it inside your test and use an execute around pattern to handle the exception.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor your use case it is a drop more boilerplate than a rule, but all you would do is define a @Before method in a common superclass or in your @Before call a class that encapsulates the functionality. Yes you have to wrap the call in a method rather than defining a field, but Java is kind of verbose already.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, Max Bowsher &lt;maxb@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On 22/04/10 15:00, yme0987654321 wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Max,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; If that is your use case, what isn&#39;t accomplished with the @BeforeClass method? <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; There&#39;s nothing you can do with a method @Rule that you can&#39;t do with a<br/>\n&gt; @Before and @After, but rules allow packaging and re-use of<br/>\n&gt; setup/teardown behaviour.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I want the same advantages at a class level situation.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Max.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, Max Bowsher &lt;maxb@&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; On 22/04/10 00:49, Kent Beck wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; I&#39;m not satisfied with the assymmetry between Rule and ClassRule.

In the git branch, Rule is an <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; annotation and ClassRule an interface so I don&#39;t understand what you <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; mean by asymmetry.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; What should be MethodRule?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Changing existing rules is inevitable, since MethodRule#apply operates <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; in the context of a FrameworkMethod and an instantiated target object, <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; neither of which are available at class scope.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Also, I&#39;m not happy about encouraging more extra-test state as this reduces the chances that tests are independent. I&#39;m feeling quite the fuddy-duddy on this, though.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; If I have a supporting database that I need to load from an SQL dump, <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; and then want to run 20 different tests using it, it&#39;s not a very <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; palatable option to needlessly reload the databsae 20 times instead of 1.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I agree I&#39;m taking liberties with the definition of a _unit_ test by <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; doing so, but when dealing with legacy code and legacy testsuites, <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; sometimes a philosophically-impure test is better than no test at all.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Max.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
