(a pure Java implementation for the popular Ruby BDD tool).<br/>\n<br/>\nCucumber-JVM has some decent JUnit integration (a custom runner), but there is one little snag making it a little painful to use [1]. I have submitted a pull request for that [2].<br/>\n<br/>\nI realise you have a lot of open tickets, and need to make sure stuff doesn&#39;t break. I&#39;m not saying my pull request should be treated any differently than others. But it would be good to know whether you think it will be in 4.11 and approximately when it&#39;s due.<br/>\n<br/>\nKnowing it&#39;s not likely to be released any time soon would be helpful too, we&#39;d have to hack our way around it (we&#39;ve tried before - it&#39;s hard).<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\nAslak<br/>\n<br/>\n[1] <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/KentBeck/junit/pull/405\">https://github.com/KentBeck/junit/pull/405</a><br/>\n[2] <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-jvm/issues/225\">https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-jvm/issues/225</a></div>",
