An &#39;inner&#39; class <br/>\nMUST be bound to an instance of the outer class, and thus can&#39;t be <br/>\nstatic.  What you are talking about here I think is referred to as a <br/>\n&#39;nested&#39; class.  Which is declared exactly like you would expect a <br/>\n&#39;static inner class&#39; to be declared if that&#39;s what it was called:-).  I <br/>\nremember hearing the term &#39;top level nested class&#39;  I think it was in <br/>\nan article on jRoundup.com.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t agree.  For one reason, the type-safe-enum pattern is still a<br/>\nviable pattern.  I often use StICs to represent these.  I know that it<br/>\nisn&#39;t necessary, but it helps a great deal in packaging my classes<br/>\naccording to intent of use.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, in my tests I will often times create a mock object as a StIC that<br/>\nis either the only implementation of an interface/abstract class in the<br/>\ntesting world, or is just a very specific implementation of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI will post examples if anyone is interested.<br/>\n<br/>\n=jason</div>",
