In my case, Spring Test does an automatic transaction=\r\n rollback after every test method, so there are no dependencies between tes=\r\nts -- so thats not a problem.  Because of the rollback, it is also the case=\r\n that they order of the test runs also doesn&#39;t matter.  The database is res=\r\net to a &quot;known&quot; state after each test method by the transactional rollback.=\r\n\n\nI&#39;d just like to load the data once rather than 50 times.  But the @Befor=\r\neClass requirement to be a static method makes it impossible to use.   Is t=\r\nhere any trigger that can run after a class is initialized by Spring and be=\r\nfore any test method is executed?\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, Mike Forsb=\r\nerg &lt;bigmike.f@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I would advise against that unless you were =\r\nfollowing the following guide\n&gt; lines....\n&gt; - No test method (or called met=\r\nhod) manipulates the data base.\n&gt; - The order of the test methods do not ca=\r\nuse conflicts with each other with\n&gt; required data being there.\n&gt; \n&gt; Some t=\r\nhings I&#39;d try before doing the @BeforeClass\n&gt; - Only populate the data you =\r\nneed for a given set of tests.  (Don&#39;t populate\n&gt; the _whole_ database.)\n&gt; =\r\n- Which of the DBUnit population features are you using... I think there is=\r\n\n&gt; one that will revert to a known state, without the delete and insert.  T=\r\nhis\n&gt; may save some time.\n&gt; - Try to use a non-commitable transaction for t=\r\nesting.  After all, one\n&gt; shouldn&#39;t need to test the commit functionality. =\r\n If that breaks more than\n&gt; just you will have problems.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hope I helped=\r\n,\n&gt; \n&gt; Big Mike\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Wed, Jun 30, 2010 at 8:32 PM, hdave321321 &lt;hdave=\r\n321321@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; My DAO integration tests are taking a lon=\r\ng time to run.
