B. Rainsberger wrote:\n\n&gt; Ladies and Gentlemen:\n&gt;\n&gt; I am frankly quite concerned with the quality of the exchanges going on here\n&gt; in the last several weeks. It appears that many people think there are\n&gt; &quot;magic formulas&quot; for working with JUnit. As a result, they ask silly\n&gt; questions like, &quot;How do I test an EJB with JUnit????&quot; The people who know\n&gt; the answer get so tired of writing, &quot;Search this list. Try it. What are you\n&gt; having trouble testing?&quot; that they simply stop responding. As a result,\n&gt; questions are not being answered.\n&gt;\n&gt; I would like to ask everyone on this list to ask specific, pointed\n&gt; questions, with sample code, if at all possible. Instead of &quot;How to I test\n&gt; an EJB????&quot;, how about, &quot;I did X, Y and Z to test EJBs using JUnit, but it&#39;s\n&gt; too slow. Any tips for increasing speed? Here is a sample EJB tets case...&quot;?\n&gt;\n&gt; If you really don&#39;t know how to do X, try searching the web first. Try\n&gt; searching this list&#39;s archives next. If that does not get you going, then by\n&gt; all means, ask a specific, pointed question.\n&gt;\n&gt; Please, folks! I don&#39;t want to start ignoring this list because its readers\n&gt; show no initiative.\n&gt;\n&gt; JBR.\n&gt;\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
