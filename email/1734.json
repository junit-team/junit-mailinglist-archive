The private <br/>\nfunctionality being tested perhaps belongs in another <br/>\nclass.  The privates become publics in the new class,<br/>\neliminating the issue of having to test privates.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother possible downside of testing privates is that <br/>\nit can be a hindrance to refactoring.  The nice thing <br/>\nabout not testing private methods is that you are free<br/>\nto change the implementation of your class with <br/>\nimpunity.  When client test code uses privates, it makes <br/>\nrefactoring far more difficult.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, I do find myself testing privates sometimes.<br/>\nIn the course of incremental development, my goal is to<br/>\nget to a green bar within a very brief amount of time.<br/>\nAs such, I&#39;ve found sometimes the best way to accomplish <br/>\nthis with a large piece of functionality is to decompose <br/>\nit into pieces of the overall algorithm.  These become <br/>\nprivates (technically package or protected in Java), each <br/>\nof which gets tested individually.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, regarding private methods in servlets: view <br/>\nservlets as the user interface code.  You really can&#39;t<br/>\ntest privates (what I call &quot;side effects&quot;) of servlets <br/>\neasily.  All you can effectively do is test expected <br/>\noutput (URLs & HTML) against input (key-value pairs) <br/>\nvia HTTPUnit or some other similar tool.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you find yourself needing to test privates, then, it<br/>\nsuggests that the servlet code is doing too much.  My<br/>\nservlets are virtually empty: the service methods simply<br/>\ndelegate things off to some other model object.  The model<br/>\n(which represents application concerns at this level) has<br/>\nalready been built test-first.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Jeff<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Lindanger Trond Kjetil<br/>\n&gt; [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:trond-kjetil.lindanger@...\">trond-kjetil.lindanger@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Friday, June 29, 2001 12:02 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: [junit] Testing Private Methods<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Isn&#39;t this the same as saying that you don&#39;t have to test<br/>\n&gt; units/ classes since if the user interface has been proven to behave<br/>\n&gt; correctly, <br/>\n&gt; then the units/ classes has been proven to be bug free.<br/>\n&gt; I think this is a spooky approach.<br/>\n&gt; By the way, has anybody an idea of how to test private <br/>\n&gt; methods in servlets?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Trond Lindanger<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rainsber@...\">rainsber@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rainsber@...\">rainsber@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: 28. juni 2001 17:52<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [junit] Testing Private Methods<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Yes. Don&#39;t test protected and package-protected methods.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; A quote from the XP discussion group.<br/>\n&gt; (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://208.48.218.9/group/extremeprogramming/message/13213)\">http://208.48.218.9/group/extremeprogramming/message/13213)</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;I actually do think that it is cut and dried. Public members have a<br/>\n&gt; behavior that is expected of them by their clients. Tests can <br/>\n&gt; be used to<br/>\n&gt; define that behavior and demonstrate that a particular method <br/>\n&gt; exhibits it.<br/>\n&gt; Private methods are, by definition, implementation details. <br/>\n&gt; Their behavior<br/>\n&gt; can vary freely so long as the public methods don&#39;t break. <br/>\n&gt; Put another way:<br/>\n&gt; if every public method has been proven to behave correctly <br/>\n&gt; then the class<br/>\n&gt; has been proven to be bug free. Therefore, there is never a <br/>\n&gt; need to test<br/>\n&gt; the private members of a class.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So can you avoid testing them? If so, then don&#39;t; if not, <br/>\n&gt; then you can&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; have it both ways: either the tests are in the class (to test private<br/>\n&gt; methods),<br/>\n&gt; in the package (to test protected/package methods) or you <br/>\n&gt; can&#39;t test those<br/>\n&gt; methods. There&#39;s no magic here...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Good luck,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; J. B.

It <br/>\n&gt; seems like its<br/>\n&gt; not going to be possible to do it while separating the <br/>\n&gt; TestCase classes and<br/>\n&gt; the business object classes.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; One of the reasons I see a difficulty is that we are using <br/>\n&gt; VisualAge for<br/>\n&gt; Java and it would make it a deployment nightmare to include <br/>\n&gt; the code in the<br/>\n&gt; same packages or, worse yet, the same classes.  I know that there are<br/>\n&gt; options I could use outside of VA such as ANT to only build certain<br/>\n&gt; classes,<br/>\n&gt; but I doubt I could get the client to buy into that and I <br/>\n&gt; still don&#39;t think<br/>\n&gt; that solves the private method issue.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Am I just missing something easy or what?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks,<br/>\n&gt; Mike<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
