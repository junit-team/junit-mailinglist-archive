(I will also claim that thorough testing promotes good<br/>\n&gt; design, but that&#39;s because I&#39;m a TDD true believer.)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Agreed, however, when I don&#39;t know what to do, I minimize the amount of <br/>\nuntested code, which is what a thin GUI is all about. I don&#39;t think you <br/>\ncan argue that this is a bad practice. One has to start somewhere.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow it turns out that the mere act of minimizing the amount of untested <br/>\ncode introduces other improvements in the design. This has been my <br/>\nexperience, and I&#39;m quite happy with it. This motivates me to continue <br/>\nto use this approach, even though the original motivation for it no <br/>\nlonger exists.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, now that I have confidence in my ability to test web page <br/>\ntemplates in isolation -- something I didn&#39;t have in the past -- I test <br/>\nthem. Did you miss that part of what I&#39;d written?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d appreciate it if you&#39;d lecture less and discuss more. Perhaps I am <br/>\njust being a bit sensitive, but I find your approach a little brusque, <br/>\nbordering on rude.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
