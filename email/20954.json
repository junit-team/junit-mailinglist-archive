I&#39;ve known<br/>\nmany people who have gotten ramped up with Eclipse and JUnit without a<br/>\nlot of pain, microkernels or no.  Can you share one particular problem<br/>\nyou&#39;ve had?<br/>\n<br/>\n   David Saff<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Tue, Oct 7, 2008 at 12:11 PM, John van V. &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:john.van.v@...\">john.van.v@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; wennnnke wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I think the book &quot;Test-Driven Development by Example&quot; is a good start<br/>\n&gt; point.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks, I think I should add that the most successful administration<br/>\n&gt; that I did was all based on &quot;images.&quot; I say images because I cannot<br/>\n&gt; think of a better word.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The GNU crowd was insisting on source code distribution, and then Red<br/>\n&gt; Hat and Debian implemented binary &quot;package&quot; manager tools, but I found<br/>\n&gt; that simply creating an independent application directory (/opt had<br/>\n&gt; just been embraced) and writing to it (using tar and ssh) would<br/>\n&gt; install instantly a fully configured application, that would include<br/>\n&gt; all the necessary libraries, especially those that might clash with<br/>\n&gt; system-distributed libraries.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This would provide a fully operational (and hardened) application<br/>\n&gt; (usually server) distribution, and of course would run completely<br/>\n&gt; against the Windows methodology of using a &quot;registry,&quot; which<br/>\n&gt; apparently defeats this kind of distribution.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In terms of Eclipse, it would be nice to have fully configured<br/>\n&gt; sub-sections, such as JUnit, that are known to run on a specific<br/>\n&gt; Eclipse install so that newbies could have a running start, rather<br/>\n&gt; than having to suffer weeks of thrashing around such as I have just<br/>\n&gt; experienced.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The Java &quot;culture&quot; it seems goes beyond the Windows in making<br/>\n&gt; something simple like this impossible, and the Eclipse &quot;culture&quot;<br/>\n&gt; openly states that their application is not tested on the latest Java<br/>\n&gt; VMs. Paraphrasing, &quot;your application may or may not work.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have strong interest in microkernels that follow the patterns of<br/>\n&gt; LibOS, and I strongly support the idea of an image library as a<br/>\n&gt; working repository for versions of L4. If you are curious, my ThinMan<br/>\n&gt; idea grew out of a desire to see gaming stations become regular<br/>\n&gt; workstations, and evolved into the idea of a fully distributed network<br/>\n&gt; with few if any centralized servers, except perhaps support servers<br/>\n&gt; and legacy e-commerce machines.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://thinman.com\">http://thinman.com</a><br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
