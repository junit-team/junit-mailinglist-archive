Works fine run in Eclipse on Mac as an application or JUnit test but fails when run as JUnit plugin test. Frame would show 1 out of 5 or so times. Removing all unneeded plugins resulted in frame always being shown but the click never seems to happen.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also tried Window Licker and the included Calculator test(s) - same thing...  runs as a JUnit Test but fails as a JUnit Plugin Test. One time the frame was shown, but nothing happened (so the test failed). The other times, the frame didn&#39;t even show. Tried removing all VM args and unnecessary plugins.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs this related to the args that Eclipse uses to run plugin tests on Mac? Or the core plugins included to run the tests? Or...?<br/>\n<br/>\nShaun.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, Dale Emery &lt;dale@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi whoever you are,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hi - thanks for your reply. I&#39;m actually using Alex Ruiz&#39;s FEST for our testing and it works quite well on Windows. With or without FEST on the Mac, I can&#39;t seem to get any UI tests to run. The initial frame/window comes up in some cases but I can&#39;t do much more than that. When running JUnit tests (again with or without FEST), I don&#39;t even see the frame.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve gone through what docs there are for FEST and have read the blog/article but I can&#39;t figure it out.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve used FEST to test Swing code on a toy project:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/dhemery/towers.dead\">https://github.com/dhemery/towers.dead</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Later I restarted the project and used WindowLicker instead:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/dhemery/Towers\">https://github.com/dhemery/Towers</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s been a while since I visited either project, but I think the (few) UI tests run. Neither version of the code does much, so there aren&#39;t many UI tests. The older one (which uses FEST) has more features and tests.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I wrote all of this code on Macs running Snow Leopard and Eclipse Ganymede. I haven&#39;t tried it on Lion or Helios.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Dale<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; Dale Emery<br/>\n&gt; Consultant to software teams and leaders<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://dhemery.com\">http://dhemery.com</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
