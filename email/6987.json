In our organisation<br/>\ntesting is evolving. Additionally there is a common<br/>\nproblem of Devlopment Vs Testing arguments. In any<br/>\nregression round if a new bug comes in then the issue<br/>\nraised will be why this bug was not identified in<br/>\nprevious round though it will be fixed later. We<br/>\nthought over and looked into the possibility of<br/>\nchecking effectiveness of testing. As the process is<br/>\nstill evolving Testing gets less amount of inputs ...<br/>\nin all sense - time, resource, documents, functional<br/>\ntraining... ! <br/>\n<br/>\nMy question is, in such constraints how one can<br/>\nmeasure and control the effectiveness of Testing? <br/>\nThis is typically for Manual Testing. The issue of<br/>\nAutomated Testing remains apart ... :)<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards, Manish<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nMissed your favourite TV serial last night?
