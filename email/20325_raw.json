So, the unit test could pass\n&gt;=\r\n mock dependencies to its constructor.  The real code would pass real\n&gt; dep=\r\nendencies to its constructors.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;  2) Should my unit tests cover this &#39;=\r\nInitializing real time\nobjects&#39; as\n&gt; &gt;  well ?\n&gt; \n&gt; The unit tests of objec=\r\nts that are made up of other objects (composite\n&gt; objects) would test the b=\r\nehaviour of those composite objects and,\n&gt; thereby, test how the internal p=\r\narts of those composites are\n&gt; initialised.\n&gt; \n&gt; End-to-end tests cover the=\r\n correct initialisation of all the objects\n&gt; in the system.\n&gt; \n&gt; Usually a =\r\nbuild runs unit tests and then a smoke test that runs a fast\n&gt; end-to-end t=\r\nest to check for obvious integration errors.  Then it runs\n&gt; more extensive=\r\n end-to-end tests to exercise the features that users\n&gt; care about.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n 3) What way I can assure that my &#39;Real&#39; objects are initialized\n&gt; &gt;  prope=\r\nrly ?\n&gt; \n&gt; In TDD, you start with an end-to-end test.  Only when you have a=\r\n\n&gt; failing end-to-end test for a given feature do you start drilling down\n&gt;=\r\n to write unit tests for individual objects.\n&gt; \n&gt; --Nat\n&gt;\n\n\n\n",
