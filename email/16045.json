Pressure from above (AKA politics) will force people to sign up<br/>\nand agree to totally unrealistic schedules. So, quality goes out the door.<br/>\nThis is okay because most of the time the accounting looks at cost/schedule<br/>\nfor initial development. The accounting often does not track the costs for<br/>\nmaintenance. After all, they have to spend money on production support and<br/>\nmaintenance anyways.<br/>\n<br/>\nHiring consultants that bills by the author falls into this category.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Out sourced for fixed price. Lets just say that the accounting dynamics<br/>\nhere are a lot different.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;As developers of desktop GUI applications<br/>\n&gt;(Swing/Eclipse SWT/WinForms .NET) - its a bit more difficult<br/>\n&gt;to test some of our code<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I realize that the following question does not belong in the JUnit mailing<br/>\nlist. However, request the favor of a quick indulgence. Would you be willing<br/>\nto share some url&#39;s that talk about testing Swing apps ?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  -----Original Message-----<br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>]On Behalf Of<br/>\nMark Levison<br/>\n  Sent: Thursday, February 09, 2006 8:40 PM<br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n  Subject: Re: [junit] Is Junit-based testing REALLY possible for commercial<br/>\nsoftware development ?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   On 2/9/06, frank zou &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:frankz1998@...\">frankz1998@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; Hi all,<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; After lots of reading and trying, I think I understand the following<br/>\n  &gt; benefits that Junit-base testing can give us:<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; * more robust system<br/>\n  &gt; * clean / good design<br/>\n  &gt; * less regression bugs<br/>\n  &gt; * confidence to do refactorying, especially at the later phase of the<br/>\n  &gt; project.<br/>\n  &gt; * and lots more...<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; These are really good things, for open-source projects where there is<br/>\n  &gt; no deadline pressure and resource could almost be thought as<br/>\n  &gt; un-limitted. However, for commercial software development, is this<br/>\n  &gt; still possible ?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Definitely - my team has been doing it for 5+ years, over several projects<br/>\n  spanning several languages. Our products while not bug free have fewer<br/>\nthan<br/>\n  many I&#39;ve known along the way. As developers of desktop GUI applications<br/>\n  (Swing/Eclipse SWT/WinForms .NET) - its a bit more difficult to test some<br/>\nof<br/>\n  our code - but none the less our overall test coverage has been around<br/>\n65%.<br/>\n  In the end I think it takes us less time not more to develop our products<br/>\n  writing tests. That said a few members of the team still need proding to<br/>\n  write their test cases.<br/>\n<br/>\n  * One intersting point I found is that after Junit-based testing is<br/>\n  &gt; introduced, programmers tend to use IDE debugger much less than<br/>\n  &gt; before.  This would save lots of time. Is that true ?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Yes very true - in fact when bugs show up in our GUI code I usually try to<br/>\n  write a test case to replicate them. When I have to debug its much faster<br/>\nto<br/>\n  debug from a test case than clicking around in the GUI.<br/>\n<br/>\n  * Some guys say JUnit is good for biz / util code testing. But for web<br/>\n  &gt; application development, where HTML/javascript would be root cause of<br/>\n  &gt; lots of bugs, Junit is not so powerful. Any comments ?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Lots of people do this sort of testing FIT (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://fit.c2.com/)\">http://fit.c2.com/)</a> or<br/>\nsimiliar<br/>\n  frameworks. I don&#39;t know much about it since I&#39;ve never done javascript.<br/>\n<br/>\n  * How can I convince managers and programmers that JUnit-based is<br/>\n  &gt; really possible for commercial software development ? Any differnece<br/>\n  &gt; from open-source projects ?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Show them the number of replies on this list? Also start writing tests in<br/>\n  you&#39;re own corner of the world. Integrate them into your build. Give a<br/>\nshort<br/>\n  live demo at lunch. Bring you&#39;re co-workers in for some pair programming,<br/>\n  .....<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Cheers<br/>\n  Mark Levison<br/>\n  ----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n  Blog: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://dotnetjunkies.com/WebLog/mlevison/\">http://dotnetjunkies.com/WebLog/mlevison/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  SPONSORED LINKS Basic programming language  C programming language<br/>\nComputer programming languages<br/>\n        The c programming language  C programming language  List of<br/>\nprogramming languages<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n--<br/>\n  YAHOO!
