My point is just that I suspect you are<br/>\nonly thinking of JUnit-based unit tests.  And I would<br/>\nagree that 14 hours of unit tests seems pretty weird.<br/>\nBut we&#39;re running JUnit-based system and acceptance<br/>\ntests.  In my experience 14 hours of automated system<br/>\ntesting isn&#39;t that unusual for a reasonably large and<br/>\ncomplex software system.<br/>\n<br/>\nAre they all valuable?  Yes, I think so.  They all have<br/>\ncaught or could catch bugs.  In fact, if we had time, <br/>\nwe would write more tests that would take even longer<br/>\nto run, since I don&#39;t think we have the test coverage<br/>\nI&#39;d like.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as the speed of feedback for 14 hour tests, again<br/>\nthese are system (&quot;QA&quot;) type tests.  Comparing a 2 day<br/>\nfeedback cycle to a 6 week feedback cycle (which is what<br/>\nwe&#39;ve had on past projects) the 2 days is obviously a<br/>\nmonumental step forward.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTodd.</div>",
