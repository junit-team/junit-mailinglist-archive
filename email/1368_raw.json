[mailto:wegfn06@...]\n&gt; Sent: Friday, June 01, 2001 8:22 AM\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: [junit] Research on the success of JUnit on projects\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Hi All,\n&gt; \n&gt; I am compiling a small piece of research about JUnit.  I want my \n&gt; company to start using it, but in order to sell the idea I would like \n&gt; to be able to call on success/failure stories of the use of JUnit on \n&gt; projects.  If you have the time, I would appreciate any stories of \n&gt; how JUnit was used successfully on your project, where there any \n&gt; disadvantages of using JUnit, do you think it improved your \n&gt; productivity etc?  I would like to quote companies, but I appreciate \n&gt; that you may think this is sensitive material, so I think the best I \n&gt; can hope for is to see if the majority of responses liked using JUnit \n&gt; or not.  Either way, thank you in advance for your help.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards\n&gt; \n&gt; Mik Q\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
