Also, I&#39;m aware of junitejb, which again seems geared\n&gt; towards testing through a session bean interface.\n&gt; \n\nCactus will offer a direct EJB redirector in the near future that will\nmake it even easier to use for EJB unit testing.\n\n&gt; In many ways, I think the issues i&#39;m facing are those discussed often\n&gt; on this list regarding testing of database code.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have a set of entity beans (CMP2.0) with a Stateless Session Bean\n&gt; facade, and a business delegate (plain old java object) fronting the\n&gt; stateless session bean.  I&#39;d like to call all my tests through my\n&gt; business delegate, as the Entity Bean is largely code-generated by\n&gt; the container anyway, and the functionality I&#39;m really interested\n&gt; in testing is my invoking of the methods with value objects.\n&gt; \n&gt; However, since i have no guarantee of the order my tests are run in,\n&gt; I need to cleardown the persisted entities between each test; \n\nYou actually don&#39;t need to clear any data. You only need to set up the\nneeded data in the setUp() method, i.e. *before* the test. \n\n&gt; I&#39;ve\n&gt; written a DBTestCase in the past that performs a cleardown of tables\n&gt; in the setUp() method, and allows each test to insert rows, modify\n&gt; rows, delete rows, etc, and assert on entries existing in the\n&gt; database.\n&gt; \n\nyes. You can also use dbunit (http://dbunit.sf.net).\n\n&gt; What strategies have people successfully employed for testing\n&gt; business/workflow methods of a stateless session bean that has\n&gt; CMP entity beans at the back-end ?\n\nI have 2 strategies :\n\n1/ Do not unit test EJB as they are data holder that are not very\ninteresting to unit test. However, they need to be tested through\nfunctional testing or integration testing. To do that simply use a Mock\nObjects approach and provide mock EJB to your SLSB. See\nhttp://mockobjects.sf.net. Actually you would test your SLSFB as pure\njava objects by doing a new XXX() on them.\n\n2/ Test the whole way from your SLSB to the database. In that case, the\nsetup is more complex as you need a DB and to put the correct data in\nit. Your tests will also take longer to execute. It will not be a\nproblem at first but will become one when your test suite reaches\n400-500 tests that exercise the database (it will then take up to 15-20\nminutes to run). The advantage is that you&#39;re testing the whole path and\nthus you have better confidence that your code is working.\n\nFor 1/, you would have 2 types of tests that you run at different times\nin the development lifecycle. Unit tests that are run as frequently as\npossible, from your IDE of choice, whenever you make a change. And\nfunctional/integration tests that are at least once per day and that\nwill take longer to run. They are much more coarse-grained.\n\nWhat we do is that we have a continuous integration machine that runs\nour builds continuously (every 40 minutes - the time it takes to build\nour whole system) and that runs both the unit tests and the integration\nand functional ones. When one fails we get an email.\n\nThat way, you benefit from the best of both worlds ! \n\nHope it helps,\n-Vincent\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; \n&gt; Steven\n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
