I&#39;m growing a<br/>\n&gt;framework for testing JSPs by just calling them locally.  But, how do<br/>\n&gt;you get the JSP-compiled code to use the right (mock) class?  The only<br/>\n&gt;way I can see, is to completely avoid the &lt;usebean&gt; functionality, and<br/>\n&gt;roll your own equivalent code which is &quot;mock-aware&quot;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Why not just have your test code put the right mock object in the session <br/>\n(or request) objects? Usebean is no magic, is just does a getAttribute. I <br/>\nguess you are talking about beans that get instantiated (with parameters) by <br/>\nthe JSP itself, in which case a trick would be to have your mock have the <br/>\nsame classname (hello confusion!) and be put before the real objects in your <br/>\nclasspath during unit testing.<br/>\n<br/>\nmathieu<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>",
