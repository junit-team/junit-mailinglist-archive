Having all the parameter=\r\ns in an array could make me\nin some cases to forgot what that parameter is.=\r\n...they are not named after all..\nI don&#39;t know this is a real problem, it&#39;s=\r\n simpler the way it is...\nbut maybe if you have 5 o 6 parameters per testca=\r\nse,\nthen you could easily forgot which is which... (is this expression\nalri=\r\nght!??? :S)\nBut, i repeat, this may not be a problem of the parameter test.=\r\n..\nmaybe is the test that shouldn&#39;t need so many arguments...\n\nWell, that&#39;s=\r\n all...\nhope it helps...\n\nRegards,\nMariano Cortesi\n\nOn 9/16/05, David Saff =\r\n&lt;saff@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;     All,\n&gt;  \n&gt;  Kent and I thought and coded last n=\r\night about a mechanism for allowing \n&gt;  parameterized test cases in JUnit 4=\r\n.
