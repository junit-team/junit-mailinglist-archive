I can easily envision a case<br/>\nwhere someone either forgets to test their code or checks in the wrong code.<br/>\nIf a suite of tests was represented within a single test, you would get a<br/>\nsingle confusing error rather than a flurry of errors which might give you a<br/>\nbetter idea of what&#39;s going on. <br/>\n<br/>\n\tYes, it would be nice if we were all in an agile/extreme world where<br/>\neveryone was testing their code multiple times a day and builds were a daily<br/>\noccurrence, but some of us are in traditional with the &quot;fragile&quot; way of<br/>\ndoing things and are doing the best we can ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t-tim<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:james.dobson@...\">james.dobson@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:james.dobson@...\">james.dobson@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, August 21, 2002 10:26 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: [junit] A Growing Problem<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you run your test at regular intervals (e.g. hourly) then isolating<br/>\nfailures shouldn&#39;t be a problem.  Of course if your system is massive then a<br/>\nfull system test is out the question, but if you break your tests into<br/>\nsuites then you can run the suites on the section that you have being<br/>\nworking on.  Then run the rest of the tests overnight.<br/>\n<br/>\nJUnit does tell you which test failed, so isolating the test shouldn&#39;t be a<br/>\nproblem and if your test is only testing one method than it shouldn&#39;t be a<br/>\nproblem either, because your method is nice and simple right?  Unless you<br/>\nhave inherited some legacy stuff and have only started your unit testing in<br/>\nthe middle of your project.  Also why would the build take so long.  You<br/>\nonly have to re-build the class you altered don&#39;t you?<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Stevens, Timothy J. (LNG-MBC)<br/>\n[mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:timothy.j.stevens@...\">timothy.j.stevens@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: 21 August 2002 16:01<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: RE: [junit] A Growing Problem<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;And that JUnit fail after one test fails, so what?  You want all tests to<br/>\n&gt;pass so if one fails, find it, fix your code, and go again.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This can be a big problem in large systems that take minutes (or longer) to<br/>\ncompile and test. It&#39;s nice to get a complete list of failures so that you<br/>\ncan attempt to fix as many as possible before having to dive into the build<br/>\nprocess again...<br/>\n<br/>\n-tim<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!
