There is already a test. That test is breaking. Once you have\n&gt; a breaking test you don&#39;t change the API in any way until you&#39;ve fixed\n&gt; the breakage. This is a basic principle of test driven development. This\n&gt; has nothing to with making things public or not.\n\nJUnit can be used in many more contexts than test-driven development, \nbless its soul.\n\nThat said, when using test-driven development, I have often written a \ntest, and had it break in a way that indicates I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going \non somewhere else (a private method, maybe).  So, I now have two things \nI don&#39;t know, leading to two possibilities:\n\n1) Delete (or comment out) the first test, and write a test for the \nprivate method, so I can figure out what&#39;s going on there first.\n\n2) Introduce a seam to protect me for now from the private method.  \nFigure out how to run the higher-level method without running the \nprivate method, so that I can handle the higher-level method first.\n\nI used to believe in a third alternative: hack away with print \nstatements and a debugger until I get my head around both of these \nthings I don&#39;t know, and possibly more than seven others.  I no longer \nbelieve that&#39;s a good use of my time.\n\n    David Saff\n\n",
