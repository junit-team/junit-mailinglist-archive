I just want people to expose themselves to both. They may not be \n&gt; aware of the choice. That and jWebUnit.\n\nOne of the things I liked about JWebUnit was the ability to also test\nJavaScript (onload/onclick events).  That can give you a lot better\nfunctional coverage if you app uses Javascript.  I&#39;m pretty sure\nHTTPUnit doesn&#39;t offer this (JWebUnit is build on HTTPUnit, I believe).\n  Does HTMLUnit or any other free tool offer this?\n\n-- Chad\n\n\n\n\n",
