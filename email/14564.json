But perhaps this is &#39;BAD&#39; (tm)?<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; I value testing, so I generally do whatever it takes to<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; make code testable. Not everyone values testing as much<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; I do, especially compared to other considerations, so<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; they do other things.<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; --<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; J. B. (Joe) Rainsberger<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I value testing also. But I guess I&#39;m in the latter group that finds<br/>\n&gt; other considerations to be of greater importance. I&#39;m not happy with<br/>\n&gt; stating it that way. I think there is a fundamental interconnectedness<br/>\n&gt; (in more than a Dirk Gently sort of way) between design and a lack of<br/>\n&gt; testability. It seems good designs should be inherently testable. If<br/>\n&gt; one&#39;s design attitude is test-first then the two are holistic. Even<br/>\n&gt; symbiotic.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>JBR&#39;s postulate 1. For every testable design that requires exposing <br/>\nelements &quot;just for testing&quot;, there exists an equivalent testable design <br/>\nthat does not require exposing elements &quot;just for testing&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn other words, if I add a method &quot;just for testing&quot;, I can usually find <br/>\na way to restructure the design so that that method either earns its <br/>\nkeep or goes away. I don&#39;t have a specific example right now, because <br/>\nwhenever I see one, I don&#39;t have time to write about it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; What I&#39;m talking about here is green-field development. Legacy code,<br/>\n&gt; as always, trumps best intentions. Sometimes small changes can be made<br/>\n&gt; that both improve the design and testability. Sometimes changes one<br/>\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t ordinarily accept must be tolerated for the short term to<br/>\n&gt; improve testability to the point that more sweeping design changes can<br/>\n&gt; be made with confidence. But if this is consistently happening in new<br/>\n&gt; development then I suggest stepping back and reconsidering essential<br/>\n&gt; OO design principles.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The flip side is that I don&#39;t value access visibilility keywords. I <br/>\ndon&#39;t find them useful. If all data were private and all methods were <br/>\npublic, that would be fine, as is the case in Smalltalk and the default <br/>\nin Ruby. In Java, I use interface/implementation separation instead of <br/>\npublic/protected/private, because the former helps me for other reasons, <br/>\nanyway.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
