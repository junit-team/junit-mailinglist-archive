Sad, but fairly common in my opinion.\n\nIt wasn&#39;t clear to me, but that could just be my fault for not reading \ncarefully.\n\nIn that case, I would look specifically at the &quot;subclass to test&quot; \npattern in _Working Effectively with Legacy Code_. It doesn&#39;t help with \nprivate methods, but it does help with protected ones.\n\nFor private methods, invoke the method by reflection, changing the \naccessibility. There should be a recipe in _JUnit Recipes_ about it. The \ntitle is, if I remember, &quot;Test private methods if you must&quot;.\n\n&gt; I envy people who have write access to 100% of the code they need to test,\n&gt; they don&#39;t know how easy they have it :-)\n\nThis is an arrogant statement, but it&#39;s true. I apologize for that.\n\nI pity people who stay in a job where they don&#39;t have write access to \nthe code they need to test. They don&#39;t seem to realize how crazy that is.\n-- \nJ. B.
