If\nyou have a test suite where you can identify two disparate groups of\ntests that you would like to run separately, you obviously have two\nsuites in one file. \n\nI wrote a suite recently that tested a particular class containing both\nCRUD operations and single search operation. The search tests grew\nexponentially (as they tend to) and quickly outnumbered all the other\ntests combined! Eventually I had to concede that in that case it made\nsense for one suite to test everything but the search.... and another\nthat was just the search.\n\nGabriel.\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
