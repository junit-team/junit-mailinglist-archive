    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-644863509\">I tend to agree with Jason&#39;s comments and arguments below.  Well said.  I<br/>\nlike the perspective of Smalltalk where default and protected access<br/>\nmodifiers don&#39;t exist for rational reasons.  I would only add these<br/>\npractical considerations, oblique, not contrary, to Jason&#39;s words:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Code coverage analysis should be your guide in making decisions about<br/>\nwhether testing through public APIs provide thorough enough test coverage<br/>\n(80%? 95%?, depending on the quality you&#39;re shooting for and (relevant to<br/>\nthat) the industry you&#39;re in).  Naturally, coverage analysis will inform<br/>\nyour testing decisions, which in turn will likely inform your design<br/>\ndecisions.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. In the &quot;real world&quot; of non-ideal engineering situations, a QA team or<br/>\nengineer may well be tasked with, among other things, unit testing code or<br/>\nworking with a team of engineers who do not do unit testing and cannot be<br/>\nconvinced to do so.  In this case, the powerful benefit of the coding-unit<br/>\ntesting feedback loop is mostly lost and severely diluted, but the QA team<br/>\nmust do its best to test whatever craziness comes its way.  The values of<br/>\nunit testing are diminished, but by no means entirely, even if only the QA<br/>\nteam does it. Ditto for testing legacy systems over which one had no design<br/>\ncontrol for historical reasons.<br/>\n<br/>\nScott Stirling<br/>\nJRun QA<br/>\nMacromedia<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Jason Rogers [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jason.rogers@...\">jason.rogers@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Monday, June 11, 2001 5:18 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: [junit] Best Practice for Tests ?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks for the example in design issues... but that isn&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; what I was after.<br/>\n&gt; I should have been more clear, and I will be next time.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The real issue of this sub-thread is in where to locate tests <br/>\n&gt; and why.  The<br/>\n&gt; original quote (paraphrased) was that &quot;we put tests in the <br/>\n&gt; same package as<br/>\n&gt; production code to make it easier to test protected interfaces of our<br/>\n&gt; objects.&quot;  I don&#39;t see where this fits in to good design or <br/>\n&gt; good testing<br/>\n&gt; practices.  The virtue of public/protected/private/default is <br/>\n&gt; not what I was<br/>\n&gt; questioning.  I wanted to point out the potential flaws of design and<br/>\n&gt; testing that could otherwise be missed when you put tests in the same<br/>\n&gt; package as production code.  The production code should be <br/>\n&gt; tested in the<br/>\n&gt; same fashion it would be used by a client.  A test is a client in some<br/>\n&gt; degree.  In most cases clients exist outside of the package.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Someone (sorry, I forget who it was) brought up the fact that <br/>\n&gt; &quot;client&quot; is a<br/>\n&gt; loose term that can refer to objects outside my package <br/>\n&gt; domain as well as to<br/>\n&gt; objects within my package domain.  I do not disagree with <br/>\n&gt; that assertion.<br/>\n&gt; However, I believe that (in most cases) the public interface <br/>\n&gt; of any part of<br/>\n&gt; a system should be designed in such a way that when it is tested the<br/>\n&gt; programmer can be assured that he/she hasn&#39;t broken anything.  The<br/>\n&gt; package-scope clients usually have a public interface of <br/>\n&gt; their own which can<br/>\n&gt; then be tested separately from the classes they interact <br/>\n&gt; with.  Often times<br/>\n&gt; in a situation where objects use the protected &quot;inners&quot; <br/>\n&gt; (either variables or<br/>\n&gt; methods) of another object within their package there is some kind of<br/>\n&gt; heirarchical relationship where one object is a supporter of <br/>\n&gt; another.  Thus,<br/>\n&gt; I conclude, that testing the public interfaces of ALL objects <br/>\n&gt; (the key being<br/>\n&gt; ALL) should prove sufficient, thus not needing the tests to <br/>\n&gt; reside in the<br/>\n&gt; same package as their associated production code objects.  Of <br/>\n&gt; course, there<br/>\n&gt; are exceptions... we have ways around those.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -Jason<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Yishay Mor [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ymor@...\">ymor@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Monday, June 11, 2001 5:57 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: [junit] Best Practice for Tests ?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I could, but that would cost you more then 2c  #:-)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; consider, as an example, the following pattern:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; abstract class A {<br/>\n&gt;         public void doSomeThingComplex() {<br/>\n&gt;                 // do some stuff<br/>\n&gt;                 :<br/>\n&gt;                 // call extender&#39;s code<br/>\n&gt;                 doSomeThingSimple();<br/>\n&gt;                 // do some more stuff<br/>\n&gt;                 :<br/>\n&gt;         }<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;         protected abstract void doSomeThingSimple();<br/>\n&gt; }<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; public class B extends A {<br/>\n&gt;         protected void doSomeThingSimple(){<br/>\n&gt;                 // do it<br/>\n&gt;         }<br/>\n&gt; }<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; - but this is turning into a thread on Java design issues, <br/>\n&gt; maybe we should<br/>\n&gt; take it elsewhere.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Yishay<br/>\n&gt;                         <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; At 04:07 PM 6/11/2001 -0400, you wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks for the quote.
