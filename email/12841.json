If there are no effects, then<br/>\nwhy do you have the method? To use your example: what is the secondary<br/>\neffect of setting the private fields? The primary effect will be that<br/>\nthe private fields get new values. That these values are not available<br/>\nwith getters is not necessarily a problem. If the new values in the<br/>\nfields have secondary effects, then measure those. Ask yourself why<br/>\nyou are setting these private fields and then test the thing that they<br/>\ndo affect.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet&#39;s make up a contrived example. Perhaps in a sales system, you can<br/>\ngenerate quotes with different customer discounts. Let&#39;s pretend that<br/>\nthe discount is our &quot;set only&quot; field. So we can set it&#39;s value but not<br/>\ninspect it. Fine. The reason that we have the field is to calculate<br/>\ndiscounts on quotes. So, to test it, set a sale price of $100, set the<br/>\ndiscount at 10% and check that the quote gives you an answer of $90.<br/>\nThe affect on the quoted price is the secondary effect. If there is no<br/>\nsecondary effect of the method, then I strongly suggest that it needs<br/>\nvery close examination. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; 2) Methods that work on network traffic, ex counting all TCP packets<br/>\n&gt; that I receive. I would need an isolated environment and would need to<br/>\n&gt; be able to send X amount of packets to my machine.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks in advance<br/>\n&gt; Pico<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps.<br/>\n<br/>\nSimon<br/>\n(the Lands&#39; End guy who recently switched to GMail :-) </span></blockquote></div>",
