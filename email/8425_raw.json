I could reference my ejb&#39;s methods because they were abstract. So, I constructed a Delegate that was created from the ejb. I then created a JUnit test off of my Delegate. The JUnit test referenced my delegate and my delegate reference the ejb. \n \nThis sort of scenario may serve your purpose.\n \nMichael Orozco\n\nJonathan Oddy &lt;j.oddy@...&gt; wrote:\nDear All,\n\nI am writing a struts-based web application (not really relevent for this\ndiscussion however...).  I have a number of implementations of Action (used\nto service incoming Http requests).  My action classes collaborate with a\nnumber of other classes (data access, business and so forth) and I would\nlike to unit test my Action classes.  However they really only have one\npublic method of interest - the Action.execute, and this is I believe,\ncurrently, far to complex for sensible unit testing, what I really want is\nto test some of the collaborations (parts of the whole).  \n\nObviously I can (and have) refactored Action.execute and this has resulted\nin a number of protected and private methods.  But unit testing seems be\naimed at public interface testing, which my newly refactored methods do not\ncome under this description.  I am not keen to promote these methods to\npublic visibility because they are not part of the behavioural interface.\nMy current thought (but I am not happy with this) is to do the following:\nsubclass my target testing class and provide a number of public methods that\nsimply forward to the appropriate underlying protected method(s) and\nrecording their results (to be tested by Junit asserts).  This works but\nleaves me with the overhead of having to &quot;maintain&quot; my target subclass along\nwith the rest of my application.  Things are compounded somewhat by the fact\nthat I am also having to mock a fair number of objects in order to make my\naction class as independent as possible.\n\nHas anyone else come across a similar problem and if so how did you solve\nit?  I am still a relative newbie to unit testing (and very much a newbie)\nto testing complex interactions so any help/thoughts greatly appreciated.\n\nTIA\n\nJonathan\n\n\n\n\nYahoo!
