Perhaps I need to test more legacy code. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  &gt; In other words, do we EVER really need &#39;tearDown&#39;?  I do see the need for<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; setUp, especially if you need to construct (horror) interlinked mock<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; objects.  But why bother &#39;nulling&#39; out your locals? They&#39;ll be GC&#39;ed<br/>\n&gt; anyway,<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; right?<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt; tearDown is analagous to finalize. You probably only need to use it to<br/>\n&gt; release some non memory resource e.g. close a connection, rollback a<br/>\n&gt; transaction., delete some temporary files<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes. The only difference is that someone actually /invokes/ <br/>\ntearDown()... and you know /when/ it&#39;ll happen, especially if you use <br/>\nthe JUnit-addons test runner. :)<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
