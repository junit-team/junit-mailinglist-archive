    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1817041154\">Greetings Felix,<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d have to agree with Cédric. A C++ developer pair here reported that  <br/>\ntheir first unit test took them about 10 hours to write. The second  <br/>\none took them two hours. The third test, maybe 15 minutes. (These were  <br/>\nafter-the-fact unit tests against legacy code, so I don&#39;t have the  <br/>\ndevelopment times to compare against.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIn order to get this effectiveness, as Cédric suggests, you have to be  <br/>\nwilling to refactor the tests so as to eliminate duplication between  <br/>\nthem and keep them clear. Most of my unit tests are very short and  <br/>\nvery readable, which helps keep comprehension times down.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve also found that writing tests first generally keeps me out of the  <br/>\nproblem of writing code that&#39;s hard to test. Until you start writing  <br/>\nlots of tests, and realizing what&#39;s hard to test, test-after tends to  <br/>\nproduce a design with unfortunate dependencies (that you have to break  <br/>\nin order to write effective tests).<br/>\n<br/>\nJeff<br/>\n<br/>\nQuoting Cédric Beust ? &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cbeust@...\">cbeust@...</a>&gt;:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; In my experience, this is a bit hard to quantify, but it&#92;&#39;s probably fair to<br/>\n&gt; say that while the cost appears a bit on the high side initially (especially<br/>\n&gt; if the developers on your team are not used to writing tests and that there<br/>\n&gt; is no existing testing infrastructure), it tends to decrease over time as<br/>\n&gt; programmers become more experienced in writing tests, reuse or create test<br/>\n&gt; base classes and tend to write solid tests in their first iteration.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Although it&#92;&#39;s obviously hard to prove or disprove, I would probably say that<br/>\n&gt; at the very beginning, it&#92;&#39;s not rare to spend as much time writing a test as<br/>\n&gt; it is to implement the corresponding feature. That first test is always<br/>\n&gt; very expensive, especially if it&#92;&#39;s an area of your product that has no tests<br/>\n&gt; at all. It all gets better after that.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hope it helps, and looking forward to other people&#92;&#39;s answers.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; Cédric<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://testng.org\">http://testng.org</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On 2/16/07, felix3142 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:f.noz@...\">f.noz@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;&gt; we&#92;&#39;re going to establish unit-testing (basically for web applications)<br/>\n&gt;&gt; in our company. Because we don&#92;&#39;t want to change the whole programming<br/>\n&gt;&gt; paradigm to XP we rather want to use a test-last method in the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; beginning and then watch out for further steps.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; I&#92;&#39;m now in the process of investigating the basic requirements and<br/>\n&gt;&gt; conditions.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; One question that occured is if it&#92;&#39;s possible to quantify the amount<br/>\n&gt;&gt; of extra time you need when using unit testing compared to the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; non-testing approach. I solely refer to the writing of unit tests.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Later saving of time (by better code) shouldn&#92;&#39;t be considered. So<br/>\n&gt;&gt; what&#92;&#39;s your experience? Can anybody do a statement about time<br/>\n&gt;&gt; consumption of writing unit tests?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Powered by Horde</div>",
