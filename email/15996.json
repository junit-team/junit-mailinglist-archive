So, whether<br/>\n&gt; the cost of this metaphor is worth it depends on the benefit each user<br/>\n&gt; gets, and how many uses that cost is to be amortized across.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m still figuring this out, and I&#39;m interested in your ideas.  Thanks,<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Although I can relate to all the things you wrote, I&#39;m stuck with one <br/>\nlogical quandary.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf Pluggable Selector is OK for JUnit, then why isn&#39;t it OK for the code <br/>\nI was writing, which happened to choose rule methods the same way JUnit <br/>\nchooses test methods?<br/>\n<br/>\nYou wonder whether it matters how heavily reused the code is. So, if <br/>\nthis is code only my team will use, then it&#39;s not OK; but if it&#39;s code I <br/>\nplan to put into a general-purpose, widely-used rule engine[1], then <br/>\nit&#39;s OK. I don&#39;t buy that at all. Ignoring the effort to write the code <br/>\nthis way, its value might increase the more it&#39;s used, but that doesn&#39;t <br/>\nmean it has negative value when it&#39;s not widely used. It would seem that <br/>\nthe more people who try to use a clever design, the more that clever <br/>\ndesign costs, if you include the cost of supporting the people trying to <br/>\nuse it. As a result, I&#39;d argue the opposite: the fewer people who use <br/>\nit, the more we can afford to be clever.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my case, JUnit /was/ the metaphor: rule methods are collected <br/>\nautomatically like test methods, and if any rule fails, the whole <br/>\nruleset fails. To anyone with any JUnit experience, I think that works <br/>\nwell. This is why I was surprised to see many JUnit users balk at it. So <br/>\nthere must be something else to it, and frankly, I can&#39;t see what it is <br/>\nbeyond those people deciding arbitrarily. That&#39;s fine, but I don&#39;t want <br/>\npeople to dress it up as more than that when that&#39;s what it is.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
