I try to write a code generator for JUnit testcases and plan to use JavaCC to parse the java files.  I have successfully generated the parser for the Java language.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy question is: how can I traverse the JJTree?  I haven&#39;t found yet a real great example to use the Visitor interface and don&#39;t want to spend too much time on searching.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you have had experiences with JavaCC and the Visitor interface?  If so, I would be extremely glad to hear from you.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Vladimir</div>",
