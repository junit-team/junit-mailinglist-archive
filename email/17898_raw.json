JUnit generates his own reports for=\r\n failed tests? How can \nI catch them? Or what do you mean with reports for =\r\naggregate \ninformation? Are that reports different from the logging I gener=\r\nate \nwith eg log4j?\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, didoss@... wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Th=\r\nat sounds like two different things:\n&gt; \n&gt; The logging, whether through log4=\r\nj (which I also like) or something \nelse, will provide debugging informatio=\r\nn to you.\n&gt; \n&gt; The reports are useful for aggregate information (like how m=\r\nany \nfailures and errors for X number of tests for the whole product \nsuite=\r\n, or whatever scope you run) and information about tests passed \nand failed=\r\n (errors and failures).\n&gt; \n&gt; For the tests that failed, you might use the i=\r\nnformation from the \nreport (which will give you information around the iss=\r\nue - stack \ntrace or failure information) or information from the log files=\r\n \n(information for the entire run - you might be able to see the \nprogressi=\r\non of state that led to the failure/error) to troubleshoot \nand fix.\n&gt; \n&gt; I=\r\n generally take the reports, or the result of an individual run, \nas my sta=\r\nrting point, and then only look at the logging for the ones \nthat failed in=\r\n some way.  If I have written my asserts well, I \nusually don&#39;t even need t=\r\no look at the logging, because I will know \nexactly what went wrong.\n&gt; \n&gt; H=\r\nope this helps and good luck on the migration.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Dianne\n&gt; \n&gt; --------=\r\n------ Original message -------------- \n&gt; From: &quot;isowitz&quot; &lt;isowitz@...&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nI have to rewrite existing tests in JUnit tests. The old tests logs \n&gt; with=\r\n a java.util.logging.Logger, e.g. starttime, start sendind \ndata, \n&gt; start =\r\nrecieving data, the recieved data etc. - in a word they logs \n&gt; all that ca=\r\nn be logged. \n&gt; Should I use the java.util.logging.Logger for JUnit too or =\r\nis that \n&gt; the bad way?\n&gt; \n&gt; You spoke about reports of my result. What oth=\r\ner kind of reports \n&gt; exists?\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In junit@yahoogroups.com, didoss@ wr=\r\note:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; What do you mean by logging,...do you mean reports of your \nre=\r\nsults -\n&gt; then Google JUnitReport.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; -------------- Original message=\r\n -------------- \n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;isowitz&quot; &lt;isowitz@&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I have a problem with =\r\nlogging JUnit tests. In a package I have a \n&gt; &gt; AllTests class that calls s=\r\neveral tests. The result of that tests \n&gt; &gt; should be logged.\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m not f=\r\namiliar with JUnit or logging so I try to find examples \nin \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; web=\r\n. Unfortunately i found no examples or hints for me.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; How do you lo=\r\ng your JUnit results? \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this m=\r\nessage have been removed]\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this mes=\r\nsage have been removed]\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
