Or am I seeing something wrong? Or is<br/>\n&gt; it impossible to JUnit-test file creation?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Christian,<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve worked on two different projects that created PDF files. We had<br/>\nunit tests for both projects, and found little difficulty doing this.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe did have a couple tests that caused pdf files to be created on the<br/>\ndisk, but these were more like acceptance tests or integration tests.<br/>\n (In these projects, we did not strongly distinguish between<br/>\nunit/integration/system/acceptance tests.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBUT, each time we added a capability to the PDF generator, we tested<br/>\nthat capability.  Usually, that meant creating the pdf snippet either<br/>\nas a String, or by writing the snippet to a Writer/OutputStream.<br/>\nSomething like &quot;Does the pie chart generator produce the proper pdf<br/>\nfor this case? For that case?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nhth,<br/>\nEric</div>",
