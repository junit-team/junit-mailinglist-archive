It certainly makes sense to included it \nin the core, though.  Of course, then junit depends on gnu-regexp or \nsome other regexp package.\n\nAs for examining the contents of arrays, I wrote a special &quot;equals&quot; that \naccepts arrays (I wanted to verify that the contents of a menu matched \nmy array of strings, or a string-encoded array).\n\nT.\n\nOn Friday, April 5, 2002, at 09:10 AM, Tauzell, Dave wrote:\n\n&gt; Or better yet,\n&gt;\n&gt; assertMatchesRegex( &quot;/&#92;d&#92;d-&#92;d&#92;d-&#92;d&#92;d&#92;d&#92;d&quot;, &quot;4-30-2002&quot; );\n&gt;\n&gt; -Dave\n&gt;\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: tek1 [mailto:tek1@...]\n&gt; Sent: Friday, April 05, 2002 2:48 AM\n&gt; To: JUnit Mailing List\n&gt; Subject: [junit] assertContains? -&gt; junit development question?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; hello.\n&gt;\n&gt; i&#39;ve recently read hightower and lesiecki&#39;s book on using ant, junit,\n&gt; etc.\n&gt; and have started using junit for my projects.  i have noticed that\n&gt; checking\n&gt; to see if a string, arrays, and other collections objects contain a\n&gt; certain\n&gt; value is often performed.\n&gt;\n&gt; has there been consideration in the past to add a type of\n&gt; &quot;assertContains()&quot; methods to the Assert class?\n&gt;\n&gt; it would create easier-to-read and maintain tests than having to\n&gt; currently\n&gt; do containment checks by writing\n&gt;\n&gt; if(str.indexOf(keywordStr) &lt; 0) {\n&gt; \tfail(&quot;failed.&quot;);\n&gt; }\n&gt;\n&gt; or similar checks, and for loops.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; the methods could be something like:\n&gt;\n&gt; assertContains(String containerString, String searchString)\n&gt; assertContains(String[] containerArray, String searchString)\n&gt; assertContains(Object[] objectArray, Object searchObject, Class\n&gt; objClass)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; sample usage of the 1st one would be:\n&gt;\n&gt; containerString = &quot;i love junit and think that everyone should use it.&quot;;\n&gt; searchString = &quot;junit&quot;;\n&gt;\n&gt; assertContains(containerString, searchString);  ==&gt;  test passes\n&gt; assertContains(containerString, &quot;weDontNeedTesting&quot;);  ==&gt;  test fails\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; thanks and my apologies if this has already been discussed before (i\n&gt; checked the faq and mailing list for &quot;assert contain&quot; but didn&#39;t find\n&gt; anything...).\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
