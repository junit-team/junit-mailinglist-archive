We might run B anyway =\r\nbut could \n&gt; &gt; highlight the error in A in some way. That approach doesn&#39;t =\r\nrequire \n&gt; &gt; ordering the tests in any particular way, which has some advan=\r\ntages.\n&gt; &gt; It still promotes developer efficiency while not worrying about =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; execution efficiency.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes, we call these &quot;soft dependencies&quot;.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; If &quot;b&quot; has a hard dependency on &quot;a&quot; and &quot;a&quot; fails, &quot;a&quot; will \n&gt; be mar=\r\nked &quot;FAILED&quot; and b &quot;SKIPPED&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; If &quot;b&quot; has a soft dependency on &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;=\r\n will still run even \n&gt; if &quot;a&quot; fails but a warning could be displayed in th=\r\ne log.\n\nThis is an implementation-based view of the tests: i.e. they\nwill e=\r\nither be run or not run.\n\nThe distinction I was trying to make - and I thin=\r\nk David as\nwell - is based on the cause and nature of the dependency.\nFor t=\r\nhe sake of argument, I&#39;ll try to redefine what you&#39;re\ncalling Hard and Soft=\r\n along those lines.\n\nHard: Test A does something (sets state) upon which B =\r\ndepends. \nFor example, A may write to a data store and B might try to \nread=\r\n the information back. Or A might create a complex object\nand B might try t=\r\no call a method on that object. If we allow \nthis sort of thing, then there=\r\n is no choice but to run A first\nand it makes sense to not run B at all if =\r\nA fails. However,\nI would not want a unit test framework to allow it.\n\nSoft=\r\n: Test A tests some functionality upon which some other\nfunctionality, test=\r\ned by B, depends. Therefore, if test A \nfails, Test B will either fail as w=\r\nell or be inconclusive, \nso nothing further can be learned from test B. In =\r\nthis case,\na testing framework could respond in a number of ways to\nthe dep=\r\nendency:\n1) Run the tests in order, skipping B if A fails.\n2) Run the tests=\r\n in an arbitrary order, but skip B if A \nalready ran and failed.\n3) Run the=\r\n tests in an arbitrary order, not skipping any\nof them but organize reporti=\r\nng in such a way that a failure\nof A takes precedence over a failure of B.\n=\r\n\nAs a framework author, I can see that allowing the user to\nspecify orderin=\r\ng is a simpler implementation. But I think\nit&#39;s more interesting to imagine=\r\n the user specifying the\nnature of the dependencies and allowing the framew=\r\nork to\nfigure out a strategy.\n\nCharlie\n\n&gt; Every time we have discussed this=\r\n potential feature for \n&gt; TestNG, the discussion ended up being non conclus=\r\nive on the \n&gt; real interest and the existing ability to mark certain \n&gt; met=\r\nhods as &quot;alwaysRun&quot; already fills a big part of this \n&gt; scenario, so I alwa=\r\nys ended up punting on it, but I&#39;d be \n&gt; happy to hear if someone can come =\r\nup with a good use case for \n&gt; soft dependencies...\n&gt; \n&gt; --\n&gt; ***C=E9dric\n&gt;=\r\n *\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
