I have tried searching in Google as well as\n&gt; previous messages in this group, but I haven&#39;t really seen something\n&gt; that I can understand at my stage [also, my dearching skills may not\n&gt; be that good!]\n&gt; \n&gt; If you can simply point me so some good posts in this group or some\n&gt; links on Google, I will take it from there.\n\n  * keywords &quot;Dallaway unit test database&quot;\n  * dbunit.sourceforge.net can help you set up database fixtures and \ncheck the expected results against the actual results.\n  * Chapter 10 of _JUnit Recipes_, of course.\n\n&gt; Some background: We use JDBC code within our Java applications and\n&gt; we have separated as much database code as possible. There still\n&gt; remain some classes which need to have JDBC code for performance\n&gt; reasons. We connect to a database on a separate server and do not\n&gt; intend to use an in-memory database.\n\nWhy not use an in-memory database for testing?\n-- \nJ. B.
