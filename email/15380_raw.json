What I mean is this. I tried using\n&gt; &gt; the batch=\r\ntest task which is severely limited. It only does a directory\n&gt; &gt; scan over=\r\n my test source to pick up the test classes. The problem is\n&gt; &gt; sometimes I=\r\n may include abstract classes under that umbrella for\n&gt; &gt; conveniece method=\r\ns and they get picked up too. Also there is no\n&gt; &gt; garauntee that the sourc=\r\ne and class files will be one for one. (Eg.\n&gt; &gt; nested classes would go unn=\r\noticed as well as source files that\n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t/can&#39;t compile to a equivalent=\r\n named class.) I would feel alot\n&gt; &gt; better if I could filter the .class fi=\r\nles instead of the source and\n&gt; &gt; pull out only the classes that are TESTAB=\r\nLE. That is, classes that\n&gt; &gt; begin or end with &quot;Test&quot; and have at least on=\r\ne public no-arg method\n&gt; &gt; beginning with &quot;test&quot;.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; So I plugged in D=\r\nirectorySuiteBuilder from the junit addons project\n&gt; &gt; and added some custo=\r\nm code to accomplish this. My custom code, a class\n&gt; &gt; named DirectoryScann=\r\nerSuiteBuilder, is included below. The problem\n&gt; &gt; with that approach, whil=\r\ne it is a lot more accurate, is that the\n&gt; &gt; junitreport task now lumps all=\r\n tests under my custom\n&gt; &gt; DirectoryScannerSuiteBuilder class name without =\r\nseparating out the\n&gt; &gt; detail. So my question is what would the best approa=\r\nch be? Should I\n&gt; &gt; stop being anal and just go with the batchtest approach=\r\n and stop\n&gt; &gt; including abstracts under the test source directory? (Inceden=\r\ntally\n&gt; &gt; that&#39;s what I&#39;m resoting to now.) Or is there a more elaborate\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; solution sort of like a best of breed between the two approaches I&#39;ve\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n tried so far?\n&gt; \n&gt;  &lt;CLIP&gt;a bunch of code&lt;/CLIP&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;  -------------------=\r\n-----------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been remove=\r\nd]\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
