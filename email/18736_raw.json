This may still be a large set, but it is the same\n&gt; problem faced by humans who develop a test set: &quot;When do you have enough\n&gt; tests?&quot; (Ooops, time for one more compsci buzzword: halting problem).\n&gt; So, on the question of what is 100%, it depends on scope to a degree.\n&gt; When do you stop testing your code, and begin testing the compiler, the\n&gt; runtime machine, the library, etc.?\n&gt; \n&gt; Perhaps a more reasonable goal would be an automated test generator that\n&gt; would produce a test set that met or exceeded the tests produced by a\n&gt; reasonably good human. Essentially a &#39;best parctices&#39; goal.\n\nI think I&#39;d be happy with something that produced any tests of real \nvalue, rather than routine ones I wouldn&#39;t write anyway. I just haven&#39;t \nseen a tool capable of that so far, and these days, my attention is \nfocused elsewhere, so I&#39;m no longer looking for them.\n-- \nJ. B.
