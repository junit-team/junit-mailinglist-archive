The reason is<br/>\n&gt; that JUnit tests have always been isolated an we have come to expect<br/>\n&gt; that to be the case. It is quite convenient not to have to worry about<br/>\n&gt; restoring state between testruns so that testB can never fail because<br/>\n&gt; testA failed to clean after iteself<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>But if this were the case, @After would be pointless, wouldn&#39;t it?<br/>\n<br/>\nHow many of your tests would suddenly break if instances were shared?<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my experience, tests and developers already spend a great deal of<br/>\ntime cleaning up after themselves, which makes me wonder (as you<br/>\nalready know) if creating a new instance before each method is worth<br/>\nthe pain it causes...<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nCédric</div>",
