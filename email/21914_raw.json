What I meant was that if I have an @Before method in the supe=\r\nr class, and then override it in the sub class (these are old JUnit 3.8 tes=\r\nts converted to 4.x, so these are old setUp methods). I was under the (appa=\r\nrently mistaken - read on) impression that if you overrode the method, you =\r\nhad to re-annotate it with an @Before.\n\nWell, I went to put together the te=\r\nst, and it passed. Hmm, I&#39;m pretty sure I had a problem that was caused by =\r\nthe fact that Java doesn&#39;t inherit annotations on methods with regards to t=\r\nhe @Before and @After.\n\nI&#39;m too lazy to get back JUnit 4.5 (where I had the=\r\n problem), so I&#39;m not sure if I was mistaken (and spent a bunch of time ann=\r\notating methods with @Before and @After in subclasses for no reason) or if =\r\nsomething was fixed, but anyway, it&#39;s working now.\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroup=\r\ns.com, &quot;kentb&quot; &lt;kentb@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m a bit confused. @Before and @Afte=\r\nr are inherited. Superclass @Before&#39;s\n&gt; are executed before subclass @Befor=\r\ne&#39;s and subclass @After&#39;s are executed\n&gt; before superclass @After&#39;s. If you=\r\n have a scenario where inheritance doesn&#39;t\n&gt; work as you expected, I&#39;d appr=\r\neciate a failing test case that will pass when\n&gt; JUnit does what you expect=\r\n.\n&gt;  \n&gt; In any case, I&#39;m glad you got your tests running as expected. As yo=\r\nu noted,\n&gt; @Rule&#39;s aren&#39;t executed in any particular order. This is by desi=\r\ngn. If you\n&gt; need to express temporal dependency, the best way I know of is=\r\n to have\n&gt; sequential lines of code.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt;  \n&gt; Kent\n&gt; \n&gt;   _____=\r\n  \n&gt; \n&gt; From: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On Behal=\r\nf Of\n&gt; yme0987654321\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, August 25, 2009 8:19 PM\n&gt; To: junit@y=\r\nahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: [junit] Re: Rule annotation\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   \n&gt; \n&gt; It do=\r\nesn&#39;t fit my scenario because I would essentially not want to engage\n&gt; the =\r\nexternal resources, so I guess I could combine them the other way around\n&gt; =\r\nand fail with an assumeThat (would that work? Or would it report a crash?).=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; But anyway, after playing with this for a while, I just did an assume=\r\nThat in\n&gt; the @BeforeClass method, and that worked out fine. IDEA doesn&#39;t r=\r\neport the\n&gt; ignored tests as nicely, but that&#39;s life. I got to eliminate a =\r\nlot of\n&gt; brittle complicated code around the runner, so it was worthwhile.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; I used the @Rule for the external resource, which really saved the @Be=\r\nfore\n&gt; and @After inheritence issue (the fact that it doesn&#39;t inherit), so\n=\r\n&gt; ultimately 4.7 really improved my testing code infrastructure.\n&gt; \n&gt; So go=\r\nod job.\n&gt; \n&gt; The thing that got my brain tied in knots is the expectation t=\r\nhat rules\n&gt; interact, or have some kind of series to them. But that is just=\r\n an\n&gt; association with the word &quot;rule&quot; and has nothing to do with how JUnit=\r\n is\n&gt; doing the @Rule annotation, which is fine once you get it.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- I=\r\nn junit@yahoogroups. &lt;mailto:junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt; com, David Saff\n&gt; &lt;da=\r\nvid@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m trying to think this one through.

So I guess the conclusion is that @Rule can&#39;t interrupt or\n&gt; override t=\r\nhe setup and teardown process, so if you need to do that you are\n&gt; back to =\r\na Runner?
