Rainsberger&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jbr@...\">jbr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Oh, I know. I&#39;ve worked for them. I&#39;m in the XPAdoption group, trying<br/>\n&gt; to figure out how to change all that. I&#39;m convinced that the only thing<br/>\n&gt; to do is to start my own shop, but I don&#39;t have the business and<br/>\n&gt; marketing knowledge to run it, nor do I have the funds to pay someone<br/>\n&gt; else to run it on day one.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, like I said, I have seen the use of unit testing be a &quot;foot in the<br/>\ndoor&quot; - or part of one anyway; I worked for a company that went from doing<br/>\nalmost no testing, to adopting many XP practices and having developers write<br/>\nunittests for their own code before checking it in. Some even did TDD. Part<br/>\nof the foot in the door was that the project was a whole new practice that<br/>\nthe project manager convinced management to let him use some XP practices,<br/>\nmixed in with things like JAD and so on. It worked out fairly well for a<br/>\nfirst attempt. Everyone involved agreed that unit testing and XP practices<br/>\nwere a significant factor in the quality of the end result - which was a<br/>\nvery high quality product. QA was especially pleased that they had so much<br/>\ninput from the beginning and that most of the bugs they found were not of<br/>\nthe kind that should have been found earlier.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have always been a believer in early testing, but that project gave me the<br/>\nexperience in a situation where the abandoning the old bad practices and<br/>\nadopting the new good practices resulted in a difference like night and day.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; No argument there. My concern is that everyone wants to test, but not<br/>\n&gt; everyone has the same goals. In this case, I think it&#39;s important to<br/>\n&gt; identify each person&#39;s (role&#39;s?) goals, then partition the work in a<br/>\n&gt; way that there is sufficient overlap for crosschecking, but not so much<br/>\n&gt; that we&#39;re all doing Solo Testing, but duplicating effort.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my experience most people don&#39;t want to test. Hell I got burnt out on it<br/>\nafter 7 years of doing nothing but QA and testing. Even people who write<br/>\nunit code tests would rather develop production code than write test code (I<br/>\nam happy doing either, but happier writing production code). In the project<br/>\nI was involved in there wasn&#39;t a wall between the dedicated tester and the<br/>\nproduction developer; we usually paired a tester with 1-2 developers, the<br/>\ndevelopers serving as mentors of a sort with regards to teaching these<br/>\npeople how to code. Many of them were people we brought in with the idea<br/>\nthat eventually they would be writing production code themselves, and many<br/>\nof them eventually did - but by then they knew the value of unit testing and<br/>\ndefensive programming, and were more amenable to concepts such as TDD.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, there was no real duplication of effort; unit testers more or less<br/>\npicked up where developers had left off and added to or extended their unit<br/>\ntesting efforts. The unit testers also learned the codebase, and hopefully<br/>\nlearned food coding practices by being under the wing of more experienced<br/>\ndevelopers.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I might approach the situation by explaining that the tests in TDD are<br/>\n&gt; not meant to test, but rather the guide the design. In that light,<br/>\n&gt; surely outside testing looks like a good idea.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know that I would call it &quot;outside&quot; testing. We had a very<br/>\nintegrated team; in that project you were not a member of QA, a member of<br/>\ndevelopment, or a member of marketing - you were a member of the team with a<br/>\ncertain expertise that the project needed. We had unit testers and we had<br/>\nintegration system testers, and everybody was one big happy family. ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; This is where my ignorance shines. I don&#39;t know how to convince anyone<br/>\n&gt; of anything, so I&#39;m content to let others try to do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have found that leading by example with gentle persuasion generally works<br/>\nwell. Sometimes I have had to leave companies because few people there &quot;got<br/>\nit&quot;, and it was a lost cause until someone in power came in and turned<br/>\nthings around or upside down. It can take years for good practices to be<br/>\nadopted and it takes patience. As long as there is progress and a<br/>\ncommittment to improvement, then I can feel that I am accomplishing<br/>\nsomething.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Well, of course TDD won&#39;t find all the bugs. TDD isn&#39;t about finding<br/>\n&gt; bugs.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen we are in agreement. Early testing, properly managed can accomplish a<br/>\nhigher quality product - and so I think there is room for a unit testing<br/>\neffort that works in cooperation with TDD. I have seen it work and the<br/>\nresults were much better than waiting for testing to get involved later.<br/>\n<br/>\nFWIW,<br/>\nLauren<br/>\n<br/>\n=====<br/>\nLooking for an experienced Java/C++ Software Engineer?<br/>\nSee: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://developerdude.mystarband.net/resume.html\">http://developerdude.mystarband.net/resume.html</a> </span></blockquote></div>",
