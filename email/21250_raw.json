At\nthat time I suggested some search engine terms that could bring you\ninformation. Did you try those? I seem to recall quite a few good\nJUnit tutorials available on the web and I&#39;d be very surprised if\nthere weren&#39;t good tutorials forHtmlUnit also. As you were very\ninterested in HtmlUnit, did you try asking questions on their mailing\nlist? Have you tried the JUnit FAQ?\n\nhttp://junit.sourceforge.net/doc/faq/faq.htm\n\nIf you have an error that you don&#39;t understand, have you tried\nreducing the code down to the simplest possible state and seeing if\nthat works?\n\nI suggest that you read Eric Raymond&#39;s guide to asking questions as\nyou have provided no actual information to help us help you. Trying to\nsend attached JAR files of JUnit and HtmlUnit won&#39;t help as we most\nlikely all already have those and the mailing list server will reject\nthem.\n\nhttp://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html\n\nWhat versions are you trying to use? What version of Java do you have\ninstalled? What operating system are you using? We now know that you\nare using Eclipse, but which version? Is the error in your test or is\nthe error in your code that you are testing, or both? Consider posting\na fragment of code that is giving you problems and you&#39;ll stand a much\nbetter chance of receiving help.\n\nSimon\n(One of the JUnit mailing list moderators)\n\n-- \nsimonpeter.org | simonpeter.com | newlife-upc.org | wisconsindistrictnews.org\n\n",
