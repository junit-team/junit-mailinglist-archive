    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-420734626\">Interesting point. One that we have been kicking around here in the <br/>\noffice this week as well. We have been using the term &quot;syntactically <br/>\ncorrect&quot; to indicate a document that would pass some kind of XML <br/>\nvalidation. However this does not mean the document makes sense in a <br/>\nbrowser - perhaps there are CSS mistakes or JavaScript mistakes, or <br/>\nbasic HTML mistakes. If a document does make sense in a browser, we have <br/>\nbeen calling it &quot;semantically correct&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese are probably not the best use of the terms &quot;syntax&quot; and <br/>\n&quot;semantics&quot; but it seems to convey the intended difference.<br/>\n<br/>\nAutomating the process of testing if a page is syntactically correct <br/>\nseems to be reasonably easy through the use of an XML parser.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe semantic checking is a much more interesting problem. Validating <br/>\nCSS, or JavaScript is probably doable. But in my experience the biggest <br/>\nproblem in testing a web application is the variety of browsers and OSs <br/>\nthat are out there and attempting to cover even a small set of these in <br/>\nQA is resource intensive. Small differences in rendering that need to be <br/>\ntweaked with custom CSS, or certain tags that a browser docent support, <br/>\nor keywords that mean something in one browser and not another.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone have any tools they use for this task? Are there any tools? Is it <br/>\neven reasonable to think that automation for this type of testing is <br/>\npossible?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJ. B.

Both options are valid, but are definitely not the same<br/>\n &gt; &gt; thing.<br/>\n &gt; &gt;<br/>\n &gt; &gt; My original question that started this thread was more aimed at the<br/>\n &gt; &gt; second option (validating the output of the JSP, not the contents of<br/>\n &gt; the<br/>\n &gt; &gt; .jsp file itself).<br/>\n &gt;<br/>\n &gt; OK. How do you define a valid HTML document? Different browsers do that<br/>\n &gt; differently. Do you mean something that conforms to a given DTD? XML<br/>\n &gt; schema? If so, then simply instantiate an XML parser with validation<br/>\n &gt; enabled, parse(), then either see an exception (invalid) or don&#39;t<br/>\n &gt; (valid). XMLUnit does this out of the box.<br/>\n &gt;<br/>\n &gt; &lt;snip /&gt;<br/>\n &gt; &gt; Then you could<br/>\n &gt; &gt; use the previously mentioned validating XML parser to validate your<br/>\n &gt; JSPs.<br/>\n &gt;<br/>\n &gt; Certainly, if you can write your JSPs to themselves be XML documents,<br/>\n &gt; then you can forget that they are JSPs and just treat them as XML<br/>\n &gt; documents! :) It&#39;s a Good Thing.<br/>\n &gt; --<br/>\n &gt; J.
