Assertions (and mocks) have especially\n&gt;&gt; contorted themselves in ways that they might finally now be able to relax.\n&gt; Yes, assertions could probably get much benefit from lambdas.\n&gt;\n&gt; I support the idea of having assertions as a separate library which is\n&gt; decoupled from the testing framework (the same way as Hamcrest,\n&gt; FEST-Assert and probably others). The testing framework would then focus\n&gt; fully on the test execution model (e.g. test isolation, execution order,\n&gt; rules and other metaprogramming).\n+1 : Separate library would certainly help those of us who are trying to \nmanage large teams and to ensure they do things like use \nassertThat(blah, is(blah)) instead of assertEquals(blah, blah) \n(assertThat is type safe for refactoring, where assertEquals isn&#39;t)\n\n&gt; There is wide variablity in how assertions can be done (especially in\n&gt; different languages). I don&#39;t have strong opinions about what an assert\n&gt; should be like, and seems that there are as many kinds of asserts as\n&gt; there are testing frameworks.\n&gt;\n&gt; There is less variablity in testing frameworks&#39; execution model, but\n&gt; those differences are often at a more fundamental level (e.g. test\n&gt; isolation vs. shared state). I and others hold strong opinions about them.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thus I would like to be able to mix and match the frameworks and\n&gt; assertions separately, sometimes even using multiple assertion libraries\n&gt; in the same test.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;     - The fact that a Description is both the immutable single name of a test\n&gt;&gt; node, and a mutable builder for the test structure, and then later an\n&gt;&gt; immutable reference for the test structure, is exasperating.\n&gt;&gt;     - The reliance on reflectively-discovered constructors for extensibility\n&gt;&gt; causes some awkwardness.\n&gt;&gt;     - The IDE-centric idea that one should be enable to enumerate all tests\n&gt;&gt; before any is run places some binding constraints, and should be at most\n&gt;&gt; optional in a world in which tests are often run by daemons many more times\n&gt;&gt; a day than by humans.\n&gt; I&#39;ve noticed those as well. I&#39;ve already addressed each of those in Jumi:\n&gt;\n&gt; - A testing framework must assign a unique immutable TestId for each\n&gt; test in a test class, which is then used to send events of when the test\n&gt; was started, finished, failed etc. The TestId implies a tree structure\n&gt; of tests (to be used in test result reports). Everything is expressed as\n&gt; immutable events (Jumi relies heavily on Event Sourcing). See details at\n&gt; http://jumi.fi/api/jumi-api/fi/jumi/api/drivers/SuiteNotifier.html\n&gt;\n&gt; - The fi.jumi.api.drivers.Driver which corresponds\n&gt; org.junit.runner.Runner requires a zero-argument constructor. The test\n&gt; class et al is passed as method argument to\n&gt; http://jumi.fi/api/jumi-api/fi/jumi/api/drivers/Driver.html#findTests\n&gt;\n&gt; - Jumi starts executing tests as soon as possible, at both the suite and\n&gt; test class levels. At suite level, test class execution starts\n&gt; asynchronously before all test classes are discovered (i.e. before Jumi\n&gt; has finished traversing the directories containing test classes). At\n&gt; test class level, more tests can be found during test execution (for\n&gt; example Specsy requires this) and the new test executions can be started\n&gt; asynchronously in parallel (depending on the testing framework and\n&gt; whether the user has disabled parallelism for that test class or the\n&gt; whole suite).\nNice!  I like the idea of getting on with probably CPU bound stuff while \nmay be IO bound on class scan\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;     - There are as many perfect models of test status possibilities as there\n&gt;&gt; are developers.  Passed/Failed?  Passed/Failed/Skipped?\n&gt;&gt;    Passed/Failed/Ignored, etc.  The current design bakes one required system\n&gt;&gt; pretty deep into the internals, unnecessarily.\n&gt; That&#39;s been on my mind for a long time, but I haven&#39;t yet figured out a\n&gt; good way to support all the variations, so I&#39;m deferring the decision. I\n&gt; would love to hear your ideas.\n&gt;\n&gt; A very flexible way would be to allow tagging tests with arbitrary\n&gt; keywords, but then the problem will be that how each of those keywords\n&gt; should affect the user interface. There would have to be at least some\n&gt; keywords with specific meaning, which brings us back to the original\n&gt; question of which states to support.\n&gt;\n&gt; To get started we could list all the variations in use today and the use\n&gt; cases for using each of them (e.g. it&#39;s an acceptance tests for a\n&gt; feature which has not yet been implemented). I&#39;m hoping there to be 5 or\n&gt; less different reasons that are served by test statuses.\nI&#39;d love to see status improvements.  A classic case is assumptions.  We \nwant to show failed assumptions on our Jenkins dashboard.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Now, should the framework to which I&#39;d contribute time to fix these\n&gt;&gt; problems be called JUnit 5, or something entirely different?  That&#39;s\n&gt;&gt; another kettle of fish, with some interesting options to consider.  Looks\n&gt;&gt; like we have at least 9 months to consider them at length.\n&gt; 9 months, like giving birth to a baby. I suppose the names of quite many\n&gt; people have been pondered for that long. :)\n&gt;\n&gt; JUnit&#39;s name is well known, so it&#39;s a marketing bonus. On the other\n&gt; hand, the software industry moves quickly and good technology can get\n&gt; popular regardless of its name.\n&gt;\nI think JUnit has a philosophy of simplicity.  Delivering more \nsimplicity would be worthy of the name JUnit 5 (or should 5,6,7 be \nskipped and call it JUnit 8 ;) )\n\nNeale\n\n\n",
