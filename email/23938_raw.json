With most build tools this means keeping the \nproduction and the test code in different modules, so that you can \nconfigure them different JDKs.\n\nIf that is not possible, then here are some ideas:\n\nMaking JUnit uses reflection for finding out all test methods from a \nclass, and without reflection it would require lots of boilerplate to \nexplicitly call all those methods. An option would be to create your own \nframework (maybe reusing JUnit&#39;s assertions) or start based on a \nframework which uses reflection very little.\n\nFor example my Specsy testing framework (http://specsy.org/) uses \nreflection only when instantiating the test class [1], because the tests \nare declared using closures (in the Java version they will be anonymous \ninner classes, see this draft [2] on the syntax). Hard-coding that \ninstatiation would require only a single-method factory class for each \ntest class.\n\nIn the near future I&#39;ll rewrite Specsy in Java (it will be called Specsy \n2), and create thin frontends at least for Java, Scala and Groovy. After \nthat it might be possible to fork it and create a reflection-free Java \n1.3 compatible version. Specsy 2 and the Jumi test runner \n(http://jumi.fi/), which it will use, will require Java 7, but also Jumi \nuses very little reflection so it might be possible to fork and extract \na limited Java 1.3 compatible version of it.\n\nCreating your own testing framework is actually quite easy, if you just \nkeep the scope small. Without support for running tests in parallel, it \nis possible to implement the same programming model as in Specsy, plus a \nsmall test runner for it, in 10-50 hours. I wrote NanoSpec.go [3] in 6 \nhours (about 300 LOC production code) and it uses Go&#39;s minimal test \nrunner [4] (about 400 LOC), which would not take much longer to \nimplement either.\n\n[1] \nhttps://github.com/orfjackal/specsy/blob/b9fa91cb70d9a09e74c2e71984b2da95c5c82481/src/main/scala/net/orfjackal/specsy/core/SpecClassRunner.scala#L18\n[2] \nhttps://github.com/orfjackal/specsy/blob/46ad34f93c8d1b343db601bf5200c9a1ef085706/specsy-core/src/test/java/org/specsy/examples/JavaStackSpecDraft4.java\n[3] https://github.com/orfjackal/nanospec.go\n[4] http://golang.org/pkg/testing/\n\n-- \nEsko Luontola\nwww.orfjackal.net\n\n",
