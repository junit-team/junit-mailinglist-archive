I have found that<br/>\nthis strategy, though sometimes time consuming (circa 600 seconds), is<br/>\nwell worth it.  It&#39;s much better to find out earlier that the code you<br/>\njust wrote broke the interaction of your objects than waiting for<br/>\nintegration time.  Of course, if you are integrating often, that doesn&#39;t<br/>\nreally become an issue -- but that&#39;s a topic for another mail-list. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n=jason<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Fri, 2002-12-06 at 04:22, Vladimir R.

I have some fuzzy ideas in this direction,<br/>\n&gt; but nothing to make a paper possible yet. The bottom line is<br/>\n&gt; understanding the importance of blazing fast programmer tests and of<br/>\n&gt; separating PTs from CTs.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I did for Xindice (XML Database) is to separate the tests (unit,<br/>\nintegration and stress).  The unit tests run all the time but the<br/>\nintegration<br/>\ntests run less often.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem is that Xindice provides several drivers (xml-rpc and embed)<br/>\nto<br/>\naccess the database.  To test the xml-rpc driver, you have to generate<br/>\nthe<br/>\nxindice.war file, copy it into your Tomcat&#39;s (e.g.) webapps directory<br/>\nand<br/>\nreload it.  If you do this each time you make a tiny modification it&#39;s<br/>\nquite<br/>\npainful (and not everyone has a Tomcat server running).  So it was<br/>\nnatural to<br/>\nseparate the tests according to their complexity.<br/>\n<br/>\nif you&#39;re interested, you can browse the code<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/xml-xindice/java/tests/\">http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/xml-xindice/java/tests/</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother question: how would you handle a test that is supposed to pass<br/>\nbut that<br/>\ncurrently fails because of a problem you can&#39;t fix?  &quot;All the tests must<br/>\npass<br/>\nall the time&quot; is fine if you have control over the entire code, but what<br/>\nif one<br/>\nof the libraries you use has a bug?  While other are fixing the library,<br/>\nyour<br/>\ntests are still broken but it&#39;s still ok to commit new code (because no<br/>\nother<br/>\nnew test fail)...<br/>\n<br/>\nHow can you handle the situation?  Removing the failing test (altering<br/>\nits name<br/>\nfor example) is IMO not so clean if you don&#39;t have a mechanism to<br/>\nautomatically<br/>\nspot them.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Vladimir<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nVladimir R.
