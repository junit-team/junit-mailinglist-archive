Creativity is exercised in solving <br/>\n&gt; business problems - not in configuring the environment.  (Or, even in <br/>\n&gt; using the latest and greatest technology.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   <br/>\n </span></blockquote>It seems to me that the latest and greatest technology being <br/>\nexperimented with here is Junit 4, not Java 5. To use Java 5 for running <br/>\nJunit it would not need to be &quot;installed&quot; by sysadmins anymore than you <br/>\nneed a sysadmin to install junit 4. You just need a JRE somewhere. It <br/>\ncould even be in source control (assuming that&#39;s allowed by the license).<br/>\n<br/>\n- Neil</div>",
