Go for it. :-)\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m still not convinced of the econ=\r\nomics of unit testing at the\n&gt; &gt; lowest level.\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve been lurking this l=\r\nist for quite some time, attended online \nand\n&gt; &gt; offline seminars, listene=\r\nd to to Agile, XP and TDD talks, ...\n&gt; \n&gt; Gotta love theory ... right up un=\r\ntil reality smacks it upside the \nhead.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; And apply it at work.\n&gt; \n&gt; N=\r\now you&#39;re talking.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I am convinced that TDD is a right approach.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n Me too.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I see big value in the agile methods.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yup.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; But =\r\nto my feeling unit testing can be done at the requirements \nlevel.\n&gt; \n&gt; Of =\r\ncourse it can. No one around here is likely to say that it can&#39;t\n&gt; be. Now,=\r\n that said, we also believe that it brings many benefits at\n&gt; the lower lev=\r\nels as well.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; That&#39;s why I am thinking about testdriving this approac=\r\nh:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 1: Write unit tests only to test the requirements.\n&gt; \n&gt; Can&#39;t in=\r\ndividual objects have requirements?\n&gt; \n\n\nYes, they can.\n\n\n&gt; &gt; 2: Write the =\r\ncode that implements these requirements, until tests\n&gt; &gt; pass.\n&gt; &gt; 3: Run t=\r\nhe unit tests together with a code coverage tool\n&gt; &gt; 4: delete all executab=\r\nle lines of code not covered by the unit \ntest\n&gt; \n&gt; If the code was develop=\r\ned with TDD, will there really be much unused\n&gt; code kicking around?\n&gt; \n\n\nS=\r\nome code might just exist because we&#39;ve written a test for it.\n\n\n\n&gt; &gt; &lt;/con=\r\ntroversial&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Good for a first try, but you&#39;ll have to try harder than t=\r\nhat to \nget a\n&gt; good flamefest going. :-)\n&gt; \n&gt; You see, to my mind you&#39;ve d=\r\nescribed integration testing. This is \nvery\n&gt; important and needful to deli=\r\nver software quality, but you&#39;re still\n&gt; only testing the joined together b=\r\nuilding blocks. \n\nI was not talking about integration testing. But indeed I=\r\n am thinking \nabout testing at a higher level within the unit itself.\n\n\n&gt; D=\r\noes it not make\n&gt; sense to ensure that the blocks you&#39;re joining together a=\r\nre of high\n&gt; quality?\n&gt; \n\nYes.\n\n&gt; Simon\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; simonpeter.org | simonpe=\r\nter.com | techbook.info\n&gt;\n\nRegards, Jan\n\n\n\n\n\n",
