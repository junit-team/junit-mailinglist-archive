It appears that many people think there are <br/>\n&quot;magic formulas&quot; for working with JUnit. As a result, they ask silly <br/>\nquestions like, &quot;How do I test an EJB with JUnit????&quot; The people who know <br/>\nthe answer get so tired of writing, &quot;Search this list. Try it. What are you <br/>\nhaving trouble testing?&quot; that they simply stop responding. As a result, <br/>\nquestions are not being answered.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would like to ask everyone on this list to ask specific, pointed <br/>\nquestions, with sample code, if at all possible. Instead of &quot;How to I test <br/>\nan EJB????&quot;, how about, &quot;I did X, Y and Z to test EJBs using JUnit, but it&#39;s <br/>\ntoo slow. Any tips for increasing speed? Here is a sample EJB tets case...&quot;?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you really don&#39;t know how to do X, try searching the web first. Try <br/>\nsearching this list&#39;s archives next. If that does not get you going, then by <br/>\nall means, ask a specific, pointed question.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease, folks! I don&#39;t want to start ignoring this list because its readers <br/>\nshow no initiative.<br/>\n<br/>\nJBR.<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp\">http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp</a></div>",
