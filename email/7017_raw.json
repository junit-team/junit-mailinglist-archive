B. Rainsberger&quot; &lt;jbr@...&gt;\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Hear, hear.\n&gt;\n&gt; The goal of Programmer Tests is to for the programmer to:\n&gt;\n&gt; * have tangible evidence of progress\n&gt; * clarify the needs of the design\n&gt; * &quot;eat his own dog food&quot; by being forced to write client code before\n&gt; writing provider code\n&gt; * keep focus on small steps\n&gt; * avoid writing too much code in one flow\n&gt;\n&gt; I don&#39;t see how a dedicated unit tester can make that happen for a\n&gt; programmer.\n\nThat is all true - but I didn&#39;t say that a dedicated unit tester&#39;s purpose\nwas to replace TDD - what I said was that the dedicated unit tester helped\nin getting more and better tests earlier. A dedicated unit tester also helps\nintroduce the concept and value of unit and early testing to teams,\nmanagement, companies and developers. This helps get your foot in the door.\nYou have to remember that there are a lot of companies out there that don&#39;t\npractice XP or even halfway decent practices, and you can&#39;t make them\nswallow XP or TDD all in one gulp. The purpose of any good practice is to\nimprove the quality of software, but you can&#39;t accomplish that in one fell\nswoop.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; What I *can* see is how a dedicated tester can think of tests that the\n&gt; programmer didn&#39;t need to drive the design, or just plain missed.\n&gt; Still, a dedicated unit tester seems to aim at the wrong spot. A\n&gt; dedicated integration tester or end-to-end tester seems about right.\n&gt;\n\nEarly testing has a value all its own, whether it is accomplished by TDD, or\ndedicated unit testers or both. As I said in original post, developers\ntypically don&#39;t have the aptitude, attitude or experience to write good test\ncases. TDD is great, but if the quality of the tests the developer writes\nsuck, then bugs in the design and the code are going to make it through.\nThat is where a dedicated unit tester shines; they serve as an independent\nand fresh unbiased set of eyes on the code/design. If you just assume that\nthe tests written by developers during TDD were good enough, and then wait\nuntil integration or system testing to test again, you are going to be\nsurprised by an existing bugs that you could have probably caught earlier.\nYou will also be risking big-bang integration, or at least one aspect of it.\n\nI have been on both sides of the fence; I have equal years experience in\nboth QA/Testing and on the development side of the software engineering\nfence (15+ years in all), and typically, a developer will not test their own\ncode as well or as thoroughly as an independent tester - especially a good\ntester who has the right attitude.\n\nDevelopment/writing code is essentially a creative process, and a creative\nattitude is usually the result. Testing is a destructive process and it\noften takes a destructive attitude (and aptitude) to properly test software.\nSome developers can do it, but usually not right off the bat - many\ndevelopers never truly get the hang of it. TDD is good, but it does not\nobviate the need for further testing, and as with all testing, the earlier\nit is done, the earlier you will find bugs - and that is a &quot;good thing&quot;.\n\n&gt; I feel appropriately inspired. Let me write the article, then I&#39;ll be\n&gt; back. :)\n\nI don&#39;t see the need. As I said I don&#39;t see a conflict between TDD and\nindependent unit testing. The two can coexist. The only danger I would see\nwith both coexisting is that the developer may adopt the attitude that since\nthere is an independent unit tester, that there is no reason for him/her to\ndo TDD. That is a mistake in comprehension, logic and a flawed conclusion -\nit requires education, not the elimination of independent unit testing. The\nsame could be said for any kind of testing right? After all, why do\nintegration or system testing if we already did TDD? TDD catches all bugs\nanyway right? Why bother with further testing? Wrong!\n\nIf I had developers that wrote poor tests because they felt the unit testers\nwould catch the bugs anyway, I would probably approach the situation the\nsame as if I had a developer who wrote poor code because testers would\nsooner or later find any bugs. If they couldn&#39;t be made to see the wisdom of\nearly testing and TDD, then I would probably replace them with someone who\ndid.\n\nNow maybe some people out there have a unique team of developers who really\ndo write such good tests during TDD that an independent unit tester would\njust be a waste of time. Kewl! Good for you! Then don&#39;t waste the time. But\nI live in the real world where developers don&#39;t write good tests, especially\nfor their own code. I also live in a world where management and developers\nare often resistant to XP practices (hell, even I don&#39;t really care for\nPaired Programming).\n\nThe original question was not about TDD vs. independent unit testing, the\noriginal question was how do you justify either one to management and\nproject teams. The fact that the question was asked indicates a problem that\nI suggested a possible way to get your foot in the door. Unless you are\nstarting a new company, or a new team, and you are starting a new project,\nyou often have to find a way to ease these practices in the back door. Most\nof us don&#39;t have the luxury or ability of starting anew from scratch, and we\nhave to get management and recalcitrant developers to buy into new ideas.\n\nAlso, as I said, don&#39;t make the mistake of hubris in thinking that TDD is\ngoing to find all the bugs and that an independent unit tester wouldn&#39;t find\nat least some also - I dare say that an independent unit tester would\nprobably find numerous bugs. Hire me and I will prove it to you. ;-)\n\nFWIW,\nLauren\n\n=====\nLooking for an experienced Java/C++ Software Engineer?\nSee: http://developerdude.mystarband.net/resume.html\n\n\n",
