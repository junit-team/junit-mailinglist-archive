Timothy is correct, this is a difficult problem, and the best\nway may in fact be to isolate the classes appropriately if possible.\nOne of the things I was hoping to check was packaging errors, where a\nclass that the client needs is only loaded from the client jars even\nthough the server jars have them as well. I had hoped this was a\ncommon problem that others had solved (and might be in your book), but\napparently not.\n\n",
