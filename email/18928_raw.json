Because we don&#39;t want to change  the whole programming\n=\r\nparadigm to XP we rather want to use a test-last method in the\nbeginning an=\r\nd then watch out for further steps.\nI&#39;m now in the process of investigating=\r\n the basic requirements and\nconditions.\nOne question that occured is if it&#39;=\r\ns possible to quantify the amount\nof extra time you need when using unit te=\r\nsting compared to the\nnon-testing approach. I solely refer to the writing o=\r\nf unit tests.\nLater saving of time (by better code) shouldn&#39;t be considered=\r\n. So\nwhat&#39;s your experience? Can anybody do a statement about time\nconsumpt=\r\nion of writing unit tests?\n\nRegards\nFelix\n\n\n",
