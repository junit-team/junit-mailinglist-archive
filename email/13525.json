I<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; would use DbUnit or the<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; ORM, whichever was simpler. In your case, I&#39;d use<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; the ORM.<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; But, even better, I&#39;d use a fake (not a mock!) Data<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; Repository layer<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; when testing Business Logic without worrying about<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; where in particular<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; the data comes from.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I agree. But what do you tell about integration<br/>\n&gt; testing? Some bugs will never show up if only mock<br/>\n&gt; objects are used. How do you catch them? Chapter 13<br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t seem to address our needs for integration<br/>\n&gt; testing.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It&#39;s true that we need Collaboration Tests (end-to-end, integration, <br/>\nwhatever size they are) to find some defects, but that doesn&#39;t mean we <br/>\nought to rely on them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI recently added a little description of my approach to <br/>\nc2.com/cgi/wiki?AbstractTestCases, but I need to write more about it. <br/>\nSomeday.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; You only mention FIT very shortly in your book. Is<br/>\n&gt; this the ultimate solution for integration testing?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No, because there is no such thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nFit is an excellent way to write customer-facing tests as well as <br/>\ndata-driven programmer tests.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; What do you think about TestNG? I see that you don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; mention it in your book.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I have never used TestNG; however, based on what I have seen, read and <br/>\nwhat Cedric has told me, I would use TestNG mostly to add tests to <br/>\nLegacy Code (any code I&#39;m afraid to change) when TestNG&#39;s <br/>\nintegration-test-related features would be useful. I would generally <br/>\nlook for ways to refactor the codebase to be able to use Isolation Tests <br/>\n(one object at a time) most of the time.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; What do you say about test dependencies? In your book<br/>\n&gt; I only found a solution for ensuring that the tests<br/>\n&gt; are executed in a special order. But what about &quot;skip<br/>\n&gt; test y if test x failed&quot;? It reminds me of our batch<br/>\n&gt; programs: run batch y (which depends on results of<br/>\n&gt; batch x) only if batch x succeeded. Is there an addon<br/>\n&gt; for this for JUnit or a small and simple solution? Or<br/>\n&gt; should it not be done? In a way I agree with the<br/>\n&gt; author of TestNG that it would be nice to see 1 test<br/>\n&gt; passed, 1 test failed, 24 tests skipped instead of 1<br/>\n&gt; test passed and 25 tests failed.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is one reason I&#39;d use TestNG, but as an intermediate solution. Test <br/>\ninterdependence is a design smell as well as making <br/>\ntesting-as-fault-finding less effective/more annoying. I would want to <br/>\nrefactor away from interdependent tests, then decide whether those tests <br/>\nneed to move from TestNG to JUnit. From what I can tell, probably not.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
