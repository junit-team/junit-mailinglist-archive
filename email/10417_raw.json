Am I wrong on that?\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; No: you are correct. First, JUnit adds all the tests, then executes\nthem.\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Would there be a way to test the customers 100 by 100, freeing the\nmemory\n&gt; &gt; each time?\n&gt; \n&gt; You would have to build a test suite, execute it, then build another, \n&gt; then execute that one.\n\nAs there is no junit infrastructure, I started with a solution as\nfollows:\n\nMy main method looks like:\n\n\n        int maxId = 100;\n        while (maxId &lt; 9000)\n        {\n            junit.textui.TestRunner.run(suite(maxId));\n            maxId += 100;                                    \n            HibernateConnections.session.clear();\n            HibernateConnections.sessionPg.clear();\n\n        }\n\nmy suite method looks like:\n\n        TestSuite suite= new TestSuite();\n        suite.addTest(CustomersTest.suite(maxId));\n        return suite;  \n\nAnd my CustomersTest.suite(int maxId) looks like:\n\n            Iterator iterator = session.iterate(&quot;from Customer where\ncustomerid &lt; &quot;+maxId + &quot;and customerid &gt; &quot; + (maxId-100));\n            int i = 0;\n            custdb.hibernate.Customer customerPg;\n            while (iterator.hasNext())\n            {  \n                customerSuite.addTest(....)\n            }\n\n\nThis way I effectively get the tests executed completely separated.\nWhat I&#39;ll look for now is that all results are put in the same object.\nNow, after 100 customers have been tested, I get the report printed. I&#39;d\nlike to \nget it after all tests have passed (when getting out of the\nwhile(maxId&lt;9000)).\n\n\nI&#39;ll post if I find the solution, but help is welcome on that problem ;-)\n\nRaph\n\n\n\n\n \nYahoo!
