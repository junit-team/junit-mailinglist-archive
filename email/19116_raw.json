Now I would write a method in \nyour production code called &quot;connectToDatabase()&quot; to make the test pass.\n\nTo test whether the query is correct, just check the string.\n\npublic void testSelectSubmissionQuerySql() throws Exception {\n     SubmissionQuery query = new SubmissionQuery();\n     assertEquals(\n         &quot;SELECT SUBMISSION_GUID FROM SUBMISSION WHERE SUBMISSION_GUID = \n143&quot;,\n         query.getSql());\n}\n\nThis test simply makes sure that if someone changes the query in \nSubmissionQuery, then they do it twice to verify that they really wanted \nto change it. This is much like entering a password twice when you \nregister at a web site. Now I would create a new class SubmissionQuery \nthat encapsulates the statement. (It looks like too much design now, but \nas your system grows, it will be very helpful.)\n\nAs for the result of the query, I would write this test:\n\npublic void testSelectSubmissionQueryOneRow() throws Exception {\n     //... insert a row into the database with GUID 143\n     SubmissionQuery query = new SubmissionQuery();\n     Connection connection = application.connectToDatabase();\n     List guids = query.execute(connection);\n     assertEquals(Collections.singletonList(new Integer(143)), guids);\n}\n\nFor the first comment, you need to put some sample data in the database \nso your test can find it. You can do this with some JDBC code or using a \ntool like DbUnit. Now you can implement SubmissionQuery.execute() with \nthe code you wrote in your first posting, except this time, execute() \naccepts the Connection as a parameter. This way, you can test the \nconnection separately. It will look like this:\n\nclass SubmissionQuery {\n     public List execute(Connection connection) throws Exception {\n         ResultSet resultSet = null;\n         PreparedStatement selectStatement = null;\n         List guids = new ArrayList();\n\n         try {\n             selectStatement =\n                  connection.prepareStatement(getSql());\n             resultSet = selectStatement.executeQuery();\n             while(resultSet.next()) {\n                 guids.add(resultSet.getInteger(&quot;SUBMISSION_GUID&quot;));\n             }\n         }\n         finally {\n             try {\n                 if(resultSet != null) resultSet.close();\n                 if(selectStatement != null) selectStatement.close();\n             }\n             catch (Exception nothingWeCanDo) {}\n         }\n\n         return guids;\n     }\n}\n\nGood luck.\n-- \nJ.
