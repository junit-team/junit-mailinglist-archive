This could be noise, or really good  <br/>\nfeedback depending on your circumstance. Most would say it is noisy.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you make methods more visible, you can test them more easily, but  <br/>\nothers can now use them more easily. You are potentially confusing  <br/>\napi users.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you just exercise the public methods, then you have less brittle  <br/>\ntests, but you probably want to combine your testing efforts with  <br/>\ncoverage to make sure that if you change a method to not go through a  <br/>\nroute any more, that there is still some route with tests that cover  <br/>\nthat behavior. Also, it could be argued that since the private is  <br/>\nessentially inside the public method, that you may have to do more  <br/>\nindirect work to get the public method to go down all the branches of  <br/>\nthe private method. Indirection can give more flexibility, and it can  <br/>\ngive more confusion.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck,<br/>\n<br/>\nBob Evans<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.junitfactory.com/\">http://www.junitfactory.com/</a><br/>\nSend Java, Get Tests<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Feb 7, 2007, at 11:26 AM, Gabriel Nascimento wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; What is the best approach for testing private methods?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks,<br/>\n&gt; Gabriel<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBob Evans<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.junitfactory.com/\">http://www.junitfactory.com/</a><br/>\nSend Java code, get tests.
