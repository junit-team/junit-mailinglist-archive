I ended up having to write separate classes to get all the tests done.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again,<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\n<br/>\njim<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Bob Runstein&quot; &lt;rrunstein@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;cant_jim&quot; &lt;jimcant@&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; How can I capture the standard output of test? I need to check that<br/>\n&gt; the messages from the class I&#39;m testing are correct. For example if my<br/>\n&gt; class class calls a parser that print &quot;invalid input at line xx&quot; when it<br/>\n&gt; fails, I want to be able go catch that output and compare it to the<br/>\n&gt; expected value. If it could be directed to a file on a per-test basis, I<br/>\n&gt; could do a diff to check it.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Any suggestions would be appreciated.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Thanks,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Jim Cant<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You can override the default behavior of System.out.println() using<br/>\n&gt; System.setOut(PrintStream).  Subclass PrintStream and override the print<br/>\n&gt; methods to log to a file that you can specify.  Even better, add a<br/>\n&gt; StringBuilder member with setter and getter to the PrintStream and<br/>\n&gt; override the print methods to append to that.  Your test can do<br/>\n&gt; assertEquals on your expected value and the toString value of the<br/>\n&gt; StringBuilder.  Don&#39;t forget to reset the PrintStream before each test.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
