Determine whether Extract Class should be used to split the\n&gt; responsibilities of the class into two or more abstractions. If so,\n&gt; refactor and write unit tests for the public methods of the new\n&gt; classes. Return to step 1.\n&gt;\n\nI don&#39;t see this as a solution. If the method wasn&#39;t public before, it \nshouldn&#39;t be public now just because it moved to a different class. If \nthe only reason it becomes public is because it moved to a different \nclass, it would be better off as the original private method inside the \none class. Public API should be kept to a minimum, especially if you \nexpect anybody to use your API. If the API is purely for your app&#39;s own \ninternal use, then this constraint can be relaxed a little, but you \nshould still strive for the minimum exposure of class internals. This is \none of the first principles of object oriented design, and test driven \ndevelopment doesn&#39;t really change it to any significant extent.\n\n-- \n﻿Elliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nXML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim\n\n",
