This is why it always creates a new\n&gt;  &gt; instance of the test class for each test.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; If you really don&#39;t want your tests to be isolated, then I agree this is\n&gt;  &gt; a waste of resources, but I have two questions:\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; 1. Do you really want your tests /not/ to be isolated?\n&gt; \n&gt; You make it sound as if the only way to have isolated tests is for JUnit to\n&gt; create a new instance every time...\n\nI merely wanted to test Vietchau&#39;s assumptions before giving too much \nincorrect advice.\n\n&gt; There are other ways that are just as\n&gt; valid :-)\n\nThat&#39;s true, but that&#39;s not what JUnit does, and this is a JUnit list, \nso I thought I would ask questions and offer advice within the context \nof JUnit.\n\n&gt; As you already know, I think it would be nice if JUnit at least gave us the\n&gt; option.\n\nFor years, we have answered people&#39;s &quot;how do I do X?&quot; questions with \ndiscussions about design. I no longer think that is appropriate, so I \ndidn&#39;t intend to get into a design discussion so quickly.\n\n&gt; Most of my tests have immutable state that is quite expensive to create, so\n&gt; using the same instance wouldn&#39;t violate the isolation since none of my\n&gt; tests will actually modify that state (they will just run tests against it),\n&gt; and they can therefore still be invoked in any order.\n\nThat is one safe way to maintain test isolation without having to \ninstantiate the resources each time. I have no way to know whether \nthat&#39;s Vietchau&#39;s situation, so I ask questions.\n\nMost of my tests don&#39;t have expensive-to-create test state, so that&#39;s \nthe way I tend to avoid the problem. Once again, I didn&#39;t plan to inject \nthat into the discussion until I knew more.\n-- \nJ. B.
