The test data must \n&gt; be coming\n&gt; from the test classes and not be inside the database. So we need \n&gt; Mock objects\n&gt; I think. But I don&#39;t know how to create them since I still don&#39;t \n&gt; know how\n&gt; our framework works inside and how Mock objects are used.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now you think it is not necessary that our framework supports Mock \n&gt; objects?\n\nDo you know what types of result sets you expect from the database\nlayer?  If so, mock out your database connection logic (the object that\nwould return you a java.sql.ResultSet) and have it return mock result\nsets from which you can create your business objects.  Any IDE worth its\nsalt should be able to stub the &#39;million and one&#39; methods in ResultSet\n-- then you simply implement the ones you want.  How you create those\nMockResultSet&#39;s is another story.\n\nWe have some code for doing it, but I don&#39;t know if I can release it to\nthe public (I am a contractor on this project).  If so, I will do it\nsoon, if not I will see if I have time to mock one up and share it with\nthe group (perhaps Junit-Addons?).  The basic idea we have here for\ncreating our MockResultSet&#39;s is to create them with column names and\nvalues.  They can be single-row or multi-row sets.  Basically, we\nimplemented the navigation methods that we needed (i.e. next()) and the\ngetXYZ() methods that we needed (i.e. getString(...), getInt(...),\ngetLong(...), getDate(...)).\n\nHope that helps.\n=jason\n\n\n",
