Thus the resulting test class would look something like\nthis:\n\npublic class TreeHolderTest {\n   private TreeHolder treeHolder;\n   private TreeNode root;\n   protected void setUp() {\n\tCollection coll = ...;\n\ttreeHolder = new TreeHolder(coll);\n\troot = treeHolder.getRootNode();\n   }\n   public void testCreation() {\n\tassertTrue(!treeHolder.isEmpty)\n\tassertEquals(new TreeNode(&quot;....&quot;), root);\n\tassertEquals(3, root.getChildren().size());\n\t// navigate through the required tree and check the structure\n   }\n   public void testCalculateSomethig() {\n\ttreeHolder.calculateSomething(...);\n\t// navigate to the nodes which should have changed \n\t//and check their state\n   }\n   ...\n}\n\nThe complex part is navigating and checking the state. If you have the\nnecessary public interface, try to extract duplicate code in your test\nclass into methods of its own, e.g.:\n   private void assertNode(TreeNode node, String type, ...) {\n\tassertEquals(type, node.getType());\n\t....\n   }\n\nYou might not have public methods for performing the navigation and\nnecessary checks. In that case you have several possibilities:\n- Add those methods. When your tests need those methods the probability\nis high that some other client code will need them soon.\n- Implement a toString() in MyNode and/or TreeHolder which prints the\nrelevant attributes/structure and do a string compare.\n- Use mock objects for testing your TreeHolder class. This would require\nsome major refactoring of your existing code.\n\nThe problem you are facing - that your code is hard to test - is mainly\ndue to your not having written the code test first. Code driven by\nup-front tests is easy to test by definition. You have to get used to\ndoing it that way, though. I recommend the articles on objectmentor.com\nand xprogramming.com as a starting point if you are interested in the\ntest first idea.\n\ngood luck,\nJohannes\n\n&gt; Thanks for your reply. My TreeHolder class is something like this:\n&gt; \n&gt; // Note: MyNode implements MutableTreeNode interface\n&gt; // and holds a UserDefinedObject\n&gt; \n&gt; public class TreeHolder {\n&gt; \n&gt;     MyNode rootNode; //the root node for the whole tree\n&gt; \n&gt;     public TreeHolder(Collection items) {\n&gt;         //constructor logic to build MyNodes out of the input\n&gt;         //items and set rootNode as the root of the generated\n&gt;         //tree of MyNodes.\n&gt; \n&gt;         rootNode = ... //build a MyNode Tree From &quot;items&quot;\n&gt;     }\n&gt; \n&gt;     public void calculateSomething(int contextValue) {\n&gt; \n&gt;          //This changes the state of some MyNodes in the tree\n&gt;          rootNode.calculateSomething(contextValue);\n&gt;     }\n&gt; \n&gt;     //.... several such calculate methods\n&gt; \n&gt;     public void summarizeAll() {\n&gt; \n&gt;         //This again changes the state in some other way.\n&gt;         rootNode.summarizeAll();\n&gt;     }\n&gt; \n&gt;     public MyPackagedObject getAsNewPacakgedObject() {\n&gt; \n&gt;         //This packages the MyNode tree into a flattened\n&gt;         //object and returns it.\n&gt; \n&gt;         return rootNode.newPackagedObject();\n&gt;     }\n&gt; }\n&gt; \n&gt; I have written TestCases for the MyNode object already. Every\n&gt; calculate method on TreeHolder changes the state of the rootNode (or\n&gt; one/many subnodes.) So, how do I go about testing if the state\n&gt; changes are correct? Or rather, should I even be writing them (since\n&gt; TestMyNode may already covers those cases?)\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks in advance for your help.\n&gt; --Das\n\n",
