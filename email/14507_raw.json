Imagine that you have class with one point of \n&gt; entry\n&gt; for the client i.e. one public method. You can&#39;t change the access \n&gt; modifier\n&gt; of your method just to test it. Wrapping your private method in a public\n&gt; method is just the same as changing the access modifier. It is will\n&gt; documented and it works to use java reflection.\n&gt;\n&gt; The developers in the project I am currently working changed their \n&gt; private\n&gt; methods to public just to UNIT test their code. It is currently very\n&gt; important to test the private methods as it accounts for over 60% of the\n&gt; functionality and logic. I have found that enables me to test bottom \n&gt; up and\n&gt; I have more confidence when coding and when I need to refactor.\n&gt;\n&gt; I have posted the SecureClassAccess.java in the &quot;files&quot; section of \n&gt; group for\n&gt; anyone that does want to us it to test their private methods.\n\n\nThe issue is that when it is hard to test something without tricks (like \nreflective access) it usually means that there is a design with better \ncohesion out there to discover.  I&#39;d say that if 60% of your logic is in \nprivate methods, then chances are very high that this is true for that code.\n\nMichael Feathers\nwww.objectmentor.com\n\n\n\n",
