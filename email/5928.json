That way you strengthen the API, removing<br/>\ndependencies on those two classes.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe refactoring would be done by creating the interfaces, and then<br/>\nhaving those two classes implement the interfaces.  From there, you can<br/>\nensure that the JUnit internals work with the new interfaces (instead<br/>\nof the classes).  You can even write the testcases to prove that old<br/>\nTestCases still work with this change.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is doable, and it is a relatively simple refactoring that would be<br/>\nsuitable for an article.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;They that give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety<br/>\n  deserve neither liberty nor safety.&quot;<br/>\n                 - Benjamin Franklin</div>",
