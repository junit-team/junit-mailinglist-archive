It appears that many people think there are \n&quot;magic formulas&quot; for working with JUnit. As a result, they ask silly \nquestions like, &quot;How do I test an EJB with JUnit????&quot; The people who know \nthe answer get so tired of writing, &quot;Search this list. Try it. What are you \nhaving trouble testing?&quot; that they simply stop responding. As a result, \nquestions are not being answered.\n\nI would like to ask everyone on this list to ask specific, pointed \nquestions, with sample code, if at all possible. Instead of &quot;How to I test \nan EJB????&quot;, how about, &quot;I did X, Y and Z to test EJBs using JUnit, but it&#39;s \ntoo slow. Any tips for increasing speed? Here is a sample EJB tets case...&quot;?\n\nIf you really don&#39;t know how to do X, try searching the web first. Try \nsearching this list&#39;s archives next. If that does not get you going, then by \nall means, ask a specific, pointed question.\n\nPlease, folks! I don&#39;t want to start ignoring this list because its readers \nshow no initiative.\n\nJBR.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp\n\n\n",
