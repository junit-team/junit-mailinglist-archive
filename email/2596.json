    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1642974458\">Hello. I have been using junit successfully for several weeks, but <br/>\nhave only been able to run tests which I locate directly below junit <br/>\nitself. I&#39;m tired of relocating packages to the junit hierarchy to <br/>\ntest them, and I&#39;m sure I should be able to run tests on any package <br/>\nanywhere if I have my system path and classpath set up correctly. <br/>\nJust haven&#39;t gotten it right yet...<br/>\n<br/>\nI have read all the junit.org documentation and articles about <br/>\norganizing test cases into suites, etc., but have not seen anything <br/>\nthat specifically explains how to run TestRunner against packages <br/>\nlocated elsewhere on the drive.<br/>\n<br/>\nCan someone please tell me what I&#39;m doing wrong in terms of setup:<br/>\n<br/>\nI have various Java projects stored as d:&#92;projects&#92;projname and am <br/>\nattempting J2EE format, so for any particular project named ABC the <br/>\nsource is located at<br/>\n d:&#92;projects&#92;projABC&#92;source&#92;java&#92;com&#92;companyname&#92;ABC&#92; <br/>\nwith subfolders as needed below that.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy corresponding junit tests are in a parallel structure at <br/>\nd:&#92;projects&#92;projABC&#92;tests&#92;java&#92;com&#92;companyname&#92;ABC&#92; <br/>\n<br/>\nThe class files for the source are located at<br/>\n d:&#92;abc_webapp&#92;web-inf&#92;classes&#92;com&#92;companyname&#92;ABC&#92;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe class files for my junit test files are located in the same place <br/>\nas the test files themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn each test class, the package statement says <br/>\n package com.companyname.abc;<br/>\n<br/>\nand the import statements are whatever is needed from java/javax plus <br/>\nwhatever is needed from the project source plus <br/>\n import junit.framework.*;<br/>\n<br/>\nI develop on an NT machine. I&#39;ve got classpath pointing to <br/>\n d:&#92;projects&#92;projABC&#92;source&#92;java (although this seems unnecessary) <br/>\nand<br/>\n d:&#92;projects&#92;projABC&#92;tests&#92;java <br/>\nand<br/>\n d:&#92;abc_webapp&#92;web-inf&#92;classes<br/>\nand<br/>\n d:&#92;junit3_7 (although this seems unnecessary)<br/>\nand<br/>\n d:&#92;junit3_7&#92;junit.jar<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve got path pointing to <br/>\n d:&#92;projects&#92;projABC&#92;tests&#92;java<br/>\nand<br/>\n d:&#92;junit3_7<br/>\nand<br/>\n d:&#92;junit3_7&#92;junit.jar (although this seems unnecessary)<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a command prompt window, I cannot run the junit TestRunner from <br/>\nanyplace other than down in the junit3_7 folder, so I drop down <br/>\nthere. Then I can run all of the Junit TestRunner variations, but <br/>\nwhen I try to reference a test class located elsewhere on the hard <br/>\ndrive using com.companyname.abc.SomeTest I get a &quot;class not found&quot; <br/>\nerror.<br/>\n<br/>\nHopefully I&#39;m just missing the boat on something simple. Thanks for <br/>\nyour help.<br/>\n<br/>\n- DJ<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S. - Also, any further advice about how to better organize test <br/>\nfiles in relation to project files would be welcome. Putting them in <br/>\na structure parallel to the source code made sense to me, but might <br/>\nnot be the best.</div>",
