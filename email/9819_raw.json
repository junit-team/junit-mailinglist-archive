Note\n&gt; &gt; that the fixture is not just the objects, but their state as well.\n&gt; &gt; You may have instance of the same classes, but with different state\n&gt; &gt; (e.g. empty list, one element, two elements...). They are different\n&gt; &gt; fixtures and should be in different TestCase subclasses.\n&gt;\n&gt; Question about this.  Obviously each &#39;object&#39; can have its own state\n&gt; but through static attributes each class can have its own state\n&gt; also.  How do you deal with that with reference to this discussion?\n\nThe idea is to define a set of objects which are reinitialized before\neach test.  You do this to avoid contamination between tests.  Clearly\nyou could reinitialize static variables for use as part of a fixture.\nBut it&#39;s cleaner to create brand-new objects for use in the fixture.\n\nIf you use static variables of the TestCase, you have to be careful.  If\nyou create new objects, you don&#39;t have to think so much.  So create new\nobjects.  Who wants to think?\n\n;-)\n\n--\nJim Dixon  jdd@...   tel +44 117 982 0786  mobile +44 797 373 7881\n\n\n",
