With annotations you don&#39;t need<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to inherit from a framework (jUnit) class.  You simply annotate the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; class and it becomes a TestCase.  This means you don&#39;t need to break<br/>\n&gt; &gt; out your tests into separate classes (though one is still free to do<br/>\n&gt; &gt; so).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m biased, being a JUnit user, but I don&#39;t like the idea of tests <br/>\n&gt; living in with the class under test.

That&#39;s the main point.  Since<br/>\nJava is single inheritance there are times when you want to have your<br/>\ntest live in some framework (say testing in J2EE) and having to<br/>\ninherit from the jUnit class becomes an obstacle to testing in some of<br/>\nthose cases.  (There are other obstacles too, of course.)  So I meant<br/>\nthe benefits of decoupling.  The framework can run tests and still be<br/>\nautomatic without imposing any requirements on the hierarchy of the<br/>\ntest classes.</div>",
