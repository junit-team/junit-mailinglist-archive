In many\n&gt; cases, teams find the most value in simulating =\r\nthese kinds of UI\n&gt; interactions in their automated tests: when the notific=\r\nation is clicked, it\n&gt; generates some kind of call back into the app.  Your=\r\n automated test simply\n&gt; verifies that the call out to the notification man=\r\nager is made, and then\n&gt; explicitly triggers the call back into the app.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; It is true that this kind of test will not catch, for example, if you&#39;ve=\r\n\n&gt; made a wrong assumption about the notification manager API, and are call=\r\ning\n&gt; it in a way that looks good in the test, but doesn&#39;t actually create =\r\nan\n&gt; on-screen notification.  Many teams find that occasionally manually te=\r\nsting\n&gt; the app/UI integration is cheap and sufficient to catch these kinds=\r\n of\n&gt; errors.\n&gt; \n&gt; Good luck,\n&gt; \n&gt;    David Saff\n&gt; \n&gt; On Tue, May 22, 2012 =\r\nat 8:27 AM, akshay.mnit11 &lt;akshay.mnit11@...&gt;wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; **\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I=\r\n am writing testing framework to test an application.\n&gt; &gt; This application =\r\nreceives IM(audio/video) and then notifies the user\n&gt; &gt; through notificatio=\r\nn bar.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; i need an automation to click on notification item.
