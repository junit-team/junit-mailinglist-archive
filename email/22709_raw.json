There are five chapters at this point,\nwith the fifth one being a description of thinking through a requirement to\ncome up with both tests and code. I&#39;m actually back re-writing the fifth\nchapter right now as I am not really satisfied with it. So, take it as you\nfind it and if it works for you that&#39;s wonderful. I&#39;ll announce when I have\nany new updates.\n\nSimon\n\n\nOn Mon, May 17, 2010 at 2:37 PM, Kent Beck &lt;kentb@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; I am recording a series of screencasts on TDD for the Pragmatic\n&gt; Programmers. My example program is an interface to Tokyo Tyrant (a simple\n&gt; key/value store), so it isn&#39;t as &quot;business-y&quot; as the example you requested,\n&gt; but it does go through the whole TDD process, at least the way I do it.\n&gt;\n&gt; The series will be four half-hour episodes. You can see the first ten\n&gt; minutes of the raw footage of the first two episodes at\n&gt; http://vimeo.com/user3553347/videos. I&#39;ll be sure to post here when the\n&gt; series is released.\n&gt;\n&gt; That said, I think there is scope for many more specialized demonstrations\n&gt; of TDD. I hope lots of folks jump in with their favorite IDE, application,\n&gt; language, and/or technique.\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt;\n&gt; Kent\n&gt;\n&gt; On May 17, 2010, at 11:33 AM, amalcamel wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi, I am new to this forum and new to JUnit. I started searching for best\n&gt; practices and found that people were asking that question all the way back\n&gt; in 2001! Kind of intimidating!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Anyway, what I am looking for is not &quot;best practices&quot;, per se, but a real\n&gt; world example. And from that I mean an example that starts from an idea in\n&gt; someone&#39;s head and evolves all the way through application completion and\n&gt; testing coverage. For example, I am thinking of an auto insurance type of\n&gt; application that has certain requirements, say 10, and how the tests are\n&gt; derived from the requirements and the code gets derived from the tests.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; We have many developers that are new to Test Driven Development, and to\n&gt; simply come out with best practices and ask them to get on board will never\n&gt; work. However, if we can take a real world example, from start to finish,\n&gt; and show how the tests did drive the code and how refactoring became so much\n&gt; simpler as a result, that would be a great start into changing the mentality\n&gt; of some of our developers (myself included ;-)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Any suggestions?\n&gt; &gt; Thank you,\n&gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; Elaine\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
