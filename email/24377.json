First some words to the environment:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In the project I need the feature we currently have 9 developers and it<br/>\n&gt; might be more. Even freelancers. There are something around 20k tests. What<br/>\n&gt; we want to achieve is to enable a global timeout rule that applies<br/>\n&gt; different timeouts to tests depending on their category (eg SlowTests.class<br/>\n&gt; may take longer than other tests). Also there are other things to take into<br/>\n&gt; consideration (eg is some context already loaded, otherwise the timeout<br/>\n&gt; will be increased).<br/>\n&gt; This rule already exists and is registered in some abstract base class. Its<br/>\n&gt; working fine.<br/>\n&gt; Having this amount of tests makes it very hard to make sure that every<br/>\n&gt; class is annotated with it. Also not all tests inherit from the abstract<br/>\n&gt; test class and I would like to keep it that way. It would be just some work<br/>\n&gt; to put the rule in every test but what about tests written in the future.<br/>\n&gt; I need to make sure that the rule is applied to every test especially when<br/>\n&gt; the developer forgets about it. Its a rule that is intended to avoid<br/>\n&gt; developers slowing down jenkins build by writing slow tests without<br/>\n&gt; annotating them as such.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; That said using a different runner is not an option. Also we already have a<br/>\n&gt; hard time mixing spring-runner, mockito-runner, junitparam-runner (btw<br/>\n&gt; we/you should copy some of that behaviour as it is a lot more flexible than<br/>\n&gt; junit parameterized test [1])) aso-behaviour (btw: we/you need to think<br/>\n&gt; about the runner-concept. it would be a lot better to have one runner and<br/>\n&gt; registering behaviour to it (eg being able to register as many &quot;runners&quot; as<br/>\n&gt; I want to).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Scanning classpath is a good thing. We already use classpathsuite [2]. That<br/>\n&gt; enables us to create suites without having to specify all classes in it<br/>\n&gt; (another feature that would very well fit junit). We could for example<br/>\n&gt; annotate a rule with a classifier (basepacke, package or package.classname)<br/>\n&gt; and it would get applied to everything that matches. But this kind of<br/>\n&gt; behaviour would introduce a completely new way of configuration to junit (a<br/>\n&gt; little cdi/spring-ish). Maybe it would be a good idea to overthink the<br/>\n&gt; junit-concept leading this direction anyway but I get the feeling its a<br/>\n&gt; little too much for this concern.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; At last I do not think the external switch is a problem as its highly<br/>\n&gt; optional. If you use it, you know what you are doing. Dont you think so?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [1] <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://code.google.com/p/junitparams/\">https://code.google.com/p/junitparams/</a><br/>\n&gt; [2] <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://johanneslink.net/projects/cpsuite.jsp\">http://johanneslink.net/projects/cpsuite.jsp</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 2013/4/29 Kevin Cooney &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kcooney@...\">kcooney@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Henning,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sorry for the lack of response. JUnit is maintained by volunteers, and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; sometimes our day jobs get busy. I was waiting for David to respond (I<br/>\n&gt; am a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; sometimes contributor) but here are my thoughts.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; This is an interesting idea. Note that you could get what you want with a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; custom runner.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; My concern with adding Rules via system properties that someone running<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; tests in their IDE would see different results compared to the test runs<br/>\n&gt; &gt; from Maven. Sure, you could tell your IDE to run the tests with the same<br/>\n&gt; &gt; system properties, but it would be unexpected for most people to have to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; take a special step to make the tests run the same way as they did in the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; continuous build.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Could you find some way to define the global rules via code? Perhaps you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; could add a DynamicRule to all of your tests that could apply the<br/>\n&gt; addition<br/>\n&gt; &gt; rules. Alternatively, you could have a class in the same package as the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; tests that defined the global rules for tests in that package (though I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; &gt; not sure there is a platform-independent way to scan all of the classes<br/>\n&gt; in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; a package that works for all runtime/deployment environments)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; -- Kevin<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; On Mon, Apr 29, 2013 at 7:09 AM, Henning Gro� &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:igaffai@...\">igaffai@...</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; **<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I have a use-case where I need to enable rules based on external<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; parameters.
