08 Mar 2010 19:58:14 -0000\r\n\r\n&gt; I started a new project to flesh out my ideas from the RT I posted last w=\r\neek that might fit this solution well. =C2=A0In essence, the project I\n\nOh,=\r\n interesting.\n\n&gt; gotten it to the place where it can run its own tests and =\r\nthe result events are processed in a separate thread.\n\n&gt; On a minor side no=\r\nte, when the bulk of your tests are short and do not involve a lot of objec=\r\nts, you can see as much as 100% speed gains. =C2=A0Essentially, by short I =\r\nmean less than a millisecond in duration. =C2=A0The speed gains are achieve=\r\nd by not penalizing the tests while you write to the console. =C2=A0In more=\r\n substantive tests you will not see as much of a speed gain.\n\nMicro-benchma=\r\nrking is tricky itself, no library is going to guarantee\ncommon sense here.=\r\n What you&#39;re talking about is really a bad benchmark\n-- if you include an o=\r\nperation with such a large time variance\n(writing to console), the results =\r\nwill have a high variance too, of\ncourse.\n\n&gt; Essentially the QoS testing fr=\r\namework will have some hooks to specify numbers of runs, parameters, etc. =\r\n=C2=A0My hope is that at the very\n\nThis library I posted does have some sor=\r\nt of this -- there are\nannotations that drive the benchmarking process (num=\r\nber of warmup\nruns, benchmarks runs, reset for the GC on every round, etc.)=\r\n.\n\n&gt; testing for benchmarks and quality of service is a little different fr=\r\nom regular unit testing.\n\nI believe it may be, don&#39;t know much about QoS.\n\n=\r\n\n&gt; Also note: for more accurate test timing, use the System.nanoTime(). =C2=\r\n=A0Most JVM implementations only increment the system clock every 10ms. =C2=\r\n=A0That=E2=80=99s fine enough for telling the time, but when your individua=\r\nl tests are typically faster than 10ms that lack of granularity can hurt.\n\n=\r\nIn fact they are both equally unreliable, so changing to theoretically\nsmal=\r\nler granularity is not really going to help. From our experience,\nyou need =\r\nto design a benchmark that takes a more significant amount of\ntime (in the =\r\norder of milliseconds at least) and make sure HotSpot has\ndone its job (and=\r\n no deoptimizations occur). In any other scenario\nbenchmark results will be=\r\n too close to noise and prone to large\nvariance distortions due to backgrou=\r\nnd processes and other activity.\n\nDawid\n\n",
