Then, in order to get green bar we wrapped<br/>\nthe test in a time bomb block:<br/>\n<br/>\nif (currentDate.isAfter(expirationDate)) {<br/>\n   ... run test ...<br/>\n}<br/>\n<br/>\nThe approach is feasible in the cases when you know a fix is supposed(!)<br/>\nto come at some appointed time.  One problem with this approach however,<br/>\nis that the test is not run unless you have passed the expiration<br/>\npoint.  At this time the system may have evolved to a point that the<br/>\ntest will need major recoding in order to work.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother solution I have used is to wrap the test in a FailableTest<br/>\nframework so that it always gets run but is reported elsewhere.  The<br/>\neasiest way to do this is to override runTest() and catch throwable. <br/>\nYou then need to come up with a way to report that the test failed.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHaving more than one feedback point can obviously lead to headaches, as<br/>\nit did in the team I was in, so we finally evolved that solution to<br/>\nextending the UI framework and adding a warning type of failure that<br/>\nturned the bar yellow.  That may require a lot more work than what you<br/>\nare up for if you are running in Eclipse.  The team I was on at the time<br/>\nscoped it out at about 20 - 30 man hours, b/c no one knew the Eclipse<br/>\nplugin environment.  The implementation in the vanilla-JUnit framework<br/>\nwas not very hard, so once you get past the SWT gotchas and the plugin<br/>\nframework of Eclipse, it may not be that tedious.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJason Rogers<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Where there is no vision, the people perish...&quot;<br/>\nBible, Proverbs 29:18 </span></blockquote></div>",
