Take Eclipse as an example: it<br/>\n&gt; chooses which test classes it wants to run with no help from the org.junit<br/>\n&gt; source code (by looking at its own internal model of the classpath), and<br/>\n&gt; then eventually asks JUnit to run them.  By the time any code I could add<br/>\n&gt; to JUnit would take effect, it would already be too late.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>OK, so I guess it would be up to the IDE developers to support the category<br/>\nselection in the GUI.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomething that would help me is if there was a way to define a suite by<br/>\npackage name. So I could say @Suite(package=&quot;foo&quot;) and the suite would then<br/>\nconsist of all tests in package &quot;foo&quot; and its &quot;subpackages&quot; (such as<br/>\nfoo.bar). Is this possible somehow?<br/>\n<br/>\n I generally just like to group my tests by packages but the current syntax<br/>\nseems to require me to manually keep a list of classes for each suite. If I<br/>\nadd or remove any test classes, I would need to update the suite. IntelliJ<br/>\nallows me to right-click on a package and run all tests in it like this.<br/>\nBut then it just runs all my tests and I don&#39;t have control over categories<br/>\netc. With a package level suite definition I could configure it in a<br/>\nseparate class as I like and not worry about updating it for new tests etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n Also, junit.org has been showing a 404 page for a few days at least. Is<br/>\nthat by intent? Was looking for some documentation on this.<br/>\n<br/>\nTeemu<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
