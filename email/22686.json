The first year I taught the course, I had to back up and do a session on version control. A significant number of the students (including some who had worked in industry) had never seen it. The fact that one can get through a CS degree too without using version control is less surprising, but still disappointing.<br/>\n<br/>\nS.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 6 May 2010, at 19:59, Loritsch, Berin C. wrote:<br/>\n&gt; I know this opens up a huge can of worms, but it is amazing to me what<br/>\n&gt; should be standard engineering practices are neither practiced nor<br/>\n&gt; understood.
