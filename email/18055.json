We should do that <br/>\nregularly, whether we practice TDD or not. I find that it&#39;s easier to do <br/>\nthat safely when there are more tests.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I was not talking about integration testing. But indeed I am thinking<br/>\n&gt; about testing at a higher level within the unit itself.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think you define &quot;integration testing&quot; differently than I do. Can you <br/>\ngive an example of this &quot;high-level unit test&quot; that is not an <br/>\nintegration test?<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
