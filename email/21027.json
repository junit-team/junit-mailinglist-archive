I guess the problem i had and perhaps other is that<br/>\nwhereas a theory is in fact a universal quantification (<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_quantification)\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_quantification)</a>. The problem is,<br/>\nwhile the set for each possible value is often indefinite, you have to be<br/>\nrealistic and provide appropriate candidate data (using data parameter<br/>\nsupplies). And that&#39;s when theories start to look a lot like parameterized<br/>\ntests, while in fact they are in nature very different .<br/>\n<br/>\nRaphael<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Thu, Oct 23, 2008 at 1:42 PM, Joakim Ohlrogge<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:joakim.ohlrogge@...\">joakim.ohlrogge@...</a>&gt;wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   &gt; Thanks for the clear responses. What i see is that a theory is a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; (parametrized) test inside out; you don&#39;t specify what will work but you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; leave out what should not be tested (iow assumptions by leaving out the<br/>\n&gt; data<br/>\n&gt; &gt; for these cases).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m not sure that there is a misunderstanding here but just to make sure:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; While what you wrote is technically true I think it simplifies the<br/>\n&gt; theory a bit. I would consider a long list of assumptions in a theory<br/>\n&gt; a smell, perhaps named: &quot;assmumptions is the mother of all screw ups&quot;<br/>\n&gt; :). I almost fell into the trap of using assumptions to filter the<br/>\n&gt; &quot;desired&quot; datapoints to the &quot;correct&quot; theory but that would be a<br/>\n&gt; violation of the idea, the idea is that the datapoints I have<br/>\n&gt; specified and all other datapoints I (or an automatic tool) can come<br/>\n&gt; up with should pass. I think that there is a subtle difference here<br/>\n&gt; between data driven tests and theories, data driven tests are merely a<br/>\n&gt; convenient way to create lots of specific examples while theories aim<br/>\n&gt; at the abstraction, the definition of the truth in this system.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If a lot of assumptions are a smell, then what are our weapons against<br/>\n&gt; them? I found that declaring types help here and it pays off<br/>\n&gt; instantly. For instance, if I represent name as a String and phone<br/>\n&gt; number as a String and it is important to my theories to differentiate<br/>\n&gt; between the two I could ether:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Assume that any string with numbers in it is a phone number and that<br/>\n&gt; anything that is not a phone number is a name.<br/>\n&gt; Or, I could declare the type Name and the type PhoneNumber.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In this case I would prefer a type.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If I was intersted in defining what a long distance call is I could<br/>\n&gt; write that as a theory:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; @Theory<br/>\n&gt; public void makeLongDistanceCall(PhoneNumber from, PhoneNumber to) {<br/>\n&gt; assumeThat(from.areaCode, is(not(equalTo(to.areaCode)));<br/>\n&gt; Call call = new Call(from, to);<br/>\n&gt; assertTrue(call.isLongDistance());<br/>\n&gt; }<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I probably screwed up both the domain and the design but I hope my<br/>\n&gt; idea of what an assumptions role in a theory is and how theories are<br/>\n&gt; different than data-driven tests in spite of them both being driven by<br/>\n&gt; data.<br/>\n&gt; I also hope that in the case the domain is screwed up it should be<br/>\n&gt; perfectly clear from the above theory to anyone who knows the domain.<br/>\n&gt; Finally, I hope this helps someone :)<br/>\n&gt; /J<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>-- <br/>\nRaphael Parree<br/>\nCTO<br/>\nSOA Evangelist<br/>\n<br/>\nTrivera Technologies Global J2EE Education, Mentoring, Courseware &<br/>\nConsulting Services<br/>\nphone:+31 152600 448<br/>\nphone +33 683 468663<br/>\nDisclaimer...<br/>\n&quot;The information contained in this message may be confidential and is<br/>\nintended to be exclusively for the addressee.
