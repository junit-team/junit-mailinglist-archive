Brief investigation revealed that it is due to the \nmetadata n=\r\not being properly updated to include the new versions [1], \nalthough 4.3 an=\r\nd 4.3.1 are hosted there.  This causes problems when \nusing maven ranges, a=\r\ns 4.2 is determined to be the newest.  Does the \nJUnit community handle dep=\r\nloyment, or should I look elsewhere?\n\nThanks,\nStephen Pack\n\n[1] http://repo=\r\n1.maven.org/maven2/junit/junit/maven-metadata.xml\n\n\n",
