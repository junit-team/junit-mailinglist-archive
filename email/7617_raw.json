Re-read the original post. The step he wants to\neliminate is writing the CSV file with every setup. That means he&#39;s already\nstoring the data in a class. Therefore he&#39;s reading the data when he reads\nthe class file, writing it to a file in setup, then reading it again in the\ntest.\n\nWriting the CSV file, even once, is the biggest inefficiency. By keeping the\ndata in memory he eliminates that step.\n\nHe could just keep a permanent test CSV file with his tests, but that&#39;s a\ndifferent discussion.\n\nTerry Wilcox\nterry.wilcox@...\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Levi Cook [mailto:levicook@...]\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, April 08, 2003 11:03 AM\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: Re: [junit] expensive setup which is definitely only required\n&gt; on ce\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m probably misunderstanding & need to revisit the original post...\n&gt; \n&gt; On Tuesday, April 8, 2003, at 09:24  AM, Terry Wilcox wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; The class laoder can worry about efficent loading of class files,\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m not worried about this ^^^ either...\n&gt; \n&gt; The (minor) issue I was commenting on is that loading data \n&gt; from a file \n&gt; or from a class (file) will involve spinning the disk.\n&gt; \n&gt; In the end, if your test provides the value _you_ expect from \n&gt; it, then \n&gt; spinning disks & data locations are completely moot points.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; This specific test case benefits from keeping the test data \n&gt; in memory.\n&gt; ^^^\n&gt; Needs to get read from disk one way or another, right?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; -- Levi\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
