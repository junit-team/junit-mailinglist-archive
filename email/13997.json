I want<br/>\n&gt; the developer of the test to state this. Maybe they could use a<br/>\n&gt; particular formatted comment, which I could parse and use to augment<br/>\n&gt; the results?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The method I come up with I may have to impose on other groups within<br/>\n&gt; this project, so I don&#39;t want it to be heavy handed, if possible.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks for any suggestions,<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I use custom Javadoc taglets <br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/tooldocs/javadoc/taglet/overview.html)\">http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/tooldocs/javadoc/taglet/overview.html)</a> <br/>\nto relate classes to external documentation.
