Running the tests on multiple<br/>\nmachines is probably overkill.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Gregory M.

Does JUnit support this, and if<br/>\nnot,<br/>\n&gt; would it be hard to add?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\nI am developing a tool called Joshua that facilitates the distributed<br/>\nexecution<br/>\nof test suites that adhere to the JUnit testing framework.  There is <br/>\ncurrently no public version of the tool.  However, I am working on a public <br/>\nversion that will utilize the newest versions of Jini, JavaSpaces, JNLP, and<br/>\n<br/>\nthe newest JUnit 3.6.  You can read a paper that I have published <br/>\nat the International Conference and Exposition on Testing Computer Software <br/>\n(TCS 2001) that discusses Joshua.  I was specifically addressing the issue<br/>\nof regression testing since my industry experience found the largest test<br/>\nsuites were created over time by this type of testing.  You can find more<br/>\ninformation at the following links:<br/>\n<br/>\nJoshua Main Site (developing, but still somewhat bare):<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://cs.allegheny.edu/~gkapfham/research/joshua/index.html\">http://cs.allegheny.edu/~gkapfham/research/joshua/index.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Automatically and Transparently Distributing the Execution of Regression<br/>\nTest Suites&quot; (among other papers):<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://cs.allegheny.edu/~gkapfham/research/publish/index.html\">http://cs.allegheny.edu/~gkapfham/research/publish/index.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is your schedule for needing a tool that supports the distributed <br/>\nexecution of test suites?  Would you be willing to contribute your<br/>\napplication <br/>\nand its tests for an empirical analysis that I am conducting?  Do you have <br/>\ndevelopers that are interested in contributing to the creation of Joshua?<br/>\n<br/>\n[Incidentally, I have not used the ActiveTestSuite, but from reading the<br/>\nJavaDoc, I can see that Joshua goes past what this class provides.  The tool<br/>\noffers the ability to execute the test suite on multiple machines instead of<br/>\njust multiple threads on the same machine.  However, the idea is<br/>\nconceptually<br/>\nthe same.  I think that distribution across multiple machines could yield<br/>\nmore cost effectiveness, depending on the computation/communication ratio<br/>\nthat<br/>\nyour test suites exhibit.]<br/>\n<br/>\ngreg<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nGregory M.
