If there is not a functional difference, then I don&#39;t know that you need all the tests - you&#39;ve obviously already ruled out any merges that start with xml2.  If there is a functional difference (say the content of each xml object is in someway different), and you are testing the handling of those differences, then I would write a test for every variation that you are trying to handle.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat being said, you might be able to do it in a parameterized way, to save the effort of writing the permutations, but then I&#39;m not sure how you document what you are trying to test,...I&#39;ve never done the parameterized approach, but have heard it offered up a few times here.<br/>\n<br/>\nmy two cents,<br/>\ngood luck,<br/>\nDianne<br/>\n<br/>\n -------------- Original message ----------------------<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Harshal Shah&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shahharshal@...\">shahharshal@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The question is more of implementation details but I was interested to know<br/>\n&gt; if there are API&#39;s or easy solution availables.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Here&#39;s the problem:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have 3 xml files (xml1,xml2,xml3). I am testing the merging of these xml<br/>\n&gt; files. The following could be possible<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; xml1-xml1<br/>\n&gt; xml1-xml2<br/>\n&gt; xml1-xml3<br/>\n&gt; xml3-xml1<br/>\n&gt; xml3-xml2<br/>\n&gt; xml3-xml3<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; One method is to write testMethods for all these combination.<br/>\n&gt; One more approach is just write two for loops which will do this for<br/>\n&gt; me.Theproblem with this approach is the method is just single. Due to<br/>\n&gt; this, what<br/>\n&gt; is happening is the JUnit report just shows a single success or failure.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I tried Anonymous Inner class approach but that did not work.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Can somebody point me to some different approach to just have all the<br/>\n&gt; results displayed using just a single mehtod or some solution like this?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -Thanks<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -- <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://shahharshal.blogspot.com/\">http://shahharshal.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
