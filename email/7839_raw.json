The\nreason I have for this is that even though you know that the method\nturns around and calls another method that is tested somewhere else,\nthat may not always be the case, and you don&#39;t know that the call is\ncoded correctly either, or that the underlying class/method hasn&#39;t been\nchanged to return something that is unexpected.  So even though you have\nan action called login/logoff that may turn right around and call\nlogin/logoff on another class that has been tested properly, I&#39;d at\nleast test that the call is accomplished appropriately and the results\nare correct.  \n \nIMHO Yes and no to more tests = better software.   You can create a\nbunch of tests that don&#39;t actually test anything (writing an object\ncreation test that asserts not null for example instead of testing that\nthe object is correct) that won&#39;t make better software.  However, more\nproper tests definitely improve your software maintenance and can catch\nerrors that only occur once in a blue moon.  That said, it&#39;s almost\nimpossible to test every condition, which is why when an error occurs\nthe first thing you do is write a test for it so you can be fairly sure\nit can&#39;t happen again. \n \nRobert Brown\nManager Software Engineering\nSinex Aviation Technologies\n \nWhat is the &quot;right&quot; amount of testing, is it best to do the same test\nbut\non different levels in order to make sure that NO strange behaviour is\ndiscovered or should I just test the whole flow?\n\nMore tests = better software? ;)\n \n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
