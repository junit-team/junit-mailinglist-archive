I have reviewed all of the \n&gt; junit and torque archives and have followed all of the advice, but there \n&gt; is not a change.\n\nAre you sure your Torque properties file is on the class path when you \nrun the tests from within Eclipse? Did you place the properties file in \none of your source folders? (That&#39;s usually the easiest approach, since \nEclipse copies them over to the build target folder as part of the build.)\n-- \nJ. B.
