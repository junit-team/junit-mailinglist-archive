    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-271066935\">Hi guys,<br/>\nfor our project me and a friend are using JUnit heavily. Our<br/>\napplication is a client that collects data and a backend that<br/>\norganizes and analyses it. Lately we have started to use JUnit tests<br/>\nto ensure that our database is sane, and these tests take quite a<br/>\nwhile. Now, I don&#39;t actually need to know that the database is still<br/>\nsane every time I recompile, so I&#39;d like to ignore them. But adding<br/>\nand removing @Ignore&#39;s will fill up our CVS repo quickly. Besides,<br/>\nI&#39;ve also set up a box to run tests from cron, and I&#39;d like to i.e. do<br/>\nmost tests every 15 minutes (gives me a nice little pop-up when<br/>\nsomething breaks) and only run the DB sanity every four hours. How can<br/>\nI make a testing schedule? Should I do this through ANT? Can I make a<br/>\nproperty-file for JUnit that checks if a certain time has elapsed? At<br/>\nthe moment my fileset is just &lt;include name=&quot;**/test/**/*.java&quot;/&gt;  I<br/>\nhope I don&#39;t have to make individual ant targets and list the files<br/>\nmanually! :-) What are my options?<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<br/>\n<br/>\n   Nik</div>",
