Given what I know about the code, I won&#39;t be any faster writing\n&gt; tests whether I write them all at once or as I need them. With that in\n&gt; mind, what would you like me to do? In the worst case, I need all the\n&gt; tests up front and end up writing them now anyway. It looks like you\n&gt; win.&quot; How does that sound, everyone?\n\nI think it&#39;s important to understand the value of test coverage as\nperceived by the person requesting those tests.  In other words, if you\nhad automatically-generated tests for all the code, how might that help\nyou?\n\nMike\n\n--\nMike Clark\nClarkware Consulting, Inc.\nhttp://www.clarkware.com\n720.851.2014\n\n\n\n",
