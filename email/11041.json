I primarily use public/package-level(default)/private access to<br/>\ncommunicate which other classes should be calling this method. (And<br/>\nprotected is a whole different ball of wax.)  If you&#39;re doing open- or<br/>\nblack-box testing, then this works pretty well for providing the right<br/>\nlevel of access to your test methods.  (Well, even that&#39;s not true. <br/>\nYou can lay out your package structure to work well with<br/>\npackage-level/private distinctions, or public/private distinctions,<br/>\nbut not both.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI encounter situations, particularly ones that have heavy<br/>\nalgorithmics, where the class only exposes certain methods, but one or<br/>\nmore of those methods could benefit from being decomposed for testing<br/>\npurposes.  Usually, there is decomposition of the algorithm in the<br/>\nproduction class. Sometimes, I simply expose what might be thought of<br/>\nas private details. Sometimes, I can think of a better way to<br/>\nstructure the problem, and am not worried about exposing the<br/>\ninternals.  But sometimes, I really don&#39;t want to expose the internals<br/>\nto other production classes, but still want to be able to get at those<br/>\npoints for testing.<br/>\n<br/>\nEric</div>",
