For example, for &#39;A&#39; you don&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; even need to issue the query. Just write tests that verify the SQL. <br/>\n&gt; Mock objects help here.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My approach would be to encapsulate the SQL generation into a separate<br/>\nmethod that can be called by the test.  Then construct the object as<br/>\nrequired, and ask for the SQL.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; For &#39;B&#39; and &#39;C&#39; You might also try using a database that has a small,<br/>\n&gt; known subset of data in it so you don&#39;t need to process as much, or use<br/>\n&gt; a mock database.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>&#39;B&#39; could be tested by mocking the db, and verifying that it is<br/>\ngetting the correct queries.<br/>\n<br/>\n&#39;C&#39; could be done by encapsulating the mapper and passing it a<br/>\nmock/fake resultset.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; In #2 again, it appears that the primary concern of the tests may be<br/>\n&gt; validating the SQL that is generated and not what is returned by the<br/>\n&gt; call, but I could be wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I agree.  It sounds like a series of &quot;given this VO, verify the<br/>\nresulting where clause&quot;.  As above, you could put the where clasue<br/>\ngeneration in a separate method that could be called from the test.<br/>\n<br/>\nDave</div>",
