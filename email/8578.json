It<br/>\n&gt;is never, ever, a bad idea to document.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I love you like a brother, but this last statement is a howler.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a large company setting, you may find it useful to provide high-level documentation, such as a roadmap to the system or a description of its metaphor; however, it is *always* a bad idea to document if no-one is reading the documentation. If you don&#39;t know who your audience is and you don&#39;t have proof that such an audience even exists, then producing documentation for that fictitious or non-existent audience is generally a waste of time and energy. One exception: if you benefit the act of writing documentation, and if that benefit is not as easy to come by another way, then do document whatever you need to document.<br/>\n<br/>\nA top time-waster on software projects is writing useless documentation instead of clear code.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care.<br/>\n<br/>\nPS: Yes, I&#39;ve worked on a project where no external documentation was required. When a new employee came on board and began working with the code, he said, &quot;This code is so easy to read, I already understand what&#39;s going on.&quot; Since I also benefitted from the easy-to-read code while I was building the system, the effort I put into making the code self-documenting was well worth it. In other words, if the code tells the story, then that is often enough.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJ. B.
