    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1869724894\">Hi -<br/>\nlast week (on Wednesday, to be precise), I wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The reason I jumped to the mailing list is that 2 of us want to write a<br/>\n&gt; doclet *a few hours from now*, and we want to do TDD ... maybe someone<br/>\n </span></blockquote>here<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; is kind enough to shoot a quick answer at me ...]<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>- and we did it! (we had to - it&#39;s a really needed tool)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I&#39;m not satisfied with the result and the TDD-ing we did ... But before<br/>\nI share my questions and concerns, I&#39;d like to see how TDDing our assignment<br/>\nwould or should really work. For this, <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I invite you to also implement the tool we had to write. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>For this, I have put a sort of spec on my website at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.haraldmmueller.de/swe_tdd1.html.\">http://www.haraldmmueller.de/swe_tdd1.html.</a> <br/>\n<br/>\nIt took us 2 hours 16 minutes end-to-end (including the shaky acceptance<br/>\ntest on the website), and we were as unknowing about doclets as one can be -<br/>\nso you have every chance to do the same thing in an hour or so.<br/>\n<br/>\nEveryone sending me (or posting) a &quot;TDD solution&quot; (including unit tests)<br/>\nwill get in return our code ... if you like to criticize others&#39; code, that<br/>\nshould really be an incentive ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I have two working solutions, I&#39;ll post - if I may - our code (maybe on<br/>\nthe refactoring mailing list? don&#39;t know where it suites better) so that you<br/>\ncan tear it apart.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs this a deal ;-) ?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJB (Joe - now I know it!) Rainsberger found time to answer - I&#39;ll only<br/>\ncomment on one part:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Now fortunately, RootDoc is an interface, so we ought to be able to mock <br/>\n&gt;it, or provide a simple implementation of it, to pass in to the method <br/>\n&gt;start(), which I /assume/ you&#39;re trying to test-drive.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>&quot;Yes, but ...&quot; (my children&#39;s answer to almost everything ...): If you look<br/>\nat the documentation of RootDoc and related interfaces - i.e., the javadoc<br/>\nAPI -, it&#39;s not too small. Should I really mock this? I cannot see that I&#39;ll<br/>\nthen create a software that will run with the real javadoc API - I will<br/>\nmisinterpret the Javadoc and implement mocks that do what I think they<br/>\nshould do, not what the real thing does.<br/>\nSo, I need learning tests for RootDoc etc. anyway, so why not write the<br/>\ndoclet so that *is* the learning test object?<br/>\nBut when I find time, I&#39;ll try also the mock approach - otherwise, I&#39;ll<br/>\nnever lose my prejudice about it; and post the result without any feeling of<br/>\nguilt.<br/>\n<br/>\nOk - now I&#39;m waiting for contributions ...<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards<br/>\nHarald M.
