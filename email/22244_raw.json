The producer is always run\n before the=\r\n consumer. When the producer fails, the consumer is skipped. We\n picked the=\r\n names producer and consumer because the producer may actually\n *return* a =\r\nvalue (ie produce a valid example of the class under test) and the\n consume=\r\nr may take the value as a parameter (ie consumer the produced example).\n If=\r\n two consumers depend on the same example, the JExample runner takes care t=\r\no\n clone the example to avoid side-effects.\n\nThe website is http://scg.unib=\r\ne.ch/jexample \n\nFeedback and bug reports are welcome.\n\nPS, we also have a p=\r\nrototype that uses profiling to automatically insert the\n implicit dependen=\r\ncies of legacy tests. If you are interested, drop a mail.\n\n&gt; Are the test c=\r\nases added with annotation @Test gets executed in the order\n&gt; they are writ=\r\nten?\n\nThe order is unspecified.\n\ncheers,\nAA\n\n\n",
