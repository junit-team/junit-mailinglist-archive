My example program is an interface to Tokyo Tyrant (a simple key/value st=\r\nore), so it isn&#39;t as &quot;business-y&quot; as the example you requested, but it does=\r\n go through the whole TDD process, at least the way I do it.\n\nThe series wi=\r\nll be four half-hour episodes. You can see the first ten minutes of the raw=\r\n footage of the first two episodes at http://vimeo.com/user3553347/videos. =\r\nI&#39;ll be sure to post here when the series is released.\n\nThat said, I think =\r\nthere is scope for many more specialized demonstrations of TDD. I hope lots=\r\n of folks jump in with their favorite IDE, application, language, and/or te=\r\nchnique.\n\nRegards,\n\nKent\n\nOn May 17, 2010, at 11:33 AM, amalcamel wrote:\n\n&gt;=\r\n Hi, I am new to this forum and new to JUnit. I started searching for best =\r\npractices and found that people were asking that question all the way back =\r\nin 2001! Kind of intimidating!\n&gt; \n&gt; Anyway, what I am looking for is not &quot;b=\r\nest practices&quot;, per se, but a real world example. And from that I mean an e=\r\nxample that starts from an idea in someone&#39;s head and evolves all the way t=\r\nhrough application completion and testing coverage. For example, I am think=\r\ning of an auto insurance type of application that has certain requirements,=\r\n say 10, and how the tests are derived from the requirements and the code g=\r\nets derived from the tests. \n&gt; \n&gt; We have many developers that are new to T=\r\nest Driven Development, and to simply come out with best practices and ask =\r\nthem to get on board will never work. However, if we can take a real world =\r\nexample, from start to finish, and show how the tests did drive the code an=\r\nd how refactoring became so much simpler as a result, that would be a great=\r\n start into changing the mentality of some of our developers (myself includ=\r\ned ;-)\n&gt; \n&gt; Any suggestions?\n&gt; Thank you,\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Elaine\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n[Non=\r\n-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
