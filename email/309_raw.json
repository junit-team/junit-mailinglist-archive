If you catch AssertionFailedException in your\ntests you&#39;ll always get a green light!  \n\nNevertheless you are right to want to protect your users from failed\nassertions.  I would argue that you do this by not including any JUnit code\nin your deployment to the live environment.  Test cases & suites should be\nseparate bits of code.  I&#39;m working with Oracle JDeveloper (I must have been\nvery bad in a previous existence) and that has a Jar tool that allows you to\nexclude individual classes from a package.  I assume most other IDEs other\nsomething similar.\n\n(2)  Exceptions thrown by a failure in the code should be trapped.  That&#39;s\nobvious.  The question is whether they should be checked exceptions or not.\nChecked exceptions have to be caught but you don&#39;t have to do anything with\nthem.  This code:\n\ttry {\n\t\tdoSomeMethod();\n\t}\t\n\tcatch (Exception e) {}\n&quot;handles&quot; any checked exception thrown by doSomeMethod() but doesn&#39;t\nactually do anything with it.  \n\nI wrote a ExceptionHandler to generically handle exceptions (retrieve and\nformat meaningful error messages from database table, log serious errors,\netc.).  The problem is propagation: if you are throwing exceptions upwards\nyou can&#39;t have an error handler using checked exceptions otherwise you end\nup coding:\n\ttry {\n\t\tdoSomeMethod();\n\t}\t\n\tcatch (Exception e) {\n\t\ttry {\n\t\t\tdoErrorHandling(e);\n\t\t}\n\t\tcatch (PropagatedException pe) {\n\t\t}\t\n\n\t}\nand you&#39;re no better off!  That&#39;s why I sub-classed PropagatedException from\nRuntimeException.\n\nIMHO &quot;Programming By Contact&quot; is a cool idea but a pain to implement;\nconsequently unless there are adequate quality procedures in place\ndevelopers will circumvent checked exceptions whenever that&#39;s the easiest\noption (if my own behaviour is any yardstick).  If you&#39;re working in a\ncomponent-building shop by all means throw lots of bespoke exceptions.  Just\ndon&#39;t be under any illusions that the developers will do anything meaningful\nwith them  The catch(Exception e) {} compiles and at least the user is\npresented with an ugly error stack but the code *still doesn&#39;t work*\n\nregards, APC\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: tony.heap@...
