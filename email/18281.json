From the sounds of your initial<br/>\npost, it sounds that possibly you intend to write many tests at once<br/>\n[&quot;..code the skeleton..with the methods..then write the tests..&quot;].  There is<br/>\na fundamental rule of TDD to write one and only one failing test at a time<br/>\nand make that pass before moving on to the next test.  This is important<br/>\nbecause it will encourage you to constantly refactor, enabling your brain to<br/>\nevolve a much cleaner overall design as you go.  In addition, this tends to<br/>\nmake the task of &quot;getting the test to compile&quot; much less tedious, as you<br/>\nwill need to add at the very most only a single class and a single method.<br/>\nHope that helps.<br/>\n  -- MB<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 10/30/06, J.

I guess<br/>\n&gt; &gt; you could code in all the skeleton of the class, with the methods &<br/>\n&gt; &gt; such (though this won&#39;t compile unless you really do return what you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; say you will), then write the tests, then add the rest of the code.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; But I don&#39;t see the great advantage of that, to be honest...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I write the test, then use Eclipse to generate classes, interfaces and<br/>\n&gt; method stubs as I go. When the test compiles, I run it to watch it fail.<br/>\n&gt; This way I know my test actually tests /something/. Only then do I make<br/>\n&gt; it pass.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; When I do this, I get the opportunity to see my code in black and white<br/>\n&gt; on the screen. I get to ask myself, &quot;Is the design any good?&quot; or more<br/>\n&gt; correctly, &quot;Does the design suck in an obvious way?&quot; I&#39;m surprised how<br/>\n&gt; often it does. :) It&#39;s often not until I have to /use/ the API that I<br/>\n&gt; realize it sucks.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So that&#39;s how I do it. I tried writing the skeleton code, then writing<br/>\n&gt; the test, but I found I couldn&#39;t easily enough track in my head the code<br/>\n&gt; I needed for the test I wanted to write, so I decided to let the test<br/>\n&gt; pull the code out of me. It works for me.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Take care.<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; J. B.
