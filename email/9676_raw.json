I think \n&gt; what is happening is that assert equals uses &quot;...&quot; for equal parts \n&gt; of the expected and actual values.  So in your example, &quot;&lt;... ...&gt; \n&gt; but was &lt;......&gt;&quot; means that there was not a space where it expected\n&gt; one to be.\n&gt; \n&gt; assertEquals(&quot;foobar&quot;, &quot;abc&quot;, &quot;abc123&quot;) would print:\n&gt; Foobar expected: &lt;...&gt; but was &lt;...123&gt;\n\nYes, That&#39;s correct.  Personally, I&#39;d like this behaviour to kick in\nwhen the strings are long... say over 12 characters.  I&#39;d also like\nthem to give adequate context...  maybe 2 or 3 characters on each side\nof the difference as possible.\n\n&gt; If you don&#39;t like this behavior you can always implement your own\n&gt; version of assertEquals.\n\nYes, you can alwasy make a subclass of TestCase to put your own\nassertion methods and have your test classes extend that.\n\nIn this case, it isn&#39;t assertEquals(String, String, String) that is\nthe culprit.  It&#39;s ComparisonFailure.getMessage().\n\nDave\n\n\n",
