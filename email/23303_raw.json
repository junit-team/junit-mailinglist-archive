I have mostly been using\n&gt; ScalaTest and Midje. Today I felt that usin=\r\ng JUnit with scala might\n&gt; not be the worst idea. I feel that the scala too=\r\nls are lacking in...\n&gt; inderstanding of the TDD/BDD approach (which is just=\r\n a feeling). Long\n&gt; story short, I want to do something like scalaTests pen=\r\ndingUntliFixed\n&gt; which basically makrs a failing test as ignored until it s=\r\ntops failing\n&gt; where pendingUntilFixed will start failing the test saying t=\r\nhat &quot;test\n&gt; was marked as pending but did not throw an exception&quot; =A0(so th=\r\nat you\n&gt; will not accidentally leave pendingUntilFixed in for code tests th=\r\nat\n&gt; work.\n&gt;\n&gt; I realized that this is very easy to do in JUnit from scala.=\r\n Something\n&gt; like this:\n&gt;\n&gt; =A0def pendingUntilFixed(body: =3D&gt; Unit) =3D {=\r\n\n&gt; =A0 =A0(try {\n&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0body\n&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0false\n&gt; =A0 =A0}\n&gt; =A0 =A0c=\r\natch {\n&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0case e:Throwable =3D&gt; true\n&gt; =A0 =A0}) match {\n&gt; =A0 =\r\n=A0 =A0case false =3D&gt; error(&quot;Test was marked as pending but did not fail&quot;)=\r\n\n&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0case true =3D&gt; ()\n&gt; =A0 =A0}\n&gt; =A0}\n&gt;\n&gt; =A0@Test\n&gt; =A0def som=\r\neFailingTest =3D pendingUntilFixed {\n&gt; =A0 =A0assertThat(true, is(false))\n&gt;=\r\n =A0}\n&gt;\n&gt; =A0@Test\n&gt; =A0def someFixedTest =3D pendingUntilFixed {\n&gt; =A0 =A0=\r\nassertThat(true, is(true))\n&gt; =A0}\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; The problem is that pending tests a=\r\nre marked as succeding when they\n&gt; fail. It would be cool if I could someho=\r\nw mark them as Ignored\n&gt; instead. Is there some exception I could throe tha=\r\nt would accomplish\n&gt; this? I sort of thought that AssmptionError would be l=\r\nogical to be\n&gt; displayed as ignored instead of succeeding hence the title.\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; Ideas?\n&gt; -----------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Joakim=\r\n Ohlrogge\n&gt; Agical AB\n&gt; V=E4sterl=E5nggatan 79, 2 tr\n&gt; 111 29 Stockholm, SW=\r\nEDEN\n&gt;\n&gt; Mobile: +46-708-754004\n&gt; Blog: johlrogge.wordpress.com\n&gt; E-mail: j=\r\noakim.ohlrogge@...\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yah=\r\noo!
