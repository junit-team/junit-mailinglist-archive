I&#39;ve reviewed many of the messages \nin this archive and in the extreme progrogramming group archive.  I \nhaven&#39;t been able to find any Testing Standards besides those \ncompiled in the &quot;JUnit Best Practices&quot; article.  Are there any \nstandards for validation or any general standards that anyone has \nincorporated in their own projects?  The thought behind this is by \nalligning everyone into some basic testing standards we can document \nthe process and use it as a requirements doc.\n\n\n",
