We used Coverlipse first. I liked the user interface (you initiate\ncoverage measurement with a new kind of launch configuration), but the\nresults weren&#39;t accurate. We set breakpoints on lines that the tool claimed\nweren&#39;t covered and execution stopped there. We also tried Clover, which has\na slightly less natural interface (you set an &quot;enable Clover&quot; flag on the\nproject properties). The results, however, seemed much more accurate. \n\nThe result of our testing was that we found two methods out of JUnit 4 that\nwe felt needed tests. Our overall coverage is 68%, and it seems like it\nwould be easy to get it up to 80%. However, the only functional code that\nreally needed more tests were those two methods.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nKent Beck\nThree Rivers Institute\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On \n&gt; Behalf Of Thomas L Roche\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, September 01, 2005 5:28 PM\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: [junit] [OT] coverage plugins for eclipse?\n&gt; \n&gt; Apologies if this is OT, but IMHO coverage measurement (for guiding\n&gt; one&#39;s test writing) and IDEs (for writing and running one&#39;s tests) are\n&gt; both at least tangentially related to JUnit ... and I don&#39;t know of a\n&gt; good list for coverage measurement :-(\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m wondering, what are folks who use Eclipse (or Eclipse-based\n&gt; products) using to do coverage measurement and reporting? One option\n&gt; is to just run the coverage tool from the command line or ant, but I&#39;d\n&gt; really like something more integrated, e.g.\n&gt; \n&gt; 0 a run config that would Run&gt;{JUnit, JUnit Plug-in Test} under the\n&gt;   coverage tool and display results in a view\n&gt; \n&gt; 1 mark un/covered sources in Outline view or editors\n&gt; \n&gt; The coverage plugins of which I&#39;m aware are\n&gt; \n&gt; * Clover\n&gt; \n&gt; * jcoverage\n&gt; \n&gt; * Rational Developer (Unfortunately its coverage tools are part of its\n&gt;   performance-testing tools, which complicates installation and use\n&gt;   for &quot;normal&quot; testing.)\n&gt; \n&gt; Are there others?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
