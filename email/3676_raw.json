We intended the book to work\nexactly as you describe--giving readers a guide to some useful tools, and\nthus giving them an incentive to start using said tools.

It looks good.  I am going to\nrecommend to the QA team and engineers at Macromedia.\n\nI&#39;m pretty well beyond the book&#39;s coverage on JUnit and Ant, so those\nsections weren&#39;t of interest to me, but what was interesting was the\ncoverage of JMeter, JUnitPerf, HttpUnit, and Cactus.  Sometimes it will be\nmuch faster for folks to use a book like this to get up to speed on those\ntools than if they were left to figure them our for themselves (which many\nwill never bother to even try).\n\nThe best thing about it just from browsing it for a few minutes was that I\nlearned that JMeter has grown up quite a bit since I last checked it out\nover a year ago.\n\nScott Stirling\nJRun QA\nMacromedia\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Nicholas Lesiecki\n\nGosh, this is the second time I&#39;ve made a post to a mailing list and\nforgotten to include some important detail!
