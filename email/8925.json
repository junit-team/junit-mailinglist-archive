I&#39;m not saying I&#39;m right, this is just<br/>\nwhat a quick look showed me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess there is a constant tussle between a pure framework and use case,<br/>\nbut this feels like some sort of software evolution to me. I used to use<br/>\nsuites, I used to use the Swing Runner, but now I use Eclipse and I&#39;ll never<br/>\ngo back. When does the new user case become the norm?
