So to me it looks ready for release.\n \n One thing that was slightly\n annoying is that instead of removing\n org.junit.internal.AssumptionViolatedException, you&#39;ve\n deprecated and duplicated it into\n org.junit.AssumptionViolatedException. This caused me some\n headache as we had code catching the former class type and\n suddenly it looked like assumptions had stopped working\n until I realized I had to change the import statement. For\n the future, I&#39;d prefer that you just remove the original\n class as then we&#39;ll get a compiler error instead of\n runtime failures.\n \n \n \n \n Thanks for the feedback,\n Chris\n Could you give\n us an example of the code that was broken by our\n introduction of an external AssumptionViolatedException? The\n new external one is a subclass of the internal one, so the\n thinking was any code outside of JUnit that tried to catch\n the internal AssumptionViolatedException would still catch\n exceptions thrown by Assume. Was your code specifically\n throwing the internal AssumptionViolatedException? I thought\n we handled that as well.\n \n \n \n I would be very interested\n in knowing more details.\n -- Kevin\n \n \n-----\n(yahoo seems to mangle my reply, sorry for bad formatting)\nHi,\n\nto some extent, I think it was the fault of our code using it, which seems overly restrictive:\nif (&lt;something&gt; && exception.getClass().equals(org.junit.internal.AssumptionViolatedException.class))\n\nI never checked when is actually thrown, but if it is the internal one that gets here, then of course that statement is too restrictive. I don&#39;t know if there was some reason for doing it that way or not, though. Easy to work around, though ;)\nWe were also throwing the &quot;internal exception&quot; in some of our unit tests so I changed those to the external one, but I don&#39;t know if that gave me any problems or not.\n     \nBy the way, the removal of &quot;exit()&quot; from JUnitSystem was a bit annoying as I ended having to copy in MainRunner (from your tests) into our project as we&#39;re also testing some System.exit conditions. I can see why it is nicer to remove a test-only API from the source part, but when the cost is 290 lines of MainRunner to save JUnitSystem subclasses from writing a 3-line method, then I&#39;m not so sure it is a gain. But I can live with it.\n\n\n",
