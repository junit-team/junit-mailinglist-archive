That is something I never=\r\n liked wrt JExample: dependencies are\n limited to hardwired declarations in=\r\n the code.\n\nMy concern with the theories of JUnit 4.4  is that they introdu=\r\nce two    \n abstractions, @DataPoint and @Theory, and that none of these tw=\r\no abstractions\n returns reusable instances of the class under tests. To spe=\r\nak in JExample\n lingo you got pure producers and pure consumers only (with =\r\nmore flexible\n links between both though!) As a consequence, theories are l=\r\nimited to\n dependency hierarchies of two levels only, while JExample can be=\r\n used to\n express dependency graphs of any depth. \n\n(Furthermore, of the tw=\r\no abstractions only theories are tests, so we cannot\n assert the validity o=\r\nf data points before returning them. This should be\n fairly simple to solve=\r\n though.)\n\nImagine that @Theory were able to return reusable instances of t=\r\nhe class under\n tests, then @DataPoint would become a theory without input.=\r\n Then we could\n rewrite our working example as \n\n  @RunWith(Examples.class)=\r\n\n  public class ExampleStack {\n    @Example public Stack empty() { \n      S=\r\ntack s =3D new Stack();\n      assertEquals(true, s.isEmpty());\n      return=\r\n s;\n    }\n    @Example public Object FOO =3D &quot;Foo&quot;;\n    @Example public Obj=\r\nect BAR =3D &quot;Bar&quot;;\n    @Example public Stack shouldPushItemToTheTop(Stack s=\r\n, Object item) {\n      s.push(item);\n      assertEquals(false, s.isEmpty())=\r\n;\n      assertEquals(item, s.top());\n      assertEquals(false, s.isEmpty())=\r\n;\n      return s;\n    }\n    @Example public Stack shouldPopPushedItem(Stack=\r\n s, Object item) {\n      assumeFalse(s.isEmpty());\n      stack.push(item);\n=\r\n      assertEquals(item, s.pop());\n      return s;\n    }\n    @Example publi=\r\nc Stack shouldPopTopItem(Stack s) {\n      assumeFalse(s.isEmpty());\n      O=\r\nbject item =3D s.top();\n      assertEquals(item, s.pop());\n      return s;\n=\r\n    }\n  }\n\nRunning this will start without available input and thus run all=\r\n theories\n (above called @Example so users dont attempt to run this code in=\r\n JUnit)  \n without input, once inputs are available we can run turn by turn=\r\n all theories\n on all input. In fact, what we got now is a grammar for the =\r\ncreation of valid\n instances of the class under test.\n\nHowever, since the n=\r\number of valid stack instances is infinite (as is the case\n for any non-tri=\r\nvial class) we have to stop somewhere if the test shall not\n run forever. \n=\r\n\nWhat I&#39;d like to emphasize is that JExample is not about dependencies only=\r\n,\n its other major focus is *composable tests*. When writing tests (or\n exp=\r\nerimenting on a REPL, alas we have none in Java...) you should be able to\n =\r\njust say &quot;gimme a valid instance of a stack with 3 elements&quot; and the\n frame=\r\nwork goes and creates one for you. So the above example is maybe even\n clos=\r\ner to my initial vision of JExample than what we have now. Using an\n assump=\r\ntions to express that condition seems more flexile, whereas in JExample\n yo=\r\nu would need to depend by name on another test that explicitly creates an\n =\r\nelements with three instances. So that seems to confirm your &quot;assumption\n s=\r\nufficiency&quot; hypothesis, given there were composable theories.\n\nPersonally I=\r\n do not consider dependencies the major contribution of JExample\n (even tho=\r\nugh it is a nice selling point) but *composable tests* thanks to\n return va=\r\nlues. The very idea that tests produce valid instances of the class\n under =\r\ntests and that these instances should be reused by other tests. (Which\n of =\r\ncourse opens up the Pandora&#39;s box of having to clone examples to avoid\n qua=\r\ndratic runtime and side-effects.)\n\ncheers,\nAA\n\n\n",
