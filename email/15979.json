It is true, but these<br/>\n&gt; are the sort of errors that raraly occur anyhow and are usually trivial to<br/>\n&gt; notice, find and fix (if you have tests). And static typing makes you pay a<br/>\n&gt; high price for preventing these trivial errors - it&#39;s not just the type<br/>\n&gt; declarations for the vars, the impact goes a lot deeper.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   As a comment to doing refactoring w/out static typing: having done some<br/>\n&gt; fairly big refactorings in a program written in Ruby I can say it wasn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; that hard - as I had the tests. If I didn&#39;t have the tests it would have<br/>\n&gt; been more difficult.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t want to stray off topic too much, but I&#39;d like to make two quick<br/>\npoints in favor of static typing:<br/>\n<br/>\n   - The value is not so much about robustness (I agree that mis-casts<br/>\n   are rare) but about documentation.  I do a lot of code reviews every day and<br/>\n   I can tell you that reviewing Python or Ruby is an order of magnitude harder<br/>\n   than reviewing Java because I can never tell what types are expected from<br/>\n   method signatures.<br/>\n<br/>\n   - Refactoring in dynamically typed languages is inherently unsafe.<br/>\n   You can&#39;t even rename a method reliably.  I&#39;m glad it worked for you, but<br/>\n   you need to keep in mind that renaming in a dynamically typed language is<br/>\n   nothing more than a string replace.  Use with caution.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nCédric<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
