That makes it possib=\r\nle, in theory :), to generate data for\ntheories and find holes in them (par=\r\nameters where they don&#39;t pass).\n\nA theory could be something like:\n\n@Theory=\r\n\npublic void sortingAlgoritmsProduceResultsOfTheSameLengthAsTheInput(Sortin=\r\ngAlgorithm\nalgorithm, List input) {\n  assertThat(algorithm.sort(input).leng=\r\nth(), is(input.length));\n}\n\nRegardless which sorting algorithm you use and =\r\nwhich input you throw\nat it the result should have the same length as the i=\r\nnput.\n\nParameterized tests make no such claim. They will pass for the data\n=\r\nthat is setup in the test but may or may not fail with other data.\n\nWhether=\r\n parameterized tests will stay or go... I don&#39;t know.\n\nHope this helps\n/J\n\n=\r\nOn Fri, Oct 17, 2008 at 5:34 PM, jwirth &lt;rparree@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m =\r\nalso &quot;struggling&quot; with this.
