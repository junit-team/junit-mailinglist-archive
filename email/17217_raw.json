They have produced something they call\n&quot;Mobile=\r\n JUnit&quot; and they have made it available for download here:\nhttp://developer=\r\n.sonyericsson.com/site/global/docstools/java/p_java.jsp\n\n  The problem is, =\r\nthe file is a Windows .exe contained in a .zip. \nThat&#39;s no good to me on Li=\r\nnux.  Aren&#39;t they contravening the open\nsource license of JUnit by producin=\r\ng their own extension and not\nmaking the source code available?\n\n  Your com=\r\nments would be greatly appreciated :-)\n\n  Kind regards.\n\n  Jim.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
