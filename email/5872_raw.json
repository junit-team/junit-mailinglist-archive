After \nsearching thru documentation, this news group and other sources, some \nissues still remain that I hope some of you can help answer.\n\n    1. We have a need to put some trace messages in the tests so as \nto know the progress of the test itself because each test can be \nfairly timeconsuming. Is there a way to have these capture this \noutput for an individual test in the GUI-based TestRunner? I see only \nthing that is captured for each test on the UI are the assertion \nfailures. \n \n    2. I see that JUnitReport is used quite extensively with Ant. \nFrom what I learnt reading, it helps output TestResult in XML format \nand then one can translate it using XSLT. Know how one can use that \nwithout having to use Ant? Any resources on Net would be helpful.\n\n   3. I see JUnit is great for nesting sub-suites within a suite and \nthereby creating a tree of suites. But when it comes to test results, \nis there a way to get a breakup of which sub-suite had how many \nfailures from TestResult?\n\n\nThanks in advance,\nVern\n\n   \n\n\n\n",
