There are those who seemingly are smart enough to subscribe\nto the=\r\n mailing list, yet not wise enough to perform some simple search\nengine sea=\r\nrching.\n\nThe best manner of dealing with them that I have seen, is to gentl=\r\ny\nwelcome them to the world of JUnit, suggest that they start by reading\nth=\r\ne resources available at junit.org and that they then follow that up\nwith r=\r\neading one of the fine books available at their local or\nInternet book stor=\r\ne. And it never hurts to mention ESR&#39;s Smart\nQuestions essay.\n\nThat does ta=\r\nke a few minutes, but it&#39;s the nicest way to deal with\nthat sort of person =\r\nthat I&#39;ve seen. This list is very friendly and\nhelpful and populated by som=\r\ne fine people, so the last thing we want\nto do is to seem judgemental or ru=\r\nde. Products are judged by their\nmailing list. Think of Perl, a scripting l=\r\nanguage that is many orders\nof magnitude more difficult to learn than JUnit=\r\n, but it&#39;s mailing\nlists are reputed for their friendliness. We should be t=\r\nhe same way.\nStudy how J.B. and some of the others deal with the beginner/u=\r\nnwise\nquestions that come through the list.\n\nOh, and remember back to when =\r\nyou were confused and asking questions.\nI try to keep learning new things s=\r\no I have no problem remembering\nback to a day when I didn&#39;t &quot;just know&quot; the=\r\n answer. You should see\nsome of the stupid questions that I&#39;ve asked over a=\r\nt the Groovy\nmailing list! But they are very kind and patient over there. W=\r\ne\nare/should remain that way over here. :-)\n\nSimon\n\n--\nwww.simonpeter.com\n\n=\r\nOn 9/21/05, David Jackman &lt;david.jackman@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Unfortuna=\r\ntely, I think the people who send a question without looking in\n&gt; the FAQ o=\r\nr doing a simple Google search are also those people who would\n&gt; send the q=\r\nuestion to both the simple and advanced group in hopes of\n&gt; getting a faste=\r\nr response.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ________________________________\n&gt;\n&gt; From: junit@yahoogro=\r\nups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of\n&gt; Bradley, Todd\n&gt; Sent:=\r\n Wednesday, September 21, 2005 11:23 AM\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subje=\r\nct: [junit] splitting this list\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi, I&#39;d like to propose a controversi=\r\nal topic, which is to somehow split\n&gt; up the JUnit email list into two list=\r\ns - one for beginners and one for\n&gt; intermediate-to-advanced users.  I cher=\r\nish the discussion on this list\n&gt; about meaty topics of unit testing and us=\r\ning and extending JUnit.  There\n&gt; are some very smart people here!\n&gt;\n&gt; Howe=\r\nver, I frankly have reached the limit of my tolerance for stupid\n&gt; question=\r\ns in this list.  And by &quot;stupid questions&quot; I mean the opposite\n&gt; of Eric Ra=\r\nymond&#39;s &quot;smart questions&quot;\n&gt; (http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.=\r\nhtml).  There seems to be\n&gt; no end to the steady stream of new members who =\r\nsign on and immediately\n&gt; ask a question that&#39;s already answered in the JUn=\r\nit FAQ, which every new\n&gt; member automatically receives.  I know hitting th=\r\ne delete key 5 or 10\n&gt; times a day isn&#39;t a huge deal, so I guess it&#39;s just =\r\nthe principle of it\n&gt; all.  I consider it rude for people to not have the c=\r\nourtesy to at least\n&gt; make an effort to help themselves.\n&gt;\n&gt; But I thought =\r\nthat rather than just unsubscribing from the list, I&#39;d\n&gt; toss this message =\r\nout to see if anyone else is in the same boat as me.\n&gt; There are supposedly=\r\n over 6000 subscribers, which sure sounds like a big\n&gt; enough population to=\r\n allow some specialization.  Alternatively, if\n&gt; dividing the junit@yahoogr=\r\noups.com list isn&#39;t likely to happen, does\n&gt; anyone know of a similar forum=\r\n for &quot;intermediate-to-advanced&quot; users of\n&gt; JUnit with a better S/N ratio?\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks for listening,\n&gt; Todd.\n&gt; ----\n&gt; Todd Bradley - Polycom, Inc.\n&gt; =\r\nTest Lead, Proximo Projects\n\n",
