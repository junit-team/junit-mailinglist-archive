For <br/>\nexample, if I have a bunch of code that uses one single global <br/>\ndatabase accessed as a singleton, I may want to set up the database <br/>\nonce for all my tests. If I force myself to think carefully about the <br/>\nvisibility of the database, I find that I can restrict access to it <br/>\nto a few objects. If I just use TestSetup, I miss the chance to think <br/>\ncarefully.<br/>\n<br/>\nKent<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In junit@y..., noer2b@y... wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Kent: are you saying the design problem is typically with the <br/>\ntests, <br/>\n&gt; the unit under test, or both?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --- In junit@y..., kentbeck@c... wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; When I feel like sharing setup between tests, I usually have a <br/>\n&gt; design <br/>\n&gt; &gt; problem that deserves attention.
