I use it prior to using the Class.forName() method to add the\nselected test class to the test suite (using the addTestSuite(Class)\nmethod). If the class was not found (ie the classpath didn&#39;t include it)\nthen the forName() method would have failed prior to entry to the JUnit\ncode. \n\nThe only thing I can think of is that the junit.framework.Test class is\nsomehow different between its explicit reference in the isAssignableFrom()\nmethod of the TestSuite constructor and the junit.framework.Test class\npresumably loaded during the load of the heirachy of my unit test classes.\n\nI checked to see if the classloader is different for these classes but in\nall cases the getClassLoader method returned null. Needless to say this\ndoesn&#39;t help much :-(\n\nMichael Rutherfurd \n\n&gt; Here&#39;s one possibility: Do you have the test classes projects specified\n&gt; in your workspace classpath? The internal model has visibility to all\n&gt; classes so your code that scans the internal model for classes will be\n&gt; able to see everything. However, when you execute code, the VAJ worksace\n&gt; classLoader relies on the classpath set in the preferences for class\n&gt; visibility.\n&gt; \n&gt; -----------------------------\n&gt; Mike Silverstein\n&gt; SilverMark, Inc.\n&gt; The Object Testing Company\n&gt; www.javatesting.com\n&gt; **********************************\n&gt; * Providers of the &quot;Test Mentor&quot; *\n&gt; * Java component testing tool    *\n&gt; **********************************\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; &gt; From: mrutherfurd [mailto:mrutherfurd@...] \n&gt; &gt; Sent: Thursday, May 01, 2003 9:49 PM\n&gt; &gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [junit] JUnit VAJ tool problem\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Sorry to have to ask about obsolete platforms but I&#39;m stuck in VAJ \n&gt; &gt; 3.02 until work migrates to the new platform (WSAD 5/Websphere \n&gt; &gt; 5/OS390 :-)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m trying to get our team to use a formalised (and repeatable) unit \n&gt; &gt; test env, and JUnit is the choise. However, I need to make it as easy \n&gt; &gt; and seamless as possible to use. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; With this aim in mind I&#39;ve written a VAJ tool to scan for tests at \n&gt; &gt; the selected level (ie project, package or class), and run them \n&gt; &gt; automatically. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Now all the selection code works, the test classes work with the \n&gt; &gt; standard main() running TestRunner, but I receive a \n&gt; &gt; AssertionFailedError: No tests found when run from the tool.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve tracked it down to the isAssignableFrom() method failing in the \n&gt; &gt; TestSuite construtor. This has me confused as by the time \n&gt; &gt; isAssignableFrom() is called we have already sucessfully loaded the \n&gt; &gt; test class to get its constructor so the class must have been found \n&gt; &gt; in the classpath. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Any ideas?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; TIA\n&gt; &gt; Michael Rutherfurd\n\n\n",
