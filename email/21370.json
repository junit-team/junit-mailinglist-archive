It is definitely JUnit 3.8 test extension, so<br/>\nevery time you make a class, you could forget to setup the setup<br/>\nmethod or the teardown method (that last one is a bigger deal, as<br/>\noften the tests have no reason to recreate their own teardown, but<br/>\nteardown puts the database back into a production state<br/>\n(re-instituting the audit trail and other trigger-based operations,<br/>\nfor example). So in other words it would be an ongoing overhead every<br/>\ntime a new DBUnit test is made.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, if the tester did make their DBUnit test class a<br/>\nJUnit 4 class, it would work with this hack.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are techniques for using DBUnit without subclassing its class<br/>\nand kind of forcing testers to use JUnit4, but there is a lot of<br/>\ncommon setup code that seems to be good in the setup method. In fact,<br/>\nit seems a small step backwards that there is no way to inherit setup<br/>\nand teardown from a superclass (or some other method, say an<br/>\nannotation that runs the before and after declared in another class)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mark Levison &lt;mark@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Do you ever intend to change styles? If you do then you have pay the<br/>\nprice<br/>\n&gt; of the transition eventually. I had a similiar class of problem<br/>\n&gt; transitioning from NUnit 1.??? to 2.0 on a .NET project a few years<br/>\nago. In<br/>\n&gt; the end two of us divvied up the test code base and tore it too<br/>\npieces with<br/>\n&gt; scripts and chainsaws over two days. We reviewed each others work<br/>\nand got it<br/>\n&gt; right without too too much trouble.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; As for JUnit 4.x vs 3.8 - I&#39;ve never had the problems you outlined<br/>\nperhaps<br/>\n&gt; we should all dig deeper.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Back to my paying client.

I expect it to break with JUnit 4.6.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 2) Intellij doesn&#39;t report the test name correctly.

Clearly they do for JUnit 4 tests, but I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; haven&#39;t found anything for intermixing JUnit 3 tests.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I do appreciate the insight about the Assume class, it is very helpful<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to know!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a> &lt;junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt;, Mark Levison<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &lt;mark@&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; On Tue, Feb 17, 2009 at 1:23 PM, yme0987654321 &lt;yme0987654321@&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi David,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My name is Yishai (I have to figure out how to change this Yahoo<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; profile).
