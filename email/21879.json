But, I suppose what I could do, is create some code that does a DB insert/update, that simulates what the nightly job does, without actually doing all the work. In other words, take some data that I&#39;m expecting, and put it in the DB, rather than actually &quot;generate&quot; the data. That way, I don&#39;t need the nightly job to be part of the testing cycle. <br/>\n<br/>\nThen, all the tests could run independently, and not rely on each other, but I could also run them in order manually, to verify that the system actually works as a whole. Then, I could actually have an &quot;OrderedTest&quot; that instantiates all my TestCase classes, and calls them in order. That in itself would then be it&#39;s own separate test. <br/>\n<br/>\nDoes that sound like a good idea? <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhow, I respond to your comments below. <br/>\n<br/>\n----- &quot;Lothar Kimmeringer&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:maillists_job@...\">maillists_job@...</a>&gt; wrote: <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Lothar Kimmeringer&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:maillists_job@...\">maillists_job@...</a>&gt; <br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n&gt; Sent: Monday, August 17, 2009 1:27:27 AM GMT -07:00 US/Canada Mountain <br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [junit] Dependency Testing <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; The reason I ask is because this is what is basically happening: There <br/>\n&gt; &gt; is an external ASYNCHRONOUS SOAP messaging system that is the core to <br/>\n&gt; &gt; all communication between several companies. Requests/responses can be <br/>\n&gt; &gt; sent to and from all of the participating parties. For testing purposes, <br/>\n&gt; &gt; so that my tests can be a little more controlled, I send requests and <br/>\n&gt; &gt; responses to and from my own server. i.e. I do not send to other <br/>\n&gt; &gt; companies, because I cannot guarantee they will respond within the time <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I need (seconds), even though technically, their test systems are <br/>\n&gt; &gt; supposed to be up and running. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If you abstracted the layer between your applicaiton and the messaging <br/>\n&gt; system you can simply define a mock that answers the requests for you. <br/>\n&gt; That way you don&#39;t need to setup anything in advance. I&#39;m doing this <br/>\n&gt; here e.g. for testing the parts of our software doing OFTP by ISDN. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, that would be possible, but also a whole heck of a lot of extra work. It would probably double the code, perhaps even more. I was trying to keep my part of the application simple. :D <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, by doing this, I am still circumventing the testing that actually tests to see if the system actually works. And, I don&#39;t want to do that, as I want to be sure the system actually works, and not just my code. I could do these little abstractions (with a factory, that has test and production configurations), and that would test my code, but it would not test that my code works with the other system, as I would end up having a &quot;fake&quot; layer, pretending to be their system, but never actually verifying. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; 1. submit request to my system, through the external system. This is <br/>\n&gt; &gt; effectively to test receiving requests from the external system, to me. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; i.e. I can send requests to myself, as if they were coming from someone <br/>\n&gt; &gt; else&#39;s system. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; 2. receive request from external system <br/>\n&gt; &gt; 3. queue job for nightly build of data <br/>\n&gt; &gt; 4. check for available data from nightly job, the next day <br/>\n&gt; &gt; 5. send available data <br/>\n&gt; &gt; 6. receive the data sent in #5, and email it out to a staff member <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; For this I see Ant or Maven a better fitting tool than JUnit. There <br/>\n&gt; you have dependencies and all the things you need for data-transfer, <br/>\n&gt; emailing, etc. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I am using Maven, but maven isn&#39;t a testing tool. However, it does support JUnit. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; So write an Ant script that is preparing everything as needed and <br/>\n&gt; start e.g. the JUnit-tests that do the testing. With the optional <br/>\n&gt; tasks junit and junitreport you even end up with a nice HTML-page <br/>\n&gt; similar to a Java-API documentation showing you what tests failed <br/>\n&gt; and what succeeded. Combined e.g. with Cobertura you can see what <br/>\n&gt; parts of your application aren&#39;t under test. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Regards, Lothar <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__ <br/>\n    This communication is intended for the use of the recipient to whom it<br/>\n    is addressed, and may contain confidential, personal, and or privileged<br/>\n    information.
