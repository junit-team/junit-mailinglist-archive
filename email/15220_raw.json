Note that I\n&gt;&gt;am not talking about completely random suites and in 99.9% suite()\n&gt;&gt;method will return the same set od test cases. So, IDE or other test\n&gt;&gt;runner could of kept these instances alive or even easier - recreate\n&gt;&gt;only this instance using number of the test in the suite as a key.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m not saying that it&#39;s impossible to make improvement, but that it&#39;s \n&gt; impossible to handle every conceiveable situation, so we need a concrete \n&gt; example of the situation we&#39;re trying to address.  See below.\n\n   I am not talking about every situation. Actually there is not that \nmuch you can do using JUnit3 API.\n\n&gt; I was serious about my question, \n&gt; though--if any of the users on this list are right now frustrated by a \n&gt; test suite that they often use in Eclipse, and can&#39;t rerun individual \n&gt; tests in, that&#39;s a good starting point for a guess as to the next kind \n&gt; of test suites that Eclipse should handle.  \n\n   Count me as one.\n\n&gt; Please log a bug in Eclipse, \n&gt; and CC the list (I&#39;m currently spending some time on Eclipse/JUnit patches).\n\n   Here is the request I&#39;ve filled in about 2 years ago which is \ndescribing this issue from a different angle.\n\nAllow to choose required JUnit test cases\n   https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=40598\n\n   I&#39;ve also filled number of others requests against Eclipse JUnit \nintegration. Please take a look. If others from this list are also \nusing Eclipse and like to see some of them implemented it would make\nsense to vote for them:\n\nIncremental execution of JUnit tests [JUnit]\n   https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=41617\n   https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=41651\n\nRun properties for JUnit  does not allow to change test method name\n   https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=40597\n\nJUnit View wasting a lot of screen space\n   https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=35762\n   (closed, but I still believe that JUnit view can be redesigned to \nuse less screen estate. Since introduction of the progress view this \nJUnit&#39;s own progress bar is seem redundant to me but eats a lof of \nscreen space).\n\nJUnit do not run all selected tests or packages\n   https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=41618\n\nJUnit view slows down the execution of unit tests.\n   https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=49360\n   (closed but I still see the slowdown)\n\n[JUnit] A better JUnit and Eclipse integration.\n   https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=49558\n   (rather request for research then actual enhancement request, I can \nsee some integration opportunities using information collected by \nMylar project)\n\nUse regular console for JUnit stack trace [JUnit]\n   https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=72847\n\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;One cool thing about JUnit 4 is that while you should be able to do\n&gt;&gt;&gt;arbitrary test-creation cleverness using the @RunWith annotation, this\n&gt;&gt;&gt;is a static annotation that IDE&#39;s can easily check.  So version 17.1 of\n&gt;&gt;&gt;some IDE might be able to rerun tests run with TestClassRunner (JUnit 4\n&gt;&gt;&gt;default) and OldTestClassRunner (JUnit 3 default), and if it turns \n&gt;&gt;&gt;out a\n&gt;&gt;&gt;lot of people are using Parameterized, 17.2 could add support for that.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;   It seems violating the concept of annotations. You should not\n&gt;&gt;annotate the behaviour, but rather define enough metadata that can be\n&gt;&gt;used by the tool to decide how to behave. \n&gt; \n&gt; Tricky, maybe, but violating is a strong word.  :)  Can you give an \n&gt; example of how using annotations to identify the Runner that should be \n&gt; used by a particular class might be a problem?  Thanks,\n\n   Let me ask you another question first. Why would you need to have a \ndifferent runner for some specific test?\n   This doesn&#39;t sound right to me to begin with and may also make more \ndifficult to integrate with different tools (including coverage \nmetrisc, etc).\n\n   regards,\n   Eugene\n\n\n",
