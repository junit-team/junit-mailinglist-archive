We don&#39;t seem to have found any performance probl=\r\nems.\nMy only advise here is that if you are using weblogic then it&#39;s best t=\r\no\nmanually remove references to beans from the request and response scope\na=\r\nfter a page has been generated, or they won&#39;t be garbage collected.  But\nth=\r\nink I am starting to go off-topic...\n\nOne approach that can be used is to i=\r\nmplement the RequestDispatcher of your\nmock Servlet container such that whe=\r\nn you can intercept forwards and\nincludes.  This way you can assert that th=\r\ne Servlet has added the correct\nbeans to the request so that the JSP can re=\r\nnder the correct view.\n\nDave\n     -----Original Message-----\n     From: Mik=\r\ne Duffy [mailto:mike.duffy@...]\n     Sent: 18 June 2001 16:46\n   =\r\n  To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n     Subject: Re: [junit] Re: Has someone done =\r\nServlet JUnit tests?\n\n     Yes, keeping servlets and JSPs as thin as possib=\r\nle is a good approach.\n\n     Is anyone aware of any problems with the imple=\r\nmentation of JSP tag\n     libraries on the various application servers?\n\n  =\r\n   Also, is there any significant hit to performance when using tag\n     li=\r\nbraries?\n\n     Mike\n\n\n\n     Paul Hodgetts wrote:\n\n     &gt; Peter Qi wrote:\n  =\r\n   &gt;\n     &gt;  &gt; I need to create some JUnit tests for a Servlet.

Do=\r\nes anyone\n     have some\n     &gt;  &gt; experience?  Thanks a lot for the help.\n=\r\n     &gt;\n     &gt; You can use HTTPUnit to run tests against the servlet.  The\n =\r\n    &gt; problem, however, as you point out, is that you only have\n     &gt; limi=\r\nted visibility into the servlet, since you can only check\n     &gt; the return=\r\ned HTTP response to the web client.  It&#39;s gets even\n     &gt; more fun when yo=\r\nu&#39;re trying to test the behavior of session\n     &gt; time outs, security and =\r\nlog in checks, etc.\n     &gt;\n     &gt; What we&#39;ve discussed doing is to make our=\r\n servlets (and JSPs\n     &gt; via tag libraries) very thin layers that take th=\r\ne incoming\n     &gt; requests and just delegate to our presentation helper cla=\r\nsses.\n     &gt; In many cases, we&#39;ll end up just passing the request and\n     =\r\n&gt; session objects along, but we now have a point where we can\n     &gt; create=\r\n the request or session objects in particular states\n     &gt; (like expired s=\r\nession), so we can much more easily test the\n     &gt; interface&#39;s behavior, p=\r\nlus we can use JUnit.\n     &gt;\n     &gt; This isn&#39;t a silver bullet or anything,=\r\n because there are\n     &gt; still cases where you want to test the actual ret=\r\nurned HTML,\n     &gt; and sometimes HTTPUnit tests are the best way to do that=\r\n.\n     &gt; But it seems like it will make our life a bit easier for some\n    =\r\n &gt; other classes of presentation layer testing.\n     &gt;\n     &gt; Anyone else t=\r\nry this?\n     &gt;\n     &gt; -Paul Hodgetts\n     &gt;\n     &gt; To unsubscribe from thi=\r\ns group, send an email to:\n     &gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n     &gt;\n=\r\n     &gt;\n     &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
