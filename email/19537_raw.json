Would it handle your current situation?\n\nA=\r\ns Cedric pointed out, this only works if a test is a member of only one\ngro=\r\nup.  As so many others do, many of my tests are annotated to be in\nmultiple=\r\n groups.  For instance, &quot;nightly&quot; and &quot;quick&quot; and &quot;bug&quot; meaning\n&quot;I want Cru=\r\niseControl to run this test every night.  Also, this test is\nquick (and is =\r\ntherefore suitable for our continuous build).  Finally,\nthis test illustrat=\r\nes a bug which is not yet fixed.&quot;\n\n&gt; So, questions for the community:\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n1) Should something like ClasspathSuite be incorporated into JUnit?\n\nI beli=\r\neve so.  I certainly need functionality like that and currently\nhave to go =\r\nto an extension to get it.  Assuming there are many other\npeople in the sam=\r\ne boat, why not build it right in?\n\n&gt; 2) Should something like JUnitExt&#39;s c=\r\nategories be \n&gt; incorporated into JUnit?\n\nYes, especially if it allows you =\r\nto annotate a test case - and\npreferably even a test method - as being a me=\r\nmber of multiple groupings.\n\n&gt; 3) If yes to the above, what should the API =\r\nlook like?\n\nAs far as the categories go, I would like to see a simple metho=\r\nd-level\nannotation that looks like this:\n\n@TestGroups=3D{&quot;nightly&quot;, &quot;quick&quot;=\r\n, &quot;bug&quot;}\n\nThen, there would be a constructor on some TestSuite variant that=\r\n takes\nan array of strings which are names of the test groups to include in=\r\n the\nsuite.  I&#39;ve written code on my own to do this, but I&#39;d of course pref=\r\ner\nfor it to be built-in to JUnit so I don&#39;t have to worry about it\nbreakin=\r\ng when I upgrade to the latest JUnit.  I&#39;ve been on this email\nlist for 3 y=\r\nears now, and the fact that we discuss the need for better\ngrouping of test=\r\ns so frequently and for so long says to me that it&#39;s a\nlegitimate widesprea=\r\nd need.\n\n\nTodd.\n\n",
