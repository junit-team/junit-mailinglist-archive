I think such an approach would always\nb=\r\ne secondary to regular TDD - at least in my own work - but it could be\nusef=\r\nul.\n\nThis is something like the effect one gets already from &quot;surprising&quot;\nc=\r\nombinations\nof Datapoints using Theories and it&#39;s easy to imagine a program=\r\n that\ngenerated\nadditional &quot;surprises.&quot;\n\nCharlie\n\nOn Fri, May 13, 2011 at 1=\r\n1:30 PM, Esko Luontola &lt;esko.luontola@...&gt;wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Kalyan Kundu =\r\nwrote on 13.5.2011 11:07:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; First of all I know to know if\n&gt; &gt; there is=\r\n any automated testcase generator for jUnit(both 3 and 4)?\n&gt;\n&gt; There is at =\r\nleast this one:\n&gt; http://www.agitar.com/solutions/products/automated_junit_=\r\ngeneration.html\n&gt;\n&gt; Personally I wouldn&#39;t use any test generation, because =\r\na human is needed\n&gt; to write tests which communicate well the intent of the=\r\n behaviour being\n&gt; specified by the code [1]. Neither could it be used to d=\r\nrive the design\n&gt; of the production code.\n&gt;\n&gt; Also I have my doubts that ho=\r\nw useful such tools would be in dealing\n&gt; with legacy code [2], when the co=\r\nde to be tested has non-trivial\n&gt; dependencies. If the class is easy enough=\r\n to cover with tests, that even\n&gt; a program can do it, it would be easy for=\r\n a human to write the same\n&gt; tests. It would be a bit slower, but at the sa=\r\nme time his understanding\n&gt; of the code would increase and he would be able=\r\n to write more meaningful\n&gt; tests.\n&gt;\n&gt; Generating the production code based=\r\n on the tests would be more\n&gt; interesting...
