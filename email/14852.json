The goal, which I could have stated <br/>\nmore usefully up front, was this: JUnit 4, out of the box, does not <br/>\nprovide a dynamic test-suite building mechanism such as that provided by <br/>\nthe static suite() method in JUnit 3.  One reason to use suite() is to <br/>\ndynamically build a set of TestCase objects that implement the <br/>\nParameterized Test Case pattern (see _JUnit Recipes_, recipe 4.8).  <br/>\nJUnit 4 does not provide a suite() mechanism, so the JUnit developers <br/>\nwould like to find an alternate way to accomplish the same goal in JUnit 4.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe common case in JUnit 4 will be non-parameterized tests, just as it <br/>\nwas in JUnit &lt; 4.<br/>\n<br/>\n    David Saff</div>",
