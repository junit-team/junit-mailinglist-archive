They point out that TestCase, like key abstractions in\nmany mature frameworks, has a high pattern density, making it easy to use\nbut hard to change. In this installment of the AOP@Work series, Wes Isberg\nrevisits the Cook&#39;s Tour and shows you how using AOP pointcuts rather than\nobject-oriented designs can help you avoid some of the pattern density\nthat makes mature designs hard to change.\n\n\nThe author further goes on to state that:\n\nIn this article, I walk through the design presented by Erich Gamma and\nKent                                                                  Beck\nin &quot;JUnit: A Cook&#39;s Tour&quot; (see the Resources section). For each Java      \npattern they present, I propose an AspectJ alternative and evaluate how it\nsatisfies some of these canonical design goals:\n\nhttp://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-aopwork7/index.html\n\n\nCheers,\nVivek Oswal\n\n\n\n\n\n",
