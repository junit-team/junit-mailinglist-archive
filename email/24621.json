In most cases the {@link org.junit.runner.Description}<br/>\n * will be of a single test. However, if problems are encountered while constructing the<br/>\n * test (for example, if a {@link org.junit.BeforeClass} method is not static), it may describe<br/>\n * something other than a single test.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I can&#39;t figure out *how* I can read this failure and know that it is BeforeClass or not. I did some really ugly hacks by looking at the backtrace to see where it was triggered from that that&#39;s really fragile and I&#39;d like something better.<br/>\nI tried reading through Description and see if I could figure it out, but no luck thus far.<br/>\n<br/>\nTIA,<br/>\n  Chris</div>",
