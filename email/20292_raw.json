This entry might be a good place to start:\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; http://junit.sourceforge.net/doc/faq/faq.htm#tests_15\n&gt; \n&gt; There are ma=\r\nny good pieces of information in the FAQ and I suggest\n&gt; reading it careful=\r\nly.\n&gt; \n\nDefinitely, and started there first!  It gave me some really good \n=\r\npointers and make me rethink some of my strategy!\n\n&gt; \n&gt; The best thing with=\r\n JUnit testing is to think in terms of \nbehaviours.\n&gt; What behaviour are yo=\r\nu expecting from your system and write a test \nfor\n&gt; that. Do not let the f=\r\nact that some behaviours span multiple objects\n&gt; while others use only a si=\r\nngle method cause you to lose sight of the\n&gt; fact that testing is best done=\r\n at the unit level and the most \nworkable\n&gt; unit is the unit of behaviour.\n=\r\n&gt; \n\nYou make an excellent point, and something I didn&#39;t realize.  I was \nth=\r\ninking unit testing as &#39;test each method of my class&#39; and make sure \nthey w=\r\nork as expected.  But really, I&#39;m looking to test and see if my \napplicatio=\r\nn functionality (behaviour) works.  &quot;Can I create a report&quot; \nis what I&#39;m re=\r\nally after...\n\nThanks again.\n\n\n",
