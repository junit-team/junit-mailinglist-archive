If the input violates a precondition, the fault \n&gt; &gt;lies with the input, by definition.\n&gt; \n&gt; I wholeheartedly disagree with you. It makes no difference what your\n&quot;contract&quot; is between a piece of software and it&#39;s callers, if the\nsoftware doesn&#39;t check it&#39;s own inputs then it is at fault.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now, some pieces of functionality may not be critical enough to code\nguard conditions upon, an example might be getters and setters, or\nsome simple string or mathematics functions. But there are going to be\nsome where the functionality is going to be be of a life-threatening\nlevel and I know that I&#39;d want a VERY robust guard condition on that\ncode. An example of such a critical piece of code might be for\nRadiation Treatment units. I don&#39;t care how many documents you have\nthat say that the output requested will never be above n units of\nradiation, I&#39;m gonna build a guard condition into my code to make\ncertain that it could never happen.\n\nMy complaint is that you can have valid, thoroughly tested software\nthat complies to all your tests (JUnit-, integration- and acceptance\ntests) and still have JTest complain about it.\nHere is another way of putting it:\nPersonally I think that the &#39;exposure&#39; of (mainly) NullPointers by\napplying generated tests that put nonsense parameter values in methods\ndoes improve the quality of the product.\nThe motto &#39;Garbage in Garbage out&#39; still applies in this case. As an\nanalogy you might say that the software application is like a car\nexposing certain interfaces that must be handled in a specific way.\nIf you bypass these interfaces you can get unexpected results, no\nsensible car testing authority would put a burning piece of cloth into\nthe gastank and would report the following explosing a &#39;serious\ndefect&#39; found through a dynamic test.\n\nI do not want to resolve all &#39;dubious&#39; runtime exceptions reported by\nJTest ! \nIf you are working in life threatening devices using Java such as\nSimon you might need this JTest behaviour but I think 99% of all Java\ndevelopers work on non life threatening applications\n(except when you are running behind schedule and your boss want&#39;s your\nhead on a silver plate :))\n\ngreetings\nArie Roy (my boss just came in and gave me a smile and an apple ?)\n\n\n\n\n",
