I was just given a \nresearch project on how to do both unit testing and load testing of \nEJB. They told me to explore the possibility of using JUnit to unit \ntest EJB.\n\nI must say that I am still pretty new at this EJB, tomcat, and \nJUnit. my previous programming experience has been java IO,applet, \nswing, and some servlet.\n\nCan any of you guys give a pointer on where is the best place to \nstart looking for simple sample codes to run and play with ? I look \ninto jakarta.cactus website, but they don;t offer step by step \ninstructions on how to begin testing ejb. I don&#39;t even know how to \npack EAR, WAR, or jar file. \n\nany help would be greatly appreciated\n\n\n",
