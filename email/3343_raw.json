Thoughts? We will be using HttpUni=\r\nt and/or\n&gt; Cactus for the system tests.

Then, why\n&gt; don&#39;t you test the DE?\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; Approach:\n&gt; Write a couple of tests that use known &#39;Reject&#39; and &#39;Accept=\r\n&#39; messages.\n&gt; If\n&gt; a test case allows a &#39;Reject&#39; message through (no need t=\r\no use the\nwhole\n&gt; JMS system, just put the pre-constructed message through =\r\nthe\nappropriate\n&gt; procedure call), the test has failed. The opposite is als=\r\no true: if\n&gt; an\n&gt; &#39;Accept&#39; message is rejected, the test fails.\n&gt; \n&gt; You co=\r\nuld also test the &#39;Destination (To) Engine&#39; (TE). Create a\ncouple\n&gt; of mess=\r\nages for some known destinations, and check that the chosen\n&gt; destination f=\r\nor the given message has been chosen. Otherwise, the test\n&gt; fails.\n&gt; \n&gt; (If=\r\n the DE and TE are combined into one method, try combining the test\n&gt; cases=\r\n: known recepient/&#39;Reject&#39;/&#39;Accept&#39; pair. Otherwise, look into\n&gt; separating=\r\n both procedures, although this may not be practical.)\n&gt; \n&gt; In creating the=\r\nse tests, it might help to know about Mock Objects,\n&gt; or\n&gt; other alternativ=\r\nes (Object Mother, etc.).
