It would be a shame to have to look at two things <br/>\nwhenever you used to have to look at one. <br/>\n<br/>\nTo me, the better thing is to notice when things are hard to test and <br/>\nthen decide whether to break your classes down into pieces where <br/>\noperations can be public and whether, once public, they enable more in <br/>\nyour code.  If you want to see an example of this, look at FIT <br/>\n(fit.c2.com).  I don&#39;t recall if it&#39;s that way now, but in the early <br/>\nversions all methods were either public or package-scope.  You have to <br/>\nmake some serious tradeoffs when you adopt that style for API code, but <br/>\nin general it&#39;s a reasonable style for application (non-API) code.<br/>\n<br/>\nMichael Feathers<br/>\nwww.objectmentor.com<br/>\n<br/>\nOle Ersoy wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;Hi Guys,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Would it be a good idea to always use all public<br/>\n&gt;methods...?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;In the context of a convention where there is a<br/>\n&gt;&quot;MainClass&quot; and a &quot;MainClassHelper&quot; that has public<br/>\n&gt;methods used to help the MainClass.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Users of MainClassHelper (The collaborator should<br/>\n&gt;really be MainClass only) know that this class exists<br/>\n&gt;mainly for the purpose of helping MainClass, and all<br/>\n&gt;the methods are public, so that they can be easily<br/>\n&gt;unit tested.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Otherwise they would be private or protected members<br/>\n&gt;of MainClass.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;So MainClassHelper can really be thought of as a<br/>\n&gt;utility library that is specific to MainClass...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Anyone know if there are security risks to this,<br/>\n&gt;beside API risks?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Thanks,<br/>\n&gt;- Ole<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;____________________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;Don&#39;t get soaked.
