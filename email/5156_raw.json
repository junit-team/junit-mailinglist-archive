But first you have to decide which aspect(s) of the gui you want to\n&gt;&gt; test. For many people, making the gui so stupid that it can&#39;t\n&gt;&gt; possibly break\n&gt;&gt; and having it delegate to a class that can be unit tested, is sufficient.\n&gt; \n&gt; Most GUI&#39;s I&#39;ve seen change their appearance and behavior based on the state\n&gt; of the underlying objects (widgets enabled/disabled, hidden/shown, values\n&gt; changed in labels, text, tables etc.). When you are testing it is important\n&gt; to be able to ensure that the connection between the GUI and the rest of the\n&gt; code has been defined correctly.\n&gt; \n\nI agree 100% that this needs to be tested. The question is, where should we\ntest it?\n\nIf we put this logic in the gui layer, it becomes difficult to test and the\ncode becomes hard to maintain because every event listener ends up knowing\nabout every control. Mediator solves that problem.\n\nBut if we use Mediator to decouple the gui controls, we may as well delegate\neverything to the Mediator and leave the gui stupid. The Mediator can be\nunit tested just like any other class, and doesn&#39;t need the gui since all\ncommunication is done through interfaces.\n\n\n-- \nRobert Koss, Ph.D.     | Training, Mentoring, Contract Development\nSenior Consultant      | Object Oriented Design, C++, Java\nwww.objectmentor.com   | Extreme Programming\n\n\n\n",
