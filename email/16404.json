(The mock won&#39;t invoke itself any more than that.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for a method invoking itself, there&#39;s no direct way to mock the <br/>\ninvocation. Some basic reasoning should make that clear: if the method <br/>\nis mocked, then it wouldn&#39;t invoke itself. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI have thought about this in the abstract before, and don&#39;t have an <br/>\nanswer, except to point out that I&#39;ve never wanted to do this. There <br/>\nmust be a reason for that, and I hope it&#39;s a good one. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nCan you tell us what this method does? Perhaps that will shed some light <br/>\non what to do.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
