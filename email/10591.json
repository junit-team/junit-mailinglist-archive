Had read the docs of junit, but still not sure <br/>\nwhether it is useful for us. Here is a description about our product <br/>\nand the sort of test that we are looking for. Looking foward to your <br/>\nsuggestions?<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are 2 levels of tests we need to do.  One is the Simsbuilder, <br/>\nand <br/>\nthe other is for each model we implement for a client. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll focus on Simsbuilder testing.  As a first draft, I&#39;ll basically <br/>\ndo <br/>\na brain dump and we can refine/add to this by iteration. <br/>\n<br/>\nThese are the areas we need to test: <br/>\n<br/>\nOur product is a business model building tool. Users build a model <br/>\nusing the tool and input a scenario, and then run the generated <br/>\nsimulation based on the model and the scenario. The tool does c++ <br/>\ncode generation, compilation, and execution of the model. Two kind of <br/>\ntesting are needed. <br/>\n<br/>\n1. Test tool itself. Test strategy would be to build up a set of test <br/>\nmodels and their correct output to test the logic of the tool. An <br/>\nautomatic test framework can be built around these models so that <br/>\nthey run through the process of compilation, execution and comparison <br/>\nof output. Errors could come out at each stage of that process. This <br/>\nis not funtional testing of the tool, but more logic testing of <br/>\nequational based engine of the tool.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Persistence <br/>\nThere are two aspects of persistence we need to test.  first is the <br/>\nfunctional test, whether we can store and access data.  the second is <br/>\nperformance test, whether the data server can handle the load.  For <br/>\nthe first instance, we can use the data generated by the test models <br/>\nabove, and put a test framework around testing the data integrity and <br/>\naccess of the data server.  For performance test, we need to simulate <br/>\nmultiple client accesses over the network, with simulated time <br/>\ndelays, varying loads etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nJoe</div>",
