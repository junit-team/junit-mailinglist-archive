Actually, by the time I read your reply I had \nalready written something similar to the code you directed me to. I \nlooped through one collection and then determined if each item in it \nwas in the other collection using the &quot;contains&quot; method. Sounds like \nJUnit could use another overloaded version of assertEquals.\n\n--- In junit@y..., &quot;J. B. Rainsberger&quot; &lt;jbr@d...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Just do assertEquals on expected and actual collections. The\n&gt; &gt; collections all have sensible equals methods\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; i.e. if the 2 collections are lists they will be equal if they\n&gt; &gt; contain the same elements in the same order. If the 2 collections\n&gt; &gt; are sets they will be equal if they contain the same elements.\n&gt; \n&gt; The only problem with this otherwise great advice is that comparing \ntwo lists \n&gt; for the same elements, although not at the same indices, does not \nwork.\n&gt; \n&gt; This has been discussed, I think, to death somewhere on the web. \nMaybe you \n&gt; should look at http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?JavaUnitBestPractices and \nhunt around \n&gt; for something on comparing arrays or some such. There should be \nquite a \n&gt; complete discussion.\n&gt; \n&gt; The basic idea is this: write your own custom assertion \n&gt; or &quot;collectionsEquals&quot;, but be careful how to handle the \ndifferences. \n&gt; Especially for big collections, you need an easy way to know what \nthe \n&gt; differences are between the collections in the case where they are \nnot equal.\n&gt; \n&gt; If that resource does not help you, then let us know and we&#39;ll fill \nin the \n&gt; blanks. This sounds like another &quot;Tip and Trick&quot; for my site. :)\n&gt; \n&gt; --\n&gt; J. B.
