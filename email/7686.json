This is a <br/>\nJUnit extension targeted for database-driven projects that puts your <br/>\ndatabase into a known state between test runs.<br/>\n<br/>\nI usually use both Mock and DbUnit. I mostly use DbUnit to test the <br/>\nPersistence Logic. Then the Business Logic can be tested with a Mock <br/>\nimplementation of the Persistence Logic or using the true implementation <br/>\nwith DbUnit. As described by Paul Christmann, the latter tests are more <br/>\nFunctional tests than Unit tests. Running Mock tests is obviously a lot <br/>\nfaster!<br/>\n<br/>\nManuel Laflamme<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------- On 04/10/2003 07:10:14 AM &quot;javainsel&quot; wrote: <br/>\n---------------<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; A coworker suggested that we don&#39;t use Mock objects because he thinks <br/>\n&gt;that it is better to test everything together (code, framework, <br/>\n&gt;application server and database).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;It have problems to convince him.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;He wants to include two methods in the JUnit tests: makeTestData() <br/>\n&gt;and deleteTestData(). The first method would be called before the <br/>\n&gt;testing is started. The second method he wants to call after testing <br/>\n&gt;is finished.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;What he wants is to do in makeTestData() is to write test data into <br/>\n&gt;the database for testing purposes. So he thinks we don&#39;t need Mock <br/>\n&gt;objects.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;We are not experienced both. But I read a lot of Mock objects.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;He also objects that the JUnit testing would be done only with Mock <br/>\n&gt;objects.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;What do you think? Is it better to use Mock objects or to do it like <br/>\n&gt;my coworker wants?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Yahoo!
