I<br/>\nassume you are able to delete it from Eclipse though.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; - I had a lot of tests throwing HeadlessExceptions, which surprised me. <br/>\n&gt; Something strange with the runner?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Oops, we&#39;ll look into that one. Feel free to file bugs directly if you<br/>\nprefer: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://trac.crap4j.org/newticket\">http://trac.crap4j.org/newticket</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Cheers, Ilja<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Thanks again for taking the time Ilja.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlberto<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.crap4j.com\">http://www.crap4j.com</a><br/>\nKnow your CRAP.
