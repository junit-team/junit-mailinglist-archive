I understand you are<br/>\ncurrently doing this as an exercise, so it&#39;s healthy to take it to<br/>\nextremes and do everything by the book in order to learn, but in your<br/>\nreal work, use your judgment and decide for yourself when you are<br/>\nindeed writing too much code, in which case it&#39;s probably safer to go<br/>\nthe usual route (get your code to work, then write tests for it).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe downside of TDD is that you can end up writing a lot of tests for<br/>\nbusiness code that you quickly throw away and rewrite, so the amount<br/>\nof churn can be quite high.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nCédric<br/>\nAuthor &quot;Next Generation Testing in Java&quot; (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tinyurl.com/yvyxa3)\">http://tinyurl.com/yvyxa3)</a></div>",
