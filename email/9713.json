I come from a Smalltalk<br/>\nbackground where everything is public. You make things private through<br/>\nwhat is effectively a comment. I like this because you don&#39;t throw<br/>\narbitrary limitations on people who want to use or extend your<br/>\nframeworks but you do let them know that certain methods are subject to<br/>\nchange in the future so they can manage risk accordingly.<br/>\n<br/>\nTying this to my append below, if you publish APIs via Interfaces and<br/>\nmake methods in concrete classes public, indicating which methods are<br/>\nreally likely to change or go away via comments, others are free to<br/>\nextend the concrete classes as much as they see fit and assume as much<br/>\nrisk as they feel comfortable with.<br/>\n<br/>\n -----------------------------<br/>\n Mike Silverstein<br/>\n SilverMark, Inc.<br/>\n The Object Testing Company<br/>\n www.javatesting.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Michael Silverstein [mailto:msilverstein@...] <br/>\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, October 16, 2003 9:02 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com<br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: [junit] Re: How to test private methods, its urgent<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Private methods are difficult to test because, after all, <br/>\n&gt; they&#39;re private. If you adopt a convention that API methods <br/>\n&gt; are only presented via Java Interfaces instead of concrete <br/>\n&gt; classes then you don&#39;t care about the way the implementers of <br/>\n&gt; the Interfaces are written. You can then make non-API methods <br/>\n&gt; within the concrete implementation public without implying <br/>\n&gt; that they are themselves API methods. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You would also write your API tests for the Java Interfaces <br/>\n&gt; and plug in the concrete implementations to test them. If you <br/>\n&gt; need to write tests for lower-level supporting methods within <br/>\n&gt; the concrete classes you can do that separately, as <br/>\n&gt; appropriate and its easy because they are public.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Mike Silverstein<br/>\n&gt; SilverMark, Inc.<br/>\n&gt; The Object Testing Company<br/>\n&gt; www.javatesting.com<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Chirag Shashikant Doshi [mailto:chirag.doshi@...]<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Wednesday, October 15, 2003 11:02 PM<br/>\n&gt; &gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Subject: RE: [junit] Re: How to test private methods, its urgent<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hi Michael<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Personally, I don&#39;t believe in private methods.

Therefore well<br/>\n&gt; &gt; tested public<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; methods will include the behaviour of the private methods.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; There is no real reason for directly testing private methods.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Domain objects support the GUI. By the logic above a well<br/>\n&gt; &gt; tested GUI will include the behavior of the domain objects, <br/>\n&gt; &gt; so there is no reason to unit test the domain objects :-)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve occasionally found reason to write unit tests for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; private, supporting methods. Often you loose efficiency <br/>\n&gt; &gt; testing supporting methods indirectly via their caller - such <br/>\n&gt; &gt; as in the case where you want to test their ability to <br/>\n&gt; &gt; properly handle a range of input values. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Personally, I don&#39;t believe in private methods.
