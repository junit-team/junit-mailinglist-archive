I&#39;d be interested to try to work out\n&gt; exactly why =\r\nit doesn&#39;t on the OP&#39;s box.\n\nDoh! Isn&#39;t it always the way? I worked it out =\r\n(I think) about 3\nminutes after posting the above (when I&#39;d just got into t=\r\nhe car).\n\nThe problems with calling overridden methods in a constructor are=\r\n\nparticularly nasty when it comes to inner classes - and *very* nasty\nfor a=\r\nnonymous inner classes which use variables in the declaring method.\n\nThere =\r\nwas a change to the Java compiler (and the byte code spec, if I\nremember co=\r\nrrectly) to allow certain fields to be initialised *before*\nthe call to the=\r\n superconstructor - fields such as those effectively\ntaken from the declari=\r\nng method for anonymous inner classes, and the\nhidden field containing the =\r\nreference to the &quot;parent&quot; instance for all\ninner classes.\n\nNow, I can&#39;t fin=\r\nd where the change is documented unfortunately - I\nthought it was a feature=\r\n in 1.4, but I can&#39;t see it in the release\nnotes. Anyway, I suspect that we=\r\n&#39;ll find the OP was using an older\nversion of javac than I am, hence the di=\r\nfference.\n\nIn the light of this, I would after all agree with the idea that=\r\n using\nan overridden method in a constructor puts you in no man&#39;s land, at\n=\r\nleast in the case where you&#39;re using an inner class.\n\nJon\n\n\n\n\n\n",
