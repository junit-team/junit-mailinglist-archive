I \nneed to run my unit tests. what I am looking at accomplishing with \nthese unit tests is that I should be able to get data from the \ndatabase, and use the retrieved data in the unit tests. \n\nI am able to accomplish this using JBuilder IDE, but I would like to \nrun my tests from the command line. When I use the \njunit.swingui.TestRunner class, it runs fine as long what I am \ntesting is tn the current jvm, but the database operations happen, \nthrough JBoss and this part of my test is failing.\n\nWould some body please help.\n\n\n\n",
