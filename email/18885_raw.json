I&#39;d be leery of a class that=\r\n generates HTML and sorts. If the\n&gt;  &gt; sort is an another class, it can be =\r\npublic and far easier to test.\n&gt;\n&gt;  I&#39;ve always wondered why most developer=\r\ns are highly offended by making\n&gt;  things more public for purposes of testi=\r\nng\n\nHere is my take:  for the past twenty years, we have been taught the\nbe=\r\nnefits of object-oriented programming and encapsulation, at school,\nin the =\r\nworkplace and in countless books and articles.\n\nThe emphasis on testing has=\r\n only received more visibility in the past\nfive years, and some of its prin=\r\nciples are indeed at odds with some of\nthe OO knowledge that has been perva=\r\nding the software industry for two\ndecades now.\n\nAfter being told repeatedl=\r\ny that encapsulation was paramount to\nsoftware quality, it&#39;s not always eas=\r\ny to let this go in favor of\nanother technique, but I think the message is =\r\ngetting through and that\nmore and more developers are becoming more aware o=\r\nf the pros and cons\nbetween &quot;extreme OO&quot; and &quot;pragmatic testing&quot;.\n\nIn hinds=\r\night, I am absolutely shocked that all the teachers I had in\nschool 20+ yea=\r\nrs ago that I had so much respect for had absolutely no\ninclination (and so=\r\nmetimes only contempt) for testing...\n\n-- \nC=E9dric\nhttp://testng.org\n\n",
