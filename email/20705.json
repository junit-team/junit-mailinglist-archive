Up to <br/>\nnow I am<br/>\nnot sure what to expect of it. With my little experience I only see the <br/>\nproblem of provoking<br/>\nall possible error cases, e.g.:<br/>\n<br/>\nclient.login(user, pass)     // illegal arguments, authentication error, <br/>\ntimeout ..?<br/>\n<br/>\nBut as I said, I do not know, which help EasyMock offers me in these cases.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; Taking my Importer/Exporter example a second time, it is more <br/>\n&gt;&gt; a cron script than an application: Doing a defined job in a <br/>\n&gt;&gt; robust and understandable manner but neither designed as a <br/>\n&gt;&gt; basis for wide enhancements nor for ultimate flexibility. <br/>\n&gt;&gt; So there are methods which start the whole work of an <br/>\n&gt;&gt; importer over the whole lifecycle (connect, fetch data, map <br/>\n&gt;&gt; data etc). Methods, which are necessary for getting the <br/>\n&gt;&gt; object in a usable state (e.g.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; connection established) are hidden away. To ensure that there <br/>\n&gt;&gt; must be the correct state before executing the main task I <br/>\n&gt;&gt; can lead the user with parameterized constructors (e.g. <br/>\n&gt;&gt; MyImporter(host, port)).<br/>\n&gt;&gt;     <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Whole&quot; sounds like a megajob, thats not a good practice in<br/>\n&gt; unit testing. Maybe the lifecycle is a separate object that<br/>\n&gt; controls different tasks; the connections and fetchers are<br/>\n&gt; serviceobjects that do something with your data objects.<br/>\n&gt;   <br/>\n </span></blockquote>It sounds more than it is in my case. Such kinds of importers often are <br/>\nonly some glue between<br/>\ndata formats (xml/ db), connection handling (getting the data from a to <br/>\nb) and much reboust<br/>\nexception handling and logging.<br/>\nSometimes - when I really think about which class should do what in <br/>\ncontrast to others - I tend to<br/>\ncode over-ambitioned. This leads to many classes which really do their <br/>\njob: connection handlers,<br/>\nvalue or transfer objects, data mappers, controllers whatever. And there <br/>\nlies a certain beauty, every<br/>\nclass does only what it is ment for and even better: it only knows what <br/>\ni really needs. But for a simple<br/>\ntask like &quot;get data from a, parse data into structure, put it into place <br/>\nb&quot; this produces lots of classes<br/>\nwith perhaps two methods, and some more only for building an abstraction <br/>\nlayer - which can be useless<br/>\nif it is not part of another bigger architecture.<br/>\nThe endprduct can be a less beautyful code, but in best KISS manner.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; All objects/units are easilier to test if they have one<br/>\n&gt; objectiv, that you can test separatly.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Thats the point. I see a difference between a good practice in Unit <br/>\nTesting and the intention<br/>\nof how the class should be used. My FTP Example (very simplified):<br/>\n<br/>\n+FtpImporter(host, port, user, pass)<br/>\n+ImporterObjects[] import()                   // calls connect()/ <br/>\ndisconnect()<br/>\n-connect()<br/>\n-disconnect()<br/>\n(+ some setters getters for the attributes)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is clear that this is bad for two reasons:<br/>\n- no flexibility in controlling the data-/workflow (especially open, close)<br/>\n- therefore a problem in testing<br/>\n<br/>\nBut there comes the advantage I mentioned as usage intention:<br/>\n- it is clear how to use the importer<br/>\n- it is very hard to bring the class in an invalid state<br/>\n<br/>\nOpening the open/close methods and offering the standard constructor for <br/>\nlater<br/>\ncode (configured) injection would offer a way to handle the class wrong:<br/>\n<br/>\nnew FtpImporter().import()   // missing connect<br/>\n<br/>\nIt would also need to put extra state validation into the connect/ <br/>\ndisconnect methods<br/>\n<br/>\nSaid again, it is not the best example, but it shows, how hiding <br/>\nimplementaiton details<br/>\ncan lead the usage. Sure, some assumptions must be met:<br/>\n- the code is _not_ made for flexibility or enhancements. I think for a <br/>\none-way-special-<br/>\ncase-importer this is a common simplification<br/>\n- it is sure that the workflow of the program won&#39;t change in a way I <br/>\ncan not handle,<br/>\nbecause the components/classes are too closed<br/>\n<br/>\nBest greetings!</div>",
