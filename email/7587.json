But I am not so blind to overlook all the <br/>\n&gt;&gt; problems concerning JUnit/TDD.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I don&#39;t say (and I think nobody says) that JUnit is perfect (why do<br/>\n&gt;you think I&#39;m managing JUnit-addons?) but it gives you enough freedom<br/>\n&gt;to write and test pretty much whatever you want.  But of course you<br/>\n&gt;have to invest some time understanding the framework.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Kent once told me about his vision of JUnit. He described a sign that JUnit was &quot;doing its job&quot;: if each person that uses JUnit says, &quot;I needed to add just one or two little things and JUnit was perfect for me,&quot; then JUnit has done its job. Kent wanted to build the greatest possible intersection of all people&#39;s needs; but remember that the more sets you intersect with, the smaller the intersection...<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Since I haven&#39;t used JTest (well, $3500...) I can&#39;t really say if<br/>\n&gt;JTest would be more useful *for me* than JUnit + my addons.  But I<br/>\n&gt;will first learn DbC before learning a new test runner (JTest).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That is a recommended course of action.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJ. B.
