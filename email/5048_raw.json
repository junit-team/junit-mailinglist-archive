I created a collection ( \n&gt; collection &quot;A&quot;) that contains my expected results. My test case \n&gt; creates a collection (collection &quot;B&quot;). Now I need to ensure that \nthe \n&gt; items in &quot;A&quot; are the same items that are in &quot;B&quot;. I can create my \nown \n&gt; method that takes both collections as parameters and returns a \n&gt; boolean if the items are the same ( by looping through the \n&gt; collections) but was wondering if there was a way to use an assert* \n&gt; method to do the same thing.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks.\n\n\n",
