I can see why the System.out.println() is\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; redundant here, since the assertEquals will provide the actual\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; length of the vector on failure. But generally, when and where\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; are diagnostic messages in tests appropriate? Do you have a problem\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; with System.out.println() or diagnostic messages in tests in general?\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; System.out.println got lost, assertXYZ don&#39;t.  If an assert message\n&gt;  &gt; doesn&#39;t give you enough information to debug your code, then maybe the\n&gt;  &gt; assert is not doing enough.  A least that&#39;s what I think.\n&gt; \n&gt; What about http://apricot.sourceforge.net/ ?\n\nRIP.\n\n&lt;snip /&gt;\n\n&gt; My own preference is to use log4j events in tests so I can\n&gt; monitor what is going on, which is especially useful when a test\n&gt; fails. I accept that System.out is rather primitive, but if your\n&gt; test runner is able to capture the output to this stream and\n&gt; present it with the test, then it doesn&#39;t have to get lost.\n\nIf a test fails, then you are making an assumption that does not hold \ntrue, either about the test or the production code you are testing. Add \nmore assertions.\n\n&gt; I&#39;m interested in this stuff because I&#39;m interested in the process\n&gt; different programmers choose to adopt when using JUnit. For example,\n&gt; when you write a failing test you can often get it to pass once you\n&gt; implement the functionality. Sometimes, however, the test still fails\n&gt; unexpectedly. That&#39;s why tests are so useful, they tell you you&#39;ve made\n&gt; a mistake immediately. Programmers who don&#39;t write tests would assume\n&gt; at the point of implementation that they hadn&#39;t made a mistake and\n&gt; continue with the next task.\n&gt; \n&gt; How do people fix such a failing test? What information do you use to\n&gt; diagnose and fix it? Or is it always the time to reach for your\n&gt; debugger?\n\nIf I cannot pass a test right away, I throw away my production code and \ntry again. If I&#39;m wrong twice in a row, I might throw the test away and \ntry to write it again. Typically (according to my experience) that&#39;s \nfaster than doing all this diagnostic stuff.\n-- \nJ. B.
