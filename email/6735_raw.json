I&#39;ve learned a lot during this time, thank you\nall, guys.\n\nIn this post, I&#39;d like to discuss a problem of test naming. \nI mean not only test naming, but also naming of test classes, \npackages and methods. \n\nWhen one starts writing tests for legacy code (or even for new one),\nthere is a common task - find existing tests for some code (if there are\nany), and decide, how to name new tests. Sometimes the task is obvious, \nbut not always. Shall one include the name of the class under test \ninto the test class name? Shall one include name of the tested method \ninto testXXX method? Or it depends?\n\nAs far as I learned, usually we shall test behaviour and design, \nnot specific classes and methods. This allows us to keep tests \ntask-oriented and not implementation-oriented.\nConsidering this, I see the following possible decisions regarding\ntests organization: \n\n1. For Functional tests:\n    - all tests for a use case (and, possibly, alternative flows) are \n    placed into a single package with an appropriate name. \n    - each test scenario is placed into single class with appropriate name.\n\n2. For Unit tests:\n    - test package shall be the same as for the production code, \n    but it is better to use a different source tree.\n    - for simple classes (such as value objects) it is OK to name\n    test classes after the name of the class under test \n    (like UTestFooBar or FooBarTest). Names of test methods,\n    in its turn, may include the name of the tested method.\n    - for complex classes, which require a complex fixture to be set,\n    test case class shall be named using fixture description. \n    (The issue was discussed previously on this list).\n    Test method name in this case shall describe the tested behaviour.\n\n3. For Integration Tests:\n    - I suggest, names of Integration tests must differ from Unit tests.\n    Usually, integration tests run longer, and consequently, more seldom. \n    That&#39;s why it is convinient to name them differently. One may name \n    unit tests using UTest prefix, anf Integration tests using ITest prefix.\n    - I suggest to put integration tests into the same place where unit \n    tests live (same source tree).\n    - The names of test classes/methods should be chosen using the same \n    criteria as for complex Unit tests (based on behavioural aspects).\n\nI&#39;d be very glad to hear any comments on this.\n\nSorry for such a long post and thank you for your patience.\n\nWith king regards,\nKIR\n\n-- \nKirill Maximov aka KIR\nkir@... | http://www.maxkir.com/\nSt.Petersburg, Russia\n\n\n",
