It was pretty clear to me.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>E-mail can cause a lot of misunderstandings, especially when one projects their<br/>\nown assumptions into what they are reading.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; OK. Did you get the explanation you wanted? Sometimes the explanation <br/>\n&gt; takes pages and pages, and I don&#39;t have the energy to write that out <br/>\n&gt; every time someone asks.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That is understandable.  But if you could point me to these pages then I would<br/>\nvoraciously consume them.  I have of course read all the attached documentation<br/>\nthat comes with JUnit, and I have been trying to make use of the JUnit-Addons<br/>\npackage.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I apologize for my tone. I was tired, and it seemed like you were asking <br/>\n&gt; for our advice, then disregarding it anyway. You can understand how that <br/>\n&gt; might be enervating.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sure, but it is also enervating when you are told to give it up when you know<br/>\nthat there is more to the story.<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe that I have found my own answer.  At least here are my thoughts at the<br/>\nmoment.  Data driven testing in the way that I am trying to do it is not easily<br/>\nsupported in JUnit.  There is likely a reason for this, since a lot of thought<br/>\nhas gone into producing JUnit.  I now believe that my approach is not in keeping<br/>\nwith JUnit.  Since I am running the actual metadata from the application through<br/>\nthe test, I am doing more of a data driven functional type of testing.  A<br/>\nsolution that appears more consistent with JUnit and unit testing in general<br/>\nseems to be to make some mock metadata classes that are specially designed to<br/>\nexercise my code in the test.  This way my test is not dependent on any<br/>\nproduction code rather than the actual class that it is testing, and I am not<br/>\ntrying to dynamically find all the production code and iterate through it all. <br/>\nInstead I am looking to carefully engineer my own metadata to exercise my tests.<br/>\n To implement this I basically wrote an abstract test class, and then made<br/>\nspecific subclasses that are each mainly concerned with building specific mock<br/>\ndata.  It is okay that this data is hardcoded rather than dynamic because I am<br/>\nlooking to exercise the code by carefully building my own data rather than<br/>\nrunning through all data that currently exists in the application.  I was<br/>\nbasically being lazy by using data that already existed and not crafting my own.<br/>\nBut running actual production data does seem useful at least a few times when<br/>\ntesting your own tests, just because there is some potential in catering to your<br/>\nown tests when writing your own data as well.  Does that part make sense?  This<br/>\nis the only thing that feels strange about my current ideas.  Am I on the right<br/>\ntrack?<br/>\n<br/>\nI know that there are many frustrations with dealing with a mailing list.  I<br/>\napplaud your taking the time to answer peoples questions, and feel very lucky<br/>\nto have the opportunity to carry on a dialog with an expert.  Thanks so much for<br/>\nyour time getting me past this hurdle.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
