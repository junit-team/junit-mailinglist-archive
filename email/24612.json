We expect this to be the last beta release before shipping 4.12.<br/>\n <br/>\nThere have been a few fixes since the second beta. Most importantly, 4.12-beta-3 is now fully compatible with 4.11 in terms of serialization (the Result class was now fixed, too). In addition, two issues related to @ClassRules have been fixed: A validation now checks that only instances of TestRule can be used in combination the @ClassRule, and @ClassRule now also works on methods (which previously only worked for the @Rule annotation).<br/>\n <br/>\nPlease give it a try!
