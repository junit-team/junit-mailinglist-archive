I liked it \nbecause it was simple for the simplest case of setting expectations.\n\nWhen I started using jMock, I much preferred it, because:\n\n1. It has direct support for fakes/stubs.\n2. It makes ignoring method parameters easy.\n3. Its support for complex parameter, method or invocation matching is \ngreat.\n\nIf there is ever a 2nd edition of _JUnit Recipes_, I will replace all \nthe EasyMock example code with jMock.\n\nThe people who don&#39;t like jMock often say it&#39;s because declaring the \nmethod names as strings makes refactoring more error-prone. That might \nbe the case, but I have never felt pain as a result of it.\n\nI hope that helps.\n-- \nJ. B.
