However,\nthere&#39;s more than that=\r\n.\n\n&lt;snip&gt;\n\nI separate production source from test source, but currently all=\r\n our\ntest cases are in one tree (per project).\n\nThe main problem I see with=\r\n your solution (other than it not keeping\nall the tests for one class in a =\r\nsingle easily findable place) is that\nit only works while you&#39;ve only got o=\r\nne axis you want to divide the\ntests up by. Another axis which is relevant =\r\nfor us is which area of\nfunctionality is involved - and that may not always=\r\n be feasible on a\npackage/namespace basis. For instance, if all db-schema-s=\r\nensitive\ntests are categorised as such, then after making a schema change I=\r\n can\nrun all those tests, whether they&#39;re also performance tests or not. In=\r\n\nthe situation where running *all* unit tests just isn&#39;t feasible\nbefore ev=\r\nery check-in, being easily able to choose which tests are run\n(across both =\r\nNUnit and JUnit, by the way) to verify that nothing&#39;s\nbeen broken requires =\r\nmore flexibility than a single axis would provide.\n\nJon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
