What you want to do is\nmaximize the ROI of the time spent writing tests (i.e. get the biggest\nbang for the buck).  You need to find places in the codebase that\nwould benefit the most from adding tests and go after those first. \nYou just keep plugging away at it.. What&#39;s the worst problem?  Deal\nwith it.  Now what&#39;s the worst problem.  Deal with it.. etc.  Also,\nwhen you work on a piece of code, wrap it in some tests first.  As you\nhave more & more tests in place, you&#39;ll be better able to refactor\ninto something that is more testable.. so you can add more & better\ntests.  Getting a legacy codebase under test (and under control!)\nisn&#39;t a big bang effort... it&#39;s gradual... part of everyone&#39;s daily work.\n\nI&#39;m actually working on something very similar at the moment.. using\nmetrics (with TCC in fact) to find places in the codebase that need\nattention.\n\nDave\n\n\n",
