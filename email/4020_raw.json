My problem is that I can&#39;t use the &#39;new&#39; operator to create instances of MyClass inside TestMyClass because I&#39;m tied to the framework factory method. Perhaps if I could use a constructor in the test class with an instance of the class to be tested passed as a parameter... But in that case I think that I couldn&#39;t use the TestRunner.run( -- ); I&#39;d need to make my own TestRunner where I could run a suite over a concrete instance of MyClass. \nMakes this any sense? Perhaps I should practice a bit more with the JUnit framewok to get a better understand about how it could fit. Even more, I should practice more with complex structures in Java to get fluency in my designs - the beginnings are always hard :-).\n\n--- In junit@y..., Mark Meyers &lt;markm@m...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; you should use &quot;some.package.MyClass.TestMyClass.class&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; But I don&#39;t like the mixing of production and test code.\n&gt; There is no need for static inner class here as far as I can see.\n&gt; Just make it an &quot;external&quot; class, and if you need to access getter and\n&gt; setter methods, make them public...\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; &gt; From: sansanwo [mailto:sansan@m...]\n&gt; &gt; Sent: dinsdag 12 februari 2002 12:22\n&gt; &gt; To: junit@y...\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [junit] Newbie questions\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;\t&lt;Snippet&gt;\n\n\n",
