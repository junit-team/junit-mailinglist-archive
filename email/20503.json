    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1502158140\">I&#39;ve been asked to organize a half-day/day long session to help a team<br/>\nat my organization really learn TDD. They have all been to a TDD<br/>\ncourse but for a variety of reasons didn&#39;t learn enough to pick up the<br/>\nhabit. The developers all think that TDD is a worthy idea but don&#39;t<br/>\nknow enough to practice it day to day.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo make this worthwhile I think we need a more interesting example<br/>\nthan the typical factorial example and a location that encourages<br/>\npairing. I could start with the team&#39;s existing code and tasks but I<br/>\nthink we would spend a lot of time on non-trivial edge cases without<br/>\nreally hitting TDD. Instead I think I will offer to pair with people<br/>\nto tackle these problems.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m looking for any and all ideas, but have some specific questions:<br/>\n- What example would you use? Brian Marick had mentioned one:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.exampler.com/blog/2007/06/26/a-workbook-for-practicing-test-driven-design-draft/\">http://www.exampler.com/blog/2007/06/26/a-workbook-for-practicing-test-driven-design-draft/</a><br/>\nbut the downloads are broken.<br/>\n- Do you have an example that would demonstrate any of these difficult<br/>\nissues: abstracting the database, test driving bits of the GUI?<br/>\n- Do you have good examples to help demonstrate Test Driven<br/>\nRefactoring aka Michael Feathers and Legacy code.<br/>\n- Would you go off site? They don&#39;t have a team room yet.<br/>\n- Would a boardroom setup work well to encourage pairing?<br/>\n- How long would you make the session? Half day? Full day?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat would you do?<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW this was also posted to the TDD group - with apologies if you&#39;ve<br/>\nalready seen it.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<br/>\nMark<br/>\n----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nBlog: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.notesfromatooluser.com/\">http://www.notesfromatooluser.com/</a><br/>\nOne Year of Scrum: Lessons Learned<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.notesfromatooluser.com/2007/10/one-year-of-scr.html\">http://www.notesfromatooluser.com/2007/10/one-year-of-scr.html</a><br/>\nAperture vs. Lightroom - best comparisons<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.notesfromatooluser.com/2007/02/aperture_vs_lig.html\">http://www.notesfromatooluser.com/2007/02/aperture_vs_lig.html</a><br/>\nCustomer Retention Department - Vonage Customer Service Sucks<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.notesfromatooluser.com/2007/06/customer_retent.html\">http://www.notesfromatooluser.com/2007/06/customer_retent.html</a></div>",
