To answer your question, I need to somehow =\r\npass the\nobjects into the Junit test to call the method.\n\nLet me explain th=\r\ne scenario better. My problem is not that i am unable to\ntest the small cod=\r\ne change. I would be able to write testmethods only to\nexercise that part o=\r\nf the code. But in order to simulate a run time\nscenario, i need hav a lot =\r\nof objects populated already.\n\nThe kind of environment i need to simulate b=\r\nefore calling the test method,\nis something like this.\nI need to have a Vmw=\r\nareESX host to be registered in my application database,\nand identify what =\r\nare the VMs installed on that machine and and trigger an\noperation on those=\r\n VMs to move from one host to another.\n\nThis kind of scenario is very diffi=\r\ncult to populate on objects. I was\nlooking at a way to do those operations =\r\nmanually on my running application,\nand attach the Junit test class to the =\r\nalready running process where i will\nalready have the environment. I can us=\r\ne my application to do those set up\noperations before i trigger the junit t=\r\nest case.\n\nThis is very similar to how we can attach an eclipse debugger to=\r\n a running\nwindows service and point to a source code to debug. The paramet=\r\ners eclipse\nwould take for that (remote debugging) are ip address and port =\r\nnumber.\n\nIs there anything similar available with Junit framework?\n\nHope i =\r\nhave not confused you even more :)\n\nRegards\nAnanth\n\nOn Fri, Apr 30, 2010 at=\r\n 6:18 AM, David Saff &lt;david@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Ananth,\n&gt;\n&gt; Needing to =\r\nchange a small area in a large, tangled codebase is an\n&gt; all-too-familiar p=\r\nroblem.
