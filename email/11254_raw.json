B. Rainsberger Sat, 19 Jun 2004 10:46:42 -0400\n&gt;&gt; If the application uses the same streams as the test runner, then\n&gt;&gt; what you ask is impossible.\n\n&gt;&gt; The best you can do is customize the test runner (it&#39;s the path of\n&gt;&gt; least resistance) to send its output somewhere different, then\n&gt;&gt; redirect all standard output and standard error to files. You\n&gt;&gt; should be able to extend the textui TestRunner and override the\n&gt;&gt; ResultPrinter to print to a file, for example. Not too much work.\n\nMiguel Pessoa Monteiro Mon, 21 Jun 2004 16:23:41 +0100\n&gt; I would like to point out that this kind of thing is very easy to do\n&gt; with aspect-oriented programming (though I doubt that someone is\n&gt; willing to learn AspectJ just to do that).\n \njust to &quot;scratch an itch&quot; (to use an English colloquialism).\n\n&gt; I already did something along those lines, using a few simple\n&gt; aspects. Many people are using it to develop &quot;development aspects&quot;\n&gt; such as these, even if they do not include aspects in production\n&gt; code. Not for nothing AspectJ is considered by some people as &quot;the\n&gt; ultimate testing tool&quot;, though AspectJ is a lot more than that.\n\nYou should write that example up: sounds like an interesting article.\nFWIW I know the AspectJ tools for Eclipse include a\nrun-all-junit-tests module, but I haven&#39;t played with it.\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
