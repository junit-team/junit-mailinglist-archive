Maybe your client would prefer some expert help for a day or <br/>\ntwo? Even a half-day remote consultation would jump-start you. E-mail me <br/>\ndirectly if that&#39;s remotely feasible.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; But I reckon you&#39;ve got it there. We can & do JUnit it all, but it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; just such a big job to do. You&#39;re right that I can&#39;t, say, test<br/>\n&gt; anything about one Domain object without JMocking it&#39;s DAO and half a<br/>\n&gt; dozen more to make it with, and setting up their stubs & expects & so<br/>\n&gt; on.<br/>\n&gt; But maybe that&#39;s normal?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It&#39;s normal to need to mock/stub collaborators. It&#39;s enough normal to <br/>\nhave a lot of them, but there are definite antipatterns, such as this <br/>\ncommon gem:<br/>\n<br/>\n     I mock this collaborator to return that object, which I then have <br/>\nto mock, which has to return another object, which I then have to mock...<br/>\n<br/>\nYou get the picture. I imagine this antipattern is at the heart of much <br/>\nof your problem. There is probably some inappropriate layering going on. <br/>\nI&#39;d need to dive headlong into code to be certain, but I could probably <br/>\ntell you in 30 minutes if you led me through it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Cheers for the pointers to those books - I believe Da Boss is looking<br/>\n&gt; for some reading recommendations for us, so that&#39;s perfect!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I hope they help.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ.
