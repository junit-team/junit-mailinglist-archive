My thoughts on the subject so far are that Description\ns=\r\nhould provide a String with the human description and some sort of an\n(empt=\r\ny) interface, let&#39;s call it a TestSource which would provide\nadditional hin=\r\nts which resource to open and where. So something like this\n(ideas, not imp=\r\nlementation):\n\nDescription {\n  String getDescription();\n  List&lt;TestSource&gt; =\r\ngetSource();\n}\n\nI can think of numerous advantages of such an approach, for=\r\n example a\nsingle parameterized test could open the test case&#39;s source code=\r\n by\nreturning:\n\nJavaTestSource {\n  String className();\n  String methodName(=\r\n); // full signature?\n}\n\nbut it could also point to the file with parameter=\r\nized test data and open\n_that_ as well, as in:\n\nFileTestSource {\n  File fil=\r\ne();\n  int line();\n}\n\nNot giving much thought about the implementation, but=\r\n you get the idea.\nObviously this would be a major pain for all tools that =\r\nuse JUnit because\nthis would pretty much break backwards compatibility... b=\r\nut I&#39;m all for it\nif a new major revision of JUnit is to ever see the light=\r\n of day.\n\nTemporarily, and interestingly, Eclipse (and Ant and other tools =\r\nI think)\ncan be cheated a bit -- they all use a JUnit version provided by t=\r\nhe user&#39;s\nclasspath via reflective access typically (they don&#39;t have fixed =\r\nversion\ndependency). If you &quot;classpath-shadow&quot; your JUnit&#39;s Description (by=\r\n\nprepending classpath with your own Description class, keeping the same API=\r\n)\nyou can do anything you with with the descriptions... This is a dirty hac=\r\nk\nthough :(\n\nDawid\n\nOn Thu, Nov 3, 2011 at 10:50 AM, Matthew Farwell &lt;matth=\r\new@...&gt;wrote:\n\n&gt; **\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m interested in this, though =\r\nfor slightly different reasons, maybe we\n&gt; could exchange ideas on this. I =\r\nhaven&#39;t exactly thought this through in\n&gt; detail, but I think my requiremen=\r\nts come down to being able to store\n&gt; arbitrary information in a Descriptio=\r\nn, a key.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m interesting in testing with Scala, and there are (at leas=\r\nt) two generic\n&gt; problems:\n&gt;\n&gt; 1) Tests which are not linked to a specific =\r\nmethod, but are run as separate\n&gt; tests. Scalatest for example allows the f=\r\nollowing\n&gt;\n&gt; @RunWith(classOf[JUnitRunner])\n&gt; class FileSpec extends FlatSp=\r\nec with ShouldMatchers {\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;A Stack&quot; should &quot;pop values in last-in-first-=\r\nout order&quot; in {\n&gt; }\n&gt;\n&gt; it should &quot;throw NoSuchElementException if an empty=\r\n stack is popped&quot; in {\n&gt; }\n&gt; }\n&gt;\n&gt; This creates a single method with the tw=\r\no tests within. However, the\n&gt; JUnitRunner runs the single method but recor=\r\nds the two tests separately.\n&gt; This can be seen in Eclipse, see attached sc=\r\nalatest1.png. Now if I double\n&gt; click on the test name in the junit view, i=\r\nt tries to find a method of that\n&gt; name, and fails. Obviously, to correct t=\r\nhis would require a fix to Eclipse,\n&gt; but if I could store the file & line =\r\nnumber instead of the method name, I\n&gt; could jump to the appropriate line.\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; 2) Scala allows spaces and other characters in method names, but these\n=\r\n&gt; names are munged on compilation. For instance, space gets translated to\n&gt;=\r\n $0020.\n&gt;\n&gt; class FileTest extends AssertionsForJUnit {\n&gt; @Test def `foo ba=\r\nr`() =3D {\n&gt;\n&gt; }\n&gt; }\n&gt;\n&gt; Here the jump to in Eclipse works correctly, but t=\r\nhe displayed description\n&gt; in Eclipse isn&#39;t nice, see scalatest2.png.\n&gt;\n&gt; S=\r\no in both cases, the string I would like to display (in Eclipse, surefire\n&gt;=\r\n whatever) doesn&#39;t match the method name, either because there is no method=\r\n\n&gt; name or because It&#39;s not the same thing. I think that I could work aroun=\r\nd\n&gt; most issues is Eclipse etc if the test runner could add some arbitrary\n=\r\n&gt; information to the description, which it could subsequently use. A string=\r\n\n&gt; would be fine, because I could define the contents of that String, but\n&gt;=\r\n arbitrary data would be even better. String would be simpler for everyone =\r\nI\n&gt; think.\n&gt;\n&gt; Please note that I&#39;m just thinking aloud at the minute, and =\r\nI haven&#39;t\n&gt; actually done any proof of concepts as yet, but if you have any=\r\n ideas,\n&gt; please feel free to take this to email.\n&gt;\n&gt; Matthew Farwell.\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n[Non-text p=\r\nortions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
