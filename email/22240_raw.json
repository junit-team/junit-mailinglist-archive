But I think\n&gt; &gt;it&#39;s more interesting to imagine the user specifying the=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;nature of the dependencies and allowing the framework to\n&gt; &gt;figure out =\r\na strategy.\n&gt; \n&gt; I am very much with you on this one. In my experience, the=\r\nre have been a lot of times when functions under test within the same class=\r\n depend upon each other, and it would have been great to have the test harn=\r\ness know that information. When I was refactoring code for a new framework =\r\npackage, I would have loved to have the UI to display non-dependent tests f=\r\nirst as it would have shown me very clearly the source of the problem.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n Specifying only the relationships in code and leaving the display strategy=\r\n to the test harness would allow more flexible display and execution of the=\r\nse tests based upon the user&#39;s goals rather than upon the dependencies them=\r\nselves. I could imagine myself asking the UI only to display the least depe=\r\nndent functions&#39; errors and to hide all other errors for quick debugging on=\r\n sweeping optimizations. I could also want to see the dependent tests in a =\r\ntree in case I am changing a single class and want to understand the effect=\r\ns of what I am touching. I could also want to see all tests in a single lis=\r\nt with the least dependent at the top and the most dependent on the bottom =\r\nwhen running regression tests. As you can see, the chosen view depends more=\r\n upon what I am doing than upon the test dependencies themselves.\n&gt; \n&gt; Fina=\r\nlly, being able to list dependencies between test classes in addition to te=\r\nst cases would also JUnit to report which components of the system depend u=\r\npon each other. This simple extension would greatly increase the power of t=\r\nhe dependency models for larger systems (particularly regression tests).\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Thank you,\n&gt; \n&gt; Rocco\n&gt; \n&gt; From: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yah=\r\noogroups.com] On Behalf Of Charlie Poole\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, December 24, 200=\r\n9 12:09 AM\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: RE: [junit] Order of exec=\r\nution for tests\n&gt; \n&gt; Hi C=E9dric,\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; On another list, I identified th=\r\ne same variations of dependency but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; with the variation that for case =\r\n1. We might run B anyway but could\n&gt; &gt; &gt; highlight the error in A in some w=\r\nay. That approach doesn&#39;t require\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ordering the tests in any particula=\r\nr way, which has some advantages.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; It still promotes developer efficie=\r\nncy while not worrying about\n&gt; &gt; &gt; execution efficiency.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yes,=\r\n we call these &quot;soft dependencies&quot;.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If &quot;b&quot; has a hard dependency on=\r\n &quot;a&quot; and &quot;a&quot; fails, &quot;a&quot; will\n&gt; &gt; be marked &quot;FAILED&quot; and b &quot;SKIPPED&quot;.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; If &quot;b&quot; has a soft dependency on &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot; will still run even\n&gt; &gt; if &quot;a&quot; f=\r\nails but a warning could be displayed in the log.\n&gt; \n&gt; This is an implement=\r\nation-based view of the tests: i.e. they\n&gt; will either be run or not run.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; The distinction I was trying to make - and I think David as\n&gt; well - is=\r\n based on the cause and nature of the dependency.\n&gt; For the sake of argumen=\r\nt, I&#39;ll try to redefine what you&#39;re\n&gt; calling Hard and Soft along those lin=\r\nes.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hard: Test A does something (sets state) upon which B depends.\n&gt; F=\r\nor example, A may write to a data store and B might try to\n&gt; read the infor=\r\nmation back. Or A might create a complex object\n&gt; and B might try to call a=\r\n method on that object. If we allow\n&gt; this sort of thing, then there is no =\r\nchoice but to run A first\n&gt; and it makes sense to not run B at all if A fai=\r\nls. However,\n&gt; I would not want a unit test framework to allow it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sof=\r\nt: Test A tests some functionality upon which some other\n&gt; functionality, t=\r\nested by B, depends. Therefore, if test A\n&gt; fails, Test B will either fail =\r\nas well or be inconclusive,\n&gt; so nothing further can be learned from test B=\r\n. In this case,\n&gt; a testing framework could respond in a number of ways to\n=\r\n&gt; the dependency:\n&gt; 1) Run the tests in order, skipping B if A fails.\n&gt; 2) =\r\nRun the tests in an arbitrary order, but skip B if A\n&gt; already ran and fail=\r\ned.\n&gt; 3) Run the tests in an arbitrary order, not skipping any\n&gt; of them bu=\r\nt organize reporting in such a way that a failure\n&gt; of A takes precedence o=\r\nver a failure of B.\n&gt; \n&gt; As a framework author, I can see that allowing the=\r\n user to\n&gt; specify ordering is a simpler implementation. But I think\n&gt; it&#39;s=\r\n more interesting to imagine the user specifying the\n&gt; nature of the depend=\r\nencies and allowing the framework to\n&gt; figure out a strategy.\n&gt; \n&gt; Charlie\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Every time we have discussed this potential feature for\n&gt; &gt; TestNG, =\r\nthe discussion ended up being non conclusive on the\n&gt; &gt; real interest and t=\r\nhe existing ability to mark certain\n&gt; &gt; methods as &quot;alwaysRun&quot; already fill=\r\ns a big part of this\n&gt; &gt; scenario, so I always ended up punting on it, but =\r\nI&#39;d be\n&gt; &gt; happy to hear if someone can come up with a good use case for\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; soft dependencies...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --\n&gt; &gt; ***C=E9dric\n&gt; &gt; *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; [Non-te=\r\nxt portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ------------=\r\n------------------------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
