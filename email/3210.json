    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1543987472\">According this topic I found two different views: <br/>\n-) In the sourceforge FAQ they propose to use a separate test package<br/>\nfor the unit tests. <br/>\n-) In various documents linked on the JUnit homepage (e.g. JUnit bets<br/>\npractices) they propose to keep the unit tests in the package of the<br/>\nclasses to be tested. <br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally I like the separate package more, as I don&#39;t want to ship<br/>\nthe unit tests with the project. At no costs I want to manually<br/>\nexclude the test classes during shipment. Addiditonally I simply find<br/>\nthis approach more structured - in our last project we had for each<br/>\npackage a .test package. <br/>\nThe separate package however has the main drawback for me that I cant<br/>\ntest package private methods. This forces me to make more methods<br/>\npublic than I want just for testing purposes. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat are your experiences and preferences in this area ? <br/>\n<br/>\nChris Lewold</div>",
