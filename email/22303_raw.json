If I override the\nrunChild method, how do I find the test class (so I can find its ClassLoader)?\nThe javadocs say that runChild runs &quot;the test corresponding to child&quot;, but\n&quot;child&quot; isn&#39;t a parameter.  I assume it means the test corresponding to\n&quot;runner&quot;, but I don&#39;t see how to get from &quot;runner&quot; to the test class.\n\nDo I need to implement my own Runner, and thus my own RunnerBuilder?\nI&#39;m not sure how to connect all these pieces together.\n\nI suppose I could create a delegating RunnerBuilder to wrap the one\nI&#39;m given, and have it replace the Runners with delegating Runners\nthat can also remember the class that the Runner was created for,\nbut is there a better way?\n\nIf I assume the runner is always going to be a ParentRunner, I can use\nparent.getTestClass().getJavaClass() to get what I want.  But how safe\nis it to assume that the runner will always be a ParentRunner?\n\n",
