I would like to run a Junit test that tests \na few methods of this class but I do not want to make the constructor \npublic and I would rather avoid creating a mock object to pass to the \nstatic factory because this could take some time to develop.  What is \nthe best way to handle this?\n\n\n\n\n\n",
