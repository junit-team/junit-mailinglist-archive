Put all the test classes (mock object, test utilities, whatever other than the real code) into a separate folder (I called it &#39;test&#39; and it is in the same\nfolder as &#39;src&#39;).\n\n2. Follow a naming convention.  I named all my test cases and ONLY my test cases with &#39;Test&#39; followed by the class to be tested.\n\n3. I wrote a class that will go through the &#39;test&#39; folder (recursively by option) and find all the java files start with a Test, construct the full name of\nthe class, create a TestSuite for it and add it to the main TestSuite.\n\nStep one will free me in naming the classes for the application, step two will make the testcase sweeping easy.\n\nPotential risks:\n1. Test class is not in &#39;test&#39; directory.\n2. Test class doesn&#39;t start with &#39;Test&#39; or some non-testing class starts with &#39;Test&#39;.\n3. The source file in test directory doesn&#39;t match the ones in classes path.  (This is not a big problem as along as you compile the project before you run\nthe test, which is the case).\n\nIt sounds a little cheap and un-safe at the first sight.  But it has never caused me problems.  I would think that this is the &#39;simplest possible that\nworks&#39;.\n\nAnd yes, I do have a test case for this. :)\n\n\n&quot;Di Iorio, Matthew (ISS Atlanta)&quot; wrote:\n\n&gt; TestFinderSuite is a TestSuite that does the same thing:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=420299&group_id=152\n&gt; 78&atid=315278\n&gt;\n&gt; Source code:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://sourceforge.net/tracker/download.php?group_id=15278&atid=315278&file_\n&gt; id=8476&aid=420299\n&gt;\n&gt; ClassFinder is the class that compiles a list of classes on the classpath.\n&gt;\n&gt; Matt\n&gt;\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Matt Munz [mailto:mattmunz@...]\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, October 03, 2001 4:06 PM\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: [junit] ClassPathTestCollector\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi all.\n&gt;\n&gt;   I&#39;m working on a TestRunner that sweeps up all of the TestCases on the\n&gt; class path into one TestSuite and then runs it, dumping the results\n&gt; optionally to a file, System.out, or a gui.  This TestRunner could then be\n&gt; used in automation and during development with a minimum of setup.\n&gt;   ClassPathTestCollector does a great job of grabbing up the .class files on\n&gt; the class path, but it doesn&#39;t dip into the jars to grab those classes also.\n&gt; I&#39;m about to write some code to add this functionality.  Has anyone already\n&gt; done this?  If so, could you share code, ideas, or suggestions?\n&gt;   Thanks.\n&gt;\n&gt;   - Matt Munz\n&gt;     mmunz@...
