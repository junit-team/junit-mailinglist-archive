Both are put together into an ear for deployment <br/>\nto the app server. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d much prefer to keep the build process and structure for the unit <br/>\ntest ears as similar to the production ears as possible. This means <br/>\n*not* packaging everything under WEB-INF/lib, but keeping our current <br/>\nstructure. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d like to use the Smart Test Mode, but have resorted to the <br/>\ntestCase.txt file route. I can get it to pick up the txt file and <br/>\ndisplay it, but can&#39;t get it to find the associated test cases as <br/>\nthey&#39;re in the ejb.jar. I&#39;d prefer to use the Smart Test mode for <br/>\nease of use. So, how do I spec the path within the searchResources <br/>\ntarget ?, ie :<br/>\n      &lt;param-name&gt;searchResources&lt;/param-name&gt;<br/>\n      &lt;param-value&gt;test.jar&lt;/param-value&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance for any help<br/>\n<br/>\nScott</div>",
