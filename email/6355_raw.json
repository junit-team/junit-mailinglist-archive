Admittedly, \nthis chapter was borne out of my own worst performance fears coming true \nover the years.  I&#39;ve rolled the dice with premature optimizations. The \nhouse won. I&#39;ve cast scalability to the wind hoping that by some miracle \nthe whiz-bang technology would scale. It didn&#39;t. I&#39;ve thrash-tuned until \nthere were no more levers to pull, then I did it again. Alas, I never \ncaught my tail. And yes, despite my crusade for automation, I&#39;ve spent \nway too much time manually running performance tests. I often think of \nwhat I could have done with that time. Perhaps this chapter will spare \nsome folks from those battle scars.\n\nYou can download these chapters at no cost, though it does require that \nyou create an account on TSS.  In return, we would very much appreciate \nyour feedback. By all means, please make any corrections, propose \nenhancements, or tell us about EJB antipatterns that we may have missed.\n\nThanks in advance, and enjoy!\n\n&lt;/shameless plug&gt;\n\nMike\n\n-- \nMike Clark\nhttp://clarkware.com \n(720) 851-2014\n\n\n\n",
