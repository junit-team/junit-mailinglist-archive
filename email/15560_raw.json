So, I have modified testA, which directly tests classA, but \n&gt; don&#39;t realize that I have broken something in testC.  My solution is \n&gt; that we run nightlybuilds, and I check the errors/failures the next \n&gt; morning to see if my code changes could have caused any of them.\n&gt; \n&gt; It would be nice to be a little more proactive, though,...being able to \n&gt; (easily) find all the tests that are ultimately affected by my code \n&gt; change (iterating through the workspace references until I terminate at \n&gt; all classes that start with &quot;Test&quot;, or that are in my test branch).  I \n&gt; know that I can do this manually through Eclipse, but it is not fun - \n&gt; and therefore doesn&#39;t get done.\n\nWhy can&#39;t you just run all the tests?\n\nWhy are there so many dependencies on class A? I would break some \ndependencies by inserting interfaces, that way, if you just make sure \nclass A continues to respect the contracts of its various interfaces, \nthen the impact is contained. That&#39;s the point of interfaces (and the \nLiskov Substitution Principle, and indeed, OOP).\n-- \nJ. B.
