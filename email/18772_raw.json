If your codebase is dozens of 1000 line files of\n&gt; function-less sp=\r\naghetti code maintained by mulitple programmers across\n&gt; multiple teams in =\r\nvarious geographical locations... You (and your\n&gt; organization) have a lot =\r\nof work ahead of you before you can push TDD. \n&gt;...\n\nHi Gabriel.\n\nJust to b=\r\ne clear, I was not restricting my argument to TDD infection.\nI believe that=\r\n the TDD1 gene, let&#39;s call it that, is considerably more\nrare than the T1 g=\r\nene. At this point in time I&#39;d be thrilled to see\nthe majority of developer=\r\ns writing and running unit tests on a regular\nbasis; whether they write the=\r\nm before, during, or after the code is\ndone. At this stage of the game test=\r\n-first is less important than\nhaving the tests in the first place - gotta w=\r\nalk before you run.\n\nI agree that most projects out there consist of 1,000s=\r\n of classes with\nno tests.  I love Michael Feathers&#39;s definition: code with=\r\nout tests =3D=3D\nlegacy code.  This definition makes 95%+ of Java code lega=\r\ncy code. \n&quot;Legacy code, is not just COBOL anymore&quot; :-).\n\nSeriously, I can, =\r\nand do, sympathize that sometimes the task looks\n&quot;monumental and even prohi=\r\nbitive&quot;. But only if you think that you have\nto go from zero tests to 1,000=\r\ns of tests right away.  I don&#39;t know why\nmany people think in terms of all-=\r\nor-nothing when it comes to testing.\nYou have to start somewhere, and somet=\r\nhing is better than nothing. \n10,000 Java classes and 1 JUnit test is bette=\r\nr than 10,000 Java\nclasses and 0 JUnit tests.  2 tests are better than 1, a=\r\nnd so\nforth.  And look at the bright side, at least those 2 tests will run\n=\r\nquickly.\n\nIf you are stuck in a project like the one you describe, it&#39;s pro=\r\nbably\ncounter-motivating to even look at metrics like\nnumberOfTests/numberO=\r\nfClasses, or code coverage: &quot;Hey, we achieved 5%\ncode coverage. Where&#39;s the=\r\n Champagne?&quot;.  Instead focus on the absolute\nnumber of tests (a simple, pos=\r\nitive, monotonically growing test metric).\n\nWhile the &quot;monumental pile of u=\r\nntested spaghetti code&quot; does not help,\nI believe a lot of people just use t=\r\nhat as an excuse to not get\nstarted. I have seen developers rejecting regul=\r\nar unit testing even in\ngreenfield projects, so there is something more fun=\r\ndamental at play.\n\nAlberto\n\nhttp://www.junitfactory.com\nGenerate JUnit test=\r\ns.
