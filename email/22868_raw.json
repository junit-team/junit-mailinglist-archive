Will futur=\r\ne JUnit version continue to ship with Hamcrest?\n\nYes, having made this deci=\r\nsion, we&#39;ll stick to it until convinced it&#39;s\ndoing more harm than good.\n\n&gt; =\r\nDo you have plans to update to Hamcrest 1.2 or higher?\n\nUnfortunately, the =\r\nlast time we looked at the typing changes in\nHamcrest 1.2, we found that we=\r\n couldn&#39;t automatically upgrade people\nwithout changing compiling tests int=\r\no non-compiling tests, and, if I\nremember, in a few pathological cases, pas=\r\nsing tests into failing\ntests.  We guessed that of people who used the hamc=\r\nrest features\nbundled with JUnit, there were more that would be hurt by a v=\r\nersion\nchange than would be helped by it, so we&#39;ve stayed here.\n\n&gt; Why is t=\r\nhere no junit-dep anymore, i.e. how are we supposed to use JUnit with Hamcr=\r\nest 1.2?\n\njunit-dep has been up on github for every release.  Whoever has b=\r\neen\nputting JUnit up on maven, I take it, hasn&#39;t been also putting up\njunit=\r\n-dep?  I&#39;m sorry to say that I&#39;m very aware that a lot of people\nare indebt=\r\ned to the anonymous time-donor who&#39;d been keeping the maven\nrepos up-to-dat=\r\ne until several months ago.  I&#39;ve been reluctant to\naccept full responsibil=\r\nity for feeding a repository I neither use nor\nfully understand until some =\r\npoint where I was sure I could quickly\nrespond to millions of users who got=\r\n their junit jars auto-updated in\na way that broke all their tests.  This m=\r\night be overly cautious of\nme.\n\n   David Saff\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; Peter\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
