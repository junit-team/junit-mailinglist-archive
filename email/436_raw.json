At least one of the tools I\nevaluated used source code rewriting and basically did what your tech\nlead proposed you do manually. Personally, I think you&#39;d be nuts to do\nit manually. At the very least, grab a Java parser and rewrite it to\nspit out instrumented Java source.\n\nI don&#39;t think any of the tools would detect the situation where an\nException is not caught in the code and no test caused it to be thrown.\nThis might happen with either RuntimeException or with a method that\ndeclares some exceptions in its throw clause and allows them to\npropagate up. In fact, I&#39;m pretty sure one can&#39;t detect that in the\ngeneral case.\n\ne.g. the code below if never called with null foo, could still result\nin 100% coverage. The theoretical way to handle this in the coverage\ntool is to add an edge to the control flow graph for each possible\nexception, but since RuntimeException and Error aren&#39;t declared in the\nthrows clause....\n\npublic void mightGetNullPointerException(Object foo) {\n  if (foo.equals(this.myFoo)) {\n    // ...\n  }\n}\n\nRegards,\n\nRob\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nGet personalized email addresses from Yahoo!
