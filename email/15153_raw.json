I&#39;d do this most often in exception\n&gt; handling code, where I don&#39;t have strong customer input about the right\n&gt; thing to do, but still want to have defined behavior.\n&gt;\n&gt; On the other hand, if adding the exit was because of an explicit\n&gt; customer request or bug report, I&#39;d probably add a shell script to my\n&gt; system (&quot;customer&quot;) tests, outside of JUnit, to make sure that I&#39;d\n&gt; captured the bug and the fix. I haven&#39;t done this for System.exit yet,\n&gt; but I have for other behavior only observable from the command line.\n&gt;\n&gt; David Saff\n&gt;\n&gt;\nThat&#39;s in agreement with what I&#39;m saying. I&#39;m trusting that System.exit(status)\ndoes what it says on the tin, and I just want to test that it gets called at\nthe appropriate time. I realise there are occasions when an element of the\ncore Java classes has a bug in it - Elliotte, I think you&#39;ve talked about\ncharacterset handling in different versions of Java on one of your cafe\nsites. I would consider that problem outside the scope of my control, raise\na bug and look for an alternative way of providing the necessary\nfunctionality.\n\nJames\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
