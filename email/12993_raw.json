Having done some reading\non the use of the Java &quot;assert&quot; statement, I was curious if anyone\nhere had a strong conviction about using or not using it with unit\ntesting.\n\nAssuming that I would only be using the assert statement in non-public\nmethods (public methods would throw a meaningful exception), shouldn&#39;t\nI be writing unit tests to basically assert the same post or pre\nconditions that the assert keyword could be used for?\n\nMy only argument for using them at this point would be to assert the\nvalidity of arguments to a method; non-null, etc...\n\nHas this been discussed ad nauseam elsewhere that I should just\nreview? &lt;grin&gt;\n\nThanks for your time,\nTim Kuntz\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
