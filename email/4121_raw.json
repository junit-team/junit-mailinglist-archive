I have\n&gt; reported the bug to SUN, but they directed here, since this behaviour\ndoes\n&gt; not occur in a simple standalone class.\n&gt;\n&gt; Attached is the unit test that I ran, as well as the output.  Note\n&gt; especially the third line:\n&gt;\n&gt;     Class Byte:  Success means that 128 &gt; 127\n&gt;\n&gt; What I have found is that when a byte variable is defined as a class\n&gt; variable within a unit test and then incremented, it is possible to\n&gt; increment it out of the range of bytes specified by the language\n&gt; specification in two aspects:\n&gt;\n&gt; 1 - Converting the byte to a string results in the string &quot;128&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; 2 - Comparation states that the byte is larger than Byte.MAX_VALUE\n&gt;     ( (classByte &gt; Byte.MAX_VALUE) is true )\n&gt;\n&gt; As the log shows, this test passes in my setup, and I have tried it on\n&gt; several computers.  Could someone in the know run this test and see if\nyou\n&gt; can figure out what is going on, because I am totally lost in this.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks and regards,\n&gt;\n&gt; Magnus Torfason\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Testsuite: StrangeByteTest\n&gt; Tests run: 4, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Time elapsed: 0,01 sec\n&gt; ------------- Standard Output ---------------\n&gt;     Local Byte:  Success means that -128 == -128\n&gt;     Static Byte: Success means that -128 == -128\n&gt;     Class Byte:  Success means that 128 &gt; 127\n&gt;     Class Short: Success means that 32768 &gt; 32767\n&gt; ------------- ---------------- ---------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Testcase: testLocalByteBehaviour took 0 sec\n&gt; Testcase: testStaticByteBehaviour took 0 sec\n&gt; Testcase: testByteMaxValue took 0 sec\n&gt; Testcase: testShortMaxValue took 0 sec\n&gt;\n&gt;       Yahoo!
