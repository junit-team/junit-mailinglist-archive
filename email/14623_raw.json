Some of \n&gt; them I trust. Some of them I don&#39;t. They range in skill levels from \n&gt; extremely experienced, wise, knowledgeable developers like Michael Kay \n&gt; to random undergraduates and unreconstructed COBOL hacks.\n\nSo, to make it clear, you&#39;re building an API for external use, which\nyou have no control over.\n\n&gt; I promise that the \n&gt; library behaves in a certain way under certain conditions and \n&gt; accomplishes certain tasks. I can do this only because my libraries are \n&gt; designed around concrete classes. Were the library designed around \n&gt; interfaces instead, I could no no longer make such promises. \n\nAs you said earlier, the conditions that you can promise this include\nthat no-one has been playing silly buggers with your code base. Why\ncan you not extend that to include that they should not write their\nown implementations?\n\nFurthermore, I would argue that by not providing interfaces, you may\nwell be making the life of the 3rd-party developers more difficult. \n\nRobert.\n\n\n\n\n",
