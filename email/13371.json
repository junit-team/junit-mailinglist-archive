I&#39;ve learned alot from this thread.  And - I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; ordered JUnit Recipes from Amazon.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Mmmmm.... beer....<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Having just started with JUnit and with the idea of writing tests for<br/>\n&gt; all of my code, I must say that I&#39;m delighted with the results.  Oh -<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m not writing much new code.  Most of the unit tests are for code<br/>\n&gt; that already exists for which I&#39;m fixing bugs.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Good luck with that. I strongly recommend you also try to test-drive a <br/>\nbunch of code, because that will teach you the goal for refactoring the <br/>\nlegacy stuff. If you don&#39;t know where you&#39;re going, how do you know you <br/>\ngot there?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I really can&#39;t imagine going back to not writing tests.  Now the thing<br/>\n&gt; I need to do next is figure out how to build support for running a<br/>\n&gt; suite of tests as part of our build process and getting our other<br/>\n&gt; developers to create and run tests, too.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If I write too much code without tests, I feel physical symptoms, like <br/>\ntightness in my chest. One day it&#39;ll be a heart attack, but for now it&#39;s <br/>\ngarden-variety anxiety. Of course, I&#39;m a bit of a nut.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
