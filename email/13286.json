The primary problem is relationships between entities <br/>\nin the data set. I might have to add a few Contracts to test the next <br/>\nfeature, but then I need a new Agent or Department or something, and <br/>\nthat affects the expected results in tests related to those entities.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I&#39;ve done it -- three times was enough to learn for good -- the <br/>\ncost ended up being higher than expected and rose as the project went <br/>\non, which is rarely a good sign.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; To only use real test data has big disadvantages in my opinion:<br/>\n&gt; - if data changes (real data does), then tests break<br/>\n&gt; - you need much more real data than test data to cover all the<br/>\n&gt; boundaries and use cases<br/>\n&gt; - if you add real data or remove real data from the dataset, tests<br/>\n&gt; might break<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What do you think about it?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think real data is good, because real data is often stranger than <br/>\nmade-up test data. I think one dataset for all tests is a mistake -- a <br/>\nbig mistake.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
