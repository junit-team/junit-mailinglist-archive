For example under eclipse \nthe\n&gt; &gt;  current folder (=\r\n.) is not on the classpath, so you have addapt \nthe\n&gt; &gt;  test to the IDE co=\r\nnfiguration. I know this can be done very easy\n&gt; &gt;  using Ant, but I don&#39;t =\r\nwant to impose to use such tools for this\n&gt; &gt;  particular example.\n&gt; \n&gt; Act=\r\nually, I don&#39;t need to modify the classpath by hand because \nunder\n&gt; Eclips=\r\ne the source folders are in the class path. For example, you \ncan\n&gt; do the =\r\nfollowing successfully in your tests:\n&gt; \n&gt; getClass().getResource(&quot;/com/acm=\r\ne/stuff/testdata.txt&quot;);\n&gt; \n&gt; ...which will give you access to the testdata.=\r\ntxt file you&#39;ve \nplaced\n&gt; under your source directory:\n&gt; \n&gt; ${basedir}/src/=\r\ncom/acme/stuff/testdata.txt\n&gt; \n&gt; Or maybe I misunderstood what you meant?\n\n=\r\nDear Lasse,\n\nI have the opossite problem, I would like to create a file dur=\r\ning \nthe testing process on some place on the classpath. What I would \nlike=\r\n is to know for sure a place that will be always on classpath \n(such place =\r\ndoesn&#39;t exist, it depends on IDE&#39;s). After the test I \nwill delete the file=\r\n. Becuse, there is no universal place that will \nbe always on classpath, an=\r\nother solution would be to add a place \ndinamycally on classpath during the=\r\n test, that was the reason of my \noriginal post.\n\nYour suggestion requires =\r\nto have at the begining of the test to have \na certain file on the classpat=\r\nh. Such information you have assuming \nyou are using Eclipse IDE, because t=\r\nhe source files are on \nclasspath, but you have to assume that some particu=\r\nlar folders are \non classpath.\n\nI show you now on my test (it works because=\r\n I assume \nSystem.getProperty(&quot;user.dir&quot;)/bin in on classpath. What I prefe=\r\nr is \nto add location (dinamycally) of: System.getProperty\n(&quot;java.io.tmpdir=\r\n&quot;) on classpath,\nthen create a file and at the end of execution to set the =\r\nclasspath \ninto original value and also delete the temporary file.\n\npublic =\r\nclass TestFileUtils extends TestCase {\n\n    final String testFileName =3D &quot;=\r\nfileInClassPath.txt&quot;;\n\n    final String parent =3D &quot;bin&quot;;\n    \n    final st=\r\natic File TMP_DIR =3D new File(&quot;bin&quot;);\n\n    /**\n     * {@link com.b2b2000.F=\r\nileUtils#findFileInClasspath\n(java.lang.String)}.\n     * \n     * Note: We a=\r\nssume: {@linkplain System#getProperty(String) \nSystem.getProperty(&quot;user.dir=\r\n&quot;)/bin}  is on &lt;code&gt;classpath&lt;/code&gt;.\n     * \n     */\n    public void test=\r\nFindFileInClasspath() throws Exception {\n        File newFile =3D new File(=\r\nTMP_DIR, testFileName);\n        newFile.createNewFile();\n        modifyClas=\r\nspath();\n        File foundFile =3D FileUtils.findFileInClasspath(testFileN=\r\name);\n        assertEquals(newFile.getAbsoluteFile(), \nfoundFile.getAbsolut=\r\neFile());\n    }\n\n    protected void setUp() throws Exception {\n        modi=\r\nfyClasspath();\n        File newFile =3D new File(TMP_DIR, testFileName);\n  =\r\n      if (newFile.exists()) {\n            if (!newFile.delete()) {\n        =\r\n        throw new FileNotFoundException(newFile.toString());\n\n            }=\r\n\n        }\n        super.setUp();\n    }\n\n    protected void tearDown() thro=\r\nws Exception {\n        File file =3D new File(TMP_DIR, testFileName);\n     =\r\n   file.deleteOnExit();\n        super.tearDown();\n    }\n}\n\nThanks in advanc=\r\ne,\n\nDavid\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Lasse\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; Lasse Koskela\n&gt; * Author of &quot;Test Driven&quot; =\r\n(Manning Publications, 2007) *\n&gt; * Reaktor Innovations * http://www.ri.fi/e=\r\nn *\n&gt;\n\n\n\n",
