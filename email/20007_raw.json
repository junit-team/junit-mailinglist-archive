I have came \nacross various tools including XJB, EJBUnit, Embedde=\r\nd Jboss, Cactus, etc..  I am just \nwondering which solution is the most mat=\r\nure and most supported by the community.  I need \nto be able to mock up JND=\r\nI so that I can test the persistance in my EJB&#39;s.  I would like to test \nou=\r\ntside the container as I hear this is the best method for testing EJBs.  Ca=\r\nn anyone give me \nsome suggestions and point me in the right direction.  An=\r\ny help would be greatly appreciate, \na tutorial anything that will help get=\r\n me started.  I would preferable like a solution that can fit \ninto a night=\r\n build and test enviornment.  We use Continuum to build and test our compan=\r\nies \ncode everynight.  If I could drive the EJB test cases from a Maven pom=\r\n that would be a bonus.\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nVince\n\n\n",
