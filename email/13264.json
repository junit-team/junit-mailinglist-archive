My hierachical requirement is<br/>\n&gt; moved out as hierarchical helpers that are creating test<br/>\n&gt; objects (similar to ObjectMother pattern suggested by IIja).. how<br/>\n&gt; does it sound..? <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Doesn&#39;t sound ideal, but like it&#39;s probably the best you can do if you don&#39;t<br/>\nwant to touch the app&#39;s design.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt; Let us not question the design for testing..<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I didn&#39;t mean to be rude here.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No rudeness implied. Still, please notice that not wanting to question the<br/>\napp&#39;s design when encountering testing problems is unlikely to lead to<br/>\noptimal results. Problems in test design most often just are a result of<br/>\nsuboptimal app design.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; But I wanted to imply that<br/>\n&gt; the app design is done this way for various reasons.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Certainly. I&#39;d bet, though, that it&#39;s possible to find a design that<br/>\nconforms to both the needs of testing and those other reasons, and that most<br/>\nexperienced OO developers would say that such a design is better.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; But the<br/>\n&gt; tests has to be written around the existing app design.  The<br/>\n&gt; issue in question was the test design not the app design.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Then the issue is how to write unit tests for a suboptimally designed app. I<br/>\nhope you can now understand why Junit doesn&#39;t strive to support that very<br/>\nwell out of the box - most Junit practitioners simply prefer to improve the<br/>\napp&#39;s design in those cases.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers, Ilja</div>",
