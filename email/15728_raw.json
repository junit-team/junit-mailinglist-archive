So from time to time, =\r\nin this area \n&gt; something may go wrong. Therefore I&#39;m looking for a tool, \n=\r\n&gt; that generates a report showing only the differences between \n&gt; current a=\r\nnd last JUnit report - which failing tests were \n&gt; fixed, which tests stopp=\r\ned to pass, which tests were added \n&gt; and which removed. Additionaly a test=\r\n trend analysis should \n&gt; be possible.\n&gt; \n&gt; I know, parsing the XML junitre=\r\nport output and generating the \n&gt; info, e.g., with the help of a database, =\r\nwould be possible. \n&gt; But is anyone aware of an existing tool or open sourc=\r\ne \n&gt; project that can help in this direction?\n&gt; \n&gt; --Klaus\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo!
