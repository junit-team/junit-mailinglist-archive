I \nusually have the full suite of tests running on one or more other \nplatforms in order to parallelize the testing as well as ensure \ncross-platform consistency.\n\nTest timing considerations aside, I think it&#39;d be valuable to have a \ntool automatically track some sort of test levelization.  I am \nintimately familiar with the code, but I still don&#39;t keep *everything* \nin my head and when it comes to tracking complex interdependencies, the \ncomputer does (or should do) it much better than I can.  That&#39;s why \nwe&#39;ve got compilers, yes?\n\nOn Jul 19, 2004, at 6:11 AM, Chris Dollin wrote:\n\n&gt; On Saturday 17 July 2004 05:03, J. B.

It usually takes a\n&gt;&gt;&gt; noticeable time to run them all.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Can you quantify this? GSBase, for example, runs tests at \n&gt;&gt; approximately\n&gt;&gt; 100/second, and that&#39;s my usual performance goal for tests. On my most\n&gt;&gt; recent project, I separated tests that required expensive, external\n&gt;&gt; resources (there were about 10) from tests than ran entirely in memory\n&gt;&gt; (there were about 400). The in-memory tests ran in about 6 seconds.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Is this &quot;noticeable&quot; by your standards? I&#39;d merely like some extra \n&gt;&gt; context.\n&gt;\n&gt; Data point from over here:\n&gt;\n&gt; Running the Jena test suite in Eclipse takes approx 50 seconds on my \n&gt; 2Gb\n&gt; 3GHz machine. (Hmm, missing some stuff there - must sort out the\n&gt; proxy settings). More like 40s outside Eclipse (and with a working \n&gt; proxy).\n&gt;\n&gt; I used to run with a 0.8GHz supposedly-dula processor and we were \n&gt; talking\n&gt; more like 120s. (The database tests are separate and take 60s seconds\n&gt; to run, for mySQL on Linux at least - at one point it was more like \n&gt; 20minutes,\n&gt; argh scream; I suspect there aren&#39;t enough of them.)\n&gt;\n&gt; The test suite is rather a hotchpotch, as it contains ancient tests \n&gt; from\n&gt; before our more systematic use of JUnit which are more like acceptance\n&gt; tests than unit tests, but them&#39;s what we have. Usually I run the \n&gt; tests for\n&gt; the bit I&#39;m tinkering with at a moments provocation and run the full \n&gt; suite\n&gt; when I reach some kind of anchor point - the necessity for loading or\n&gt; unloading tea, the final new feature working, or Oh My Stars Has It \n&gt; Been\n&gt; An Hour?!\n&gt;\n&gt; -- \n&gt; Chris &quot;Jena RDF HP&quot; Dollin\n&gt; C FAQs at: http://www.faqs.org/faqs/by-newsgroup/comp/comp.lang.c.html\n&gt; C welcome: http://www.angelfire.com/ms3/bchambless0/welcome_to_clc.html\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
