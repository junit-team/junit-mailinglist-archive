That normally \n&gt;indicates=\r\n someone is trying to get more data out of JUnit tests than \n&gt;they&#39;re reall=\r\ny intended to produce. It&#39;s even worse if these statements \n&gt;print when the=\r\n tests are passing as well as failing. In this case, \n&gt;actual failures are =\r\nlikely to get swamped by the usual output and may \n&gt;well not be noticed, es=\r\npecially when running from Ant or the \n&gt;textui.TestRunner so there&#39;s no red=\r\n bar. Honestly I think the standard \n&gt;Ant JUnit task produces too much outp=\r\nut already. I only want to see \n&gt;tests that failed. I want line of output a=\r\nt most if all tests passed.\n&gt;\n&gt;-- \n&gt;Elliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@metalab.u=\r\nnc.edu\n\n\nI appreciate the recent comments to my post, you all have given me=\r\n good food\nfor thought, and I am coming around to the &quot;test everything repr=\r\noducibly&quot;\npoint of view.\n\nI confess that I have some System.out.println() s=\r\ntatements in my test cases.\nPartly it is to see which random cases were gen=\r\nerated, and I see the point\nthat I shouldn&#39;t have to scan the output.  Howe=\r\nver, at least I&#39;m sure the\ntests are running the way I think they should be=\r\n running!  I distrust\ncomputers and software greatly, so I&#39;m always trying =\r\nto check up on what I\nthink is going on... this is doubly true when I&#39;m usi=\r\nng new (for me)\nsoftware like Junit.\n\nHow do you Junit veterans assure your=\r\nself that a test is actually running\nand doing what it should be doing?\n\n--=\r\nErikN\n\n\n\n\n\n",
