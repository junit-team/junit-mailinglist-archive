Depending\n  &gt; &gt; on the input argument it executes one thing or the other. The\n  &gt; &gt; problem is\n  &gt; &gt; that on my main(String[] args) method at the end or when it\n  &gt; &gt; founds an error,\n  &gt; &gt; the method System.exit() is invoked. So when I define jUnit test cases\n  &gt; &gt; (methods with prefix test), jUnits only runs the first test,\n  &gt; &gt; because some\n  &gt; &gt; System.exit() was invoked.\n  &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt; Is there any way to test such kind of situations?\n\n  In general I second the suggestions made by Bernd and J. B.\n  Rainsberger.  However, that said, I think you /can/ test this as it\n  currently is coded by using a security manager.  If you run the JUnit\n  test runner with a security manager present, and specify a security\n  policy that doesn&#39;t allow the application code to call System.exit(),\n  then what /should/ happen is that when the code calls System.exit(), a\n  SecurityException will be thrown.  You can catch that in your test code.\n\n  To me this sounds like it would be more effort than following Bernd or\n  J.B.&#39;s recommendations, but I thought I&#39;d mention it anyway in case you\n  (or someone else) want to give it a try.\n\n  Cheers,\n\n  bn\n\n\n\n        Yahoo!
