I know the issues, and I&#39;m not <br/>\ntrying to force you to type too much.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Just like the test name often needs further clarification (never pass<br/>\n&gt; up an oportunity for documentation), often the reason for the<br/>\n&gt; assertion is not self-apparent.  You can try to argue that &quot;it ought<br/>\n&gt; to be, or rewrite your code!&quot; but, as before, I think you&#39;re straying<br/>\n&gt; too close to the &quot;Java code is self-documenting&quot; argument, which I<br/>\n&gt; find ... dubious at best.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know. I just wrote this in an XHTMLUnit test today:<br/>\n<br/>\nassertXpathExists(<br/>\n     somewhereThereIsA(formNamed(&quot;demographics&quot;))<br/>\n     .eventuallyContainingA(textFieldNamed(&quot;firstName&quot;)), document);<br/>\n<br/>\nThis translated to the XPath expression<br/>\n<br/>\n     //form[@name=&quot;demographics&quot;]//input[@type=&quot;text&quot; and @name=&quot;firstName&quot;]<br/>\n<br/>\nIs a comment or a failure message going to make that clearer?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It makes your test reports clearer when failures occur  I prefer to<br/>\n&gt; see &quot;Wrong number of Login attempts recorded ...&quot; rather than<br/>\n&gt; &quot;testValidLogin.assertEquals failed ... &quot;  As a result I often don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; even have to look at the test code to fix the problem.  Without<br/>\n&gt; messages, I have to at the very least go and look to see what the<br/>\n&gt; assertion&#39;s variables are named before I can begin fixing the problem.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You&#39;re right: it would be nice if the failure message reported the name <br/>\nof the variable in this case.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It&#39;s also easier to write a short sentence about what&#39;s being asserted<br/>\n&gt; than it is to be sure that you&#39;ve chosen values and variable names<br/>\n&gt; such that future readers can divine their purpose.  That&#39;s a valuable<br/>\n&gt; task as well, but for the time involved, there&#39;s no reason you can&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; write a little text as well.  Or to put it pithily:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I feel that I&#39;m proficient with Java, but when I want to explain<br/>\n&gt; something, especially *why* something, I generally prefer English.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I agree and explain &quot;why&quot; in English, but nost of the time, test case <br/>\nclass name, method name and line number is enough for me to know what <br/>\nfailed, from which I generally can determine why it failed. If not, then <br/>\nmy tests are too big (and that&#39;s an entirely different problem).<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
