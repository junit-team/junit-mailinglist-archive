Maybe a set of tests in a<br/>\nsuite share some set up and tear down stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat it looks like here is your tests are dependent on a nightly job<br/>\nto run and worst their order.  It has always been my understanding<br/>\nthat each test is order independent.  I remember early on stuff saying<br/>\nthat one was not guaranteed what order the tests would run in.<br/>\nGranted I think this randomization was never done, but it was made to<br/>\nshow a concept.  The concept being, a person should be able to run a<br/>\ngiven failed test over and over (with some of source under test having<br/>\nmodifications) until it passes.  There should not be a whole series of<br/>\nsteps that have to run in order to get a single test to pass.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can speak from experience, requiring a procedure of tests to run<br/>\ninorder to get the desired results leads to tests that are turned off<br/>\nor forgotten about.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have some questions...<br/>\n<br/>\nAre you testing the nightly job?<br/>\nCould the initialization for Test2.myTest() actually be setup in a<br/>\nsetup method?  --Then no need to rely on the nightly job.<br/>\n<br/>\nsomething you should consider...<br/>\n- &quot;Ideally, each test case is independent from the others&quot; --<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_Test\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_Test</a><br/>\n-- Along these lines, the results of one test should not dictate the<br/>\nresults of another.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope I added some insight,<br/>\n<br/>\nBig Mike<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Fri, Aug 14, 2009 at 11:21 PM, trenton_adams2001&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:trenta@...\">trenta@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Hi Guys,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m just wondering.  Have the JUnit developers considered adding dependency annotations to JUnit?  You could annotate your code with say<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;@TestDependency Test1 public void myTest() {code;}&quot;, which would cause myTest() to depend on Test1 running it&#39;s tests first.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; A scenario where this might be needed...<br/>\n&gt; 1. Test1 inserts DB records<br/>\n&gt; 2. Nightly job runs (but can be run manually by user)<br/>\n&gt; 3. Test2.myTest() then runs, as #2 has completed, and myTest() now has data that can be used.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In the case of #2, it would need to give the user enough time to run the nightly job, manually.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m wanting to test everything in a totally automated way.  But at this point, it is not entirely possible.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I just wanted to ask about this, as you guys probably have a lot more experience in why this is or is not a good idea.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
