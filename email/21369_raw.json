The idea might be totally flawed.\n\nGreetings,\n   Malte\n\n\nyme0987654321 wrote:\n&gt; My plan for desktop running was to have a seperate IDEA run\n&gt; configuration that sets the system parameter, so developers can always\n&gt; pick which one to run.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regarding using a custom runner, I&#39;m not sure how your suggestion\n&gt; differs from what I am doing. I suppose we could start looking at a\n&gt; custom Request object that returns a runner that is never intended to\n&gt; be used with the @RunWith annotation, but rather delegates run\n&gt; building on each class. But I&#39;m not sure that IDEA or ant support a\n&gt; custom Request object, or how you would get them to use it.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In junit@yahoogroups.com, Malte Finsterwalder &lt;malte@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; yme0987654321 wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; In answer to your second question, basically the slow tests would run\n&gt;&gt;&gt; at check in, or during the general build process, whereas the fast\n&gt;&gt;&gt; test would just be part of the TDD of making sure everything is green.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; For point of comparison, the slow tests are currently 1/2 hour for\n&gt;&gt;&gt; less than 100, and the fast tests are under 60 seconds, even though\n&gt;&gt;&gt; there are about 700 of them.\n&gt;&gt; I understand that reasoning.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; But as you said you want to have several categories:\n&gt;&gt; DB-Tests, In Container Tests, ...\n&gt;&gt; Maybe you should create a runner hat can be parameterized to handle all\n&gt;&gt; these cases?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; And how do you setup the runtime, so that it does run the tests or does\n&gt;&gt; not run the tests on a per run basis?\n&gt;&gt; Setting a system property seams cumbersome to me.\n&gt;&gt; That&#39;s ok for the server, but sometimes I want to run the slow tests on\n&gt;&gt; my desktop too, don&#39;t I?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Maybe we can come up with something better?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Greetings,\n&gt;&gt;    Malte\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
