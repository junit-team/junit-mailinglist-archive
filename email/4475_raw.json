Marz 2002 04:28\nAn: junit@yahoogroups.com\nBetreff: Re: [junit] j2me unit testing\n\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Don&quot; == don quixada &lt;don_quixada&gt; writes:\n\nHi, Don,\n\nSorry I never got back to you. I wonder if your problem is directly\ncreating the MIDlet in your test code. MIDlets are like applets --\nthey expect a lot of other stuff to be in place when they are\ncreated. It is possible that directly creating them, as you did, just\nwon&#39;t work without the rest of that context.\n\nWhat we did, and as I recommend to my clients, is to separate out the\nplumbing logic (the MIDlet) from the business logic. Have the MIDlet\ncreate and call the business logic, but keep that creation logic\nreally simple. Put all the complexity into the business logic classes,\nwhich are a lot easier to test.\n\n    Don&gt; I&#39;d really like to get the textui testrunner working for j2me\n    Don&gt; unit-- let me know how.\n\nOnce I split out the business logic, J2MEUnit just worked for us. This\nincludes the text version as well as the GUI version. Can you test the\nnon-MIDlet logic through J2MEUnit?\n\nbab\n\n--\nBrian Button            bbutton@...\nSenior Consultant       Object Mentor, Inc\nSt. Louis, MO\t\thttp://www.objectmentor.com\n\nExtreme Programming in St. Louis - http://groups.yahoo.com/group/xpstl\n\n\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\njunit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n\n\nYour use of Yahoo!
