If you just tested with integration test you would\nprobably know something is wrong but might not be able to pinpoint where it\nis wrong.  I would think your cost of fixing that error would be lower with\nthe unit test because you don&#39;t have to search for it.  Granted, you could\nprobably do just as well with the integration test, but isn&#39;t reassuring to\nsay I have fully tested all the objects that generate a given page and I\nhave confidence in them.  I think that this is what testing is all about...\nconfidence.  Unit testing gives you confidence in your objects. Integration\ntesting gives you confidence in the interaction between your objects.\n\nMy $.02\n\nMichael\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: news [mailto:news@...]On Behalf Of Mike Bresnahan\nSent: Friday, June 20, 2003 9:54 AM\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: [junit] Unit Testing vs Integration Testing\n\n\nI have experience with integration testing but not much with unit testing.\nI&#39;ve been reading up on unit testing  (e.g. mock objects, test first\ndevelopment).  However, I have not found an article that explains the\nadvantages of unit testing vs integration testing.  My perhaps naive hunch\nis that the cost-per-bug-eliminated of unit testing is higher than that of\nintegration testing.  It appears this way because a single integration test\ntests a lot more code than a single unit test and takes about the same\namount of time to construct.  Plus it seems to me that a whole suite of unit\ntests with 100% code coverage cannot guarantee that even the simplest system\nwide behavior is correct (e.g. the web page appears).  Am I wrong about\nthis?  Can someone refer me information about this topic.  A scientific\nstudy paper with real numbers would be welcome.\n\nMike Bresnahan\n\n\n\n\n\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\njunit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n\n\nYour use of Yahoo!
