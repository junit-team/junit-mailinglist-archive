There were 2-3 messages afew weeks back, &quot;what is junit&quot;,\n&quot;please tell me how to use junit&quot;, etc and I recall at the time being\nsurprised at the energy from some of the responders that went into the\nover the top responses when a single, simple &quot;check the faq&quot; or &quot;go to\ngoogle&quot; would have been sufficient.\n\nAs far as 2 lists go, a lot of the high level stuff goes over my head\nright now, but as I&#39;m going thru my steep learning curve I do have\nmoments where I grasp a new concept and then tie it back in to a post\nthat I&#39;ve seen here on the list and have a lightbulb moment with\nmyself - &quot;ahh, that&#39;s what that post was about&quot;.  So if 2 lists do end\nup splitting out then I&#39;d subscribe to both lists, the newbie to get\nme up to speed, and the advanced list for an investment in my own\nfuture learning.\n\nMy .02\n\nMike\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
