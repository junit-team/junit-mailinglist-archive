This could be \ndone by passing in an instance of the date class in the constructor, or by \nusing setters, but may be neater (especially if you don&#39;t have the luxury of \ndoing TDD) to be able to this external to the tested code.\n\nI&#39;ve not investigated or experimented with the plausibility of this yet, just \nwondering if anybody else has already tried and discounted the idea :-)\n\nCheers\nShez\n\n",
