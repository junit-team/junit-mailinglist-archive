(a pure Java implementati=\r\non for the popular Ruby BDD tool).\n\nCucumber-JVM has some decent JUnit inte=\r\ngration (a custom runner), but there is one little snag making it a little =\r\npainful to use [1]. I have submitted a pull request for that [2].\n\nI realis=\r\ne you have a lot of open tickets, and need to make sure stuff doesn&#39;t break=\r\n. I&#39;m not saying my pull request should be treated any differently than oth=\r\ners. But it would be good to know whether you think it will be in 4.11 and =\r\napproximately when it&#39;s due.\n\nKnowing it&#39;s not likely to be released any ti=\r\nme soon would be helpful too, we&#39;d have to hack our way around it (we&#39;ve tr=\r\nied before - it&#39;s hard).\n\nCheers,\nAslak\n\n[1] https://github.com/KentBeck/ju=\r\nnit/pull/405\n[2] https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-jvm/issues/225\n\n\n",
