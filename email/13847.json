Could you do a little asking around?<br/>\n<br/>\nFailing that, perhaps this group could decide what it really wanted<br/>\nand then make the changes and release a 3.8.2? I mean, it&#39;s not like<br/>\nwe don&#39;t have some of the finest testing brains on the planet around<br/>\nhere (self _not_ included), not to mention some very strong opinions<br/>\n(ok, I&#39;m in this category). Just a wild Friday afternoon kind of<br/>\nthought.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 6/3/05, J. B.

For example, the JUnit Web page seems to have had few<br/>\n&gt; &gt; updates since 2003. And on SourceForge, Erich Gamma and Kent Beck<br/>\n&gt; &gt; responded to some GUI-related RFEs with the comment that because most<br/>\n&gt; &gt; IDEs now handle test running themselves, there&#39;s no point to improving<br/>\n&gt; &gt; JUnit&#39;s own GUI tools. Non-interface bug reports and RFEs have gone<br/>\n&gt; &gt; unassigned unless they&#39;re of very high priority (such as ones related to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; thread safety). Is there simply no real demand for improvements, or has<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the SourceForge bug report page been deprecated?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; That&#39;s an ongoing debate in the community. I honestly believe that the<br/>\n&gt; JUnit framework is closed (in the Open/Closed Principle sense), even if<br/>\n&gt; the test runners are occasionally inadequate. Since I use Eclipse&#39;s test<br/>\n&gt; runner most of the time and Ant&#39;s the rest of the time, that&#39;s not an<br/>\n&gt; issue for me.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; JUnit 4.0, complete with support for Java annotations, is in the works,<br/>\n&gt; but I don&#39;t know any more than that.<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; J.
