Code coverage analysis should be your guide in making <br/>\n    &gt; decisions about<br/>\n    &gt; whether testing through public APIs provide thorough <br/>\n    &gt; enough test coverage<br/>\n    &gt; (80%? 95%?, depending on the quality you&#39;re shooting for <br/>\n    &gt; and (relevant to<br/>\n    &gt; that) the industry you&#39;re in).  Naturally, coverage <br/>\n    &gt; analysis will inform<br/>\n    &gt; your testing decisions, which in turn will likely inform <br/>\n    &gt; your design<br/>\n    &gt; decisions.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well put!  This is something I have often alluded to in my own company, but<br/>\nstill eludes me frequently.  For that reason I wrote a utility that<br/>\nintegrates with VAJ to keep the metrics coming as far as what is tested and<br/>\nwhat is not.  This is not a code coverage analysis; all it does is report on<br/>\nwhich classes are tested and which are not, and of the ones that are - how<br/>\nmuch of their public interface is tested.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the thoughts Scott.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Jason</div>",
