(That DOES sound like a song title, doesn&#39;t\n&gt;it? :-)\n\nBy the hair band eXtreme Programming ?\n\n&gt;If you can only test your class by testing the output it generates on a\n&gt;filesystem, its design could be improved. It should probably take an\n&gt;OutputStream and write there. You can then compare the contents of the\n&gt;OutputStream to your expected result.\n\nAs a concrete example I am currently working on a a templated code generator\nimplemented\nas a Javadoc DocLet. So I run Javadoc , giving it the classname of the\ndoclet and the name\nof the code template, and the doclet takes the supplied class information\nfrom Javadoc and produces\nan output file according to the template&#39;s instructions. It is a simple\nprogram, using the reflection\nAPI and the doclet API to do most of the work.\n\nMost of the 9 classes can be quickly and cleanly unit tested with little\nwork. But the overall\ntransformation from Template to generated code also needs to be unit\ntestable for refactoring\nand maintainence reasons.\n\nAs far as I can tell, I need a standard &quot;oracular&quot; or dummy doclet\ninformation provider\nto act as the source of class information and a standard template to test as\nwell as\na piece of transformed output to verify against.\n\nThe template and canonical output could be embedded as strings in the\nprogram itself.\nBut the transformed text (going out via a PrintWriter class) I believe is\nonly accessible\nas a file.Am I wrong ? Can I restructure this so that it is unit testable\nwriting to and\nfrom buffers and still manageable as a file output type of tool ?\n\n&gt;It&#39;s all about keeping implementation details out of the public interface.\nA\n&gt;file representation is an implementation detail - a stream is not.\n\n&gt;One of the benefits you reap if you implement your classes that way is that\n&gt;you can add MD5 checksums, compression, etc without any redesign. If your\n&gt;class is writing directly to a file, you would have to modify that class to\n&gt;achieve the same.\n\n&gt;Of course, that&#39;s only a guess - I could be completely off :-)\n\nI think it is clear from my question above that I lack an understanding of\nhow\nthis would be achieved within the Javba I/O library.\n\nAwaiting your response with baited breath\n\n\tJim JM\n\n\n",
