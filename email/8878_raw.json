IF you don&#39;t have \n&gt; side effects=\r\n and\n&gt; IF you have decoupled code then I cannot see where \n&gt; dependencies b=\r\netween T(A)\n&gt; and T(B) make sense. A usually does not depend directly on B =\r\nbut on an\n&gt; abstract interface - B just being an implementation of that int=\r\nerface.\n\nI agree as long as A is not a subclass of B. If A and B are simply=\r\n two different objects then I tend to test them in independent environments=\r\n. If A simply needs to create object B because it gets information from tha=\r\nt object there are other ways to do this - plus that starts a slippery slop=\r\ne of munging unit tests with integration tests.\n\tHowever, if A is a subclas=\r\ns of B then I would like a quick way to say that if B fails then don&#39;t run =\r\nthose tests in A that require a working B, but still run other tests agains=\r\nt A that don&#39;t make direct calls to B. It would simply make the error traci=\r\nng a bit easier and avoid running tests that I know are going to fail.\n\n\nCh=\r\nip\n-----\nProgramming: Its not just a job - its an indenture \n\n\n\n",
