I can&#39;t envision a single project that big. I&#39;d\n&gt;  &gt; want to ask the people on that project two questions:\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; 1. Why such reliance on slow tests?\n&gt;  &gt; 2. Should we break this up into about four subprojects?\n&gt; \n&gt; Good questions. I&#39;d give you my own answers, but I doubt\n&gt; they are too interesting to this group, and they&#39;re definitely\n&gt; far off topic of the conversation about how to group tests\n&gt; together.\n\nI don&#39;t agree with that last statement. If we had fewer slow tests, or \nif we partitioned the projects (perhaps) more appropriately, then we \nmight not want to group tests, which is spot on topic.\n\n&gt;  &gt; Is it really a good idea to have a test suite so long that\n&gt;  &gt; you can&#39;t run it overnight between when people leave for work\n&gt;  &gt; and when they come back in the morning? How do you do a daily build?\n&gt; \n&gt; We have several test suites. The unit tests run every night\n&gt; and give one level of confidence. And then some system test\n&gt; suites run each night to give more confidence about different\n&gt; things each night. In total, it takes 2 nights, but there is\n&gt; usable feedback each night.\n\nI&#39;m not saying it can&#39;t be done; I&#39;m asking whether it should be done.\n\n&gt;  &gt; No question there. If you&#39;ve managed to reduce the feedback\n&gt;  &gt; cycle from 6 weeks to 2 days, then that&#39;s great work. Still,\n&gt;  &gt; I find a 2-day cycle quite long. I imagine you have bigger\n&gt;  &gt; problems to face right now, so you&#39;re right to face them and\n&gt;  &gt; not this one, but all things being equal, I wouldn&#39;t be\n&gt;  &gt; satisfied with a 2-day cycle, and I certainly wouldn&#39;t design\n&gt;  &gt; JUnit to optimize for the case of the 2-day test cycle.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes, that&#39;s one reason I don&#39;t think my own stories are\n&gt; overly relevant. I&#39;m not in the &quot;sweet spot&quot; of users\n&gt; of JUnit, as I&#39;m using it for both unit tests and for\n&gt; system tests. And, while I know there are other people\n&gt; in my same boat, we&#39;re in the minority.\n\nI&#39;m not usually interested in articles that say the same old thing in \nthe same old context. I&#39;m usually interested in articles that add \nsomething new, or share stories about great improvement, like I imagine \nyours would.\n\n&gt;  &gt; But that&#39;s great work. I&#39;m impressed. Have you written about\n&gt;  &gt; what you do differently between the 6-week cycle and the\n&gt;  &gt; 2-day cycle?\n&gt; \n&gt; Only on my resume. :-)\n\nSo why not as a weblog entry?\n-- \nJ. B.
