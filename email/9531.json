Interesting post!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Sun, 2003-09-28 at 02:11, Jeff Grigg wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; *BUT* for any of this to work, the classes under test must be loaded <br/>\n&gt; with a custom class loader.  This is the rub:  Standard JUnit test <br/>\n&gt; runners load the TestCase classes using the standard Java class <br/>\n&gt; loader.  So when I load the application classes using the <br/>\n&gt; jAdvise/javassist class loader, the tests can only communicate with <br/>\n&gt; the application objects using Reflection, because classes and <br/>\n&gt; interfaces are incompatible when loaded with different class <br/>\n&gt; loaders.  Writing all test logic using Reflection would be really <br/>\n&gt; unpleasant.  So I need to load the TestCase classes with the <br/>\n&gt; jAdvise/javassist class loader.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you can&#39;t call a class directly (due to incompatibility arising from<br/>\ndifferent class loaders) then you can&#39;t call a class indirectly (using<br/>\nreflection). Reflection allows you to call methods dynamically, but not<br/>\nto circumvent type checking. You can try, but I think you&#39;ll find it<br/>\nimpossible. (Of course, trying it yourself with tests is much better<br/>\nthan believing what you read on mailing lists!)<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hmmm...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Here&#39;s what I do:<br/>\n&gt; Each test method that needs to run under jAdvise/javassist checks to <br/>\n&gt; see if it was loaded by a JUnit runner or jAdvise.  If it was loaded <br/>\n&gt; by a JUnit runner, it calls a common method that fires up jAdvise, <br/>\n&gt; loads the class with the custom class loader, and then calls the <br/>\n&gt; same method in the loaded class.  (It also calls setUp & tearDown in <br/>\n&gt; the other class.)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Here&#39;s what it looks like:<br/>\n&gt; | public class MyTestCase extends TestCase {<br/>\n&gt; |    final boolean runningInCustomClassLoader;<br/>\n&gt; |    public MyTestCase() { super(&quot;MyTestCase&quot;);<br/>\n&gt; |       this.runningInCustomClassLoader = true; }<br/>\n&gt; |    public MyTestCase(String name) { super(name);<br/>\n&gt; |       this.runningInCustomClassLoader = false; }<br/>\n&gt; |<br/>\n&gt; |    public void testMethod() {<br/>\n&gt; |       if (this.runningInCustomClassLoader) {<br/>\n&gt; |          // Do application testing here.<br/>\n&gt; |       } else { // called by JUnit<br/>\n&gt; |          callSelfInCustomClassLoader();<br/>\n&gt; | } } }<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Crazy, eh?  ;-&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, a little ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; (In Java 1.4 there&#39;s an easy way to get a useful stack trace -- <br/>\n&gt; so &#39;callSelfInCustomClassLoader&#39; can determine the caller&#39;s class <br/>\n&gt; and method name.)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; _ _ _<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Further  (or worse, if you wish  ;-) ...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I often find myself in a related &quot;recursive testing&quot; situation much <br/>\n&gt; like this:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve written a bunch of really nice test methods in a TestCase.  <br/>\n&gt; They work great.  Now I want to run all these tests with a slightly <br/>\n&gt; different configuration of the system -- in addition to the existing <br/>\n&gt; configuration that they test, not instead of it.  Like, here are a <br/>\n&gt; bunch of tests that check sending integers and strings through <br/>\n&gt; a &quot;pipe&quot; from client to server.  Now I&#39;d like to run the whole thing <br/>\n&gt; again, going from server to client.  (The protocol is asymmetrical.  <br/>\n&gt; Don&#39;t blame me; I inherited it!  ;-)  OK, that was great for XML <br/>\n&gt; formatted messages, but I&#39;d like to try both directions again with <br/>\n&gt; binary formatted messages.  Oh, and one more time, both ways, using <br/>\n&gt; Microsoft&#39;s DCOM object serialization.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thus far I&#39;ve been accomplishing these tricks by having each test <br/>\n&gt; method call subroutines that try each of the desired permutations.  <br/>\n&gt; So I&#39;ll have the &#39;testSendBooleanTrue&#39; method call XML, binary and <br/>\n&gt; DCOM methods.  Each of those calls clientToServer and serverToClient <br/>\n&gt; methods.  And then, after all that configuration goes on, down at <br/>\n&gt; the deepest levels, the test takes place -- often by calling back to <br/>\n&gt; anonymous inner classes passed in from the higher levels.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s icky, but it works.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; At least I&#39;ve yet to resort to Reflection or rewriting JUnit to <br/>\n&gt; accomplish what I need.  ;-&gt;     ...at least /not yet./   ;-&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I explained above, I don&#39;t think you could resort reflection anyway,<br/>\nso you might want to write your own JUnit clone to force classloading<br/>\nthrough Javassist&#39;s class-loader.<br/>\n<br/>\nMalcolm<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
