The &quot;if it works, don&#39;t\n&gt; touch it&quot; maxim leads ultimately to code rot, in my experience.  If I let it fester\n&gt; too long, it will become increasing difficult to make new things work.\n\n\nYou&#39;re absolutely right.  But everyone on the team must share the same \nvision.\n\nI personally think that the term &quot;simplest thing that can work&quot; is too \nscary.  Because everyone knows that the &quot;simplest thing that can work&quot; \nleads to spaghetti code _if_ no other measure it taken.\n\nRefactoring is a solution, but at the end of a large project, it can be \nquite hasardous (at least I can easily imagine that).\n\nQuestion maybe OT for this list, but if someone has experiences, I would \nbe glad to hear from them in private.\n\n-Vladimir\n\n-- \nVladimir Bossicard\nwww.bossicard.com\n\n\n",
