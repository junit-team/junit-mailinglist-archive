My first<br/>\n&gt; inclination was to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; simply have Test Mentor test components implement the<br/>\n&gt; junit.framework.Test<br/>\n&gt; &gt; interface and then implement countTestCases() and run(TestResult). The<br/>\n&gt; &gt; problem I ran in to is that we don&#39;t compose tests by way of methods<br/>\n&gt; &gt; beginning with &#39;testxxx&#39;, as JUnit does. What would have made<br/>\n&gt; the job a lot<br/>\n&gt; &gt; easier would have been some method in the Test interface that<br/>\n&gt; is passed a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; test collector, such as collectTests(TestCollector), for example.<br/>\n&gt; [...]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Doesn&#39;t the<br/>\n&gt; \tpublic static TestSuite suite()<br/>\n&gt; method solve this problem?  Certainly it has about the semantics<br/>\n&gt; you want -- &quot;give me the set of tests you consist of&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Good suggestion and that would have worked for me if it was on the instance<br/>\nside. I would like to have a bunch of existing test classes in a hierarchy<br/>\ngenerically inherit the &quot;give me the set of tests you consist of&quot; behavior.<br/>\nIf I did it on the static side, I would require each existing and future<br/>\nclass in the hierarchy to implement a static suite() method, which would be<br/>\na big imposition on our existing customers, just on the off chance that they<br/>\nmight want to run their tests under JUnit.<br/>\n<br/>\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br/>\nMike Silverstein<br/>\nSilverMark, Inc.<br/>\nThe object testing company<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.javatesting.com\">http://www.javatesting.com</a></div>",
