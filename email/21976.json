I might, for example, want to have the errorCode not as a an int, but as a String, or as an enumeration item. I might also have multiple error codes, a major one and a minor one, and so on. <br/>\n<br/>\nTherefore it is very unlikely that this change will get to the sources.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a mail sent by David Saff on 20th of Oct, regarding the feature prioritization on JUnit. You can read there what is the process of placing your request on the list of ToDos for JUnit.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards,<br/>\nBogdan<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;remoliechti&quot; &lt;remo.liechti@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi guys,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; JUnit4 comes with a nice annotation that supports checking for a special exception:<br/>\n&gt; @Test(expected=MyException.class)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Well, the exception contains an error code which should be checked as well, so I thought, why not enhancing JUnit to check this as well:<br/>\n&gt; @Test(expected=MyException.class,errorCode=5)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So I downloaded the JUnit sources and customized the org.junit.Test annotation, as well as org.junit.internal.runners.MethodRoodie and org.junit.internal.runners.TestMethod to fit my needs.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Within eclipse, my new annotation is recognized by the code completion tool, but when running the tests it still uses the shipped junit version.<br/>\n&gt; How can I exchange the junit jar file used by eclipse? Just replacing the jar within the junit plugins folder will crash eclipse since it recognizes the change...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Any ideas?<br/>\n&gt; Maybe this enhancement could be fed back to the junit sources?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks,<br/>\n&gt; Remo<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
