A BDD framework for Java<br/>\n&gt; that takes advantage of JUnit for example for Eclipse integration.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We have tests in non-static inner classes of our test classes. These<br/>\n&gt; run wonderfully using the @RunWith annotation and our own runner.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; however, for individual tests, this doesn&#39;t work. What I would like<br/>\n&gt; to do is that AllDefaultPossibilitiesBuilder would check whether or<br/>\n&gt; not the test class is a non static member class. if it is, then I<br/>\n&gt; would grab the runner of the declaring class instead.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I made a patch implementing this. I will try to attach it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
