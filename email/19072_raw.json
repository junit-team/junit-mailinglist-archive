My group uses both\ntools dependi=\r\nng on the project and our specific needs so I honestly\ncan&#39;t tell you to us=\r\ne one vs the other. ;-)\n\nAs for Continuum... It comes from the same team wo=\r\nrking on the Maven\nbuild tool and is a very nice CI server. It is newer tha=\r\nn\nCruiseControl but there are a number of people using it and working on\nit=\r\n etc and the user list is rather active. They are working on v1.1\nwith a la=\r\nrge number of new features etc so its taking some time.\n\nAs you mentioned, =\r\nCruiseControl and Anthill are two other CI servers.\nMost people I know run =\r\nCruiseControl; I actually don&#39;t know anyone\npersonally who runs Anthill, bu=\r\nt that doesn&#39;t mean much. I would take\na look at the various CI server mail=\r\ning lists, current/planned feature\nlists, SCM check-ins and bug trackers to=\r\n get a feel for which one is\nthe best fit for your team.\n\nWayne\n\nOn 3/8/07,=\r\n Niklas Saers &lt;niklassaers@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Thanks guys for your many an=\r\nswers. I have a couple of questions\n&gt; regarding your suggestions:\n&gt;\n&gt; C=E9d=\r\neric and Wayne: TestNG: how mature / well used is this compared to\n&gt; JUnit?=\r\n I&#39;ve been using JUnit in a few projects before and see that\n&gt; lots of peop=\r\nle use it. I&#39;ve heared about TestNG before and when\n&gt; researching my ignore=\r\n problems I saw it and thought that its\n&gt; different parameters for @Test lo=\r\noked intriguing. Does JUnit do stuff\n&gt; that TestNG doesn&#39;t that I should kn=\r\now that I&#39;m sacrificing should I\n&gt; switch to TestNG?\n&gt;\n&gt; Continuum 1.0.3 is=\r\n considered a preview release from its\n&gt; documentation and was released a y=\r\near ago. This tells me that it is\n&gt; not stable and well-tried and probably =\r\nhasn&#39;t a big community\n&gt; submitting bugs and coming with feature requests. =\r\nThis of course is\n&gt; countered by 79 commits last month. :-) What is the sta=\r\nte of Continuum?\n&gt;\n&gt; How do CruiseControl, Continuum and Anthill compare to=\r\n one-another?\n&gt; Thanks Wayne for these pointers, it all looks like a much b=\r\netter deal\n&gt; than Cron. :-)\n&gt;\n&gt; Cheers\n&gt;\n&gt; \tNik\n\n",
