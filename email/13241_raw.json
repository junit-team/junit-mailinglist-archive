We welcome papers from scholars and=\r\n from practitioners in the \nfield. We will also consider proposals for spec=\r\nial issues organized by \na guest editor.\n\nWe welcome submissions at any tim=\r\ne, but our tentative deadline for \narticles for the first issue is Septembe=\r\nr 1, 2005.\n\nThe emphasis of the first issue will be on putting the field in=\r\n \nperspective. There are some very strongly different visions of testing. \n=\r\nA broad paper that gives the reader insight into one of those visions \n(alo=\r\nng with supporting empirical data or literature review) would be \nparticula=\r\nrly welcome. Well-researched and well-documented attacks on \nother viewpoin=\r\nts are as welcome as well-researched and well-documented \nadvocations.\n\nSub=\r\nmissions outside of this emphasis will still be considered, but \nmight be p=\r\nublished in the next issue.\n\nThe Charter for the Journal is at the end of t=\r\nhis message, as is a list \nof members of our Editorial Board. The Charter d=\r\nescribes in more detail \nthe types of papers that we will consider.\n\nTo sub=\r\nmit a paper, please send the manuscript to Cem Kaner, \nkaner@....\n\nAu=\r\nthors are encouraged to submit abstracts before writing and sending \npapers=\r\n. The abstract can be any reasonable length. Abstracts will be \nrapidly eva=\r\nluated, not peer reviewed. The response to the abstract will \nbe brief, of =\r\nthe nature &quot;Yes, this appears to be within the scope of \nthe Journal and co=\r\nuld be a promising paper&quot; or &quot;No, we are not likely \nto accept a paper alon=\r\ng these lines.&quot; A positive response to an \nabstract will not be a commitmen=\r\nt to publish the associated paper, nor \nis a negative response a guaranteed=\r\n rejection  of the associated paper. \nIt is merely a rough, informal indica=\r\ntor that might save some \nprospective authors some time.\n\nWe expect to publ=\r\nish the Journal on the Web, under a Creative Commons \nlicense that allows a=\r\nnyone to reprint the article but not to modify it. \nArticles will be format=\r\nted consistently, paginated consecutively across \nissues, within an annual =\r\nvolume. It will *look* like a traditional \nprinted journal, but it will be =\r\navailable to the testing community for \nfree. We follow the style of the Am=\r\nerican Psychological Association \n(http://www.apastyle.org/) largely becaus=\r\ne this is the most carefully \ndefined and most accessible professional soci=\r\nety style available to \nprospective authors.\n\nAST is a recently-formed nonp=\r\nrofit professional service organization \ndedicated to advancing the underst=\r\nanding and practice of software \ntesting.=A0The AST serves a community of s=\r\ncholars, students, and software \ndevelopment practitioners by providing for=\r\nums for discussion of all \naspects of software testing through conferences,=\r\n publications, web \nsites, and other services.\n\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=\r\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=\r\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=\r\n=3D=3D\nEDITORIAL CHARTER OF THE\nJOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR SOFTWARE TES=\r\nTING\n\nThe primary purpose of the Journal of the Association for Software \nT=\r\nesting is to publish peer-reviewed materials of archival value that \nadvanc=\r\ne the understanding and practice of software testing. The Journal \nwill acc=\r\nept a wide range of original, unpublished materials.\n\nJAST is published ele=\r\nctronically rather than in print. As a result, \nprinting costs do not const=\r\nrain the length of articles. Articles can be \nof any length, but must be co=\r\nncisely written; verbose articles will be \nreturned to the author for revis=\r\nion.\n\nEMPIRICAL & THEORETICAL RESEARCH (Peer Reviewed)\n\nJAST welcomes origi=\r\nnal scientific and engineering research reports. \nPapers that focus on a ma=\r\nthematical model are welcome; however our \nstrong preference is that such a=\r\n paper include data that at least \nestablishes the plausibility of the mode=\r\nl.\n\nModel journals for articles in this category\n\n=95 \tACM Transactions on =\r\nSoftware Engineering=A0and Methodology\n=95 \tIEEE Transactions on Software E=\r\nngineering\n=95 \tJournal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory & Cogn=\r\nition\n=95 \tJournal of the Acoustical Society of America\n=95 \tPerception & P=\r\nsychophysics\n\nWe encourage authors to include appendices that provide fine =\r\ndetails of \nexperimental methods or a finer-grained presentation of the \nex=\r\nperimental data.\n\nLITERATURE REVIEWS (Peer Reviewed)\n\nA literature review i=\r\ns a thorough guided tour through the published \nmaterial related to a speci=\r\nfic question or topic. The author of the \nreview helps the reader make sens=\r\ne of the topic under discussion, its \nliterature, and the controversies in =\r\nthe literature. A review may be \nwritten at the level of a tutorial (for pe=\r\nople who are somewhat \nknowledgeable about testing in general but not about=\r\n this topic in \nparticular) or at a level that assumes a professional under=\r\nstanding of \nthe field. A tutorial-level paper should be appropriate as a \n=\r\nrequired-reading assignment in an undergraduate course on software \ntesting=\r\n. A professional-level paper should be appropriate for use in a \ngraduate c=\r\nourse on software testing.\n\nWithin this category, we will also consider ref=\r\nlections. A reflection \nis a narrowly-scoped review that puts years of the =\r\nauthor&#39;s work in \nperspective. For example, the head of a research laborato=\r\nry might \ndescribe the evolution and progress of her research program, its =\r\n\nsuccesses, surprises and problems. A consultant might describe the \nevolut=\r\nion of his practice. A manager of a corporate test group that \nconsciously =\r\ninnovates might describe the evolution of the group&#39;s \npractice. A reflecti=\r\non must connect the described work to the scholarly \nand/or practitioners&#39; =\r\npublications that guided or reported the work, \nand to additional publicati=\r\nons that will place the work in context for \nthe reader.\n\nLiterature review=\r\n authors are welcome to build a case for a theoretical \nposition or viewpoi=\r\nnt in their review, but must provide references to \nthe strongest reference=\r\ns that would disagree with them.\n\nReviews may cover any area of testing, in=\r\ncluding ethics, methodology, \neducation and training, law, or commercial is=\r\nsues (such as outsourcing \nor certification). The editor and reviewers must=\r\n be convinced however \nthat the topic or question is relevant, important, a=\r\nnd is covered \nthoroughly, fairly, and in a way that makes sense of the top=\r\nic for the \nreader.\n\nMuch of the interesting work in testing was first done=\r\n in industry and \npresented in industry conferences or as technical reports=\r\n on private \nwebsites. References to these are encouraged, especially when =\r\na copy of \nthe referenced report is still available to the general public.\n=\r\n\nModel journals for articles in this category:\n\n=95 \tACM Computing Surveys\n=\r\n=95 \tPsychological Bulletin\n=95 \tJohn Marshall Journal of Computer and Info=\r\nrmation Law\n\nCASE STUDIES (Peer Reviewed)\n\nA case study provides an in-dept=\r\nh description of an actual application \nor use of a model or theory, a tool=\r\n, a technique, or a process. A good \ncase study is typically rich in detail=\r\ns, especially details that help \nus understand how and why the model (theor=\r\ny, tool, technique, process) \nwas (or was not) valuable and what we can do =\r\nto make application \neasier, cheaper, or more successful. The details trigg=\r\ner and support \ninsights and help readers form hypotheses, rather than prov=\r\niding \nproofs. Case studies present editorial challenges. For example, we \n=\r\nprefer to know the real names of companies and products, but ethical or \nle=\r\ngal considerations sometimes make this impossible. Another example: \nwe wil=\r\nl err on the side of rejection if we suspect that a particular \nreport is a=\r\n marketing document for a tool vendor or consultant. We \nencourage authors =\r\nto disclose their backgrounds, biases, and potential \nconflicts of interest=\r\n, but will not publish the sociopolitical rants \nthat sometimes make up cas=\r\ne study disclosures. We expect case study \nreports to be reflective. Nothin=\r\ng goes perfectly; few things \ncompetently done fail completely. What could =\r\nhave been done differently \nand why? What conclusions should we be less or =\r\nmore confident in \nbecause of the details of the case? What hypotheses does=\r\n the case \nsuggest for research, and what methodological suggestions does i=\r\nt \nprovide for executing the research?\n\nA narrower type of case study is th=\r\ne failure analysis. A failure \nanalysis considers a failure that was caused=\r\n by a defect in the design \nor implementation of software. As with the long=\r\ner case study, the \narticle should provide details=97publicly-verifiable de=\r\ntails if the \nproduct is identifiable=97and guidance to the reader as to th=\r\ne underlying \nlessons to take away.\n\nUltimately, a key question for us will=\r\n be whether the case study&#39;s \ndetails will still be instructive for readers=\r\n ten years from now.\n\nARTICLE SETS (Peer Reviewed)\n\nAn article set includes=\r\n one or more original articles plus detailed, \nreviewed comments and critic=\r\nisms of each article. This can be a way for \nauthors who have competing vie=\r\nws or approaches to square off in a \nthorough, well-documented debate. We h=\r\nave seen some symposia, \nespecially legal symposia, that have created such =\r\nan effect, but we&#39;re \nwilling to consider other structures.\n\nWe will not pu=\r\nblish case studies that advocate the use of a particular \ntool, but we migh=\r\nt publish a set of case studies that allow the reader \nto compare successes=\r\n of competing tools. The critical question is \nwhether the set is likely to=\r\n give a careful reader insights into the \nclass of tool (and the tool-assoc=\r\niated techniques).\n\nMETHODOLOGICAL REPORTS (Peer Reviewed)\n\nMethodological =\r\nreports describe new equipment and methods for \nconducting research. These =\r\nare tutorials, from one scientist to \nanother, explaining how to conduct a =\r\nspecific type of experiment or how \nto apply a specific type of equipment t=\r\no a type of experiment. This is \nnot a place for vendor reports. Nor is it =\r\na place for re-explanations \nof matters that already appear in textbooks. M=\r\nodels for such articles \ncan be found in:\n\n=95 \tBehavior Research Methods, =\r\nInstruments, & Computers\n\nSTATISTICAL METHODS & MODELS (Peer Reviewed)\n\nJAS=\r\nT will occasionally accept tutorial articles on the use of \nstatistics or p=\r\nrobability models in software testing. The burden of \npersuasion is on the =\r\nauthor to convince the editor that such an article \nfills an important gap =\r\nin the knowledge of readers of this journal. \nSuch a paper might establish =\r\ncontext by citing examples of \nmisunderstanding of the computation, theory =\r\nor use of the statistic or \nprobability model.\n\nWe have seen examples of su=\r\nch articles in:\n\n=95 \tASQ Technometrics\n=95 \tJurimetrics\n=95 \tPsychological=\r\n Bulletin\n\nAuthors are encouraged to submit a proposal for an article of th=\r\nis type \nto the editor before submitting a manuscript. We suspect that \nrel=\r\natively few of these proposals will be accepted. For more author \nguidance,=\r\n see our Information For Authors.\n\nPOSITION PAPERS AND INTERVIEWS WITH FAMO=\r\nUS PEOPLE (NOT Peer Reviewed)\n\nThe Journal will sometimes accept position p=\r\napers, editorials, and \ninterviews of notable people in the field. The Edit=\r\nor may consult \ncolleagues in the evaluation of such a submission, but the =\r\nfinal \ndecision is the Editor&#39;s alone. The Editor&#39;s primary question is \nwh=\r\nether the article is likely to be of interest to readers of the \ncurrent is=\r\nsue and of continuing interest to future readers. For \nexample, an intervie=\r\nw in which Richard Feynman explained how he \ndesigned instructional materia=\r\nls might be of interest for decades.\n\nREQUIREMENTS FOR PUBLICATION\n\nSubmitt=\r\ned materials must follow the style and guidelines of the \nAmerican Psycholo=\r\ngical Association. (See http://www.apastyle.org ) A \nbrief summary of the r=\r\neferencing style is available at \nhttp://webster.commnet.edu/apa/apa_index.=\r\nhtm\n\nSubmitted articles must be written in English and be in final or \nnear=\r\n-final form. Unless the editor has given prior permission to submit \na roug=\r\nh draft, rough drafts will be returned unreviewed.\n\nSubmitted materials mus=\r\nt be original and unpublished. We will consider \narticles that describe mat=\r\nerial originally presented at a conference, \nbut the article must substanti=\r\nally extend the conference presentation. \nIf a conference paper was publish=\r\ned, this must be disclosed at time of \nsubmission and the submitted article=\r\n must be so differently worded from \nthe conference paper there is unquesti=\r\nonably no infringement of the \nrights of the owner of copyright in the conf=\r\nerence paper.\n\nThe person submitting an article must have the authority to =\r\npublish it. \nFor example, we cannot accept and publish an article that reve=\r\nals trade \nsecrets of the author&#39;s employer.\n\nFinally, JAST has a zero-tole=\r\nrance policy with regard to plagiarism. \nJAST will not knowingly publish a =\r\nplagiarized article and it will \nreject without review, as a matter of poli=\r\ncy, any submissions from \nauthors who previously submitted a plagiarized ar=\r\nticle to JAST.\n\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=\r\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=\r\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D\n\nEDITORIAL BOARD OF THE=\r\n\nJOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR SOFTWARE TESTING\n\nFranck Barbier\t\t   Labora=\r\ntoire d&#39;Informatique de l&#39;Universit=E9 de Pau et \ndes Pays de l&#39;Adour, Fran=\r\nce\nJuris Borzovs\t\t\t   Riga Information Technology Institute and University =\r\n\nof Latvia, Latvia\nJoao Cangussu\t\t   University of Texas at Dallas, United =\r\nStates\nLuiz Capretz\t\t\t   University of Western Ontario, Canada\nRoss Collard=\r\n\t\t\t   Collard & Company, United States\nLydie Du Bousquet\t\t   Laboratorire L=\r\nogiciels, Syst=E8mes et R=E9seaux - \nIMAG, France\nRobert Glass\t\t\t   Computi=\r\nng Trends, United States\nJon Hagar\t\t\t   Lockheed Martin, United States\nJoel=\r\n Henry\t\t\t   University of Montana at Missoula, United States\nRob Hierons\t\t\t=\r\n   Brunel University, United Kingdom\nAmir Kolsky\t\t\t   Xpand Software, Israe=\r\nl\nYves Ledru\t\t\t   Laboratoire Logiciels Syst=E8mes R=E9seaux - IMAG, France=\r\n\nBruno Legeard\t\t   Laboratoire d&#39;Informatique de l&#39;Universit=E9 de \nFranche=\r\n-Comt=E9, France\nHareton Leung\t\t   The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Ho=\r\nng Kong\nNashat Mansour\t\t   Lebanese American University, Lebanon\nKeith W.
