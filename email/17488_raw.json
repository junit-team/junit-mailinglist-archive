Over the last 7 years I have  \ncome to the following conclusions:\n\n1. There are no instances in which TDD is impossible.\n2. There are no instances in which TDD is not advantageous.\n3. The impediments to TDD are human, not technical.\n4. The alternative to TDD is code that is not repeatably testable.\n\nTherefore I consider TDD to be a minimum professional standard.   \nDevelopers who do not use TDD fall below that standard.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; My follow-up claim is that anyone who says this has never really  \n&gt; worked on\n&gt; &gt; the kind of real-world projects that I (and hundreds of thousands  \n&gt; of other\n&gt; &gt; developers out there) are involved in on a daily basis.\n\nI&#39;m afraid I&#39;m the counter example. I am nearly 54 years old and have  \nbeen writing code since I was 15.  I still write code of one kind or  \nanother nearly every day.  I have worked on projects large and small,  \nembedded and batch, system and application, in sickness and in heath,  \nand I expect to code till I die.  Like Isaac Asimov used to say, I  \nwant them to find me with my nose jammed between the keys of my  \nkeyboard.\n\nI&#39;m afraid that there are also other counter examples.  I just got  \nback from consulting with a team of 18 .NET developers working on a  \nhuge web-based application.  They have code coverage in the 90s, have  \nunit tests and acceptance tests that are run every build.\n\nTake a look at the Rails framework.  This is a web-development  \nframework that has testing built in from the very start.  Virtually  \nevery facet of a rails application is intended to be written using  \nTDD.  The point is that the new hyper-productive frameworks are  \nadopting TDD from the get-go.\n\nTDD is a fundamental change in the minute by minute process of  \nwriting software.  Many developers are not willing to face that  \nchange and look for reasons why TDD does not apply to them.  I  \nbelieve that there are no such reasons.\n\n\n----\nRobert C.
