Do you have a test that exhibits t=\r\nhe\noriginal exception bug that you describe below?\n\nOn Sat, Jul 16, 2011 at=\r\n 1:30 AM, jcortez8080 &lt;jmc0092@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hello,\n&gt;\n&gt; I recently cr=\r\neated and submitted a working patch for JUnit having to do with Assert.asse=\r\nrtArrayEquals(float[],float[],delta) throwing exceptions with doubles inste=\r\nad of floats. It turns out that the floats were being casted to doubles, so=\r\n I modified the code so that the floats remained as floats. At the request =\r\nof David Saff, I attempted to write a test that would cause either the prev=\r\nious implementation that printed out thrown exceptions with doubles, or my =\r\nnew implementation that does the same with floats instead, to fail. So far,=\r\n I have only been able to write tests with wide varieties of input that cau=\r\nse both implementations to fail, but not just one, just because of the mess=\r\ny nature of floats and doubles. I have run out of ideas of input to use (tw=\r\no float arrays to be compared against each other and a maximum delta when c=\r\nomparing the floats in the two arrays) that would cause only one implementa=\r\ntion to fail. Any ideas?\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Juan\n\n-- \nBj=F6rn Gustafsson\n\n",
