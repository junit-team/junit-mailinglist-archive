I don&#39;t see how that&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; possible, since &quot;this&quot; cannot be null.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Either you misread or I miswrote the article (or both). The bug was not<br/>\n&gt; that a NullPointerException was thrown. The bug was that a<br/>\n&gt; NullPointerException was *not* thrown when the client passed in null to<br/>\n&gt; the public API.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Cool. I definitely misunderstood that, then, although you might share <br/>\nthe blame. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Once pointed out, it was obviously a bug. XOM doesn&#39;t allow most things<br/>\n&gt; to be null, and indeed promises they aren&#39;t. Prior to writing the test,<br/>\n&gt; I devised an incorrect solution to the problem that put the null check<br/>\n&gt; in the wrong place (the non-public method). Writing the test suddenly<br/>\n&gt; made it apparent that my solution was wrong, and that I needed to put<br/>\n&gt; the null-check elsewhere (the public method). Had I not written the test<br/>\n&gt; before fixing the bug, I likely would not have noticed this.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Absolutely. That I both get and love.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; TDD isn&#39;t just about testing. It&#39;s also about helping you look at your<br/>\n&gt; own code from a different angle. Sometimes that helps you see things you<br/>\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t otherwise notice.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I couldn&#39;t agree more! Yet another reason to write tests.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
