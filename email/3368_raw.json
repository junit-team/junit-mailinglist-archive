On the topic at hand, I know that Vladimir Bossicard has implemented a\n&gt; scheme that will let you register services with the junit architecture for\n&gt; letting you extend it easily for custom reporting and what-not. I don&#39;t know\n&gt; the current status of that effort though so perhaps he can comment?\n\n\nHe can comment, he can :-)\n\nMy project (www.bossicard.com/projects/junit.php) is the result of all \nthe experiments I made on JUnit over the last nine months.  I choose \nthis way not to replace JUnit but to see how users&#39; requests could be \nimplemented in JUnit (the official version).  I agree I coded a little \nbit too much and my version does not look like JUnit anymore :-) \nBecause this project is a prototype and not a replacement to the \nofficial version, I am not putting too much effort in it anymore and \nwait to see the direction Erich and Kent take with their framework.\n\nI am also working on another project with the idea to have more \nflexibility while running your tests (defining services accessible by \nall tests (single db connection, CORBA service, logging mechanism...), \nreplacing the different property and allTests.java files with XML files, \nwriting the output in an XML file and then converting it into HTML, text \nfile..., providing metrics for every test (and not only the failed \none),... ).  For those interested: www.bossicard.com/apricot, I&#39;ll \nrelease some code in the new few days.\n\n-Vladimir\n\n-- \nVladimir Bossicard\nwww.bossicard.com\n\n\n",
