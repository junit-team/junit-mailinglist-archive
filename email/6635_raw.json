So a test shouldn&#39;t be judged \nby the number of asserts it uses.  (However, I have been in situations \nwhere I did flush out a test by adding more asserts and the fact that \nthe output looked no different was somewhat disappointing.)\n\nI&#39;m tempted to say that the generated tests is what you should look \ninto, rather than JUnit.  For example, if your generated test put \nsomething like this into the body:\n\nthrow new Exception(&quot;Test Not Yet Implemented&quot;);\n\nThen you would have a complete TODO list of all the methods you&#39;ve left \nto write tests for and wouldn&#39;t be receiving these false positives.  \nBut having a ton of errors coming from your tests isn&#39;t a great \nsolution either.  It would be nice if JUnit provided a means for test \ngenerators to inform JUnit like so:\n\nAuto generated tests might look like:\n\nvoid testFoo() {\n\tthrow new NotYetImplementedException();\n}\n\nOutput might look like:\n\n.......F\n[/snip]\nFAILURES!!!\nTests run: 8,  Failures: 1,  Errors: 0,  NYI: 302\n\n-shane\n\n\nOn Thursday, January 9, 2003, at 12:51  PM, SteveKelem \n&lt;s_kelem@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; JUnit (3.8.1) counts the number of test methods that pass/fail.\n&gt; With some of the test generation methods, such as JUnitDoclet, empty\n&gt; methods are generated (a good thing) for each class. But when the\n&gt; tests are run, the generated document shows that all these methods\n&gt; pass (questionably good).  This gives a false sense that the code\n&gt; being tested is being tested, when it really isn&#39;t because the test\n&gt; bodies are empty.\n&gt;\n&gt; Is there a way to track the number of assertions that pass/fail\n&gt; instead of the number of methods that are invoked in the test classes?\n&gt;  This way the numbers reported (e.g., 122 tests run) would tend to\n&gt; imply better test coverage, or at least more actual tests executing,\n&gt; rather than lots of empty tests running.  (Yes, I know bad tests can\n&gt; be written that skew the results, but we don&#39;t need to go into that\n&gt; now.)\n&gt; This way more the classes for which tests haven&#39;t yet been written,\n&gt; but the skeleton is up and running, would show up in the report as 0\n&gt; tests run, rather than whatever number of test skeletons have been\n&gt; generated\n&gt; and may or may not be empty.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Steve Kelem\n\n\n",
