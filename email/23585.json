I see that you did define the hamcrest-core dependency in the POM, but since the class files are also shipped this has no effect.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wonder: is this bundling on purpose, and if not, will it be corrected?<br/>\n<br/>\nKind regards,<br/>\nStephan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, David Saff &lt;david@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So, one minute--does this mean that the beta staging repositories that<br/>\n&gt; I closed, but didn&#39;t release, were not available to users for beta<br/>\n&gt; testing?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;    David Saff<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On Wed, Aug 24, 2011 at 11:40 AM, Max Bowsher &lt;maxb@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Yes, that looks fine.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; You probably also want to either promote or drop - probably drop - the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; remaining active staging repositories containing 4.9 beta releases from<br/>\n&gt; &gt; oss.sonatype.org.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Max.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; On 24/08/11 12:35, David Saff wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I just had to click the button, it turns out.  It should now be<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; promoted.  Please let me know if it looks that way to you (since I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; still, obviously, new at this).<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;    David Saff<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; On Wed, Aug 24, 2011 at 7:29 AM, Max Bowsher &lt;maxb@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; On 23/08/11 16:44, David Saff wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hello, everyone.  We&#39;re happy to announce the release of JUnit 4.9.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Great!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; I see you&#39;ve already staged it at oss.sonatype.org - what still needs to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; happen before that staging repository gets promoted into Maven Central?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Max.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
