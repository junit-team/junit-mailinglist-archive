Simply stating that X line was executed Y\n&gt; &gt; times is of marginal use to me if I can&#39;t map back to see\n&gt; &gt; exactly /how/ that line was executed. I don&#39;t recall whether\n&gt; &gt; EMMA does this. Any other suggestions? Commercial version of\n&gt; &gt; jCoverage?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Why do I need this? At first, I created a custom Javadoc\n&gt; &gt; taglet that developers would add to their class-under-test&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; method comments, to the tune of:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;    /**\n&gt; &gt;     * @... = FooTest#testAddBar()\n&gt; &gt;     * @... = FooTest#testAddThreeBars()\n&gt; &gt;     */\n&gt; &gt;    public void addBar(Bar bar) { ... }\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; This would insert appropriate Javadoc links to the relevant\n&gt; &gt; test methods. But this is unwieldy, and certainly an\n&gt; &gt; unrealistic requirement for the developers.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
