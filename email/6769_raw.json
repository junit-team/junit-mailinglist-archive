B. Rainsberger wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Wonderfully. For those of you with taste, please prod me to get off\nmy\n&gt;&gt;ass and write my upcoming article, &quot;Unit Testing within Frameworks&quot;,\n&gt;&gt;which covers strategies for frameworks including EJB, Servlet,\nTurbine,\n&gt;&gt;Struts and anything else people can suggest to me.\n&gt;\n&gt;Yes, please write that article already.  :-)\n\nI&#39;m already a few hundred words in. I am in a race with my wife to\ncomplete an article by Wednesday night, when I return home from lovely\nLexington MA. I figure this is a good way to prod her into writing one\nof the many books she&#39;s threatened to write in the past few years.\n\n&gt;An alternative title comes to mind:\n&gt;\n&gt;    &quot;How to decouple your code from their framework&quot;\n\nThis is an excellent title. I just may use it.\n\n&gt;People tell me that books and articles with &quot;testing&quot; in the title\ndon&#39;t \n&gt;sell as well as they&#39;d like.  It&#39;s a shame really, and I hope to help \n&gt;change that mentality.  One of my tactics in doing so, as you well\nknow, \n&gt;is to convince readers that testing is also a design activity.  As\nsuch, \n&gt;I should be able to change any phrase about testing into a phrase\nabout \n&gt;design.  It&#39;s something I&#39;ve been practicing, and this title is one \n&gt;attempt.     \n\nI have noticed that, even in the words I&#39;ve written so far, that I\noften write, &quot;... use this stuff to write the test that drives the\ndesign you need to complete your task.&quot; A bit wordy, but repeated often\nenough, it may hammer home the very point you&#39;re making.\n\n&gt;Now, please write that article!  :-)\n\nI wrote for 30 minutes on the plane and about an hour when I got here.\nSee: I&#39;m good!\n\n\nJ.
