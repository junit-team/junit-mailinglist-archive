    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-218743668\">Hi!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve got some questions on size of test cases and would like to hear <br/>\nyour opinions.<br/>\n<br/>\nI write a program matching the board game Carcassonne (see<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://das-spiel.de/hig/seiten/0245e.htm\">http://das-spiel.de/hig/seiten/0245e.htm</a> for a brief summaray).<br/>\nIn Carcassonne you have tiles showing countryside elements like roads, <br/>\nabbeys, and city parts. The game has a specific set of tiles I want to <br/>\ncreate in the program.<br/>\n<br/>\nI made the constructor of the Tile class private and provided static <br/>\nmakeTileXyz methods to create tiles.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow my test methods get quite large. Each of them assures that the tile <br/>\nhas just (and only) the requested features. So each test checks for <br/>\nspecial items on the cards (e.g. isAbbey, isMarketsquare) and counts <br/>\nthe roads coming in and the city parts a tile has.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn addition tests get more complicated because tiles may be rotated in  <br/>\nthe game. The test for makeRoadTurningLeft  (ensure the tile shows a <br/>\nroad turning left) has to check whether the road goes south to west, <br/>\nwest to north, north to east or east to south. In the end my tests are <br/>\nabout 20 to 30 lines of code, but I was used to have 5 liners in other <br/>\nprojects.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do you think about this test case size?<br/>\n<br/>\nWould you create additional methods to help in testing, i.e. for <br/>\ncounting the roads on one tile or a method like isSpecial?<br/>\n<br/>\nWould you place such helpers in the test class (as they are only used <br/>\nfor testing)? Does that get to complex, i.e. do you eventually need <br/>\ntest cases for your test cases?<br/>\n<br/>\nWould you rely on some orientation of created tiles, e.g. assume the <br/>\nleft turning road is always constructed as from east turning to south <br/>\n(maybe this is like the Blackbox / Whitebox discussion)?<br/>\n<br/>\nWould you even allow incomplete tests (not testing what is &quot;most likely <br/>\nworking&quot;, e.g. assuming a tile does not have special items)?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your comments.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobert</div>",
