Writes:\n\n&gt; Also, Agitator can help retrofit tests to legacy code, howe=\r\nver it \n&gt; /doesn&#39;t/ help you identify the specific design problems in that =\r\ncode, \n&gt; nor does it motivate you to improve the design. This might or migh=\r\nt not \n&gt; concern your team at this time.\n\nThis is Alberto jumping in again =\r\nto set the record straight on\nAgitator ...\n\nHi Joe, you might not remember =\r\nme but we exchanged emails a couple of\nyears ago, and I am a big fan of you=\r\nrs for all the work you have done\nto educate people about JUnit through you=\r\nr book and online presence.\n\nAnyway ... your description of using Agitator =\r\nto complement TDD is\nspot-on (for people who do TDD) - thank you for jumpin=\r\ng in and helping\nin setting the record straight.  But you also state (I par=\r\naphrase):\n&quot;Agitator does not help you identify design problems or motivate =\r\nyou\nto improve the design&quot;.  We have actually found, somewhat\nserendipitous=\r\nly, that Agitator does indeed help you in identifying\ndesign problems and e=\r\nven provides you compelling motivations to\naddress them (e.g. well designed=\r\n code Agitates better).\n\nA simple example, of Agitator helping you improve =\r\nyour design is\nblogged on developertesting.com:\n\nhttp://www.developertestin=\r\ng.com/archives/month200402/20040226-TestDrivenDevelopmentAndAgitatorDrivenR=\r\nefactoring.html\n\nAgain, this does not mean that Agitator replaces TDD, but =\r\nit can\ncomplement TDD efforts (our own Dashboard product was developed\nprac=\r\nticing TDD, pair-programming, etc., AND Agitator of course).\n\nAlberto\n\n\n\n\n\n=\r\n\n\n",
