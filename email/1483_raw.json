Please contribute ideas to:\n&gt; http://sourceforge.net/projects/jfcunit\n\n\nI just downloaded and looked at their code.  They have a fatal, from my\nperspective, flaw.  Namely, to generate events against the components they\ncreate a Java level event and post it to the event queue like so:\n\n            queue.postEvent(new MouseEvent(ultimate,\n                          MouseEvent.MOUSE_ENTERED,\n                    new Date().getTime(), 0,\n                    comp.getLocationOnScreen().x\n                        -ultimate.getLocationOnScreen().x,\n                    comp.getLocationOnScreen().y\n                        -ultimate.getLocationOnScreen().y, 0, false));\n\t...etc...\n\nThe problem with this is that they do not exercise the native level code\nin the slightest, so they are not getting complete code coverage.  Like I\nsaid in my earlier email, my situation is different from y&#39;all since my\njob is to help validate the JDK and we need to validate as much as we can.\n\nThe difference between using Robot, and the above, is that Robot asks\nthe operating system to generate a system level event, that acts for all\nintents and purposes like any event generated by a user twidling the mouse\nor typing on the keyboard.  The event arrives in Java in the same way and\nmanner as any real event generated by a real user, and more importantly it\nfollows the same code paths those real events would follow.  This way\nthere are two advantages: 1) we can test AWT heavyweight components, 2) we\nhave complete coverage of the AWT native code, the AWT support code, and\nthe Swing classes.  Even for a pure Swing application, there is AWT code\nthat executes under the sheets (JFrame is, for instance, a wrapper around\nWindow).\n\n- David Herron\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
