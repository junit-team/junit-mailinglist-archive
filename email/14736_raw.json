I don&#39;t object to new \npackage-private classes and methods as part of refactoring, or in \ninitial design. But we do need to be really clear about distinguishing \nbetween public and package-private. I don&#39;t think you&#39;ve always been as \nclear as you think. For instance, here&#39;s a quote from the first message \nI found from you still in my Inbox:\n\n\tWanting to test them is a symptom, to me, of a violation of the SRP.\n\t Exposing private methods as public, on an appropriate class, helps\n\tme to avoid SRP-violations, and helps promote reuse to reduce\n\tduplication.\n\n\tThe other driver I have to make private methods public is explicitly\n\tto reduce duplication. For example, maybe it&#39;s you doing the\n\tString-to-Calendar trick in another class. You know where you did it\n\tbefore, so you extract it out and reuse it. However, this only works\n\tbecause you&#39;re familar with what you did earlier - it didn&#39;t work\n\tfor Jane because she wasn&#39;t.\n\nThat talks about public. Now if by &quot;public&quot; you only meant non-private, \nthen we don&#39;t really disagree; but can you see why I may have thought we \ndid? This is a real flaw in Java. I really, really wish there were a \nstandard word for package-private/package-protected/default \naccess/whatever.\n\n-- \n﻿Elliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nXML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim\n\n",
