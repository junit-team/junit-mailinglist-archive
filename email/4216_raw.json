The database is lightweight and rebuilds\n&gt; quickly. We have Ant tasks which drop, recreate, and reload the DB with an\n&gt; empty scheme before each test run. This is fully automated and only adds a\n&gt; few seconds to a run. If someone is interested, I can send some sample\n&gt; scripts.\n&gt; \n&gt; On Mon, 11 Feb 2002, Mathieu Gervais wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hi,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;There is a line of thought that all you need to do is make sure your SQL\n&gt; &gt; &gt;is valid. beyond that you&#39;re testing your database, not your method...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  I never got that one. It&#39;s like saying SQL code doesn&#39;t need testing as\n&gt; &gt; mush as java code.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Programmer A:\n&gt; &gt; When I do unit testing, I just run my code in a couple of conditions and\n&gt; &gt; look if it&#39;s ok.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; XPer:\n&gt; &gt; You should really program those tests so they are repeatable, fast to run\n&gt; &gt; and don&#39;t need any human interaction to verify if they pass. Do automated\n&gt; &gt; unit testing! Use  JUnit!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Why doesn&#39;t the same applies to SQL queries? In reality the programmer DOES\n&gt; &gt; test his SQL queries by trying them and looking at results. (&quot;make sure\n&gt; your\n&gt; &gt; SQL is valid&quot;) so why not automate it like the rest?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve seen queries way more complex than some Java code. I&#39;m pretty sure\n&gt; &gt; everybody did. Don&#39;t you want that when somebody will need to modifiy the\n&gt; &gt; query (to add a filtering condition for example) they can press the button\n&gt; &gt; and run the tests to ensure the query is still ok?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; What I do is I connect to a special DB (with a replica of the schema of the\n&gt; &gt; real DB) populated with test data. I also dynamically add data (in setup)\n&gt; &gt; and delete it (in teardown) for some tests. Or check that my code really\n&gt; &gt; inserted a row, etc. Of course, if a query is like selectAll(), you might\n&gt; be\n&gt; &gt; influenced by other programmers using the same test DB at the same time, so\n&gt; &gt; you will want something like a test db per programmer. And then you start\n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; find it hard to deal with this increasingly complex solution so you drop\n&gt; all\n&gt; &gt; of this and return to &quot;make sure your SQL is valid&quot; testing, no more\n&gt; &gt; automated tests for SQL.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I would really like to have a tool that helped me test my SQL code and\n&gt; setup\n&gt; &gt; testcases as easily as the JUnit testcase for Java. I can&#39;t use a sql only\n&gt; &gt; test tool: I don&#39;t want to test the SQL outside the java code and then have\n&gt; &gt; the java code use those statements. Why? Because often what I want to test\n&gt; &gt; is if the transaction is correctly rolledback in a special case, stuff like\n&gt; &gt; that that needs java code and SQL. But really 10 lines of code and 3 lines\n&gt; &gt; of sql, so it is a &quot;unit&quot; difficult to break down further without loosing a\n&gt; &gt; lot of test cases. And what about testing failure of a DB connection at a\n&gt; &gt; critical point? Mock objects seem to be usefull for this. Really, there is\n&gt; a\n&gt; &gt; need for somebody to build a tool or documentatin explaining the best way\n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; do all of this.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve already tought about solutions for DB-interacting code testing  (see\n&gt; &gt; posts in archive) but all my ideas are going into direction where the\n&gt; &gt; infrastructure needed is heavy and difficult to maintain. Any brillant tool\n&gt; &gt; or ideas out there for all of this?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; mathieu\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; PS: The original poster should also look at MockObjects to mock the results\n&gt; &gt; of the DB. They might help depending on what you want to do. But then you\n&gt; &gt; aren&#39;t testing the SQL since you are mocking the execution engine.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; &gt; From: Nilesh Thali\n&gt; &gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Monday, February 11, 2002 5:01 PM\n&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [junit] Database Select query checks!! newbie\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (2) Your tests are simple: populate the database with data, write News\n&gt; &gt; beans\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that represent that data, assert that getAllNews() answers the same Set\n&gt; &gt; (or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; List, if you care about order within the collection) of News beans. Do\n&gt; &gt; this\n&gt; &gt; &gt; with as many different datasets as you need to be confident that your\n&gt; &gt; method\n&gt; &gt; &gt; works.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;     only problem with testing queries like this is that your test will be\n&gt; &gt; time and\n&gt; &gt;     database dependent, because data (in this case the number of news\n&gt; beans)\n&gt; &gt;     may change over time, and you will see the red bar even though your\n&gt; &gt; method\n&gt; &gt;     works fine.\n&gt; &gt;     There is a line of thought that all you need to do is make sure your\n&gt; SQL\n&gt; &gt;     is valid. beyond that you&#39;re testing your database, not your method...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; regards,\n&gt; &gt; Nilesh\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
