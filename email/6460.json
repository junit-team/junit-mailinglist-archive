That wasn&#39;t the intent.  I have<br/>\nsome strong ideas about TDD.<br/>\n<br/>\nGranted this isn&#39;t the TDD list, it&#39;s the JUnit list.. I guess I<br/>\nsometimes loose site of the fact that a lot of people using JUnit<br/>\ndon&#39;t do TDD.  Different techniques apply.  My point of view is from<br/>\nthe practice of pure TDD.  As I&#39;ve been accused of before, I am a bit<br/>\nof a purist about some things.  I don&#39;t expect it to be applicable to<br/>\neveryone, or every project.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I didn&#39;t come here to have some guy and his buddy disparage the ideas <br/>\n&gt; that I offer without offering anything in exchange other than, &quot;This <br/>\n&gt; is how it is.  Buy my book!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>But it or don&#39;t, I don&#39;t really care.  I wrote it because I saw a<br/>\nneed, and had something to say that I felt other people might be<br/>\ninterested in hearing.<br/>\n<br/>\nFYI I&#39;ve gotten some very good feedback on the book.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I think if a person jumps into a discussion and says, &quot;Your approach <br/>\n&gt; sucks.  Buy my book!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s not quite what I said.<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; Yet, I haven&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; &gt; seen any explanation as to what is inferior in your approach - <br/>\n&gt; &gt; asserting it&#39;s inferior does not make it so.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I couldn&#39;t agree more.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The main thing is &quot;does it work for you?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf so, great.  But could it work better?  I talk about what I&#39;ve<br/>\nproven works well for me.<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; For the record, I never said I disagreed with what Dave and J. B.<br/>\n&gt; are advocating.  I never said I didn&#39;t like them personally, either.  <br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s the delivery of their message I find curious.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Young children tend to be frightened by me as well... until they get<br/>\nto know me, that is.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It seems more  geared toward self-interest than equitable exchange <br/>\n&gt; or mutual benefit.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, it certainly stirred up some exchange.<br/>\n<br/>\nDave</div>",
