It looks like the test failures were actually<br/>\nhighlighting a threading problem in either your test or code, which<br/>\nyou were able to fix, so that&#39;s a happy outcome, and you may not need<br/>\nthe rest of this message.<br/>\n<br/>\nLike Joakim, I have found that on some platforms (older versions of<br/>\nWindows are foremost in my memory), it seems that deleting a file from<br/>\nJava sometime simply doesn&#39;t, and sometimes does, but only after a<br/>\nsurprising delay.   One possibility is to use the TemporaryFolder rule<br/>\nin JUnit 4.7 and above.  This creates a new temporary folder for each<br/>\ntest, and deletes it afterward.  Since each test automatically gets a<br/>\ndifferent folder, you&#39;re protected against any filesystem oddities in<br/>\ndeletion.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck,<br/>\n<br/>\n   David Saff<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Tue, Mar 29, 2011 at 5:22 PM, Nils Wilhelm &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:murphy@...\">murphy@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Hi there,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; i have written a simple backup tool and 10 tests. They all have the same<br/>\n&gt; structure:<br/>\n&gt; 1. Create some test files and directories in an directory called &quot;source&quot;<br/>\n&gt; 2. Start the backup process (to backup the files/dirs in &quot;source&quot; to a<br/>\n&gt; directory called &quot;target&quot;)<br/>\n&gt; 3. Check whether all files in &quot;source&quot; exist also in &quot;target&quot;<br/>\n&gt; 4. Remove all files from the &quot;source&quot; and &quot;target&quot; directory so that the<br/>\n&gt; directories are empty for the next test.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If i execute the whole test set ten times, i have 6-7 successes and 3-4<br/>\n&gt; failures. The error messages say that files in the target directory<br/>\n&gt; could not be created or deleted (in the last step of the tests, see<br/>\n&gt; above) if there is a failure. One possibility i could think of is that<br/>\n&gt; the tests are not run sequentially, so they could have influence at each<br/>\n&gt; other. But as far as i know JUnit runs all tests in separate threads and<br/>\n&gt; those sequentially. Is that correct? Does anybody have any suggestions?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I use eclipse helios, JUnit 4.8.1, Java 1.6 and AspectJ<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Best regards,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Nils<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
