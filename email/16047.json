This would save lots of time. Is that true ?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This isn&#39;t true for me. I use the Junit tests within my IDE to exercise the<br/>\nclass I&#39;m writing. running them from ant outside of the IDE is the safety<br/>\nnet.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n* How can I convince managers and programmers that JUnit-based is<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; really possible for commercial software development ? Any differnece<br/>\n&gt; from open-source projects ?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Lead by example. Start using it. Learn to use Junit to write code faster<br/>\nthan anyone else on the team -- and with fewer bugs.  Your boss will be<br/>\ncoming to you.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Dan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
