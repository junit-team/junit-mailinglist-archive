Basically, I load each version up using my own class <br/>\nloader, and then compare them to eachother.  However, the way that I <br/>\ndesigned the program was that all the errors were stored, and then <br/>\njust printed out by the user however he wanted.  I wrote the code <br/>\nmyself (both the toolkit code and the junit code).  I have tried <br/>\nmaking my (BC) code more test worthy, as suggested earlier in this <br/>\nforum, such as instead of printing the results, I have a getList <br/>\nmethod so I can compare the list to a hardcoded list, however, this <br/>\ndoes not seem to fit in with the mentality of unit test writing.  Is <br/>\nthat a better picture of what I am trying to do?  I have a unit test <br/>\nrunning now, but I just feel that my design is very sloppy and <br/>\namateurish.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In junit@y..., Shane Duan &lt;sduan@b...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; If you can provide more information, I might have a better answer.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What kind of &#39;certain type of compatibility&#39; are you referring to?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &#39;my code&#39; mentioned in your earlier post is referring to your unit <br/>\ntesting code<br/>\n&gt; is that correct?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; As to your question of add, I suspect that what you have learned in <br/>\nschool is<br/>\n&gt; in procedure language instead of object oriented language.  So if <br/>\nyou have two<br/>\n&gt; variable &#39;a&#39; and &#39;b&#39;, in procedure language it is &#39;add(a, b)&#39;, <br/>\nwhile in object<br/>\n&gt; oriented language it is &#39;a.add(b)&#39;.  In fact, I think in the early <br/>\ndays of C++<br/>\n&gt; the compile just convert a.add(b) to add(a, b).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hope that is clear.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Jason Rogers wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; He said he was the author of the code, so I don&#39;t think that will <br/>\nwork.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Keith Ray [mailto:keith.ray@e...]<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Tuesday, August 07, 2001 1:27 PM<br/>\n&gt; &gt; To: &#39;junit@y...&#39;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [junit] re - novice QA<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;I am invading your group as a mere QA intern. . .  I am supposed <br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;implement JUnit tests on code that I have just written. However, <br/>\nwhat<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;I have learned in school does not seem to apply here!  We learned<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;that if the method is an &quot;add&quot; method, give it two numbers,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;and &quot;assert&quot; that the correct addition is performed, and so <br/>\non. . .<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;well, I have no clue what to assert!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Quick rundown of what I am testing:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Basically, my code is using the Reflection class to check all the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;members of a class for a certain type of compatibility.  Most <br/>\nmethods<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;add errors to an error vector, and then there is a simple print<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;function to print out the vector... How on earth do I test this<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;class??<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Thanks for any help in advance!!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; You should pair-program with the writer of this code to refactor <br/>\nit to be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; more testable. Search the web for &quot;test-first-design&quot;, &quot;test-<br/>\nfirst-coding&quot;,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;refactoring&quot;, etc... search Ward&#39;s Wiki as well:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?FindPage\">http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?FindPage</a>&gt;.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; junit-unsubscribe@y...<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
