This kind of stubbing is often called &quot;mock object&quot;\n(http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?MockObject).\n\nA similar approach is presented in\nhttp://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ExtremeProgrammingTestingGuiIntensiveApps\n\nhope that helps,\nJohannes\n\ntchaffee@... wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; I have an class that will draw vertically centered, line-wrapped text onto a\n&gt; background image.  We use this class to dynamically generate buttons for our\n&gt; web site.  I would like to add testing to the class that draws the text on\n&gt; the background image.  So far my only idea for testing a class like this is\n&gt; to visually inspect the results.  Any ideas on how one could use JUnit to\n&gt; test something like this?  I want to verify that the image generated by this\n&gt; class is in fact the background image with the given text and that it is\n&gt; vertically centered and that the line wrapping works as expected.\n&gt; \n&gt; A similar problem that would seem as difficult as above would be a class\n&gt; that modifies a sound file.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Todd Chaffee\n\n",
