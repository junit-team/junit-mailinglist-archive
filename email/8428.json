However, I have not found an article that explains the<br/>\n&gt;advantages of unit testing vs integration testing.  My perhaps naive hunch<br/>\n&gt;is that the cost-per-bug-eliminated of unit testing is higher than that of<br/>\n&gt;integration testing.  It appears this way because a single integration test<br/>\n&gt;tests a lot more code than a single unit test and takes about the same<br/>\n&gt;amount of time to construct.  Plus it seems to me that a whole suite of<br/>\n&gt;unit<br/>\n&gt;tests with 100% code coverage cannot guarantee that even the simplest<br/>\n&gt;system<br/>\n&gt;wide behavior is correct (e.g. the web page appears).  Am I wrong about<br/>\n&gt;this?  Can someone refer me information about this topic.  A scientific<br/>\n&gt;study paper with real numbers would be welcome.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You have it right. Programmer Tests (your &quot;unit tests&quot;) play an entirely different role than Integration Tests. The goal of Programmer Tests is to ensure that object-level behavior is correct (as expected), but may not guarantee correct collaboration among objects. That&#39;s why we have Customer Tests and Integration Tests.<br/>\n<br/>\nCustomer Tests allow us to be confident that we&#39;re building the right features.<br/>\n<br/>\nProgrammer Tests allow us to be confident that our objects do what we think we asked them to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nIntegration Tests allow us to be confident that our objects play nicely with one another. Integration Tests are often headless (UI-less) Customer Tests.<br/>\n<br/>\nProgrammer Tests run faster than Integration Tests, so we run them more often. That&#39;s one of their biggest benefits.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJ. B.
