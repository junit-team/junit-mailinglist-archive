If you are coding in a &#39;test-first&#39; style, then the tests will\ndrive your code, and any private methods you end up with must invariably be\ncalled by one of your public methods.  If you have a private method, and the\n_only_ way to test it is to use reflection, or make it public, or use an inner\nclass, what is it doing?  If its not used by any of your tested code, why is it\nthere at all?  I know other instances of the same class can call private\nmethods, but I have never yet seen an application that relied upon this feature,\nand if you have objects of the same class calling private methods on each other,\nI would consider that an indication that the design needs work.  Even if it is\nnecessary, surely the object making the private call must be doing so\n(ultimately) in response to a public/protected/package method call?  Which you\ncan test.\n\nIf your method chains are so large its hard to pinpoint the problem when a unit\ntest fails, then perhaps some refactoring is in order to break up the chain.  A\nmethod call should generally perform one discreet action.  In almost every\napplication I&#39;ve seen where hard-to-find bugs are causing problems, many of them\ncould be reduced by making the methods smaller, and having more of them.  As\nlong as each method does one well-defined thing, and is sensibly named, having\nmore small methods will cause less confusion than having methods that are 300\nlines long.\n\nRegards,\n\n-Darren\n\n\n[Information] -- PostMaster:\nThis transmission is intended solely for the addressee(s) and may be\nconfidential.
