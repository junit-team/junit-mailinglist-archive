The reason for that is not \nso obvious \n&gt; to me. I think positive, so I don&#39;t think you&#39;re a troll, I think \nit was your \n&gt; way to find out how DBC and TDD interact - just say something \nyou&#39;re not \n&gt; really convinced of yourself but hold that view to see what \narguments are \n&gt; against it. Please, next time just ask for these arguments instead \nof \n&gt; behaving like a time sink.\n\nIts strange that this forum uses censorship system before the \npostings appear.\nMust be a hot-headed community of JUnit users because this is \nnecessary.\n\nI was and am serious, all the time.\n\nForget now about DbC. We can discuss about it later (in a few \nweeks/month) again.\n\n&gt; Now to your questions:\n&gt; &gt; Does the framework has to provide mock objects for JUnit tests?\n&gt; No, it&#39;s not required that the framework provides the mock \nobjects. But it \n&gt; would be helpful.\n\nSomehow I can&#39;t imagine to use Mock objects without our framework to \nsupport it.\nWe are at the beginning in our company of creating ERP applications \nwith the\nframework and the know how is not good yet.\n\n&gt; &gt; Is it possible to use Mock objects when using a ERP framework?\n&gt; That depends on wether the framework deserves the name framework \nor not.\n&gt; A real framework consists of two parts: The API/SPI and the \nimplementation. If \n&gt; the framework is a real framework, you could simply implement the \nAPI/SPI \n&gt; yourself to create mock objects and replace the implementation.\n\nWhat means SPI?\n\n&gt; \n&gt; But your questions do not provide the information *where* and \n*why* you want \n&gt; to use Mock objects. So you program using the ERP API yourself? Or \nis it just \n&gt; a code generation tool like Versata?\n\nOur programs use the ERP framework API. It is no code generation \ntool.\nThe framework is very large and complex and still they work on it. \nIt is a\nbusiness framework which uses a component model and sits on top of \nEJB.\n\nI just want to use Mock objects for the database. The test data must \nbe coming\nfrom the test classes and not be inside the database. So we need \nMock objects\nI think. But I don&#39;t know how to create them since I still don&#39;t \nknow how\nour framework works inside and how Mock objects are used.\n\nNow you think it is not necessary that our framework supports Mock \nobjects?\n\n\n",
