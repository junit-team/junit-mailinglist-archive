I&#39;m not trying to bait you, but if you have a automated code\ntesting\n&gt;tool (let&#39;s be generic here, so no-one thinks that I&#39;m on the ParaSoft\n&gt;payroll :-) and it complains about your code then either the tool is\n&gt;defective or your code is sub-optimal.\n\nNot necessarily. \n\nIf I have a public API, it may be worthwhile to try to interpret the\ndozens of RuntimeExceptions that my code may throw, since this would\nhelp my clients decipher the problem. In this case, it would be nice to\nuse something like JTest to discover all the RuntimeExceptions my\npublic API might throw.\n\nIf, however, we deal with code deep within our library that the outside\nworld doesn&#39;t use directly, and if we can be reasonably sure that, for\nexample, Class A never passes a null reference to Class B, then it\nwould likely be overkill to worry about what happens when Class B\nreceives a null reference. As Ron Jeffries would say, if you&#39;re the\nonly client, then simply don&#39;t pass null! (Loose paraphrase, there.)\n\n&gt;&gt;Here is another way of putting it:\n&gt;&gt;Personally I think that the &#39;exposure&#39; of (mainly) NullPointers by\n&gt;&gt;applying generated tests that put nonsense parameter values in\nmethods\n&gt;&gt;does improve the quality of the product.\n&gt;\n&gt;Agreed. :-)\n\nWell, it can identify issues, but I&#39;m not sure that it improves\nquality, since it may lead to a morass of duplication of the form\n\n    if (blah == null) {\n        throw new IllegalArgumentException(&quot;Blah was null.&quot;);\n    }\n\nThat hurts the internal quality of the product.\n\n&gt;&gt;The motto &#39;Garbage in Garbage out&#39; still applies in this case. As an\n&gt;\n&gt;Not agreed. GIGO is only for non-robust code. I think that &quot;Garbage\nIn&quot;\n&gt;should cause appropriate guard conditions to be triggered and an\n&gt;appropriate response to be generated NPE or IAE (your choice). For\n&gt;anything other than the most trivial of code, I do not want to ever\n&gt;contribute to &quot;Garbage Out&quot;. As developers we usually have no control\nover\n&gt;the many potential ways that our code could be used, but we do have\n&gt;control over how it responds.\n\nOnce again, a public API is different from code whose only client is\nyou. :)\n\n&lt;snip /&gt;\n&gt;This is the concept of &quot;graceful degredation&quot;. A web browser is a very\n&gt;good example of this .... a lot of web pages have awful HTML and yet\nmost\n&gt;of them display acceptably, because the browser takes what it&#39;s given\nand\n&gt;does the best it can with it. A browser cannot throw an exception, but\nit\n&gt;can try to render what it&#39;s given. All software should do the best it\ncan\n&gt;with what it&#39;s given or when possible reject unacceptable inputs.\n\nI hate this, because the browser just throws away parts of a page, and\nit&#39;s not always easy to tell why that happened. It would be better, in\nmy opinion, if the browser at least complained to a log or something.\n\nJ. B.
