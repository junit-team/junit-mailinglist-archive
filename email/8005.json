    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-249562954\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt; &gt; It does not keep them from being invoked, but they only get invoked<br/>\n&gt; &gt; once per TestCase, not before and after each test method. Perhaps I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; was not clear when I stated what I was looking for. I want the behavior<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that is:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; setUp() -&gt; first test -&gt; tearDown()<br/>\n&gt; &gt; setUp() -&gt; next test -&gt; tearDown()<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ...<br/>\n&gt; &gt; setUp() -&gt; last test -&gt; tearDown()<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; But overriding runTest() produces:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; setUp() -&gt; first test -&gt; next test -&gt; last test -&gt; tearDown()<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; STOOOOOOOOOP!  What you have to do is really simple:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; - forget everything you know about runTest<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; - write your TestCases the old fashion way:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;      public void MyTest extends TestCase {<br/>\n&gt;          protected void setUp() { /* ... */ }<br/>\n&gt;          protected void tearDown() { /* ... */ }<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;          public void testFirst() { /* ... */ }<br/>\n&gt;          public void testSecond() { /* ... */ }<br/>\n&gt;      }<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Thanks for the suggestion. Once again, it was so obvious I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t see it. Doh!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; keep it simple :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m all for that!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; Only calling setUp() once before all testXXX() methods, and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; tearDown() once after all testXXX() methods.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You don&#39;t have to call anything, the framework does it for you.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s what I meant. Sorry I wasn&#39;t clearer.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; As far as the name passed to the TestCase not being the test method<br/>\n&gt; &gt; name, that does work as in my example, if you override runTest().<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; yes, if you overwrite runTest().  But this is not how JUnit is <br/>\n&gt; supposed to work (well AFAIK).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>As previously stated, I am aware it is rarely used this way, but<br/>\nthis was a question for understanding, not necessarily practicality.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; Once again, lest y&#39;all think I&#39;m completely nuts, I wasn&#39;t advocating<br/>\n&gt; &gt; this approach, just trying to understand the behavior since it is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; both possible and documented in the JUnit files.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I see what you mean.  The &quot;problem&quot; is that the documentation <br/>\n&gt; presents how the framework was developed (from day one) and it also <br/>\n&gt; presents options that IMO make little sense with the finished <br/>\n&gt; framework (like overwriting the runTest method) but not when the <br/>\n&gt; framework was young and immature.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I guess the historical angle had not occurred to me. That&#39;s an<br/>\ninteresting point of view. I will try to &quot;refactor&quot; my thinking<br/>\nwith this in mind and see if that changes my mind about how<br/>\nstatic invocation works.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Ok, don&#39;t start flaming me and presenting 10,000 good resons to <br/>\n&gt; overwrite runTest, please :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Never! You&#39;ve been very insightful.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks, Derek<br/>\n=====================================<br/>\n--- The Gunslinger<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:quikdraw@...\">quikdraw@...</a></div>",
