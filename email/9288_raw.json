Depending on the event type the \nevent is dispatched (using a map lookup) to the registered handler.\nNothing more.\n\nTo test this I started populating the event-&gt;handler map in the \nEventListener constructor (looking for the simplest possibile...).\nThis made the tests hard: I cannot test just the EventListener class \nbecause it was already filled with app specific handlers and was not \npossible to add other handlers.\nSo I moved the configuration of the EventListener outside.\nNow I have\n- EventListener: just receive the events, lookup handler and activate \nhandler\n- EventListenerFactory: create an EventListener configuring it for this app\n- a lot of single EventHandler\n\nNow I can test EventListener and each EventHandler without problems, but \nI cannot find any useful test for EventListenerFactory.\nThe only test I could write is to check that each of the Handler was \nregistered with the correct type, but so the test code would be \n&quot;identical&quot; to the Factory code and I don&#39;t see it very useful.\nAt the same time I do not like to have this class with no test at all.\nIf tomorrow I would move the type-&gt;handler configuration infos to a file \nI think the problems would disappears: I&#39;d write the test just for the \nfile reading code and I&#39;d have not code without tests.\nThe configuration check would clearly move to the functional test side.\n\nThe problem is that I&#39;m using that class just to configure the app. I \nthink it&#39;s a good thing to have some startup classes to contain all app \nspecific infos.\n\nDo you have a similar problem? How do you handle it?\n\nThanks\n\n\nLorenzo\n\n\n",
