[It&#39;s not answered in the FAQ nor in the cook\nbook etc.] I&#39;ve been using JUnit (and TDD) for a fair while now, but I have a\nproblem that I&#39;m about 90% sure is mere blindness on my part, but perhaps \nnot. \n\nWe have an interface (Graph) with multiple implementations (A and B). [Some\nnames have been changed to avoid complications.] I have a test case\nAbstractTestGraph with an abstract method Graph getGraph(), where the\ntests test the Graph(s) that getGraph() returns, and TestA/TestB define\ngetGraph() to return instances of A/B as appropriate. So far, so good, and\njust as suggested in one of the Junit documents. The code for each test\ncase is nice and short.\n\nWell ... I lied about A and B; it&#39;s more like A, B, C, and X. And likely to\nbe more, since Y and Z exist but may not be properly included in the\ntest suite at the moment.\n\n(1) How can I write a test generator which takes A.class, X.class etc as\narguments and constructs the necessary suite? The obvious-to-me code\n\n    public static TestCase makeMyTest( final Class someGraph )\n        {\n        class TestSomeGraph extends AbstractTestGraph\n            {\n            public TestSomeGraph( String name ) { super( name ); }\n            public static TestSuite suite() { return new TestSuite( \nTestSomeGraph ); }\n            public Graph getGraph() \n                 { return someGraph.getConstructor( new Class[] {} \n).newInstance( new Object [] {} ); }\n            }\n        }\n\ndoesn&#39;t work, because TestSomeGraph isn&#39;t public, so junit can&#39;t reflect to \nit.\nAnd Java, bless it&#39;s cotton socks, has a hissy fit if you try and make the \nnested\nclass public.\n\nAnd there&#39;s more. Different instances of Graph have differing capabilities, eg\nsome of them are read-only, some of them handle transactions, etc. I&#39;d\nlike the test generator to only add those tests that are relevant given the\nappropriate capabilities. My plan was to arrange that makeMyTest would\nlook at the current capabilities [which would be set up per-class] and replace\n`suite` with something that added in just those tests that were needed\n(refactoring AbstractTestGraph into the subgroups). Since makeMyTest\ndoesn&#39;t work, I can&#39;t do that either ...\n\nSo ... am I dead-ended in the wrong alley? Missing something obvious?\nMissing something subtle? Any advice would be welcome. If I have to\nhack junit source code I will, but I feel that surely I don&#39;t need to ...\n\n-- \nChris &quot;electric hedgehog&quot; Dollin\nC FAQs at: http://www.faqs.org/faqs/by-newsgroup/comp/comp.lang.c.html\nC welcome: http://www.angelfire.com/ms3/bchambless0/welcome_to_clc.html\n\n\n",
