Isn&#39;t it obvious that quite often, the<br/>\n&gt;  former approach will take longer than the latter?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think it _can_ be like that but it is often hard to know up front<br/>\nwhen it _will_ be like that. What you&#39;re after, I think, is to compare<br/>\n&quot;TDD religiously&quot; to &quot;TDD pragmatically&quot;. The second sure has a nice<br/>\nring to it compared to the first. The advantage of the first IMO is<br/>\nthat you never have to think wether to go one way or the other, you<br/>\njust &quot;do&quot; which also saves time given that it is the right descision<br/>\nmost of the time.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNow to your &quot;above&quot; examples that I moved to be &quot;below&quot;:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  &gt; &gt; With test first, you have something like:  Test v1, Code v1, Test v2,<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; Code<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; v2, Test v3, Code v3.  Check in.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>To me Test v1, Code v1, Test v2, code v2, Test v3, Code v3. Check in.<br/>\nsounds bigger than:<br/>\nTest a little, code a little, test a little, code a little, test a<br/>\nlittle code a little. Check in<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  &gt; &gt; If you postpone your testing a bit, you have:  Code v1, Code v2, Code<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; v3,<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; Test v3, Commit.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>While this sure /looks/ attractive I think the comparison seems overly<br/>\nsimplified. I have a few questions:<br/>\n<br/>\n- I&#39;m not convinced that the tasks are of the same size in your two<br/>\nexamples. Can you really just count them to make a conclusion which is<br/>\nfaster?<br/>\n<br/>\n- A big part of writing a test is thinking about how something should<br/>\nwork so that you can code it. I don&#39;t see that part disapearing when<br/>\nyou remove the test. Question is, will thinking be easier, harder or<br/>\nthe same when you defer the test-part?<br/>\n<br/>\n- If you can code it, you know how it works...  then shouldn&#39;t writing<br/>\na test be fast?<br/>\n<br/>\n- If you don&#39;t know how to code it so that you have to redo things a<br/>\ncouple of times. Aren&#39;t tests good for exploring those situations?<br/>\nCouldn&#39;t it even be faster or to you do things in more steps?<br/>\n<br/>\n- Will the above be faster/better for beginners or experienced coders?<br/>\nIn your opinion does it matter?<br/>\n<br/>\n- What about the design? Do you think you will have the same<br/>\nadvantages when &quot;retrofitting&quot; tests or does that depend on who wrote<br/>\nthe code initially?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can always make the choice to write the tests after but wouldn&#39;t<br/>\nyou be missing out on a lot of the really good stuff?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; The latter approach will get you to your goal much faster.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think in /most/ situations, from /my/ experience /I/ disagree.<br/>\n<br/>\n/Joakim Ohlrogge</div>",
