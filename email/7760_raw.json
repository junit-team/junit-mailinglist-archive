I&#39;m not\n&gt; using mock objects and directly test with the database.  The \nreason is that I\n&gt; test a database access layer, so I really need to test with the \ndatabases I support.\n\nBut we use a framework which another company offers. They have base \nclasses and \nbase components which provide persistance to the database layer.\n\nWe create components by using their base classes and base \ncomponents. If we don&#39;t use \nmock objects then we test implicitly their framework. But this \ncompany tests their \nframework (which includes the database layer) already.\n\n&gt; I believe that you have to test with the database anyway so I \nwould at least\n&gt; have some integration tests that are using the databases directly.\n\nOkay. I think this can be done by providing the real object instead \nof the mock\nobject.\n\n&gt; I would first present JUnit and set up Continuous Integration (or \na nightly\n&gt; build).  Once the developers are more confident in their tests, \nyou can\n&gt; introduce TDD.  I don&#39;t think that TDD is a requirement for good \nsoftware. \n&gt; Tests definitively are.\n\nI must wait and see.\n\n&gt; I would also introduce Eclipse/PMD and check out the errors in the \ncode.\n\nWe already use Eclipse. What is PMD? A plugin?\n\n&gt; -Vladimir\n\n\n",
