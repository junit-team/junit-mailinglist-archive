In one case I found that a class\n&gt; that had one method mocked was using the real method in 4.4 (which\n&gt; seems wrong) and was using the mocked method in 4.5 (which seems  \n&gt; right).\n&gt;\n&gt; That is, it seems as if a bug was fixed from 4.4 to 4.5.\n&gt;\n&gt; I fixed that one test of ours and now I am looking at a few others for\n&gt; similar situations.  I am mostly just curious.  Thanks.\n&gt;\n&gt; --- Patrick\n&gt;\n\nSteve Freeman\nhttp://www.mockobjects.com\n\nWinner of the Agile Alliance Gordon Pask award 2006\n\n\n\n\n",
