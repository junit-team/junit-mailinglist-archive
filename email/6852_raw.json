I named\nit &quot;Extensible Java Unit-testing Framework&quot; (ejuf for short).  This\nproject is using a reusable assertion mechanism.  I am using the Jakarta\n&quot;Byte Code Engineering Library&quot; to implement assertion interfaces into\ntestable objects.\n\nFor example, let&#39;s say you want to use XML assertions and DB assertions\nin the same test case, you would do something like this:\npublic abstract MyXmlAndDbCase implements Testable, XmlAssertions,\nDbAssertions, EqualityAssertions {\n   public void testSomething() {\n      // Uses an object that implements XmlAssertions that was previously\n      configured\n      assertXmlEquals(...);\n\n      // Uses an object that implements DbAssertions that was previously\n      configured\n      assertDbEquals(...); // I don&#39;t know actual method names, but this\n      is for illustration purposes\n\n      // Uses an object that implements EqualityAssertions that was\n      previously configured\n      assertEquals(...);\n   }\n}\n\nThis way of doing things provides me with a completely vendor and\nextension neutral way of doing things.  Additionnaly, I have other things\nin there to help testing.\n\nFor more information, you may access the project&#39;s CVS repository.  I\nhave successfully used EJUF in two or three projects of mine.  Obviously,\nEJUF is able to test itself :)\n\nI consider the code ready for prime-time, except that there is almost no\ndocumentation.  WARNING:  There is a failure in the tests right now\nbecause that is where I left off.  I had started doing XmlConfiguration\nstuff, but that is not finished.  But the rest is actually very usable.\n\nIf you want to take a look at the project and report back, I would be\nmore than happy to help and respond to comments, although such\ndiscussions might be more appropriate on EJUF&#39;s mailing lists...\n\nThank you,\nFrancois Beausoleil\nhttp://sourceforge.net/projects/ejuf/\n\nOn Mon, 3 Feb 2003 10:49:57 +0900 (JST), &quot;Curt Sampson&quot;\n&lt;yahoo_sucks@...&gt; said:\n&gt; On Sun, 2 Feb 2003, Scott Stirling wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Why not just extend TestCase with specialized, re-usable, TestCase types?\n&gt; \n&gt; I do already. In fact, many times: we have a base test case for our\n&gt; company which adds various handy generic stuff (such as byte-array\n&gt; comparisons), inheriting from that often a test case for a project\n&gt; adding some project specific-stuff, inheriting from that in certain\n&gt; packages a package-specific test case adding stuff for the servlet or\n&gt; DB testing or whatever, and so on.\n&gt; \n&gt; Unfortunately, it&#39;s not very modular; if someone supplies me with\n&gt; a ExtendedTestCaseOne and another person supplies me with an\n&gt; ExtendedTestCaseTwo, each of which has certain features I want, I can&#39;t\n&gt; inherit from both. And again, the test cases tend to collect more and\n&gt; more code, becoming this massive objects with massive functionality (and\n&gt; correspondingly massive tests)....\n&gt; \n&gt; My primary feeling here (whether supportable or not) is that a TestCase\n&gt; could be a lot smaller and simpler if we could move most of the\n&gt; assertion checking and assertion message generation code out of it.\n&gt; As well it would also give us the ability to easily add different\n&gt; ways of asserting where and when we need them, without having to use\n&gt; inheritance to bring in new implemenations of something. (I&#39;m a big fan\n&gt; of type inheritance; I&#39;m rather dubious about the use of inheritance for\n&gt; implemenation purposes only.)\n&gt; \n&gt; cjs\n&gt; -- \n&gt; Curt Sampson  &lt;cjs@...&gt;   +81 90 7737 2974   http://www.netbsd.org\n&gt;     Don&#39;t you know, in this new Dark Age, we&#39;re all light.  --XTC\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
