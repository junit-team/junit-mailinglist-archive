First some words to the en=\r\nvironment:\n\nIn the project I need the feature we currently have 9 developer=\r\ns and it\nmight be more. Even freelancers. There are something around 20k te=\r\nsts. What\nwe want to achieve is to enable a global timeout rule that applie=\r\ns\ndifferent timeouts to tests depending on their category (eg SlowTests.cla=\r\nss\nmay take longer than other tests). Also there are other things to take i=\r\nnto\nconsideration (eg is some context already loaded, otherwise the timeout=\r\n\nwill be increased).\nThis rule already exists and is registered in some abs=\r\ntract base class. Its\nworking fine.\nHaving this amount of tests makes it ve=\r\nry hard to make sure that every\nclass is annotated with it. Also not all te=\r\nsts inherit from the abstract\ntest class and I would like to keep it that w=\r\nay. It would be just some work\nto put the rule in every test but what about=\r\n tests written in the future.\nI need to make sure that the rule is applied =\r\nto every test especially when\nthe developer forgets about it. Its a rule th=\r\nat is intended to avoid\ndevelopers slowing down jenkins build by writing sl=\r\now tests without\nannotating them as such.\n\nThat said using a different runn=\r\ner is not an option. Also we already have a\nhard time mixing spring-runner,=\r\n mockito-runner, junitparam-runner (btw\nwe/you should copy some of that beh=\r\naviour as it is a lot more flexible than\njunit parameterized test [1])) aso=\r\n-behaviour (btw: we/you need to think\nabout the runner-concept. it would be=\r\n a lot better to have one runner and\nregistering behaviour to it (eg being =\r\nable to register as many &quot;runners&quot; as\nI want to).\n\nScanning classpath is a =\r\ngood thing. We already use classpathsuite [2]. That\nenables us to create su=\r\nites without having to specify all classes in it\n(another feature that woul=\r\nd very well fit junit). We could for example\nannotate a rule with a classif=\r\nier (basepacke, package or package.classname)\nand it would get applied to e=\r\nverything that matches. But this kind of\nbehaviour would introduce a comple=\r\ntely new way of configuration to junit (a\nlittle cdi/spring-ish). Maybe it =\r\nwould be a good idea to overthink the\njunit-concept leading this direction =\r\nanyway but I get the feeling its a\nlittle too much for this concern.\n\nAt la=\r\nst I do not think the external switch is a problem as its highly\noptional. =\r\nIf you use it, you know what you are doing. Dont you think so?\n\n[1] https:/=\r\n/code.google.com/p/junitparams/\n[2] http://johanneslink.net/projects/cpsuit=\r\ne.jsp\n\n\n2013/4/29 Kevin Cooney &lt;kcooney@...&gt;\n\n&gt; Henning,\n&gt;\n&gt; Sorry f=\r\nor the lack of response. JUnit is maintained by volunteers, and\n&gt; sometimes=\r\n our day jobs get busy. I was waiting for David to respond (I am a\n&gt; someti=\r\nmes contributor) but here are my thoughts.\n&gt;\n&gt; This is an interesting idea.=\r\n Note that you could get what you want with a\n&gt; custom runner.\n&gt;\n&gt; My conce=\r\nrn with adding Rules via system properties that someone running the\n&gt; tests=\r\n in their IDE would see different results compared to the test runs\n&gt; from =\r\nMaven. Sure, you could tell your IDE to run the tests with the same\n&gt; syste=\r\nm properties, but it would be unexpected for most people to have to\n&gt; take =\r\na special step to make the tests run the same way as they did in the\n&gt; cont=\r\ninuous build.\n&gt;\n&gt; Could you find some way to define the global rules via co=\r\nde? Perhaps you\n&gt; could add a DynamicRule to all of your tests that could a=\r\npply the addition\n&gt; rules. Alternatively, you could have a class in the sam=\r\ne package as the\n&gt; tests that defined the global rules for tests in that pa=\r\nckage (though I&#39;m\n&gt; not sure there is a platform-independent way to scan al=\r\nl of the classes in\n&gt; a package that works for all runtime/deployment envir=\r\nonments)\n&gt;\n&gt; -- Kevin\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; On Mon, Apr 29, 2013 at 7:09 AM, Henning Gro=DF=\r\n &lt;igaffai@...\n&gt; &gt;wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; **\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi!\n&gt; &gt; I have a us=\r\ne-case where I need to enable rules based on external\n&gt; &gt; parameters.
