Where I have seen it fail miserably and repeatedly is when <br/>\n&quot;external&quot; testers (converted programmers) try to write object-level <br/>\ntests for code they&#39;re not permitted to or don&#39;t know how to change.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;re the first person to tell me they had this working, so I&#39;d never <br/>\nthought it possible before. I&#39;m glad to hear it&#39;s working for you, and <br/>\nI&#39;ll keep it in mind the next time this discussion rolls around.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
