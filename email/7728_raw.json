There are severa=\r\nl issues with your code, in addition to answering your original question.\n\n=\r\n1. Your comments are useless and actually dangerous. I say this with love. =\r\nStop writing silly comments when the code says exactly what it does already=\r\n.\n\nEXAMPLE:\n&gt;     // This member variable will hold account balance\n&gt;     p=\r\nublic int balance;\n\nThe following is already clear enough.\n\n&gt;     public in=\r\nt balance;\n\nYou may ask why this matters. Here is why. In your code you hav=\r\ne:\n\n&gt;public class Interest extends Account {\n&gt;     \n&gt;     // This member va=\r\nriable will hold account balance\n&gt;     private int interest_rate;\n&gt;     pri=\r\nvate int acumulated_interest;\n\nTHAT COMMENT IS WRONG!\n\nYou have just demons=\r\ntrated the reason why unnecessary comments are not just unnecessary, they a=\r\nre DANGEROUS: your comment and code do not match. Three months from now, wh=\r\nich one should you trust? At a minimum, you need to read the code to find o=\r\nut.\n\nStop doing this immediately. You will find life much nicer.\n\n2. Use be=\r\ntter names.\n\n&quot;JU&quot; means nothing to anyone, except maybe yourself. I renamed=\r\n the test case classes to &quot;AccountTest&quot; and &quot;InterestTest&quot;, because THAT IS=\r\n WHAT THEY ARE!\n\n3. Don&#39;t leave empty tests.\n\nYou have an empty test in Acc=\r\nountTest. That test LOOKS like it passes, but only because there is nothing=\r\n to fail. I replaced it with &quot;fail(&quot;Not yet implemented.&quot;)&quot;.\n\n4. One of you=\r\nr tests doesn&#39;t make sense.\n\ndeposit() answers the new balance, but withdra=\r\nw() answers the amount withdrawn. Why have this strange behavior?\n\n    publ=\r\nic void testwithdraw2() {\n        assertEquals(myAccount.withdraw(4000), 40=\r\n00);\n    } //End of method\n\nI changed this test to read\n\n    public void te=\r\nstwithdraw2() {\n        assertEquals(myAccount.withdraw(4000), 6000);\n    }=\r\n\n\nbecause this behavior makes much more sense, compared with the behavior o=\r\nf deposit().\n\nI ran AccountTest. Of the three tests that you implemented, t=\r\nwo passed, so I fixed withdraw() to behave the same way as deposit().\n\nI th=\r\nen ran InterestTest. Of the five tests that you implemented, they all pass.=\r\n\n\nSince you got the inheritance stuff right, what&#39;s the problem?\n\n&gt;So said =\r\nbalakrishnan sengodan on 4/13/2003 --------------------\n&gt;Did any one test i=\r\nnheritance successfully, will you\n&gt;please send me the classes under the tes=\r\nt and the\n&gt;associated testing classes. \n&lt;snip /&gt;\n\nJ.
