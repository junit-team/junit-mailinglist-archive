Why? When? How =\r\noften?\n\n&gt;Especially since I am in a large company setting,\n&gt;if the next guy=\r\n comes along at looks at my tests, he can see some of the\n&gt;comments I have =\r\nmade. Maybe not make some of the same mistakes. etc... It\n&gt;is never, ever, =\r\na bad idea to document.\n\nI love you like a brother, but this last statement=\r\n is a howler.\n\nIn a large company setting, you may find it useful to provid=\r\ne high-level documentation, such as a roadmap to the system or a descriptio=\r\nn of its metaphor; however, it is *always* a bad idea to document if no-one=\r\n is reading the documentation. If you don&#39;t know who your audience is and y=\r\nou don&#39;t have proof that such an audience even exists, then producing docum=\r\nentation for that fictitious or non-existent audience is generally a waste =\r\nof time and energy. One exception: if you benefit the act of writing docume=\r\nntation, and if that benefit is not as easy to come by another way, then do=\r\n document whatever you need to document.\n\nA top time-waster on software pro=\r\njects is writing useless documentation instead of clear code.\n\nTake care.\n\n=\r\nPS: Yes, I&#39;ve worked on a project where no external documentation was requi=\r\nred. When a new employee came on board and began working with the code, he =\r\nsaid, &quot;This code is so easy to read, I already understand what&#39;s going on.&quot;=\r\n Since I also benefitted from the easy-to-read code while I was building th=\r\ne system, the effort I put into making the code self-documenting was well w=\r\north it. In other words, if the code tells the story, then that is often en=\r\nough.\n\n\nJ. B.
