This semester I&#39;m in Data Structures and our\nfirst project is to write implementations of a List. Our classes\nimplement a ListADT interface, but we have to write three different\nimplementations, one using Fixed Arrays, on that can &quot;Dynamically&quot;\nresize arrays, and a Link List. We also have to write a tests to\nensure our list implementations are good. Having heard of JUnit I\nthought this would be a good time to learn it. So far it has worked\nfine for testing a single implementation. I have several TestCase\nclasses testing different aspects of the list, and have added them to\na sutie so that they can be all be run at once. However, I want to be\nable to test all three implementations at once in on fell swoop, with\nout having to write three sets of test cases and three test suites.\n\nI have abstracted out the creation of lists to a utility class, so\nthat my TestCases call methods of the Utility class for a new list,\nthis way I only have to change the constructors in one class, when I\nwant to use my other implementations of the list. I would like to be\nable to pass my test cases the object to use for creating lists so\nthat I can have a different untility class for each impelmentation. So\nI need to be able to pass a untility object to each test case before\nit runs any of the tests. So far I haven&#39;t found a way to do this JUnit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
