I don&#39;t see how having an additional\n&gt; &gt; org.something.util.CalendarParser class could make any library\nharder to\n&gt; &gt; understand and use. Hell, that class could even be extracted to a\ndifferent\n&gt; &gt; binary, so that an outside developer wouldn&#39;t see it at all.\n&gt; \n&gt; Have you really never tried to work your way through a mess of JavaDoc \n&gt; with no easy way to figure out what classes you needed and what you \n&gt; could ignore? Has it been that long since you learned a new API? \n&gt; Featuritis isn&#39;t just a problem for applications. It applies to \n&gt; libraries too. Smaller is better. Too large an API becomes a problem.\n\nWhich is why you can partition your deliverable into an API and a\nruntime JAR. What&#39;s wrong with that suggestion?\n\nYou keep missing the distinction between &quot;public&quot; and &quot;published&quot;:\n&quot;published&quot; is a social convention enforced by social contracts.\nProviding a runtime JAR, to be available at _runtime_, and not\n_compile time_, is an excellent way of enforcing these conventions.\nSimilarly, excluding packages from JavaDoc works well.\n\nHow long has it been since I learned a new API? About 27 hours, from\nfirst experience to plugging it into an existing application with all\ntests passing. Oh, and that API had a runtime jar and an API jar. ;)\n\n\n\n",
