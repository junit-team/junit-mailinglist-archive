At a minimum, the two tests make the same assertions.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Either<br/>\n&gt;that, or you decouple yourself from everything you do, a purist goal of no<br/>\n&gt;real world value. Code used code, that is a dependency.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You can have interface dependency without implementation dependency. That is the decoupling mechanism that tends to eliminate your test dependency issue.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;snip /&gt;<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;This is all about test content dependency -- side effects -- and I never<br/>\n&gt;meant that. Why get a fruit basket full of errors when fruit is bad? I was<br/>\n&gt;actually trying to reduce this mess of an output to &quot;the *possible* root<br/>\n&gt;cause -- and if nothing else, a place to start cleaning up&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The closer an object is to the core of your application, the more important (I think) that failures in that object yell loudly and annoyingly. If your project has a big problem with core classes failing on a regular basis, then maybe you have a process/people problem, as opposed to a technical problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd lest you think I&#39;m just deflecting, I&#39;m not; I am sincerely trying to balance providing you a solution with protecting the integrity of the core of JUnit.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJ.
