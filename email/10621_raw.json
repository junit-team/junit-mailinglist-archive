I don&#39;t \nknow what my nick name was. But my first topic was a discussion \nabout the value of JUnit compared to Design by Contract.\n\nIt was very controversial. At times I asked myself, if I was right \nwhen many gurus here were arguing against my opinion. I will not \nrepeat the discussion.\n\nBut I have seen that the DBC inventor himself seems to support my \nopinion recently: http://www.artima.com/intv/contestP.html\n\nI have only read the summary until now. Maybe you are interested in \nwhat he has to say in favor of Contract-Driven Development. I like \nthe idea of Design by Contract. And I think that it could make \ntraditional JUnit tests obsolete, since the test cases could \nautomatically be generated from the Contracts. I think this is what \nParasoft JTest already does.\n\nDon&#39;t misunderstand me. I like JUnit. But I always look for better \nways to solve my problems. So I hope you are as open as me to new \nsolutions and ideas.\n\n\n\n",
