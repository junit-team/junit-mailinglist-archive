But If I only want to run certain tests. I put a letter in front of the test that I don&#39;t want to run, and it is ignored at runtime. I do this because junit usually runs the methods that have the word test in front of it, and ignores the others.\n \nIf there is a better, or proper way to do this please let me know.\n \nMichael A.

I need to run a \nmethod that connect to a RMI registry and gets references to all \nservices.\nAs I need to accomplish this once before my tests, I&#39;m satisfied on \nrunning it on the setUp() method of a TestSetup. When I&#39;m calling the \ntests, I pass a suite to the TestSetup and everything works fine.\nThe problem is that I need to specify, through the command-line, if I \nwant to run a particular test or the whole suite of them. As I&#39;m \nusing ant, it&#39;s something like this:\n\nant ---&gt; runs the whole suite of tests\nant &lt;nameoftestcase&gt; ---&gt; runs only a particular test case\n\nBecause of the precondition, I run into trouble. If I let the \nprecondition method into the TestSetup method, I lose it when I run a \nsingle test case. If I put it on each TestCase code (on a superclass \nfor example) I&#39;ll have a lot of redundancy when I run the suite.\nI&#39;ve tried also to run the connection with the RMI before running \njunit, as another Ant task, but it doesn&#39;t work. I don&#39;t know what \nhappens in this case, but it seems to me that another JVM is issued \nand the tests can&#39;t access the references created by the connection \nmethod.\n\nDoes anyone know what could I possibly do? Maybe another approach?\nThanks in advance,\nLeonardo Barros\n\n\nYahoo!
