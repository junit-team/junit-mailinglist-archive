The package names are the same as the classes I am testing but the source and test code have different parent nodes (in my case src and srctest).  This is easy to setup in eclipse (you have have multiple source trees and even different bin directories).  This makes it easier to bundle compiled code without the test binaries. (You don&#39;t have to have the exclude constructs in ant).  \n\n\n\nOn Monday, December 13, 2004, at 03:19PM, pam withnall &lt;pwithnall@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;I&#39;m a blackbox  tester and I put my tests outside the package tree. This\n&gt;is because my tests are based on business rules, not defined by the\n&gt;class methods. I had about 20 classes of tests testing only 1\n&gt;development class.\n&gt;But I think if you were a programmer, doing unit testing, you would keep\n&gt;them together.\n&gt;Just a thought.\n&gt;Pam.\n&gt;\n&gt;-----Original Message-----\n&gt;From: mark_lybarger [mailto:mark_lybarger@...] \n&gt;Sent: Saturday, December 11, 2004 1:23 AM\n&gt;To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;Subject: [junit] junit test class location - with or without source\n&gt;code.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;i&#39;m looking for arguments for and against keeping junit test classes\n&gt;outside if the projects main source tree.  maybe this could be a pole,\n&gt;but i&#39;m after the arguments more than what everyone actually is doing.\n&gt;\n&gt;thanks.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n",
