He has been\n&gt; &gt; doing some macroscopic integration testing with the latest\n&gt; &gt; CVS of a large number of projects including every Apache\n&gt; &gt; project and quite a few outside Apache.  He has built an\n&gt; &gt; automated notification system when changes to the code base\n&gt; &gt; affect other projects.  For instance, JUnit is used in a\n&gt; &gt; number of Apache projects, and a recent change forces all\n&gt; &gt; the current projects testing to break.  Their test cases\n&gt; &gt; won&#39;t compile.  I highly recommend allowing him to add\n&gt; &gt; this mailing list (junit@y...) to the list of\n&gt; &gt; automatic notifications.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Basically what will happen is that if JUnit fails to compile,\n&gt; &gt; due to changes in dependencies of other projects changing,\n&gt; &gt; then GUMP will notify you of that change.  Also, when a change\n&gt; &gt; you committed breaks other projects, you will be notified.\n&gt; \n&gt; Notification that junit failed to compile can be done, but that is \nnot what\n&gt; happened here.   I&#39;m not sure that automatic notification when any \nother\n&gt; project fails would be helpful.  If I see a problem in one project \nthat\n&gt; looks to be caused by somebody else, I try to do some isolation and \nmanual\n&gt; notification.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; The whole reason for this is so that the preferred method of\n&gt; &gt; deprecating old APIs is enforced, and changes to the API are\n&gt; &gt; not concidered lightly.\n&gt; \n&gt; In this case, there were two classes of errors introduced in last \nnight&#39;s\n&gt; build.  One was that a deprecated API was removed.  That is quite\n&gt; reasonable, and gump is helping to get the word out that if people \nwere\n&gt; ignoring this deprecation warning up to this point, they really \nshould plan\n&gt; for it at this time.  It is remotely possible that a groundswell \nwill form\n&gt; asking that this deprecated API be kept on longer, but more likely \nin my\n&gt; opinion is that people will simply move up.\n&gt; \n&gt; The other dealt with class loader issues, and I saw that a related \nchange\n&gt; was made in junit at the same time.  It is not clear at this time, \nhowever,\n&gt; that that change caused the breakage.\n&gt; \n&gt; I may be in the minority in this mailing list, but discussion on the\n&gt; removal of APIs that are actively seems like an appropriate topic \nfor this\n&gt; mailing list.\n&gt; \n&gt; =- Sam Ruby\n\n\n\n\n\n",
