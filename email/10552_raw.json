Then, in order to get green bar we wrapped\nthe test in a time bomb block:\n\nif (currentDate.isAfter(expirationDate)) {\n   ... run test ...\n}\n\nThe approach is feasible in the cases when you know a fix is supposed(!)\nto come at some appointed time.  One problem with this approach however,\nis that the test is not run unless you have passed the expiration\npoint.  At this time the system may have evolved to a point that the\ntest will need major recoding in order to work.\n\nAnother solution I have used is to wrap the test in a FailableTest\nframework so that it always gets run but is reported elsewhere.  The\neasiest way to do this is to override runTest() and catch throwable. \nYou then need to come up with a way to report that the test failed.  \n\nHaving more than one feedback point can obviously lead to headaches, as\nit did in the team I was in, so we finally evolved that solution to\nextending the UI framework and adding a warning type of failure that\nturned the bar yellow.  That may require a lot more work than what you\nare up for if you are running in Eclipse.  The team I was on at the time\nscoped it out at about 20 - 30 man hours, b/c no one knew the Eclipse\nplugin environment.  The implementation in the vanilla-JUnit framework\nwas not very hard, so once you get past the SWT gotchas and the plugin\nframework of Eclipse, it may not be that tedious.\n\n-- \nJason Rogers\n\n&quot;Where there is no vision, the people perish...&quot;\nBible, Proverbs 29:18\n\n\n",
