I&#39;m not afraid to write long method names, but sometimes<br/>\n&gt; it gets out of hand and I need a paragraph to explain the situation.<br/>\n&gt; Generally, this is testing some kind of complicated business logic,<br/>\n&gt; where the word &quot;logic&quot; here is often a cruel double-entendre.  An<br/>\n&gt; example:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; public void <br/>\n&gt; testMultipleCustomerPurchaseOrderEntriesForOneSalesOrderLine();<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The test method is about a page of code, on the heavy side of the<br/>\n&gt; average for our codebase but nothing gigantic.  Still, I felt it<br/>\n&gt; needed a comment in plain english, which is:<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It&#39;s good that you had that feeling and didn&#39;t ignore it.  It meant <br/>\nthat you wanted to communicate something to the reader that you felt <br/>\nwas missing in the code, or that wasn&#39;t easy to grok from reading the <br/>\ncode.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Tests that this mapper creates multiple customerPurchaseOrder entries<br/>\n&gt; associated with the sales order line, when multiples exist across line<br/>\n&gt; items.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I try to arrange my test case classes around common text fixtures.  One <br/>\nside effect of doing that is it gives me an extra layer of context (a <br/>\nnamespace) on top of the test method name.  So, given my limited <br/>\nknowledge of your problem domain, I might have a test case like this:<br/>\n<br/>\n   public class OneSalesOrderLineTest extends TestCase {<br/>\n<br/>\n     public void setUp() {<br/>\n       // fixture for one sales order line<br/>\n     }<br/>\n<br/>\n     public void testCreateMultipleCustomerPurchaseOrderEntries() {<br/>\n     }<br/>\n<br/>\n     public void testSomethingElseAboutOneSalesOrderLine() {<br/>\n     }<br/>\n   }<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I&#39;m reading tests in this class, I know I&#39;m in the context of one <br/>\nsales order line.  That is, there are no test methods in <br/>\nOneSalesOrderLineTest() that don&#39;t use all of the fixture objects in <br/>\nsetUp().<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; This particular example is partly about readability (you could infer a<br/>\n&gt; lot of the information, possibly, from the method name) and part about<br/>\n&gt; disambiguity.  There are other tests involving CustomerPurchaseOrders<br/>\n&gt; and Sales Order Lines that are similar.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Does using a separate test case help with the ambiguity?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Most of the time, these comments are written before the test.  I guess<br/>\n&gt; you could say I practice document-first test development.  I write a<br/>\n&gt; sentence or two about what the test is going to do (or just a method<br/>\n&gt; name if it suffices -- you&#39;re right that it often does) then I write<br/>\n&gt; the test.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I often use that technique, as well.  By writing out prose, I find <br/>\nwords that I&#39;d like to use in the test method name.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Ultimately, why wouldn&#39;t you want to write actual sentences?  I like<br/>\n&gt; Java a lot, but English was my first language.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not saying you should never write sentences.  However, if I can <br/>\nconvey the same meaning in a method name, I&#39;ll do that instead of <br/>\nmaintaining two separate pieces of information (the sentence and the <br/>\nmethod name).<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\nMike Clark<br/>\nClarkware Consulting, Inc.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clarkware.com\">http://clarkware.com</a></div>",
