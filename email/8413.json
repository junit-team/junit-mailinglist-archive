I have a number of implementations of Action (used<br/>\nto service incoming Http requests).  My action classes collaborate with a<br/>\nnumber of other classes (data access, business and so forth) and I would<br/>\nlike to unit test my Action classes.  However they really only have one<br/>\npublic method of interest - the Action.execute, and this is I believe,<br/>\ncurrently, far to complex for sensible unit testing, what I really want is<br/>\nto test some of the collaborations (parts of the whole).  <br/>\n<br/>\nObviously I can (and have) refactored Action.execute and this has resulted<br/>\nin a number of protected and private methods.  But unit testing seems be<br/>\naimed at public interface testing, which my newly refactored methods do not<br/>\ncome under this description.  I am not keen to promote these methods to<br/>\npublic visibility because they are not part of the behavioural interface.<br/>\nMy current thought (but I am not happy with this) is to do the following:<br/>\nsubclass my target testing class and provide a number of public methods that<br/>\nsimply forward to the appropriate underlying protected method(s) and<br/>\nrecording their results (to be tested by Junit asserts).  This works but<br/>\nleaves me with the overhead of having to &quot;maintain&quot; my target subclass along<br/>\nwith the rest of my application.  Things are compounded somewhat by the fact<br/>\nthat I am also having to mock a fair number of objects in order to make my<br/>\naction class as independent as possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nHas anyone else come across a similar problem and if so how did you solve<br/>\nit?  I am still a relative newbie to unit testing (and very much a newbie)<br/>\nto testing complex interactions so any help/thoughts greatly appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\nTIA<br/>\n<br/>\nJonathan</div>",
