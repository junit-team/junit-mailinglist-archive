It provides a bunch of assertions but then an arbitrary line in \n&gt;the sand has been drawn to say that these are all that anyone should need. \n&gt;This is confusing.\n\nWhat I am about to write is not a personal attack; therefore, do not take it \npersonally. It is a comment on a general attitude that I have experienced \nand, in the past, held. Please do not write letters to the editor.\n\nI used to believe, &quot;if they are going to do something, they should go all \nthe way, not just part of the way.&quot; My justification was managing \nexpectations: if they do A, B and C for me, I expect them to do X, Y and Z. \nWhen they don&#39;t, I am disappointed. Why should they do that to me?! I have \nsince changed my tune, as I find that attitude artifically limits some \npeople&#39;s tendency to add some convenience where it is needed. Some \nconvenience is almost always better than no convenience. Sometimes total \nconvenience has too high a cost.\n\nSpecifically to Chris, your assumption is that Kent and Erich were trying to \nlimit you by not including the kitchen sink. They did not. I&#39;m certain they \nonly added whatever they thought was needed at the time.\n\nI maintain, however, that further customization is likely \napplication-specific; therefore, I do not need it and I would prefer not to \nsee it in the framework. As always, some exceptions apply.\n\nJ. B.
