If that&#39;s not the case, let me know.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think I&#39;m talking about API code, because that&#39;s the context Elliotte <br/>\nis mostly coming from.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; In some systems #1 is the best answer, but those situations are rare<br/>\n&gt; and, as a strategy, it can lead to misunderstandings.. #2 and #4 are<br/>\n&gt; great strategies and I like #6 as well.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I think it&#39;s interesting to talk about #5, though. In nearly every<br/>\n&gt; other area of life, we deal with warranties and license agreements in<br/>\n&gt; which we explicitly assume responsibility for our use of products and<br/>\n&gt; services. In software we often try to protect clients from themselves<br/>\n&gt; and don&#39;t consider notice a fair grant of responsibility.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The fact is, it isn&#39;t universally true. Lots of luck having Win32 save<br/>\n&gt; you from violations of its preconditions, for instance. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, but Win32&#39;s design is broken for other reasons. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Frankly, I wouldn&#39;t want to have only #5 at the API level, but I think<br/>\n&gt; that this tendency we have to believe that we can not have an agreement<br/>\n&gt; with users that is not enforced by code leads to a great deal of<br/>\n&gt; trouble. Particularly in the area of visibility.. many developers assume<br/>\n&gt; that no written agreement can be sufficient if something is made<br/>\n&gt; public. I think that the issue is that we are not used to thinking<br/>\n&gt; about agreements beyond the code and we&#39;re not used to holding people to<br/>\n&gt; them.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; There are some exceptions. One is the Eclipse API Rules of Engagement:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.eclipse.org/articles/Article-API%20use/eclipse-api-usage-rules.html\">http://www.eclipse.org/articles/Article-API%20use/eclipse-api-usage-rules.html</a> <br/>\n&gt; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.eclipse.org/articles/Article-API%20use/eclipse-api-usage-rules.html\">http://www.eclipse.org/articles/Article-API%20use/eclipse-api-usage-rules.html</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s a contract above the code and it has some great ideas. I really<br/>\n&gt; like the idea of &quot;soft final&quot; for instance. It&#39;s like a license<br/>\n&gt; agreement.. you can do this (subclass and override, etc) and we won&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; prevent you, but if you break the rules we can&#39;t be responsible for you.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I have found in the past several years that relying on code to solve a <br/>\npeople problem is dubious at best. It might be that I now underestimate <br/>\nits effectiveness, but it seems to work better for me than <br/>\noverestimating its effectiveness, as I used to do.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
