Primarily I used it to help test drive the implementation of\n&gt; various listeners required within a couple of dialogs I was writing.  Whilst\n&gt; slowing down the unit test process (because it renders a UI and &quot;robots&quot; the\n&gt; user control) it&#39;s worked pretty well for me. \n&gt; \n&gt; Now I come to the validation process and I have received a number of bugs to\n&gt; fix (no big deal) but my question is how much should I drive my bug fixing?\n&gt; Normally (prior to abbot) I&#39;d dig about my code to locate the appropriate\n&gt; code, create a test case (or cases) to highlight the bug and drive the fix\n&gt; appropriately.  Now I have a UI fault that is easy to reproduce - and I&#39;ve\n&gt; created a test case using abbot to highlight the fault, and can now dig\n&gt; through the code and fix it... but... this fault (as with a couple of other\n&gt; UI faults) resolves down to a failing implementation of some\n&gt; DocumentListener logic. \n&gt; \n&gt; So should I (would you) keep TDD the fix via the high level UI test case, or\n&gt; drill down and write &quot;lower&quot; level test cases for the DocumentListener\n&gt; implementation.  The former helps solve the current bug, the later also\n&gt; fixes the bug but has better coverage of the listener (which could be/is\n&gt; reused)?  Or should I duplicate the test to test both the UI working\n&gt; correctly and the listener being implemented correctly?  I don&#39;t like the\n&gt; idea of duplication, and I prefer using non UI tool testing (because of the\n&gt; quicker round trip effect), but it seems that I probably do need both tests,\n&gt; or am I missing something?\n\nI don&#39;t like to write End to End tests; however, when someone returns me \na defect, I have to admit that I missed something, and to punish myself, \nI do things I don&#39;t like. I do this:\n\n1. write a failing end to end test that shows the defect\n2. test-drive the fix\n\nDo you need both tests? No. But in the long run, and as a general \npractice, you /want/ both tests.\n-- \nJ. B.
