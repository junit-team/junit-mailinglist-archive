Because many of the methodologies \n&gt; suggested for \n&gt; unit testing aren&#39;t applicable to this sort of testing.  Have \n&gt; the xUnit \n&gt; people, or anyone else for that matter, addressed this problem space?\n\n\nHi,\n\nI am currently co-writing a practitioners report submission for the XP2002\nconference about our[*] experiences with acceptance testing. We&#39;ve got a\ntesting framework that&#39;s not based on JUnit at all, and we think it&#39;s\nworking very well.\n\nWe force the application to operate in batch mode while we acceptance test\nit, provide input from file/standard input redirects, and collect all output\nas text files. We then have the full power of unix text processing commands\n(ie diff) to analyse and compare the output to previous runs. Basically, if\nthe output is different, the test fails.\n\nThe testing framework takes responsibility for version controlling input and\noutput for each test case, and running the application executable with said\ninput, and checking the output for differences (ie failures). The test cases\nrun in parallel over a network, using some third party load balancing\nsoftware.\n\nThe main advantages of this approach are that you&#39;re not writing any code to\nadd a new test case, only supplying new input data and recording a standard\nresult. Secondly the tests run in parallel instead of in series, so if the\nload on your network is low, you get results faster, and often all the\nresults in the time it takes the slowest test to run. \n\nThe disadvantages are that you have to force your app to work in batch mode\nand produce text output, which may or may not be straightforward. \n\nHope that might give you some ideas for acceptance testing.\n\nEmily\n\n[*] the XP team at Carmen Systems, which I am not actually a member of, but\nI know a lot about.\n\n",
