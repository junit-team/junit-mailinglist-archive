Rainsberger&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jbr@...\">jbr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; You probably want something similar to<br/>\n&gt; CruiseControl. If you don&#39;t know<br/>\n&gt; about it, Google it, download it and try it. It&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; not quite what you<br/>\n&gt; want, but it can be used to build and test your<br/>\n&gt; product every &#39;n&#39;<br/>\n&gt; minutes, and only if there has been CVS activity in<br/>\n&gt; the meantime.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Actually I already use CruiseControl and you are<br/>\ncorrect it is not quite what I had in mind.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe scenario I am most interested in is a single<br/>\ndeveloper working on a small section of the code on<br/>\nhis/her own machine. They want to run tests regularly,<br/>\nduring development, but why should they run the whole<br/>\nsuite every time, when they are only changing a small<br/>\nsection. The time it takes to do a test run is one of<br/>\nthe major hurdles to getting developers to run the<br/>\ntests in the first place.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis &quot;test filtering&quot; could be acheived by writing<br/>\nTestSuite classes in JUnit - but I personally think<br/>\nthis is a little clumsy, static, error prone and takes<br/>\nextra development time we just don&#39;t have. We use the<br/>\nbatchtest task from Ant for our JUnit tests - but of<br/>\ncourse it runs all of our tests every time. What we<br/>\nreally need is an extension to the batchtest task that<br/>\ncan do more complex filtering - not just by class<br/>\nnames - to decide what tests to run. I think that one<br/>\nof the most useful filters would be to only run tests<br/>\nthat relate to code the developer has changed in the<br/>\nlast 10 minutes (or some other number). There are<br/>\nprobably other ones.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, when the developer is ready to check in<br/>\ntheir code, they turn off the filters and run the<br/>\nwhole suite.<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
