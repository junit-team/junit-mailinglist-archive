These seem to be set up<br/>\naccording to 4.0 style, since they use @Test attributes and do not<br/>\ninherit from TestCase. I can run these cases using the &quot;run junit<br/>\ntest&quot; in the context menu.<br/>\nHowever, I&#39;m having problems to bundle these cases in a testsuite.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have tried to setup a testsuite using the eclipse dialog &quot;new<br/>\nJunit Test Suite&quot;, but adding my tests to the suite in the dialog<br/>\nwas impossible since the textbox where I was supposed to select<br/>\nmy tests would not be populated.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I generated an empty suite and tried to use<br/>\naddTestSuite(MyTest.class), which would not work... I guess this<br/>\nis because it is part of the 3.8 framework.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy question is hence. How am I supposed to bundle my Tests together<br/>\nin general using the 4.0 way of doing things, and how can I do that<br/>\neffectively using Eclipse?<br/>\nAm I running into an eclipse problem or do I just not understand how<br/>\nthe new framework is supposed to be used?<br/>\n<br/>\nany comments and pointers to up to date documentation would be very<br/>\nmuch appreciated!<br/>\n<br/>\nthanks!<br/>\nTimo</div>",
