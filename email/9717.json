If you adopt a convention that API methods are only presented<br/>\n&gt;via Java Interfaces instead of concrete classes then you don&#39;t care<br/>\n&gt;about the way the implementers of the Interfaces are written. You can<br/>\n&gt;then make non-API methods within the concrete implementation public<br/>\n&gt;without implying that they are themselves API methods. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I am not sure I follow, but as I can see this only works if you never plan to extend your clases, or leave them to be extended. I guess that in your case only thing visible from the outside are interfaces. If you write frameworks, it is difficult to get by without inheritance. Inheritance breaks encapsulation, keeping methods private helps encapsulate things. <br/>\nAlso, I am not shure what you mean by &quot;without implying&quot;, generally you &quot;make statement&quot; with your code, any other method yo imply something (comments, documentation etc...) is superfluous.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards,<br/>\n<br/>\nDanijel Arsenovski</div>",
