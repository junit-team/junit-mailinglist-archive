This was pretty\nstraightforward with JUnit 3.8.1 - just create new i=\r\nnstances of the\nderived TestCase with the method name as the argument, and =\r\nadd them to\nthe suite.\n\nI am having a lot of difficulty trying to replicate=\r\n this\nfunctionality. The filter logic appears to be a one-shot exclusion\nfi=\r\nlter (everything not matching is dropped), and I can&#39;t seem to find\nany doc=\r\numentation that would address this.\n\nAs Mr. Rainsberger and others have sug=\r\ngested, I have searched the web\nfor an appropriate tutorial. I have found a=\r\n number of good basic\ntutorials (including some references in this group), =\r\nand a couple with\nsome advanced content. I cannot seem to find one with the=\r\n detail to\nunlock the tools and capabilities that I am positive are availab=\r\nle\nwithin the new JUnit framework. \n\nI am also convinced that no one is as =\r\ncapable as the authors in\ndocumenting the features of the framework, and I =\r\nam having trouble\nfind Javadoc for some of the classes and APIs in the JUni=\r\nt 4.1 tree.\nThere is a fairly good chance that I am looking in the wrong pl=\r\nace.\n\nIf anyone has any suggestions or guidance on these issues, it would b=\r\ne\ngreatly appreciated.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nMichael Schechter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
