TestNG isn&#39;t just\n&gt; used for unit tests, it&#39;s used for all sorts of tests including\n&gt; long-running integration tests. TDD doesn&#39;t really apply there,\n&gt; because the window may well be several hours.\n&gt;\n&gt; Using dependencies (of some form) to prevent long-running tests from\n&gt; running when you know they will (probably) fail anyway is a good idea.\n&gt; However, it doesn&#39;t assist the developer at the point where they need\n&gt; to diagnose failure that much.\n&gt;\n&gt; This is, of course, why serious JUnit developers focus on dividing\n&gt; tests into fast and slow. :) It&#39;s also why we don&#39;t tend to see a need\n&gt; for other categories.\n&gt;   \n  By the way, continuous integration servers (such as CruiseControl) \nwould generate a nice report that include failed tests along with the \nlist of the changed sources. That may not scale well for a massive code \nchange but still provide a good help to find a starting point... or \nnarrow down list of guilty developers. :-)\n\n  regards,\n  Eugene\n\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
