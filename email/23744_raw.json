I admit I wasn&#39;t aiming at larger refacto=\r\nrings, only\nat slight changes to make Description a bit more permissive (an=\r\nd these goals\nshould be easy to achieve). I read the discussion you mention=\r\ned in your\npost. Annotation-based approach seems to add another layer of co=\r\nmplexity to\nme; whether this would be useful in practice I have no idea. In=\r\n my\nexperience all tests are somehow connected to a concrete method in some=\r\n way\n(this is true even for generative runners like the parameterized runne=\r\nr). I\ndon&#39;t have an opinion on removing getMethod/Class from Description --=\r\n can&#39;t\nsay if it&#39;s a good or bad idea, really.\n\nBtw. where does it say that=\r\n Description is serializable? :) Does it need to\nbe, really?\n\nDawid\n\n\n\n\nOn =\r\nFri, Oct 28, 2011 at 8:34 PM, David Saff &lt;david@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; **\n&gt;\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; Dawid,\n&gt;\n&gt; The design of Description has several challenges, and I welcom=\r\ne the\n&gt; chance to move towards a better solution. I think that\n&gt; getTestCla=\r\nss(), getMethodName() and getClassName() are currently\n&gt; implemented wrong:=\r\n see https://github.com/KentBeck/junit/issues/198\n&gt; for how I&#39;d rather appr=\r\noach it. In short, I&#39;d like for Description to\n&gt; remain a serializeable, fi=\r\nnal, value class, but allow for custom\n&gt; Runners to have full control over =\r\nwhat data gets put into that value\n&gt; structure. Would that work for you? If=\r\n so, want to produce a patch\n&gt; for this?\n&gt;\n&gt; Separate from this are the pro=\r\nblems that arise from Description\n&gt; containing both the test structure grap=\r\nh, and the metadata for each\n&gt; node in that graph, but that doesn&#39;t seem to=\r\n be your current\n&gt; challenge.\n&gt;\n&gt; On the subject of error messages for Assu=\r\nme.*: Oops. :-) Patches\n&gt; definitely welcome.\n&gt;\n&gt; David Saff\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; On Thu, =\r\nOct 27, 2011 at 5:05 PM, Dawid Weiss &lt;dawid.weiss@...&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; H=\r\ni everyone.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; My name is Dawid Weiss, I&#39;m a committer to Apache Lucen=\r\ne/Solr. Lucene\n&gt; &gt; and Solr use a custom runner to randomize test execution=\r\n extensively.\n&gt; &gt; This works great and I&#39;ve decided to try to pull a custom=\r\n JUnit runner\n&gt; &gt; out of Lucene so that it can be reused without relying on=\r\n the rest of\n&gt; &gt; Lucene&#39;s infrastructure. So... I wrote a custom runner and=\r\n on the way\n&gt; &gt; I came across a problem: I would really like to have a hier=\r\narchy of\n&gt; &gt; Descriptions to indicate something meaningful, in particular c=\r\nontain\n&gt; &gt; the random seed for a suite group, then for individual tests, et=\r\nc. I\n&gt; &gt; believe a similar situation could also be useful for\n&gt; &gt; Parameter=\r\nizedRunner...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Unfortunately, the problem is that Description is sea=\r\nled and does not\n&gt; &gt; allow much in terms of flexibility (the constructor is=\r\n private, static\n&gt; &gt; factory methods).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The design of this class lea=\r\nds me to believe that Description should\n&gt; &gt; be a contract (interface or a =\r\nclass, but with the possibility of\n&gt; &gt; subclassing) so that getDisplayName(=\r\n) returns something meaningful (as\n&gt; &gt; in the example above), but getTestCl=\r\nass(), getMethodName() and\n&gt; &gt; getClassName() can still point IDEs and repo=\r\nrt writers to the right\n&gt; &gt; place. Or at least allow a custom display name =\r\nnot related to the\n&gt; &gt; method name/ class of the test case?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Another=\r\n burning issue we have in Lucene is that Assume.* methods don&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; take an=\r\ny explanation message. Why is this so? I mean: an assumption\n&gt; &gt; can fail, =\r\nbut just like with failures it&#39;d be nice to be actually able\n&gt; &gt; to explain=\r\n why a given assumption wasn&#39;t met...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Let me know what you think. I=\r\n can provide a patch (several ones :),\n&gt; &gt; but I wanted to hear what people=\r\n think first.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Dawid\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; -----------------------------------=\r\n-\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
