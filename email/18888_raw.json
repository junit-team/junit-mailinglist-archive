I&#39;d be leery of a class that generates HTML and sorts. If the\n&gt;&gt;sort is an another class, it can be public and far easier to test.\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;I&#39;ve always wondered why most developers are highly offended by making  \n&gt;things more public for purposes of testing, yet they have no problem  \n&gt;consistently and willingly violating cohesion. I suspect that it&#39;s the  \n&gt;same reason most developers worry about performance more than good  \n&gt;design: it&#39;s easier to quantify.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nI think that lack of protection is just easier to see.  Lack of cohesion \nrequires trained eyes.  I have to admit that every time I teach the \n&#39;Single Responsibility Principle&#39; I feel a little odd.  It&#39;s not like \nyou can use a check list which tells you whether you&#39;re violating it or \nnot, you just have to show people enough examples for them to &#39;get it.&#39;\n\nIt reminds me of the Supreme Court of the US.  There was a time when \nobscenity cases were all the rage.  Producers of movies, pictures, and \nstories were prosecuted all the way up to the Supreme Court on obscenity \ngrounds, and the Court was unable to articulate a definition of \nobscenity which drew a line between pornography and free speech.  Some \nSaturdays the Justices would get together to view the films in evidence \nand make their decision.  Justice Potter Stewart said (paraphrasing) &quot;I \nmay not be able to define obscenity, but I know it when I see it.&quot;\n\n\nMichael Feathers\nwww.objectmentor.com\n\n\n",
