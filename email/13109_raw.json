The root\ndirectory for the JUnit installation is C:&#92;Program Files&#92;junit3.8.1.\nI&#39;ve created an environment variable called JUNIT_HOME which has this\npath as its value, I&#39;ve added this variable to the CLASSPATH variable,\nand I&#39;ve added %JUNIT_HOME%&#92;junit.jar to the CLASSPATH as well. I\nhaven&#39;t moved junit.jar anywhere, and using the text-based or\nAWT-based test runners makes no difference; I still get the error.\nEven if I run the command from C:&#92;Program\nFiles&#92;junit3.8.1&#92;junit&#92;tests&#92;runner, where I can see\nLoadedFromJar.class for myself, I get the same error, and the current\ndirectory (.) is part of my CLASSPATH system variable. Can anyone tell\nme what is causing this error?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                             \n                    Yahoo!
