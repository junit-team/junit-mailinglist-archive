Or are we really only interested in the result<br/>\n&gt; of the main method we&#39;re testing?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I believe you should forget mocks for now and just write tests. Write <br/>\nfat, slow, brittle tests that, nonetheless, pass and drive your design <br/>\nincrementally. I did that when I first used JUnit and I can&#39;t imagine <br/>\ntrying to learn writing tests, driving design and using mocks all at the <br/>\nsame time!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy first real test suite had 175 tests and took 12 minutes to run, but <br/>\nit enabled me to do in 3 weeks what I&#39;d previously needed 3 months to <br/>\ndo. The fact that I could /now/ do it in 1 week with my vastly-improved <br/>\ntechnique was irrelevant then.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
