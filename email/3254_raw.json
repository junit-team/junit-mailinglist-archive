I don&#39;t need to really experience it to be convinced\nthough.=\r\n  What I wanted to hear was that someone has received UTs for a\ncodebase fo=\r\nr which they had only class files and were able to gain\nanything from them =\r\n(besides how to reverse engineer them :).  It sounds\nlike you and Eric Voug=\r\nht both have.\n\nI think that&#39;s wonderful.

These are all \n=\r\n&gt;assumptions (good ones, most likely).  Has anyone had real-world \n&gt;experie=\r\nnce with this?  I am not trying to be a skeptic just for \n&gt;skepticism&#39;s sak=\r\ne.  I want to be convinced. \nYes, I have had real-world experiences that co=\r\nnvinced me of the value of\nunit tests for documentation. It sounds like the=\r\n only way for you to be\nconvinced is for you to also have similar real-worl=\r\nd experiences.\n1. Unit tests can be run on MY machine, revealing undocument=\r\ned problems\n(&quot;oh yes, you need NT 4 patch-level 5 for this, patch-level 4 i=\r\ns missing\nthe blah blah DLL.&quot;) Much nicer to find this out by running the s=\r\nupplied\ntests, rather than code away and then wonder why your code isn&#39;t\nwo=\r\nrking.\n2. Unit tests sources are examples of how the code-under-test is\nexp=\r\nected to be used.  I&#39;ve been burned too often by Documentation that\nis out =\r\nof date or inaccurate or incomplete. Very often, the\ndocumentation doesn&#39;t =\r\nhave full examples of calling every public API.\nExecutable unit tests HAVE =\r\nto be up to date.... or reveal that the\nvendor is not running its own unit =\r\ntests.\n3. Unit test sources can also be examples of how the code-under-test=\r\n\nbehaves in failure situations. &quot;hmm... this test shows that the file it\nop=\r\nens has to have write-access. That&#39;s why my code, which is trying to\nopen a=\r\n file on a CD-ROM, is failing.&quot; MUCH nicer to have a supplied unit\ntest\n4. =\r\nPoor unit tests are better than no unit tests at all. \nThe Booch Components=\r\n (C++) were a really good class framework available\nin the early days of C+=\r\n+ that came with sources (of necessity, since\nthey were template classes) a=\r\nnd with unit tests. The unit tests gave you\nconfidence that whatever C++ co=\r\nmpiler you were using was able to\nproperly compile and run the Booch compon=\r\nents. Rogue Wave bought and\nburied the Booch Components, so you can&#39;t get t=\r\nhem any more. They were a\nlot nicer than STL, IMO.\nToday, getting jar files=\r\n (with no sources) from third-parties, it is\nVERY nice to have unit tests w=\r\nhich will demonstrate to me that MY Java\nenvironments (MacOS 9 and X, Windo=\r\nws, JDK 1.1.8, JDK 1.3.1, CodeWarrior,\nVisualCafe, etc.) can run those the =\r\nin those jars. Often, undocumented\ndependencies on JDK 1.3.1 show up, or as=\r\nsumptions were made about the\noperating system that would be revealed when =\r\nrunning on MacOS 9.\n\nYahoo!
