Using assert statements would be a compromise.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I think I could use assert statements at the beginning of a method <br/>\n&gt; and at the end, checking preconditions and postconditions.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Violating pre- and postconditions is just a small subset of what can go<br/>\nwrong in your code. Unit tests often test the interplay of two or three<br/>\nmethods, or even of several objects. You can&#39;t do this (effectively)<br/>\nwith embedded assertions.<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; By marking them somehow as preconditions and postconditions it should <br/>\n&gt; theoretically be possible to automate generation of JUnit <br/>\n&gt; tests/suites, including test data. The test data can be created <br/>\n&gt; automatically by a tool which obeys the preconditions for that <br/>\n&gt; purpose. Java Modelling Language seems to do exactly this.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Do you have a pointer?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It seems that with JUnit I can only test methods which return a <br/>\n&gt; value.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s wrong, as others already stated.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Using JUnit will change the code one would normally create: <br/>\n&gt; Because of JUnit you need to overwrite equals(), toString() and are <br/>\n&gt; not allowed to use void return type if you want to test that method.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The latter is simply wrong, the former is typically a good thing -<br/>\n(unit-)testable code is decoupled code.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Besides all this problems whis JUnit is another one: Successful <br/>\n&gt; JUnits tests are no guarantee that there are no bugs in the code I <br/>\n&gt; read. This has to do with data chains. But I didn&#39;t understand this.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Asserts are even less a guarantee. Asserts need to be executed to be<br/>\neffective - if you don&#39;t have external code invoking them in a well<br/>\ndirected manner, they will not be of any use until in the production<br/>\nenvironment.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; And I read that it is extremely time consuming to create test cases <br/>\n&gt; for all possible cases.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Most people experience that it is less time consuming to create test<br/>\ncases for the reasonable cases than to have to debug the code later on.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The good thing about using assert statements would also be, that the <br/>\n&gt; test is included in the method. So no extra coding of classes would <br/>\n&gt; be requiered as with using JUnit. Everything is in one place, user <br/>\n&gt; friendly.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If you really prefer this way, it wouldn&#39;t be too hard to include the<br/>\nunit tests into your production code. Most people seem to prefer to<br/>\nseperate the two.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Using assert statements will not force the developer to use a special <br/>\n&gt; developing practice like testdriven development. He is free to <br/>\n&gt; develop in his own style.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Junit doesn&#39;t force you to develop test-driven at all.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The synchronisation between test cases and methods to be tested would <br/>\n&gt; is time consuming.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You might fear that it is. In practice, it doesn&#39;t seem to be that way.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; And what happens if you change a method so that <br/>\n&gt; preconditions or postconditions will become different? Will you <br/>\n&gt; remember to change the JUnit to fit these changes? Or will you <br/>\n&gt; sometimes forget? Error detecting is then twice as hard, since it can <br/>\n&gt; originate in the test class or in the class to be tested. Thats a <br/>\n&gt; point where assert statements are better in my eyes compared to JUnit.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>With Junit, you can (and probably should) run the tests every couple of<br/>\nminutes. There are even tools to automate this. My IDE shows me wether I<br/>\nrun the tests since the last code change, and an integration server<br/>\nemails me if I broke a test nevertheless.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t know how to do that with embedded asserts. It seems to me<br/>\nthat they make it much more likely to detecht an error not until late in<br/>\ndevelopment.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, did that help?<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards, Ilja</div>",
