Determine whether Extract Class should be used to split the\n&gt; &gt; responsibilities of the class into two or more abstractions. If\n&gt; &gt; so, refactor and write unit tests for the public methods of the\n&gt; &gt; new classes. Return to step 1.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t see this as a solution. If the method wasn&#39;t public before,\n&gt; it shouldn&#39;t be public now just because it moved to a different\n&gt; class.If the only reason it becomes public is because it moved to a\n&gt; different class, it would be better off as the original private\n&gt; method inside the one class. Public API should be kept to a minimum,\n&gt; especially if you expect anybody to use your API. If the API is\n&gt; purely for your app&#39;s own internal use, then this constraint can be\n&gt; relaxed a little, but you should still strive for the minimum\n&gt; exposure of class internals. This is one of the first principles of\n&gt; object oriented design, and test driven development doesn&#39;t really\n&gt; change it to any significant extent.\n&gt; \n\nElliotte,\n\nI agree that privates should be kept private, encapsulation should not\nbe broken for the purpose of testing, and that the number of messages\nin the protocol of a class should be minimized. I also agree that it\nwould be wrong to haphazardly create a new class and move a method\nthere /just/ so that the method could be public for testing.\n\nAs I stated in a previous post, my classes tend to have a lot of\nprivate methods because I refactor aggressively and try to keep\nmethods to only a few lines at the same level of abstraction. I don&#39;t\nfeel a need to test those private methods separately because I know\nwhy they are there and that the code is already being tested through\nthe public API. \n\nFirst please remember that this list was not intended as solutions to\nhaving private methods but as ideas about what alternatives might be\nconsidered prior to simply making a method public so that it can be\ntested. Sometimes -- perhaps not often -- there is a second\nabstraction hiding within the class. My suggestion was merely to\nconsider that as a possibility. It was low on the list; perhaps it\nshould be lower ...\n\nRegards,\nJim\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
