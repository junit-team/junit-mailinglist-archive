However, I am pretty sure that you can do it through java.lang.Runtime yourself.  You&#39;ll need two<br/>\nclasses.  The first class create one run time instance for each test and passing the name of the test as parameter, the second class can have a<br/>\nmain method that will call different test method depending on the different parameters passed in.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn this way, you have a main process that spawns different testing processes.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nDisclaimer:  I join all the news groups out of my own interest.

Each test will start the<br/>\n&gt; application, login, and test a specific piece of functionality. At the start<br/>\n&gt; of each test I call the application&#39;s main() method, and at the end I call<br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s shutdown() method. The application was not designed such that main() can<br/>\n&gt; be called multiple times. Doing so leads to duplicate daemon threads, and<br/>\n&gt; painfull initialization problems. Also, each test needs to start with an<br/>\n&gt; initialized data base.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
