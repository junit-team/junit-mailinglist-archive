To have the rule working in several tests=\r\n, you have to place the Rule in each test.\n&gt;\n&gt; However, I am searching for =\r\na way to activate a Rule for all the tests that are executed, without needi=\r\nng to add the rule to each test. Perhaps by specifying a Java property para=\r\nmeter when running the tests (I could also set this as a global Java option=\r\n, therefore being used upon each execution of the JVM).\n&gt;\n&gt; Do you know if =\r\nthis is possible?\n&gt;\n&gt; The reason why I need this, is: I am making the plans=\r\n and gathering the ideas for creating a simple Swing application that will =\r\ndisplay the results of the executed tests (just like the JUnit view in Ecli=\r\npse/Idea/Netbeans, but perhaps with more details, and also available for an=\r\nyone, not just IDE users). Currently I developed a small agent rule, that y=\r\nou can place in your test, and it will report to the console the status of =\r\nyour tests (the Swing console runs remotely).\n&gt;\n&gt; This is ok, but it means =\r\nthat you will have to add this rule to each and every test that you have. I=\r\nt also means that will not be an easy task to disable this rule, if you don=\r\n&#39;t want it anymore.\n&gt;\n&gt; Therefore a possibility to enable Rules globally fo=\r\nr all tests I think is the best solution for my case, and also a good tool =\r\nto have for various other tasks.\n&gt;\n&gt; What do you think? Also, what do you t=\r\nhink about the Swing console idea?\n&gt;\n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; Bogdan\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; -----------=\r\n-------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
