There is a Graph <br/>\ninterface, and several Graph implementations (one [actually three, <br/>\nbut two aren&#39;t part of the public interface) in memory, one in an RDB, <br/>\none in BDB JE). Each one should satisfy the Graph tests. So, following<br/>\nthe model suggested elsewhere, we have an abstract base class with the <br/>\ntests in, with a method getGraph() which supplies the Graph to test, <br/>\nand subclasses of the abstract class which override getGraph() to<br/>\ndeliver an appropriate implementation. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt works pretty well.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe subclasses can also have specialised tests. EG, a Graph is a set<br/>\nof (S, P, O) triples. There&#39;s a generalised find(S, P, O) operation,<br/>\nwhere S/P/O can be wildcards. Memory graphs have indexes which allow<br/>\nqueries to be directed to an index rather than doing a general search.<br/>\nA specialised test for GraphMem ensures that the special-cased queries<br/>\ndon&#39;t use the default implementation of find(). <br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nChris &quot;electric hedgehog&quot; Dollin<br/>\n&quot;The compiler is free to insert padding because it makes the struct <br/>\nlook bigger and scares away predators.&quot; [Keith Thompson, comp.lang.c]</div>",
