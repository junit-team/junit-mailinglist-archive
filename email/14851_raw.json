One of the key points of having a testName in the\n&gt; Parameterized Test Case pattern is to solve this very problem, but\n&gt; giving each row of input/expected output data a name. I imagine adding a\n&gt; name is not that hard.\n&gt;\n&gt; @Parameters data = new Object[][] { {&quot;testZero&quot;, 0, 5}, ... }\n&gt;\n&gt; I don&#39;t know about autoboxing works in Java, so that might be wrong.\n\nAutoboxing seems to have no troubles with this:\n\n@Parameters Object[][] data = { {&quot;testZero&quot;, 0, 0}, {&quot;testOne&quot;, 1, 1} };\n\nWhat do y&#39;all think about the extra name parameter?  Should it be required?\n\n    David Saff\n\n\nSPONSORED LINKS Basic programming language C programming language Computer programming languages \nThe c programming language C programming language List of programming languages \n\n\n\nYAHOO!
