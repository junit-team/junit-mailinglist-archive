For us, they are also relatively rare circumstances, and<br/>\nthat makes us wary of spending too much effort on this testing.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt; NEXT WEEK, I think I&#39;m goint go write a simple html parsing tool,<br/>\n &gt; that writes the java test code for me, so I can cut and paste it<br/>\n &gt; into my code, and adapt it.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m really hoping someone has done this already and we can buy or<br/>\ndownload this tool!<br/>\n<br/>\nOur QA manager was telling me today that she can record Silk Test<br/>\nscripts in &quot;no time,&quot; and then we have the web tests available.  If<br/>\nthey are being recorded, then we don&#39;t have the test-first thing<br/>\ngoing on, but she said they could at least script the manual test<br/>\nprior to the iteration so we can use it to develop against.  Like<br/>\nany web tests, especially with JSPs that have to be generated by the<br/>\nserver, they take a bit too much time to run to be used as part of<br/>\nthe developers check-in routine.  We probably want to run these as<br/>\npart of a daily or twice daily automated build verification test.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your comments,<br/>\n-Paul Hodgetts</div>",
