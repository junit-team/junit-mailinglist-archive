After \n&gt; &gt;searching thru documentation, this news group and other sources, \nsome \n&gt; &gt;issues still remain that I hope some of you can help answer.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;    1. We have a need to put some trace messages in the tests so \nas \n&gt; &gt;to know the progress of the test itself because each test can be \n&gt; &gt;fairly timeconsuming. Is there a way to have these capture this \n&gt; &gt;output for an individual test in the GUI-based TestRunner? I see \nonly \n&gt; &gt;thing that is captured for each test on the UI are the assertion \n&gt; &gt;failures. \n&gt; \n&gt; My guess is that if TestListener doesn&#39;t have something to allow \nyou to\n&gt; log progress messages, then you can easily add something to it.\n\n\n\nI like your suggestion of adding to the TestListener. I am interested \nin implementing this. But for this would I have to touch the JUnit \nTestRunner source or do you think I can do it externally?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;    2. I see that JUnitReport is used quite extensively with Ant. \n&gt; &gt;&gt;From what I learnt reading, it helps output TestResult in XML \nformat \n&gt; &gt;and then one can translate it using XSLT. Know how one can use \nthat \n&gt; &gt;without having to use Ant? Any resources on Net would be helpful.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hm. Your best bet is to look at the source of the JUnitReport task \nand\n&gt; you should be able to tell, from that, how to use it outside Ant.\n&gt; \n\n\nOk! I will go and find the source for JUnitReport task and have a \nlook at it.\n\n\n\n&gt; &gt;   3. I see JUnit is great for nesting sub-suites within a suite \nand \n&gt; &gt;thereby creating a tree of suites. But when it comes to test \nresults, \n&gt; &gt;is there a way to get a breakup of which sub-suite had how many \n&gt; &gt;failures from TestResult?\n&gt; \n&gt; If you want to map a TestSuite object to the collection of\n&gt; Failures/Errors generated by its tests, then your best bet is \nlikely to\n&gt; register an extra TestListener, which you can do by changing the\n&gt; TestRunner you usually use.\n&gt; \n\n\nI have not played with the TestListener. So I will need to try it out.\nBut this suggestion would require TestRunner to be modified?\n\n\n\nThanks for your time,\nVern\n\n\n\n\n\n",
