Then seek the power of Ant.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve only got one chance to start off with good practices, and<br/>\nI&#39;d better get it right. But others have pointed me toward tools<br/>\nfor doing this. <br/>\n * <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tinyurl.com/2uyb\">http://tinyurl.com/2uyb</a><br/>\n * some code from Craig Pardley<br/>\n * use of ant (but I tried this and couldn&#39;t make it work)<br/>\n<br/>\n            . . .<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;QUESTION 3:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   How do I &quot;turn on&quot; my mock objects when tests are running?<br/>\n&gt; When faced with testing a constellation of objects that can&#39;t easily be <br/>\n&gt; &quot;installed&quot; with a mock object directly, I try to find ways to do so. <br/>\n&gt;  Sometimes it turns out those objects can be composed in a different <br/>\n&gt; order like Russian dolls.  If that doesn&#39;t turn up anything, I&#39;ll resort <br/>\n&gt; to building a factory that plugs in implementations based on a dynamic <br/>\n&gt; property.  I can count the number of times I&#39;ve done that on one finger.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Interesting. It seems to me like it&#39;d be a much more common<br/>\nsolution than that. I&#39;ll go back and look at my designs again<br/>\nand see if I can come up with a different approach that avoids<br/>\nthe need for the &quot;dynamic property&quot;. Perhaps I&#39;m missing a<br/>\ngood solution.<br/>\n<br/>\n            . . .<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; As you encounter specific issues not addressed in the FAQ, let us know. <br/>\n&gt;  We&#39;ll make it better.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, I have one suggestion. In response to my question about <br/>\nwhere to place the tests, nearly everybody responded that a <br/>\nseparate source hierarchy was the best place (5 of 6 responders,<br/>\nand the 6th proposed a new solution and said separate hierarchy<br/>\nwas his second choice). I think that&#39;s sufficient agreement to<br/>\nmake this an acknowledged &quot;best practice&quot;, and if you agree and<br/>\nwould like to add it to the FAQ, I&#39;ll volunteer to write up an<br/>\nitem on it. Let me know.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Michael Chermside</div>",
