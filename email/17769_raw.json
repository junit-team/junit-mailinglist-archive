We may find ourselves performing \n&gt; checks at the edge of a system, say at the client interfaces, but I \n&gt; don&#39;t find much value in precondition checking inside application code.  \n&gt; I prefer to write my code so that usage is obvious and documented with \n&gt; test cases.\n&gt; \n\nThe boundary I would pick is the public API. If a method is public (or \nprotected) then there&#39;s really nothing you can do about who calls it and \nnothing you can assume about what they will pass beyond the types of the \narguments. Internal classes not meant for public consumption need not \nrigorously verify each precondition if substantial testing demonstrates \ntheir correctness *provided* that they are not public. If they are \npublic, all bets are off.\n\nFar too much code in Java is made public without adequate foresight. \nAgain this is partially a defect of the language since packages are \neffectively private to each other. Following this principle usually \nmeans you restrict yourself to a single package. It would be nice if \nJava had a little more flexibility here, and we may indeed get that in \nJava 7. Until then, though, non-verified classes should be non-public \nand usually all in a single package.\n\n-- \n﻿Elliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nJava I/O 2nd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeaulait.org/books/javaio2/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596527500/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/\n\n",
