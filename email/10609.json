For example, for &#39;A&#39; you don&#39;t even<br/>\nneed to issue the query. Just write tests that verify the SQL. Mock<br/>\nobjects help here.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor &#39;B&#39; and &#39;C&#39; You might also try using a database that has a small,<br/>\nknown subset of data in it so you don&#39;t need to process as much, or use<br/>\na mock database.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn #2 again, it appears that the primary concern of the tests may be<br/>\nvalidating the SQL that is generated and not what is returned by the<br/>\ncall, but I could be wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----------------------------<br/>\nMike Silverstein<br/>\nSilverMark, Inc.<br/>\nThe Object Testing Company<br/>\nwww.silvermark.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: mirumoto_kojiro [mailto:mirumoto_kojiro@...] <br/>\n&gt; Sent: Saturday, March 06, 2004 8:54 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com<br/>\n&gt; Subject: [junit] Test case strategy for complex tests<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m writing test cases for EJB&#39;s and some of the beans do <br/>\n&gt; some complex SQL <br/>\n&gt; generation and return large amounts of data,  Realizing that <br/>\n&gt; test cases should be <br/>\n&gt; simple... Should I just test that the query runs without <br/>\n&gt; error and not worry about the <br/>\n&gt; return?  Or should I check certain parts to make sure thay <br/>\n&gt; are right?  Or check the <br/>\n&gt; entire result set?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Question#2: I have many SQL queries with multiple <br/>\n&gt; possiblities in the WHERE clause.  <br/>\n&gt; They are being built on the fly based on the search criteria <br/>\n&gt; given by a user.  I was <br/>\n&gt; going to test each WHERE clause in a seperate test. Should I <br/>\n&gt; write the tests in such a <br/>\n&gt; way that I could combine calls to them and have a test case <br/>\n&gt; that is more of a <br/>\n&gt; controller pattern?<br/>\n&gt; pseudo code as follows<br/>\n&gt; &lt;code&gt;<br/>\n&gt; public void combinedTest1(){<br/>\n&gt;      SearchVO search = buildSearchVO ( add two parameters);<br/>\n&gt;      <br/>\n&gt;      performSearchTest(search);<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;      search = buildSearchVO(two other parameters);<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;       performSearchTest(search);<br/>\n&gt; }&lt;/code&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>---<br/>\nOutgoing mail is certified Virus Free.<br/>\nChecked by AVG anti-virus system (http://www.grisoft.com).<br/>\nVersion: 6.0.576 / Virus Database: 365 - Release Date: 1/30/2004</div>",
