Is there any way to calculate\n&gt;    the MaxElapsedTime .\n&gt; \n\nJUnitPerf requires that you know the performance criteria for a section \nof code under test.  This should be based on quantifiable performance \nrequirements, user tolerances, or an arbitrary measurable improvement \nover the existing response times and throughput.  If performance isn&#39;t \nimportant for a certain section of code, then don&#39;t write a performance \ntest for it.  If it is important, then you should have some expected \nresponse time to use as a benchmark.\n\n\n&gt;   Your Program :-\n&gt;   ------------------\n&gt;   Timer timer = new ConstantTimer(250);\n&gt;   int maxUsers = 100;\n&gt;   int iterations = 10;\n&gt;   long maxElapsedTime = 12000;\n&gt; \n&gt;  The overall test duration  is not to exceed 12 seconds.\n&gt;  How u are predicting this maxElapsedTime for the real\n&gt;  time project on unix based platforms .\n&gt;\n\nThe code you refer to is a sample load test case and 12 seconds was \nmerely an example.\n\n \n&gt;    2)  LoadTest\n&gt;     -------------\n&gt; \n&gt;         Please have a look on result.xml which  i have attached .I\nhave\n&gt; redirected the output\n&gt;         of junit to xml file .My question is\n&gt;         1) For the first time ,it takes 0.12 sec .Later than it takes\n&gt; only 0.5,0.6 ,0.15 ,0 etc\n&gt;         Is there any valid comments to &quot;why time goes like this &quot; .\n&gt;         2) For some times ,it shows no time .I dont know the reason .\n&gt; \n\nThe result.xml doesn&#39;t include the stated numbers, but I suspect the \nnumbers are varying based on the load and optimizations of your HTTP\nserver.\n\nMike\n\n\n",
