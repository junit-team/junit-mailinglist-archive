I think such an approach would always<br/>\nbe secondary to regular TDD - at least in my own work - but it could be<br/>\nuseful.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is something like the effect one gets already from &quot;surprising&quot;<br/>\ncombinations<br/>\nof Datapoints using Theories and it&#39;s easy to imagine a program that<br/>\ngenerated<br/>\nadditional &quot;surprises.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nCharlie<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Fri, May 13, 2011 at 11:30 PM, Esko Luontola &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:esko.luontola@...\">esko.luontola@...</a>&gt;wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Kalyan Kundu wrote on 13.5.2011 11:07:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; First of all I know to know if<br/>\n&gt; &gt; there is any automated testcase generator for jUnit(both 3 and 4)?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; There is at least this one:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.agitar.com/solutions/products/automated_junit_generation.html\">http://www.agitar.com/solutions/products/automated_junit_generation.html</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Personally I wouldn&#39;t use any test generation, because a human is needed<br/>\n&gt; to write tests which communicate well the intent of the behaviour being<br/>\n&gt; specified by the code [1]. Neither could it be used to drive the design<br/>\n&gt; of the production code.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Also I have my doubts that how useful such tools would be in dealing<br/>\n&gt; with legacy code [2], when the code to be tested has non-trivial<br/>\n&gt; dependencies. If the class is easy enough to cover with tests, that even<br/>\n&gt; a program can do it, it would be easy for a human to write the same<br/>\n&gt; tests. It would be a bit slower, but at the same time his understanding<br/>\n&gt; of the code would increase and he would be able to write more meaningful<br/>\n&gt; tests.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Generating the production code based on the tests would be more<br/>\n&gt; interesting...
