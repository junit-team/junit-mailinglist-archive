Perhaps a humble<br/>\n&gt; &gt; library writer might look for ways to have that answer not always be<br/>\n&gt; &quot;No&quot;?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If you&#39;re unsure of what to do when writing a library, it&#39;s better to do<br/>\n&gt; nothing. When in doubt, leave it out. You can always put it in again<br/>\n&gt; later,<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Maybe, but how many people will already have been discouraged from using<br/>\nyour library just because you didn&#39;t give them enough hooks?<br/>\n<br/>\nThis has happened to me *many* times, both as a library author and as a<br/>\nlibrary user.  And more often than not, I have sworn after the author of a<br/>\nlibrary because they made a method private instead of protected (worst<br/>\noffender:  MIDP1, where you don&#39;t even have the option of changing the<br/>\ncode).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDo as little as you can get away with. This principle makes both the library<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; developers&#39; and the users&#39;<br/>\n&gt; lives easier. Options are not free.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>We&#39;ll just agree to disagree.  I, for one, am quite happy to see that JUnit4<br/>\nwill come with  a reasonable amount of protected methods &quot;for future<br/>\nexperimentations&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not as if the library is fixed in stone and nothing can ever be<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; added to it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Actually, most of the time, it is.  I mentioned MIDP1 above, but even if you<br/>\nare thinking of open-source libraries, modifying the source means forking<br/>\nthe code most of the time, with all the maintenance nightmare that ensue.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone thinks of something you hadn&#39;t thought of, add<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; it. But don&#39;t add just because you think someone  somewhere someday<br/>\n&gt; might perhaps need it, even though you can&#39;t quite see how.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You seem to be living in a world where every author of any imaginable<br/>\nlibrary is magically available and willing to make the changes you need when<br/>\nyou ask for them right away.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy experience is the complete opposite of that.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nCédric<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
