Starting <br/>\n&gt; and shutting the platform and is very expensive.  It&#39;s on the order of <br/>\n&gt; a minute or two to start the platform.  Before I run my unit tests, I <br/>\n&gt; want to start the platform and when they are all done, I want to shut <br/>\n&gt; it down.  This is easy to do if I only have one test method in my test <br/>\n&gt; case.  I can just put the startup code in the setup method and the <br/>\n&gt; shutdown code in the tear down.  Unfortnately, if I have more than one <br/>\n&gt; method in the test case this happens before and after each method.  If <br/>\n&gt; I have 10 test methods, the unit test could take 20 minutes instead of <br/>\n&gt; just 3 minutes.  Is there a way to start the platform, run all of the <br/>\n&gt; tests in the TestCase, and then shut down the platform?  Thanks.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Jay<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
