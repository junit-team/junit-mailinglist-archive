Extract a method that reveals intent. Vladimir<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; already did it, so let&#39;s use it.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Yes, but you may not want to install a whole library for one method. :)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; If that&#39;s all you want out of it, why use it.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Today, you use one method. Tomorrow, you find out he has all this cool <br/>\n&gt; stuff and you start using more. If you never grab it, you&#39;ll never know, <br/>\n&gt; and you&#39;ll never learn.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Not true.  Use is not the only tool for knowing or learning. <br/>\nCommunication is another one.  And since Vladimir&#39;s library, for<br/>\nexample, is talked about so much on this list others will get the hint<br/>\nand take a look at it.  Word-of-mouth is generally a key motivator. <br/>\nFWIW: I have Vlad&#39;s library in use in more than 3 projects currently.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Make your own testcase<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that has that method in it, descend from that, and call it a day.  The<br/>\n&gt; &gt; method reveals intent and you don&#39;t have more classes hanging around<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that you don&#39;t use.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; That&#39;s another way to do it, sure.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Granted, Vladimir&#39;s library isn&#39;t that large, but<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it is another library to have to be concerned about when it comes to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; versioning, updating, build time, etc.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Agreed. That is a consideration. Still, why succumb to NIH syndrome?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Because we don&#39;t all live and work in a culture where we are free to<br/>\nchange everything.  We keep squeaking and perhaps we&#39;ll get some oil, or<br/>\nperhaps &quot;The Company&quot; will buy a new tire, at which point you just start<br/>\nall over again.  It&#39;s a wonderful cycle, actually, it drives out the<br/>\nboredom. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJason Rogers<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Where there is no vision, the people perish...&quot;<br/>\nBible, Proverbs 29:18</div>",
