I<br/>\ndeveloped some code from scratch the other day, and it<br/>\nfinally clicked for me since I&#39;ve been mulling these<br/>\nideas (Fixtures vs method/class testing)around in my<br/>\nhead as well.  <br/>\n  Having one .java for each general use case did make<br/>\nthe tests very well organized, I could look at my<br/>\nTestCase names and know immediately what functionality<br/>\nmy little utility had in general, and when I opened up<br/>\nthat file and looked at some of the individual test<br/>\nmethods I could see more detail.<br/>\n  That said, I don&#39;t think method/class testing is<br/>\nabsolutely horrible, definitely better to start there<br/>\nrather than not starting at all, and I&#39;ve gotten a lot<br/>\nof mileage from those type of tests in the past.<br/>\n   I guess the TestFixture approach helps you decouple<br/>\nthe tests from the implementation details a little<br/>\nmore, making them more &quot;black box&quot;, instead of leading<br/>\nyou testing every single method, even ones that<br/>\nprobably ought to be private.  (Though I sometimes<br/>\nlike the fact that some of the trickier would-be<br/>\nprivate methods have been completely covered by some<br/>\ngood tests, and am not as comfortable that I&#39;ve<br/>\ncovered all my bases if I simply test the<br/>\nnot-so-tricky higher level public APIs).<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my random thoughts on the subject<br/>\n- Jeff Tulley <br/>\n--------<br/>\nEric Armstrong  wrote:<br/>\nMessage: 13<br/>\n   Date: Tue, 28 Jan 2003 21:54:48 -0800<br/>\n   From: Eric Armstrong &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eric.armstrong@...\">eric.armstrong@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: Re: Re: Test first? or Stub first?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  So said  Curt Sampson  on  2003-01-24<br/>\n </span></blockquote>--------------------<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;...I find my test cases often don&#39;t parallel the<br/>\n </span></blockquote>particular &gt;methods<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; of a class.

In essence, test<br/>\nconstruction<br/>\nshould<br/>\nfollow definition of use cases? Or words to that<br/>\neffect?<br/>\n<br/>\nI confess that although I&#39;m &quot;infected&quot;, I&#39;m having a<br/>\nhard time actually<br/>\ngenerating<br/>\ntests for anything other than individual functions.<br/>\nThat has been<br/>\nhelpful all by<br/>\nitself, but I&#39;ve got to get better at imagining<br/>\nfixtures and hanging<br/>\ntests off of them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI read TDD by Example, and enjoyed, but somehow I&#39;m<br/>\nstill missing that<br/>\nflash<br/>\nof insight that tells how to write the test first.<br/>\n(Too many years<br/>\nsitting in the<br/>\nsaddle backwards, I suspect.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIs thinking about &quot;use cases&quot; a profitable approach?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
