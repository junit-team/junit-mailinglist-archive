The tool can tell you which code gets called \nby the test suite (and which doesn&#39;t).  It can also tell you which \ntest calls each piece of code and a little bit about the stack at \nthat point.  This would help you determine code coverage.\n\nThe AFT tool is not available for download yet (I&#39;m planning on \nfinihsing my thesis first), but I would be happy to make it \navailable and help you use it if you wanted to use the tool on your \nsystem.  \n\n\ngood luck,\n--andrew\n\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, Chad Woolley &lt;lists@t...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Vladimir Ritz Bossicard wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; murukeshcts wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; hai all,\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;   Is there any tool available..that i can integrated with \nWSAD so that\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; i can check for the code coverage of the JUnitcode which  a \nperson\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; writes in his project.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; I don&#39;t know about WSAD integration, but there are several \ntest coverage \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; tools out there, including Clover and Jester. They are easily \nintegrated \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; with Ant.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; jcoverage &lt;http://www.jcoverage.com&gt; works nicely too\n&gt; \n&gt; Hansel is also good, and it works in Eclipse, so should also work \nfine in WSAD. \n&gt;   Hansel is nice within the IDE because it gives you immediate \nfeedback when \n&gt; running the test, and you can click on the error line in the \nintegrated JUnit \n&gt; runner and go directly to the uncovered code.\n&gt; \n&gt; -- Chad\n\n\n\n",
