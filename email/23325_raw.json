Technically I\n&gt; haven&#39;t done anything that can&#39;t=\r\n already be done with ScalaTest and my hopes\n&gt; are that rather than spawnin=\r\ng off a new framework, the good ideas are\n&gt; adopted in other frameworks and=\r\n the bad ones die with this one. Right now\n&gt; I&#39;m primarily interested in ru=\r\nnning tests and poking around in the results\n&gt; rather than easing the testw=\r\nriting itself. I&#39;m also curious where I can go\n&gt; with JUnit as a primary fo=\r\nundation, basically conforming to rather than just\n&gt; interfacing with JUnit=\r\n. Mostly for fun. I decided to make it all public in\n&gt; case it would be int=\r\neresting to anyone else and for reference when blogging\n&gt; etc.\n&gt; How I &quot;sol=\r\nved&quot; pending and pendingUntilFixed was to use an AssumptionFailed\n&gt; excepti=\r\non since it is the closest thing to an ignored exception in JUnit.\n&gt; Since =\r\nthe existing runners don&#39;t treat the assumption-errors as ignored I\n&gt; simpl=\r\ny output &quot;pending &lt;reason&gt;&quot; messages on the console when being run. It\n&gt; wo=\r\nuld be better to have the tests marked as ignored in eclipse but works as\n&gt;=\r\n a workaround.\n&gt; Quite early I got an idea about some primary goals when ru=\r\nnning from the\n&gt; REPL and the most important one was:\n&gt;\n&gt; minimize typing -=\r\n completion is not always available in the REPL (from\n&gt; eclipse, intellij a=\r\nnd to my surprise even emacs (though there must be some\n&gt; way to pass the t=\r\nab along down to the repl?))\n&gt;\n&gt; Examples of where this has led me:\n&gt;  * On=\r\nly one import\n&gt;  * short package name even if it violates javas recommendat=\r\nions\n&gt;  * package object with shortcuts to common stuff and a few implicits=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; I really wanted scala tests easy executing of tests from the REPL. The=\r\n\n&gt; JUnitCore approach is less elegant IMO and it seems like a System.exit i=\r\nn\n&gt; the the cores main shuts down the REPL. That could be worked around of\n=\r\n&gt; course by instatiation JUnitCore and passing the classes to run. A proble=\r\nm\n&gt; here from a scala perspective is that Java&#39;s way to get a Class instanc=\r\ne\n&gt; &lt;ClassName&gt;.class rolls off my fingers a bit more naturally than scalas=\r\n\n&gt; classOf[ClassName] (habit I guess). Long story short, I much prefer\n&gt; sc=\r\nalatests way and I think it&#39;s not strange that a language with a REPL\n&gt; ins=\r\npires more thought in this department. My solution here was dynamic\n&gt; mixin=\r\ns (or static if one prefers). So with a simple &quot;with Basics&quot; you can\n&gt; run =\r\nany JUnit compatible test from the REPL.\n&gt;\n&gt; Now came the issue with custom=\r\nizing the output. I decided to put that\n&gt; outside the TestCase completely. =\r\nIt feels like a runtime decision. This is\n&gt; when &quot;run&quot; changed to really me=\r\nan &quot;select&quot; (but the method on interaction is\n&gt; still called run). Basicall=\r\ny, the run method just returns a list of\n&gt; Callable[Result]-instances and t=\r\nhe BriefReport calls the one by one and\n&gt; prints out the result. This way, =\r\nthe running and the reporting is nicely\n&gt; separated and which testing style=\r\n you choose has no bearing on the output\n&gt; you see. The brief method could =\r\nbe paired with a verbose method if one\n&gt; wishes more verbose output.\n&gt;\n&gt; No=\r\nw came the color/no color issue. Color feels like an aspect of reporting.\n&gt;=\r\n This might be a case of golden hammer but to represent this aspect as a\n&gt; =\r\nstackable trait felt quite nice. Especially when creating instances of a\n&gt; =\r\nreport: new Brief with Color. One could easily imagine expanding in this\n&gt; =\r\ndirection: new Brief with Color with Summary with SourceDump with\n&gt; StackTr=\r\naceFiltering with LongRunningTestTopList ExecutionTimeStatistics ...\n&gt;\n&gt; Th=\r\ne only problem (ok there are several probably by the obvious problem\n&gt; anyw=\r\nay) is keeping the default as elegant as ScalaTest&#39;s spec.execute hence\n&gt; t=\r\nhe package object in the poju4s package that allows me to write brief(spec)=\r\n\n&gt; instead.\n&gt;\n&gt; If I want to run just a few tests that can be done like thi=\r\ns (here I assume\n&gt; I have already renamed the run-method to select):\n&gt; brie=\r\nf(spec.select(&#39;example1, &#39;example2))\n&gt;\n&gt; The fun part comes when I add glob=\r\n:\n&gt;\n&gt; biref(glob(&quot;package/*/*Spec&quot;)) or with an implicit:\n&gt; brief(&quot;package/=\r\n*/*Spec&quot;).\n&gt;\n&gt; I agree that named parameters also makes sense, or a combina=\r\ntion:\n&gt; spec.execute(color=3DFunkyScheme, options=3DList[StackTraceFilterin=\r\ng,\n&gt; SourceDump, ExecutionTimeStatistics])\n&gt;\n&gt; I also tought about some sor=\r\nt of parameter dsl:\n&gt;\n&gt; spec.select(&#39;example1, &#39;example2) &gt;&gt;: StackTraceFil=\r\ntering &gt;&gt;: Color &gt;&gt;:\n&gt; SourceDump &gt;&gt;: StdOut\n&gt; (not sure that would work or=\r\n that I would like it but... as long as we&#39;re\n&gt; tossing up ideas)\n&gt;\n&gt; As yo=\r\nu say, when something fails what one really wants to see is which\n&gt; tests f=\r\nailed. That is a missing part from my output, just effectively\n&gt; managed to=\r\n clear those pesky succeeding tests out of the way while still\n&gt; mantaining=\r\n some feedback that they were actually run. I intend to address\n&gt; that as y=\r\nou suggested, list the failing pending and ignored tests in the\n&gt; summary. =\r\nI also intend to let the run return some sort of Gist or Summary\n&gt; object t=\r\nhat allows one to poke around a bit more in the result (after all it\n&gt; is a=\r\n REPL so why shouldn&#39;t one be able to interact with the result?).\n&gt; Example=\r\ns of what one could do &quot;post&quot;-running is to dump captured std-out,\n&gt; stackt=\r\nraces, executiontimes etc, list all the names of all tests of a given\n&gt; sta=\r\ntus or what have you. I think the best is to leave the information sort\n&gt; o=\r\nf naked and then scalas excellent collection API can do it&#39;s magic of\n&gt; fil=\r\ntering, grouping and mapping to the users desire. Why not conveniently\n&gt; al=\r\nlow rerun just failed tests in this way?\n&gt;\n&gt; There is really no reason why =\r\nthese things need to be isolated to just\n&gt; JUnit, in fact it feels like my =\r\noriginal idea is much less interesting then\n&gt; to actually explore running a=\r\nnd reporting from the REPL in general. For now\n&gt; it is convenient to focus =\r\non just one framework but perhaps in the future\n&gt; the good parts can be dis=\r\ntilled into a more framework agnostic run/report\n&gt; framework or the most se=\r\nnsible thing is to just leave the ideas out there\n&gt; with a liberal license =\r\nso that the ones that work can be adopted by\n&gt; framework-vendors as they pl=\r\nease... I&#39;m not sure what is best yet but the\n&gt; license is chosen to not be=\r\n an issue for this to happen :).\n&gt;\n&gt; Long story short: one import seems to =\r\nbe a good idea, separating running\n&gt; and reporting seems to be a good idea,=\r\n and there seems to be some room for\n&gt; innovating when running tests from t=\r\nhe REPL...\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks for listening to my ramblings! It&#39;s so much fun to pl=\r\nay with these\n&gt; things without the worries of actually maintaining it for y=\r\nears and years :)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ---------------------------------------------------=\r\n--\n&gt; Joakim Ohlrogge\n&gt; Agical AB\n&gt; V=E4sterl=E5nggatan 79, 2 tr\n&gt; 111 29 St=\r\nockholm, SWEDEN\n&gt;\n&gt; Mobile: +46-708-754004\n&gt; Blog: johlrogge.wordpress.com\n=\r\n&gt; E-mail: joakim.ohlrogge@...\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; On Sat, Mar 12, 2011 at 1:25 AM, =\r\nBill Venners &lt;bill@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Hi Joakim,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; On Fri, Mar 11,=\r\n 2011 at 3:18 PM, Joakim Ohlrogge &lt;\n&gt;&gt; joakim.ohlrogge@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; If anything useful comes out of it it can be contributed for s=\r\nure.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; I&#39;ve chosen a quite liberal license (Beerware :)) in case someone =\r\nelse\n&gt;&gt;&gt; feels inspired to borrow/steal or contribute.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; I&#39;m a bit in=\r\nspired. I&#39;m sure you&#39;re aware that there&#39;s a lot of stuff in\n&gt;&gt; ScalaTest t=\r\no make writing JUnit tests in Scala more productive. And perhaps\n&gt;&gt; you&#39;re =\r\naware you can run ScalaTest tests in the Scala interpreter by\n&gt;&gt; invoking e=\r\nxecute on them. So for example given this test:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; import org.scalatest.=\r\njunit.JUnitSuite\n&gt;&gt; import scala.collection.mutable.ListBuffer\n&gt;&gt; import _r=\r\noot_.org.junit.Test\n&gt;&gt; import _root_.org.junit.Before\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; class HowSuite =\r\nextends JUnitSuite {\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;   var sb: StringBuilder =3D _\n&gt;&gt;   var lb: ListB=\r\nuffer[String] =3D _\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;   @Before def initialize() {\n&gt;&gt;     sb =3D new St=\r\nringBuilder(&quot;ScalaTest is &quot;)\n&gt;&gt;     lb =3D new ListBuffer[String]\n&gt;&gt;   }\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n\n&gt;&gt;   @Test def verifyEasy() {\n&gt;&gt;     sb.append(&quot;easy!&quot;)\n&gt;&gt;     assert(sb.t=\r\noString =3D=3D=3D &quot;ScalaTest is easy!&quot;)\n&gt;&gt;     assert(lb.isEmpty)\n&gt;&gt;     lb=\r\n +=3D &quot;sweet&quot;\n&gt;&gt;   }\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;   @Test def verifyFun() {\n&gt;&gt;     sb.append(&quot;fun!=\r\n&quot;)\n&gt;&gt;     assert(sb.toString =3D=3D=3D &quot;ScalaTest is fun!&quot;)\n&gt;&gt;     assert(l=\r\nb.isEmpty)\n&gt;&gt;   }\n&gt;&gt; }\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; You could run it in the interpreter like this =\r\n(both ScalaTest and JUnit\n&gt;&gt; need to be on the classpath):\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; user-64-9-=\r\n237-191:scalatest-1.3 bv$ scala -cp\n&gt;&gt; scalatest-1.3.jar:junit-4.4.jar\n&gt;&gt; W=\r\nelcome to Scala version 2.8.0.final (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM,\n&gt;&gt; =\r\nJava 1.6.0_22).\n&gt;&gt; Type in expressions to have them evaluated.\n&gt;&gt; Type :hel=\r\np for more information.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; scala&gt; :load HowSuite.scala\n&gt;&gt; Loading HowSui=\r\nte.scala...\n&gt;&gt; import org.scalatest.junit.JUnitSuite\n&gt;&gt; import scala.collec=\r\ntion.mutable.ListBuffer\n&gt;&gt; import _root_.org.junit.Test\n&gt;&gt; import _root_.or=\r\ng.junit.Before\n&gt;&gt; defined class HowSuite\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; scala&gt; (new HowSuite).execut=\r\ne()\n&gt;&gt; Test Starting - line5$object$$iw$$iw$HowSuite: verifyEasy\n&gt;&gt; Test Su=\r\ncceeded - line5$object$$iw$$iw$HowSuite: verifyEasy\n&gt;&gt; Test Starting - line=\r\n5$object$$iw$$iw$HowSuite: verifyFun\n&gt;&gt; Test Succeeded - line5$object$$iw$$=\r\niw$HowSuite: verifyFun\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Just create a new instance and call execute on=\r\n it and it will run. (This\n&gt;&gt; is a JUnit 4 test class, so JUnit can run it =\r\njut fine. In this case you&#39;re\n&gt;&gt; asking ScalaTest to run it, though what Sc=\r\nalaTest does is turn around and\n&gt;&gt; ask JUnit to run it, capturing and displ=\r\naying the results.) If you want to\n&gt;&gt; run just one of those tests you can s=\r\npecify it by name:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; scala&gt; (new HowSuite).execute(&quot;verifyFun&quot;)\n&gt;&gt; Test=\r\n Starting - line5$object$$iw$$iw$HowSuite: verifyFun\n&gt;&gt; Test Succeeded - li=\r\nne5$object$$iw$$iw$HowSuite: verifyFun\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; And you can pass in config map=\r\n of configuration information to execute if\n&gt;&gt; you want.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; It works, bu=\r\nt it is ugly. The output has two problems. One is that because\n&gt;&gt; I loaded =\r\nthe class with :load into the interpreter, instead of compiling it,\n&gt;&gt; I ge=\r\nt very long names for the class name with lots of dollar signs. So one\n&gt;&gt; e=\r\nnhancement would be to drop everything to the left of the first dollar\n&gt;&gt; s=\r\nign. I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;m doing that somewhere else in ScalaTest, so I could=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; do it here.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The other annoyance is you get info on both TestStart=\r\ning and\n&gt;&gt; TestSucceeded, two lines of info for each test. What I originall=\r\ny did was\n&gt;&gt; only format the output of BDD style test traits, because BDD w=\r\nas in part\n&gt;&gt; about output that looks like a spec, and TDD was not. But I&#39;v=\r\ne gotten clear\n&gt;&gt; feedback that people using the non-BDD traits would like =\r\npretty output too,\n&gt;&gt; so I&#39;ve already decided to change that. So it should =\r\nsoon look something\n&gt;&gt; like:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; scala&gt; (new HowSuite).execute()\n&gt;&gt; HowSu=\r\nite\n&gt;&gt; - verifyEasy\n&gt;&gt; - verifyFun\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Another thing I did originally was=\r\n not show color when you use execute(),\n&gt;&gt; because I wasn&#39;t sure how to let=\r\n people turn color off, and I felt it was\n&gt;&gt; worse to force color on people=\r\n whose terminals didn&#39;t support it than the\n&gt;&gt; other way around. But people=\r\n really like color. It is pretty and makes it\n&gt;&gt; more readable. So what I&#39;d=\r\n like to do is figure out some way to let people\n&gt;&gt; configure color, full s=\r\ntack traces, and durations when using execute. Now\n&gt;&gt; that Scala has defaul=\r\nt params, that&#39;s probably the right way to do it. So\n&gt;&gt; color would be the =\r\ndefault, and to turn it off you&#39;d say:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; scala&gt; (new HowSuite).execute(=\r\ncolor =3D false)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; And lastly, your dots idea is interesting. Whenever =\r\nI run with a standard\n&gt;&gt; out reporter, I get lots and lots and lots of gree=\r\nn test names that passed.\n&gt;&gt; And what I really care about is the ones that =\r\nfailed. So I think it may make\n&gt;&gt; sense to add one more option to the stand=\r\nard out/err and file reporters that\n&gt;&gt; just shows one dot for each passed t=\r\nest. And then that could possibly be the\n&gt;&gt; default for execute, maybe.\n&gt;&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;&gt; And lastly lastly, maybe execute should show a summary line at the end,\n=\r\n&gt;&gt; like the runner does.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; As far as getting JUnit to do something like=\r\n pending and\n&gt;&gt; pendingUntilFixed, that will be tough until JUnit can treat=\r\n some kind of\n&gt;&gt; exception specially. Be nice to have a TestIgnoredExceptio=\r\nn that gets\n&gt;&gt; reported as an ignored test in JUnit someday.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Bill\n&gt;&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;  Lets see where it goes. Right now it&#39;s mostly for fun.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; /J\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; =\r\n-----------------------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Joakim Ohlrogge\n&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt; Agical AB\n&gt;&gt;&gt; V=E4sterl=E5nggatan 79, 2 tr\n&gt;&gt;&gt; 111 29 Stockholm, SWEDEN\n=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Mobile: &lt;%2B46-708-754004&gt;+46-708-754004\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Blog: johlrogge.wo=\r\nrdpress.com\n&gt;&gt;&gt; E-mail: joakim.ohlrogge@...\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; On Fri, Mar 11, 2=\r\n011 at 8:13 PM, David Saff &lt;david@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Joakim,\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; Not silly at all.
