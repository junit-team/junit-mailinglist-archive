In most cases the {@link org.junit.runner.Description}<br>\n * will be of a single test. However, if problems are encountered while constructing the<br>\n * test (for example, if a {@link org.junit.BeforeClass} method is not static), it may describe<br>\n * something other than a single test.<br>\n<br>\nBut I can&#39;t figure out *how* I can read this failure and know that it is BeforeClass or not. I did some really ugly hacks by looking at the backtrace to see where it was triggered from that that&#39;s really fragile and I&#39;d like something better.<br>\nI tried reading through Description and see if I could figure it out, but no luck thus far.<br>\n<br>\nTIA,<br>\n  Chris<br>\n</p>\n\n    </div>\n     \n\n    \n    <div style=\"color:#fff;min-height:0;\"></div>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div></div></blockquote></div></span></blockquote></div>\n</div>",
