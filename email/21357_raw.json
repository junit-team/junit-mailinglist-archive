I&#39;m trying to set up a group of tests that runs only under\n&gt; certain circumstances. Because they are database tests, they have\n&gt; expensive setup and teardown procedures (via DBUnit), so they are\n&gt; segregated to run separately. The way to get that done seems to be via\n&gt; a separate runner, so I hacked up a class that looks like this:\n&gt; (Inspiration from here:\n&gt; http://schuchert.wikispaces.com/CustomJunit4RunnerJUnit4_4 but that\n&gt; example no longer applies to the 4.5 API):\n&gt;\n&gt; public class SlowTestRunner extends Runner {\n&gt;\n&gt; private Runner runner;\n&gt; private Class&lt;?&gt; klass;\n&gt;\n&gt; public SlowTestRunner(Class&lt;?&gt; klass, RunnerBuilder builder)\n&gt; throws Throwable {\n&gt; this.klass = klass;\n&gt; if (Boolean.getBoolean(&quot;RunSlowTests&quot;)) {\n&gt; runner = getAppropriateRunner(builder);\n&gt; } else {\n&gt; runner = new IgnoredClassRunner(klass);\n&gt; }\n&gt; }\n&gt;\n&gt; private Runner getAppropriateRunner(RunnerBuilder builder) {\n&gt; List&lt;RunnerBuilder&gt; builders = Arrays.asList(\n&gt; new IgnoredBuilder(),\n&gt; new AnnotatedBuilder(builder),\n&gt; new SuiteMethodBuilder(),\n&gt; new JUnit3Builder(),\n&gt; new JUnit4Builder());\n&gt;\n&gt; for (RunnerBuilder each : builders) {\n&gt; Runner runner = each.safeRunnerForClass(klass);\n&gt; if (runner != null && runner.getClass() != this.getClass())\n&gt; return runner;\n&gt; }\n&gt; //this is actually never going to happen, at least in the\n&gt; current implementation because the JUnit4Builder is the Builder of\n&gt; last resort.\n&gt; return new ErrorReportingRunner(klass, new\n&gt; InitializationError(&quot;Unable to find suitable runner to delegate for &quot;\n&gt; + klass.getName()));\n&gt; }\n&gt;\n&gt; public Description getDescription() {\n&gt; return runner.getDescription();\n&gt; }\n&gt;\n&gt; public void run(RunNotifier notifier) {\n&gt; runner.run(notifier);\n&gt; }\n&gt; }\n&gt;\n&gt; The method getAppropriateRunner is basically a copy/paste from\n&gt; AllDefaultPossibilitiesBuilder. I had to copy paste because the\n&gt; protected method forced a return of an AnnotatedBuilder, instead of\n&gt; just a RunnerBuilder, so overriding wasn&#39;t working well. Note the case\n&gt; here is that I&#39;m not sure if the class is a JUnit3 or 4 class, and I\n&gt; want to support both with one runner.\n&gt;\n&gt; At first I tried to just do a runnerForClass on builder passed to the\n&gt; constructor, but that causes an infinite loop, because the class has\n&gt; the RunWith annotation on it that references the very same Runner.\n&gt;\n&gt; Am I correct that the API isn&#39;t naturally supporting what I am trying\n&gt; to do, or is there another way to accomplish this?\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n\n-- \nWell, as long as you&#39;re in my house, you&#39;ll do what I do, and believe what I\nbelieve. So butter your bacon! Bacon that sausage!\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
