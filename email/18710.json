    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-849100832\">David:<br/>\n\tWhen I envision a system that would extract my guide, and build the <br/>\ntest case into the junit test set for the class I am driven by laziness. <br/>\n  I totally agree that in the simplest cases, the difference between the <br/>\nguide and a full test case is minimal as you pointed out.  But as the <br/>\nnecessary setup and preconfiguration grows in complexity I&#39;d like to be <br/>\nable to simply specify a set of inputs and a known correct result, then <br/>\nhave the computer do the work.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really believe in testing, and I always write test cases, but (oh, the <br/>\nshame) I don&#39;t really like to spend my time writing tests. So anything <br/>\nthat can reduce the hurdles between me and fully tested (both verified <br/>\nand validated) is a big win.<br/>\n<br/>\nI clearly agree with all the benefits you pointed out for generating <br/>\ntests from some structured comment format in the code itself. I agree <br/>\nwith many of the benefits of writing the tests as java/junit code <br/>\ndirectly.  We are not big on test driven design so the benefits of J2 <br/>\nare marginal; but we are strongly into test driven development. As a <br/>\nresult, being able to quickly and easily specify inputs and outputs for <br/>\ntest cases and hang them next to the implementation code would work <br/>\nreally well for our development processes, provided that we can then <br/>\nextract those guidances into fully functional test cases.  So in the <br/>\nspirit of the original &#39;and then the programmer presses a button, and <br/>\nall the tests are generated automatically&#39;, a combination of <br/>\ncharacterization tests for verification, and developer inserted <br/>\nvalidation tests seems like it might cover all the bases.  Clearly this <br/>\nis somewhat antithetical to the test driven design paradigm.<br/>\n<br/>\nI share your concern about domain specific languages so perhaps the <br/>\nnotion would be to simply write the assert into the comments (tagged in <br/>\na way that the test generator can find it) and then let something like <br/>\njunitfactory generate the test:<br/>\n<br/>\n//** assertEquals(5.0, new Point(0.0).distanceTo(new Point 3,4)); **//<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is in java/junit, it is clean, it resides in the source code, and <br/>\n(with the right tool) whatever extra is needed for the setup can be <br/>\nhandled by the generator. So it would seem to get all the benefits you <br/>\nlisted, except that tricky J2.  I guess my extreme laziness rose to the <br/>\nfore. My first thought was that  by always specifying the inputs and the <br/>\noutput, I could avoid the repeated typing of assertEquals(...), and then <br/>\nI figured that, since the comment is lexically associated with the <br/>\nfunction being tested, there was no need to repeatedly type <br/>\ndistanceTo(...), so all that was left was the parameter list and the <br/>\nexpected result.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, this is the slippery slope that leads to first, an overly <br/>\nspecific DSL; and then (apparently) inevitably a clunky general purpose <br/>\nlanguage that can be more trouble than it is worth. But it sure would <br/>\nmake my life easier!<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your insight,<br/>\nJim<br/>\n<br/>\nDavid Saff wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On 1/10/07, James P.

Bummer.<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; I would need be able to add something like:<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; //** Test Point(0,0), Point(3,4), 5.0 **//<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; as a guide to the test generator as to what was expected. Then, in<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; addition to all the other valuable verification tests of corner cases,<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; etc.; it could generate the validation test.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I find myself often tempted to do something like this. But then, I<br/>\n&gt; wonder if this is much better than<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; @Test public void pythagoreanDistance() {<br/>\n&gt; assertEquals(5.0, new Point(0.0).distanceTo(new Point 3,4));<br/>\n&gt; }<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; As I see it, the advantages of generation from comments, as you&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; proposing are:<br/>\n&gt; G1) The validation code sits close to the implementation code, making<br/>\n&gt; it easier to look at both and reason about them<br/>\n&gt; G2) Specific behavior examples can sit next to general statements<br/>\n&gt; about correct behavior, with the same syntax<br/>\n&gt; G3) A custom domain-specific language can reduce typing.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The advantages of the JUnit approach are:<br/>\n&gt; J1) Java is actually usually a pretty good language for describing the<br/>\n&gt; behavior of Java programs (this is not entirely tongue-in-cheek. For<br/>\n&gt; example, bash is a rather poor language with which to describe the<br/>\n&gt; behavior of shell scripts)<br/>\n&gt; J2) When it&#39;s hard to write Java to validate my implementation code,<br/>\n&gt; sometimes that means my code has a bad design.<br/>\n&gt; J3) Not having to learn a custom domain-specific language reduces <br/>\n&gt; cognitive load<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I currently believe that it&#39;s easier to improve tooling around a<br/>\n&gt; JUnit-like framework to get the advantages of code generation than<br/>\n&gt; vice-versa. I think that G1, looking at tests and implementation<br/>\n&gt; simultaneously, is something that IDE&#39;s can still improve upon<br/>\n&gt; tremendously when using JUnit. Ideally, when a test failed, I would<br/>\n&gt; automatically be able to see the failure log, the test, and the<br/>\n&gt; implementation code in side-by-side windows. My Theories work is<br/>\n&gt; designed to bring the G2 advantages to people using JUnit, allowing<br/>\n&gt; general statements to be written and evaluated in a JUnit style. As<br/>\n&gt; to G3, I&#39;ve yet to see a domain-specific language (DSL) for tests that<br/>\n&gt; really excites me*, but I believe that someday I might.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; None of this touches on the idea of generating characterization tests,<br/>\n&gt; as with junitfactory. What I&#39;m getting at is the best way for a<br/>\n&gt; developer to write down what the implementation code should do, to get<br/>\n&gt; automated support for verifying that it does.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; David Saff<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; * (esoteric side comment) especially since I&#39;m a firm believer that<br/>\n&gt; every external DSL maintained long enough eventually becomes a poorly<br/>\n&gt; implemented general-purpose OO language.
