They point out that TestCase, like key abstractions in<br/>\nmany mature frameworks, has a high pattern density, making it easy to use<br/>\nbut hard to change. In this installment of the AOP@Work series, Wes Isberg<br/>\nrevisits the Cook&#39;s Tour and shows you how using AOP pointcuts rather than<br/>\nobject-oriented designs can help you avoid some of the pattern density<br/>\nthat makes mature designs hard to change.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe author further goes on to state that:<br/>\n<br/>\nIn this article, I walk through the design presented by Erich Gamma and<br/>\nKent                                                                  Beck<br/>\nin &quot;JUnit: A Cook&#39;s Tour&quot; (see the Resources section). For each Java      <br/>\npattern they present, I propose an AspectJ alternative and evaluate how it<br/>\nsatisfies some of these canonical design goals:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-aopwork7/index.html\">http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-aopwork7/index.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\nVivek Oswal</div>",
