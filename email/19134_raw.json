I do not want to test a JWS application in a standard JWS \nenvironment=\r\n, since that will require to have a full jnlp deployment (jnlp file, jar ar=\r\nchives \ndone, etc...) each time I have to test.\n\nI would love to test my ap=\r\nplication in a standard java environment inside my IDE for \ndebugging/autom=\r\nated junit testing.\n\nThis can be easily done for a java web start applicati=\r\non, since it&#39;s a standard java \napplication after all. The problem is when =\r\nyou make use of specific jnlp APIs: even though \nthe interfaces are availab=\r\nle in the jnlp.jar included with every JVM, the implementation \nclasses alo=\r\nng with all the needed system properties and tidbits gets loaded ONLY when =\r\nthe \napplication is started from the javaws executable.\n\nThis effectively f=\r\norbid you to use automated testing/debugging inside your usual IDE (I use \n=\r\neclipse), and you are forced to make up a jnlp package EACH TIME you want t=\r\no test, for \nevery single line of code you modify.\n\nI have yet to find a wa=\r\ny to test JNLP classes INSIDE an IDE without requiring a full \ndeployment, =\r\nand have yet to find how can I do some automated testing with JUnit for the=\r\nse \nclasses as well.\n\nThis is my problem :)\n\n\n",
