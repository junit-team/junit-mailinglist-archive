One assertion per test case produces clean code and \nit&#39;s a noble sentiment I strive towards, but when test cases involve \ntalking to software outside of my control (by which I mean \npoorly-implemented third party applications) the temptation to have \nmultiple assertions in a single test case is sometimes too great.\n\nI certainly agree that when it _has_ to happen, ordering assertions by \ncomplexity is a smart move.\n--\nStephen Smith, MEng (Wales).\nhttp://www.stephen-smith.co.uk/\n\nErnst Reissner wrote:\n&gt; Hello,\n&gt; if all talk about multiple asserts, maybe i should do so as well:\n&gt; i confess: i also use multiple assertions:\n&gt; very often i have one test(method) per method (to be tested).\n&gt; Within this test i start with the most basic ones.\n&gt; If those fail.. well then it is quite unlikely that the others pass,\n&gt; but be it as it be:\n&gt; i have to fix the most basic bugs first.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Thus it is not a problem that the other failures are masked,\n&gt; it is an advantage.\n&gt; \n&gt; The ordering of the assertions to be checked within a test\n&gt; have their own meaning.\n&gt; \n&gt; Maybe that&#39;s pretty much like Andreas way of testing.\n&gt; \n&gt; dogmatic attitudes like\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; list, so check the archives.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The short version: No, you can&#39;t, and you shouldn&#39;t, because those are\n&gt; 3\n&gt;&gt; different tests.\n&gt; \n&gt; do not convince me.\n&gt; by the way: searching the archives shows pluralism on that question.\n&gt; \n&gt; so: feel free.\n&gt; \n&gt; greetings\n&gt; \n&gt; ernst\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo!
