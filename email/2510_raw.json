So by making\nall the component variables private, I realize that I am just causing trouble for myself, since it doesn&#39;t hide them after all.  So\nnowadays I make all my widget memeber variables (JButton, JLabel, JTextField, etc.) pakcage private so that my testing classes can\naccess them easily.  My other fields are still private.\n\nThis has worked out pretty good for me for all the UI testings, but I am just a little bit concerned about the package private\nvariables.\n\nIs there anyone doing the same thing?  Or is there a better solution?\n\n\nMatt Caswell wrote:\n\n&gt; Try JFCUnit for Swing UI stuff....\n&gt;\n&gt; http://sourceforge.net/projects/jfcunit/\n&gt;\n&gt; Matt\n&gt;\n&gt; _____\n&gt; This email and any attachments are confidential and are intended only for\n&gt; the addressee.
