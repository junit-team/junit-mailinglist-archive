That&#39;s like making your tech support user friendly by outsourcing <br/>\nit to trained professionasl in India rather than letting your clients <br/>\ntalk directly to the developers. There&#39;s a ton of theory (i.e. <br/>\nrationalizations) to support doing that, and it&#39;s completely <br/>\ncounterproductive in practice.<br/>\n<br/>\nInterfaces are very popular among the most theoretical programmers: i.e. <br/>\nexactly the sort of programmers who are likely to write books, read <br/>\nbooks about OO theory, and hang out on lists like this one. However in <br/>\nmy experience concrete classes are much simpler and much preferred by <br/>\nthe vast majority of pragmatic programmers just getting their jobs done.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can certainly see how making a class test-friendly could make it less <br/>\ncaller-friendly. In fact, exactly how to do that is the subject of <br/>\nanother perma-thread on this list. exposing methods purely for the <br/>\nconvenience of testers expands a class&#39;s interface and makes it harder <br/>\nto learn, use, and understand. Minimal interfaces are simpler to <br/>\nunderstand and learn. Exposing additional methods purely for test <br/>\nconvenience is very counter-productive to caller-convenience. The only <br/>\npublic parts of a class&#39;s interface should be things that are relevant <br/>\nto client programmers.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n﻿Elliotte Rusty Harold  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:elharo@...\">elharo@...</a><br/>\nJava I/O 2nd Edition Just Published!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafeaulait.org/books/javaio2/\">http://www.cafeaulait.org/books/javaio2/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596527500/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/\">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596527500/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/</a></div>",
