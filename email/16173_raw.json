If anyone has an &quot;inside connection&quot; t=\r\no ant, \n&gt; let me know.\n\nI&#39;m an emeritus committer for Ant, and get on well =\r\nwith some of the head\nhonchos. I&#39;ve volunteered on the Ant mailing list to =\r\nbe a conduit\nbetween these two lists, where one is needed, and to do *some*=\r\n work\ninvolved in writing a JUnit4 Ant task.\n\nOne of the things near the to=\r\np of my priority list is that we don&#39;t get\ninto the current mess again wher=\r\neby you need to add JUnit&#39;s jar file to\nAnt&#39;s lib directory (or specify -li=\r\nb ...) due to the JUnit task already\nbeing part of the distribution. To be =\r\nhonest, I think the JUnit project\nshould &quot;own&quot; the Ant task more than Ant s=\r\nhould. (I&#39;m not suggesting it\nshould be part of the normal JUnit distributi=\r\non, however.) Hopefully\nlicences shouldn&#39;t get in the way of using a lot of=\r\n the existing JUnit\nAnt task and contributing it to a JUnit-owned repositor=\r\ny...\n\nI suspect that a lack of first-class Ant support would be a major\ncon=\r\ntributing factor to a slow take-up of JUnit4.\n\nAs I say, I&#39;m happy to do so=\r\nme of the work, but as we&#39;ve seen before I&#39;m\nnot always able to find time t=\r\no do all I&#39;d like to (parameterised tests\nanyone? I&#39;ll get back to it some =\r\nday!). This is likely to become worse\nin a couple of months when we go from=\r\n a family of three to a family of\nfive - but I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll find *some* hack=\r\ning time. In particular I&#39;m\nalso happy to code review :)\n\nJon\n\n\nClearswift =\r\nmonitors, controls and protects all its messaging traffic in compliance wit=\r\nh its corporate email policy using Clearswift products.\nFind out more about=\r\n Clearswift, its solutions and services at http://www.clearswift.com\n\nThis =\r\ncommunication is confidential and may contain privileged information intend=\r\ned solely for the named addressee(s).
