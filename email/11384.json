If that <br/>\nfails, then all your database dependant tests fail, you know that <br/>\nthe connection could not be established due to the DB connection <br/>\ntest.  The fact that the other tests fail as a side effect is <br/>\nsomewhat irrelevant.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other suggestion I saw about doing asserts in setup could be <br/>\nused, too.  Or, something I currently do (an idea blatantly stolen <br/>\nfrom my co-workers), if testing some pre-existing condition is to <br/>\nsimply notate:<br/>\n<br/>\nassertEquals(&quot;Test setup: This should be zero initially&quot;, 0, <br/>\nsomeClass.Value());<br/>\n<br/>\nThen if a &#39;test setup&#39; assert is thrown, you know that there was <br/>\nsomething wrong before you even made it to the asserts you were <br/>\nreally testing.  Very useful, simple, and doesn&#39;t require some grand <br/>\nmechanism.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Eric<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, Andrew Forward &lt;aforward@g...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Yes.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; But all database tests will fail, without any one test pin-pointing<br/>\n&gt; the why.  I would prefer to see one problem (in this case invalid<br/>\n&gt; database connection) be isolated by one failing test (additional <br/>\ntests<br/>\n&gt; may fail - but more because of the side effect of this one test).<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
