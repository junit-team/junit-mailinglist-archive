We separate the test cases in an own package. Is that best<br/>\n&gt;    practice?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It&#39;s generally a matter of taste, except...<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;    2. When doing this, some methods with default (package) visiblilty<br/>\n&gt;    cannot be accessed. But when using the Reflection API, this methods<br/>\n&gt;    can be accessed. Is it okay to use the reflection? Or is it bad<br/>\n&gt;    style?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>... when your public API has the benefit of being package private, I<br/>\nthink it makes sense to put tests in the same package structure.  That<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t mean they have to live in the same physical directory though. <br/>\nYou could group tests in their own top level directory and prod. code in<br/>\nits own.  With this you can keep the same exact package structures in<br/>\nboth but tests don&#39;t get mixed into prod. code, if that matters to you.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;    3. What about testing private methods? It is normally not possible<br/>\n&gt;    if the test is in an own class. But again I can use the reflection<br/>\n&gt;    to acess private methods. Should I do that? Or should I only test<br/>\n&gt;    methods with public access?<br/>\n&gt;    Maybe this question has been asked. But I have problems<br/>\n&gt;    understanding the nature of the search results in this forum.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>In general, I think testing private methods is really a violation of the<br/>\nobject.  If you are testing its public API (note the answer to #2), you<br/>\nare really testing everything under the covers vicariously.  This gives<br/>\nyou the freedom of keeping the API but changing the implementation.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\n=jason<br/>\n[:question | ^One]</div>",
