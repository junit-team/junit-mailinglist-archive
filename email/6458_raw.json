I think the\njoke about Canadians =\r\nbeing unusually polite might put some people off,\nbut being Canadian, I und=\r\nerstand.\n\n&gt;To me, it smacks of self-righteousness and shameless self-promot=\r\nion.\n\nYou know what, that&#39;s not so bad. When I do good work that I think\nhe=\r\nlps people, I promote it. If they find it good, they also promote it.\nIf th=\r\ney find it bad, they tell me and I stop promoting it.\n\nI wrote &quot;JUnit: A St=\r\narter Guide&quot; in response to two solid weeks of\ncomplaining on this list abo=\r\nut how crappy the JUnit documentation is.\nAbout four people in a row said t=\r\nhey wanted a tutorial and I wrote one,\nthen found some other good ones on t=\r\nhe web. Mike Clark put together a\nFAQ to go along side his excellent tutori=\r\nal. Among us all, I think we\nhave the tutorial angle covered. Several thous=\r\nand people have read that\ndocument and I haven&#39;t seen a single complaint on=\r\n this list since that\ntime. That was about a year ago.\n\nLet me ask you, am =\r\nI wrong to be proud of that and to refer people to\nit if they ask for a tut=\r\norial?\n\n&gt;I didn&#39;t come here to have some guy and his buddy disparage the id=\r\neas \n&gt;that I offer without offering anything in exchange other than, &quot;This =\r\n\n&gt;is how it is.  Buy my book!&quot;\n\nSee, this is just sad. First, I&#39;m not &quot;his =\r\nbuddy&quot;. Dave and I have\nexchanged the odd e-mail, but we hardly know each o=\r\nther. We respect\neach other&#39;s work (at least I hope), but that&#39;s all. I tru=\r\nst that Dave\nwill tackle your problem in an upcoming Coad letter. I thought=\r\n it was\nrude of you to insist he get off his ass and answer your question r=\r\night\nnow. That was how I saw your comment. Just because the man didn&#39;t want=\r\n\nto type a long answer right that second doesn&#39;t mean that he didn&#39;t\nhave a=\r\n good answer and it doesn&#39;t mean that he wasn&#39;t going to share\nhis answer. =\r\nAnd OF COURSE if he has written the answer in a book, I\ndon&#39;t blame him for=\r\n wanting you to buy the book, rather than get his\nadvice free. Be aware tha=\r\nt we could be charging hundreds of dollars per\nday for our advice. We are v=\r\nolunteers here.\n\n&gt;I think if a person jumps into a discussion and says, &quot;Yo=\r\nur approach \n&gt;sucks.  Buy my book!&quot; they should at least explain why.  That=\r\n might \n&gt;actually be helpful to others.\n\nI honestly didn&#39;t see &quot;Your approa=\r\nch sucks&quot;. I hope that my other reply\nmade it clearer what I think Dave was=\r\n getting at: most people\nmisunderstand (as I did for two years) why the cla=\r\nss TestCase is meant\nto embody a test fixture. The fact that it&#39;s named Tes=\r\ntCase is a source\nof confusion. Kent admitted that himself!\n\n&gt;&gt; Yet, I have=\r\nn&#39;t \n&gt;&gt; seen any explanation as to what is inferior in your approach - \n&gt;&gt; =\r\nasserting it&#39;s inferior does not make it so.\n&gt;\n&gt;I couldn&#39;t agree more.\n\nIf =\r\nI say &quot;you should brush your teeth&quot;, do you attack me? The bottom\nline is t=\r\nhat you *should* brush your teeth, assuming that you want good\ndental healt=\r\nh and your teeth to last a long time. If you don&#39;t care\nabout dental health=\r\n, or if your teeth are magical and stay clean all on\ntheir own, or if not b=\r\nrushing your teeth hasn&#39;t affected your life to\nthis point, then certainly,=\r\n continue not brushing your teeth.\n\nHOWEVER, if later on your teeth all fal=\r\nl out and you don&#39;t like what\nthat does to you, then you make look back on =\r\nmy advice and say, &quot;You\nknow, perhaps I should have brushed my teeth.&quot;\n\nSo =\r\nyou can take it as you like. Either assume that we&#39;re Just Trying To\nHelp o=\r\nr assume that we&#39;re out to disparage you. Your choice. If you\nchoose to bel=\r\nieve that we&#39;re out to disparage you, then please\nunderstand when we say th=\r\nat we know better than you know what our\nintentions are.\n\n&gt;&gt; I also found t=\r\nhe waving \n&gt;&gt; of the moderator stick distasteful; it&#39;s far too early for th=\r\nat.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; A suggestion - stop posting for 24 hours on this thread, then co=\r\nme \n&gt;&gt; back to it.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Bill de h=D3ra\n&gt;\n&gt;Whoops, too late for that!  Heh=\r\neh.\n&gt;\n&gt;For the record, I never said I disagreed with what Dave and J. B. ar=\r\ne \n&gt;advocating.  I never said I didn&#39;t like them personally, either.  \n&gt;It&#39;=\r\ns the delivery of their message I find curious.  It seems more \n&gt;geared tow=\r\nard self-interest than equitable exchange or mutual benefit.\n\nI would love =\r\nfor you to show me where, in my reply, you felt that my\nadvice was delivere=\r\nd with self-interest as opposed to YOUR benefit,\nnevermind MUTUAL benefit. =\r\nAt least one of us will be able to learn from\nthat exercise, and probably b=\r\noth.\n\nI mean messages 6421, 6435 and 6442 up until the point that I objecte=\r\nd\nto what I perceived as your rudeness.\n\nJ.
