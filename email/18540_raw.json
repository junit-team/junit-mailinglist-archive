I need to create unit tests for QA and they require an option to\nselect which test to run at runtime. I know that there is the @Ignore\nbut it need to be hard code at compile time... so I wonder if there is\nany other option in JUnit to let users specifies at runtime which tests\nto run? I saw the extension package, which have @Prerequisite annotation\nand will let me create a method eg. IsDBAvailable But I tried to have\nparameters to the method, eg. RunThisTest(String testName) and it would\nnot allow me to do so. .. I have too many test cases and I don&#39;t want to\nhave to write a separate function for each of them. Any suggestion on\nhow to skip a test at runtime is appreciated.\n\n \n\nThank you so much in advance,\n\nVietchau\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
