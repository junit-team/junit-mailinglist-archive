It is true, but these\n&gt; are the so=\r\nrt of errors that raraly occur anyhow and are usually trivial to\n&gt; notice, =\r\nfind and fix (if you have tests). And static typing makes you pay a\n&gt; high =\r\nprice for preventing these trivial errors - it&#39;s not just the type\n&gt; declar=\r\nations for the vars, the impact goes a lot deeper.\n&gt;\n&gt;   As a comment to do=\r\ning refactoring w/out static typing: having done some\n&gt; fairly big refactor=\r\nings in a program written in Ruby I can say it wasn&#39;t\n&gt; that hard - as I ha=\r\nd the tests. If I didn&#39;t have the tests it would have\n&gt; been more difficult=\r\n.\n\n\nI don&#39;t want to stray off topic too much, but I&#39;d like to make two quic=\r\nk\npoints in favor of static typing:\n\n   - The value is not so much about ro=\r\nbustness (I agree that mis-casts\n   are rare) but about documentation.  I d=\r\no a lot of code reviews every day and\n   I can tell you that reviewing Pyth=\r\non or Ruby is an order of magnitude harder\n   than reviewing Java because I=\r\n can never tell what types are expected from\n   method signatures.\n\n   - Re=\r\nfactoring in dynamically typed languages is inherently unsafe.\n   You can&#39;t=\r\n even rename a method reliably.  I&#39;m glad it worked for you, but\n   you nee=\r\nd to keep in mind that renaming in a dynamically typed language is\n   nothi=\r\nng more than a string replace.
