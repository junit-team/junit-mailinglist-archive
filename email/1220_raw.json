This way it will be reinstantiated for every single test case.\nThis is probably the desired behaviour.\n\nJohannes\n\ndnixon@... wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m just getting started using JUnit to test a Swing application.\n&gt; In my test case I want to manipulate the GUI, eg simulate button\n&gt; clicks etc. (really I want to invoke the commands the buttons\n&gt; represent). How can my test case find an instance of the GUI objects\n&gt; to call? I tried having a static variable that contains the last GUI\n&gt; screen instance, but this is null inside my test case whereas it\n&gt; returns a non-null instance when accessed from\n&gt; my non-Junit code immediately before that.\n&gt; Am I doing something silly that causes the static access to return\n&gt; null? My startup code IS a bit &quot;funky&quot; for historical reasons.\n&gt; Or is there a better way of going about running test cases in GUI\n&gt; apps?\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m using JUnit 3.5 with JDK 1.3 on Windows NT. No IDEs.\n\n",
