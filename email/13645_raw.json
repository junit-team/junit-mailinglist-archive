Surely you have this /somewhere/. That&#39;s \nwhat can go into setUp().\n\n&gt; Am I missing something here?\n\nLet me ask you: in the case where you want one-time setup, do all your \ntests in that TestCase class talk to some external, global resource, \nlike a database? That would explain a great deal.\n\nTake care.\n-- \nJ. B.
