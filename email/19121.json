The change log is below.<br/>\n<br/>\nShare and Enjoy,<br/>\n<br/>\nTeam JUnit<br/>\nSummary of Changes with version 4.3<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n   - Changes in array equality. Using assertEquals to compare array<br/>\n   contents is now deprecated. In the future, assertEquals will revert to<br/>\n   its pre-4.0 meaning of comparing objects based on Java&#39;s<br/>\nObject.equalssemantics. To compare array contents, use the new, more<br/>\nreliable<br/>\n   Assert.assertArrayEquals methods.<br/>\n   - The @Ignore annotation can now be applied to classes, to ignore the<br/>\n   entire class, instead of individual methods.<br/>\n   - Originally, developers who wanted to use a static suite() method<br/>\n   from JUnit 3.x with a JUnit 4.x runner had to annotate the class with<br/>\n   @RunWith(AllTests.class). In the common case, this requirement has<br/>\n   been removed. However, when such a class is wrapped with a JUnit4TestAdapter<br/>\n   (which we believe is rare), the results may not be as expected.<br/>\n   - Improved error messages for array comparison(&quot;arrays first differed<br/>\n   at element [1][0]&quot;)<br/>\n   - Bug fix: Inaccessible base class is caught at test construction<br/>\n   time.<br/>\n   - Bug fix: Circular suites are caught at test construction time.<br/>\n   - Bug fix: Test constructors that throw exceptions are reported<br/>\n   correctly.<br/>\n   - *For committers and extenders*<br/>\n      - Sources now are in a separate &quot;src&quot; directory (this means a<br/>\n      big break in the CVS history)<br/>\n      - Improved documentation in Request, RunWith<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
