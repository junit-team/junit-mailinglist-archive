For example, we noticed that on Wednesdays the DevCreek team<br/>\n&gt; itself wrote a quarter of the tests it wrote on other days. Turns out they<br/>\n&gt; were spending most of the day preparing for the weekly status meeting.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>So.  Side topic, and favorite horse-floggee of mine:  did the metric<br/>\ndo anything for us that simply knowing the team well wouldn&#39;t have<br/>\nalready done?  I&#39;m assuming, here, dangerous habit, that there was no<br/>\nteam-perceived process-weakness on Wednesdays prior to the metric.  If<br/>\nthat&#39;s a valid assumption, dangerous habit admitted, then this would<br/>\nseem to be a case where a metric -- not free -- gave us a false<br/>\npositive -- not free -- requiring at least a little bit of<br/>\ninvestigation to determine root cause -- not free.  Metrics are<br/>\nscarily complex to me, and I wish my world had either fewer of them,<br/>\nor fewer people relying on them.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Teams<br/>\n&gt; using DevCreek don&#39;t seem to change their behavior much on the basis of the<br/>\n&gt; feedback, though, which I find surprising. Perhaps the feedback isn&#39;t really<br/>\n&gt; all that useful, perhaps we don&#39;t have the right presentation of the<br/>\n&gt; information, or perhaps people just need to get used to the idea that the<br/>\n&gt; information is there for them.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Or, another favorite equine victim of mine, perhaps people are<br/>\ndecidedly less rational than we routinely realize.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, once having typed this in, I immediately jump to another<br/>\nway of seeing it:  put scare quotes around &#39;rational&#39;.  To make this<br/>\nsecond idea more clear, I&#39;ll say I might have theorized that the team<br/>\nwould respond (incorrectly) by &#39;rationally&#39; honoring feedback that<br/>\ndidn&#39;t meet its -- what words to use here? -- gestalt self-image.  In<br/>\nfact, the team responded (correctly) by &#39;irrationally&#39; ignoring<br/>\nfeedback that didn&#39;t meet that gestalt self-image.<br/>\n<br/>\nA third way in to the puzzle:  information is not useful until it is<br/>\nintegrated into a framework of meaning.  At any given time, any such<br/>\nframework has a loose boundary (the so-called hermeneutic horizon),<br/>\nwhich represents the only possible locations where new information can<br/>\nbe fit.  If the boundary is not situated where the new information can<br/>\nbe fit in, it will be ignored, hence useless.  So it pays to focus<br/>\none&#39;s attention not just on generating data, but on generating the<br/>\ndata that will fit the current boundary for the current group and<br/>\nenable that group to become what it wants.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is why I am so negative about quests for ever-more-detailed<br/>\nmetrics, or one-size-fits-all approaches to measuring progress in<br/>\nhuman enterprise.  Down this road lies Taylor, and a reversion of some<br/>\nparticularly hard won 20th century knowledge.  When someone posts<br/>\nabout &quot;what metric is best?&quot;, I wish we could all post back &quot;the one<br/>\nthat helps your team&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m reminded of a magnificent insight granted to me by Jerome Bruner,<br/>\nwho somewhere remarks that the purpose of therapy is not to reveal the<br/>\ntruth, but to construct a story which enables the patient to move<br/>\ntowards his or her goal.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\nHill<br/>\nWanna learn XP skills the hard way?
