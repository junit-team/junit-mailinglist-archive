Besides running time and number of \nfai=\r\nlures, the other distinguishing feature of acceptance tests is that \nthe in=\r\nteracts often cross the system&#39;s boundary.  By that I mean input \ncomes thr=\r\nough non-java interfaces such as GUIs, message systems, etc. \nand output in=\r\nvolve more side effects (i.e. go to places other than \nback to the source).=\r\n  In some cases, these can be shoehorned into a \nJava interface (e.g. httpu=\r\nnit) but this is often where the need for \nother tools comes in.\n\nThe reaso=\r\nn for fine-grained testing is that large-grained tests are \noverwhelmed by =\r\ncombinatoric explosion of conditions long before they \nachieve reasonable c=\r\noverage.  The &quot;unit&quot; is usually a single class.  \nThe system can be tens to=\r\n thousands of classes.  For small systems, \nthe gap may be small enough tha=\r\nt unit and acceptance tests are \nsufficient.  \n\nOften, however, it is usefu=\r\nl to have integration tests in between.  By \ntesting clusters of collaborat=\r\ning classes, integration tests can \nfurther reduce the number of acceptance=\r\n tests needed to achieve \nreasonable coverage.  The thing integration tests=\r\n have in common with \nunit tests is that by being entirely within the syste=\r\nm boundary, they \ncan reuse much of the Java infrastructure, including JUni=\r\nt, mock \nobjects, etc.\n\nBest regards,\nLance\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, =\r\n&quot;Jan Kroeze&quot; &lt;thejcwk@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi!\n&gt; \n&gt; I think this summarises quit=\r\ne neatly what a couple of people have \nsaid,\n&gt; namely that switching to a d=\r\nedicated framework from JUnit is only \nneccessary\n&gt; if there are quite a fe=\r\nw / complicated integration tests.\n&gt; \n&gt; I happen to agree with this, since =\r\nintroducing more and more \nframeworks into\n&gt; your project just for testing =\r\nwill certainly drive many programmers \nup the\n&gt; walls. You have to be certa=\r\nin the cost is worth the pay off :) Yet,\n&gt; especially with user acceptance =\r\ntesting, I have to side with going \nwith a\n&gt; new framework, if simply for t=\r\nhe reason that the client should be \nable to\n&gt; read them.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2008/9/3 ken=\r\ntb &lt;kentb@...&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;   Jan,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; You can use JUnit for longer-running t=\r\nests, but there are some \nassumptions\n&gt; &gt; JUnit embodies that will cause so=\r\nme problems. JUnit assumes tests \nare\n&gt; &gt; atomic--they run or don&#39;t run, th=\r\ney run in unit time. Integration \ntests\n&gt; &gt; often take a long time to run, =\r\nso interim feedback is valuable. \nIntegration\n&gt; &gt; tests can usefully have m=\r\nultiple failures, where that is less \ncommon with\n&gt; &gt; unit tests. OTOH, tes=\r\nts are tests--independent self-checking bits \nof code\n&gt; &gt; that run and get =\r\nreported--and for that part of running \nintegration tests\n&gt; &gt; JUnit works f=\r\nine.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; It seems to me to be a tradeoff between the simplicity of runn=\r\ning \nall tests\n&gt; &gt; as JUnit tests and the challenges of getting the integra=\r\ntion tests \nto run\n&gt; &gt; as\n&gt; &gt; JUnit tests. Different contexts will requires=\r\n different solutions. \nIf I had\n&gt; &gt; a few integration tests, I&#39;d make them =\r\nwork with JUnit. If I had a \nlarge\n&gt; &gt; suite of integration tests that play=\r\ned a prominent role in \ndevelopment, I\n&gt; &gt; would use some other tool and in=\r\ntegrate my unit testing results \nwith the\n&gt; &gt; integration results.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nRegards,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Kent Beck\n&gt; &gt; Three Rivers Institute\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; _____\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n From: junit@yahoogroups.com &lt;junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt; [mailto:\n&gt; &gt; junit@y=\r\nahoogroups.com &lt;junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt;] On Behalf Of Jan\n&gt; &gt; Kroeze\n&gt; &gt; S=\r\nent: Tuesday, September 02, 2008 1:05 AM\n&gt; &gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com &lt;jun=\r\nit%40yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [junit] JUnit And Larger Scale Tests\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi all!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m a bit of a newb to the whole TDD thing, but I =\r\nunderstand that \nunit\n&gt; &gt; tests\n&gt; &gt; are supposed to be blazingly fast and n=\r\not access the hard drive, \nnetwork,\n&gt; &gt; database or anything external to th=\r\ne code itself. To this end, I \nunderstand\n&gt; &gt; that a framework such as jMoc=\r\nk can be used.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; So far, so good. But I find JUnit to be extremely us=\r\neful for \nwriting\n&gt; &gt; integration, system and user acceptance tests as well=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Here&#39;s my question: what is the official position of the JUnit \nc=\r\nommunity on\n&gt; &gt; using JUnit to do larger scale tests? Is there a better fra=\r\nmework, \nor is it\n&gt; &gt; common practice to use JUnit for these tests as well?=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --\n&gt; &gt; Jan Kroeze\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have =\r\nbeen removed]\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; Jan Kroeze\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of th=\r\nis message have been removed]\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n",
