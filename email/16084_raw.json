B. Rainsberger&quot; &lt;jbrains@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n Yes. But be careful: separate business logic from application logic.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nApplication logic is code you write because you are a web application \n&gt; us=\r\ning Struts.\n&gt; \n&gt; Business logic is code you write because of the business p=\r\nroblem you&#39;re \n&gt; solving.\n\nThis is a very interesting and good point to me.=\r\n I did not think about\nthings from this angle. :) \n\nAnyone else has any fur=\r\nther comments about this ?\n\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; So I would start with 1 business delega=\r\nte per action. As the business \n&gt; delegates begin to show some duplication,=\r\n I refactor them into an \n&gt; increasingly rich domain model.\n\nThis approach =\r\nsounds great to me. Keep it simple at the begining,\nrefactor it when it has=\r\n some &quot;smell&quot;. \n\n\n&gt; I like this approach, although I must say that I never =\r\nused\nStrutsTestCase.\n&gt; \n\nIf you will use Struts, what testing tool you may =\r\nuse to test Action\nrelated stuff ?\n\n\n&gt; Here&#39;s how to know it&#39;s business log=\r\nic: &quot;Would I do this even if I \n&gt; didn&#39;t have a computer?&quot; That&#39;s business =\r\nlogic. The rest is application \n&gt; logic. :)\n\nThat&#39;s pretty simple and impre=\r\nssive. hehe. \n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; English is just my second language. I am not sure whe=\r\nther I express\n&gt; &gt; myself clear enough. :(\n&gt; \n&gt; Very clearly. Which is your=\r\n first language?\n\nMy native language is Chinese. \n\nBy the way, the junit re=\r\nlated books, like &quot;Junit In Action&quot; and\n&quot;Pragmatic Unit Testing In Java Wit=\r\nh Junit&quot;, are already available in\nChina market. Do you have plan to introd=\r\nuce your book to China ? I saw\nsome messages on some BBS where Chinese java=\r\n programmers gather,\nsaying your book is &quot;the most practical junit book eve=\r\nr seen&quot;. I guess\ntranslating your book into Chinese would benefit the whole=\r\n java\ncommunity in China. :)\n\n\nCheers,\n- Frank\n\n\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
