My package <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Ah, an extreme viewpoint. I love those.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve found some value in using TestSuite to structure and order tests,<br/>\nbut we have consider replacing that with some sort of finder. I&#39;d love<br/>\nto hear positive experiences.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we created the TestSuite classes initially, we ordered the tests<br/>\nso that the more &quot;primitive&quot; classes are tested first. That way, if a<br/>\ndeveloper manages to break something badly, the first failure tends to<br/>\nbe interesting. The ordering was useful for doing some large<br/>\nrefactorings; fixing those first failures often fixed the later,<br/>\nlarger-grained tests.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve also got some platform-specific automated tests we are starting<br/>\nto write and it&#39;s useful to *not* run those on platforms other than the<br/>\nexpected one. For example, we have some code that does testing specific<br/>\nto personal Java and we&#39;ll likely be adding some that is specific to<br/>\nMIDP. So, if we use an automated test finder, it needs to have a way to<br/>\ncategorize tests and selectively include/exclude certain categories.<br/>\n<br/>\nAn alternative would be to add more CVS modules and use them to<br/>\ncategorize tests, but I think that complicates the development/build<br/>\nenvironment more than it pays in testability benefit.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards,<br/>\n<br/>\nRob<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nGet personalized email addresses from Yahoo!
