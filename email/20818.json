In<br/>\neach case, you could define an interface with two getters and pass<br/>\nthat into the method.  Your production code would have &quot;Customer<br/>\nimplements MortalityCriteria&quot; for the first scenario.  For the second<br/>\ncase, you could have the &quot;legacy&quot; method cobble together a dynamic<br/>\nimplementation, or the class could contain a private implementation<br/>\nthat it constructs only once to call the new method.  The worst<br/>\npenalty you pay is having big classes like Customer bogged down with a<br/>\nton of interfaces, but in my practice that doesn&#39;t seem to happen too<br/>\noften.<br/>\n<br/>\nFYI, I thought your initial message about the idea was clear too, so I<br/>\nmay not be your target audience.  ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Wed, Aug 27, 2008 at 3:38 PM, kentb &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kentb@...\">kentb@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; All,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In spite of the one feedback message I got that my recent post about<br/>\n&gt; abstract vs. concrete parameters was clear, I expanded the idea into a<br/>\n&gt; paper: www.threeriversinstitute.org/AbstractVsConcreteParameters.html. In<br/>\n&gt; short, it tries to resolve the apparent contradiction between achieving<br/>\n&gt; testable code sometimes by making parameters concrete and sometimes by<br/>\n&gt; making parameters abstract.
