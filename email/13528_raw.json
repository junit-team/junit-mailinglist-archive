I am not proposing an an=\r\nswer \n&gt; myself but as a learning experience I would like to see an \n&gt; examp=\r\nle of where you used something like a mock or in-memory \n&gt; database and the=\r\nn got caught out with the &quot;real thing&quot;.  \n\nEven without any specific exampl=\r\ne, it&#39;s not hard to see the risk in testing\ncode that is different from wha=\r\nt your production machines are running.  The\ncost of a false positive (test=\r\ns run but production breaks) is two-fold:\n\n- You need to fix the bug (might=\r\n be unavoidable)\n- You have to pay the price of pushing a defective product=\r\n in production\n(very high, and unacceptable in my book)\n\nDon&#39;t get me wrong=\r\n, I&#39;m not opposed to the idea of mock objects, but it\nseems to me that if y=\r\nou want to do more than unit testing with JUnit (which\nis a mistake in my o=\r\npinion), you are *forced* to use mock objects.  It&#39;s\njust the only way to s=\r\nolve this problem.\n\nMock objects are a fine solution if you have other alte=\r\nrnatives and after\nyou considered them all, mock objects came out as the be=\r\nst solution, but\nthey come at a price (well, two prices:  the one I just me=\r\nntioned and the\nfact that you need to maintain two parallel hierarchies).\n =\r\n\n&gt; I am thinking that if this happened to me it would show me \n&gt; where I sh=\r\nould write another test perhaps?  \n\nMaybe.  Or you would use the exact same=\r\n test on the real (non-mocked) code\nand the bug would show up right away.  =\r\nI know which one I prefer...\n \n&gt; For example what are things that have gone=\r\n wrong testing \n&gt; against Postgresql and then using against Oracle?  \n\nPlen=\r\nty of things can go wrong since the chain is made of so many links:\n\n1) Bug=\r\n in the database itself (more likely in Postgresql than Oracle IMO)\n2) Bug =\r\nin your code\n3) Bug in the JDBC driver (there are many to choose from in bo=\r\nths cases)\n4) Bug in how you set up your environment\n5) Bug in the mock\n\nBy=\r\n not using a mock, at least you eliminate risk 5).\n\n\n-- \nC=E9dric\nhttp://be=\r\nust.com/weblog\n\n\n\n",
