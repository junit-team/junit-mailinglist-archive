I work hardly at all\n&gt; with Mi=\r\ncrosoft APIs, but in the Java world, the open source stuff tends\n&gt; to be as=\r\n well or better documented than the proprietary stuff.\n\n\nInterestingly, I c=\r\nan&#39;t say that I work with a lot of closed-source Java\nAPI&#39;s, so I can&#39;t com=\r\nment on that either. However, I can say that I have\nseen open-source Java A=\r\nPI&#39;s that are excellent and just about as many that\nare horrendous, hence m=\r\ny disputing your argument that &quot;open source API&#39;s are\nusually better than c=\r\nlosed source ones&quot;. I&#39;m not saying one is better than\nthe other, just that =\r\nthe quality of API&#39;s seems to have nothing to do with\nwhether these API&#39;s a=\r\nre open or closed source.\n\nAs for Microsoft, I was simply pointing out that=\r\n they are excellent at\nmaintaining backward compatibility for API&#39;s. You ca=\r\nn literally run in 2005\nprograms that were written in 1995.\n\n\nSure there&#39;s =\r\na lot of poorly documented, poorly written open source\n&gt; software,\n&gt; but th=\r\nis tends to sink to the bottom and fall out of use pretty quickly.\n&gt; The li=\r\nbraries people actually use are much better documented than their\n&gt; proprie=\r\ntary equivalents. (Probably effect rather than cause, but either\n&gt; way...) =\r\nI suspect it also matters that one of the easiest ways for\n&gt; someone to con=\r\ntribute to a project is to start writing some\n&gt; documentation patches. This=\r\n means open source documentation tends to\n&gt; improve with time. Proprietary =\r\ndocumentation rarely does.\n\n\nThat I disagree with.\n\nPopularity is what brin=\r\ngs quality in documentation, and it works for closed\nand open source alike.=\r\n If a closed source software becomes popular and\ngenerates a big community,=\r\n the documentation will follow. It&#39;s no different\nthan the open source worl=\r\nd.\n\nBut we should probably stop this discussion since it&#39;s clearly off-topi=\r\nc for\nthis list.\n\n--\nC=C3=A9dric\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have =\r\nbeen removed]\n\n\n",
