This SHELL\n&gt; Script will execute server code. \n&gt; \n&gt; Could anyone help me in resolving this.\n\nSame way as you would call shell script from any Java code you can \ncall from your JUnit Tests. What are you trying to archive? May be \nyou can test classes of server code and you would not need to call \nshell? Writing Tests for all server code, may be except main(), will \nhave enough coverage to be happy.\n\n\n\n",
