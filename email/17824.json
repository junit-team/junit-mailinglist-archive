Particularly in the area of visibility.. many developers assume <br/>\n&gt; that no written agreement can be sufficient if something is made <br/>\n&gt; public.  I think that the issue is that we are not used to thinking <br/>\n&gt; about agreements beyond the code and we&#39;re not used to holding people to <br/>\n&gt; them.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;d rephrase that a little. We have decades of experience with <br/>\ndocumenting software and APIs and trying to make decrees (not agreements <br/>\nas I&#39;ll explain in another post) about how it must be used. Experience <br/>\nhas proven that this doesn&#39;t work well. Consider the issues with even a <br/>\nvery well-known code base like Java with very well known and documented <br/>\ndesign principles. How many mucked up hashCode()-equals() <br/>\nimplementations do we still encounter? Ten years ago, it was even worse. <br/>\n  And don&#39;t get me started on runtime vs. checked exceptions. Even major <br/>\nAPIs pushed through the JCP still get this exactly backwards. You need <br/>\ndocumentation, certainly, but documentation alone is not sufficient for <br/>\nrobust code.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy contrast, things that we can enforce in code do seem to work pretty <br/>\nwell. That we also have decades of experience telling us. Garbage <br/>\ncollection improves on manual memory management. Checked exceptions get <br/>\nprogrammers to write a lot more error handling code than documentation <br/>\never did. (Not quite as much as they should, of course, but a lot more <br/>\nthan they used to.) Automated unit tests (ideally run without programmer <br/>\ninvolvement on a continuous integration server) keep programmers from <br/>\nbreaking the build. Having the source code repository either verify <br/>\nformatting  or reformat code before checking it in keeps badly formatted <br/>\ncode from being checked into the source code repository.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese aren&#39;t absolutes. They are matters of degree. But they are large <br/>\nmatters of degree. We know these things. We&#39;ve learned them through <br/>\nexperience. Rules we enforce in code and systems are far more likely to <br/>\nbe followed than rules we merely document.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n﻿Elliotte Rusty Harold  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:elharo@...\">elharo@...</a><br/>\nJava I/O 2nd Edition Just Published!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafeaulait.org/books/javaio2/\">http://www.cafeaulait.org/books/javaio2/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596527500/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/\">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596527500/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/</a></div>",
