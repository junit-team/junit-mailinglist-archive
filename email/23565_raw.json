Typically, assertio=\r\nns performed from outside the context of the main test thread are meaningle=\r\nss since any failures/exceptions that occur go unnoticed by the main test t=\r\nhread. \n\nThe solution involves setting up some shared state where failures =\r\nare reported back to the main thread, then thrown, so that tests either pas=\r\ns or fail as expected. To make this a bit easier I created a simple JUnit e=\r\nxtension, called ConcurrentUnit, which I wanted to share with the group: \n\n=\r\nhttps://github.com/jhalterman/concurrentunit \n\nFeedback is welcome and I ho=\r\npe that this is of some use to other JUnit users. \n\nCheers, \nJonathan \n\n\n",
