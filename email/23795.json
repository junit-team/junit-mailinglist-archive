    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1460323273\">I&#39;m already working on something like that. I&#39;m writing a new test <br/>\nrunner called Jumi <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://jumi.fi/\">http://jumi.fi/</a> which will have native support for <br/>\nrunning tests in parallel in the same JVM, and it take care of capturing <br/>\nthe System.out/err of individual tests.<br/>\n<br/>\nJumi will do the output capturing by replacing System.out/err with its <br/>\nown implementation, which saves all print events (the same way it saves <br/>\ntest lifecycle events), synchronizes both out and err (I think all <br/>\ncurrent IDEs and build tools fail this: <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/orfjackal/misc-tools/blob/master/src/test/java/net/orfjackal/bugs/SystemOutErrBugTest.java)\">https://github.com/orfjackal/misc-tools/blob/master/src/test/java/net/orfjackal/bugs/SystemOutErrBugTest.java)</a>, <br/>\nand also takes care of capturing the output of threads spawned by the <br/>\ntest thread. For long-lived threads, such as AWT event dispatch thread, <br/>\nI will also try to figure out something (I&#39;ll timestamp all print <br/>\nevents, so it should be possible to figure out roughly which test <br/>\nprinted things in the AWT thread).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe output capturing is at the top of my TODO list, so I will have it <br/>\nimplemented after a couple of productive afternoons when I have time to <br/>\nwork on it. Soon after that I&#39;ll make the first alpha release.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve looked a bit at how to integrate Jumi with maven-surefire. Jumi and <br/>\nSurefire have some overlap, for example both of them take care of <br/>\nclassloading and starting a JVM process. One option is to use Surefire&#39;s <br/>\nclassloading and use only the core runner parts of Jumi. Otherwise Jumi <br/>\nwould need information that what are the dependency JARs, what are the <br/>\ncurrent project&#39;s classes, maybe also that which of them are test and <br/>\nproduction classes (Jumi will do caching of the dependencies&#39; class <br/>\nloaders to speed up the tests). That would require changes to Surefire, <br/>\nor then a completely new Maven plugin.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kristian@...\">kristian@...</a> wrote on 4.1.2012 8:51:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Sorry, I was doing just what I sometimes dislike of our own users ;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The real problem I want to solve is associating console output from a<br/>\n&gt; running thread to a given test-case (for parallel runs). We have this<br/>\n&gt; fairly well covered already and we manage to capture everything that<br/>\n&gt; happens within a given test-case for that test-case.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The real problem is that the RunListener API does not demarcate<br/>\n&gt; test-classes properly, so I am unable to distinguish console output<br/>\n&gt; happening in @AfterClass of one test with @BeforeClass on the test-class<br/>\n&gt; on the same thread.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This problem has been in the corner of my eye for quite some time and<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve been trying to find a decent angle to solve it from. I promise not<br/>\n&gt; to do anything that is frowned upon, which is why I asked ;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Kristian<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>-- <br/>\nEsko Luontola<br/>\nwww.orfjackal.net</div>",
