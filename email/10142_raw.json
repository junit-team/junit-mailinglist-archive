Checks to see if this action\n&gt; .     * is assignment-compatbile with the action class mapped in \n&gt; .     * struts-config.\n&gt; .     */\n&gt; .    protected void setAction(Action other) {\n&gt; .        String theActionPath = (String) getField(&quot;actionPath&quot;);\n&gt; .        theRequestProcessor.setOverrideAction(other, theActionPath);\n&gt; .    }\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; This turns out to be very useful in a variety of situations.  I can \n&gt; subclass the Actions under test to override certain methods, etc.  \n&gt; \n&gt; We also use this subclass to disable/enable the struts auto-\n&gt; validation of form beans.  Sometimes you just want to test the action \n&gt; processing without worrying about if the form is valid or not.  \n&gt; \n&gt; I would be happy to send you the code if you think this would be \n&gt; useful.\n&gt; \n&gt; Jeff Nielsen\n&gt; Digital Focus\n&gt; www.digitalfocus.com\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In junit@yahoogroups.com, Bryce Fischer &lt;bryce@b...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve posted a similar question on the Struts list, but maybe its \n&gt; more\n&gt; &gt; appropriate for this list.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m trying to determine the best way to test my Struts Actions. I&#39;ve\n&gt; &gt; come across 2 projects that look interested.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1. StrutsTestCase (http://strutstestcase.sourceforge.net/)\n&gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; 2. Mockrunner (http://mockrunner.sourceforge.net/)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I like the simplicity of StrutsTestCase. I&#39;m using a delegate in my\n&gt; &gt; Action case, and would like to use a MockObject in place of the \n&gt; delegate\n&gt; &gt; class. This way I could simulate exceptions, etc...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Unfortunately, I have been unable to devise a method to tell my \n&gt; Action\n&gt; &gt; object what delegate class I&#39;d like to use. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; One idea would be to put the delegate class in the request \n&gt; parameter.\n&gt; &gt; This would be easy to do in StrutsTestCase, but I&#39;m not sure how \n&gt; this\n&gt; &gt; would work in a Live system. How would I get the delegate class \n&gt; into the\n&gt; &gt; request?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Any other suggestions?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; -- \n&gt; &gt; Bryce Fischer &lt;bryce@b...&gt;\n&gt; \n\n-- \nBryce Fischer &lt;bryce@...&gt;\n\n\n",
