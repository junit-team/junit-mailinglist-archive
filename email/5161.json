I&#39;ve been developing GUIs on a number of platforms for years, <br/>\nand I thought I was only doing very basic tool-oriented tasks, but I&#39;ve <br/>\nnever done a gui that reduces to a single component with a single <br/>\nmessage.  Maybe I just don&#39;t establish the proper concepts in the gui, <br/>\nbut I invariably have several things interacting.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, the right message gets sent to the Dialog, but the Dialog still <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t show up.  Now what?  In my experience, the design space between <br/>\ntwo components is where I find the most bugs; it&#39;s rarely either one or <br/>\nthe other but usually the interaction of the two that causes the problem <br/>\nor unexpected behavior.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Tuesday, June 11, 2002, at 09:36 AM, Bob Koss wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; On 6/11/02 7:28 AM, &quot;Michael Silverstein&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:msilverstein@...\">msilverstein@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Bob Koss [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:koss@...\">koss@...</a>] wrote:<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; But if we use Mediator to decouple the gui controls, we may as<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; well delegate<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; everything to the Mediator and leave the gui stupid. The Mediator can <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; be<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; unit tested just like any other class, and doesn&#39;t need the gui since <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; all<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; communication is done through interfaces.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; That notwithstanding, you still need to test the connection between the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; mediator and your GUI. There&#39;s still plenty of room for error there.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m trying to understand your concern. I can test that the Mediator <br/>\n&gt; send the<br/>\n&gt; right message with the right parameters at the right time. The code in <br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; gui (let&#39;s say a Dialog box just to be concrete) that responds to this<br/>\n&gt; message is one or two lines of code which IMO, can&#39;t break.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Can you show me in a few lines of code where there is room for error <br/>\n&gt; between<br/>\n&gt; the Mediator and the gui/dialog/whatever?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; Robert Koss, Ph.D.     | Training, Mentoring, Contract Development<br/>\n&gt; Senior Consultant      | Object Oriented Design, C++, Java<br/>\n&gt; www.objectmentor.com   | Extreme Programming<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
