This is of course allowed and\nencouraged, but if you&#39;re not using the JUnit 4 functionality, running\nthe test case in JUnit 3 might be a good temporary workaround for the\nsituation.  Thanks,\n\n   David Saff\n\nOn 2/12/07, Mike McAfee &lt;memcafee@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I am using Eclipse 3.2.1 and JUnit 4.1.  I would like to run a single test\n&gt; that exists in a test case.  A co-worker of mine is using Eclipse 3.1.2 and\n&gt; is able to successfully do this.  Eclipse 3.2.1 acts and displays results as\n&gt; though one test was run.  However, console output reveals that all tests in\n&gt; the TestCase class are being run.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I put together a simple test class and ran it the same way I have done with\n&gt; the large test package.  I encounter the same results.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Here is the test class that I have put together:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; package test;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; import junit.framework.TestCase;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; public class Test extends TestCase\n&gt;\n&gt; {\n&gt;\n&gt;       public void testOne(){\n&gt;\n&gt;             int a = 1, b =0;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;             System.out.println(&quot;testOne:&quot; + (a+b));\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;             assertEquals(1, a+b);\n&gt;\n&gt;       }\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;       public void testTwo(){\n&gt;\n&gt;             int a = 1, b =1;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;             System.out.println(&quot;testTwo:&quot; + (a+b));\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;             assertEquals(2, a+b);\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;       }\n&gt;\n&gt; }\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I have right-clicked on the testOne() method and selected Run As-&gt;JUnit\n&gt; Test.  The JUnit view shows one run for testOne.  However, the console\n&gt; output is:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; testOne:1\n&gt;\n&gt; testTwo:2\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Can anyone offer insight as to why this is occurring?  Is this something an\n&gt; Eclipse bug that should be reported?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Thank you,\n&gt;\n&gt; Mike\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
