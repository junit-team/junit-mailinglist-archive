It was \njust \n&gt; too fragile, and every time=\r\n I set things up I got that annoying \nerror \n&gt; about the classpath, which s=\r\neems to be saying &quot;it is your fault, \nand \n&gt; you&#39;re an idiot, so don&#39;t both=\r\ner us&quot;. Once I made my own test \nsuite as \n&gt; a static instance, managed the=\r\n TestResult object myself and added \na \n&gt; TestListener instance, a whole bu=\r\nnch of this stuff became much, \nmuch \n&gt; easier.\n&gt; \n&gt; Including this.\n&gt; \n&gt; T=\r\nhe TestListener instance has access to every test as it is run. \nSo, at \n&gt; =\r\nthat point, you can have something you log, however much of it you \n&gt; want.=\r\n One can even have an external source of information at that \n&gt; point. We h=\r\nave a database of our tests and I can query that in the \n&gt; TestListener and=\r\n annotate the results with whatever stuff I want.\n&gt; \n&gt; I frankly do not kno=\r\nw whether junitreport can do these things. But \nit \n&gt; just puts out html. I=\r\n can do that well enough myself, once i have \nthe \n&gt; information.\n&gt; \n&gt; - ra=\r\ny\n&gt; \n&gt; On Aug 16, 2004, at 9:44 AM, valerie_abelin wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m using =\r\nAnt to run junit and junitreport.=A0 I like the HTML \noutput\n&gt; &gt;  that juni=\r\ntreport generates, but I am wondering if it is \npossible to\n&gt; &gt;  include mo=\r\nre javadoc/comments in the output rather than just the\n&gt; &gt;  success/failure=\r\n status and time the test took to run.=A0 It would \nbe\n&gt; &gt;  great if junitr=\r\neport could include a comment from the source \ncode\n&gt; &gt;  about what each te=\r\nst means.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been =\r\nremoved]\n\n\n\n\n\n",
