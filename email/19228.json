And then setUp() is run immediately before each test<br/>\n&gt; method is executed.  That&#39;s with JUnit 3.8.  I can&#39;t speak for version 4<br/>\n&gt; as we haven&#39;t switched yet.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>For JUnit 3.8, that&#39;s correct.  Also, exceptions thrown from the constructor<br/>\nwill prevent the individual test method from being reported, while<br/>\nexceptions thrown from setUp() are treated as test errors.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn JUnit 4, the differences are more subtle.  Test objects are constructed<br/>\nright before execution, and exceptions thrown from constructors are handled<br/>\nmore gracefully, so you can choose based on style.  I usually put<br/>\ninitialization into field declarations or the constructor, unless I want to<br/>\nshow that a particular uninitialization sequence is paired with a particular<br/>\ninitialization sequence, in which case I&#39;ll use a paired @Before and @After<br/>\n(the JUnit 4 version of setUp and tearDown).<br/>\n<br/>\n   David Saff<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
