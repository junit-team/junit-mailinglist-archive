At no costs I want to manually<br/>\n&gt;exclude the test classes during shipment. Addiditonally I simply find<br/>\n&gt;this approach more structured - in our last project we had for each<br/>\n&gt;package a .test package.<br/>\n&gt;The separate package however has the main drawback for me that I cant<br/>\n&gt;test package private methods. This forces me to make more methods<br/>\n&gt;public than I want just for testing purposes.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;What are your experiences and preferences in this area ?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I have them in the same package, and use ant to exclude them when I do a <br/>\nfull build.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis does force you to use a consistent naming scheme for the classes, but <br/>\nI don&#39;t find that to be too much of a problem.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\n<br/>\n                           *   Jim Cheesman   *<br/>\n             Trabajo: <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jchees@...\">jchees@...</a> - (34)(91) 724 9200 x 2360<br/>\n  In retrospect it becomes clear <br/>\nthat hindsight is definitely overrated</div>",
