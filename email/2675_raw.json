It was a\nfeature I needed when I first started working with JUnit.\n\nMultiple Failures in a Singular Test &lt;\nhttp://www.gnufoo.org/junit/index.html#failures &gt;\n\nThere has been a lot of discussion on the JUnit mailing list about allowing\nmultiple failures in a test. Some people insist that with the right amount\nof refactoring there should be no need to introduce this flexibility. I,\nhowever, found this wasn&#39;t the case. This restriction hampered my testing,\nas I had to reflect more upon the framework than my tests themselves. Being\nforced to choose between having only one assert per test which provided more\ninformation, rather than the more logical aggregations of asserts which\nprovided less information. \n\nThe change isn&#39;t radical by any means. It simply allows your tests to have\nmultiple failures attributed to them. Which means if you&#39;re say comparing a\ncollection of values, you get a report back of all the elements that didn&#39;t\nmatch, not just the first one that caused an AssertionFailureError to be\nthrown. \n\nI&#39;ve put together a patch &lt; http://www.gnufoo.org/junit/junit3.7a.patch &gt;\nagainst the 3.7 sources that you can apply. Or you can simply use this\njunit3.7a.jar &lt; http://www.gnufoo.org/junit/junit3.7a.jar &gt; (source is\nincluded in the jar). \n\nThe test I added to SimpleTest looks like this: \n\n    public void testMultipleFailures() {\n        fail(&quot;failing once&quot;);\n        fail(&quot;failing twice&quot;);\n        fail(&quot;failing once, again&quot;);\n    }\n\nRunning test runner presents the results as follows (stack traces have been\nremoved for sake of brevity): \n\n$ java -classpath junit3.7a.jar junit.textui.TestRunner\njunit.samples.SimpleTest\n.F.E.FF.FFF\nTime: 0.034\nThere was 1 error:\n1) testDivideByZero(junit.samples.SimpleTest)java.lang.ArithmeticException:\n/ by zero\nThere were 3 failures:\n1) testAdd(junit.samples.SimpleTest)junit.framework.AssertionFailedError\n2) testEquals(junit.samples.SimpleTest)junit.framework.AssertionFailedError:\nSize expected:&lt;12&gt; but was:&lt;13&gt;\n3) testEquals(junit.samples.SimpleTest)junit.framework.AssertionFailedError:\nCapacity expected:&lt;12.0&gt; but was:&lt;11.99&gt;\n4)\ntestMultipleFailures(junit.samples.SimpleTest)junit.framework.AssertionFaile\ndError: failing once\n5)\ntestMultipleFailures(junit.samples.SimpleTest)junit.framework.AssertionFaile\ndError: failing twice\n6)\ntestMultipleFailures(junit.samples.SimpleTest)junit.framework.AssertionFaile\ndError: failing once, again\n\nFAILURES!!!\nTests run: 4,  Failures: 3,  Errors: 1\n\n\nThe Swing and AWT TestRunner should work fine as well. The only\ninconsistency that this has introduced is the listing of failures may exceed\nthe number of failed tests displayed on the status line, which is slightly\nconfusing since they&#39;ve typically had a one to one correspondence until now.\n\n\n-shane (at) terraspring.com \n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Laurent Duperval [mailto:lduperval@...]\nSent: Monday, September 17, 2001 5:50 AM\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: Re: [junit] Proper use of TestReult\n\n\nOn 14 Sep, Vladimir Bossicard wrote:\n&gt; One thing you have to understand is that when a assertion failed, the\n&gt; method is exited because an Error is thrown.  There is no way to avoid\n&gt; this unless you write your own JUnit app.  I don&#39;t think that it&#39;s what\n&gt; you want...\n&gt; \n\nRight.\n\n&gt; if you have 3 mendatory fields, you write 4 methods.  The first 3 test\n&gt; that you successfully see when fields are missing and the 4th to see if\n&gt; everything&#39;s fine when you have your 3 mendatory fields.  You have done\n&gt; quite the same thing (removing one field after another) but my approach is\n&gt; more simple.\n&gt; \n&gt; Remember: &quot;keep tests simple&quot;.  The more complicated the test code is, the\n&gt; more likely you introduce errors in the test code.  The goal of unit\n&gt; testing is not to debug your test code :-)\n&gt; \n\nMy problem with the 4 tests approach is that if for some reason the public\nAPI\nfor the tests change, I have to change n+1 test methods. Whereas if I\ncontain\neverything in a single test (as I&#39;m doing now) I only have to change it once\nwhen the public API changes (and yes, it has happened).\n\n&gt; to implement the simpliest tests possible:\n&gt; \n&gt; - use the setUp() method to create your data object\n&gt; - create 4 tests methods (in my example it&#39;s 4)\n&gt; - remove one single mendatory field at the beginning of each test method\n&gt; - call the fail() method to tell JUnit that something wrong happend\n&gt; \n\nI&#39;m just trying to concentrate all that in one test because I find\nCut&#39;n&#39;Paste to be error prone. In our case, we test data that has 12 or 14\nmandatory fields and 3 or 4 optional. Repeating the exact same code 18 times\nscreams REFACTORING! And to me a proper refactoring of such identical tests\nis\nto put it all in one method. I&#39;m just looking for a friendly way to show 8\nfailures if 8 of the test cases fail. So far, the best I&#39;ve come up with is\nto create a string with all the names of the fields that have failed and\nprint\nthem in the fail() call. But it&#39;s not very appealing visually.\n\nL\n\n-- \nLaurent Duperval &lt;mailto:lduperval@...&gt;\n\nBref. L&#39;affreuse d�ception pour mes auditeurs. Les malheureux. Sevr�s du\nsuc de ma pens�e. Soyons brave.\n                                             -Achille Talon\n\n\n\n\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\njunit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n \n\nYour use of Yahoo!
