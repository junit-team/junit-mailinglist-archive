    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1174802891\">It is a weaker definition of formally validated where each system is <br/>\nconsidered separately.  Minimally, the app must have requirements <br/>\ndoc signed by user&#39;s/vendor, traceability to design documents from <br/>\nrequirements, traceability from requirements to unit, system and <br/>\nuser acceptance tests, plus a varitey of additional higher level <br/>\nvalidation strategy and test plan documents.  Usually the <br/>\ntraceability is shown as a traceability matrix. The evidence of all <br/>\nthe tests and dev processes must be archived, signed, etc. This is <br/>\nmostly just standard good software development practice but ideally <br/>\nI need all these elements for junit to make the QA police <br/>\ncomfortable.  Their great fear is an FDA auditor shows up and asks <br/>\nfor these artifacts for every system used by whatever they are <br/>\nauditing (such audits are semi-regular events).  Vendor products, <br/>\ne.g., commercial test tools, have their software process and <br/>\nartifacts audited by the company QA department.<br/>\n <br/>\nNo auditor could follow the CVS commits as a traceability matrix.  <br/>\nWhat doc do you consider the standard users manual?  The articles <br/>\nlike the Cookbook don&#39;t cover all the features so they aren&#39;t easy <br/>\nto use as the basis of traceability.  I&#39;d probably need to use the <br/>\nCooks Tour as the design document but I don&#39;t think it covers <br/>\neverything.<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, Robert Wenner &lt;robert.wenner@...&gt; <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; So our <br/>\n&gt; &gt; customers sometimes don&#39;t want us to use an open source tool like<br/>\n&gt; &gt; junit because it isn&#39;t formally validated, <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Makes me curious: what tool is formally validated?<br/>\n&gt; Can it even be formally validated without the underlying OS being <br/>\n </span></blockquote>formally <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; validated?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; e.g., doesn&#39;t have written requirements, <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Give them the user&#39;s manual as requirements design document?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; traceable to design, traceable to unit and system tests,  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Requirements to design tracing: You may be able to pull that from <br/>\n </span></blockquote>the CVS <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; or Subverson history, if the commits happened in small step.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; with the output of the tests captured.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Run the test with ant and the testreport task. <br/>\n&gt; Commit the output to the repository to show them the history of <br/>\n </span></blockquote>succeeding <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; tests.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Any suggestions for how to <br/>\n&gt; &gt; address this other than telling them that junit is so <br/>\n </span></blockquote>extensively used<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; it must work, e.g., is there a suite of junit acceptance tests <br/>\n </span></blockquote>or even<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; unit tests that we can run to prove that it works according to <br/>\n </span></blockquote>its<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; specs?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;d ask for the test documentation for one of the formally <br/>\n </span></blockquote>validated <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; tools.
