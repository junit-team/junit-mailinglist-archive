Except for the<br/>\n&gt; message (which is probably not a good idea since you need to plan for<br/>\n&gt; internationalization), there is not much in that object, unless you make<br/>\n&gt; heavy use of your own exceptions (not a very common occurrence in my<br/>\n&gt; experience).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Indeed. I used to do that a lot, but now I don&#39;t. I think I found that <br/>\nall those custom exception classes weren&#39;t worth the effort.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
