For Perl they can be at run-time (since Perl gets compiled\ninto bytecode at runtime) or at &quot;compile time&quot; (for the case of\nmodules that are pre-compiled to bytecode, then seralized as bytecode\nto disk for later loading, but this is rare).  For Java dependency\nchecking can be at compile-time or at runtime.  For Java runtime\ndependency checking an happen automatically, or when there is an\nexplicit call to ClassLoader.loadClass(String).\n\nI am not able to access youtube from work because of our firewall, so\nI may be missing some of what you are trying to convey.\n\nThe specific case I am trying to understand is unit tests for code\nwhere I have the source, so I am more interested in the compile time\nuse case.  If I am working with existing code, and I don&#39;t want to\nmake changes to the code just to test, I am not sure how polymorphism\nhelps me - either I use the class that my class-under-test depends on\nfrom my existing code base, or I don&#39;t.  If I don&#39;t, I can create a\nclass in my project with the same name and packagename, or I can\nsubclass that class, but using a subclass is a code change, and I only\nwant to test the existing code, not change it just to test it.  I can\npass subclasses of needed classes as arguments to the methods of my\nclass-under-test, but again to sub-class I either need to pull in the\nexisting class or I don&#39;t, and if I am to unit test just one class -\nwell I don&#39;t want to pull in anything I can avoid pulling in.\n\nPerhaps you are suggesting that I refactor for testability - which is\nan option, but not the usecase I am trying to understand.\n\njavac will throw an error if I have an import statement and the class\nto import is not there at compiletime.\njava will throw an exception at runtime if I have a class that\ncompiled fine because the class was there at compile-time, but it is\nnot in the classpath now.  In either case I can provide the original\nclass or a class that simply has the same name and the same interface.\n I don&#39;t have to provide the entire interface, only the bits that are\nused by my class-under-test.\n\nMy usecase can easily expand to 2 classes-under-test or 3 or 5 or 7,\nbut I wanted to understand the 1-class usecase first.  I don&#39;t want to\nhave to pull in then entire 50000 class project just to test one\nclass.\n\nThe following pages (see below) describe part of what I am talking\nabout with subversion and eclipse, but I was hoping to get a compare\nand contrast of different IDEs, and how junit fits in specifically.\n\nI am a developer, this is how I develop, how is this supported by my\nIntegrated Development Environment (or isn&#39;t).\n\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/122107/checkout-one-file-from-subversion\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/3631465/how-to-use-svn-export-command\nhttp://www.stanford.edu/class/cs108/JavaTools/eclipse-guide/\nhttp://help.eclipse.org/juno/topic/org.eclipse.platform.doc.user/tasks/tasks-45.htm\nhttp://www.avajava.com/tutorials/lessons/how-do-i-link-to-my-settings-xml-file-from-eclipse.html\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/1904763/how-to-add-a-second-source-directory-to-an-eclipse-project\n\n\n\n&gt; Are you perhaps coming from a background of working with languages where\n&gt; the primary type of Seams (see Working Effectively With Legacy Code) is\n&gt; Preprocessor Seam or Link Seam? For example C.\n&gt;\n&gt; In Java and many other languages we have Object Seams (e.g.\n&gt; polymorphism), which are much easier to use than Link Seams (in Java\n&gt; Link Seams are used very rarely - notably in the SLF4J library). And by\n&gt; using the right patterns the dependencies can be made explicit and\n&gt; configurable:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://misko.hevery.com/2008/11/11/clean-code-talks-dependency-injection/\n&gt; http://misko.hevery.com/2008/11/21/clean-code-talks-global-state-and-singletons/\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt; Esko Luontola\n&gt; www.orfjackal.net\n&gt;\n\n",
