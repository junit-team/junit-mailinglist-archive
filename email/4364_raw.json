Thus the only public methods I want\n&gt;     jon-s&gt; to see is read(file) and execute() throws\n&gt;     jon-s&gt; TestFailException.\n&gt; \n&gt;     jon-s&gt; Now, do you think that a sufficient test is to supply some\n&gt;     jon-s&gt; working and non-working test spec examples a see if the\n&gt;     jon-s&gt; right ones fail? Of course not.\n&gt; \n&gt;     jon-s&gt; In fact, such examples are common in applications which\n&gt;     jon-s&gt; contain more complex functionality than data shuffling, and\n&gt;     jon-s&gt; the notion than testing public methods is sufficient is\n&gt;     jon-s&gt; just plain wrong. Consider simulators, rule engines,\n&gt;     jon-s&gt; planners etc.\n&gt; \n&gt;     jon-s&gt; Btw, I don&#39;t like to have my unit tests in the same\n&gt;     jon-s&gt; package, but I don&#39;t like the alternative either. What we\n&gt;     jon-s&gt; need is a friend construct. Tests commonly needs a backdoor\n&gt;     jon-s&gt; to classes, and so does parsistence layers. There is a\n&gt;     jon-s&gt; diference between the system level and business level\n&gt;     jon-s&gt; interface of classes.\n&gt; \n&gt;     jon-s&gt; -- Jon S Bratseth, Zenior AS\n&gt; \n&gt;     &gt;&gt; -----Opprinnelig melding----- Fra: Miles, Eric SAXONHQ\n&gt;     &gt;&gt; [mailto:milese@...] Sendt: 14. mars 2002 23:35 Til:\n&gt;     &gt;&gt; &#39;junit@yahoogroups.com&#39; Emne: RE: [junit] Where to place test\n&gt;     &gt;&gt; classes?\n&gt;     &gt;&gt; \n&gt;     &gt;&gt; \n&gt;     &gt;&gt; I&#39;d have to agree with Mr. Rainsberger.  I see no need to test\n&gt;     &gt;&gt; methods other than public.  My reasoning is public method types\n&gt;     &gt;&gt; are what&#39;s exposed to the public, therefore, test them well.\n&gt;     &gt;&gt; If the class is primary used via inheritance, I&#39;ll write test\n&gt;     &gt;&gt; methods for the protected methods as well.  Otherwise, I don&#39;t\n&gt;     &gt;&gt; bother with private method types.  They&#39;re indirectly tested\n&gt;     &gt;&gt; through the methods they support.\n&gt;     &gt;&gt; \n&gt;     &gt;&gt; \n&gt;     &gt;&gt; -----Original Message----- From: J. B. Rainsberger\n&gt;     &gt;&gt; [mailto:jbr@...] Sent: Thursday, March 14, 2002\n&gt;     &gt;&gt; 5:20 PM To: junit@yahoogroups.com Subject: Re: [junit] Where to\n&gt;     &gt;&gt; place test classes?\n&gt;     &gt;&gt; \n&gt;     &gt;&gt; \n&gt;     &gt;&gt; &gt;Another purpose for using JUnit is to create tests &gt;first and\n&gt;     &gt;&gt; then write code.  For those that take this &gt;approach to\n&gt;     &gt;&gt; development, they would probably want a &gt;test for each method.\n&gt;     &gt;&gt; \n&gt;     &gt;&gt; I&#39;m sorry to be blunt, but absolutely not.\n&gt;     &gt;&gt; \n&gt;     &gt;&gt; In TFP, the goal is to test every feature -- that is, every bit\n&gt;     &gt;&gt; of behavior you care about. Implementation details are\n&gt;     &gt;&gt; unimportant and, in fact, testing\n&gt;     &gt;&gt; \n&gt;     &gt;&gt; them on their own often impedes refactoring. Since tests are\n&gt;     &gt;&gt; meant to provide the &quot;safety net&quot; during refactoring, they\n&gt;     &gt;&gt; should try not to get in the way of refactoring, if they can\n&gt;     &gt;&gt; avoid it.\n&gt;     &gt;&gt; \n&gt;     &gt;&gt; If you have one feature that uses four or five private methods\n&gt;     &gt;&gt; behind a single public method, then it&#39;s best simply to test\n&gt;     &gt;&gt; the public method. If you find a bug in there, then that may be\n&gt;     &gt;&gt; a clue about your design: perhaps what you perceive as an\n&gt;     &gt;&gt; implementation detail is something bigger that should be in its\n&gt;     &gt;&gt; own class. At that point, the method becomes public and voila,\n&gt;     &gt;&gt; you can test it. (Or package-level, if you prefer that route\n&gt;     &gt;&gt; and place your tests in the same package as the production\n&gt;     &gt;&gt; code.)\n&gt;     &gt;&gt; \n&gt;     &gt;&gt; &quot;A test for each method&quot; is a bad thing. &quot;Tests for each\n&gt;     &gt;&gt; feature or service&quot;\n&gt;     &gt;&gt; \n&gt;     &gt;&gt; is a Good Thing.\n&gt;     &gt;&gt; \n&gt;     &gt;&gt; J.
