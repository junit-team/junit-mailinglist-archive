For us, they are also relatively rare circumstances, and\nthat makes us wary of spending too much effort on this testing.\n\n &gt; NEXT WEEK, I think I&#39;m goint go write a simple html parsing tool,\n &gt; that writes the java test code for me, so I can cut and paste it\n &gt; into my code, and adapt it.\n\nI&#39;m really hoping someone has done this already and we can buy or\ndownload this tool!\n\nOur QA manager was telling me today that she can record Silk Test\nscripts in &quot;no time,&quot; and then we have the web tests available.  If\nthey are being recorded, then we don&#39;t have the test-first thing\ngoing on, but she said they could at least script the manual test\nprior to the iteration so we can use it to develop against.  Like\nany web tests, especially with JSPs that have to be generated by the\nserver, they take a bit too much time to run to be used as part of\nthe developers check-in routine.  We probably want to run these as\npart of a daily or twice daily automated build verification test.\n\nThanks for your comments,\n-Paul Hodgetts\n\n\n",
