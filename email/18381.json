From what you<br/>\nwant to do it seems like fit/fitnesse is more apropriate (maintaining test<br/>\nsuites of testdata that can be repededly executed and verified).<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course your develpers really should do unit testing to prevent &quot;bugs&quot;<br/>\nfrom entering the code in the first place.<br/>\nIn short the process is that acceptance tests are written in fitnesse and<br/>\nfixtures to run those tests are implemented by developers.<br/>\nIn order to realize those demands in code the developers use JUnit to<br/>\ndiscover and test the units required to implement those demands.<br/>\nWhen the fitnessetests pass the developers are done :) The idea is to have<br/>\nself verifying demands as much as possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nfitnesse: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.fitnesse.org\">http://www.fitnesse.org</a> there is a demo there that you can try out<br/>\nto see if that would work for you.<br/>\nI&#39;ve heard of teams that use only JUnit, in those teams it is still the<br/>\ndevelopers writing the tests in colaboration with the customer/QA.<br/>\nI guess you can make anything work with communication; the opposite is also<br/>\ntrue.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope thie helps,<br/>\n/ Joakim Ohlrogge<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 11/19/06, friends4ever_8in &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:friends4ever_8in@...\">friends4ever_8in@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Hi all,<br/>\n&gt; I am a new member to join the grp.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I needed some help. Please suggest something in this regard.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have always been in testing and that too functinality/manual<br/>\n&gt; testing. So I was never involved in deveopment or automated testing.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But these days, talks are going on in our project to automate some of<br/>\n&gt; our testing tasks. For this they want to use Junit as the main testing<br/>\n&gt; tool. But also, we want to have a GUI, through which test data can be<br/>\n&gt; entered or the other option being, maintaining the test data in an xml<br/>\n&gt; file and then automating the process of extracting values from that<br/>\n&gt; file and using those values in test cases which can be run<br/>\n&gt; continuously one after the another, each time taking a different set<br/>\n&gt; of value from the file.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Also, the result of the test case should be communicated back to the<br/>\n&gt; tester.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Please suggest how this can be achieved and what sort of<br/>\n&gt; framework/design should be used for this test suite.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Will be waiting for response from all the members of the group.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>",
