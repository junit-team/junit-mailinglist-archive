This involves a number of differences from what\nthe standard Junit methodology would suggest. It&#39;s important to understand\nthat the modifications I&#39;ve made aren&#39;t necessarily applicable to everyone\nwho&#39;s doing unit testing, but for those of you out there who feel that\nsometimes Junit gets in the way of doing other sorts of testing this may\nhelp. For anyone stricly doing unit testing and that relies on their suites\nbeing dynamically generated by the testrunner, these refinements probably\nwon&#39;t be of any use to you.\n\nFor instance, a lot of the information my tests require isn&#39;t available\nuntil the test is run or is generated during runtime and needs to be passed\nbetween the tests. Fixtures are not really applicable to this sort of\ntesting. Another thing that began to happen was I started mangling my own\ntest method names in a sort of ad hoc way of passing arguments to the tests.\nTo try and fix these two situations, I&#39;ve made the following extensions to\nJunit. \n\n* One test object for a series of tests (rather than the standard one test\ninstance per test) \n* Call test methods with arguments \n\nFor me this makes the feel of Junit much more natural. It also provides\ncompile time checks that wouldn&#39;t normally happen until runtime. This is\nmade possible by Proxies for classes ( http://www.gnufoo.org/jcfe/index.html\n). \n\nThese two pieces of code should illustrate the difference. Old Style: \n\nTestSuite suite = new TestSuite();\nsuite.add(new TestTest(&quot;testPassed&quot;));\nsuite.add(new TestTest(&quot;testFailed&quot;));\nsuite.add(new TestTest(&quot;testErrored&quot;));\n// can&#39;t do this with the current TestCase in Junit\n// suite.add(new TestTest(&quot;testArgs&quot;, new Object[] { &quot;ugly&quot; }));\nreturn suite;\n\nNew Style: \n\nProxyTestSuite suite = new ProxyTestSuite();\n//suite.oneTestInstancePerTest(false);\nTestTest tc = (TestTest) suite.getTestProxy(new TestTest());\ntc.testPassed();\ntc.testFailed();\ntc.testErrored();\n// TestProxies can accept arguments\n// tc.testArgs(&quot;pretty&quot;);\nreturn suite;\n\nThese two pieces of code are effectively the same (neglecting the commented\nout testlet that accepts arguments), except one is cleaner, easier to read\nin my opinion, and has more checks that happen at compile time. Also the new\nstyle allows for one to optionally choose between one test instance per test\n(default) or one test instance for all tests of that type. \n\nThe source is available at http://www.gnufoo.org/junit/index.html The\ncontent of which is basically copied in this email.  The dynamic proxies of\nclasses might be useful for creating mock objects that don&#39;t conform to an\ninterface as well.  \n\n-shane \n\n",
