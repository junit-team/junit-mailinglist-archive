If any<br/>\nassertion of the decorated test doesn&#39;t hold true under load, then the load test will fail.  This may help validate whether the<br/>\nlocks are being properly acquired and released by multiple threads, without causing a deadlock.<br/>\n<br/>\nJUnitPerf is available at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.clarkware.com/software/JUnitPerf.html.\">http://www.clarkware.com/software/JUnitPerf.html.</a><br/>\n<br/>\nMike</div>",
