However I am still not convinced how<br/>\n&gt; would one apply these in large systems.  In particular, in compilers and<br/>\nrelated topics.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; A concrete instance would be an analysis that works on say some IR. The<br/>\nanalysis can usually be cast as a single class and the<br/>\n&gt; test of the &quot;unit&quot; is that each of the methods function as specified in<br/>\nthe given scenarios.  The analysis works on the<br/>\n&gt; intermediate representation (IR) of a program.  The IR is dependent on the<br/>\ninput program/source code.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To test the analysis class you need to provide it an IR which means we<br/>\nneed the whole machinery to setup the IR on which the<br/>\n&gt; analysis works and then drive the analysis with the test object while<br/>\nprobing it correctness.  Generally, the machinery to<br/>\n&gt; setup the IR is complex or large.  So, would one code that up into the<br/>\ntest case?  If so, at what cost?  A more simple<br/>\n&gt; question would be that how much effort should go into setting up the<br/>\nenvironment for object to be tested and test object<br/>\n&gt; itself?  Also, say if the analysis provides information say relation<br/>\nbetween 2 entities in the IR, then how do you test for<br/>\n&gt; this relation while unit testing the analysis (may be this is into another<br/>\nform of testing but anyways...)?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; For people who have read &quot;Unit Testing in Java&quot; the above is a case of<br/>\nObject Under Test scenario.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In simple words, if a chunk of logic embedded in a class requires large<br/>\npieces of information to be setup, then how would one<br/>\n&gt; use JUnit or any unit testing framework in such cases?  Even more, when<br/>\ninstances of such classes go through state changes<br/>\n&gt; depending on interaction with other objects how do you instrument the test<br/>\nand run the test?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The reason I am posting this question is that I have heard a lot about<br/>\nJUnit and how Unit Testing is the &quot;magic bullet&quot; (of<br/>\n&gt; course I have heard people say otherwise about the latter too).  However,<br/>\nI am not convinced as to if it is applicable in all<br/>\n&gt; situations and scenarios.  Even more, are there documents or studies that<br/>\nindicate the impact of Unit Testing on projects say<br/>\n&gt; in terms of shift in timelines, # of bugs, and such?  I am trying to find<br/>\nevidence of usage of JUnit is situations similar to<br/>\n&gt; ones explained above.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; waiting for reply,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; - Venkatesh<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
