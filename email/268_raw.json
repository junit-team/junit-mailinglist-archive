One was from the\nClassLoader (which is different in 3.4 than earlier revs) and could be\nenvironmental. My suggestion: disable the class loader using the\nexcluded.properties.\n\nThe other two errors were bad returns that look just like the result of\na bug in the current Linux JVM from Sun. JVM bugs do not necessarily\ncause crashes. This is a known bug at java.sun.com.\n\nRegards,\n\nRob\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
