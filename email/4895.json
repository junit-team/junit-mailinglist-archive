I like this game a lot and hope you will publish your<br/>\ncode ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I made the constructor of the Tile class private and provided static <br/>\n&gt; makeTileXyz methods to create tiles.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Without having thougt too much about it, but maybe it would make<br/>\nsense to have different classes for the different *kinds of*<br/>\ntiles. Polymorphism could be used nicely for summing up the<br/>\ndifferent points at the end. Just a thought.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Now my test methods get quite large. Each of them assures that the tile <br/>\n&gt; has just (and only) the requested features. So each test checks for <br/>\n&gt; special items on the cards (e.g. isAbbey, isMarketsquare) and counts <br/>\n&gt; the roads coming in and the city parts a tile has.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Could be static attributes of more specialized classes....<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; What do you think about this test case size?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Do your your test methods test on the same level of abstraction?<br/>\nIf you have different levels of abstraction in one test I would<br/>\nsuggest to extract the lower level stuff to a separate method. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Would you create additional methods to help in testing, i.e. for <br/>\n&gt; counting the roads on one tile or a method like isSpecial?<br/>\n&gt; Would you place such helpers in the test class (as they are only used <br/>\n&gt; for testing)? Does that get to complex, i.e. do you eventually need <br/>\n&gt; test cases for your test cases?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I guess you will need this anyway in your application. Just put<br/>\nit into the test class and if necessary refactor it to the tile<br/>\nclass.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Would you rely on some orientation of created tiles, e.g. assume the <br/>\n&gt; left turning road is always constructed as from east turning to south <br/>\n&gt; (maybe this is like the Blackbox / Whitebox discussion)?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What about keeping the orientation in the board? I think the<br/>\norientation is not so much an attribute of a tile but of the<br/>\nplacement of the tile on the board.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrank.</div>",
