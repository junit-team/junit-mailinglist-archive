Looking back at the emails we\nexchanged, your only real comment about it then was, &quot;I would be interested\nto hear anything you hear from your EJU customers about JUnitPerf.&quot; I also\nmade the comment to you that &quot;I hope it wasn&#39;t too presumptuous of us to\ninclude it&quot;, which you never responded to.\n\nAnyway, I would be happy to remove JUnitPerf from the distribution if it\nbothers you being there, as it is not at all core to the product. If you\nread the documentation you will see that it is described in terms of &#39;here&#39;s\nsomething else you can do with your tests if you add in a few JUnitPerf\ndecorators&#39;. I haven&#39;t gotten any feedback from any of our customers that\nthey are actually using JUnitPerf in conjunction with Enhanced JUnit.\n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nMike Silverstein\nSilverMark, Inc.\nThe object testing company\nhttp://www.javatesting.com\n\n\n",
