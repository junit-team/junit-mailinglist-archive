Jtest uses \nParasoft&#39;s patented Test Generation System technology (patent \n#5,784,553 & 5,761,408) to automatically generate input test cases \nthat expose uncaught, undocumented runtime exceptions. \n\nDuring black-box testing Jtest automatically reads DbC specification \ninformation built into a class with the DbC language, then \nautomatically creates and executes test cases that verify the \nfunctionality specified in the contract. You can add user-defined \ntest cases by adding code to automatically-generated JUnit test class \ntemplates, modifying automatically-generated JUnit test classes based \non automatically-generated Jtest test cases, pointing Jtest to your \nexisting JUnit test cases, or by adding method inputs in the Jtest \nGUI. \n\nDuring regression testing, Jtest verifies that code modifications do \nnot introduce problems. Jtest performs automatic regression testing \nat the class level, allowing you to run test suites that monitor your \ncode&#39;s integrity early in the development process. You can perform \nregression testing by restoring a test and clicking a button, or by \nintegrating batch-mode Jtest into nightly builds to ensure that \nregression errors are found and fixed as soon as possible. \n\n\n\n",
