You are right that some of my code is redundant\n&gt; as presently shown. I was just trying to illustrate a point. I&#39;ve got\n&gt; quite a few other test cases and I would like to run all of them\n&gt; together as a single test suite rather than as a series of standalone\n&gt; test cases.\n\nThere&#39;s no reason you can&#39;t do this:\n\n  * Use Ant\n  * Use GSBase&#39;s RecursiveTestSuite\n  * Use JUnit-addons&#39;s DirectorySuiteBuilder\n  * Create a custom suite method and add other suites to it (the \n&quot;AllTests&quot; pattern)\n\npublic static Test suite() {\n     TestSuite suite = new TestSuite(&quot;All My Tests&quot;);\n     suite.addTestSuite(TestClass1.class);    // extract test*() methods\n     suite.addTest(TestClass2.suite());       // use custom suite()\n     return suite;\n}\n\nAny of these work perfectly. Put the above method in any class (not \nnecessarily a subclass of TestCase -- that&#39;s not needed), then do\n\n     java -cp &lt;your classpath&gt; &lt;your favorite test runner&gt; &lt;your \nAllTests class&gt;\n\nThat&#39;ll do it.\n\n&gt; Thus, \n&gt; \n&gt; 1. junit.swingui.TestRunner.run(InfoRequestStoreTest.class) is fine.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2. junit.swingui.TestRunner.run(suite()) is not fine.\n&gt; \n&gt; In the first example I&#39;m passing a TestCase to TestRunner.run(). In\n&gt; the second example I&#39;m passing a TestSuite. Both TestCase and\n&gt; TestSuite implement the Test interface. However, TestSuite cannot be\n&gt; cast to Test.\n\nThis statement is false, so I have to assume that you mean something \nelse. TestSuite implements Test, so clearly, this assignment works:\n\n     TestSuite suite = new TestSuite();\n     ...\n     Test test = suite;\n\nSo what did you mean to write here?\n\n&gt; What puzzles me is that this failure to cast occurs in\n&gt; junit.swingui.TestRunner.run() and junit.awtui.TestRunner.run() but\n&gt; not in junit.textui.TestRunner.run().\n\nIf you&#39;re talking about a ClassCastException, then read the FAQ or \nchapter 8 of _JUnit Recipes_. My guess is that your production class \nInfoRequestStore relies on some third-party software that doesn&#39;t like \nto be reloaded by JUnit&#39;s class loader. /That/ is what you might put in \nthe excluded.properties file.\n\n&gt; I&#39;ve read older messages at this site and it seems this is not an\n&gt; unusual problem. The only difference that I can see is that they got\n&gt; their code to compile but then encountered ClassCastException at\n&gt; runtime. Whereas in my case I don&#39;t get as far as running the code\n&gt; because this potential runtime exception is being picked up earlier\n&gt; during compilation.\n\nI don&#39;t understand this statement, either, because runtime exceptions \nare not picked up during compilation, whatever &quot;picked up&quot; means. \nExceptions only occur when code executes.\n\n&gt; The recommended solution is to edit the excluded.properties file. In\n&gt; my case I&#39;ve added a new entry - excluded.9=test.* where &#39;test&#39; is my\n&gt; package name. This has had no effect and I wonder if I&#39;m doing the\n&gt; right thing.\n\nThat is rarely necessary for test code; usually only for third party \ncode, such as JDBC drivers, that don&#39;t react well when reloaded. See the \nabove. I bet it&#39;s something your InfoRequestStore depends on. To test \nthis, comment out the declaration of that variable from your tests and \ntry running them.\n-- \nJ. B.
