However I think I would be reluctant to \n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; change the way my\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; code was implemented just so that I could test it, as some \n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; of the other\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; My experience is different. I&#39;ve found that changing my \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; coding style to make it testable (which doesn&#39;t mean just \n&gt;&gt; putting in lots of unnecessary accessors) also makes it \n&gt;&gt; better. The more I apply this to different targets, such as \n&gt;&gt; shell scripts, the more I&#39;m convinced. \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; Steve\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; I concur.  I&#39;ve found that testable code exhibits certain composable \n&gt;&gt; properties that foster interface-based design.  For example, the \n&gt;&gt; assembly of a few simple objects to perform a more complex \n&gt;&gt; task allows \n&gt;&gt; any of the objects to be mocked.  In turn, by refactoring designs to \n&gt;&gt; extract complex static relationships into interface-based \n&gt;&gt; compositions, \n&gt;&gt; the design becomes more open to extension, but closed to \n&gt;&gt; modification. \n&gt;&gt; So, I&#39;ll up the ante and claim that designs may change as a \n&gt;&gt; side effect \n&gt;&gt; of writing tests.  This is the essence of test-first design.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Mike\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; If these are indeed compex relationships then it may well be the case that\n&gt; refactoring the code is an appropriate course of action. Not all\n&gt; relationships *are* complex! In my experience it is better to keep the code\n&gt; simple where ever possible. I might understand what is going on - but my\n&gt; code maintanence successors may not.\n&gt; \n&gt; Changing the code to suit your tests could quite easily cause your code to\n&gt; have a stitled and difficult to read style - especially to less experienced\n&gt; coders. My goal is always clarity in coding style. \n&gt; \n\nAgreed - simplicity is paramount.  Toward that end, if through testing \nthe code a simpler design takes form, then all the better.  The point is \nthat testing may be the catalyst for rethinking the design, and \nrefactoring the code, to better serve the intended clients.  In other \nwords, there can be a positive feedback loop between design, coding, and \ntesting.\n\nMike\n-- \nMike Clark\nClarkware Consulting, Inc.\nCustom Software Architecture, Design,\nDevelopment, and Performance Consulting\nhttp://www.clarkware.com\n\n\n",
