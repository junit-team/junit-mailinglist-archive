It pains me to see Java held up as an example of\na great OO language, without any acknowledgement of Smalltalk. For the\nlast three years, I&#39;ve spent approximately 50% of each day using Java\nand 50% using Smalltalk and I&#39;m much more productive when using\nSmalltalk. That said, it would be nice if Smalltalk supported\nInterfaces, which I find extremely useful but is not yet supported in\nSmalltalk, to my knowledge.\n\nYou can also download a free, noncommercial version of VisualWorks,\nwhich is an industrial-strength version of Smalltalk that&#39;s been proven\nin a number of industries (financial, industrial, shipping, etc.) for\nyears at\nhttp://www.cincom.com/scripts/smalltalk.dll//downloads/index.ssp\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Jason Rogers [mailto:jacaetevha@...] \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;disclaimer&gt;\n&gt; \tWhat follows is a shameless plug for a real Object-Oriented\n&gt; \tlanguage, one that is much better than the knock-off Java\n&gt; \tthat many of us are forced to program in on a regular \n&gt; basis. &lt;/disclaimer&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; If you are *really* interested in a language that will help \n&gt; you to understand Objects better than any language out there, \n&gt; Smalltalk is the way to go.  That being said the flavor of \n&gt; the day is definitely Squeak, an open source implementation \n&gt; of the Smalltalk-80 system (www.squeak.org\n&gt; -- a minimal front-end to the community).  As far as IDEs go, \n&gt; Smalltalk was and continues to be the leader for many \n&gt; reasons, but since this isn&#39;t a Smalltalk list, I will leave \n&gt; it there to whet your appetite.  By the way, in case you \n&gt; didn&#39;t know, JUnit is the Java equivalent of the original \n&gt; XUnit testing framework by Kent Beck called SUnit (Smalltalk \n&gt; Unit), and Squeak is fully up-to-date with the latest and \n&gt; greatest on that front as well.\n&gt; \n&gt; =jason\n&gt; [:question | ^One] \n&gt; \n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Adelbert Groebbens [mailto:adelbert.groebbens@...] \n&gt; Sent: Monday, December 16, 2002 5:10 PM\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: RE: [junit] OT: OO Newcomer\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Here is a list of books and resources I&#39;ve found very \n&gt; inspirational (the numbers indicate an ordening in terms of phases).\n&gt; \n&gt; Java seems to me one of the most suitable languages for \n&gt; concentrating on learning OO.\n\n\n",
