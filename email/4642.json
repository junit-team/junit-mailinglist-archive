    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1022636696\">In the DBC thread there was mention of:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt; Brian Marrick makes the distinction between preconditions and checked<br/>\n &gt; preconditions. There are some conditions that are required for the<br/>\n &gt; contract to hold but which the method either cannot check, cannot check<br/>\n &gt; efficiently, or simply elects not to check. In this case, the<br/>\n &gt; results are usually given as &#39;undefined&#39;. Checked preconditions on<br/>\n &gt; the other hand, can be expected to signal a particular error and generally<br/>\n &gt; to exit gracefully. Unit tests can and should verify that violations of<br/>\n &gt; checked preconditions do, in fact, fail.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>...and...<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt; This is also what I&#39;ve called DBC vs. Defensive Programming.  DBC is simply a<br/>\n &gt; statement of the contract (expressed neatly in JUnit tests of course :-)<br/>\n &gt; -- the &quot;what&quot; must be true in order to gaurantee the results --<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Tests for /checked/ preconditions is straightforward.<br/>\n<br/>\nCan anyone show an example of how you express /unchecked/ preconditions<br/>\nin JUnit tests?  As a test in the client that shows it never calls the<br/>\nunchecked method with a violated precondition?  Duplicated in all client<br/>\nmethods?  If it can&#39;t be done, then how do you document unchecked<br/>\npreconditions?<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards,<br/>\nPaul<br/>\n-----<br/>\nPaul Hodgetts -- Principal Consultant<br/>\nAgile Logic -- www.agilelogic.com<br/>\nTraining, Mentoring, Development -- Agile Processes, XP, Java, J2EE, C++</div>",
