I do have a \nfew questions:\n\n1. If there are multiple @Before annotated methods in a class, are any \nguarantees made about what order they are invoked in? Same question for \n@After, @BeforeClass, and @AfterClass.\n\n2. Is there any way to control the order in which tests are run? Or is \nthat pretty much still up to the test runner like in JUnit 3?\n\n3. Is there any equivalent to the suite() method in JUnit 3? i.e. how do \nI bundle up several different test classes so they can be run as a group?\n\n4. Java 5 is obviously required to build JUnit 4. Can it nonetheless run \nin Java 1.4? or is Java 5 pretty much required for anything that uses \nJUnit 4?\n\n5. The GUI test runners don&#39;t appear to be in Version4 CVS. Will they \nreturn at some point?\n\n6. Why are Assert.failSame, Assert.failNotSame, Assert.failNotEquals(), \nand Assert.format now public?\n\nAny light anyone can shed on these questions would be appreciated.
