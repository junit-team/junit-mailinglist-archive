Quality code only comes from<br/>\n&gt; using TDD.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, this is a very bold claim, and one that is easy to challenge.<br/>\n<br/>\nAssume that you write a high-quality product using TDD, I can write this<br/>\nexact same high-quality product using all your same tests, except I won&#39;t<br/>\nhave written them first.  And voila, high-quality software without ever<br/>\nusing TDD.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe truth is:  the main impact that TDD has when you develop software is on<br/>\nits design, not its quality.  Hence the last &quot;D&quot; in &quot;TDD&quot;.  I definitely<br/>\nbelieve that software written using TDD will have a very different<br/>\narchitecture from another software delivered with standard testing<br/>\ntechniques (&quot;write the code, write the test, repeat&quot;).  But until you take a<br/>\nlook at the tests themselves, you can&#39;t compare their quality just based on<br/>\nthe testing methodology that was used.  After all, someone could be claiming<br/>\nto do TDD and only write one test (or tests that do no asserts) while the<br/>\nother non-TDD person will have written 1000 tests, and will therefore come<br/>\nup with higher quality code.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also believe that &quot;the simplest thing that can possibly work&quot; can lead to<br/>\nvery bad design, but I&#39;ll save this for a different thread.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nCédric<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://testng.org\">http://testng.org</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>",
