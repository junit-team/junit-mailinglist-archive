What if a entity name or a attribute name changes? Then the\n&gt; XML dataset file would not work anymore for DbUnit unless it is\n&gt; updated. Much maintainance work and prone to errors.\n&gt; \n&gt; Besides this, if we create data with our ORM, it can be assured, that\n&gt; the created data is valid because we have validation rules for each\n&gt; entity. If someone writes test data for DbUnit in that XML file, then\n&gt; no validation is done when the data is created.\n&gt; \n&gt; For cleaning up the database we use a so called\n&gt; &quot;EntityGarbageCollector&quot; (EGC). As soon as we create an entity, we put\n&gt; it in the EGC. In the tearDown method the garbage is diposed, e.g. the\n&gt; entities are deleted in a generic way by the EGC.\n&gt; \n&gt; I am not defending our solution at all cost. Here are many JUnit\n&gt; experts and I would be happy to read your opinion on this topic. So\n&gt; does DbUnit make sense when using an Object/Relational Mapper?\n\nWhat are you trying to test?\n\n1. The client code that invokes your ORM layer.\n2. The mappings between your entities and the database.\n3. Your implementation of the ORM layer. (Did you build it?)\n4. Something else entirely?\n\nI am also a fan of putting test data directly in the test, so I&#39;d be \ninclined to use the ORM to set up test data on a test-by-test basis for \ncase #1 and #2, but not case #3. For case #3, my answer is long and \ncomplex and I prefer not to type it unless that&#39;s what you mean. :)\n\nIf it&#39;s case #4, then tell us more.\n-- \nJ. B.
