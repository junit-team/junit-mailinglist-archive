If you wanted to test correctnes of <br/>\n&gt; implementatio with DBC you would have to duplicate a function&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; algorithm - or an equivalent one - in its postcondition. Tests <br/>\n </span></blockquote>don&#39;t <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; suffer from that dilemma since tests can work with samples.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; DBC is not about compile time verification but about runtime <br/>\n </span></blockquote>checks. <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Code verification has some relationship to DBC but is a different <br/>\n&gt; field of research. <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; No, that&#39;s not what happens when using DBC.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t care if the original DBC was not designed to do that. But it <br/>\nCAN be modified to do what I want to be done with DBC. As you said, <br/>\ncode verification has relationship with DBC.<br/>\n<br/>\nLets not call it DBC, call it XXX if you want.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a way to use preconditions, postconditions and invariants to <br/>\nreplace at least most JUnit tests.<br/>\n<br/>\nXXX can be used to create test data at compile time for each method. <br/>\nAny test data can be used randomly for that purpose as long as it <br/>\nobeys the precondition. The result of the method can be automatically <br/>\ncompared at compile time with the postcondition. Invariants never may <br/>\nbe violated.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is all done at *compile time*. My XXX has nothing to do with <br/>\nchecking at run time but with checking at compile time.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany nice things can done with XXX. For example &quot;Liskovsches <br/>\nSubstitutionsprinzip&quot; can be checked very natively with using XXX <br/>\ninstead of JUnit. This is just one benefit of many using XXX.</div>",
