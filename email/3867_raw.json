I work on an app server, not components that run in app servers.  One could use Cactus to test Tomcat&#39;s Servlet/JSP container or ours, and even stretch it to test containers and services outside the servlet container.  Maybe you could even build an entire app server test framework on it.  But when the Servlet container is busted (or not built), the whole test framework is paralyzed. We needed an app server test framework that could run external to the server, and not worry if certain pieces of the server were broken or incomplete. \n\nScott Stirling\nJRun QA\nMacromedia\n\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Vincent Massol [mailto:vmassol@...]\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, January 22, 2002 6:46 AM\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: RE: [junit] Junit support for non-standard distributed\n&gt; applicatio ns\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Hi Scott,\n&gt; \n&gt; Have you tried to use Jakarta Cactus \n&gt; (http://jakarta.apache.org/cactus)\n&gt; ? The idea is to perform integration unit testing (i.e. in-container\n&gt; tests) and it looks like a nice complement to JUnit for doing\n&gt; integration unit testing for a servlet engine/J2EE container.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Vincent\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; &gt; From: Scott Stirling [mailto:sstirling@...]\n&gt; &gt; Sent: 21 January 2002 19:13\n&gt; &gt; To: &#39;&#39;junit@yahoogroups.com&#39; &#39;\n&gt; &gt; Subject: RE: [junit] Junit support for non-standard distributed\n&gt; applicatio\n&gt; &gt; ns\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I wouldn&#39;t discourage new ideas or crossing boundaries.  JUnit is\n&gt; great as\n&gt; &gt; a standalone, complete unit test framework.  It&#39;s also useful as an\n&gt; &gt; assertion and test driver library.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; We use JUnit at Macromedia for plain old unit testing, but we also\n&gt; have a\n&gt; &gt; homegrown automated functional test framework that uses JUnit (via\n&gt; Ant)\n&gt; &gt; for assertion, test driver, and reporting capabilities.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Scott Stirling\n&gt; &gt; JRun QA\n&gt; &gt; Macromedia\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; &gt; From: Chris Eppstein\n&gt; &gt; To: &#39;junit@yahoogroups.com&#39;\n&gt; &gt; Sent: 1/21/2002 10:48 AM\n&gt; &gt; Subject: RE: [junit] Junit support for non-standard distributed\n&gt; applicatio\n&gt; &gt; ns\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Guillaume,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \tI&#39;m wondering if you could be clever and just run all the tests\n&gt; &gt; on\n&gt; &gt; the same machine by putting the client and the server on the same\n&gt; &gt; machine\n&gt; &gt; (within the same vm even). Remember that the point of JUnit \n&gt; is not to\n&gt; &gt; functionally test the software. It is to unit test it. Try to break\n&gt; down\n&gt; &gt; your code into small testable pieces. By testing each piece you will\n&gt; &gt; have\n&gt; &gt; greater control and more confidence that it will work once \n&gt; you put it\n&gt; &gt; together. It may not even be necessary to run the client \n&gt; and server at\n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; same time if you take this approach; the test case could act as the\n&gt; &gt; server\n&gt; &gt; for testing the client and vice-versa. These are just a few thoughts\n&gt; --\n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; details of your particular program may prevent such an approach. But\n&gt; if\n&gt; &gt; you\n&gt; &gt; are testing your code from the very beginning you shouldn&#39;t have too\n&gt; &gt; much\n&gt; &gt; trouble doing it.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Chris\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; &gt; From: guillaume_berche [mailto:guillaume.berche@...]\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Monday, January 21, 2002 8:49 AM\n&gt; &gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [junit] Junit support for non-standard distributed\n&gt; applications\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hello,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m working on a Java layer implementing various communication\n&gt; &gt; infrastructrure betwen processes based on raw TCP and UDP. I would\n&gt; &gt; like to test it using Junit. However, this requires me to write a\n&gt; &gt; test case which is distributed among many processes which act as\n&gt; &gt; client/servers.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve looked into jakarta&#39;s cactus, and Junit EE but I \n&gt; understand they\n&gt; &gt; would support only distributed applications based on standard\n&gt; &gt; communication protocols (namely HTTP and an EJB contained)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Is there an extension to Junit that would support testing of non-\n&gt; &gt; standard distributed applications?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve started designing an RMI-based version of the junit interfaces\n&gt; &gt; where a testcase could spawn one or more &quot;distributed test cases&quot;\n&gt; &gt; running on remote hosts and that would report their status through\n&gt; &gt; the originating test&#39;s TestListener. I&#39;m basically remotizing the\n&gt; &gt; junit interfaces.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I wonder if such extension would already exist and if I could reuse\n&gt; &gt; it rather than redoing this from scratch.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thanks for your help,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Guillaume.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; &gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
