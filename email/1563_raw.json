I expect that&#39;s a fairly common idiom\naround here, but I added a small twist to make my life easier. Suppose\nI have some class Foo which I want to add a relatively comprehensive\ntesting suite to. Instead of adding a main() to Foo, and the\nappropriate helper methods to set up, run, and tear down tests, I&#39;d\ncreate a static inner class, called Test, and put all the testing\nmaterial in there.\n\nI figure this idea has several advantages over other possible\napproaches:\n1. One can package up the code for public release by removing all\nfiles that end in *Test.class.\n2. Code for the test suite is in the same file as the code it\ntests. This makes it easy to add new tests.\n3. There&#39;s a clear distinction between what methods are part of the\ntesting suite and what methods are part of the actual implementation\nof the class.\n\nOf course, I&#39;d rather switch over to JUnit, for many reasons, but have\nfound so far that this idea doesn&#39;t cross over very well. Here&#39;s what\nI&#39;ve tried, and the errors I&#39;ve gotten; if anyone has any insight on\nwhat I can do, please let me know.\n\npublic class SomeClass {\n    // actual code goes here...\n\n    public class Test extends TestCase {\n        public Test(String name) {      \n            super(name);\n        }\n\n        public void testSomething {\n            assertEquals(true, true);\n        }\n   }\n}\n\npublic class ComprehensiveTestSuite {\n    public static void main (String[] args) {\n        junit.textui.TestRunner.run(suite());\n    }\n\n    public static Test suite() {  \n        TestSuite result = new TestSuite();\n        result.addTestSuite(SomeClass$Test.class);\n        return result;\n    }                 \n}\n\nThis compiles fine, but I get the following error if I run, say,\njava ComprehensiveTestSuite:\n                            \n.F\nTime: 0.096\nThere was 1 failure:\n1)  \nwarning(junit.framework.TestSuite$1)junit.framework.AssertionFailedError:\nClass SomeClass$Test has no public constructor TestCase(String name)\n    at\nComprehensiveTestSuite.main(ComprehensiveTestSuite.java:7)\n\nFAILURES!!!\nTests run: 1,  Failures: 1,  Errors: 0\n\nAny ideas? Thanks a lot. (I&#39;m using JDK1.3 and JUnit 3.7, by the way.)\n\n- Colin McMillen\n\n\n",
