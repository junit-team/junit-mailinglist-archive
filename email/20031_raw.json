I am using \n=\r\nAbbot framework for gui testing. I have written a test class with some \ntes=\r\nt cases. I created suite of tests by overriding the suite method.\n\n   As I =\r\nstart the testing, the first test case is run and after that \nthe testing g=\r\nets suddently stopped. It neither reports for failure or \nsuccessful of tes=\r\nting.\n\n  How can I resolve the problem ?\n\nThanks\n\n\n",
