No - therefore we do not need\n&gt; &gt;to test them. Errors within private methods will become apparent from\n&gt; &gt;testing the other interfaces.\n&gt;\n&gt; Undoubtably that&#39;s true. But then if we are accepting that testing\n&gt; public/friendly/protected methods adecuately test these methods, why not go\n&gt; one step beyond and say that black box testing is all we need? It seems to\n&gt; me that testing private methods is as useful and valid as testing\n&gt; non-private ones, just at a different level of granularity.\n\nAs a specific example, say I&#39;ve got some computation that involves a fairly\nhairy algorithm in one place.  I probably want to encapsulate that algorithm\ninto its own method so, e.g., I can Substitute in a new Algorithm later when\nsomeone points out that I (again) made the problem a lot harder than it needed\nto be.  I may well want to make that method private, though, as its existence\nor signature could reveal more about the internals of my class than I&#39;d like;\nit might, e.g., have an argument that refers to a component of some (private)\nfield.\n\nPresumably I would be _especially_ interested in testing such a method given\nthat it represents a non-trivial algorithm.  If I&#39;m forced to only test it\nindirectly then the tests of the public methods are likely to be harder to\nwrite and may depend in weird ways on this (hidden) implementation decision.\n\nI find that one of the (many) advantages of breaking things down into little\nmethods is that writing the tests is both less difficult and less\n(psychologically) daunting.  Big methods with complex behaviors are a pain to\ntest because there&#39;s so much _thinking_ involved in figuring out appropriate\nboundary conditions, blah, blah, blah, while little methods are usually much\neasier to test just because they&#39;re easier to understand.  The flipside,\nthough, is (as has been mentioned before) I don&#39;t want the creation of these\nlittle (sub)methods to make my public class interface (and consequently my\npublic obligations) bigger and more complex.  Thus I almost always make these\nnew little methods private initially, and only change them to protected or\npublic later when some clear need arises.  (As others have noted, this is\nessentially an application of YAGNI.)\n\n    Nic\n\n\n",
