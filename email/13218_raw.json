The \nroot\n&gt; directory for the JUnit installation is C:&#92;Program Files&#92;junit3.8.1.\n&gt; I&#39;ve created an environment variable called JUNIT_HOME which has \nthis\n&gt; path as its value, I&#39;ve added this variable to the CLASSPATH \nvariable,\n&gt; and I&#39;ve added %JUNIT_HOME%&#92;junit.jar to the CLASSPATH as well. I\n&gt; haven&#39;t moved junit.jar anywhere, and using the text-based or\n&gt; AWT-based test runners makes no difference; I still get the error.\n&gt; Even if I run the command from C:&#92;Program\n&gt; Files&#92;junit3.8.1&#92;junit&#92;tests&#92;runner, where I can see\n&gt; LoadedFromJar.class for myself, I get the same error, and the \ncurrent\n&gt; directory (.) is part of my CLASSPATH system variable.
