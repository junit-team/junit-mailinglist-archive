There will always be a few folks who are not yet used to\nthe et=\r\niquette and protocols of the mailing lists. It happens; been\nthere and done=\r\n that myself. I think the biggest issue was with folks\nwho signup on the ma=\r\niling list and ask &quot;What is JUnit?&quot; Now, that&#39;s a\nvalid question, but I thi=\r\nnk the thought was to provide a list for that\nkind of question, so that it =\r\ndidn&#39;t disturb the flow of the &quot;How do\nI?&quot; questions.\n\nMy thought is that i=\r\nf we carefully point these folks at the available\ndocumentation on junit.or=\r\ng and suggest reviewing ESR&#39;s Smart Question\nessay, that they&#39;ll either giv=\r\ne up when they see that some personal\neffort is involved or they&#39;ll appreci=\r\nate the help and start becoming\nproductive members of the JUnit community.\n=\r\n\nI also agree with J.B.&#39;s point, that some of these people are the\nexperts =\r\nof a couple of years from now. You know, Mike Clark isn&#39;t\ngetting any young=\r\ner, so we need to find and train his replacement as\nsoon as possible! ;-)\n\n=\r\nSimon\n\n--\nwww.simonpeter.com\n\nOn 9/21/05, Lis &lt;lisfolks@...&gt; wrote:\n=\r\n&gt; I signed up for this list - after finding it in a web search - a\n&gt; couple=\r\n of days ago.
