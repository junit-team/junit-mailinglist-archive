You =\r\nshould\n&gt; &gt; use the setUp and tearDown methods to properly setup each test.\n=\r\n\n&gt; I  know that this is the &quot;pure doctrine&quot;. But what do you do, if you\n&gt; h=\r\nave a series of dependent test (some interaction between two systems)\n&gt; tha=\r\nt need a defined protocoll and therefor a defined order?\n\nWhat I do is to m=\r\nake it one big test. I&#39;ll still see if the whole\nthing failed or not, and i=\r\nf it fails then the failure message and\nthe stack trace will help me to tel=\r\nl how far it got. You lose the\nusual advantage of running ALL the tests bec=\r\nause those bits after \nthe failing test don&#39;t get run, but if we ran those =\r\nbits they wouldn&#39;t\nbe valid tests ANYWAY since they depend on the previous =\r\ntest\nwhich failed!\n\nBasically, a single test can be as big as you like, it&#39;=\r\ns just the\nunit of testing which is independent of all other tests. USUALLY=\r\n\nwe make very short simple unit tests because we try hard to avoid\nthis kin=\r\nd of dependence, but your need for dependent tests is not \nunheard of, it&#39;s=\r\n simply to be avoided when possible.\n\n-- Michael Chermside\n\n\n",
