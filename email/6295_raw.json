To what extent is that \nincurring an overhead?  \n\nRight now, most of the unit test creation is done without any tool using junit+cactus+httpunit. My point of contention is the case in which for every change I make to my class, I need to incorporate that change into the test class, if it is required. How can that be minimized?\n\nThe extent of overhead is what I am trying to gauge through this discussion. Most of the responses were on an individual scale and not on the organizational level. These overheads which might seem minimal on an individual basis, add on to big numbers on a higher level. This is what I am looking at. And what steps can I take to reduce them. If you can list the steps based on your experience, it will be easier for me to implement those steps in the workplace.\n\nTIA,\n\nCatch all the cricket action. Download Yahoo!
