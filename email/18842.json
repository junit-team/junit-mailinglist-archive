I expected to talk a little about Theories and<br/>\nassertThat, but we ended up having a wide-ranging discussion about a variety<br/>\nof topics. I mind-mapped the result and put in on the conference wiki: <br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.agileopennorthwest.com/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?FutureOfUnitTesting\">http://www.agileopennorthwest.com/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?FutureOfUnitTesting</a><br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThe most surprising result to me was the interest in language features for<br/>\ntesting-what would a language look like that included double-checking as a<br/>\nfirst-class concept? I was also surprised at how much commonality there was<br/>\nbetween the unit and functional testing &quot;vendors&quot;, that reporting is a big<br/>\nissue for everyone.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing missing from the discussion was much talk about the hopes and<br/>\ndreams of users, so I thought I would open up the question here. What is it<br/>\nyou wish your testing tool would do for you that it doesn&#39;t?<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nKent Beck<br/>\n<br/>\nThree Rivers Institute<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
