I *think*<br/>\ncategories would really help here, although I&#39;m more than willing to be<br/>\ntold why there are better alternatives. They would allow tests to be<br/>\ngrouped in code according to what was being tested, but also allow for<br/>\ncertain tests to be marked as &quot;very long running&quot; (the kind of test<br/>\nwhich might be done on a weekly basis rather than nightly) or<br/>\n&quot;performance&quot; (functionality which is tested for correctness elsewhere,<br/>\nbut set up in this test to get performance measurements) etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve seen a feature request for this on the SF site, but it talks of the<br/>\ntest runner doing the work - which would certainly allow whole classes<br/>\nto be classified accordingly (although each runner would probably need<br/>\nto implement the functionality), but the individual tests might be<br/>\nsomewhat harder to include/exclude, if the normal introspector is being<br/>\nused.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, I think this would be great functionality to have in the<br/>\ncore of JUnit4.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, why am I wrong? :)<br/>\n <br/>\nJon Skeet<br/>\nSenior Software Engineer<br/>\nCLEARSWIFT<br/>\nThe MIMEsweeper Company<br/>\n<br/>\nDDI:               +44 (0) 1189  038  109<br/>\nMobile:           +44 (0) 7970 158 865<br/>\nSwitchboard:   +44 (0) 1189  038  903 <br/>\nFax:               +44 (0) 1189  039  000      <br/>\nWeb: www.clearswift.com <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nClearswift monitors, controls and protects all its messaging traffic in compliance with its corporate email policy using Clearswift products.<br/>\nFind out more about Clearswift, its solutions and services at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.clearswift.com\">http://www.clearswift.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThis communication is confidential and may contain privileged information intended solely for the named addressee(s).
