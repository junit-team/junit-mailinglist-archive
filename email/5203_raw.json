If they don&#39;t,\n&gt; you replace them.  Unfortunately, this isn&#39;t always\n&gt; the case (at least where I&#39;ve been) so I&#39;ve had to\n&gt; develop some defensive coding technique.\n\nExactly; and so the question has to be asked: why the hell not?! Removing \ndoesn&#39;t necessarily mean firing; it can mean reassigning to another \ndepartment, changing role, and so on. I firmly believe that any seemingly \nentirely incompetent person is really just someone in the wrong role. This \nnotion is reinforced at least once per project.\n\nI need to find projects with fewer idiots. :)\n\n&gt; Also, from your remark about having to change code\n&gt; because of the checked versus unchecked exceptions, it\n&gt; sounded like you were merely moaning about some part\n&gt; of your body hurting.\n\n&quot;Doctor, it hurts when I declare which exceptions I&#39;m going to throw...&quot;\n\nUsing unchecked exceptions appears to pass the &quot;doctor, it hurts...&quot; test!\n\n&gt; I, for one, don&#39;t mind having\n&gt; to go through and change a bunch of code because of\n&gt; some refactoring I&#39;m doing.\n\nI don&#39;t consider the exception list &quot;code&quot;. Maybe that&#39;s the reason we don&#39;t \nquite agree on this one. I see it as part of the contract, and I&#39;m not \naccustomed to explicitly state contracts. To me, that&#39;s what the tests are \nfor. If I were a heavy-duty Design by Contract guy, I might think differently.\n\nIf *all I&#39;m changing* are method signatures, that&#39;s crappy. Period.\n\n&gt; Really, on the whole, I would tend to agree with you. \n&gt; I mainly wanted to get that viewpoint out there to get\n&gt; the discussion a little broader, just in case anyone\n&gt; was thinking that the unchecked exceptions were the\n&gt; end all, be all of coding (in Java anyway).\n\nIf they follow the Wiki link, they should get ample helpings of both sides of \nthe issue. :)\n\n&gt; Fear (of my crappy code and/or design) makes me write\n&gt; tests.\n\nMe, too.\n\n&gt; Fear (of my coworkers or even sometimes of myself)\n&gt; makes me tend to use checked versus unchecked\n&gt; exceptions.\n\nFear of wasting my time makes me tend to use unchecked versus checked \nexceptions. :)\n \n&gt; Mindkiller?  Sure...but as long as the fear is\n&gt; controlled, and you use the response productively, it\n&gt; can be a good thing. ;)\n\nFear is good, but only in moderation.\n \n&gt; P.S. Ah, something else I just thought of after\n&gt; re-reading.  We are also using exceptions for flow\n&gt; control on occasion (for the web-based app we&#39;re\n&gt; converting from VB).  In those instances, the\n&gt; exception is thrown and we absolutely must notify the\n&gt; user and/or do something about it to recover.\n\nI can see where a compile test for that situation would seem better than a \nruntime test, but I think I prefer the runtime tests, all things being equal.\n\n--\nJ.
