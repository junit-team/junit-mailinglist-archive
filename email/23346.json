    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1106379477\">All,<br/>\n<br/>\nAs you may have heard, I&#39;m planning to start a junit.contrib project.<br/>\nIn this mail, I&#39;ll first review the reasons for such a project, and<br/>\nsecondly, I have a proposal for its structure, and I&#39;d like feedback.<br/>\n<br/>\n=== BACKGROUND: REASONS FOR junit.contrib ===<br/>\n<br/>\nJUnit has always officially strived to be &quot;the intersection of all<br/>\nuseful Java testing frameworks&quot;.  Thus, the goals for code that gets<br/>\ninto the junit repository include that it should:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Minimize dependencies on external libraries or particular JDK<br/>\nversions beyond a widely-used minimum.<br/>\n2) Be very unlikely to change API moving forward.<br/>\n3) Emphasize opportunities for extension over the richness of core features.<br/>\n4) Have potential usefulness to all Java developers, regardless of<br/>\ntheir application domain.<br/>\n5) Match in style to the current JUnit codebase.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany people have made JUnit extensions that would be useful to a<br/>\nhealthy portion of Java developers, but do not meet all of the above<br/>\ncriteria.  For example, the extension may target a particular IDE, or<br/>\ndata that is stored in a SQL database, or in XML, or it may be<br/>\nexperimental, and likely to change API, or it may require an external<br/>\ndependency.  Also, as the popularity of non-Java languages on the JVM<br/>\nhas grown, some people have made extensions to JUnit that make it<br/>\neasier to use JUnit&#39;s core functionality in ways idiomatic to those<br/>\nother languages.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt has always been an option for developers of these extensions to<br/>\npublish them on their own repositories.  However, having a central<br/>\nclearing-house as an option for extension developers has some<br/>\nadvantages, including discoverability, documentation, and dependency<br/>\nmanagement.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe goal is for junit.contrib (just started on<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/dsaff/junit.contrib)\">https://github.com/dsaff/junit.contrib)</a> to be this clearing house.<br/>\nAll Java classes in this project should be in packages prefixed with<br/>\norg.junit.contrib.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, the<br/>\n<br/>\n=== PROPOSAL ===<br/>\n<br/>\nThe root structure of the project will contain:<br/>\n<br/>\n/<br/>\n  README<br/>\n  docs/<br/>\n  java/<br/>\n  scala/ [?]<br/>\n  clojure/ [?]<br/>\n<br/>\nThus, a folder for overall documentation, and then a folder<br/>\nper-language.  I haven&#39;t thought about how non-java language<br/>\nextensions should be organized.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnder java, there should be a folder per &quot;subproject&quot; (names chosen,<br/>\nwith apologies, by <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random)\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random)</a>:<br/>\n<br/>\njava/<br/>\n  brewmasters/<br/>\n  callisto/<br/>\n  hekler/<br/>\n  norway/<br/>\n  ...<br/>\n<br/>\nEach subproject should be organized as its own maven project:<br/>\n<br/>\njava/brewmasters/<br/>\n  pom.xml<br/>\n  src/main/java/org/junit/contrib/brewmasters/...<br/>\n  src/test/java/org/junit/contrib/brewmasters/...<br/>\n<br/>\nAs potential users and contributors to such a repository, are there<br/>\npitfalls in this organization that I should be aware of in advance?<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\n   David Saff</div>",
