Her <br/>\nargument was that unit tests, as performed today, are able to check <br/>\nonly a specific path on the code, the path stablished by initial <br/>\nconditions. Instead, she performed specificacion checking using <br/>\ntheorem provers and other advanced tools. This has made me think <br/>\nabout the utility of unit testing and the level of code reliability <br/>\nthat unit testing can provide.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do you have to say about this? Could it have an impact on unit <br/>\ntesting and, specifically, on JUnit?<br/>\n<br/>\nLook forward to hearing from you.<br/>\n<br/>\nRoberto Juárez Maldonado<br/>\nJava Analyst Programmer.<br/>\nMobile Networks.<br/>\nOmnilogic Telecomunicaciones.<br/>\nC&#92;Ramírez de Arellano 15.<br/>\nMadrid<br/>\nSpain.</div>",
