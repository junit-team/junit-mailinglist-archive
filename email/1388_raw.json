However I think I would be reluctant to \n&gt; change the way my\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; code was implemented just so that I could test it, as some \n&gt; of the other\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; My experience is different. I&#39;ve found that changing my \n&gt; coding style to make it testable (which doesn&#39;t mean just \n&gt; putting in lots of unnecessary accessors) also makes it \n&gt; better. The more I apply this to different targets, such as \n&gt; shell scripts, the more I&#39;m convinced. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Steve\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I concur.  I&#39;ve found that testable code exhibits certain composable \n&gt; properties that foster interface-based design.  For example, the \n&gt; assembly of a few simple objects to perform a more complex \n&gt; task allows \n&gt; any of the objects to be mocked.  In turn, by refactoring designs to \n&gt; extract complex static relationships into interface-based \n&gt; compositions, \n&gt; the design becomes more open to extension, but closed to \n&gt; modification. \n&gt; So, I&#39;ll up the ante and claim that designs may change as a \n&gt; side effect \n&gt; of writing tests.  This is the essence of test-first design.\n&gt; \n&gt; Mike\n&gt; \n\nIf these are indeed compex relationships then it may well be the case that\nrefactoring the code is an appropriate course of action. Not all\nrelationships *are* complex! In my experience it is better to keep the code\nsimple where ever possible. I might understand what is going on - but my\ncode maintanence successors may not.\n\nChanging the code to suit your tests could quite easily cause your code to\nhave a stitled and difficult to read style - especially to less experienced\ncoders. My goal is always clarity in coding style. \n\nMatt\n\n",
