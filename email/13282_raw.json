This seems like\n&gt; simplest and most elegant solution to me.\n&gt; \n&gt; The problem though is when a test fails, you don&#39;t get any\n&gt; informartion about what field(s) that actually differed between the\n&gt; two objects. You could also implement a toString() method, but for\n&gt; large classes it&#39;s still quite hard see in the test output where the\n&gt; mismatch is.\n&gt; \n&gt; Because of this I usually write a series assertEquals(a.getFoo(),\n&gt; b.getFoo()) statements in my test case instead, event though I would\n&gt; prefer the equals() way of doing it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Does anyone have a neat solution to using the equals() method in tests\n&gt; and still get good output from the tests when something fails?\n\nThere&#39;s something in Jakarta Commons BeanUtils like &quot;describe&quot; where you \ncan take a JavaBean and get its contents as a Map. This would make it \neasier, I think, to find the part of the object that&#39;s different. You \ncould write your own custom assertion that checks the Maps key by key to \ngive you a better error message.\n\nIn general, I usually resort to pasting the toString() output into a \ntext editor and scan the strings carefully, lining them up first on two \nconsecutive lines. Not great, but considering I don&#39;t have to do it very \noften, it&#39;s not a big problem. If I have to do it often, then I usually \nhave a bigger problem to solve. :)\n-- \nJ. B.
