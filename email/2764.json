In some of my code,<br/>\nI reference classes in org.w3c.dom and org.apache.crimson. Now, as soon as<br/>\njunit came across classes from these packages, it threw class not found<br/>\nexceptions. Please note that this doesn&#39;t happen in the the textui nor my<br/>\nown testing classes, since they are both in the classpath.<br/>\n<br/>\norg.w3c.dom specifically is in the rt.jar<br/>\norg.apache.crimson is a separate jar, which is on my classpath<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter a bit of digging around in the source code, specifically in the<br/>\nTestCaseClassLoader, I found out about the junit&#92;runner&#92;exclude.properties<br/>\nfile. When I added these package names to that file, things seemed ok, and<br/>\nthose exceptions didn&#39;t take place.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat confused me was why it didn&#39;t find the classes, even though they was on<br/>\nmy classpath, especially the org.w3c ones which are in the rt.jar (with<br/>\n1.4). Furthermore, this was only a problem when using the swingui, with the<br/>\ntextui, it was fine.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve got it working now that I put those details in the exclude.properties<br/>\nfile. Is this perhaps a issue with using 1.4?<br/>\n<br/>\nAny comments or explainations?<br/>\nThanks<br/>\nAnthony</div>",
