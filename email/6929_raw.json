I&#39;ve never done serious develoment on a system\n&gt; &gt;with a lot of database code where the database wasn&#39;t changing all the\n&gt; &gt;time. But we probably just tend to work on different styles of\n&gt; projects.\n&gt; \n&gt; If I change the SQL statements, then I test the new statements as\n&gt; needed. That&#39;s why I put them in one place, to make them easier to test\n&gt; all at once and in isolation from the rest of the system.\n\nHaving read the last 20 or so messages on the subject I see a common theme:\nKeep together what changes together. However, what changes together might be\ncompletely different in different development scenarios. Two examples:\n- If you are developing a new application and you have full control over the\nDB schema, a change in the domain model will most probably entail a\ncorresponding (and easy to recognize) change in the schema and thus entail a change\nin the SQL sattements. It then makes perfect sense IMO to keep domain code and\nSQL close together (eg. in an inner class as suggested).\n- If you develop an application on top of an existing database over which\nyou have no control you probably need a dedicated layer to map your objects\nonto the RDBMS. Then the code in the three layers (domain, mapping, database)\nwill have different reasons for change, so it should be kept separately.\n\nYou&#39;re facing even more differences if you develop for 2,3 or 4 DBMS.\nMoreover, the development scenario is likely to change one day, eg. as soon as the\napplication is in production you cannot change the schema easily any more.\nThis change of situation might force you to change your policy of where to put\nyour SQL.\n\nMy point in short: There&#39;s no single best way where to put the SQL.\n\nJohannes\n\n\n-- \n+++ GMX - Mail, Messaging & more  http://www.gmx.net +++\nNEU: Mit GMX ins Internet.
