I was brainstorming and idea on the drive home from work tonight\n&gt; and realized I didn&#39;t know how to test something. This didn&#39;t come as\n&gt; a major shock, but I think I have an idea for a solution and I would\n&gt; like some devil&#39;s advocates :)\n&gt; \n&gt; Suppose the following class:\n&gt; \n&gt; public class SomeClass {\n&gt; public boolean doSomething(double x, double y) {\n&gt; double a = Math.random();\n&gt; double b = Math.random();\n&gt; return (x+a) &gt; (y+b);\n&gt; }\n&gt; }\n&gt; \n&gt; Writing a test case for this is next to impossible because you do not\n&gt; know the results of the method beforehand. But what if there were an\n&gt; interface:\n&gt; \n&gt; public interface DoubleGenerator { public double nextDouble(); }\n&gt; \n&gt; that SomeClass depends on.\n&gt; \n&gt; public class SomeClass {\n&gt; private DoubleGenerator doubleGenerator;\n&gt; //setter method\n&gt; \n&gt; public boolean doSomething(double x, double y) {\n&gt; double a = doubleGenerator.nextDouble();\n&gt; double b = doubleGenerator.nextDouble();\n&gt; return (x+a) &gt; (y+b);\n&gt; }\n&gt; }\n&gt; \n&gt; The implementation of DoubleGenerator in production code could be a\n&gt; wrapper around Math.random() and a testing implementation could allow\n&gt; you to set the sequence of doubles to return.\n&gt; \n&gt; You could also use java.util.Random instead of DoubleGenerator and\n&gt; subclass it to allow setting of the sequence, but I don&#39;t like having\n&gt; all the extra methods when SomeClass only needs one of them. However,\n&gt; having the extra methods allows for flexibility later. Opinions?\n&gt; \n&gt; Also, is setting a DoubleGenerator with two doubles good practice? For\n&gt; now, doSomething() needs two doubles, but it may need three or four\n&gt; later. Is this &quot;inside knowledge&quot; bad practice when writing tests?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks for your opinions.\n&gt; \n&gt; Michael.\n&gt; \n&gt; You should remove part of the &#39;inside knowledge&#39; aspect by passing the \nDoubleGenerator in as a parameter, to the method or to the constructor, so \nthat the inside knowledge part becomes public. Otherwise it all seems \nreasonable enough.\n\nJames\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
