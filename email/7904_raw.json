Is the expectatio=\r\nn that the error message should give all \n&gt;the information necessary to ide=\r\nntify the bug?\n&gt;\n&gt;Or is it expected that the developer have knowledege of (=\r\nor discover) \n&gt;what the test is doing? or run the test in debug mode? or ot=\r\nher?\n\nIn my experience, it depends. Some defects are easy to diagnose. Some=\r\n are instances of user error.\n\nIf you have Programmer Test coverage and QA =\r\nstill finds defects, then the programmers aren&#39;t using QA&#39;s tests, and they=\r\n probably should. QA is automating the tests, right? (I hope so.)\n\nIf QA ra=\r\nises a defect, I ask the finder to work with me to reproduce it. I then iso=\r\nlate the cause, write the appropriate missing Programmer Tests, fix the pro=\r\nblem and off we go.\n\n&gt;We are testing methods that take xml Strings as param=\r\neters and return \n&gt;xml. It would be nice to see what was passed in and what=\r\n was returned \n&gt;if anything .. even when something like a NullPointerExcept=\r\nion is \n&gt;failing the test. Also we are running the tests in different \n&gt;env=\r\nironments so a developer may not see the same error if they run \n&gt;the test =\r\nin the development environment.\n\nThis is not really a testing consideration=\r\n. It&#39;s a logging consideration, and logging is important in enterprise-scal=\r\ne applications where it is usually impossible to run your tests at the clie=\r\nnt site. I would log information at the key handoff points between componen=\r\nts. Within a component, there should be tests. Presumably you only need to =\r\nknow that XML strings are coming into a component because you fear that the=\r\ny are not what the target component expects. Consider using XML schema here=\r\n to avoid the problem.\n\n&gt;Is a separate logging mechanism the answer?\n\nIt is=\r\n, by the sound of it.\n\n\nJ. B.
