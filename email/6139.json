Therefore, the communication layer <br/>\nand the business logic layer can vary independently. Indeed, I might <br/>\ncreate a synchronous client (e.g. session bean) that uses the same <br/>\nbusiness logic encapsulated in the request handler. Coincidentally, that <br/>\nmakes it easier to unit test the business logic.<br/>\n<br/>\nI might also write a system test that actually uses JMS.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike</div>",
