This\nis a rather crude spam filter because I still get the stuff.\n\nBut I noticed that lots (but not all) of the Junit postings were being\nrouted into the spambox.  When I investigated I discovered they all had this\nin common:\n\n&gt;&gt;Tiny Wireless Camera under $80!\n&gt;&gt;Order Now!

That is fine and I don&#39;t have any\nargument with it.  But isn&#39;t it a little counter productive if it results in\nuntold e-mails never being read by the recipients?\n\nAnyway, this &quot;Only 1 Day Left!&quot; offer has been appended to e-mails for\nseveral weeks now, so either Yahoo! &#39;s marketing is, um, inexact or people\nare reusing existing e-mails for new postings, in which case it might be an\nidea to trim the verbiage from the bottom - which might explain why not all\nthe junit postings get treated as spam.\n\nI&#39;m waiting to see whether I receive this.\n\nrgds, APC\n\nA P Clarke \nConsultant\nCMG Admiral UK - Radio Spectrum International\nWyndham House \n189 Marsh Wall\nLondon \nE14 9SH\nTel: +44 (0)20 7211 0603\nFax: +44 (0)20 7211 0364\nMobile:-----------------------\nInternet communications are not secure and therefore CMG UK Ltd does not\naccept legal responsibility for the contents of this message.
