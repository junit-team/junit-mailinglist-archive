That&#39;s pretty subjective.\n \n&gt; The TestCase is taken, and by reflection is turned into a TestSuite.  So\n&gt; is it a TestCase or a TestSuite?  That is an important distinction.\n&gt; The Model is not readily apparent.  A stable and predictable model is\n&gt; essential to good design--esp. in this case.  I have no problem with\n&gt; saying that a TestCollector dynamically creates a TestSuite from a\n&gt; collection of TestCases.  That is understandable.  I do have a problem\n&gt; with the TestCase being treated as a TestSuite though.\n\nOK, I&#39;ll try to address this one.\n\nTestCase is a mechanism to allow fixture reuse.  An instance of a\nTestCase builds a fixture, runs a single test, and tears down the\nfixture. By allowing TestCase to contain multiple tests (i.e. public\nvoid testXXX() methods) you can share a fixture definition.\n\nPut another way, TestCase is NOT a way to conceptually group tests. \nEach TestCase subclass represents a fixture, and contains a group of\ntests that run in the context of that fixture. Once you realize this,\nyou&#39;ll find yourself switching (as I did some time ago) from having a\nTestCase for each class you are testing (with a overly generic fixture\nof which pieces were used by the different tests) to organizing tests\naround the fixtures, with less regard for the classes being tested by\neach TestCase.\n\nTestSuite is a mechanism for grouping a collection of TestCase instances\nand running them sequentially.  So, TestCase has the ability to create a\nTestSuite containing all instances of itself (using reflection to create\nan instance for each constituent test).  Also, you have the ability to\ncreate explicit TestSuites by subclassing TestSuite and writing a custom\nsuite() method.  This is useful for collecting together groups of\nsmaller TestSuites which can be other custom TestSuites, or TestSuites\ngenerated by TestCases.\n\nBoth TestSuite and TestCase implement the Test interface. The\nTestRunners work with things that are Tests, hence we can point at any\nTest (ie TestSuite or TestCase) and recursively run all the contained\ntests.  The internal nodes are TestSuites and the leaves are TestCases.\n\nI hope that makes things clearer.\n\nAnyone think this would make a good topic for the TDD Coad Letter?\n\nDave\n-- \nDave Astels (dave@...)\n  Coauthor of &quot;A Practical Guide to XP&quot;\n  Editor of the Test-Driven Development Edition of The Coad Letter\n    (subscribe at www.thecoadletter.com)\nCEO & Master Software Craftsman, Saorsa Development Inc.\nwww.saorsa.com\n&quot;An Agile Software Studio&quot;\n\n\n",
