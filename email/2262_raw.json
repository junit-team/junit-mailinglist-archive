For now we have to cover this somehow.\n[snip]\n\nThis quote makes me wonder what on earth the QA team is doing?  What do they\ndo with their time?  And why can&#39;t they use one of the GUI Web test tools\nfrom Mercury or Empirix to automate this?  Is it a matter of budget for the\nQA team?  Sounds a little fishy -- like &quot;We have a QA team but they don&#39;t do\nanything with free tools, and they can&#39;t afford the COTS tools to do\nanything either.&quot;\n\nSorry if I&#39;m jumping to conclusions, but your statements about the QA team\ncaught my attention.\n\nScott Stirling\nJRun QA\nMacromedia\n\n",
