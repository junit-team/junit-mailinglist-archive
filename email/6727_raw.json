(Take note that I have *not*\nasked for a reason, I have just stated that none has been given.)\n\nNot only has no reason been given, but this is a public forum, and, as\nsuch, you are going to get anyone&#39;s opinion on whatever you post.  As a\nmatter of fact, I find J.B.&#39;s comments very informative most of the\ntime, and greatly value his contribution to this, and other forums.\n\nIf you really dislike anyone&#39;s opinion on this list (it *is* allowed,\nyou know!) just don&#39;t read their posts!  That simple!\n\nI believe in civility, and usenet etiquette.\n\nManuel Amago.\nmailto:mamago@...\n\n\n",
