Usually that indicated they weren&#39;t really unit-testing.\n\nBy asking here, they were pointed in a direction of better isolating\ntheir objects under test. Even though I wouldn&#39;t consider the need for\nsuiteSetUp() a smell, it&#39;s IMHO an area for closer investigation.\n\nTherefor, in the long run, I agree with Robert Watkins in saying\nthat you can do everything with a decorator and that&#39;s enough.\nIf you are experienced enough with JUnit to write the decorator, you\nhopefully also know whether you really need to.\n\nI consider it a child safety catch.\n\nCheers,\n\nRobert\n\n-- \nWeitersagen: GMX DSL-Flatrates mit Tempo-Garantie!\nAb 4,99 Euro/Monat: http://www.gmx.net/de/go/dsl\n\n",
