While I agree with a lot of the <br/>\nJUnit philosophy, I  have one major concern with it.  Perhaps there <br/>\nare articles out there that address this, but I can&#39;t find any of <br/>\nthem.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I look into JUnit, it seems that each class either has to do one <br/>\nof the following:<br/>\n<br/>\n\textend TestCase <br/>\n\timplement Test.  <br/>\n\textend some other class that implements Test.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAs we all know, Java doesn&#39;t support multiple inheritance.  You can <br/>\nonly extend TestCase or you business class, but not both.  If you <br/>\nwant to use JUnit with a derived class, it seems you have to <br/>\nimplement a lot of methods from the TestCase interface -- which <br/>\nisn&#39;t practical.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat are some of the ways people use JUnit to test classes that are <br/>\nderived classes?   Are there splinter projects that address this <br/>\ndeficiency?  Or is JUnit a poor fit for derived classes?<br/>\n<br/>\nGlenn Robitaille</div>",
