Is this\n&gt; sufficient for your purposes or do you need to be notified when a class&#39;\n&gt; tests are about to be run and have finished running?\n&gt;\n&gt; Sincerely yours,\n&gt;\n&gt; Kent Beck\n&gt; Three Rivers Institute\n&gt;\n\nHi Kent,\n\nThat sounds promising, so I&#39;ll pull my finger out and take a more thorough\nlook at the JUnit 4 source and Java 5 stuff this weekend and try to get a\nfeel for it.\n\nMy use case for JUnit 3 was to be notified when a TestSuite that I had\ncreated, rather than an implicit one that JUnit creates for you, was about\nto start processing and had finished processing. This nicely let me capture\na hierarchical view of all the TestSuites that had run. I ended up modifying\nmy TestRunner, since I had constant known case of always having the same\nlevel of nesting for my constructed TestSuites.\n\nA quick scan of the Version4 branch found the the note in the to-do.txt file\nabout meeting the needs of runner developers! I appreciate that writing a\nTestRunner like this is a somewhat specialized activity versus everyday use,\nbut was wondering if there has been any provision in JUnit 4 for authors of\nTestRunners - could you provide any more detail about envisaged use cases?\n\nJames\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
