Along with that I&#39;d like to only start the application \nonce and run a suite. Then close the application.\n\nI&#39;ve made a subclass of JFCTestCase which has those helper functions. \nOne helper function is startApplication. If I run each test \nindividually, there is no problem. A testcase is created, I start the \napplication, it runs. I close the application done.\n\nBut if I try to separete starting the application I have threading \nissues. What I&#39;ve tried to do is startApplication, run the suite, \nthen close the application. But each time my sublcass of JFCTestCase \nis created, a new thread is created by JFCTestCase. This thread is \nthen run separately of the startApplication thread (not good). Does \nthis make sense?\n\nMy workaround was to create a class that passes in the reference to \nan object on this thread. Which works fine.\n\nSo I now:\n\nCreate MyTestCase (which does not extend JUnit in anyway.) It has \nit&#39;s own setUpo() and tearDown(). I then pass in a reference to XCase \n(which extends JUnit), and run the test. But now I&#39;m not really using \nJUnit at all. It&#39;s like I&#39;m creating my own suite object.\n\nAny ideas/help would be greatly appreciated.\n\n\n\n",
