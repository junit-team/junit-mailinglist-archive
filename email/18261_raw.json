Then again, the problem space=\r\n is \nso small\n&gt; that you can argue that no design will really be wrong anyw=\r\nay...\n&gt; \n&gt; Now consider a more realistic example, such as an application th=\r\nat \nis\n&gt; dealing with five database tables, each with four to ten columns, =\r\n\neach of\n&gt; which needs to be mapped to Java objects in a sensible way (i.e.=\r\n not\n&gt; necessarily mapping the tables and the objects one-to-one) and \nshou=\r\nld also\n&gt; include business methods and objects to make it easier to perform=\r\n\n&gt; domain-specific operations.\n&gt; \n&gt; Using TDD to drive such a design is gua=\r\nranteed to lead to an \narchitecture\n&gt; that will be focused on solving micro=\r\n-problems and that will \ntotally miss\n&gt; the big picture.  You are much bett=\r\ner off spending a few minutes \nwith a\n&gt; piece of paper or a white board to =\r\ndesign your classes and your \nobject\n&gt; diagram.\n&gt; \n&gt; If you want to use TDD=\r\n to implement this model after that, fine, \nbut I\n&gt; really dispute the idea=\r\n that TDD should drive the design in the \ngeneral\n&gt; case, because TDD simpl=\r\ny never gives you the big picture.\n&gt; \n&gt; Makes sense?\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; C=E9dric\n&gt; =\r\nhttp://testng.org\n\nWell, this IS the sort of application we&#39;re working on, =\r\nexcept that \nthere&#39;s more like 50 tables, some of which have over 150 colum=\r\nns. And \nwe did draw out a digram of how the objects were going to be, and =\r\nhow \nthey&#39;d relate to one another. This IS working, and is comprehensible \n=\r\nand proving to be a good structure to build on.\n\nNow, we did talk about TDD=\r\n, as we&#39;d heard that this was an effective \nway of working. But for the lif=\r\ne of me I can&#39;t see how you actually \ndo it in practice! I can do it on pap=\r\ner - laying down what I expect \nfrom what I&#39;m building. \nBut practically, I=\r\n can&#39;t write such a test as a Java class in Eclipse \nwithout it failing to =\r\ncompile and thus breaking our automatic build \nprocedures. The things I wan=\r\nt to test don&#39;t exist yet! And to use \nJMocks then I&#39;d need to define all t=\r\nhe ins & outs of the exact method \nnames & so on, and even then it wouldn&#39;t=\r\n even run & give me a &quot;real&quot; \nfailure &#39;cos it&#39;d complain that it&#39;s trying t=\r\no mock something that \nisn&#39;t there... \n\nSo I don&#39;t see how you can write a =\r\ntest class that has failing tests \nthat move over to passing tests as you w=\r\nrite the code, (as I see TDD \nasking for) when the thing you&#39;re testing doe=\r\nsn&#39;t exist yet. I guess \nyou could code in all the skeleton of the class, w=\r\nith the methods & \nsuch (though this won&#39;t compile unless you really do ret=\r\nurn what you \nsay you will), then write the tests, then add the rest of the=\r\n code. \nBut I don&#39;t see the great advantage of that, to be honest...\n\nCheer=\r\ns\nTracey\n\n\n\n\n",
