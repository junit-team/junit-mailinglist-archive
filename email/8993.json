I guess I got involved in the<br/>\n&gt;discussion, I thought it was (at times) useful. Since it was my first<br/>\n&gt;posting (and heck, I was throttled by moderation) how was I to know that you<br/>\n&gt;didn&#39;t want discuss on the list.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>...<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I&#39;d like to think I&#39;ve been thinking, but hmm ... let me think about that<br/>\n&gt;some more ... Yup, I&#39;m pretty sure I was. You judge so harshly yet you admit<br/>\n&gt;you deleted much of what was there. Couldn&#39;t you have just kept on deleting<br/>\n&gt;and kept this to yourself? No, I guess you want a quiet mailing list. Ok,<br/>\n&gt;you win -- I&#39;m done.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is starting to get silly, Adam, you are very thinskinned.  I was <br/>\nalso a part of those posts.  I took no offense.  Do you look for slights <br/>\nand imagined mortal insults?  I&#39;m new here too, it&#39;s not my list.  It&#39;s <br/>\ntheir list.  If you can&#39;t take the criticism, then stop talking about <br/>\nleaving and do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I understand correctly, they would like less traffic, perhaps <br/>\ninfrequent simple questions and relatively small discussions of <br/>\ninteresting tidbits.  What did occur was a rather boisterous and <br/>\nslightly heated discussion between you and JB.   I&#39;ve jumped off lists <br/>\nin the past when I kept getting 20 or thirty emails a day from them.  I <br/>\nimagine they don&#39;t want to do this.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo take it under advisement, and don&#39;t be so sensitive!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;-1 -- but hey, I clearly don&#39;t fit here. I thought I was discussing<br/>\n&gt;something of small potential with the development team of junit, but I<br/>\n&gt;clearly got that all wrong. I guess from that mistaken hypothesis all<br/>\n&gt;conclusion is obviously worthless, so I should&#39;ve just given up when I<br/>\n&gt;thought about giving up. I learned a lot from these threads, just little of it was about junit & most<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;of it was about this list&#39;s participants.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;No more noise from me...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Cry me a river...<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve all learned plenty about you. You had some good ideas, but please <br/>\ntoughen up.  We walked into their house.</div>",
