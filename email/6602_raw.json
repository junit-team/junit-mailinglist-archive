I realize that there may be\n&gt; times when you absolutely need the visual inspection (though I can&#39;t\n&gt; think of one off the bat), nevertheless, this seems like a subtle form\n&gt; of test dependencies or spaghetti code, or some other code-smell.  Sorry\n&gt; if that sounds harsh -- I am certainly not trying to be judgemental,\n&gt; just reflective.\n&gt;\n&gt; =jason\n&gt; [:question | ^One]\n&gt;\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Kendall Collett [mailto:przkiie02@...]\n&gt; Sent: Friday, January 03, 2003 12:41 PM\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: Re: [junit] Re: Conditional tearDown()\n&gt;\n&gt; I could use a conditional clean-up in tearDown, for exactly the same\n&gt; reason as Brian.\n&gt;\n&gt; When I first ran into this issue; I didn&#39;t think of trying to make the\n&gt; tearDown() clean-up conditional.  Instead, I adopted a convention of\n&gt; having my setUp()s perform the clean-up for the next test.  In other\n&gt; words, for a given test I do a pre-clean instead of a post-clean.\n&gt; I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s good or bad...\n\n\n\n",
