    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-124651372\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt;So said Adam Jack on 2003-07-25 --------------------<br/>\n </span></blockquote>&lt;snip /&gt;<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I write unit tests for the low level objects, and also for the higher level<br/>\n&gt;aggregating objects that use them. This helps me track down the cause of<br/>\n&gt;high level failures much easier. When junit detects problems and things<br/>\n&gt;fail<br/>\n&gt;I get a (sometimes long) list of failures. Finding the &quot;root cause&quot; problem<br/>\n&gt;means sifting through all the failures (including the aggregating failures)<br/>\n&gt;in order to find the problem, perhaps down in a low level class test. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>So you have two main test suites.<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Object-level tests.<br/>\n2. Integration tests.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis necessarily means that you do not have the benefit of &quot;one defect, one failure&quot;, since likely you always have &quot;one defect, at least two failures&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Since<br/>\n&gt;I can&#39;t control the order of execution (it is likely package alphabetical<br/>\n&gt;or<br/>\n&gt;something), I can&#39;t tell what is the lowest level test. I&#39;d like to reduce<br/>\n&gt;the effort invested here.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is a myth. You *can* control the order of execution of test and of test suites; you simply have to maintain suites.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I was wondering if jUnit could introduce the concept of &quot;optional test<br/>\n&gt;dependencies&quot;, test X depends upon Y -- i.e. test Y runs before test X, and<br/>\n&gt;test X runs IFF test Y succeeds.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is not something for JUnit to introduce, because it is already supported. Create a TestSuite from the specific tests you want to execute, and in the given order.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you also want the behavior of &quot;stop the presses if any test fails&quot;, then simply wrap the test methods you want to call in one big test method called &quot;myLongTest&quot; and run that one test method.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I wouldn&#39;t want to do this for every test, and it ought be user optional,<br/>\n&gt;but I could see it as being a big benefit.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You can maintain a list of tests and run them as necessary. Simple.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;P.S. The Eclipse junit plugin that search projects to find all tests, find<br/>\n&gt;tests in dependant project, but doesn&#39;t run them &quot;in the CWD of that<br/>\n&gt;project&quot; (which matters for some tests).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It shouldn&#39;t. It is best to write your tests so that it doesn&#39;t. Or your production code; whichever. Pass the desired working directory into the tests as a JVM parameter or something.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJ. B.
