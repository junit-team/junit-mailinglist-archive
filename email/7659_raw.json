If you have fear about that method working, test it.\n\nThe application code is now decoupled from how the business objects are retrieved. The application code call methods like &quot;lookupCustomer&quot;. The CustomerDirectory may be implemented with a relational database. That&#39;s fine.\n\nWhen testing the application code, mock the CustomerDirectory.\nWhen testing the CustomerDirectory, check that you generate the right SQL and your makeBusinessObject() methods work.\n\nAlmost no need to mock JDBC.\n\nTake care.\n\nSo said Jason Rogers on 4/8/2003 --------------------\nOn Tue, 2003-04-08 at 16:05, javainsel wrote: \n\n&gt; I just want to use Mock objects for the database. The test data must \n&gt; be coming\n&gt; from the test classes and not be inside the database. So we need \n&gt; Mock objects\n&gt; I think. But I don&#39;t know how to create them since I still don&#39;t \n&gt; know how\n&gt; our framework works inside and how Mock objects are used.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now you think it is not necessary that our framework supports Mock \n&gt; objects?\n\nDo you know what types of result sets you expect from the database\nlayer?  If so, mock out your database connection logic (the object that\nwould return you a java.sql.ResultSet) and have it return mock result\nsets from which you can create your business objects.  Any IDE worth its\nsalt should be able to stub the &#39;million and one&#39; methods in ResultSet\n-- then you simply implement the ones you want.  How you create those\nMockResultSet&#39;s is another story.\n\nWe have some code for doing it, but I don&#39;t know if I can release it to\nthe public (I am a contractor on this project).  If so, I will do it\nsoon, if not I will see if I have time to mock one up and share it with\nthe group (perhaps Junit-Addons?).  The basic idea we have here for\ncreating our MockResultSet&#39;s is to create them with column names and\nvalues.  They can be single-row or multi-row sets.  Basically, we\nimplemented the navigation methods that we needed (i.e. next()) and the\ngetXYZ() methods that we needed (i.e. getString(...), getInt(...),\ngetLong(...), getDate(...)).\n\nHope that helps.\n=jason\n\n\nYahoo!
