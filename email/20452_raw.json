The theme of TAIC PART is\n   &quot;transferring software testing technology from academia to\n   industry.&quot;  TAIC PART aims to forge collaborations between industry\n   and academia.  The goals of TAIC PART 2008 include the articulation\n   of fundamental research questions in the field of software testing\n   and analysis.  TAIC PART also focuses on the practical challenges\n   that are often faced by software developers in industry.\n\n-----------------\n  Call for Papers\n-----------------\n\n   TAIC PART 2008 solicits experience, tool, original research,\n   industry challenge, and academic challenge papers that explore\n   software testing and analysis techniques.  Research topics include,\n   but are not limited to, the following areas:\n    \n     Test Adequacy Criteria\n     Test Suite Execution\n     Test Coverage Monitoring\n     Automated Test Data Generation\n     Regression Testing\n     Automated Debugging and Fault Localization\n     Performance Evaluation\n     Static and Dynamic Analysis\n     Verification and Validation\n     Software Reliability Engineering\n     Model-Based Testing\n     Testing and Formal Methods\n     Testing and Model Checking\n     Software Testing Process\n     Technology Transfer\n\n   TAIC PART solicits papers that focus on the testing and analysis of\n   software applications that include, but are not limited to, the\n   following types:\n\n     Embedded and Real-Time Systems\n     Operating Systems \n     Parallel, Distributed, and Cluster Applications\n     Service-Oriented Software Systems\n     Web Applications\n     Event-Based Systems\n     File and Storage Systems\n     Virtual Machine-Based Applications\n     Database Applications\n     XML Processing Systems\n     Graphical User Interfaces\n     Wireless Sensor Networks\n     Safety Critical Systems\n     AI and Machine Learning Systems\n     Business Applications\n\n-----------------\n  Types of Papers\n-----------------\n\n    - Experience reports should provide practical and generalizable\n      insights into how to apply and extend existing approaches to\n      software testing and analysis. \n\n    - Tool papers must focus on the design, implementation, and\n      evaluation of software testing and analysis tools. \n\n    - Original Research papers will explore novel software testing\n      techniques.  These papers should furnish a detailed theoretical\n      and/or empirical evaluation of the proposed approach.\n\n    - Industry Challenge papers must have at least one author whose\n      affiliation in non-academic.  These papers will describe a\n      real-world software testing problem for which help is sought\n      from the academic research community. \n\n    - Academic Challenge papers must have at least one author\n      whose affiliation in non-industry.  These papers should explain\n      a software testing research problem for which help is sought\n      from industry partners. \n\n------------------\n  Paper Evaluation\n------------------\n\n    All papers will undergo a rigorous examination by at least\n    three members of the program committee. The Program Co-Chairs and\n    the Program Committee will provide thoughtful and fair reviews\n    that furnish detailed insights into ways for improving and\n    extending the papers.  All submitted papers will be\n    evaluated according to (i) relevance to the conference themes and\n    goals and (ii) clarity and organization. \n\n    - Experience reports will be evaluated with respect to the\n      significance and generality of the described testing experience.\n\n    - Research and tool papers will be judged by the technical merit,\n      novelty, and evaluation of the described technique or tool.\n\n    - Industry and academic challenge papers will be assessed\n      according to their ability to forge partnerships and ultimately\n      yield successful solutions.\n\n    The results described in the submitted paper must be unpublished\n    and should not be under review at other workshops, conferences, or\n    journals.\n \n------------------\n  Paper Formatting\n------------------\n\n    Papers should be formatted using the IEEE conference style\n    format. Including all references and figures, a research paper\n    must not exceed the ten page limit and the experience, tool, and\n    industry and academic challenge papers should not be longer than\n    five pages.  Papers should have an abstract that is no longer than\n    150 words. Please be aware that if your paper is accepted, the\n    abstract may appear in the advance program and on the TAIC PART\n    2008 Web site. Authors should submit a PDF version of their paper\n    using the conference submission system.  More details about paper\n    submission will be posted to the TAIC PART Web site in the near\n    future.\n\n----------------------\n  Workshop Proceedings\n----------------------\n\n    The accepted papers will be published with ISBN by the IEEE\n    Computer Society and they will appear in the IEEE digital library.\n    The presentations for all of the accepted papers will also be\n    provided for download on the TAIC PART 2008 Web site.  The\n    Conference Chair and Program Co-Chairs intend to arrange a journal\n    special issue that contains extended and revised versions of\n    selected papers from TAIC PART 2008.\n\n-----------------\n  Important Dates\n-----------------\n\n          May 2, 2008 :     Abstract Submission\n          May 9, 2008 :     Paper Submission\n         June 6, 2008 :     Author Notification\n        June 21, 2008 :     Camera-Ready Copy\n   August 29-31, 2008 :     TAIC PART 2008\n\n-------------------------\n  Conference Organization\n-------------------------\n\n    Conference Chair:\n      Marc Roper, University of Strathclyde\n\t\t\t\t  \n    Program Co-Chairs:\n      Leonardo Botacci, University of Hull \t\n      Gregory M.
