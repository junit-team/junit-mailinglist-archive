This,\n&gt; IMHO, is the true nature of *unit* tests.  What you want to know is that\n&gt; your code responds to the environment in the expected way.\n&gt;\nYour SQL is code and it also need to be unit tested. This cannot be done\nwith mock\nobjects. It needs to be executed by something which understands SQL. If\nnecessary\nyou can try to make this layer as thin as possible and abstract enough to\nsubstitute with\nmock objects at the next level up.\n\n&gt; Thus you create mock objets for a faulty database: method call throws\n&gt; exception; a normal db call: the method returns a valid response; etc.\n&gt;\nThat is an advantage of mock objects. I would use a mixture of mock and real\nin the same test class.\n\nMock objects have there place. I have used them recently to test servlets\nwithout\na container and to test that Swing models fire events. I don&#39;t think all\nJDBC tests\nshould be done with mock objects however.\n\n&gt; This gives you complete control over the responses you expect from the\n&gt; environment, and allow you to test your code under expected conditions.\n&gt; It also means that your unit test suite will be a lot faster.\n&gt;\nBut maybe the tests are fast enough even when they exercise the whole\nsystem from end to end. I did my ejb testing in container using a real\ndatabase and my tests weren&#39;t too slow.\n\nI had similar thoughts to David. My motivation was working from home when I\ndidn&#39;t have access to the database but would still like to execute as many\ntests as possible.\nOther classes of test might be long running stress tests.\n\n-- Neil Swingler\n\n\n",
