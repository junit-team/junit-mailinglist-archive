My point was that the way to test a constructor is to test \nthe re=\r\nsults of its behavior. In most cases, it you create an \ninstance of the obj=\r\nect as a fixture in your setUp, you will end up \ntesting the constructor in=\r\n conjuntion with the other tests.\n\nIn my earlier programs, I tended to do a=\r\n lot in my constructors. Now \nas I am focusing more on testability, I am mo=\r\nving away from that \napproach.\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, Andrew McDona=\r\ngh &lt;yahoogroups@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; whitworthjanet wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Since the constr=\r\nuctor takes two parameters, it must do something \n&gt; &gt; with them. I would te=\r\nst that it actually does what it should \nwith \n&gt; &gt; them. If it sets member =\r\nvariables, were they set, etc.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   \n&gt; \n&gt; If all they do is that, then=\r\n I wouldn&#39;t bother.  This will be \ntested \n&gt; implicitly within every other =\r\ntestcases that use the class.\n&gt; \n&gt; Besides, we&#39;d then need someway to check=\r\n they were set, creating \n&gt; getters, etc., which we probably wouldn&#39;t need.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; If the Responsibility of the Constructor was to validate the  \nvalues=\r\n, by \n&gt; throwing an exception say, then I&#39;d write an explicit test for \ntha=\r\nt.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
