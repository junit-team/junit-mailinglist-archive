Are they running in the \napplication server (using Cactus)?  \n&gt; \n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: safamack [mailto:safamack@y...]\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, October 02, 2003 2:09 PM\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: [junit] DataSource-Webshpere (Junit Problem)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Hello Everyone:\n&gt; Since I have received no reply, I assume my previous posting was \nnot \n&gt; clear. I try to be clearer with my problem.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have a method getConnection that uses a datasource to get a \n&gt; connection from the connection buffer pool with the websphere \n&gt; application server. I have some other methods that call this \nmethod. \n&gt; \n&gt; if those methods are called by a jsp or a servlet running on the \n&gt; server then everything is fine. However, when any of those method \nare \n&gt; called by a Junit method, then getConnection fails. I need to say \n&gt; that my JUnit tests also reside within the same web application \n&gt; workspace in wsad.\n&gt; \n&gt; If it comes to worst,I can write a getConnectionMock method that \nuses \n&gt; a jdbc to get a connection but that means everytime I test my code, \nI \n&gt; need to change the source code.\n&gt; \n&gt; Is there a way around it, I would really appreciate your replies in \n&gt; advance.\n&gt; \n&gt; regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
