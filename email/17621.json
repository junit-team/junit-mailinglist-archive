First, the naming convention tells<br/>\n&gt; you that a method is a constructor. Understanding Java should tell you<br/>\n&gt; everything you need to know about why that method is there. A<br/>\n&gt; constructor&#39;s job is to ensure that an object is usable and &quot;ready to<br/>\n&gt; rock&quot; when it&#39;s handed off. Part of an object being &quot;ready to rock&quot;,<br/>\n&gt; is that it should be fully loaded and in a guaranteed valid state.<br/>\n&gt; Telling people to do the least amount possible in a constructor is<br/>\n&gt; encouraging them to hand out objects that are (potentially) in an<br/>\n&gt; invalid internal state. That will get you a &quot;reading of the riot act&quot;<br/>\n&gt; on any project that I&#39;m leading. An object must _always_ have a valid<br/>\n&gt; internal state. As programs run in more and more multithreaded<br/>\n&gt; environments these days, this rule becomes even more important. You<br/>\n&gt; _never_ know when your object might be accessed, therefore it should<br/>\n&gt; _always_ be ready for access.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You know, I almost said this myself, but I think point 5 implicitly <br/>\naddresses this. I suspect this could be made a little clearer in the <br/>\narticle, but I&#39;m not really sure the author and you actually disagree here.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Point five. I agree up to a point. There will always be some things<br/>\n&gt; that need to be done in specific sequences. Opening and closing files<br/>\n&gt; leaps to mind at this point.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>However this can conflict with your response to point 1. What if a <br/>\nconstructor needs to open a file? And for that matter why do files have <br/>\nto be opened anyway? Perhaps file writes and reads should auto-open and <br/>\nclose files as necessary. We used to think we had to explicitly allocate <br/>\nand free memory, but we don&#39;t do that any more. Why do we treat files <br/>\nthe same way?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n﻿Elliotte Rusty Harold  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:elharo@...\">elharo@...</a><br/>\nJava I/O 2nd Edition Just Published!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafeaulait.org/books/javaio2/\">http://www.cafeaulait.org/books/javaio2/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596527500/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/\">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596527500/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/</a></div>",
