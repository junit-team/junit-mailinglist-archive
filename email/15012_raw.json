Unfortunately, I cannot see how to do this with log4j since\nit is a class rather than an interface.\n\nAny help appreciated!\n\nThanks\n\nRakesh\n\nPS I am using the 1.3 alpha release version of log4j which has a bug -\nlogger creation always logs even when you turn logging off.\n\n\nAmerican Express Investments and American Express Independent Financial Advisers are marketing names for American Express Financial Services Europe Limited, a separate corporation within the American Express group of companies.
