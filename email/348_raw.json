Using Shutdown Hooks \n 2. Automating GUI Programs with java.awt.Robot&quot;\n\nThis article illustrates the use of the java.awt.Robot class provided \nas part of swing 1.3 to simulate keystrokes.\n\nFrom the javadoc:\n\n&quot;This class is used to generate native system input events for the \npurposes of test automation, self-running demos, and other \napplications where control of the mouse and keyboard is needed. The \nprimary purpose of Robot is to facilitate automated testing of Java \nplatform implementations. \n\nUsing the class to generate input events differs from posting events \nto the AWT event queue or AWT components in that the events are \ngenerated in the platform&#39;s native input queue. For example, \nRobot.mouseMove will actually move the mouse cursor instead of just \ngenerating mouse move events. \n\nNote that some platforms require special privileges or extensions to \naccess low-level input control. If the current platform configuration \ndoes not allow input control, an AWTException will be thrown when \ntrying to construct Robot objects. For example, X-Window systems will \nthrow the exception if the XTEST 2.2 standard extension is not \nsupported (or not enabled) by the X server. &quot;\n\n\nHope this helps too.\n\nI&#39;m using it right now to write a small test for my swing GUI.\n\n\n\nAlec\n\n\n",
