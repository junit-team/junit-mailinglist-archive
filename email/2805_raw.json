Do you have a specific example in mind of how a\n&gt; TestSetup\n&gt; &gt; indicated that something was wrong.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m wondering if the OP&#39;s problem isn&#39;t similar. Reading a properties\n&gt; file is expensive, so we only want to do it once for a bunch of\n&gt; tests. Well, what if you explicitly passed the properties you need to\n&gt; the methods that need them?\n\n\nActually, what Avalon is doing is a bit more expensive than reading a\nproperties file.  The configuration data is in an XML format, that\ngets read and turned into a Configuration object tree.  From this\ntree, the test environment&#39;s Context is populated, the Logger hierarchy\nis set up, and the ComponentManager is populated with the Components\nthat we will be testing.  This ensures that the Components play well\nwith the rest of the system that has been well tested and run under\nload.\n\nThe TestCases we have then lets each test run against this setup.\nThe way I have &quot;bent&quot; the JUnit framework to work with mine works\nfor this solution.  Basically my test environment is set up once\nper TestCase object and torn down once per TestCase object.  Each\nTestCase needs to have its own environment so this works well.\n\n",
