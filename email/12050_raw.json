Any experiences?\n\nThis is untrue. Plenty has been written on the subject; however, you \nmight not be looking in the right places. On the extremeprogramming \nYahoo! group we talk about adding tests to existing code all the time. :)\n\nMichael Feathers is completing a book entitled &quot;Working Effectively with \nLegacy Code&quot; which contains hundreds of pages of advice in this \ndirection. I spent most of yesterday afternoon talking about this with a \nclient and his programming group. Let me summarize my description:\n\n1. Test-drive all new code, including new features and defect fixes.\n2. For each defect fix:\n    a. Use the debugger to locate the defective line of code.\n    b. Extract the defective line of code to a separate class.\n    c. Test-drive a replacement for that class.\n    d. Change the existing code /delicately/ to invoke the newly \ntest-driven replacement.\n\nOver time, you replace the old code with new, tested code. It might take \nyears, but each time you replace untested code with tested code, you get \ncloser to a 100% tested system.\n\nWhat you must /not/ do is try to add 100% test coverage to the current \nsystem starting day 1. That just loses money.\n\nGood luck.\n\n-- \nJ. B. (Joe) Rainsberger\nLet&#39;s write software that people understand\nDiaspar Software Services :: http://www.diasparsoftware.com\n\n\n",
