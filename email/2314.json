Granted, not a very nice <br/>\n&gt; solution unless,<br/>\n&gt; perhaps, it were easier to modify the exclusion list.  I hear <br/>\n&gt; in JUnit 4.0<br/>\n&gt; that one idea is to make it easy to define exclusions in TestCases<br/>\n&gt; themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hi,<br/>\nI was getting a ClassCastException with my EJBHome stubs and came <br/>\nacross this mail. It solved this particular problem. Thanks!<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course I have another problem. My client and EJB classes share <br/>\nsome common classes. When the client makes an EJB call and the bean  <br/>\nreturns these common classes, I get another ClassCastException. These <br/>\nare not home stubs but just ordinary Java classes. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou had mentioned in your solution that we need to exclude the EJB <br/>\ninterface classes. Does this mean I should exclude the EJB interface <br/>\nclasses *alone*. Currently I&#39;m excluding every class in the EJB <br/>\npackage from being loaded under the assumption that what is true for <br/>\nthe EJB interfaces should be valid for the other classes too ... Or <br/>\nam I wrong?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, is this behavior specific to the JUnit 3.7 release?<br/>\nAny input would be appreciated!<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n--Das</div>",
