It looks like someone started to do some \nrefactoring and never finished.  The extenstions, framework, and \nrunner packages have all been moved under the junit.tests, but the \nimport statements and inline references in the code have not been \nupdated to match.  Is there a simple solution to this?\n\n\n\n",
