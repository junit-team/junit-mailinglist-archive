I have one unit <br/>\n&gt; testcase for each action.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I would call these &quot;unit tests&quot; or &quot;developer tests&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Now im sitting and doing some HTTP-Unit testing of the whole <br/>\n&gt; http server, trying to login, logoff, etc. I start the server <br/>\n&gt; and connect to it as a real HTTP client, to test the functionality.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I would call these &quot;acceptance tests&quot; or &quot;customer tests&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; What is the &quot;right&quot; amount of testing, is it best to do the <br/>\n&gt; same test but on different levels in order to make sure that <br/>\n&gt; NO strange behaviour is discovered or should I just test the <br/>\n&gt; whole flow?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think it&#39;s all about choosing what &quot;level&quot; you want to be testing at<br/>\nany given moment in time.  Remember you need all these different types<br/>\nof tests to ensure that the application does what the customer wants<br/>\n(and that you are happy that it can provide these features).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy are you now testing with HTTP-Unit?  Is it to see if the application<br/>\n(rather than individual class) is working as the customer wants?  The<br/>\nanswer to that question might indicate whether you are on the right<br/>\ntrack.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps!<br/>\n<br/>\nAndy.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nAndrew Beacock<br/>\nLammtara</div>",
