Testi=\r\nng the classes in isolation seems next to impossible.\n&gt; \n&gt; Some people will=\r\n be quick to jump in and say that this must be a\n&gt; fundamental problem with=\r\n my design.. my classes shouldn&#39;t be so\n&gt; dependent on each other, or somet=\r\nhing similar.    In some (trivial)\n&gt; cases it is possible to write stand al=\r\none classes, and they are\n&gt; fairly easy to test in isolation.  But a comple=\r\nx application needs\n&gt; all sorts of classes that bind trivial bits together.=\r\n.. and these\n&gt; classes must rely on the very classes that they are causing =\r\nto work\n&gt; together.\n&gt; \n&gt; I find that it is these classes that are difficult=\r\n to\n&gt; compartmentalize where most of my bugs tend to show up anyway, but of=\r\n\n&gt; course not always.   How do you unit test such beasts?\n&gt; \n\nDo you know w=\r\nww.mockobjects.com ?\nHave your classes depend on interfaces (and not on oth=\r\ner classes)\nand implement the interfaces with mock objects.\n\nThis should he=\r\nlp to make test setup more easy.\n\nYou may want to have a look at \nhttp://ww=\r\nw.clarkware.com/software/JDepend.html\nhttp://www.objectmentor.com/publicati=\r\nons/oodmetrc.pdf\n\n&gt; So I&#39;m asking... Who else has been down this path?  How=\r\n do I get past\n&gt; this point?   Am I making sense or have I just gotten some=\r\nthing\n&gt; completely wrong? Or is this unit testing just a passing fad that i=\r\ns\n&gt; really nothing more than a bunch of hype?\n\nIt works realy well for me, =\r\nso IMHO it is much more that a hype.\n\nWhen I started unit testing I found i=\r\nt difficult or impossible to test some \nfunctionality of my classes. I real=\r\nized that I could easily extract such \nuntestable functionality into a new =\r\nclass which was easily unit-testable.\nIn the end the design comes out clear=\r\ner, without thinking much about design\nwhile trying to make the code testab=\r\nle.\n\nNext step would be TDD, I guess with TDD I would never had put too muc=\r\nh\nresponsability into a specific class.\n\nBernd\n\n\n\n\n\n",
