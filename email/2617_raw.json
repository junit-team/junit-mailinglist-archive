Unfortunately, my team has found that we\nmust run our tests inside of the weblogic application server to work around\nseveral bugs. One in particular concerns the way CLOBs are dealt with by\nJDBC and RMI. To keep the JDBC driver from making an RMI call we had to be\nrunning within the application server itself. Additionally, the transaction\nand JNDI services provided by weblogic are integral to our application and\nnot exactly easy to stub out or replace. In the end, running within the\napplication server was simpler than running apart from it. I would like to\nseparate ourselves from weblogic at some point so if anyone else has\nencountered these same problems I would be interested in hearing how you\ndealt with them...\n\nChris Eppstein\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: David Roussel [mailto:dir@...]\nSent: Friday, September 07, 2001 1:44 AM\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: RE: [junit] Need help\n\n\nJust write unit tests using junit to test objects in isolation.  Once\nyou have many tests for all you separate functionality, then think about\nhow to test inside a application server.\n\nGenerally testing inside an application server is more difficult and\nshould not be your first goal for unit testing.\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Alagusundaram Paulraj [mailto:apaulra@...]\nSent: 06 September 2001 20:48\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: Re: [junit] Need help\n\n\nJason\n      Thanks for detailed mail.In my project they have already test\ncases for java programs.Our application have\n4 layers we are using weblogic.\n\nI am struck up with environment setup on Jbuilder to test with Junit in\nweblogic server.\n\nI am using Windows NT m/c\n\n\n\nJason Rogers wrote:\n\n&gt; A.P.\n&gt;\n&gt; There is a lot of documentation and plenty of examples hanging around\nthat\n&gt; would give you a place to start.  Look at JUnit&#39;s tests for instance.\nLook\n&gt; at the sample Money tests that are published with JUnit.  Go to\njunit.org,\n&gt; or the junit wiki, or the SourceForge site, etc.  I think it would be\na good\n&gt; idea for you to try learning what you can from the documentation and\n&gt; examples that already exist, then, when you have more specific\nquestions,\n&gt; ask the group.\n&gt;\n&gt; It isn&#39;t that we are unwilling to answer questions, it&#39;s just that I\nthink\n&gt; most people expect that new comers will put forth some effort in\naddressing\n&gt; the learning curve.  Personaly, I don&#39;t expect you to make yourself\n&gt; completely versed in JUnit, I simply expect you to familiarize\nyourself with\n&gt; the product enough to be able to ask intelligent questions about it.\n&gt;\n&gt; Try to understand what an Assert is, what a TestCase is, what a\nTestResult\n&gt; is, what a TestRunner is...  These are the basics.  (Actually, you\ncould\n&gt; even skip TestResult for now.)  Then, if you have a class that you\nalready\n&gt; know you want to write tests for (or you are doing test first design\nand\n&gt; have an idea of the class you will be writing) tell us about it.  We\nwill\n&gt; then have a common language for describing how to write the tests --\nJUnit&#39;s\n&gt; framework!\n&gt;\n&gt; I hope you don&#39;t take this email offensively.  I understand that it is\n&gt; sometimes overwhelming to learn a new product (JUnit), not to mention\na new\n&gt; paradigm (unit testing or testing in general).  I only hope to guide\nyou to\n&gt; some possible good starting places.\n&gt;\n&gt; -Jason\n&gt;\n&gt;     &gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt;     &gt; From: Alagusundaram Paulraj [mailto:apaulra@...]\n&gt;     &gt; Sent: Friday, August 31, 2001 12:31 PM\n&gt;     &gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;     &gt; Subject: Re: [junit] Need help\n&gt;     &gt;\n&gt;     &gt;\n&gt;     &gt; I also need to know how to write test cases in Java using Junit\n&gt;     &gt;\n&gt;     &gt; Pankaj Solanki wrote:\n&gt;     &gt;\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; Hello, I am a newcomer to testing world.I will be using\n&gt;     &gt; JUnit3.7 tool\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; for unit testing.
