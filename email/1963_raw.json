As a matter of fact VisualAge Websphere Test environment is a real snail & lookups can take sometimes many seconds. My problem is the fact that the potential real issue is the latency in the response. \n\nI was wandering if someone could help in defining a way to avoid the overhead of the System.currentTimemillis() coded in the JunitPerf. On the production environment the biggest part of the response time is divided in three parts - believe - : \n  1. CurrentTime access\n  2. Naming access\n  3. CurrentTime access\n\nTo reduce the influence of the timing, I can loop the Naming Access, but then I get the caching kicking in.\n\nIf someone had an hint to keep the test as simple as possible (no looping on all the Names to access)...\n\nTx,\n\nThomas,\n\n\n\n",
