Agiletest differs from \n&gt; other mock object implementations in that it operates at the bytecode\n&gt; \n&gt; level. Other implementations are generally based on either \n&gt; straightforward source-code generation, or the insertion of a dynamic\n&gt; \n&gt; proxy. The former approach increases the number of artefacts in your \n&gt; development project (which must also be kept in synchronisation with \n&gt; development) whilst the latter is limited to the mocking of \n&gt; interfaces. The upshot is that, using AgileTest, it is possible to \n&gt; create mocks (or Imposters) of classes as well as interfaces, without\n&gt; \n&gt; requiring source code for the class under test and without generating\n&gt; \n&gt; a pile of additional source files. \n&gt; \n&gt; AgileTest also includes another neat feature - Interlopers - which \n&gt; allows for dynamic object substitution at any point in the class \n&gt; under test, allowing for comprehensive mock-based testing of non \n&gt; parameterized object collaborations. This means that common \n&gt; programming idioms like static factory calls, or JNDI InitialContext \n&gt; calls in EJBs, can now be successfully mocked. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
