That being said the flavor of the day is definitely Squeak,\nan open source implementation of the Smalltalk-80 system (www.squeak.org\n-- a minimal front-end to the community).  As far as IDEs go, Smalltalk\nwas and continues to be the leader for many reasons, but since this\nisn&#39;t a Smalltalk list, I will leave it there to whet your appetite.  By\nthe way, in case you didn&#39;t know, JUnit is the Java equivalent of the\noriginal XUnit testing framework by Kent Beck called SUnit (Smalltalk\nUnit), and Squeak is fully up-to-date with the latest and greatest on\nthat front as well.\n\n=jason\n[:question | ^One] \n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Adelbert Groebbens [mailto:adelbert.groebbens@...] \nSent: Monday, December 16, 2002 5:10 PM\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: RE: [junit] OT: OO Newcomer\n\n\nHere is a list of books and resources I&#39;ve found very inspirational\n(the numbers indicate an ordening in terms of phases).\n\nJava seems to me one of the most suitable languages for concentrating on\nlearning OO.\n\nUnit testing and refactoring are also very advisable techniques to use\nand\nknow about as soon as possible.\n\n(Furthermore, using ANT and a nice IDE like IntelliJ IDEA should settle\nyou\nfor a pleasant OO cruise.)\n\n(*) is probably one of the best introductions to OO\n\n  a.. book: Design Patterns, (GoF) (2)\n  b.. book: Craig Larman, &quot;Applying UML and Patterns&quot; (2) (*)\n  c..

I hope you will\nforgive\n  my impertinence.  ;)\n  But, I greatly value the opinions of the people on this list, and I\ntrust\n  your opinion on this particular issue.\n\n  --------------------------------------------------------------------\n  mail2web - Check your email from the web at\n  http://mail2web.com/ .\n\n\n\n  To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n  junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n\n\n  Your use of Yahoo!
