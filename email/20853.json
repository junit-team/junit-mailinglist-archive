I hadn&#39;t<br/>\nthought of this and people often forget to mention it. Of course, this has a<br/>\ngreat effect on the tools you end up using.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I agree regarding the combinatorial explosion problem. I had to write<br/>\na Lexer for a toy programming language in one of my courses and having a<br/>\nunit test for each input pattern helped to narrow down problems so quickly<br/>\nthat I finished in ~3 hours!<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople here at varsity also seldom miss the point about testing scope. They<br/>\nseem to assume that every level of testing will always be used, and teach<br/>\naccordingly. I think it&#39;s important to note that this is not always<br/>\nneccessary.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the distinction you made between integration tests and larger<br/>\nscale ones. I think I understand a little better where the boundaries lie :)<br/>\n<br/>\n2008/9/4 lancezant &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lancezant@...\">lancezant@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   Hi Jan,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I agree, and as you touch on the idea of acceptance tests, you come<br/>\n&gt; close to the one point I&#39;d add. Besides running time and number of<br/>\n&gt; failures, the other distinguishing feature of acceptance tests is that<br/>\n&gt; the interacts often cross the system&#39;s boundary. By that I mean input<br/>\n&gt; comes through non-java interfaces such as GUIs, message systems, etc.<br/>\n&gt; and output involve more side effects (i.e. go to places other than<br/>\n&gt; back to the source). In some cases, these can be shoehorned into a<br/>\n&gt; Java interface (e.g. httpunit) but this is often where the need for<br/>\n&gt; other tools comes in.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The reason for fine-grained testing is that large-grained tests are<br/>\n&gt; overwhelmed by combinatoric explosion of conditions long before they<br/>\n&gt; achieve reasonable coverage. The &quot;unit&quot; is usually a single class.<br/>\n&gt; The system can be tens to thousands of classes. For small systems,<br/>\n&gt; the gap may be small enough that unit and acceptance tests are<br/>\n&gt; sufficient.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Often, however, it is useful to have integration tests in between. By<br/>\n&gt; testing clusters of collaborating classes, integration tests can<br/>\n&gt; further reduce the number of acceptance tests needed to achieve<br/>\n&gt; reasonable coverage. The thing integration tests have in common with<br/>\n&gt; unit tests is that by being entirely within the system boundary, they<br/>\n&gt; can reuse much of the Java infrastructure, including JUnit, mock<br/>\n&gt; objects, etc.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Best regards,<br/>\n&gt; Lance<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a> &lt;junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt;, &quot;Jan Kroeze&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;thejcwk@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hi!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I think this summarises quite neatly what a couple of people have<br/>\n&gt; said,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; namely that switching to a dedicated framework from JUnit is only<br/>\n&gt; neccessary<br/>\n&gt; &gt; if there are quite a few / complicated integration tests.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I happen to agree with this, since introducing more and more<br/>\n&gt; frameworks into<br/>\n&gt; &gt; your project just for testing will certainly drive many programmers<br/>\n&gt; up the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; walls. You have to be certain the cost is worth the pay off :) Yet,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; especially with user acceptance testing, I have to side with going<br/>\n&gt; with a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; new framework, if simply for the reason that the client should be<br/>\n&gt; able to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; read them.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 2008/9/3 kentb &lt;kentb@...&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Jan,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; You can use JUnit for longer-running tests, but there are some<br/>\n&gt; assumptions<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; JUnit embodies that will cause some problems. JUnit assumes tests<br/>\n&gt; are<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; atomic--they run or don&#39;t run, they run in unit time. Integration<br/>\n&gt; tests<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; often take a long time to run, so interim feedback is valuable.<br/>\n&gt; Integration<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; tests can usefully have multiple failures, where that is less<br/>\n&gt; common with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; unit tests. OTOH, tests are tests--independent self-checking bits<br/>\n&gt; of code<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that run and get reported--and for that part of running<br/>\n&gt; integration tests<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; JUnit works fine.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; It seems to me to be a tradeoff between the simplicity of running<br/>\n&gt; all tests<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; as JUnit tests and the challenges of getting the integration tests<br/>\n&gt; to run<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; as<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; JUnit tests. Different contexts will requires different solutions.<br/>\n&gt; If I had<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a few integration tests, I&#39;d make them work with JUnit. If I had a<br/>\n&gt; large<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; suite of integration tests that played a prominent role in<br/>\n&gt; development, I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; would use some other tool and integrate my unit testing results<br/>\n&gt; with the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; integration results.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Regards,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Kent Beck<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Three Rivers Institute<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; _____<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a> &lt;junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt; &lt;junit%<br/>\n&gt; 40yahoogroups.com&gt; [mailto:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a> &lt;junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt; &lt;junit%<br/>\n&gt; 40yahoogroups.com&gt;] On Behalf Of Jan<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Kroeze<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sent: Tuesday, September 02, 2008 1:05 AM<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a> &lt;junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt; &lt;junit%<br/>\n&gt; 40yahoogroups.com&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: [junit] JUnit And Larger Scale Tests<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi all!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m a bit of a newb to the whole TDD thing, but I understand that<br/>\n&gt; unit<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; tests<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; are supposed to be blazingly fast and not access the hard drive,<br/>\n&gt; network,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; database or anything external to the code itself. To this end, I<br/>\n&gt; understand<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that a framework such as jMock can be used.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; So far, so good. But I find JUnit to be extremely useful for<br/>\n&gt; writing<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; integration, system and user acceptance tests as well.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Here&#39;s my question: what is the official position of the JUnit<br/>\n&gt; community on<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; using JUnit to do larger scale tests? Is there a better framework,<br/>\n&gt; or is it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; common practice to use JUnit for these tests as well?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Jan Kroeze<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; --<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Jan Kroeze<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>-- <br/>\nJan Kroeze<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
