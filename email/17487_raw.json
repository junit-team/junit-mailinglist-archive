In fact, =\r\nI&#39;ve been consulting at Hertz for 4 years. In that time we have rewritten m=\r\nost of their reservations systems from COBOL to Java AND retrained a majori=\r\nty of their COBOL programmers to use Java.\n \nAnd guess what? We use interfa=\r\nces. You know what else we use:\n- Spring\n- Hibernate\n- JUnit (our base refe=\r\nrence architecture has roughly 2900 unit tests and raising)\n- AspectJ\n- Con=\r\ntinuous Integration\n- ...\n \nSo here&#39;s a bunch (right now about 60 people wo=\r\nrking on roughly 6 active projects, with 9 projects already in production a=\r\nnd being used in the field) of former COBOL programmers using interfaces, J=\r\nUnit, Inversion of Control, all those &quot;pie in the sky book things&quot;.\n \nI do =\r\nagree with some of what you are saying. Not everything should have an inter=\r\nface. But that&#39;s based on the granularity of the thing in question.\n \nI als=\r\no think, for the most part, that writing unit tests for a trivial Java Bean=\r\n is questionable. \n \nHowever, as soon as you start using things like Spring=\r\n, using interfaces buys you a bunch. You can, for example, get automatic tr=\r\nansactional demarcation based on a simple configuration. You can accomplish=\r\n this without using interfaces (so long as the class is not also final), bu=\r\nt it&#39;s a matter of whether you want to use proxies or classes generated usi=\r\nng CGLIB.\n \nAnything that I might want to test that depends on some externa=\r\nl source of information (database, message queue, ...), using an interface =\r\n(which you&#39;re probably doing anyway) really makes something testable in iso=\r\nlation. And it adds a lot of value.\n \nThat&#39;s NOT pie in the sky, that&#39;s bas=\r\ned on actual experience in the field working with developers of vastly vary=\r\ning skills.\n \nTutorials and Articles\n     http://schuchert.wikispaces.com/\n=\r\n\n\n\n----- Original Message ----\nFrom: Elliotte Harold &lt;elharo@...=\r\nu&gt;\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSent: Thursday, August 17, 2006 5:09:45 AM\nSub=\r\nject: Re: [junit] Test-friendly, but not caller-friendly?\n\nC=C3=A9dric Beus=\r\nt =E2=99=94 wrote:\n\n&gt; This goes against my direct experience and against th=\r\ne widely accepted\n&gt; recommendations that have emerged in the Java world the=\r\nse past years.\n\nIf I recall, your most recent direct experience is at Googl=\r\ne, and given \nthe people Google is hiring these days, I&#39;m not surprised tha=\r\nt&#39;s what \nyou see. Google&#39;s a hotbed of the sort of programmers who like to=\r\n read \nand write books about OO theory and language design. But most of the=\r\n \nworld is not Google.\n\nThere are certainly widely promulgated recommendati=\r\nons to use \ninterfaces. I&#39;m not sure these recommendations are actually acc=\r\nepted by \nanyone except the people promulgating them, though. In particular=\r\n, what \nI see is a lot of relatively smart people quietly blaming themselve=\r\ns for \nnot understanding the complexity that&#39;s being foisted on them, and \n=\r\nthinking they must be stupid for not understanding it. They may use \ninterf=\r\naces when forced to do so by the frameworks, but they don&#39;t like \nit; and t=\r\nhey certainly don&#39;t make it the first choice in their own code.\n\nInterfaces=\r\n have their place, but that place has been vastly overdrawn in \nthe Java wo=\r\nrld. Most classes simply do not need more than one \nimplementation.\n\n-- \n=\r\n=EF=BB=BFElliotte Rusty Harold elharo@metalab. unc.edu\nJava I/O 2nd Edition=\r\n Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeaula it.org/books/ javaio2/\nhttp://www.amaz=\r\non. com/exec/ obidos/ISBN=3D 0596527500/ ref=3Dnosim/ cafeaulaitA/\n\n \n\n[Non=\r\n-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n\n",
