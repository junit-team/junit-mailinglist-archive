That&#39;s like making your tech support user friendly by outsourcing<br/>\n&gt; it to trained professionasl in India rather than letting your clients<br/>\n&gt; talk directly to the developers. There&#39;s a ton of theory (i.e.<br/>\n&gt; rationalizations) to support doing that, and it&#39;s completely<br/>\n&gt; counterproductive in practice.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Interfaces are very popular among the most theoretical programmers: i.e.<br/>\n&gt; exactly the sort of programmers who are likely to write books, read<br/>\n&gt; books about OO theory, and hang out on lists like this one. However in<br/>\n&gt; my experience concrete classes are much simpler and much preferred by<br/>\n&gt; the vast majority of pragmatic programmers just getting their jobs done.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This goes against my direct experience and against the widely accepted<br/>\nrecommendations that have emerged in the Java world these past years.<br/>\n<br/>\nInterfaces are good. You shouldn&#39;t abuse them, of course, but they<br/>\ncontribute greatly to simplifying the contract between two parties.<br/>\nInterfaces are also the foundation of very successful software platforms,<br/>\nsuch as COM, Eclipse and Spring.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut your reaction proves the point I was making earlier even better than I<br/>\ncould have:  where do you draw the line when you are trying to &quot;do the<br/>\nsimplest thing that could possibly work&quot;?<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my experience, interfaces are very often part of this &quot;simplest thing&quot; as<br/>\nlong as they benefit both your tests and your users.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nCédric<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://testng.org\">http://testng.org</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
