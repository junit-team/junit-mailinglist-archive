Basically, there are two ways to<br/>\naccomplish running anything from tools.<br/>\n<br/>\n1. export .class files out to directory where the default.ini is, have the<br/>\ndefault.ini refer to them as normal<br/>\n2. don&#39;t export .class files out to directory where the default.ini is, have<br/>\nthe default.ini refer to them as normal<br/>\n<br/>\nSimple?  If you do #2, which I recommend, the added step is to put any<br/>\nproject you need in the workspace classpath (by default, we put every<br/>\nproject in there - but that&#39;s overkill).  You also need to make sure that<br/>\nyou have the referenced project that you want to access in your workspace (I<br/>\nknow that sounds obvious, but just in case...).  In addition it is good to<br/>\nhave the VAJ Tools API projects in your workspace (and include them in the<br/>\nworkspace classpath).<br/>\n<br/>\nHow is your default.ini file constructed?<br/>\n<br/>\n-Jason</div>",
