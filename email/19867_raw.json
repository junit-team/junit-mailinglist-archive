Fool me once. :-)\n\nI think your post is a good example of the importance of\npaying attention and asking questions. I certainly failed that\ntest in this case! I remember a test I took in grade school:\n\n1. read all instructions before proceeding\n2. write down the names of the planets\n3. etc.\n...\n25. ignore all preceding steps\n\nI hadn&#39;t even noticed that a number of kids had put their pencil\ndown in the first 20 seconds. Yeah, sure, read instructions.\n\nThe initial solution you provided presents more than a simple\nrefactoring. It&#39;s a generalization, one that your requirement\ndoesn&#39;t demand. I wouldn&#39;t have bothered with the refactoring\nin that case--the unnecessary logic introduces unnecessary risk\n(which is particularly higher given the absence of more\ncomprehensive tests).\n\nBest regards,\nJeff L.\nhttp://langrsoft.com/agileJava\n\n",
