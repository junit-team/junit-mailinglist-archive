B. Rainsberger&quot; &lt;jbrains762@...&gt;\r\n\r\nKent:\n\nYou&#39;ve made this suggestion a few times recently, and I was hoping you would \nelaborate on it. Do you have a specific example in mind of how a TestSetup \nindicated that something was wrong.\n\nI have written an article on how singletons can defeat unit testing. I have \nobserved that if a test relies on the state of a singleton, then there may \nbe a desire to do one-time setup code and *that* is the sign of a code \nsmell. Can you offer a different example? I&#39;d really like the opportunity to \nlearn from it.\n\nThanks,\nJBR.\n\n\n----- Original Message -----\n &gt; Your FAQ suggests that for one-time setup code you need to run\n &gt; it in a TestSuite.\n\nThis is what TestSetup is for. Wrap the suite in a subclass of\nTestSetup, override setUp() (and maybe tearDown()) in your subclass,\nand it only gets run once.\n\nAlternatively, you could consider how to untangle your design so you\ndidn&#39;t need one-time setup.\n\nKent\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp\n\n\n",
