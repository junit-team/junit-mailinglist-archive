I\nwrote a test class. I am using a suite such as\n\n =\r\n   public static junit.framework.Test suite() {\n        return new JUnit4Te=\r\nstAdapter(TestSynonymEngine.class);\n    }\n\nI am running my tests from an An=\r\nt 1.6.2. In my ant script I have a\ntarget with a &lt;junit&gt; task that ultimate=\r\nly uses a &lt;batchtest&gt; to run\nmy tests. The tests run and pass or fail appro=\r\npriately, but, where I\nshould have the name of the tests that were run I in=\r\nstead get\n\n    [junit] Testcase: unknown took 2.109 sec                    =\r\n     \n                                                  \n    [junit] Testca=\r\nse: unknown took 0.156 sec                         \n                       =\r\n                           \n    [junit] Testcase: unknown took 0.11 sec    =\r\n                      \n                                                  \n =\r\n   [junit] Testcase: unknown took 0.204 sec                         \n      =\r\n                                            \n    [junit] Testcase: unknown =\r\ntook 0.093 sec                         \n                                   =\r\n               \n\nand my &lt;junitreport&gt; output similarly shows the names of t=\r\nhe tests as\n&quot;unknown&quot;.\n\nIt was my understanding that the whole purpose of t=\r\nhe\nJUnit4TestAdapter was &quot;so that the new JUnit 4 tests can be run with\nthe=\r\n old runners&quot;. So am I seeing a bug in JUnit4TestAdapter or what?\nDid I mis=\r\ns some configuration option or documentation detail or FAQ?\nIf so, please p=\r\noint me in the right direction.\n\nI would like to move to JUnit4 as I really=\r\n like the enhancements but\nnot knowing the name of the failing test is a de=\r\nal breaker and I don&#39;t\nhave any interest in using alpha-Ant code on my prod=\r\nuction builds. The\noutput of &lt;junitreport&gt; is critical for our build proces=\r\ns, so...\n\nKevin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
