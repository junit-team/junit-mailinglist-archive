Still, David and I\n&gt; would like a less-synchronous-but-still-connected style of development. For\n&gt; that we need good code review tools.

However, before doing so we&#39;d like to know\n&gt; &gt; who else would be affected by such a change. If a project you run would\n&gt; be\n&gt; &gt; affected, please let us know.\n&gt;\n&gt; Google Code denies access from restricted countries. I found that out\n&gt; when I was doing vacation in Cuba and tried to download the current\n&gt; version of GWT.\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards, Lothar\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
