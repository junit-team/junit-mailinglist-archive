You mean, I assume, that when you run C++ the\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;&gt;&gt;Java is too embarassed to run at all?\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;&gt; Huh?\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;&gt; If the C++ program takes 10 seconds, how much is 100% of \nthat? What\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;&gt; would it give you if the Java version where slower by that \namount?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;  &gt; I didn&#39;t expected this to be so strange. If c++ prog takes 100 \nseconds,\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; 10% more is 110, 30% more is 130 and 100% more is simply 200.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yes. I think one might usually say &quot;twice as slow&quot;, or better \nyet, &quot;took\n&gt; &gt; twice as long&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Tonight it is going down to zero. Tomorrow it is going to be \ntwice as cold.\n\nTo be technical here, Temperature is not a ratio variable, it is an \ninterval variable.  There is no &#39;zero&#39; in temperature so it is not \ncorrect to say it is going to be twice as cold tomorrow. And yes, I \nknow there is &#39;absolute&#39; zero but ask any statistician and he will \ntell you that using ratios with our normal temperature scales is \nsimply wrong.  Using ratios with time works if you are using timed \ntests and define &#39;zero&#39; as no time.  Then yes, 5 minutes is twice as \nslow as 10 minutes.  Before benchmarking make sure you have a ratio \nlevel variable if you want to express your results in ratios.  Then \nyou must define the zero point otherwise your ratios are \nmeaningless.  \n\n\nMatt -- \n\n\n\n",
