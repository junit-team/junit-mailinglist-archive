If it ain&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the right exception, then the production code is barfing. Barfing is an<br/>\n&gt; &gt; error -- different from, say, answering 10 instead of 8.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; what about mixed language environment? I mean CORBA / Java or <br/>\n&gt; something like this... CORBA exceptions should be proccessed in Java,<br/>\n&gt;  catched.... so I think checked exceptions are better, they AWARE <br/>\n&gt; programmers of majority of possible exception. They are part of <br/>\n&gt; method contracts. I FLAME :+)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I agree that checked exceptions give the compiler an opportunity to make <br/>\npeople aware of exceptions that code expects to throw. Even so:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. I don&#39;t need the compiler to do all this work for me. Often it gets in my <br/>\nway.<br/>\n2. When I refactor, I have to worry about the ripple effect of all these damn <br/>\ndeclared exceptions. Anything that makes refactoring difficult, tedious or <br/>\nannoying is, in my opinion, a Bad Thing unless it delivers real value in the <br/>\nmeantime.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am not convinced that, overall, the value delivered by checked exceptions <br/>\nis greater than the cost.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn my current project, which of course includes database access, the entry <br/>\npoint into the data access objects throws only unchecked exceptions. If our <br/>\ndata access object encounters an SQLException, it wraps that in an <br/>\nObjectStoreException. These are unexpected problems and catastrophic errors. <br/>\nWhen we throw an exception from within the data access object, we throw a <br/>\nsubclass of ObjectStoreException, such as EntityNotFoundException, <br/>\nEntityInUseException, DuplicateEntityException. None of these exceptions are <br/>\nchecked.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe don&#39;t miss a thing. If we had checked exceptions everywhere, we would run <br/>\nthe risk of coupling our service code with our data access code. Bad Thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes the compiler have as much information to help us uncover unhandled <br/>\nexceptions? No. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s why we have tests. The compiler ain&#39;t so damn smart, anyhow.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJ. B.
