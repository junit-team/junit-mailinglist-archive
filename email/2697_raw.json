Part of my application are\nstraight methods that I can test locally but other\nparts requires the J2EE environment to be active\n(weblogic in this case). \n\nI found a package called junitee at sourgeforge that\ncould test my Java classes or EJB&#39;s nicely. \n\nThen when was looking for more info I found the Cactus\nproject that looks like it could do this sort of\ntesting. \n\nI have (not yet) managed to use Cactus. I will look\nmore into it but would like to ask your opinion!\n\nDo you know the status of junitee ?\nMy email to the author was not delivered ?\n(I made a path to it that I tried to send to him)\n\nWith junitee you cannot test jsp-pages but about all\nthe rest if I am not mistaken.\n\nIs there some other similar interface that would have\na browser interface?\n\nregards\nKaarle Kaila / Finland\n\n__________________________________________________\nTerrorist Attacks on U.S. - How can you help?\nDonate cash, emergency relief information\nhttp://dailynews.yahoo.com/fc/US/Emergency_Information/\n\n",
