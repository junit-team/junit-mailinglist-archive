There were 2-3 messages afew weeks back, &quot;what is junit&quot;,<br/>\n&quot;please tell me how to use junit&quot;, etc and I recall at the time being<br/>\nsurprised at the energy from some of the responders that went into the<br/>\nover the top responses when a single, simple &quot;check the faq&quot; or &quot;go to<br/>\ngoogle&quot; would have been sufficient.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as 2 lists go, a lot of the high level stuff goes over my head<br/>\nright now, but as I&#39;m going thru my steep learning curve I do have<br/>\nmoments where I grasp a new concept and then tie it back in to a post<br/>\nthat I&#39;ve seen here on the list and have a lightbulb moment with<br/>\nmyself - &quot;ahh, that&#39;s what that post was about&quot;.  So if 2 lists do end<br/>\nup splitting out then I&#39;d subscribe to both lists, the newbie to get<br/>\nme up to speed, and the advanced list for an investment in my own<br/>\nfuture learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy .02<br/>\n<br/>\nMike</div>",
