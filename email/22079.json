    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1001735920\">I have a question about the options for gathering and displaying<br/>\nsupplemental information about test failures. Please allow me to<br/>\nillustrate my question with a simple example.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve got a class called Coordinate that represents a point in a 3D<br/>\ncoordinate system. I&#39;ve overloaded the toString method of this class<br/>\nto write out the X, Y, and Z values of the coordinate in a simple<br/>\nString. Now I want to test my toString method using JUnit.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the Coordinate.toString test method fails (because the string was<br/>\nnot constructed in the correct format) I would like to provide the<br/>\nprogrammer running the test with a copy of the incorrect string, since<br/>\nit provides valuable clues about what is broken with the method under<br/>\ntest. I typically do this by placing System.err.println statements in<br/>\nmy test method. However, I realize that using System.err.println isn&#39;t<br/>\nthe most portable or elegant way to provide this information to the<br/>\nprogrammer executing the test.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I really want is a GUI that allows the programmer to select a<br/>\nfailed test from a list of failed tests, and then to view supplemental<br/>\ntest data I provide him/her.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was thinking I could do this by completing the following tasks:<br/>\n<br/>\n- Implementing the RunListener interface in JUnit.<br/>\n- Create an extension of Exception that could contain a HashMap of<br/>\nsimple parameters and that would be passed to the constructor of a<br/>\nFailure object from within a test.<br/>\n- Creating Failure objects in my tests that contain the supplemental<br/>\nfailrure data.<br/>\n- Passing these failure objects to my RunListener implementaiton.<br/>\n- Creating a FailureProcessor class that displays a GUI with the<br/>\ninformation in my RunListener implemenation to show the programmer<br/>\nexecuting my tests the supplemental failure data as described above.<br/>\n(FailureProcessor would be an interface so that you could do different<br/>\nthings with the supplemental failure data, not just show it in a GUI.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBefore I begin this work, I wanted to ask if there was a better way to<br/>\ndo this. I know I could use a logging framework from within my test<br/>\nmethod, but I really want to work within the JUnut framework, not<br/>\noutside of it. I also want a nice little GUI, not a log file.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow are other programmers handling instances when they want to display<br/>\nsupplemental data on failed tests? Does my approach sound reasonable?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Sunburned Surveyor</div>",
