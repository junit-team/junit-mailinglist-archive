I can see why the System.out.println() is<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; redundant here, since the assertEquals will provide the actual<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; length of the vector on failure. But generally, when and where<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; are diagnostic messages in tests appropriate? Do you have a problem<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; with System.out.println() or diagnostic messages in tests in general?<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; They&#39;re like comments. Comments are not executable and cannot fail if<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; they are wrong, so they are waste.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So code should never be commented??  This makes no sense.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Comments that merely describe how the code does things is waste. The <br/>\ncode already says that. These are the comments that a vast majority of <br/>\nprogrammers insist on writing, largely because someone taught them to do <br/>\nso in school.<br/>\n<br/>\nComments of the type &quot;We had to do this silly thing because....&quot; <br/>\nactually communicate something.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  &gt;                                    Diagnostic messages are not<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; assertions and cannot fail if they are wrong, so they are waste.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It is trivially easy to put diagnostic messages inside an if -- you<br/>\n&gt; see them if something of interest occurs.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Waste is waste. Large amounts of waste often build themselves up from a <br/>\nlarge number of small amounts of waste.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  &gt;                                                                 Make an<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; assertion instead.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Usually.  But sometimes what you want is a soft assertion -- if the<br/>\n&gt; condition doesn&#39;t hold, let me know, but keep on going.  And JUnit<br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t support that approach.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No surprise there: JUnit is not a logging tool.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t think of the last time I was interested in finding an unexpected <br/>\nevent that did not cause me to want the application to stop so that I <br/>\ncould fix it. Of course, I am talking about while programming, and not <br/>\nwhile in production.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
