I tried searching the archives, but found nothing applicable. If<br/>\nthis is an old topic, I would appreciate a pointer to the thread...<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nBackground:<br/>\n<br/>\nI have written several derivatives of java.io.InputStream and test cases<br/>\nthat go along with them. However, during a recent peer review of the<br/>\ncode, we discovered an inconsistency between the contract of one of the<br/>\nmethods in java.io.InputStream and my implementation of that same method<br/>\nin the specialized subclass.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nProblem:<br/>\n<br/>\nI would like to have a set of functional tests (black-box style) that<br/>\nenforce the behaviors of the super class, java.io.InputStream. Then use<br/>\nthat same set of tests to ensure that the basic contracts for each of<br/>\nthe classes I write follow that contract (i.e. pass those generic<br/>\ntests). Does anyone have a suggestion for doing this? While this<br/>\nspecific example pertains to java.io.InputStream the same scenario may<br/>\noccur with any class hierarchy.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nEnvironment:<br/>\n<br/>\nI use Ant to compile and run my tests, so ideally any solution will be<br/>\ncompatible with the &lt;batchtest&gt; mechanism or otherwise allow for the<br/>\ndynamic (read, &quot;automatic&quot;) addition of new tests.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nJosh<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
