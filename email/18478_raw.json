But maybe that&#39;s a good tradeoff.=\r\n\n\nFor me, the answer is that my tests don&#39;t fail often enough to warrant  \n=\r\nthat extra expense. Since I&#39;m doing TDD, assertions generally fail  \nonce, =\r\nmaybe a few times, during development. And while I&#39;m developing,  \nI&#39;m pret=\r\nty familiar with what the test failures mean. But after that,  \nfailing tes=\r\nts are pretty rare, and I want them to be. So, I don&#39;t  \nusually bother wit=\r\nh assertion failure messages.\n\nWhen assertion failures do occur, *I have to=\r\n look at the test anyway.*\n\n[ BTW, the assertion failure message shown as a=\r\nn example here (which  \nprobably won&#39;t compile, since the message goes firs=\r\nt in JUnit) doesn&#39;t  \ntell me what &quot;n&quot; is--that&#39;s more useful than a messag=\r\ne that simply  \nrestates the conditional expression. I&#39;d probably code:\n   =\r\n assertTrue(&quot;out of range: &quot; + n, 2 &lt; n && n &lt; 10)\nBut that&#39;s nitpicking on=\r\n email-code. I think I know what you probably meant. ]\n\nYeah, it&#39;d be nice =\r\nto have a prettier failure message. But, that&#39;s OK:  \nif I get a failed tes=\r\nt and can&#39;t decipher the meaning of the failure,  \nI code the nicer failure=\r\n message and rerun the tests. If it&#39;s the kind  \nof failure that keeps recu=\r\nrring, however unfortunately, I&#39;ll keep the  \nmessage in, otherwise I&#39;ll de=\r\nlete it. I might also build a custom  \nassert method:\n    assertInRange(2, =\r\nn, 10);\n... particularly if I have a similar need elsewhere in the code. I =\r\n \nprobably do. And at that point an assertion failure message, created  \nin=\r\n assertInRange, is very prudent.\n\nSometimes, complex assertions hint at a p=\r\nroblem with my system&#39;s  \ndesign--there might be a need for such a construc=\r\nt in the system itself:\n\n    assertTrue(new productionpackage.Interval(2, 1=\r\n0).encloses(n));\n\nGiven all the choices, I think the Java language makes th=\r\ne literate  \nprogramming one the least appealing to me. It is what it is.\n\n=\r\nJeff\n\n",
