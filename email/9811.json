He appeared to be claiming that it came from the JUnit <br/>\n&gt; Web site.  I was investigating the claim.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>AH.  As J.B. already said.. you could have asked for clarification.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; Page 74-78, &quot;Test-Driven Development: A Practical Guide&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hmmmm.  Doesn&#39;t appear to be the JUnit Web site ...<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I may be dating myself but I still put more more faith in<br/>\npeer-reviewed published-by-reputable-publishers books that anything on<br/>\nthe web.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Each new fixture ** is created in an instance of that subclass, used<br/>\n&gt; once, then discarded.&quot; **<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Hoist with your own petard, I would say ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Why?  If we wish to discuss terminology.. then.. exactly what the<br/>\n*&^%#%@% does that mean?  Very rude images come to mind.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; &gt; then recall that an object is an INSTANCE of a class.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Well... not always... in the common-place OO languages, sure.  But<br/>\n&gt; &gt; sometimes it&#39;s a copy of a prototype.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My friend<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There you go making assumptions again :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; this is the JUnit list.  We are talking about Java classes.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Ah.. but you didn&#39;t say &quot;**In Java** an object is an instance of a class&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; You may disparage Java as a commonplace OO language.  That&#39;s your <br/>\n&gt; right.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Actually, it just really sucks as programming languages go... but so<br/>\ndo most of the currently mainstream ones.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; In Java<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Java is not the whole enchilada, my friend.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; a class is a very well-specified thing, and it not the same<br/>\n&gt; thing as a instance.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Unfortunately true.&#92;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; You really ought to know this.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Oh.. I really do.  But I try not to constrain my thinking by the<br/>\nlimitations of a single language.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I think that that we could use our time more productively than this.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Discussion = unproductive?  Not in my world.  Discussion-&gt;learning.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I have been trying to decide whether unit testing is really <br/>\n&gt; applicable in multi-threaded applications, for example, and <br/>\n&gt; wondering how JUnit could be extended to be useful in this area.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You can;t conslusively test for correctness in a concurrent system..<br/>\nat least I ready that somewhere not too long ago.. but it might have<br/>\nbeen online.<br/>\n<br/>\nDave</div>",
