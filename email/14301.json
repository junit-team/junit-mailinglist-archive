I connect to a data provider via an IP address. They have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; provided an API which I implement, and get callbacks from them with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the data. I can create a mock of one of their classes - but since<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it&#39;s not hooked up to their IP, there&#39;s no data in it.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I suppose I could decompile their class and put some data in it - but<br/>\n&gt; &gt; at that point, am I really testing my interaction with their classes -<br/>\n&gt; &gt; or with one of my own munging?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Thanks for any suggestions.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; About a year ago I had to get our application to work with another <br/>\n&gt; application over JNI (they only had a C/C++ interface).   I did the <br/>\n&gt; following:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 1. I wrote an interface that described how I wanted to access the<br/>\nremote <br/>\n&gt; API in terms of my<br/>\n&gt; application (the Facade pattern)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 2. I wrote an implementation of that interface using fake data for <br/>\n&gt; testing the rest of the system.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 3. I wrote tests of the real implementation against the real API (which <br/>\n&gt; accessed a local copy of the remote application). As the real API was <br/>\n&gt; not always going to be available (licensing issues), these were <br/>\n&gt; separated from the rest of the tests.  Some of these tests were also <br/>\n&gt; &quot;Learning tests&quot; to make certain I understood the remote API (and,<br/>\nin my <br/>\n&gt; case, JNI, as this<br/>\n&gt; was my first JNI project).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I thus ended up with three kinds of tests:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 1. Learning tests to make certain I understood the API (and also <br/>\n&gt; protecting me from changes to the API).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 2. Tests of my real implementation of the interface against remote<br/>\nAPI.  <br/>\n&gt; These tests were separated from the standard set of tests.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 3. Tests of my application against a fake implementation.  These were <br/>\n&gt; part of the main set of tests.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I hope this helps,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Kathy Van Stone<br/>\n&gt; kvs@a... </span></blockquote></div>",
