The &quot;rightness&quot; is that it is the Right Thing<br/>\n&gt; To Do(tm) to throw a IAE when receiving junk parameters. [...]<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>*chuckle*  I&#39;ll so stipulate, though I notice that the existing<br/>\nJava API doesn&#39;t do so in all cases.  (I don&#39;t mean to refer only<br/>\nto its throwing NullPtrExc when arguments are unexpectedly null as<br/>\nothers have noted, but also, eg., to its throwing<br/>\nIndexOutOfBoundsExc from String.charAt(), and ArithmeticExc from<br/>\nBigInteger.divide().)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; [...] In your<br/>\n&gt; code fragment, the different things that I might do would be to<br/>\n&gt; issue different errors to the user or log file. An IAE means that<br/>\n&gt; the programmer goofed, while other errors might be for less<br/>\n&gt; negligent reasons.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; For example, if my code is reading a file from a CD and someone<br/>\n&gt; ejects the CD during the process [...]<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, but surely that would look like<br/>\n    try {<br/>\n            // Do something involving that file<br/>\n    } catch (CDNotInDriveException e) {<br/>\n            // (a little-known subclass of IOException)<br/>\n            // ... foo! tell user to put the CD back in<br/>\n    } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {<br/>\n            // ... which still leaves me puzzled about what goes here ...<br/>\n    } catch (RuntimeException e) {<br/>\n            // ... without being equally good here<br/>\n    }<br/>\n<br/>\nTo put it another way:<br/>\n<br/>\nCertainly IllegalArgExc means that the programmer goofed, so there<br/>\nis almost certainly no possibility of fixing the problem at<br/>\nruntime (as by asking the user to do something, or retrying the<br/>\noperation).  The program just has to accept that the operation<br/>\nthat threw the exception cannot proceed (and possibly invoke<br/>\nfallback mechanisms, make entries in a log, apologize abjectly to<br/>\nthe user, etc.).<br/>\n<br/>\nBut this applies equally for *any* unanticipated RuntimeExc, and<br/>\nso can be done generically by catching RuntimeExc...  at which<br/>\npoint it doesn&#39;t matter whether IllegalArgExc or NullPtrExc or<br/>\nIndexOutOfBoundsExc was thrown.<br/>\n<br/>\n(To be clear:  I&#39;m willing to agree that IllegalArgExc is more<br/>\ninformative than NullPtrExc to a human reading it in a stack trace<br/>\nor log, and is on these grounds preferable where appropriate.  I&#39;m<br/>\njust saying that I can&#39;t imagine running code having any use for<br/>\nthe distinction... except, conceivably, the code of a debugger.)</div>",
