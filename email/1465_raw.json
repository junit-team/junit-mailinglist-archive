In an ideal world, test cases might\n    &gt; stay separate, but the first hurdle is often just\n    &gt; getting developers to write them, and that&#39;s a lot\n    &gt; easier to manage when the test case lives in the same\n    &gt; package as their code.\n\nWhy do you say that?  I think this is pure speculation, but if you have some\nactual metrics I would be interested in seeing them.\n\n    &gt; Co-mingling increases the chances that they&#39;ll use the\n    &gt; test case for all of their incremental testing\n    &gt; (instead of writing little mini-clients or main()\n    &gt; methods to test/debug), and helps make unit testing\n    &gt; seem like part of the development process instead of a\n    &gt; post-coding chore.  \n\nAgain, I am baffled at your logic, but if you have actual results please\nshare them.\n \n    &gt; We can always auto-repackage stuff later, \n\nThis is a burden on the process.  If tests are going to be split out anyway,\nand there is no good design reason why they should be with production code,\nthen initially put them where they are intended to be.  Also, depending on\nyour source control system, this could be somewhat detrimental to your\ncompany&#39;s history markers and metrics.  Moving a class out of one package to\nanother (which we must do from time to time) will cause another root to be\nformed in the new package and an orphaned leaf in the old.  You could lose\nvaluable history.  Not to mention that in distributed team environments\nothers may be expecting for your class(es) to be &quot;in the same ol&#39; place&quot; and\nif you move them, you cause some degree of hassle.  Sometimes this is\nunavoidable, but I think it is a bad practice to get into.\n\n    &gt; but in my\n    &gt; experience, it&#39;s not always easy to get people to go\n    &gt; back and write test cases when there&#39;s more\n    &gt; interesting work to be done.\n\nThat is a fault of not doing test-first which you will face no matter where\nthe test cases live.  The thought in my mind is that tests are an integral\npart of the system, they drive the design for us (in XP).  They are not some\nspecial case group of bastardized objects that can be taken or not.  They\nare essential.  Don Wells once said (I believe it was Don, if anyone knows\ndifferently please correct me), &quot;Throw away my code, but never throw away my\ntests.&quot;  Point being that he would be able to rebuild the system again from\nscratch if he had the tests.  If you threw away the tests and gave him the\nproduction code, he would be floundering in agony to reproduce all of those\ntests.\n\nTests are not simply obilgatory objects that satisfy some requirements from\nmanagement... they are the life-sustaining power of the code, in my opinion!\n\n-Jason\n\n\n",
