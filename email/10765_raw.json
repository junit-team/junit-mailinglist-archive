What am I \n&gt; missing?\n&gt;\n&gt;Sounds like you need to read up on references...\n&gt;\n&gt;The simple version is that &quot;ABC&quot; may be living at slot A in memory.  You\n&gt;then set your variable newLoginId to equal that, which is to say that\n&gt;there is some slot in memory (let&#39;s call it B) that now points to A.\n&gt;Then you set your dupLoginId variable that lives at slot C in memory and\n&gt;tell it to point to slot B, which is pointing to slot A which is &quot;ABC&quot;.\n&gt;Yes, strings are immutable, but that means nothing in this case.  You\n&gt;have 2 references to the same object in memory.\n\nYes, but if that object is guaranteed never to change (which is true of \nStrings), what is the harm? This is the type of aliasing that is considered \nbeneficial, as it reduces memory usage.\n\nActually by the above model I believe that the dupLoginId points to A not B \nas &quot;value&quot; of a reference is the memory it points to and = copies \nvalues.  To check, run the following code:\n\nString a = &quot;abc&quot;;\nString b = a;\na = &quot;cde&quot;;\nSystem.out.println(b);\n\nIt will print &quot;abc&quot;.  (At least it did when I tried it out in bsh).\n\n(Also see Item 4 of Effective Java).\n\n-Kathy Van Stone\nkvs@...\n\n\n\n\n",
