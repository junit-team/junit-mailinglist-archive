B. Rainsberger wrote:\n&gt; albsavoia wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Feedback?\n&gt; \n&gt; Here is how I see practice rolling out:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. Practitioners generate a great idea.\n&gt; 2. Practitioners test the idea: some like it, some don&#39;t.\n&gt; 3. If enough like it, some start teaching it.\n&gt; 4. If enough teach it, some /schools/ start teaching it.\n&gt; 5. If enough schools teach it, it becomes part of the standard curriculum.\n&gt; 6. If it becomes part of the standard curriculum, generations of \n&gt; practitioners treat it as &quot;the way we do things&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; I think we&#39;re waiting for step 5. I suspect that by the time we reach \n&gt; step 6, there will be people at step 2 saying that TDD is &quot;so 1999.&quot;\n\nI teach at a small, liberal-arts college (http://cs.calvin.edu), and\nthis is my TDD-in-the-classroom testimony...\n\nI got test-infected back in 2002.  It took me a couple semesters after\nthat, but I finally realized that CS 1 is actually *easier* with JUnit.\n   I started using it in the CS 1 labs and projects, and students seemed\nto respond well.  They actually responded much better to JUnit tests\nthan to command-line drivers.  CL drivers never work the way students\nwould like, mostly because parsing is so tricky.\n\nA colleague started using unit tests in CS 2 as well.  Unfortunately, CS\n2 for us is in C++, and my colleague was more happy with the standard\nC++ &quot;assert&quot; than any C++ unit-testing library.\n\nIn either case, I have to stress that we teach *unit testing* in CS 1\nand CS 2.  There is no way these students would be able to handle\nrefactoring.\n\nI&#39;m currently on sabbatical, and my project is to work on teaching\nmaterials (lab manual and maybe even a textbook) for a Programming\nLanguages course (taken 2nd semester, sophomore year).  My approach to\nthis course is for students to build interpreters using incremental\ndevelopment and *true* TDD.  What&#39;s really cool about this is that most\n(if not all) refactorings are just transformations based on PL theory,\nso I can justify it on PL grounds, not just good-practice grounds.\n\nThe problem now is a missing step in Joe&#39;s &quot;algorithm&quot;.  I&#39;d add a step:\n\n  3.5.  If enough teach it, teaching materials get produced.\n\nWhile this step is implicit in steps 4 and 5, I think *right now* it&#39;s\nthe sticking point in the process, and so I&#39;m going to make the step\nexplicit.\n\nTo my knowledge, no Java or C++ introductory textbooks describe or use\nJUnit.  There are some excellent books on JUnit and TDD, but they&#39;re\nwritten for reasonably experienced programmers.  We need materials for\nthe beginning programmer.  My CS 1 lab manual (which uses JUnit\neverywhere, all the time) is currently just for private use; I am\nplanning to get it published somehow, somewhere.  I hope to do the same\nto my PL materials.\n\njdf\n\n- --\n* Jeremy D.
