I think they are pretty clear. I wil=\r\nl\nre-read your paper later on (it can take some time, though) and I will\npo=\r\nst my comments here.\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;kentb&quot; &lt;kentb@...&gt; wro=\r\nte:\n&gt;\n&gt; Alex,\n&gt;  \n&gt; The payment collection process is a fairly typical busi=\r\nness process:\none a\n&gt; quarter (say), the client owes the insurance company =\r\n$1000. Out goes a\n&gt; request, then if no money comes in out go a series of r=\r\neminders.\nWhen the\n&gt; money comes in it has to be matched to the original re=\r\nquest. If the\namount\n&gt; is wrong, someone needs to figure out how to reconci=\r\nle the\nsituation. The\n&gt; business logic in such situations can be incredibly=\r\n complicated,\nprimarily\n&gt; because of the wide range of scenarios that happe=\r\nn in real life.\nPart of the\n&gt; challenge is automating as much processing as=\r\n possible, but balance\nthis by\n&gt; asking for manual assistance any time the =\r\nbusiness or the\nrelationship with\n&gt; the customer might be put at risk.\n&gt;  \n=\r\n&gt; &quot;Stability&quot; means how stable the API is that is being tested. An\ninterfac=\r\ne\n&gt; that changes daily (not just accretion, but actual changes) probably\n&gt; =\r\nshouldn&#39;t have automated tests--they are just a pain.\n&gt;  \n&gt; &quot;Reliability&quot; m=\r\neans how likely the programmer is to make a mistake while\n&gt; programming. Co=\r\nde that is dead simple doesn&#39;t benefit much from\ntests, while\n&gt; writing cod=\r\ne with lots of logic and interactions can be helped by tests.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Regards=\r\n,\n&gt;  \n&gt; Kent Beck\n&gt; Three Rivers Institute\n&gt; \n&gt;   _____  \n&gt; \n&gt; From: junit@=\r\nyahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of\n&gt; toalexsmail\n&gt;=\r\n Sent: Tuesday, September 23, 2008 12:28 PM\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; S=\r\nubject: [junit] Re: Where to test?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Hi, Kent!\n&gt; Your example with=\r\n Chart API is good. However, your example with\n&gt; payment processing is comp=\r\nletely nightmare for me. I didn&#39;t understand\n&gt; what does the application, w=\r\nhat client thought and what what problem\n&gt; you strike with. I also didn&#39;t u=\r\nnderstand your Stability and\n&gt; Reliability aspect. I guess this is because =\r\nI didn&#39;t understand your\n&gt; payment processing example. \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In junit@y=\r\nahoogroups. &lt;mailto:junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt; com, &quot;kentb&quot;\n&gt; &lt;kentb@&gt; wrote:=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; All,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Last week on succeeding days I encountered two situa=\r\ntions, one where\n&gt; &gt; system-level tests were valuable and unit tests would =\r\nhave been\n&gt; useless and\n&gt; &gt; one where the reverse was true. Since simply th=\r\ne level of the tests\n&gt; is not\n&gt; &gt; sufficient to decide where to test, I tho=\r\nught a bit more about how I\n&gt; should\n&gt; &gt; decide where to test. I came to th=\r\nree criteria:\n&gt; &gt; * The cost of writing and running the test\n&gt; &gt; * The stab=\r\nility of the interface the test is, errr..., testing\n&gt; &gt; * The reliability =\r\nof the code satisfying the test\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I wrote this up in a little paper:=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; www.threeriversinstitute.org/WhereToTest.html.
