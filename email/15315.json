First off I eyeball the code both in<br/>\n&gt; the private method and the public method being tested. Most of the time<br/>\n&gt; the reason for the failure is obvious. If it&#39;s not, I&#39;ll generally set a<br/>\n&gt; breakpoint or two and step through the code in the debugger and watch<br/>\n&gt; what actually happens. This is a lot more productive than guessing at<br/>\n&gt; what the problem might be. If I could guess right, then I wouldn&#39;t need<br/>\n&gt; to step through it.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If you&#39;re going to use the debugger, then you don&#39;t need to write that <br/>\nsmaller test. Agreed. I simply prefer not to use the debugger if I don&#39;t <br/>\nhave to. It&#39;s part of me continuing to practise writing good tests.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;snip /&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If the bug proves to be deep inside another piece of code, then I might<br/>\n&gt; later add a second test that aims more closely at the bug. However,<br/>\n&gt; that&#39;s only done after I&#39;ve identified the bug, and often I don&#39;t even<br/>\n&gt; bother to do that. After all, there&#39;s already at least one test for the<br/>\n&gt; issue.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s fine. I simply aim for smaller tests, and whenever a test fails <br/>\nand I can&#39;t pinpoint the problem, I generally aim to introduce a smaller <br/>\ntest. If not, then I&#39;d tend towards too many big tests, combinatoric <br/>\nexplosion and all that.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven if I do have to step through code with a debugger, I generally want <br/>\nto use that as a way to find out what input combination I didn&#39;t test in <br/>\none of my methods, so I can add that test.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for giving me a look inside your personal process. It helps me <br/>\nunderstand your point of view, even though I still disagree with &quot;it <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t solve the problem,&quot; since I obviously /do/ solve problems that way.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ.
