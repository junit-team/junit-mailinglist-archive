My hierachical requirement is moved out as hierarchical helpers\nthat are creating test objects (similar to ObjectMother pattern\nsuggested by IIja).. how does it sound..?\n\n&gt;&gt;Let us not question the design for testing..\n\nI didn&#39;t mean to be rude here.  But I wanted to imply that the app\ndesign is done this way for various reasons.  But the tests has to be\nwritten around the existing app design.  The issue in question was the\ntest design not the app design.\n\n~JAK\n\nOn Apr 10, 2005 12:01 AM, J. B.

Do not get carried away by\n&gt;  &gt;  &gt;  &gt; this example..I am trying to sample a similar one.. Assume\n&gt;  &gt;  &gt;  &gt; the following heirarchy structure..\n&gt;  &gt;  &gt;  &gt; BizDoc = Performs versions/history relation functions.\n&gt;  &gt;  &gt;  &gt; OrderDoc -&gt; BizDoc = Performs Order related functions.\n&gt;  &gt;  &gt;  &gt; RequestDoc -&gt; BizDoc = Performs Request related functions.\n&gt;  &gt;  &gt;  &gt; PurchaseOrder -&gt;OrderDoc = Performs PO specific functions.\n&gt;  &gt;  &gt;  &gt; Invoice -&gt; OrderDoc = Performs Invoice specific functions.\n&gt;  &gt;  &gt;  &gt; Shipment -&gt; Orderdoc = Performs Shipment specific functions.\n&gt;  &gt;  &gt;  &gt; Auction -&gt; RequestDoc = Performs auctions specific functions.\n&gt;  &gt;  &gt;  &gt; PurchaseRequest -&gt; RequestDoc = Performs PR specific functions.\n&gt;  &gt;  &gt; \n&gt;  &gt;  &gt;  With all due respect, this hierarchy looks a little big to me. I\n&gt; would\n&gt;  &gt;  &gt; think\n&gt;  &gt;  &gt;  about using composition in some of those places. (Or aren&#39;t you\n&gt; actually\n&gt;  &gt;  &gt;  talking about inheritance here?)\n&gt;  &gt; \n&gt;  &gt; JAK: as I have mentioned this heirarchy is just a sample...in reality\n&gt;  &gt; it could be even deeper.  Let us not question the design for testing..\n&gt;  \n&gt;  The design /is/ the point of the discussion. If you&#39;re not interested in \n&gt;  discussing that, then please stop. If the hierarchy were even deeper, \n&gt;  that would only show a worse design problem.\n&gt;  -- \n&gt;  J. B.
