One\n&gt; solution I&#39;ve used when testing with short input files is using code within\n&gt; the JUnit test to write the input file to a temporary location on the file\n&gt; system, then have it automatically deleted when the tests have completed.\n&gt; This way you could easily have your inputstream and would also more\n&gt; accurately represent the way the code will be used in production.\n&gt;\n&gt;         There are plenty of additional sources of info about this out there\n&gt; on the net. Check out the JUnit Best Practices doc over on JavaWorld.\n&gt;\n&gt;         Hope this helps,\n&gt;\n&gt;         -tim\n&gt;\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Paul Michali [mailto:pcm@...]\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, September 18, 2001 11:05 AM\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: [junit] Using strings to test Properties processing?\n&gt;\n&gt; Help! I&#39;m stuck.  My program reads a property file and processes the\n&gt; various properties found. To test this, I have some dummy property\n&gt; files that I use and JUnit tests that read those files and check\n&gt; various things.\n&gt;\n&gt; In an effort to &quot;improve&quot; things, I thought that I could, for testing,\n&gt; use a string as the input stream for the properties and then just\n&gt; use strings in the JUnit tests, insead of having a dozen property files.\n&gt;\n&gt; However, I&#39;m stuck trying to figure out how to do this (warning - Java\n&gt; novice)...\n&gt;\n&gt; The Properties.load() call wants an input stream. For the application,\n&gt; I can create a FileInputStream and pass this to the load() call. For\n&gt; testing, I wanted to use StringBufferInputStream, but that class is\n&gt; deprecated. Instead, they say to use StringReader.\n&gt;\n&gt; How can I convert a StringReader object into a InputStream object so\n&gt; that it can be passed to Properties.load()? Is this possible? If not,\n&gt; are there any other ways to do this, other than using a deprecated\n&gt; class?\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;d really like to simplify the tests, as there are many properties\n&gt; that I want to check to make sure they are processed correctly.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks in advance!\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; PCM (Paul Michali)\n&gt;\n&gt; Carrier Voice Gateway Business Unit (CVGBU)\n&gt; Cisco Systems, Inc.\n&gt; 250 Apollo Drive\n&gt; Chelmsford, MA 01824\n&gt;\n&gt; Phone : (800) 572-6771 x 45817  (978) 244-5817 [direct]\n&gt; Paging: (800) 365-4578 [voice]  pcm@...
