Until you know what you need to open and why <br/>\nyou need to open it, keep it closed. That is humility. Do not assume you <br/>\ncan guess what will and will not be useful without foreknowledge of how <br/>\nthe library will be used.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Assume that people will use it in ways you didn&#39;t think of,<br/>\n&gt; and make it possible for them to do so in ways that you control (always an<br/>\n&gt; interesting exercise, by the way, it forces you to think out of the box and<br/>\n&gt; to break your habits).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Michael showed a pretty compelling case where the vendor forgot to make<br/>\n&gt; their methods virtual, and I&#39;ve seen this mistake and more general ones so<br/>\n&gt; many times in dozens of API&#39;s and libraries I wish people locked down their<br/>\n&gt; code a lot less.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You seem to be assuming that a library is a fixed piece of code that can <br/>\nnever change. That isn&#39;t the case. When a new need arises, new features <br/>\ncan be added to the library to support it. However, some changes are <br/>\neasier than others. I don&#39;t know C++ well enough to know if it&#39;s easy or <br/>\nhard to change a function from non-virtual to virtual. However the <br/>\nequivalent in Java (final to non-final) is straightforward. The reverse <br/>\noperation is not. Be very cautious before committing to an irreversible <br/>\noperation.<br/>\n<br/>\nClosed doors can be opened, but open doors cannot be closed. If you <br/>\nlater discover that you didn&#39;t design the API quite right, take the <br/>\nright arguments, set the proper preconditions, or generally do the right <br/>\nthing, it&#39;s really hard to fix it. Too much code already depends on the <br/>\nold, buggy, poorly designed behavior.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause I am humble and know that I do not know how people will use my <br/>\ncode, I restrict myself to what I do know. I limit myself to the <br/>\nsimplest thing that could possibly work until it&#39;s obvious that my <br/>\nsolution no longer can work, and a more complex solution is necessary.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n﻿Elliotte Rusty Harold  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:elharo@...\">elharo@...</a><br/>\nJava I/O 2nd Edition Just Published!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafeaulait.org/books/javaio2/\">http://www.cafeaulait.org/books/javaio2/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596527500/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/\">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596527500/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/</a></div>",
