The schools that many look to for definition of\nthe standard curriculum have classes taught by academics.  Many\nsoftware academics are crack developers with excellent ideas about\nproducing quality code quickly.  Some have spent more of their life\ngetting paid to think about software than produce it.  Most have a\ncertain blindspot when it comes to TDD and unit testing in general,\nthough, I believe:\n\nIn research, it can be hard to say in advance what your code is\nsupposed to be doing.\n\nThere are ways to incrementally well-tested units that contribute to\nan overall whole that is still somewhat amorphous, but it does\nrequire, to a certain extent, changing both how you think about\nresearch and software, and it&#39;s taken me a while to figure out even as\nmuch as I have.  For example, it&#39;s often worth keeping a well-tested,\nbut low-performing algorithm around at least until you can build a\nsecond algorithm that can do as well.  All that said, the number of\nlong-standing research projects with even slightly comprehensive unit\ntests is much less than a T1 person would hope.\n\n   David Saff\n\n",
