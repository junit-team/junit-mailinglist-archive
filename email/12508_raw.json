Some people recommended to \nhave a new vm for each test so that a tested class does not depends \non the ant environment, what does that actually mean? Can someone \npleas explain? I recently changed the forkmode=&quot;once&quot; in my ant and \nhope that it would speed up the build, but somehow a few UTs got \nNullPointerExceptions on certain objects when they are not supposed \nto. And it seems like it has something to do with delegation. Can \nsomeone help me clarify this?\n\nThanks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
