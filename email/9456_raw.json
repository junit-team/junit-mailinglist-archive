And in my \n&gt; experience you *can* learn to write code in a way that you \n&gt; very seldom need to fall back on this crutch.\n&gt; \n&gt; Just my two cents, Ilja\n\nI agree that you should strive to write code that does not need\ncomments, however some times it is unavoidable. One prime example is\nwhere you are driven to make a design decision that runs counter to\n&#39;common sense&#39; and must indicate why in order to keep people from\nwrongly rewriting the code in the future. This often happens when trying\nto accommodate a framework or hardware that doesn&#39;t quite work as\nadvertised.\n\n---\nOutgoing mail is certified Virus Free.\nChecked by AVG anti-virus system (http://www.grisoft.com).\nVersion: 6.0.518 / Virus Database: 316 - Release Date: 9/11/2003\n \n\n\n",
