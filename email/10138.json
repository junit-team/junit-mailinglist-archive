Discovered <br/>\nDBUnit, but I&#39;m not sure how I should approach my problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe migrate a database from one data schema to another, completely<br/>\ndifferent. I want to be sure data is migrated correctly (so that for<br/>\nexample a customer keeps its orders).<br/>\n<br/>\nMy first idea was to iterate on customers in the source database, and<br/>\ncheck its data against the new database.<br/>\nFor example, for a customer, I would have tests on, amongst others:<br/>\n-contacts<br/>\n-orders<br/>\n-address<br/>\nand each test would be run for each row coming from the source database.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs that the correct approach? <br/>\nFrom what I discovered of JUnit, I&#39;m not sure how to integrate the<br/>\niteration in the test suite ( The same test would be run against all rows<br/>\nfrom the database).<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance for your help. I hope I didn&#39;t miss any obvious thing<br/>\nbefore posting this....<br/>\n<br/>\nRaph</div>",
