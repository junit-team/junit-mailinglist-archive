And, sometimes, readability trumps duplication.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;I would be *very* reluctant to accept that. I can&#39;t remember an instance\n&gt;  &gt;where, when at first sight it seemed like accepting duplication improved\n&gt;  &gt;readability, I couldn&#39;t come up with a more appropriate design that was\n&gt;  &gt;both readable and duplication-free. Most often, I just missed an\n&gt;  &gt;important insight.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  It happens to me sometimes, but I&#39;m reluctant to say that readability\n&gt;  trumps duplication sometimes because it is far to likely to be used as\n&gt;  an excuse.\n\nI fully agree with the notion that we shouldn&#39;t accept duplication for\nthe very same reason as Michael pointed out. Yet, I sometimes do so.\nWhy?\n\nMost of my work these days is spent coaching and working with teams\nand individuals who are just adopting these techniques, sometimes\nwriting their very first unit tests. In doing this work I&#39;ve more than\nonce found myself in a situation where the code base I&#39;m looking at\ndoesn&#39;t reveal me a better design.\n\nIn other words, I&#39;m not yet intimate enough to envision the\nrefactoring so I decide to leave it there for now--knowing that I&#39;m\ntreading a dangerous path--and being on the lookout for a design that\ndoesn&#39;t exhibit that defect.\n\n\nLasse\n\n-- \nLasse Koskela\n* Author of &quot;Test Driven&quot; (Manning Publications, 2007) *\n* Reaktor Innovations * http://www.ri.fi/en *\n\n",
