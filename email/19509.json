In 4.3, we introduced some run-time math magic to make up for<br/>\nthe lack of type-expansion once we had removed most of the primitive<br/>\ntype assertEquals methods.  Thus, it became the case, somewhat<br/>\naccidentally, that this would pass:<br/>\n<br/>\nassertEquals(new Integer(1), new Long(1));  // A<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, it simultaneously became the case that this would also pass:<br/>\n<br/>\nassertEquals(new BigDecimal(&quot;1.0&quot;), new BigDecimal(&quot;1.1&quot;));  // B<br/>\n<br/>\nLine B should certainly fail.  The simplest thing to do is to remove<br/>\nour math magic, introduce assertEquals(long, long), etc, and let<br/>\nnumerical classes define their own equality.  This means that line A<br/>\nwill now fail, since that&#39;s how Integer.equals() is defined.  This is<br/>\na small behavior change, but a &quot;regression&quot; of sorts.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf anyone believes this is a damaging decision, please let me know.<br/>\n<br/>\n   David Saff</div>",
