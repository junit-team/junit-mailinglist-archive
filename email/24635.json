few months (by April) of <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tests4j.adligo.org\">tests4j.adligo.org</a>.  </div><div>It is a concurrent api to run tests with pluggable code coverage.  It also has the ability to assert dependencies (which class called which),</div><div>code coverage (source file A has 78% coverage) and a pluggable assertion api;</div><div> assertUniform(Object expected, Object actual);</div><div> assertNotUniform(String message, Object expected, Object actual);</div><div>  Anyone can add Uniform implementations to do anything and inject them to tests4j, the uniform implementation is chosen by the expected class name.</div><div>It is roughly based on JUnit 3, TestCases are called Trials and are run concurrently. <br></div><div>There are currently three types of trials;</div><div>    SourceFileTrails (allows coverage assertion at the source file level)</div><div>    ApiTrials (allows coverage assertion anywhere under the package level)</div><div>    UseCaseTrials</div><div>It is using jaxb to write out results to files or streams  (storing jacoco probes as base64).</div><div>It has a way to pass parameters to Trials;</div><div>   @BeforeTrial</div><div>   public static void beforeTrial(Map&lt;String,Object&gt; map);</div><div>   I will probably write a xml input file schema for easy use of the parameter api as well. </div><div>There has been some work to include a way to write/include use cases with out having running tests for them using xml files included in the jar files (requirements.xml, use_case_A.xml, use_case_B.xml etc).  </div><div>   This use case idea would allow non developers to simply write/modify xml files in English or any other language stating what the system or project should do so that developers could map the English to a @Test method later on using something like;</div><div>   @Test</div><div>   @UseCase (&quot;Parallel park car.&quot;)</div><div>   public void testParallelPark() {</div><div>   ....</div><div>   }</div><div>   This would also allow tests4j to state at the end of a trial run, what percentage of use cases;</div><div>A) have corresponding tests</div><div>B) have passed</div><div><br></div><div>In addition I have spent some time dreaming up a new development process that would involve a new system called Intelligence4j.</div><div>Intelligence4j would initially be a decoupling of the test chart from CI server (I.E. junit chart in Hudson), and would eventually become a hub for all information about development (what built where, who wrote it, which tests passed).  This would allow CI server builds to push to a common location (from multiple operating systems), which could also capture developer builds.</div><div><br></div><div>You may want to take a look at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tests4j.adligo.org\">tests4j.adligo.org</a> (after it is on GitHub) before dumping a lot of time into development, since this has been the focus of most of my effort for the entire year of 2014.  Also I thought I should just throw out all of these ideas, as it may provide some food for thought if the junit community is anxious to dive in to a new round of junit.</div><div><br></div><div>Cheers,</div><div>Scott</div><div><br></div><div>PS here a sneak peak of how it looks when testing itself :)_</div><div>Note coverage units are jacoco probe hits.</div><div>Also it will probably NOT have a eclipse plugin to run it this year, perhaps 2016,</div><div>however it can be run from eclipse using main methods.</div><div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"ygrps-yiv-822162378\">------------------------Test Results-------------------------</p>\n<p class=\"ygrps-yiv-822162378\">
