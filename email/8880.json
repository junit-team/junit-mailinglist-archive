And if <br/>\n&gt; you have, how<br/>\n&gt; big was the effort to sort out the real problem? My guess is <br/>\n&gt; that going all<br/>\n&gt; the way to define dependencies for every subclass relation is <br/>\n&gt; not worthwhile;<br/>\n&gt; at least not for me.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Johannes<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Me personally? Not that regularly; however, I can see where some people might like to set that condition. But, my Java work so far has always been in the sub-75k-line range so I am not working on the large programs. In my C++ experience, I have had is-a relationships at 10+ depth with these conditions sitting throughout. So, I can imagine that people working on very large Java programs might run into the same thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nActually, I am thinking that the unit test only needs to identify those relationships that are linked. Thus the vast majority of tests would run regardless, but when they saw a relationship is linked it knows not to run the test when the first test failed. If the programmer begins to link too much then they are using a unit tool to test integration - something that it is not meant to do.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nChip<br/>\n-----<br/>\nProgramming: Its not just a job - its an indenture</div>",
