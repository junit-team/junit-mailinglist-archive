This could be noise, or really good  \nfeedback depending on your circumstance. Most would say it is noisy.\n\nIf you make methods more visible, you can test them more easily, but  \nothers can now use them more easily. You are potentially confusing  \napi users.\n\nIf you just exercise the public methods, then you have less brittle  \ntests, but you probably want to combine your testing efforts with  \ncoverage to make sure that if you change a method to not go through a  \nroute any more, that there is still some route with tests that cover  \nthat behavior. Also, it could be argued that since the private is  \nessentially inside the public method, that you may have to do more  \nindirect work to get the public method to go down all the branches of  \nthe private method. Indirection can give more flexibility, and it can  \ngive more confusion.\n\nGood luck,\n\nBob Evans\nhttp://www.junitfactory.com/\nSend Java, Get Tests\n\n\nOn Feb 7, 2007, at 11:26 AM, Gabriel Nascimento wrote:\n\n&gt; What is the best approach for testing private methods?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Gabriel\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n\n\nBob Evans\n\nhttp://www.junitfactory.com/\nSend Java code, get tests.
