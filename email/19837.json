I believe that mixing languages<br/>\n&gt; rather than switching completely from one language to another is going<br/>\n&gt; to be more and more important. As I explored the subject i found<br/>\n&gt; myself lacking some tools. I was frustrated by the fact that I had to<br/>\n&gt; maintain two sets of tests and look for feedback in two different<br/>\n&gt; locations while developing.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I created a custom runner for JUnit to address the subject and I think<br/>\n&gt; it looks promising. I created a blog entry with some more details in<br/>\n&gt; case anyone is interested:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://johlrogge.wordpress.com/2007/09/08/hybrid-theory/\">http://johlrogge.wordpress.com/2007/09/08/hybrid-theory/</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have some loose plans on open-sourcing this but I would like to see<br/>\n&gt; if there are others than me that find this interesting enough to be<br/>\n&gt; worth the effort before I do.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; /Joakim Ohlrogge<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
