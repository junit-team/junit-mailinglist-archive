Feel free to skip it.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If, however, you find yourself a little mystified about your\n&gt; &gt; test case&#39;s behaviour, you have the option of turning on\n&gt; &gt; the log to get another view on what the test case is doing.\n&gt; &gt; Alternately you could run the test in a debugger. Or you could\n&gt; &gt; start writing a bunch of hand-crafted logging statements since\n&gt; &gt; logging is sometimes more effective than debugging.\n&gt; &gt; But in some cases the assertion log would already be logging what\n&gt; &gt; you need to know without your having to write those statements.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; It&#39;s just another tool that is sometimes useful. Debuggers\n&gt; &gt; are important, but you don&#39;t have to use them.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; ...or you could write smaller, more focused tests and learn something\n&gt; about design.\n\nIs this a fair statement to make? You&#39;ve never met Phil nor have you\nseen any of his test cases. You&#39;ve no idea if he writes small focused\ntests or not.\n\nI think we can all learn to do a better job but I don&#39;t think this\nsort of reply serves either Phil or you well. Perhaps if this\ndiscussion were face to face that would have helped us all.\n\nCheers\nMark\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nBlog: http://www.notesfromatooluser.com/\nOne Year of Scrum: Lessons Learned\nhttp://www.notesfromatooluser.com/2007/10/one-year-of-scr.html\nAperture vs. Lightroom - best comparisons\nhttp://www.notesfromatooluser.com/2007/02/aperture_vs_lig.html\nCustomer Retention Department - Vonage Customer Service Sucks\nhttp://www.notesfromatooluser.com/2007/06/customer_retent.html\n\n",
