Rainsberger&quot; wrote:\n\n&gt;  Try one of the various Test-First challenges out there. That might\n&gt; help\n&gt; drive the idea home.\n&gt;\n&gt; At a macro level, here is how I test-drive a task:\n&gt;\n&gt; 1. Consider the key classes needed to make the CTs pass for the story\n&gt; this task belongs to.\n&gt; 2. Do a little CRC work to ensure that the key classes make sense.\n&gt; 3. Pick a key class.\n&gt; 4. Test drive it. Refactor new classes into existence, if necessary.\n&gt; 5. Repeat from 3 until all key classes are built.\n&gt;\n&gt; Along the way, I ensure that the key classes behave in a manner\n&gt; consistent with the CTs for the story.\n&gt;\n&gt; A CT essentially describes a use-case scenario. A CT describes, at a\n&gt; broad stroke, the required behavior of the system. You have to do some\n&gt;\n&gt; LDUF (&quot;little design up front&quot;) to figure out the two or three key\n&gt; objects that&#39;ll make that test pass. Test-drive those classes. Rinse\n&gt; and repeat.\n&gt;\n&gt; Any clearer?\n&gt;\n&gt; If you don&#39;t already hang out at the TDD Yahoo! group, then go there\n&gt; now. :)\n&gt;\n&gt; So said  Eric Armstrong  on  2003-01-28 --------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&quot;J. B. Rainsberger&quot; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;  So said  Curt Sampson  on  2003-01-24 --------------------\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;...I find my test cases often don&#39;t parallel the particular\n&gt; &gt;methods\n&gt; &gt;&gt; of a class. They test the typical usage patterns of a class,\n&gt; instead.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Hmm. That strikes me as a key point. In essence, test construction\n&gt; &gt;should\n&gt; &gt;follow definition of use cases? Or words to that effect?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;I confess that although I&#39;m &quot;infected&quot;, I&#39;m having a hard time\n&gt; actually\n&gt; &gt;generating\n&gt; &gt;tests for anything other than individual functions. That has been\n&gt; &gt;helpful all by\n&gt; &gt;itself, but I&#39;ve got to get better at imagining fixtures and hanging\n&gt; &gt;tests off of them.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;I read TDD by Example, and enjoyed, but somehow I&#39;m still missing\n&gt; that\n&gt; &gt;flash\n&gt; &gt;of insight that tells how to write the test first. (Too many years\n&gt; &gt;sitting in the\n&gt; &gt;saddle backwards, I suspect.)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Is thinking about &quot;use cases&quot; a profitable approach?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; &gt;junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Your use of Yahoo!
