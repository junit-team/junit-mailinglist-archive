There&#39;s newer versions of Weblogic (the old ones had the \n&gt; kitchen-sink JAR from hell). The xml-apis.jar and xercesImpl.jar from \n&gt; the Xerces project. The way Ant 1.6 has the optional jars split up. \n&gt; Jaxen. Every JDBC driver I&#39;ve ever used. Hibernate.\n\nOK. Two of those I know intimately (Xerces and Jaxen) and one partially \n(Ant). The two I know intimately don&#39;t behave as you claim. The \ndistinction between xercesImpl.jar and xml-apis.jar is not between \npublic and published. It is between standard, cross-parser APIs and \nXerces specific APIs. xercesImpl.jar contains both external code with \nstable APIs and internal code whose API may change.\n\nJaxen is not divided at all. I&#39;ve actually been meaning to divide the \nJaxen single JAR archive for awhile now, but along very different lines. \nPerhaps an older version of Jaxen split off Saxpath and Jaxen itself \ninto two JARs, (both of which were public and published) but they are \nnow distributed as a single JAR containing all the Jaxen classes. There \nare definitely too many public classes in Jaxen , and I&#39;d like to make \nmany of them non-public. However, legacy issues keep me from pulling the \ntrigger.\n\nAnt I&#39;m not as familiar with at the code level, but my impression is \nthat the distribution in many jar files has everything to do with the \nplugin architecture and little-to-nothing to do with distinguishing \nbetween public and published.\n\nThe others you mention, I&#39;ll just have to take your word on. However, \njust because a project distributes multiple jar archives, even ones as \nsuggestively named as foo-apis.jar and fooImpl.jar, does not prove that \none contains published APIs and the other does not. Xerces is a clear \ncounterexample to this assumption.\n\n&gt; I don&#39;t see it as the duty of an API designer to protect people who \n&gt; deliberately go out of their way to inflict pain and suffering on \n&gt; themselves. Making a clear distinction to the client programmer is all \n&gt; that&#39;s called for.\n\nI do, however, see it as the duty of the API designer to not design an \nAPI in such a way that people using it are likely to choose the most \npain-free, correct mode of operation. In a good API the right thing \nshould be obvious and easy. The wrong thing should be difficult to \nimpossible. The API should be designed in such a way that people have to \ngo out of their way to inflict pain and suffering on themselves. It \nshould be designed such that they don&#39;t inflict pain and suffering by \naccident. Too many APIs make inflicting pain and suffering just as easy \nor easier as a painfree experience. That&#39;s just wrong.\n\nThe argument here reminds me of the old saw that it&#39;s the user&#39;s \nresponsibility to read the manual, and that any poorly designed \ninterface that&#39;s virtually certain to confuse and be misused is OK, as \nlong as it&#39;s documented in 10-point type on p. 345 of a telephone book \nsized manual.  It wasn&#39;t true for user interfaces 20 years ago, and it \nisn&#39;t true for programming interfaces today. Good interfaces, be they \nGUIs or APIs, follow the fundamental principles of human computer \ninteraction. Good interfaces are natural, intuitive, and easy to use. \nBad ones aren&#39;t, documentation or no.\n\n-- \n﻿Elliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nXML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim\n\n",
