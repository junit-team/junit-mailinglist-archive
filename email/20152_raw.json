Though we feel there is scope to \nbroaden its u=\r\nse and we aim to develop &quot;interfaces&quot; to control \nsoftware test tools (such=\r\n as JUnit).\n\nSince the application itself is developed in Java and we alrea=\r\ndy \nhave a suite of JUnit tests; we thought writing a JUnit interface \nwoul=\r\nd be a good first step. Though before we get too far in to it, \nit would be=\r\n good to get other peoples views / thoughts on such a \ntool for JUnit?\n\nWit=\r\nhout going into too much detail, the application would \neffectively provide=\r\n a web based test management front-end for JUnit \n(i.e. high level test cas=\r\ne creation, execution and results). There \nwould be some initial setup, as =\r\nusers would need to mirror (either \nmanually or by using helper scripts) th=\r\neir JUnit test / class names \nin our application (so the application knows =\r\nwhich method / class to \nexecute for each test / suite of tests and what to=\r\n store the result \nagainst), but once that&#39;s done it would just be a case o=\r\nf executing \nall your JUnit tests through our GUI.\n\nIf anyone gets a spare =\r\nfew minutes, it would be good to get some \nthoughts on what people think ab=\r\nout the general concept? i.e. \nproviding a graphical, simple to use test ex=\r\necutor / results store \n(including metrics and chart generation) tool for J=\r\nUnit. Do people \nthink it will be beneficial?\n\nI&#39;ll be more than happy to p=\r\nrovide more information on the \napplication etc and we will be looking for =\r\npeople to try the system \n(with JUnit) in the New Year.\n\nCheers,\nLes.\n\n\n\n",
