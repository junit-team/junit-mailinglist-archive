If the log is important, I have =\r\nto go through it, or I miss\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; something important. If it is not import=\r\nant (and I don&#39;t have to go\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; through it) I can skip it altogether. So=\r\n what do you mean when you\n&gt;&gt; &gt; say I\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; don&#39;t have to go through it?\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; I have read carefully all the posts so far and I tend to ag=\r\nree with\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Robert. I am wonder whether I miss something important too.\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; I want to be clear, so I will take one step backward. What is the MAIN\n=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; purpose of JUnit? The answer is to be able to write AUTOMATIC unit\n&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; test. Unit test should be written is the correct way, that is\n&gt;&gt; &gt; correc=\r\ntly design. This has nothing to do with logging. Making unit\n&gt;&gt; &gt; test AUTO=\r\nMATIC contradict using logging.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;you can skip the this paragraph&gt;=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; &gt; I want to step aside for a while. Let assume that you&#39;re not using\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; JUnit at all and write small main function to test. I don&#39;t want to\n&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n counter why you shouldn&#39;t do this, let focus on what tools you do use\n&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n in this approach. In the most cases you will add System.out both to\n&gt;&gt; &gt; t=\r\nhe code and to the main. If you&#39;re using C++, for instance, you will\n&gt;&gt; &gt; u=\r\nse preprocessor to switch on or off these output to the console. More\n&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\nadvance option will be to use logging mechanism and to change it\n&gt;&gt; &gt; confi=\r\nguration depends on the environment your program run (that is to\n&gt;&gt; &gt; turn =\r\non many of your log statement only in development). Everything is\n&gt;&gt; &gt; grea=\r\nt until your program is actually fails. Again, from the experience\n&gt;&gt; &gt; it =\r\nis almost always the case that existing System.outs are not enough,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; th=\r\nat you need more information or you should add some more output\n&gt;&gt; &gt; early =\r\nin the code. So, in this point you have to option to run your\n&gt;&gt; &gt; program =\r\nAGAIN with debugger or to add more System.outs and to run it\n&gt;&gt; &gt; as is. In=\r\n both cases it can be the case that you should rerun your\n&gt;&gt; &gt; program agai=\r\nn (if you use debugger you could simply not pointed out\n&gt;&gt; &gt; when some data=\r\n changed and in the System.out case you can figure out\n&gt;&gt; &gt; that you need m=\r\nore System.outs).\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; From the paragraph above one should conclude th=\r\nat when one write unit\n&gt;&gt; &gt; test there is 2 different phases. First is to w=\r\nrite them down in the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; hope that everything will be ok (it doesn&#39;t mean=\r\n, that you design\n&gt;&gt; &gt; should be poor or you shouldn&#39;t supply appropriate m=\r\nessages to assert\n&gt;&gt; &gt; statements etc) and the second phase is to rerun you=\r\nr test if your\n&gt;&gt; &gt; test fails. Lets see how logging will help you.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; In the first phase I see the only purpose using logs is for &#39;sanity\n&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n check&#39; that is to ensure that you actually test what your think is you\n&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; test. If you want to make something more than just &#39;sanity check&#39; you\n&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; should write unit test to your unit test, that is pretty silly.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; More=\r\nover, you need to make such &#39;sanity check&#39; only when you actually\n&gt;&gt; &gt; writ=\r\ne this test. For this purpose logging is appropriate approach, IMHO.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; In the second phase, when you rerun your unit test when it fails, you\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; should consider to add more assert statement and more clearly\n&gt;&gt; &gt; diag=\r\nnostic messages first. When you done and you don&#39;t see how to\n&gt;&gt; &gt; improve =\r\nthe design (recall I consider that design is correct) you can\n&gt;&gt; &gt; add log =\r\nstatement manually. But in this case they will not be part of\n&gt;&gt; &gt; new mech=\r\nanism, because no more asserts will be added. So this new\n&gt;&gt; &gt; feature will=\r\n not be in use!\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Using logging in the assert statement ONLY for &#39;s=\r\nanity check&#39; is\n&gt;&gt; &gt; overkill, I think. As for me I make such &#39;sanity check=\r\n&#39; in the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; following way. First of all, I use log4j MANUALLY that is as =\r\naddition\n&gt;&gt; &gt; to JUnit asserts. They don&#39;t duplicate what asserts does they=\r\n supply\n&gt;&gt; &gt; additional information, such as what assertion was already don=\r\ne. In\n&gt;&gt; &gt; this case when assertion will fail afterwards I can look on the =\r\nlog to\n&gt;&gt; &gt; see in what part of unit test it happened and what tests passed=\r\n. I go\n&gt;&gt; &gt; even further and use JDK 1.4 assert statement to document\n&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\nprecondition, postcondition and invariants both in the code and in the\n&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n unit test.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; The bottom line is that I see the sense using logs as=\r\n a COMPLETION to\n&gt;&gt; &gt; the JUnit and only for &#39;sanity check&#39;. This use is no=\r\nt duplicates\n&gt;&gt; &gt; JUnit assert statements and could be written manually.\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
