And not completely pragmatic.  Should you<br/>\ntest drive toSting() methods that you want for nice test failure<br/>\nreports?  There are bits & piecs that very likely will slip through<br/>\nuntested.  Some aren&#39;t a problem.  You need a new exception... do you<br/>\ntest drive it or ask your IDE to make you a new exception with the<br/>\nrequired constructors?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; To me, the bottom line with Test Coverage is that it is a &quot;negative<br/>\n&gt; metric&quot;. Low test coverage is an indicator of failure; but high test<br/>\n&gt; coverage is not an indicator of success. Your code could be<br/>\n&gt; highly-covered by failing tests, after all. ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If this were the TDD list, I&#39;d chastise you by saying that none of<br/>\nthem should fail once the code is written. :-)  I would say &quot;highly<br/>\ncovered by ineffective tests&quot;.<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; That&#39;s why we need skilled testers: to fill in the gaps between<br/>\n&gt; Customer Tests (too high-level, often miss boundary conditions) and<br/>\n&gt; Programmer Tests (very low-level, often miss integration problems).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Agreed.  There are methods and tools that can help programmers<br/>\nmaximize (or at least improve) the effectiveness of their tests. <br/>\nAnalyzing code coverage during the run of the highest level AllTests<br/>\nsuite is a first step.  Running Jester regularly also helps find holes<br/>\nin the test logic (note: that&#39;s very different than coverage).<br/>\n<br/>\nDave</div>",
