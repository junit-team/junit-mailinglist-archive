I ended <br/>\nup looking at how RepeatedTest and TestSetup were implemented.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I ended up doing was extending TestSetup and overriding run().  <br/>\nrun() called setUp() once to handle the database connection. Then <br/>\na &quot;big ugly&quot; loop get each object and uses the ResourceManager object <br/>\nfrom the jUnit Extensions package to wrap up the record.  Then called <br/>\nbasicRun().  Each pass through the loop calls basicRun(), so that the <br/>\nTestSuite passed into this object would be run on each record.  <br/>\nCalled it RecordIteratorTestSetup.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen, I just created a TestCase where I used the <br/>\nRecordIteratorTestSetup, passed in the value of the batch, and ran a <br/>\nstandard test.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe standard test (one that I want to repeat for many customers), <br/>\nsimply is smart enough that on setUp() it grabs the Record from the <br/>\nResourceManager.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd it worked...and there was much rejoicing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure if this implementation is ideal, but it seems to work so <br/>\nfar.  I really appreciate the help, because it got me thinking about <br/>\nthis a bit differently and pushed me down the right track.</div>",
