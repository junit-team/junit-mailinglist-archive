But the TestSuite holds initialization\n&gt;stuff so it must run.  Is there a way I can start the TestSuite, run\n&gt;the intialization then get to choose which test from a class I want to\n&gt;run?\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\nCould you give us an example of how the TestSuite holds initialization \nstuff?  Could that initialization stuff live within the test case&#39;s \nlocal fixture rather than a global fixture?  \n\nI&#39;ve seen this occur when using TestSetup to define global fixtures. \n The symptom is that tests must be run within the context of TestSetup \nto pass.  That&#39;s an unfortunate situation borne out of undesirable \ncoupling between multiple test cases and a common test fixture.  My \nexperience has been that breaking these dependencies can do wonders for \nthe design.\n\nPlease post a concrete example so we can help.  \n\nMike\n\n\n",
