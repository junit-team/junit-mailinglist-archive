    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1765167481\">+1 for both<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, David Saff &lt;david@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; All,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; To date, we&#39;ve kept two pieces of documentary metadata along with<br/>\n&gt; JUnit: acknowledgements.txt and ReleaseNotes files.  In order:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 1) acknowledgements.txt is an attempt at a log of everyone outside of<br/>\n&gt; the primary maintainers who has contributed in some way to JUnit.  It<br/>\n&gt; was, I believe, originally intended to serve two purposes: (a) for<br/>\n&gt; traceability, should any legal questions arise about the provenance of<br/>\n&gt; a piece of code, (b) before github, we often ended up massaging (or<br/>\n&gt; replacing) patches ourselves before committing them to CVS, and we<br/>\n&gt; wanted a way to genuinely thank and remember the original authors.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; GitHub now helps with both of these issues: since we can discuss pull<br/>\n&gt; requests before they&#39;re accepted, we can ask contributors to fix minor<br/>\n&gt; issues, and github keeps excellent track of what came from where.  In<br/>\n&gt; addition, distributed maintenance of the acknowledgements.txt file has<br/>\n&gt; become a pain, since as a linear document, there is often a race<br/>\n&gt; condition between appended items.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 2) I&#39;ve been asking committers to include updates to ReleaseNotes<br/>\n&gt; files as part of check-ins.  This has some of the same issues as<br/>\n&gt; above: it&#39;s no longer strictly necessary given GitHub support, and<br/>\n&gt; also leads to race conditions.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So, my proposal is:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 1) Drop further appends to acknowedgements.txt<br/>\n&gt; 2) Adopt a more formal approach to git commit messages, following<br/>\n&gt; along <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html,\">http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html,</a><br/>\n&gt; along release notes to be largely auto-generated at release time.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thoughts?<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
