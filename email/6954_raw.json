The test \ncode looks like this:\n\n   public void testUnmarshelledMessage()  {\n\n        try {\n            File path = new File(&quot;/home/mark/testmessages&quot;);\n            File[] files = path.listFiles();\n\n            for (int i = 0; i &lt; files.length; i++) {\n                File file = files[i];\n                if ( file.getName().startsWith(&quot;test&quot;) && \nfile.getName().endsWith(&quot;xml&quot;)) {\n                    Reader reader = new FileReader( file.getAbsoluteFile() \n);\n                    TestMessage testMessage = (TestMessage) readObject( \nreader );\n                    MessageStatus result = sender.send( \ntestMessage.getMessage() );\n                    assertEquals( file.getName() + &quot;(&quot; + \ntestMessage.getName() + &quot;)&quot;,\n                        testMessage.getResult(), result.getStatusCode() );\n                }\n            }\n        } catch ( Exception e ) {\n            fail( e.getMessage() );\n        }\n\n    }\n\nSo the test finds all files starting with test and ending with xml in the \nspecified directory, calls readObject() to unmarshall the XML file into my \nTestMessage object, and does the test, and checks the result.  This is all \nworking nicely, untill I wrote a test that failed.\n\nBecause this test is just that, one test, once it failed, none of the other \nXML files got processed.  So I&#39;ve been trying to think of a way around it, \na way to run my test method against each XML file as its own test.\n\nI had thought of writing a custom TestSuite which took the path, found the \nfiles, and added a custom TestCase with the filename ( instead of method \nname ), and moving the actual test code above into the custom TestCase, \nhowever I&#39;m not quite sure the best way to implement this.\n\nAny ideas?\n\nMark\n\n\n",
