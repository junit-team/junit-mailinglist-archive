    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-145634766\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt; Violating pre- and postconditions is just a small subset of what <br/>\n </span></blockquote>can go<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; wrong in your code. Unit tests often test the interplay of two or <br/>\n </span></blockquote>three<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; methods, or even of several objects. You can&#39;t do this (effectively)<br/>\n&gt; with embedded assertions.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If you use Design by Contract then the implementation can be checked <br/>\nby <br/>\nthe compiler to be valid or not. No JUnit needed. Focus on writing<br/>\nproper contracts instead of proper tests.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Do you have a pointer?<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know what you mean.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; That&#39;s wrong, as others already stated.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>But how will you test a method which returns nothing?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Asserts are even less a guarantee. Asserts need to be executed to be<br/>\n&gt; effective - if you don&#39;t have external code invoking them in a well<br/>\n&gt; directed manner, they will not be of any use until in the production<br/>\n&gt; environment.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>In my following posting I favor Design by Contract instead of just <br/>\nusing<br/>\nassert statements. I replied to myself. Read the thread when it <br/>\nappears.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If you really prefer this way, it wouldn&#39;t be too hard to include <br/>\n </span></blockquote>the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; unit tests into your production code. Most people seem to prefer to<br/>\n&gt; seperate the two.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I prefer Design by Contract. Most people don&#39;t know that paradigma.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Junit doesn&#39;t force you to develop test-driven at all.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It suggests it strongy I think. Otherwise the synchronisation of code <br/>\nand test is endangered.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; You might fear that it is. In practice, it doesn&#39;t seem to be that <br/>\n </span></blockquote>way.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you use TDD in its intended form than you lose time. Thats my <br/>\nopinion.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; minutes. There are even tools to automate this. My IDE shows me <br/>\n </span></blockquote>wether I<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; run the tests since the last code change, and an integration server<br/>\n&gt; emails me if I broke a test nevertheless.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Still much work. I prefer to concentrate on code and not on test <br/>\nquality.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; So, did that help?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\nUsing Design by Contract is in a way a medium between implementation <br/>\nand <br/>\ntests. It is not as abstract as the implementation but not so <br/>\nconcrete <br/>\nas the tests. Read my second thread (I replied to myself).</div>",
