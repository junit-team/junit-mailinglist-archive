If he lives in a world where al=\r\nl literals must be stored in a\n&gt; constant, that&#39;s not jMock&#39;s fault. That&#39;s=\r\n called &quot;tyranny&quot; and is bound\n&gt; to bad for a number of other reasons.\n\nAbo=\r\nut keeping all literals constants I coudn&#39;t agree more. But if you\nneed to =\r\nuse the same method over and over again it kind of bites when\nyou need to c=\r\nhange it doesn&#39;t it? So in a way you could say jMock\nforces you to do that =\r\n(or search replace, or not change that many\nmethods that often, or be reall=\r\ny clever when you write your tests).\n\nI think jMock tend to bite beginners =\r\na bit more than record/replay\nframeworks such as easyMock. If you are reall=\r\ny good at test-driven\nprogramming, understand interaction based testing ful=\r\nly and know all\nyour patterns and your OO-principles you will not have a bi=\r\ng problem\nwith jMock, Your test will not have that much setUp-code that the=\r\n\n&quot;declarative&quot; nature is a problem.\n\nHowever in most projects (if not all) =\r\nI have been on there have been a\nfew people that are not (yet) that great a=\r\nt TDD or OO for that matter.\nVery few have yet seen the light when it comes=\r\n to interaction based\ntesting and think that it is used primarily for isola=\r\nting your system\nfrom external systems. With that view they will use any mo=\r\nck-framework\npoorly. They make mistakes and learn from them same as we all =\r\nhave\ndone. There will be tests with too complicated setup etc, they might\nn=\r\not be your&#39;s but you may have to change them when refactoring\nsomething els=\r\ne...\n\n&gt; Still, there&#39;s a flipside to the whole &quot;can&#39;t generate a method stu=\r\nb&quot;\n&gt; argument. With EasyMock, if I use a faked or mocked method that doesn&#39;=\r\nt\n&gt; yet exist, my test can&#39;t even compile yet!\n\nYes but I see that as a goo=\r\nd thing, I totally don&#39;t see the problem.\nYou will have compilation errors =\r\nif your compiler runs automatically\nlike in eclipse but that is kind of bec=\r\nause it doesn&#39;t compile right?\n\n&gt; When I practise TDD, I often\n&gt; design int=\r\nerfaces, and forcing me to generate a method stub for a method\n&gt; I might no=\r\nt even like yet is annoying.\n\nI usually create my interfaces from tests too=\r\n and I think if anything\nRMock and Easymock promtes that: ctrl-space, done.=\r\n If you don&#39;t like\nthe method at some later =F6point, delete. I don&#39;t see h=\r\now this can be\nannoying. You allways have the oportunity not to generate th=\r\ne method\nif you until you like it and whith rMock and EasyMock you can\nauto=\r\nmatically refactor it to something you like when you know what you\nlike, wi=\r\nth jmock this is a bit harder IMHO. _I_ personally find it way\nmore annying=\r\n to replace all occurences of a method that I decided I\ndidn&#39;t like at some=\r\n point later when I know more about the system I&#39;m\ncoding than I did when I=\r\n created an interface.\n\n&gt; Keeping the methods as strings\n&gt; allows me to wri=\r\nte the test, compile it, and even run it before I decide\n&gt; whether the inte=\r\nrface or method signature is good enough to start\n&gt; putting into stone.\n\nWh=\r\nat does putting it into stone mean? It is not like you cannot change\nyour m=\r\nind once you generated your method-stub and it is not like you\ncan&#39;t refact=\r\nor it later (unless you&#39;re using jMock :))\n\nAnd what is the point in runnin=\r\ng it, nothing can possibly call your\nmocks since the methods do not exist. =\r\nTo me this is like saying using\nonly reflection instead of calling methods =\r\ndirectly is bettter because\nyou can run the code before it compiles. What a=\r\nm I missing, I don&#39;t\nsee that any value is lost with EasyMock and rMock in =\r\nthis case.\n\n&gt; As for EasyMock being more readable, EasyMock 1.x certainly w=\r\nasn&#39;t. It\n&gt; looks like EasyMock 2.0 gives jMock a run for its money, at lea=\r\nst in the\n&gt; easiest cases. The jury&#39;s out, since I haven&#39;t used it yet.\n\nI =\r\nthink that is in the eyes of the beholder. Ironically I noticed that\na lot =\r\nof people think that EasyMock is more intuitive than jMock and\nhence more r=\r\neadable until someone explains to them why jMock is more\nreadable and then =\r\nthey change their mind. So which is better?\n\nI think that EasyMock can allo=\r\nw for a bit too much messyness, that is\nwhy I prefer rMock that is more str=\r\nict and forces you to express\nyourself in a certainway rather than providin=\r\ng you with all the\noptions all the time and leave it up to you to figure ou=\r\nt how to use\nthem.\n\nRMock  also looks more like jMock when modifying method=\r\n-calls which I\nthink is nice.\n\nIf i had to choose between jMock and EasyMoc=\r\nk I&#39;m not sure what I\nwould choose. Given that I used Java 1.5 it would pro=\r\nbably be EasyMock\nbut I don&#39;t know. I have not yet found myself in a projec=\r\nt that have\nno requirements that some parts should run in earlier versions =\r\nof\nJava...\n\nThrowing rMock into the picture I would pick it for at least th=\r\ne\nfollowing reasons (except that I am involved in developing it :) ):\n\n* St=\r\nrict workflow, all tests are forcecd to have the same structure.\n* Sections=\r\n for structuring and requering order of your tests.\n* INTERCEPT! I have rea=\r\nlly started to love this feature, it is extremely useful.\n* automatical ver=\r\nification, no way around it, you cannot forget\nverifying your mocks even if=\r\n you want to\n* easy asserts for exceptions.\n* Clear error messages, while I=\r\n think EasyMock and JMock provide nice\nerrors rMocks are  IMHO nicer, they =\r\ngive you more context to be able\nto figure out what went wrong.\n* assertTha=\r\nt out of the box (I think jMock has this feature aswell)\n* Custom constrain=\r\nts and actions are easier to write, no StringBuffer\ngoo to describe your co=\r\nnstraints\n* References, among other thigs allows comparing arrays and descr=\r\nibing\nthem in a readable way. no more [B@565238fa to String messages.\n* Dyn=\r\namicTestSuites allows you to get better perfomance in your\nnightly builds b=\r\nut removes the pain of keeping TestSuites in sync.\n\nwww.rmock.sf.net check =\r\nit out!\n\nBest Regards!\n/Joakim Ohlrogge\n\n\n\n",
