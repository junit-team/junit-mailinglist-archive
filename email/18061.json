    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1685056447\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; We make so many descisions we don&#39;t ask permission for like &quot;is it ok to<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; remove this dead code?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  You don&#39;t?! I see it all the time. More specifically, I see people<br/>\n&gt;  acting as though they do /not/ have permission to remove dead code. &quot;If<br/>\n&gt;  it ain&#39;t broke, don&#39;t fix it&quot; and &quot;Don&#39;t touch it; it might break&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If I think some code needs to be removed I remove it, if I think some<br/>\ncode needs to be added I add it, if I think some code needs to be<br/>\nchanged I change it. If I feel uncertain I ask someone for more<br/>\ninformation/dig for more information before I descide what to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course it is easier to be certain if there are tests to verify that<br/>\nstuff works after I&#39;m done. In some systems I just don&#39;t know that the<br/>\ncode is dead... having permission to remove it doesn&#39;t make me more<br/>\ncertain so I tend to look for information rather than permission. Also<br/>\nif I get permission to do something it will still be my fault if I&#39;m<br/>\nwrong since permission is IME granted based on the infomration<br/>\npresented /only/... tough one... no wonder dead code tends to stay in<br/>\nsystems...<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  , can I use a factory here?,<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; can I draw a UML-diagram on the whiteboard?, can I save it in<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; documentation?, can I call a designmeeting?&quot; so why is unit-testing<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; different?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Anything that a project manager in particular might perceive as /extra/<br/>\n&gt;  time is different. That includes refactoring, testing (we have a whole<br/>\n&gt;  department for that), design meetings, and so on. Of course, it depends<br/>\n&gt;  on what activities that project manager participated in himself when he<br/>\n&gt;  wrote code.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, I&#39;m aware of that and talking about things is usually not<br/>\npreceived as extra time since talking is free and coding costs<br/>\nmoney... Writing documents also costs less money then coding right? :)<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my experience people are less interested in /how/ you work as long<br/>\nas you deliver. Working stuff is in general more apreachiated than<br/>\nbroken stuff (but that is unfortunately not always the case since<br/>\nfixing broken stuff in the last minute can make you a hero).<br/>\n<br/>\nTDD is a way of delviering things, so what keeps an individual from<br/>\ndoing it? I seldom see any eyebrows raised when developers write<br/>\nmain(String[] args) methods to test their code and I never saw any of<br/>\nthose developers ask management for permission to do that...<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; I think, if you manage to convince your team /first/ then management is as<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; good as convinced when the results start showing.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  ...but in the meantime, when the team goes through the chaos period,<br/>\n&gt;  management has plenty of time and opportunity to step and say, &quot;See? I<br/>\n&gt;  told you this stuff was extra effort. Why are you doing this? Stop<br/>\n&gt;  wasting our money.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That is true. My idea was basically that by setting a good example it<br/>\nmay rub off on others and that you can evolve gently into TDD without<br/>\nchaos... That contradicts my experience from reality but I want it to<br/>\nbe true...<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  &gt; I think by example is the best way to go, start with your self and influence<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; those around you.<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; /if/ you are convinced about the benefits of unittesting then /not/ doing<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; unittesting would be unprofessional since you choose not to do it.<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; So start doing it and infect the others. Don&#39;t have managment inject the<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; virus into an unwilling team by placing demands on testcoverage etc.<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; That will rebound in my experience.<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; So, what do you think? Should we tell the story to our fellow developers<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; instead of management?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  I don&#39;t understand why you would frame the question as &quot;instead of&quot;. Why<br/>\n&gt;  not &quot;in addition to&quot;? I think my manager deserve to know what I&#39;m doing.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Good point, I wanted to shift the image. Maybe I should have said<br/>\nshould we tell the story to the developers /and/ management I still<br/>\nthink that the biggest challenge is convincing developers. If all<br/>\ndevelopers showed conviction that TDD is the better way to go the<br/>\ndescision would be easy for management. Generally it is not like that<br/>\nand management is faced with convincing their developers that TDD<br/>\nrocks /if/ they descide to go that way and implement TDD.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also think that management has a right to know what I am doing. In<br/>\naddition to that I am not sure that management is interested in every<br/>\ndetail about how I&#39;m doing it as long as I deliver satisfactory<br/>\nresults. When we set out on crusades to convince management on the<br/>\nbenefits of TDD maybe we are making too big a deal out of it? Is there<br/>\nanyway we can start out small and evolve to where we want to go?<br/>\n<br/>\nI was on a company when I was able to convince management to let me<br/>\nrun a TDD-pilot. Since that went well demands on unittests for all<br/>\nprojects followed shortly after. The request from the projects came<br/>\nbacksoon after that on some metrics that would show that the demand<br/>\nhad been met. The reply came after some time that 70% test coverage<br/>\nwas the demand.<br/>\n<br/>\nCool! too bad I didn&#39;t get that having unit-tests is pretty worthless<br/>\nif the authors don&#39;t know why they are writing them (if only reason<br/>\ndevelopers are writing them is to reach the magic number of 70%<br/>\ntestcoverage). Some homework remained to be done...<br/>\n<br/>\nSummary: I don&#39;t know whats best. Sure, convince management.don&#39;t hide<br/>\nstuff (that was not what I meant) but /don&#39;t forget to get your fellow<br/>\ndevelopers on the train/. If they are on the train convincing<br/>\nmanagement is easier. If they are not I don&#39;t know if you have a<br/>\ncase...</div>",
