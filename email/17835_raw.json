If that&#39;s not the case, let me know.\n\nI think I&#39;m talking about API code, because that&#39;s the context Elliotte \nis mostly coming from.\n\n&gt; In some systems #1 is the best answer, but those situations are rare\n&gt; and, as a strategy, it can lead to misunderstandings.. #2 and #4 are\n&gt; great strategies and I like #6 as well.\n&gt; \n&gt; I think it&#39;s interesting to talk about #5, though. In nearly every\n&gt; other area of life, we deal with warranties and license agreements in\n&gt; which we explicitly assume responsibility for our use of products and\n&gt; services. In software we often try to protect clients from themselves\n&gt; and don&#39;t consider notice a fair grant of responsibility.\n&gt; \n&gt; The fact is, it isn&#39;t universally true. Lots of luck having Win32 save\n&gt; you from violations of its preconditions, for instance. :-)\n\nYes, but Win32&#39;s design is broken for other reasons. :)\n\n&gt; Frankly, I wouldn&#39;t want to have only #5 at the API level, but I think\n&gt; that this tendency we have to believe that we can not have an agreement\n&gt; with users that is not enforced by code leads to a great deal of\n&gt; trouble. Particularly in the area of visibility.. many developers assume\n&gt; that no written agreement can be sufficient if something is made\n&gt; public. I think that the issue is that we are not used to thinking\n&gt; about agreements beyond the code and we&#39;re not used to holding people to\n&gt; them.\n&gt; \n&gt; There are some exceptions. One is the Eclipse API Rules of Engagement:\n&gt; http://www.eclipse.org/articles/Article-API%20use/eclipse-api-usage-rules.html \n&gt; &lt;http://www.eclipse.org/articles/Article-API%20use/eclipse-api-usage-rules.html&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s a contract above the code and it has some great ideas. I really\n&gt; like the idea of &quot;soft final&quot; for instance. It&#39;s like a license\n&gt; agreement.. you can do this (subclass and override, etc) and we won&#39;t\n&gt; prevent you, but if you break the rules we can&#39;t be responsible for you.\n\nI have found in the past several years that relying on code to solve a \npeople problem is dubious at best. It might be that I now underestimate \nits effectiveness, but it seems to work better for me than \noverestimating its effectiveness, as I used to do.\n-- \nJ. B.
