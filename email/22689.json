It wasn&#39;t until I got my first job that I even heard of the concept.<br/>\n<br/>\nSimilarly (and bringing this a little more back on topic) none of my university classes covered unit testing, either.  But that was long before TDD and the whole &quot;test infected&quot; thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as I know, none of my university professors (both undergrad and graduate) had any clue about version control or unit testing, especially automated unit testing.  I just always chalked that up to them having a completely academic background, with no real world professional software engineering experience.  An important part of the first 5 years of my career was understanding the difference between how professors wanted things done and how things are done in the industry.  Nobody told me in college that they would be such different worlds.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\nTodd.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>] On Behalf Of Steve Freeman<br/>\nSent: Saturday, May 08, 2010 4:03 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [junit] When it matters most, don&#39;t forget your tests.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been doing some teaching at a major university department for 4th years and MSc students. The first year I taught the course, I had to back up and do a session on version control. A significant number of the students (including some who had worked in industry) had never seen it. The fact that one can get through a CS degree too without using version control is less surprising, but still disappointing.<br/>\n<br/>\nS.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 6 May 2010, at 19:59, Loritsch, Berin C. wrote:<br/>\n&gt; I know this opens up a huge can of worms, but it is amazing to me what<br/>\n&gt; should be standard engineering practices are neither practiced nor<br/>\n&gt; understood.
