I know\n&gt;the file sys=\r\ntem works, but does the application have the correct logic to\n&gt;walk the dir=\r\nectories and select the right files.  Some of the unit tests\n&gt;were robustne=\r\nss tests, driving the need for a number of different files\n&gt;(still checking=\r\n program logic).  \n\nOK. Let me see whether I understand.\n\nYou have already =\r\ntested your logic using a mock or in-memory file system *or* you have verif=\r\nied that your logic chooses the correct file system locations without worry=\r\ning about whether you integrate correctly with the file system.\n\nNow you wa=\r\nnt to be sure that you actually work with the file system, because there ar=\r\ne I/O and interprocess issues that could break your application even in the=\r\n presence of defect-free logic. Usually these are timing issues where the J=\r\nava code executes too quickly and changes on the file system lag behind.\n\nI=\r\ns that the situation?\n\n&gt;I needed to create a known set of files and directo=\r\nries to test one of the\n&gt;methods.  There were a number of tests.  I agree, =\r\nthere is no technical\n&gt;reason to not create/destory the file/directories ea=\r\nch time, other than I\n&gt;sometimes work on an older computer that is slow.  T=\r\nhe time to\n&gt;create/destory an interesting set of directories and files take=\r\ns time on\n&gt;the slow machine and I like to run the tests after each change t=\r\no the\n&gt;code.  (I have gotten used to a fast desktop machine which may be dr=\r\niving\n&gt;my behavior...) \n\nI agree. This is why I write as few tests as possi=\r\nble that use the real file system. I limit them to Customer Tests which hav=\r\ne to work end-to-end, anyhow, in order to be useful. For Programmer Tests, =\r\nthough, I avoid the file system altogether except to verify that I remember=\r\n how to use the file system.\n\n&gt;Could some of the test cases be integration =\r\ntests, of course.  This is a\n&gt;small home project with one developer and I h=\r\nave used Junit to test both\n&gt;methods and the application since Junit solves=\r\n all my testing needs for\n&gt;this application. \n\nAbsolutely.\n\nOK. I was just =\r\nchecking. My goal is to help people make maximal progress without worrying =\r\nabout these kinds of issues. It looks like you&#39;ve already handled that.\n\nI =\r\nstill don&#39;t understand the sense in which JUnit doesn&#39;t support one-time se=\r\ntup, though. It clearly does.\n\nTake care.\n\n\nJ. B.
