If a method is private and sufficiently\n&gt;  &gt; important that you want to test it, perhaps the class in question needs\n&gt;  &gt; to be refactored in order to improve its testability.\n&gt; \n&gt; No, it doesn&#39;t. The method can either be reached through the public API\n&gt; (in which case test that) or it can be eliminated. There&#39;s no reason you\n&gt; have to invoke a method directly to test it.\n\nAs usual, a better answer is somewhere in between.\n\nIf you want to test a private method by invoking it directly, then it \n/might/ be a sign that that method belongs on someone&#39;s public \ninterface, such as a new class. If, after reflection, the method really \nshould remain private, then you should probably test it through the \navailable public method(s) that invoke it. If you have no remaining \nalternative, then consider using something like JUnitX.\n\nAs an example, if multiple public methods invoke the same private \nmethod, it&#39;s /possible/ that that private method would be better placed \non a new class&#39;s public interface. This, however, is just a guideline.\n\nIt is instructive to take one section of your codebase and apply the \nrule &quot;All directly tested methods must be public&quot;. It will teach you \ninteresting things about object-oriented design, even if the result is \nnot necessarily the best (or even a good) design.\n\nI find when I&#39;m starting out that it&#39;s easier to follow simple rules, \nthen learn when to break those rules. For that reason, I applied the \n&quot;all directly tested methods must be public&quot; rule to a couple of \ncodebases and learned a lot. This helped me arrive at my current opinion \non the subject.\n\nI will emphasize, though, that one should remember what Elliotte has \nwritten above: /not all/ methods /must/ be tested by direct invocation.\n\nTake care.\n-- \nJ.
