My point (which came out wrong) was that if the class was<br/>\nwritten test-first then I wouldn&#39;t feel like I needed to use a coverage<br/>\ntool to be sure it&#39;s covered.  But for those projects that aren&#39;t<br/>\nwritten that way it helps to know what isn&#39;t getting covered with the<br/>\ntests (unfortunately it doesn&#39;t say too much about how well everything<br/>\nelse *is* covered).<br/>\n <br/>\nIf I did discover that a private method wasn&#39;t being covered in some<br/>\narea I would first look to see how to call the public API to cover those<br/>\ncases.  Failing that, I would figure out how to remove the code that&#39;s<br/>\nnot covered.  If calling the code via the public API doesn&#39;t cover it,<br/>\nthen it isn&#39;t serving any purpose.  If the reason I want to make a<br/>\nmethod public is because it&#39;s harder for the test to call the public API<br/>\nin that case, then I do some redesign to remove the difficulty.<br/>\n <br/>\n..David..<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>] On Behalf Of<br/>\nJim Cakalic<br/>\nSent: Thursday, September 01, 2005 12:44 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [junit] Re: How to test private methods in a class.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDavid Jackman wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Actually, if you were really following TDD then you wouldn&#39;t have<br/>\n&gt; the private method unless it was already covered by tests.  At<br/>\n&gt; least that&#39;s the methodology I use (no change happens to my code<br/>\n&gt; until there&#39;s a failing test forcing the change, except for<br/>\n&gt; refactoring).  So the code coverage tool shouldn&#39;t be (as)<br/>\n&gt; necessary.  I&#39;ve found I only use them for those project where<br/>\n&gt; (someone else :) wrote the code without writing tests first.<br/>\n&gt; In that case, it helps to know the coverage, but also can give<br/>\n&gt; me a false sense of security.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>David,<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is the way I practice TDD as well -- test first. I&#39;ve been<br/>\nlearning that not everyone is as disciplined as we are. Code coverage<br/>\ntools /can/ be a two-edged sword. I use it as an audit check for how<br/>\nwell I&#39;m adhering to TDD. Sometimes I can still slip and this helps me<br/>\nidentify my own backsliding ways early so I can correct the problem by<br/>\nadding the right tests. But you are correct, just because the code is<br/>\nbeing executed by a test does not mean that it is adequately tested.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy recommendation was that a coverage tool be used to provide<br/>\nconfidence that private methods are being executed by existing tests<br/>\nthrough the public API. The impluse that leads to making the private<br/>\nmethod public for testing might diminish if one could be shown that<br/>\nthere was no need. Do you think it would be preferable in that context<br/>\nto measure code coverage before making methods public?<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards,<br/>\nJim <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nYAHOO!
