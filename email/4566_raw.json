This project\naims at separating the GUI construction code from the mainstream code.  The GUI\nis described in an external XML file.  This way, even end-users can modify the\nGUI layout to fit their needs :)\n\nI am posting this message to this list for four reasons:\n1.  I developped the software through Test-First Design.  This list endorses\nTest-First Design, so I tought this would be a nice place to build awareness :)\n\n2.  I am searching for opinions, comments, encouragements and disapprovals on\nwhether or not this project would be useful.  I am specifically searching for\nopinions on the DTD and associated examples.\n\n3.  I have the LinkageError during the test phase of the build process (using\nAnt/JUnit task).  I was wondering if anyone would care to take a look ?  The\nincluded /lib folder contains the junit.jar that I use.  The\nexcluded.properties file contains the proper exclusion.  Maybe I am missing\nsomething else ?\n\n4.  My example files contain a reference to the DTD, but it seems that the path\nmay not be relative.  So, I am looking for a bit of help on that too.\n\nPlease bear in mind that this is a first ever alpha release, so, there is still\nlot&#39;s of documentation that is missing.  The DTD and the\nexamples/simplewindow.xml files contain comments on the building process\nitself.  You may read them for more information.\n\nThe download contains both the source code and the executable files.\n\nThis software is licensed under the GPL.\n\nTo access the project&#39;s Summary page, browse to\nhttp://sourceforge.net/projects/jgb/.\n\nFor the project&#39;s home page, browse to http://jgb.sourceforge.net/.\n\nThank you !\nFrancois Beausoleil\n\n\n__________________________________________________________\nL�che-vitrine ou l�che-�cran ?\nmagasinage.yahoo.ca\n\n",
