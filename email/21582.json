I haven&#39;t subsequently used<br/>\n&gt;&gt; this freedom to any good effect, but it seemed like a good idea at the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; time.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Does anyone have an example where this has been used to good effect?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Regards,<br/>\n&gt; Mark Thornton<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I experimented for some time with having a test class that inherited<br/>\nfrom the class under test, as a cheap way to override some methods,<br/>\nbut didn&#39;t get enough value for the design cost to continue doing<br/>\nthat.<br/>\n<br/>\n_Requiring_ test classes to extend a common base class had design<br/>\nissues.  One of the biggest was that inheritance became the favorite<br/>\nextension mechanism of JUnit extensions.  If you want to test GWT,<br/>\ninherit from GwtTestCase.  If you want to test with mocks, inherit<br/>\nfrom MockObjectTestCase.  If you want to test GWT with mocks... ack.*<br/>\n<br/>\nJUnit 4.0 got half-way to fixing this, by dropping the required<br/>\ninheritance.  I believe 4.7 will finish the job, by allowing a lot of<br/>\nthe standard extensions to use Interceptors, which are just fields.<br/>\nIt&#39;s much easier to add a field to a class than to insert an<br/>\nadditional superclass.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hadn&#39;t realized it, but if someone will raise a feature request for<br/>\na CurrentTestName interceptor, I&#39;d happily put it in for the next<br/>\nsnapshot release.<br/>\n<br/>\n   David Saff<br/>\n<br/>\n* I&#39;m picking on two tools I&#39;m familiar with, and I&#39;m not claiming<br/>\nthere&#39;s not already better ways to do this.</div>",
