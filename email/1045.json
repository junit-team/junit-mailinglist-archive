RE: Test Coverage Analysis<br/>\n&gt; To ol For Junit<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:carlos.manzanares@...\">carlos.manzanares@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I think what we are all afraid is of Steve&#39;s statement: &quot;If <br/>\n&gt; you&#39;re really<br/>\n&gt; &gt; writing code test-first you should find that you hit 98-99% <br/>\n&gt; coverage without<br/>\n&gt; &gt; breaking into a sweat.&quot; I have never liked imposed coverage <br/>\n&gt; percentages<br/>\n&gt; &gt; because not all the applications can be covered in the same <br/>\n&gt; way (some<br/>\n&gt; &gt; applications are very easy to be covered and some others <br/>\n&gt; are impossible),<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and because usually the developers start to trick with the <br/>\n&gt; tests just to get<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that percentages (and usually that tricks are not very <br/>\n&gt; &quot;quality-oriented&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and at the end they are a waste of time)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I think we&#39;ve misunderstood something here. I was not <br/>\n&gt; proposing full coverage as a requirement or anything like <br/>\n&gt; that. My point was that one of the effects of writing code <br/>\n&gt; test-first (where you shouldn&#39;t write code without a test to <br/>\n&gt; drive it) is that you get full coverage &quot;for free&quot;. Just run <br/>\n&gt; the tool from time to time to look for occasional slip-ups <br/>\n&gt; and stop worrying about it.<br/>\n&gt; We all know that coverage, in itself, does not prove that <br/>\n&gt; you&#39;ve executed every possible path, just as unit tests do <br/>\n&gt; not _prove_ that your code has no errors, but it gets you a <br/>\n&gt; lot of the way there.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Steve<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
