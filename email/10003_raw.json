In my\nopinion, this is truly dreadful behavior. Yet there seems to be no way\nto modify this behavior without changing the source code. And this is\nbecause of what is, IMHO and with all due respect to Beck and Gamma,\nbad design: all the Assert.assert* methods are static.\n\nWhile a discussion of the design decisions in junit would probably be\nenlightening, that&#39;s not my goal; here. I would just like suggestions\nof how to get the strings, in their entirities, into the output.\n\nPerhaps the answer is to write my own subclass of TestRunner, but then\nI would have to figure out how to integrate the new TestRunner into\nJBuilder.\n\nAny help would be appreciated.\n\n\n\n",
