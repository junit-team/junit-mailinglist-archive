It&#39;s not quite so much of a problem, but being OC as we are<br/>\nit&#39;s a royal annoyance, and I was hoping the list could help.<br/>\n<br/>\nBackground: I&#39;m using Eclipse 3.0.0, Ant 1.6.2 and JUnit 3.8.1<br/>\n(Windoze 2K). The code I&#39;m writing and testing uses Hivemind 1.0 to<br/>\ndynamically create my objects and wire them together.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy Eclipse project is set up just fine. The Ant scripts do their<br/>\nthing. Running the &quot;compile-all&quot; target from either within Eclipse or<br/>\nvia Ant on the command-line is A-OK.<br/>\n<br/>\nA have JUnit tests that run fine when run within Eclipse whether<br/>\nindividually or as a suite.<br/>\n<br/>\nI then created a &lt;junit&gt; task within the project&#39;s Ant build scripts<br/>\nto run the suite. When I ran the Ant &quot;test-XXX&quot; targets _from the<br/>\ncommand line_, everything worked as expected.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s the rub: When I run the same Ant targets from _within Eclipse_,<br/>\nI get a bunch of java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError exceptions (when using<br/>\nthe Hivemind stuff).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I&#39;ve noticed is that when I run the test targets in Eclipse, the<br/>\nSystem property &quot;java.class.path&quot; is missing a couple of directories,<br/>\nmost notably, my project&#39;s ${build} directory.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m still trying to figure out what&#39;s causing this (remember, the<br/>\nbuild itself works either way, and only the tests are failing in<br/>\nEclipse) but was wondering if anyone&#39;s done this before or has had any<br/>\nsimilar experiences and might be able to point me to a few leads?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance!<br/>\nAlistair A.
