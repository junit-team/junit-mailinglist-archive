NUnit has an attribute called\n[Ignore(string mesg)] that you can attach to a test case. This essentially\nworks the same as the _ignore name change. The progress bar turns yellow and\nyou get all the statistics.\n\nWhat&#39;s nice about C# in this regard is you can create your own attributes (they\nare just classes that can be reflected on at runtime,) to do various things. Is\nthere a way to approach this in Java/JUnit with XDoclet, AspectJ or some other\nmethod?\n\nGoing further, I&#39;d like see a modification of TestRunner that externalizes the\nrunnable states of test cases for a given fixture. I see a repeated pattern of\nusage with JUnit: after a refactoring, some test or tests break. You want to\nfocus on those, either by fixing them or the code. Eliminating the rest of the\ncases while narrowly focusing on a few can be time consuming if there are many.\n\nIt would be handy to have a GUI or file to indicate some or all of the tests to\nbe ignored. In the case of the file (for command line/Ant usage,) a pattern\nsimilar to the TCP wrappers accept or deny files. If a file called junit.ignore\nexists, it is read for the cases to ignore. A special case called ALLCASES\nwould ignore the entire named fixture. After that, a section for cases to run.\nThese would be the short list of cases to run while the others are ignored.\n\nThis file could act as the serialized state of the GUI component which would\nhave a bunch of check boxes and buttons to Ignore ALL, Run All. There could\nalso be a nested element in Ant&#39;s JUnit task to accomplish this. (Ant does have\nif/unless &quot;property&quot; but that is still per test.)\n\nDoes anybody else think this is a good idea?\n\nEd\n\n\n\n\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nThe New Yahoo!
