This seems to be a legitimate <br/>\ncode smell.  However, that doesn&#39;t mean you will always decide to do <br/>\nso.  In those cases, testing them, as private methods, is necessary, <br/>\nIMHO.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne technique we use, with Java, is to implement our JUnit TestCases <br/>\nas static inner classes.  This gives you the access you require.  It <br/>\nalso provides other benefits, especially with TDD.  It makes managing <br/>\nthe source a lot easier.  You only have to check in/out one file from <br/>\nSCM.  That way you never, ahem, forget the test code.  It&#39;s always <br/>\nmarried to the app code.  This helps enforce a mindset that the test <br/>\ncode is just as important as the app code.  And it&#39;s really <br/>\ncomfortable to bounce up and down the single file in your editor as <br/>\nyou iterate between writing test code and app code.  Deployment is <br/>\nnot a problem, since inner classes are compiled into seperate class <br/>\nfiles, using the AppClass$TestClass.class naming convention.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour mileage may vary, but it works pretty well for us.  I&#39;d be <br/>\ninterested in others&#39; approaches, as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the way, I&#39;m new here.  Nice to meet you all!</div>",
