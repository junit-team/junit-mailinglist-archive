You&#39;ve made that point, but I&#39;ve tried to counterpoint it, that isn&#39;t converging. I think this need to be in the framework for this to work with all environments & add ons.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I&#39;ve not been missing your point (not completely, although I get it more<br/>\n&gt; &gt;each time) but this is the crux of my argument: If (big IF) suites are<br/>\n&gt; &gt;testcase dependencies, <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; They absolutely, positively are NOT. I cannot stress this enough. A TestSuite is an arbitrary collection of Test objects, and nothing more.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;You&#39;ve been having your cake and eating it, between e-mails -- not a good diet for thought. ;-)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;One time you tell me to create hierarchies of suites to control run order (what I&#39;d like as dependency) and now you say this. Right now suites (and hierarchies of suiteS) are the closes thing to dependencies. That we agree upon, right?<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Personally I&#39;d like to leave suites as collections of test cases, and I&#39;d like a separate concept for dependency. That said, I&#39;ll discuss it either way, please pick one.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Here is the crux of the problem with your argument.  As far as I <br/>\nunderstand unit testing using an xUnit framework and as part of the XP <br/>\nprocess.  The existence of test interdependencies (outside of thread <br/>\ntesting) is a code smell which is avoided.  If the xUnit framework were <br/>\nto support the concept of dependencies it would be promoting a specific <br/>\ncode smell which it is intende to avoid. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn Kent Beck&#39;s book Test Driven Development by Example one of the TDD <br/>\npatterns is called Isolated Test,  he asks the question: &quot;How should the <br/>\nrunning of your tests affect one another?&quot; and answers himself: &quot;Not at <br/>\nall.&quot;  If you have to test a series of functions as a group which have <br/>\nto all be completed to constitute success, then do those all in one <br/>\ntestFunction.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat really is it.  No dependency concept exists, because it is <br/>\nsomething to discourage.  Dependencies are a sign that the code needs <br/>\nmore decoupling and more refactoring.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is one of the most significant issues with my current work <br/>\nenvironment.  I have so much work to do to decouple each piece I work on <br/>\nfrom our testing database, which I have no control over.  I have to <br/>\ndecouple of I want to have tests that can be run in a reasonable amount <br/>\nof time, with a minimum of coding effort and that I can be assured won&#39;t <br/>\nbe broken by changes in the data in the database.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy boss keeps saying to me, why can&#39;t we just test in the database, and <br/>\nforce the tests to run in a specific order.  I resist, though I can&#39;t <br/>\nconvince him.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the example, in Kent&#39;s book he relays the experience of having a test <br/>\nsuite that would run overnight, and sometimes nothing would break and <br/>\nother times he&#39;d get a printout of many pages with all of his bugs.  It <br/>\nturned out that the large printout usually meant one test failed and <br/>\ncaused cascading failures through the rest of the tests due to <br/>\ndependencies. <br/>\n<br/>\nDavid B.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mangr3n@...\">mangr3n@...</a></div>",
