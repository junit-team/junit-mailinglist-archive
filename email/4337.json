For instance, it seems to me that we could catch these<br/>\n&gt; errors instead of letting them fall through and stop the execution of the<br/>\n&gt; application.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Thank you for volonteering :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is (IMHO) wrong to catch these errors. The goal of the application is <br/>\nto run _all_ the tests, and not only those who could be successfully <br/>\nloaded.  The developer must know that some of his/her tests couldn&#39;t be <br/>\nexecuted because of a linkage error.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Vladimir<br/>\n-- <br/>\nVladimir Bossicard<br/>\nwww.bossicard.com</div>",
