Other higher level APIs are built on the high level APIs.\n\nI have written unit tests for each of these APIs.\n\nThese unit tests can be run in any sequence, however: I&#39;d like to specify\nthat the unit tests for the lower level APIs should be run first.\nWhen these tests pass, the higher level APIs can be tested, having some\nconfidence that the lower level works.\n\nThe reason is that when an error occurs in a low level API, it&#39;s easier to\ndiagnose when it occurs in the unit test for the lower level API, rather\nthan as a result of the higher level API calling the low level API.\n\nWhen I add tests to a TestSuite using one of the addXXX() methods, is the\nsequence of adding the tests the same sequence if which the tests are run?\n\nIf not, how can specify that a subset of all tests &#39;should&#39; be run in some\nsequence? (Note: not *must*, the unit tests can still be run in *any*\nsequence, but I&#39;d like the stuff that tests the low level parts of the code\nto run first)\n\nIf TestSuite does not respect the sequence of the addXXX() calls for the\nrunning of the tests, can I implements this by extending TestSuite?\n\nThanks in advance for any comments on this! (I&#39;m pretty new to unit testing\nin general)\n\ntt \n\n\n\n",
