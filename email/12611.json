So, given my limited<br/>\n&gt;&gt; knowledge of your problem domain, I might have a test case like this:<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;    public class OneSalesOrderLineTest extends TestCase {<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;      public void setUp() {<br/>\n&gt;&gt;        // fixture for one sales order line<br/>\n&gt;&gt;      }<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;      public void testCreateMultipleCustomerPurchaseOrderEntries() {<br/>\n&gt;&gt;      }<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;      public void testSomethingElseAboutOneSalesOrderLine() {<br/>\n&gt;&gt;      }<br/>\n&gt;&gt;    }<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Close, except I don&#39;t make the mistake you&#39;ve (purposefully) made<br/>\n&gt; here, including the &#39;multiple&#39; test with the &#39;oneLineItem&#39; test.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That wasn&#39;t purposeful.  I thought you were trying to test that  <br/>\nmultiple customer purchase order entries could be created for one sales  <br/>\norder line.  In retrospect, you&#39;re probably testing the inverse of  <br/>\nthat.  The example is arbitrary, and I think we&#39;re on the same page  <br/>\nhere anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; Does using a separate test case help with the ambiguity?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m not sure what you mean here.  I&#39;m trying to disambiguate this<br/>\n&gt; testcase with another testCase that is named similarly:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; testMultipleCustomerPurchaseOrderEntriesForManySalesOrderLinesWithDupli <br/>\n&gt; cates();<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If I recall, you also have another test method of this name:<br/>\n<br/>\n   testMultipleCustomerPurchaseOrderEntriesForOneSalesOrderLine()<br/>\n<br/>\nBoth of these have a common base name:  <br/>\nMultipleCustomerPurchaseOrderEntries.  Often this is trying to tell me  <br/>\nthat I&#39;m missing a a test case class, for example,  <br/>\nTestMultiplePurchaseOrderEntries.  That class would include tests for  <br/>\nmultiple purchase order entries.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr, to invert it the other way, perhaps I need two different test case  <br/>\nclasses: OneSalesOrderLineTest and ManySalesOrderLines.  Each of those  <br/>\nclasses would include a test method called  <br/>\ntestMultipleCustomerPurchaseOrderEntries(), for example.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; I often use that technique, as well.  By writing out prose, I find<br/>\n&gt;&gt; words that I&#39;d like to use in the test method name.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; True, and most often I do the same thing.  But there are cases where I<br/>\n&gt; felt that the prose held more information than the method name I came<br/>\n&gt; up with.  I&#39;d already written the prose, so I left it to guide me in<br/>\n&gt; the implementation, and describe the situation to the maintainers.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That sounds reasonable.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I think folks are overstating my intentions a bit:  I&#39;m *not* saying<br/>\n&gt; that *all* tests need javadoc documentation, I&#39;m not even saying that<br/>\n&gt; most of them do.  The only point I&#39;m making is that occasionally you<br/>\n&gt; need it, and not shipping the javadoc (the original question) makes<br/>\n&gt; that occasional-but-important information unavailable to whoever is<br/>\n&gt; using the unit tests.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I hear you, and I agree.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf by &quot;shipping the JavaDoc&quot; you mean not shipping the HTML that the  <br/>\n&#39;javadoc&#39; tool produces, then I&#39;m simply saying that the  <br/>\noccasional-but-important information is still available in plain text.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich leads back to the original question about distributing JavaDoc  <br/>\nfor test classes.  I don&#39;t deliver it because my tests generally don&#39;t  <br/>\ninclude JavaDoc tags, and in the rare case they did, a maintainer still  <br/>\nhas access to the information in the test source.  When I distribute a  <br/>\nlibrary, I do include the JavaDoc for its API.  Readers of that  <br/>\ninformation seem to me to be a different audience altogether.<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\nMike Clark<br/>\nClarkware Consulting, Inc.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clarkware.com\">http://clarkware.com</a></div>",
