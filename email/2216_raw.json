This presumes that the calculate method is\n&gt; already tested and working properly.\n&gt; \n&gt; But that begs the question, if the only functionality of the state change\n&gt; method is to forward a call to some other objects calculation method, is it\n&gt; necessary to test the method in the TreeHolder class?\n\nIf the forwarding is anything but very very simple, I prefer to test it.\nYou can test (a) if the correct set of nodes has been chosen for\nforwarding (b) if the correct method in the nodes is called. IMO this\nholds enough potential for (future) failure. \nTo be frank, I personally test even the most trivial delegation method.\nWith those tests in my back I haven&#39;t got to add many tests during\nrefactoring. Adding lots of tests when refactoring breaks my flow.\n\nJohannes\n\n",
