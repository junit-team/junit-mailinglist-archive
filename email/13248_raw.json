I woul=\r\nd think\nabout using composition in some of those places. (Or aren&#39;t you act=\r\nually\ntalking about inheritance here?)\n\n&gt; I would prefer to organize my tes=\r\nts with a similar hierarchy\n&gt; structure\n\nWhy?\n\n&gt; Also I would like to initi=\r\nalise the objects needed in the\n&gt; appropriate level for the childs to make =\r\nuse of them without doing\n&gt; them again. \n\nI&#39;m not sure I understand this. C=\r\nare to elaborate?\n\n&gt; 1. Have a single parent without testXXX methods do the=\r\n on\n&gt; demand initialisation at the top level and all Uts inherit\n&gt; from thi=\r\ns single parent. And have Uts in a single level. In\n&gt; the above case BizDoc=\r\nUt & PurchaseRequestUt will be in the\n&gt; same level.  BizDocUt initialises s=\r\nome objects in the helpers\n&gt; and make available for all Uts.  Or if Purchas=\r\neRequestUt is\n&gt; run first it initialises first all Bizdoc objects so that\n&gt;=\r\n BizdocUt can run w/o initializing them again.\n\nSo are you saying the Bizdo=\r\nc objects are global to the tests? What does it\nmean to &quot;initialize&quot; them? =\r\nWhere are the hold?\n\n&gt; 2. Maintain the heirarchy of Ut and use the Test sui=\r\nte in all\n&gt; Ut classes to add the child tests only.\n\nSounds like unecessary=\r\n work to me.\n\n&gt; Guys - don&#39;t you feel this is a very common need for any OO=\r\n\n&gt; application.\n\nFrankly, no, I don&#39;t feel it is. It rather looks to me as =\r\nif your design is\nsuboptimal, and that your testing problems are just a sym=\r\nptom of that. I\ndon&#39;t know enough to be sure, though.\n\n&gt; I am surprised JUn=\r\nit doesn&#39;t provided this\n&gt; flexibility directly.\n\nThat&#39;s because the invent=\r\nors of Junit, and many of it users, don&#39;t just\nwrite unit tests to tests th=\r\ne system, but use writing tests as a *design*\ntechnique. If they encounter =\r\na problem when trying to write Junit tests for\ntheir system, they first thi=\r\nnk about what the system needed to look like to\nnot have those problems, an=\r\nd often find that refactoring it to that\ndirection improves the overall dec=\r\noupling and flexibility.\n\n&gt; I have posted my requirement for\n&gt; Logical flow=\r\n of tests which is also good to have.  JUnit has these\n&gt; missing.\n\nIt can b=\r\ne added to Junit without a problem, it is flexible enough to allow\nthat. It=\r\n&#39;s not at the core of Junit because many of its users actually think\nthat n=\r\needing a &quot;Logical flow of tests&quot; is a thing that should be avoided.\n\n&gt; I ca=\r\nn hack(override) into jUnit to support these but I do\n&gt; not want to maintai=\r\nn this for every release.\n\nIf you want, you can write a TestSuite implement=\r\nation that uses reflection\nto only call the test methods declared directly =\r\nin a class (that is, not the\ninherited ones). I think it would take me less=\r\n than an hour to do so. In\nyears of using Junit, I never felt the need to d=\r\no that, though.\n\n&gt; JUnit folks..are you hearing...?\n\nCertainly. Are you, to=\r\no? ;)\n\nTake care, Ilja\n\n\n",
