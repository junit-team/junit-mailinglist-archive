Should it?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The only problem is that a single form could have its behavior driven by<br/>\n&gt; some data lying inside the depth of the application itself.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, in nearly every application, when something happens deep within the<br/>\napplication, the gui is used to communicate with the user.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; The main fact stil remains: do you all have successfully used JUnit in order<br/>\n&gt; to make GUI testing?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>We come full circle to the first question I asked this morning - what do you<br/>\nwant to test? GUI is too big - what specifically about the GUI do you want<br/>\nto test? You CAN test everything except aesthetics. I try very hard to move<br/>\nany logic out of the gui (and you really do have to work at it) and<br/>\nsomeplace where I can test it, and rely on visual inspection to test the<br/>\ngui. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nRobert Koss, Ph.D.     | Training, Mentoring, Contract Development<br/>\nSenior Consultant      | Object Oriented Design, C++, Java<br/>\nwww.objectmentor.com   | Extreme Programming</div>",
