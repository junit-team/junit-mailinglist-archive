One of the\n&gt; reasons is:\n&gt; \n&gt; Berin Loritsch wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt;The reason being that sometimes the semantics and internals of the\n&gt;&gt;way TestCase is written gets in the way of how I want to make JUnit\n&gt;&gt;work in my environment.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I never had such problems due to TestCase being a class. Could you give an\n&gt; example?\n\nPart of this comes from my Component Based Design background.  An\ninterface is a document of contracts.  Your contracts are always with\nthe interface.  The reason for it is so that the implementations can\nchange wildly without breaking the contracts.  Version 4 of JUnit would\nbe able to work with Version 1 code if the contracts remain the same.\nThat is not always the case with an object hierarchy.\n\nThe problem with altering behavior based on a class hierarchy in the\nway that JUnit does it is that it is neither polymorphic, nor interface\nbased.  It is somewhere in the middle--which is not clear.  Altering the\nbehavior of a TestCollector based on the TestCase/TestSuite\nimplementations means that if I had my own implementation of the Test\ninterface I don&#39;t know how it is going to be handled.  Interfaces do\nnot require you to have the same base class.  When used properly, that\nis a definite *strength*.  When used improperly, it causes problems\nin predictability.\n\nMy point is that the contracts with the Test interface are not defined\nclearly enough.  If I have to write a test harness (which I do BTW) that\nworks quite differently than the core JUnit TestCase, then I am SOL.  I\ncan&#39;t take advantage of any of the features that I would otherwise be\nable to expect with the relationship between TestCase and TestSuite.  I\nmight be able to have a bunch of individual Test objects--which in some\ncases might be even better, but my objects would not be treated the same\nas the TestCase/TestSuite.\n\nFor instance, I need to have a setup where I instantiate a component\ncontainer, and the tests.  I want the tests to automatically collect all\nthe testXXXX() methods and execute them.  However I can&#39;t do that unless\nI extend TestCase.  I can&#39;t extend TestCase because of other mitigating\ncircumstances.\n\nLastly, when your contracts are fixated with the *interface* and not the\nabstract class, you do not depend on the internals of the abstract\nclass.  There are some of those dependencies.  Logic for running a test\nshould not be included in the TestCase itself.  The only thing that\nshould be in a TestCase are the individual testXXX() methods and\npossibly the setUp()/tearDown() methods.\n\n-- \n\n&quot;They that give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety\n  deserve neither liberty nor safety.&quot;\n                 - Benjamin Franklin\n\n\n",
