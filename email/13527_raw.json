And then one day,\n&gt; your mock tests run fine but the production code\n&gt; breaks, and you enter a\n&gt; world of pain.  Trust me, it&#39;s not pretty.\nHi Cedric\n\nPerhaps some examples of this?  I am not proposing an\nanswer myself but as a learning experience I would\nlike to see an example of where you used something\nlike a mock or in-memory database and then got caught\nout with the &quot;real thing&quot;.  \n\nI am thinking that if this happened to me it would\nshow me where I should write another test perhaps?  \n\nFor example what are things that have gone wrong\ntesting against Postgresql and then using against\nOracle?  Can we write a test that assures that our\ncode does not have that problem?\n\nWith a concrete example it would also be good to get\nother&#39;s opinions on how the problem could have been\navoided (or not).\n\nCheers\nShane\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
