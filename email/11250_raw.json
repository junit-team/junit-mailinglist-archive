I&#39;m a\n&gt; student and I&#39;m doing a research about how JUnit could be used in my\n&gt; company to improve the efficiency of software development. What my\n&gt; bosses, not knowing a lot about JUnit, only having heard of it, first\n&gt; wanted to have was a piece of software which tests an existing\n&gt; application on a technical level. (like &quot;one Button tests all&quot;)\n\nIt is impossible to write software that tests other software. I don&#39;t \nknow the proof, but then, I don&#39;t need to be convinced. :)\n\n&gt;  &gt;From what I know now, JUnit is a framework for the developer to\n&gt; improve the quality of the application and to avoid failures in the\n&gt; code which might otherwise be overseen. \n\nThat sounds about right.\n\n&gt; Now here&#39;s my question: does\n&gt; it make sense to take an existing application and try to write test\n&gt; cases/suites for it?\n\nDoes it make sense? Absolutely. Why not have more confidence in the \ncorrectness of your software?\n\nDoes it make sense for /this/ company, in /these/ market conditions, \n/now/? That depends. Like anything else, the company needs to decide how \nto spend its money, and testing existing software may or may not be high \nenough on the priority list.\n\nThe need to test existing software is, in my opinion, a function of the \nneed to change it. Changing software without tests is expensive because \nit&#39;s slow going (programmers are afraid to make the changes) and prone \nto error (programmers are right to be afraid). It is much easier and \nsafer to change software when, after each change, I can run a suite of \ntests that can tell me about the impact of my change. Since we spend \nmost of our time changing existing software, it is common to want/need \nto test existing software.\n\n &gt; The application is a rather abstract one\n\nApplications can&#39;t be abstract. Frameworks are abstract, and \napplications are concrete.\n\n&gt; ...it&#39;s a\n&gt; middleware component (API) between one big and several smaller\n&gt; applications, it consist of several EJBs with basically lots of get-\n&gt; Methods, using JAX-RPC SOAP and RMI.\n\nWhether it&#39;s middleware or not, you must be able to define &quot;working&quot; or \n&quot;not working&quot; for various parts of the components. If you can do that, \nthen you can write tests.\n\n&gt; I doubt it makes sense, but I don&#39;t have a lot of experience about\n&gt; what JUnit is capable of and how the code would have to be refactored.\n\nWhy don&#39;t you think it makes sense? What are three reasons you wouldn&#39;t \nwrite tests for this code?\n\n&gt; I guess it would make more sense telling the developers why and how\n&gt; to use JUnit in order to improve things in FUTURE developments and to\n&gt; stick with the old code without JUnit. What do you think?\n\nThis is a common strategy: add tests to existing code /only/ when you \nneed to change the existing code. This helps us spend only the money we \nknow we need to spend on testing existing code. Often, this minimizes \nthe cost of maintaining the existing code.\n\n&gt; PS: Sorry I can&#39;t give you more information about the application I\n&gt; was talking about, I&#39;m still in the process of understanding how it\n&gt; works and I&#39;m not a Java-pro (yet:-).\n\nUnderstood.\n-- \nJ.
