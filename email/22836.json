Because i have an own Ignore Annotation which i want to use on method and class level i wrote my own RunnerBuilder. If i use suites i can integrate them easely but not when using the default runner which seems to use the AllPossibilitiesBuilder (via JUnitCore) by default with no way to override. As far i have not seen other ways to implement this behavior. <br/>\n<br/>\nAny suggestions?</div>",
