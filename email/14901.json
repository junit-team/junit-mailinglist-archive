    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-621899470\">Bradley, Todd wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Hi, I&#39;d like to propose a controversial topic, which is to somehow split<br/>\n&gt; up the JUnit email list into two lists - one for beginners and one for<br/>\n&gt; intermediate-to-advanced users.  I cherish the discussion on this list<br/>\n&gt; about meaty topics of unit testing and using and extending JUnit.  There<br/>\n&gt; are some very smart people here!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; However, I frankly have reached the limit of my tolerance for stupid<br/>\n&gt; questions in this list.  And by &quot;stupid questions&quot; I mean the opposite<br/>\n&gt; of Eric Raymond&#39;s &quot;smart questions&quot;<br/>\n&gt; (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html)\">http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html)</a>.  There seems to be<br/>\n&gt; no end to the steady stream of new members who sign on and immediately<br/>\n&gt; ask a question that&#39;s already answered in the JUnit FAQ, which every new<br/>\n&gt; member automatically receives.  I know hitting the delete key 5 or 10<br/>\n&gt; times a day isn&#39;t a huge deal, so I guess it&#39;s just the principle of it<br/>\n&gt; all.  I consider it rude for people to not have the courtesy to at least<br/>\n&gt; make an effort to help themselves.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; But I thought that rather than just unsubscribing from the list, I&#39;d<br/>\n&gt; toss this message out to see if anyone else is in the same boat as me.<br/>\n&gt; There are supposedly over 6000 subscribers, which sure sounds like a big<br/>\n&gt; enough population to allow some specialization.  Alternatively, if<br/>\n&gt; dividing the <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a> list isn&#39;t likely to happen, does<br/>\n&gt; anyone know of a similar forum for &quot;intermediate-to-advanced&quot; users of<br/>\n&gt; JUnit with a better S/N ratio?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Todd, I appreciate your concern and have raised that myself, in the <br/>\npast. I would find it difficult to stay on this list myself, if it <br/>\nweren&#39;t so low traffic. Also take into consideration the number of posts <br/>\nwe already reject, because the questions are too basic. If we don&#39;t <br/>\nencourage the general public to post their questions, then who will we <br/>\nhave to discuss interesting topics with in a few years?<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
