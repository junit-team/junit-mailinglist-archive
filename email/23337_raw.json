Plea=\r\nse let me know if JUnit will be\n&gt;\n&gt; good enough for web application =A0test=\r\ning(server code in java). Is it\n&gt;\n&gt; true that &quot;The JUnit code will be compl=\r\nex and hard to maintain. You\n&gt;\n&gt; will have to reproduce all of the interact=\r\nions between code and user\n&gt;\n&gt; within the Junit test, which very quickly be=\r\ncomes complex. If all you\n&gt;\n&gt; are doing is testing one single entry point, =\r\nthen this could well\n&gt;\n&gt; work, but if you are testing multiple screens (a w=\r\nizard or something\n&gt;\n&gt; like that), then it can quickly become fragile and u=\r\nnmanageable.&quot;?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I will be moving to watij if Junit is not good enoug=\r\nh for web app\n&gt;\n&gt; testing.
