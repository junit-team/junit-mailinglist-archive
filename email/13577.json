This <br/>\ncourse will be taught in a variety of formats and lengths ranging from <br/>\n90-minute seminar to one or two day hands on tutorial to a traditional <br/>\nuniversity setting. Obviously how much I can cover and how deep I can go <br/>\nwill vary depending on format, length, and audience level.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m wondering if anyone has any good ideas for examples to use in this <br/>\ncourse? Ideally I&#39;d like something that&#39;s simple enough to do in a day, <br/>\nbut still gives attendees a feeling that they&#39;ve developed something <br/>\nreal. I could possibly do something involving the Mandelbrot set or <br/>\ncellular automata. However, I&#39;d prefer something a little less <br/>\nmathematical if possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d like it to have a GUI component, but at the same time I&#39;d like that <br/>\nto show up fairly late in the application, and for the application to <br/>\nstill make sense if there&#39;s not time to cover testing GUIs.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt should be possible to develop this program on a laptop not connected <br/>\nto the Internet. i.e. no databases access, network communications, web <br/>\nservices, the U.S. tax code, and so forth.<br/>\n<br/>\nStudents will have a wide variety of backgrounds so I want to avoid any <br/>\nspecial knowledge of subjects like XML processing, financial <br/>\nderivatives, quantum physics, and so forth. I should be able to cover <br/>\nthe background necessary to start writing the program in 10 minutes or <br/>\nless.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny ideas?<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nElliotte Rusty Harold  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:elharo@...\">elharo@...</a><br/>\nXML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/\">http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim\">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!
