The responses at least \nconfirm that this should not happen if all of my \nassumptions are correct.\n\nThe ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException has happened only \nonce that I noticed.  If it is due to a bug, somewhere\nin class Vector or somewhere in the JVM or in some underlying\nnative method, then it won&#39;t be an easy one to find.\n\nIn the meantime, I will have to make an explicit check \nfor the Exception, so that I don&#39;t inadvertantly miss it \nnext time, and  also capture as much information as possible.\n\nIf it does occur again, I will try out the suggestions.\n\nThanks again.\n\nregards,\n\nJames\n\n&gt; From: Mike Clark &lt;mike@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: Re: [junit] Off-topic: How is ArrayIndexOutOfBounds possible?\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n\n&gt; Just to rule out the possibility that another thread is removing the \n&gt; last element from the vector in between the isEmpty() and remove() \n&gt; statements, you could explicitly synchronize the steps, as in\n&gt;\n&gt;     synchronized(inMsgQueue) {\n&gt;         if(!inMsgQueue.isEmpty()) {\n&gt;             msg = (SimpleMsg) inMsgQueue.remove(0);\n&gt;         }\n&gt;     }\n&gt;\n&gt; Just something to try...\n\n&gt; Mike\n\n\n&gt; Peter Spitz wrote:\n\n&gt; &gt; The only thing I can think of is that the isEmpty() function is returning a\n&gt; &gt; value of &quot;false&quot; even if the array is empty. I&#39;d put in a test for that.\n&gt; &gt; This sounds silly to me even as I&#39;m typing it, but it&#39;s the best I can do\n&gt; &gt; and maybe it will trigger some other helpful thoughts.  \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Peter\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; &gt; From: James Sinnamon\n&gt; &gt; Dear Junit Users,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Sorry for this off-topic message, but it is posible that someone may be\n&gt; &gt; able to offer some useful advice:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; When I tested a program recently,  I got the error:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: Array index out of range: 0\n&gt; &gt;        at java.util.Vector.remove(Vector.java:806)\n&gt; &gt;        at org.multipi.ActorMailSorter.run(ActorMailSorter.java:33)\n&gt; &gt;        at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:484)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ... it seems to be telling me that an attempt to remove element 0\n&gt; &gt; of a vector, is causing a fatal error.  The code which triggered this\n&gt; &gt; error is:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;      if(!inMsgQueue.isEmpty()) {\n&gt; &gt;         msg = (SimpleMsg) inMsgQueue.remove(0);\n&gt; &gt;        ...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; .... where inMsgQueue is a Vector.  Now assuming that there are no other\n&gt; &gt; Thread\n&gt; &gt; processes trying to remove elements from the vector (and I believe this\n&gt; &gt; to be the  case), should it be possible for this error to occur?  From my\n&gt; &gt; understanding of  Vector\n&gt; &gt; objects, this should not be possible.\n\n",
