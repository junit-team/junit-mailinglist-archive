Add it&#39;s jar to the project from Project-&gt;Properties- <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt;Java Build Path-&gt;Libraries.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Also, you don&#39;t need that suite() method to run your tests in  <br/>\neclipse.  Just use Run-&gt;Run... and set up a JUnit test configuration  <br/>\nto run all the tests in your Project/folder/package, etc.  Much  <br/>\nsimpler in that you don&#39;t need to keep adding the test method names  <br/>\nin twice.<br/>\n<br/>\n[snip]<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nDaryl<br/>\nself email: ( daryl at: eddl dot: us )</div>",
