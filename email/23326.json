If it turns out to be the wrong thing<br/>\nto do, I&#39;d have to break code to take it out. I always deprecate and leave<br/>\nit in for a good long while, but even that&#39;s ultimately a code break, just a<br/>\nnicer way to do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI did always have in mind I&#39;d like to support use cases of doing things in<br/>\nthe interpreter, but am not sure yet how people actually use it. I tend to<br/>\nflesh out working code one bit at a time, with little &quot;tests&quot; I guess you<br/>\ncould call them. But they aren&#39;t formal tests. After I get it working I put<br/>\nit into the source and then write a more formal test for it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I&#39;ll do initially is format the output of TDD traits, enable color by<br/>\ndefault when using execute(), provide a way to turn color off when using<br/>\nexecute(), and add a summary at the end. That I&#39;m sure about.<br/>\n<br/>\nBill<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Sat, Mar 12, 2011 at 5:07 AM, Joakim Ohlrogge &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:joakim.ohlrogge@...\">joakim.ohlrogge@...</a><br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Hi Bill,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Glad my poking around with this was somewhat inspiring. Technically I<br/>\n&gt; haven&#39;t done anything that can&#39;t already be done with ScalaTest and my hopes<br/>\n&gt; are that rather than spawning off a new framework, the good ideas are<br/>\n&gt; adopted in other frameworks and the bad ones die with this one. Right now<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m primarily interested in running tests and poking around in the results<br/>\n&gt; rather than easing the testwriting itself. I&#39;m also curious where I can go<br/>\n&gt; with JUnit as a primary foundation, basically conforming to rather than just<br/>\n&gt; interfacing with JUnit. Mostly for fun. I decided to make it all public in<br/>\n&gt; case it would be interesting to anyone else and for reference when blogging<br/>\n&gt; etc.<br/>\n&gt; How I &quot;solved&quot; pending and pendingUntilFixed was to use an AssumptionFailed<br/>\n&gt; exception since it is the closest thing to an ignored exception in JUnit.<br/>\n&gt; Since the existing runners don&#39;t treat the assumption-errors as ignored I<br/>\n&gt; simply output &quot;pending &lt;reason&gt;&quot; messages on the console when being run. It<br/>\n&gt; would be better to have the tests marked as ignored in eclipse but works as<br/>\n&gt; a workaround.<br/>\n&gt; Quite early I got an idea about some primary goals when running from the<br/>\n&gt; REPL and the most important one was:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; minimize typing - completion is not always available in the REPL (from<br/>\n&gt; eclipse, intellij and to my surprise even emacs (though there must be some<br/>\n&gt; way to pass the tab along down to the repl?))<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Examples of where this has led me:<br/>\n&gt;  * Only one import<br/>\n&gt;  * short package name even if it violates javas recommendations<br/>\n&gt;  * package object with shortcuts to common stuff and a few implicits<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I really wanted scala tests easy executing of tests from the REPL. The<br/>\n&gt; JUnitCore approach is less elegant IMO and it seems like a System.exit in<br/>\n&gt; the the cores main shuts down the REPL. That could be worked around of<br/>\n&gt; course by instatiation JUnitCore and passing the classes to run. A problem<br/>\n&gt; here from a scala perspective is that Java&#39;s way to get a Class instance<br/>\n&gt; &lt;ClassName&gt;.class rolls off my fingers a bit more naturally than scalas<br/>\n&gt; classOf[ClassName] (habit I guess). Long story short, I much prefer<br/>\n&gt; scalatests way and I think it&#39;s not strange that a language with a REPL<br/>\n&gt; inspires more thought in this department. My solution here was dynamic<br/>\n&gt; mixins (or static if one prefers). So with a simple &quot;with Basics&quot; you can<br/>\n&gt; run any JUnit compatible test from the REPL.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Now came the issue with customizing the output. I decided to put that<br/>\n&gt; outside the TestCase completely. It feels like a runtime decision. This is<br/>\n&gt; when &quot;run&quot; changed to really mean &quot;select&quot; (but the method on interaction is<br/>\n&gt; still called run). Basically, the run method just returns a list of<br/>\n&gt; Callable[Result]-instances and the BriefReport calls the one by one and<br/>\n&gt; prints out the result. This way, the running and the reporting is nicely<br/>\n&gt; separated and which testing style you choose has no bearing on the output<br/>\n&gt; you see. The brief method could be paired with a verbose method if one<br/>\n&gt; wishes more verbose output.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Now came the color/no color issue. Color feels like an aspect of reporting.<br/>\n&gt; This might be a case of golden hammer but to represent this aspect as a<br/>\n&gt; stackable trait felt quite nice. Especially when creating instances of a<br/>\n&gt; report: new Brief with Color. One could easily imagine expanding in this<br/>\n&gt; direction: new Brief with Color with Summary with SourceDump with<br/>\n&gt; StackTraceFiltering with LongRunningTestTopList ExecutionTimeStatistics ...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The only problem (ok there are several probably by the obvious problem<br/>\n&gt; anyway) is keeping the default as elegant as ScalaTest&#39;s spec.execute hence<br/>\n&gt; the package object in the poju4s package that allows me to write brief(spec)<br/>\n&gt; instead.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If I want to run just a few tests that can be done like this (here I assume<br/>\n&gt; I have already renamed the run-method to select):<br/>\n&gt; brief(spec.select(&#39;example1, &#39;example2))<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The fun part comes when I add glob:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; biref(glob(&quot;package/*/*Spec&quot;)) or with an implicit:<br/>\n&gt; brief(&quot;package/*/*Spec&quot;).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I agree that named parameters also makes sense, or a combination:<br/>\n&gt; spec.execute(color=FunkyScheme, options=List[StackTraceFiltering,<br/>\n&gt; SourceDump, ExecutionTimeStatistics])<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I also tought about some sort of parameter dsl:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; spec.select(&#39;example1, &#39;example2) &gt;&gt;: StackTraceFiltering &gt;&gt;: Color &gt;&gt;:<br/>\n&gt; SourceDump &gt;&gt;: StdOut<br/>\n&gt; (not sure that would work or that I would like it but... as long as we&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; tossing up ideas)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; As you say, when something fails what one really wants to see is which<br/>\n&gt; tests failed. That is a missing part from my output, just effectively<br/>\n&gt; managed to clear those pesky succeeding tests out of the way while still<br/>\n&gt; mantaining some feedback that they were actually run. I intend to address<br/>\n&gt; that as you suggested, list the failing pending and ignored tests in the<br/>\n&gt; summary. I also intend to let the run return some sort of Gist or Summary<br/>\n&gt; object that allows one to poke around a bit more in the result (after all it<br/>\n&gt; is a REPL so why shouldn&#39;t one be able to interact with the result?).<br/>\n&gt; Examples of what one could do &quot;post&quot;-running is to dump captured std-out,<br/>\n&gt; stacktraces, executiontimes etc, list all the names of all tests of a given<br/>\n&gt; status or what have you. I think the best is to leave the information sort<br/>\n&gt; of naked and then scalas excellent collection API can do it&#39;s magic of<br/>\n&gt; filtering, grouping and mapping to the users desire. Why not conveniently<br/>\n&gt; allow rerun just failed tests in this way?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; There is really no reason why these things need to be isolated to just<br/>\n&gt; JUnit, in fact it feels like my original idea is much less interesting then<br/>\n&gt; to actually explore running and reporting from the REPL in general. For now<br/>\n&gt; it is convenient to focus on just one framework but perhaps in the future<br/>\n&gt; the good parts can be distilled into a more framework agnostic run/report<br/>\n&gt; framework or the most sensible thing is to just leave the ideas out there<br/>\n&gt; with a liberal license so that the ones that work can be adopted by<br/>\n&gt; framework-vendors as they please... I&#39;m not sure what is best yet but the<br/>\n&gt; license is chosen to not be an issue for this to happen :).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Long story short: one import seems to be a good idea, separating running<br/>\n&gt; and reporting seems to be a good idea, and there seems to be some room for<br/>\n&gt; innovating when running tests from the REPL...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks for listening to my ramblings! It&#39;s so much fun to play with these<br/>\n&gt; things without the worries of actually maintaining it for years and years :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -----------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Joakim Ohlrogge<br/>\n&gt; Agical AB<br/>\n&gt; V�sterl�nggatan 79, 2 tr<br/>\n&gt; 111 29 Stockholm, SWEDEN<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Mobile: +46-708-754004<br/>\n&gt; Blog: johlrogge.wordpress.com<br/>\n&gt; E-mail: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:joakim.ohlrogge@...\">joakim.ohlrogge@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On Sat, Mar 12, 2011 at 1:25 AM, Bill Venners &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bill@...\">bill@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Hi Joakim,<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; On Fri, Mar 11, 2011 at 3:18 PM, Joakim Ohlrogge &lt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:joakim.ohlrogge@...\">joakim.ohlrogge@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; If anything useful comes out of it it can be contributed for sure.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; I&#39;ve chosen a quite liberal license (Beerware :)) in case someone else<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; feels inspired to borrow/steal or contribute.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; I&#39;m a bit inspired. I&#39;m sure you&#39;re aware that there&#39;s a lot of stuff in<br/>\n&gt;&gt; ScalaTest to make writing JUnit tests in Scala more productive. And perhaps<br/>\n&gt;&gt; you&#39;re aware you can run ScalaTest tests in the Scala interpreter by<br/>\n&gt;&gt; invoking execute on them. So for example given this test:<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; import org.scalatest.junit.JUnitSuite<br/>\n&gt;&gt; import scala.collection.mutable.ListBuffer<br/>\n&gt;&gt; import _root_.org.junit.Test<br/>\n&gt;&gt; import _root_.org.junit.Before<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; class HowSuite extends JUnitSuite {<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;   var sb: StringBuilder = _<br/>\n&gt;&gt;   var lb: ListBuffer[String] = _<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;   @Before def initialize() {<br/>\n&gt;&gt;     sb = new StringBuilder(&quot;ScalaTest is &quot;)<br/>\n&gt;&gt;     lb = new ListBuffer[String]<br/>\n&gt;&gt;   }<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;   @Test def verifyEasy() {<br/>\n&gt;&gt;     sb.append(&quot;easy!&quot;)<br/>\n&gt;&gt;     assert(sb.toString === &quot;ScalaTest is easy!&quot;)<br/>\n&gt;&gt;     assert(lb.isEmpty)<br/>\n&gt;&gt;     lb += &quot;sweet&quot;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;   }<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;   @Test def verifyFun() {<br/>\n&gt;&gt;     sb.append(&quot;fun!&quot;)<br/>\n&gt;&gt;     assert(sb.toString === &quot;ScalaTest is fun!&quot;)<br/>\n&gt;&gt;     assert(lb.isEmpty)<br/>\n&gt;&gt;   }<br/>\n&gt;&gt; }<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; You could run it in the interpreter like this (both ScalaTest and JUnit<br/>\n&gt;&gt; need to be on the classpath):<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; user-64-9-237-191:scalatest-1.3 bv$ scala -cp<br/>\n&gt;&gt; scalatest-1.3.jar:junit-4.4.jar<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to Scala version 2.8.0.final (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Java 1.6.0_22).<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Type in expressions to have them evaluated.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Type :help for more information.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; scala&gt; :load HowSuite.scala<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Loading HowSuite.scala...<br/>\n&gt;&gt; import org.scalatest.junit.JUnitSuite<br/>\n&gt;&gt; import scala.collection.mutable.ListBuffer<br/>\n&gt;&gt; import _root_.org.junit.Test<br/>\n&gt;&gt; import _root_.org.junit.Before<br/>\n&gt;&gt; defined class HowSuite<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; scala&gt; (new HowSuite).execute()<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Test Starting - line5$object$$iw$$iw$HowSuite: verifyEasy<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Test Succeeded - line5$object$$iw$$iw$HowSuite: verifyEasy<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Test Starting - line5$object$$iw$$iw$HowSuite: verifyFun<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Test Succeeded - line5$object$$iw$$iw$HowSuite: verifyFun<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Just create a new instance and call execute on it and it will run. (This<br/>\n&gt;&gt; is a JUnit 4 test class, so JUnit can run it jut fine. In this case you&#39;re<br/>\n&gt;&gt; asking ScalaTest to run it, though what ScalaTest does is turn around and<br/>\n&gt;&gt; ask JUnit to run it, capturing and displaying the results.) If you want to<br/>\n&gt;&gt; run just one of those tests you can specify it by name:<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; scala&gt; (new HowSuite).execute(&quot;verifyFun&quot;)<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Test Starting - line5$object$$iw$$iw$HowSuite: verifyFun<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Test Succeeded - line5$object$$iw$$iw$HowSuite: verifyFun<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; And you can pass in config map of configuration information to execute if<br/>\n&gt;&gt; you want.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; It works, but it is ugly. The output has two problems. One is that because<br/>\n&gt;&gt; I loaded the class with :load into the interpreter, instead of compiling it,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; I get very long names for the class name with lots of dollar signs. So one<br/>\n&gt;&gt; enhancement would be to drop everything to the left of the first dollar<br/>\n&gt;&gt; sign. I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;m doing that somewhere else in ScalaTest, so I could<br/>\n&gt;&gt; do it here.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; The other annoyance is you get info on both TestStarting and<br/>\n&gt;&gt; TestSucceeded, two lines of info for each test. What I originally did was<br/>\n&gt;&gt; only format the output of BDD style test traits, because BDD was in part<br/>\n&gt;&gt; about output that looks like a spec, and TDD was not. But I&#39;ve gotten clear<br/>\n&gt;&gt; feedback that people using the non-BDD traits would like pretty output too,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; so I&#39;ve already decided to change that. So it should soon look something<br/>\n&gt;&gt; like:<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; scala&gt; (new HowSuite).execute()<br/>\n&gt;&gt; HowSuite<br/>\n&gt;&gt; - verifyEasy<br/>\n&gt;&gt; - verifyFun<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Another thing I did originally was not show color when you use execute(),<br/>\n&gt;&gt; because I wasn&#39;t sure how to let people turn color off, and I felt it was<br/>\n&gt;&gt; worse to force color on people whose terminals didn&#39;t support it than the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; other way around. But people really like color. It is pretty and makes it<br/>\n&gt;&gt; more readable. So what I&#39;d like to do is figure out some way to let people<br/>\n&gt;&gt; configure color, full stack traces, and durations when using execute. Now<br/>\n&gt;&gt; that Scala has default params, that&#39;s probably the right way to do it. So<br/>\n&gt;&gt; color would be the default, and to turn it off you&#39;d say:<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; scala&gt; (new HowSuite).execute(color = false)<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; And lastly, your dots idea is interesting. Whenever I run with a standard<br/>\n&gt;&gt; out reporter, I get lots and lots and lots of green test names that passed.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; And what I really care about is the ones that failed. So I think it may make<br/>\n&gt;&gt; sense to add one more option to the standard out/err and file reporters that<br/>\n&gt;&gt; just shows one dot for each passed test. And then that could possibly be the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; default for execute, maybe.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; And lastly lastly, maybe execute should show a summary line at the end,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; like the runner does.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; As far as getting JUnit to do something like pending and<br/>\n&gt;&gt; pendingUntilFixed, that will be tough until JUnit can treat some kind of<br/>\n&gt;&gt; exception specially. Be nice to have a TestIgnoredException that gets<br/>\n&gt;&gt; reported as an ignored test in JUnit someday.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Bill<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;  Lets see where it goes. Right now it&#39;s mostly for fun.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; /J<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; -----------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Joakim Ohlrogge<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Agical AB<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; V�sterl�nggatan 79, 2 tr<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; 111 29 Stockholm, SWEDEN<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Mobile: +46-708-754004<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Blog: johlrogge.wordpress.com<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; E-mail: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:joakim.ohlrogge@...\">joakim.ohlrogge@...</a><br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; On Fri, Mar 11, 2011 at 8:13 PM, David Saff &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:david@...\">david@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Joakim,<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Not silly at all.

I feel that the scala tools are lacking<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; in...<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; inderstanding of the TDD/BDD approach (which is just a feeling).<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Long<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; story short, I want to do something like scalaTests<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; pendingUntliFixed<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; which basically makrs a failing test as ignored until it stops<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; failing<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; where pendingUntilFixed will start failing the test saying that<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;test<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; was marked as pending but did not throw an exception&quot;  (so that you<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; will not accidentally leave pendingUntilFixed in for code tests<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; that<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; work.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; I realized that this is very easy to do in JUnit from scala.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Something<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; like this:<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;  def pendingUntilFixed(body: =&gt; Unit) = {<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;    (try {<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;      body<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;      false<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;    }<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;    catch {<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;      case e:Throwable =&gt; true<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;    }) match {<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;      case false =&gt; error(&quot;Test was marked as pending but did not<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; fail&quot;)<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;      case true =&gt; ()<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;    }<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;  }<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;  @Test<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;  def someFailingTest = pendingUntilFixed {<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;    assertThat(true, is(false))<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;  }<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;  @Test<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;  def someFixedTest = pendingUntilFixed {<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;    assertThat(true, is(true))<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;  }<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; The problem is that pending tests are marked as succeding when they<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; fail. It would be cool if I could somehow mark them as Ignored<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; instead. Is there some exception I could throe that would<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; accomplish<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; this? I sort of thought that AssmptionError would be logical to be<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; displayed as ignored instead of succeeding hence the title.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Ideas?<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; -----------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Joakim Ohlrogge<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Agical AB<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; V�sterl�nggatan 79, 2 tr<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; 111 29 Stockholm, SWEDEN<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Mobile: &lt;%2B46-708-754004&gt;+46-708-754004<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Blog: johlrogge.wordpress.com<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; E-mail: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:joakim.ohlrogge@...\">joakim.ohlrogge@...</a><br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
