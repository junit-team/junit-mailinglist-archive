I may have misspoke (miswritten) earlier. Remember <br/>\n&gt; that classes do not inherit class-level methods, like suite(). Could that <br/>\n&gt; be related to your problem?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I was not clear, the tests get run when you roll &#39;em up in the superclass<br/>\ntest case, but they *are* instances of that super class (not the sub class).<br/>\nAnd I was supplying different flavours of a test fixture (as well as testing<br/>\ndifferent sublcasses) to the super class test case by overriding a<br/>\ngetTestObject() in the super class test case that normally returned null.<br/>\nOnce I rolled up the tests in the sub class test case, the correct test<br/>\nfixture was used by the test methods in the super class. This works fine.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut it is a bit ugly/complicated, since I have guards in some of my tests in<br/>\nthe super test case that check for a null test fixture as well as test for<br/>\nwhether I an testing a subclass or not. The idea was to have a test case<br/>\nhierarchy that mirrored the class hierarchy that was being tested. This has<br/>\nhaving common (for the super class and all subclasses) tests there. So if<br/>\nthe mirrored class (of the super test base) is concrete the super test case<br/>\ncan roll up a concrete instance of his mirror and test that mirror. The<br/>\nalternative is to have an abstract test case in between the two that just<br/>\nhas common stuff for the sub test cases. This of course breaks the mirror :(<br/>\n<br/>\nthanks</div>",
