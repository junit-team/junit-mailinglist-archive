It \nalmost acts like a security feature - so that you can&#39;t run it ouside \nof VAJ. JUnit uses that method, that means that it will never return \ntrue unless running in VAJ.\n\nI&#39;ve been stuck on this problem way too long - There must be somekind \nof solution to it! Unless JUnit is designed specifically to avoid \nbeing run outside of VAJ. I&#39;m on the verge of giving up.\n\nIf you have any other solution in mind, I would really appreciate it.\n\nThanks so much.\n\nLily.\n\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;J. B.

They should let the Model objects containing \nbusiness\n&gt; &gt;logic &quot;do with them what they may&quot;. There is a tendency in OOP to \npretend\n&gt; &gt;there is behavior where there is no behavior. I think that is a \nmistake.\n&gt; &gt;Some objects in the system are just bags of data. I think public \nfields\n&gt; &gt;should do nicely there. Ward Cunningham has been experimenting with\n&gt; &gt;ignoring the prevaling paranoia against public data. I haven&#39;t \nseen him\n&gt; &gt;write anything on it yet, but it&#39;s good to test long-\nstanding &quot;rules&quot;.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;I agree with that when it is applied to &quot;data structures,&quot; the \nnaked\n&gt; &gt;objects you refer to, but not behavioral objects.  I don&#39;t think \nyou\n&gt; &gt;were applying it to the latter, I just wanted to be clear.\n&gt; \n&gt; Exactly. I&#39;m with you. Sometimes, it&#39;s just a bag of data. Maps \nwould do.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; One counterexample is an object with 20 fields. Perhaps 20 set \nmethods\n&gt; &gt;is clearer, at least in a language like Java with positional \nparameters.\n&gt; &gt;(In Smalltalk it&#39;s exactly the same, so it doesn&#39;t matter.) Should \nan\n&gt; &gt;object have 20 fields? Perhaps not, but some do. It is not clear \nthat\n&gt; &gt;breaking that 20-field objects into four 5-field objects is any \nbetter.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;A twist on that... If that object needs to have 20 fields (which I \ndon&#39;t\n&gt; &gt;believe it does) you can group fields together into other objects \nsuch\n&gt; &gt;that this object is a wrapper on 5 others, each with 4 fields.  \nThe data\n&gt; &gt;is still in one place, but it&#39;s creation is much less cumbersome \nand you\n&gt; &gt;can create it in a sane state.\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t know that this is better: now I have to build five or six \nobjects, and not just one. I think the creation is *no less* \ncumbersome in this case. That has been my observation.\n&gt; \n&gt; Take care.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; J. B.
