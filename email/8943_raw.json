Hope when you said you had test\nan EJB or made a remote call you would have done all\nthe initial setup - lookup and stuff like that. If you\nhave not done then you please make sure that you have\nthe rmi connection to your server is established and\nyour ejb lookup is clean and sucessful. \n\nAnd may be its a good idea if you could check various\nother Testing frameworks to test EJB&#39;s or server side\ncomponents, like HTTPUnit/Cactus(*).\n\nThis answer wouldn&#39;t be of much help, but could at\nleast helps you to check other testframe works\nspecific to j2ee.\n\ncheers\n-arun\n\n\n --- sree devi &lt;amulya_333@...&gt; wrote: &gt; Hi\nfriends,\n&gt;     I have a doubt and I believe that you people can\n&gt; help me.\n&gt; \n&gt;     My questions are:\n&gt; 1) Does junit support EJB?\n&gt; \n&gt; 2)Does junit support RMI?\n&gt; \n&gt; 3)I have a method that returns a javabean object.The\n&gt; method works \n&gt; fine else where but, when invoked in the test case\n&gt; it returns a \n&gt; null.What could be wrong?\n&gt; \n&gt;      I request you to take a few seconds to answer\n&gt; these \n&gt; questions.\n&gt; Thanking you.\n&gt; Sincerely,\n&gt; Sreedevi Giridhar.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; Yahoo!
