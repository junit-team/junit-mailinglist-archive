After some research, I figure out that the\nproblem was the J2ME sandbox. I created my first test\ncase to test a simple class used by a MIDlet, and it\ndidn&#39;t work because it&#39;s not possible to do something\nlike that:\n\npublic static void main (String args[])\n{\n       The J2ME code...\n}\n\nAnd i think that what the framework do, right? Well,\nas I said before, it&#39;s impossible to do that because\nof the J2ME sandbox. I looked for some kind of recipe\nin the JUnit Recipes book, but I didn&#39;t find anything\nabout that or about other kinds of sandbox tests\n(Indeed, i didn&#39;t looked in J2EE chapters, maybe\nthere&#39;s something about test a servlet, but I&#39;m not so\nsure if it also has a sandbox concept). So, do you\nknow a solution to my problem?\n\nBrunno Silva\n\n__________________________________________________\nFa�a liga��es para outros computadores com o novo Yahoo!
