JExample extends JUnit to take care of these dependencies. If the producer fails, all consumers are skipped. And even better, a producer can return its fixture as return value and consumers can well consume the cache value as arguments. The framework takes care to clone return values that are used  by more than one consumer.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://scg.unibe.ch/jexample\">http://scg.unibe.ch/jexample</a><br/>\n<br/>\ncheers,<br/>\nAdrian<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;trenton_adams2001&quot; &lt;trenta@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi Guys,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m just wondering.  Have the JUnit developers considered adding dependency annotations to JUnit?  You could annotate your code with say <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;@TestDependency Test1 public void myTest() {code;}&quot;, which would cause myTest() to depend on Test1 running it&#39;s tests first.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; A scenario where this might be needed...<br/>\n&gt; 1. Test1 inserts DB records<br/>\n&gt; 2. Nightly job runs (but can be run manually by user)<br/>\n&gt; 3. Test2.myTest() then runs, as #2 has completed, and myTest() now has data that can be used.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In the case of #2, it would need to give the user enough time to run the nightly job, manually.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m wanting to test everything in a totally automated way.  But at this point, it is not entirely possible.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I just wanted to ask about this, as you guys probably have a lot more experience in why this is or is not a good idea.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
