We\n&gt; are now looking at Agitator and trying to determine if, and how, it\n&gt; fits into our current practices.  I was wondering how others have\n&gt; decided to use Agitator (or not use it).  Some of the issues we are\n&gt; struggling with:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1.  Agitator looks like it can eliminate the need to write most JUnit\n&gt; tests (except true persistence testing).  The downside is that we\n&gt; would be left with only Agitator config files that contain our\n&gt; business logic assertions.  This seems like a big leap to take, given\n&gt; that if Agitar goes away, we have no JUnit.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2.  Agitator mocks and factories look easy to create, but look like\n&gt; they are only useful in the context of Agitator.  I couldn&#39;t use them\n&gt; for other purposes (e.g. Fitnesse, JUnit).\n&gt; \n&gt; 3.  Having my business logic tests in JUnit means they are in an\n&gt; understood format and things such as inputs and expected results are\n&gt; clearly visible and grouped with each test.  My impression of\n&gt; Agitator is that this wouldn&#39;t be as clear.\n\nI find the notion that Agitator outcomes replace JUnit tests to be at \nbest questionable and at worst troubling. It&#39;s steeped in the notion \nthat TDD is about testing, and it isn&#39;t.\n\nIf your team wants to practice TDD, then it can use Agitator to \nsupplement help find tests you missed when you were test-driving your \ncode. As you get better at TDD, you rely on Agitator less, but there \nwill always be some gap between the tests you need to test-drive your \ndesign and the tests you need to cover your codebase adequately (say, \n85%). For top TDD practitioners, that gap is very small, but for people \nstill learning to write JUnit tests and do TDD, the gap is larger. In \nthis case, Agitator helps quite a bit.\n\nAlso, Agitator can help retrofit tests to legacy code, however it \n/doesn&#39;t/ help you identify the specific design problems in that code, \nnor does it motivate you to improve the design. This might or might not \nconcern your team at this time.\n\nOn my next real Java project, I will probably want to use Agitator to \nhelp me find tests I missed, but not to replace writing any particular \nJUnit tests. Without those tests, I don&#39;t design well.\n\nTake care.\n-- \nJ. B.
