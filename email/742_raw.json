The unit testing process forces you to think about the\ninterface of the class under test.  So, not only are you testing the\nencapsulated logic of the class, but the client interface is also\nsubjected to a &quot;design&quot; test.\n\nMike\n\n--- ghouston@... wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; One thing to watch out for:  Existing classes that are hard to test!\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve built tests on existing code and frequently I see classes that \n&gt; are very hard to test.  This happens because the classes were \n&gt; originally developed without Unit Testing in mind.  For a class to be\n&gt; \n&gt; easy to test, it needs to follow good Object Oriented Design \n&gt; practices where the class is well encapsulated and has little \n&gt; coupling with other classes.\n&gt; \n&gt; [Note:  I&#39;ve also seen Unit Testing improve the design.  Making the \n&gt; classes testable makes for better encapsulation and lower coupling]\n&gt; \n&gt; Putting Unit Tests on existing code can get very ugly.  Some classes \n&gt; may not be worth Unit Testing until they are first refactored into \n&gt; something more easily tested.  This refactoring is beneficial but \n&gt; costly.  You will have to make the cost-benefit determination to see \n&gt; if you should Unit Test the difficult code, refactor it, defer it.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
