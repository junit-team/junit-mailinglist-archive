I&#39;ve grabbed XMLUnit for\nJUnit and have set up a basic XMLTestCase, however the biggest problem\nI have now is dealing with my files included by the XSL under test.\n\nSo this question may be more about structuring development directories\nthan actually using XMLUnit.\n\nFrom my project&#39;s root in my development environment, I have my XSL\nfiles in this directory:\n\n./web/xsl/html4/&lt;my XSL files here&gt;\n./web/xsl/html4/include/&lt;common files I include in &#39;base&#39; XSL files&gt;\n\nWhere . is the root of the project as checked out from my version\ncontrol (other subdirectories besides /web are /src, /test, /lib,\netc.)\n\nBut my XSL include files are written to access the include directory\nassuming they are being executed from the web application context --\nthat is, here&#39;s a sample include line:\n\n&lt;xsl:include href=&quot;/WEB-INF/xsl/html4/includes/commonIncl.xsl&quot;/&gt;\n\n\nWhen I run XMLUnit on my XSL file, the above line fails as the\ntransformer can&#39;t find the resource\nfile:/WEB-INF/xsl/html4/includes/commonIncl.xsl.\n\n\nHow do you normally structure your build directories or handle this\ninclude problem when testing XSL files outside of the container?\n\nThanks for your advice, and Happy New Year,\n\nDan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
