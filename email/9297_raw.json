Build your own mp3 headers to test with\n2) Write a set of tests for #2. Compare headers read in with those you\nbuild. It would be extra nice if you can reuse the headers you built for\n#1. \n3) Write a test for #3 that just takes a test file, and renames it and\nthen changes it back.\n4) Write a test for #4 that looks for files in a test directory. Add\nvariations for boundary conditions. \n5) Acceptance test: given a test directory full of files (of various\ninteresting variations), run the utility and validate that the files\nhave been renamed correctly\n\nNote 1: it is assumed that you will be including assertions in your\ntests above that validate that you are getting what you expect.\nNote 2: Your focus in tests #2, #3, and #4 is validating that you are\ncalling the library code correctly, rather than the testing the library\ncode itself.\nNote 3: It could be argued that for a small application like this you\ncould write test #5 first without all the other tests and if it works\nthen you are done. That runs counter to test-first and misses all the\ndesign and documentation benefits you get from that. Plus if it doesn&#39;t\nwork you&#39;ll wish you had tests #1-4 to help you isolate the problem.\n\n\n-----------------------------\nMike Silverstein\nSilverMark, Inc.\nThe Object Testing Company\nwww.javatesting.com\n**********************************\n* Makers of &quot;Test Mentor&quot;        *\n* and &quot;Enhanced JUnit&quot; Java      *\n* component testing tools        *\n**********************************\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Brian Forsythe [mailto:sycophant@...] \n&gt; Sent: Sunday, September 07, 2003 11:24 AM\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com; testdrivendevelopment@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: [junit] How (or whether) to test this\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m a relative neophyte to unit testing.  I don&#39;t have much \n&gt; trouble in writing tests for new code for existing apps, but \n&gt; can&#39;t seem to get my head around test-first from the ground \n&gt; up on a new app.\n&gt; \n&gt; As an example, I recently wrote a small utility that views \n&gt; the header info of an mp3, and renames the file from the \n&gt; information contained therein.  You pass it (on the command \n&gt; line) the name of a directory or file, and a &#39;template&#39; which \n&gt; includes the format of the name it should generate.  If a \n&gt; file is passed, it renames the file.  If a directory is \n&gt; passed, it recursively renames all files in the directory.  \n&gt; An example name template would be something like &quot;%b - %n&quot; \n&gt; for &quot;Artist - Track Title&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; I actually got halfway finished with it, then deleted all of \n&gt; my code, since I hadn&#39;t done it test-first, but then couldn&#39;t \n&gt; think how to go about testing it.  I&#39;m using an external lib \n&gt; (jd3lib) for reading mp3 header info, and the standard \n&gt; java.io stuff for file manipulation. Every test I can think \n&gt; of would just test external code (reading mpeg header info, \n&gt; file renaming, etc), so I&#39;m somewhat at a loss.  Is there \n&gt; anyone out there who&#39;d like to get me started with a couple tests?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanx much,\n&gt; BRiaN\n&gt;\n\n---\nOutgoing mail is certified Virus Free.\nChecked by AVG anti-virus system (http://www.grisoft.com).\nVersion: 6.0.510 / Virus Database: 307 - Release Date: 8/14/2003\n \n\n\n",
