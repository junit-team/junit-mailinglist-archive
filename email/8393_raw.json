It \n&gt; almost acts like a security feature - so that you can&#39;t run it ouside \n&gt; of VAJ. JUnit uses that method, that means that it will never return \n&gt; true unless running in VAJ.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve been stuck on this problem way too long - There must be somekind \n&gt; of solution to it! Unless JUnit is designed specifically to avoid \n&gt; being run outside of VAJ. I&#39;m on the verge of giving up.\n&gt; \n&gt; If you have any other solution in mind, I would really appreciate it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks so much.\n&gt; \n&gt; Lily.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;J.

They should let the Model objects containing \n&gt; business\n&gt; &gt; &gt;logic &quot;do with them what they may&quot;. There is a tendency in OOP to \n&gt; pretend\n&gt; &gt; &gt;there is behavior where there is no behavior. I think that is a \n&gt; mistake.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Some objects in the system are just bags of data. I think public \n&gt; fields\n&gt; &gt; &gt;should do nicely there. Ward Cunningham has been experimenting with\n&gt; &gt; &gt;ignoring the prevaling paranoia against public data. I haven&#39;t \n&gt; seen him\n&gt; &gt; &gt;write anything on it yet, but it&#39;s good to test long-\n&gt; standing &quot;rules&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;I agree with that when it is applied to &quot;data structures,&quot; the \n&gt; naked\n&gt; &gt; &gt;objects you refer to, but not behavioral objects.  I don&#39;t think \n&gt; you\n&gt; &gt; &gt;were applying it to the latter, I just wanted to be clear.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Exactly. I&#39;m with you. Sometimes, it&#39;s just a bag of data. Maps \n&gt; would do.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; One counterexample is an object with 20 fields. Perhaps 20 set \n&gt; methods\n&gt; &gt; &gt;is clearer, at least in a language like Java with positional \n&gt; parameters.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;(In Smalltalk it&#39;s exactly the same, so it doesn&#39;t matter.) Should \n&gt; an\n&gt; &gt; &gt;object have 20 fields? Perhaps not, but some do. It is not clear \n&gt; that\n&gt; &gt; &gt;breaking that 20-field objects into four 5-field objects is any \n&gt; better.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;A twist on that... If that object needs to have 20 fields (which I \n&gt; don&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt;believe it does) you can group fields together into other objects \n&gt; such\n&gt; &gt; &gt;that this object is a wrapper on 5 others, each with 4 fields.  \n&gt; The data\n&gt; &gt; &gt;is still in one place, but it&#39;s creation is much less cumbersome \n&gt; and you\n&gt; &gt; &gt;can create it in a sane state.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t know that this is better: now I have to build five or six \n&gt; objects, and not just one. I think the creation is *no less* \n&gt; cumbersome in this case. That has been my observation.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Take care.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; J. B.
