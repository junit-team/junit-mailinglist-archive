And if \n&gt; you have, how\n&gt; big was the=\r\n effort to sort out the real problem? My guess is \n&gt; that going all\n&gt; the w=\r\nay to define dependencies for every subclass relation is \n&gt; not worthwhile;=\r\n\n&gt; at least not for me.\n&gt; \n&gt; Johannes\n\nMe personally? Not that regularly; h=\r\nowever, I can see where some people might like to set that condition. But, =\r\nmy Java work so far has always been in the sub-75k-line range so I am not w=\r\norking on the large programs. In my C++ experience, I have had is-a relatio=\r\nnships at 10+ depth with these conditions sitting throughout. So, I can ima=\r\ngine that people working on very large Java programs might run into the sam=\r\ne thing.\n\nActually, I am thinking that the unit test only needs to identify=\r\n those relationships that are linked. Thus the vast majority of tests would=\r\n run regardless, but when they saw a relationship is linked it knows not to=\r\n run the test when the first test failed. If the programmer begins to link =\r\ntoo much then they are using a unit tool to test integration - something th=\r\nat it is not meant to do.\n\n\n\nChip\n-----\nProgramming: Its not just a job - i=\r\nts an indenture \n\n",
