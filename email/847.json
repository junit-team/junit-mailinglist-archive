But I don&#39;t think printing directly to stdout or stderr is<br/>\nwhat we want.  Something more general would be better.<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps BaseTestRunner should define:<br/>\nvoid runFailed(String message, Throwable t)<br/>\n{<br/>\n  runFailed(message);<br/>\n}<br/>\n<br/>\nThen subclasses can override the new runFailed if they want access to<br/>\nthe exception or error that caused the failure.  Obviously, the calls to<br/>\nrunFailed() in BaseTestRunner would have to be changed, which is simple.<br/>\n<br/>\ntextui.TestRunner.runFailed() can then be changed to print the whole<br/>\nstack trace, as you&#39;ve suggested.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Sameer<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; I&#39;m not sure if this is the right place to post this suggestion for a <br/>\n&gt; future feature of JUnit. I hope so.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I think adding the following two lines to the &quot;getTest&quot; method of <br/>\n&gt; the &quot;BaseTestRunner&quot; class would save people a lot of debugging time.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \t  System.out.println(e.toString());<br/>\n&gt; \t  e.printStackTrace();<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; They would go right after the line with &quot;Could not invoke the suite() <br/>\n&gt; method&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I made the change to my copy of JUnit and it pointed me right to a <br/>\n&gt; classpath problem (after spending at least an hour guessing at what <br/>\n&gt; was wrong).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; However, as soon as the new version of JUnit is available, I&#39;ll lose <br/>\n&gt; the change. It&#39;s not hard to redo but I don&#39;t want to forget.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks,<br/>\n&gt; Peter </span></blockquote></div>",
