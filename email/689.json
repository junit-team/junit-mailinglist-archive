As Beck wrote: &quot;Pair programming is a dialog between two people trying<br/>\nto simultaneously program and understand how to program better&quot;. But<br/>\nhow to make sure this pair&#39;s relationship cooperative instead of<br/>\ncompetitive(in negative sense)?<br/>\nFor example, we can not always push two people sitting together<br/>\nand wish they can get along and do the work more effectively than one.<br/>\nAdditionally, I always see the senior people with stronger option than<br/>\njunior guy. Do you think it is possible to let them communicating equally?<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you<br/>\nJason<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nBest regards,<br/>\n junit_jason                          mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit_jason@...\">junit_jason@...</a></div>",
