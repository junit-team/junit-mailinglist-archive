But perhaps this is &#39;BAD&#39; (tm)?\n&gt; \n&gt; I value testing, so I generally do whatever it takes to \n&gt; make code testable. Not everyone values testing as much\n&gt; I do, especially compared to other considerations, so \n&gt; they do other things.\n&gt; -- \n&gt; J. B. (Joe) Rainsberger\n\nI value testing also. But I guess I&#39;m in the latter group that finds\nother considerations to be of greater importance. I&#39;m not happy with\nstating it that way. I think there is a fundamental interconnectedness\n(in more than a Dirk Gently sort of way) between design and a lack of\ntestability. It seems good designs should be inherently testable. If\none&#39;s design attitude is test-first then the two are holistic. Even\nsymbiotic.\n\nWhat I&#39;m talking about here is green-field development. Legacy code,\nas always, trumps best intentions. Sometimes small changes can be made\nthat both improve the design and testability. Sometimes changes one\nwouldn&#39;t ordinarily accept must be tolerated for the short term to\nimprove testability to the point that more sweeping design changes can\nbe made with confidence. But if this is consistently happening in new\ndevelopment then I suggest stepping back and reconsidering essential\nOO design principles.\n\nRegards,\nJim Cakalic\n\n\n\n\n\n",
