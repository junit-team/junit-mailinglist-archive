Or if they did but\n&gt; charged less for them than they are charging for the 2.6 -&gt; 3.0 upgrade.\n &gt; ..\n&gt; .. (Though I wasn&#39;t complaining about the price; it&#39;s worth it to my company.)\n\nErik,\n\nwrong again, I&#39;m afraid : even with the support contract, major upgrades \nare not free (40%/60% of full, no contract price).\n\nNotes :\n   - at their current pace, they produce about 1 major release/year.\n   - last year, for Easter, and Christmas, it was possible to buy\n     personal licenses for 200$. There is much hope they will keep\n     this good habit.\n     If they do so, it&#39;s just about $200/year to own the very best of\n     java editor/IDE.\n     Or $0, if you don&#39;t need/wish to upgrade.\n\n   - I&#39;m not an IDEA reference, just a happy customer.\n\n\nPeople wondering about this version 3.0 stuff can see what it&#39;s all \nabout here :\n    http://www.intellij.com/idea/new30.jsp\n\n\nAlain\n\n\n\n",
