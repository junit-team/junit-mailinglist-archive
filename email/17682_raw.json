API \n&gt;&gt;designers rarely think about testability of client code.  I see the \n&gt;&gt;effect nearly every week at client sites.\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;What sort of problems do you see? I admit I don;t think much about the \n&gt;testability of client code either, but I&#39;m not sure how that practically \n&gt;impacts anything. Can you elaborate on these problems you&#39;ve seen?\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\nSure, I once worked on a system for instrument automation.  The library \nsupplied by the vendor presented an API that contained only non-virtual \nfunctions.  The code that used the library could not be tested because \nthere was no way to make sure that it was making the right calls. \n\nWe ended up wrapping the entire API so that we could mock it.  If the \nvendor had made the functions virtual, or at least supplied mocking \npoints, we would have been saved a lot of trouble.  But, the thing is,  \nAPI vendors just don&#39;t think about these things.  I used a DOM parsing \nlibrary a few months ago which, by all appearances, didn&#39;t let you \ncreate a document in memory.  You had to either point it to a URL or the \ndisk.  So, to write tests that could otherwise easily be written in \nmemory, you needed either a server or a scattering of files on disk.\n\nAPI designers just don&#39;t seem to think about testing.\n\nMichael Feathers\nwww.objectmentor.com\n\n\n\n",
