I also understand the JUnit guys&#39; reluctance to implemen=\r\nt it. My intermediate-ish experience with TestNG leaves me with the conclus=\r\nion that inter-test dependencies lead to madness. To be fair, I had already=\r\n concluded that before working with clients who insisted on specifying inte=\r\nr-test dependencies.\n&gt;\n\nI agree, which is why Assumes is a &quot;should&quot; and not=\r\n a &quot;must&quot;\n\n&gt; My first half-baked thought is to use a Rule to prevent runnin=\r\ng methods that depend on another method that has already failed. But that w=\r\nould work only if the tests were run in the appropriate order.\n&gt;\n&gt; So my ne=\r\nxt half-baked thought is to write a custom Runner that builds the dependenc=\r\ny graph and sequences the tests accordingly. Then either the runner or a ru=\r\nle could decide whether to run a test. I&#39;m confident that a runner could do=\r\n what you want, but that requires delving into the arcane bits of JUnit.\n&gt;\n=\r\n\nAlready implemented: https://github.com/junit-team/junit.contrib/pull/5\n\nS=\r\nome notes about the above, the sorting is not perfect, perfect\nsorting woul=\r\nd require a full bubble sort (i.e. resort until no changes\nare made) the so=\r\nrting just makes a &quot;best effort&quot; to get tests that\nAssume after the tests t=\r\nhe assume. If you assume a test that makes\nother assumptions, there are cas=\r\nes where the assuming test might run\nfirst... I see nothing wrong with that=\r\n other than I currently don&#39;t\nsee a mechanism to catch the failure and mark=\r\n it as less critical if\nthe later run assumed test also fails.\n\n&gt; A final h=\r\nalf-baked thought: What if you ran all the tests, then used the dependency =\r\ngraph only to mark the results somehow, so as to highlight the tests on whi=\r\nch others depend. If you see a swarm of failures, and the display indicates=\r\n that some common prerequisite test also failed, that would aid your invest=\r\nigation.\n&gt;\n\nI see merit in that too, like I said, Assumes is a weaker contr=\r\nact than Depends\n\n&gt; I&#39;ve seen situations where some prerequisite test fails=\r\n, but some of the dependent tests pass. Sometimes the prerequisite test is =\r\nlying to me (and I need to fix that). Sometimes the dependency is over-spec=\r\nified--the dependent test doesn&#39;t depend on everything that the prerequisit=\r\ne test tests (which means I need to refactor the prerequisite test and the =\r\ndependency specifications). Sometimes it means that the prerequisite test f=\r\nails intermittently (which means I need to track down the uncontrolled fact=\r\nors that affect the test).\n&gt;\n&gt; Skipping the dependent tests hides that info=\r\nrmation. Running them and marking them would highlight that\n&gt;\n&gt; Dale\n&gt;\n&gt; --=\r\n\n&gt; Dale Emery\n&gt; Consultant to software teams and leaders\n&gt; http://dhemery.c=\r\nom\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --=\r\n----------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
