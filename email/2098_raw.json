So, this example just goes to show that multiple\n    &gt; reporting might be helpful in some circumstances. \n    &gt; Obviously not all,\n    &gt; and quite possibly not useful enough for the sizeable and \n    &gt; challenging\n    &gt; framework change required to support it.\n \nHow would this complete list help you any more than the simple fact that the\narrays were not of the same length?  Given that I expected them to contain\nthe same number of elements, the most valuable information to me would be\nthat they were of different lengths, not which elements were/were not\npresent.\n\nAs far as what someone else said about working in batch mode, I submit that\ntrying to fix more than one problem at a time (no matter how good you are)\nresults in more headaches than trying to fix one at a time.  Some may\ndisagree...  Even though JUnit users are not all XPers, it is still a good\npractice to do the simplest thing that could possibly work, and build from\nthere -- especially when trying to fix tests!\n\nRespectfully,\n-Jason\n\n\n",
