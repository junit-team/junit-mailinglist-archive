The test thread then waits<br/>\n&gt; for the receiving thread to notify it when the packets are received.<br/>\n&gt; The test thread then gets the packets from the receiving thread.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So I want to only start the receiving thread once per testcase and not<br/>\n&gt; once per test. Otherwise  I have multiple receiving threads trying to<br/>\n&gt; bind to the same socket. I also have difficulty stopping the receiving<br/>\n&gt; thread in tearDown because it is i/o blocked and even if I interrupt<br/>\n&gt; it, it does not terminate before the next test starts.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I would try to have a new server per test.
