The framework with respect to suites/test cases is exactly \n=\r\nsimilar to JUNIT except for that I need to figure out a way to use \nasserti=\r\nons outside the testXXX() methods also.\n\nexample in a suite, a test case is=\r\n like this\n\npublic void testLogin{\n\nmethod1();\nmethod2();\nmethod3();\n// if =\r\nassert is used here in this test case it will work fine\n}\n\n\nThe above metho=\r\nds have lot of other calls to otehr methods and I \nhave to use assertions i=\r\nn those methods also. Right now we are jsut \nhandling exceptions in our way=\r\n and throwing them so that our \nframework captures. Out framework with resp=\r\nect to test suites/cases \nis almost similar to JUNIT. If i can get a way ho=\r\nw the assertions \ncan be used in these other method calls which are being m=\r\nade from \nthe testXXX() methods i will be successful in migrating to JUNIT.=\r\n \nThese methods calls traverse through lot of toehr methods which \ninvolve =\r\ncalling database interactions/math calucations based on our \napplciaiton wh=\r\nere the test case can fail.\n\nPlease suggest if there is any alternative/sol=\r\nution. Thanks in \nadvance.\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, Chris Dollin &lt;chr=\r\nis.dollin@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; On Friday 22 June 2007 02:35, sireesha wrote:\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; how can we use assertions outside a junit testcase and still \nmake the =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; test case handle it.\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t understand what you&#39;re trying to do.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; A [junit] assertion, when it fails, throws a suitable exception. \nThe=\r\n\n&gt; test case framework catches the exception and records it.
