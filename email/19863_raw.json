I understand \nyou are\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;  currently doing this as an exer=\r\ncise, so it&#39;s healthy to take \nit to\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;  extremes and do everything by =\r\nthe book in order to learn, \nbut in your\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;  real work, use your judgme=\r\nnt and decide for yourself when \nyou are\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;  indeed writing too much co=\r\nde, in which case it&#39;s probably \nsafer to go\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;  the usual route (get y=\r\nour code to work, then write tests for \nit).\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;  The downside of=\r\n TDD is that you can end up writing a lot of \ntests for\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;  business co=\r\nde that you quickly throw away and rewrite, so \nthe amount\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;  of churn=\r\n can be quite high.\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  I disagree. When I&#39;ve found something d=\r\nifficult to write test \nfirst\n&gt; &gt;  I&#39;ve always done a spike, then delete th=\r\ne code and rewrote it \ntest\n&gt; &gt;  first. I&#39;ve always found the result to be =\r\na lot more cleaner,\n&gt; &gt;  especially since I wind up cleaning up the code an=\r\nyway when I \nused to\n&gt; &gt;  write tests around them.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  I&#39;d rather have=\r\n my business code tested rather than not test it \nunder\n&gt; &gt;  the assumption=\r\n it will one day be thrown away. ;)\n&gt; \n&gt; Well, I never suggested not writin=\r\ng tests, I was just saying that\n&gt; sometimes, it&#39;s okay to write your tests =\r\nonce you&#39;re done with the\n&gt; business code.\n&gt; \n&gt; Here is a scenario I&#39;ve see=\r\nn happen fairly often:\n&gt; \n&gt; Write test1\n&gt; Write code1\n&gt; Write test2\n&gt; Write=\r\n code2\n&gt; \n&gt; Then a refactoring comes to mind and you realize you don&#39;t need=\r\n \ncode1\n&gt; and code2 any more, so you write code3, and suddenly, you find\n&gt; =\r\nyourself having to refactor (or throw away) both test1 and test2.\n&gt; \n&gt; I wa=\r\ns simply suggesting that sometimes, the following flow works \nbetter:\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nWrite code1\n&gt; Write code2\n&gt; &lt;realize a refactoring is possible&gt;\n&gt; Refactor =\r\ncode1/code2 into code3\n&gt; &lt;happy with the result, now we write the test&gt;\n&gt; W=\r\nrite test3\n&gt; \n&gt; Net result:  two less tests to write.\n\nSometimes that seque=\r\nnce ends there and sometimes it becomes:\n\nWrite code1\nWrite code2\n&lt;realize =\r\na refactoring is possible&gt;\nRefactor code1/code2 into code3\n&lt;happy with the =\r\nresult, now we write the test&gt;\nWrite test3\nShit.  Test3 doesn&#39;t pass\n&lt;unhap=\r\npy with result&gt;\n\nEverybody has to find their balance.  For me, it&#39;s just fa=\r\nster and \nless frustating to have tests when I refactor.  \n\nMichael Feather=\r\ns\nwww.objectmentor.com\n\n\n\n\n\n",
