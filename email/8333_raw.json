My current \nthinking is that maybe some kind of ant task that spawned a new JVM \nwould help.  Thinking some more, I guess the test class would need to be \naccessing the Prevayler system via a socket (like an RDBMS) and tell it \nto shut down and then restart inbetween requesting the persistence of an \nobject, and checking the object has been persisted.\n\nOf course this sort of defeats the purpose of the prevayler which is to \nhave all your persistence in the same JVM as your processes - I guess \nyou could delete everything and call the prevayler initialize methods, \nbut this suffers from the problem that the test is not actually testing \nthe thing we want, i.e. a shutdown and restart of the JVM, because if \nthe persistence doesn&#39;t survive this event, then it&#39;s of no use.\n\nI guess one could have a separately stored list of persisted objects, \nsay in a text file, that the junit test would record its persistence \nattempts to, and this could be used on startup to confirm what should be \nin the prevayler persistent store.  hmmm.\n\nAny thoughts or comments greatly appreciated.\n\nCHEERS&gt; SAM\n\n\n\n",
