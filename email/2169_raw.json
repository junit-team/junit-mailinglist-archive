In response to \nmessages from other classes, ClassA must modify the state of this \ntree that it has constructed. \n\nSo I have a TestClassA TestCase which has a method testDoSomething() \nwhich calls the &quot;state changing&quot; method on ClassA. Now, how do I \nassert whether the states have changed correctly? The TestClassA does \nnot have access to the internal tree of ClassA.\n\nI have already written separate TestCases for the objects (nodes) \nmaking up the tree and those individual tests seem to be working \nfine. Does this mean that I do not need to test this from the \ncontainer class? Or is there some other way to do this?\n\nAny help appreciated.\nThanks,\n--Das\n\n\n",
