It&#39;s just a shame that \nthe compiler, which used to help here (with TestSetup) doesn&#39;t with the \ncorresponding annotation.\n\n&gt; I think you should just use @Before and not @BeforeClass. Don&#39;t do\n&gt;  &gt; class-level setup as a performance hack; it creates more problems than\n&gt;  &gt; it solves.\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t believe it&#39;s a hack: it&#39;s scoped initialization of resources. We use\n&gt; this in Java all the time (static fields, fields, local variables).\n\nI judged by the test code that the OP was using it as a way to avoid \ninitializing the same data for all the tests in the test case class. I \nguessed that it was a performance hack, since I&#39;ve seen 1000 people want \nto do the same thing. I suppose we should let the OP tell me whether it \nreally was or wasn&#39;t a hack.\n\n&gt; You need a resource at the class level, you initialize it in a BeforeClass\n&gt; method. You need a resource at the method level, you initialize it in a\n&gt; Before method.\n\nRight... so don&#39;t initialize an instance-level resource with \n@BeforeClass. Either use @Before or make the resource class-level. I&#39;m \npretty sure that&#39;s what I said, along with &quot;And by the way, why do you \nwant a class-level resource here? I&#39;m worried you might be trying to \noptimize unnecessarily and possibly counterproductively.&quot;\n\n&gt; Doesn&#39;t get any simpler or more intuitive than that...\n\nI agree; so what&#39;s your point again?\n-- \nJ.
