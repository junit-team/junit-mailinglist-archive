Apologies in advance if not.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am developing a Java application which needs to automate user GUI<br/>\n&gt; interaction with an existing<br/>\n&gt; Java-based GUI app.  THe app runs continuously and its GUI appearance<br/>\n&gt; is not predictable (different GUIs<br/>\n&gt; may appear during different runs of the app).  That said, the GUIs<br/>\n&gt; are fairly simple with most having an<br/>\n&gt; &quot;OK&quot; or &quot;Cancel&quot; button.  My quesiton is:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 1)WOuld using Java GUI Testing tools be a viable option for this<br/>\n&gt; task?  I don&#39;t know enough about them<br/>\n&gt; to judge right off.  My final applicaiton would need to run as a<br/>\n&gt; standalone app but also with the capability of an external user<br/>\n&gt; to start and stop the app.  I looked into using the Java Robot class<br/>\n&gt; but it seems like it would lock the mouse/keyboard in the case<br/>\n&gt; of an app like mine which will run continuously.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Why are you testing the instance of your application running in <br/>\nproduction? Maybe I just don&#39;t understand why &quot;running continuously&quot; <br/>\nmatters.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 2)If the answer to the quesiton above is yes..which Java GUI tool<br/>\n&gt; would be most suitable for this task?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I like Jemmy, myself.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ.
