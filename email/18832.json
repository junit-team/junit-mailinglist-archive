This is in RAD 6.x, which uses<br/>\nJUnit 3.8. As far as I can tell, I cannot upgrade to JUnit 4.x becuz<br/>\nRAD 6.x cannot go beyond Java 1.4.2. Because I am learning, I am not<br/>\nsure if my problem is with the IDE or with JUnit code - here&#39;s the<br/>\ndescription:<br/>\n<br/>\nThe original programmer had a System.getProperty(&quot;TestPath&quot;) in his<br/>\nTestAll class which extends TestCase and collects all the tests in the<br/>\nTestPath directory into a TestSuite and runs them etc...<br/>\n<br/>\nThis runs but does not find the test classes, probably becuz<br/>\ngetTestPath() returns null : )<br/>\nI cannot find where TestPath is set, created, or otherwise acquired.<br/>\nWhen I hardcode it, the testcases are still not found. Is there a<br/>\nstandard for where to put and maintain the property &quot;TestPath&quot; in<br/>\norder to run JUnit from RAD? <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nLibby</div>",
