The project we are<br/>\nworking on involves taking initial code from an<br/>\nexternal vendor,  writing tests for it and then adding<br/>\nnew functions onto it.   We initially investigated<br/>\nRaccoon and Tibco but found that it was a little<br/>\nbuggy.   We are very keen to continue on the path of<br/>\nJunit, Tibco etc.  At the moment we have a rather<br/>\ncrude automated testing framework that compares log<br/>\nfiles using other technologies such as ant, text file<br/>\ncomparison utility to test IM workflows.  We are<br/>\ncurrently looking at how to test adapters and make<br/>\nsure they are successful.  Are you contributing the<br/>\nRacoon code back to the site or not.  Let me know and<br/>\nI can send you some more information.  Where are you<br/>\nbased?  <br/>\n<br/>\nRegards<br/>\n<br/>\nJonathan Howard<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- darkblueavenger &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:darkblueavenger@...\">darkblueavenger@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Hi Howard,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We&#39;re using jUnit, Raccoon and TIBCO Active<br/>\n&gt; Enterprise currently in <br/>\n&gt; our projet.<br/>\n&gt; We&#39;re busy extending the jUnit extensions found in<br/>\n&gt; Raccoon so as to <br/>\n&gt; test the full TIB/IM workflows in an automated<br/>\n&gt; fashion<br/>\n&gt; Currently we&#39;re delving on having xml config files<br/>\n&gt; to have Raccoon <br/>\n&gt; send and record intermediate steps.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What are you doing ?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;In junit@y..., &quot;jlhoward_nz&quot; &lt;jlhoward_nz@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Has anybody being using JUNIT to test EAI projects like Tibco or<br/>\n&gt; Vitria or MQ series.
