I don&#39;t usually associate &quot;clever&quot; with &quot;keep is<br/>\nsimple stupid&quot; but maybe that&#39;s just me.  I think a beautiful JUnit test<br/>\nwould be one that uses both inheritance and the &quot;parameterized test<br/>\ncase&quot; pattern to be as short and sweet (and therefore maintainable) as<br/>\npossible.  But that just this beholder&#39;s eye.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTodd.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>] On <br/>\n&gt; Behalf Of albsavoia<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Monday, November 27, 2006 10:48 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: [junit] Strange request: examples of &quot;beautiful&quot; test code<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have been invited to contribute an article for a book that <br/>\n&gt; covers examples of beautiful code (those of you who have been <br/>\n&gt; programming for quite a while might remember the great book <br/>\n&gt; &quot;Programming Pearls&quot; - this is along the same lines.)  The <br/>\n&gt; &quot;catch&quot; is that I have to contribute testing-related examples <br/>\n&gt; - in other words: beautiful test code.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I already have some ideas of what to cover, but I thought <br/>\n&gt; some of the people in this group might have some examples of <br/>\n&gt; tests that they consider particularly &quot;beautiful&quot; or clever <br/>\n&gt; in their approach.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I think it&#39;s great that developer testing has reached the <br/>\n&gt; point that some authors/editors thought of including testing <br/>\n&gt; in such a book, and I want to make sure I pick the best <br/>\n&gt; possible example(s) to pick from.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Alberto<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
