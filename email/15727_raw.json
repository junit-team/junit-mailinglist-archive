So from=\r\n \ntime to time, in this area something may go wrong. Therefore I&#39;m \nlooking=\r\n for a tool, that generates a report showing only the \ndifferences between =\r\ncurrent and last JUnit report - which failing \ntests were fixed, which test=\r\ns stopped to pass, which tests were added \nand which removed. Additionaly a=\r\n test trend analysis should be \npossible.\n\nI know, parsing the XML junitrep=\r\nort output and generating the info, \ne.g., with the help of a database, wou=\r\nld be possible. But is anyone \naware of an existing tool or open source pro=\r\nject that can help in this \ndirection?\n\n--Klaus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
