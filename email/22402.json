    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-667866399\">My basic understanding of the _practical_ difference between them is that parameterized tests have more restrictions on how the data is set up.  For example, parameterized tests have an array of arrays, each internal array is a set of parameters to apply to the test.  Essentially, there is more onus on the test writer to know what parameters are important to test, and how they are supposed to relate.<br/>\n<br/>\nTheories have much less restrictions on the data, and instead force the test writer to focus on the function of the theory independent of the data.  That&#39;s a good thing IMO.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy guess is that parameterized tests came first, and because of the limitations it forced on the test writer theories came later.  That is only a guess.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn some ways I would like to pair the expected result with the passed in parameter, but that solution requires a parameterized test.  In most applications, I care more about the behavior of a class implementing an interface, or something of that nature.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I&#39;m missing here is what is the _philosophical_ difference?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, CÃ©dric Beust â&quot; &lt;cbeust@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If my understanding is correct, there is definitely an overlap between<br/>\n&gt; parameterized tests and theories.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Theories generate a set of tuples representing the combination of a data<br/>\n&gt; set, while parameterized can return... well, any data set.

The parameterized tests are a bit more of a pain to set up;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; but they provide a little more control over how things get matched up.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Of course, theories allow for much more robust data sets by combining<br/>\n&gt; &gt; all the data points in every way. This can provide an order of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; magnitude more tests automatically, but care has to be taken. For<br/>\n&gt; &gt; example, the number of actual tests run is D^P where D is the number of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; data points and P is the number of parameters on any given theory. This<br/>\n&gt; &gt; can generate a lot of tests quickly, and the &quot;runDiscretely&quot; option I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; hacked together for theories would definitely not be a preferable.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I now know that assumptions are filtering devices for theories, so it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; does not mark the test as failed. Essentially, the reason that an<br/>\n&gt; &gt; assumption is marked as passing for the theory is that the assumption<br/>\n&gt; &gt; successfully filtered out that data combination. I get that now, but I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; probably will use that feature very sparingly.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The question I have is what problem was the reason parameterized tests<br/>\n&gt; &gt; supposed to solve, and how is that different than the problem that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; theories are supposed to solve?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  <br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -- <br/>\n&gt; ***Cédric<br/>\n&gt; *<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
