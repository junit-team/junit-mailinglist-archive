In most cases yes B&#39;s method is trivial so I could\nstart from the other end and drive my code from the root class&#39;s test.\nHowever being a newbie(ish) at junit I don&#39;t currently like the idea of\nstarting from that end as I still have a tendency to &quot;wander off&quot; sometimes\nwithin my coding (you know how it is...) and by driving from the wrong\ndirection gives me the freedom to screw up. I guess this is just a\ndiscipline thing.  BTW I like the idea of mocking in this context - I hadn&#39;t\n(yet) thought of that.\n\nJonathan\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: J. B. Rainsberger [mailto:jbrains@...]\nSent: 25 April 2003 18:22\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: Re: [junit] Test and test case dependencies\n\n\nWhen B calls C, is B&#39;s method trivial? See the JUnit FAQ for details on what\nI mean by that. If B&#39;s method is trivial, then testing B only tests C and\nnothing else, so I wouldn&#39;t bother writing the test. If B&#39;s method takes\nparameters and passes them to C, then B&#39;s method still cannot break: only\nthe methods that call B&#39;s method and C could break, so test those.\n\nI would use the same approach for the relationship between A and B.\n\nIf B&#39;s method is not trivial, then as soon as you feel the pain of\nduplicated tests mock the behavior in C that B calls and use that mock\nbehavior in the test. This allows you to test B in isolation from any\ndefects in C.\n\nI hope this helps.\n\n&gt;So said Jonathan Oddy on 4/25/2003 --------------------\n&gt;I understand that in general we want to write tests and test cases that are\n&gt;not dependent upon each other so that an earlier failing(?) test doesn&#39;t\n&gt;set\n&gt;state of the underlying object(s) to prejudice later tests.  Okay fine, but\n&gt;I was wondering how people solve/resolve the following type of dependency.\n&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;If I have three classes A, B and C where A delegates some functionality to\n&gt;B\n&gt;which delegates to C.  During my implementation and unit testing I write\n&gt;tests for C then implement the desired functionality in C.  I then repeat\n&gt;the process for B and A, okay fine.  But now I have an implied unit test\n&gt;dependency don&#39;t I?  So when running my tests as a suite I really want my\n&gt;test cases to run in the order C, B, A and never any other order because if\n&gt;the defect is in C then I want to know about it from C and not from A or B.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;I am currently implementing a small library that does a lot of this style\n&gt;of\n&gt;delegation, and being reasonably new to JUnit I wondered how other people\n&gt;work round this issue especially since those nice Eclipse people provide a\n&gt;helpful &quot;run all tests in a package option&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt;Thanks inadnavce\n&gt;\n&gt;Jonathan\n&gt;\n&gt;Yahoo!
