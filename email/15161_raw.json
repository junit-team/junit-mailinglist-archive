Is there a good way to test SWT?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yes, Eclipse is automatically tested this way. A couple of Eclipse books\n&gt; cover this and you can find more information on http://eclipse.org (I\n&gt; realize you asked for SWT testing, but testing Eclipse is even more \n&gt; complex,\n&gt; so testing SWT should be easier).\n\nYes, and no. Eclipse has great support for running integration tests \nthat drive the UI on top of the OSGi plug-in model. These tests are too \nslow to effectively participate in minute-to-minute TDD, in my \nexperience. (Contrary to the practice espoused in Contributing to \nEclipse, otherwise a really great book.) Unfortunately, SWT is built in \na way that prevents you from creating any user-interface element without \nat least opening a window to display it in.\n\n&gt; Google so far says &#39;not really&#39;. I&#39;ve made some painful conclusions and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; design decisions from this. Chief among them has been, &quot;if you need to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; test the UI, you&#39;ve probably got model code in your view classes. Fix\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that first.&quot;\n\nThat&#39;s the same place I&#39;m living. I trust my integration tests to catch \nglaring UI problems, and user testing beyond that.\n\nGood luck,\n\nDavid Saff\n\n",
