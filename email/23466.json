Each test is also described via describeChild.<br/>\n<br/>\nDuring runChild execution, if I create child descriptions of each child as each unforeseeable test occurs, then I get &quot;unrooted&quot; output.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy actual use-case is that I have a test runner executing a series of tests within an html file. I would have to parse the html and its associated JavaScript to determine how many tests will be run. This would be tricky.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs there a recommended means of reporting the results of tests that are not determinable in advance?<br/>\n<br/>\nKind regards,<br/>\nChristopher</div>",
