B. Rainsberger [mailto:jbr@...]\n&gt; &gt; Just do assertEquals on expected and actual collections. The\n&gt; &gt; collections all have sensible equals methods\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; i.e. if the 2 collections are lists they will be equal if they\n&gt; &gt; contain the same elements in the same order. If the 2 collections\n&gt; &gt; are sets they will be equal if they contain the same elements.\n&gt; \n&gt; The only problem with this otherwise great advice is that \n&gt; comparing two lists \n&gt; for the same elements, although not at the same indices, does \n&gt; not work.\n&gt; \n&gt; This has been discussed, I think, to death somewhere on the \n&gt; web. Maybe you \n&gt; should look at http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?JavaUnitBestPractices \n&gt; and hunt around \n&gt; for something on comparing arrays or some such. There should \n&gt; be quite a \n&gt; complete discussion.\n&gt; \n&gt; The basic idea is this: write your own custom assertion \n&gt; or &quot;collectionsEquals&quot;, but be careful how to handle the differences. \n&gt; Especially for big collections, you need an easy way to know what the \n&gt; differences are between the collections in the case where \n&gt; they are not equal.\n&gt; \n&gt; If that resource does not help you, then let us know and \n&gt; we&#39;ll fill in the \n&gt; blanks. This sounds like another &quot;Tip and Trick&quot; for my site. :)\n&gt; \n\n",
