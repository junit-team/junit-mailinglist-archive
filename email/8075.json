This class needs to be serialized to a file and then reloaded at<br/>\n&gt;some point.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;m using this as an opportunity to learn more about JUnit (since its<br/>\n&gt;fairly<br/>\n&gt;simple). My question is this<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Given that I have two methods of my class I need to test, SaveLicense and<br/>\n&gt;LoadLicense, should I write this as two separate tests or as a single test<br/>\n&gt;that incorporates both? To clarify, to load a license, I would need to have<br/>\n&gt;a saved license. The load license would then verify that the information<br/>\n&gt;that was saved was loaded correctly.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Short answer: two tests.<br/>\n<br/>\nLonger answer: pretend neither were implemented. Try writing the test first. With which test do you start?<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the way, you absolutely do not need a saved licence to test loading a licence -- at least not the way you think. (How?)<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJ. B.
