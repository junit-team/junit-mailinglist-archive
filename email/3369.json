On the topic at hand, I know that Vladimir Bossicard has<br/>\n&gt; implemented a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; scheme that will let you register services with the junit<br/>\n&gt; architecture for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; letting you extend it easily for custom reporting and what-not.<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t know<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the current status of that effort though so perhaps he can comment?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; He can comment, he can :-)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My project (www.bossicard.com/projects/junit.php) is the result of all<br/>\n&gt; the experiments I made on JUnit over the last nine months.  I choose<br/>\n&gt; this way not to replace JUnit but to see how users&#39; requests could be<br/>\n&gt; implemented in JUnit (the official version).  I agree I coded a little<br/>\n&gt; bit too much and my version does not look like JUnit anymore :-)<br/>\n&gt; Because this project is a prototype and not a replacement to the<br/>\n&gt; official version, I am not putting too much effort in it anymore and<br/>\n&gt; wait to see the direction Erich and Kent take with their framework.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am also working on another project with the idea to have more<br/>\n&gt; flexibility while running your tests (defining services accessible by<br/>\n&gt; all tests (single db connection, CORBA service, logging mechanism...),<br/>\n&gt; replacing the different property and allTests.java files with XML files,<br/>\n&gt; writing the output in an XML file and then converting it into HTML, text<br/>\n&gt; file..., providing metrics for every test (and not only the failed<br/>\n&gt; one),... ).  For those interested: www.bossicard.com/apricot, I&#39;ll<br/>\n&gt; release some code in the new few days.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -Vladimir<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; Vladimir Bossicard<br/>\n&gt; www.bossicard.com<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
