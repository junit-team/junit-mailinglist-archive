Have you<br/>\n&gt; considered using evil reflection tricks to change the private state of<br/>\n&gt; the class under test after load time?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, the class was designed before JUnit existed, so testability wasn&#39;t<br/>\nas well understood back then.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd most of our testing to date has been done using the JavaTest harness,<br/>\nwhich runs *every* test in its own JVM.  Yes, overkill in the other<br/>\ndirection.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, I&#39;ve considered reflection, but I think it&#39;s better to control the<br/>\nenvironment in which the test executes.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess the take-away from this discussion is that JUnit doesn&#39;t have<br/>\nanything to help me and I&#39;m pretty much on my own.  :-(<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, that&#39;s to everyone for the suggestions.</div>",
