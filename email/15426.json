Honestly, <br/>\nhe sent 3 emails to the list and looked into the JUnit&#39;s source code <br/>\nonly after first two. If he would bother to look to the source code at <br/>\nfirst place he won&#39;t have to sent any emails here. You know, I&#39;ve been <br/>\nusing this feature for quite long time (not to mention that is is also <br/>\noutlined in JUnit cookbook, which free chapter is available for <br/>\ndownload) and wery well aware that others have some kind of mental block <br/>\non this, which could be pretty much result of some design flow in JUnit. <br/>\nBut this thing just work and as you know it won&#39;t be an issue in JUnit4.<br/>\n<br/>\n  You know, given the support of junit in existing tools I just take its <br/>\nglitches and issues originated by the requirements for backward <br/>\ncompatibility as given and hope that they will be resolved in next <br/>\nversion of JUnit.<br/>\n<br/>\n  regards,<br/>\n  Eugene<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
