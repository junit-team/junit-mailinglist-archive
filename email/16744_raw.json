I think it&#39;s not \n&gt; possible to publish junit based tests of gpl software. \n&gt; Junit tests cannot be published under gpl because licenses \n&gt; are incompatible. \n&gt; Tests that use gpl code have to be published under the gpl. q.e.d.\n&gt; Has anybody experiences with this topic? Any thoughts?\n\nI&#39;ve been researching this in trying to select a license for NUnitLite. For\na serious opinion, consult an attorney, but here&#39;s what I think is true.\n\nLicenses need interpretation. What counts first is the interpretation and\nintent of the person who holds the copyright to the GPLed project. If they\ndon&#39;t think you&#39;re in violation, they won&#39;t sue you and nobody else has\nstanding. So one thing to do is to ask the copyright holders if they believe\npublishing your tests requires licensing the tests. If they say there&#39;s no\nproblem, then there&#39;s no problem. If they say it is a problem, you have to\ndecide whether to take the risk based on what you think a court would do.\n\nWhat about Junit? Does publishing your tests mean you have to license them\nunder CPL? Or license them at all? I don&#39;t think so (but IANAL). According\nto that license, works that are separate modules and not &quot;derivative works&quot;\nof Junit are not required to use CPL. Do the authors of Junit think that the\nCPL license provision should apply to your tests? You can ask that question\nright here.\n\nI usually just lurk here, but I responded because I think this is a big\nissue for the testing community. If we&#39;re in favor of free/open source\nsoftware, and also in favor of publishing tests, then we need to come to\nsome understanding that publishing the tests of your application does not\nput you under any reciprocal obligations to the authors of the test\nframework you are using.\n\nIt seems to me that writing tests is part of the &quot;use&quot; of a test framework\nand doesn&#39;t amount to the same thing as extending it, say by publishing a\nSuperJUnit framework that included the original. If I, as a framework\nauthor, were to sue you for writing and publishing tests that use my\nframework, I&#39;d look pretty silly.\n\nThat said, people need assurances. I think NUnitLite will have a notice that\nexplains our intention to not inforce any licensing requirements against\npublished tests, so long as they are only tests of a particular application\nand not a general-purpose program. Maybe it would be useful if we all did\nsomething like that.\n\nCharlie\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
