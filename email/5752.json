As a developer, I usually have much control over the<br/>\nway my code is used. It is only the published interface I don&#39;t have<br/>\n&quot;full control&quot; over - I would agree that for that (hopefully rather<br/>\nsmall interface) your definition of robustness applies.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Actually, I&#39;m sure that contingency is addressed by the<br/>\n&gt; automotive industry. Now bringing fire near any body of<br/>\n&gt; petrol is bad, but there are ways to reduce the likelihood of<br/>\n&gt; a bad thing. Baffles in the tube leading to the petrol tank<br/>\n&gt; are an example of trying to provide hardware guard conditions.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Afaik they don&#39;t guard against putting nitroglycerin into the petrol<br/>\ntank... ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The project that I am winding up<br/>\n&gt; now is not life threatening, but because of volume, it does<br/>\n&gt; need to be very fast and very accurate or the CEO will be<br/>\n&gt; asking why it is failing to process about 2000 shipments an<br/>\n&gt; hour! (Not a conversation that I ever want to have!) I still<br/>\n&gt; think that it&#39;s appropriate to &quot;harden&quot; our code to handle<br/>\n&gt; the unexpected.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Aren&#39;t the goals of fast code, robust code (against misuse) and fast<br/>\ndevelopment rather competing?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; This is the concept of &quot;graceful degredation&quot;. A web browser<br/>\n&gt; is a very good example of this .... a lot of web pages have<br/>\n&gt; awful HTML and yet most of them display acceptably, because<br/>\n&gt; the browser takes what it&#39;s given and does the best it can<br/>\n&gt; with it. A browser cannot throw an exception, but it can try<br/>\n&gt; to render what it&#39;s given. All software should do the best it<br/>\n&gt; can with what it&#39;s given or when possible reject unacceptable inputs.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, it probably is a good idea to make the external interface rather<br/>\nrobust. But I think that the balance changes for internal communication<br/>\nof the system.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards, Ilja</div>",
