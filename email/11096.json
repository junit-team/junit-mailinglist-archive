One of the concerns that I (and<br/>\n&gt;&gt;developers) have is that we will end up with thousands of test cases, many<br/>\n&gt;&gt;of which will involve using substantial amounts of MockObjects to set up<br/>\n&gt;&gt;test cases and that all this will become too much of an overhead to manage  <br/>\n&gt;&gt;maintain. Specifically,  that changing code in the future will involve<br/>\n&gt;&gt;analysis of not only the project code but also the junit test code - an<br/>\n&gt;&gt;overhead we don&#39;t have today of course.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, don&#39;t look at the tests as overhead.  Look at them as short-cuts<br/>\nthat help you understand.  For instance, often it is great to know<br/>\nthat:<br/>\n<br/>\nassertEquals(0, floogle.flumox(12))<br/>\nand assertEquals(1, floogle.flumox(13))<br/>\n<br/>\nwithout calculating it out by hand.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other reason why they help is because they act as a &quot;software<br/>\nvise.&quot;  They hold down the behavior of your system and let you know<br/>\nwhen you are changing more behavior than you expected to.  That alone<br/>\nis invaluable in development.<br/>\n<br/>\nTests make maintenance easier because they hack away at uncertainty.<br/>\n<br/>\nMichael Feathers<br/>\nwww.objectmentor.com</div>",
