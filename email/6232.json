As such, I&#39;m presented with a fairly unique opportunity to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;establish some standard practices for unit testing.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;A few things are obvious. Yes, writing unit tests for all new code<br/>\n&gt; &gt;should be STRONGLY ENCOURAGED. Yes, the JUnit framework is what we<br/>\n&gt; &gt;will use for launching our tests. <br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Some are less obvious, but I&#39;m still clear on what to do. For <br/>\ninstance,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;writing tests that include the database are often QUITE difficult. <br/>\nNot<br/>\n&gt; &gt;everyone has a copy of Oracle; we can&#39;t just erase tables willy-<br/>\nnilly<br/>\n&gt; &gt;to set up for each test; etc. So I will use mock objects (hopefully<br/>\n&gt; &gt;starting from those at www.mockobjects.com) to simulate the <br/>\nconnection,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;and other &quot;external&quot; data sources/sinks.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;And there are a few questions on which I&#39;d like to hear input from<br/>\n&gt; &gt;some with more experience so I can start out using &quot;Best Practices&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;instead of having to learn from my OWN experience.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;QUESTION 1:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   Where do my JUnit unit tests go?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   <br/>\n&gt; &gt;   I see 3 likely answers... (a) make each an inner class of the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   class being tested, (b) for every class &quot;Foo&quot; have a class <br/>\ncalled <br/>\n&gt; &gt;   &quot;TestFoo&quot; in the same package, or (c) have a separate (but <br/>\nparallel<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   hierarchy of classes... SOURCE/com/pkg/Foo.java is tested by <br/>\n&gt; &gt;   TEST/com/pkg/TestFoo.java.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   I lean towards (c) because it makes it easy to build the &quot;real&quot; <br/>\ncode<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   and the &quot;test&quot; code separately, and omit the &quot;test&quot; code from<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   production deployment. Are there other significant issues here?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;QUESTION 2:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   How do I automatically build the suite of all tests?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   For each class, I can have several methods called &quot;testXxx()&quot; <br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   can collect them into a suite to run at once. I can collect the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   suites together into larger suites, eventually coalescing into a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   suite called &quot;RunAllTests&quot; which does just that. But this <br/>\nrequires<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   me to write each of these suites, and to remember to include <br/>\neach<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   and every test class. I&#39;d rather if &quot;RunAllTests&quot; just magically<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   found all of the tests... that way I couldn&#39;t forget to include<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   one and wind up with some tests that never get run just because <br/>\nI<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   forgot a line in a suite. How do I create this &quot;magical&quot; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;   RunAllTests?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   Stray thought... if there&#39;s no simple solution in straight java,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   I wonder if ant can help me to achieve RunAllTests as an ant<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   target?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;QUESTION 3:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   How do I &quot;turn on&quot; my mock objects when tests are running?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   The most straightforward use of mock objects is to pass them<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   directly to the code being tested. However, (despite the fact <br/>\nthat<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   this is a bit broader than simply &quot;unit&quot; testing), I plan to <br/>\nhave<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   a lot of tests that exercise an entire sub-system at once. For<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   example, I might create the input file, run the command, and <br/>\nthen<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   test the output file. But if this &quot;command&quot; opens a connection <br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   a database (or other system), then I&#39;d like to return a mock<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   ResultSet instead of a real one. So the code that obtains a DB<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   connection has to look at some global setting to see if we&#39;re in<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   &quot;test mode&quot; or &quot;real life&quot;. What is a good way to achieve this -<br/>\n-<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   is it something I&#39;ll have to write for myself?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll have more questions also, but this email is QUITE <br/>\nlong<br/>\n&gt; &gt;enough as is. Thanks in advance for any feedback, suggestions, or<br/>\n&gt; &gt;pointers to other forums/FAQs for this kind of stuff.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;-- Michael Chermside<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;junit-unsubscribe@y...<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Your use of Yahoo!
