Short answer is I\n&gt; think Agitator & JUnit are complementary TDD or no. (I&#39;ll leave it to\n&gt; someone else to make the point that of course you should use TDD.  I\n&gt; agree with them, but that isn&#39;t your question.)\n&gt; \n&gt; Longer answer is that when you use JUnit TDD there are (at least) two\n&gt; different kinds of value you get, design and correctness. It is the\n&gt; correctness aspect that Robert Martin is talking about when he\n&gt; compares TDD to double entry bookkeeping. It answers the question\n&gt; &quot;does my algorithm work? does input a combined with input b give me\n&gt; exactly output c?&quot; JUnit tests give you this kind of confidence.\n&gt; \n&gt; Agitator is more about limits and bounds and did your algorithm, which\n&gt; you already know works correctly on the happy path, unexpectedly blow\n&gt; up in some cases. Or leave the object in an illegal state? Or return a\n&gt; non-sensical value? or... Agitation is also good for &quot;does input of\n&gt; category A with input of category B always give me output of category\n&gt; C?&quot; If I were looking for a word to compare to correctness I&#39;d\n&gt; probably have to choose robustness.\n&gt; \n&gt; So would I recommend JUnit + Agitator over just simply Agitator?  Heck\n&gt; yeah! and I&#39;ve already done so many times on (both in person and on my\n&gt; blog) already.  :)\n\n...not to mention that JUnit costs a lot less then Agitator! (I couldn&#39;t \nresist. :) )\n\nBrian Marick talks about how customers (or Product Directors, to use his \nmost recent term for the role) are good at identifying business value \nand testers are good at identifying business loss. This means that \nwithout testers, you end up with a system that does good things, but \ncrumbles under the slightest bit of bad input or user malice. Testers \nare there to help identify situations where the current product can be \nbrought to its knees, whether intentionally or unintentionally. Testers \nstop us from shipping a product with $2M of value and a potential $20M \nsecurity hole. I see Agitator having a similar role at the technical level.\n\nTDD practitioners are good at identifying technical value (clean code \nthat does the right thing with the right input) and JUnit is a key tool \nfor that purpose. Agitator can help identify technical loss: boundary \ncases that might be of interest to the programmer and might represent \ntechnical holes other modules can exploit to hurt the system. This is \nhow I imagine using Agitator in my practice.\n\nHow does that sound?\n-- \nJ. B.
