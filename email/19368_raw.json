I am using the hibernate connection pool for the database connectivity. In Tomcat i set the jndi name and now i want to get the connection in my test cases.\n      Now I am testing the input data which I am sending. Is it correct way or else I have to do anything more.\n      Please clarify these 2 things.\n\n Thanks & Regards,\n Thanuja.\n\n\nLasse Koskela &lt;lasse.koskela@...&gt; wrote:          Hi,\n\nOn 5/17/07, p_thanuja82 &lt;p_thanuja82@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; I am new to junit test cases.We have to test all the classes and\n&gt; method.It&#39;s enough to test the db connection,the class which we are\n&gt; passing the input data.\n&gt;\n&gt; Plz clarify my doubt.\n\nLet&#39;s first clarify what you&#39;re saying above. Am I interpreting you\ncorrectly that you&#39;re _asking_ whether it&#39;s enough to test the\ndatabase connection and some class you are passing input data to?\n\nIf yes, then I&#39;ve got a couple of follow-up questions:\n\n- When you say you &quot;have to test all the classes and methods&quot;, doesn&#39;t\nthat kind of dictate that &quot;just&quot; testing the database connection and\nsome other class is by definition not enough?\n\n- When you say, &quot;test the database connection&quot;, what exactly do you\nmean? What would the unit be that you&#39;re testing? A class that talks\nto the database over JDBC?\n\nLasse\n\n\n         \n\n       Fussy? Opinionated? Impossible to please? Perfect.
