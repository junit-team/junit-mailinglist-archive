In my experience, big projects ideally simply are<br/>\nbe composed of more modules of a similar size than small project modules<br/>\nhave, with a similar amount of packages, with a similar amount of classes<br/>\nper package. And of course the classes shouldn&#39;t be bigger just because it&#39;s<br/>\na bigger project. So it shouldn&#39;t be harder to find the tests for a class in<br/>\na big project than it is in a small project, should it?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Also note that it is also bad option to rerun<br/>\n&gt; all tests because there are too many of them to be runned on each <br/>\n&gt; change.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It should be at least possible to run all the tests of the whole module the<br/>\nclass belongs to. If those tests take too long for that, I&#39;d worry about<br/>\neither module size or test performance...<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my 0.02...<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers, Ilja</div>",
