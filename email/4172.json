For &#39;public&#39; and &#39;protected&#39; methods, I&#39;ll attempt first to make the method cohesive and give it a signature that&#39;s as expressive as possible .  If the signature still isn&#39;t completely obvious as to the intent of the method, or there&#39;s something particularly interesting about the method behavior, then I&#39;ll add JavaDoc.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; I sort of agree with the idea that that tests can be used to document<br/>\n&gt; methods but have these problems with that:<br/>\n&gt; 1. Tests do not explain the methods, merely give examples of use.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Examples constitute explanation to some degree, IMO.  In cases where the method does something particularly interesting, as mentioned above, I&#39;ll try to add a test to explain the behavior in addition to adding JavaDoc.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; 2.
