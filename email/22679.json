If a candidate manages to solve complex<br/>\n&gt; programming problems during the interview and they have never heard of TDD<br/>\n&gt; before, it will be easy for them to learn if you are imposing this at your<br/>\n&gt; company (a mistake in my opinion, but that&#39;s a separate topic).<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m also aware, for such a simple technique, that a lot of people haven&#39;t learned how to actually deliver incrementally. It&#39;s like OO, everyone knows about inheritance but fewer have a deeper understanding.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the meantime, there&#39;s a nice living to be had cleaning up all those complex programming problems where testing came later ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; As for your remark about incremental development, all the examples I have<br/>\n&gt; seen of TDD when you start from scratch begin by testing trivial cases.  It<br/>\n&gt; will take at least a half hour before the candidate starts writing code<br/>\n&gt; that&#39;s actually complex, which is why I think it&#39;s a waste of time in an<br/>\n&gt; interview.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s easy to solve, just don&#39;t start from scratch but from a partial codebase. It&#39;s been years since I got to start a project completely clean.<br/>\n<br/>\nS. </span></blockquote></div>",
