Why do you not\n&gt; use List,\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; Set and Map from the Java collections library? The tedious part\n&gt; is when\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; you duplicate existing features, not because of testing. :)\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; Good luck.\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; My collection is persistent and I use annotation reflection inside it.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Perhaps I don&#39;t know your persistence tool. Which one do you use? Can\n&gt;  &gt; you annotate only the item to persist the collection?\n&gt; \n&gt; I create a concept - well... if it is possible - of entities,\n&gt; containers and state machines: With &quot;entities&quot; I define a business\n&gt; logic; the &quot;container&quot; is a collection of &quot;entities&quot;, it is a &quot;entity&quot;\n&gt; too; the &quot;state machine&quot; is responsible by create and use GUIs,\n&gt; DataBases, reports, etc...\n&gt; The &quot;state machine&quot; implement a &quot;factory pattern&quot;, it receive as\n&gt; parameter a &quot;entity&quot; or a &quot;container of entities&quot; and than build GUIs,\n&gt; DataBases, wherever...\n&gt; The &quot;state machine&quot; have a &quot;indexed property&quot;, than I need check if\n&gt; this property is correctly populated. That is the problem, is really\n&gt; painfully do this kind of test for all new state machine. Maybe\n&gt; generics solve my problem.\n&gt; \n&gt; If you have some idea I really like to listen.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks about our time. :)\n\nYou are welcome. I have one question: did you implement this \nsuccessfully for any specific case yet? Your ideas sound very general, \nand I worry that you are thinking too generally too quickly. I recommend \nyou start with one specific case of an entity first, then show that you \nneed the container and state machine. I find it easier to prove a design \ndecision with a specific case than with the general case.\n\nGood luck.\n-- \nJ. B.
