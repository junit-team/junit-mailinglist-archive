Polymorphism could be used nicely for summing up the\ndifferent poi=\r\nnts at the end. Just a thought.\n\n&gt; Now my test methods get quite large. Eac=\r\nh of them assures that the tile \n&gt; has just (and only) the requested featur=\r\nes. So each test checks for \n&gt; special items on the cards (e.g. isAbbey, is=\r\nMarketsquare) and counts \n&gt; the roads coming in and the city parts a tile h=\r\nas.\n\nCould be static attributes of more specialized classes....\n\n&gt; What do =\r\nyou think about this test case size?\n\nDo your your test methods test on the=\r\n same level of abstraction?\nIf you have different levels of abstraction in =\r\none test I would\nsuggest to extract the lower level stuff to a separate met=\r\nhod. \n\n&gt; Would you create additional methods to help in testing, i.e. for \n=\r\n&gt; counting the roads on one tile or a method like isSpecial?\n&gt; Would you pl=\r\nace such helpers in the test class (as they are only used \n&gt; for testing)? =\r\nDoes that get to complex, i.e. do you eventually need \n&gt; test cases for you=\r\nr test cases?\n\nI guess you will need this anyway in your application. Just =\r\nput\nit into the test class and if necessary refactor it to the tile\nclass.\n=\r\n\n&gt; Would you rely on some orientation of created tiles, e.g. assume the \n&gt; =\r\nleft turning road is always constructed as from east turning to south \n&gt; (m=\r\naybe this is like the Blackbox / Whitebox discussion)?\n\nWhat about keeping =\r\nthe orientation in the board? I think the\norientation is not so much an att=\r\nribute of a tile but of the\nplacement of the tile on the board.\n\nFrank.\n\n\n",
