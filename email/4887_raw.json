We all know how a radio works.  It&#39;s \ninterface\n&gt; is the same no matter where you go--you have a control to change the\n&gt; station and a control to change the volume.  There are several \nmodels\n&gt; of the radio, and in a store, there are many instances of each \nmodel.\n&gt; \n&gt;[...]\n&gt; \n&gt; You can only really do black box testing in this type of \nenvironment.\n&gt; You have the advantage of knowing what the component does.  You \ndon&#39;t\n&gt; know how it does it--and from the perspective of using the component\n&gt; you don&#39;t care.\n\nYes. But from the perspective of developing the component, you *do* \ncare. I am sure that radios get white box tested at the plant.\n\n&gt; I have created a test harness using JUnit for my components, so \nthat I\n&gt; can test several component types with one TestCase.  It&#39;s a \nbeautiful\n&gt; thing.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now, If I tried to write a white-box test on my component, I run \ninto\n&gt; some serious setbacks.  That white-box (or micro test) is tied to \nthe\n&gt; component implementation.  I cannot reuse that test on another\n&gt; implementation of the same component interface.  That is a serious\n&gt; drawback to me.\n\nA very serious drawback of not adjusting tests to implementation \ndetails is that sufficient tests for one implementation are most \nprobably insufficient for another. That doesn&#39;t mean that you can&#39;t \nreuse them - it&#39;s just that it isn&#39;t safe relying on them.\n\n\n",
