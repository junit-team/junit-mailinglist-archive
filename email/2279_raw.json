I am supposed to \n&gt;implement JUnit tests on code that I have just written. However, what \n&gt;I have learned in school does not seem to apply here!  We learned \n&gt;that if the method is an &quot;add&quot; method, give it two numbers, \n&gt;and &quot;assert&quot; that the correct addition is performed, and so on. . .  \n&gt;well, I have no clue what to assert! \n&gt; \n&gt;Quick rundown of what I am testing: \n&gt; \n&gt;Basically, my code is using the Reflection class to check all the \n&gt;members of a class for a certain type of compatibility.  Most methods \n&gt;add errors to an error vector, and then there is a simple print \n&gt;function to print out the vector... How on earth do I test this \n&gt;class??  \n&gt; \n&gt;Thanks for any help in advance!! \nYou should pair-program with the writer of this code to refactor it to be\nmore testable. Search the web for &quot;test-first-design&quot;, &quot;test-first-coding&quot;,\n&quot;refactoring&quot;, etc... search Ward&#39;s Wiki as well:\n&lt;http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?FindPage&gt;.\n\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\njunit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n\n\nYour use of Yahoo!
