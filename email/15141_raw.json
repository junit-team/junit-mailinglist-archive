WIN AN iPOD NANO!\n\nIf you are an active user/contributor to a company wiki, consider \ntaking this survey and have your name entered into a raffle for an iPod Nano!\n\nhttps://emarshall2.usc.edu/ultimatesurvey/takeSurvey.asp?surveyID=419\n\nTake a moment and read these questions:\n\n* Have you thought about how your use of corporate wikis compare to \nother people using corporate wikis?\n\n* Have you wondered if other people contribute to their company&#39;s \nwiki for the same reasons you do?\n\n* Have you wondered why some people are comfortable editing others&#39; \nstuff on wikis and others are not comfortable doing it?\n\n* Is there anything about your company&#39;s use of wikis that bothers you?\n\n* Have you ever been interested in contributing to research that is \ngoing to help identify lessons learned about how to enhance corporate \nuse of wikis?\n\n* Do you have any interest in winning an iPod Nano?\n\nIf you answered any of these questions &quot;yes&quot;, then consider taking \nthis survey and be entered into a drawing for a free iPod Nano. Why \nnot give it a try?\n\nThis survey is being conducted by Dr. Ann Majchrzak, Marshall School \nof Business, University of Southern California and Dr. Christian \nWagner, City University of Hong Kong. We&#39;ve been asked by the Society \nfor Information Management&#39;s Advanced Practices Council (a \nprofessional society of Chief Information Officers in the U.S. (see \nhttp://simnet.org)) to conduct a survey of active (contributing) \ncorporate wiki users. We will use your responses to identify lessons \nlearned about how to enhance corporate use of wikis. By corporate \nwiki, we mean a wiki used in a company to further the goals of that \norganization. Such a wiki might be used for tasks including R&D, \nproject management, helpdesk activities or knowledge sharing.\n\nThank you for your time!\n\nAnn Majchrzak\nProfessor of Information Systems\nMarshall School of Business\nUniversity of Southern California\nLos Angeles, CA  90089\nmajchrza@...\n\n\n\n\n\n",
