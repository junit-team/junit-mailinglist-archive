Sometimes I work with streams, sometimes I\n&gt;  work with Fi=\r\nle objects and sometimes, I just want the content of the file as\n&gt;  an arra=\r\ny of strings or as one big String.  It&#39;s unfortunate that the latter\n&gt;  is =\r\nstill not supported in the JDK.\n\nThe reason I am asking is that I always se=\r\nem to prefer a\nFileStream/Reader/Writer to working directly with a file. I =\r\nhave\nnoticed that a lot of people seem to have a preference towards working=\r\n\nwith files rather than Streams/Readers/Writers.\n\nIf I would want random ac=\r\nces or something I would opt for working\ndirectly with files but I can&#39;t re=\r\ncall needing that, I have not\nwritten storages or such. Another occation wh=\r\nen I use file objects is\nwhen doing file system management, creating listin=\r\ng, renaming, working\nwith directories etc. But when I read/write data i alw=\r\nays use\nstreams/readers/writers.\n\nCould you give an example when you think =\r\nthat reading/writing directly\nto/from a File is better than a stream.\n\nAlso=\r\n, when you have your array of Strings or single big string, what\ndo you typ=\r\nically do with it? I can think of some things but I am\ncurious.\n\nOne of the=\r\n reasons I prefer Streams so much is because of the\nadvantage of being able=\r\n to direct state to memory rather than disk and\nvary source/target media (l=\r\nike parser might just aswell get its input\nfrom a keyboard, socket, file, m=\r\nemory-location, it should not be bound\nto a file). The first point of direc=\r\nting state to memory is\nindispensable when testing.\n\nAlso, files imply muta=\r\nble state of the worst kind. Most of the bugs I\nfind in my code have to do =\r\nwith mutablestate in one way or another and\nthus I try to avoid it when pos=\r\nsible. That is also why I am a fan of\ninteractionbased testing.\n\nJust tossi=\r\nng some of my reasoning in there to be analysed, questioned\nand developed.\n=\r\n/J\n\n",
