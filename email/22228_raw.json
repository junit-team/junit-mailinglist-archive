What&#39;s the point of declaring that=\r\n b() depends\non a() if b() doesn&#39;t need any state created by a()?  By doing=\r\n this, you are\ncausing your test run to needlessly take longer if you are r=\r\nunning in\nparallel (since b() can&#39;t be run until after a() has completed, w=\r\nhile it\ncould be run in parallel if you didn&#39;t declare that dependency).\n\nI=\r\n&#39;m going to think more about this and see if I can find a counter example\nt=\r\no prove my impression wrong.\n\n-- \n***C=C3=A9dric\n*\n\n\nOn Wed, Dec 23, 2009 a=\r\nt 1:46 PM, David Saff &lt;david@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Can we agree that when=\r\n someone says test A &quot;depends on&quot; test B, they\n&gt; may mean one of these, but=\r\n not necessarily both?\n&gt;\n&gt; 1) If test A fails, test B can provide no additi=\r\nonal information, so\n&gt; it&#39;s a waste of time to run B, and a waste of the de=\r\nvelopers&#39; time to\n&gt; report B as a failure to investigate (efficiency)\n&gt; 2) =\r\nTest A&#39;s execution changes global state in a way that test B needs\n&gt; in ord=\r\ner to run correctly.

There is no way to define an\n&gt; &gt;&gt; order, because in my experience indepe=\r\nndent tests are much more valuable\n&gt; &gt;&gt; than order-dependent tests.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; Every time I&#39;ve had order dependencies I have had a problem with the\n&gt; d=\r\nesign\n&gt; &gt;&gt; of the underlying system. Investing my available time in improvi=\r\nng the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; design has had a much higher payoff than investing that same ti=\r\nme into\n&gt; &gt;&gt; shuffling tests around.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I found that if the testi=\r\nng framework takes care of removing certain\n&gt; &gt; practical obstacles, depend=\r\nent testing is actually very easy to implement\n&gt; &gt; and to use.  For example=\r\n, if method c() depends on b() and a() and you\n&gt; only\n&gt; &gt; want to run c(), =\r\nyou should be able to say &quot;run c()&quot; and the framework\n&gt; will\n&gt; &gt; figure out=\r\n which dependencies need to be run.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; My experience with TestNG sho=\r\nwed me that the fears often associated with\n&gt; &gt; test dependencies are very =\r\noverstated, and dependent testing is actually\n&gt; &gt; extremely useful for a lo=\r\nt of scenarios such as web testing (where\n&gt; &gt; navigating from page to page =\r\nadds state at each step, and having to\n&gt; recreate\n&gt; &gt; that state from scrat=\r\nch would be very expensive).  Users of Selenium +\n&gt; &gt; TestNG with dependenc=\r\nies can probably make a good case at giving you more\n&gt; &gt; details on this.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Independent tests enable interesting transformations l=\r\nike parallel\n&gt; &gt;&gt; execution or the kind of dynamic reordering that let JUni=\r\nt Max deliver\n&gt; &gt;&gt; failures more quickly.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Dependencies and par=\r\nallelism are actually not mutually exclusive at all.\n&gt; &gt;  Here are a couple=\r\n of articles I wrote that describe the multithreaded\n&gt; &gt; topological sort a=\r\nlgorithm that I implemented in TestNG:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; http://beust.com/weblog/arch=\r\nives/000535.html\n&gt; &gt; http://beust.com/weblog/archives/000536.html\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; T=\r\nhis should be especially of interest to developers interested in hard\n&gt; &gt; c=\r\noncurrency issues, but all this complexity is completely hidden away\n&gt; from=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; users.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; With TestNG, you specify your dependencies (e.g. &quot;@Test=\r\n(dependsOnMethods\n&gt; =3D\n&gt; &gt; &quot;f&quot;)), then your thread pool size (thread-pool-=\r\nsize=3D15) and TestNG will\n&gt; &gt; figure out how to run all your tests (both d=\r\nependent and non dependent\n&gt; ones)\n&gt; &gt; in the most efficient parallel manne=\r\nr by using the threads you supplied\n&gt; as\n&gt; &gt; well as possible.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; ***C=C3=A9dric\n&gt; &gt; *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this message ha=\r\nve been removed]\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Yahoo!
