Sounds l=\r\nike\nyou&#39;ve reached the boredom point.  One thing worth discussing as a\nteam=\r\n is if you&#39;ve already tested everything that could possibly go\nwrong.  For =\r\nexample, imagine that you&#39;re collecting a customer&#39;s\npayment information, a=\r\nnd want to test the software&#39;s behavior when the\npayment information is rej=\r\nected.  Further, it could be rejected\nbecause:\n\n- The credit card number is=\r\n invalid\n- The card has expired\n- The card address does not match the addre=\r\nss given\n\nIf I was starting to get bored, I&#39;d probably test all of these\nsc=\r\nenarios with unit or functional tests, and just one with a UI test,\nfigurin=\r\ng that if all those tests worked, the odds would be low that UI\ntests of th=\r\ne other scenarios would reveal new information.\n\nDoes this make sense?\n\n   =\r\nDavid\n\nOn Fri, Nov 13, 2009 at 11:55 AM, Inanc Gumus &lt;inanc.gumus@...=\r\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; There is a library which contains service/domain/infrastructure =\r\nlayers.
