I&#39;m trying to understand what actually happens with NUnit. I mark a\ntes=\r\nt as &quot;slow&quot;, and run all of the tests in my project. Are you saying that\nwi=\r\nthout selecting the category of tests to run, the IDE doesn&#39;t run the\nslow =\r\ntests, that is it only runs tests which are not marked as slow? If\nthis is =\r\nso, how does it know which are the slow tests?\n\nSo, if I understand correct=\r\nly, your goal here is to allow a user to mark a\ntest as &quot;slow&quot; and from the=\r\nn on, if the user runs all tests in Eclipse,\nthese tests get ignored.\nThis =\r\nwould be achievable if we changed the eclipse plugin for JUnit, and\nwouldn&#39;=\r\nt need a change to JUnit itself. You could have a set of categories\nto igno=\r\nre when running the tests from Eclipse, which would be settable from\nthe pr=\r\noject properties or wherever.\n\nCoudl you please clarify what actually happe=\r\nns in an IDE with NUnit?\n\nThanks.\n\nMatthew Farwell.\n\n2013/1/23 Mark Levison=\r\n &lt;mark@...&gt;\n\n&gt; **\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Kevin, Colin and anyone else who is intere=\r\nsted,\n&gt;\n&gt; Let&#39;s imagine the scenario here. I show up at client site as part=\r\n of a two\n&gt; week engagement. During the 3 days of training we discuss Hill&#39;=\r\ns definition\n&gt; of a Microtest; SPiFFy; etc. Now they all understand no **go=\r\nod** unit test\n&gt; touches the file system, database, network etc. In additio=\r\nn they&#39;ve groked\n&gt; the value of creating only a small object graph for each=\r\n test, max 7-8\n&gt; objects.\n&gt;\n&gt; Here comes the hard part, they&#39;ve got legacy =\r\ncode. They sincerely want to\n&gt; do good stuff going forward, but their tests=\r\n take ~25 minutes to run.\n&gt; Profiling indicates that there are ~35 tests ov=\r\ner ~20 test classes that are\n&gt; slow. In almost every case slow tests are mi=\r\nxed in with fast tests. In\n&gt; addition many of these slow tests could be mad=\r\ne fast (and more valuable) if\n&gt; we just made some clever use of fakes. Howe=\r\nver this changeover will take\n&gt; easily a couple of months of part time effo=\r\nrt.\n&gt;\n&gt; In the world of NUnit we would just mark these as members of the ca=\r\ntegory\n&gt; slow. In JUnit we either:\n&gt;\n&gt; - mark them as members of the catego=\r\nry slow and resort to @suite\n&gt; annotations\n&gt; - mark them as members of the =\r\ncategory slow and use maven tricks - helps\n&gt; the build server but not the i=\r\nndividual developer running eclipse\n&gt; - move the slow tests to a separate s=\r\nource tree. Works well when you\n&gt; intentional write slow tests from scratch=\r\n but not so much when you inherit\n&gt; this existing mess.\n&gt;\n&gt; As it stands I =\r\ncan waste alot of time with a client trying to overcome this\n&gt; issue when w=\r\ne should be practicing TDD, Mikado method, etc.\n&gt;\n&gt; Again my key point for =\r\nJUnit 5 before discussing new things like Lambda&#39;s I\n&gt; think the challenge =\r\nshould be to make the existing functionality as simple\n&gt; to use as possible=\r\n.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Cheers\n&gt; Mark Levison\n&gt; Agile Pain Relief Consulting http://agilepa=\r\ninrelief.com/notesfromatooluser\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; | Writing http://agilepainrelief.com/=\r\nnotesfromatooluser/&gt;\n&gt; Proud Sponsor of Agile Tour Gatineau Ottawa http://g=\r\noagiletour.ca/&gt; Nov\n&gt; 28, Toronto http://www.torontoagilecommunity.org/disp=\r\nlay/PUBLIC/Home&gt;\n&gt; 26 and Montreal http://agilemontreal.ca/agile-tour-2012/=\r\n&gt; 24\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n[N=\r\non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
