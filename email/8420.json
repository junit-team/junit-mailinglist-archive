Here you test the behaviour of<br/>\nyour integrated application against a predefined<br/>\nbehaviour with the mock objects.You may not be able to<br/>\ndo all the tests here which you could do as part of<br/>\nyour unit test.<br/>\nEven an integration test test wont guarantee that your<br/>\ncode is going to work in a system test with the true<br/>\nexternal components in place.<br/>\n<br/>\nRgds<br/>\nBJ<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Mike Bresnahan &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:java-junit@...\">java-junit@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I have experience with integration testing but not<br/>\n&gt; much with unit testing.<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve been reading up on unit testing  (e.g. mock<br/>\n&gt; objects, test first<br/>\n&gt; development).  However, I have not found an article<br/>\n&gt; that explains the<br/>\n&gt; advantages of unit testing vs integration testing. <br/>\n&gt; My perhaps naive hunch<br/>\n&gt; is that the cost-per-bug-eliminated of unit testing<br/>\n&gt; is higher than that of<br/>\n&gt; integration testing.  It appears this way because a<br/>\n&gt; single integration test<br/>\n&gt; tests a lot more code than a single unit test and<br/>\n&gt; takes about the same<br/>\n&gt; amount of time to construct.  Plus it seems to me<br/>\n&gt; that a whole suite of unit<br/>\n&gt; tests with 100% code coverage cannot guarantee that<br/>\n&gt; even the simplest system<br/>\n&gt; wide behavior is correct (e.g. the web page<br/>\n&gt; appears).  Am I wrong about<br/>\n&gt; this?  Can someone refer me information about this<br/>\n&gt; topic.  A scientific<br/>\n&gt; study paper with real numbers would be welcome.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Mike Bresnahan<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nSBC Yahoo!
