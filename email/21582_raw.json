I haven&#39;t subsequently used\n&gt;&gt; this freedom to any good effect, but it seemed like a good idea at the\n&gt;&gt; time.\n&gt;\n&gt; Does anyone have an example where this has been used to good effect?\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Mark Thornton\n\nI experimented for some time with having a test class that inherited\nfrom the class under test, as a cheap way to override some methods,\nbut didn&#39;t get enough value for the design cost to continue doing\nthat.\n\n_Requiring_ test classes to extend a common base class had design\nissues.  One of the biggest was that inheritance became the favorite\nextension mechanism of JUnit extensions.  If you want to test GWT,\ninherit from GwtTestCase.  If you want to test with mocks, inherit\nfrom MockObjectTestCase.  If you want to test GWT with mocks... ack.*\n\nJUnit 4.0 got half-way to fixing this, by dropping the required\ninheritance.  I believe 4.7 will finish the job, by allowing a lot of\nthe standard extensions to use Interceptors, which are just fields.\nIt&#39;s much easier to add a field to a class than to insert an\nadditional superclass.\n\nI hadn&#39;t realized it, but if someone will raise a feature request for\na CurrentTestName interceptor, I&#39;d happily put it in for the next\nsnapshot release.\n\n   David Saff\n\n* I&#39;m picking on two tools I&#39;m familiar with, and I&#39;m not claiming\nthere&#39;s not already better ways to do this.\n\n",
