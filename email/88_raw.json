I&#39;ve reached a problem that others\nhave encountered as well.\nHere&#39;s the problem:\nI&#39;ve been asked, by my team leader, to write what&#39;s\ncalled an AbstractNavigator.  It doesn&#39;t matter what a\nNavigator is, the important point is that\nAbstractNavigator is an abstract class. This abstract\nclass has a couple subclasses already (MDINavigator\nand TabbedPaneNavigator), and more will be written in\nthe future.  \nWe want to create unit tests (using JUnit, let&#39;s say\nAbstractUnitTest) which will apply to any\nAbstractNavigator.  Herein lies the problem.  I can&#39;t\nactually test the AbstractNavigator because I can&#39;t\n&quot;have a(n)&quot; AbstractNavigator since it&#39;s abstract. \nTherefore, I need to test a subclass of the\nAbstractNavigator, but currently, the only way I see\nof doing that (making the AbstractUnitTest &quot;have a&quot;\nMDINavigator) restricts the abstractedness of the unit\ntests.  The AbstractUnitTest could not be used without\nrecompiling, a step to be avoided.\nAnother method we&#39;ve thought of is to add a method\n&quot;getNavigator&quot; to the AbstractUnitTest which is called\nfrom the TestCase setUp() method.  This getNavigator\nmethod would only be implemented by subclassing the\nAbstractUnitTest class and would then return the\nspecific type of AbstractNavigator to be tested (i.e.\nMDINavigator).  The problem with this solution is that\nthe method of TestCase which returns the TestSuite is\nstatic and therefore cannot be overridden...where to\ngo from here?\n\nIf anyone can give us any more information about this\nkind of abstract unit testing, we would greatly\nappreciate it.\nThanks,\nCJ\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
