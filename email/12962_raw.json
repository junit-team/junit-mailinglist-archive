We are facing a dilemma that I hope you can help us with. How are dependent unit tests handled? \n\nFor example, there are 2 independent methods that must be tested, but to test them and clean-up they become dependent. So, the methods are addRecordToDB() and deleteRecordFromDB(). Additionally, addRecordToDB() will fail if the record already exists in the database.\n\nTo test that addRecordToDB() can add a new record, testAddRecordToDB() must ensure that the record does not already exist, which relies on a deleteRecordFormDB() message in setUp().\n\nTo test that deleteRecordFromDB() can delete an existing record, testDeleteRecordFromDB() must ensure that the record already exists in the database, which relies on an addRecordToDB() in setUp().\n\nTo test that addRecordToDB() fails if the record already exists, testAddRecordToDBDuplication() must ensure that either \n\n- the record does not already exist, which relies on deleteRecordFromDB() in setUp() and 2 addRecordToDB() messages in the test method OR\n\n- the record already exists, which relies on 1 addRecordToDB() message in setup() and 1 addRecordToDB() message in the test Method\n\nThese same issues also affect the tearDown() method.\n\nGenerically stated, should a test method&#39;s setUp() and tearDown() rely on an untested method? If not, how can we avoid it? Is there a way to enforce the sequence of test method runs?\n\nAny advice would be appreciated. Thanks.\n\n\n\t\t\n---------------------------------\nDo you Yahoo!?\n Yahoo! Mail - You care about security. So do we.\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n\n\n",
