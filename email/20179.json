We are working on trying to reduce the <br/>\noverheads for the JUnit tester as much as possible, as well as <br/>\nprovide an ANT task to run our tool, so people can tie it in with <br/>\ntheir ANT builds.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI appreciate that purely for ad-hoc execution, then it can easily be <br/>\ndone via an IDE or the shell prompt, in which case this could be an <br/>\nover engineered solution - so I can see your point of view. But as <br/>\nwell as execution, we&#39;re aiming to provide something that will <br/>\nschedule automated test runs and provide historical results for <br/>\ntheir test suites and each case executed etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\nLes.</div>",
