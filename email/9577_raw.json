So in that sense, information certainly got lost.\n\nBut a correct compiler will preserve sufficient information that\nprocess-execution complies with what the source code specifies.\n\n\nNow about the Java bytecodes; I never looked at them. But I do know that\nthere&#39;s a &#39;constant pool&#39; for every class which contains all the string\nconstants referenced somehow in that class; either thru method-invocation or\ndirect string refs. Method-calling should use the values from this same\nconstant-pool; the method-invocation itself contains a reference to this\nentry in the constant-pool.\n\nSo 10 invocations of the same method in the same class don&#39;t cause the\nentire method-name to be included in the constant-pool for every invocation.\nIf the same string-constant *does* appear multiple times in a classes&#39;\nconstant pool that can be said to be a compiler bug - after all, string are\nimmutable.\n\nAbout parsing the string to find out the actual bytecode to invoke on a\nmethod invocation - I have no idea how that is done.\n\nHow does a C++ compiler/linker actually store the names of the methods that\nit needs to call? Doesn&#39;t it also have to store a lot of information about\nthe namespaces, method names, overloads, parameter types, etc? To determine\ndynamically at runtime / dll-loadtime where in the code the CPU needs to\njump for a virtual method invocation? Where does it store that info, and\nwhen/where/how is that resolved to a memory-address?\n\nIs Java-bytecode really hugely inefficient compared to how C++ solves the\nproblem?\n\n\nregards,\n\n--Tim\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Ron Jeffries [mailto:ronjeffries@...]\nSent: dinsdag 30 september 2003 19:44\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: Re: [junit] Re: Help plz...\n\n\nOn Tuesday, September 30, 2003, at 12:07:31 PM, Jim Dixon wrote:\n\n&gt;&gt; &gt; I know that this is official Sun doctrine.  But compilation is always\n&gt;&gt; &gt; a lossy process, and the smaller the target instruction set, the more\n&gt;&gt; &gt; information you lose.  The JVM has a small instruction set.  To\nincrement\n&gt;&gt; &gt; a variable, you put a 1 on the stack and say &quot;add&quot;.  Oh my :-(\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Why does that trouble you?\n\n&gt; Is this a real question??\n\nYes.\n\n&gt; It&#39;s just an example.  With a larger instruction set, you can increment\n&gt; variables in place, at a lower cost in terms of code size and run time.\n\n&gt; The main point is that compilation is a lossy process.  When you write\n&gt; i++ it&#39;s succinct but very clear.  The compiler translates this into\n&gt;   push variable\n&gt;   push 1\n&gt;   add\n&gt;   store variable\n&gt; While it&#39;s not impossible, it&#39;s difficult and expensive for a bytecode\n&gt; (re)compiler to sort out what&#39;s going on here and optimize back to the\n&gt; succintness of the original.  The larger the instruction set, the more\n&gt; information preserved in the bytecode, the less difficult and expensive\n&gt; the process is.\n\nOn the contrary, when it comes to the execution of the program, compilation\nis emphatically not a lossy process. If it were, then the program&#39;s\nbehavior would not be what we expect. If it is what we expect, then no\ninformation has been lost.\n\nRon Jeffries\nwww.XProgramming.com\nGet over it.  -- The Eagles\n\n\n\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\njunit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n \n\nYour use of Yahoo!
