I ended up making a packeage test case that<br/>\nran all the rest as well as some of it&#39;s own. I find myself writing a sample<br/>\nusage (outside the package) - something a client would do or use as an<br/>\nexample or maybe to load test. So I made this guy run the package test and<br/>\nthen his own tests. Seems like we will end up with some kind of hierarchy of<br/>\ntests.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe make web apps and do some web services, so we will have a few different<br/>\nkinds of test (cactus, httpunut, ...)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sure that the engineers and qa people have been inventing this stuff for<br/>\n50 years. Otoh, we may not want to inherit all of that. faqs like<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.faqs.org/faqs/software-eng/testing-faq/\">http://www.faqs.org/faqs/software-eng/testing-faq/</a> may be some kind of happy<br/>\nmedium?<br/>\n<br/>\nI was wondering kinds of hierarchies and what dependencies between the types<br/>\nand levels of testing that people who use junit have invented?<br/>\n<br/>\nAny pointers will be appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks</div>",
