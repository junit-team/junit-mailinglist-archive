(So if you modify method A.foo() and class B calls A.foo(), then\n&gt; &gt; _ATest and _BTest will be executed.) This is to get around the problem of\n&gt; &gt; our test suite being really slow, which is something that I want to fix\n&gt; &gt; but cannot (for non-technical reasons).\n&gt;\n&gt; WOW!!! That sounds much better than the other utilities I&#39;ve been\n&gt; able to find for this, and certainly more feature-rich than I&#39;d have\n&gt; time to write myself. Any chance that the TestSuite you write would\n&gt; be available?\n\nI wouldn&#39;t be able to release the code I wrote for two reasons: it&#39;s\nprobably copyrighted by my company, and it uses a lot of utility class\ncode from my project (for preferences, files, strings, file lists, etc.).\n\nHowever, I&#39;d be happy to make a new project on SourceForge or something\nand create a version that isn&#39;t dependent on other code, especially if\nother people are interested in helping out.\n\nI have to warn you that my design is probably all wrong because I don&#39;t\nreally understand the JUnit architecture yet. I probably should have\ncreated a TestCollector or something, but instead I created a subclass of\nTestSuite that builds the list of TestCases and returns them by overriding\nthe testAt() and tests() methods.\n\n\nErik\n\n\n\n",
