One of =\r\ntest case just checks\nthe title of Frame and second test checks the value o=\r\nf a combobox. \n\n   The problem is not with Abbot framework, because I have =\r\ntested a\nsample application with Abbot with the same testcases. But as I ru=\r\nn\nthe test cases with My Original application, junit gets exited without\npr=\r\ninting any information about the problem.\n   \n   May the problem be with my=\r\n application, but should junit not report\nthe problem why it got interrupte=\r\nd. Because it is not telling the\nreason of the problem, how can I debug the=\r\n problem ?\n\n   \nThanks\n\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Carfield Yim&quot; &lt;carf=\r\nield@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Will that indicate a possible deadlock??\n&gt; \n&gt; On 10/29=\r\n/07, jls_nayak1983 &lt;jls_nayak1983@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;  Hi,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  I am working on Junit testing for swing application.
