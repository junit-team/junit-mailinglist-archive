Of course if your system is massive then a\nfull system test is out the question, but if you break your tests into\nsuites then you can run the suites on the section that you have being\nworking on.  Then run the rest of the tests overnight.\n\nJUnit does tell you which test failed, so isolating the test shouldn&#39;t be a\nproblem and if your test is only testing one method than it shouldn&#39;t be a\nproblem either, because your method is nice and simple right?  Unless you\nhave inherited some legacy stuff and have only started your unit testing in\nthe middle of your project.  Also why would the build take so long.  You\nonly have to re-build the class you altered don&#39;t you?\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Stevens, Timothy J.

You want all tests to\n&gt;pass so if one fails, find it, fix your code, and go again.\n\nThis can be a big problem in large systems that take minutes (or longer) to\ncompile and test. It&#39;s nice to get a complete list of failures so that you\ncan attempt to fix as many as possible before having to dive into the build\nprocess again...\n\n-tim\n\n\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\njunit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n \n\nYour use of Yahoo!
