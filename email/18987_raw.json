I just want them tested with minimum effort\nrequired to test them, while keeping the tests tightly\nlinked with the build process, so that the tests are\nalways testing what will run in production.\n  \n&gt; a) as already mentioned by others, see if there is\n&gt; some way you can\n&gt; structure your code so that you can implicitly test\n&gt; whats private with\n&gt; little effort. \n&gt;As has already been suggested your\n&gt; *Helper may want to\n&gt; have different names, some may want to be merged,\n&gt; some broken up. And\n&gt; according to my taste stop being static and then\n&gt; injected to the class\n&gt; you want to test.\n\nI usually inject the *Class, but the *ClassHelper has\nall static methods.  It&#39;s methods receive all\narguments from the *Class.  It&#39;s a &quot;Private&quot; utility\nlibrary so to speak.  Only the *Class stores state.\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; A lot of good stuff can be found here:\n&gt;\nhttp://www.objectmentor.com/resources/publishedArticles.html\n&gt; (click on by topic  | design)\n&gt; \n\nThanks for the link.  I&#39;ll have a look.\n\n&gt; I would start looking at the single responsibility\n&gt; principle. That is\n&gt; in my experience the principle that had the biggest\n&gt; impact on my\n&gt; unit-testing (together with the depenency inversion\n&gt; principle).\n\n\nYes - I think Dependency Injection rocks.  I also like\nseparation of concerns and single responsibility.  A\nfew of the reasons I like Class + ClassHelper is that\nClassHelper is unique to Class, and ClassHelper\nmethods can be easily moved to a utility library\nlater, with a minimum amount of refactoring, along\nwith the corresponding tests.  It also keeps Class\nvery clean and focused.  When I look at Class, I see\nprecisely what it does, without a lot of clutter.  It\nstores state, and has a few methods that are focused\non it&#39;s core concern/responsibility/role.\n\n\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; b) consider making them package-private or default\n&gt; if you prefer to\n&gt; call it that (remove the private, protected, public\n&gt; modifier\n&gt; entirely). This is just above private, these methods\n&gt; are only\n&gt; accessible by other classes in the same package. Not\n&gt; even subclasses\n&gt; can access them if they are in a different package\n&gt; (there is a common\n&gt; misunderstanding that default  less restricted than\n&gt; protected, it&#39;s\n&gt; really the other way around.\n\nThanks for the review :-)  I think it would be great\nto have cheat sheet for that one :-)\n\nI like to have my tests in separate packages\nsometimes, and sometimes in separate projects, so that\nmakes it a little trickier.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; c) perform securitymanager stunts to acces the\n&gt; actual private methods.\n&gt; I would consider this a bit paranoid.\n&gt;\n\nYeah - I think even if the the private / protected /\ndefault access constraints could could be turned off\nin the JVM for testing, I may still stick with Class +\nClassHelper for reasons I specify at the end.\n \n&gt; I look at both b) and c) as workarounds. Sometimes\n&gt; we need workarounds\n&gt; until we figure out how everything should fit.\n&gt; \n&gt; Of course, if you are comfortable with the helper\n&gt; style, by all means\n&gt; continue with that. From where I&#39;m standing it looks\n&gt; like it is the\n&gt; design part of TDD that wants to be listened to. I\n&gt; am standing quite\n&gt; far away though so I may be wrong.\n\nI think you hit the nail on the head :-)\n\nI think designs that result from test driven\ndevelopment are clean, simple, and easy to work with\nand improve.\n\nThe tests are also a great source of documentation.\n\nI also prefer to minimize the amount of code in the\n&quot;Core Project&quot; and utilize utility libraries as much\nas possible.  This means less documentation effort and\nmore utility libraries for everyone to use.  Less\ncoding too.\n\nSo I try to move methods to utilities as much as\npossible.  Using the Helper makes it easy for myself\nand others to do this, when working in teams.  Also,\nthe overhead  of wondering &quot;How should we structure\nthis so we can test everything&quot; is eliminated.  We\njust say \n\nClass + Helper :-)\n\nCheers,\n- Ole\n\n&gt; \n&gt; /J\n&gt; \n&gt; On 2/21/07, Ole Ersoy &lt;ole_ersoy@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yes - I assumed parts of the &quot;All Methods Public&quot;\n&gt; &gt; thread in here.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; To summarize:\n&gt; &gt; By putting methods on a Helper and making them\n&gt; public\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m simulating being able to turn off\n&gt; &gt; private/protected checking on methods in the JVM,\n&gt; so\n&gt; &gt; that all methods can be easily tested and receive\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; benefits of test driven development, while keeping\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; tests tightly linked to the methods they are\n&gt; testing.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Cheers,\n&gt; &gt; - Ole\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- C�(c)dric Beust �&quot; &lt;cbeust@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; On 2/20/07, Ole Ersoy &lt;ole_ersoy@...&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Or do it in reverse.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Declare private methods on the Class, and have\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; builder create the ClassHelper.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m a bit confused where this discussion is\n&gt; going.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If my class needs helper methods that it will be\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; only one using, I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; make them private on that same class (ideally,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; static private if they\n&gt; &gt; &gt; don&#39;t modify any state).\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Only if these helper methods can be useful to\n&gt; other\n&gt; &gt; &gt; classes would I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; consider extracting them in a separate Helper\n&gt; class.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --\n&gt; &gt; &gt; C�dric\n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://testng.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n__________________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; Never miss an email again!\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
