I&#39;m really<br/>\nlooking for simple insight from people who have been where I am now,<br/>\nlinks to articles on the web and so forth....<br/>\n<br/>\nI like, the rest off you, have heard great things about unit testing.<br/>\n I believe a lot of it.  I want to start writing unit tests for my<br/>\ncode and in general improve my development practices.   So I downloaded<br/>\nJUnit, and read through some articles and examples.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey are all too trivial.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am struggling as to how I can write unit tests for &quot;real code&quot;.   <br/>\nMost of the examples I see are testing objects that are VERY general<br/>\n(lists, or other simple container classes, a calculator, etc..).   <br/>\nBut my &quot;real classes&quot; are written for my &quot;real application&quot; and as<br/>\nsuch there is an entire environment that is created as they work<br/>\ntogether.  Testing the classes in isolation seems next to impossible.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome people will be quick to jump in and say that this must be a<br/>\nfundamental problem with my design.. my classes shouldn&#39;t be so<br/>\ndependent on each other, or something similar.    In some (trivial)<br/>\ncases it is possible to write stand alone classes, and they are<br/>\nfairly easy to test in isolation.  But a complex application needs<br/>\nall sorts of classes that bind trivial bits together... and these<br/>\nclasses must rely on the very classes that they are causing to work<br/>\ntogether.<br/>\n<br/>\nI find that it is these classes that are difficult to<br/>\ncompartmentalize where most of my bugs tend to show up anyway, but of<br/>\ncourse not always.   How do you unit test such beasts?<br/>\n<br/>\nSo far in all my attempts to get started at this I find that the test<br/>\ncode itself becomes very complex - not as complex as my application,<br/>\nbut enough that the time I would end up writing and debugging the<br/>\ntest seems completely unreasonable.   I would love to have the<br/>\nfinished tests, but I simply can&#39;t see how I could justify writing<br/>\nthem, as it would more than double my design and coding development<br/>\ntime.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the end I would almost end up with an &quot;automated user&quot;, and of<br/>\ncourse that is a tad extreme and prone to it&#39;s own sorts of errors<br/>\nand assumptions.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve told co-workers about what I have read about unit testing,<br/>\ntesting frameworks etc.  None of my co-workers do unit tests, and ll<br/>\nof them have the same attitude.  Unit testing is too<br/>\ncomplex/difficult to use when making real complete programs.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I&#39;m asking... Who else has been down this path?  How do I get past<br/>\nthis point?   Am I making sense or have I just gotten something<br/>\ncompletely wrong? Or is this unit testing just a passing fad that is<br/>\nreally nothing more than a bunch of hype?</div>",
