You are<br/>\n&gt; talking about aspects in a system, which is exactly my point.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, the aspectual Java papers are on my list of things to read very, very<br/>\nsoon (i.e., I&#39;m carrying them around in my bag every day), but unfortunately<br/>\nI&#39;ve not gotten around to reading them. So I probably don&#39;t really understand<br/>\nwhat you mean by &quot;aspectual&quot; in this case.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, from having looked at examples of Aspect-J, particularly the<br/>\nlogging one, I can say that what I do in terms of making objects more<br/>\ntestable is not the same, because it&#39;s not something you implement the<br/>\nsame way across lots of objects (the way logging the parameters to a<br/>\nmethod would be).<br/>\n<br/>\nBasically, I change not just the code itself, but even the design of<br/>\nthe code in order to make it easier to test. I do things like changing<br/>\nfrom static factory methods in individual classes to non-static factory<br/>\nmethods in a centralized factory object so that I can use a different<br/>\nimplemenation of that factory when I do unit testing. I don&#39;t really see<br/>\nhow that&#39;s an aspectual thing, except in the most vague and general sense.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis ability to write your code differently so that you can test things<br/>\nmore easily (or at all, sometimes!) is to my mind one of the most<br/>\npowerful aspects of having the same person writing tests and code at the<br/>\nsame time, rather than testing after the code is done.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; You say it&#39;s easier or your preference to represent testability as<br/>\n&gt; addtional mixed in methods here and there in the objects. I don&#39;t like<br/>\n&gt; that. But it seems like it&#39;s a matter of taste.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s only one of the strategies I&#39;ll use to make an object more testable.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wonder if someone&#39;s already written up a set of design patterns for typical<br/>\nproblems and solutions in XP-style testing.<br/>\n<br/>\ncjs<br/>\n-- <br/>\nCurt Sampson  &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cjs@...\">cjs@...</a>&gt;   +81 90 7737 2974   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.netbsd.org\">http://www.netbsd.org</a><br/>\n    Don&#39;t you know, in this new Dark Age, we&#39;re all light.  --XTC</div>",
