The<br/>\nchallenge is that some runners (Eclipse, for example) really want<br/>\nnames of all the tests you&#39;re going to run before you run them.  One<br/>\ncurrent possibility is to actually run the tests during the<br/>\ngetChildren phase, and then just report the results during the<br/>\nrunChild phase.  That likely delays any output until all tests have<br/>\nrun.  Will that work for you?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe alternative is an extended listener framework.  Which test runner<br/>\nare you using?<br/>\n<br/>\n   David Saff<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Fri, Jun 17, 2011 at 8:43 AM, huntchrisalias &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:huntchr@...\">huntchr@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Hi there,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m writing a custom test runner that is not easily able to determine how many tests will be executed in advance.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The runner extends ParentRunner and its getChildren method is called prior to tests being executed via runChild. Each test is also described via describeChild.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; During runChild execution, if I create child descriptions of each child as each unforeseeable test occurs, then I get &quot;unrooted&quot; output.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My actual use-case is that I have a test runner executing a series of tests within an html file. I would have to parse the html and its associated JavaScript to determine how many tests will be run. This would be tricky.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Is there a recommended means of reporting the results of tests that are not determinable in advance?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Kind regards,<br/>\n&gt; Christopher<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
