If we go with using an annotation, we would have an annotation<br/>\n&gt; provided with JUnit that you could use. Does that change your view?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That would indeed reduce the difference between the two aproaches. The<br/>\ndifference I still see is that the annotation is more general.  You can use<br/>\nit at other places in the API if needed.   This is good if you think it<br/>\nwould be usefull in multiple place in the API.  However, if it is supported<br/>\nin only one place, it might raise useless questions when<br/>\nimplementing/extending other interfaces.  The implementer might ask himself<br/>\nif he should write thread safe code with that annotation or if it doesn&#39;t<br/>\nmather for this interface.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther differences are that the annotation is less intrusive than the taging<br/>\ninterface that is a little bit old school.<br/>\n<br/>\nGiven that, I&#39;m now thinking that annotation is a good idea, but a bigger<br/>\nwork.  I think for the annotation you should review the documention of the<br/>\nentire API to document where it applies.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Note also that it is usually a bad idea to call a &quot;Listener&quot; while holding<br/>\n&gt; &gt; a lock. So the ThreadSafe listener should be strongly recommended and the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; non thread safe version should be deprecated.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m not sure I agree (but I&#39;m very interested in others thoughts). JUnit is<br/>\n&gt; used by all types of users, from novice to advanced. It is often the first<br/>\n&gt; and only third-party library a novice user uses. Novice users are highly<br/>\n&gt; likely to not handle thread-safety issues. Thread-safety issues in a<br/>\n&gt; listener could lead to all sorts of confusing results. I think we need to<br/>\n&gt; make it easy for novice users to add listeners without worrying about<br/>\n&gt; thread-safety issues, and possible for advanced users to have thread-safe<br/>\n&gt; listeners.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Is the RunListener for novice ;-)<br/>\nAnyway, even non novice might have issues to implement a thread safe<br/>\nclass.  So I understand your concern.  But anyway, here also, you will need<br/>\nto document very well the locking aproach.<br/>\n<br/>\nGilles<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
