Automated test cases can be re-run in a fraction of the time<br/>\nrequired to repeat the manual testing.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn addition, after a functional change, the only test cases to build<br/>\nare tests for the new functionality or maintenance against tests which<br/>\nwork against functionality that has been modified. Doing that<br/>\nmaintenance, and then running all tests, is faster and more reliable<br/>\nthan repeating all testing (new and old) manually. The effect is<br/>\ncumulative.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps!<br/>\n<br/>\n-jn-<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Wed, Mar 26, 2008 at 2:36 AM, Sateesh<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sateeshkumar.soundarapandian@...\">sateeshkumar.soundarapandian@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi,<br/>\n&gt;  In our application, we planned to use JUnit. but our application is<br/>\n&gt;  like fetching, inserting, updating data in the databases. there is no<br/>\n&gt;  domain bussiness logics involved. that is there will be no<br/>\n&gt;  calculations etc., We feel that for our application testing could be<br/>\n&gt;  done manually. Even if we try with JUnit, the time taken for test case<br/>\n&gt;  preparation is almost equal to the time taken to implement the<br/>\n&gt;  functionality.
