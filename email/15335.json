I work hardly at all<br/>\n&gt; with Microsoft APIs, but in the Java world, the open source stuff tends<br/>\n&gt; to be as well or better documented than the proprietary stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Interestingly, I can&#39;t say that I work with a lot of closed-source Java<br/>\nAPI&#39;s, so I can&#39;t comment on that either. However, I can say that I have<br/>\nseen open-source Java API&#39;s that are excellent and just about as many that<br/>\nare horrendous, hence my disputing your argument that &quot;open source API&#39;s are<br/>\nusually better than closed source ones&quot;. I&#39;m not saying one is better than<br/>\nthe other, just that the quality of API&#39;s seems to have nothing to do with<br/>\nwhether these API&#39;s are open or closed source.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for Microsoft, I was simply pointing out that they are excellent at<br/>\nmaintaining backward compatibility for API&#39;s. You can literally run in 2005<br/>\nprograms that were written in 1995.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSure there&#39;s a lot of poorly documented, poorly written open source<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; software,<br/>\n&gt; but this tends to sink to the bottom and fall out of use pretty quickly.<br/>\n&gt; The libraries people actually use are much better documented than their<br/>\n&gt; proprietary equivalents. (Probably effect rather than cause, but either<br/>\n&gt; way...) I suspect it also matters that one of the easiest ways for<br/>\n&gt; someone to contribute to a project is to start writing some<br/>\n&gt; documentation patches. This means open source documentation tends to<br/>\n&gt; improve with time. Proprietary documentation rarely does.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That I disagree with.<br/>\n<br/>\nPopularity is what brings quality in documentation, and it works for closed<br/>\nand open source alike. If a closed source software becomes popular and<br/>\ngenerates a big community, the documentation will follow. It&#39;s no different<br/>\nthan the open source world.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut we should probably stop this discussion since it&#39;s clearly off-topic for<br/>\nthis list.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nCédric<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
