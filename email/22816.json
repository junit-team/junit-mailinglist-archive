I am running the tests via a webservice which calls an EJB which calls JUnitCore.run(Class[])(I have also tried JUnitCore.run(Runner)).  I put a log statement at the end of the BeforeClass method and added a listener to the core to log when a test starts to figure this out.  Also, is there a way to guarentee that all the tests in a class run in the same context because we are having problems with the current approach that we are getting EJB cross-pollution between the tests.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny help is greatly appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\nMatt</div>",
