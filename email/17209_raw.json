Extracting data \nfrom a file consists of two operations:\n\n1. Loading file contents into memory, usually as lines of text.\n2. Parsing the lines of text while in memory.\n\nPart #1 is a perfect candidate for a reusable library. In Ruby, you \nsimply say file.readlines(), for example. There&#39;s no reason to \nreimplement this the way we do in Java. (Does Java 5 have a built-in \nlibrary method for loading a text file yet?!)\n\nPart #2 is what&#39;s specific to your application, because it depends on \nhow you formatted the text when you saved it. I could see that being a \nprivate method, perhaps, that takes a List of lines and parses them.\n\nSo it might be that the only reason the &quot;loading&quot; feature is not \nreusable is that Java hasn&#39;t made the reusable part reusable!\n-- \nJ.
