But If i have to test for the coverage using\njprobe , i need to mention the application&#39;s name as\nan argument for the coverage task of junit. \n\nTo solve this problem, I made a TestSuite called\nAllTests.java and added in all the suites. \nFor the name of the application, I passed\njunit.textui.TestRunner and I passed AllTests as its\nargument.\n\nBut when I try running the coverage task,\njplauncher.exe after all my tests execute because of\nthe failures and errors thrown on the output screen by\njunit. Is there a command line option to suppress\njunit from printing on the command line?\n\nThanks,\nSuganya Subramanian\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
