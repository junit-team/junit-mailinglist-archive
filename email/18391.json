[:)]<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond one: If you use XML just as a example and the real &quot;Graph<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory</a>&gt;  &quot; objects is of other king,<br/>\nthan I think in parsers - well, let me explain:<br/>\nYou have a &quot;Graph&quot; of objects, this mean that you have one object<br/>\nconnected in other and this object connected in other and so on.<br/>\nProbably you need access some object in this &quot;Graph&quot;; when is needed<br/>\naccess this object you will have chance to test it . A example is more<br/>\nexplanatory:<br/>\n<br/>\nSuppose I will access a budget object; a real budget will have a lot of<br/>\nobjects connected to it, this is a &quot;Graph&quot;. Make a test to know if the<br/>\nroot object is correct, check yours attributes and no more. Right now I<br/>\ndon&#39;t care about others objects in this &quot;Graph&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nSuppose now that I need access some product inside of the list product.<br/>\nThis will use the first code - a kind of service; I know that I have the<br/>\ncorrect budget, now I need know if this budget have the correct first<br/>\nproduct - now I need access it. I will make a test to know if this<br/>\nproduct is correct.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn this explanation I make unitary test step-by-step, walking on the<br/>\n&quot;Graph&quot; when needed.<br/>\n<br/>\nI expected that you have understood what I want tell. My paper will be<br/>\nmore clear.  [;)]  Sorry about my poor English.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
