This is ideal if your J2EE project is using Local EJBs.\nEvery change in the test code needs redeployment but you need to live with\nthis.\nIf #2. Use simple Junit, &#39;as&#39; a TestCase to do a lookup and be a EJB\nclient.  You cannot do this if you are testing a Local EJBs.\n\nTo comment on\n&#39;It is not possible to unit test your non-EJB web-application\ncomponents.&#39;...\n...Like what ..?\nI assume it is not JSP or Servlet you want to Unit test.  Then it could be\nMDBs which you can test the same way as EJBs as explained above.  You can\nuse either of these again test your &#39;other&#39; j2ee components provide they\nhave a proper interface.\n\nPlease be specific on what component you want to test...\n\n~JAK\nOn 4/17/06, swetha yalamanchili &lt;sb_syalamanchili@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;  hi Rain,\n&gt;\n&gt;   junit works with j2ee projects with the help of cactus or junitee.\n&gt;   does junit work with j2ee applications independently with out help of\n&gt; any other tools?\n&gt;   i have a webapplication project which has its own application server .\n&gt;   does junit work with server side applications.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   While implementing JUnit with a J2EE application we shall face problems\n&gt; while running client-side applications.\n&gt;    JUnit comes with three Test Runners: an AWT app, a Swing app, and a\n&gt; text-based command-line app. Neither are they suitable for running in an\n&gt; app-server environment nor do they output the HTML.\n&gt;   There is no reason why we cannot use the standard Test Runners if we\n&gt; write our tests as external clients to our app server. But we can think of\n&gt; three good reasons why this is undesirable:\n&gt;\n&gt;    It is necessary to set up all the client JNDI properties in the test\n&gt; cases, making it a pain to run against several different test servers.\n&gt;    If your production clients are servlets running inside the app server,\n&gt; your tests could be affected by being run in a different execution\n&gt; environment.\n&gt;    It is not possible to unit test your non-EJB web-application\n&gt; components.\n&gt;   thank u\n&gt;   swetha\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;J.
