There are no instances in which TDD is impossible.\n&gt; &gt; 2. There are no instances in which TDD is not advantageous.\n&gt; &gt; 3. The impediments to TDD are human, not technical.\n&gt; &gt; 4. The alternative to TDD is code that is not repeatably testable.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Therefore I consider TDD to be a minimum professional standard.\n&gt; &gt; Developers who do not use TDD fall below that standard.\n&gt;\n&gt; I can&#39;t quite agree with that, but I would be thrilled to wake up one\n&gt; morning to find out that it&#39;s true. If that became /the/ minimum\n&gt; professional standard (whatever that would mean), I wouldn&#39;t complain.\n\nI&#39;m not quite sure I know what you are disagreeing and agreeing with.\n\n----\nRobert C.
