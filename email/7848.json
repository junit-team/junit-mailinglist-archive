Okay fine, but<br/>\nI was wondering how people solve/resolve the following type of dependency.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf I have three classes A, B and C where A delegates some functionality to B<br/>\nwhich delegates to C.  During my implementation and unit testing I write<br/>\ntests for C then implement the desired functionality in C.  I then repeat<br/>\nthe process for B and A, okay fine.  But now I have an implied unit test<br/>\ndependency don&#39;t I?  So when running my tests as a suite I really want my<br/>\ntest cases to run in the order C, B, A and never any other order because if<br/>\nthe defect is in C then I want to know about it from C and not from A or B.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI am currently implementing a small library that does a lot of this style of<br/>\ndelegation, and being reasonably new to JUnit I wondered how other people<br/>\nwork round this issue especially since those nice Eclipse people provide a<br/>\nhelpful &quot;run all tests in a package option&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks inadnavce<br/>\n<br/>\nJonathan</div>",
