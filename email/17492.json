For example, when I would writing a<br/>\nDAO, I would begin with a concrete class and basic tests, just to get<br/>\nup and running.  This would usually not last long, as I found the<br/>\nenvironment pushed me to develop in the idiomatic Spring way, by using<br/>\nan interface and DI.  For a common case like a DAO, I found this<br/>\npattern recurring so often that I would often skip the concrete class<br/>\nand go right to the interface with the real implementation and<br/>\ntest-friendly implementation.<br/>\n<br/>\nWas this violating &quot;simplest thing&quot; ?  Even if we follow YAGNI or any<br/>\nother agile mantra,  doesn&#39;t mean the experienced developer should<br/>\nturn their brain off.  When you see the &quot;simplest thing&quot; in a specific<br/>\ncontext get refactored into something more complex many times over, it<br/>\nonly makes sense to recognize that and go right to the more complex<br/>\ncase -- in that context.  Maybe the &quot;simplest thing&quot; was really too<br/>\nsimple, as it wasn&#39;t testable enough or flexible enough or it was<br/>\nsimply not consistent with the rest of the design.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, even when I was in interface-happy JavaLand, many<br/>\ntimes the simplest thing would prove to be just fine - particularly if<br/>\nit was a simple utility class or some limited business model that<br/>\ndidn&#39;t need additional abstraction.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo its not a choice between interfaces and concrete, or writing the<br/>\nsimplest thing or the testable thing.  Its using your experience and<br/>\nwisdom to decide what is best for the specific case and context - some<br/>\ntimes that means starting with a concrete POJO, at other times it<br/>\nmeans going right to an interface with some DI.  If its some brand new<br/>\nsituation or domain where you have very little experience, then you<br/>\ncan fall back on KISS or YAGNI or whatever practice helps you through<br/>\nit, until you have the experience to see what really constitutes the<br/>\n&quot;simplest thing&quot; to begin with.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Rob<br/>\n-- <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.robsanheim.com\">http://www.robsanheim.com</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.seekingalpha.com\">http://www.seekingalpha.com</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ajaxian.com\">http://www.ajaxian.com</a> </span></blockquote></div>",
