In my experience, TDD makes me go\n&gt;  &gt; faster on average. If Cedric allows this to be true, then how does he\n&gt;  &gt; propose I identify those cases where TDD would not make me go faster?\n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s never really. In my experience, any task that&#39;s a bit more complex\n&gt; than, say, a Money or a Bowling example, is probably something you should\n&gt; think twice before you TDD.\n\nSo I think you mean that TDD never makes me go faster? But my \nobservation is that TDD almost always makes me go faster. I have \nrewritten months of code in weeks with TDD.\n\n&gt; Also, knowing the final goal is different from knowing the API you will need\n&gt; to reach that goal, so then again, I would probably think hard and make sure\n&gt; that going TDD is not going to make me lose.\n\nI find that interesting. Do you believe that when I practise TDD that I \ndo not think? Do you believe that when I practise TDD that I think less \nthan when I didn&#39;t? In some ways, TDD is like doodling: it helps me work \nthrough what I&#39;m thinking about.\n\n&gt; &gt; Not to be glib, but if I knew when that would happen, I would have a\n&gt; &gt; mansion on Grand Cayman already.\n&gt; \n&gt; Avoid the East Side of the island, it&#39;s still recovering from Ivan.\n&gt; Georgetown is pretty, though.\n\nSomeday... someday...\n-- \nJ.
