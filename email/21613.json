It does  sound a little scary -- at some point you get into &quot;why  <br/>\nnot roll my own&quot; territory, which is a dangerous way to be thinking!<br/>\n<br/>\nI remember know that I did look at using Runner before but it wasn&#39;t  <br/>\nclear how to get back into the core functionality once I&#39;d implemented  <br/>\nmy own. I was looking at BlockJUnit4ClassRunner which sounds like its  <br/>\nnot what I want. Its still looking pretty complex to me even after  <br/>\nlooking at the SuiteRunner code but maybe I&#39;m just having a slow brain  <br/>\nday. But it doesn&#39;t look like I can use inheirit from Suite or Parent  <br/>\nRunner for example because they both are looking for a class.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;A runner that creates a suite from a set of names should be  <br/>\nstraightforward given you can compute the number of tests beforehand,  <br/>\neg. because the class can already be loaded or you know the names of  <br/>\ntest methods per class from some other source.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI think one question is the key make or break though -- does JUnit  <br/>\nexpect to traverse the entire test tree before running any tests? The  <br/>\nreason I ask is because the above is not quite true -- I don&#39;t  <br/>\nactually know the names of the test methods at runtime, or at lest I&#39;d  <br/>\nlike to obtain them from the generated classes. To simplify down to  <br/>\nbrass tasks, what I basically need to do is use JUnit exactly the same  <br/>\nway, except to substitute just one set of nodes in the test traversal  <br/>\ntree -- for class discovery to load the classes by name. But the trick  <br/>\nof course is that needs to be deferred until test run-time.<br/>\n<br/>\nthanks,<br/>\n<br/>\nMiles<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On May 14, 2009, at 6:10 AM, David Saff wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Miles,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I think that we ran into a real expectation mismatch when we called<br/>\n&gt; one of the key extension classes in JUnit 4 &quot;Runner&quot;. &quot;Write your own<br/>\n&gt; Runner&quot; makes it sound as if you&#39;re being asked to rewrite something<br/>\n&gt; like Eclipse&#39;s entire launching infrastructure, when, in truth, it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; probably on the same level of complexity as a TestNG factory.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; That said, you do need to have committed to the names and total number<br/>\n&gt; of tests you&#39;re going to run before any test case is run.

I need to execute an  <br/>\n&gt; arbitrary<br/>\n&gt; &gt; set of test methods (using @test annotations) against a known --  <br/>\n&gt; but not yet<br/>\n&gt; &gt; existent at JUnit launch time -- set of classes. Those classes are  <br/>\n&gt; generated<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and compiled in a previous test case within same session and then  <br/>\n&gt; need to be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; loaded dynamically. Ideally, I would present the name of classes  <br/>\n&gt; as Strings;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I understand that JUnit has a way to do this dynamically for  <br/>\n&gt; method names<br/>\n&gt; &gt; but I can&#39;t find a similar feature for class names -- everything  <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve tried<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ends up forcing me to have an explicit compiled reference at test  <br/>\n&gt; harness<br/>\n&gt; &gt; launch time.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; And of course I&#39;d really like not to have to write my own runner<br/>\n&gt; &gt; implementation. ;) In TestNG I can do this with factories but our  <br/>\n&gt; build<br/>\n&gt; &gt; environment currently only supports JUnit.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Miles<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; On Wed, May 13, 2009 at 4:23 AM, Johannes Link  <br/>\n&gt; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jl@...\">jl@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I guess your own runner implementation to use with @RunWith could  <br/>\n&gt; do the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; trick.
