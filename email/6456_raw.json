Buy my book!&quot;\n\n\n Someone sa=\r\nying they&#39;re too \n&gt; busy to write an article right now is perfectly good re=\r\nason - no-\none \n&gt; here has to answer your questions in your timeframe.\n\n\nI =\r\nthink if a person jumps into a discussion and says, &quot;Your approach \nsucks. =\r\n Buy my book!&quot; they should at least explain why.  That might \nactually be h=\r\nelpful to others.\n\n\n&gt; Yet, I haven&#39;t \n&gt; seen any explanation as to what is =\r\ninferior in your approach - \n&gt; asserting it&#39;s inferior does not make it so.=\r\n\n\n\nI couldn&#39;t agree more.\n\n\n&gt; I also found the waving \n&gt; of the moderator s=\r\ntick distasteful; it&#39;s far too early for that.\n&gt; \n&gt; A suggestion - stop pos=\r\nting for 24 hours on this thread, then come \n&gt; back to it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Bill de h=\r\n=D3ra\n\n\nWhoops, too late for that!  Heheh.\n\nFor the record, I never said I =\r\ndisagreed with what Dave and J. B. are \nadvocating.  I never said I didn&#39;t =\r\nlike them personally, either.  \nIt&#39;s the delivery of their message I find c=\r\nurious.  It seems more \ngeared toward self-interest than equitable exchange=\r\n or mutual benefit.\n\nMike\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
