I&#39;m merely<br/>\n&gt; saying that without system context, it might or might not make sense for<br/>\n&gt; this class to defend itself against a negative score. It&#39;s possible that<br/>\n&gt; in the system in which it will live full time, that situation is never<br/>\n&gt; going to happen, in which case, someone /else/ (like the module that<br/>\n&gt; invokes this class) should check for such invalid data.<br/>\n<br/>\ntrue, and I wouldn&#39;t check like this uniformly. but I think it is<br/>\nimportant to distinquish between &quot;shoudn&#39;t&quot; and &quot;can&#39;t&quot; when making<br/>\nthe decision. there&#39;s also the question that as system evolves might<br/>\nthere be new callers?<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; In the hands of a thoughtful practitioner, I believe Agitator to be a<br/>\n&gt; great thing. I am concerned that less-thoughtful practitioners will use<br/>\n&gt; Agitator as an excuse not to write tests. I&#39;ve heard it too many times<br/>\n&gt; already. I should make it clear: that&#39;s not Agitator&#39;s fault. It&#39;s just<br/>\n&gt; a statement about the product and what it does. Any product, of course,<br/>\n&gt; can be abused.<br/>\n<br/>\nthe question of the &quot;less-thoughtful&quot; is something I&#39;ve wrestled with<br/>\na few times while at Agitar. (the Management Dashboard is ripe for<br/>\nabuse in the wrong environment.) but what I&#39;ve always settled on is<br/>\nthat we need to focus on making the tools as useful as possible for<br/>\nthose with good intent, and it is better to offer those people<br/>\nsomething a solution rather than to deny it because of how it might be<br/>\nabused.<br/>\n<br/>\nJtf<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.developertesting.com/\">http://www.developertesting.com/</a> </span></blockquote></div>",
