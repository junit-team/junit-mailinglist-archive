    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1918579357\">Well, we had similar problems while I was working with the IBM On-Demand<br/>\nServer team. I was brought in to teach their test group there how to<br/>\nautomate Java API testing. This was before tools like Junit were mature<br/>\nenough to handle the needs of that group, so I designed and helped them<br/>\nwrite a tool that would.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe On-Demand Server consisted in part of a applet based &quot;web desktop&quot; and<br/>\nan API/framework for extending it. They supported multiple platform<br/>\narchitectures (Wintel, AIX, Solaris, Linux)  and two main browsers (IE on<br/>\nWintel, Netscape on everything). Part of the toolset which was constructed<br/>\nallowed them to run tests directly in the browser. This accomplished two<br/>\nthings: 1) It allowed them to test against the various supported browser<br/>\nVMs directly, and 2) It allowed them to remotely control<br/>\nregression/integration testing against a central automated build.<br/>\n<br/>\nI carried that tool into another test team at IBM for a similar mentoring<br/>\nrole. By then, however, the open source test tools had really come into<br/>\ntheir own and the need to do browser based testing had largely diminished,<br/>\nso I started to deprecate my tool there in favor of Junit in order to<br/>\nreduce tool maintenance costs.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn any case, I&#39;m very familiar with the problems involved and I&#39;ve taken<br/>\napart Junit on multiple occasions. It looks like it should be possible to<br/>\ncreate a TestRunner that can run as an applet. In principle, it&#39;s no<br/>\ndifferent that the TextUI or SwingUI front-ends that already exist- Junit<br/>\nis well modularized in this respect. In practice, you have to work around<br/>\nrestrictions with the classloader and trust, which, although tricky, are<br/>\nnot insurmountable.<br/>\n<br/>\nA next step from there is to get the tests to run in browser VMs without<br/>\nhuman intervention. This is much more tricky, but is possible and I&#39;ve<br/>\nplayed with the idea some. Most browsers have an (undocumented) mechanism<br/>\nwhereby you can access their virtual machine without actually loading the<br/>\nbrowser.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would certainly be interested in discussing your situation in detail. We<br/>\nmay even be able to get someone out to Pheonix if desired.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Thu, 27 Sep 2001, Jamie Nettles wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Unfortunately the applet is a large legacy applet (over a megabyte).  We<br/>\n&gt; have done what you suggest and pulled most of the guts out so that we can<br/>\n&gt; exercise them in junit.  However, we have found that typically a large<br/>\n&gt; number of bugs involve IE, Netscape, signing issues, or applet parameter<br/>\n&gt; issues.  So your comment about automating the applet testing is extremely<br/>\n&gt; interesting to me.  Can you elaborate?  Your comment about extending<br/>\n&gt; TestRunner to test applets is likewise very interesting.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Eric Vought [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:evought@...\">evought@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Thursday, September 27, 2001 7:38 AM<br/>\n&gt; &gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [junit] Testing Applets<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; On Wed, 26 Sep 2001, Jamie Nettles wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I want to test an applet or pieces of an applet using jUnit.  Any<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; suggestions?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Well, the first thing to suggest is that its no different<br/>\n&gt; &gt; from testing any<br/>\n&gt; &gt; other application (as Bob Koss points out). To expand on<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that, the thing<br/>\n&gt; &gt; which makes an application is just its main method. Everything else is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; just a collection of objects and classes which can be unit tested.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Similarly, what makes an applet an applet is just the fact<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that you have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; an Applet implementation which ties all the rest of your<br/>\n&gt; &gt; classes together<br/>\n&gt; &gt; into a working whole. The rest is just objects and classes<br/>\n&gt; &gt; which you can<br/>\n&gt; &gt; easily test.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; It is relatively straight forward to write an applet in such<br/>\n&gt; &gt; a way that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; you can actually run it either as an applet or standalone.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; You do that by<br/>\n&gt; &gt; separating all of the function of the applet into other<br/>\n&gt; &gt; classes which are<br/>\n&gt; &gt; simply delegated to by a very thin Applet implementation.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Even your main<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Panel can be separated out easily. You can then instantiate that Panel<br/>\n&gt; &gt; either inside the Applet or inside a Frame created from your<br/>\n&gt; &gt; application.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; If your applet runs in its own Frame, this is even easier.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; This type of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; modularization will also make the code much easier to unit test.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; You don&#39;t, therefore, need to run your unit tests in a web<br/>\n&gt; &gt; browser. They<br/>\n&gt; &gt; are run standalone from one of the junit testrunners, just like with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; everything else. You can change security settings around testcases to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; simulate the default restrictions of a browser. It *is* possible to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; automate testing of applets running in browsers for purposes of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; portability testing, for instance, but this is non-trivial<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and should be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; avoided unless/until really necessary. (It&#39;s really<br/>\n&gt; &gt; functional testing,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; not unit testing)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; [Aside: Has anyone thought about creating an Applet based<br/>\n&gt; &gt; TestRunner? This<br/>\n&gt; &gt; would make it significantly easier for folks (like us) that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; do portability<br/>\n&gt; &gt; testing across a gagillion VMs. When I did some of this sort<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of work for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; IBM (Orion/On Demand Server), we had to write the browser based test<br/>\n&gt; &gt; automation pretty much from scratch and it was not fun to get<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it to run in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the various browser targets. Changes in the security API and better<br/>\n&gt; &gt; conformance since then plus the very modular nature of junit<br/>\n&gt; &gt; should make<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it *almost* trivial now.
