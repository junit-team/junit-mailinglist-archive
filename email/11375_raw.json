I&#39;m stuck with\n&gt;  &gt;=A0=A0 it.\n&gt;\n&gt;  I&#39;ve been thinking for a while that th=\r\nis is a serious problem in JUnit\n&gt;  (and most unit testing frameworks), bec=\r\nause it&#39;s been such an annoyance\n&gt;  for so many people. Let&#39;s face it; a lo=\r\nt of groups of tests do have\n&gt;  known dependencies between tests such that =\r\nif test A fails, we know that\n&gt;  the output of tests B, C and D are uninter=\r\nesting. Yet we end up running\n&gt;  B, C and D anyway, and then searching thro=\r\nugh all the error output for\n&gt;  the failure that we know is the &quot;real&quot; one,=\r\n ignoring all the others as\n&gt;  spurious.\n\nWith all due respect, I believe t=\r\nhat is a code smell.  It seems to say to me \nthat there is something not ri=\r\nght about the design of the code being tested, \nor perhaps even more elusiv=\r\ne, something is wrong with how the tests are \nwritten.  When I find these t=\r\nypes of dependencies I inevitably rethink how I \nhave written my tests.  Ha=\r\nve I coded in the dependencies or are they really \nthere.  More times than =\r\nnot I have coded in the dependencies -- and therefore \nI can remove them.  =\r\nFurther, I would argue that I _NEED_ to remove them.  \nNow, maybe I am old-=\r\nfashioned but I believe tests (at least at the \nunit/programmer level) ough=\r\nt to be as autonomous as possible.\n\n-- \nJason Rogers\n117 N.
