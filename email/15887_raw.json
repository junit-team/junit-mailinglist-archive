Apologize me is my last e-mail\nwasn&#39;t clear enough, but what I was trying to tell\nthat i believe JUnit uses the &quot;main&quot; method with parts\nmy J2ME codes, so the tests throws some Errors, like\nwhen i try to capture a resource as stream. When i use\nthe code, outside JUnit, it works and nothing happens.\n \n&gt; Also, be aware that there is no reflection in\n&gt; JavaME, so you build your test\n&gt; suites differently in J2MEUnit than you do with\n&gt; JUnit.\n\nHow I build? I&#39;m really having some problems with J2ME\nand JUnit...\n\n&gt; --\n&gt; Cedric\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On 1/24/06, Brunno Silva &lt;brunno.silva@...&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Dear list-members,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I had some problems when I started to use JUnit, a\n&gt; &gt; week ago. After some research, I figure out that\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; problem was the J2ME sandbox. I created my first\n&gt; test\n&gt; &gt; case to test a simple class used by a MIDlet, and\n&gt; it\n&gt; &gt; didn&#39;t work because it&#39;s not possible to do\n&gt; something\n&gt; &gt; like that:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; public static void main (String args[])\n&gt; &gt; {\n&gt; &gt;        The J2ME code...\n&gt; &gt; }\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; And i think that what the framework do, right?\n&gt; Well,\n&gt; &gt; as I said before, it&#39;s impossible to do that\n&gt; because\n&gt; &gt; of the J2ME sandbox. I looked for some kind of\n&gt; recipe\n&gt; &gt; in the JUnit Recipes book, but I didn&#39;t find\n&gt; anything\n&gt; &gt; about that or about other kinds of sandbox tests\n&gt; &gt; (Indeed, i didn&#39;t looked in J2EE chapters, maybe\n&gt; &gt; there&#39;s something about test a servlet, but I&#39;m\n&gt; not so\n&gt; &gt; sure if it also has a sandbox concept). So, do you\n&gt; &gt; know a solution to my problem?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Brunno Silva\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; Fa�a liga��es para outros computadores com o novo\n&gt; Yahoo!
