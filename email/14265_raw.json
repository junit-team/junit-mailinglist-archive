The change was not intentional. I am interested in arguments for making them public, though.\n&gt; \n\nLooking at them, what they do is so trivial I would prefer them not to \nbe public, solely on the grounds of simplifying the API. Every method \nthat can be eliminated is one less thing to document, one less thing to \nexplain, one less thing to stumble over when you&#39;re looking for \nsomething else.\n\nI suspect them becoming public had something to do with the relationship \nbetween the old junit.framework.Assert and the new org.junit.Assert \nclasses. (The former now extends the latter.) I don&#39;t know why there are \ntwo classes here. They don&#39;t appear to be substantially different. Could \nwe just get rid of the new one. Would anything break? Hmm, looking at I \nwas able to remove org.junit.framework.Assert fairly easily. I had to do \na search for the static imports and replace them with \njunit.framework.Assert. I had to make junit.framework.Assert extend \nObject like it used to. Finally I had to fix one class where \norg.junit.Assert was referenced by its fully package qualified name. \nNothing broke that wasn&#39;t broken before, and a couple of tests that were \npreviously broken started passing.\n\nSo whatever you do with failSame, etc. I recommend removing \norg.junit.framework.Assert.\n\n-- \n﻿Elliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nXML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim\n\n",
