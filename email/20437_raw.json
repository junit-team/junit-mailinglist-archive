(It appears to me that you may need to have a cust=\r\nom\n&gt; runner that&#39;s similar to Parameterized)\n&gt; \n&gt; Furthermore, suppose I ha=\r\nve a subclass of this test, which defines a\n&gt; second parameter, which, unli=\r\nke the first, is a required parameter\n&gt; (ie. I can choose to have my list o=\r\nf parameters as either two values\n&gt; or a single, which would assume the usa=\r\nge of a default value).  How\n&gt; would I go about doing that?  (Would I need =\r\nto use a different runner?)\n&gt; \n&gt; How would I generalize this to any number =\r\nof parameters (required and\n&gt; optional)?\n&gt; \n\nWhat Parameterized runner does=\r\n it takes a Collection that returns by\n@Parameterized method run over it, f=\r\nor each Object[] calls constructor\nof your class with supplied variables (t=\r\nhat initialize data-members\nthat will be used by your test method) and call=\r\ns test method. The\nnaive way to handle it is to define couple of constructo=\r\nr that will\ncall one to another and supplying default values. For each entr=\r\ny in\nCollecion appropriate constructor will be called. It is nice, but\nunfo=\r\nrtunately is not working. It happens that Parameterized runner\nenforce you =\r\nto have only one constructor. Under these circumstances\nyour question is eq=\r\nuivalent how can you supplied default values to the\nattribute in the functi=\r\non (constructor in your case). In Java there is\nno way to do it (other then=\r\n overloading). So there is no way out for\nnow, at least as far as I know.\n\n=\r\n&gt; Finally, what if I wanted my parameterized tests to be named via some\n&gt; n=\r\naming function (instead of serially numbered like Parameterized)?\n&gt;\n\nParame=\r\nterized runner is written is such a way that there is no easy to\nextend it =\r\nin order to achieve this. The main obstacle is that you\ncan&#39;t override &quot;new=\r\n TestClassRunnerForParameters(...)&quot; in private\nstatic runners method, so yo=\r\nu actually hast to rewrite this class\ncompletely. \n\n\n",
