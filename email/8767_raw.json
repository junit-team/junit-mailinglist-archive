Particular, it extracts command line arguments passed \nto the main method. How do I verify that command line arguments are \nextracted corrctly to the right private member variables? Do I have \nto add a bunch of new public get methods for those variables? I do \nnot like this idea as the design is affected by testing. Could \nsomeone provide some better approaches? Thanks in advance! \n\n\n",
