Except...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I haven&#39;t heard anybody but raw beginners claim that private methods<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t need testing.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You are ignoring the most frequently stated issue with the testing of<br/>\n&gt; private methods. In the wild, when folks &quot;need&quot; to test a private method,<br/>\n&gt; it most usually means that they aren&#39;t looking carefully enough at the<br/>\n&gt; design of the class they are testing. I&#39;d say that 9 times out of 10, the<br/>\n&gt; average developer should split the class rather than reach inside to<br/>\n&gt; test a private method.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Charlie<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 2010/12/3 CÃ©dric Beust â&quot; &lt;cedric@...&gt;:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; On Fri, Dec 3, 2010 at 1:41 AM, Karl Auer &lt;kauer@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; On Thu, 2010-12-02 at 23:40 -0800, Bill Venners wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I had forgotten I even wrote that article.
