Way at the other end of the spectrum, you test methods (or<br/>\nstatements if you want to really go far), in which you have a high degree of<br/>\ncontrol and granularity but low coverage.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow add effort to the mix, which tends to push you to maximize coverage per<br/>\nunit of effort expended creating the test. This is what makes UI<br/>\nrecord/playback tools so compelling (if you forget their other limitations).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo one of the reasons we unit test must be to increase our control over what<br/>\nis tested. Discovering defects early is one of the other main reasons, but<br/>\nis not relevant to this discussion. Given this, it seems reasonable that on<br/>\noccasion, we might want to test a private method, assuming that it does not<br/>\nmeet the criteria for being refactored, but in general we should keep in<br/>\nmind the necessity to minimize effort while satisfying functionality<br/>\ncoverage objectives.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br/>\nMike Silverstein, Lead Architect\tvoice:  (919) 858-8300 x29<br/>\nSilverMark, Inc.\t\t\tfax:    (919) 858-8308<br/>\n5511 Capital Center Drive\t\tmobile: (919) 669-5906<br/>\nSuite 510, Raleigh, NC 27606\t\ttoll free: (888) 588-0668<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.silvermark.com\">http://www.silvermark.com</a>\t\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:msilverstein@...\">msilverstein@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Johannes O.

But then if we are accepting that testing<br/>\n&gt; &gt; public/friendly/protected methods adecuately test these methods, why not<br/>\n&gt; go<br/>\n&gt; &gt; one step beyond and say that black box testing is all we need?<br/>\n&gt; It seems to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; me that testing private methods is as useful and valid as testing<br/>\n&gt; &gt; non-private ones, just at a different level of granularity.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; snip<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;     yes, you may test private methods. But that is not what actually is<br/>\n&gt; intended by unit testing. The idea is to write tests for the unit and<br/>\n&gt; thereby to specify what this unit is capable of. The idea of unit<br/>\n&gt; testing is<br/>\n&gt; not testing per se. The cool thing is that you finish writing your unit,<br/>\n&gt; when your tests pass, which cuts down time in testing and implementation.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;     Later unit testing (the TestAll called when integrating) helps us<br/>\n&gt; finding out misbehaving units after refactoring or other code changes.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;     I know that this aproach is not based on mathematical<br/>\n&gt; abductions but on<br/>\n&gt; experience. Thus I don&#39;t want to make a religion out of it, but just do it<br/>\n&gt; as good habbit.<br/>\n&gt; And I don&#39;t believe that there is a proof, that testing is more and more<br/>\n&gt; efficiant, the more granular you test. Well, you could test every line of<br/>\n&gt; code.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Toyin<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
