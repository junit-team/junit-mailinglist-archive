The conformity that I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; trying to enforce is not via the interface.  I will be using reflection and<br/>\n&gt; perhaps xjavadoc to enforce some custom rules regarding annotation tags,<br/>\n&gt; internal structure, etc...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I was able to solve my problem by creating my own TestSuite class that<br/>\n&gt; implements Test.  I added a constructor and appropriate logic to allow my<br/>\n&gt; code to pass in a custom constructor to use instead of the no-arg or String<br/>\n&gt; name args that the original TestSuite used to fire up the Tests.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; protected MyTestSuite(final Class theClass, Class[] constructorArgClasses,<br/>\n&gt; Object[] constructorArgs) ...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My suite now looks like this:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;         suite.addTestSuite(TestRule1.class, new Class[] {Class.class}, new<br/>\n&gt; Object[] {ClassToTest.class});<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I understand that this is a hack, but it allows me to proceed.  If you would<br/>\n&gt; like more information regarding my changes, let me know.  I don&#39;t think this<br/>\n&gt; is worthy of submitting as a patch/change request.  If you can think of a<br/>\n&gt; better way to handle custom constructors, please let me know.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think what you&#39;re doing is quite close to the Parameterized Test Case <br/>\npattern, so you&#39;re no less hacking than I was. As for being worthy of a <br/>\npatch, probably not. This is one of those local customizations that just <br/>\nisn&#39;t common enough to be part of the framework.
