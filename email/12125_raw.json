I agree with you\n&gt; that it depends on the degree of oupling between methods. Also, I\n&gt; think that the number of unit test cases will determine the effort\n&gt; required.\n\nLoosely speaking, perhaps, but it&#39;s usually the complexity/size of test \ncases, and not the number, that dominates the cost of writing and \nrunning and maintaining them.\n\n&gt; However, can I come up with an estimate by making some assumptions.\n&gt; For eg: the number of parameters required for each method to invoke.\n&gt; \n&gt; At the granular level i.e per test case per method, is it possible to\n&gt; come up with lines of code (LOC) for JUnit code. If so what are the\n&gt; parameters on which the LOC for a particular test case depends on.\n&gt; This muct include teh mock classes also.\n\nYou could try, but I wouldn&#39;t trust those numbers very much. LOC are \nsuch a poor indicator of time spent writing code, especially when one \nstarts to refactor regularly.\n\nAll I can suggest is a two-week experiment where you test-drive all new \nfeatures and add tests only when you need them to support your current \nwork. After two weeks, measure how quickly you&#39;re adding new features. \nThis tells you when you&#39;ll be done, which is likely more important than \nknowing how much writing tests (alone) costs you.\n\nGood luck.\n-- \nJ.
