For <br/>\nwhat it&#39;s worth, our application doesn&#39;t model things that way.  I was <br/>\nusing our business logic in a contrived situation to attempt to make a <br/>\npoint.  However, it only derailed into a critique of the code and such <br/>\n-- I&#39;ll know better next time.  The point was that asserts may exist <br/>\nwithin a context that are related only by the context itself.  They do <br/>\nnot affect each other.  For instance, applying a CreditMemo in this case <br/>\nwill change the amount of a Sale and possibly its CloseDate and Stage.  <br/>\nWhether or not the resulting CloseDate was correct has no affect on <br/>\nwhether or not the resulting amounts of the Sale are correct.  <br/>\nNevertheless, when applying the CreditMemo to a Sale it makes sense to <br/>\nassert for all of these things.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJason Rogers<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I,<br/>\nbut Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in <br/>\nthe flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved <br/>\nme, and gave himself for me.&quot;<br/>\n    Galatians 2:20</div>",
