But perhaps this is &#39;BAD&#39; (tm)?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I value testing, so I generally do whatever it takes to <br/>\n&gt; make code testable. Not everyone values testing as much<br/>\n&gt; I do, especially compared to other considerations, so <br/>\n&gt; they do other things.<br/>\n&gt; -- <br/>\n&gt; J. B. (Joe) Rainsberger<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I value testing also. But I guess I&#39;m in the latter group that finds<br/>\nother considerations to be of greater importance. I&#39;m not happy with<br/>\nstating it that way. I think there is a fundamental interconnectedness<br/>\n(in more than a Dirk Gently sort of way) between design and a lack of<br/>\ntestability. It seems good designs should be inherently testable. If<br/>\none&#39;s design attitude is test-first then the two are holistic. Even<br/>\nsymbiotic.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I&#39;m talking about here is green-field development. Legacy code,<br/>\nas always, trumps best intentions. Sometimes small changes can be made<br/>\nthat both improve the design and testability. Sometimes changes one<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t ordinarily accept must be tolerated for the short term to<br/>\nimprove testability to the point that more sweeping design changes can<br/>\nbe made with confidence. But if this is consistently happening in new<br/>\ndevelopment then I suggest stepping back and reconsidering essential<br/>\nOO design principles.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards,<br/>\nJim Cakalic</div>",
