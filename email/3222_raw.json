The patch enables you to specify which mock objects are loaded on a\nper Test class basis. E.g. if in TestA, you want the code to use a mock &quot;C&quot;\nimplementation, but in TestB you want to use a real &quot;C&quot; implementation then\nthis can be achieved with the patch.\n\nThis works without having to write your &quot;real&quot; code in any special way -\ni.e. you don&#39;t have to write the code to support the tests.\n\nBelow is a description of how to set up and use the patch to give you a\nflavour of how it works. If anyone is interested in receiving it, just send\nme a mail and I&#39;ll send it to you...\n\n\n\nPatch instructions:\n\nIn your junit3.7 directory replace the existing junit.jar with the patched\none.\n\nSome notes:\n\n1) This only works if you have dynamic reloading switched on (which\nshould be default anyway)\n2) To use, add the directory where you mock objects are as a -D\nparameter, i.e.\n\njava\n-Djunit.mockpath=c:&#92;path-to-my-mock-objects junit.swingui.TestRunner\n\n3) The mock objects directory should *not* be in your CLASSPATH\n4) In the directory where you keep your tests create a properties file\nfor each test, e.g. if you have a class called TestB, then you have a\nproperties file called TestB.properties. Each line in the file looks like\nthis:\n\nincluded.&lt;n&gt;=&lt;class name&gt;\n\nWhere &lt;n&gt; is a unique integer (make sure it is unique or you&#39;ll get\nstrange results!), and &lt;class name&gt; is the name of a class that you want\nloaded from the mock objects directory.\n5) Make sure that you have the directory containing the head of the\npackage structure that contains your properties file in your CLASSPATH,\ne.g. if you have a properties file for class mypackage.TestMyClass\nstored in the following file:\nc:&#92;javadev&#92;mypackage&#92;TestMyClass.properties\n\nThen you should have the following in your CLASSPATH:\nc:&#92;javadev\n\nThats all\n\nMatt\n\n\n_____\nThis email and any attachments are confidential and are intended only for\nthe addressee.
