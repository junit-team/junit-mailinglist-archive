(&quot;Test only the code you&#39;re responsible\nfor&quot;)\n\nIf you find yourself answering, &quot;Yeah, but I need to test my WebStart\nconfiguration...&quot;, then I&#39;d say again that configuration testing sounds\nmore like integration testing.  \n\nI wish I had a recommendation for a good automated integration testing\ntool, perhaps someone else can supply that?\n\n-Kevin\n--- Sean Machin &lt;smachin@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hi All,\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m trying to think of a good way to test some Java apps. that are\n&gt; launched by WebStart.  I&#39;ve setup some basic tests with HTTPUnit\n&gt; that go to the launch page, follow each WebStart link and ensure\n&gt; that a valid JNLP file is retrieved for each simulated\n&gt; link click.  What I&#39;d really like to do is to actually load\n&gt; each app, get past the login screen and verify each\n&gt; app&#39;s main frame is bought up without any database exceptions etc.\n&gt; \n&gt; Can anyone advise on how best to accomplish this?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Sean\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nProtect your identity with Yahoo!
