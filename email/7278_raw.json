But today everyone uses a \n&gt; runner so\n&gt; the design of a new framework (SuiteRunner) would most likely be \n&gt; different.\n&gt;\nCould you clarify what you mean by &quot;not need a runner&quot; and how that \ninfluenced the design of TestResult?\n\n&gt;&gt; Test Sequencing\n&gt;&gt; ---------------\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; But it&#39;s clear that a lot of thought went into JUnit&#39;s design.\n&gt;&gt; So what is it that makes &quot;sequential tests&quot; undesirable?\n&gt;\n&gt; if every test share the same resources, you can potentially have some \n&gt; very\n&gt; tricky problems:\n&gt;\n&gt;    your testA screws up one field of your suite\n&gt;    testB.... testY run perfectly\n&gt;    testZ fails\n&gt;\n&gt; it can be really difficult to discover that testZ was failing because \n&gt; of testA.\n\nYes, but isn&#39;t setUp supposed to take care of that kind of problem? \nInstead of creating a fixture in the constructor and reusing it in each \ntest method -- hoping that testA doesn&#39;t screw up the fixture in a way \nthat causes testZ to fail -- you just recreate the fixture anew before \neach test method.\n\nAll I can see you are buying by creating a new instance for each test \nmethod invocation is that if people screw up their setUp method, it \nstill doesn&#39;t matter. Is there something else I haven&#39;t seen?\n\nbv\n--\nBill Venners\nArtima Software, Inc.\nhttp://www.artima.com\n\n\n",
