I don&#39;t think you need to go over<br/>\n&gt; board here though, I don&#39;t need really fined grained flexibility here.<br/>\n&gt; If you want that you are better off looking at what Clover 2 or Agitar<br/>\n&gt; dashboard do by bringing other measures of risk into the picture.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Paul, all,<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been mulling over the right interface for this kind of<br/>\nfunctionality.  One thing that would really help is if people who<br/>\nwould really like to see categories in JUnit could chime in with their<br/>\n80/20 point.  I have a feeling that there&#39;s probably a really simple<br/>\ninterface that would do 80% of what people want, and a really<br/>\ncomplicated one that would do the other 20%.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, Paul, what&#39;s the difference between &quot;arbitrary groups&quot;<br/>\nand &quot;really fine-grained flexibility&quot; in your post above?  Thanks,<br/>\n<br/>\n   David Saff</div>",
