Maybe your client would prefer some expert help for a day or \ntwo? Even a half-day remote consultation would jump-start you. E-mail me \ndirectly if that&#39;s remotely feasible.\n\n&gt; But I reckon you&#39;ve got it there. We can & do JUnit it all, but it&#39;s\n&gt; just such a big job to do. You&#39;re right that I can&#39;t, say, test\n&gt; anything about one Domain object without JMocking it&#39;s DAO and half a\n&gt; dozen more to make it with, and setting up their stubs & expects & so\n&gt; on.\n&gt; But maybe that&#39;s normal?\n\nIt&#39;s normal to need to mock/stub collaborators. It&#39;s enough normal to \nhave a lot of them, but there are definite antipatterns, such as this \ncommon gem:\n\n     I mock this collaborator to return that object, which I then have \nto mock, which has to return another object, which I then have to mock...\n\nYou get the picture. I imagine this antipattern is at the heart of much \nof your problem. There is probably some inappropriate layering going on. \nI&#39;d need to dive headlong into code to be certain, but I could probably \ntell you in 30 minutes if you led me through it.\n\n&gt; Cheers for the pointers to those books - I believe Da Boss is looking\n&gt; for some reading recommendations for us, so that&#39;s perfect!\n\nI hope they help.\n\nTake care.\n-- \nJ.
