I am sure there is some fancier<br/>\n&gt;OO way to explain/implement this [or even a nicer introspection way to<br/>\n&gt;determine this], but something like a TestCase.setDependency(Class<br/>\n&gt;testClass) so TestCase constructors mark what they&#39;d like to depend upon.<br/>\n&gt;[For introspection maybe a public Class[] getDependencies()<br/>\n&gt;interface/method].<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>To implement this appears to require:<br/>\n<br/>\n* Adding a TestListener that knows when to mark a dependent test case as &quot;do not bother executing&quot;<br/>\n* Storing the dependency list somewhere<br/>\n<br/>\nYou could use JUnit-addons&#39; Test Runner, which flexibly allows you to add your own TestListener. You could implement the MarkDependentTestDoomedTestListener in about ten lines of code.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe dependency list seems to me to be equally easily stored in the TestCase itself or outside it. If you want it in the TestCase, then simply subclass TestCase, add the data then change the superclasses of your tests. Annoying, but you only have to do it once.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;The test runner engine would need to &quot;sort&quot; the calling order be dependency<br/>\n&gt;tree, and would need to know when not to call something, perhaps<br/>\n&gt;introducing<br/>\n&gt;a new state (&quot;deferred&quot; -- meaning not run due to a dependency<br/>\n&gt;failure/error -- to add to &quot;fail&quot;, &quot;error&quot;.)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The sorting part is not easy. Maybe I just don&#39;t know the algorithms well enough. Either way, you describe a new test runner, which is not part of the framework anyway. Maybe you can subclass JUnit-addons&#39; Test Runner to achieve the right effect.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do you think of this? You can leverage JUnit-addons instead of rewriting the test runner from scratch. You can graft the dependency graph feature by subclassing TestCase and adding a collection of dependent tests.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny better?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJ. B.
