I am not doing J2EE (I use\n &gt; Enhydra/Barracuda servlets) so I don&#39;t know how easy it would be to setup\n &gt; the mock objects for that environment but it is extremely simple, using\n &gt; EasyMock at least, to setup HttpRequest/Response/Session objects to enable\n &gt; this sort of testing using JUnit.\n\nI was looking at, IIRC, J2EEUnit which seems to have mocks for the HTTP\nrequest and session as part of its framework.  But I didn&#39;t get very far\nwith it at the time.  Easy Mock sounds cool, I&#39;ll have to take a look.\n\nAnyone have any experiences with J2EEUnit, or with otherwise simulating\nHTTP sessions and responses?\n\n &gt; By way of illustration, I found 5 bugs (admittedly somewhat obscure) on the\n &gt; first page I used this technique on, a login page that had been in\n &gt; production for some months, purely because it was easy to setup a number of\n &gt; different scenarios in the mock objects that the login code used.\n &gt;\n &gt; [...]\n &gt;\n &gt; PS The code I am testing is very much as thin as possible, I make heavy use\n &gt; of facades to make the ui/web server specific code as simple as I can,\n &gt; originally in the hope that it couldn&#39;t possible break, so it wouldn&#39;t need\n &gt; unit testing. However, the recent releases I have made have had problems\n &gt; found by QA in that thin layer (and only in that layer) that wasn&#39;t being\n &gt; unit tested, hence the use of mock objects.\n\nThese are the kinds of things that some of our developers worry about.\nWe&#39;d hate to have QA or even the end users find these, mostly because\nany bugs found after a release cause us to back up and fix things,\nrather than move forward onto new features.\n\nThanks for the comments,\n-Paul Hodgetts\n\n\n",
