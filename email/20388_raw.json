I will explain the situation and was\n&gt; hop=\r\ning that maybe someone could point me in the right direction.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have w=\r\nritten a SQL parser which parses a SQL query and builds an\n&gt; object model r=\r\nepresentation of same which it returns as the result of\n&gt; a parse.  The obj=\r\nect model has the ability to print itself and so long\n&gt; as the parser works=\r\n correctly what it prints will be very close to the\n&gt; input query.  A singl=\r\ne test case then consists of parsing a query,\n&gt; calling printMe( ) on the r=\r\nesultant tree and comparing it&#39;s output to\n&gt; what was expected, which again=\r\n, is very similar to but not identical\n&gt; to the original query.\n&gt; \n&gt; So, fi=\r\nrst a general question: I know that his is closer to end to end\n&gt; testing t=\r\nhan it is to the sort of fine grained class level tests JUNIT\n&gt; is designed=\r\n for.  Is JUNIT even appropriate?  Assuming the answer is\n&gt; yes, I&#39;ll conti=\r\nnue.\n&gt; \n&gt; The pseudo code for a single test case would look like this:\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n String orgnlQry =3D &quot;Select * from MyTable.MyColumn&quot;;\n&gt; String expectedQry=\r\n =3D &quot;Select * from MyColumn&quot;;\n&gt; Parser myParser =3D new Parser( );\n&gt; // A =\r\nbunch of code to construct Parser and connect to data store\n&gt; myParser.pars=\r\ne(orgnlQry);\n&gt; SQLTree tree =3D myParser.getTree( );\n&gt; String outQry =3D tr=\r\nee.printMe( );\n&gt; assertEquals(outQry, expectedQry);\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;d like all of my=\r\n test cases to use the same parser instance so that\n&gt; I only have to initia=\r\nlize it once.  The only variables for each test\n&gt; than are the orgnl/expect=\r\nedQry pairs of which I&#39;ve got about 120.  \n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m able to get a single te=\r\nst case running but I can&#39;t figure out how\n&gt; to eliminate duplicate code.  =\r\nI&#39;m also no sure how to organize the\n&gt; tests.  Shold there really be 120 di=\r\nfferent test methods or is there\n&gt; some way to call the same test method 12=\r\n0 times with different input\n&gt; strings?  \n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks in advance for any su=\r\nggestions anyone can provide.\n&gt; \n&gt; -ts1971\n&gt;\n\n- You can separate initializi=\r\nng code  to setup/teardown method, this\nwill eleminate some  duplication.\n(=\r\nabout setup and teardown method, look here\nhttp://junit.sourceforge.net/doc=\r\n/faq/faq.htm#organize_3)\n\n\n- For 120 different test case, if it has same fo=\r\nrmat and  is in text\nfile, I recommend writing another class to process rea=\r\nding it and\nreturn turn each pair. \n\nLet test case use this class to load t=\r\nhose test cases, this will save\namount of time instead of doing them all by=\r\n hand.\n\n- Another issue, I think  it&#39;s better to divide those 120  cases in=\r\nto\ndifferent catagories (ie. simple selection, selection with where\nclause =\r\netc...) . Write a test case for each catagory.  So that when\nyour code brea=\r\nk you can analyse which kind of sql query is the reason.\n\nI&#39;m quite new to =\r\nJUnit too, so if some expert see any mistakes or any\nrecommends.  \n\nHope it=\r\n helps\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
