If you do not expect to change the value of a parameter or variable inside the method, you can declare it final to let the compiler enforce that. The compiler can also optimize uses of a final parameter or variable since it knows the value will never change.\nIn spite of that, I&#39;ve gone from habitually declaring local variables as final (whenever possible) to hardly ever doing so.  The reason is that I got tired of having to mentally filter the &quot;visual noise&quot; of all of the occurrences of &quot;final&quot; when reading code, and I don&#39;t find the safety net or documentation arguments as persuasive WRT local variables.  WRT to performance, I&#39;ve rationalized my lack of final local variables by hoping that the compiler can spot the optimization possibilities w/o me having to declare the variable as final.\n\nIn fact, the developerWorks article discusses a similar situation in C when it talks about C&#39;s register keyword.  In particular, it notes that current C compilers generally ignore the register keyword because they can do a better job of optimizing things themselves.  The developerWorks article ties this back to Java by arguing that it doesn&#39;t make sense to declare methods and classes as final solely for performance reasons.  It seems like the same argument could be used WRT declaring local variables as final.  (Of course, declaring a local variable as final does not impact extensibility the way that declaring a method or class as final does.)\n\nKendall\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: J. B.
