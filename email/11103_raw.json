After all tests\n&gt; of a class have finished I want to perform another thing. Overwriting\n&gt; tearDown does not work for this requirement, it occurs too often.\n&gt; When the last test has finished I want to perform something. But it\n&gt; needs to be within JUnit, not outside of it.\n&gt; \n&gt; So I tried to put this inte XyzTestCase. Its easy to perform\n&gt; something before every test started. I simply put it into a static\n&gt; constructor. But how can I perform something after every test has\n&gt; finished? I tried to overwrite various methods of the upper class\n&gt; TestCase, but it didn&#39;t help. They were called too frequently or not\n&gt; at all.\n&gt; \n&gt; Can you please help me?\n\nLook for junit.extensions.TestSetup. I think it&#39;s your solution.\n\nOne thing: I have never needed to override runBare(). Can you explain \nwhy you need to do it?\n\nThanks.\n-- \nJ. B.
