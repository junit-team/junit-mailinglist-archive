It provides pretty decent support for running EJBs outside of the container. Except for Entity beans ( which is a subject for a different thread ), you can do pretty much anything you do in the container without going though the hassle of running the build, deploying, restarting the server, etc. Essentially it is a very lightweight EJB container implementation tailored specifically for unit testing. \n&lt;/plug&gt;\n\nDeploying test classes into the container ( approach supported by Cactus and JUnitEE ) has its share of problems. It takes some time to setup, deployment is still slow for most industry-leading servers, the app should be re-deployed even after a simple test class change. So in my view it is not very suitable for test-driven development. \n\nAlexander.\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: J. B. Rainsberger \n  To: junit@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Thursday, August 07, 2003 3:57 PM\n  Subject: Re: [junit] Re: Junit tests for EJBs\n\n\n  &gt;So said jxingtang on 2003-08-07 --------------------\n  &gt;--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;J. B. Rainsberger&quot; &lt;jbrains@r...&gt; \n  &gt;wrote:\n  &gt;&gt; &gt;So said rahuls_25 on 2003-08-07 --------------------\n  &gt;&gt; &gt;Hi,\n  &gt;&gt; &gt;I am a newbie to JUnit and my company uses automatic build to run \n  &gt;&gt; &gt;test cases written in Junit for each java class. But, we are not \n  &gt;&gt; &gt;testing EJBs currently as it would involve creating .ear file and \n  &gt;&gt; &gt;testing. So, can anybody tell me what is the best way to test \n  &gt;Entity, \n  &gt;&gt; &gt;session and message beans and servlets? Is there anyway to test \n  &gt;JSPs?\n  &gt;&gt; &gt;Any samples/links provided will be much appreciated.\n  &gt;&gt; \n  &gt;&gt; My coauthor and I will devote approximately 100 pages to this in \n  &gt;our upcoming book. Please understand that we can&#39;t do it by \n  &gt;tomorrow. :)\n  &gt;&gt; \n  &gt;&gt; Since you are testing code already written, my strong suggestion is \n  &gt;to start by testing through the end-user interface or using a package \n  &gt;like Cactus. Thorough and fast testing of EJBs requires a certain \n  &gt;design approach that not many people take.\n  &gt;&gt; \n  &gt;\n  &gt;I just read an article titled as &quot;Test Infect Your Enterprise \n  &gt;JavaBeans&quot; from java.sun.com. I am not sure the approach presented \n  &gt;there is still recommended or not as it is dated back to 2000. The \n  &gt;web page link is  \n  &gt;\n  &gt;http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/J2EE/testinf\n  &gt;ect/#resources\n\n  It&#39;s a good first step, but after running large test suites on the app server for a while you&#39;ll want something faster. For anyone who&#39;s never done it before, they should try the approach described in the article and discover the flaws as they come up. In the meantime, we&#39;re describing those flaws and how to deal with them as quickly as we can.\n\n  Take care.\n\n\n  J. B.
