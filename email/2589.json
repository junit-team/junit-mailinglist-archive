JUNITPP) which is available <br/>\nat junit.org is very helpful for repeating the same tests x number of <br/>\ntimes, and you could easily add a wait time to the code that controls <br/>\nthe repetition--but I think they&#39;ve only extended the non-GUI <br/>\nTestRunner. At the very least, taking a look at JunitPP might be a <br/>\nplace to begin heading in the right direction. - DJ<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In junit@y..., &quot;LECLUSE Dirk (BMB)&quot; &lt;dirk.lecluse@p...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Hello,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Was wondering if there exists a JUnit extension that allows JUnit <br/>\nto run<br/>\n&gt; tests every x minutes (every eg 30 minutes).<br/>\n&gt; Preferable this would run in a JUnit GUI like <br/>\njunit.swingui.TestRunner, but<br/>\n&gt; with the option to check-enable repeatative testing, and specify an <br/>\ninterval<br/>\n&gt; like every x minutes.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Repeatative testing is interesting to check a development that <br/>\ndepends on<br/>\n&gt; several dependancies (legacy applications) that tend to change over <br/>\ntime (eg<br/>\n&gt; go down, be modified, etc)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I experimented to implement/extend junit.swingui.TestRunner but <br/>\nwithout a<br/>\n&gt; lot of success so far.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Any suggestions are welcomed.<br/>\n&gt; Thanks,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Dirk Lecluse<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; **** DISCLAIMER ****<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;      &quot;This e-mail and any attachment thereto may contain <br/>\ninformation which is confidential and/or protected by intellectual <br/>\nproperty rights and are intended for the sole use of the recipient(s) <br/>\nnamed above. <br/>\n&gt;      Any use of the information contained herein (including, but <br/>\nnot limited to, total or partial reproduction, communication or <br/>\ndistribution in any form) by other persons than the designated <br/>\nrecipient(s) is prohibited. <br/>\n&gt;      If you have received this e-mail in error, please notify the <br/>\nsender either by telephone or by e-mail and delete the material from <br/>\nany computer&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;      Thank you for your cooperation.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; For further information about Proximus mobile phone services please <br/>\nsee our website at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.proximus.be\">http://www.proximus.be</a> or refer to any Proximus <br/>\nagent. </span></blockquote></div>",
