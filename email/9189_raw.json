I&#39;ve seen this too.  I call them &quot;riveters&quot; since I&#39;ve been \n&gt; reading a book on the design and construction of the Empire State \n&gt; Building and the analogy seems apt.  The riveters don&#39;t design or do \n&gt; anything sophisticated -- they just rivet together the beams that you \n&gt; tell them to.\n\nI find it hard to believe that this works. It just seems like a huge \nwaste. One talented programmer does the work of five not-so-talented \nones at 60% of the price (of the five).\n\n&gt;  &gt; In my current project, we don&#39;t even have any dedicated QA people; the\n&gt;  &gt; programmers themselves are responsible for doing all of the\n&gt;  &gt; QA. We ended up with a very heavily automated solution, one we never\n&gt;  &gt; could have had without QA staff who were programmers to the point that\n&gt;  &gt; they could change our software internals to make it more testable.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sounds cool.\n\nHm. Do you mean that you don&#39;t have people who test full time? or you \ndon&#39;t have people will formal testing experience and/or raw testing skill?\n\nGoogle &quot;What is exploratory testing?&quot;\n\n-- \nJ.
