This works quite well, but it requires that you write<br/>\nvery<br/>\nclean Corba code. You also  might not find some common errors. In Corba it<br/>\nis for example<br/>\nnot allowed to sent null as an out parameter, and running the Corba Server<br/>\nwithin the same<br/>\nprocess does not catch the error.<br/>\n<br/>\nTherefore I currently also run the same tests using a real Corba server.<br/>\nThis can be done without implementing the tests again.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat really would be needed, would be an infrastructure where I could<br/>\ninstall, start and stop<br/>\na Corbaserver on a remote machine automatically. This would probably require<br/>\nthat an additional daemon process would run on the remote machine.<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe this wouldn&#39;t be difficult, and would probably not require any<br/>\nchanges to Junit.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards,<br/>\nMarkus</div>",
