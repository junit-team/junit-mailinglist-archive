Some of the method-level JavaDoc comments in the JDK are pretty good.  Then again, it&#39;s very heavily used and not subject to a lot of<br/>\nchange.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn general, I find most method-level JavaDoc to be superfluous at best, and inaccurate at the worst.  It&#39;s easy to forget to update them, so often<br/>\nthey lie.  If I have to add a lot of comments to the method to express its intent, then it&#39;s probably doing more than it should or not well named.<br/>\nTests don&#39;t lie, so I&#39;m inclined to look at any existing tests to determine how a method is really intended to behave.  I typically use JavaDoc<br/>\nsimply to look up a method signature, which can easily be kept in synch with the code using an automated build process.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike<br/>\n--<br/>\nMike Clark<br/>\nClarkware Consulting, Inc.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.clarkware.com\">http://www.clarkware.com</a><br/>\n720.851.2014</div>",
