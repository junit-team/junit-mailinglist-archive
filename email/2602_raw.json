Look at JUnit&#39;s tests for instance.  Look\n&gt; at the sample Money tests that are published with JUnit.  Go to junit.org,\n&gt; or the junit wiki, or the SourceForge site, etc.  I think it would be a good\n&gt; idea for you to try learning what you can from the documentation and\n&gt; examples that already exist, then, when you have more specific questions,\n&gt; ask the group.\n&gt;\n&gt; It isn&#39;t that we are unwilling to answer questions, it&#39;s just that I think\n&gt; most people expect that new comers will put forth some effort in addressing\n&gt; the learning curve.  Personaly, I don&#39;t expect you to make yourself\n&gt; completely versed in JUnit, I simply expect you to familiarize yourself with\n&gt; the product enough to be able to ask intelligent questions about it.\n&gt;\n&gt; Try to understand what an Assert is, what a TestCase is, what a TestResult\n&gt; is, what a TestRunner is...  These are the basics.  (Actually, you could\n&gt; even skip TestResult for now.)  Then, if you have a class that you already\n&gt; know you want to write tests for (or you are doing test first design and\n&gt; have an idea of the class you will be writing) tell us about it.  We will\n&gt; then have a common language for describing how to write the tests -- JUnit&#39;s\n&gt; framework!\n&gt;\n&gt; I hope you don&#39;t take this email offensively.  I understand that it is\n&gt; sometimes overwhelming to learn a new product (JUnit), not to mention a new\n&gt; paradigm (unit testing or testing in general).  I only hope to guide you to\n&gt; some possible good starting places.\n&gt;\n&gt; -Jason\n&gt;\n&gt;     &gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt;     &gt; From: Alagusundaram Paulraj [mailto:apaulra@...]\n&gt;     &gt; Sent: Friday, August 31, 2001 12:31 PM\n&gt;     &gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;     &gt; Subject: Re: [junit] Need help\n&gt;     &gt;\n&gt;     &gt;\n&gt;     &gt; I also need to know how to write test cases in Java using Junit\n&gt;     &gt;\n&gt;     &gt; Pankaj Solanki wrote:\n&gt;     &gt;\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; Hello, I am a newcomer to testing world.I will be using\n&gt;     &gt; JUnit3.7 tool\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; for unit testing.
