They do nothing <br/>\nto reduce duplication within the entire system. Extracting them to <br/>\npublic methods on an appropriate class does.<br/>\n<br/>\nConsider a method to parse a String into a Calendar. This is boiler <br/>\nplate code. Do it a few times in a class, and you&#39;ll end up making a <br/>\nprivate method. However, when Jane over there wants to turn a String <br/>\ninto a Calendar in a different class, she doesn&#39;t know about the private <br/>\nmethod you wrote - because it&#39;s _private_.<br/>\n<br/>\nPrivate methods are the most common violator of the <br/>\nSingle-Responsibility Principle, in my experience. Wanting to test them <br/>\nis a symptom, to me, of a violation of the SRP.  Exposing private <br/>\nmethods as public, on an appropriate class, helps me to avoid <br/>\nSRP-violations, and helps promote reuse to reduce duplication.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other driver I have to make private methods public is explicitly to <br/>\nreduce duplication. For example, maybe it&#39;s you doing the <br/>\nString-to-Calendar trick in another class. You know where you did it <br/>\nbefore, so you extract it out and reuse it. However, this only works <br/>\nbecause you&#39;re familar with what you did earlier - it didn&#39;t work for <br/>\nJane because she wasn&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobert.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n               &quot;Software is too expensive to build cheaply&quot;<br/>\nRobert Watkins         <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://twasink.net/\">http://twasink.net/</a>          <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:robertdw@...\">robertdw@...</a></div>",
