The\nparameters I vary are the different tags I may put in a target XML file. \nI then validate that the documentation for these elements are all\npresent.\n\nSo, for example, the window element may have two attributes.  In my test,\nI make sure that the two attributes are listed.  Then, when I check the\ncontrol element, there are many more attributes to check.\n\nWhen I think about varying test parameters, this is what I think about.\n\nHave a nice day !\nFrancois Beausoleil\n\n\nOn Wed, 13 Nov 2002 07:54:43 -0700, &quot;Mike Clark&quot; &lt;mike@...&gt;\nsaid:\n&gt; mark_x_robinson wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;I have a standard test with needs to be run for different parameters. \n&gt; &gt;I have created an XML file to define all the parameters and was \n&gt; &gt;hoping to use JUnit to run the tests.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;I cannot see how I can run the same method using different parameters.\n&gt; &gt;e.g tests hcannot take paramters and methods are only called one.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;I could have one test method that does the test for each parameter \n&gt; &gt;set but JUnit I don&#39;t think allows you to continue after an assert. \n&gt; &gt;Basically I want to treat each pass of the test  as a seperate \n&gt; &gt;success/fail condition.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Any ideas ?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; I generally don&#39;t find many edible plants along this trail.  I ask \n&gt; myself why a test might pass with one parameter value and fail with \n&gt; another.  If the answer is interesting, I&#39;ll codify it in a new test \n&gt; fixture.  Usually there are classes of parameter values that can be \n&gt; adequately tested with a handful of fixtures.\n&gt; \n&gt; Nevertheless, you might find these helpful:\n&gt; \n&gt;     JXUnit for varying test data and code:\n&gt;     http://jxunit.sourceforge.net/\n&gt; \n&gt;     JFunc for allowing multiple assertions:\n&gt;     http://www.gnufoo.org/junit/index.html#failures\n&gt; \n&gt; Please report back on your findings so we can all learn.\n&gt; \n&gt; Mike\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
