We will probably want to have more than one test for \n&gt; each, which will likely lead to a &quot;combinatorical explosion&quot; \n&gt; if we test all the four steps together.\n\nThe combinatorial explosion appears if you don&#39;t maintain state.  With this\napproach, your tests are going to look like:\n\nTest1:\n\t1\nTest2:\n\t1-2\nTest3:\n\t1-2-3\nTest4:\n\t1-2-3-4\n\nThis is a huge waste of time.  Testing application servers and more\nimportantly, applications that run in these application servers, can take\nseveral hours to entire nights (trust me on that :-)), so the approach above\nis simply not applicable.\n\nAnd it also raises the problem I mentioned earlier (if test 2 fails, tests 3\nand 4 should not be marked as FAILURES but as TESTS NOT RUN, which is much\nless scary to the QA organization).\n\n-- \nCedric\n\n\n",
