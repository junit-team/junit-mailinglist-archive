B. Rainsberger&quot; &lt;jbrains@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; No, I had lost the context of the discussion. I\n&gt; would use DbUnit or the \n&gt; ORM, whichever was simpler. In your case, I&#39;d use\n&gt; the ORM.\n&gt; \n&gt; But, even better, I&#39;d use a fake (not a mock!) Data\n&gt; Repository layer \n&gt; when testing Business Logic without worrying about\n&gt; where in particular \n&gt; the data comes from.\n\nI agree. But what do you tell about integration\ntesting? Some bugs will never show up if only mock\nobjects are used. How do you catch them? Chapter 13\ndoesn&#39;t seem to address our needs for integration\ntesting.\n\nYou only mention FIT very shortly in your book. Is\nthis the ultimate solution for integration testing?\n\nWhat do you think about TestNG? I see that you don&#39;t\nmention it in your book.\n\nWhat do you say about test dependencies? In your book\nI only found a solution for ensuring that the tests\nare executed in a special order. But what about &quot;skip\ntest y if test x failed&quot;? It reminds me of our batch\nprograms: run batch y (which depends on results of\nbatch x) only if batch x succeeded. Is there an addon\nfor this for JUnit or a small and simple solution? Or\nshould it not be done? In a way I agree with the\nauthor of TestNG that it would be nice to see 1 test\npassed, 1 test failed, 24 tests skipped instead of 1\ntest passed and 25 tests failed.\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nDo you Yahoo!? \nYahoo!
