I&#39;m\n&gt; in the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; unfortuna=\r\nte situation of having to write tests for an existing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; application(I h=\r\naven&#39;t been involved in the development). =B4\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Unfortunate? This is=\r\n the standard situation in most processes: Test\n&gt; are\n&gt; &gt; written after dev=\r\nelopment or in parallel to it. What&#39;s so\n&gt; unfortunate about\n&gt; &gt; writing te=\r\nsts?\n&gt; \n&gt; As Chris Dollin stated, &quot;unfortunate&quot; refers to writing the test\n=\r\n&gt; post-hoc. \n\nEven this is IMO not at all unfortunate. Why should it be? Te=\r\nst-first is\ngood - but I doubt that this means that you *never* write tests=\r\n later to\ncover additional cases. Of course, with test-first you usually ha=\r\nve a\nset of test to start from, which you can copy-paste (or even put into =\r\na\nfine test-case architecture) to extend. But writing from scratch\nafterwar=\r\nds should be as much fun as test-first - IF (big if) the\nsoftware is design=\r\ned for testability. \nStill, if there are enough public methods around, it s=\r\nhould be possible\nto test &quot;just these&quot; - and either this finds enough bugs =\r\nfor keeping\ndevelopment busy for some time; or if not, you can talk to the =\r\nguys\nthere (who will sit around and fiddle with their thumbs) to refactor t=\r\no\nmore testability ...\n\n&gt; &gt; Technically, I do not see why you shouldn&#39;t be =\r\nable to write unit\n&gt; tests for\n&gt; &gt; selected classes with JUnit - if the des=\r\nign is suitable.\n&gt; \n&gt; Is there infomation somewhere in the net about whethe=\r\nr or not a design\n&gt; is suitable for being tested with JUnit?\n\nI write testc=\r\nases routinely (well, a few per week :-) ) for a project\nwhich does only in=\r\n-system testing. They have so many public methods that\nJUnit is easy to app=\r\nly to it (of course, this is NOT AT ALL object\ntesting ... but I really don=\r\nt care as long as enough of the system gets\ntested; and enough bugs are fou=\r\nnd: A successful test is a test which\nfinds bugs).\nSlowly, I also try to wr=\r\nite object tests - but this is really low-prio\nright now (I might show you =\r\nall a piece of the software and its unit\ntests in a few weeks and ask for y=\r\nour comments on my way of making it\nobject-testable - using &quot;Junit Recipes&quot;=\r\n advice).\n\n\n&gt; It is about functional correctness. I did load tests using &quot;T=\r\nhe\n&gt; Grinder 3&quot; (can be found at sourceforge), which is free. There are a\n&gt;=\r\n lot of open source load testing tools, so they are not necessarily\n&gt; expen=\r\nsive. \n\nGood to know - I&#39;ll tell that the people in our company who told me=\r\n that\nthey couldn&#39;t afford load test tools ....\n\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; * to which level=\r\n of granularity, e.g.\n&gt; &gt;   - methods of single classes; or of facade class=\r\nes hiding a\n&gt; complete\n&gt; &gt; &quot;system&quot;;\n&gt; &gt;   - single web page clicks, or who=\r\nle work-flows;\n&gt; \n&gt; That is to be determined and I know only we can do that=\r\n. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; * to which level of quality, e.g.\n&gt; &gt;   - only critical functi=\r\nons (e.g. defined by &quot;draw most bug reports\n&gt; in the\n&gt; &gt; last 3 monts&quot;);\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;   - everything to some coverage level; then you need to decide on \n&gt; &gt;   =\r\n-- the coverage level (&quot;80%&quot; is in &quot;industry standard&quot;; &quot;100%\n&gt; feasible\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; coverage&quot; is the only sensible standard)\n&gt; \n&gt; I assume the level of quali=\r\nty depends on the level of granularity. \n\nI&#39;m not sure - for me, the two ar=\r\ne orthogonal. The latter is more driven\nby the resources (people and time) =\r\nyou have - you have to stop when\nmoney&#39;s out ...\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;   -- the type of c=\r\noverage (code coverage; or some &quot;feature coverage&quot;\n&gt; - all\n&gt; &gt; the features=\r\n down written in some specification or documentation)\n&gt; \n&gt; Code coverage is=\r\n not an issue here but &quot;feature coverage&quot; is. Is\n&gt; &quot;feature coverage&quot; a com=\r\nmon term? \n\nI fear not, after looking on the internet. I&#39;ll check in my few=\r\n testing\nbooks what they call it.\n\nRegards\nHarald M.
