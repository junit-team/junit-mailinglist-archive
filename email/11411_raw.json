We are not verifying Count\n&gt; in this test, but rather indexing.  Although I would argue that it is\n&gt; nice to have pre-requisites satisfied in the middle of a test, to help\n&gt; direct your attention to the true cause of the issue.\n\nI agree that verifying prerequisites is a good thing. I might, however, \ndo that either in SetUp or a separate test.\n\n&gt; An assumption is really a pre-requisite - that if fails, really means\n&gt; that you were not even able to set-up to do the real testing.  Having\n&gt; assumptions fail helps to pin-point coupling between components - as\n&gt; well as helps direct your attention was secondary failing tests to the\n&gt; primary ones (aka the failed Assertions).\n&gt; \n&gt; An corollary is something you believe to be true, but is not essential\n&gt; to your unit test itself.  Corollaries are nice because you indirectly\n&gt; add additional tests for other components of our system without that\n&gt; much extra overhead.  Failing corollaries may highlight obscure bugs\n&gt; in other parts of your system, or they highlight your\n&gt; mis-understanding of those other parts (or they highlight a change to\n&gt; the underlying assumptions of those parts).\n\nThese are very interesting ideas, and I like them, but I would like to \nventure something that I find simpler.\n\nThe name of the method and of its containing class provide the context \nfor what is being tested. It should be easy to identify the assertions \nin the test that match with the test&#39;s context. In this case, absolutely \neverything else is an assumption or corollary.\n-- \nJ. B.
