So closer\n&gt; &gt; inspection of (1) I noted that I was actually wrapping a number of\n&gt; &gt; DocumentListeners to get the effect I desired - unfortunately I was\n&gt; &gt; add them in the wrong order. \n&gt; \n&gt; You might consider\n&gt; 4) expose API to getEffectDesired() and then testGettingEffectDesired\n\nI&#39;m probably being thick, but I am not sure what you&#39;re getting at here,\ncould you expand please?  \n\nMy confusion comes (I think) from the fact that I am trying to make my UI\n&quot;lightweight&quot; in terms of functionality embedded within it.  So from that\nviewpoint the effect I am interested in is that my edit control behaves\ncorrectly.  So the UI code becomes responsible for instantiating and using\nthis text contol.  Perhaps a better (more TDD friendly?) approach would be\nto realise that I needed a text control to be have in a certain manner and\nextract that from my UI and drive that?  Having said that I&#39;d still probably\nhave nested the construction of the DocumentListeners, so I&#39;d still end up\nwith the same quandry (albeit on a smaller scale).\n\n&gt; &gt; So whilst (1) on its own would have worked, I like (2) as well\n&gt; &gt; because the listener can be used in a number of different ways and\n&gt; &gt; (1) only tests a specific usage.\n\n&gt; Another thing to consider: which is more stable, your UI or your\n&gt; backend? If the latter, esp if you expect to expose it more ways in\n&gt; future (e.g. as a service), you should definitely put more test effort\n&gt; into it--over time you will &quot;spread the overhead.&quot; But if your UI is\n&gt; more stable, and you expect to &quot;forklift-replace&quot; the current backend,\n&gt; then I might not bother.\n\nHistory has shown that, in this context, the backend is/will be more stable\n(which is another reason why I adopted the two pronged approach).\n\n",
