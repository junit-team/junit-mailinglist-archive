We use this class to dynamically generate buttons for our<br/>\n&gt; web site.  I would like to add testing to the class that draws the text on<br/>\n&gt; the background image.  So far my only idea for testing a class like this is<br/>\n&gt; to visually inspect the results.  Any ideas on how one could use JUnit to<br/>\n&gt; test something like this?  I want to verify that the image generated by this<br/>\n&gt; class is in fact the background image with the given text and that it is<br/>\n&gt; vertically centered and that the line wrapping works as expected.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; A similar problem that would seem as difficult as above would be a class<br/>\n&gt; that modifies a sound file.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks,<br/>\n&gt; Todd Chaffee </span></blockquote></div>",
