Examples include open\n&gt; &gt;&gt;source applications or products where the source code is the primary\n&gt; &gt;&gt;deliverable (e.g. frameworks).\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I think that we are talking about two different products: the\n&gt; final application (a jar in the Java world) and the development\n&gt; environment.\n&gt; &gt; The tests code is part of the source code but not part of the\n&gt; final application.\n&gt; &gt; You always can keep the tests in the cvs tree or a separate\n&gt; package for download.  If the customer has the knowledge to\n&gt; modify the code, he certainly know how to get code from a cvs tree :-)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; -Vladimir\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m specifically referring to products where the source code is part and\n&gt; parcel of the product or the product provides a Java API.  It&#39;s not\n&gt; always necessary to ship all of the test cases, but relevant test cases\n&gt; that document and validate the use of the product should easily make up\n&gt; for their storage and bandwidth penalties.\n&gt;\n&gt; Mike\n&gt; --\n&gt; Mike Clark\n&gt; Clarkware Consulting, Inc.\n&gt; Custom Software Architecture, Design,\n&gt; Development, and Performance Consulting\n&gt; http://www.clarkware.com\n\nDefinitely if source code is provided, including test cases make sense. I\nthink we all agree now that within the context of end-user application\ndeployment, it doesn&#39;t make sense to include test cases, except for special\ndiagnostic circumstances. If a product deliverable includes source code, or\nis a framework that provides a set of Java APIs, then a set of test cases is\ninvaluable for documenting and validating product usage.\n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nMike Silverstein\nSilverMark, Inc.\nThe object testing company\nhttp://www.silvermark.com\n\n\n",
