It seems like its\nnot going to be possible to do it while separating the TestCase classes and\nthe business object classes.\n\nOne of the reasons I see a difficulty is that we are using VisualAge for\nJava and it would make it a deployment nightmare to include the code in the\nsame packages or, worse yet, the same classes.  I know that there are\noptions I could use outside of VA such as ANT to only build certain classes,\nbut I doubt I could get the client to buy into that and I still don&#39;t think\nthat solves the private method issue.\n\nAm I just missing something easy or what?\n\nThanks,\nMike\n\n\n",
