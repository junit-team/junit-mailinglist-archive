The point was that Matthew (& co.) are\nusing JUnit for both UTs and ATs (FTs).  JUnit is actually very good for\nsome types of ATs because it is such a well designed automated testing\nframework.  They aren&#39;t violating any premises, for as Matthew said they are\nusing it for UTs in the way it was meant.  But, if it happens to work for\ntheir ATs, why not use it?\n\nIf you would still like to get into the debate of what is a &quot;UNIT&quot; though,\nfeel free.\n\n-Jason\n\n\n",
