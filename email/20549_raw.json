Feel free to skip it.\n\nIf, however, you find your=\r\nself a little mystified about your\ntest case&#39;s behaviour, you have the opti=\r\non of turning on\nthe log to get another view on what the test case is doing=\r\n.\nAlternately you could run the test in a debugger. Or you could \nstart wri=\r\nting a bunch of hand-crafted logging statements since\nlogging is sometimes =\r\nmore effective than debugging. \nBut in some cases the assertion log would a=\r\nlready be logging what \nyou need to know without your having to write those=\r\n statements.\n\nIt&#39;s just another tool that is sometimes useful. Debuggers\nar=\r\ne important, but you don&#39;t have to use them.\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com,=\r\n Robert Wenner &lt;robert.wenner@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; On Monday 09 June 2008 21:18,=\r\n C=E9dric Beust  wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If I have to go through umpteen thousand line=\r\ns of log, I may as well\n&gt; &gt; &gt; test everything manually.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Nobody says=\r\n you have to, but the fact that your tests pass doesn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; guarantee that =\r\nyou are testing what you think you are testing.\n&gt; \n&gt; Well.
