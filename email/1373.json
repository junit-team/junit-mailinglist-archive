    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2127583868\">I also have the requirement that I don&#39;t have any test code in my <br/>\nproduction code.  This also means I don&#39;t change the code just to <br/>\nenable testing.  (Test-first design has resulted in better designs <br/>\nwithout compromising the integrity of the code)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are reluctant to change your code just so you can test it, you <br/>\nshould consider #2, #3 and #5.  With Reflection (#2), your production <br/>\ncode stays the same, the test code just modifies it at run-time to <br/>\ninstall the Mock objects.  With #3, the subclasses could exist <br/>\ncompletely in your testcode.  Your production code would remain the <br/>\nsame.  With Dynamic Proxies (#5), the proxy is created at run-time so <br/>\nyour production code is never modified.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Greg<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In junit@y..., Matt Caswell &lt;m.caswell@h...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Very interesting. It seems to me that you could use 1-5 in certain<br/>\n&gt; circumstances. However I think I would be reluctant to change the <br/>\nway my<br/>\n&gt; code was implemented just so that I could test it, as some of the <br/>\nother<br/>\n&gt; posts on this topic have suggested you should do. Option 6 looks <br/>\nlike it<br/>\n&gt; could have a lot of potential - I would think it would work in <br/>\nalmost all<br/>\n&gt; scenarios without requiring that you write your implementation code <br/>\nin a<br/>\n&gt; specifc way. I agree - it definately looks like a fun thing to try <br/>\nand do!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Matt<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: ghouston@i...<br/>\n&gt; To: junit@y...<br/>\n&gt; Sent: 01/06/01 14:41<br/>\n&gt; Subject: [junit] Method Chains, was Re: Testing private methods<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; There are several was to get Mock objects into your production code:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 1. Parameters <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; As Mr Freeman shows, you use parameters to pass the Mock into the <br/>\n&gt; class that calls it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 2 Reflection<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If B is referenced in a field of A, you can use reflection to <br/>\nmodify <br/>\n&gt; A and replace B with it&#39;s Mock.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 3 Mole Pattern<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Subclass A, and use the subclass to setup the Mock.  [I call this <br/>\n&gt; design the &quot;Mole Pattern&quot;]<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 4 Strategy Pattern<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Use a Strategy design pattern.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 5 Dynamic Proxy<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If the B is an implementation of an Interface, you can use a <br/>\nDynamic <br/>\n&gt; Proxy (new feature of Java 1.3b).  The Mock would be an <br/>\n&gt; InvocationHandler, instead of a twin of B.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 6 Classloader<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Use a classloader to load the Mock instead of the real class.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ---<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; There may be other options, but these are the ones I&#39;ve heard of.  <br/>\n&gt; Personally, I&#39;ve used everything except #6.  Options #1 <br/>\n(parameters) <br/>\n&gt; and #2 (reflection) are my favorites.  They are usually the easiest <br/>\n&gt; to implement and understand.  For #2, I&#39;ve used the <br/>\n&gt; PrivilegedAccessor.java [posted by Mr DiIorio] to make the <br/>\nreflection <br/>\n&gt; work simple.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve never seen anyone use #6 (classloaders), I think it would be <br/>\nfun <br/>\n&gt; to try.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; - Greg<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --- In junit@y..., &quot;Steve Freeman&quot; &lt;steve@m...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; RE: Method Chains, was Re: Testing private methodsAlternatively, <br/>\n&gt; &gt; change from:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; public class A {<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   public void f() {<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     b = new B();<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     b.doSomething();<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   }<br/>\n&gt; &gt; }<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; to:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; public class A {<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   public void f(B b) {<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     b.doSomething(aValue());<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   }<br/>\n&gt; &gt; }<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; The test then becomes:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; public class TestA {<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   public void testF() {<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     A anA = new A(aValue);<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     MockB mockB = new MockB();<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     mockB.setExpectedSomething(aValue);<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;     a.f(mockB);<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;     mockB.verify();<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   }<br/>\n&gt; &gt; }<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; We have found that changing to a style where you pass behaviours <br/>\n&gt; around, rather than data, avoids things like subclassing production <br/>\n&gt; code in a test and pushes the code to flexing in the &#39;right&#39; kinda <br/>\n&gt; ways. If you can figure out what to pass in and what to verify, <br/>\nthen <br/>\n&gt; the rest of the test usually falls out.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Steve<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@y...<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
