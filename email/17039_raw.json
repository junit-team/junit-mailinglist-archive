I need more information:\nAre you using WSAD or RAD (or what IDE, if any).\nWhich version of WAS are you trying to hit, 5.0, 5.1, 6.0, 6.1\nBecause what you include will vary depending.\n \nIf you happen to be using RAD and WSAD 5.1, here&#39;s what you&#39;ll need:\nThe attached implfactory.jar (taken from one of the JAR files that ships with WebSphere, you can get this from your distribution instead of using the attached file).\nInclude a file called jndi.properties in your class path that has the following 2 entries:\n\njava.naming.factory.initial=com.sun.jndi.cosnaming.CNCtxFactory\njava.naming.provider.url=iiop://localhost:2809\nWhenever you search for an EJB home outside of a container, add the following to your lookup path:\ncell/nodes/localhost/servers/server1/\nNote, your values might be different. You&#39;ll have to run the universal test client and manually expand the JNDI tree to make sure your EJB home objects are registered there.\nTutorials and Articles\n     http://schuchert.wikispaces.com/\n\n\n\n----- Original Message ----\nFrom: swetha yalamanchili &lt;sb_syalamanchili@...&gt;\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSent: Monday, June 26, 2006 5:20:48 AM\nSubject: Re: [junit] can junit test ejb&#39;s without junit extensions\n\n\nHi Brett,\n\nCan you please tell me the list of jar files which need to be placed in the classpath.\nAs welll as the properties necessary.\n\nThank You,\nSwetha\n\n\n&quot;Brett L. Schuchert&quot; &lt;schuchert@yahoo. com&gt; wrote:\nYes. We&#39;ve been doing it for 3+ years.\n\nThe key is getting the right combination of jar files and property files in your class path. Once you&#39;ve done that, you can connect to an EJB and send it a message. No problem.\n\nHowever, I&#39;d caution you to not do that if you can avoid it. \n\nI understand that you are testing the use of the code more closely to the environment in which it will run. On the other hand, you now will need to run a server to run your unit tests. They will be a bit more of a pain to debug (though they are certainly debug-able).\n\nWe are using stateful session beans (I can give you the reasons for it if you&#39;d like, but suffice it to say we are doing that). We then introduce entity beans because, frankly, WebSphere&#39;s handling of stateful session beans was wholly inadequate (and I can explain that - this was for WAS 5.0 - 5.1, have not experimented with WAS 6.0 or 6.1 yet). Since we started using entity beans, we started using server side tests. Now we have a whole lot of tests that require a server. \n\nWell we&#39;re moving away from that. We&#39;re replacing all of our entity beans (about 6 coarse-grained beans) with hibernate. We are moving all logic out of stateful session beans into POJO&#39;s so the session beans are just pass through. Then we&#39;ll use spring to configure the system.\n\nThis allows for quick testing without having to have a server running (better support for continuous integration only because it removes an excuse for people to check in without running all unit tests - not really a good reason but it can help). ALSO, if you move to WAS 6.0 and RAD 6.0, deployment can be VERY slow (up to 15 minutes and beyond for a moderate system), which makes testing even more of a pain BUT NO LESS ESSENTIAL.\n\nI understand that to be pragmatic you probably need a solution now and might consider allowing tests to run without having to use a server.\n\nI won&#39;t be able to get back to you with any details until next week (I&#39;m about to leave on a vacation). But if you send me the following information, I&#39;ll try to give you the details that might get you there:\n- Version of WAS\n- Your IDE, if any (WSAD, RAD, Eclipse + WTP, ...) and the version number of that IDE\n\nAs an alternative, you can try this right now:\n1. Start a server.\n2. Run the universal test client to look at the JNDI tree\n3. Find where your beans are actually deployed: cell/nodes/server/ server1/. .. (or something like that, don&#39;t have the info handy)\n4. Use Sun&#39;s JNDI instead of IBM&#39;s\n5. Point to the correct port, 2809 for WAS 5.1, 2810 for WAS 6.x\n6. If you are looking for a session bean called FooHome, add cell/nodes/server/ server1/ in front of it.\n\nHope that&#39;s enough to get you started. I can get more to you next week.\n\nEmail me direct, please, at schuchert@yahoo. com\n\nTutorials and Articles\nhttp://schuchert. wikispaces. com/\n\n----- Original Message ----\nFrom: swetha yalamanchili &lt;sb_syalamanchili@ yahoo.com&gt;\nTo: junit@yahoogroups. com\nSent: Thursday, June 22, 2006 10:42:41 AM\nSubject: [junit] can junit test ejb&#39;s without junit extensions\n\nHi Rain,\n\nI have few questions.\nCan junit test ejb&#39;s without any sort of extensions like cactus or junitee or etc.\nCan JUnit test Ejb&#39;s on IBMWebsphere.\n\nplease help\n\n------------ --------- --------- ---\nSneak preview the all-new Yahoo.com.
