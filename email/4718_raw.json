This tool has a strong component orientation and runs\nJUnit tests. So in the case you described you would compose your\nhigher-level tests from lower-level test components that themselves are\nbased on existing JUnit tests, using test data to drive the flow if\nnecessary. Since this is a JUnit group and not a Test Mentor group, I will\nrefrain from going into more detail, but I would be happy to do so off-line.\n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nMike Silverstein\nSilverMark, Inc.\nThe object testing company\nhttp://www.javatesting.com\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: erikstunkat [mailto:eriks@...]\n&gt; Sent: Friday, April 19, 2002 7:26 AM\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: [junit] Re: junit tests and functional/ integration tests\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Bill\n&gt;\n&gt; We have junit tests and java property files. They run in a specific\n&gt; sequence and get their data from the property files. That is fine for\n&gt; completed tests.\n&gt; But we need something like a workflow in the tests; eg. test1 creates\n&gt; something in the database and test x uses the same data to verify\n&gt; some additional testcases.\n&gt; We started to examine jxunit, unfortunately it is not that well\n&gt; documented..\n&gt;\n&gt; cheers\n&gt;\n&gt; erik\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In junit@y..., &quot;Bill Laird&quot; &lt;wlaird@w...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Hi Erik - I&#39;m not quite sure what you are trying to say. Unit tests\n&gt; in the classic sense are mutually exclusive from functional tests.\n&gt; There may be some overlap in coverage, but there is no union of test\n&gt; cases.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Is what you are trying to say is that you want to use Junit as a\n&gt; framework and harness for black box functional testing of Java API&#39;s?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Cheers,\n&gt; &gt; Bill\n&gt; &gt;   ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; &gt;   From: erikstunkat\n&gt; &gt;   To: junit@y...\n&gt; &gt;   Sent: Wednesday, April 17, 2002 4:26 AM\n&gt; &gt;   Subject: [junit] junit tests and functional/ integration tests\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   Hi,\n&gt; &gt;   I know that unit tests should run on their own and every test\n&gt; should\n&gt; &gt;   be executable of its own - but..\n&gt; &gt;   we want to use unit tests for a QA related functional framework\n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt;   we yet defined some tasks with ant to run tests in a specific\n&gt; order.\n&gt; &gt;   My question: is there any extension for junit to define\n&gt; properties\n&gt; &gt;   for tests in a more straightforward way then java properties\n&gt; files\n&gt; &gt;   (xml?) and to combine several unit tests with global attributes\n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt;   properties?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   thanks in advance!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   erik stunkat\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;         Yahoo!
