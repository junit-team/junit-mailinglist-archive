E.g.: run all  tests that are not in (a) certain category(s)? =\r\nThis is probably not difficult add in one way or another onto the concept o=\r\nf categories, but the answer to &quot;which test is now acctually included&quot; coul=\r\nd become confusing in cases where a test is in an included and an excluded =\r\ncategory. I would like to see something here that does not require a lot of=\r\n browsing through hierarchies of suites nad categories. This may in my appr=\r\noach not well solved either as suites can extend on other suites: if a refe=\r\nrenced suite includes a certain test, it is executed even if the extending =\r\nsuite excludes a test.\n\nAnd more fundamentally: is the idea/need of exclusi=\r\non meaningfull or just a result of badly organising tests (I&#39;d say no, but =\r\nI may be wrong)? \n\nCheers,\n  Georg\n \n\n\n",
