But first you have to decide which aspect(s) of the gui\n&gt; &gt;&gt; you want to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; test. For many people, making the gui so stupid that it can&#39;t\n&gt; &gt;&gt; possibly break\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; That is in fact the way I do it. But one problem I had was \n&gt; that my model\n&gt; &gt; worked alright,\n&gt; &gt; but when the GUI components attached themselves as \n&gt; listeners, some things\n&gt; &gt; didn&#39;t work anymore...\n&gt; &gt; (Such as the collection of listeners being modified during \n&gt; iteration to\n&gt; &gt; update the listeners)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Can you state the problem in a few lines of code?\n&gt; \n&gt; \nThe problem is solved, but I gave it just as an example of what can go\nwrong.\n\nBut to elaborate a bit (situation simplified to the bare essentials): \na ContainerObject is created and added to a set, which triggers an event of\ntype &quot;object added&quot; starting from a top level object of type Design. \nThe Gui detects that and creates a ContainerObjectView instance on the\nContainerObject and then registers that view as a listener to the Design\ninstance. The java.util.Set of listeners has an object added (the\nContainerObjectView instance) while there is still an java.util.Iterator in\nuse over the Design&#39;s listeners, which causes a\nConcurrentModificationException.\nThe tricky bit is that this will never happen when the Gui is not attached\nas a listener to the Design.\nThe solution is to clone the Set or to use toArray(), and iterating over the\ncopy instead.\n\n\n",
