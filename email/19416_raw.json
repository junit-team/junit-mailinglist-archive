However, we also have test code\nthat is no=\r\nt using JUnit in the /test tree. Eclipse doesn&#39;t care, but\nrunning the test=\r\ns using Ant with batchtest generates exceptions for all\nthe classes not usi=\r\nng JUnit. We don&#39;t want to have the failures in the\ntest results, but also =\r\ndon&#39;t want to store test code in /src.\n\nWhat is the best practice in this s=\r\nituation?
