From what I understand, a Filter may be appropriate for\nyour\nrequirement.\n\nBye, Jochen\n\nOn 12/13/06, Vietchau Nguyen &lt;vietchau.nguyen@...\n&lt;mailto:vietchau.nguyen%40eedo.com&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello,\n&gt;\n&gt; I am new to JUnit and I am currently exploring the new verion, JUnit\n&gt; 4.1. I need to create unit tests for QA and they require an option to\n&gt; select which test to run at runtime. I know that there is the @Ignore\n&gt; but it need to be hard code at compile time... so I wonder if there is\n&gt; any other option in JUnit to let users specifies at runtime which\ntests\n&gt; to run? I saw the extension package, which have @Prerequisite\nannotation\n&gt; and will let me create a method eg. IsDBAvailable But I tried to have\n&gt; parameters to the method, eg. RunThisTest(String testName) and it\nwould\n&gt; not allow me to do so. .. I have too many test cases and I don&#39;t want\nto\n&gt; have to write a separate function for each of them. Any suggestion on\n&gt; how to skip a test at runtime is appreciated.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thank you so much in advance,\n&gt;\n&gt; Vietchau\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n \n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
