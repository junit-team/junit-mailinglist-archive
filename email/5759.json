For example you should probably have Acceptance Tests.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>At least! This helps explain why our business sponsor smiles at our demos! She&#39;s seeing what she asked for! :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; So, I know that I will be using a combination of Jtest and<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Junit for a long time to come. If you write optimal code<br/>\n&gt;&gt; without the need for automated testing tools, then I salute you! :-)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Who said that the only alternative to not using JTest was to use no<br/>\n&gt;automated testing tool at all?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Got me there! :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;BTW, are you developing test-first?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>On a good day. Some aspects of web applications are very difficult to test and I keep meaning to learn how to use MockObjects, to get better test coverage.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I would actually interpret these exceptions as an indication<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;of some extra guard conditions and more defensive programming<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;needed within the tested code. If a piece of called code<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;cannot handle unexpected inputs, then the fault lies with the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;code and not the inputs. :-)<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;I disagree. If the input violates a precondition, the fault<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;lies with the input, by definition.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; I wholeheartedly disagree with you. It makes no difference<br/>\n&gt;&gt; what your &quot;contract&quot; is between a piece of software and it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;&gt; callers, if the software doesn&#39;t check it&#39;s own inputs then<br/>\n&gt;&gt; it is at fault.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Mhh, I wasn&#39;t talking about the input to the software, but about the<br/>\n&gt;input from internal components to internal components. Would you agree<br/>\n&gt;that precondition possibly isn&#39;t that critical there?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I agree that it most likely isn&#39;t critical there. However, that would be a decision that the development team / business sponsor could change if the system was critical enough.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Regards, Ilja<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Simon<br/>\n<br/>\n-----------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nSimon P.
