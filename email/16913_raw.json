It&#39;s beta version was available for donwloads several=\r\n weeks ago. There was few modifications in the final version, most of the e=\r\nffort was in the full documentation of the source-code. The project now is =\r\ntargeting in it&#39;s divulgation in the developer community of Java ME and the=\r\n creation of the 1.1 version, with many improvements and some features to J=\r\nava ME. The JMUnit is totally based in the xUnit, been a library for unit t=\r\nesting similar to JUnit, but for Java Micro Edition. It main advantages are=\r\n simplicity, been easy to use and a library that really helps the mobile ap=\r\nplication developers. It has two versions, one for each version of the CLDC=\r\n, and it&#39;s open-source. It&#39;s the first of a some of possible open-source pr=\r\nojects with the purpose of get better the job of the programmers in that pl=\r\nataform. In the future, maybe, you&#39;ll receive more news about them.\n\n _____=\r\n_____________________________________________\nFale com seus amigos  de gra=\r\n=E7a com o novo Yahoo!
