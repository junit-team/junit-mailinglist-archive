Your questions regarding Borland products \nare better answered in the according newsgroup that can be found at \nhttp://info.borland.com/newsgroups/\n\nYou need to set the fixture to &quot;RECORD&quot; for the first time for the \nrecorder to save the output.  After that, you can change the code to use \nCOMPARE.  Please refer to the tutorial on Comparison Fixture that comes \nwith JBuilder\n\nThanks\nShane\n\n-- \nDisclaimer:  I join all the news groups out of my own interest.

What I want to do is to save some data in a file and then\n&gt;later compare it with other results.\n&gt;\n&gt;I set the comparisonFixture to COMPARE  but then the test gives an error\n&gt;at the method comparisonFixture.recordObject(Object o)like this:\n&gt;\n&gt;java.lang.NoSuchFieldError: e\n&gt;\tat com.borland.jbuilder.unittest.TestRecorder.a(Unknown Source)\n&gt;\tat com.borland.jbuilder.unittest.TestRecorder.recordObject(Unknown Source)\n&gt;\tat com.borland.jbuilder.unittest.TestRecorder.compareObject(Unknown Source)\n&gt;\n&gt;OK, I guess to use that method the mode has to be RECORD. The new data will be\n&gt;then saved in the file and then I&#39;ll loose the previous one, which one I wanted\n&gt;to compare it!!! \n&gt;\n&gt;Is there a way to record some data, and later compare the new results whith it??\n&gt;\n&gt;Please if you have some experience with ComparisionFixture, and understand what\n&gt;Im trying to explain, give some ideas!!!\n&gt;\n&gt;Thanks !!\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt;junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;Your use of Yahoo!
