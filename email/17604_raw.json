B. Rainsberger wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt;  &gt; Elliotte, I don&#39;t understand this article.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; You say that there was a bug in this code:\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; private void _setType(Type type) {\n&gt;  &gt; this.type = type;\n&gt;  &gt; }\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; This bug caused a NullPointerException to occur. I don&#39;t see how that&#39;s\n&gt;  &gt; possible, since &quot;this&quot; cannot be null.\n&gt; \n&gt; Either you misread or I miswrote the article (or both). The bug was not\n&gt; that a NullPointerException was thrown. The bug was that a\n&gt; NullPointerException was *not* thrown when the client passed in null to\n&gt; the public API.\n\nCool. I definitely misunderstood that, then, although you might share \nthe blame. :)\n\n&gt; Once pointed out, it was obviously a bug. XOM doesn&#39;t allow most things\n&gt; to be null, and indeed promises they aren&#39;t. Prior to writing the test,\n&gt; I devised an incorrect solution to the problem that put the null check\n&gt; in the wrong place (the non-public method). Writing the test suddenly\n&gt; made it apparent that my solution was wrong, and that I needed to put\n&gt; the null-check elsewhere (the public method). Had I not written the test\n&gt; before fixing the bug, I likely would not have noticed this.\n\nAbsolutely. That I both get and love.\n\n&gt; TDD isn&#39;t just about testing. It&#39;s also about helping you look at your\n&gt; own code from a different angle. Sometimes that helps you see things you\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t otherwise notice.\n\nI couldn&#39;t agree more! Yet another reason to write tests.\n-- \nJ. B.
