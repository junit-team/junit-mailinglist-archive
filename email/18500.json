It<br/>\nhas more features, makes very clever use of generics and has much better<br/>\nstatic typing than JMock (where you still specify methods with Strings).<br/>\n<br/>\nI would suggest trying both thoroughly before making a choice.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nCedric<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://testng.org\">http://testng.org</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 12/2/06, David Saff &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:saff@...\">saff@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On 12/1/06, Jeff Langr &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jeff@...\">jeff@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I experimented with one of the frameworks a good while ago.

I was one of several users pushing for this, but now that it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; here, I have mixed feelings about it.  I tend to believe the main<br/>\n&gt; issue isn&#39;t the generics themselves, but unnecessarily poor type<br/>\n&gt; inference from current compilers.  This is an orthogonal issue, with<br/>\n&gt; the same kinds of benefits and drawbacks that would come from<br/>\n&gt; declaring assertEquals as<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; public &lt;T&gt; void assertEquals(T expected, T actual).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Have fun,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    David Saff<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
