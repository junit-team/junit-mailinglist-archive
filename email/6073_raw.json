It is about a new tool with \nthe same name but different background. \n\nJUnitDoclet 1.0.1 ( http://www.junitdoclet.org/ ) does \ngenerate and maintain skeletons of TestCases and TestSuites \nbased on the structure of your application and some \ntemplates. Unlike some other tools it has build-in concepts\nto support refactoring. So it is very easy to keep the \ntests in sync whenever the application structure changes. \n\nMaybe the most significant effect of JUnitDoclet is to \nkeep the developer focused on the problem. There is no \ninterruption when trying to remember the syntax of a \nTestCase. ;-) With very few clicks / keystrokes the \nTestCase is there. If it is that easy, you&#39;ll find yourself \nwriting more tests very soon.\n\nPlease visit http://www.junitdoclet.org/ to learn more \nabout this tool. There you&#39;ll find:\n\n * an online demo (See it in action before you install.),\n * FAQ,\n * user feedback,\n * the article &quot;Testing Without Excuses&quot;,\n * a download section and \n * much more (like the JUnitDoclet from Robert Watkins) \n\nThe downloads include examples how to integrate JUnitDoclet \nas external tool to IDEA and Eclipse as well as a more \ngeneric approach for other IDE&#39;s and editors. Of course \nthere is a readme for installing as ANT target too. \n\nWe believe JUnitDoclet does lower the step toward JUnit \nand relieves developers from routine work. At the same \ntime, the developer stays in control. While developing \nwe followed a very simple rule: \n\n  JUnitDoclet is standing at your side, not in your way.\n\nIf you like that, please tell others about it.\n\nRegards,\n\nSteffen Gemkow\n\n\n\n\n",
