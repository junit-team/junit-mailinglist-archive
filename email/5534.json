Two months is more like it for this <br/>\nmany classes.  I have done moderate size packages in a day.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd yes, the QA&#39;s should not be writing JUnit code.  I have seen them <br/>\ncompose test cases or at least sign off on test case development when a <br/>\nVisual Composition version is provided for them.  They don&#39;t see the code, <br/>\njust icons and parameters in a tree like structure that they easily <br/>\nunderstand.<br/>\n<br/>\nTest Mentor is ready for prime time in these two aspects, at least based on <br/>\nour experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe price is rather attractive.  We had an ROI in one case of about 2 weeks. <br/>\n(Cost saving model.)  And of course some things are not possible for QA&#39;s <br/>\nand customers at any price without such technology.  That leave only the <br/>\n&quot;hire a black belt&quot; option or do without.  Both tough choices in a <br/>\nrecession.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Vladimir Bossicard&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:vbossica@...\">vbossica@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: RE: [junit] How to automate the testcases!<br/>\n&gt;Date: Mon, 05 Aug 2002 08:37:49 -0700 (PDT)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I want to test a library containing more than 1000 classes and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; lots of methods.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;m sure you don&#39;t &#39;want&#39; but &#39;have to&#39; test this library :-)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Let&#39;s not mention that JUnit is primilarly entended for programmers and not <br/>\n&gt;QAs<br/>\n&gt;(no offense, I just want to say that if QAs are the ones starting to use <br/>\n&gt;JUnit,<br/>\n&gt;something&#39;s wrong in the project).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;In your place, I would go to your manager and expose the fact that testing<br/>\n&gt;1,000 classes will take you months if not years.  If he wants to ship in <br/>\n&gt;two<br/>\n&gt;years, fine... but I bet it&#39;s not what he wants.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I can&#39;t imagine that the developers spend all their time writing code <br/>\n&gt;without<br/>\n&gt;some kind of testing.  Chances are that some test code has been written <br/>\n&gt;(just<br/>\n&gt;pray that developers haven&#39;t only used &#39;println&#39;) so try to reuse their <br/>\n&gt;code<br/>\n&gt;into JUnit tests and (even better) try to convince your manager to let the<br/>\n&gt;developers do this.  You can then run a code coverage tool to have a look <br/>\n&gt;where<br/>\n&gt;the code has not been tested.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;If you want to do negative testing (since it&#39;s a library, it must be pretty<br/>\n&gt;solid) JUnit may not be the best tool for this.  But you can write some<br/>\n&gt;extensions that test that a class is not crashing.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-Vladimir<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--<br/>\n&gt;Vladimir Bossicard<br/>\n&gt;www.bossicard.com<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Your use of Yahoo!
