Rainsberger&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jbr@...\">jbr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If the interface isn&#39;t allowed to change, then we have a real problem.<br/>\n&gt; Software changes. Any time change is painful, change is discouraged.<br/>\n&gt; When change is discouraged, we reduce the likelihood of delivering the<br/>\n&gt; right software. My mission is to deliver the right software, so when<br/>\n&gt; the interface isn&#39;t allowed to change, I can&#39;t do my job.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWell of course, all things need to change from time to time, and should be<br/>\nallowed to do so - but constantly changing interfaces, or interfaces that<br/>\nchange drastically, are an indication that there is something wrong - either<br/>\nin the process or in the code. I am not saying that interfaces shouldn&#39;t be<br/>\nallowed to change, but at some point they should become stable - and that<br/>\npoint is usually reached long before an independent unit tester get&#39;s their<br/>\nhands on the unit.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; So explain to me the difference between what you describe and Pair<br/>\n&gt; Programming combined with TDD. Is it just that other programmers are,<br/>\n&gt; on their own, writing tests for my stuff after I&#39;ve written it?<br/>\n<br/>\nThere can be. As with all things, team structure, process and methodology<br/>\ncan be tweaked to suit the team and the project. As you stated, TDD is not<br/>\nprimarily meant to find bugs, whereas independent unit testing is very good<br/>\nat that, and generally that is its primary purpose; early testing. If you<br/>\nhave an XP team that is so good that they write perfect code, and a *good*<br/>\nindependent unit tester can&#39;t find any bugs in the code, then don&#39;t use<br/>\nindependent unit testers and more power to you. But I have yet to see such a<br/>\nteam or such developers - and I feel fairly confident that I could write<br/>\nunit tests that would find significant bugs in just about any new codebase<br/>\nunder development - including a codebase developed using TDD.<br/>\n<br/>\nFWIW,<br/>\nLauren<br/>\n<br/>\n=====<br/>\nLooking for an experienced Java/C++ Software Engineer?<br/>\nSee: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://developerdude.mystarband.net/resume.html\">http://developerdude.mystarband.net/resume.html</a> </span></blockquote></div>",
