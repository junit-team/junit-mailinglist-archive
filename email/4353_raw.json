For those that take this\n&gt;approach to development, they would probably want a\n&gt;test for each method.\n\nI&#39;m sorry to be blunt, but absolutely not.\n\nIn TFP, the goal is to test every feature -- that is, every bit of behavior \nyou care about. Implementation details are unimportant and, in fact, testing \nthem on their own often impedes refactoring. Since tests are meant to \nprovide the &quot;safety net&quot; during refactoring, they should try not to get in \nthe way of refactoring, if they can avoid it.\n\nIf you have one feature that uses four or five private methods behind a \nsingle public method, then it&#39;s best simply to test the public method. If \nyou find a bug in there, then that may be a clue about your design: perhaps \nwhat you perceive as an implementation detail is something bigger that \nshould be in its own class. At that point, the method becomes public and \nvoila, you can test it. (Or package-level, if you prefer that route and \nplace your tests in the same package as the production code.)\n\n&quot;A test for each method&quot; is a bad thing. &quot;Tests for each feature or service&quot; \nis a Good Thing.\n\nJ.
