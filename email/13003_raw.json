I know the issues, and I&#39;m not\n&gt; trying to force you to type too much.\n\nOh, I&#39;m not offended or anything of the sort.  I&#39;m just chuckling that\nyou and I specifically have discussed this issue before.  I&#39;m a quick\ntypist, and I ought to be: I have all this practice from documenting\nmy test methods and assert statements!  :)\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Just like the test name often needs further clarification (never pass\n&gt; &gt; up an oportunity for documentation), often the reason for the\n&gt; &gt; assertion is not self-apparent.  You can try to argue that &quot;it ought\n&gt; &gt; to be, or rewrite your code!&quot; but, as before, I think you&#39;re straying\n&gt; &gt; too close to the &quot;Java code is self-documenting&quot; argument, which I\n&gt; &gt; find ... dubious at best.\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t know. I just wrote this in an XHTMLUnit test today:\n&gt; \n&gt; assertXpathExists(\n&gt;      somewhereThereIsA(formNamed(&quot;demographics&quot;))\n&gt;      .eventuallyContainingA(textFieldNamed(&quot;firstName&quot;)), document);\n&gt; \n&gt; This translated to the XPath expression\n&gt; \n&gt;      //form[@name=&quot;demographics&quot;]//input[@type=&quot;text&quot; and @name=&quot;firstName&quot;]\n&gt; \n&gt; Is a comment or a failure message going to make that clearer?\n\nI haven&#39;t had a need for XHTMLUnit, I&#39;m mostly commenting about\nvanilla JUnit usage.  That said, what message does the above generate\nin your error report?\n\n&gt;&gt; Or to put it pithily:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I feel that I&#39;m proficient with Java, but when I want to explain\n&gt; &gt; something, especially *why* something, I generally prefer English.\n&gt; \n&gt; I agree and explain &quot;why&quot; in English, but nost of the time, test case\n&gt; class name, method name and line number is enough for me to know what\n&gt; failed, from which I generally can determine why it failed. If not, then\n&gt; my tests are too big (and that&#39;s an entirely different problem).\n\nDo you have the same experience with tests you&#39;re not the author of? \nThis is where I&#39;ve found it especially helpful, or frustrating if it\ndoesn&#39;t exist.  Of course *my* logic and reasoning is always obvious,\nit&#39;s those other punks that write stuff I can&#39;t understand. \n(sarcasm!)\n\nThese additional comments have also been helpful if I&#39;m debugging a\nsection I neither wrote, nor studied the original requirements.  An\nexample of that situation is code written for features implemented\nbefore I joined the proeject.\n\n-Kevin\n\n",
