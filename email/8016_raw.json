B. Rainsberger&quot; &lt;jbrains@r...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Mike Bowler got me in the habit of using &#39;final&#39; where possible, so \n&gt; I asked him to read the article. Here is his response.\n\n\n&gt; &gt;My main reason for using final is to better explain my *intent* to \n&gt; &gt;the compiler.\n\nShould you be worried about the compiler?  Shouldn&#39;t your focus be on\nexpressing your intent to other programmers.\n\n&gt; &gt;  This gives the compiler the opportunity to....\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;1) Provide better warning messages when I make a mistake\n\n\n&gt; &gt;2) Generate faster code\n\nThis is a total non-issue... at kleast until it becomes an issue.  You\nshouldn&#39;t be trying to outthink the compiler.  See Bill Venner&#39;s\ninterview with Martin Fowler at artima.com  (the last part of it I think)\n\n&gt; &gt;The first is significantly more important to me than the second.  \n\nWhy?  It&#39;s been a long time since I&#39;ve even looked at compiler output.\n Eclipse pointes me at the problem.  It&#39;s my test failure messages\nthat are the critical thing.\n\nDave\n\n\n",
