That library&#39;s outcomes is used by the presentation layer which is written in another programming language.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;r functionally testing the library. Also, we&#39;r testing the UI through interaction tests.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, we&#39;ve found that, we&#39;r writing the same scenarios and expectations for those tests. If we try to reuse the scenarios this adds to the obscurity of tests. Or the reverse is duplication of the scenarios.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you have recommendation about how can we reuse the same scenarios both for functional and interaction tests that are separate environments?</div>",
