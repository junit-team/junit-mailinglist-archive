For example, the JUnit Web page seems to have had few<br/>\n&gt; updates since 2003. And on SourceForge, Erich Gamma and Kent Beck<br/>\n&gt; responded to some GUI-related RFEs with the comment that because most<br/>\n&gt; IDEs now handle test running themselves, there&#39;s no point to improving<br/>\n&gt; JUnit&#39;s own GUI tools. Non-interface bug reports and RFEs have gone<br/>\n&gt; unassigned unless they&#39;re of very high priority (such as ones related to<br/>\n&gt; thread safety). Is there simply no real demand for improvements, or has<br/>\n&gt; the SourceForge bug report page been deprecated?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s an ongoing debate in the community. I honestly believe that the <br/>\nJUnit framework is closed (in the Open/Closed Principle sense), even if <br/>\nthe test runners are occasionally inadequate. Since I use Eclipse&#39;s test <br/>\nrunner most of the time and Ant&#39;s the rest of the time, that&#39;s not an <br/>\nissue for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nJUnit 4.0, complete with support for Java annotations, is in the works, <br/>\nbut I don&#39;t know any more than that.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ.
