The\nonly difference is that while writing Unit tests you will have to write\npseudo Classes, that a method you are testing, refers to, while in\nIntegration testing you replace these pseudo classes by the actual classes.\nIn unit testing you control the input that will come from the interacting\nclasses while in integration testing the values are actually\ncomputed/fetched by the objects/classes.\n\nThere are two cases:\n\nFirst, when you have been writing unit tests for each class in JUnit from\nthe start. In this case the &quot;Test suite&quot; that includes test classes will\nserve the purpose you are looking for in integration testing framework.\n\nSecond, you have not written any tests for your classes till now and now you\nneed to change a class that interacts with other classes. In this case I\nwill suggest you to write test cases for this class and test it thoroughly.\nNext you will need to trace the interaction of this class (maybe from the\ndesign document) with other classes and write test to ensure that the\nrequirements are met.\n\nIf the system design is OO and the design document is well done, all you\nwill need to understand are the responsibilities of this class of objects\nand modify accordingly.\n\nRegards,\n\nSachin\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: selena su [mailto:selena.su@...]\nSent: Wednesday, February 21, 2001 10:22 AM\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: Re: [junit] Integration Testing Framework.\n\n\nThanks for your prompt reply gupta. How is it being done for the integration\ntesting in JUnit ? Is there any references i can refer to ?\n\nI have gone through the &quot;Programmer Love Writing Tests&quot; but it only interact\nwith only one class ! My worry how can i ensure that my updated class is\nworking\nfine when it put into production machine ? It would be better if any\nframework\nthat allows me to trace the intergration if any !\n\nthanks,\nselena\n\n\nsachin gupta wrote:\n\n&gt; Hello ,\n&gt;\n&gt; Yu can use JUnit for integration testing as well.
