I have written a\n&gt; library\n&gt; of which I need to test one class. The methods exposed by this class\n&gt; cannot be called randomly but by following some rules. For example,\n&gt; there is a method &quot;Connect&quot; which must be invoked before any other\n&gt; method is called. There are additional calls that are related. For\n&gt; example &quot;ChangeHeaders&quot; makes temporary change to some data (after\n&gt; some business logic verification), however this must be followed by a\n&gt; call to &quot;SaveChanges&quot; to persist this data. Whatever I have read\n&gt; about\n&gt; JUnit seems to indicate that the test methods in my test class can be\n&gt; called in any order by the JUnit framework. Is there any way (a\n&gt; pattern) to get around this issue ? Thanks much in advance..\n\nThe order of your test methods does not have any bearing on the order in \nwhich your production code methods are invoked. Each test can be \nindependent of the others, but still invoke the production code in the \ncorrect order.\n\nCan you sketch a test or two that you can&#39;t see how to write? We could \ncritique that/give you better suggestions.\n-- \nJ. B.
