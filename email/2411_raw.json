[...]\n&gt;\n&gt;In retrospect, I can come up with a characterization of the problem\n&gt;and say that I made certain assumptions about the behavior of the\n&gt;sockets API.  Given that was the case, it would have been prudent of\n&gt;me to write (very simple) test cases that verify those assumptions,\n&gt;and run them on both plain and SSL sockets.  These tests, of course,\n&gt;would be very simple, and wouldn&#39;t involve any of my product code.\n&gt;\n&gt;Presumably if I tested the assumptions correctly in both cases, then I\n&gt;wouldn&#39;t have to test my code in both of its configurations (since\n&gt;from its point of view it&#39;s not really doing anything different in the\n&gt;two different cases).\n&gt;\n&gt;Is this another form of testing (&quot;Assumption Testing&quot;)?  Or perhaps\n&gt;another way to look at it is that I&#39;m a &quot;customer&quot; of the SSL library\n&gt;provider, and I need to have my own &quot;Acceptance Test&quot; of the\n&gt;functionality that I expect it to provide?\n\nYour tests of a third-party API are your acceptance tests of that API.
