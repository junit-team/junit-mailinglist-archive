I have not tried\n&gt; &gt; running from command line, nor fro=\r\nm within Eclipse, which obviously\n&gt; &gt; implies not running from a debugger. =\r\nI am not sure how I would do that\n&gt; &gt; in Eclipse, to tell you the truth. I =\r\nhave never done this, but see my\n&gt; &gt; junit recipes book discusses running t=\r\nests from within eclipse. I&#39;ll\n&gt; &gt; give that a try later today.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nHow&#39;d that go?\n&gt; \n&gt; \nHaven&#39;t tried, yet. Still really busy cleaning up afte=\r\nr one migration\nwhile trying to complete another migration. Ow! I thought I=\r\n&#39;d have\ntime yesterday, but... Anyway, I&#39;ll probably give it a shot over th=\r\ne\nweekend.\n\n&gt; I did comment out the various AllTests and found the offender=\r\n. That\n&gt; &gt; AllTest only executed one test. So, I added a target for the one=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; offending test class. When running that, the response is the same as\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; below. It appears to be not running the test at all.\n&gt; \n&gt; \nIn the heat o=\r\nf things yesterday, I did trigger my AllTest that had the\noffending sub All=\r\nClass&#39;s commented out. This had worked in the past\nbut it seems it did not =\r\nyesterday. However, I cannot be sure. Testing\nwasn&#39;t critical at the moment=\r\n (I had meant to call a different target\nto jar and deploy), so I didn&#39;t re=\r\nsearch. Possibly I was mistaken\nabout the state of the test.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Can you =\r\nshare anything about the test class that is causing the pain?\n&gt; \nAssuming I=\r\n am correct in identifying the failing class, no, there is\nnothing really s=\r\nignificant about the class. I have one test. It\nreturns an int. I assert th=\r\nat the value returned is what is expected.\nThe underlying class, likewise, =\r\nis nothing very special. Testing via\nother means demonstrates that it works=\r\n just fine.\n\nThe problem has to be something simple, something obvious, I a=\r\nm\noverlooking. Hmmmm... Unfortunately, there are no other eyes I can\nshare =\r\nwith. I am the only geek here nor have I really developed\nfriendships with =\r\nothers in the java/junit community locally with whom\nI would feel comfortab=\r\nle sitting down with and working through it. I\nguess that is what happens w=\r\nhen one is independent and does not live\nin Silicon Valley ;-)\n\n&gt; Good luck=\r\n,\n&gt; \n&gt;    David Saff\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been r=\r\nemoved]\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n",
