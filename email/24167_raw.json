Assertions (and mocks) have especially\n&gt; contorted themselves in ways that they might finally now be able to relax.\n\nYes, assertions could probably get much benefit from lambdas.\n\nI support the idea of having assertions as a separate library which is \ndecoupled from the testing framework (the same way as Hamcrest, \nFEST-Assert and probably others). The testing framework would then focus \nfully on the test execution model (e.g. test isolation, execution order, \nrules and other metaprogramming).\n\nThere is wide variablity in how assertions can be done (especially in \ndifferent languages). I don&#39;t have strong opinions about what an assert \nshould be like, and seems that there are as many kinds of asserts as \nthere are testing frameworks.\n\nThere is less variablity in testing frameworks&#39; execution model, but \nthose differences are often at a more fundamental level (e.g. test \nisolation vs. shared state). I and others hold strong opinions about them.\n\nThus I would like to be able to mix and match the frameworks and \nassertions separately, sometimes even using multiple assertion libraries \nin the same test.\n\n\n&gt;    - The fact that a Description is both the immutable single name of a test\n&gt; node, and a mutable builder for the test structure, and then later an\n&gt; immutable reference for the test structure, is exasperating.\n&gt;    - The reliance on reflectively-discovered constructors for extensibility\n&gt; causes some awkwardness.\n&gt;    - The IDE-centric idea that one should be enable to enumerate all tests\n&gt; before any is run places some binding constraints, and should be at most\n&gt; optional in a world in which tests are often run by daemons many more times\n&gt; a day than by humans.\n\nI&#39;ve noticed those as well. I&#39;ve already addressed each of those in Jumi:\n\n- A testing framework must assign a unique immutable TestId for each \ntest in a test class, which is then used to send events of when the test \nwas started, finished, failed etc. The TestId implies a tree structure \nof tests (to be used in test result reports). Everything is expressed as \nimmutable events (Jumi relies heavily on Event Sourcing). See details at \nhttp://jumi.fi/api/jumi-api/fi/jumi/api/drivers/SuiteNotifier.html\n\n- The fi.jumi.api.drivers.Driver which corresponds \norg.junit.runner.Runner requires a zero-argument constructor. The test \nclass et al is passed as method argument to \nhttp://jumi.fi/api/jumi-api/fi/jumi/api/drivers/Driver.html#findTests\n\n- Jumi starts executing tests as soon as possible, at both the suite and \ntest class levels. At suite level, test class execution starts \nasynchronously before all test classes are discovered (i.e. before Jumi \nhas finished traversing the directories containing test classes). At \ntest class level, more tests can be found during test execution (for \nexample Specsy requires this) and the new test executions can be started \nasynchronously in parallel (depending on the testing framework and \nwhether the user has disabled parallelism for that test class or the \nwhole suite).\n\n\n&gt;    - There are as many perfect models of test status possibilities as there\n&gt; are developers.  Passed/Failed?  Passed/Failed/Skipped?\n&gt;   Passed/Failed/Ignored, etc.  The current design bakes one required system\n&gt; pretty deep into the internals, unnecessarily.\n\nThat&#39;s been on my mind for a long time, but I haven&#39;t yet figured out a \ngood way to support all the variations, so I&#39;m deferring the decision. I \nwould love to hear your ideas.\n\nA very flexible way would be to allow tagging tests with arbitrary \nkeywords, but then the problem will be that how each of those keywords \nshould affect the user interface. There would have to be at least some \nkeywords with specific meaning, which brings us back to the original \nquestion of which states to support.\n\nTo get started we could list all the variations in use today and the use \ncases for using each of them (e.g. it&#39;s an acceptance tests for a \nfeature which has not yet been implemented). I&#39;m hoping there to be 5 or \nless different reasons that are served by test statuses.\n\n\n&gt; Now, should the framework to which I&#39;d contribute time to fix these\n&gt; problems be called JUnit 5, or something entirely different?  That&#39;s\n&gt; another kettle of fish, with some interesting options to consider.  Looks\n&gt; like we have at least 9 months to consider them at length.\n\n9 months, like giving birth to a baby. I suppose the names of quite many \npeople have been pondered for that long. :)\n\nJUnit&#39;s name is well known, so it&#39;s a marketing bonus. On the other \nhand, the software industry moves quickly and good technology can get \npopular regardless of its name.\n\n-- \nEsko Luontola\nwww.orfjackal.net\n\n",
