It&#39;s all automated unit testing: automating unit tests.\n\nWhat Parasoft does is suggest tests for basic, generic boundary \nconditions. It&#39;s useful for testing legacy code.\n\nWhat Agitar does includes (but is not limited to) identifying behavioral \ninvariants for code, making it easy to promote those to assertions in \nJUnit tests. The idea appears to be that if something is invariant now, \nthen you&#39;d like it to be invariant from this day forward, so put it in a \ntest. This looks absolutely /killer/ for testing legacy code.\n\n&gt;   I would like some feedback: what are the pro&#39;s and con&#39;s of these\n&gt; solutions?  Are there other solutions?  What types of companies would\n&gt; benefit from either of these?  What are the risks or downsides of\n&gt; using these systems?  Do you recommend either TDD or AUT and why?\n\nI have no experience with Parasoft&#39;s or Agitar&#39;s products, /however/ I \nknow others who do have such experience and am relaying some of that here.\n\nI recommend test-driving all new code. This is especially good for \ngreenfield projects, where /everything/ is new code. The advantages are \nnumerous and well-documented: 100% coverage, simpler cleaner designs, a \nsafety net for changes... the only disadvantage is not really a TDD \nproblem, but a learning problem--you have to learn how to do TDD.\n\nIf you need to add tests to existing code, Agitar&#39;s product looks like \nit would help out immensely in identifying what the product already does \nand making it easier to turn that information into regression tests.\n\nMost projects need to do both: add features (new code) and fix features \n(legacy code), and so I recommend test-driving the new features and \nusing something like Agitar&#39;s product to help add tests to the existing \ncode.\n-- \nJ.
