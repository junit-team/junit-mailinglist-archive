    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1829911726\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Actually, the only claim that was made on this thread was that it  <br/>\n&gt; was<br/>\n&gt; &gt; unprofessional *not* to do TDD all the time or to have less than  <br/>\n&gt; 90% code<br/>\n&gt; &gt; coverage.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m quite happy to stand by that claim.  Over the last 7 years I have  <br/>\ncome to the following conclusions:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. There are no instances in which TDD is impossible.<br/>\n2. There are no instances in which TDD is not advantageous.<br/>\n3. The impediments to TDD are human, not technical.<br/>\n4. The alternative to TDD is code that is not repeatably testable.<br/>\n<br/>\nTherefore I consider TDD to be a minimum professional standard.   <br/>\nDevelopers who do not use TDD fall below that standard.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; My follow-up claim is that anyone who says this has never really  <br/>\n&gt; worked on<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the kind of real-world projects that I (and hundreds of thousands  <br/>\n&gt; of other<br/>\n&gt; &gt; developers out there) are involved in on a daily basis.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m the counter example. I am nearly 54 years old and have  <br/>\nbeen writing code since I was 15.  I still write code of one kind or  <br/>\nanother nearly every day.  I have worked on projects large and small,  <br/>\nembedded and batch, system and application, in sickness and in heath,  <br/>\nand I expect to code till I die.  Like Isaac Asimov used to say, I  <br/>\nwant them to find me with my nose jammed between the keys of my  <br/>\nkeyboard.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m afraid that there are also other counter examples.  I just got  <br/>\nback from consulting with a team of 18 .NET developers working on a  <br/>\nhuge web-based application.  They have code coverage in the 90s, have  <br/>\nunit tests and acceptance tests that are run every build.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake a look at the Rails framework.  This is a web-development  <br/>\nframework that has testing built in from the very start.  Virtually  <br/>\nevery facet of a rails application is intended to be written using  <br/>\nTDD.  The point is that the new hyper-productive frameworks are  <br/>\nadopting TDD from the get-go.<br/>\n<br/>\nTDD is a fundamental change in the minute by minute process of  <br/>\nwriting software.  Many developers are not willing to face that  <br/>\nchange and look for reasons why TDD does not apply to them.  I  <br/>\nbelieve that there are no such reasons.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n----<br/>\nRobert C.
