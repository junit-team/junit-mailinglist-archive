Lucene\nand Solr use a custom runner to randomize test execution extensively.\nThis works great and I&#39;ve decided to try to pull a custom JUnit runner\nout of Lucene so that it can be reused without relying on the rest of\nLucene&#39;s infrastructure. So... I wrote a custom runner and on the way\nI came across a problem: I would really like to have a hierarchy of\nDescriptions to indicate something meaningful, in particular contain\nthe random seed for a suite group, then for individual tests, etc. I\nbelieve a similar situation could also be useful for\nParameterizedRunner...\n\nUnfortunately, the problem is that Description is sealed and does not\nallow much in terms of flexibility (the constructor is private, static\nfactory methods).\n\nThe design of this class leads me to believe that Description should\nbe a contract (interface or a class, but with the possibility of\nsubclassing) so that getDisplayName() returns something meaningful (as\nin the example above), but getTestClass(), getMethodName() and\ngetClassName() can still point IDEs and report writers to the right\nplace. Or at least allow a custom display name not related to the\nmethod name/ class of the test case?\n\nAnother burning issue we have in Lucene is that Assume.* methods don&#39;t\ntake any explanation message. Why is this so? I mean: an assumption\ncan fail, but just like with failures it&#39;d be nice to be actually able\nto explain why a given assumption wasn&#39;t met...\n\nLet me know what you think. I can provide a patch (several ones :),\nbut I wanted to hear what people think first.\n\nDawid\n\n",
