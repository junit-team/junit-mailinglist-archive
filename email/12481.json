    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-334121523\">I just wrote my first TestCase class. Lets call it MyTestCase. It works great by<br/>\nitself. It fakes some data that it will need, then runs through some tests to<br/>\nmake sure everything works right. Great! <br/>\nNow what I want to do is instantiate MyTestCase from another TestCase and have<br/>\nit run through the tests. The reason that I want to do this is because the other<br/>\nTestCase (lets call it AnotherTestCase) is going to feed it the fake data that I<br/>\nwant.  The reason that I want be able to do this because by default I want<br/>\nMyTestCase to run on it&#39;s own fake data with the regular constructor, but I also<br/>\nwant the option to have a list of fake data that I can feed MyTestCase one at a<br/>\ntime so that I test all elements in the list.  So I want to call it externally<br/>\nand instantiate it with each element in the list, and run the tests on that<br/>\ninstance.  I have made a special constructor on MyTestCase for loading the fake<br/>\ndata. Below is the code that I would think that I could put in a test method of<br/>\nAnotherTestCase and have it run the tests of MyTestCase on my instance.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust for clarification this might be in a loop where I iterate through the list<br/>\nand pull out each piece of &quot;FakeData.&quot;  But the whole list thing is only<br/>\nmentioned because that is the reason that I am trying to run tests on a specific<br/>\ninstance in the first place.<br/>\n<br/>\nTestCase ts = new MyTestCase(FakeData);<br/>\nts.run();<br/>\n<br/>\nBut when I execute this code it executes these lines, but ts.run() does not<br/>\ncause the tests in MyTestCase to run. The Setup() of MyTestCase runs, but no<br/>\ntests. What is run used for then, and how do I do what I am trying to do? Even<br/>\nusing the regular constructor no tests are run.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve seen two close solutions posted everywhere, but neither fits my needs:<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve seen that I can set up a static suite method in MyTestCase.  When I do this<br/>\nI can run the tests, but not on the specific MyTestCase that I instantiated. I<br/>\nwant to run the tests for this specific instance that I created. The run() is<br/>\nafter all an instance method. I can&#39;t find any information about how to do this.<br/>\nI must be thinking about this wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have seen where I can overwrite runTest() in MyTestCase and put all the tests<br/>\nin there that I want to run.  Sure it runs the tests from the instance that I<br/>\npopulated with fake data, but there are three big problems with this.<br/>\n* I hate the idea of having to modify runTest() if I add or remove methods.  I<br/>\nlike the reflection where anything named test* runs.  This should be how it<br/>\nworks automatically.  But I can only figure out how to make this run from a test<br/>\nsuite that you instantiate with a class object.  I can&#39;t run my instances that way.<br/>\n* The tests actually run, but setup is only called before the whole group of<br/>\ntests.  Setup and tear down are supposed to run before and after EACH test.  So<br/>\noverriding runTest() in this way is actually breaking the rules of how the tests<br/>\nare expected to run.  For this reason alone I don&#39;t think that anyone should<br/>\never override runTest() in this way.  Sure you can actually put the setup and<br/>\ntear down method calls before and after each test method call.  But come on,<br/>\nwhat happened to having all my tests run automatically by reflection!?!<br/>\n * The output of the tests is not displayed, it is lost, and the test output is<br/>\nonly about the one that is run from AnotherTestCase.  There may be some way to<br/>\nredirect this.  I see how I can get the test results from the run method.  But I<br/>\ndon&#39;t know what to do with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn summary, I just want to send some data to an instance of a TestCase subclass,<br/>\nand run the tests on it.  This should be trivial.  What do I need to do?<br/>\n<br/>\nHelp would be greatly appreciated. <br/>\nThanks <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
