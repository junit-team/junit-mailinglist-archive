The test runner provides one, fairly terse, view:<br/>\nthis test passed, or it failed on this assertion. This is<br/>\nby far the most useful view. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe assertion<br/>\nlog provides a deeper view into the test run, by leveraging<br/>\ninformation about the test run that you&#39;ve already built into<br/>\nyour test cases.

Yes, many people have said they want<br/>\n&gt; to log assertions in tests because they want the warm fuzzy feedback<br/>\n&gt; that their tests are running and assertion what they think they are<br/>\n&gt; asserting. Logging is just one, and in my opinion a bad, way to do<br/>\n&gt; this. I believe it is much better to write simpler tests.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 1) eliminating redundant logging statements - Many logging statements<br/>\n&gt; &gt; in a JUnit test case simply output information that you&#39;ve already<br/>\n&gt; &gt; told JUnit about in your assertions. Developers often put these in as<br/>\n&gt; &gt; a &#39;sanity check&#39; to verify that the test is doing what they expected.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; If your tests need such a sanity check, then I believe they should be<br/>\n&gt; simpler.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 2) improving assertion messages - it&#39;s often the case that the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; first time you see the message for an assertion will be when the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; assertion fails, which may not happen until you run a regression test<br/>\n&gt; &gt; many moons after you coded the test. Unless you see the message<br/>\n&gt; &gt; displayed when you are developing the test, you won&#39;t realize that the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; message - if you provided one - is not be very helpful. Better<br/>\n&gt; &gt; assertion messages also help to communicate to a developer what the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; point of the assertion is both when it fails and when reading the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; test.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; If you aren&#39;t going to think about the failure message when you write<br/>\n&gt; it, then don&#39;t write one.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 3) see finer-grain test results. Every assertion is a mini-test on its<br/>\n&gt; &gt; own, but JUnit these mini-tests are invisible until they fail.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Absolutely not. Assertions are not mini-tests. A test is a test. If<br/>\n&gt; you have multiple unrelated assertions in a test, then move them into<br/>\n&gt; their own tests. This leads to a number of benefits (more accurate<br/>\n&gt; test count metrics, more information when a test fails, easier to<br/>\n&gt; isolate the cause of a failure).<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 4) by making logging easy, it can help to avoid the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; using-system-outs-instead-of-asserts syndrome, where new junit test<br/>\n&gt; &gt; writers will write &quot;test cases&quot; that actually just write a bunch of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; stuff to the console that the test writer then eyeballs for expected<br/>\n&gt; &gt; results<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Why would anyone use JUnit to spit things out to the console? If they<br/>\n&gt; want output on the console, and they&#39;re not just using that as a way<br/>\n&gt; to learn to use JUnit, then they shouldn&#39;t use JUnit.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; There are some problems with logging assertions that I have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; encountered:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 1) if iterating over a collection and asserting each element, your log<br/>\n&gt; &gt; can be overwhelmed. Maybe it would be useful to have some way of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; hinting that a particular assertion should not create notifications;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; maybe not.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t even want to think about how slowly tests will run, and how<br/>\n&gt; much time I would waste deciding which tests should log what and when.<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s much easier just to add logging where I want it.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Is there any appetite out there for adding assertion logging (or<br/>\n&gt; &gt; assertion notification) into the junit 4 framework? I would be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; happy to do the work if I thought it would be accepted into the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; main junit distribution. Or maybe this capability already exists<br/>\n&gt; &gt; in some way in junit 4 that I am not aware of?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yes, there is such an appetite, but I hope there is a bigger appetite<br/>\n&gt; not to include it.<br/>\n&gt; ----<br/>\n&gt; J.
