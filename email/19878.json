And, sometimes, readability trumps duplication.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;    <br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I would be *very* reluctant to accept that. I can&#39;t remember an instance <br/>\n&gt;where, when at first sight it seemed like accepting duplication improved <br/>\n&gt;readability, I couldn&#39;t come up with a more appropriate design that was <br/>\n&gt;both readable and duplication-free.

Out in the field, I notice that many people really aren&#39;t <br/>\nused to finely factored code.  If you are, you can remove duplication <br/>\nall over the place and still not feel that you are sacrificing <br/>\nreadability.  But, if you aren&#39;t used to that style of programming, <br/>\nduplication-free code looks weird and you&#39;re liable to find it less <br/>\nreadable.  It&#39;s a matter of acclimation, really.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wrote a related blog on finely factored code a while ago here: <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://beautifulcode.oreillynet.com/2007/07/finegrained_factoring.php\">http://beautifulcode.oreillynet.com/2007/07/finegrained_factoring.php</a><br/>\n<br/>\nMichael Feathers<br/>\nwww.objectmentor.com</div>",
