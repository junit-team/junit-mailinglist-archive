The &quot;catch&quot; is that I have=\r\n to\n&gt; contribute testing-related examples - in other words: beautiful test\n=\r\n&gt; code.\n&gt;\n&gt; I already have some ideas of what to cover, but I thought some =\r\nof the\n&gt; people in this group might have some examples of tests that they\n&gt;=\r\n consider particularly &quot;beautiful&quot; or clever in their approach.\n&gt;\n&gt; I think=\r\n it&#39;s great that developer testing has reached the point that\n&gt; some author=\r\ns/editors thought of including testing in such a book, and\n&gt; I want to make=\r\n sure I pick the best possible example(s) to pick from.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt;\n&gt; Alb=\r\nerto\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
