What I mean is=\r\n this. I tried using\n&gt; &gt; the batchtest task which is severely limited. It o=\r\nnly does a directory\n&gt; &gt; scan over my test source to pick up the test class=\r\nes. The problem is\n&gt; &gt; sometimes I may include abstract classes under that =\r\numbrella for\n&gt; &gt; conveniece methods and they get picked up too. Also there =\r\nis no\n&gt; &gt; garauntee that the source and class files will be one for one. (E=\r\ng.\n&gt; &gt; nested classes would go unnoticed as well as source files that\n&gt; &gt; d=\r\non&#39;t/can&#39;t compile to a equivalent named class.) I would feel alot\n&gt; &gt; bett=\r\ner if I could filter the .class files instead of the source and\n&gt; &gt; pull ou=\r\nt only the classes that are TESTABLE. That is, classes that\n&gt; &gt; begin or en=\r\nd with &quot;Test&quot; and have at least one public no-arg method\n&gt; &gt; beginning with=\r\n &quot;test&quot;.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; So I plugged in DirectorySuiteBuilder from the junit addon=\r\ns project\n&gt; &gt; and added some custom code to accomplish this. My custom code=\r\n, a class\n&gt; &gt; named DirectoryScannerSuiteBuilder, is included below. The pr=\r\noblem\n&gt; &gt; with that approach, while it is a lot more  accurate, is that the=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; junitreport task now lumps all tests under my custom\n&gt; &gt; DirectoryScan=\r\nnerSuiteBuilder class name without separating out the\n&gt; &gt; detail. So my que=\r\nstion is what would the best approach be? Should I\n&gt; &gt; stop being anal and =\r\njust go with the batchtest approach and stop\n&gt; &gt; including abstracts under =\r\nthe test source directory? (Incedentally\n&gt; &gt; that&#39;s what I&#39;m resoting to no=\r\nw.) Or is there a more elaborate\n&gt; &gt; solution sort of like a best of breed =\r\nbetween the two approaches I&#39;ve\n&gt; &gt; tried so far?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanx in advance,=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; Cliff\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n",
