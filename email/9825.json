Oooo, this is tricky.<br/>\n<br/>\nPart of the murkiness here is due to my peculiar experience: I know that<br/>\nin reality Java at the JVM level is not a fully object-oriented language.<br/>\nCertainly that Java has no difficulty in distinguishing classes from<br/>\ninstances of classes (and certainly it delights in gotos and other things<br/>\nabominable to the OOPL community ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJim Dixon  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jdd@...\">jdd@...</a>   tel +44 117 982 0786  mobile +44 797 373 7881</div>",
