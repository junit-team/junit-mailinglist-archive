JUnit generates his own reports for failed tests? How =\r\n\ncan \n&gt; I catch them? Or what do you mean with reports for aggregate \n&gt; inf=\r\normation? Are that reports different from the logging I generate \n&gt; with eg=\r\n log4j?\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In junit@yahoogroups.com, didoss@ wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; That soun=\r\nds like two different things:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The logging, whether through log4j (=\r\nwhich I also like) or \nsomething \n&gt; else, will provide debugging informatio=\r\nn to you.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The reports are useful for aggregate information (like h=\r\now many \n&gt; failures and errors for X number of tests for the whole product =\r\n\n&gt; suite, or whatever scope you run) and information about tests \npassed \n&gt;=\r\n and failed (errors and failures).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; For the tests that failed, you =\r\nmight use the information from the \n&gt; report (which will give you informati=\r\non around the issue - stack \n&gt; trace or failure information) or information=\r\n from the log files \n&gt; (information for the entire run - you might be able =\r\nto see the \n&gt; progression of state that led to the failure/error) to troubl=\r\neshoot \n&gt; and fix.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I generally take the reports, or the result of =\r\nan individual run, \n&gt; as my starting point, and then only look at the loggi=\r\nng for the \nones \n&gt; that failed in some way.  If I have written my asserts =\r\nwell, I \n&gt; usually don&#39;t even need to look at the logging, because I will k=\r\nnow \n&gt; exactly what went wrong.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hope this helps and good luck on t=\r\nhe migration.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Dianne\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; -------------- Original message=\r\n -------------- \n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;isowitz&quot; &lt;isowitz@&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I have to rewrite exis=\r\nting tests in JUnit tests. The old tests \nlogs \n&gt; &gt; with a java.util.loggin=\r\ng.Logger, e.g. starttime, start sendind \n&gt; data, \n&gt; &gt; start recieving data,=\r\n the recieved data etc. - in a word they \nlogs \n&gt; &gt; all that can be logged.=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; Should I use the java.util.logging.Logger for JUnit too or is \nthat \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; the bad way?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; You spoke about reports of my result.

In a package I have \na \n&gt; &gt; &gt; AllTe=\r\nsts class that calls several tests. The result of that \ntests \n&gt; &gt; &gt; should=\r\n be logged.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m not familiar with JUnit or logging so I try to find \n=\r\nexamples \n&gt; in \n&gt; &gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; web.
