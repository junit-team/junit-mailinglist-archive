Now The problem is that all<br/>\ncases can be only designed to be in a method ( I do the &#39;for loop&#39; to let<br/>\neach unit input test against the fixture.), it means that in this case many<br/>\ntests happened in one method. Is there any way to execute a test in a<br/>\nmethod?<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards.<br/>\n<br/>\nmmchut<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
