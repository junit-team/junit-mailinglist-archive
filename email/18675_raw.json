With that\n&gt; the Operation could be generated.\n&gt; \n&gt; Then test cases could be generated that complement\n&gt; and\n&gt; prove that the method body generated based on the\n&gt; OCL\n&gt; string is correct, giving the developer further\n&gt; confidence in the solution.\n&gt; \n&gt; Just an idea.\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; - Ole\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- bohs01@... wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yeap it aint what I had in mind, in fact i dont\n&gt; &gt; think i can come up  \n&gt; &gt; with something like it LoL\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; What i had in mind was just some sort of template\n&gt; &gt; for a user to fill  \n&gt; &gt; in the blanks sortof\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; and a tutorial which asks questions whose answers\n&gt; &gt; are used to fill in  \n&gt; &gt; the  above mentioned blanks\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thus, in a way i think it helps with TDD, since it\n&gt; &gt; drives the design  \n&gt; &gt; process but asking questions like what are the pre\n&gt; &gt; and post  \n&gt; &gt; conditions, class invariants etc, that the user\n&gt; &gt; needs to answer in  \n&gt; &gt; order to generate the test cases.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; It also automates the generation of the test\n&gt; cases,\n&gt; &gt; &quot;generating of the  \n&gt; &gt; source code&quot; that is.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; yeap actually i&#39;ve been reading the posts, and am\n&gt; &gt; not sure what PMD  \n&gt; &gt; does exactly...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Jimm\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Quoting Ole Ersoy &lt;ole_ersoy@...&gt;:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Wow - Dud - You Da Man!!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (And judging by the name - quite possibly\n&gt; &gt; Norwegian, which explains why\n&gt; &gt; &gt; u so da Man :-)  )\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; This actually looks a lot like\n&gt; &gt; &gt; what I&#39;ve been trying to describe,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; with the possible exception that I don&#39;t think\n&gt; &gt; &gt; it generates tests like Jimm wants to do,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; but hey this is real ;-).  HooohHahhh!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Jimm in order for this to work the way it says\n&gt; it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; works it has to parse source and store it in\n&gt; some\n&gt; &gt; &gt; model.  Then analyze it...looks like using rule\n&gt; &gt; sets.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m sure you could use the same model and rule\n&gt; &gt; sets\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to generate tests (Just shooting from the hip. \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;d have to look at it a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; little more\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to see whether I could come up with a concrete\n&gt; &gt; example. )\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://pmd.sourceforge.net/\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks for letting me us Joakim.  Can&#39;t wait to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to hook it up to my maven projects.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Cheers,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; - Ole\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Joakim Ohlrogge wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; As a matter of fact...it would be nice to\n&gt; have\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; something that enumerates the branches and\n&gt; &gt; generates a\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; report on which methods has a number of\n&gt; &gt; branches over\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; a certain limit...for code refactoring and\n&gt; &gt; maintenance\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; purposes.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Hi Ole,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; I have not read the whole thread yet so if this\n&gt; &gt; has already been\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; suggested I&#39;m sorry.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; PMD actually reports methods with a cyclomatic\n&gt; &gt; complexity that is\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; larger than 10. If I&#39;m not mistaken that is\n&gt; what\n&gt; &gt; you&#39;re looking for.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; I find this helpful to find targets to refactor\n&gt; &gt; in legacy code. When\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; TDD:ing the PLP (my abbreviation for path of\n&gt; &gt; least pain) keeps the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; cyclomatic complexity down (Like Jeff Langr\n&gt; &gt; suggested earlier in the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; threat).\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Cheers!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; /J\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; Tired of spam?
