However it relies too much on programmer design for my<br/>\n&gt; comfort.

I think I <br/>\nmight know what you mean, but best to make sure.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; This certainly shouldn&#39;t be seen as a replacement of any<br/>\n&gt; &gt; non-parameterized JUnit 3 tests. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And yet I&#39;m afraid that&#39;s how it will be seen by many programmers. A lot<br/>\n&gt; of the JUnit test suites I see in practice, including some I&#39;ve written,<br/>\n&gt; push way too much into one method. I was just looking at one a couple of<br/>\n&gt; days ago that had about two methods in the entire test suite, and these<br/>\n&gt; two methods tested everything. Adding specialized support for<br/>\n&gt; parameterized test cases like this will just make it easier and more<br/>\n&gt; convenient for programmers to do the wrong thing. I&#39;m afraid this will<br/>\n&gt; be just too tempting and be use far more often than it should be.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I would certainly hope that the documentation for JUnit 4 will present <br/>\nthese annotations as being fairly deep in the bag of JUnit tricks, to <br/>\nprevent an outbreak of novices with bulletholes in their feet.  Can you <br/>\nbe more specific with an example of a test suite done the right way in <br/>\nJUnit 3, which would be more likely to be done the wrong way in JUnit 4 <br/>\n+ @Parameters?  Are you imagining something like this?<br/>\n<br/>\nclass FibTest extends TestCase {<br/>\n    public void testZero() {<br/>\n       assertEquals(0, fib(0));<br/>\n    }<br/>\n<br/>\n    public void testOne() {<br/>\n       assertEquals(1, fib(1));<br/>\n    }<br/>\n<br/>\n    public void testTwo() {<br/>\n       assertEquals(1, fib(2));<br/>\n    }<br/>\n}<br/>\n<br/>\nBecoming:<br/>\n<br/>\nclass FibTest {<br/>\n    @Parameters public static int[][] data= new int[][] {{0, 0}, {1, 1}, <br/>\n{2, 1}};<br/>\n<br/>\n    @Parameter(0) public int expected;<br/>\n    @Parameter(1) public int input;<br/>\n<br/>\n    @Test public void test() {<br/>\n        assertEquals(expected, fib(input));<br/>\n    }<br/>\n}<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; On the other hand, it might mean more tests get written since it&#39;s a lot<br/>\n&gt; easier to add a line to an array of parameters than a whole new method.<br/>\n&gt; that would be a good thing. But it definitely leads away from *unit*<br/>\n&gt; testing. I think we&#39;ll see more functional and integration tests with<br/>\n&gt; this and fewer unit tests (not that the lines between them aren&#39;t fuzzy<br/>\n&gt; already) I&#39;m not sure whether the advantages outweigh the disadvantages<br/>\n&gt; or not.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Why would an available syntax for parameterized test cases lead to more <br/>\nfunctional tests and fewer unit tests?<br/>\n<br/>\n    David Saff</div>",
