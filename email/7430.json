    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-715359898\">Here are some reasons to unit test:<br/>\n1) Find the problem before someone else does.<br/>\n2) The problem is found close to the source (coding) thus the time to solve<br/>\nit is shorter.<br/>\n3) Refactoring existing code is much easier when a test suite is already<br/>\npresent as one can see what broke.<br/>\n4) In most cases, you either spend the time unit testing up front, prior to<br/>\nreleasing the software, or you<br/>\nspend the equivalent time fixing bugs in released software.  Unit testing<br/>\ncan be viewed as virtually free.<br/>\n5) The tests live on long after developers have left the project.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere are some reasons to use JUnit:<br/>\n1) It&#39;s a true testing framework that can be extended.  Why write your own?<br/>\n2) The tests are easily automatable from a build script since they are<br/>\nconsistently written.<br/>\n3) There are no external &quot;data&quot; or input files to get lost, as there may be<br/>\nin main() type tests.<br/>\n4) There is no output to look through since conditions are asserted in the<br/>\ncode.<br/>\n5) A test skeleton can be built by some of the IDE&#39;s out there today.<br/>\n6) Since there are no parameters to most JUnit tests there is really no<br/>\nexternal documentation necessary.<br/>\n7) Mention the word JUnit and anyone familiar with it can be up to speed<br/>\nquickly with any tests written in it.<br/>\n8) It&#39;s idiot proof; it either passes or fails.<br/>\n9) Most programmers aren&#39;t &quot;proud&quot; enough of their tests, or aren&#39;t willing<br/>\nto admit they have very few tests, so no tests are checked into a source<br/>\ncode repository.  This is certainly not the case with JUnit.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrian Peterson<br/>\nwww.thomson.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe opinions expressed herein are at best coincidentally related to<br/>\nthose of any past, present, or future employer.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Mike Clark [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mike@...\">mike@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, April 02, 2003 9:00 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [junit] How do I make Unit Testing practical?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Scott Palmer wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;Another comment:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I&#39;ve been trying to get started with the unit testing and have been <br/>\n&gt; &gt;encouraging other&#39;s in my company to try it too, but I can&#39;t get any <br/>\n&gt; &gt;buy-in.
