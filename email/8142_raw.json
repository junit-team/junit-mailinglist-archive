Therefore, the burden \n&gt; lies on you to implement an equals method that \n&gt; honors the contract.\n&gt; \n&gt; Joshua Bloch, in his book, _Effective Java_, \n&gt; has explained very well how to write a good \n&gt; implementation of the equals method.  Furthermore, \n&gt; it is not very difficult to write a good JUnit \n&gt; TestCase to ensure that your equals\n&gt; implementation honors the contract.  \n&gt; I have written my own TestCase for this\n&gt; purpose, and the Junit-addons project \n&gt; (http://junit-addons.sourceforge.net/)\n&gt; has a TestCase named EqualsHashCodeTestCase \n&gt; that you can extend.\n&gt; \n&gt; Craig\n\n\n",
