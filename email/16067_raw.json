However, for commercial software development, is this\n&gt; still possible ?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Although I knew JUnit and other JUnit-based open-source tools for a\n&gt; couple of years, my company and team never really enbrace it. The\n&gt; major reason is Product Managers always want to add cool features to\n&gt; the system quickly while programmers find the schedule is always too\n&gt; tight to spend any extra time to write testing. \n&gt; \n&gt; I know from the mail list and books that we can take lots of advantage\n&gt; of JUnit-based testing, I myself have no real hands-on experience on\n&gt; it. So here are my questions: \n&gt; \n&gt; * Will Junit-based testing make the project time longer or shorter ?\n&gt; Any hard statistic data ? ( Here I mean commercial project rather than\n&gt; open-source project. )\n&gt; \n&gt; * One intersting point I found is that after Junit-based testing is\n&gt; introduced, programmers tend to use IDE debugger much less than\n&gt; before.  This would save lots of time. Is that true ?\n&gt; \n&gt; * Some guys say JUnit is good for biz / util code testing. But for web\n&gt; application development, where HTML/javascript would be root cause of\n&gt; lots of bugs, Junit is not so powerful. Any comments ? \n&gt; \n&gt; * How can I convince managers and programmers that JUnit-based is\n&gt; really possible for commercial software development ? Any differnece\n&gt; from open-source projects ?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; Can some Junit gurus shed some light here ?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks, \n&gt; - Frank\n&gt; \n\nFascinating and very good questions. I will try to address some of them:\n\n &gt; * Will Junit-based testing make the project time longer or shorter ?\n &gt; Any hard statistic data ? ( Here I mean commercial project rather than\n &gt; open-source project. )\n\nI tend to see it taking longer. Considering that you are least doubling (is this an english verb? \n:-) ) the quantity of code you write I would say this is the reason. Some people say that this time \nwill be reduced by less bugs and time spent bug fixing. I would like to agree with this, but \nunfortunately the projects I have worked on haven&#39;t prooved this true: the kind of bugs caught by \nunit testing are the easiest. Those real bugs that are screwing the schedules happen in such complex \nscenarios, that you will not be able to wrap inside tests. And I haven&#39;t mentioned unit tests, that \nare even more far away from catching these kind of tests.\n\n\n &gt; * Some guys say JUnit is good for biz / util code testing. But for web\n &gt; application development, where HTML/javascript would be root cause of\n &gt; lots of bugs, Junit is not so powerful. Any comments ?\n\nOnce again I feel I am seeing it differently. I haven&#39;t seen many places where unit testing played \nan important role in this kind of scenarios. Moving to functional and integration testing, than I \nagree that some test coverage is good. Now, you need to balance how complex is to put in place such \nfunctional and integration tests and how are they gonna cut the time.\n\n &gt; * One intersting point I found is that after Junit-based testing is\n &gt; introduced, programmers tend to use IDE debugger much less than\n &gt; before.  This would save lots of time. Is that true ?\n\nAs I posted in some other mail in this thread, my approach is usually:\n\n- think about the problem, set some breakpoints, identify the problem\n- try to write some test for that =&gt; if you have the tests at this point you have some failures\n- fix the problem =&gt; than check if the tests pass\n\nI am spending the same time amount working with the debugger. The benefit is that afterwards I will \nfeel a little bit better when going back to fix some other problem in the component, cause I will \nhave some tests that are guaranteeing I am not introducing regression problems.\n\n &gt; * How can I convince managers and programmers that JUnit-based is\n &gt; really possible for commercial software development ? Any differnece\n &gt; from open-source projects ?\n\nThis is the kind of question I&#39;ve asked myself many times, or every time I have worked with a \ncompany. If you find the answer than let us all know, cause I think everybody is interested :-).\n\nI have tried different strategies, but I cannot say why some of them succeded or some of them failed.\n\nI would like to end this post, by stating that this represents my own perspective and my own \nopinions (and is not meant to start a flame).\n\ncheers,\n\n./alex\n--\n.w( the_mindstorm )p.\n\n\n\n\n",
