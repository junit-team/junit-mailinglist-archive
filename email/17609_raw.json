So \nmany of the questions on this list are from beginners too lazy to use \nGoogle that, as a balance, I like these discussions (not theological \nrants, by the way--no need to insult--I, for one, am pragmatic in my \ndiscussion, so would that be applied theology?).\n\nI understand that that&#39;s not what you want to read, and I&#39;m sorry you&#39;re \nnot getting what you want from the list right now. One option you have \nis to start a thread and ask the questions you want answered. You can \nalso ignore the threads you don&#39;t want to read. You can also leave the \nlist, although I hope you won&#39;t.\n\nJUnit is a design tool, and so naturally we will tend to discuss how \nJUnit tests affect our design.
