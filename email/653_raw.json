Here is the updated readme:\n\n----\n\nThis is experimental software, use at your own risk, you have been \nwarned.\n\nKnown Problems:\n\nClasspath.  I haven&#39;t been able to figure out how to get the \nTestRunner to use the Vaj Classpath.\n\nThere are two work arounds:\n\n1.  Export your tests into the junit directory under ide&#92;tools.  It&#39;s \na pain, I&#39;ve experimented with Worspace.setClassPath, which has been \nresulting in a java.lang.InteralError when trying to load the test.  \nExporting your tests is the only way right clicking on a package or \nclass will work.\n\n2.  David Farber pointed out that you can right click on \nVajTestRunner, select -&gt; Run -&gt; Check Class Path, Edit the project \npath, and add the Project which contains the test you want to run.  \nThis allows you to Run (with) VajTestRunner specifying the test to \nrun through a parameter.  You can&#39;t right click on  a package or \ntest, but you do get the opening of a browser to the failed test \nclass when you double click on a failure (not the stack trace, the \nlist above the stack trace). \n\nVajTestRunner usage:\n -p &lt;package whose AllTests you want to run&gt;\n -c &lt;class to run in JUnit&gt;\n \nFor test classes in default packages you need to use the Vaj package \nname in double quotes, ie.\n -c &quot;Default package for JUnit Vaj TestRunner Test.TestFailure&quot;\n\nInstallation:\n\nShut down VisualAge for Java\nUnzip VajJUnit.zip into your VisualAge for Java ide&#92;tools directory.\nStart VisualAge for Java.\nImport VajRepository.dat from ide&#92;tools&#92;junit\n\nNotes:\n\nI modified JUnit slightly (hence the 3.5vaj version name), I changed \nthe scope of junit.swingui.TestRunner.fTestRunViews from private to \nprotected, so I could add a MouseListener to the JList which contains \nthe failures.\n\n\nErik Meade\nemeade@...\n\n\n\n",
