( Here I mean commercial project rather than\n&gt; &gt; open-source project. )\n&gt;\n&gt; I tend to see it taking longer. Considering that you are least doubling \n&gt; (is this an english\n&gt; verb? :-) ) the quantity of code you write I would say this is the reason.\n\nI want to emphasize the point again (already made by Kent and J.B.) that \nthis type of reasoning assumes that the limiting factor in developing \nsoftware is typing out the code.  I encourage developers to watch themselves \nor their team for a day to observe what percentage of the time is really \nspent in typing code vs. other activities.\n\nIf the limiting factor were typing then yes, writing twice as many lines of \ncode would take longer.  If the limiting factor is really other activities: \ncommunicating with the rest of the team, understanding the problem, \ndesigning, finding and fixing errors, then it is not inconceivable that \npracticing TDD with JUnit can give you an overall speedup.  The trick is \nlearning how to integrate JUnit as part of all of these other \nactivites--activities which all software developers perform.\n\nThat has been my personal experience and the experience of our teams writing \ncommercial software (usually with fixed-time, fixed-price contracts) for the \nlast 5 years.  Consistent JUnit testing by the whole team--using \nTDD--decreases the time it takes to produce production-ready software.\n\nSorry but you hit one of my hot buttons.  :-)  Programming is NOT about the \ntyping.\n\nJeff\n\n-- \nJeff Nielsen | Chief Scientist | Digital Focus\njeff.nielsen@... | www.digitalfocus.com \n\n\n",
