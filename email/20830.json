To this end, I understand<br/>\nthat a framework such as jMock can be used.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo far, so good. But I find JUnit to be extremely useful for writing<br/>\nintegration, system and user acceptance tests as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s my question: what is the official position of the JUnit community on<br/>\nusing JUnit to do larger scale tests? Is there a better framework, or is it<br/>\ncommon practice to use JUnit for these tests as well?<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJan Kroeze<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
