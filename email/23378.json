JUnit uses &quot;internal&quot; and &quot;experimental&quot;<br/>\npackages to hint at these qualities.  On other projects, I&#39;ve tried to<br/>\ndo the opposite, having the classes I intend to be stable and<br/>\npublished in packages that contain the name &quot;api&quot;, leaving all others<br/>\n&quot;use at your own risk&quot;.  Google encourages a @VisibleForTesting tag,<br/>\nalthough I prefer to have designs and viewabilities that make sense as<br/>\noutgrowths of a particular design philosophy without considering<br/>\ntesting specifically.<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe that while it&#39;s important to allow clients that want the<br/>\nsafest experience to easily find ways of doing so, it&#39;s also possible<br/>\nto make life too hard for clients who want to move forward at their<br/>\nown risk.
