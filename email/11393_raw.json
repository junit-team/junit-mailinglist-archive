Let&#39;s face it; a lot of groups of tests do have\n&gt; &gt;  known dependencies between tests such that if test A fails, we know \nthat\n&gt; &gt;  the output of tests B, C and D are uninteresting. Yet we end up \nrunning\n&gt; &gt;  B, C and D anyway, and then searching through all the error output \nfor\n&gt; &gt;  the failure that we know is the &quot;real&quot; one, ignoring all the others \nas\n&gt; &gt;  spurious.\n&gt; \n&gt; With all due respect, I believe that is a code smell.  It seems to say \nto me \n&gt; that there is something not right about the design of the code being \ntested, \n&gt; or perhaps even more elusive, something is wrong with how the tests are \n&gt; written.  When I find these types of dependencies I inevitably rethink \nhow I \n&gt; have written my tests.  Have I coded in the dependencies or are they \nreally \n&gt; there.  More times than not I have coded in the dependencies -- and \ntherefore \n&gt; I can remove them.  Further, I would argue that I _NEED_ to remove them. \n \n&gt; Now, maybe I am old-fashioned but I believe tests (at least at the \n&gt; unit/programmer level) ought to be as autonomous as possible.\n\nI&#39;ve heard that argument several times, and it sounds reasonable, but \nstill I don&#39;t understand completely. I think the best way to present my \nconfusion is to show to you an example where I think it would be perfectly \nreasonable to not run some tests, because I know the _will_ fail if one \nother fails:\n\nI&#39;m developing a system that handles (among others, but quite extensively) \npersistence of java objects to a database. I&#39;ve built test cases for some \n(far too few, but that&#39;s another problem) of the functionality, most of \nwhich of course need a properly configured Database conection. Now I also \ngot a test that checks to see if the system can successfully connect to \nthe database. If this case fails then there are about 130 other tests that \nwill not produce anything useable. It would probably be possible to mock \nthe Database, but I can&#39;t really imagine how (without makeing the Mock so \nunstable, that it won&#39;t help).\n\nWhat would you do about these tests in this case? Or am I talking about \nsomething completely different?\n\nregards\nJoachim Sauer\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n",
