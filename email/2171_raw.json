B. Rainsberger&quot; &lt;jbrains762@...&gt;\r\n\r\n&gt;re - assert countingFrom: Keith Ray\n&gt; &gt;As I said before, I would just want a warning when a test method is empty\n&gt;or has no asserts...\n&gt; &gt; but I don&#39;t want to go to the trouble of getting some code-coverage tool\n&gt;working.\n&gt;\n&gt;Interesting. But in my case I would have a lot of &quot;false warnings&quot; because \n&gt;I\n&gt;have a lot of methods that validate something and throw if it&#39;s invalid \n&gt;(but\n&gt;do nothing if valid, so return is void). The tests look like that :\n&gt;\n&gt;public void testAValidationTest() throws Exception {\n&gt;     validator.validate(VALID_DATA);\n&gt;}\n&gt;\n&gt;So, no asserts, but a perfectly valid test case.\n\nI disagree. Wouldn&#39;t method validate(DataObject) have to either return a \nboolean or perform the assertion itself? In the first case, you&#39;d have to \nwrite assertTrue(validator.validate()), or otherwise the assertTrue() would \nbe inside the method validate(). Either way, you&#39;re performing at least one \nassert.\n\nOf course, I assume that you prefer not to have an unsuccessful validation \nregister as an error. In the last case, you&#39;d write\n\ntry {\n    validate();\n}\ncatch (ValidationException oops) {\n    fail(oops.toString());\n}\n\nRemember, folks: fail() is an assertion! Look at the code.\n\nJBR.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp\n\n\n",
