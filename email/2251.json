    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-663055731\">We are developing a J2EE-based web application, and we&#39;ve been<br/>\ngetting better and better at our testing.  Recently we reached<br/>\na pain threshold that&#39;s causing us to make a compromise trade<br/>\noff.  Perhaps you folks can offer some suggestions.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe developers write unit test for all layers of the system,<br/>\nfrom the web pages to the smallest methods.  For most tests,<br/>\nwe use JUnit and for the web tests we use HTTPUnit.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe highest level of the web tests check for the page flow<br/>\n(link navigation) and for page contents.  These tests, written<br/>\nwith HTTPUnit, are getting painful.  There is often a lot of<br/>\nset up needed (e.g., putting objects in the right state) to<br/>\nget to the point where the test can execute, as well as a lot<br/>\nof code to log in and navigate to the page where the test can<br/>\nrun.  In some cases, the effort to write these tests is a<br/>\nsignificant percentage of the overall task efforts.<br/>\n<br/>\nRecently, developers have stopped writing these web tests,<br/>\nresorting to running the tests manually by hand.  Their<br/>\nreasoning is that the cost of writing the web tests is not<br/>\njustified by their benefits.  Others point out the issues<br/>\nwith manual tests (inconsistent tests, the extra time to run<br/>\nthem repeatedly, lack of documentation, etc.), and assert<br/>\nthat the tests are worth the admittedly high costs.  We&#39;re<br/>\nhaving trouble reaching consensus.<br/>\n<br/>\nA related issue is that our QA folks have not been able to<br/>\nprovide a suite of automated acceptance tests, which we<br/>\npresume should also test page navigation and contents as page<br/>\nof the user functionality tests.  They use a &quot;big&quot; testing<br/>\ntool (Seque), and we&#39;re not sure if we could use their tests<br/>\nin a day-to-day development environment, if they existed.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, in your opinion, should the developers be writing the web<br/>\npage navigation and contents tests?  IMHO, we should because<br/>\nthis stuff can break, unless we can get QA to write them as<br/>\npart of the acceptance tests and we can share the tool to run<br/>\nthem in the development environment.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf so, should the tests be automated?  IMHO, they should for<br/>\nall the same reasons we automate any tests.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, what about the cost?  Are there ways to reduce the costs<br/>\nof writing these type of tests?  Are there other tools we<br/>\ncould be using?  At XPU, Lisa Crispin recommended WebART as<br/>\na tool at this level.  I also heard discussion of patterns<br/>\nsuch as Object Mother for creating objects in a particular<br/>\nstate for testing.  Comments here?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks much in advance for any suggestions.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Paul Hodgetts</div>",
