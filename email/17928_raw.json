Here&#39;s some code to help out the next person.\n\n@BeforeClass\npublic stat=\r\nic void runBeforeTestClass() throws Exception {\n        if(System.getProper=\r\nty(&quot;someproperty&quot;) =3D=3D null) {\n\t\tRunNotifier fNotifier;\n\t\tfNotifier=3D n=\r\new RunNotifier();\n\t\tfNotifier.pleaseStop();\n\t\tfail(&quot;someproperty was not se=\r\nt!&quot;);\n\t\tfNotifier.fireTestStarted(null);\n\t}\n\t\t\n}\n\nIf this is something you =\r\nare likely to use in a number of places, you \ncan just take the notifier co=\r\nde, and put it in a stopRunner method \nthat takes in the string argument yo=\r\nu want to show up in the fail \nmessage.  This works nicely as it is passed =\r\nup and shows up in the \nfinal html junitreport output.\n\n\n--- In junit@yahoo=\r\ngroups.com, &quot;dchoicestream&quot; &lt;dshea@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m using Eclipse 3.2 us=\r\ning the JUnit 4.1 test runner along with \nANT \n&gt; 1.7.0beta1 to do developme=\r\nnt, and then when I deploy everything is \n&gt; executed from ANT 1.7.0beta1 us=\r\ning JUnit 4.1 with the &lt;junit&gt; and \n&gt; &lt;junitreport&gt; tasks.\n&gt; \n&gt; In my JUnit=\r\n test class I have a @BeforeClass method which checks to \n&gt; make sure that =\r\nthe necessary properties (arguments) have been \npassed \n&gt; before even begin=\r\nning the test methods.  In my @BeforeClass method, \nhow \n&gt; do I tell the ru=\r\nnner to exit?\n&gt; I&#39;ve looked through UserStopTest.java, and I know that the =\r\nsecret \nlies \n&gt; somewhere in accessing the runner notifier and using the pl=\r\neaseStop\n() \n&gt; method, but it is eluding me.\n&gt; \n&gt; If someone could drop an =\r\nexample that would be great!\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
