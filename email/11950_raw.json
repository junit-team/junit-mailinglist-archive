Is there better way?\n&gt; \n&gt; Hope you can help.\n\nIt depends on what you would like to teach your students.  If you are\ntrying to create an assigment where they learn to write code that\naccomplishes certain objectives, and you&#39;re not teaching a particular\ndevelopment method, you might be better served using a tool like\nFitnesse (http://www.fitnesse.org/).  You define a series of tests\nthat the students code must pass, and when the student runs the tests\neach one is tagged as a success or failure.  The advantage is that\nthis framework does not require the methods to be written yet in order\nfor the tests to run.\n\nYou could introduce JUnit as a tool to help your students write more\nreliable code that passes the acceptance tests you define using Fitnesse.\n\nHope this helps!\nCarl\n\n\n",
