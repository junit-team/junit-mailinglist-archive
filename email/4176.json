I am not against this (in fact I prefer it),<br/>\n&gt; but often a few words of English (or whatever language you read) is<br/>\n&gt; preferrable (IMHO) to a large test suite.<br/>\n&gt; I still have the test suite, however, for refactoring and code proof.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If we don&#39;t write new code until we have a failing test, then the tests cover all the methods.  I agree that they may not test all possible parameters.  We&#39;ll maximize the testing investment by testing interesting boundary conditions and reasonable ranges for parameters.  Our code coverage will still be very high.  And yes, we&#39;ll amass test suites quickly as our tests become more comprehensive over time.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a few words of English is necessary over and above the method signature, then by all means add it to the documentation.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; I would still say that that the tests document examples of the intention,<br/>\n&gt; rather than the intention itself. These examples may be a complete set or<br/>\n&gt; may not be, often just the critical subset.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Agreed.  Examples of intention and intention draw closer together the more we use test-first design.  Nevertheless, we&#39;re documenting intention rather than implementation.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood points - thanks!<br/>\n<br/>\nMike<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nMike Clark<br/>\nClarkware Consulting, Inc.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.clarkware.com\">http://www.clarkware.com</a><br/>\n720.851.2014</div>",
