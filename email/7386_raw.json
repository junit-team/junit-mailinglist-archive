Using JUnit will change the code one would normally create: \n&gt; Because of JUnit you need to overwrite equals(), toString() and are \n&gt; not allowed to use void return type if you want to test that method.\n&gt; \n&gt; Using the assert statement instead I can also test classes which \n&gt; return no value.\n&gt; \nYou test the effects of a method, not just what it returns.\n\nExample:\n    /**\n     * Default constructor doesn&#39;t initialize name.\n     */\n    public void testDefaultConstructor() {\n        ClassDesc cls = new ClassDesc();\n        assertEquals(&quot;&lt;unknown&gt;&quot;, cls.getName());\n        assertEquals(&quot;&lt;unknown&gt;&quot;, cls.getTableName());\n    }\n    \n    /**\n     * Table name defaults to class name.\n     */\n    public void testDefaultTableName() {\n        ClassDesc cls = new ClassDesc(&quot;AClass&quot;);\n        assertEquals(&quot;AClass&quot;, cls.getName());\n        assertEquals(&quot;AClass&quot;, cls.getTableName());\n    }\n    \n    /**\n     * Table name can be explicitly set.\n     */\n    public void testSetTableName() {\n        ClassDesc cls = new ClassDesc(&quot;AClass&quot;);\n        assertEquals(&quot;AClass&quot;, cls.getName());\n        assertEquals(&quot;AClass&quot;, cls.getTableName());\n        cls.setTableName(&quot;table_a&quot;);\n        assertEquals(&quot;table_a&quot;, cls.getTableName());\n        cls.setTableName(&quot;table_one&quot;);\n        assertEquals(&quot;table_one&quot;, cls.getTableName());\n    }\n\nThese are three simple tests that exercise different\nvariations of creating a ClassDesc object and seeing how\na database table name value is affected.\n\n&gt; Besides all this problems whis JUnit is another one: Successful \n&gt; JUnits tests are no guarantee that there are no bugs in the code I \n&gt; read. This has to do with data chains. But I didn&#39;t understand this.\n&gt; \n&gt; And I read that it is extremely time consuming to create test cases \n&gt; for all possible cases.\n&gt; \nTrue for however you test your code. :-)\n\n\n&gt; The good thing about using assert statements would also be, that \nthe \n&gt; test is included in the method. So no extra coding of classes would \n&gt; be requiered as with using JUnit. Everything is in one place, user \n&gt; friendly.\n&gt; \nAs I said earlier, unless something execises the asserts, you\nhaven&#39;t tested. You need *something* external (and it might as\nwell be a JUnit test!)\n\n&gt; Using assert statements will not force the developer to use a \nspecial \n&gt; developing practice like testdriven development. He is free to \n&gt; develop in his own style.\n&gt; \nI *wish* JUnit would force some of my co-workers to use TDD. :-)\n\n&gt; The synchronisation between test cases and methods to be tested \nwould \n&gt; is time consuming. And what happens if you change a method so that \n&gt; preconditions or postconditions will become different? Will you \n&gt; remember to change the JUnit to fit these changes? Or will you \n&gt; sometimes forget? Error detecting is then twice as hard, since it \ncan \n&gt; originate in the test class or in the class to be tested. Thats a \n&gt; point where assert statements are better in my eyes compared to \nJUnit.\n&gt; \nWhen the designed behavior of a class changes, you need to change\nwhatever form of test you have. This is a Good Thing. Run the tests\nALL the time. When a previously passing test fails, it can only be\nbecause of changes between the last time you passed vs. now.\nHaving this coverage DOES mean you have to change existing tests\nwhen you modify the behavior of a class. But, it also means that\nunintended side-effects will not pass unnoticed. Be glad that your\ntest detected the change and make the appropriate change -- to the\ntest if the behavior modification was intentional, and to the code\nif it wasn&#39;t.\n\nRichard.\n\n\n",
