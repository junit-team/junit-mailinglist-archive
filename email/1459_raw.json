The\noriginal quote (paraphrased) was that &quot;we put tests in the same package as\nproduction code to make it easier to test protected interfaces of our\nobjects.&quot;  I don&#39;t see where this fits in to good design or good testing\npractices.  The virtue of public/protected/private/default is not what I was\nquestioning.  I wanted to point out the potential flaws of design and\ntesting that could otherwise be missed when you put tests in the same\npackage as production code.  The production code should be tested in the\nsame fashion it would be used by a client.  A test is a client in some\ndegree.  In most cases clients exist outside of the package.\n\nSomeone (sorry, I forget who it was) brought up the fact that &quot;client&quot; is a\nloose term that can refer to objects outside my package domain as well as to\nobjects within my package domain.  I do not disagree with that assertion.\nHowever, I believe that (in most cases) the public interface of any part of\na system should be designed in such a way that when it is tested the\nprogrammer can be assured that he/she hasn&#39;t broken anything.  The\npackage-scope clients usually have a public interface of their own which can\nthen be tested separately from the classes they interact with.  Often times\nin a situation where objects use the protected &quot;inners&quot; (either variables or\nmethods) of another object within their package there is some kind of\nheirarchical relationship where one object is a supporter of another.  Thus,\nI conclude, that testing the public interfaces of ALL objects (the key being\nALL) should prove sufficient, thus not needing the tests to reside in the\nsame package as their associated production code objects.  Of course, there\nare exceptions... we have ways around those.\n\n-Jason\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Yishay Mor [mailto:ymor@...]\nSent: Monday, June 11, 2001 5:57 PM\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: RE: [junit] Best Practice for Tests ?\n\n\nI could, but that would cost you more then 2c  #:-)\n\nconsider, as an example, the following pattern:\n\nabstract class A {\n        public void doSomeThingComplex() {\n                // do some stuff\n                :\n                // call extender&#39;s code\n                doSomeThingSimple();\n                // do some more stuff\n                :\n        }\n\n        protected abstract void doSomeThingSimple();\n}\n\npublic class B extends A {\n        protected void doSomeThingSimple(){\n                // do it\n        }\n}\n\n- but this is turning into a thread on Java design issues, maybe we should\ntake it elsewhere.\n\nYishay\n                        \n\n\nAt 04:07 PM 6/11/2001 -0400, you wrote:\n\nThanks for the quote.
