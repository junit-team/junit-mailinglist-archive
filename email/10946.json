But it was *never*<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; legitimate to make a virtue of necessity, to say (as you do) that<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;separation is the solution.&quot; Now that you *can* drive your UIs<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; from JUnit, and therefore you can *fully* test your UIs, your<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; claim is illegitimate, and moreover encourages the<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;anti-test-infection.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Ron Jeffries Sun May 2, 2004  2:55 pm<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; I still don&#39;t have the necessary skill to do very well what Thomas<br/>\n&gt;&gt; rightly recommends<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Can you write a JUnit testcase? Then you can any of several j.a.R-<br/>\nextending packages. Try it, it&#39;s easy. (Esp for Swing--Abbot&#39;s SWT<br/>\nsupport is almost as good, and we&#39;re hoping to make it equivalent by<br/>\nthe end of the summer.)<br/>\n<br/>\nJ. B. Rainsberger Sun May 2, 2004 7:37 pm (rearranged)<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I hope that readers do not interpret your remark to mean that<br/>\n&gt; separation is ineffective.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>See above.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Separation is, however, a majority of the solution. It is easily 80%<br/>\n&gt; of the solution, if not more. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>False. You are claiming that a properly designed UI need not be fully<br/>\ntested. This is<br/>\n<br/>\n* merely speculative: for all your design, if you haven&#39;t tested, you<br/>\n  don&#39;t know that it works. (I might add that the vast majority of<br/>\n  customers care much more that the code they&#39;ve bought works as<br/>\n  specified than that it is well designed.)<br/>\n<br/>\n* a bad practice that all-too-easily leads to worse practice (as<br/>\n  argued in &quot;fighting the anti-test-infection&quot; above)<br/>\n<br/>\n* anachronistic: the tooling problems that formerly lent aid and<br/>\n  comfort to your view have been rectified.<br/>\n<br/>\nI will go so far as to claim, ceteris paribus, better one&#39;s code be<br/>\nthoroughly tested (presuming it passes those tests :-) than well<br/>\ndesigned. (I will also claim that thorough testing promotes good<br/>\ndesign, but that&#39;s because I&#39;m a TDD true believer.)</div>",
