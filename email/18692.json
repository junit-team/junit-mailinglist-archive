So you would have 100% test passes, which is<br/>\nincorrect against the actual expected results against the requirements.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nSome argue that false impressions are worse than no impression at all.  I&#39;m<br/>\nyet to decide on my position.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nGreg.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n  _____  <br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>] On Behalf Of<br/>\nKevin Lawrence<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, 10 January 2007 11:20 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [junit] 100%% Method Testing and Generating Unit Tests<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nOn 1/9/07, James P.

Regardless of how well one<br/>\n&gt; program can reason about the behavior of another, it requires that the<br/>\n&gt; program reason about the intent of the original programmer. The<br/>\n&gt; automated tests _may_ be able to assess that the code is doing what it<br/>\n&gt; it written to do, but how can it determine that it wasn&#39;t written to do<br/>\n&gt; the right thing?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There are lots of reasons why one might want to have tests. Off the<br/>\ntop of my head,<br/>\n<br/>\n- to drive the design<br/>\n- to document the design<br/>\n- to demonstrate correctness<br/>\n- to provide a safety net when changing unfamiliar code<br/>\n<br/>\nThis latter case, which Michael Feathers talks a great deal about in<br/>\nWELC, is probably one of the most common reasons that people want<br/>\nautomated tests.<br/>\n<br/>\nPutting it another way,<br/>\n<br/>\nif I change this line of code, what other behavior will change will<br/>\nchange as a result<br/>\n<br/>\nWe ask ourselves this question every time we maintain unfamiliar code<br/>\nin an unfamiliar system without tests. The most conscientious<br/>\ndevelopers write tests before changing that line of code. Most don&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is such a common activity in software development that a program<br/>\nthat could characterize the behavior of another program and report<br/>\nwhen the behavior has changed would be useful wouldn&#39;t it?<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to JB&#39;s observation about whether it&#39;s possible to generate such<br/>\ntests for non-trivial programs - it&#39;s still early days for JUnit<br/>\nFactory but I think you&#39;d be surprised by what&#39;s already possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nKevin<br/>\n<br/>\nwww.junitfactory.com<br/>\nYou send us code.
