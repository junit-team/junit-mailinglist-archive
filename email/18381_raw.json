From what you\nwant to do it seems like fit/fitnesse is more apropriate (maintaining test\nsuites of testdata that can be repededly executed and verified).\n\nOf course your develpers really should do unit testing to prevent &quot;bugs&quot;\nfrom entering the code in the first place.\nIn short the process is that acceptance tests are written in fitnesse and\nfixtures to run those tests are implemented by developers.\nIn order to realize those demands in code the developers use JUnit to\ndiscover and test the units required to implement those demands.\nWhen the fitnessetests pass the developers are done :) The idea is to have\nself verifying demands as much as possible.\n\nfitnesse: http://www.fitnesse.org there is a demo there that you can try out\nto see if that would work for you.\nI&#39;ve heard of teams that use only JUnit, in those teams it is still the\ndevelopers writing the tests in colaboration with the customer/QA.\nI guess you can make anything work with communication; the opposite is also\ntrue.\n\nI hope thie helps,\n/ Joakim Ohlrogge\n\nOn 11/19/06, friends4ever_8in &lt;friends4ever_8in@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;   Hi all,\n&gt; I am a new member to join the grp.\n&gt;\n&gt; I needed some help. Please suggest something in this regard.\n&gt;\n&gt; I have always been in testing and that too functinality/manual\n&gt; testing. So I was never involved in deveopment or automated testing.\n&gt;\n&gt; But these days, talks are going on in our project to automate some of\n&gt; our testing tasks. For this they want to use Junit as the main testing\n&gt; tool. But also, we want to have a GUI, through which test data can be\n&gt; entered or the other option being, maintaining the test data in an xml\n&gt; file and then automating the process of extracting values from that\n&gt; file and using those values in test cases which can be run\n&gt; continuously one after the another, each time taking a different set\n&gt; of value from the file.\n&gt;\n&gt; Also, the result of the test case should be communicated back to the\n&gt; tester.\n&gt;\n&gt; Please suggest how this can be achieved and what sort of\n&gt; framework/design should be used for this test suite.\n&gt;\n&gt; Will be waiting for response from all the members of the group.\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
