It took me a little while to figure it out, but what was\nhappening was a test method was throwing an exception because of some\ndatabase error.  The tearDown method attempted to cleanup after the test and\nit also threw a database exception.  All I got back was the exception that\noccurred in tearDown, not the exception that occurred in the test method.\n\nIt was a real pain because I had to modify the production code to catch and\nprint the exception so I could uncover the actual problem.\n\nMy preferred solution would be to print both exceptions.  If I get an\nexception in testFoo and in tearDown, JUnit should print the following:\n\n1) testFoo(net.iss.FooTest) \njava.lang.Exception\n\tat ...\nException in tearDown:\njava.lang.Exception\n\tat ...\n\nI would be willing to put together a patch to do this.  Comments?\n\nMatt\n\n",
