I think I&#39;ve got what I want to learn and decide to<br/>\nstart PRACTICING right now. <br/>\n<br/>\nHere is the summary of what I learned:<br/>\n<br/>\n* automated unit testing is possible for commericial software development.<br/>\n* for experienced testers, the time should be shorter.<br/>\n* for team new to unit testing, there may be some prodctivity drop at<br/>\nthe  begining. Like the first 3-6 months. <br/>\n* it is best to consider the extra effort, like learning curve,<br/>\nespecially at the project planning phase. <br/>\n* and lots more ...<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks to all who ever helped. <br/>\n<br/>\nCheers, <br/>\n- Frank</div>",
