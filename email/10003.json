In my<br/>\nopinion, this is truly dreadful behavior. Yet there seems to be no way<br/>\nto modify this behavior without changing the source code. And this is<br/>\nbecause of what is, IMHO and with all due respect to Beck and Gamma,<br/>\nbad design: all the Assert.assert* methods are static.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile a discussion of the design decisions in junit would probably be<br/>\nenlightening, that&#39;s not my goal; here. I would just like suggestions<br/>\nof how to get the strings, in their entirities, into the output.<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps the answer is to write my own subclass of TestRunner, but then<br/>\nI would have to figure out how to integrate the new TestRunner into<br/>\nJBuilder.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny help would be appreciated.</div>",
