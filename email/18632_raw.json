This assumes that there\n&gt; &gt; are no constraints on the output.  Lets just say\n&gt; that\n&gt; &gt; the output is just an int\n&gt; &gt; c.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Suppose c can only be 1 or 2.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Well, that implies further constraints on the\n&gt; inputs,\n&gt; &gt; so we have to go back and reconstrain.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; However in this example c can be anything, so we\n&gt; just\n&gt; &gt; calculate the possible outputs.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Then we run it through testing.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Now we could test\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; a = 22\n&gt; &gt; a = 23\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; etc.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; but that would be silly since we assume that\n&gt; &gt; since we passed values through our enumerated\n&gt; branch\n&gt; &gt; list, that represent the beginning and end of the\n&gt; &gt; range of allowed values and even the points\n&gt; external\n&gt; &gt; to that range, we covered everything.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; So now I can look at my generated test code\n&gt; &gt; and see all the inputs, the expected outputs,\n&gt; &gt; and run the tests.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I personally would like this since it does a lot\n&gt; of\n&gt; &gt; the grunt work for me.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; It&#39;s possible to have a method\n&gt; &gt; with a gazillion variables and paths...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; but I would think that that would be a ripe case\n&gt; for\n&gt; &gt; refactoring, because it&#39;s tricky to test :-)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; As a matter of fact...it would be nice to have\n&gt; &gt; something that enumerates the branches and\n&gt; generates a\n&gt; &gt; report on which methods has a number of branches\n&gt; over\n&gt; &gt; a certain limit...for code refactoring and\n&gt; maintenance\n&gt; &gt; purposes.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Cheers,\n&gt; &gt; - Ole\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- C�(c)dric Beust �&quot;  &lt;cbeust@...&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; On 1/3/07, Ole Ersoy &lt;ole_ersoy@...&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We first have to agree on what 100% means.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I provided a very simple example in the\n&gt; earlier\n&gt; &gt; &gt; post.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The example gives a 100% tested tested method\n&gt; &gt; &gt; example,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; given that the assumptions hold.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This example can be entirely generated using\n&gt; &gt; &gt; DataType\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; meta data.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, but your example is too simple since it\n&gt; only\n&gt; &gt; &gt; contains one branch (most\n&gt; &gt; &gt; examples extolling the virtues of code coverage\n&gt; have\n&gt; &gt; &gt; this flaw :-)).\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 100% coverage means you should cover all the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; possible branches of your code,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; which is impossible to achieve in practice. \n&gt; Even\n&gt; \n=== message truncated ===\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
