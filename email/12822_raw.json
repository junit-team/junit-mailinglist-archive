I&#39;m not sure. I\nbasically only used checked exceptions because the way I understand it:\nruntime exceptions are for circumstances that you can not foresee and\ntherefore can not handle.\n\n \n\nThe java tutorial&#39;s opinion on exceptions tends not to agree with you.\nIt seems they propose the rigorous use of checked exceptions and\ninfrequent use of runtime exceptions. I&#39;m just a newbie so if I&#39;ve got\nthe whole story wrong, please give an explanation :-)\n\n \n\nTo extend the example below with the FileNotFoundException, What is the\neffect of throwing a runtime exception? Will the program terminate with\nthis exception? Also if the name of the file was chosen by the user\ninstead, would it be better to use a checked exception?\n\n \n\nThanks for all your help.\n\nPico\n\n&gt;Pico, previous replies to your question have hopefully given you some\n&gt;guidance in testing exceptions, but i have to raise some questions\n&gt;about your error handling strategy in general...\n\n&gt;&lt;warning&gt;\n&gt;I am going to make a case against checked exceptions.  This is a much\n&gt;discussed topic, and you should be able to find many differing\n&gt;opinions.  For a detailed argument /against/ checked exceptions in\n&gt;java, see Bruce Eckels article:\n&gt;http://www.mindview.net/Etc/Discussions/CheckedExceptions\n&gt;&lt;/warning&gt;\n\n&gt;--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Pico Geyer&quot; &lt;picog@s...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; ...\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; try{\n&gt;&gt;       statement1\n&gt;&gt;       statement2\n&gt;&gt; }\n&gt;&gt; catch(ExceptionType1 e1){\n&gt;&gt;       System.err.println(&quot;The following exception occurred &quot; +\n&gt;&gt; e1.toString());\n&gt;&gt; }\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I know that this is not a very good way of handling exceptions...\n&gt;Glad you noticed :)!\n\n&gt;&gt; The most obvious solution would be to let the method throw all\n&gt;&gt; exceptions that are generated. \n&gt;For argument&#39;s sake, lets explore that option...\n\n&gt;Here&#39;s a question: if you&#39;re not going to do anything about an\n&gt;exception, why bother catching it?  And logging doesn&#39;t count - it&#39;s\n&gt;mere hand-waving.  In fact, here&#39;s how i would rate the possible\n&gt;responses to a typical exception:\n\n&gt;1. Catch it and do nothing - if you do this, i /will/ fire you!\n&gt;2. Catch it and log it - marginally better, but you&#39;re still fired.\n&gt;3. Catch it, log it and rethrow it - you can keep your job, but your\n&gt;log file will be filled up with the same exception logged repeatedly.\n&gt;4. Catch it and rethrow it - better, but if so, why catch it in the\n&gt;first place?\n\n&gt;(note that the topmost layers of your code are exempt - they obviously\n&gt;have to catch all exceptions and at least report them).\n\n&gt;If the answer to item 4. is that you have to catch exceptions because\n&gt;the compiler forces you to, then your problem is the over-use of\n&gt;checked exceptions.\n\n&gt;&gt; The problem is that there are 5 or 6 different types of \n&gt;&gt; exceptions that this method can generate and \n&gt;&gt; this seems to make my code very messy.\n&gt;/Any/ piece of code can raise dozens of exceptions, but you don&#39;t have\n&gt;to respond to most of them because they&#39;re /unchecked/.  I am curious\n&gt;why throwing your 5/6 exception makes your code messy - is it because\n&gt;they are checked?\n\n&gt;Consider what happens if you get in the habit of not using checked\n&gt;exceptions and wrapping any existing checked exceptions with a\n&gt;RuntimeException:\n\n&gt;    try {\n&gt;        new FileInputStream(new File(&quot;/tmp/temp.txt&quot;));\n&gt;    }\n&gt;    catch (FileNotFoundException e) {\n&gt;        throw new RuntimeException(e);\n&gt;    }\n&gt;\n&gt;Now the client code isn&#39;t /forced/ to write a catch block for the\n&gt;FileNotFoundException. If the client actually needs to respond to this\n&gt;particular exception, use a specific extension of RuntimeException.\n&gt;\n&gt;What you&#39;ll often find, however, is that the majority of your code\n&gt;won&#39;t actually care about exceptions, leaving them to propogate up to\n&gt;your top-level controllers where they can be communicated to users in\n&gt;some fashion.\n\n&gt;I admit i&#39;m presenting an over-simplified view of the problem;\n&gt;moreover, this attitude towards exception-handling makes most sense\n&gt;within an environment supported by rigorous and automated unit\n&gt;testing.  Such environments encourage a rather simple strategy for\n&gt;dealing with exceptions:\n&gt;* Fix the bug in your code that /caused/ the exception, instead of\n&gt;writing more code to respond to bad code. *\n\n&gt;Sorry if i&#39;ve gone off on a tangential rant: i don&#39;t really have\n&gt;enough evidence to assume you are suffering from over-use of checked\n&gt;exceptions.  In any case, i hope this is food for thought.\n\n&gt;Cheers, lasitha.\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
