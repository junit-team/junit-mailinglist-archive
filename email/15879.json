You&#39;ve always<br/>\nknown a good waterfall-based process is the right way to develop software<br/>\nprojects. Come to the Waterfall 2006 conference and see how a sequential<br/>\ndevelopment process can benefit your next project. Learn how slow,<br/>\ndeliberate handoffs (with signatures!) between groups can slow the rate of<br/>\nchange on any project so that development teams have more time to spend on<br/>\nanticipating user needs through big, upfront design.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKeynotes<br/>\n- Put Testing Where It Belongs--At the End by Brian Marick<br/>\n- Dead Fish Can&#39;t Swim But They Can Float Down a Waterfall by Tim Lister<br/>\n- Extreme Programming Uninstalled by Ron Jeffries<br/>\n- Super Model Driven Architecture: An Update From the OMG by Tyra Banks<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso check out the exciting tutorials.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.waterfall2006.com/\">http://www.waterfall2006.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nShare and Enjoy,<br/>\n<br/>\n    David Saff<br/>\n<br/>\nAlex Viggio wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; AGILE 2006<br/>\n&gt; July 23-29, 2006<br/>\n&gt; Hyatt Regency Hotel<br/>\n&gt; Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; *** CFP SUBMISSION DEADLINES WILL SOON ARRIVE ***<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; - January 31, 2006:  Discovery Session, Experience Reports, Hands-on<br/>\n&gt;    Sessions, Tutorials<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; - February 28, 2006:  Research Papers, Educators&#39; Symposium<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Agile 2006 will be an exciting conference about techniques and<br/>\n&gt; technologies, attitudes and policies, research and experience, and the<br/>\n&gt; management and development sides of agile software development. The<br/>\n&gt; agile approach focuses on delivering business value early in the project<br/>\n&gt; lifetime and being able to incorporate emergent requirements. It<br/>\n&gt; accentuates the use of rich, informal communication channels and<br/>\n&gt; frequent delivery of running, tested systems, while attending to the<br/>\n&gt; human component of software development.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Agile 2006 gives attendees access to the latest thinking in this domain,<br/>\n&gt; and bridges communities that rarely get a proper chance to exchange<br/>\n&gt; ideas and thoughts. It brings together researchers from labs and<br/>\n&gt; academia with executives, managers, and developers in the trenches of<br/>\n&gt; software development. The conference is not about a single methodology<br/>\n&gt; or approach, but rather provides a forum for the exchange of information<br/>\n&gt; regarding all agile development technologies.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Visit the conference website at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.agile2006.com\">http://www.agile2006.com</a> for details on<br/>\n&gt; all submission categories and links to the online submission areas.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We invite submissions for the following:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; **Research paper<br/>\n&gt; An original contribution to the field of agile development. These<br/>\n&gt; submissions have the potential to promote reflection in the field, to<br/>\n&gt; deepen our understanding of agile approaches, to influence future<br/>\n&gt; developments, and to inspire innovation.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; **Educators&#39; Symposium<br/>\n&gt; A one-day event targeted particularly for agile educators. Sessions here<br/>\n&gt; may take a variety of forms, such as papers, panels and activities.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; **Experience Report<br/>\n&gt; An opportunity to describe what did or didn&#39;t work for you on a project.<br/>\n&gt; Experience reports allow practitioners to share practical advice and<br/>\n&gt; warnings to other teams.  The proposal is a short summary of your<br/>\n&gt; experience which will result in a paper presentation at the conference.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; **Discovery Session<br/>\n&gt; An opportunity for conference attendees to learn from each other about a<br/>\n&gt; relevant topic and share the concrete outcomes after the session. These<br/>\n&gt; 90 or 180 minute sessions may take several formats including a think<br/>\n&gt; tank, a goldfish bowl or a workshop.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; **Tutorial<br/>\n&gt; An opportunity for an expert to share knowledge with others through a<br/>\n&gt; combination of lecture and exercise. Tutorials may be either 90 or 180<br/>\n&gt; minutes.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; **Hands-on session<br/>\n&gt; An all-day or multi-day event during which participants are encouraged<br/>\n&gt; to drop in and stay from one hour to all day to work hands-on developing<br/>\n&gt; software. In past years, hands-on events featured the FIT Fest, which<br/>\n&gt; provided opportunities to use FIT and FitNesse.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; YAHOO!
