Below is the a\njavadoc entry for the ClassPathTestCollector to help determine if this\nis where you should go.\n\n/**\n * An implementation of a TestCollector that consults the\n * class path. It considers all classes on the class path\n * excluding classes in JARs. It leaves it up to subclasses\n * to decide whether a class is a runnable Test.\n *\n * @see TestCollector\n */\npublic abstract class ClassPathTestCollector implements TestCollector\n\n\nYou will still have to look at executing the test, but I believe that\nyou can look at junit.runner.LoadingTestCollector , and\njunit.runner.TestCaseClassLoader to get a feel for how the test cases\ncan be loaded.\n\nOverall, I think you will find that the JUNIT SOURCE jar file (src.jar)\nhas more than enough code to give you a good idea of how to write an app\nthat will do exactly what you need.\n\nGood Luck,\n\n\t--Ryan\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: DiFrango, Ron [mailto:ron.difrango@...] \nSent: Friday, March 08, 2002 1:51 PM\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: [junit] Test Locator\n\n\nGuys,\n\nI know that I have seen something about this, but I could not find it\nanywhere.  What I am looking for is code that will search the classpath\nfor all the available tests.  If it could also execute the tests that\nwould be great.\n\nI do know that this is available as an ANT task, but it is not possible\nat this time to add that into our ANT build process.\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nRon\n\n\n \n************************************************************************\n**\nThe information transmitted herewith is sensitive information intended\nonly for use by the individual or entity to which it is addressed.
