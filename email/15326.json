We need to balance the need for flexibility of extension with the need for flexibility of design evolution. Revealing all the details of our implementation means we can&#39;t change anything. And so we are left, as you said, revealing only as much as we are certain will be useful.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I basically agree with that. Protected methods are fine, as long as <br/>\nyou&#39;re reasonably confident they&#39;re right and you&#39;re willing to maintain <br/>\nthem in the future.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; This leaves me unsettled. I know that my frameworks aren&#39;t as useful as they could be, but I also know that I would regret opening them up completely. I don&#39;t see how to strike a better balance than we strike with JUnit, though, so I&#39;ll live with it.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think extreme programming/agile development offers a path out of this <br/>\nconundrum. Instead of looking for one big bang release that then stands <br/>\nuntouched for a few years, look to more incremental releases (like in <br/>\nthe earlier days of JUnit). Two week release cycles give you plenty of <br/>\nopportunities to open up the framework to extension as people actually <br/>\nneed and request the extension. I&#39;ve found by experience that I tend to <br/>\nbe very bad at predicting what actually will be needed, even by myself. <br/>\nTherefore the longer I can delay the decision, the more likely it is <br/>\nthat the eventual decision will be correct.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, at least half of this is stuff I learned first from your <br/>\nbook. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n﻿Elliotte Rusty Harold  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:elharo@...\">elharo@...</a><br/>\nXML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/\">http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim\">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim</a></div>",
