I want t=\r\no write test cases that reference interfaces only\nas I want to publish them=\r\n as part of a spec =96 they are to define the\nsemantics of classes. For ins=\r\ntance, I want to write a test case for\nlists like this:\n\nclass TestList ext=\r\nends TestCase {\n\tList testedObject =3D null;\n\tpublic void test1() {\n\t  test=\r\nedObject.clear();\n\t  testedObject.add(&quot;object&quot;);\n\t  assertTrue(1=3D=3Dteste=\r\ndObject.size());\n\t}\n}\n\nHow can I use TestList without subclassing it and ex=\r\nplicitly\ninitialising  testedObject in setUp() (or another method using the=\r\n\nJUnit4 annotation). In other words, is there an elegant dependency\ninjecti=\r\non mechanism that can be used here? I could use a constructor\nto set the im=\r\nplementation class instance,  but I understand that JUnit\ntest runners use =\r\nreflection to instantiate test cases. A solution\nwould be a test runner tha=\r\nt uses an map associating test case classes\nwith implementation classes (to=\r\n be tested), and uses this info to\ninstantiate the test cases. Is there any=\r\nthing like this out there?\nThanks in advance for any idea!\n\nJens\n\n\n",
