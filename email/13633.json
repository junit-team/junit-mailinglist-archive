As long as you have a <br/>\nconnection object you should be able to query it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt; Or ordering<br/>\n&gt; methods and then calling them in that order?  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No problem at all. Of course you can call methods in the order you want. <br/>\nThat&#39;s the whole point. It is your decision in which order you invoke <br/>\nmethods on an object. The class does not say some orders are OK but some <br/>\naren&#39;t. if the method&#39;s public, you can invoke it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Or creating widgets, adding<br/>\n&gt; listeners and then starting the main Swing thread?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Fine. You can add listeners whenever you feel like it. We normally add <br/>\nthem before we display the widget, but if it&#39;s necessary to add or <br/>\nremove them later we can do that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure what you mean by the &quot;main Swing thread&quot;. if that&#39;s the <br/>\nsame as the main AWT thread, it&#39;s started automatically as necessary. it <br/>\ndoes not need to be started through the public API. That&#39;s as it should be.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;The problem comes about when people design APIs that require <br/>\n&gt;&gt;something like g.initializeContext(), g.setColor, and <br/>\n&gt;&gt;g.setFont before I&#39;m allowed to call g.drawLine. Any <br/>\n&gt;&gt;initialization that&#39;s necessary for an object to get into its <br/>\n&gt;&gt;correct state should be performed in the constructor.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s good advice, it&#39;s just impossibly hard to achieve in reality.<br/>\n&gt; Otherwise, we would never need setters.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Setters are for *changing* the state of an object, not for initializing it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Complicated sequences of code execution are relics of <br/>\n&gt;&gt;procedural thinking.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We&#39;re not talking about &quot;complicated&quot; but &quot;ordered&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Order is fine. The problem is when some orders are allowed and others <br/>\nare not. Only legal, reasonable orders should be accessible through the <br/>\npublic interface.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nElliotte Rusty Harold  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:elharo@...\">elharo@...</a><br/>\nXML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/\">http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim\">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim</a></div>",
