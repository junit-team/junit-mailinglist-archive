At what point do you think there are too many cooks in the kitchen,...or is there no threshhold, assuming that your team sticks to the tenets of TDD/XP/Agile/&#39;general good coding practices&#39;?\nAdditionally, my team has been struggling with maintaining our tests at green bar, so my second question is what is a &#39;code size (number of classes)&#39; threshhold for meaningful Unit Testing?\nWe have upwards of 10 developers working on ~1500 classes.  Our tests are a pain to maintain - takes too long to run completely in Eclipse before checking in; takes ~6 hours to run and report the nightlybuild (includes coverage testing); we&#39;re nowhere near green bar, so recognizing when there is something new (from yesterday) is near impossible, and possibly impractical (in a 40 hour work week).\nI&#39;m not necessarily looking for any answers,...but maybe someone has some insight - has been there before - or will just commisserate with me.  :)\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
