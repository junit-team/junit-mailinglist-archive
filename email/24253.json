This is a<br/>\ncore problem, some of the basic functionality of Junit is hard to use.<br/>\nBefore tackling new features let&#39;s make the basics simple.<br/>\n<br/>\n@David - you&#39;re correct most developers are using eclipse, maven and ant.<br/>\nMany of these bypass Junit mechanisms for finding and running tests. Why?<br/>\nAny chance it&#39;s because Junit doesn&#39;t yet do what they need? Perhaps with a<br/>\nmore flexible Junit core the could reduce the amount of code they need to<br/>\nsupport Junit. That might make it easier to decouple the Junit innovation<br/>\ncycle from the other tools.<br/>\n<br/>\n@Charlie thanks for the clear explanation of what NUnit does.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for all the other replies.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was busy at a client last week and will be this week too, hence my<br/>\nsilence. I&#39;ve just stolen 10 minutes during my kids ski lessons to reply<br/>\nvia my phone. Please excuse the resulting errors.<br/>\n<br/>\nTrust @Marc to represent my key point well.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<br/>\nMark<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
