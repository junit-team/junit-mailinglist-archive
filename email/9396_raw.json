The project is quite dead but if you&#39;re\n&gt; interested in the \n&gt; idea behind it, you can have a look at JUnit-addons\n&gt; Runner.  Same idea, \n&gt; simpler implementation.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;During their execution, the classes have access\n&gt; to \n&gt; &gt; external ressources (database or network\n&gt; connections...) \n&gt; &gt; via Services and can use the Logger to save useful\n&gt; information.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Vladamir, are you saying you don&#39;t need such a\n&gt; Logger any more?\n&gt; \n&gt; Never say &#39;never&#39; but I never had to use a logger\n&gt; for my tests.  So far. \n&gt;   But if I have to, I want to have this option open.\n&gt; \n&gt; My experience with System.out is that you don&#39;t\n&gt; write them when you are \n&gt; writing your tests, but only when something goes\n&gt; wrong.  If your test \n&gt; for &#39;Object myfunction()&#39; is:\n&gt; \n&gt;     Integer actual = myClass.myfunction();\n&gt;     assertEquals(new Integer(3), actual);\n&gt; \n&gt; and it fails with a ClassCastException (typically\n&gt; you don&#39;t know much \n&gt; about what really happens), you will be tempted to\n&gt; put a System.out to \n&gt; see what was returned:\n&gt; \n&gt;     System.out.println(&quot;returned class : &quot; +\n&gt; actual.getClass());\n&gt; \n&gt; IMO this smells because you will have to look at the\n&gt; result (output, \n&gt; log) and after writing a few hundreds of these\n&gt; statements your console \n&gt; (or log) will be flooded with unuseful output\n&gt; (because you have now \n&gt; information about something that works).\n&gt; \n&gt; What I do instead is use the JUnit-addons library\n&gt; (of course, since I \n&gt; wrote it!) and write:\n&gt; \n&gt;     ObjectAssert.assertInstanceOf(Integer.class,\n&gt; actual);\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) if it fails, I will get the message &quot;expected of\n&gt; class &lt;Integer&gt; but \n&gt; was of class &lt;Boolean&gt;&quot;:  Exactly the same\n&gt; information as with a \n&gt; System.out BUT...\n&gt; \n&gt; 2) if it doesn&#39;t fail, I will not get any output\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; How do people fix such a failing test? What\n&gt; information do you use to\n&gt; &gt; diagnose and fix it? Or is it always the time to\n&gt; reach for your\n&gt; &gt; debugger?\n&gt; \n&gt; I hope that I explained how I fix failing tests: I\n&gt; try to grab as much \n&gt; information as possible but without writing anything\n&gt; on the console/log.\n&gt; \n&gt; And how can a logger be useful: typically to record\n&gt; the environment \n&gt; where the tests were executed (name of the server,\n&gt; database, what is the \n&gt; locale, ...) and not how they were executed.  But I\n&gt; may change my mind \n&gt; on this.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Vladimir\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; Vladimir Ritz Bossicard\n&gt; www.bossicard.com\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
