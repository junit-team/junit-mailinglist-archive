It seems that the functionality that you seek could be provided by\nhandling test return codes other than &quot;fail&quot; (or the absence of &quot;fail&quot;).  In\nprevious test harnesses, I have found it useful to bucket test statii as\nfollows:\n\n    PASS\n    FAIL\n    UNIMPLEMENTED\n    EXCEPTION\n    ABORT\n    UNKNOWN\n\nPass and fail to the obvious thing, and are the usual test status.  Tests\nthat are defined but their class implementation isn&#39;t complete, or for\nwhatever reason the test hadn&#39;t been implemented can flag themselves as\nUnimplemented.  Unexpected exceptions that can be handled by the test would\nflag an Exception status (this may seem redundant with Fail, except that the\ntest can handle the exception and continue).  Abort means that the test\ncouldn&#39;t be setup (or torn down), or had some environmental problem.\nUnknown is for good measure and is defined as &quot;none of the above&quot;.\n\nIn the past, I have implemented these codes as static ints.  In the JUnit\nimplementation, Fail is denoted by an AssertionFailedError, and silence is\ngolden.\n\nPerhaps it would be simpler to implement these statii as additional methods\nin framework.Assert class and add corresponding vectors and methods to\nframework.TestResult?  Something like Assert.assertUnimplemented() and\nassertUnimplemented(String).  It shouldn&#39;t be too hard to teach\nframework.TestResult to tally the buckets and amend the test summary report.\n\nCheers,\n\n_chas_\n\n&gt; From: &lt;jcarpenter@...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;junit@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Monday, March 12, 2001 1:59 PM\n&gt; Subject: [junit] todo tests in JUnit (think Perl)\n&gt;\n\n&gt; I sent the following email to junit@....  By posting\n&gt; this email I am hoping to receive additional guidance and insight\n&gt; from the JUnit community.  Please copy any responses to\n&gt; jcarpenter@....\n&gt; ______________________________________________________\n&gt; We are finding that there are times when it may be desirable to check\n&gt; into source control code that is not fully implemented.  The tests\n&gt; may be defined, but the corresponding class implementation may not be\n&gt; complete.\n&gt;\n&gt; Perl&#39;s standard framework has the concept of a todo test.  A simple\n&gt; enough way to notate such a test in JUnit would be to name a method\n&gt; within a test todoBlah, rather than testBlah.  To safely go down this\n&gt; road, it is desirable to extend JUnit to report on what todo tests\n&gt; are in the code base in addition to the normal tests.  I am\n&gt; considering writting such an extension and contributing it back to\n&gt; the JUnit project.  Unfortuantely, I don&#39;t know where in the JUnit\n&gt; code base to start.\n&gt;\n&gt; Can you provide guidance as to what classes would need to be changed\n&gt; to support this functionality?  Do you have any suggestions\n&gt; to improve the idea?  Ideally this can fit into JUnit&#39;s normal\n&gt; extension framework.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thank you for your time and consideration.\n&gt;\n&gt; Jimmy Carpenter\n&gt; jcarpenter@...\n&gt; __________________________________________\n&gt; Erik Meade kindly responded with the following:\n&gt; *******************\n&gt; Jimmy,\n&gt;\n&gt; I think the class you want to start with is junit.framework.TestSuite.\n&gt; Take a look at the constructor which accepts a Class.  I believe this\n&gt; is where the tests get loaded by reflection...\n&gt;\n&gt; If you want more input I would suggest you post this to the JUnit\n&gt; group,\n&gt; which you can sign up with from the junit.org page, and/or a forum on\n&gt; http://sourceforge.net/projects/junit/\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt; Erik Meade             emeade@...\n&gt; Senior Consultant      Object Mentor, Inc.\n&gt; http://www.junit.org\n&gt;\n\n\n\n",
