I can&#39;t do\npaper lists as I usually lose or damage them  somehow, and my mental list\ncan easily become lost ;)\n\nI do realise though that this means I do have to mentally block out the red\ntests/suites that are just those  not implemented, from those that are\nfailing.\n\nMaybe JUnit could be enhanced to have Amber tests for these situations?\n\nGreen: Test passes\nAmber: Test fails as it isn&#39;t implemented\nRed:   test fails\n\nWhat do people think?\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Ilja Preuss [mailto:preuss@...]\nSent: 07 February 2003 14:03\nTo: testdrivendevelopment@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: AW: [TDD] Re: Test-first in less iterative organizations\n\n\nRon Jeffries wrote:\n\n&gt; However, unlike some other practitioners, I almost never write down any\n&gt; notes about tests I want to remember for possible implementation.\n&gt; I have no\n&gt; physical scratchpad, and generally do not perceive myself to be working\n&gt; through some list. Surely there is some of that but my perception is much\n&gt; more that once one test is done, the next becomes obvious.\n&gt;\n&gt; It&#39;s possible that I have more of a list in my head than I&#39;m\n&gt; aware of. It&#39;s\n&gt; also possible that with a century of experience and a highly intuitive and\n&gt; interrupt-driven style of thinking, things just &quot;come&quot; to me. Still, I\n&gt; perceive nothing very &quot;scratchpad&quot; about the way I think, and I use no\n&gt; physical forward-looking list at all.\n\nThat aligns with my experience - I typically have some rough ideas about\nwhat I probably will need to test, but I don&#39;t write them down. It&#39;s mainly\nthe state of the production code which motivates my next test, not a\npredetermined list.\n\nI have the suspicion that this is very individual; there is a programmer I\nmuch like to pair with because of her very different way of thinking -\npossibly having a test list written down could smooth pairing sessions here.\n\nRegards, Ilja\n\n\n\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\ntestdrivendevelopment-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n\n\n\nYour use of Yahoo!
