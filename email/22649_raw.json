I would expect it to be something more\n&gt; than a way of avoiding that kind of boilerplate.\n\nI just explained that in my previous reply. When the boilerplate that is\navoided is so excessive, the syntactic sugar itself becomes a valuable\nfeature.\n\n&gt; As an example of the kind of thing I think a class rule would enable,\n&gt; is that it might allow the rule to dynamically pass values to the\n&gt; test class&#39;s constructor based on some dynamic criteria (say a souped\n&gt; up version of Parameterized)\n\nNo. Test class instantiation occurs per-method, not per-class, thus\nclass-level is not where it can be changed.\n\n&gt; or perhaps change the runner that will run the tests,\n\nNo. The Runner is what invokes the rules, so rules can&#39;t change the runner.\n\n&gt; or dynamically disable certain tests (say based on the OS the\n&gt; test is running on).\n\nA class rule could skip an entire class of tests, if you wanted it to.\n\n&gt; Something that is not possible with an @BeforeClass\n&gt; or @AfterClass annotation.\n\nThe ability to package a common class-level setup/teardown behaviour and\nre-use it in many places is what rules provide over embedded\nbefore/after methods. That&#39;s very useful by itself, and they don&#39;t have\nto do anything more to justify their existence.\n\nMax.\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
