Whoever has been<br/>\n&gt; putting JUnit up on maven, I take it, hasn&#39;t been also putting up<br/>\n&gt; junit-dep?  I&#39;m sorry to say that I&#39;m very aware that a lot of people<br/>\n&gt; are indebted to the anonymous time-donor who&#39;d been keeping the maven<br/>\n&gt; repos up-to-date until several months ago.  I&#39;ve been reluctant to<br/>\n&gt; accept full responsibility for feeding a repository I neither use nor<br/>\n&gt; fully understand until some point where I was sure I could quickly<br/>\n&gt; respond to millions of users who got their junit jars auto-updated in<br/>\n&gt; a way that broke all their tests.

Since junit is present both as<br/>\njunit:junit and junit:junit-dep, it&#39;s far too easy for a project that,<br/>\nsay, depends on junit itself, and also uses jmock&#39;s junit4 integration<br/>\n(which declares a dependency on junit-dep) to end up with BOTH junit and<br/>\njunit-dep on its classpath.... potentially of different versions.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, I think there&#39;s a pretty solid rationale to decide to<br/>\nback-fill the missing junit-dep uploads, and decide to never upload any<br/>\nnew versions of the junit jar with hamcrest, so that Maven users will<br/>\ngradually migrate to using a single Maven artifactId for JUnit.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMax.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
