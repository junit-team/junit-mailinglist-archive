If you don&#39;t know\n&gt;&gt;&gt;about it, Google it, download it and try it. It&#39;s\n&gt;&gt;&gt;not quite what you\n&gt;&gt;&gt;want, but it can be used to build and test your\n&gt;&gt;&gt;product every &#39;n&#39;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;minutes, and only if there has been CVS activity in\n&gt;&gt;&gt;the meantime.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Actually I already use CruiseControl and you are\n&gt;&gt;correct it is not quite what I had in mind.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;The scenario I am most interested in is a single\n&gt;&gt;developer working on a small section of the code on\n&gt;&gt;his/her own machine. They want to run tests regularly,\n&gt;&gt;during development, but why should they run the whole\n&gt;&gt;suite every time, when they are only changing a small\n&gt;&gt;section. The time it takes to do a test run is one of\n&gt;&gt;the major hurdles to getting developers to run the\n&gt;&gt;tests in the first place.\n&gt;\n&gt;This is exactly why I prefer to manually build test suites at\narbitrary \n&gt;levels.  I might have a DatabaseTestSuite that I run when working in\nthe \n&gt;persistence layer, or a StressTestSuite to run all the \n&gt;performance-related tests.  I can pick a suite at the appropriate\nlevel \n&gt;of granularity in the system and run it.  There are certainly times\nwhen \n&gt;I manually run all the unit tests in the system, and I also use\nAnthill \n&gt;to do that automatically on a set schedule, but there are times when I\n\n&gt;want finer-grained control.\n\nI believe that building the tests needs to be performed by a human,\nbecause that&#39;s where the knowledge lies. If there were a nice graphical\ntool to make it easy, would that help? Is it worth your while to build\nit?\n\nJ. B.
