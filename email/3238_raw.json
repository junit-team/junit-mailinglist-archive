And they\nsuggest\n  &gt; where any bugs encountered might be, even by t=\r\nheir absence (a\n  &gt; problematic condition may not be tested, and a set of t=\r\nests could\nrule\n  &gt; out a bunch of possible causes for a bug).\n  &gt;  \n\nThis =\r\nseems like a pretty weak argument to me.  They only document the\nset of \nth=\r\ne API that the authors chose to test, and they only test to the\nauthors&#39;\nde=\r\ngrees of comfortability.  Truth be known, just because JUnit is in use\ndoes=\r\n\nnot mean that the code is being tested thoroughly.  Right?  You may be\nrig=\r\nht\nthat it could show you what isn&#39;t tested, but not necessarily why.  And\n=\r\nit only\ngives you a clue as to what is not tested and what is.  There may n=\r\not be\na one\nto one mapping of the public API to the tests.\n\n  &gt; Heck, i&#39;d b=\r\ne happy if vendors would ship a set of tests to run on\ntheir\n  &gt; software i=\r\nn an actual customer environment, just to catch known\nproblems\n  &gt; (such as=\r\n conflicts and naming issues).  Open source projects should\n  &gt; include uni=\r\nt tests, of course. :}\n  &gt;\n  \nCan&#39;t (or don&#39;t want to) argue with this. :)\n=\r\n\n-jason\n\n",
