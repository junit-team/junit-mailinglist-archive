But still there are 2 theoretical\n&gt; questions:\n&gt; 1. How to implement TestListener in a TestCase? More\n&gt; exactly, how to add it?\n&gt; 2. What is the difference between setUp() and\n&gt; startTest()?\n\nI&#39;m far from an expert on the matter but...\n\n1. As far as I know TestListeners are merely observers of tests.\nUsually in \norder to provide Views on test progress to the tester (of the person\nclass -&gt; \nend user subclass) so that they can informed of the results. I may be\nmistaken \nhere but testers do not usually mess with TestListeners inside of a\nTestCase. In \nother words, they are interface elements. They follow (or are players\nin) the \nObserver Pattern as in the GOF book.\n\nhttp://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ObserverPattern\nhttp://c2.com/cgi/wiki?DesignPatternsBook\n\nThe TestRunner classes are the observers in the standard jUnit\nframework. \nThey indicate their interest of being notified of test\nprogress/events by \nregistering themselves with a TestResult. If you take a look at the\nsource code \ninside TestRunner classes you can see how this is done.\n\nThose who extend or enhance the framework may add the\nlisteners/observers in \na different way but the idea is the same.\n\n\n2. A tester puts in their code which does whatever is needed to set\nup a test&#39;s \nfixture in setUp(). Like opening a file, opening a database, or doing\nany \ninitializations which may be common across all tests in a TestCase.\n\nstartTest() is just for TestListeners it has nothing to do with a end\nuser&#39;s \nwriting of TestCase code. TestListeners are informed that a test has\nstarted \nthrough this interface. You can see this in the source code of\nTestResult.\n\nHowever, don&#39;t take my word for it as I can&#39;t even program in\nJava.\n\nAnthony Adachi\n\n\n",
