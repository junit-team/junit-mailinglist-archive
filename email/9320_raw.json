I went through some of the basic papers as JUnit Test Infected, junit cook book etc. but am not understanding the correct use of that. \n \nLike if I create a simple program like addition of two integers and want to pass the values of a and b to be some (i.e., generating the test cases), how can I do using the JUnit.  I created a JUnit program &quot;TestAddInt.java &quot;with a testAdd() method in that compared the resultant value of a and b with the expected value but its something like I took the values a and b as ints..TestAddInt.java but am not understanding how to bring the values of the original java program &quot;AddInt.java&quot;??\n \nI am pretty sure that if someone give a simple example, I will learn the rest. So I would be thankful if someone helps me out.\n \nRegards,\nPallavi\n\n\n---------------------------------\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
