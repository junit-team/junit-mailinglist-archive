In fact, I do some tests on my=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; equals functions by taking 2 objects that should be equal, and also\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; comparing 2 objects that are not. I also verify that they are not\n&gt; &gt; the=\r\n same objects (i.e. obj1 =3D=3D obj2)\n&gt; \n&gt; [Dave responded with:]\n&gt; Have a =\r\nlook at the Gargoyle extensions that Mike Bowler has written:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://g=\r\nsbase.sourceforge.net/\n&gt; \n&gt; Part of it is EqualsTester which does a compreh=\r\nensive verification of\n&gt; a class&#39;s equals() and hashCode() methods.  It sav=\r\nes alot of test code.\n\nThat&#39;s excellent. Downloading now. Thanks\n\n&gt; &gt; In fa=\r\nct, I just got hired by this company and they don&#39;t do ANY\n&gt; &gt; testing... I=\r\n&#39;m trying to move them forward in this, so I appreciate\n&gt; &gt; the tips.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nAre they interested in improving that?\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;This message contains commerci=\r\nal content, reader disgression is advised&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Also, watch for my book in =\r\nJuly: http://www.adaptionsoft.com/tddapg.htm\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;/commercial content&gt;\n\nI&#39;=\r\nve just pre-ordered your book on BN. Looking forward to reading it. I&#39;m\ncur=\r\nrently delving into several XP books (Java Tools for Extreme Programming,\na=\r\ns well as the Oreilly XP Cookbook)\n\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ll look into Mocks. I&#39;ve read a l=\r\nittle about them, but I&#39;m trying\n&gt; &gt; to take baby steps...\n&gt; \n&gt; They can ta=\r\nke a bit of effort to grok... but they are a very powerful\n&gt; testing tool. =\r\n I suggest EasyMock (www.easymock.org) as well as\n&gt; MockObjects (http://www=\r\n.mockobjects.com)\n\nThanks for the links. Got them bookmarked.\n\n&gt; &gt; My main =\r\nconcern is that the functionality involved serializing to a\n&gt; &gt; file, so I =\r\nthought I&#39;d need to exercise that in a test (i.e., saving\n&gt; &gt; to a known lo=\r\ncation, then making sure it loads from the same known\n&gt; &gt; location, etc).\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; 1) I&#39;d consider that more of an integration level test (which needs to\n=\r\n&gt; be done, but not as part of TDD)\n&gt; 2) when TDDing you should try to avoid=\r\n using external resources as\n&gt; much as possible\n&gt; 3) use createTempFile.. s=\r\nee\n&gt; http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.1/docs/api/java/io/File.html#createTempFi=\r\nle(j\n&gt; ava.lang.String,%20java.lang.String)\n\nGot a lot to learn about TDDin=\r\ng. Sucks trying to learn this while attempting\ndevelop software with a dead=\r\nline...\n\nThanks for the tips, and I&#39;m sure this list will be hearing from m=\r\ne again.\n\n\n",
