It appears\n&gt; that many \n&gt; &gt;people think there are &quot;magic formulas&quot; for working\n&gt; with JUnit. \n&gt; &gt;As a result, they ask silly questions like, &quot;How do\n&gt; I test an \n&gt; &gt;EJB with JUnit????&quot; The people who know the answer\n&gt; get so \n&gt; &gt;tired of writing, &quot;Search this list. Try it. What\n&gt; are you\n&gt; &gt;having trouble testing?&quot; that they simply stop\n&gt; responding. \n&gt; &gt;As a result, questions are not being answered.\n&gt; ................\n&gt; \n\nI agree with this opinion....before posting any doubt\nthe concerned person should really try and then only\nask.\n\nI asked that pariticular question(Y should i use\nJunit?) yesterday after searching and reading all docs\nincluding the framework.I didnt find any solid answer\nfor the same.\nafter that i thought there may be some real time\nissues which i may not aware..&#39;coz of that only i\nposted that question.....\n\n\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nMake a great connection at Yahoo!
