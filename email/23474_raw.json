[1] This causes the issue that for example IDEA&#39;s test \nrunner cannot report the test progress in real time - the tests are \nexecuted before the progress bar is even started.\n\nAs a long-term solution I&#39;m developing a new test runner [2] which \nsolves this issue and has also a bunch of other improvements. The first \nrelease of that test runner should be some time later this summer.\n\n[1] \nhttps://github.com/orfjackal/specsy/blob/master/src/main/scala/net/orfjackal/specsy/junit/SpecsyJUnitRunner.scala\n[2] https://github.com/orfjackal/jumi\n\n\nhuntchrisalias wrote on 17.6.2011 15:43:\n&gt; Hi there,\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m writing a custom test runner that is not easily able to determine\n&gt; how many tests will be executed in advance.\n&gt;\n&gt; The runner extends ParentRunner and its getChildren method is called\n&gt; prior to tests being executed via runChild. Each test is also described\n&gt; via describeChild.\n&gt;\n&gt; During runChild execution, if I create child descriptions of each child\n&gt; as each unforeseeable test occurs, then I get &quot;unrooted&quot; output.\n&gt;\n&gt; My actual use-case is that I have a test runner executing a series of\n&gt; tests within an html file. I would have to parse the html and its\n&gt; associated JavaScript to determine how many tests will be run. This\n&gt; would be tricky.\n&gt;\n&gt; Is there a recommended means of reporting the results of tests that are\n&gt; not determinable in advance?\n&gt;\n&gt; Kind regards,\n&gt; Christopher\n\n-- \nEsko Luontola\nwww.orfjackal.net\n\n",
