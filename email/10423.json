These <br/>\nmicrosoft documents can change with date and can remain same for <br/>\nmonths. Everytime this document changes, there is a mail in my <br/>\nmailbox having the document. I have made a test document in the <br/>\ndatabase, that everday its date changes so I get one document in my <br/>\nmailbox, but with different date.  But scanning a mailbox to find <br/>\none mail can be hard? The other properties I would like to test is <br/>\nam i getting the right document back? A document can be sent in <br/>\nvarious formats, like HTML, OR word. I want to make sure if the <br/>\nformat is right..I dont know how this is possible.. May be u can <br/>\nhelp.. Thanks!!!</div>",
