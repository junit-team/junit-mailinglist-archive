Running each test method in its own<br/>\n&gt;&gt; instance shields you from any problem.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; e.g. static class members are not safely initialized if you share <br/>\n&gt; instances.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure what you mean. Perhaps you could clarify? The static <br/>\nvariables will be initialized once when the class is first &quot;actively&quot; <br/>\nused, not when each instance is created. If you&#39;re using JUnit&#39;s Swing <br/>\nrunner and reloading classes each time, the static members will be <br/>\ninitialized once per run.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.artima.com/insidejvm/ed2/lifetype.html\">http://www.artima.com/insidejvm/ed2/lifetype.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, your comment made me realize that perhaps test <br/>\nmethods in a TestCase could share a fixture by storing that fixture in <br/>\nstatic variables. If the fixture includes an expensive database <br/>\nconnection, for example, could that connection not be created by the <br/>\nfirst test method and stored in a static variable for all subsequent <br/>\ntest methods to share? Not sure how you could close the connection at <br/>\nthe end of the last test method executed, though. Has anyone used <br/>\nstatic variables to share fixture objects among multiple test methods?<br/>\n<br/>\nbv<br/>\n--<br/>\nBill Venners<br/>\nArtima Software, Inc.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.artima.com\">http://www.artima.com</a> </span></blockquote></div>",
