I need to know the corre=\r\nct result from the other way around and \nsometimes it&#39;s hard to find anothe=\r\nr way. \n\nI am not quite sure if I fully understand what you mean. Are you \n=\r\nsaying, to write good test, you need two different &quot;approaches&quot; to \nsolve t=\r\nhe problem under test? Like in the following, trivial \nexample: \n\n public i=\r\nnt multiply(int a, int b) {\n  return a * b;\n }\n\n public void testMultiply()=\r\n {\n  // test the expected result, &quot;the other way round&quot;\n  assertEquals(5 + =\r\n5, x.multiply(5, 2);\n }\n\nI can see that this can get quite hard for non-tri=\r\nvial problems. \n\nIf this is what you meant, I think I have good news: In be=\r\nlieve this \nrigorous approach to unit testing is not necessary. It&#39;s perfer=\r\nctly \naccaptable to just write the test as: \n\n  assertEquals(5 * 2, x.multi=\r\nply(5, 2);\n\nThe point of automated unit testing is not to prove algorithmic=\r\n \ncorrectness but just to check real behavior against expected \nbehavior. I=\r\nn my opinion, the main benefit of _automated_ unit \ntesting is to be able t=\r\no re-run the tests after implementation \nchanges. And, after implementation=\r\n changes, you cannot be sure \nif &quot;the other way round&quot; is still another way=\r\n or if it has actually \nbecome &quot;the way&quot;. So don&#39;t bother in the first plac=\r\ne, and save a lot \nof time and pain. \n\nAgain: For me, automated unit tests =\r\nare primarily like an insurance \nagainst quality degradation when I change =\r\ncode. They are less \nimportant to prove correctness of the initial version =\r\nof the code I \nwrite. I tend to spend more time changeing existing code tha=\r\nn \nwriting new code, so that&#39;s fine for me. \n\nBottom line is, forget about =\r\nthe &quot;other way round&quot; issue. ;-) \n\nHasko \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
