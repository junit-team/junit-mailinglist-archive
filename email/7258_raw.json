I can&#39;t store it in a subclass of TestSetup,\n&gt; because then the Test contained by TestSetup won&#39;t have access to the\n&gt; data.  Is there a general way of doing this type of thing?  In fact,\n&gt; more generally, JUnit doesn&#39;t seem to have any concept of test data.\n&gt; All examples and documents I&#39;ve seen assume that the data can be\n&gt; hard-coded into the test itself, which is not always practical.  Are\n&gt; there generally accepted ways of loading data (and hierarchies of \n&gt; data)?\n&gt;\nLast week I published an article about driving unit tests with custom \nscripts using SuiteRunner (a JUnit runner). I was originally planning \nan article on table-driven tests, but ended up creating a simple \nscripting language instead of a table of data for my example. But the \nidea is the same. You can customize the way a org.suiterunner.Suite \nexecutes its tests, including by sucking in data and using it to \nperform the tests. Here&#39;s the article:\n\nhttp://www.artima.com/suiterunner/scriptdriven.html\n\nIf you can&#39;t figure out how to apply this technique to your particular \nproblem, post to the SuiteRunner Forum and we&#39;ll try to help.\n\nhttp://www.artima.com/forums/forum.jsp?forum=61\n\nBill\n--\nBill Venners\nArtima Software, Inc.\nhttp://www.artima.com\n\n\n",
