I wrote my test class, and i saw that the side effects \noccured as i planned.\n\nI create a new method, without return, that basically verifies some \nconditions, and so it call the other methods (already tested) in \nacordance with these conditions.\n\nSo, my doubt is the following one:\n\nHow i make the test of this new method without remaking the test \nalready done?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
