So that\n&gt; makes good sense (to me) as a single test.\n\nHmm.. interesting, I would tend to think of save & load as two\nseparate, but complimentary, behaviours. \n\n&gt; If you had some kind of requirement that things written with\n&gt; saveLicense have a particular format, or that loadLicense expects a\n&gt; particular format (for 3rd party integration or something), then \n&gt; you&#39;d have more behaviors and probably want to make separate tests.  \n\nSo then, where does that format come from in the problem in hand?  You\nmust certainly have a format defined.. or how could you write either\nsave or load?\n\n&gt; Even in\n&gt; that case, though, testing that stuff saved with saveLicense can be\n&gt; loaded with loadLicense isn&#39;t a bad thing to do.\n\nYes.  Agreed.  But try to avoid using a file to do it.\n\nDave\n\n\n",
