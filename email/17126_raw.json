So if I have three\ntest cases in the su=\r\nite, and the first and third test cases succeed,\nthen the output file looks=\r\n like &quot;..F.&quot; followed by the errors and a\nsummary of how many successes/fai=\r\nlures. There are about 80 test cases\nin the suite I&#39;m working with, and it =\r\nis very time consuming and error\nprone to try to figure out which tests suc=\r\nceeded and which ones failed\nfrom a long list of dots and dot-F&#39;s. What I w=\r\nould like instead is to\nhave the report look something like this:\n\ntest-01-=\r\n01: success\ntest-01-02: failure\ntest-02-01: success\n\n&lt;errors&gt;\n\n&lt;summary&gt;\n\n\n=\r\nI have looked at the JavaDoc for junit.textui.TestRunner and there is\nno wa=\r\ny to specify how the final report comes out, more specifically no\nway to te=\r\nll it to print the name of the test case and the result\nrather than either =\r\n&quot;.&quot; for success or &quot;.F&quot; for failures.\n\nCan anyone advise me how I can modif=\r\ny this behavior? Am I stuck and\njust need to write a parser to convert the =\r\n&quot;..F.&quot; to a meaningful\nreport as to which tests succeeded or failed (as in =\r\nthe above example)?\n\nThanks in advance for any suggestions.\n\n\n--James\n\n\n\n\n\n=\r\n\n\n\n",
