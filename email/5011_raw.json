On their second \nassignment, I had them write tests for the class they \nimplemented in their first assignment. (Yes, I know, that&#39;s not \ntest first...)  On the second assigment, I ran their unit tests \nagainst my implementation of the first assignment&#39;s class.  I \nused the text user interface as this made batching up the tests \neasier.  However, on inspection of the student&#39;s code, I had \nseveral students whose tests passed, but they didn&#39;t actually call \nassert*() or fail().  For example:\n\npublic class MP0Test extends TestCase {\n  ...\n  public void testGetValue() {\n      MP0class mp0 = readConfig();\n       mp0.getValue() == 42;\n  }\n}\n\nDoes anyone think JUnit should give  some kind of warning \nwhen no assert* or fail is called in a test* method?\n\nJoel Jones\njones@...\n\n\n\n",
