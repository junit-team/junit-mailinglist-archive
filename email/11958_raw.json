So i was not sure\nif we could handle pop up windows and page refreshed. I would really\nappreciate if you could let me know how its done. And thanks for your\nquick response.\n\nAs the author of HttpUnit, I can assure you that such functionality is\nmost definitely built in. (I cannot believe that I forgot to include\nthis in the FAQ). Now there are a number of different types of\n&quot;pop-up&quot; windows. New windows launched by settting targets to _blank\nor an unknown frame name are created as new instances of WebWindow.\nYou can check for their creation by setting a WebWindowListener.\n\nThe other types are triggered by JavaScript. Alert dialog require no\nuser interaction (other than to dismiss them) and their content can be\nread by the WebClient: popNextAlert and getNextAlert methods.\nJavaScript dialogs can be checked and answered by adding a\nDialogResponder.\n\nExamples of all of these are found in the regression tests included in\nthe archive. I will make sure to add them to the FAQ.\n\nYahoo! Groups SponsorADVERTISEMENT\n\n\n---------------------------------\nYahoo!
