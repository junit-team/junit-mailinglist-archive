It was difficult to explain and it made writing test\nrunners more difficult. One particularly vexing problem was re-running\nsingle tests while making sure all the TestDecorators and TestSuite\nsubclasses higher in the test tree were run correctly. Instead, the JUnit 4\nrunner takes a flat array of test classes. This is easier to explain and\neasier to implement correctly.\n\nNow we are encountering just how heavily used TestDecorator and TestSuite\nsubclassing are used in JUnit extensions. Our challenge is to provide\nequivalently powerful extension mechanisms while retaining the simplicity of\nthe new approach. One such is the @BeforeClass/@AfterClass annotations. If\nwe can&#39;t provide enough extensibility with two-level suite specifications,\nwe will go back to recursive test suites. In the meantime, our new runner\nshould run pre-JUnit 4-style tests correctly.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nKent Beck\nThree Rivers Institute\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On \n&gt; Behalf Of Chris Dollin\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, June 21, 2005 2:38 AM\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: Re: [junit] JUnit 4\n&gt; \n&gt; On Tuesday 21 June 2005 10:16, Kent Beck wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Jason,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I see what you mean.

Because it sounds so completely insane\n&gt; I&#39;m sure I&#39;m missing something - maybe terminology, maybe a missing\n&gt; concept, maybe a new formulation for what composition of tests gives\n&gt; you. Maybe some persistent bad habit I&#39;ve acquired is blocking me.\n&gt; \n&gt; No hurry. By the time I can use J4 I&#39;m sure all will be made clear.\n\n\n\n",
