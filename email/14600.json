If you made the <br/>\nclasses the that implemented the interfaces non-public, and provided <br/>\naccess to them through some sort of factory, it might work.  It&#39;s more <br/>\ncomplex but doable. You need to be careful not to expose the <br/>\nimplementation classes or people will use them in preference to the <br/>\ninterfaces, either deliberately or out of carelessness. If they write <br/>\ntheir own implementations then you&#39;re virtually guaranteed they&#39;ll code <br/>\nto the class rather than the interface. I see this all the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe real problem though is that Java is not designed to work this way. <br/>\nInterfaces are not meant to replace classes. In particular, the lack of <br/>\nmethod preconditions and postconditions means that you can no longer <br/>\nmake any promises about what a given method accepts or returns beyond <br/>\nthe simple return type. The reason we have access protection as a <br/>\nlanguage feature is because we cannot rely on programmer convention to <br/>\nenforce rules. Using interfaces instead of classes reduces us to using <br/>\nprogrammer convention to enforce constraints that should be enforced in <br/>\ncode. There are languages where preconditions and postconditions are <br/>\npart of the method signature, and in these languages, using interfaces <br/>\ninstead of classes is feasible. However, Java is not such a language. :-(<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n﻿Elliotte Rusty Harold  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:elharo@...\">elharo@...</a><br/>\nXML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/\">http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim\">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim</a></div>",
