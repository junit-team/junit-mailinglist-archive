If deprecation is too agressive,<br/>\none may as well not bother at all.  I wouldn&#39;t expect deprecated stuff<br/>\nto be deleted in a minor update, ie between 3.3 and 3.3.1.  I assume<br/>\nsomething in 3.2 would be deprecated in 3.3, and deleted in 3.4.<br/>\nOr maybe even later, if the 3.3 release isn&#39;t widely announced or if 3.4<br/>\nfollows it too quickly.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, if I download 3.3.0 first, it will provide warnings when I run tests<br/>\nwith it?  Or will I have to study the docs and track down deprecated usages<br/>\nmanually?  <br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJoi Ellis                    Software Engineer<br/>\nAravox Technologies          <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:joi@...\">joi@...</a>, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:gyles19@...\">gyles19@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\nNo matter what we think of Linux versus FreeBSD, etc., the one thing I<br/>\nreally like about Linux is that it has Microsoft worried.
