The test class is created before rules are\n&gt; applied, so if your t=\r\nest class initializes fields at declaration\n&gt; time, that execution would ha=\r\nppen in a different thread than the\n&gt; test.\n&gt; \n&gt; I also believe that @After=\r\n methods would not be called for tests\n&gt; methods that timeout in classes th=\r\nat use the Timeout rule.\n\n@Kevin: I feel like a fool.  I actually &quot;discover=\r\ned&quot; rules during this exercise and spent some time changing legacy @Test(ti=\r\nmeout =3D ...) tests to use a fixture-level Timeout @Rule.  However, I just=\r\n assumed that the threading behavior between the two was the same. :(  Base=\r\nd on your information, I ran some more tests to nail down on which thread t=\r\nhe various parts of the fixture are executed using both models.  The result=\r\ns are summarized below (from JUnit 4.8.2).\n\n    @Test with timeout element:=\r\n\n        A1. ctor run on main thread\n        A2. @BeforeClass, @Before, @Af=\r\nter, @AfterClass run on main thread\n        A3. @Test run on worker thread\n=\r\n        A4. @After, @AfterClass run on main thread if test times out\n\n    T=\r\nimeout @Rule:\n        B1. ctor run on main thread\n        B2. @BeforeClass,=\r\n @AfterClass run on main thread\n        B3. @Before, @Test, @After run on w=\r\norker thread\n        B4. @After NOT run if test times out\n        B5. @Afte=\r\nrClass run on main thread if test times out\n\nGiven these results, using Tim=\r\neout @Rules satisfies my concerns about thread safety and gives me even mor=\r\ne motivation to use them over @Test(timeout =3D ...).  Thanks!  (Note sure =\r\nif item [B4] is intentional, but I can live with it for now.)\n\n\n--- In juni=\r\nt@yahoogroups.com, David Saff &lt;saff@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; The biggest payoff would =\r\nprobably be to make sure that the\n&gt; documentation we have makes it easy to =\r\navoid any unexpected\n&gt; behavior.  Can you suggest an edit to that effect?\n\n=\r\n@David: Your suggestion for updating the documentation is probably the best=\r\n solution based on the preferred behavior of the Timeout @Rule.  Below is m=\r\ny cut at a second paragraph I&#39;d add to the Javadocs for the @Test annotatio=\r\nn&#39;s timeout element.  Please edit as you see fit.\n\n    THREAD SAFETY WARNIN=\r\nG.  Test methods with a timeout parameter are run in a thread other than th=\r\ne thread which runs the fixture&#39;s @Before and @After methods.  This may yie=\r\nld different behavior for code that is not thread safe when compared to the=\r\n same test method without a timeout parameter.  Consider using the org.juni=\r\nt.rules.Timeout rule instead, which ensures a test method is run on the sam=\r\ne thread as the fixture&#39;s @Before and @After methods.\n\nThanks again for all=\r\n the feedback,\nSteve\n\n\n\n",
