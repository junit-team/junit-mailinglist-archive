It pains me to see Java held up as an example of<br/>\na great OO language, without any acknowledgement of Smalltalk. For the<br/>\nlast three years, I&#39;ve spent approximately 50% of each day using Java<br/>\nand 50% using Smalltalk and I&#39;m much more productive when using<br/>\nSmalltalk. That said, it would be nice if Smalltalk supported<br/>\nInterfaces, which I find extremely useful but is not yet supported in<br/>\nSmalltalk, to my knowledge.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can also download a free, noncommercial version of VisualWorks,<br/>\nwhich is an industrial-strength version of Smalltalk that&#39;s been proven<br/>\nin a number of industries (financial, industrial, shipping, etc.) for<br/>\nyears at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cincom.com/scripts/smalltalk.dll//downloads/index.ssp\">http://www.cincom.com/scripts/smalltalk.dll//downloads/index.ssp</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Jason Rogers [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jacaetevha@...\">jacaetevha@...</a>] <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;disclaimer&gt;<br/>\n&gt; \tWhat follows is a shameless plug for a real Object-Oriented<br/>\n&gt; \tlanguage, one that is much better than the knock-off Java<br/>\n&gt; \tthat many of us are forced to program in on a regular <br/>\n&gt; basis. &lt;/disclaimer&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If you are *really* interested in a language that will help <br/>\n&gt; you to understand Objects better than any language out there, <br/>\n&gt; Smalltalk is the way to go.  That being said the flavor of <br/>\n&gt; the day is definitely Squeak, an open source implementation <br/>\n&gt; of the Smalltalk-80 system (www.squeak.org<br/>\n&gt; -- a minimal front-end to the community).  As far as IDEs go, <br/>\n&gt; Smalltalk was and continues to be the leader for many <br/>\n&gt; reasons, but since this isn&#39;t a Smalltalk list, I will leave <br/>\n&gt; it there to whet your appetite.  By the way, in case you <br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t know, JUnit is the Java equivalent of the original <br/>\n&gt; XUnit testing framework by Kent Beck called SUnit (Smalltalk <br/>\n&gt; Unit), and Squeak is fully up-to-date with the latest and <br/>\n&gt; greatest on that front as well.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; =jason<br/>\n&gt; [:question | ^One] <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Adelbert Groebbens [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:adelbert.groebbens@...\">adelbert.groebbens@...</a>] <br/>\n&gt; Sent: Monday, December 16, 2002 5:10 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: [junit] OT: OO Newcomer<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Here is a list of books and resources I&#39;ve found very <br/>\n&gt; inspirational (the numbers indicate an ordening in terms of phases).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Java seems to me one of the most suitable languages for <br/>\n&gt; concentrating on learning OO. </span></blockquote></div>",
