And in my \n&gt;&gt;experience you *can* learn to write code in a way that you \n&gt;&gt;very seldom need to fall back on this crutch.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Just my two cents, Ilja\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I agree that you should strive to write code that does not need\n&gt; comments, however some times it is unavoidable. One prime example is\n&gt; where you are driven to make a design decision that runs counter to\n&gt; &#39;common sense&#39; and must indicate why in order to keep people from\n&gt; wrongly rewriting the code in the future. This often happens when trying\n&gt; to accommodate a framework or hardware that doesn&#39;t quite work as\n&gt; advertised.\n\nAbsolutely agreed. As I wrote earlier in this thread, comments that say \n&quot;I had to do this silly thing, because...&quot; actually *communicate*, \nwhereas 90% of comments I see communicate nothing that the code cannot \nitself more effectively communicate.\n\nI hope this is clearer.\n-- \nJ.
