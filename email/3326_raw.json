There are two ways I have been tried:\n\n1. Create my own main method.  In the main method, take the parameter \nfrom command line and set the state of the test suite, then pass the \ntest suite to the JUnit test runners.  When the runners call the test \nsuite to construct the tests, it will construct different tests \naccording to the state.\n\n2. Set the envrionment variable through the -D switch of java executable \nand check those variable using System.getProperty in the suite mehtod of \nthe test suite.\n\nShane\n\n-- \nDisclaimer:  I join all the news groups out of my own interest.

These TestAll \n&gt;classes can compose all test in subpackages.\n&gt;But I am confused about naming convention for these classes. For root \n&gt;Test class it&#39;s simple, name can be AllTest or TestAll, but what \n&gt;names can I assign to other? I looked for some convention, but there \n&gt;are only convention for packages or method naming, not for this \n&gt;problem. Have somebody some experience with this?\n&gt;\n&gt;Example package structure (each level with few Test classes):\n&gt;A\n&gt;A.a\n&gt;A.a.1.xxx\n&gt;A.a.2.yyy\n&gt;A.b\n&gt;A.b.1.xxx\n&gt;A.b.2.xxx\n&gt;\n&gt;If I name all test classes composing some other test as &quot;TestAll&quot;, \n&gt;there can be confusion later (many classes with name &quot;TestAll&quot;), if I \n&gt;name it &quot;TestAllXXX&quot;, where XXX is name of last level of package, \n&gt;there can be still packages with same name of the last level. \n&gt;Assigning name as TestAll_A_a_1 (thus full name of package in name of \n&gt;class) is for me too long. Some advice?\n&gt;\n&gt;Thanx\n&gt;\n&gt;Zdenek Smid\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt;junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;Your use of Yahoo!
