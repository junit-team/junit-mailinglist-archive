This assumes that those values are available through <br/>\nthe public interface, of course.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Also, with equals() method I <br/>\n&gt; cannot know which data member in the class actually caused a mis-<br/>\n&gt; match, since I assert only at the class level.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is why you implement toString() to show the value of the object, so that <br/>\nyou can see which fields are different.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; This is why I am thinking what to do... hope this clarifies the <br/>\n&gt; problem. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It sounds like you&#39;re simply trying to test something that&#39;s big (not <br/>\nnecessarily difficult) and time-consuming. If you want to test the whole thing, <br/>\nthen nothing you try will be simpler than implementing equals() and following <br/>\nour suggestions. If you don&#39;t mind testing less than the whole thing, then you <br/>\ncan check individual fields that you read from XML against known values.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, if you have the power to do so, simplify the object model!<br/>\n<br/>\nJ.
