I would <br/>\nlike to test it using Junit. However, this requires me to write a <br/>\ntest case which is distributed among many processes which act as <br/>\nclient/servers.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve looked into jakarta&#39;s cactus, and Junit EE but I understand they <br/>\nwould support only distributed applications based on standard <br/>\ncommunication protocols (namely HTTP and an EJB contained)<br/>\n<br/>\nIs there an extension to Junit that would support testing of non-<br/>\nstandard distributed applications?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve started designing an RMI-based version of the junit interfaces <br/>\nwhere a testcase could spawn one or more &quot;distributed test cases&quot; <br/>\nrunning on remote hosts and that would report their status through <br/>\nthe originating test&#39;s TestListener. I&#39;m basically remotizing the <br/>\njunit interfaces.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wonder if such extension would already exist and if I could reuse <br/>\nit rather than redoing this from scratch. <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your help,<br/>\n<br/>\nGuillaume.</div>",
