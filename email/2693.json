My immediate need is to report <br/>\nperformance information: time of execution.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that this information is of general importance.  I was <br/>\nconvinced after hearing anecdote Cem Kaner told about some tests that <br/>\nare run at Oracle.  The essential idea is any dramatic change in <br/>\nperformance (faster or slower) behaviour warrants investigation, even <br/>\nif [especially if] other test assertions fail to locate a specific <br/>\nproblem.<br/>\n<br/>\nI did some poking around on the web.  The google search &quot;junit <br/>\nperformance testresult&quot; uncovered a couple references on netbeans.org. <br/>\n Otherwise, nothing exciting.<br/>\n<br/>\nI could also use a couple good references to successful attempts at <br/>\nextending TestResult.  I only need some hints about passing the <br/>\ninformation around.  I will of course tailor the contents to suit the <br/>\ntask I have in mind.</div>",
