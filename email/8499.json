Having quite figured it out on the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;assertEquals, but on the assertTrue I us something like this this:<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;assertTrue(!image.isChild());<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;Robert DiFalco &lt;rdifalco@t...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;Yeah, it is a little odd. We have an AbstractTestCase and we just added<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;the two version of #assertNotEquals there. We also added an<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;#assertEqualsSameHash which makes sure that if two objects are equal,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;that their hashes are also equal.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; Hmm... maybe you wanted something like GSBase&#39;s EqualsTester,<br/>\n&gt;instead. Tests that use assertEquals() must assume that equals()<br/>\n&gt;works. If you want to test equals(), that ought to be done separately.<br/>\n&gt;You have some subtle test coupling there that could lead you to forget<br/>\n&gt;that equals()/hashCode() *may not* work.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; Take care.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; J.

Let me make that clear.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was responding to Robert&#39;s mention of adding assertEqualsSameHash() &quot;which makes sure that if two objects are equal, then their hashes are also equal.&quot; My comment was specifically about this statement. I ought to have removed more of the surrounding context to make that more clear. If Robert is using assertEqualsSameHash() in the context of testing the equals() method, that&#39;s perfect; but if he&#39;s using it in other tests and relying on its failure to signal a problem with equals()/hashCode(), then he is coupling his tests in a manner that, I strongly suspect, will bite him in the ass in due time. It did for me.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;snip /&gt;<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;And while I could go out and get third party extensions, I prefer to<br/>\n&gt;stick with the published regular distribution, warts and all.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I find this attitude curious. If JUnit doesn&#39;t do what you need, then use something else! If you can&#39;t change JUnit, and it doesn&#39;t change quickly enough for you, then add onto it. That&#39;s what GSBase, JUnit-addons and all other projects are there for.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I had always assumed that the JUnit developers had some strong reason<br/>\n&gt;for overlooking such an obvious thing.  But maybe not.  If not, please<br/>\n&gt;consider adding assertNotEquals for the next release.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m sure it&#39;s on the list, but if not, go to the Sourceforge project page and make your feelings known. JUnit is slow to change. You generally get more out of JUnit by using the extensions than by waiting for JUnit to change.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJ. B.
