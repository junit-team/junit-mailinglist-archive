I went through several stage of solution.\n\n1. Modify the JUnit&#39;s all three test runner to init log4j and distribute \n  a internal version of JUnit.\n\n2. Extending all three JUnit runner. Seems to be a lot of work for a \nsimple job.\n\n3. Currently, we are using AspectJ and keep the code of JUnit intact. \nThe attached is a patched to JUnit 3.7.\n\nIt includes two new file:\n\ni. A build.xml\nii. A log4j aspect\n\nTo build it, you need aspect 0.8b3 from www.aspectj.org and log4j jar \nfiles under lib dir.\n\nDavid Li\nDigitalSesame\n\n\nchw@... wrote:\n\n&gt; Folks:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; We are just starting to use JUnit to support our development.  We have \n&gt; a substantial collection of Log4j code in our system.  When we run a \n&gt; JUnit test, the Log4j code complains that the system is not \n&gt; initialized properly. \n&gt; \n&gt; We have put initialization in the main program of our test case, but \n&gt; that does not seem to work.  We have moved the initialization code \n&gt; into the setUp() function.  When run, the class loader complains about \n&gt; this location. (We used the Java Swing runner)\n&gt; \n&gt; Do I need to create a specialized TestRunner or is there a hook to get \n&gt; log4j working under JUnit?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; \n&gt; Charlie\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
