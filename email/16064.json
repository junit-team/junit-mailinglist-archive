It seems there are two<br/>\n&gt; cases:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 1) I am throwing an exception but I want to make it more specific so I throw<br/>\n&gt; a subclass (Exception -&gt; IllegalArgumentException). No catch clauses care<br/>\n&gt; about the more-specific exception. If expected is looking for a precise<br/>\n&gt; class, a bunch of tests will break even though the code still works.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 2) The scenario you introduced--there are catch clauses in place that are<br/>\n&gt; looking for the more-specific exception. If expected is looking for any<br/>\n&gt; subclass of an exception class, the code might not work any more but the<br/>\n&gt; tests would pass.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Either way you&#39;re going to get false results. One question is which scenario<br/>\n&gt; is more common? Another is which scenario is more dangerous/risky/expensive?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not Ben, but I&#39;d like to add that whenever there are multiple <br/>\nexception handlers and the correspond caught exceptions are in one <br/>\nanother&#39;s inheritance hierarchy, checking only the exception type caught <br/>\nis not necessarily a good idea in general. At that point, I strongly <br/>\nrecommend checking the exception instance. It avoids this entire <br/>\nproblem, in addition to being a stronger change detector.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
