This is a JUnit extension\nthat sets up your database in a known state before\nexecuting your tests. This framework uses xml datasets\n(collection of data tables) and performs database\noperations before and after each test. The dbUnit\nframework supports both the &quot;clean insert&quot; and the\n&quot;refresh&quot; strategies. \n\nWhy?\nI was responsible to define the unit testing strategy\nfor a new J2EE project involving databases. I found\nthat Cactus was a great JUnit extension to test EJB\ncomponents and JSP/servlets but, even with a lot of\nresearch, I haven&#39;t found any products to set up our\ndatabase in a consistent state before each test. I\nalso discovered Richard Dallaway website\n(http://www.dallaway.com/acad/dbunit.html), which I\nfound a very valuable resource. This enlightens me\nabout the various testing strategies for database\ndevelopment (many of them coming from the JUnit\nmailing list). But at my knowledge, nothing exists yet\nthat facilitates their application. At the end, I\ndecided to do it myself and I created dbUnit! \n\nFor more information about dbUnit and to download it,\ngo at http://dbunit.sourceforge.net\n\nAny feedback you may have is welcome and much\nappreciated. I hope you will find dbUnit a valuable\naddition for the community.\n\nManuel Laflamme, Software Architect\nFreeborders Canada\nmanuel.laflamme@... \n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
