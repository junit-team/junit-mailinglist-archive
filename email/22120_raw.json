It may often be more practical to tag tests =\r\nfor exclusion, based on execution time or external resource constraints tha=\r\nn to tag fast tests.\n\nI found it easier to use assumptions to exclude such =\r\ntests, because I can state the assumption in a setup class that sets up the=\r\n intensive resource and have the unit test automatically excluded just for =\r\nwriting it, but I can definitely see categories being a good exclusion mech=\r\nanism.\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Pigneri, Rocco&quot; &lt;rpigneri@...&gt; wrote=\r\n:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; But group exclusion has other uses, such as &quot;running all the tests=\r\n except\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the slow ones&quot;, &quot;excluding the ui tests&quot;, &quot;excluding the Linux=\r\n tests&quot;,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; etc...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;snip&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Got it. So we seem in agreement =\r\nthat excluded categories may be\n&gt; &gt;useful, but a &quot;broken&quot; category is not t=\r\nhe best argument for them.\n&gt; \n&gt; I also agree.  I almost exclusively use cat=\r\negories to exclude certain types of tests, such as database tests, slow tes=\r\nts, integration tests, etc. from my main test run.  In fact, for me, puttin=\r\ng tests into a category is an exception rather than a rule: in other words,=\r\n I only mark tests that I would *not* want to execute on each run of the te=\r\nst suite.  All other tests get run on every run, each time.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hope that =\r\nhelps,\n&gt; \n&gt; Rocco\n&gt; \n&gt; From: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroup=\r\ns.com] On Behalf Of David Saff\n&gt; Sent: Sunday, November 22, 2009 10:53 PM\n&gt;=\r\n To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: Re: [junit] Re: Categories in JUnit 4=\r\n.8\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; 2009/11/22 C=C3=A9dric Beust =E2=99&quot; &lt;cbeust@...&lt;mailto:cbeus=\r\nt%40google.com&gt;&gt;:\n&gt; &gt; On Sun, Nov 22, 2009 at 7:36 PM, David Saff &lt;david@..=\r\n.&lt;mailto:david%40saff.net&gt;&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; The problem with @Ignore=\r\n is that 1) you need to specify it on all the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; methods you want to ex=\r\nclude and 2) it forces a recompilation.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Being able to specify=\r\n &quot;-ignore broken&quot; at runtime allows you to exclude\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; dozens of methods=\r\n in one single command.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; This story makes sense to me if you have =\r\nmany tests in the broken\n&gt; &gt;&gt; group, and sometimes want to run all of them,=\r\n and sometimes want to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; run none of them. Is that your frequent experie=\r\nnce? If so, I agree\n&gt; &gt;&gt; that excludable categories would be the way to do =\r\nit.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; No, I never really run all the methods in the excluded gro=\r\nups, most of the\n&gt; &gt; time, their purpose is just to be excluded.  When I wa=\r\nnt to start fixing the\n&gt; &gt; broken tests, I look at all the tests in that gr=\r\noup and I take them out of\n&gt; &gt; it one by one as I fix them.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; But gro=\r\nup exclusion has other uses, such as &quot;running all the tests except\n&gt; &gt; the =\r\nslow ones&quot;, &quot;excluding the ui tests&quot;, &quot;excluding the Linux tests&quot;,\n&gt; &gt; etc.=\r\n..\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Admittedly, this is more on the integration/functional than on t=\r\nhe unit test\n&gt; &gt; side, so you might consider these out of scope for JUnit.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; Got it. So we seem in agreement that excluded categories may be\n&gt; usef=\r\nul, but a &quot;broken&quot; category is not the best argument for them.\n&gt; \n&gt; David S=\r\naff\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; In my frequent experience, I tend to never run all the =\r\ntests in the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;broken&quot; set: I enable them one by one, and fix them, whe=\r\nn I can, so\n&gt; &gt;&gt; @Ignore works fine for me.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; That&#39;s also my exp=\r\nerience for the Broken category.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --\n&gt; &gt; ***C=C3=A9dric\n&gt; &gt; *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n ------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
