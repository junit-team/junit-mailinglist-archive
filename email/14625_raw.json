One option\n&gt; &gt; is to just run the coverage tool from the command line or ant, but I&#39;d\n&gt; &gt; really like something more integrated, e.g.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; The only other option I know is Cobertura. There&#39;s no official plugin, \n&gt; but the build file can make one. Whether it works or not, I don&#39;t know. \n&gt; It could probably be made to work with a little hacking.\n&gt; \n&gt; http://cobertura.sourceforge.net/\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; Elliotte Rusty Harold elharo@...\n&gt; XML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!\n&gt; http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/\n&gt; http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim\n&gt;  \n&gt; \nPlaying devil&#39;s advocate to some extent here, I&#39;m surprised at this. I read \nyour developerworks article about cobertura, but you&#39;ve made some reasonably \ndogmatic statements on this list about deleting any code that doesn&#39;t have a \ntest (which I personally have found have made me a lot more positive in \novercoming my FearOfDeletingCode (need to add a c2 wiki entry about that) \n(too many nested parentheses in that sentence - must stop posting after \ndrinking champagne) .
