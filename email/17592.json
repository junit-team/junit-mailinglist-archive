In my 7+ years of unit testing, test-first, and<br/>\n&gt; TDD I have never developed a system in which I would be confident saying I<br/>\n&gt; had 100% test coverage.  Maybe I am too much of a skeptic.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Nope. You sound realistic to me. I argue on the side of 100% unit test<br/>\ncoverage, but while that is my target, I realise that real life will<br/>\nmost likely interfere and I will get less than that.
