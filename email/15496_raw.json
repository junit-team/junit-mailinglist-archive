You both completely understood my \nsituation.\n\nYes, I am a top-down design sorta guy. Especially as in most projects I \nwork on there is very little upfront technical design (no UML, \nRequirements specs, etc). Thats why i liked TDD, I could start from the \n&#39;front-end&#39; and the design just fell out natuarlly because I was always \nthinking about the use of the code.\n\nJB calls it &quot;Story Test-Driven Development&quot;. Apart from the obvious Kent \nBeck/XP books is their any more info on this?\n\nThanks again,\n\nRakesh\n\nJ. B.

I decided to try unit testing.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;So, I started with an obvious class and started to build the methods i\n&gt;&gt;thought it needed and the accompanying test class with methods that\n&gt;&gt;tested the respective methods of the class under test. As the code base\n&gt;&gt;grew I found refactoring quite a burden. Perhaps I had my intial design\n&gt;&gt;incorrect.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Then i decided to try TDD. Wow! Suddenly i was writing code to satisfy\n&gt;&gt;my tests (a client) and things seemed a lot more natural. Productivity\n&gt;&gt;increased and i built only what i needed. I think this is how\n&gt;&gt;development should happen (I have since hit a wall with testing\n&gt;&gt;non-POJOs that I am still grappling with).\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;However, the tests that result from TDD are NOT unti tests. They are\n&gt;&gt;actually quite high-level. I found dropping out of TDD into unit testing\n&gt;&gt;quite hard and unnatural. Even though the resulting tests are important\n&gt;&gt;to have, i couldn&#39;t help feeling that by not writing the lower-level\n&gt;&gt;unit tests (against say a private method) I was not doing the right thing.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Does anyone understand what I mean? Have i misunderstood unit testing\n&gt;&gt;and TDD?\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;It sounds like your TDD tests were more of &quot;integration tests&quot; than of \n&gt;&quot;unit tests&quot;. I&#39;ll guess that you like to take a top-down approach to \n&gt;design. If you do, then take care to examine how many different objects \n&gt;participate in a test. If it&#39;s more than one, then you should consider \n&gt;what behavior you need from each object, then test-driving (performing \n&gt;TDD on) each object in isolation. When you think you&#39;ve built the \n&gt;behavior you need from each object, you can put them together to pass \n&gt;the original integration test you wrote.\n&gt;\n&gt;This is very close to Story Test-Driven Development, so you haven&#39;t \n&gt;misunderstood TDD, but rather have noticed that one can practise TDD at \n&gt;different levels of the design.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n",
