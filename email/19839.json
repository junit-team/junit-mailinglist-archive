Which one is the next one? TestNG?<br/>\n&gt; This custom runner stuff is cool! Keep up the good work!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On 9/9/07, David Saff &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:saff@...\">saff@...</a> &lt;saff%40mit.edu&gt;&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Joakim,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I think it&#39;s really interesting stuff.

I believe that mixing languages<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; rather than switching completely from one language to another is going<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to be more and more important. As I explored the subject i found<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; myself lacking some tools. I was frustrated by the fact that I had to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; maintain two sets of tests and look for feedback in two different<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; locations while developing.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I created a custom runner for JUnit to address the subject and I think<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; it looks promising. I created a blog entry with some more details in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; case anyone is interested:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://johlrogge.wordpress.com/2007/09/08/hybrid-theory/\">http://johlrogge.wordpress.com/2007/09/08/hybrid-theory/</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I have some loose plans on open-sourcing this but I would like to see<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; if there are others than me that find this interesting enough to be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; worth the effort before I do.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; /Joakim Ohlrogge<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yahoo!
