I was using a home-grown one with<br/>\na previous employer, but that isn&#39;t (yet - I&#39;m hopeful!) open-sourced<br/>\n/ externally available, so I need to make a jump to another one.<br/>\n<br/>\nI tried EasyMock (1.x) after reading JB&#39;s book a couple of years back<br/>\n- I think the state of the art has moved on somewhat since then.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe closed framework that I used previously seems pretty similar in<br/>\nterms of look and feel to rMock 2.0 and JMock 2.0, but I&#39;m open to<br/>\nother suggestions.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat experiences to people have to share?<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\n<br/>\nJames</div>",
