And, by<br/>\npracticed I mean, SERIOUSLY practiced.  I talk with a lot of groups who<br/>\nsay they *do* unit testing but have just a handful of test, rarely run,<br/>\nand no consistency, idea of code coverage, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nI gave talks on JUnit and the developer testing revolution at two<br/>\nJavaOne conferences (2004 and 2006) where I talked about the three<br/>\npossible outcomes for the future of developer/unit testing:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLong-Term Defeat:  Theidea of developer testing was a noble, notable,<br/>\nbut ultimately short-lived blipin the history of software development.<br/>\nAlmost all developers went back to the old way of thinking: testing<br/>\nisfor QA.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMinor Victory: Developer testing does not disappear, but it remains a<br/>\nnicheactivity.  Practiced only by a devoutminority of test-infected<br/>\ndevelopers.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMajor Victory: Developer testing becomes a standardsoftware development<br/>\npractice.  The rule,instead of the exception.  Releasingsoftware without<br/>\nunit/developer testing is as unthinkable as releasing softwarewithout<br/>\nQA.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am rooting, of course, for the major victory, but I am starting to<br/>\nhave my doubts, and wondering why progress is so slow.  Below is my<br/>\nanalysis of what I believe is happening and I&#39;d be very interested in<br/>\nyour opinion.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the past few years, I&#39;ve noticed that some developers are easily<br/>\n&quot;test-infected&quot;, others require longer exposure and some encouragement<br/>\nbut eventually &quot;get it&quot; , and one group seems to have a built-in<br/>\nimmunity.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s as if there are 3 basic types of test genes:<br/>\n<br/>\nT1 - Very susceptpible to test infection.  Show them a single JUnit<br/>\nexample and they get it immediately - and start using it regularly and<br/>\nwith great fervor.  When time pressure hits, they fight hard for enough<br/>\ntime to test and would rather quit than produce code without tests. <br/>\nThey often have framed pictures of Kent Beck on their desk :-).<br/>\n<br/>\nT2 - Somewhat susceptible to test infection.  Show them how to use<br/>\nJUnit/TDD, give them some encouragement and time to appreciate the<br/>\nbenefits and rewards; eventually they will become regular users.  When<br/>\ntime pressure hits, however, they often revert to no-test mode without<br/>\ntoo much kicking and screaming.<br/>\n<br/>\nT3 -  Immune to test infection. There&#39;s no amount of showing and<br/>\nconvincing that will get them to practice developer testing on their own<br/>\nwith any regularity - if at all.  Many of them would rather quit than<br/>\nhave to write tests on a regular basis.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would love to be able to say that these genes are somewhat evenly<br/>\ndistributed.  A rough Gaussian distribution.  Something like this:<br/>\n<br/>\nT1: 30%<br/>\nT2: 40%<br/>\nT3: 30%<br/>\n<br/>\nBut my experience is that developers with the T3 gene outnumber the<br/>\ncombined number of those with T2 and T1 gene.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis spells trouble because I have also found that when developers<br/>\nbecome managers they bring with them their attitudes toward developer<br/>\ntesting.  And a T3 manager is not going to provide an environment where<br/>\nthe T2 (the ones that require some time and encouragement) can become<br/>\ntest infected.   And this might explain why developer testing is still<br/>\npracticed by a minority of developers in a minority of organizations.<br/>\n<br/>\nFeedback?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlberto<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.junitfactory.com\">http://www.junitfactory.com</a><br/>\nGenerate JUnit tests.
