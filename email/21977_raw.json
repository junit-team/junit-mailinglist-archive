I might, for example, want to have the errorCode not as a an int, =\r\nbut as a String, or as an enumeration item. I might also have multiple erro=\r\nr codes, a major one and a minor one, and so on. \n&gt; \n&gt; Therefore it is very=\r\n unlikely that this change will get to the sources.\n&gt; \n&gt; There is a mail se=\r\nnt by David Saff on 20th of Oct, regarding the feature prioritization on JU=\r\nnit. You can read there what is the process of placing your request on the =\r\nlist of ToDos for JUnit.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Bogdan\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In junit@yahoogrou=\r\nps.com, &quot;remoliechti&quot; &lt;remo.liechti@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi guys,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; JUni=\r\nt4 comes with a nice annotation that supports checking for a special except=\r\nion:\n&gt; &gt; @Test(expected=3DMyException.class)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Well, the exception c=\r\nontains an error code which should be checked as well, so I thought, why no=\r\nt enhancing JUnit to check this as well:\n&gt; &gt; @Test(expected=3DMyException.c=\r\nlass,errorCode=3D5)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; So I downloaded the JUnit sources and customiz=\r\ned the org.junit.Test annotation, as well as org.junit.internal.runners.Met=\r\nhodRoodie and org.junit.internal.runners.TestMethod to fit my needs.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Within eclipse, my new annotation is recognized by the code completion t=\r\nool, but when running the tests it still uses the shipped junit version.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; How can I exchange the junit jar file used by eclipse? Just replacing the=\r\n jar within the junit plugins folder will crash eclipse since it recognizes=\r\n the change...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Any ideas?\n&gt; &gt; Maybe this enhancement could be fed =\r\nback to the junit sources?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thanks,\n&gt; &gt; Remo\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n",
