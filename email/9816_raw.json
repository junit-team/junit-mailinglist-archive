And every such \n\nHere you say a fixture is an &#39;object&#39;\n\n&gt; object instantiated from the same class embodies that fixture. As \na \n&gt; result, the class itself, being a blueprint for those objects, \nembodies \n&gt; that fixture. Therefore, the test case class and the fixture are \n&gt; conceptually the same. The test case class is merely an expression \nof \n&gt; the fixture.\n\nHere you seem to say that the fixture is a class.  \nassertEquals(class,object);\n\nwill that fail?\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Was it really necessary to write all that? I am not J J Sylvester. \nI \n&gt; have no interest in proving everything I know to you from first \nprinciples.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; My apologies to the wider world for starting this absurd thread; \nI was\n&gt; &gt; just trying to be helpful to the enquirer.\n&gt; \n&gt; No, you weren&#39;t. Now that you have established a pattern, I feel I \nhave \n&gt; solid ground on which to say this. You were being antagonistic, as \nyou \n&gt; have often been, by pretending not only to know it all, but that \n&gt; everyone else is therefore incorrect. As I am often accused of \n&gt; pretending to know it all -- and sometimes guilty of it -- I \nsurely know \n&gt; the signs.\n\nI am a newbie to this discussion group (obviously) and am just \nlearning Java and JUnit.. and I can tell you that what Jim is saying \nis what is being taught at University level now.  Before you \nclick &#39;reply&#39; let me state that I fully understand that University \nand the &#39;real world&#39; are VERY different worlds.  However in defense \nof Jim, I have several times considered looking for a different \ngroup to follow about JUnit because of you J.B.  You may be King of \nProgrammers but your attitude doesn&#39;t fit well in a discussion \ncommunity.  I am new to Java but not new to the collaborative \ncommunity of news and discussion groups.  Let&#39;s learn from each \nother just as I have learned from all of you guys who know way more \nabout this stuff than I ever will.  But keep in mind, stepping on \nsomeone else never makes you any taller.  \n\nMatt Swaffer\n\n\n\n\n",
