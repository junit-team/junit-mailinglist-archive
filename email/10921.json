You might enter a bug with the Eclipse folks for your esoteric super-secure configuration, and ask for a configuration mechanism to set the IP address for the RemoteTestRunner. But, if you can, just re-enable 127.0.0.1 as the loopback address.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy hypothesis is that the RemoteTestRunner was written to support Eclipse plugin testing, where the test launcher creates a new Eclipse workspace to run a set of plugin tests. The results are displayed in the original workspace&#39;s test runner UI.  That is, the RemoteTestRunner talks over RMI or HTTP to the new launched workspace to get the test results.<br/>\n<br/>\nScott Stirling<br/>\n***********************************************************************<br/>\nThis message is intended only for the use of the intended recipient and<br/>\nmay contain information that is PRIVILEGED and/or CONFIDENTIAL.
