Also I have seen issues with those\nannotations being absent from the compiler&#39;s classpath... IOW the\nannotation does not need to be present when running, but does seem in some\ncases to be required when compiling classes that inherit from annotated\ncode (because the compiler needs to inspect the meta annotations to see in\nthe annotation is inherited or something like that)\n\nMight boil down to either some meta-annotation  or comparing annotations\nbased on simpleName\n\nOn Wednesday, 6 February 2013, Kevin Cooney wrote:\n\n&gt; Hello, everyone\n&gt;\n&gt; Short version: we are thinking of adding an optional dependency from JUnit\n&gt; to jcip-annotations and are soliciting feedback.\n&gt;\n&gt; A few people have noticed that when you use ParallelComputer, you got poor\n&gt; performance because calls to registered RunListeners are synchronized. We\n&gt; would like to fix this in the next release of JUnit.\n&gt;\n&gt; In order to prevent affecting existing users, we are proposing having an\n&gt; annotation that can be added to RunListener implementations that can safely\n&gt; be called concurrently from multiple threads. If a RunListener passed to a\n&gt; RunNotifier is not annotated with this annotation, JUnit will wrap it with\n&gt; a decorator that does synchronization.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; We would appreciate feedback on this new annotation.\n&gt;\n&gt; We have two options:\n&gt;\n&gt; a. Create our own annotation for this\n&gt; b. Use ThreadSafe (\n&gt;\n&gt; http://grepcode.com/file/repo1.maven.org/maven2/net.jcip/jcip-annotations/1.0/net/jcip/annotations/ThreadSafe.java\n&gt; )\n&gt;\n&gt; The advantages to option b are:\n&gt;\n&gt; 1. It&#39;s a well-known annotation\n&gt; 2. Users that use JUnit can add this annotation to their thread-safe\n&gt; RunListener implementations today and get the benefits &quot;for free&quot; later.\n&gt;\n&gt; Note we can do this without requiring that all users of JUnit have the\n&gt; jcip-annotations jar in their classpath as of JDK 1.5.0_06 (see\n&gt;\n&gt; http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3567413/why-doesnt-a-missing-annotation-cause-a-classnotfoundexception-at-runtime\n&gt; ).\n&gt; If jcip-annotations is not on the classpath then all RunListener\n&gt; implementations will be treated as not thread-safe.\n&gt;\n&gt; As a specific example, the Maven Surefire plugin would use this dependency\n&gt; and include jcip-annotations.\n&gt;\n&gt; Currently, JUnit only depends on one third-party library (Hamcrest). This\n&gt; has caused us some pain in the past when the Hamcrest code changed in ways\n&gt; that broke existing users of JUnit. We believe this will not be an issue\n&gt; with jcip-annotations because the JAR only contains annotations, not any\n&gt; code.\n&gt;\n&gt; One possible concern would be with other open source libraries that provide\n&gt; RunListener implementations (they would need to add jcip-annotations to\n&gt; their compile-time classpath if they have thread-safe annotations, and\n&gt; document this to their users).\n&gt;\n&gt; Thoughts?\n&gt;\n&gt; -- Kevin\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
