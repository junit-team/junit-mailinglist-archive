And even though I&#39;ve used JUnit every work day for the past 3\n&gt;  years, I have a new problem I&#39;m not sure how to approach.\n&gt;\n&gt;  I need to write some tests of a Java API that we&#39;re going to deliver to\n&gt;  our customer.  And so my basic plan is to write some JUnit test cases\n&gt;  that will interact with our product through this Java API, just as a\n&gt;  customer would.  But I don&#39;t want to have any of our product source code\n&gt;  checked out to do this.  Instead, I want my JUnit test case&#39;s setUp() to\n&gt;  find the appropriate JAR file on a remote system, fetch it locally, and\n&gt;  then start running tests against it.  That way, whenever the JAR file on\n&gt;  the remote system (our system-under-test) changes, I know I&#39;ll be\n&gt;  testing the latest API code.\n&gt;\n&gt;  I&#39;ve got all the tools at hand to find and fetch the JAR file, but I&#39;m\n&gt;  not sure what my approach should be to load the JAR at runtime AFTER my\n&gt;  test (and thus the JVM it&#39;s running in) has already started.  Any advice\n&gt;  for me?\n\nTo do that implies some sort of classloader shenanigans, which isn&#39;t pretty.\n\nWhat is stopping you from getting the latest version of the JAR as\npart of the ANT script / automated build process that runs the tests,\nbefore the tests start running?\n\nCheers,\n\nJames\n\n&gt;\n&gt;  Todd.\n&gt;  ----\n&gt;  Todd Bradley - Polycom, Inc.\n&gt;  ReadiVideo QA Lead\n&gt;                    \n\n",
