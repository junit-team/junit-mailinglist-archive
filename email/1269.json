But the project doesn&#39;t seem to be as active as the JUnit <br/>\ncommunity :-) and that&#39;s why I asked all of you about the possibilities in <br/>\nJunit<br/>\n<br/>\nBest regards,<br/>\n<br/>\nJ. Andersen<br/>\n<br/>\nBhavaniprasad Polimetla &lt;bhavaniprasad.polimetla@...&gt; said:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Jens Andersen wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hi all,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; First of all I have to mention that I&#39;m pretty novice when it comes to use<br/>\n&gt; &gt; JUnit for writing unittests. But I have a question which I hope some of <br/>\n </span></blockquote>you<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; can help me with - it&#39;s regarding testing private/protected methods and <br/>\n </span></blockquote>how<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; to organize my test package.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; First the package. I have read to articles regarding test (&quot;Junit best<br/>\n&gt; &gt; practices&quot; from JavaWorld and &quot;Incremental development with Ant and JUnit&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; from developerWorks). In the JBT article Andy Schneider advice you to keep<br/>\n&gt; &gt; tests in the same location as the source code. And in the Incremental...<br/>\n&gt; &gt; article Malcolm Davis advice you to make a separate package. Which <br/>\n </span></blockquote>approach<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; is the best to use?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; it is better to make separate package. when we can identify as two separate<br/>\n&gt; components like source code and test code it is better to keep them as two<br/>\n&gt; different components from configuration management point of view.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I must admit that I like the idea of making a separate package but then<br/>\n&gt; &gt; again - how do I then test private and protected methods? And if I keep <br/>\n </span></blockquote>the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; tests in the same location as the source code - who do I then test private<br/>\n&gt; &gt; methods?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; we cant test private and protected methods directly.<br/>\n&gt; we need to find the public methods, which are using those protected and <br/>\n </span></blockquote>private<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; methods and test that public methods is enough. Still it is not sufficient.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; one thing the developer can do is, he can change the private and protected <br/>\n </span></blockquote>to<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; public and test them. after that he can change back to private and protected<br/>\n&gt; respectively. but this is not that much good idea.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; still we need to find the exact way.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I would very much appreciate if some of you could give me a little example<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Kind regards,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; J.
