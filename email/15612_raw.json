TestNG isn&#39;t just\n&gt; used for unit tests, it&#39;s used for all sorts of tests including\n&gt; long-running integration tests. TDD doesn&#39;t really apply there,\n&gt; because the window may well be several hours.\n\nAbsolutely agreed, Robert. I don&#39;t claim that TestNG is bad because it \nsupports integration and system testing. JUnit encouraging a certain \nstyle of testing, and TestNG encourages another. I have (almost) always \nsaid that they&#39;re for difference uses, and possibly different audiences. \nThey overlap, but have enough differences to be fit for different purposes.\n\n&gt; Using dependencies (of some form) to prevent long-running tests from\n&gt; running when you know they will (probably) fail anyway is a good idea.\n&gt; However, it doesn&#39;t assist the developer at the point where they need\n&gt; to diagnose failure that much.\n&gt; \n&gt; This is, of course, why serious JUnit developers focus on dividing\n&gt; tests into fast and slow. :) It&#39;s also why we don&#39;t tend to see a need\n&gt; for other categories.\n\nGood. I&#39;m not the only one.\n-- \nJ. B.
