I have a class under test and to test each o=\r\nf the methods of the class there are different test methods in my test clas=\r\ns. Now testing all these methods requires different test data. Here is wher=\r\ne my question lies, is it possible to annotate the test method to somehow s=\r\nay use these setup methods, or use this setup method.\n&gt;\n&gt; I can obviously i=\r\nnclude the data population code within my test method. But in my situation =\r\nthere can be two test methods that require the same setup and this would th=\r\nen mean code duplication.\n&gt;\n&gt; Right now the only way I can think of is to c=\r\nreate these setup methods and call them individually from all my test metho=\r\nds which require that setup. Is that the right way to go about this?\n&gt;\n&gt; Th=\r\nanks\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo! Groups Links\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n",
