Two of these sections involve accessing a Web Server and a series \n&gt; of Web Services that may or may not be running when I am testing - each \n&gt; of these also access other resources that may not be running (data \n&gt; stream and a SQL database respectively).\n&gt; \n&gt; I thought HttpUnit would work, but that seems more geared to testing web \n&gt; pages - not testing Java code that reads web pages. What I want to do is \n&gt; build up a set SOAP page that my calls will act upon, thus I can create \n&gt; good and bad SOAP returns and test them - even mangled SOAP headers and \n&gt; test that it does the right thing when this happens (and given \n&gt; communication capabilities in the places this software will be deployed \n&gt; this will happen quite often).\n&gt; \n&gt; As an example of testing the balanceCheck function I need to build up a \n&gt; XML file with a given balance result, let the code read it, then test \n&gt; that everything happened correctly.\n&gt; \n&gt; Code snippet at the bottom of email.\n&gt; \n&gt; Any ideas on how best to skin this cat?\n\nHtmlUnit provides support for URLs returning pages other than HtmlPages, \nso that might help. You may be able to parse the return page as an XML \ndocument, without the framework trying to treat it like HTML.\n-- \nJ. B.
