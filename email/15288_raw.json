Now, if I were to ask \nthe Eclipse framework writers to think about, document, publish, and \nguarantee to all the world for all time an API for what I&#39;m requesting, \nit would be too much to ask.  A middle ground seems the fair solution: \nthey open the door, with documentation that it&#39;s in an internal package, \nor only for people who know what they&#39;re doing, and I promise to know \nwhat I&#39;m doing. \n\nAs an extender, I don&#39;t want there to be only published and committed \nfor all the world, and private to everyone.  To use an online publishing \nmetaphor, I&#39;m willing to pay the cost for a premium subscription, in \nreading undocumented source code and risk of future breakage.  :)  And \nwhen that premium subscription is offered without my asking, then I can \nget my extension to market quicker, which makes me happier about \nEclipse, and Eclipse a more useful and used platform.\n\nThat&#39;s just my experience.  Some clarification on terminology, and then \nI&#39;m done:\n\nElliotte Harold wrote:\n\n&gt; David Saff wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; My experience is that it is best to allow a gradient to your users and\n&gt; &gt; extenders.  There should be public, javadoc&#39;ed, committed, released \n&gt; API,\n&gt; &gt; but there should also be some beta API&#39;s, protected methods without\n&gt; &gt; commitment, public implementation classes in packages marked internal. \n&gt; &gt; Is it necessary that the presence of the latter should interfere at all\n&gt; &gt; with the comprehensibility or quality of the former?\n&gt;\n&gt; Beta APIs should not be part of an official release. They should be part\n&gt; of clearly marked beta releases where users know hat they&#39;re getting\n&gt; into before they use them.\n\nOf course.\n\n&gt; Protected methods are part of the published API and there&#39;s no reason to\n&gt; expect users not to rely on them. marking something &quot;protected&quot; only\n&gt; reflects its access protection. It doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s more or less likely\n&gt; to change in the future. Overloading the word &quot;protected&quot; in this way\n&gt; can only serve to confuse users.\n\nSorry.  I meant &quot;without commitment&quot; meaning &quot;documented as possibly \nunstable&quot;, not that all protected methods were automatically to be \nunderstood as implicitly so documented.\n\n&gt; Packages documented internal are a code smell, and should be avoided.\n&gt; Usually these can be made genuinely non-public in an existing package\n&gt; instead.\n\nI agree to disagree.\n\n    David Saff\n\n",
