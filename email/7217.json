It was nothing big: three weeks of Saturdays -- but it was my first professional project with a dynamically-typed language with no type checker. This caused me some problems, just because I&#39;m not used to it. I usually say, &quot;The compiler just stops me from making mistakes that I don&#39;t make anyway.&quot; I suppose that&#39;s not quite right for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhow, that&#39;s just a lead-in to my comment. In many cases, I would have either an unexpected &#39;nil&#39; value, or an object that doesn&#39;t understand an expected message. My first instinct is to get in there with &quot;p this&quot; and &quot;p that&quot;... then I thought of this: if I have a &#39;nil&#39; object over here, then there must be a bug over there... and when I started writing tests checking that results are non-nil over there, I no longer needed to trace my code.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m still learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo said <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:steven.hale@...\">steven.hale@...</a> on 3/13/2003 --------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nMy debugging habits are usually something like this:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Read the error message (if there is one)<br/>\n2. Think<br/>\n3. Read the log<br/>\n4. Think<br/>\n5. Write a unit test<br/>\n6. Launch the debugger<br/>\n<br/>\nSince adopting junit (2 -3 years ago) I can honestly say I&#39;ve not yet been<br/>\nforced down to level 6! I try to encourage programmers in my team not to<br/>\nstart at 6 first.<br/>\n<br/>\nJudging by the varied responses there&#39;s clearly a whole range of other<br/>\nsuccessful strategies - maybe it&#39;s related to the type of application being<br/>\nprogrammed.<br/>\n<br/>\nSteven<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!
