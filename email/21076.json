I&#39;d like to do something like this:<br/>\n<br/>\n@RunWith(Suite.class)<br/>\n@...({Test0.class, Test1.class})<br/>\npublic abstract class MySuite{<br/>\n  abstract public void  setBackend(Backend backend);<br/>\n<br/>\n @BeforeClass<br/>\n  public static void doSetup() throws Exception{<br/>\n    //... stuff to get this all pulled together and configure the tests<br/>\n  }<br/>\n}<br/>\n<br/>\nThen all a tester needs to do is extend the class MySuite, implement the <br/>\nmethod and s/he gets to run their backend against my tests.<br/>\n<br/>\nComplicating factors are that java does not allow for annotations to be <br/>\ninherited unless the @interface is created with the @Inherited <br/>\nannotation, so attempts to do what is above kick back the message that <br/>\nthere are no tests to run or some such. At least this is my <br/>\nunderstanding of java annotations...<br/>\n<br/>\nThe real life example has not just a couple of test classes, but many <br/>\nmore that very rigorously exercise the backend. The kludge is to have <br/>\nthe abstract MySuite class and have the annotations cut and pasted every <br/>\ntime. This is bad since it will make maintainability problematic (we <br/>\nhave lots of different backend configurations people want to test <br/>\nagainst). What&#39;s more several people who want to use this really don&#39;t <br/>\nknow that much about jUnit and we&#39;d really like it to be the case they <br/>\ncan write a backend then get good feedback on robustness, failure modes, <br/>\nyou name it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs this clearer?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in Advance!<br/>\n<br/>\nJeff<br/>\n<br/>\nDavid Saff wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Jeff,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Can you expand on what you mean by &quot;The problem is that making a suite<br/>\n&gt; using annotations does not really work so well.

Now,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; these run against a single backend and now several developers in my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; group would like to use these tests against other backends to test them.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The most natural way to do this is with the test suite mechanism in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; jUnit. That is to say, make up a suite that requires merely that the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; backend be set and test away. Or so I thought.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The different backends are different projects in our group and live in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; different Maven modules.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The problem is that making a suite using annotations does not really<br/>\n&gt; &gt; work so well. The annotations are not inherited. The other solution<br/>\n&gt; &gt; which is to have the developers make their own suites by annotations is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; also very clunky and will probably break at some point.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; So here is my question: Is there any way to make a test suite that is a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; harness and can be reused?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I assume that jUnit 3.8&#39;s method of explicitly creating a suite is going<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to get deprecated soon, right? So that would be a deadend. Also, are<br/>\n&gt; &gt; their plans to make annotations inheritable at some point in jUnit? We<br/>\n&gt; &gt; could maybe live with cutting and pasting for the short term if we knew<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that this issue would get resolved at some point.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Thanks!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Jeff<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
