It&#39;s a &quot;good thing&quot; to have the\n&gt; tests for a class included in the class. The classes\n&gt; are self contained.  Why go back to the C++ days of\n&gt; having separate files for the same class: .h, .cpp,\n&gt; test.cpp. \n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m sure different teams are have different work\n&gt; pactices, but when the tests are in a separate\n&gt; class,\n&gt; tests don&#39;t get updated/created.  The biggest\n&gt; impediment to creating unit tests was the need to\n&gt; crack open a separate test class.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; David Jared\n&gt; Distributed Workshop\n&gt; (303) 359-7190\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\nI disagree.  It&#39;s a matter of making testing a habit. \n\n\nI&#39;ve heard several arguments both for and against\nhaving tests contained in the class they are\ntesting...so far I fail to be convinced that having\nthem separated is a bad thing.\n\nWhen they are separate, the tests will get\ncreated...if you make the effort.  And, stating that\nthis is a reason not to use JUnit, sounds like you\nwere just looking for a reason not to use it.  Try it\nfor a week or two...or for some small little project\nyou&#39;re working on (or piece of a project, whatever). \nI&#39;ve found JUnit invaluable and use it both at work\nand at home.  Coding without it seems now, to me,\ncounter productive.  But that&#39;s just me. :)\n\n\n-Eric\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nSend FREE Valentine eCards with Yahoo! Greetings!\nhttp://greetings.yahoo.com\n\n",
