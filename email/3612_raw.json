The only thing is that Kent and Erich put in some checks to see\nwhether you were running in VAJ or not for (I think) ClassLoader issues and\nnon-packaged classes (that is, classes w/o a package statement).  This is all\ntransparent to the user.  As far as I am concerned, as the client of the\nframework, the implementation is the same whether I am running in VAJ or\nagainst the file system.\n\n-jason\n\n--- John Clarke &lt;john@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Andoni,\n&gt; ahhh i c , well the way JUNIT is implemented in Visual Age is a little more\n&gt; useful than in JBuilder, but then I am just trying to learn that IDE\n&gt; (JBuilder) to see if it is any good for my purposes. Visual Age is quite\n&gt; nice though once you&#39;re into it. Like all these things it&#39;s quite subjective\n&gt; and the only way to find out is to try them , I got the IBM Visual Age for\n&gt; Java from IBM on a developer disk which was helpful, (I develop on NT).\n&gt; john\n&gt; \n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Andoni O&#39;Conchubhair [mailto:andoni.oconchubhair@...]\n&gt; Sent: 21 December 2001 12:20\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: RE: [junit] how do i start using Junit\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Just that I write my java (tests and all) from a text editor and I have\n&gt; noticed from what people say that they don&#39;t all hand-write tests and I was\n&gt; wondering what (or how much) the IDE does for you?\n&gt; \n&gt; Andoni.\n&gt; \n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: John Clarke [mailto:john@...]\n&gt; Sent: 21 December 2001 12:24\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: RE: [junit] how do i start using Junit\n&gt; \n&gt; just how it&#39;s installed and used, for example the implementation in Jbuilder\n&gt; is different to Visual Age...\n&gt; ?\n&gt; \n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Andoni O&#39;Conchubhair [mailto:andoni.oconchubhair@...]\n&gt; Sent: 21 December 2001 12:01\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: RE: [junit] how do i start using Junit\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; What do you mean by &#39;it depends on your IDE&#39;????\n&gt; Can you explain this?\n&gt; \n&gt; Andoni.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: John Clarke [mailto:john@...]\n&gt; Sent: 21 December 2001 12:06\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: RE: [junit] how do i start using Junit\n&gt; \n&gt; sid,\n&gt; it depends on your IDE so as Bernd says ...\n&gt; see the papers on www.junit.org which are quite helpful.\n&gt; john\n&gt; \n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Bernd Proissl [mailto:lists@...]\n&gt; Sent: 21 December 2001 11:56\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: RE: [junit] how do i start using Junit\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; can any one help me out.\n&gt; &gt; ia&#39;m going for a java exam and i need to test my code which i decided\n&gt; &gt; i&#39;ll do using JUNIT.\n&gt; &gt; can anyone help me out in that.\n&gt; \n&gt; see the papers on www.junit.org\n&gt; \n&gt; Bernd\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
