I am using silk central and found that we could also integrate Junit. But just wondering the benefit out of this.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance,<br/>\nRudra<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gaurav Pandey&quot; &lt;gaurav_dell@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From the HP Website, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://h20229.www2.hp.com/partner/isv/Arsin_prod1.jsp\">http://h20229.www2.hp.com/partner/isv/Arsin_prod1.jsp</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I found that Effecta Integration Framework by Arsin Corporation may be used for JUNIT integration. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Unfortunaly, I am not able to find any documentation which tells me how to achieve this?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Any pointers? <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Regards<br/>\n&gt; Gaurav Pandey<br/>\n&gt; www.WhatIsTesting.com <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gaurav Pandey&quot; &lt;gaurav_dell@&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hi<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I am a software tester with no experience with JUnit however, I think I know my way around HPQC. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; For one of the projects, the development team is using JUnit to prepare test cases, however as a process, I have been asked to find out if JUnit and HPQC are compatible.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I would request any suggestions/pointers/Challenges/best practices which would assist me in understanding the compatibility. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I also have some questions which I was not able to figure out?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; 1. Is JUnit a unit testing tool? or is it a testing management tool in which we store test cases and test execution results<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 2. I have download Junit from the <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.junit.org/,\">http://www.junit.org/,</a> however I have not been able to &quot;load&quot; the tool. I am not sure on which file to execute? I am running on Windows XP SP2. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I understand that these might be newbie questions, however any pointers you might provide me would be very appericated<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
