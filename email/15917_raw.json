However, the logic would be more likely that it\n&gt; &gt; would try every possible way to run the class as a JUnit 3 test, and\n&gt; &gt; then try JUnit 4 as a fallback (since not all JUnit 4 test classes have\n&gt; &gt; @Test).\n&gt;\n&gt; What would happen if I have:\n&gt;\n&gt; @Test (expected=Bar.class)\n&gt; public void testMyFoo () {}\n&gt;\n&gt; If we execute junit3 style, it will find this test case, but won&#39;t see\n&gt; the expected= attribute.\nIf the class doesn&#39;t inherit from TestCase, then only the JUnit 4 \nbehavior will work.  If it does, then you should probably disambiguate \nanyway, for which the suite() method probably makes sense.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Oh, and since I&#39;m talking to another person from a school with a great\n&gt; &gt; &gt; CS dept ;-), I&#39;m really interested in writing good docs for students\n&gt; &gt; &gt; on how to write test suites, especially for data structures (the focus\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of the 15-211 course). I have something that I hacked up for our first\n&gt; &gt; &gt; homework, however, this kind of thing would be great to make into a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; tutorial that could be used by other classes.\n&gt; &gt; Lecture 11 from MIT 6.170 is the best pre-prepared doc I know of around\n&gt; &gt; here:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Electrical-Engineering-and-Computer-Science/6-170Laboratory-in-Software-EngineeringFall2001/LectureNotes/index.htm\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;d be very interested in your materials, as well, if they&#39;re publicly\n&gt; &gt; available.  Thanks,\n&gt;\n&gt; That&#39;s pretty interesting. I like the formal introduction to JUnit.\n&gt; How much experience would the typical person taking this course have?\nFor some of them, this is their second programming course (the first \nbeing based on Scheme)\n&gt;\n&gt; The docs I have for this assignment are:\n&gt;\n&gt; An assignment overview\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~bmaurer/15-211/s06/snake/docs/ \n&gt; &lt;http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/%7Ebmaurer/15-211/s06/snake/docs/&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; An introduction to testing:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~bmaurer/15-211/s06/snake/docs/testing.html \n&gt; &lt;http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/%7Ebmaurer/15-211/s06/snake/docs/testing.html&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I think this documentation is coming in to the idea of testing from a\n&gt; different angle than the MIT one: my goal here is to enable people to\n&gt; understand how JUnit will help them for this assignment, rather than\n&gt; to give the background of &quot;what is testing, why do we do it, etc&quot;.\nI like this approach--the goals of a novice (I&#39;ll get a good grade) are \noften different than those of an expert (my code won&#39;t break the same \nway it did last time).  However, I&#39;m not sure about the definition of \n&quot;stress testing&quot; used here: in my lexicon, stress testing has more to do \nwith replicating adverse environmental conditions (unusually large \nnumbers of clients, shutdown of the backup database).\n&gt; Just for some fun stats about how people are doing on this assignment\n&gt; so far: about 50 people have submitted a solution for the problem so\n&gt; far (out of 190 students) -- it is due thursday at midnight (!!!). Of\n&gt; these people, about 20 pass the tests for the circular buffer based\n&gt; queue, about 15 pass them for hash table. Glancing over people&#39;s code,\n&gt; it looks like the people who submitted test cases along with their\n&gt; code are doing much better on the submission system&#39;s tests (nb:\n&gt; students are not allowed to see their results on all of our test\n&gt; cases. So they are &quot;blind&quot; in some ways).\nI&#39;d definitely be interested in the final tally.  I&#39;ve done some \nresearch along similar lines \n(http://pag.csail.mit.edu/pubs/ct-user-study-issta2004-abstract.html)\n&gt; We&#39;re thinking of some fun ways we can put testing into the course.\n&gt; For example, I was thinking of giving people partial credit for the\n&gt; assignment if they 1) wrote a patch for their own code and 2) wrote\n&gt; test cases that caught their bugs. At dinner last night with another\n&gt; TA friend, we thought about an assignment where we would give people\n&gt; .jar files with a broken List/Queue/HashSet/whatever and they would\n&gt; have to 1) figure out what was wrong and 2) write a test case.\nFor 6.170 a couple years ago, I wrote a mutation tester, which would \nmodify the student&#39;s production code in particular ways, and make sure \nthat the changes caused their test suite to pass.  It was quite fun, and \ntook much longer than just eyeballing the test suites.  :-)  Have fun,\n\n    David Saff\n\n",
