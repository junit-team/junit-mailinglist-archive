Besides, the original<br/>\n&gt; poster was not necessarily talking about unit testing.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Time and again, I&#39;ve had the need to create tests that depend on each<br/>\n&gt; other. It&#39;s not very common (most of my tests are isolated), but when<br/>\n&gt; you encounter this problem, you really need a way to specify that<br/>\n&gt; certain tests depend on each other, for two reasons:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; - You are testing logic that has dependencies itself, so it should<br/>\n&gt; come as no surprise that the tests that exercise it need dependencies<br/>\n&gt; as well.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; - More accurate reporting. In the case where a test that failed<br/>\n&gt; causes dozens of others to fail as well, would you rather read &quot;1<br/>\n&gt; SUCCESS, 19 FAILURES&quot; or &quot;1 SUCCESS, 1 FAILURE, 18 SKIPS&quot;?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The latter error message singles out the test that really failed and<br/>\n&gt; also tells you that for now, you can ignore the other 18 tests that<br/>\n&gt; were skipped because they didn&#39;t really fail: they simply didn&#39;t run.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The fact that JUnit doesn&#39;t support dependent testing was one of the<br/>\n&gt; reasons why I created TestNG in the first place, and David, I still<br/>\n&gt; have some hope that at some point, JUnit is going to go beyond its<br/>\n&gt; &quot;unit testing&quot; scope and start addressing other forms of testing as<br/>\n&gt; well :-)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; Cedric<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://testng.org\">http://testng.org</a><br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>",
