Since, I have \nlot of testcases like this it is not possible to verify m=\r\nanually.\nDoes Junit support this feature like comparing any two files check=\r\ning \nfor the difference and then if something is not matching, showing me \n=\r\nthe testcase and the lines due to which has failed.\n\nIf yes, how to do the =\r\nsame.\n\nThanks in adavance,\nKavitha\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
