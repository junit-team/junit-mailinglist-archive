If I have written my asserts well, I usually don&#39;t even need to look at the logging, because I will know exactly what went wrong.\n\nHope this helps and good luck on the migration.\n\n\nDianne\n\n-------------- Original message -------------- \nFrom: &quot;isowitz&quot; &lt;isowitz@...&gt; \nI have to rewrite existing tests in JUnit tests. The old tests logs \nwith a java.util.logging.Logger, e.g. starttime, start sendind data, \nstart recieving data, the recieved data etc. - in a word they logs \nall that can be logged. \nShould I use the java.util.logging.Logger for JUnit too or is that \nthe bad way?\n\nYou spoke about reports of my result. What other kind of reports \nexists?\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, didoss@... wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; What do you mean by logging,...do you mean reports of your results -\nthen Google JUnitReport.\n&gt; \n&gt; -------------- Original message -------------- \n&gt; From: &quot;isowitz&quot; &lt;isowitz@...&gt; \n&gt; I have a problem with logging JUnit tests. In a package I have a \n&gt; AllTests class that calls several tests. The result of that tests \n&gt; should be logged.\n&gt; I&#39;m not familiar with JUnit or logging so I try to find examples in \nthe \n&gt; web. Unfortunately i found no examples or hints for me.\n&gt; \n&gt; How do you log your JUnit results? \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n\n\n \n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
