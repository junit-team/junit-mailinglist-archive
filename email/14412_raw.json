I understand you to be saying that you don&#39;t use IDEs, at least not\nall the time, and you would like a friendlier presentation of test results\nthan what is available from the textual test runner.\n\nOur thinking about the role of graphical runners in the base JUnit release\nevolved in a couple of steps. First, we noticed that JUnit depended on AWT\nand Swing classes even though those classes didn&#39;t seem central to the\nframework. This is an aesthetic point, but aesthetics often lead us in the\nright direction so we trust them. Breaking this dependency required breaking\nJUnit into two parts, core and UI. Once we had broken JUnit up we came to\nthe second step of deciding who should be responsible for the UI. Ant and\nthe IDEs already have their own user interface and represent the (vast?)\nmajority of JUnit usage, so there is little value added by maintaining\nseparate UIs. With our limited time to support JUnit, it didn&#39;t make sense\nto continue maintaining the graphical runners ourselves.\n\nWe aren&#39;t against standalone runners in general. One of our goals with JUnit\n4 is to make writing runners easier. However, we seldom have code in the\nJUnit distribution that we didn&#39;t write and there is a widely established\ncommunity of JUnit extenders. Because of this we are comfortable letting go\nof the graphical runners and encouraging people to write and publish their\nown. If there is anything more we can do to aid in this endeavor, please let\nus know.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nKent Beck\nThree Rivers Institute\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On \n&gt; Behalf Of Jason Rogers\n&gt; Sent: Monday, August 22, 2005 7:05 AM\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: RE: [junit] Some questions about JUnit 4\n&gt; \n&gt; On Mon, 2005-08-22 at 09:50 +0100, Clarke, Andrew wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Was I the only person to be saddened by this announcement?  \n&gt; Maybe I&#39;m\n&gt; &gt; just being sentimental here but the Graphical TestRunner&#39;s green\n&gt; &gt; bar/red\n&gt; &gt; bar was one of the earliest delights of Junit.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Besides, as a casual user of Java I have yet to find the energy to\n&gt; &gt; learn\n&gt; &gt; an IDE.  When I do have to code Java I generally use my normal text\n&gt; &gt; editor and the graphical test runner, which I find is quicker and\n&gt; &gt; easier\n&gt; &gt; to use than the text version.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I know Kent has an evangelising streak - automated unit testing,\n&gt; &gt; xp/agile, etc - which he has used well in the service of \n&gt; the software\n&gt; &gt; community but I think insisting on the use of an IDE is a \n&gt; crusade too\n&gt; &gt; far.\n&gt; \n&gt; I was disappointed by this news as well.  I do use an IDE for most of\n&gt; the day, but when I have to work remotely I use &#39;vi&#39; over SSH \n&gt; and a GUI\n&gt; TestRunner on my local machine.  So personally, I would like \n&gt; to have at\n&gt; least one graphical TestRunner. (Yes, I know that I could set up many\n&gt; IDEs to do the same thing -- Eclipse for instance -- but that chews up\n&gt; too many resources on my laptop.)\n&gt; \n&gt; Kent, perhaps you would consider adding a community section to CVS and\n&gt; allow us to add code there.  You can document this portion of the\n&gt; repository as being &quot;unwarranted&quot; (whatever that would mean). \n&gt;  It would\n&gt; allow for the community to add their $0.02.  I don&#39;t think \n&gt; anyone wants\n&gt; to make more work for you or Erich, but it would be nice to \n&gt; have an easy\n&gt; way for everyone to use JUnit in a way that is comfortable to them.\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; Jason Rogers\n&gt; \n&gt; I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ\n&gt; liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the\n&gt; faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.\n&gt; (Galatians 2:20)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
