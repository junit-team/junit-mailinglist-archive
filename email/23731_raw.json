This output isn&#39;t just the number of tests failed/successfu=\r\nl/ignored and time lapse, but it is the output generated by the tests and j=\r\nunit at run time.\n\nI would like to redirect the output to a file, I am look=\r\ning at the junit source code (as a good boyscout) and the only classes I co=\r\nuld find that MAYBE print on the console is junit.textui.ResultPrinter but =\r\nit prints the results of the tests.\nMy question is:\nAre there any classes i=\r\nn the source code that prints output on the command line? (If yes, what are=\r\n they?)\n\nThank you for your time\n\n\n",
