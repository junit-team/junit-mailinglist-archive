My Company developes a<br/>\n&gt;  Web Service that receives XML queries.<br/>\n&gt;  Some of the queries are very similar.<br/>\n&gt;  There are lots of &#39;health&#39; objects on the server.<br/>\n&gt;  And more than 10 commands &quot;getlist&quot; which<br/>\n&gt;  return XML containing list of these objects.<br/>\n&gt;  e.g. &quot;glucose_getlist&quot;, &quot;bloodpresure_getlist&quot;,<br/>\n&gt;  &quot;bloodsugar_getlist&quot; etc.<br/>\n&gt;  There are also filters for these &quot;getlist&quot; queries<br/>\n&gt;  - &quot;newerthan&quot;, &quot;last&quot;, &quot;device_manifacture&quot; etc.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  I wanted to simplify testing these commands, so<br/>\n&gt;  I made one &quot;BasicGetListTest&quot; which receives the<br/>\n&gt;  name of the object and test for the common<br/>\n&gt;  functionality - send a common request and receives<br/>\n&gt;  all available objects with this name on the server .<br/>\n&gt;  I want to use the result from  this common test in<br/>\n&gt;  the other methods with the filters to understand if<br/>\n&gt;  &quot;getlist&quot; with  filter returns all/less/more objects.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  Now I there is the problem. I want to run &quot;testCommon&quot;<br/>\n&gt;  first which is in the &quot;BasicGetListTest&quot; but when I<br/>\n&gt;  subclass it with &quot;GlucoseGetListTest&quot; it is always<br/>\n&gt;  executed last. I read some of the postings in this<br/>\n&gt;  newsgroup, but it seems that such kind of requirement<br/>\n&gt;  point a desing flaw and I should somehow rearrange my<br/>\n&gt;  Unit Test Structure to made the tests indepentdant. I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt;  stuck with it. On one hand I want to use inheritance to<br/>\n&gt;  save code, on the other hand I cannot.<br/>\n&gt;  I do not want to use TestSuit also, because this way I<br/>\n&gt;  will have to write like 15-20 different similar TestSuits<br/>\n&gt;  (one for each action with only a couple of characters<br/>\n&gt;   different in the java code).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  Do you ,guys, have any fresh ideas how to do this ?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  have a nice day and thanks a lot,<br/>\n&gt;    Kaloyan<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Yahoo! Groups Links<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
