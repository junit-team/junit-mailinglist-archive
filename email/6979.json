How, if at all, do you determine what&#39;s too little or too much?<br/>\n<br/>\nTo answer the original question, here is what the efforts I have been<br/>\ninvolved in have done:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Get an early testing effort started. This is very important. Just get<br/>\nsomething started. If you can&#39;t convince management to do TDD, then convince<br/>\nthem to do some form of unit testing, even if it isn&#39;t the developer<br/>\nthemselves testing. Later on you can get TDD started at some level.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Polish up your tests to be effective and efficient at finding bugs.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) Add new unit test cases to cover bugs you find later so that if the code<br/>\nis changed that particular bug is tested for on each build.<br/>\n<br/>\n4) Conduct various coverage metrics. If you don&#39;t measure you won&#39;t know,<br/>\nyou will just be guessing. One hundred percent coverage is desireable, but<br/>\nmay not always be attainable, especially in some modes, but by all means<br/>\nmeasure it.<br/>\n<br/>\n5) There are metrics you can use to measure the number and severity of bugs<br/>\nthat are being found or that exist in the code at any given time. You will<br/>\nsee patterns depending on the development and testing methodologies. In a<br/>\nmature process you will see upturns in bug numbers (maybe in severity<br/>\ndepending on the maturity of the code) as new features and logic are<br/>\nintroduced, then maybe plateaus, and hopefully drop offs. This is where the<br/>\nmetrics require some human interpretation. As you gain experience with the<br/>\nmetrics and the code, you will gain confidence in what quantity and quality<br/>\nof bugs are acceptable for the codebase.<br/>\n<br/>\nLauren<br/>\n<br/>\n=====<br/>\nLooking for an experienced Java/C++ Software Engineer?<br/>\nSee: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://developerdude.mystarband.net/resume.html\">http://developerdude.mystarband.net/resume.html</a> </span></blockquote></div>",
