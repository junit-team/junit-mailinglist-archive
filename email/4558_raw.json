I&#39;m sure that, if=\r\n well presented, the JUnit team would\nbe willing to evaluate your solution =\r\nand add it to a future release (is\nthis true guys?).\n\nI believe that, if pe=\r\nople want to test private methods (and this is an\nissue that crops up frequ=\r\nently), they should be allowed to do so (if\nsuch functionality is readilly =\r\navailable).\n\nMany people on this list believe that unit testing the public =\r\nAPI helps\nthe overall design of the system (low coupling, high cohesion, ..=\r\n.), and\nhelps decouple solutions from their different implementations.  Man=\r\ny\ninteresting points and suggestions have been raised over this issue,\nhowe=\r\nver, they belong to a Testing&Design discussion, not a Unit Testing\ndiscuss=\r\nion.\n\nIn the light of Unit Testing, if people want to unit test private\nmet=\r\nhods, so be it.  The JUnit documentation could point out some of the\nissues=\r\n and uses of Unit Tests and how they help with the overall design\nof a syst=\r\nem (they may already do so, but its been a while since I last\nlooked), but =\r\nthe tool is for Unit Testing, and as such, should allow\npeople to use it as=\r\n they will, so long as they know what they are up to.\n\nManuel Amago.\nmailto=\r\n:mamago@...\n\n\n",
