It takes an input file executes all the \nattribute values and throws an exception if there is an error. There \nare about 150+ of these files. To fix it up I wrapped it in Junit. Now \neach executed file is treated as an individual test. This works great, \nI have a nice gui telling me which testfiles passed and which failed. \nThe problem is that it doesnt tell me why they fail. the original \nprogram still throws an exception but Junit cannot hear it. Is there \nany way of directing the error to Junit? thanks Jonno\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
