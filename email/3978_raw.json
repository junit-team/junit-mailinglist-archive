Because many of the methodologies \n&gt; &gt; suggested for \n&gt; &gt; unit testing aren&#39;t applicable to this sort of testing.  Have \n&gt; &gt; the xUnit \n&gt; &gt; people, or anyone else for that matter, addressed this problem\n&gt; space?\n&gt; \n&gt; Hi,\n&gt; \n&gt; I am currently co-writing a practitioners report submission for the\n&gt; XP2002\n&gt; conference about our[*] experiences with acceptance testing. We&#39;ve got\n&gt; a\n&gt; testing framework that&#39;s not based on JUnit at all, and we think it&#39;s\n&gt; working very well.\n&gt; \n&gt; We force the application to operate in batch mode while we acceptance\n&gt; test\n&gt; it, provide input from file/standard input redirects, and collect all\n&gt; output\n&gt; as text files. We then have the full power of unix text processing\n&gt; commands\n&gt; (ie diff) to analyse and compare the output to previous runs. Basically,\n&gt; if\n&gt; the output is different, the test fails.\n&lt;snip /&gt;\n\nMy last recommendation to IBM&#39;s e-commerce organization, before I left, was to \nimplement something similar for their system. They have been struggling with \nautomating test cases because they have focussed on automating tests through \nthe browser interface, when usually they want to test the application&#39;s \nbusiness behavior. I didn&#39;t think about distributing the test execution at the \ntime, so that&#39;s quite neat.\n\nAlthough not everyone agrees that test-oriented design tends to lead to better \ndesign overall, I think that refactoring a system to allow this text-based, \nbatch operation has a strong chance of resulting in a more highly change-\nresistant design.\n\nJ.
