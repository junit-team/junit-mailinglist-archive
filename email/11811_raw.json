Here is the sitatution:\n\n \n\nInterface A   &lt;------implements---- GenericClassA\n\n     ^                                               ^\n\n     |                                                |\n\n extends                                     extends\n\n     |                                               |\n\n     |                                               |\n\nInterface B   &lt;------implements---- GenericClassB\n\n \n\nGiven the above, I want to create a new class that extends\n&quot;GenericClassB&quot;, let&#39;s call it &quot;Foo&quot;.   Here are my questions:\n\n \n\n1.\tDo I need to set up FooTest to ensure that I haven&#39;t broken the\ncontract outlined by InterfaceA or InterfaceB?\n2.\tWhat&#39;s the best approach for setting up the tests so that I can\ndo this, while still maximizing the value in having FooTest inherit from\nGenericClassBTest?\n\n \n\nTo give some further insight into the approach that we&#39;ve currently\ntaken...\n\n \n\n1.\tGenericClassATest&#39;s suite has\n&quot;GenericClassATest.InterfaceATest.class&quot; and &quot;GenericClassATest.class&quot;.\n2.\tSimilarly, GenericClassBTest&#39;s suite has\n&quot;GenericClassBTest.InterfaceATest.class&quot;,\n&quot;GenericClassBTest.InterfaceBTest.class&quot;, and &quot;GenericClassBTest.class&quot;.\n\n \n\nA couple of further points on the problem:\n\n \n\n1.\tIt&#39;s difficult for me to wrap my head around how to connect the\ninitialization of the Test Fixture in the setUp() of the inner class to\na factory method which will return an instance of the class under test,\nsay at FooTest.createGenericClassB() when that inner class is in the\nsuper class.  Duplicating the inner class feels wrong and would be\nespecially painful if the inheritance tree was long and it was up to the\nProgrammer to research the inheritance and insure that they have inner\nclass for all possible interfaces.\n\n \n\nI hope I&#39;ve described this well enough to come through.  I find this a\nparticularly challenging problem and the only recourse that has been\nsuggested to be is the &quot;duplication&quot; approach, which, as I said, feels\nwrong.\n\n \n\nHopefully someone else has run into this and will allow me to climb\naboard their shoulders. :-)\n\n \n\nThanks in advance,\n\n \n\nTom\n\n \n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
