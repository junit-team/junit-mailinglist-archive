If this becomes a problem --=\r\n and it isn&#39;t always -- that&#39;s the \n&gt; point at which I&#39;d start moving tests=\r\n.\n\nYes, that was my feeling.  My only (slight) worry is that this type of\nt=\r\nhing happens over time, so there seems to be a risk of &quot;forgetting&quot;\nthat yo=\r\nu&#39;ve got some of these tests somewhere else.  That said if\nadditional funct=\r\nionality then breaks those tests then I guess (as you\nsaid) that&#39;s the time=\r\n to move/change them.\n\n&gt; Now it seems that A instantiates B directly, based=\r\n on your\ndescription. \n&gt; If that&#39;s true, then I would consider refactoring =\r\nA to allow me to \n&gt; inject B into it, and see how the tests would change. P=\r\nerhaps YAGNI,\nand \n&gt; as you say, you need to spend your time on other thing=\r\ns; however, my \n&gt; designs have always suffered from too /many/ hardcoded de=\r\npendencies,\nand \n&gt; not too /few/.\n\nAgreed, actually I&#39;ve already done this =\r\n- so I now have two types of\ntests for A - those that implicitly use the ac=\r\ntual functionality of B\n(because that&#39;s what it&#39;s supposed to do) and those=\r\n where I seed the\nbehaviour of B to allow me to test code flow.  \n\nIt&#39;s a s=\r\ntruts-based application so these second set of tests allow me to\ncheck that=\r\n given certain behaviours of B, A forwards to the relevant\npage.  I know I =\r\n*could* do this with struts-unit or some such like, but\nat the moment I thi=\r\nnk that is another level of complexity I have yet to\nget to (and I think it=\r\n&#39;s too heavy for my current requirement).  I\ncurrently &quot;get away with&quot; havi=\r\nng my Action delegate to some other\nclass(es) which I TDD, so then what&#39;s l=\r\neft is checking my Action\nforwards to where I want it to go to given some s=\r\ntimulus...\n\nThanks\n\nJonathan\n\n\n\n\n",
