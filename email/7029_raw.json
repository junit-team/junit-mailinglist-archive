B. Rainsberger&quot; &lt;jbr@...&gt;\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; If the interface isn&#39;t allowed to change, then we have a real problem.\n&gt; Software changes. Any time change is painful, change is discouraged.\n&gt; When change is discouraged, we reduce the likelihood of delivering the\n&gt; right software. My mission is to deliver the right software, so when\n&gt; the interface isn&#39;t allowed to change, I can&#39;t do my job.\n&gt;\n\nWell of course, all things need to change from time to time, and should be\nallowed to do so - but constantly changing interfaces, or interfaces that\nchange drastically, are an indication that there is something wrong - either\nin the process or in the code. I am not saying that interfaces shouldn&#39;t be\nallowed to change, but at some point they should become stable - and that\npoint is usually reached long before an independent unit tester get&#39;s their\nhands on the unit.\n\n&gt; So explain to me the difference between what you describe and Pair\n&gt; Programming combined with TDD. Is it just that other programmers are,\n&gt; on their own, writing tests for my stuff after I&#39;ve written it?\n\nThere can be. As with all things, team structure, process and methodology\ncan be tweaked to suit the team and the project. As you stated, TDD is not\nprimarily meant to find bugs, whereas independent unit testing is very good\nat that, and generally that is its primary purpose; early testing. If you\nhave an XP team that is so good that they write perfect code, and a *good*\nindependent unit tester can&#39;t find any bugs in the code, then don&#39;t use\nindependent unit testers and more power to you. But I have yet to see such a\nteam or such developers - and I feel fairly confident that I could write\nunit tests that would find significant bugs in just about any new codebase\nunder development - including a codebase developed using TDD.\n\nFWIW,\nLauren\n\n=====\nLooking for an experienced Java/C++ Software Engineer?\nSee: http://developerdude.mystarband.net/resume.html\n\n\n\n",
