For example, produce a system that is<br/>\nready to roll out into production at any time at all, given at most a<br/>\nfew hours notice. Or create a system such that a full production release<br/>\nof a huge system can be done in a couple of hours.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortuantely, it can be a lot easier to hire five, or even twenty,<br/>\nnot-so-talented programmers than one talented one.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;  &gt; In my current project, we don&#39;t even have any dedicated QA people...<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Hm. Do you mean that you don&#39;t have people who test full time? or you<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t have people will formal testing experience and/or raw testing skill?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>We don&#39;t have people who test full time, in the sense of someone devoted<br/>\nto writing customer and functional tests. Everybody helps out a bit with<br/>\nthe customer tests, though some more than others, and the functional<br/>\ntests are done by the programmers as they work on somethign that needs<br/>\nfunctional testing.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut another point of view would be that &quot;everyone is a full-time tester&quot;<br/>\nin that everyone is expected to make sure the code has reasonable test<br/>\ncoverage, and not just for the programmers&#39; unit tests.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Google &quot;What is exploratory testing?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Interesting. Does this quote really describe exploratory testing?<br/>\n<br/>\n     To the extent that the next test we do is influenced by the result<br/>\n     of the last test we did, we are doing exploratory testing.<br/>\n<br/>\n     (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.satisfice.com/articles/what_is_et.htm)\">http://www.satisfice.com/articles/what_is_et.htm)</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThis seems to me that it could just as well describe test-first<br/>\nprogramming; I often decide what my next test will be based on the<br/>\nprevious tests I&#39;ve just produced. (&quot;Hmmm. We just saw and fixed a<br/>\nfailure like such-and-such, does that mean that this other thing might<br/>\nbe able to fail like that, too? Let&#39;s write a test and find out.&quot;)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounds to me like the &quot;scripted testing&quot; he&#39;s talking about in that<br/>\narticle is not XP-style testing, where you run the tests as you come<br/>\nup with them, but instead one where you create a whole series of tests<br/>\nbefore you take them to the code. Especially where he says:<br/>\n<br/>\n    Scripting has its place. I can imagine testing situations where<br/>\n    efficiency and repeatability are so important that we should script<br/>\n    or automate them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t imagine a situation where efficiency and repeatability are<br/>\n*not* important enough to script the tests! But if you can somehow<br/>\nmanipulate the system quickly enough to do exploratory testing, you can<br/>\nprobably come up with a way for the script to manipulate the system even<br/>\nmore quickly, and then just add your tests to the script, rather than<br/>\nthrowing them away as soon as you&#39;ve tried them out.<br/>\n<br/>\ncjs<br/>\n-- <br/>\nCurt Sampson  &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cjs@...\">cjs@...</a>&gt;   +81 90 7737 2974   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.NetBSD.org\">http://www.NetBSD.org</a><br/>\n    Don&#39;t you know, in this new Dark Age, we&#39;re all light.  --XTC</div>",
