It\nstarts out in the junit3.8.1 directory.  Is the standard procedure\nto use that directory as its home, or is it normally moved to the\nJDK lib directory.  Would this make any difference?\n\n2) On Redhat 8.0, the swingui TestRunner could find and run\ntests on some built-in classes, such as junit.samples.money.MoneyTest.\nNow with Redhat 9, a clean install with no files from the old \nsystem, no test classes can be found -- not VectorTest, not \nmoney.MoneyTest, not samples.AllTests, nor tests.AllTests.  Does\nanyone know why these were found in Redhat 8 but not Redhat 9?\n\n3) Is there any kind of minimum hardware requirement?  I haven&#39;t\nseen one in the documentation, but I&#39;m running this on a bad\nmachine, namely a 300 MHz x86 with 256 MB RAM.\n\n4) The documentation for the installation process gives exactly\none troubleshooting tip.  It advises that if the initial tests do\nnot run, one should check to make sure that the junit.jar is on\nthe classpath.  If one is certain that junit.jar IS on the classpath\nbut it&#39;s still not working, one seems to be out of luck.  Are there\nany other JUnit troubleshooting documents or sources?\n\n5) Dave Astels posted earlier that he is using Redhat 9, Java 1.4.1\n01, and junit 3.8.1.  Are there other Linux JUnit users who can \ncompare their configurations, and possibly post configuration files \nsuch as .bashrc, etc.?  \n\nThanks\n\n\n\n",
