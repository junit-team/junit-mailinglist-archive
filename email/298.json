For example, there is a class called Trace that is used for debugging.  It has methods that you call at the beginning and end of each subroutine in your code to mark it.  How could you possibly write a test for this?  Others redirect output, etc, etc.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Any ideas how I can get this project off the ground?

Write tests for the public and protected methods in those<br/>\nclasses.  Work your way from the inside out.  As you progress you&#39;ll be able<br/>\nto see structure to the package (hopefully!)<br/>\n<br/>\nFor trace, I&#39;d want to know more about how trace works.  I suppose it sends<br/>\noutput to System.print?  You could try redirecting System.print with your<br/>\nown subclass.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s an example of redirecting stdout and stderr:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/TechTips/1999/tt1021.html#tip2\">http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/TechTips/1999/tt1021.html#tip2</a><br/>\n<br/>\nNow, subclass OutputStream and provide your own print methods which simply<br/>\nstuff the printed output into something like a Vector.  Now run your test<br/>\nmethod, and Assert that the vector contains the Strings you expect it to<br/>\ncontain given what you did with trace&#39;s calls.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJoi Ellis                    Software Engineer<br/>\nAravox Technologies          <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:joi@...\">joi@...</a>, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:gyles19@...\">gyles19@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\nNo matter what we think of Linux versus FreeBSD, etc., the one thing I<br/>\nreally like about Linux is that it has Microsoft worried.  Anything<br/>\nthat kicks a monopoly in the pants has got to be good for something.<br/>\n           - Chris Johnson</div>",
