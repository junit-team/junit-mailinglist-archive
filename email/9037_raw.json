If you have 100\ntests failing on a typical night, something needs to change about the\nprocess!\n\nOur current project has 1040 &quot;regular&quot; JUnit tests that run in about 10\nseconds.  So the developers run all of them all day long after everything\nthey do.  As soon as one of them breaks, we fix it right away.  There are\nanother 200 or so tests that take a little longer (some use Catcus on the\nserver side, some use database connections).  These run automatically when\nanyone checks in (kicked off by Cruise Control) , so within 10 minutes of\nsubmiting code to the repository, you know whether you have broken any of\nthese &quot;integration level&quot; tests.\n\nOnce the norm becomes all of the tests passing (rather than 100 failing),\nthe nature of your problem may change.  This is a much more scalable\napproach than trying to manage/distribute failure reports.\n\nJeff Nielsen\nDigital Focus\n\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &quot;yair fine&quot; &lt;yair_fine@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;junit@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Wednesday, August 06, 2003 5:12 PM\nSubject: [junit] handling test reports\n\n\n&gt; Hi ,\n&gt; I have a general question , and it is more of a design issue.\n&gt;\n&gt; Currently , i am involved in a java project that has 3 people working on.\n&gt; We have somthing around 2000 junit tests running on a nightly build basis\n,using ANT.\n&gt; The nightly build proccess ends with a mail report that has the summery of\nthe tests\n&gt; reports , and has a link to a directory , where all tests reports are\nbundled.\n&gt; I mean , in the mail there is something like :\n&gt; 1900 tests succeed , 100 tests failed ..\n&gt;\n&gt; I also have a small util that can scan these reports and look for a\nspecific string ,\n&gt; like &quot;Page Fault occured&quot; , and add a reference to specific test report\nand line number.\n&gt; That way each developer of the 3 , can look at the mail summery , and\nsearch if there is\n&gt; any problem related to his part of the project.the summery is not too long\nor complicated\n&gt; to look in .\n&gt;\n&gt; This strategy works fine in this quantity of tests and developers.\n&gt; What happens if I want to expand these nightly build tests 10 times more.\n&gt; Now , the project involves 30 developers , divided into sub teams.\n&gt; If i use the currnt format of reporting , i will get very big logs of\n,2000*10 =\n&gt; 20000,tests .And big mail summery that contain information that does not\ninterest every\n&gt; one.\n&gt; rpoblem 1:\n&gt; James , is in sub team A , and he wrote\ncom.company.pkg.testConcernsToJamesOnly\n&gt; and Rachel , is from team B , and she wrote\ncom.company.pkg.testRachelTests\n&gt; James don&#39;t want to see Rachels tests reports or mail summery , he don&#39;t\nwant to get lost\n&gt; in a big amount of data when he looks for his results.\n&gt; is there a way to split outputs , according to packages ?\n&gt; i.e, James&#39;s tests result will be sent to a differnt log file.\n&gt;\n&gt; problem 2:\n&gt; In a week , Rachel is going to be fired ( don&#39;t tell her that...)\n&gt; I want all reports and mail summery that rachel got , will be sent to her\nsuccessor.\n&gt; is there a way to create a connection between users and tests packages?\n&gt; i.e , now com.company.pkg.testRachelTests belong to George (the new guy\nreplacing Rachel)\n&gt; ,\n&gt; and for James too, for two weeks only,\n&gt; and com.company.pkg.testConcernsToJamesOnly still belongs to James\n&gt;\n&gt; I thought of maybe a configuration file that has notification list :\n&gt; _________________________________________\n&gt; James\n&gt; com.company.pkg.testConcernsToJamesOnly\n&gt; com.company.pkg.testRachelTests\n&gt;\n&gt; George\n&gt; com.company.pkg.testRachelTests\n&gt; _________________________________________\n&gt;\n&gt; but how do i implement this .\n&gt; does JUNIT / ANT support stuff like that?\n&gt; this is a real life issue\n&gt; regards\n&gt; Yair\n&gt;\n\n\n\n",
