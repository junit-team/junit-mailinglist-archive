How could we control anything if\n&gt; &gt; programmers felt free to bite the heads of chickens, duck, snakes,\n&gt; &gt; whenever the fancy took them....?&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Never underestimate the ability of management to impede what\n&gt; &gt; developers believe will be progress.\n&gt; \n&gt; Absolutely, Russell. I just want that manager to SAY IT. To me, that&#39;s\n&gt; important. I won&#39;t be complicit in an unspoken scheme to go slower,\n&gt; because at the end of the day, when we don&#39;t go fast enough, the\n&gt; executives will rain on the managers will rain on me. No thanks.\n\nAh, but it&#39;s not the reasonable first level manager who says it. It&#39;s\nthe VP of the organization, who has given up trying to buck the\nstandards officers. And they don&#39;t believe that my procedure will\nhelp, but they are certain that the standard they worked so hard to\nput into place solved a lot of problems for them - and have seen chaos\nensue with programmers spitting out chicken heads all over the\nplace...\n\nLarge organizations tend to lack the immediacy of accountability which\nfacilitates progress.\n \n&gt; PROGRAMMER: &quot;As long as we&#39;re clear that the corporate standard is more\n&gt; important than how productive I can be as a programmer, I&#39;m fine with\n&gt; that. By the way, I won&#39;t be working any unpaid overtime this year.\n&gt; Sorry about that.&quot;\n\nEasier to say when unemployment is low :)\n\n",
