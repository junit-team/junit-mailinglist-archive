The problerm is\n&gt; having to provide the interelationships between the various interfaces to\n&gt; allow the mock to function adequately. In the simple example below I needed\n&gt; to provide a mock IDfSession with enough extra code for it to produce mock\n&gt; IDfGroup and IDfUser objects that could then be resolved against each other\n&gt; in several variations by the business logic. It was a major effort just to\n&gt; get the mocks set up. IIRC the test code was significantly larger than the\n&gt; original class, let alone just the method I was testing.\n\nWhat would have to be true for you to have avoided this extra work? What \nexample were you trying to check? I don&#39;t know Documentum well, but if \nyour business logic operates on User and Group objects, shouldn&#39;t you \njust invoke your business logic passing in User and Group objects? This \nwould remove the need to simulate the Session interface.\n\nI would need to know more to be sure, but I suspect there are \nsimplifications we can apply by looking at the tests a little \ndifferently. If you could share a test (or the essence of it) with us, \nwe might be able to help.\n\n&gt; The fact that calls to Documentum super class methods are intermingled with\n&gt; business logic to a high degree and seperating them would complicate the\n&gt; class inordinately making it less maintainable is also annoying.\n\nI&#39;ll take your word for it, but intermixing business logic with \nintegration logic has, in my experience, never been simpler (easier to \nmaintain) than separating them from each other.\n\n&gt; Having said that I still haven&#39;t given up, I&#39;m just less confident than I\n&gt; was. I also reread the holy books regularly (&quot;Refactoring&quot;, &quot;Working\n&gt; Effectively With Legacy Code&quot;, &quot;JUnit Recipes&quot;, &quot;Design Patterns&quot; and\n&gt; &quot;Refactoring to Patterns&quot;) trying to get ideas :-)\n\nMore eyes usually help....\n\nTake care.\n-- \nJ.
