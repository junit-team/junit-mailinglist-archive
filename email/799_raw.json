Running the app\nwith -classic uses the non-HotSpot JVM.  \n\n&gt; When I ran the IDE debugger, I could then stop on breakpoints properly.\n&gt; (Actually, the problem I had was that I could set a breakpoint and it would\n&gt; stop at the breakpoint, but only once. If the breakpoint was in a loop or\n&gt; function that was called again, it wouldn&#39;t stop the second time through).\n\nAnother symptom of the HotSpot bugs, yes.\n\nAnother possiblity is using another JVM such as IBM&#39;s, but I don&#39;t\nrecommend that if you&#39;re using Linux.
