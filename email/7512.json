Then go ahead and write the tests as needed.  I<br/>\nfaced an issue similar to this on a 1.5 year project -- only we were<br/>\ntold that unit tests were simply not a priority, period.  We, the<br/>\ndevelopers, knew we couldn&#39;t get along without them, so when the project<br/>\nplan was given to us without time alloted for automated tests (of any<br/>\nsort) we simply agreed to it and moved on.  We wrote the tests anyway<br/>\nand delivered ahead of schedule for every milestone/release (with the<br/>\nexception of one milestone when two of the four processors on our server<br/>\nwent nuts).  :p<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I said this may sound deceptive, but at least in our situation it was<br/>\nthe case that the management was not actually opposed to testing, they<br/>\nwere opposed to the thought that it would slow us down.  It made for a<br/>\nrather lively discussion at the end of the project. :p<br/>\n<br/>\n=jason </span></blockquote></div>",
