I never used junit before.\n&gt; Can anybody give \n&gt; me a quick answer to my two sample questions.\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) Can junit can do coverage analysis? How?\n&gt; As my understanding, it should have a parser for\n&gt; java program. and \n&gt; enable to add instrumentation code easily. \n&gt; \n&gt; 2) If junit can not be used to do coverage analysis,\n&gt; do anybody now \n&gt; a good open source tool can do so? \n&gt; \n&gt; Your answer is highly appreciated.\n&gt; \n&gt; Xiaochen\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nThe New Yahoo!
