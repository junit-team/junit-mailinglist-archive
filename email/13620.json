B. Rainsberger<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  &gt; The second question is perhaps more of a comment than a<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; question. I think that when a novice asks us a question, it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; OK for us to provide a simple, dogmatic-sounding answer. This<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; person is learning, and is therefore not well-informed about<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; the consequences of the choices he has in front of him. As a<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; result, we have a responsibility to suggest the course we<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; think is right and ask him to try it so he can learn the way<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; we did. In this case, a little dogma doesn&#39;t hurt.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I hear you, but I still have a fundamental dislike for any kind of absolutes<br/>\n&gt; (and in particular, statements that contain &quot;always&quot; or &quot;never&quot;).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Instead of saying &quot;Never do X&quot;, I much prefer to phrase my response in terms<br/>\n&gt; of &quot;If you do X, here is what you gain, and here are the risks&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have been in this business for long enough that I can confidentially say<br/>\n&gt; that whatever absolute statement you make, I&#39;ll be able to come up with a<br/>\n&gt; counter example :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Absolutely, which is why I&#39;m now in the habit of saying: &quot;Until you <br/>\ndiscover when not to do X, I&#39;d just try doing X as much as possible. Try <br/>\ndoing X all the time for a while and see where the pain is.&quot; so far, so <br/>\ngood.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
