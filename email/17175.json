Look for an abstraction and extract the private methods you want to<br/>\ntest into a separate, testable class. Inspired By Cederics example and<br/>\nrefering to the Java-API, let&#39;s say that you have the private method<br/>\nint compare(Object left, Object right) that compares two objects. That<br/>\ncan be extracted to a comparator with that method as a public<br/>\ninterface (yes I completely stile the examöple from the Java API<br/>\nwhat&#39;s wong with that? :)). An implementation of that interface could<br/>\nbe instantiated and used in the your tested class AND it could and<br/>\nshould be tested in isolation outside of that class.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would look for abstractions first, I have yet to find a situation<br/>\nwhere I need to test private methods with reflection and I very<br/>\nseldomly, if ever need to open up the API in a way that feels<br/>\n&quot;unnatural&quot;. When I do that a better solution usually presents itself<br/>\nlater (so opening up can be a way to keep your flow).<br/>\n<br/>\nI think SRP is one of the most important principles when TDD:ing:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/srp\">http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/srp</a><br/>\n<br/>\nIf something is hard to test the reason is often that SRP has been violated.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my two cents for what they are worth.<br/>\n/J<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;  Back to the original question.  You have two options:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  - You absolutely want to keep that method private, and in this case,<br/>\n&gt;     you should probably invoke it via reflection (see setAccessible(true)).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  - You can relax the visibility of this method, in which case I suggest<br/>\n&gt;     making it package protected and then put your test in the same package (it<br/>\n&gt;     can still be in a separate source folder).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  I recommend the latter approach...<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
