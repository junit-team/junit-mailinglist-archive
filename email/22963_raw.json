For\n&gt; example, although a single lecturer, single c=\r\nlass, and two rooms isn&#39;t\n&gt; enough to test every available case, it&#39;s proba=\r\nbly enough to feed to a\n&gt; simple room-assignment test, etc.\n&gt;\n&gt; In this cas=\r\ne, if I find myself making the same chain of calls over and\n&gt; over, I somet=\r\nimes write convenient factory methods in my test class,\n&gt; so my tests can l=\r\nook like:\n&gt;\n&gt; @Test public void scheduleRoom() {\n&gt; Scenario s =3D scenario(=\r\nlecturer(&quot;Smith&quot;),\n&gt; schoolClass(&quot;Algebra: requires 50 seats&quot;),\n&gt; rooms(&quot;Sm=\r\nith Hall 100: 50 seats&quot;, &quot;Smith Hall\n&gt; 102: 20 seats&quot;))\n&gt; assertEquals(&quot;Smi=\r\nth Hall 102&quot;, s.getAssignments().getRoom(&quot;Algebra&quot;))\n&gt; }\n&gt;\n&gt; Good luck,\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n David Saff\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Hey David, this looks interesting. I thought about capsul=\r\nating\n&gt; initilization, too. How is=A0 the Scenario class annotated? Is it a=\r\n normal\n&gt; java class with normal methods or does it store @Test methods, to=\r\no?\n\nIt&#39;s just a plain old Java class that you write for yourself with the\nc=\r\nonvenience methods you need.\n\n&gt; I had the feeling it is wrong to call exter=\r\nnal methods, not concerning the\n&gt; test case, or that it would violate a tes=\r\nt paradigm.\n\nYes and no.  In general, I&#39;ve seen bad things happen if my tes=\r\nts call\nexternal methods that are designed for other purposes, but _happen_=\r\n to\ngive me the data or behavior I need to set up the method I really want\n=\r\nto test.  They tend to get changed later, to suit their intended\npurposes, =\r\nleaving the tests broken and sad.\n\nHowever, if the &quot;external&quot; method in que=\r\nstion is something you write\nfor yourself, to kill what would otherwise be =\r\nduplicated between the\ntests, or stuffed into a setUp method, I&#39;ve seen few=\r\n pitfalls.\n\n&gt; What about data-driven testing, for instance linking a csv fi=\r\nles? Though\n&gt; your approach seems more generic.\n\nSome people seem to get a =\r\nlot of mileage out of this, but it seems\nthat the payoffs come when for som=\r\ne reason, CSV files are easier to\nedit or understand than data right there =\r\nin the code.  I&#39;ve heard\nthree reasons for this:\n\n1) The people writing the=\r\n tests are different than the developers.\n(Fair enough, but JUnit&#39;s a celeb=\r\nration of developers testing their\nown code)\n2) Data files are easier to ch=\r\nange than code.  (I rarely find myself\nwanting to add a bunch of tests with=\r\nout changing _something_ about the\ntest code or the code being tested, so t=\r\nhis is an imaginary benefit\nfor me.)\n3) The code required to set up the dat=\r\na is convoluted (I consider that\na challenge to make the code simpler).\n\n&gt; =\r\nAnother user suggested me TestNG with test dependencies and DataProvider.\n&gt;=\r\n What about that?\n\nI consider trying to apply a generic data-parser to issu=\r\nes in test\nabstraction to be replacing one problem with two.  Others have t=\r\naken\ndifferent views.\n\n   David Saff\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Best regards :)\n&gt;\n&gt; Konrad\n&gt;\n\n",
