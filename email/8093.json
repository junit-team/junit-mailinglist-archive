It doesn&#39;t help with<br/>\nperformance tests.  For that you want to be able to create a test that<br/>\nasserts that a specific operation does not take longer than a<br/>\nparticular amount of time.  This is for cases where a certain level of<br/>\nperformance is a requirement.  By having a test for it you a) know<br/>\nwhen your optimization has been successfull and so avoid unnecessary<br/>\noptimization, and b) know when things slow down for some reason.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Being new at JUnit, the timing tests are what alerted me to the fact<br/>\n&gt; that JUnit reloads stuff before each test (something I didn&#39;t know <br/>\n&gt; before I found the ANT task.)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, that&#39;s critical to understand for a variety of reasons.  A new<br/>\ninstance of your TestCase is created for every test method that is<br/>\nrun, setup called, the test method called, and teardown called. <br/>\nThat&#39;s the key to keeping them isolated and independant.<br/>\n <br/>\nDave</div>",
