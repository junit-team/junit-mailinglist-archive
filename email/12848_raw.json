I develop primarily on a\nMac.  For the most part JUnit works great on the Mac but I have an\nissue that I need to solve before I can move ahead.  This issue is the\nissue of classpath.  Exactly what elements of a JUnit test need on the\nclasspath?  I know that the junit.jar file must be visible to the\njavac program.  On my Mac I have placed the junit.jar file in my\n/Libray/Java/Extensions folder.  That seems to work with the swingui\nmodule very well but when I try to run a test in textui  get an error\nmessage back saying that myFileTest can&#39;t be found.  Does the test I\nam running need to be on my classpath as well?  I am executing tests\nfrom the command line while I am in in the current directory where the\ntest and files to be tested live. swingui works well.  textui gives me\nerrors.  Why, if swingui works well, textui fails?  They seem to be\ncoming from the same folder and .jar file.  \n\nI am also trying to install JUnit on a PC and I am having similar\nproblems.\n\nAnybody got any ideas?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
