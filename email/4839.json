I&#39;m sure that everyone will correct me if <br/>\nI&#39;m wrong, but a white-box test uses knowledge about the implementation of a <br/>\nthing to test the thing. A black-box test only uses observable behavior to test <br/>\nthe thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nTherefore,<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I test a template method by asserting that it calls four methods in a <br/>\ncertain sequence, that&#39;s a white-box test.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I merely assert that foo(3) answers 6 and foo(4) answers 12, that&#39;s a black-<br/>\nbox test.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood test suites are composed of black-box tests at the appropriate levels. <br/>\nThese test suites are more refactoring-friendly. White-box tests have a <br/>\ntendency to get in the way when the production code has to change.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;m particularly confused about the following example:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Let&#39;s say that I&#39;m testing some code that exercises a database.  So i<br/>\n&gt; create<br/>\n&gt; a MockStatement and say &quot;ms.setExpectedUpdateCalls(3)&quot;, or something to<br/>\n&gt; that<br/>\n&gt; effect, and pass it in to my object.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In my view, this is tantamount to designing a &quot;probe&quot; which will fit<br/>\n&gt; through<br/>\n&gt; one of the holes in the box (ie conforms to the public interface),<br/>\n&gt; thereby<br/>\n&gt; allowing us to snoop on what is happening inside the box.... Now, maybe<br/>\n&gt; i&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; just misunderstanding the terminology, but my gut tells me that this<br/>\n&gt; should<br/>\n&gt; not count as &quot;black box&quot; testing.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I see this particular case as a low-cost substitute for a black-box test. The <br/>\nblack-box test would probably check that the updates happened as expected in <br/>\nthe database. By doing so, the test does not worry about how that happens. In <br/>\nthe example you provide, the tester asserts instead that the code tries to <br/>\nupdate three tables. The assumption is that they&#39;re the right three tables, I <br/>\nguess. This test assumes that SQL interface to the database works as expected, <br/>\nsince there&#39;s no point in testing the database.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs this a white-box or a black-box test? I guess it&#39;s white-box, because it <br/>\nassumes that the production code needs to perform three SQL updates, which is <br/>\nan assumption about the implementation.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, of course, since we&#39;re only testing through the public interface, it&#39;s <br/>\nblack-box testing by definition: &quot;Tests that only use observable behavior.&quot; The <br/>\npublic interface *is* the observable behavior. (Well, not exactly, but it&#39;s <br/>\nless wordy than the exact facts.)<br/>\n<br/>\nJUnit is probably best used for black-box testing, but we&#39;re all pragmatic <br/>\nhere: sometimes a white-box test is the way to go. JUnit lets you do both.<br/>\n<br/>\nJ. B.
