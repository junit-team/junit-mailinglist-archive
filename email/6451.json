Just because we do not write<br/>\n&gt;&gt;novel-length, in-depth answers to your question does not mean that <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; we<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt;are evading anything.

Someone saying they&#39;re too <br/>\nbusy to write an article right now is perfectly good reason - no-one <br/>\nhere has to answer your questions in your timeframe. Yet, I haven&#39;t <br/>\nseen any explanation as to what is inferior in your approach - <br/>\nasserting it&#39;s inferior does not make it so. I also found the waving <br/>\nof the moderator stick distasteful; it&#39;s far too early for that.<br/>\n<br/>\nA suggestion - stop posting for 24 hours on this thread, then come <br/>\nback to it.<br/>\n<br/>\nBill de hÓra</div>",
