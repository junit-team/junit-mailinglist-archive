Since some people see benefit in thinking about frameworks \nsimilar to JUnit in terms of behavior, and not testing, perhaps there is \na benefit in cognitive flexibility to leaving the annotation @Before \ninstead of @BeforeTest.  @BeforeTest is somewhat &quot;hardcoding the \nmetaphor&quot;.  However, since I&#39;m still contrigued about behavior-driven \ndevelopment, this is just a whimsical thought.\n\n&gt; Do you mean that constraints &#39;double the amount of work for each\n&gt; implementing class&#39; because you have to implement two methods instead of\n&gt; one? If so, I don&#39;t think that this is much of a problem since you won&#39;t\n&gt; write new constraints too often - their power comes from their ability \n&gt; to be\n&gt; combined after all.\n\nI also feel that the power comes from expressiveness.  For example, this \nreal example from a test I wrote looks like what I want to test is the \nsummaryString() method:\n\nassertThat(states.summaryString(), eq(&quot;GREEN 0.0 GREEN 0.5 RED 1.0&quot;));\n\nBut it&#39;s really just using summaryString as a testing utility.  I&#39;d be \ntempted to write this instead, which feels clearer:\n\nassertThat(states, summarizeTo(&quot;GREEN 0.0 GREEN 0.5 RED 1.0&quot;))\n\nBut the number of lines of code that would have to go into summarizeTo \nmakes me unsure this is a good idea.  Hmm... unless I used reflection:\n\nConstraint summarizeTo(String summary) {\n    return applyTo(eq(summary), callMethod(&quot;summaryString&quot;));\n}\n\nThat might be promising.  Not sure it&#39;s a win in expressiveness.  It&#39;s \nbeginning to look really lispy.\n\n    David Saff\n\n",
