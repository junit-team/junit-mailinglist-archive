I&#39;m writing a new test<br/>\n&gt; runner called Jumi <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://jumi.fi/\">http://jumi.fi/</a> which will have native support for<br/>\n&gt; running tests in parallel in the same JVM, and it take care of capturing<br/>\n&gt; the System.out/err of individual tests.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Jumi will do the output capturing by replacing System.out/err with its<br/>\n&gt; own implementation, which saves all print events (the same way it saves<br/>\n&gt; test lifecycle events), synchronizes both out and err (I think all<br/>\n&gt; current IDEs and build tools fail this:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/orfjackal/misc-tools/blob/master/src/test/java/net/orfjackal/bugs/SystemOutErrBugTest.java)\">https://github.com/orfjackal/misc-tools/blob/master/src/test/java/net/orfjackal/bugs/SystemOutErrBugTest.java)</a>,<br/>\n&gt; and also takes care of capturing the output of threads spawned by the<br/>\n&gt; test thread. For long-lived threads, such as AWT event dispatch thread,<br/>\n&gt; I will also try to figure out something (I&#39;ll timestamp all print<br/>\n&gt; events, so it should be possible to figure out roughly which test<br/>\n&gt; printed things in the AWT thread).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The output capturing is at the top of my TODO list, so I will have it<br/>\n&gt; implemented after a couple of productive afternoons when I have time to<br/>\n&gt; work on it. Soon after that I&#39;ll make the first alpha release.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve looked a bit at how to integrate Jumi with maven-surefire. Jumi and<br/>\n&gt; Surefire have some overlap, for example both of them take care of<br/>\n&gt; classloading and starting a JVM process. One option is to use Surefire&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; classloading and use only the core runner parts of Jumi. Otherwise Jumi<br/>\n&gt; would need information that what are the dependency JARs, what are the<br/>\n&gt; current project&#39;s classes, maybe also that which of them are test and<br/>\n&gt; production classes (Jumi will do caching of the dependencies&#39; class<br/>\n&gt; loaders to speed up the tests). That would require changes to Surefire,<br/>\n&gt; or then a completely new Maven plugin.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kristian@...\">kristian@...</a> wrote on 4.1.2012 8:51:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sorry, I was doing just what I sometimes dislike of our own users ;)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The real problem I want to solve is associating console output from a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; running thread to a given test-case (for parallel runs).
