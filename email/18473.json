The primary win is that the thing you&#39;re <br/>\n&gt; trying to assert is separated from the act of asserting, so <br/>\n&gt; that you can write:<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, I&#39;ve been experimenting with the use of Constraints in Asserts<br/>\nin a different environment - my NUnitLite project - and I see<br/>\nthat there are two reasons to do it.<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Putting the thing you want to assert into a separate object<br/>\nenables all kinds of reuse and extensibility and makes the <br/>\ncode within the framework much simpler and clearer.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) The &quot;literate&quot; aspect is that the end user can write much<br/>\nmore readable asserts. That part is a matter of taste, however,<br/>\nand it&#39;s very easy to build more a traditional interface on top<br/>\nof constraints - the reverse is harder, I found.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s one of my favorite NUnitLite-style tests... It&#39;s C#,<br/>\nof course, but trivial to implement in Java too...<br/>\n<br/>\n   Assert.That( arrayOfDoubles, Is.All.GreaterThan( 0.0 ) );<br/>\n<br/>\nCharlie<br/>\n<br/>\nCharlie</div>",
