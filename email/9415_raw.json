So if you don&#39;t intend for your class to be extended \nthen\n&gt; it should be declared to be final, have all the constructors \nprivate, or\n&gt; public constructors with final methods.  \n&gt; \n\nOn the one hand I like things to be as private and final\nas they can be. This means I don&#39;t have to search the\nwhole project for unexpected overrides and references\nin order to understand something. (This tends\nto be more a problem with inherited legacy code though).\n\nOn the other hand final makes the declaration a little bit\nmore cluttered so I don&#39;t always use it where I could. I\ndon&#39;t worry about restricting extendability since I can\nalways change it later\n\nThe original message about mocking final classes or\nmethods referred to the need to mock a class that you\ncannot modify yourself. If I needed to mock a class\nunder my own control, I would probably introduce an\ninterface instead.\n\n- Neil\n\n\n\n",
