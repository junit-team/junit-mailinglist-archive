These tests, written\n&gt;with HTTPUnit, are getting painful.\n\nPaul, that does sound painful.\n\nMy experience:  I like to just test some core functionality over http to \nmake sure nothing major has been broken on a page.  I&#39;m taking about tests \nsuch as making sure a user can login or making sure a user can&#39;t reach a \ncertain page unless they login, or aspects of any complicated registration \nsystem... those kinds of things.  I&#39;ve never considered testing to make \nsure links work or the title of the page is just so.  Designers redesign, \nand marketing like to change wording... and they should be able to do that \nwithout me changing my tests.  That&#39;s my feeling.\n\nRegarding the cost of these tests: how bad is it if the page title is \nwrong?  Is it worth N developer days?  These are questions for you/your \nmanagement to ponder.  For me, it&#39;s bad if, say, the login logic doesn&#39;t \nwork: that&#39;s worth testing.   A page title error isn&#39;t the end of the \nworld.  But of course, your situation may be very different.\n\nStill...if you have a lot of dynamic text which needs to be checked (maybe \ncoming from a struts resource file, resource bundle, or similar) then \nperhaps you can make those tests less-painful by working out a way to test \nthem without making http request (i.e., move them into classes somehow).\n\nStupid thought for the day: if you&#39;re trying to &quot;lock down&quot; some pages, \ncould you do something quick and dumb like compute a hash value/checksum \nfor the whole HTML page and test against that value? :-)\n\nRegards\nRichard\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
