    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1856310654\">Anna,<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  &gt; If the app class has a non-private constructor, then your tests don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; need to instantiate it as a singleton, right? And you also modifed the<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; app class so that you can suppress the loading of the UI modules. What,<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; then, is impossible about having some tests instantiate the app without<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; the UI bits, and other tests that do?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Nothing at all - that&#39;s exactly how it works right now. It only bugs<br/>\n&gt; me that I need to be extremely cautious about eg. closing documents<br/>\n&gt; opened by the tested application - otherwise they don&#39;t get &quot;killed&quot;<br/>\n&gt; once the test is over, as everything is kept track of by the static,<br/>\n&gt; everlasting instance, and might lead to unexpected interference.<br/>\n&gt; That&#39;s why I wondered if what I do still comprises to the separateness<br/>\n&gt; principle - but as I see nobody raises a protest.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You could implement your setUp() and tearDown() to get the singleton <br/>\ninstance back into as clean a state as possible.</div>",
