I imagine that you could probably write \nsomething to do this yourself as quickly as extracting the interesting \nparts from my code.\n\nCan you give a few details about what you would be looking for in a \ntrend analysis?  Thanks,\n\n    David Saff\n\nkp.berg wrote:\n\n&gt; Hi all,\n&gt;\n&gt; I know, JUnit &#39;unit&#39; tests should always pass ;-) But we are using the\n&gt; JUnit framework to write integration and systemtests as well. So from\n&gt; time to time, in this area something may go wrong. Therefore I&#39;m\n&gt; looking for a tool, that generates a report showing only the\n&gt; differences between current and last JUnit report - which failing\n&gt; tests were fixed, which tests stopped to pass, which tests were added\n&gt; and which removed. Additionaly a test trend analysis should be\n&gt; possible.\n&gt;\n&gt; I know, parsing the XML junitreport output and generating the info,\n&gt; e.g., with the help of a database, would be possible. But is anyone\n&gt; aware of an existing tool or open source project that can help in this\n&gt; direction?\n&gt;\n&gt; --Klaus\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; YAHOO!
