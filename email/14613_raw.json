It&#39;s not\nintegrated with Eclipse, but it works well and\nis free=\r\n.  I haven&#39;t really found great need to\nintegrate my coverage tool with my =\r\nIDE, because\nof the way I use it.  I&#39;m usually interested in\nrunning a whol=\r\ne bunch of tests and then seeing\nhow my coverage looks for the whole suite.=\r\n  Then,\nI drill down, notice I missed some methods or\nclasses or whatever, =\r\nand then go write tests for\nthose.  Maybe I&#39;m not using coverage analysis t=\r\no\nits full benefit, but I don&#39;t really do coverage\nin small iterations (unl=\r\nike TDD with JUnit).\n\n\nTodd.\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: junit@ya=\r\nhoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On \n&gt; Behalf Of Thomas L Roche=\r\n\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, September 01, 2005 6:28 PM\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;=\r\n Subject: [junit] [OT] coverage plugins for eclipse?\n&gt; \n&gt; Apologies if this=\r\n is OT, but IMHO coverage measurement (for \n&gt; guiding one&#39;s test writing) a=\r\nnd IDEs (for writing and running \n&gt; one&#39;s tests) are both at least tangenti=\r\nally related to JUnit \n&gt; ... and I don&#39;t know of a good list for coverage m=\r\neasurement :-(\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m wondering, what are folks who use Eclipse (or Eclip=\r\nse-based\n&gt; products) using to do coverage measurement and reporting? One \n&gt;=\r\n option is to just run the coverage tool from the command line \n&gt; or ant, b=\r\nut I&#39;d really like something more integrated, e.g.\n&gt; \n&gt; 0 a run config that=\r\n would Run&gt;{JUnit, JUnit Plug-in Test} under the\n&gt;   coverage tool and disp=\r\nlay results in a view\n&gt; \n&gt; 1 mark un/covered sources in Outline view or edi=\r\ntors\n&gt; \n&gt; The coverage plugins of which I&#39;m aware are\n&gt; \n&gt; * Clover\n&gt; \n&gt; * =\r\njcoverage\n&gt; \n&gt; * Rational Developer (Unfortunately its coverage tools are p=\r\nart of its\n&gt;   performance-testing tools, which complicates installation an=\r\nd use\n&gt;   for &quot;normal&quot; testing.)\n&gt; \n&gt; Are there others?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --------=\r\n---------------- Yahoo!
