But first you have to decide which aspect(s) of the gui<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; you want to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; test. For many people, making the gui so stupid that it can&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; possibly break<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; That is in fact the way I do it. But one problem I had was <br/>\n&gt; that my model<br/>\n&gt; &gt; worked alright,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; but when the GUI components attached themselves as <br/>\n&gt; listeners, some things<br/>\n&gt; &gt; didn&#39;t work anymore...<br/>\n&gt; &gt; (Such as the collection of listeners being modified during <br/>\n&gt; iteration to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; update the listeners)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Can you state the problem in a few lines of code?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>The problem is solved, but I gave it just as an example of what can go<br/>\nwrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut to elaborate a bit (situation simplified to the bare essentials): <br/>\na ContainerObject is created and added to a set, which triggers an event of<br/>\ntype &quot;object added&quot; starting from a top level object of type Design. <br/>\nThe Gui detects that and creates a ContainerObjectView instance on the<br/>\nContainerObject and then registers that view as a listener to the Design<br/>\ninstance. The java.util.Set of listeners has an object added (the<br/>\nContainerObjectView instance) while there is still an java.util.Iterator in<br/>\nuse over the Design&#39;s listeners, which causes a<br/>\nConcurrentModificationException.<br/>\nThe tricky bit is that this will never happen when the Gui is not attached<br/>\nas a listener to the Design.<br/>\nThe solution is to clone the Set or to use toArray(), and iterating over the<br/>\ncopy instead.</div>",
