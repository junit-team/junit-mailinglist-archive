You have to be certain the cost is worth the pay off :) Yet,\nespecially with user acceptance testing, I have to side with going with a\nnew framework, if simply for the reason that the client should be able to\nread them.\n\n2008/9/3 kentb &lt;kentb@...&gt;\n\n&gt;   Jan,\n&gt;\n&gt; You can use JUnit for longer-running tests, but there are some assumptions\n&gt; JUnit embodies that will cause some problems. JUnit assumes tests are\n&gt; atomic--they run or don&#39;t run, they run in unit time. Integration tests\n&gt; often take a long time to run, so interim feedback is valuable. Integration\n&gt; tests can usefully have multiple failures, where that is less common with\n&gt; unit tests. OTOH, tests are tests--independent self-checking bits of code\n&gt; that run and get reported--and for that part of running integration tests\n&gt; JUnit works fine.\n&gt;\n&gt; It seems to me to be a tradeoff between the simplicity of running all tests\n&gt; as JUnit tests and the challenges of getting the integration tests to run\n&gt; as\n&gt; JUnit tests. Different contexts will requires different solutions. If I had\n&gt; a few integration tests, I&#39;d make them work with JUnit. If I had a large\n&gt; suite of integration tests that played a prominent role in development, I\n&gt; would use some other tool and integrate my unit testing results with the\n&gt; integration results.\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt;\n&gt; Kent Beck\n&gt; Three Rivers Institute\n&gt;\n&gt; _____\n&gt;\n&gt; From: junit@yahoogroups.com &lt;junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt; [mailto:\n&gt; junit@yahoogroups.com &lt;junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt;] On Behalf Of Jan\n&gt; Kroeze\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, September 02, 2008 1:05 AM\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com &lt;junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [junit] JUnit And Larger Scale Tests\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi all!\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m a bit of a newb to the whole TDD thing, but I understand that unit\n&gt; tests\n&gt; are supposed to be blazingly fast and not access the hard drive, network,\n&gt; database or anything external to the code itself. To this end, I understand\n&gt; that a framework such as jMock can be used.\n&gt;\n&gt; So far, so good. But I find JUnit to be extremely useful for writing\n&gt; integration, system and user acceptance tests as well.\n&gt;\n&gt; Here&#39;s my question: what is the official position of the JUnit community on\n&gt; using JUnit to do larger scale tests? Is there a better framework, or is it\n&gt; common practice to use JUnit for these tests as well?\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt; Jan Kroeze\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n\n-- \nJan Kroeze\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
