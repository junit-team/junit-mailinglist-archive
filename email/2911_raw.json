Do you want to make\nsure that the window comes up? That functionality belongs to the application\nserver and to the browser and probably doesn&#39;t need to be tested again. If\nyou want to test the javascript in the page then you&#39;ll want to use JsUnit\n(http://www.edwardh.com/jsunit/) but this won&#39;t let you test functions that\nopen windows very easily. One approach, if you can do a little refactoring,\nis to write a wrapper function around window.open(...). Something like\nlaunchWindow(url). Then you can stub out that function in your unit tests so\nthat a window will not actually be opened. This will let you test the logic\nin the calling function only and to verify that the correct url was passed\nto the launchWindow function... If you want to test the javascript in\nmultiple pages then you can write a TestSuite for JsUnit.\n\tI have yet to find an integrated system for testing javascript in\nconjunction with serverside code -- I don&#39;t think one exists short of going\nto a functional testing approach like WinRunner or the likes.\n\nChris\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Daniel Reynes [mailto:daniel.reynes@...]\nSent: Wednesday, October 10, 2001 11:22 PM\nTo: Junit\nSubject: [junit] Multi windows\n\n\nI have to test a Web application which, after a login and password window\ncontinues on a new window (with window.open....)\nHow can I continue the test on this new window by taking the corresponding\nrequest or something like that ?\n \nThank&#39;s\n \nDan \n\nYahoo!
