I&#39;m actually using Alex Ruiz&#39;s FEST for our testing and it works quite well on Windows. With or without FEST on the Mac, I can&#39;t seem to get any UI tests to run. The initial frame/window comes up in some cases but I can&#39;t do much more than that. When running JUnit tests (again with or without FEST), I don&#39;t even see the frame.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve gone through what docs there are for FEST and have read the blog/article but I can&#39;t figure it out.\n\n\nI&#39;ve used FEST to test Swing code on a toy project:\nhttps://github.com/dhemery/towers.dead\n\nLater I restarted the project and used WindowLicker instead:\nhttps://github.com/dhemery/Towers\n\nIt&#39;s been a while since I visited either project, but I think the (few) UI tests run. Neither version of the code does much, so there aren&#39;t many UI tests. The older one (which uses FEST) has more features and tests.\n\nI wrote all of this code on Macs running Snow Leopard and Eclipse Ganymede. I haven&#39;t tried it on Lion or Helios.\n\nDale\n\n--\nDale Emery\nConsultant to software teams and leaders\nhttp://dhemery.com\n\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
