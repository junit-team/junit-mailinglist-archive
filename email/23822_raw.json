I basically need to integ=\r\nrate both Junit and Nunit test cases in a common platform.\n\nElse will put i=\r\nt in this way. There are few test cases which are in TestNG and few with Nu=\r\nnit. What all the possible ways from which i can call and execute all the u=\r\nnit tests? There shouldn&#39;t be to runs. On a single run both cases should pr=\r\noduce test results.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, Matt=\r\nhew Farwell &lt;matthew@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Salut,\n&gt; \n&gt; You can probably use jenki=\r\nns for this, although I haven&#39;t done it myself.
