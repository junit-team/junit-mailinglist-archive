    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2130250745\">Hi Debio,<br/>\nThere are several ways of grouping your tests, including using suites.<br/>\nHowever, the simplest way if you&#39;re using Eclipse seems to be like this:<br/>\n1. Have one folder in your project called &quot;src&quot; for your source code.<br/>\n2. Have another folder (a sibling of &quot;src&quot;) called &quot;junit&quot; or &quot;test&quot; or<br/>\nsomething like that. Nowadays I am calling mine &quot;junit&quot; because I&#39;ve ended<br/>\nup with a variety of types of test code in my projects.<br/>\n3. Under the &quot;junit&quot; folder organize your packages the same way as you would<br/>\nunder &quot;src&quot;, and keep your test classes and all other related classes here<br/>\n(such as mock classes).<br/>\n4 In Eclipse, set up a new run configuration that runs all tests in the<br/>\n&quot;junit&quot; folder. This will allow you to execute all tests in your project. If<br/>\nyou want to run all the classes in a specific package, you can setup run<br/>\nconfigurations to do that also.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the Yahoo Groups things - I thought that at first too. But if you go<br/>\nback into the group there will be a link to Edit Membership, where you can<br/>\nadd a new email address and switch where mail is sent to for this group.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck!<br/>\n-Dennis<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Sat, Jul 3, 2010 at 10:35 AM, debio264 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:debio264@...\">debio264@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; After Googling instead of going through articles here, I found<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.devx.com/Java/Article/31983/0/page/3\">http://www.devx.com/Java/Article/31983/0/page/3</a><br/>\n&gt; It looks like I should be using @RunWith(Suite.class) and<br/>\n&gt; @SuiteClasses({1.class,2.class}). This isn&#39;t documented in any of the guides<br/>\n&gt; I found in the articles section of the JUnit site.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Also, this may just be me whining, but... Yahoo Groups seems like a poor<br/>\n&gt; place for a project like this. I had to register a Yahoo account to join the<br/>\n&gt; group, which wouldn&#39;t normally bother me, except that Yahoo forces me to use<br/>\n&gt; their mail system to get updates (apparently I have to pay to get the option<br/>\n&gt; to forward my mail elsewhere). Sourceforge gives you the option to get a<br/>\n&gt; real mailing list that requires no website account at all.<br/>\n&gt; Again, I may just be a lazy whiner, but I found it frustrating.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>",
