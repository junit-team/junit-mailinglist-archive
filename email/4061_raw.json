Also, with\n&gt; &gt; equals() method I \n&gt; &gt; cannot know which data member in the class actually\n&gt; &gt; caused a mis-\n&gt; &gt; match, since I assert only at the class level.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; This is why I am thinking what to do... hope this\n&gt; &gt; clarifies the \n&gt; &gt; problem. Any suggestions would be appreciated.\n&gt; &gt; Thanks again for your \n&gt; &gt; help so far.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; - krishnan\n&gt; \n&gt; Well, you could have the helper keep a list of the\n&gt; problems that equals() encountered.  Then you could\n&gt; ask it what the problem was.  Example (java) of code\n&gt; for your test case:\n&gt; \n&gt; if (!helper.equals(testObject)) {\n&gt; \n&gt;    fail(helper.equalFailureMessage());\n&gt; }\n&gt; \n&gt; Then you could make the helper equals() check each\n&gt; item and keep a list of errors.\n&gt; \n&gt; Or something like that.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Eric\n&gt; \n&gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; Send FREE Valentine eCards with Yahoo!
