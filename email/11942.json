One that we have been kicking around here in the<br/>\n&gt; office this week as well. We have been using the term &quot;syntactically<br/>\n&gt; correct&quot; to indicate a document that would pass some kind of XML<br/>\n&gt; validation. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hm... you may prefer to use standard terminology.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;well-formed XML&quot; meaning all the tags open and close properly, and so on.<br/>\n&quot;DTD/XML schema conformant&quot; meaning that the document conforms to a <br/>\nDTD/XML schema.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe last thing we need as a community is more redundant terminology! :)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo you mean DTD conformant documents.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt; However this does not mean the document makes sense in a<br/>\n&gt; browser - perhaps there are CSS mistakes or JavaScript mistakes, or<br/>\n&gt; basic HTML mistakes. If a document does make sense in a browser, we have<br/>\n&gt; been calling it &quot;semantically correct&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, if the document conforms to an HTML-based DTD, then certainly a <br/>\nbrowser will understand it, except possibly for JavaScript errors.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; These are probably not the best use of the terms &quot;syntax&quot; and<br/>\n&gt; &quot;semantics&quot; but it seems to convey the intended difference.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Indeed.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Automating the process of testing if a page is syntactically correct<br/>\n&gt; seems to be reasonably easy through the use of an XML parser.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Checking for conformance is very easy, yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The semantic checking is a much more interesting problem. Validating<br/>\n&gt; CSS, or JavaScript is probably doable. But in my experience the biggest<br/>\n&gt; problem in testing a web application is the variety of browsers and OSs<br/>\n&gt; that are out there and attempting to cover even a small set of these in<br/>\n&gt; QA is resource intensive. Small differences in rendering that need to be<br/>\n&gt; tweaked with custom CSS, or certain tags that a browser docent support,<br/>\n&gt; or keywords that mean something in one browser and not another.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Browser compatibility testing takes work. HtmlUnit tries to do some of <br/>\nthis, by allowing you to set the HTTP client to mimic various browsers. <br/>\nIt does a good job, but could always go further. (Wanna help?)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Anyone have any tools they use for this task? Are there any tools? Is it<br/>\n&gt; even reasonable to think that automation for this type of testing is<br/>\n&gt; possible?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It&#39;s possible, but it may not be worth it. Automate the easy stuff, then <br/>\nleave the compatibility testing to manual testers, at least until they <br/>\nnotice patterns in their testing you could automate.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ.
