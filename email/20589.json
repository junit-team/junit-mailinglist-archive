I understand<br/>\nthat&#39;s partly what Kent is referring to in his note:<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Next up, release notes and then out the door!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAnything informal at this stage? Is it just around the corner such that<br/>\nI should sit tight?<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s the case we&#39;re interested in. We would like introduce a<br/>\nfunctional-test build on our integration server. Something we could run<br/>\non a regular basis, but not as part of the integration build. The<br/>\ncurrent thinking call for introduction of a custom Runner that<br/>\nidentifies functional test based on a custom annotation. Then we can<br/>\nco-mingle unit and functional tests, not relying on directory<br/>\nsegregation. Does 4.5 have any useful features for this problem? At a<br/>\nminimum I&#39;ve picked up that writing a custom Runner will be easier...<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nPeter Pascale<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAll,<br/>\n<br/>\nFollowing our discussions last week, we have incorporated the old<br/>\nJUnit4ClassRunner into 4.5. (The new runner is called<br/>\nBlockJUnit4ClassRunner<br/>\nbecause it is organized as a &quot;block&quot; of &quot;statements&quot; instead of nested<br/>\nprocedures). Those of you who have written custom runners, we&#39;d<br/>\nappreciate<br/>\nit if you could try out the release candidate to make sure it supports<br/>\nyour<br/>\nexisting runners.<br/>\n<br/>\nNext up, release notes and then out the door!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhew!<br/>\n<br/>\nKent Beck<br/>\nThree Rivers Institute<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**************************************************************************** <br/>\nThis email may contain material confidential to<br/>\nPearson.
