Good questions.<br/>\n<br/>\nmherrmann_at wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;m sorry for repeating myself but I fear that my last message<br/>\n&gt; (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/junit/message/15268)\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/junit/message/15268)</a> <br/>\n&gt; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/junit/message/15268%29\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/junit/message/15268%29</a>&gt; might have been<br/>\n&gt; overlooked.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What do the people who haven&#39;t yet responded think about<br/>\n&gt; @Before/@BeforeClass vs. @BeforeTest/@BeforeSuite? Please, give us<br/>\n&gt; your comments. Nothing will happen if you don&#39;t speak your mind!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There&#39;s an interesting, whimsical point in favor of @Before that I&#39;ll <br/>\nbring up in a future post.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; What is the overall opinion about Joe Walnes&#39; aproach to flexible<br/>\n&gt; JUnit assertions using assertThat? <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It&#39;s great.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Do you think it is better or worse<br/>\n&gt; than the current assertions? <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I use both together.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I would like to have it included in the<br/>\n&gt; new release, would you too? David, why do you think using constraints<br/>\n&gt; is heavy weight?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Constraint in JMock has two abstract methods: eval and describeTo.  <br/>\nDescribe is really cool, because it allows, basically for free, error <br/>\nmessages like:<br/>\n<br/>\njunit.framework.AssertionFailedError:<br/>\nExpected: not (eq(&lt;a bad sentence&gt;) or a string containing &quot;a bad word&quot;)<br/>\nbut got : This is a bad word<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, it can double the amount of work for each <br/>\nimplementing class.  I&#39;m still split on whether this is worth it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is actually a lot different than saying &quot;Constraints are heavy <br/>\nweight&quot;.  It may be the same thing as saying &quot;it&#39;s not yet quite clear <br/>\nwhat the perfect definition of assertThat is&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; And why<br/>\n&gt; 1) does junit.framework.Assert still define assertEquals for<br/>\n&gt; boolean, int, long etc. (autoboxing could do that; in fact, deleting<br/>\n&gt; those methods doesn&#39;t produce any errors)?<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; 2) isn&#39;t java.lang.AssertionError used instead of<br/>\n&gt; junit.framework.AssertionFailedError?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>junit.framework.Assert is there for backward compatibility.  For <br/>\norg.junit.Assert, #2 is already true, and #1 is interesting...<br/>\n<br/>\n    David Saff</div>",
