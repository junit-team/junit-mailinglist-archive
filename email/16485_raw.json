I do \n&gt; \n&gt; know that it&#39;s possible to include JUnit tas=\r\nks in Ant&#39;s build.xml, \nbut\n&gt; I&#39;m looking for a way \n&gt; \n&gt; to make JUnit tes=\r\nts mandatory for every piece of code that&#39;s written\n&gt; and commited to our \n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; CVS. Is there a way to control uploads to CVS regarding JUnit?\n&gt; \n&gt; An=\r\nother info I&#39;d like to have: is there a way to decide dynamically\n&gt; which t=\r\nests Ant has to \n&gt; \n&gt; run (like running tests only for changed parts of sou=\r\nrce code, for\n&gt; example)? I do know that \n&gt; \n&gt; it is common to run all the =\r\ntests all the time, I&#39;d just like to get\n&gt; to know all the \n&gt; \n&gt; possibilit=\r\nies Ant offers when it comes to JUnit.\n&gt;\n\nYou could use the CruiseControl t=\r\nool for automating your build \nprocess. You can tell it to run the build ev=\r\nery time that something \nis checked into CVS. I would recommend buying the =\r\nbook &quot;Pragmatic \nProject Automation&quot; by Mike Clark. It describes how to aut=\r\nomate your \nbuild process, including how to use CruiseControl and how to ru=\r\nn to \nbuild when things are checked in to CVS.\n\n\n\n\n\n",
