Between the two of you, you had the right answer ;-) =\r\n In the &quot;Install New Software&quot; dialog under Galileo there was nothing there=\r\n specific to JUnit.  But it occurred to me that installing &quot;EPP Java Packag=\r\ne&quot; and &quot;Java EE IDE Feature&quot; was a reasonable thing to do.\n\nDid that and no=\r\nw JUnit 4.5 is install and I can access the features I previously mentioned=\r\n were lacking.\n\nThanks!\n\n\n\n\n\n",
