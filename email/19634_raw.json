This is done by filtering out all other tests.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Now when I do that and pass that to the JUnitCore it still runs all\n&gt; tests/methods in that class :( .. am I missing something?\n&gt; (I suspect its related to the problem further down.. which in essence\n&gt; would be that I cannot filter testcases that have a suite() method)\n&gt;\n&gt; Furthermore I tried to implement my own Filter which would just filter\n&gt; out all unwanted methods using a Description.\n&gt; Now there it seems that JUnit currently doesnt allow me to filter test\n&gt; classes that contain the pre-v4 suite() methods\n&gt; (unless I explicitly create the Request using\n&gt; Request.classWithoutSuiteMethod())\n&gt;\n&gt; If I create the Request as ususal (Request.aClass()) the Runner that\n&gt; gets created internally is a AllTests Runner which doesnt implement\n&gt; Filterable.  As a result any filter.apply(Runner runner) calls have no\n&gt; effect and the test is executed according to the suite() method.\n&gt; So effectively I cannot filter test classes that have a suite() method.\n&gt;\n&gt; Is that a desired behavior?\n&gt; Should this be documented?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; This is some sample code to illustrate what I need to do to have a\n&gt; Filter actually be applied to my Test class (i.e. with that code I get\n&gt; just the testMethodName method invoked on the test class clazz ).\n&gt;\n&gt; // make a description with the methodname string\n&gt; final Description d2 = Description.createTestDescription(clazz,\n&gt; testMethodName);\n&gt;\n&gt; // anonymous inner class filtering out all tests where the description\n&gt; // differs from this methodnames description\n&gt; f = new Filter(){\n&gt;      /** run only the test where the description matches */\n&gt;      public boolean shouldRun(Description d) {\n&gt;          return d2.equals(d);\n&gt;      }\n&gt;      public String describe() {\n&gt;          return &quot;allows only methodname = &quot;+ testMethodName;\n&gt;      }\n&gt; };\n&gt;\n&gt; // weird hack: because most of our test cases have a suite method\n&gt; // junit creates a AllTests runner which does not implement Filterable\n&gt; // and hence the filter has no effect (and all methods are invoked)\n&gt; // so as a fix we create a request for a class without suite() method\n&gt; request = Request.classWithoutSuiteMethod(clazz);\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   Thanks,\n&gt;\n&gt; Sebastian\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
