Céderic is\ninterested in this topic and he contacted me to tell me what he thinks\nabout a new format/version. He agrees that the format should be\nmaintained and it should be guarnateed that the format is maintained on\nits full life cycle. He stated that the JUnit team can be a good choice.\n\nI think that we will never get a guarantee. As you can see in the past,\neven a big player like the apache software foundation can not guarantee\nthat each projects is maintained forever. I think the guarantee is not\nthe point.\n\nWhen ever someone is interessed in bringing the project to the next step\nit can be done (event-driven evolution) ;-)\n\nStefan Bodewig, one of the initial authors of the\nXMLJUnitResultFormater, contacts me to tell me his ideas, too. He stated\nthat it should be developed on &#39;neutral ground&#39; and should stay\nlanguage-agnostic.\n\nAt the moment it feels like a specification team come up around me. The\nteam members comes / should come from the ant team and the JUnit team,\nand from many other projects and programming languages that uses the\n&#39;old format&#39;. The more i think about it, it comes to my mind, that a\n&#39;neutral ground&#39; looks like to be the best biological nutrient media to\nensure that the next format version is language-agnostic.\n\nMy thanks goes to:\n- the ant team for inventing the format\n- the JUnit team for not at least borrowing the inoffical name for the\nformat (that does not realy have a name jet) - commonly called &quot;JUnit\nformat&quot;.\n\nIt is aaske strategic decision to d the big player (apache ant / JUnit)\nto give its name to the xml project or to forc with a new name. To call\nthe next version e.g. &#39;JUnit test result format 2.0&#39; can be a good\nchoice to be recognized. To become more language-agnostic a renaming to\na different name can be better - but i am not sure. It depends on the\ncommunity. Is the community conservative (name keeping) or progressive\n(renaming). I am not sure.\n\nI am a practitioner, so the format should at first fits your needs and\nthe other things can be done by-the-way (maybe someone with experience\nin strategic desicions can point me here).\n\nAt the moment it sounds good to rename it. I would call it TRUE format,\nwhere TRUE stands for &quot;Test Results Universal Exchange&quot; format - not at\nleast because a lot assertions should become true to make the developer\nhappy. Just my to cents.\n\nWhat does the community think:\n1) Where to place the project?\na) At a big player?\nb) Independent?\n\n2) Keep the name or rename it?\na) keep it (make the inofficial name an official name)\nb) rename it\n\nBest regards\nDaniela Waranie\n\n\n",
