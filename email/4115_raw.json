Documentation and comments should provide the WHY and the code\nshould clearly spell out the HOW and WHAT. For instance, look at any of the\njavadoc comments in the java.util package. They give book references, time\nstatistics, pre-conditions, and post-conditions. This type of documentation\nis incredibly useful. But I&#39;ve seen many stupid javadoc comments like this:\n\n/** Returns the ID of the object */\npublic int getId() {\n\treturn this.id;\n}\n\nLast night I commented a for loop because it was preferable to a while loop\ndue to the remote possibility of a infinite loop. This was so I don&#39;t come\nback later and say &quot;Why was I doing this the hard way?&quot;.\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Andy Kriger [mailto:kokaku@...]\nSent: Monday, February 18, 2002 1:34 PM\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: RE: OT: RE: [junit] Re: JavaDocs\n\n\nWhile generally true, it is often useful to document why a certain\nimplementation decision was made over another. How often do you look at old\ncode or someone else&#39;s code and wonder now why did I/they do it that way?\nThis becomes very handy during refactoring efforts where it is easy to\nforget that a chunk code is there for a specific reason that should be\naccounted for.\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Eric Heikkila [mailto:ericheikkila@...]\nSent: Monday, 18 February, 2002 16:21\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: Re: OT: RE: [junit] Re: JavaDocs\n\n\n\n--- &quot;Stevens, Timothy J. (LNG-MBC)&quot;\n&lt;timothy.j.stevens@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \tIf you remove the Javadocs from the code, they&#39;ll\n&gt; never get updated\n&gt; and will quickly become the useless docs that you\n&gt; hate. If you take an extra\n&gt; 30 seconds to keep your Javadocs up to date when you\n&gt; make any changes to a\n&gt; class&#39;s methods, you&#39;ll find they&#39;re not a pain at\n&gt; all. If you wait until\n&gt; you&#39;re finished coding then try to put them all in,\n&gt; though, I can see why\n&gt; you&#39;d hate them.\n&gt;\n&gt; \tAnd what&#39;s wrong with having them in the code? Do\n&gt; you not believe in\n&gt; comments, either? Javadocs provide a nice structure\n&gt; for commenting methods\n&gt; and classes, better than the random comment formats\n&gt; you typically see in\n&gt; C/C++ coding.\n&gt;\n&gt; \t-tim\n\nCorrect...can&#39;t stand comments.  The code should be\nfairly straightforward and self-documenting.  If I\nHAVE to read a bunch of comments to figure the code\nout, the code needs to be ripped out and redone.\n\n-Eric\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
