For me, it works (and runs the code!) when\n&gt;&gt;rerunning individual test method instances /that were found using\n&gt;&gt;the standard TestSuite(TestCase) constructor/.  But for dynamically\n&gt;&gt;generated test cases, it doesn&#39;t rerun them.  Looks like an Eclipse\n&gt;&gt;bug to me.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Jeff,\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m a little uncomfortable calling it a bug.  Since JUnit 3 allows fully \n&gt; dynamic test tree generation, it can be undecidable in advance whether a \n&gt; given test case will even be included in the suite that is run, and more \n&gt; difficult than that to actually dynamically reconstruct the test case \n&gt; alone without running the rest of the suite.\n\n   That is true, but from other hand you don&#39;t really have to _run_ \ntests to see that test cases will be included into suite. Note that I \nam not talking about completely random suites and in 99.9% suite() \nmethod will return the same set od test cases. So, IDE or other test \nrunner could of kept these instances alive or even easier - recreate \nonly this instance using number of the test in the suite as a key.\n\n&gt; Eclipse will work correctly rerunning tests on suites made up of \n&gt; TestCases and TestSuites constructed in the usual way, such as \n&gt; suite.addTestCase(MyTest.class).  This seems to be a good way to cover \n&gt; 80% of what users want.  Is there another JUnit 3 pattern so prevalent \n&gt; that addressing it would up that coverage to 90%?\n\n   Heh. Most of the users don&#39;t even run tests from the IDE (those run \non continuous integration server using Ant or Maven). That may quite \nchange the estimate you gave before. In any case where did you get \nsuch numbers anyways? :-)\n\n&gt; One cool thing about JUnit 4 is that while you should be able to do \n&gt; arbitrary test-creation cleverness using the @RunWith annotation, this \n&gt; is a static annotation that IDE&#39;s can easily check.  So version 17.1 of \n&gt; some IDE might be able to rerun tests run with TestClassRunner (JUnit 4 \n&gt; default) and OldTestClassRunner (JUnit 3 default), and if it turns out a \n&gt; lot of people are using Parameterized, 17.2 could add support for that.\n\n   It seems violating the concept of annotations. You should not \nannotate the behaviour, but rather define enough metadata that can be \nused by the tool to decide how to behave. From this point of view the \napproach Cedric choose for TestNG is less intrusive (even so I hate \nxml configs and believe that he should of provided an API for IDE \nintegration and embedding instead of generating temporary xml configs \nfrom an IDE plugins)\n\n   regards,\n   Eugene\n\n\n",
