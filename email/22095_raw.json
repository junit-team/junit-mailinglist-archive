What I do is define s=\r\nome String constants in a relevant class that defines the basic reasons (re=\r\nad Categories) of things that are ignored, so I can do a where-used with my=\r\n IDE to find which tests are ignored under that category. (Not that I have =\r\nto do it that often, but I found the approach gives me everything I need).\n=\r\n\nYishai\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, David Saff &lt;david@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; 20=\r\n09/11/20 C=C3=A9dric Beust =E2=99&quot; &lt;cbeust@...&gt;:\n&gt; &gt; On Fri, Nov 20, 2009 a=\r\nt 7:07 PM, Georg &lt;le_garcon_enerve@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Hi David,=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Did you gave thoughs to cases where one would like to exclude ce=\r\nrtain\n&gt; &gt;&gt; tests? E.g.: run all tests that are not in (a) certain category(=\r\ns)? This is\n&gt; &gt;&gt; probably not difficult add in one way or another onto the =\r\nconcept of\n&gt; &gt;&gt; categories, but the answer to &quot;which test is now acctually =\r\nincluded&quot; could\n&gt; &gt;&gt; become confusing in cases where a test is in an includ=\r\ned and an excluded\n&gt; &gt;&gt; category. I would like to see something here that d=\r\noes not require a lot of\n&gt; &gt;&gt; browsing through hierarchies of suites nad ca=\r\ntegories. This may in my\n&gt; &gt;&gt; approach not well solved either as suites can=\r\n extend on other suites: if a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; referenced suite includes a certain test=\r\n, it is executed even if the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; extending suite excludes a test.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; And more fundamentally: is the idea/need of exclusion meaningfull or just=\r\n a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; result of badly organising tests (I&#39;d say no, but I may be wrong)?\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; For what it&#39;s worth, excluding tests is a very popular TestNG =\r\nfeatures. =C2=A0For\n&gt; &gt; example, I use it when a few tests are broken and n=\r\need to remain so for a\n&gt; &gt; while: =C2=A0I put them in the group &quot;broken&quot;, w=\r\nhich I always exclude during my\n&gt; &gt; runs.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; When the time to ship app=\r\nroaches, I look at all the tests in the &quot;broken&quot;\n&gt; &gt; category and I go fix =\r\nthem then.\n&gt; \n&gt; For this particular use case, I&#39;ve found @Ignore generally =\r\nuseful.  I\n&gt; also really love Kevin Lawrence&#39;s idea of marking tests with b=\r\nug\n&gt; numbers.  He does it like this:\n&gt; \n&gt; @Test public void shouldntDeleteA=\r\nllTheUsersFiles() {\n&gt;   bug(34456);\n&gt;   ...\n&gt; }\n&gt; \n&gt; The test only starts f=\r\nailing once bug 34456 is marked as fixed in the\n&gt; bug system.  Once we have=\r\n failing assumptions working as they truly\n&gt; should, this will be easy to i=\r\nmplement on the JUnit side, although the\n&gt; bug-system integration would sti=\r\nll be up to individual extenders or\n&gt; teams.\n&gt; \n&gt; All this is to say that I=\r\n do get the idea of excluded categories, but\n&gt; this particular instance doe=\r\nsn&#39;t immediately convince me.\n&gt; \n&gt;    David Saff\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --\n&gt; &gt; ***C=C3=\r\n=A9dric\n&gt; &gt; *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been remo=\r\nved]\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
