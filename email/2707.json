Generally, specifications are <br/>\nreviewed; implementations are tested.  There are no semantic <br/>\nexpressions in IDL.<br/>\n<br/>\nI personally see little point to interface testing if there will be a <br/>\nsingle implementation.  So, I will assume you are in a situation where <br/>\nthere are multiple objects implementing the interfaces in question.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only added complexity in this situation, as compared to non-CORBA <br/>\nunit testing, is getting ahold of the object to test.  I think <br/>\nsomebody already described connecting to the service to get named <br/>\nobjects.<br/>\n<br/>\nActually, because of CORBA, you have more options at your disposal.  <br/>\nConsider a test service that manages references to objects you are <br/>\ntesting.  This gives you a central place to find things.  Particularly <br/>\nuseful for unnamed objects.<br/>\n<br/>\nI particularly like the later solution because it removes knowledge <br/>\nabout the implementation under test from the test suite.  To test a <br/>\nnew implementation, change the reference in your managing service and <br/>\nrerun the suite.</div>",
