I bet that y=\r\nou could get the code to the job there.\n&gt;\n&gt; Are you referring to PMD - the =\r\nsource code analyzer?\n\nYes\n\n&gt;\n&gt; This reference points to the possible conve=\r\nrgence of unit testing\n&gt; and source code analysis.  In a limited sense - th=\r\nis is the notion\n&gt; of Verification Facilitation - interrogating a code base=\r\n through\n&gt; convergence of the two approaches.\n\nInteresting - I was really j=\r\nust pointing out that PMD has code to\ndetect the use of javadoc tags and us=\r\nes them like attributes.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; I also wonder if you&#39;ve considered trying t=\r\no some automated\n&gt; arguement\n&gt; &gt; checking? Test that methods either accept =\r\ninteresting params: null,\n&gt; &gt; &quot;&quot;, -1, Integer.MAX_VALUE, .... or throw the =\r\nappropriate argument\n&gt; &gt; exception.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; This is very interesting - and =\r\nthe scope could go beyond simply\n&gt; accessor methods.  For instance, the app=\r\nlication chronicled\n&gt; in &quot;TestUtil: By Example&quot; contains about 5,000 method=\r\ns (~3,000 are\n&gt; accessors).  It might be useful to have a list of which of =\r\nthose\n&gt; 5,000 signatures, that include a parameter of type Object, do not\n&gt;=\r\n throw an exception for a null argument.  The list could be organized\n&gt; by =\r\naccessor and non-accessor methods.\n\nAs I outlined in more detail in my repl=\r\ny to Cedric - thats exactly\nwhat I&#39;m thinking. Currently we encourage devel=\r\nopers to write tests\nthat pass in null, emptyString, etc to test/illustrate=\r\n the boundary\nconditions in their code. It would be very helpful to automat=\r\ne some of\nthat.  BTW This is part of the value that Agitar offers.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; I=\r\nf you&#39;re interested I could flesh out the idea some more.\n\nDamn now I&#39;m on =\r\nthe hook.\n\nCheers\nMark\n----------------------------------------------------=\r\n------------------\nBlog: http://dotnetjunkies.com/WebLog/mlevison/\n\n",
