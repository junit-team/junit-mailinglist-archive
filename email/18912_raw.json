I am not surprised as\nrunning CppUnit (Eclipse on Windows with CDT) I found it too flaky to\ncount on. Is this because the group doesn&#39;t see C++ as a future\nlanguage? It might not be. I lobbied to use Real-Time Java instead\nof C++, to no avail. Later, when it was too late to change, the\nproject manager told me Java would have been a better choice.\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups. &lt;mailto:junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt; com, &quot;Kent Beck&quot;\n&lt;kentb@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; All,\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; At the Agile Open Northwest conference I held an open space session\non the\n&gt; future of testing tools. I expected to talk a little about Theories and\n&gt; assertThat, but we ended up having a wide-ranging discussion about a\nvariety\n&gt; of topics. I mind-mapped the result and put in on the conference wiki: \n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.agileope\n&lt;http://www.agileopennorthwest.com/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?FutureOfUnitTesting&gt;\nnnorthwest.com/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?FutureOfUnitTesting\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; The most surprising result to me was the interest in language\nfeatures for\n&gt; testing-what would a language look like that included\ndouble-checking as a\n&gt; first-class concept? I was also surprised at how much commonality\nthere was\n&gt; between the unit and functional testing &quot;vendors&quot;, that reporting is\na big\n&gt; issue for everyone.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; One thing missing from the discussion was much talk about the hopes and\n&gt; dreams of users, so I thought I would open up the question here.\nWhat is it\n&gt; you wish your testing tool would do for you that it doesn&#39;t?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Kent Beck\n&gt; \n&gt; Three Rivers Institute\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n\n\n\n \n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
