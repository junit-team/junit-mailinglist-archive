In particular,<br/>\n&gt; the idea to &quot;do the simplest thing that can possibly work&quot; can be<br/>\n&gt; dangerous, because sometimes, you just know where your code is going<br/>\n&gt; and it&#39;s safe to start doing things that might not necessarily be the<br/>\n&gt; simplest thing at the moment but that will save you time in the near<br/>\n&gt; future.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>But sometimes I am confused with the idea to &quot;do the simplest thing<br/>\nthat can possibly work&quot;. I lost my judgement on what is the simplest<br/>\nthing that can possibly work,just as mentioned in this discussion.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow to get good judgement?I think I no choice but more and more<br/>\nlearning and practice.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks.</div>",
