This is one of the<br/>\nmany examples where test-driven design is sometimes the wrong thing to do.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nCédric<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://testng.org\">http://testng.org</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
