They have a fatal, from my<br/>\nperspective, flaw.  Namely, to generate events against the components they<br/>\ncreate a Java level event and post it to the event queue like so:<br/>\n<br/>\n            queue.postEvent(new MouseEvent(ultimate,<br/>\n                          MouseEvent.MOUSE_ENTERED,<br/>\n                    new Date().getTime(), 0,<br/>\n                    comp.getLocationOnScreen().x<br/>\n                        -ultimate.getLocationOnScreen().x,<br/>\n                    comp.getLocationOnScreen().y<br/>\n                        -ultimate.getLocationOnScreen().y, 0, false));<br/>\n\t...etc...<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem with this is that they do not exercise the native level code<br/>\nin the slightest, so they are not getting complete code coverage.  Like I<br/>\nsaid in my earlier email, my situation is different from y&#39;all since my<br/>\njob is to help validate the JDK and we need to validate as much as we can.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe difference between using Robot, and the above, is that Robot asks<br/>\nthe operating system to generate a system level event, that acts for all<br/>\nintents and purposes like any event generated by a user twidling the mouse<br/>\nor typing on the keyboard.  The event arrives in Java in the same way and<br/>\nmanner as any real event generated by a real user, and more importantly it<br/>\nfollows the same code paths those real events would follow.  This way<br/>\nthere are two advantages: 1) we can test AWT heavyweight components, 2) we<br/>\nhave complete coverage of the AWT native code, the AWT support code, and<br/>\nthe Swing classes.  Even for a pure Swing application, there is AWT code<br/>\nthat executes under the sheets (JFrame is, for instance, a wrapper around<br/>\nWindow).<br/>\n<br/>\n- David Herron</div>",
