I avoided taking that route before since\n&gt; &lt;junit&gt; and &lt;junitreport&gt; were such an improvement over what I had\n&gt; originally. However (I think) I have run up against a limitation of\n&gt; the &lt;junit&gt; task which makes me revisit this solution. The &lt;junit&gt;\n&gt; task isn&#39;t working for me because it won&#39;t allow you to control how\n&gt; much exception stack trace information is kept for each failure. I\n&gt; only want to see the first line or two (the only really useful info in\n&gt; the exception stack), but I want to limit the amount of exceptions\n&gt; that are reported because I appear to be running out of memory when I\n&gt; run a full test suite of over 80 tests. This never happened before I\n&gt; started using Ant/&lt;junit&gt;/&lt;junitreport&gt;, and my assumption is that the\n&gt; exception stacks for each failure are being kept in memory by the\n&gt; &lt;junit&gt; task, which is expecting to write all of the info to XML once\n&gt; the suite completes. Unfortunately after so many failures the\n&gt; exception stack info being held in memory is so much that the program\n&gt; crashes with an out-of-memory error. Is my assumption correct? Will\n&gt; the TestListener approach help me?\n\nUsing your own TestListener won&#39;t solve the OutOfMemory problem, \nalthough it might delay the problem a bit further, unless, of course, \nyou use the TestListener to write all that information out to disk \nfirst, then after running the tests, read that back from disk to process it.\n-- \nJ.
