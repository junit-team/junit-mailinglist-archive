Could you please put in big, red letters on the<br/>\n&gt; site<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that this is strictly a legacy code technique, and that people<br/>\n&gt; should<br/>\n&gt; &gt; try to refactor away from using the tool as quickly as possible?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Another great tool for adding tests to code. I think I can use this<br/>\n&gt; &gt; tomorrow.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; --<br/>\n&gt; I just read the post on this little tool, so I haven&#39;t tried it yet,<br/>\n&gt; but it seems like it would be very helpful for mocking member objects<br/>\n&gt; created in a class. How do you refactor to eliminate a dependency on<br/>\n&gt; member objects. I understand how to do it with objects a class<br/>\n&gt; collaborates with, but it is a different matter when the member<br/>\n&gt; objects are &quot;owned&quot; by the object being tested. I guess you could<br/>\n&gt; provide the class with a factory class it could use to create it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; members, but this seems like a lot of overhead for an object that only<br/>\n&gt; needs this capability for testing purposes.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am a new java programmer, so forgive me if my terminology isn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; correct. Hopefully you can understand what I am trying to say.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I suggest reading up about inversion of control and dependency injection<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html\">http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html</a> is a good read.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://picocontainer.codehaus.org/\">http://picocontainer.codehaus.org/</a> has some nice 1, 2 and 5 minute tutorials<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n- Dan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
