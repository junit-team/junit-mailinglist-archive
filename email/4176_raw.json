I am not against this (in fact I prefer it),\n&gt; but often a few words of English (or whatever language you read) is\n&gt; preferrable (IMHO) to a large test suite.\n&gt; I still have the test suite, however, for refactoring and code proof.\n&gt;\n\nIf we don&#39;t write new code until we have a failing test, then the tests cover all the methods.  I agree that they may not test all possible parameters.  We&#39;ll maximize the testing investment by testing interesting boundary conditions and reasonable ranges for parameters.  Our code coverage will still be very high.  And yes, we&#39;ll amass test suites quickly as our tests become more comprehensive over time.\n\nIf a few words of English is necessary over and above the method signature, then by all means add it to the documentation.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; I would still say that that the tests document examples of the intention,\n&gt; rather than the intention itself. These examples may be a complete set or\n&gt; may not be, often just the critical subset.\n&gt;\n\nAgreed.  Examples of intention and intention draw closer together the more we use test-first design.  Nevertheless, we&#39;re documenting intention rather than implementation.\n\nGood points - thanks!\n\nMike\n\n--\nMike Clark\nClarkware Consulting, Inc.\nhttp://www.clarkware.com\n720.851.2014\n\n\n\n",
