IBM has apparently &quot;enhanced&quot; the JUnit<br/>\nthey ship with VAJ so that it runs well inside VAJ, but not so well<br/>\noutside. Most of us who use JUnit do not develop with VAJ.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps,<br/>\n<br/>\nFrank<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Wed, 2003-06-18 at 17:52, ok_lilya wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Rainsberger,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I tried your suggestion but it still doesn&#39;t run. inVAJava() checks <br/>\n&gt; for Class.forName(&quot;com.ibm.uvm.tools.DebugSupport&quot;);  and since this <br/>\n&gt; class has to be linked with another ibm java class, it throws the <br/>\n&gt; same LinkageError: java.jang.UnsatistiedLinkError:no uvmtools in <br/>\n&gt; java.library.path<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; And therefore, inVAJava doesn&#39;t return true and JUnit stalls.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I created a very small program that only contains inVAJava() method <br/>\n&gt; and a main that calls it:<br/>\n&gt; public static boolean inVAJava() {<br/>\n&gt;  try {<br/>\n&gt;    Class.forName(&quot;com.ibm.uvm.tools.DebugSupport&quot;);<br/>\n&gt;  }<br/>\n&gt;  catch (Exception e) {<br/>\n&gt;    return false;<br/>\n&gt;  }<br/>\n&gt;   return true;<br/>\n&gt; }<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; main... {<br/>\n&gt;   if (inVajava())<br/>\n&gt;      System.out.println(&quot;true&quot;);<br/>\n&gt;   else<br/>\n&gt;      System.out.println(&quot;false&quot;);<br/>\n&gt; }<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Then I exported my program with package com.ibm.uvm.tools.DebugSupport<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Seems that inVAJava() never returns true when run outside of VAJ. It <br/>\n&gt; almost acts like a security feature - so that you can&#39;t run it ouside <br/>\n&gt; of VAJ. JUnit uses that method, that means that it will never return <br/>\n&gt; true unless running in VAJ.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve been stuck on this problem way too long - There must be somekind <br/>\n&gt; of solution to it! Unless JUnit is designed specifically to avoid <br/>\n&gt; being run outside of VAJ. I&#39;m on the verge of giving up.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If you have any other solution in mind, I would really appreciate it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks so much.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Lily.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;J.

They should let the Model objects containing <br/>\n&gt; business<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;logic &quot;do with them what they may&quot;. There is a tendency in OOP to <br/>\n&gt; pretend<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;there is behavior where there is no behavior. I think that is a <br/>\n&gt; mistake.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Some objects in the system are just bags of data. I think public <br/>\n&gt; fields<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;should do nicely there. Ward Cunningham has been experimenting with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;ignoring the prevaling paranoia against public data. I haven&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; seen him<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;write anything on it yet, but it&#39;s good to test long-<br/>\n&gt; standing &quot;rules&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;I agree with that when it is applied to &quot;data structures,&quot; the <br/>\n&gt; naked<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;objects you refer to, but not behavioral objects.  I don&#39;t think <br/>\n&gt; you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;were applying it to the latter, I just wanted to be clear.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Exactly. I&#39;m with you. Sometimes, it&#39;s just a bag of data. Maps <br/>\n&gt; would do.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; One counterexample is an object with 20 fields. Perhaps 20 set <br/>\n&gt; methods<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;is clearer, at least in a language like Java with positional <br/>\n&gt; parameters.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;(In Smalltalk it&#39;s exactly the same, so it doesn&#39;t matter.) Should <br/>\n&gt; an<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;object have 20 fields? Perhaps not, but some do. It is not clear <br/>\n&gt; that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;breaking that 20-field objects into four 5-field objects is any <br/>\n&gt; better.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;A twist on that... If that object needs to have 20 fields (which I <br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;believe it does) you can group fields together into other objects <br/>\n&gt; such<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;that this object is a wrapper on 5 others, each with 4 fields.  <br/>\n&gt; The data<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;is still in one place, but it&#39;s creation is much less cumbersome <br/>\n&gt; and you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;can create it in a sane state.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t know that this is better: now I have to build five or six <br/>\n&gt; objects, and not just one. I think the creation is *no less* <br/>\n&gt; cumbersome in this case. That has been my observation.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Take care.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; J.
