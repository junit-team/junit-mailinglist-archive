This is in RAD 6.x, which uses\nJUnit 3.=\r\n8. As far as I can tell, I cannot upgrade to JUnit 4.x becuz\nRAD 6.x cannot=\r\n go beyond Java 1.4.2. Because I am learning, I am not\nsure if my problem i=\r\ns with the IDE or with JUnit code - here&#39;s the\ndescription:\n\nThe original p=\r\nrogrammer had a System.getProperty(&quot;TestPath&quot;) in his\nTestAll class which e=\r\nxtends TestCase and collects all the tests in the\nTestPath directory into a=\r\n TestSuite and runs them etc...\n\nThis runs but does not find the test class=\r\nes, probably becuz\ngetTestPath() returns null : )\nI cannot find where TestP=\r\nath is set, created, or otherwise acquired.\nWhen I hardcode it, the testcas=\r\nes are still not found. Is there a\nstandard for where to put and maintain t=\r\nhe property &quot;TestPath&quot; in\norder to run JUnit from RAD? \n\nThanks,\nLibby\n\n\n",
