He asked, &quot;Is there a better way?&quot; I offered one.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot all opinions need to be so polarizing.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I understand that the framework offers us <br/>\n&gt;a lot of possibilities, and it&#39;s up to us to choose what&#39;s the best <br/>\n&gt;way to use it, according to our needs and purposes. I think all <br/>\n&gt;approaches have its pros and cons; for example, the approach he&#39;s <br/>\n&gt;using, of running batch tests starting with &quot;Test&quot;, has the problem <br/>\n&gt;of not selecting a particular set of tests to run each time, but he <br/>\n&gt;has the benefit of not worrying about anything except his unit tests. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>He is changing the names of tests by hand to group tests together. JUnit already has a natural way to group tests together that does not require this manual intervention. I think we can all agree that maintaining test suites in this way -- by hand -- is only a short-term solution (on the order of minutes). If a test suite needs to survive more than a few minutes, the most effective way to build the suite is by building a TestSuite object somehow.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;The suite approach, as you suggests, has a pro of grouping tests, but <br/>\n&gt;has also a con of hard-coding in a class which tests should be run. <br/>\n&gt;This is related to the problem I have, of running a piece of code <br/>\n&gt;somewhere before all tests.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Your problem is easy to solve, too: TestSetup. Or GSBase&#39;s OrderedTestSuite. Or your own custom TestRunner (the best solution) which runs your piece of code first, then the test suite. Any of those would work.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;If I&#39;ve said something wrong, feel free to correct me, I&#39;m always <br/>\n&gt;ready to learn.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>As am I.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJ.
