E.g.: run all  tests that are not in (a) certain category(s)? This is probably not difficult add in one way or another onto the concept of categories, but the answer to &quot;which test is now acctually included&quot; could become confusing in cases where a test is in an included and an excluded category. I would like to see something here that does not require a lot of browsing through hierarchies of suites nad categories. This may in my approach not well solved either as suites can extend on other suites: if a referenced suite includes a certain test, it is executed even if the extending suite excludes a test.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Georg,<br/>\n<br/>\nWe came very close to adding an ExcludeCategories annotation.<br/>\nHowever, we decided to stay at a minimal feature set for Categories in<br/>\nthe initial release, figuring that if the whole API turned out to be<br/>\nwrong, or if users just shrugged, then any time put into perfecting<br/>\nthe mini-language of category filter configuration would be wasted.<br/>\nIf the feature takes off, I think we&#39;ll certainly revisit that<br/>\ndecision (especially if a highly-voted github issue requests it, hint,<br/>\nhint.)<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, Iyou touch on another concern: a simple category feature set<br/>\nthat is easy to understand, but leaves out 20% of valid use cases, may<br/>\nbe preferable to a more &quot;feature complete&quot; feature implementation that<br/>\nrequires pages of documentation to fully grok.  I don&#39;t know that<br/>\nwe&#39;re in danger of either extreme yet.<br/>\n<br/>\n   David Saff<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; And more fundamentally: is the idea/need of exclusion meaningfull or just a result of badly organising tests (I&#39;d say no, but I may be wrong)?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Cheers,<br/>\n&gt;  Georg<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
