They all have the same \nstructure:\n1. Create some test files and directories in an directory called &quot;source&quot;\n2. Start the backup process (to backup the files/dirs in &quot;source&quot; to a \ndirectory called &quot;target&quot;)\n3. Check whether all files in &quot;source&quot; exist also in &quot;target&quot;\n4. Remove all files from the &quot;source&quot; and &quot;target&quot; directory so that the \ndirectories are empty for the next test.\n\nIf i execute the whole test set ten times, i have 6-7 successes and 3-4 \nfailures. The error messages say that files in the target directory \ncould not be created or deleted (in the last step of the tests, see \nabove) if there is a failure. One possibility i could think of is that \nthe tests are not run sequentially, so they could have influence at each \nother. But as far as i know JUnit runs all tests in separate threads and \nthose sequentially. Is that correct? Does anybody have any suggestions?\n\nI use eclipse helios, JUnit 4.8.1, Java 1.6 and AspectJ\n\nBest regards,\n\nNils\n\n",
