Please consider, others may have different <br/>\nways to do things. I don&#39;t think there is THE right way that <br/>\nfits everything and everyone. Choose what fit&#39;s your needs <br/>\nand don&#39;t stop looking for ways to improve. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve tried to program exactly the way you described. (I did this <br/>\nmonths ago.) It just didn&#39;t fit me that much. (Please remember, <br/>\nthe difference is only in the way of sketching and this depends <br/>\non the support by the IDE one uses, too.) <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn response to J. B. Rainsberger:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; ...For Customer Tests, I would never expect to find a CT by<br/>\n&gt; looking for a method name; I would look for the name of a use case or<br/>\n&gt; transaction script or feature.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I agree with you. That&#39;s what I ment with my PS statement <br/>\nat the bottom of that email.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;JUnitDoclet allows re-generating, so it&#39;s not much work <br/>\n&gt; &gt;to keep tests and app in sync.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Regenerating what? Does it regenerate test stubs? <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, stubs are _regenerated_and_merged_ according to the <br/>\nnew structure of the application.Most of the tests are placed <br/>\nin the right spot and the tool points you to the few others, <br/>\nthat have been affected by the change in the application if <br/>\nthey could not been handled automatically.<br/>\n_No_test_gets_lost._<br/>\nIf one does that as part of refactoring, it&#39;s very easy to <br/>\nmanage, since refactoring is done in small steps.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Do I need to reimplement my test?!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>NO. Definitely not.<br/>\n(I would like to write this in very large letters. :) <br/>\n<br/>\nRegards,<br/>\n<br/>\nSteffen Gemkow</div>",
