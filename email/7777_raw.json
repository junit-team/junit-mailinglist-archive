I changed it to Weblogic and got past this one.  \n\nHowever, now I&#39;m getting the following:\n\njavax.naming.CommunicationException [Root exception is\njava.net.ConnectException: t3://localhost:7001: Destinati\non unreachable; nested exception is:\n        java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused: connect; No\navailable router to destination]\n\nThis is the exception that I got when using ant to compile and run the\njunit test.  I started running the test from a dos prompt calling\njava, because that was how I got the ExampleServerTestCase to run. \nBut I eventually got back to this error (I guess because the other\ncode that I call is running outside the app server.)\n\nHow can I get around this?\n\nThanks.\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;scohan2005&quot; &lt;scohan@g...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; I am trying to integrate ServerTestCase with pre-existing junit \n&gt; tests.  Right now, I&#39;m just trying to test back end server DAO code - \n&gt; not ejbs.  The back end code works - i&#39;m just trying to get the tests \n&gt; converted to ServerTestCases.   We&#39;ve just moved to WebLogic 7.1.\n&gt; \n&gt; Within my test case, call it MyTestCase (that extends ServerTestCase\n&gt; ()), I have a main that instantiates MyTestCase passing \n&gt; in &quot;MyTestCase&quot;.  Before calling the method I want to test, I have to \n&gt; call a login class to set up some initial data that is required in my \n&gt; test method (i.e, login credential data).  This login class connects \n&gt; to an oracle db to get the initial data.  Before doing so, the login  \n&gt; class attempts to instantiate an InitialContext (to get a \n&gt; connection), however, &#39;new InitialContext()&#39; throws the following:\n&gt; \n&gt; javax.naming.NoInitialContextException: Cannot instantiate class: \n&gt; org.jnp.interfaces.NamingContextFactory [Root\n&gt; exception is java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: \n&gt; org.jnp.interfaces.NamingContextFactory]  \n&gt; \n&gt; The login code works when called from our Struts front end, but \n&gt; throws the above exception when called from MyTestCase.  What am I \n&gt; missing as far as the InitialContext goes?  It seems that \n&gt; ServerTestCase has successfully set up its InitialConext prior to me \n&gt; calling this other class.  Shouldn&#39;t the Context then be available \n&gt; for subsequent InitialConext calls?  Obviously, this is fuzzy to me.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks.\n\n\n",
