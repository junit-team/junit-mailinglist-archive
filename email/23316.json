I see there is a shell-script in<br/>\na pull request, there&#39;s probably some complication I don&#39;t understand<br/>\nhere ? Given that junit builds with ant (well mostly...) and the problem<br/>\nis easily solved with ant, why not just use ant ? Whoever makes the<br/>\nrelease just runs a few extra ant steps, closes the staging repo on<br/>\noss.sonatype.org and voila ?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKristian<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nfr., 11.03.2011 kl. 09.21 -0500, skrev David Saff:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;   <br/>\n&gt; On Fri, Mar 11, 2011 at 3:13 AM, Max Bowsher &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:maxb@...\">maxb@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; On 04/03/11 19:13, David Saff wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; All,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Looks like junit-dep is not being uploaded to maven:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; It wasn&#39;t being reliably done for a while, but I backfilled all<br/>\n&gt; &gt; obtainable versions of both flavours when I assisted with uploads of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 4.8.2 in October 2010.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; This was handled under <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/KentBeck/junit/issues/66\">https://github.com/KentBeck/junit/issues/66</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; At the time I wasn&#39;t aware of:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/KentBeck/junit/issues/#issue/33\">https://github.com/KentBeck/junit/issues/#issue/33</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; or it need not have remained open.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Since then it seems to have exploded into discussion beyond the<br/>\n&gt; initial<br/>\n&gt; &gt; remit of the issue.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Max,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks for all of your help on that. It made a big difference for<br/>\n&gt; many users. With 4.9, I want to try something new: after posting the<br/>\n&gt; jars on github, I&#39;ll also try to immediately upload them to maven<br/>\n&gt; central. I&#39;m asking for help automating that process from people who<br/>\n&gt; have more familiarity with the concepts. You&#39;re right that the<br/>\n&gt; discussion doesn&#39;t necessarily make sense underneath that issue any<br/>\n&gt; more.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; It may finally be time for me to just take over running the script<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; that makes the magic happen, since this seems to be a major<br/>\n&gt; obstacle<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; for many people trying to get new features and bug fixes from<br/>\n&gt; JUnit.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Can I ask again for help from the maven-initiated?  Best thing<br/>\n&gt; would<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; be a pull request with a shell script that I can run on release,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; without needing to understand too much about what it does.  Thanks,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Reading the cover letter of<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/KentBeck/junit/pull/203\">https://github.com/KentBeck/junit/pull/203</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; makes it sound as if all necessary scripting work has already been<br/>\n&gt; done.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; (Someone would then take the output of the script and upload it<br/>\n&gt; through<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the oss.sonatype.org web interface)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Yep, I think we&#39;re almost there.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Max.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
