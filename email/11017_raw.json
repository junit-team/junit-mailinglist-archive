I suspect that\nthere is some form of resource hogging occurring within your code (either\ntest code, production code, or both) that is the real cause of the problem.\n\nThe setUp() & tearDown() methods that JUnit calls before & after each\ntestcase (method) is called, should be used where necessary to release\nresources. This will allow the GarbageCollector to free memory as needed,\nwithout you having to change the JVM&#39;s heap size.\n\nHTH\n\nAndrew\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: claudioillanes [mailto:claudioillanes@...]\n&gt; Sent: 13 May 2004 21:55\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: [junit] Making a large set of tests as efficient as possible\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi there!\n&gt;\n&gt; Just a quick question. I have  a suite that lines up about 25 test\n&gt; classes ( each containing say 10 test methods ) and I iterate for 300\n&gt; objects to add these tests to a suite. I would like to know any best\n&gt; practices to ensure I don&#39;t get any OutOfMemoryErrors. I changed the\n&gt; jvm tag to increase virtual memory to say 512 but, if I keep adding\n&gt; many tests to this suite, what would be the next item to ensure I&#39;m\n&gt; doing. I am also setting TestCase member variables to null where\n&gt; possible. What would be the next step? The reason I ask is because I\n&gt; would like to push JUnit to the limit and have it test all day and\n&gt; night for a large application. Any help or comments would be\n&gt; appreciated. Even different design techniques are welcome.\n&gt;\n&gt; Cheers!\n&gt; Claudio\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo! Groups Links\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n",
