Here&#39;s the code and I&#39;ll comment further\non the but below:\n\n    private ComponentDefinition\nloadComponentDefinition(File resourceFile) throws\nMojoExecutionException {\n\n        ResourceSet resourceSet = new\nResourceSetImpl();\n\n        \n\n\n\n        resourceSet.getResourceFactoryRegistry().\n\n        getExtensionToFactoryMap().put(RDNA_EXTENSION,\nnew XMIResourceFactoryImpl());\n\n        \n\n        Resource resource = \n\n           \nresourceSet.createResource(URI.createFileURI(resourceFile.getAbsolutePath()));\n\n               \n\n\n\n        RdnaPackage rdnaPackage =\nRdnaPackage.eINSTANCE;\n\n       \nresourceSet.getPackageRegistry().put(rdnaPackage.getNsURI(),\nrdnaPackage);\n\n        \n\n\n        try {\n\n            resource.load(null);\n\n        } catch (IOException e1) {\n\n            throw new MojoExecutionException(&quot;Could\nnot read rdna resource.&quot;);\n\n        }\n\n               \n\n        ComponentDefinition componentDefinition =\n\n            (ComponentDefinition)\nresource.getContents().get(0);\n\n        \n\n        return componentDefinition;    \t\n\n    }\n\n\nThis code has a few parameters in it that are specific\n\nto the loading of this type of resource.\n\nFirst ComponentDefinition:\n\nThis is the model of the resource being loaded.\n\nRdnaPackage\n\nThis is part of the factory for creating instances of\nthe model being loaded.\n\nSo this method returns an instance of the loaded\nmodel.\n\nIn this case the RdnaPackage and ComponentDefinition\nhave a one to one correspondence, and both are needed\nto make use of the loaded model, so I decided just to\nkeep the method private and test it using the\nPriviligedAccessor...\n\nCheers,\n- Ole\n\n--- Ilja Preuss &lt;it@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; Ole Ersoy wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; The file loading part is in a private method,\n&gt; because\n&gt; &gt; the load routine is specific to the class that is\n&gt; &gt; being tested, and is therefore not useful in a\n&gt; utility\n&gt; &gt; library.\n&gt; \n&gt; Reusability is not the only reason to extract things\n&gt; into their own \n&gt; classes, is it?\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; So I just wanted to put the load routine in a\n&gt; private\n&gt; &gt; method and test it there, then call it from the\n&gt; public\n&gt; &gt; method.\n&gt; \n&gt; Would putting it into its own class have had any\n&gt; negative effect?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Can you show us the load routine?\n&gt; \n&gt; Curious, Ilja\n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
