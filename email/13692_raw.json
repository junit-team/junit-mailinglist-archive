I can&#39;t recall any of these people being very confused \nabout the difference between a failure (one of your assertions failed) and \nan error (something else went wrong).  Nor can I recall anyone having much \ndifficulty grasping the concept of setUp() as a place for common code that \ngets run right before each test method.  You don&#39;t have to like them, but \nthese are not hard concepts.\n\nFinally, I don&#39;t pretend to know how everyone out there is using JUnit.  But \nwith XP-style development the only situations I can think of where you would \nsuddenly get 100 errors OR failures that you needed to parse through are:\n\n1) Lots of your &quot;unit&quot; tests really depend on some fragile/unreliable \nexternal resource (bad)\n\n2) Many tests are tightly coupled and are exercising the same lines of code \n(bad)\n\n3) Someone made a LOT of edits in between test runs (bad)\n\nThe strength of JUnit lies not in its reporting capabilities, but in the \nease with which you can move seamlessly--almost effortlessly--between \nwriting tests, writing code, and running tests to check your assumptions and \nmeasure your progress.\n\nJeff Nielsen\nDigital Focus\nwww.digitalfocus.com\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;Cedric Beust&quot; &lt;cbeust@...&gt;\n\nI have always found the difference between ERROR and FAILURE confusing and I\nbet that except for JUnit experts such as yourself, nobody can really\nexplain it.\n\nAssuming that it&#39;s important to know whether a test failed because of an\nassert of an unexpected exception (a dubious proposition in the first place\nsince when a test fails, you are going to check out the stack trace anyway\nand find out exactly where it failed), it would certainly have been better\nto name them differently.\n\n&lt;and&gt;\n\nThis is certainly an improvement over the current JUnit behavior, but I\nstill find that:\n\n101 TESTS, 1 FAILURE, 100 SKIPPED\n\nis much clearer...\n\n\n\n",
