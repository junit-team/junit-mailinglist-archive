We wrapped it.  Yes, we had system tests, but in order to test \n&gt; our logic independently, we pretty much had to wrap it.\n\nI don&#39;t want the tests to be independent of the libraries they depend \non. I want them to depend on exactly what the code depends on: no more; \nno less. That way you find bugs in the boundaries between model classes \nand libraries as well as in the model classes and libraries themselves.\n\n&gt;&gt; Now if the library had a legitimate need to create documents in memory \n&gt;&gt; for reasons other than testing, then I would add such functions. However \n&gt;&gt; I wouldn&#39;t do it just for testing.\n&gt;&gt;  \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; The fact is, testing is a legitmate need.  Designing for testability is \n&gt; simply good engineering.\n&gt; \n\nThe tail is wagging the dog. Testing is done to support the project. It \nis not the project, and it should not control the project. I am willing \nto consider that a library might need to adjust itself to enable client \napplications to test *themselves* (Testing the library is the library \nvendor&#39;s responsibility) but I still haven&#39;t seen a detailed, worked out \nexample demonstrating how a library might prevent client applications \nfrom testing themselves. Pithy sayings are well and good; but they need \nto be backed up by case studies with enough detail to allow them to be \nindependently verified.\n\nI&#39;ll keep an eye out for such a case in the future, but I don;t recall \never noticing one. I do recall numerous examples where I had trouble \ntesting code that wasn&#39;t intended to be used as a library in the first \nplace. However in all cases I can think of the problems that prevented \ntesting also prevented library usage. The problems were in no way unique \nto testability, nor did you have to resort to testability to justify \nfixing the problems,\n\n-- \n﻿Elliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nJava I/O 2nd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeaulait.org/books/javaio2/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596527500/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/\n\n",
