They don&#39;t fully test the class.\n\nBut they could. Junit does not ensure all scenarios are covered, and tests\nwritten in main methods can be better than tests written with Junit.\nThe original poster wanted to know how to convince people to use junit, but\nthose people seem to :\n1)already write unit tests\n2) &quot;get it&quot;\n\nSo, my opinion is that your use the junit framework to:\n\nA-have a standard way of writing and *running* tests. If each developer has\nit&#39;s own little main class, how does one know how to invoke it, where it is,\nhow to check for ouput. Of course, they can all be written the same way,\nstored at the same place, and all return a exit code to indicate\nsuccess/failure let&#39;s say. But why bother to establish such standards when\nusing junit gives you all that by default (there is test collectors written\nfor junit).  With junit, I feel it&#39;s easier for someone to say : &quot;I want to\nrun all the unit tests of our project before checking-in&quot; like XP mandates.\nThus, your coworkers gain the ability to easily run the tests of the other\nworkers.\n\nB-It helps automating the process, towards a true &quot;continuous integration&quot;.\nAnt has already defined tasks for Junit.\n\nC-Some stuff often used when testing is in the junit framework. It saves you\ntime to not have to write your own assert, etc..\n\nD-Extension packages : we are starting to see a lot of extensions to junit,\nintegration with IDE, etc. These are nice to have and altought they\ncertainly could be used without junit, it&#39;s even simpler with it.\n\nE-Gaining some experience with a tool that is more and more becoming the\nstandard for writing unit test in java is a good opportunity. Your coworkers\nshould at least try it.\n\nBut why do YOU want them to use junit? What is your gain?\n\nIf they already have a nice working setup, maybe there is not point in\nswitching...\n\nmathieu\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: Jason Rogers\nTo: &#39;junit@yahoogroups.com&#39;\nSent: Monday, June 11, 2001 8:58 AM\nSubject: RE: [junit] Why bother?\n\n\n\n    &gt; 2) My experience is that most people will write a main\n    &gt; that does NOT\n    &gt; automatically say, &quot;yes, I passed all my tests&quot;.
