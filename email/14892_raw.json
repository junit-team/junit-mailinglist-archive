It doesn&#39;t. To Java, files are byte sequences, nothing more.\n\n&gt; The program says &quot;read [or write] the next K bytes down this\n&gt; stream&quot;. If &quot;this stream&quot; happened to be connected to a record-\n&gt; oriented file, Java should do exactly what the program says -\n&gt; which is to invoke the filing-system call appropriate to writing \n&gt; to that file, I would have thought, not just splattering the\n&gt; bytes randomly into the file&#39;s blocks.\n\nNothing&#39;s random. It puts the data where the program says to put the \ndata, but it always treats the file as a sequence of bytes. Every API in \nJava for file access--FileInputStream, RandomAccessFile, FileChannel, \netc.--sees the file as a contiguous sequence of bytes. Any notion of \nrecord boundary is in the application logic, not the Java library.\n\n&gt; [Which is why Jena&#39;s RDF/XML writer uses line.separator at a\n&gt;  critical point; we had been generating RDF/XML that some \n&gt;  application running on Windows Did Not Like. Having the user\n&gt;  change it to a Modern Application wasn&#39;t an option.]\n\nYou may not realize it, but this risks creating malformed XML when your \nlibrary is used on certain IBM platforms. These things happen when you \nwrite to platform defaults that can be in active conflict with the \nrequirements of the format or protocol you&#39;re writing.\n\n-- \n﻿Elliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nXML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim\n\n",
