It was just <br/>\ntoo fragile, and every time I set things up I got that annoying error <br/>\nabout the classpath, which seems to be saying &quot;it is your fault, and <br/>\nyou&#39;re an idiot, so don&#39;t bother us&quot;. Once I made my own test suite as <br/>\na static instance, managed the TestResult object myself and added a <br/>\nTestListener instance, a whole bunch of this stuff became much, much <br/>\neasier.<br/>\n<br/>\nIncluding this.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe TestListener instance has access to every test as it is run. So, at <br/>\nthat point, you can have something you log, however much of it you <br/>\nwant. One can even have an external source of information at that <br/>\npoint. We have a database of our tests and I can query that in the <br/>\nTestListener and annotate the results with whatever stuff I want.<br/>\n<br/>\nI frankly do not know whether junitreport can do these things. But it <br/>\njust puts out html. I can do that well enough myself, once i have the <br/>\ninformation.<br/>\n<br/>\n- ray<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Aug 16, 2004, at 9:44 AM, valerie_abelin wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m using Ant to run junit and junitreport.  I like the HTML output<br/>\n&gt;  that junitreport generates, but I am wondering if it is possible to<br/>\n&gt;  include more javadoc/comments in the output rather than just the<br/>\n&gt;  success/failure status and time the test took to run.  It would be<br/>\n&gt;  great if junitreport could include a comment from the source code<br/>\n&gt;  about what each test means.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>",
