It means, for\n&gt; &gt; example, that various strings cannot be constants.\n&gt;\n&gt; Au contraire. Java&#39;s right. C&#39;s wrong. In Java you know a &#92;n is a\n&gt; linefeed. No if&#39;s, and&#39;s, or but&#39;s. \n\nI don&#39;t mind having a `linefeed` character. I do mind not having\na notation for `the end of the line, however it&#39;s supposed to\nhappen in this streamlike thing that I am writing down`.\n\n&gt; This means when you&#39;re writing or\n&gt; reading a protocol or network file format that specifies a linefeed, you\n&gt; know what you&#39;re getting. You can depend on it. \n\nThat&#39;s fine and I have no quarrel with it. \n\n&gt; In 2005 there is no good\n&gt; reason to change the line separator to match some imagined platform\n&gt; default.\n\nI&#39;m not asking for that. I&#39;m asking for a notation for end-of-line;\nit&#39;s not the same thing. You may have a case that such a thing\ncannot plausibly be provided.\n\n&gt; All reasonable text editors can handle &#92;r, &#92;n, or &#92;r&#92;n. \n\nThat depends on what you mean by &quot;handle&quot; and &quot;reasonable&quot;. \n(I use a text editor which I suspect you would classify differently\nthan I would.) \n\n&gt; Many\n&gt; protocols and file formats specify one or the other of these. For\n&gt; instance HTTP headers MUST be terminated with &#92;r&#92;n. &#92;n and &#92;r alone are\n&gt; incorrect (though many clients are liberal in what they accept). This is\n&gt; regardless of platform or OS.\n\nYes, that one has always puzzled me too.\n\n&gt; We live in a multiplatform, multi-OS, multilingual world. Platform\n&gt; defaults of all kinds are harmful. Data must not be tied to one type of\n&gt; computer or operating system. We need multiplatform, multilingual,\n&gt; multilocale data.\n\nWe live in a multiplatform world in which different platforms\nhave different conventions for what counts as a &quot;line&quot; in a &quot;text\nfile&quot;. I&#39;d prefer to be able to write a &quot;text output stream&quot; without\nhaving to jump through hoops to separate one line from the next\nin my text strings. Similarly I&#39;d like to be able to read &quot;lines&quot;\nfrom a &quot;text file&quot; without having to dither about how those lines\nare separated.\n\nPerhaps I&#39;m just recklessly optimistic.\n\n-- \nChris &quot;all the diodes down my left side&quot; Dollin\nThe software engineer&#39;s song: &quot;who knows where the time goes&quot;.\n\n\n",
