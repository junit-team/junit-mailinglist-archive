Whether the tests are simple (one assertion per test) or c=\r\nomplex is an\northogonal issue.\n\nThis feature request has come up a few time=\r\ns on the TestNG mailing-list as\nwell, and I have sometimes felt this need o=\r\nccasionally myself.\n\nThink of it as another granularity level of insight in=\r\nside your tests:  if\nyou want the big picture, you look at the HTML reports=\r\n.  If you want the\nfine picture, you look at the source.  And if you want s=\r\nomething in-between\n(&quot;are we making sure the collection is the right size?&quot;=\r\n), you could use this\nhypothetical assert log without the source noise.\n\n--=\r\n \nC=E9dric\n\n\nOn Mon, Jun 9, 2008 at 3:30 PM, J.

Yes, many p=\r\neople have said they want\nto log assertions in tests because they want the =\r\nwarm fuzzy feedback\nthat their tests are running and assertion what they th=\r\nink they are\nasserting. Logging is just one, and in my opinion a bad, way t=\r\no do\nthis. I believe it is much better to write simpler tests.\n&gt; 1) elimina=\r\nting redundant logging statements - Many logging statements\n&gt; in a JUnit te=\r\nst case simply output information that you&#39;ve already\n&gt; told JUnit about in=\r\n your assertions. Developers often put these in as\n&gt; a &#39;sanity check&#39; to ve=\r\nrify that the test is doing what they expected.\n&gt;\nIf your tests need such a=\r\n sanity check, then I believe they should be\nsimpler.\n&gt; 2) improving assert=\r\nion messages - it&#39;s often the case that the\n&gt;\n&gt; first time you see the mess=\r\nage for an assertion will be when the\n&gt; assertion fails, which may not happ=\r\nen until you run a regression test\n&gt; many moons after you coded the test. U=\r\nnless you see the message\n&gt; displayed when you are developing the test, you=\r\n won&#39;t realize that the\n&gt; message - if you provided one - is not be very he=\r\nlpful. Better\n&gt; assertion messages also help to communicate to a developer =\r\nwhat the\n&gt; point of the assertion is both when it fails and when reading th=\r\ne\n&gt; test.\n&gt;\nIf you aren&#39;t going to think about the failure message when you=\r\n write\nit, then don&#39;t write one.\n&gt; 3) see finer-grain test results. Every a=\r\nssertion is a mini-test on its\n&gt; own, but JUnit these mini-tests are invisi=\r\nble until they fail.\n&gt;\nAbsolutely not. Assertions are not mini-tests. A tes=\r\nt is a test. If\nyou have multiple unrelated assertions in a test, then move=\r\n them into\ntheir own tests. This leads to a number of benefits (more accura=\r\nte\ntest count metrics, more information when a test fails, easier to\nisolat=\r\ne the cause of a failure).\n&gt; 4) by making logging easy, it can help to avoi=\r\nd the\n&gt; using-system-outs-instead-of-asserts syndrome, where new junit test=\r\n\n&gt; writers will write &quot;test cases&quot; that actually just write a bunch of\n&gt; st=\r\nuff to the console that the test writer then eyeballs for expected\n&gt; result=\r\ns\n&gt;\nWhy would anyone use JUnit to spit things out to the console? If they\nw=\r\nant output on the console, and they&#39;re not just using that as a way\nto lear=\r\nn to use JUnit, then they shouldn&#39;t use JUnit.\n&gt; There are some problems wi=\r\nth logging assertions that I have\n&gt; encountered:\n&gt;\n&gt; 1) if iterating over a=\r\n collection and asserting each element, your log\n&gt; can be overwhelmed. Mayb=\r\ne it would be useful to have some way of\n&gt; hinting that a particular assert=\r\nion should not create notifications;\n&gt; maybe not.\n&gt;\nI don&#39;t even want to th=\r\nink about how slowly tests will run, and how\nmuch time I would waste decidi=\r\nng which tests should log what and when.\nIt&#39;s much easier just to add loggi=\r\nng where I want it.\n&gt; Is there any appetite out there for adding assertion =\r\nlogging (or\n&gt; assertion notification) into the junit 4 framework? I would b=\r\ne\n&gt; happy to do the work if I thought it would be accepted into the\n&gt; main =\r\njunit distribution. Or maybe this capability already exists\n&gt; in some way i=\r\nn junit 4 that I am not aware of?\n&gt;\nYes, there is such an appetite, but I h=\r\nope there is a bigger appetite\nnot to include it.\n----\nJ.
