When\n&gt; using code coverage tools on test code I&#39;ve found tests that weren&#39;t\n&gt; being executed due to incorrect naming conventions, asserts that weren&#39;t\n&gt; reached due to bad logic, and vestigial code I no longer needed that\n&gt; could be deleted. There normally won&#39;t be as much untested code in the\n&gt; test suite as their is in the main body of code. However there&#39;s usually\n&gt; some; and, while some of it are fail() statements and the like that you\n&gt; don&#39;t want to be reached, some of it is significant and requires a repair.\n\nThose are good points. I suppose I /wish/ I were on a project whose \nworst problem was code coverage in the tests! It&#39;s a good goal to go for.\n-- \nJ. B.
