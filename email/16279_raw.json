I hope you don&#39;t mind if I use almost the same exact\nwords in some other similar situations.\n\nStart of pontification\n\nThis is a generic issue. I have had similar conversations while reviewing\nOracle PL/SQL code. They went &quot;private happy&quot;. The standard conversation has\nthe format\n\nMe: What would be the down side of making ... public ?\n\nReply: Someone might use it.\n\nMe: Why would this be bad ? If the ... is properly documented there would be\nno issues.\n\nReply: This means that I would have to write more documentation.\n\nMe: That is a decision you have to make. Extra doco allows for more explicit\ntesting. Is it worth it ? Only you can make that decision.\n\nEnd of pontification\n  -----Original Message-----\n  From: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com]On Behalf Of J.\nB. Rainsberger\n  Sent: Monday, March 06, 2006 1:02 PM\n  To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n  Subject: Re: [junit] testing switch statements in method\n\n\n  Kamal Ahmed wrote:\n\n  &gt; Since this is an API, The contracts and design cannot change to suite\njunit,\n  &gt; hence I cannot change the visibility\n\n  I hear this a lot. My attitude has always been the same: if it &quot;cannot&quot;\n  change, then I guess the people involved don&#39;t think it very important\n  to test it.\n\n  By the way, this is not a JUnit limitation. It&#39;s a Java limitation.\n  Since the method is protected, a TestCase in the same /package/ would be\n  able to invoke it directly. Again, this is not a JUnit limitation, it&#39;s\n  the way Java works.\n\n  One of the unavoidable facts of testing (any kind of testing) existing\n  code is that much code is designed in a way that makes testing difficult\n  or expensive. If you want to test it effectively, it will have to start\n  changing.\n\n  Elliotte Harold is the poster boy (and I mean that in a good way!) for\n  having both a minimal API and well-tested code. I don&#39;t feel quite as\n  strongly about having a minimal API, but then I don&#39;t publish libraries\n  much, so I don&#39;t have external motivation to care as much about it. He\n  has shown that you /can/ have both, but you probably can&#39;t get there\n  without making some changes to existing APIs.\n\n  So it&#39;s your choice: which do you value more? The API as it is now, or\n  writing good tests? If you value the first one more, you&#39;ll have to\n  settle for longer, more brittle, more expensive tests. That&#39;s a judgment\n  only your team can make.\n  --\n  J. B.
