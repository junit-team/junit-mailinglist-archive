To improve my development \nskills an=\r\nd my JUnit skills, I am writing some JUnit tests.  Today, I \nfound that the=\r\n developer had implemented System.exit(n) throughout \nthe application whene=\r\nver there was a trapped exception.\n\nNow, the requirements call for the appl=\r\nication to return some exit \ncode telling any downstream processes whether =\r\nthis application was \n100% successful with no warnings (rc=3D0), 100% succe=\r\nssful with \nwarnings (rc=3D4), not successful at all (rc=3D8).  However, th=\r\ne only \njava mechanism for reporting return codes is System.exit(n), based =\r\non \nmy use of Google.\n\nMy JUnit dilemma then, is that System.exit(n) gives =\r\nthe required \napplication behavior but doesn&#39;t seem to be good for running =\r\nJUnit \ntests from a test suite since System.exit(n) ends the JVM.\n\nDoes any=\r\none have any insights they can share?  Since this is my first \npost to this=\r\n forum, I&#39;m happy to Google some more if you&#39;ll only give \nme some keyword =\r\nhint(s) beyond what I&#39;ve already tried:  &quot;java exit \ncode&quot;.\n\nThanks!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n=\r\n\n",
