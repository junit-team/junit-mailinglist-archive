IF you don&#39;t have <br/>\n&gt; side effects and<br/>\n&gt; IF you have decoupled code then I cannot see where <br/>\n&gt; dependencies between T(A)<br/>\n&gt; and T(B) make sense. A usually does not depend directly on B but on an<br/>\n&gt; abstract interface - B just being an implementation of that interface.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I agree as long as A is not a subclass of B. If A and B are simply two different objects then I tend to test them in independent environments. If A simply needs to create object B because it gets information from that object there are other ways to do this - plus that starts a slippery slope of munging unit tests with integration tests.<br/>\n\tHowever, if A is a subclass of B then I would like a quick way to say that if B fails then don&#39;t run those tests in A that require a working B, but still run other tests against A that don&#39;t make direct calls to B. It would simply make the error tracing a bit easier and avoid running tests that I know are going to fail.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nChip<br/>\n-----<br/>\nProgramming: Its not just a job - its an indenture</div>",
