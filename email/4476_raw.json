JUnit won&#39;t do that.\n\nIn testing against the KVM, we found all kinds of J2ME-specific things that\nwe needed to change.\n\nIf you need to startup your MIDlet to test pieces of your application, might\nI suggest that your application might be too closely tied to your\nimplementation platform? The same design logic applies to MIDlets as it does\nto any sort of GUI application. Keep your business logic separate from your\npresentation logic. This lets you test your business logic without having to\nset up all the context stuff that MIDlets need. This is the same thing I\nrecommend and do when I write applets, servlets, etc. If you make those\nclasses dumb, then you can test the rest of your system without them. And\nyou also have a lot more flexibility in how you deploy your business logic,\nas it is not tied to a particular platorm implementation.\n\nWe actually did what you said, and had J2MEUnit start up inside a MIDlet\nwhich we ran on one of the emulators. But, we were still testing out the\nbusiness logic of our system, not the MIDlet itself.\n\nbab\n\n---\nBrian Button             bbutton@...\nSenior Consultant    http://www.objectmentor.com\nObject Mentor, Inc.\n\nExtreme Programming in St. Louis http://groups.yahoo.com/group/xpstl\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &quot;Roland Kofler&quot; &lt;roland_kofler@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;junit@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Wednesday, March 27, 2002 11:16 AM\nSubject: AW: [junit] j2me unit testing\n\n\n&gt; Brian Button wrote:\n&gt; &gt;What we did, and as I recommend to my clients, is to separate out the\n&gt; &gt;plumbing logic (the MIDlet) from the business logic. Have the MIDlet\n&gt; &gt;create and call the business logic, but keep that creation logic\n&gt; &gt;really simple. Put all the complexity into the business logic classes,\n&gt; &gt;which are a lot easier to test.\n&gt;\n&gt; But, why use j2meUnit then? if you test only the &quot;non midp specific&quot; logic\n&gt; you can also relay on JUnit.\n&gt; I found it very easy to modify the test suit to run as midlet on an\n&gt; emulator, now you can use the textui to assert RMS operations etc.\n&gt;\n&gt; I recommend to invoke testsuites from midlets added to your suite, on\ndeploy\n&gt; you can easly remove them.\n&gt;\n&gt; regards roland kofler\n\n\n\n",
