    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-57608401\">Joe,<br/>\n<br/>\nThe code that loads the file and builds the model is<br/>\nalready in a public api (Eclipse EMF API).<br/>\n<br/>\nThus the private method uses the public api to load<br/>\nand build the model, which is a XMI document.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, the model component and the factory<br/>\ncomponents are specific to the method that load the<br/>\nfile.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo it&#39;s possible to make the pojo cleaner by using<br/>\naspects and such to separate out some concerns, but at<br/>\nthe end of the day you have to ask &quot;Am I really making<br/>\nthis more manageable?&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo in this case we have the following:<br/>\n<br/>\n- A public API that loads a resource and builds the<br/>\nmodel<br/>\n- The same API was used to generate model classes and<br/>\nthe factory components that create the model objects.<br/>\n- These are used by the public API again to load the<br/>\nmodel and create the root model instance.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo since these parts are so interrelated it makes<br/>\nsense to put them in a private method and test that<br/>\nmethod.  This method is specific to the type of model<br/>\ngenerated by EMF.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Use Case for using the model is for 1 POJO only,<br/>\nso breaking out the load code to separate concerns<br/>\nadds questionable value in terms of manageability.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the end of the day, I just wanted to make sure the<br/>\nprivate method was working as an intermediate step to<br/>\ndoing a test of the public api, which is probably what<br/>\nmost people want to do when they test private methods.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\n- Ole<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- &quot;J.

Loading file contents into memory, usually as<br/>\n&gt; lines of text.<br/>\n&gt; 2. Parsing the lines of text while in memory.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Part #1 is a perfect candidate for a reusable<br/>\n&gt; library. In Ruby, you <br/>\n&gt; simply say file.readlines(), for example. There&#39;s no<br/>\n&gt; reason to <br/>\n&gt; reimplement this the way we do in Java. (Does Java 5<br/>\n&gt; have a built-in <br/>\n&gt; library method for loading a text file yet?!)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Part #2 is what&#39;s specific to your application,<br/>\n&gt; because it depends on <br/>\n&gt; how you formatted the text when you saved it. I<br/>\n&gt; could see that being a <br/>\n&gt; private method, perhaps, that takes a List of lines<br/>\n&gt; and parses them.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So it might be that the only reason the &quot;loading&quot;<br/>\n&gt; feature is not <br/>\n&gt; reusable is that Java hasn&#39;t made the reusable part<br/>\n&gt; reusable!<br/>\n&gt; -- <br/>\n&gt; J.
