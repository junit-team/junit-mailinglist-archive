(Hence Test-Driven Development.)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; IME it&#39;s a bidirectional dependency: The currently failing test <br/>\n&gt; drives the implementation. When the test runs, the incomplete <br/>\n&gt; implementation drives the next test.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I agree with that.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; The best tests are ones that:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; * Test everything that could possibly break in the current<br/>\n&gt; implementation<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This is obviously implementation dependend, isn&#39;t it?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You need at least one implementaiton to know what you are testing<br/>\nfor.  In my world, it is Contract dependant.  But I agree with the<br/>\ngeneral statement.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; [...]<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I find my life difficult when my tests get in the way of my <br/>\n&gt; &gt; refactorings... tests that have intimate knowledge of the <br/>\n&gt; implementation tend <br/>\n&gt; &gt; to be refactoring-resistant. I tend away from them if I can.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; And that is probably wise. But even if you strive to avoid a &quot;how-<br/>\n&gt; dependency&quot; between tests and implementation, do you also avoid <br/>\n&gt; a &quot;what-dependency&quot;? That is, if you try to think about missing test <br/>\n&gt; cases, don&#39;t you take a look at the current implementation???<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Of course.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; How do you decide what tests are sufficient for a sort(String[]) <br/>\n&gt; method?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You start with the obvious ones.  If you think to much about what<br/>\ncould possibly go wrong you have the testing equivalent of analysis<br/>\nparalysis.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is an iterative thing--both the implementaiton and the test evolve.<br/>\nIf that evolution breaks a test, you have to decide if the test is<br/>\nat fault or (more probably) the implementation is at fault.  You evolve<br/>\nthe test as you find different essoteric parameters that the current<br/>\nimplementation fails on.  That way you have a _regression_ testing<br/>\nthat works.</div>",
