There&#39;s nothing in the <br/>\n&gt; contract of the JUnit test case that guarantees that <br/>\n&gt; instances are not pooled, so JUnit 5.0, for example, could <br/>\n&gt; decide to pool instances of test case. At that point, you&#39;d <br/>\n&gt; have to change your code.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Since you mentioned NUnit, I&#39;d like to clarify. NUnit simply creates one<br/>\ninstance of the test class for use in all tests. I associate the term<br/>\n&quot;pooling&quot; with taking objects out of and returning them to a pool of some<br/>\nkind. We do nothing like that.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe distinction between guaranteed behavior and incidental behavior is a<br/>\nreally important one for any test framework. In NUnit, the SetUp versus<br/>\nconstructor question doesn&#39;t arise, but there&#39;s an equivalent one about<br/>\nTestFixtureSetUp versus constructor that comes up all the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nCharlie</div>",
