I would like to have\nquickly an overv=\r\niew of the test of the selected object.\nFor example in eclipse, we can have=\r\n an overview of a class that we are\nusing.  We should have similar shortcut=\r\n to view the tests (maybe with\nsome descriptions?)\n\n \nA second area concern=\r\ns the creation of test values.  In some domain,\nit is not unusual to have f=\r\nunctions taking very &#39;long&#39; value object as\ninput.  Some might argue that i=\r\nt should be avoided, but it is not\nalways possible.  A good example where t=\r\nhat can&#39;t be avoided is the\ntest of business rules in the insurance domain.=\r\n  An insurance contract\ncontains really a lot of data, and the business rul=\r\nes often use\ntotally unrelated part of the contract.\nFor such a case, I wou=\r\nld like to have a very simple editor to easily\nedit the test value and stor=\r\ne them into a file.  I think that some\nadapted &quot;bean editors&quot; could do that=\r\n, but I don&#39;t know if anybody has\nalready experiment this aproach.\n\n \nFinal=\r\nly, my last &quot;dream&quot; is probably much less clear than the two\nprevious point=\r\ns, and certainly more complex.\nI would like to see TDD colaborates with des=\r\nign by contract to give an\nintermediate aproach taking the best of the two =\r\nworld.\nI would like to be able to define somehow the contract of an\ninterfa=\r\nce, and I would like to have this contract validated when I run\nthe test, a=\r\nnd that even when I stub or mock the object.  I&#39;m convinced\nthat would allo=\r\nw to write more powerful tests that would be less brillant.\nAnd ho, I forgo=\r\nt! My dream is to see that in java. :-)\n\n\nRegards,\nGilles\n\n--- In junit@yah=\r\noogroups.com, &quot;Kent Beck&quot; &lt;kentb@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; One thing missing from th=\r\ne discussion was much talk about the hopes and\n&gt; dreams of users, so I thou=\r\nght I would open up the question here.\nWhat is it\n&gt; you wish your testing t=\r\nool would do for you that it doesn&#39;t?\n\n\n\n",
