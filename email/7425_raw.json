Also, what is done about the &#39;bloat&#39; that is added \nto classes by test code?  (mainly when inner classes are used to \nfacilitate testing).  I don&#39;t care about it in the development \nenvironment, but if my application is to be downloaded and there are \nmegabytes of embedded test code it can become an issue.  (So far my \ncode is a small fraction of the download, so this isn&#39;t an issue - yet)\n\nAnother comment:\nI&#39;ve been trying to get started with the unit testing and have been \nencouraging other&#39;s in my company to try it too, but I can&#39;t get any \nbuy-in. I&#39;m finding it difficult to get started so I don&#39;t really have \na convincing argument for it other than &quot;I&#39;ve read that it is a great \nthing&quot; :), obviously if I can make it work for me it would help.   It&#39;s \ngood to hear that others have had the same issues and have gotten past \nthem.   The examples make it look so simple and easy...\n\nOn Wednesday, April 2, 2003, at 12:46 AM, Levi Cook \n&lt;levicook@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; On Tuesday, April 1, 2003, at 02:07  PM, swpalmer2001 wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Or is this unit testing just a passing fad that is\n&gt;&gt; really nothing more than a bunch of hype?\n&gt;\n&gt; PS&gt; Despite your opening disclaimer this sounds a little like trolling\n&gt; :)\n&gt;\nYes, it does (sorry).. My intention was to get a feel for how many \npeople out there have been down this road and concluded that it wasn&#39;t \nall that it was promised to be.
