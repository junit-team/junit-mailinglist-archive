If you have a large project to maintain, \ndon&#39;t write tons of tests only to have your project in the same state as \nif it would have been if written from scratch with the tf principles in \nmind.  If you do so, I think you are &quot;blinded&quot; by your &quot;love&quot; for the \ntest-first principles.\n\nBut I never said that the test-first principles are bad for an already \ndeveloped project.  You only have to keep your head cool and avoid the \nrush.  For me, generating tests is a symptom of this rush (&quot;let&#39;s \nquickly have 2,000 tests written for our project&quot;).  If 99% of your \nproject is already working, why should you first start by writing tests \nfor 100% of your code.  Concentrate your effort on the 1% that doesn&#39;t work.\n\nOne principle of XProgramming is &quot;YAGNI&quot;: so don&#39;t write tests until you \nneed them.  And keep in mind that the goal is not to write tons of \ntests, but to validate your code.\n\n-Vladimir\n\n-- \nVladimir Bossicard\nwww.bossicard.com\n\n\n",
