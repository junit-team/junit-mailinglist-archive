This test would fail. That&#39;s 1 failure.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe setUp() method for the other 100 tests throws<br/>\nexceptions. These aren&#39;t expected, so they are errors.<br/>\nThat&#39;s 100 errors. So, you get:<br/>\n<br/>\n101 TESTS, 101 RAN, 1 FAILURE, 100 ERRORS<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, to get this you need:<br/>\n1) A test runner that will report in this format. :) Most<br/>\ndon&#39;t, but they will give equivalent information.<br/>\n2) Test structures setup accordingly - you need to have that<br/>\ntest outside of the first test case that will fail rather<br/>\nthan error.</div>",
