    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1930623175\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt;So said Adam Jack on 2003-07-30 --------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;      &gt;Actually, Bertrand Russell contended that from an incorrect<br/>\n&gt;hypothesis any<br/>\n&gt;      &gt;conclusion can be proven, which has corrolary that all conclusions<br/>\n&gt;are<br/>\n&gt;      &gt;therefore invalid. Hey, my conclusion could be the right one<br/>\n&gt;irrespective.<br/>\n&gt;      &gt;;-)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;      How is that different from what I wrote?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;You said &quot;hypothesis is false therefore all conclusions are false&quot;, not<br/>\n&gt;true. Bertrand said &quot;hypothesis is false, so all conclusions are provable&quot;.<br/>\n&gt;That doesn&#39;t make them all false, nor mine meaningless, just not certain.<br/>\n&gt;Mine might&#39;ve been right however I started, perhaps plain luck. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Please be more careful. This is exactly what I wrote, copied and pasted.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Since your hypothesis is wrong, your conclusion is not meaningful. :) (That&#39;s logic&#39;s fault, not mine.)&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&lt;snip/&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;          Like hell. I&#39;ve proposed a solution to you a number of times.<br/>\n&gt;     Why don&#39;t       you  listen to it?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I listened, I totally absorbed what you said, I just didn&#39;t buy it. Heck,<br/>\n&gt;who knows ... maybe you weren&#39;t right.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What didn&#39;t you buy? What I described is exactly what you need. The only difference is whether you build it and leave it out of the framework or you build it and convince the authors to include it in the framework. Either way, it&#39;s your solution to write. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I write code, I test my code, I debug my code when tests fail by trying to<br/>\n&gt;analyse the output. I was hoping for it to be easier to analyse, w/o a lot<br/>\n&gt;of manual effort, but I don&#39;t have an itch big enough to attempt to write<br/>\n&gt;such a tool -- especially when it&#39;d be cheap/clean to do it in the<br/>\n&gt;framework.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Are you kidding? Cheap/clean?<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease sketch your solution in the framework so that we can examine how cheap and clean it is. If it is indeed cheap and clean, I&#39;ll support it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Also, much as I could craft some sort of add on (perhaps<br/>\n&gt;leverage<br/>\n&gt;my own sub-class from TestCase) I think it needs too much of what is in the<br/>\n&gt;framework in order to work well, and I don&#39;t fancy re-writing the thing.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Don&#39;t think; tell. Sketch the solution. I&#39;ve already sketched one; it&#39;s your turn.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I use eclipse, I use ant -- I like the integration into those tools more<br/>\n&gt;than I like my idea. If I can&#39;t get you to contemplate the concept, then I<br/>\n&gt;probably have little chance of persuading them. If they don&#39;t use it, I<br/>\n&gt;won&#39;t benefit. Another reason not to start.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Once again, your hypothesis is incorrect. You assume that I didn&#39;t consider your suggestion before I decided against it. That&#39;s arrogant.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;This was my first topic on this mailing list, and much as you were pretty<br/>\n&gt;measured/polite (at least at the start) I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be back for<br/>\n&gt;more.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s a shame.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Open Source is (IMHO) about open minded discussion of ideas, and I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;think I found that here. No worries, have fun w/ what you do.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s your perception. Do you often believe that contrarian positions necessarily come from closed-minded people? or do you grant the possibility that an open-minded person may consider your point of view, decide on a different solution and propose it instead?<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJ.
