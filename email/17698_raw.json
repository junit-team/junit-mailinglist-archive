When you&#39;re an API writer, it behoo=\r\nves you to make your\n&gt; library\n&gt; &gt; general enough that it can be used for c=\r\nases you didn&#39;t envision, or\n&gt; you&#39;ll\n&gt; &gt; make the life of your users harde=\r\nr\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m sorry, but I flat out disagree. You should put in what is current=\r\nly\n&gt; needed, no more. Do not try to support use cases you do not envision a=\r\nnd\n&gt; do not understand. The bottom line is that if you leave something out,=\r\n\n&gt; you can always add it later. However, once you&#39;ve shipped API it becomes=\r\n\n&gt; impossible to take it away\n\n\nExactly, which is exactly why you should be=\r\n humble when you ship your code\nand open it up.  Assume that people will us=\r\ne it in ways you didn&#39;t think of,\nand make it possible for them to do so in=\r\n ways that you control (always an\ninteresting exercise, by the way, it forc=\r\nes you to think out of the box and\nto break your habits).\n\nMichael showed a=\r\n pretty compelling case where the vendor forgot to make\ntheir methods virtu=\r\nal, and I&#39;ve seen this mistake and more general ones so\nmany times in dozen=\r\ns of API&#39;s and libraries I wish people locked down their\ncode a lot less.\n\n=\r\nReal life example:  a programmer on my team once had to do &quot;#define private=\r\n\npublic&quot; in order to use a certain functionality.  There was simply no othe=\r\nr\nchoice.  That&#39;s exactly what I meant above by &quot;keeping control&quot;: if you o=\r\npen\nyour code in ways that you choose, you, the library author, remain in\nc=\r\nontrol and remove the need for this kind of ugly hack.\n\n\nAdding functionali=\r\nty without a clear use case is a recipe for bloated\n&gt; APIs that don&#39;t work =\r\nparticularly well.\n\n\nI don&#39;t see why, if they are carefully designed.  Docu=\r\nment the extension\npoints, and draw a clear line between what is exposed an=\r\nd will be supported\nand what might change from one release to the next.\n\nWi=\r\nthout this mindset, frameworks such as Spring or Eclipse would never\nexist.=\r\n\n\n\n&gt; Same thing if your API will be reading data:  make it possible for thi=\r\ns\n&gt; data\n&gt; &gt; to come from virtually any possible source:  file, stream, ite=\r\nrator,\n&gt; &gt; network, database, etc...\n&gt;\n&gt; In Java this is usually no big dea=\r\nl because it&#39;s all just streams (or\n&gt; readers). There&#39;s enough abstraction =\r\nbuilt into the core libraries to\n&gt; handle this. How this tends to work in C=\r\n++, I don&#39;t know.\n\n\nYes, the Java libraries support the &quot;open open principl=\r\ne&quot; very well in\njava.io, at the cost of some added verbosity (a small price=\r\n to pay in my\nopinion).\n\n-- \nC=C3=A9dric\nhttp://testng.org\n\n\n[Non-text port=\r\nions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
