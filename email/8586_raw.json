However, I disagree with the st=\r\natement - unless\n&gt;&gt;&gt;you got something other than your own experience to bac=\r\nk that statement\n&gt;up\n&gt;&gt;&gt;with.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;You disagree with what part: that it&#39;s a=\r\n time waster or that it&#39;s a &quot;top\n&gt;time waster&quot;?\n&gt;\n&gt;I disagree that it is &quot;a=\r\n top time waster&quot; as you stated.\n\nI can sink my teeth into this. Are you wi=\r\nlling to name, say, five bigger time wasters, according to your experience?=\r\n I&#39;m not trying to grill you, but I am interested in your perspective. I ca=\r\nn learn from it.\n\n&gt;&gt;As for &quot;something other than your own experience to bac=\r\nk that statement\n&gt;up with&quot;, what on\n&gt;&gt;Earth is more important than one&#39;s ex=\r\nperience?\n&gt;\n&gt;The experience of a collective is more important than the myop=\r\nic\n&gt;experience of an individual.\n\nNo argument there. You can agree, though,=\r\n that one&#39;s opinion is shaped most by one&#39;s direct experience, in spite of =\r\nwhat one may have read or heard.\n\n&gt;One person can only experience so much, =\r\nthus\n&gt;we produce studies and surveys and the like to draw upon the experien=\r\nce of\n&gt;many to understand things that might be anomalies. Do you have a sur=\r\nvey,\n&gt;study, or anything else that I can take to my management so that we c=\r\nan\n&gt;improve our own process other than &quot;some guy on a list says that\n&gt;docum=\r\nentation is a top time waster&quot;\n\nNo, I don&#39;t; but then, giving you ammunitio=\r\nn to take to your management was not my objective in writing the foregoing,=\r\n so it&#39;s reasonable that my response wouldn&#39;t factor that in, no?\n\nIncident=\r\nally, isn&#39;t a study simply what one guy did? My point is: when does it end?=\r\n You can discredit or simply choose not to believe any study I might put be=\r\nfore you. At some point, you choose either to believe or you don&#39;t. This is=\r\n why I don&#39;t knock myself out looking for studies. I listen to stories (tol=\r\nd campfire-style around the bar at conferences) and I observe what happens =\r\naround me. I find it more authentic.\n\nTake care.\n\n\nJ. B.
