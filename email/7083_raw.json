You\nare opening it up to that plus the contribution of\nmore tests by an independent source.  Of course you\nare right, that is the way to go.  I just didn&#39;t group\nthese outside tests under the &quot;TDD&quot; umbrella.\n\nI think J. B. makes a good distinction by not calling\nthem all &quot;unit tests&quot; but &quot;programmer tests&quot; and\n&quot;integration tests&quot;.  Again, this comes down to\nsemantics, and I can see independent testers\ncontributing to either type of test, though typically\nan organization defines their job as doing\nacceptance/integration tests.  But, you are probably\nright that they can and should contribute at the\nprogrammer tests level as well.\n\nOh, and I know your pain on management that is not\nreceptive to XP (or agile of any sort).  That is why I\ndo TDD; it is the one thing I can do independent of\nall other things.  I think coworkers notice, and see\nthe value of TDD as well, to some degree.  Maybe\nmanagement will some day too, and get curious as to\nother potential agile methods.\n\n--- Lauren Bish wrote:\n&gt; That is all true - but I didn&#39;t say that a dedicated\n&gt; unit tester&#39;s purpose\n&gt; was to replace TDD - what I said was that the\n&gt; dedicated unit tester helped\n&gt; in getting more and better tests earlier. A\n&gt; dedicated unit tester also helps\n&gt; introduce the concept and value of unit and early\n&gt; testing to teams,\n&gt; management, companies and developers. This helps get\n&gt; your foot in the door.\n&gt; You have to remember that there are a lot of\n&gt; companies out there that don&#39;t\n&gt; practice XP or even halfway decent practices, and\n&gt; you can&#39;t make them\n&gt; swallow XP or TDD all in one gulp. The purpose of\n&gt; any good practice is to\n&gt; improve the quality of software, but you can&#39;t\n&gt; accomplish that in one fell\n&gt; swoop.\n\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
