You can rely on nothing. You can no longer assume that objects do \n&gt;what you expect them to. Again, not all languages have this problem with \n&gt;interface-based designs; but Java does.  :-( \n&gt;\n\nThat&#39;s not strictly true, Elliotte.\n\nFirstly, if you&#39;ve got factories for your domain objects, you can verify \nthat your factories are used correctly, via coding conventions and \nanalysis tools (e.g. checkstyle). Testing your factories is pretty \nsimply, as a general rule. In general, factories tend to be safer to use \nthan constructors, anyway, so you actually gain from the factories.\n\nSecondly, you can&#39;t rely on objects to define behaviour in stone, \nanyway. Maybe someone came along and removed that pesky &quot;final&quot; keyword \n(either directly or via bytecode engineering). Or perhaps they&#39;ve simply \nswapped the class out with another one that matches the same interface. \nIn short, you can only rely on &quot;final&quot; to lock down behaviour if you&#39;re \nthe only one writing the source code.\n\nThirdly, interfaces define contracts. Implementations which do not \nconform to the contracts aren&#39;t socially responsible - you shouldn&#39;t \nbuild them that way. How do you make sure you build them right? Testing, \npeer reviews, and well-defined types.\n\nFinally: the very fact that you can change the implementation randomly \nis a benefit, not a problem. In particular, unit test code gains from \nbeing able to provide an arbitrary implementation of an interface that \nit just can&#39;t do with a class.\n\nIt sounds like you&#39;ve got some fairly serious trust issues about the \ncompetence and/or integrity of the developers you work with, if you&#39;re \ntrying to lock down their behaviour that tightly. Is that a fair assessment?\n\nRobert.\n\n\n\n",
