Does it sound like the right \nthing to do?  The tmp file solution may be more expedient.\n\n-Kevin\n\n\n\n--- In junit@y..., &quot;Michael Silverstein&quot; &lt;msilverstein@s...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; We do the following with Test Mentor (a commercial component testing \ntool),\n&gt; but you could probably extend JUnit in a similar way:\n&gt; \n&gt; We provide a sort of managed variable scheme within the context of \nan\n&gt; executing test, respective of scope (tests in Test Mentor can be \nrecursively\n&gt; defined, if you like), that&#39;s basically a bunch of \njava.util.Hashtables,\n&gt; each tied to a particular scoping level. These Hashtable values are\n&gt; accessible by APIs within the tool that resolve the correct value, \ndepending\n&gt; on the context of the executing test. The APIs  make it pretty \ntransparent,\n&gt; relying mostly on a test execution context stack that tracks \nwhichever\n&gt; Hashtable should be active at the moment. The APIs (which any test \ninherits)\n&gt; look something like getLocalVar(name) and setLocalVar(name,value). \nSo you\n&gt; could instantiate/execute a test that sets variables, which then\n&gt; instantiates/exeuctes another test within it that may or may not set\n&gt; variables with the same name, and the tool will handle variable name \nscope\n&gt; resolution automatically.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n&gt; Mike Silverstein, Lead Architect\tvoice:  (919) 858-8300 x29\n&gt; SilverMark, Inc.\t\t\tfax:    (919) 858-8308\n&gt; 5511 Capital Center Drive\t\tmobile: (919) 669-5906\n&gt; Suite 510, Raleigh, NC 27606\t\ttoll free: (888) 588-0668\n&gt; http://www.silvermark.com\t\tmsilverstein@s...\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; &gt; From: kconnor@i...

If \nso,\n&gt; &gt; how did you accomplish it?  It could be written to a file but that\n&gt; &gt; seems less than optimal.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The perlunit guys are tackling passing state info around using a\n&gt; &gt; runner object but they don&#39;t pass it to the setup/teardown \nroutines.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks for your help,\n&gt; &gt; Kevin\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; &gt; junit-unsubscribe@y...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
