Such as...testing,\n&gt; perhaps?\n\nNo. &quot;If tests are to document sample use of the code being tested...&quot; I \nsee no need for &quot;only&quot; there.\n\n&gt;  &gt; Also, if tests depend on non-public parts of production classes, then\n&gt;  &gt; the tests &quot;get in the way&quot; of refactorings that /should/ not affect\n&gt;  &gt; client code.\n&gt; \n&gt; So you just refactor the tests as well. It&#39;s no big deal.\n\nIf you don&#39;t think it&#39;s a big deal, then I can&#39;t convince you otherwise.\n\n&gt;  &gt; The whole point (!!) of the protected and private keyword is to shield\n&gt;  &gt; client code from the inner-workings and details of design.\n&gt; \n&gt; Indeed.\n&gt; \n&gt;  &gt; Tests are client code.\n&gt; \n&gt; No, they are tests. Sometimes they might act like client code.\n\nThat&#39;s a philosophy difference, and I wouldn&#39;t dare try to change your mind.\n\n&gt;  &gt; Why should tests get special access to these inner workings?\n&gt; \n&gt; So that they can test these inner workings?\n\nAgain, philosophy: if those inner working are complex enough to need to \nbe tested on their own, then they are not &quot;inner workings&quot;. Instead, \nthey are features that can likely be used in other contexts. In that \ncase, make &#39;em public parts of some collaborating class. The result is \nusually a less-highly-coupled and more cohesive design.\n-- \nJ. B.
