The bad advice was the\n&gt; _categorical_ statement that comments are waste.\n\nOK, I see.\n\n&gt; On the other hand, if the code embodies application-specific\n&gt; knowledge, it is usually important and often essential to explain.\n\nYes, of course. Most often that knowledge can be explained by using\ncode, though.\n\n&gt; Walter was well known for his incredibly precise, tight code.  It was\n&gt; beautiful. \n&gt; \n&gt; He was also very economical with comments.  That wasn&#39;t so\n&gt; wonderful for those who had to decrypt the code when he wasn&#39;t there.\n\nPerhaps &quot;precise, tight&quot; code isn&#39;t exactly the same as &quot;expressive,\nmaintainable&quot; code? I&#39;d really like to see some code snippets the\nmaintaines had problems with...\n\n\n&gt;&gt; Saying &quot;write your code in a way that it doesn&#39;t need comments&quot; is\n&gt;&gt; very good advice, on the other hand.\n&gt; \n&gt; That I would agree with.  Although some of us do like Javadocs.\n\nI have never seen a javadoc comment I would have preferred over code. If\nyou can&#39;t have the code, Javadoc is very nice, though.\n\n&gt;&gt;                                 And in my experience you *can* learn\n&gt;&gt; to write code in a way that you very seldom need to fall back on this\n&gt;&gt; crutch.\n&gt; \n&gt; Crutch?  Name-calling helps no one.\n\nSorry, I didn&#39;t mean it that way. A crutch is an important tool to me.\nThere are situations where I definitely want to have one. Most often I\nwant to avoid to need one, though. Exactly the same with comments. \n\n&gt; Can we return to JUnit and the thrill of unit testing?\n\nI don&#39;t mind.\n\nTake care, Ilja\n\n\n",
