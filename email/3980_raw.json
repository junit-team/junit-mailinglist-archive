You still\n&gt; have to write the tests if you test after. It&#39;s just that you&#39;re able to\n&gt; test *while* coding : I won&#39;t list the benefits as they are quite well\n&gt; documented..\n&gt; joe\n\nOr to put it another way, there is overhead relative to the usual \napproach, which is to *not* test code at all except in a simplistic way. \nIn that case, test-first has the advantage of knowing that the code \nactually works.  The same amount of test coverage done after the fact \nwill definitely take longer, because programmers will need to study code \nwritten much earlier to devise good tests.  Moreover, newer layers of \nthe code may well have been written based on untested older layers which \nhave bugs.\n\nI think the biggest payoff, though, is in maintenance and refactoring. \nMaintenance is a pain on most big systems because you&#39;re never sure what \nyou&#39;ll break when you make a change, especially a change at a low level \nof the system.  If you have a suite of unit tests in place, you&#39;ll KNOW \nwhat you break.  And if you find you broke something untested, you write \na test, add it to the suite, fix it, and never encounter it again.  This \nalso greatly simplifies refactoring, or cleaning the code as you touch \nit - something else avoided in classic systems because you don&#39;t know \nwhat you might break by, say, moving a method or changing a parameter \ntype.  With good tests, you can do that without fear.  This adds up to \n*greatly* reduced maintenance costs in the long run.\n\nQuite frankly, the biggest test most programmers apply on most jobs is \n&quot;Does it compile?&quot;  To them, test-first looks like overhead.\n\n-- \n\nDavid Stagner\n\nNational Marrow Donor Program\n3001 Broadway Street NE\nBroadway Ridge Suite 500\nMinneapolis, MN  55413\n\nEmail: dstagner@...\n\n\n\n",
