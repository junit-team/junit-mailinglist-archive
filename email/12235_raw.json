We are in the business\n &gt; of making loans and have a non-trivial number of rules and mitigants\n &gt; for credit checking. If we had an extensive series of unit tests to\n &gt; check that we applied our current rules correctly (which we don&#39;t)\n &gt; and we stuck a rules engine in the mix - is there a way I could\n &gt; leverage those mythical unit tests to compare the results of my\n &gt; current code against the rules-based results ? Is there a way I could\n &gt; measure the impact of a rules change by comparing the unit tests\n &gt; results of the before and after versions of the rules ?\n\nSure.  Write your unit tests to go against a common rules engine\ninterface.  Either use your current interface for your current\nrules implementation, or adjust it to be an interface that would\nwork for both your current implementation and the new purchased\nengine.\n\nIf your rules are currently scattered about the code, you&#39;ll need\nto do some refactoring to gather them up under the interface.\nMichael Feather&#39;s new book Working Effectively With Legacy Code\nhas some great techniques for doing things like this.\n\nMake sure you have a sufficient safety net of unit tests around\nyour current implementation.  It sounds like those tests will\ncause you to fix some current issues, based on your comment.\n\nThen implement the purchased rules engine under the interface.\nYou will likely need some delegate code to map the interface to\nthe interface of the new rules engine, unless the two engines\nhave very similar interfaces.\n\nRun the same unit tests and see if the results are the same.\nIf not, the assertions that fail point you to the problems.\n\nOnce you have unit tests for your rules, changing a rule&#39;s\nbehavior should have some effect on the tests.  The assertions\nthat break tell you what the behavioral change was.  If nothing\nbreaks, perhaps that says the test coverage is not sufficient,\nor the rule change had no practical effect.\n\nIf you can&#39;t separate out your rules into a testable module,\nyou&#39;ll have to rely on higher-level unit or acceptance tests to\nshow you if the rules still behave the same.  For example, you\nmay have a test that shows a credit application rejected due to\nsome ratio of debt to income (that&#39;s implemented by a rule).\nIf the test works, and then you switch to using the purchased\nrules engine, the test should still work.  IMHO, it&#39;s better to\nisolate the rules engine at a lower level and have more specific\ntests, though.  It&#39;s much easier to pinpoint issues that way.\n\nWe&#39;d still have to rely on testing to prove the new engine works\nwithout unit tests.  With unit tests, we trade off all the manual\ntesting time for the time spent creating the unit tests, and then\ngain dividends into the future because we can run all the tests\nrepeatedly for very little cost every time we want to see if\neverything still works.\n\nPaul\n-----\nPaul Hodgetts -- CEO, Principal Consultant\nAgile Logic  -- www.agilelogic.com\nConsulting, Coaching, Training -- On-Site & Out-Sourced Development\nAgile Processes/Lean/XP/Scrum -- Java/J2EE, C++, OOA/D, UI/IA, XML\n\n\n\n",
