My experience shows that test-first is the\nmost productive way to develop, especially when you take into account design\nquality and reduced debugging time. Truth is, even with the best intentions,\ndevelopers miss tests that can be created by such tools. My current thinking\nis that I definately want to drive the main use-cases via test-first, but I\nmay let the tools create certain boundary condition tests for me - if I like\nthe code they generate.\n\nAnother tool maker to watch in this space is Agitar.\n\nRegards,\nDavid\n\n-----------------\n&quot;Stedak&quot; &lt;sketcham at dsicdi dot com&gt;\n\nHello!\n\nDoes anyone have any thoughts or experience with Parasoft&#39;s JTest\nproduct? It is integrated with Eclipse to use JUnit.\n\nOn the upside I see that there is the knowledge that at least some\nunit testing is being done to all code. Most of the developers here\ndo not test.\n\nOn the downside (my personal opinion), test-writing first or at least\nat the same time as coding is much more effective than test-writing\nafter the fact. Code written without testing in mind is not very\ntestable. I don&#39;t see how JTest can help there although the code\nstandards module would seem to help.\n\n\nFor those who don&#39;t know, Parasoft&#39;s JTest is a tool to automatically\ngenerate tests for your code. It does a number of other things also.\n\n\n\n",
