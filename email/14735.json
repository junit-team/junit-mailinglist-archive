It seems to me that techniques that so obscure they&#39;re only <br/>\nknown to the cognoscenti indicate there&#39;s something missing somewhere.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; You keep missing the distinction between &quot;public&quot; and &quot;published&quot;:<br/>\n&gt; &quot;published&quot; is a social convention enforced by social contracts.<br/>\n&gt; Providing a runtime JAR, to be available at _runtime_, and not<br/>\n&gt; _compile time_, is an excellent way of enforcing these conventions.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve already argued this one to death in this thread; and don&#39;t have <br/>\nanything more to add at this point; but I will try to rephrase. There <br/>\nmay be a distinction between public and published in the original <br/>\ndeveloper&#39;s mind, but it starts and stops there. For the client <br/>\nprogrammer, public == published; and wishing otherwise ain&#39;t going to <br/>\nmake it so. The distinction that exists in Java is between public and <br/>\npackage-private. That&#39;s what you need to work with. Perhaps other <br/>\nlanguages have clearer distinctions between public and published, but <br/>\nJava doesn&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Similarly, excluding packages from JavaDoc works well.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That helps. Unlike runtime/API separation I&#39;ve actually seen this done. <br/>\nI&#39;d estimate I&#39;ve seen it about as frequently as I&#39;ve seen API docs that <br/>\ninclude package-private and private methods.  It would help more, if it <br/>\nwere more common. For instance, why are the junit.samples and <br/>\njunit.tests packages published in the JavaDoc on the JUnit web site at <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.junit.org/junit/javadoc/3.8.1/index.htm\">http://www.junit.org/junit/javadoc/3.8.1/index.htm</a> ?<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n﻿Elliotte Rusty Harold  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:elharo@...\">elharo@...</a><br/>\nXML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/\">http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim\">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim</a></div>",
