But that&#39;s\n&gt;&gt; just my mind...\n&gt;\n&gt; Agreed: it&#39;s easier to understand, but more tests mean more code. I\n&gt; wanted to be able to write tests with data. Why duplicate all that \n&gt; stuff?!\n&gt;\n\nI spot two things duplicated, both being methods calls: \nassertCorrectAge() and DateUtil.makeDate().  Both of those are trivial \nto change in one fell swoop.\n\n\n&gt; I don&#39;t think overriding runTest() and creating a TestSuite &quot;by hand&quot; \n&gt; is\n&gt; so advanced: it&#39;s how JUnit worked before they added the\n&gt; reflection-based stuff, anyway.\n\nI didn&#39;t claim those constructs were advanced.  Rather, I noted that \nnot using those constructs yielded a more explicit set of tests, to me. \n  And I was curious why you chose those constructs over individual test \ncase methods, which I think is the obvious solution.  Thanks for \nexpounding on that.\n\nMike \n  \n\n\n",
