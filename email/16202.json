I think these<br/>\nkinds of discussions are valuable for synthesizing divergent experiences.<br/>\nHere are my thoughts on the issues raised below.<br/>\n<br/>\nRe: multiple asserts. One of my goals for tests is that they point precisely<br/>\nto the problem when they fail. If I have many asserts in one test,<br/>\nespecially if the assertions are interspersed with calls to the objects<br/>\nunder test, then I run the risk of having a failing test that requires<br/>\nconsiderable investigation before I can see what went wrong. OTOH, I haven&#39;t<br/>\nfound it useful to deliberately limit myself to a single assertion per test,<br/>\nas is the practice of some list members.<br/>\n<br/>\nRe: code that throws exceptions. I prefer to declare the test case as<br/>\nthrowing the exception. I haven&#39;t ever had trouble debugging from the<br/>\ninformation provided in the exception. Discarding that exception and getting<br/>\na generic AssertionError seems a step backwards to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nKent Beck<br/>\nThree Rivers Institute<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>] On <br/>\n&gt; Behalf Of Cédric Beust ? <br/>\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, February 21, 2006 12:54 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [junit] JUnit Anti-patterns<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hi Joe,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Joe Schmetzer wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;I&#39;ve just updated the JUnit Anti-patterns page I maintain at<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.exubero.com/junit/antipatterns.html.\">http://www.exubero.com/junit/antipatterns.html.</a> I&#39;d be <br/>\n&gt; interested in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;any feedback, if people want to suggest additions or improvements.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t really understand this:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This is a design decision that permeates JUnit, and when you decide to<br/>\n&gt; report multiple failures per test, you begin to fight against JUnit.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t see how having more that one assert &quot;fights against&quot; <br/>\n&gt; JUnit (what<br/>\n&gt; does this even mean?) and in the code that I see every day, <br/>\n&gt; very few tests<br/>\n&gt; contain only one assert.  Especially if your tests require <br/>\n&gt; two or three<br/>\n&gt; statements to set up in the test method (not in setUp()), in <br/>\n&gt; which case<br/>\n&gt; there is even more to be gained to run more than one assert <br/>\n&gt; so you don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; have to duplicate this code in other test methods.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Also, the fix you show in your documentation is simplistic.  <br/>\n&gt; What if the<br/>\n&gt; code to be extracted is specific to that test method?  If you <br/>\n&gt; move it to<br/>\n&gt; setUp(), you are suddenly charging *all* the other test <br/>\n&gt; methods of that same<br/>\n&gt; class with this set up cost that they have no need for.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Also, it seems to me your recommended pattern for code that <br/>\n&gt; must throw an<br/>\n&gt; exception (&quot;don&#39;t catch it and declare the exception in the throws<br/>\n&gt; statement&quot;) goes against common practice.  Plus, it will <br/>\n&gt; cause JUnit to<br/>\n&gt; report an Error instead of a Failure, although this distinction is<br/>\n&gt; thankfully going away with JUnit4.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; A more common way to address this problem is to catch the <br/>\n&gt; exception and do a<br/>\n&gt; fail().<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Other than that, your guide is fine advice.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; Cédric<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
