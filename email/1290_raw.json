It&#39;s an interesting one.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;I&#39;d like to remind that the reason for the name &quot;unit test&quot; is that it\n&gt;refers to the _scope_ of the components that are being tested, relative to\n&gt;the entire system.  The term &quot;unit testing&quot; should not imply anything too\n&gt;prescriptive about the strategies employed to test thoroughly at that scope,\n&gt;though as others have stated, there are guidelines.  In object oriented\n&gt;programming the &quot;unit&quot; scope is often a class, but is also often a single\n&gt;method or a cluster of closely related classes.  Truly, a program can be\n&gt;broken into even smaller units - expressions and statements - but everyone\n&gt;agrees this is too granular for testing.\n&gt;\n&gt;Also recall that the test of whether we&#39;ve tested _enough_ should be code\n&gt;coverage analysis of the component/subsystem/system under test when run\n&gt;against our test suite.  If testing all the public and protected methods\n&gt;also happens to test your private methods and exception handlers thoroughly,\n&gt;then you&#39;re all set, but you don&#39;t know that unless you have extremely\n&gt;simple applications, or you are doing coverage analysis.  Anyway, it is\n&gt;unsafe to conclude a priori that public API testing is all that is needed;\n&gt;each situation should determine the tools and strategies used.\n&gt;\n&gt;I have two examples to offer that may help when you&#39;re in a tough situation\n&gt;where testing private methods or protected classes.\n&gt;\n&gt;One is a private field accessor class, the other is a technique.\n&gt;\n&gt;I&#39;m attaching the FieldAccessor, which is mainly from Larman and Guthrie&#39;s\n&gt;Java 2 performance and idiom book.  Personally, I have yet to need this\n&gt;class for anything, but I thought I&#39;d pass it along.  It&#39;s javadoc&#39;ed.\n&gt;\n&gt;The technique is one that I have found useful at least once, which is to put\n&gt;a public static inner class that extends junit.framework.TestCase in the\n&gt;class under test.  This gives the inner class full access to the outer\n&gt;class&#39;s private methods and members, while allowing the inner class to be an\n&gt;instance of a JUnit test case.  I sent an example of this to this list a few\n&gt;weeks ago.  Another handy thing is that when you compile the outer class,\n&gt;the inner test case is produced in a separate class file which can be safely\n&gt;deleted when packaging the outer class for production (because the outer\n&gt;class makes no references to the static inner class).\n&gt;\n&gt;Scott Stirling\n&gt;Macromedia\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;-----Original Message-----\n&gt;\n&gt;From: Jens Andersen\n&gt;\n&gt;To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;Sent: 5/23/01 4:44 AM\n&gt;\n&gt;Subject: [junit] How to test protected and private methods/ fields?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Hi all,\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;First of all I have to mention that I&#39;m pretty novice when it comes to\n&gt;\n&gt;use\n&gt;JUnit for writing unittests. But I have a question which I hope some of\n&gt;\n&gt;you\n&gt;can help me with - it&#39;s regarding testing private/protected methods and\n&gt;\n&gt;how\n&gt;to organize my test package.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;First the package. I have read to articles regarding test (&quot;Junit best\n&gt;\n&gt;practices&quot; from JavaWorld and &quot;Incremental development with Ant and\n&gt;\n&gt;JUnit&quot; from developerWorks). In the JBT article Andy Schneider advice you to\n&gt;\n&gt;keep\n&gt;tests in the same location as the source code. And in the Incremental...\n&gt;\n&gt;article Malcolm Davis advice you to make a separate package. Which\n&gt;\n&gt;approach is the best to use?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;I must admit that I like the idea of making a separate package but then\n&gt;\n&gt;again - how do I then test private and protected methods? And if I keep\n&gt;\n&gt;the\n&gt;tests in the same location as the source code - who do I then test\n&gt;\n&gt;private methods?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;I would very much appreciate if some of you could give me a little\n&gt;\n&gt;example\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Kind regards,\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;J.
