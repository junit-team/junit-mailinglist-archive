Write a mock (or stub) File class that can be setup to simulate system\n&gt; failures. This one sounds like too much effort, especially since File is\n&gt; not an interface. Also this approach only tests the system style failure\n&gt; and not the jvm failure.\n\nIt&#39;s not easy to provide a sensible stub for the File class since File is\nonly an encapsulation of the file name. You have to write stub streams as\nwell which do the real input/output stuff. My suggestion would be to\nintroduce an interface which covers only your special requirements, e.g.\n\npublic interface MyFile {\n    PrintWriter getWriter();\n    BufferedReader getReader();\n    boolean exists();\n}\n\nThat way you can easily introduce a mock implementation which provides you\nwith the mock writer and reader instances.\n\nHowever, it might not be worth the effort.\n\nJohannes\n\n\n",
