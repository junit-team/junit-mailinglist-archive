He&#39;s saying<br/>\nthat you should never test private methods directly, only indirectly through<br/>\npublic methods.<br/>\n<br/>\nI find this angle puzzling, since as I said above, if you follow this<br/>\nreasoning, since all your code is already being tested indirectly by<br/>\nfunctional testing, why do unit testing at all?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe main reason why I sometimes want to test private methods is not fear, as<br/>\nLasse claims, but simply the fact that this functionality can break.<br/>\nTherefore, it deserves a test of its own.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are two extreme ways to test private methods, both bad:<br/>\n<br/>\n   - Use reflection + setAccessible. Very fragile, avoid.<br/>\n   - Use public methods that call this private method. Not good enough.<br/>\n<br/>\nI tend to favor the middle ground approach, which is to relax the scope of<br/>\nthe method so that tests can see it. Making it package protected and putting<br/>\na comment (&quot;/* for testing */&quot;) usually works, but if it doesn&#39;t, I don&#39;t<br/>\nhave a problem with making this method public for testing.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nCédric<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
