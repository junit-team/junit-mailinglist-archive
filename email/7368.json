I have a simple RMI <br/>\nserver providing database service supported by a one-file, non-relational <br/>\ndatabase.  Database clients pass their object reference to the server when <br/>\nconnecting, and so the server can detect a dead connection by the following <br/>\nif-statement and <br/>\nrecycles the connection for another client:<br/>\n<br/>\n       if (clientObject != null && clientObject.equals(null)) { ... }<br/>\n<br/>\nRight now, I just open a few OS shells (Windows XP) and run the clients to <br/>\nconnect to the server, manually close a shell, and check the println <br/>\nstatements I placed in the server to see that it is indeed working.  It would <br/>\nbe great if a TestCase can simulate that.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance.<br/>\n<br/>\nSam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
