Sometimes \nwriting one test is enough, sometimes writing 10,000 tests is not \nenough.  It depends on the complexity of the method you test and your \nconfidence in that method.\n\nIn your case, if you have 20 statements, you have 2.43e18 possible \npermutations (let&#39;s take the simpliest case where you only permute 20 \ndifferent statements).  Maybe you will find useful to test all \npermutations (I have nothing against it), if you have 40 rules and want \nto all 8.15e47 permuations it&#39;s also fine with me.  But I don&#39;t think \nthat that it&#39;s realistic to test all and every permutation, but that&#39;s \nonly _my_ point of view.  If you think that you need total confidence \nand your computer is fast enough, go ahead and test every case.  I \nreally don&#39;t have anything against that.\n\n&gt; That&#39;s simply not the case. JUnit, despite its name, is quite\n&gt; usable for writing larger scale tests and even for automating tests.\n\n\nAnd that&#39;s what I proposed in my answer.  I simply pointed out that \nsometimes testing _all_ possibilities doesn&#39;t make (much) sense and that \nyou can be reasonably confident by writing only a few tests (how many is \n*a few* is up to you).\n\n\n&gt; Why not help it be a more complete framework rather than argue it\n&gt; should not grow because &quot;real&quot; unit tests wouldn&#39;t need a proposed\n&gt; enhancement?\n\n\nHave I said that JUnit should not grow???  Surely not!!!  What I \nstrongly think is that &quot;if there is a need, it should be addressed, \neither directly or indirectly&quot;.  &quot;Real&quot; unit tests often need more than \nthe standard JUnit, and I would like to hear the problems of those users \nusers more often on this newsgroup.\n\n&gt; Our workaround to the JUnit confounding of test name with method name \n\n&gt; was to make sure all of\n&gt; our assertions include a message that indicates which test\n&gt; configuration is being used.\n\n\nThat was my point in another message, explaining the mean of the &quot;name&quot; \nattribute in the TestCase class.  It was simply an explanation nothing \nmore.  I think that sometimes explaining the framework can be helpful, \nbut it&#39;s once again my point of view :-)\n\n\n-Vladimir\n\n-- \nVladimir Bossicard\nwww.bossicard.com\n\n\n",
