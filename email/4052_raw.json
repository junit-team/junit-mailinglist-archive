I have a set of classes whose values are \nset\n&gt; from a file by a Reader object. Now I want to test whether these\n&gt; values are set correctly. I can use preset values for testing\n&gt; purpose. But due to the large number and complexity of these classes\n&gt; it would be very difficult and cumbersome to create objects with\n&gt; these preset values manually for testing against the ones created by\n&gt; the Reader.\n&gt;\n&gt; I am thinking of creating a helper class for each of the above\n&gt; classes. I will pass it the object to compare, and it will compare\n&gt; the object&#39;s data against pre-defined values that will be stored in\n&gt; the helper classes. I will need to extend junit&#39;s Assert class for\n&gt; these helper class, since they will assert if there is a data\n&gt; mismatch. So my question is, is it okay to extend Assert in my own\n&gt; classes ? Has anyone faced this problem before, and if so how did \nyou\n&gt; solve this ? Any help will be appreciated.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; - krishnan\n\n\n\n",
