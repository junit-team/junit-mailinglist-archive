And<br/>\n&gt; &gt; then write unit tests that make sure your code works as you expect,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; including that it detects the faulty preconditions and invariants.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Absolutely. Much better than sticking my head in the sand and  <br/>\n&gt; pretending<br/>\n&gt; the preconditions will never be violated, and it&#39;s not my fault what<br/>\n&gt; happens if they are.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Certainly.  Sticking your head in the sand is irresponsible.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, to sum up.  If you are building a library for other people to  <br/>\ncall, then you should write unit tests for that library, complete  <br/>\nwith unit tests for all the exceptions that your library will throw  <br/>\nbecause of violated preconditions.  These unit tests will provide  <br/>\npart of the documentation that will help your callers avoid those  <br/>\nexceptions.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; A side note: when you write code for checking preconditions, code<br/>\n&gt; coverage tools like Cobertura will usually alert you if you&#39;ve  <br/>\n&gt; forgotten<br/>\n&gt; to test one. (Yes, I know we should have written the test first, but<br/>\n&gt; we&#39;re all imperfect and sometimes miss a case.) if there&#39;s no code to<br/>\n&gt; test the precondition, there&#39;s also no warning that you&#39;ve  <br/>\n&gt; forgotten to<br/>\n&gt; write the test for it.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Agreed.  I use Clover myself, but Cobertura looks pretty good.   <br/>\nEmploying code coverage tools is an important part of any testing  <br/>\nstrategy because, as you say, even test-firsters can&#39;t think of every  <br/>\ntest case.  Ensuring your code is covered with tests is simply part  <br/>\nof every professional programmer&#39;s daily job.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n----<br/>\nRobert C.
