If you have a large project to maintain, <br/>\ndon&#39;t write tons of tests only to have your project in the same state as <br/>\nif it would have been if written from scratch with the tf principles in <br/>\nmind.  If you do so, I think you are &quot;blinded&quot; by your &quot;love&quot; for the <br/>\ntest-first principles.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I never said that the test-first principles are bad for an already <br/>\ndeveloped project.  You only have to keep your head cool and avoid the <br/>\nrush.  For me, generating tests is a symptom of this rush (&quot;let&#39;s <br/>\nquickly have 2,000 tests written for our project&quot;).  If 99% of your <br/>\nproject is already working, why should you first start by writing tests <br/>\nfor 100% of your code.  Concentrate your effort on the 1% that doesn&#39;t work.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne principle of XProgramming is &quot;YAGNI&quot;: so don&#39;t write tests until you <br/>\nneed them.  And keep in mind that the goal is not to write tons of <br/>\ntests, but to validate your code.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Vladimir<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nVladimir Bossicard<br/>\nwww.bossicard.com</div>",
