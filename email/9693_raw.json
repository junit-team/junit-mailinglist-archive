Or at least make sure you don&#39;t\njump blindly into the cesspool that is EJB.  \n\n&gt; I am coding in an Eclipse environment, from which I called the JUnit \n&gt; plugin\n\nThis is a good thing.\n\n&gt; for testing my test class which has the method as below:\n&gt; \n&gt; \tpublic void testPlain() throws Exception\n&gt; \t{\n&gt; \t\tassertEquals(1,1);\n&gt; \t\tassertEquals(2,1);\n&gt; \t}\n&gt; \n&gt; I always get only the result for last result:\n&gt; \n&gt; junit.framework.AssertionFailedError: expected:&lt;2&gt; but was:&lt;1&gt;\n\nAssertions that pass don&#39;t do anything.  You only hear about the ones\nthat fail: no news is good news.\n \n&gt; Where as I want to design a test based on the result of first assert \n&gt; and I cannot devide them in to two test beds as the test has to be \n&gt; in single setup-TearDown.\n\nSorry, but I don&#39;t understand this.\n\nI suggest that you do some more in depth reading on JUnit, and ideally\nTest-Driven Development (TDD).  I suggest both my own book (TDD: A\nPractical Guide) and Johannes Link&#39;s (Unit Testing in Java).  If you\npursue TDD (which I strongly encourage you to do) you should read Kent\nBeck&#39;s as well (TDD: By Example).\n\n&gt; So is there any workaround for this I see lot \n&gt; of examples using multiple asserts in single test case, but why they \n&gt; are not succeeding in my case.\n\nAs has been pointing out, it&#39;s working just fine.\n\nI&#39;ll mention here that I strive to make my test code extremely clean:\nmy goal is a single assertion per test method.  Best case is to have\nall fixture code in setUp() and nothign but a single assertion in each\ntest method.\n\nDave\n\n\n",
