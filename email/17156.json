    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-203953536\">In JUnit 3.8.x and earlier, the test cases were used for several purposes:<br/>\nspecifying what was to be run, running the tests, and reporting results. The<br/>\ntest case instances would be constructed at some time before the test was<br/>\nrun. Consider a test which allocated a limited external resource. If I<br/>\ncreated more than one test case of a given class, there would potentially be<br/>\na conflict. SetUp(), on the other hand, is guaranteed to be run just before<br/>\nthe test method, so it is safe to allocated external resources in setUp().<br/>\nWith JUnit 4, the test case instances are guaranteed to be created one at a<br/>\ntime, as they are run, so this argument no longer holds.<br/>\n <br/>\nA second argument for setUp() is symmetry. Allocating resources in setUp()<br/>\nand de-allocating them in tearDown() is nicely symmetric, whereas allocating<br/>\nthem in a constructor and de-allocating them in tearDown() is not. If you<br/>\ndon&#39;t have to de-allocate any resources, then this argument no longer holds.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;ll be experimenting with initializing test cases in field declarations and<br/>\nconstructors to see if I like them better that way. In general, I am a fan<br/>\nof expressing code a declaratively as possible, which argues in this<br/>\ndirection.<br/>\n <br/>\nCheers,<br/>\n <br/>\nKent Beck<br/>\nThree Rivers Institute<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  _____  <br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>] On Behalf Of<br/>\nclgonsal<br/>\nSent: Monday, July 17, 2006 4:08 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [junit] setUp versus constructors<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been using JUnit for a few years now, and one thing that&#39;s always<br/>\nbothered me is the &quot;setUp&quot; method.<br/>\n<br/>\nI always do my initialization in my constructor (if I&#39;m not just doing<br/>\nit at the field definition) as constructors allow me to initialize<br/>\nfinal fields. The semantics of using a constructor also seem far more<br/>\nobvious to me as everyone reading my code knows Java, while not<br/>\neveryone is a JUnit guru.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe additional complexity of having the (as far as I can tell)<br/>\nredundant setUp method seems counterproductive, so why does setUp exist?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
