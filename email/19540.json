After all, those method calls are made<br/>\nfrom the same level of the call stack. This should be easy to verify<br/>\nby adding a &quot;Thread.sleep(5000)&quot; to a tearDown() method and seeing<br/>\nwhether it affects the reported execution time. Or then you  could<br/>\njust read the source, of course.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOn 7/10/07, Dennis &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dennisk@...\">dennisk@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;  If the tearDown time cannot be eliminated or if our use of the Time<br/>\n&gt;  values is completely off-base, then I would ask if going to JUnit4<br/>\n&gt;  would be better insofar as we could make use of the<br/>\n&gt;  @Before/@BeforeClass/@After/AfterClass constructs, hoping that they<br/>\n&gt;  would eliminate the set up and tear down times?<br/>\n<br/>\nNo, @Before and @After won&#39;t eliminate the setup and teardown<br/>\ntimes--they&#39;re just a new syntax for achieving the same behavior as<br/>\nJUnit 3.x achieved with setUp() and tearDown().<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLasse<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nLasse Koskela<br/>\n* Author of &quot;Test Driven&quot; (Manning Publications, 2007) *<br/>\n* Reaktor Innovations * <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ri.fi/en\">http://www.ri.fi/en</a> * </span></blockquote></div>",
