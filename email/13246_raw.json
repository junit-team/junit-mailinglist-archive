I not going to argue about the MVC thing :), the app is adding data\n&gt; to the session, so, a given action can access it.\n&gt; now, I can try to set up all the info in the testXXX method, the prob\n&gt; is that I&#39;m re-writing the app in the test env :(( .\n\nIf you want to test the action, then I recommend coding it in a way that \nthe important behavior doesn&#39;t know that data is in the session. Example:\n\nMyAction {\n     perform(request, response) {\n         Object value = request.getSession(false).getAttribute(&quot;name&quot;);\n         reallyDoIt(request, response, value);\n     }\n\n     // Real logic here\n     reallyDoIt(request, response, value) {\n         ... now use value ....\n     }\n}\n\nYou can test the reallyDoIt() method -- which contains all the logic you \nreally want to test -- without having to put data in the session. \nInstead, just pass different &quot;value&quot;s for the different conditions you \nwant to test. You can test perform() if you want, but it will only break \nif something else doesn&#39;t put a value in the session under &quot;name&quot;. Test \n/that/ thing instead. As written, perform() can&#39;t really fail on its own \n-- it&#39;s Too Simple to Break.\n\nFor now, I recommend you focus on getting the logic right. Once the \ndefect rate in that part of the code is low, spend time learning how to \ntest the integration points between the J2EE framework and your logic.\n\n&gt; 2. for me &quot;how can I test a scenario&quot; sounds like a common q. aren&#39;t\n&gt; other developers what to check it , and not only a specific action ?\n\nIt might be a common question, but I don&#39;t know what you mean, so I \ndon&#39;t know what to recommend. &quot;Scenario&quot; is one of those common words \nthat has 20 different meanings when you ask 20 different people what it \nmeans.\n\n&gt; 3. I will check the other framework u mentioned.\n\nI think it will help. Good luck.\n-- \nJ. B.
