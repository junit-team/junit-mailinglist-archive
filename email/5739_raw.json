I am using 4.5i and it is very good. Contact your ParaSof=\r\nt representative to ensure that you have the latest and greatest version. P=\r\naraSoft is very fast at fixing bugs and customer problem reports. (Well, th=\r\ney fix mine quickly! :-)\n\n&gt;1) JTest allows you to incorporate existing JUni=\r\nt test with the JTest\n&gt;analysis\n\nCorrect. Isn&#39;t this wonderful! A commercia=\r\nl company that recognises quality open-source software when they see it and=\r\n they made a decision to embrace it. I find this refreshing. Stay tuned for=\r\n further Junit related news. I am in regular communication with some of the=\r\n folks at ParaSoft and they are VERY forward thinking in regards of Junit a=\r\nnd open-source in general.\n\n&gt;2) JTest can generate a JUnit template for par=\r\nticular classes, it\n&gt;doesn&#39;t go any further than this\n\nThis statement is te=\r\nchnically correct but only tells half of the story. A unit test is supposed=\r\n to be written by a programmer/tester/human being. Jtest is an automated te=\r\nsting tool. It cannot write business logic/customer requirement testing uni=\r\nt tests! How is it supposed to know what your customers wanted? It generate=\r\ns an initial Junit outline upon request, but they haven&#39;t built in the nece=\r\nssary ESP to read your customers minds yet.\n\nFor basic value objects (i.e. =\r\nonly getters and setters) it will actually generate very reasonable junit t=\r\nests. This is possible because it IS possible to test that a value is store=\r\nd correctly and returned correctly without reading a customer&#39;s mind.\n\n&gt;3) =\r\nRunning JTest on junit.jar version 3.7 reports 24 runtime\n&gt;exceptions (see =\r\nbelow)\n\nThis may be true. I&#39;ve never tried it.\n\n&gt;4) Running JTest on Ant pr=\r\noduces 255 runtime exceptions\n\nThis may also be true. I&#39;ve never tried this=\r\n either.\n\n&gt;5) You can&#39;t analyze JTest using JTest, it refuses to analyze\n&gt;&quot;=\r\ncom.parasoft&quot; packages (probably because you would find &gt;&gt;&gt; 255\n&gt;errors)\n\nA=\r\ngain, I&#39;ve never tried this. I can&#39;t say that I blame them though. It&#39;s a r=\r\nough old business world out there and you&#39;ve got to take some precautions. =\r\nBesides, they get enough &quot;issue reports&quot; from me to keep the bug count pret=\r\nty low! :-)\n\n&gt;All in all JUnit wise the support is somewhat disappointing t=\r\no me and\n\nI&#39;m very sorry that you don&#39;t like the facilities provided. I fin=\r\nd them quite useful and acceptable. It&#39;s a free world. You are free to unin=\r\nstall Jtest and take a chance on shipping untested, sub-optimal code and yo=\r\nu are free to keep Jtest installed and have some of the squeakiest clean co=\r\nde on the planet. I know which I&#39;m gonna do.\n\n&gt;the &#39;Runtime Exception gener=\r\nator&#39; facility is annoying.\n\nThen don&#39;t run those tests. Jtest is configura=\r\nble and you can turn off tests that you deem inappropriate for you and your=\r\n situation. Our site does not use DbC, so we turn off all of the DbC tests.=\r\n Someday, we may get our developers using it, but until then it makes no se=\r\nnse to test for compliance.\n\nI have found that Jtest&#39;s attempts to call my =\r\ncode with strange and unusual runtime parameters has actually caused me to =\r\nwrite better guard conditions, which makes my code much more robust. I appr=\r\neciate this behaviour from Jtest and have benefited greatly from it.\n\n\n&gt;Gre=\r\netings,\n&gt;A. Roy\n&gt;Java QA tester\n\nAnd greetings to you, my fellow Jtest and =\r\nJunit using developer.\n\n&gt;--- Junit 3.7 report -----\n&gt;All Errors Found - don=\r\ne - 94 Errors Found\n&gt;        [ 24 ] Uncaught Runtime Exceptions\n&gt;\n&gt;        =\r\n       [ 18 ] java.lang.NullPointerException\n&gt;\n&gt;               [ 1 ] java.l=\r\nang.StackOverflowError\n&gt;\n&gt;               [ 1 ] junit.framework.AssertionFai=\r\nledError\n&gt;\n&gt;               [ 1 ] java.lang.StringIndexOutOfBoundsException\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;               [ 1 ] java.lang.ClassFormatError\n&gt;\n&gt;               [ 1 ] =\r\njava.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException\n&gt;\n&gt;               [ 1 ] java.lang.=\r\nIllegalArgumentException\n\nI would actually interpret these exceptions as an=\r\n indication of some extra guard conditions and more defensive programming n=\r\needed within the tested code. If a piece of called code cannot handle unexp=\r\nected inputs, then the fault lies with the code and not the inputs. :-)\n\nJu=\r\nst my $0.02\n\nSimon\n\n-------------------------------------------------------=\r\n----------\nSimon P.
