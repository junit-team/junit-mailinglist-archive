I&#39;ve lost count of how many bugs I&#39;ve found in set and <br/>\nget methods, as well as other methods that were &quot;too simple to fail.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nRemember, even if such a method is simple today it may not be tomorrow. <br/>\nOne big reason we use set and get methods instead of direct field access <br/>\nis precisely because the implementation may change. What merely sets a <br/>\nvariable today may write into a database tomorrow, or verify an <br/>\nadditional constraint. Writing test code for setters and getters insures <br/>\nthat the code still works as originally anticipated as it becomes more <br/>\ncomplex in the future. It&#39;s easier to write the test code when the <br/>\nimplementation is simple and predictable than when it is more complex.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n﻿Elliotte Rusty Harold  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:elharo@...\">elharo@...</a><br/>\nXML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/\">http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim\">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim</a></div>",
