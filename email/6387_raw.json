I have a question about how best to apply JUnit to\n  solve my particular testing need.\n\n  Basically I have a class (lets say Fruit.class) that is being mapped to\n  a database via an O/R  tool.  I would like to test this this mapping.\n  So I have a TestCase called FruitCRUDTestCase.  In my test case I have\n  test methods such as testCreate(), testRestore(), testUpdate(), and\n  testDelete().  Now, when writing these kind of tests before JUnit, I\n  could make the tests dependent on each other.  For example, if the\n  testCreate() method created an object, I could store a reference to it\n  in an instance attribute and access again from the other test methods\n  (testRestore() for example).  To my understanding, this does not seem to\n  be easily doable when using JUnit.  I can create a TestSuite that will\n  execute each of my test methods, I can even create an OrderedTestSuite\n  (from gsbase) that will execute my test methods in the order that I\n  specify, but each test method will be executed within its own instance\n  of TestCase so I can not use instance attributes to make data accessible\n  between test methods.  Is there something that I am missing?\n\n  Now I know that I can make the test methods completely independent to\n  get around this problem, but why?\n\n  I think because it fits the philosophy of writing many small independent\nunit tests methods. Each one showing a clear self-documenting simple\nexample.\n\n  The junit framework forces you into that way of working.\n\n  Later on, it makes refactoring more easy (no side effects, non unclear\ndependencies).\n\n  Making the test methods independent\n  would require duplicating effort since the testRestore() method would\n  have to create an object first (basically duplicate what is already\n  being done in testCreate()).\n\n  OK, but you can reduce the code effort by using static utilities\n  (see for example the article on the web about the &quot;ObjectMother pattern&quot;,\nThoughworks).\n\n  Maybe, it is not the fastest way in terms of performance, but you gain\nseveral\n  other advantages (flexibility, clarity, maintainability, pleasure,...).\n\n  Adelbert Groebbens\n\n  Basically I am looking for input before I write something myself. Maybe\n  someone has dealt with this problem before (I&#39;m sure some has -- it&#39;s\n  not that unique of a problem).  If so, please let me know how you&#39;ve\n  solved this.  I am willing to write a simple extension that will support\n  the type of behavior that I&#39;ve described, but maybe there is a better\n  way of doing things.\n\n  Thanks,\n\n  --Maciej\n  mbz@...\n\n\n\n\n  To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n  junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n\n\n  Your use of Yahoo!
