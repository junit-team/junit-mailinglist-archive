Below you can see the origi=\r\nnal link.\n\nWe use junit for integration tests. The tests are being run in E=\r\nclipse and Jenkins.\n\nNow i would like to log all junit test run results to =\r\na database for easy reporting (i want to log test class / method name, envi=\r\nronment, duration and success). I had thought about parsing the junit resul=\r\nt xmls but to log it directly to a database sounds good to me, too. It soun=\r\nds intrusive but also pretty elegant.\n\nNormally we just annotate a test met=\r\nhod with the @Test annotation and voila, we have our junit test method.\n\nTh=\r\nat means we have no additional framework around junit and i want to keep it=\r\n that way! \nI fear that means that if i want to implement that kind of logg=\r\ning i will probably have to hack into junit.\n\nHas anybody done so and can g=\r\nive advice if that works nicely? Maybe you have an idea on how/where to pla=\r\nce the hook in junit. Or are there easier approaches to my problem?\n\nThanks=\r\n!\n\nedit: To clarify, we already have junit test results of single test runs=\r\n. You can get them out of eclipse (export junit result) or out of jenkins. =\r\nRunning our junit test suites in Jenkins also allows us to track test failu=\r\nre rates of test suites over time. It shows you a nice chart that tracks ho=\r\nw many tests of passed over time. In each jenkins build you can see which t=\r\nests passed, also in comparison to the last run. We need a bit more. We wan=\r\nt to be able to analyse the performance (duration) of certain testcases ove=\r\nr time, over multiple runs, maybe also how they behave differently in diffe=\r\nrent environments. Extract trends. Do some data mining.\n\nhttp://stackoverfl=\r\now.com/questions/5722431/how-to-log-junit-test-run-results-to-a-database\n\nc=\r\nheers!\n\n\n",
