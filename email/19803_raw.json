I&#39;ve seen\nseveral posts that inquire of free or=\r\n open source solutions, but\nwithout many answers - plus they&#39;re a year or t=\r\nwo old. I&#39;m still not\nsure if Clover is what I&#39;m looking for (I want to see=\r\n the results for\ntest run success/failure/time/regressions/etc., not the co=\r\nverage of\nthe product in terms of unit tests).\n\nAre there any products/proj=\r\nects out there to perform reporting on\nJUnit runs besides Agitar?\n\nThanks,\n=\r\nKirk\n\n\n",
