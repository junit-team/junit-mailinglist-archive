So m=\r\nany of the questions on this list are from \n&gt; beginners too lazy to use Goo=\r\ngle that, as a balance, I like \n&gt; these discussions (not theological rants,=\r\n by the way--no need \n&gt; to insult--I, for one, am pragmatic in my discussio=\r\nn, so \n&gt; would that be applied theology?).\n\nI wouldn&#39;t call this a &quot;low-tra=\r\nffic list&quot; but I agree 100%\nwith your second sentence.\n\nThat said, there&#39;s =\r\na very low number of lazy non-Googler\nquestions in my inbox today for some =\r\nreason.\n\n\nTodd.\n\n",
