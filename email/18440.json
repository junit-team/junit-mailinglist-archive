I&#39;d like to think<br/>\nthere is a lot of leverage in having more responsible, skilled programmers<br/>\nout there. &quot;Thinking in Tests&quot; is a strong name for what is possible with<br/>\nJUnit. I know for me the &quot;conversion&quot; came when I went from thinking<br/>\n&quot;feature-&gt;implementation&quot; to &quot;feature-&gt;test&quot;.<br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;ve come to the conclusion that testing, developer testing anyway, is<br/>\nmostly about design. I think early lessons in developer testing should focus<br/>\non coupling, cohesion, and what to do about it, not about equivalence<br/>\npartitioning. Sadly, design is what Yourdon and Constantine were talking<br/>\nabout 25 years ago and we haven&#39;t seemed to make much progress on<br/>\nconsistently achieving good design since then.<br/>\n <br/>\nAnyway, I would like to see more beginning JUnit materials. I can make sure<br/>\nthey get onto the JUnit.org homepage.<br/>\n <br/>\nRegards,<br/>\n <br/>\nKent Beck<br/>\nThree Rivers Institute<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  _____  <br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of<br/>\nSimon Chappell<br/>\nSent: Friday, November 24, 2006 5:52 AM<br/>\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com<br/>\nSubject: [junit] Essay: The Trouble With JUnit<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d like some thoughts from the list on a little something that I&#39;ve<br/>\nwritten.
