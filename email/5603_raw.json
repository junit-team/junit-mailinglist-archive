If he wants to ship in two\n&gt; years, fine... but I bet it&#39;s not what he wants.\n&gt;\n&gt; I can&#39;t imagine that the developers spend all their time writing code without\n&gt; some kind of testing.  Chances are that some test code has been written (just\n&gt; pray that developers haven&#39;t only used &#39;println&#39;) so try to reuse their code\n&gt; into JUnit tests and (even better) try to convince your manager to let the\n&gt; developers do this.  You can then run a code coverage tool to have a look where\n&gt; the code has not been tested.\n&gt;\n&gt; If you want to do negative testing (since it&#39;s a library, it must be pretty\n&gt; solid) JUnit may not be the best tool for this.  But you can write some\n&gt; extensions that test that a class is not crashing.\n&gt;\n&gt; -Vladimir\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt; Vladimir Bossicard\n&gt; www.bossicard.com\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
