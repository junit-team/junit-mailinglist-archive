I tagged\n&gt; the rest with:\n&gt; - regression bugs (9): there was an implementation of the feature that\n&gt; worked prior to the 4.9 beta (although potentially earlier than\n&gt; 4.8.x))\n&gt; - nonregression bugs (15): it is likely the feature has always failed\n&gt; in the documented way.\n&gt; - features (~95): additions to the (implicit) spec, with\n&gt; implementations to provide the additions.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks to everyone who has been submitting problems, proposals, and\n&gt; patches.  I&#39;m sorry that some of you have been waiting so long for a\n&gt; response.\n&gt;\n&gt; The next part of the development plan, in order:\n&gt;\n&gt; - Fix the regression bugs\n&gt; - Release a 4.9 beta 3\n&gt; - Hopefully 4.9b3 can become the final release.  (I am not planning\n&gt; any nonregression bug fixes or new features to get into the 4.9\n&gt; release.  We need to steer this ship back toward frequent releases.)\n&gt; - Create a github project for junit.contrib.\n&gt; - Go through the backlog of pull requests, to see which can be\n&gt; accepted as is, and which either need changes, or should be redirected\n&gt; into junit.contrib.\n&gt; - Work through non-regression bugs for further releases in the 4.9.x series\n&gt; - Choose a number of highly-rated feature requests to be the scope for\n&gt; 4.10, and begin (patch acceptance / implementation)\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m excited to see this project keep moving forward,\n&gt;\n&gt;     David Saff\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
