For example:\n\npublic void testMethod() {\n      Obj.method(&quot;abc&quot;);  //test that it does not throw anything and accept\nthe param.\n  }\n\nthis test fails only if method throws something, because we are testing it\nshould not throw anything and accept the value.\nIt&#39;s not a very usefull test but I do it from time to time. Some might argue\nthat it doesn&#39;t smell good that I&#39;m not checking any post-condition but\nsometimes there is none to check (method maybe does just plain nothing and\ninhibits the call when a certain type of value is passed).\n\nmy 0.02$\n\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: joelkevinjones\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSent: Wednesday, May 22, 2002 4:30 PM\nSubject: [junit] Should JUnit determine if assert*/fail is called in\ntestFoo?\n\n\nThis semester I taught a class on Java programming and tried to\ninstill a little bit of JUnit into my students.  On their second\nassignment, I had them write tests for the class they\nimplemented in their first assignment. (Yes, I know, that&#39;s not\ntest first...)  On the second assigment, I ran their unit tests\nagainst my implementation of the first assignment&#39;s class.  I\nused the text user interface as this made batching up the tests\neasier.  However, on inspection of the student&#39;s code, I had\nseveral students whose tests passed, but they didn&#39;t actually call\nassert*() or fail().  For example:\n\npublic class MP0Test extends TestCase {\n  ...\n  public void testGetValue() {\n      MP0class mp0 = readConfig();\n       mp0.getValue() == 42;\n  }\n}\n\nDoes anyone think JUnit should give  some kind of warning\nwhen no assert* or fail is called in a test* method?\n\nJoel Jones\njones@...\n\n\n\nYahoo!
