The problem is that it should NOT be <br/>\n&gt; looking in program files. I have a j2sdk1.4.2_06 directory on my <br/>\n&gt; root C: drive and that is what I am referencing in my JAVA_HOME. I <br/>\n&gt; even went to what should be an unnecessart step to add the tools.jar <br/>\n&gt; for this directory to my CLASSPATH property. I am not using 1.5 yet <br/>\n&gt; since it has not been approved by the organization that I work for.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Why when I specifically am pointing to this directory on JAVA_HOME <br/>\n&gt; and the CLASSPATH is it deciding to look in jre1.5.0_06&#92;lib down <br/>\n&gt; under Program Files. It is obviously totally ignoring these <br/>\n&gt; properties and going on its own hunting expedition. The question is, <br/>\n&gt; how can I get it to stop?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Wayne Fay&quot; &lt;waynefay@&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Might be related to the space in &quot;Program Files&quot;?
