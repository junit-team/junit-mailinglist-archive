The trick is optimizing your outcome.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think that most people who are truly practicing TDD (following the intent, if not the letter) could be &quot;obsessed over tests to the exclusion of customer satisfaction&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI look at TDD as being driven largely by customer need.  If I don&#39;t understand the customer need (and therefore how to satisfy them), then I don&#39;t know what to test for.  If I don&#39;t know what to test for, I don&#39;t know what to write.  Therefore, if my tests are based on meeting customer need (which drives customer satisfaction), then I inherently should improve customer satisfaction with every test I write, because it will result in code that meets their needs.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeing focused on the customer, though, I will also realize that writing umpteen-million tests for one piece of functionality, to the detriment of not creating other necessary functionality, would not enhance customer satisfaction.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a balancing act, but well worth the effort.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nmy two cents,<br/>\nDianne<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-------------- Original message -------------- <br/>\nFrom: &quot;C��dric Beust ��� &quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cbeust@...\">cbeust@...</a>&gt; <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 8/15/06, J.
