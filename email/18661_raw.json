Unit tests and\n&gt; using JUnit overgrew &quot;developer-only&quot; testing long ago. Sooner\n&gt; (better) or later they become functional tests, user acceptance tests\n&gt; and what not.\n&gt; \n&gt; So, to me limiting test run by QA is a natural requirements. We use\n&gt; Ant&#39;s &lt;batchtest if=&quot;...&quot;&gt; to select what test groups should be run in\n&gt; a particular case.\n&gt; \n&gt; HTH\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Slava Imeshev\n\n\n",
