B. Rainsberger&quot; wrote:\n&gt; Well, for my purposes, code coverage isn&#39;t /so/\n&gt; important. I would only \n&gt; use it, at this point, as integrated with Maven.\n\nI advocate a certain style of development (and perhaps\na tool to go with it). If I have N hours of\ndevelopment/testing left before I have to switch to my\nnext task or risk causing scheduling problems, I would\nuse a code coverage tool with drill-down report\ncapabilities to highlight which areas of the codebase\nneed most attention.\n\nTesting absolutely everything is not feasible (or even\nuseful) in practice. By comparison, knowing how best\nto partition your remaining on-task time to get the\nbest mileage out of your test is valuable.\n\nNot particularly novel, I suppose, but different from\nthe traditional approach of merely validating code\ncoverage (usually when it&#39;s too late to do the right\nthing about it).\n\nUsing a static analysis or a code coverage tool to\ndirect you towards product areas that need attention\nand doing it in a team environment has become possible\nonly recently, with the advent of tools that are:\n\n- free, so software licensing for large teams is a\nnon-issue\n- fast, so that rapid &quot;code some, test some&quot; iterative\nwork remains rapid\n\nIn a modest way, EMMA tries to be one such tool.\n\nCheers,\nVlad.\n\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
