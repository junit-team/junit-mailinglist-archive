If I<br/>\nthink about the biggest benefits of writing unit tests, they are:<br/>\n1) Make sure the code works (quality)<br/>\n2) Make sure the code stays working (regression/maintenance)<br/>\n<br/>\nNeither of these are critical on an interview.  Clearly #2 doesn&#39;t<br/>\nmatter.  It&#39;s an exercise that will never make it to production, let<br/>\nalone be maintained.<br/>\n<br/>\n#1 is more interesting.  On first glance, one would think the code<br/>\nneeds to work at an interview.  While that&#39;s nice, I don&#39;t view that<br/>\nas the most important thing when I am interviewing.  I am more<br/>\ninterested in seeing how the candidate thinks, looks up information,<br/>\nreacts to errors, whether he/she seems comfortable with basic Java<br/>\nidioms.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my opinion, more organizations should have candidates writing code<br/>\non a computer as part of the interview.  This is still rarer than I<br/>\nwould like.</div>",
