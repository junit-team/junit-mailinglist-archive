I will be very pleased\nif you share =\r\nyour expreince about the test run time,perfomance,plugins\netc..\n\nWe have be=\r\nen using maven and since 6 months maven2 in our project\n(which uses multipl=\r\ne sub-projects). I like the IDE integration and it\nworks well with our cont=\r\ninuous build system (Luntbuild and currently\nas trial TeamCity). I think pe=\r\nrformance depends more on other factors.\nOne developer on our team was comp=\r\nlaining about the build time with\nall tests, which on his machine took more=\r\n than 10 minutes (and because\nof that he didn&#39;t run them often enough). On =\r\nmy machine (different OS,\ndifferent hardware) I got it down to 2-3 minutes.=\r\n In order to solve\nhis long build time, we are trying out TeamCity now, so =\r\nthat a\ndeveloper can run the tests on the build server before checking in h=\r\nis\ncode. The build server can scaled and optimized.\n\nMaven has a learning c=\r\nurve as all tools but until now we are pleased\nwith it. I does what it shou=\r\nld be doing. I recently mavenized 3 old\nlegacy projects and it was nice to =\r\nsee how it simplified things, which\nshould save time and money.\n\nRegards,\n\n=\r\nHarald\n\n--\nCITOCON EUROPE 2007 - Brussels - October 19 & 20, 2007\nhttp://ww=\r\nw.citconf.com/brussels2007/\nLast week for registration!\n-- \nHarald Walker -=\r\n www.bitwalker.nl\nLinkedIn - http://www.linkedin.com/in/haraldwalker \n\n\n",
