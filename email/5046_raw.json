I created a collection ( \ncollection &quot;A&quot;) that contains my expected results. My test case \ncreates a collection (collection &quot;B&quot;). Now I need to ensure that the \nitems in &quot;A&quot; are the same items that are in &quot;B&quot;. I can create my own \nmethod that takes both collections as parameters and returns a \nboolean if the items are the same ( by looping through the \ncollections) but was wondering if there was a way to use an assert* \nmethod to do the same thing.\n\nThanks.\n\n\n\n",
