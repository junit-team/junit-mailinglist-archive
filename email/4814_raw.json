Why protected?\n\nThere is a trade off between exposing your class and letting others have limited access.\n\n2.  Why same package structure?\n\nTo take advantage of the protected nature of the variable.  A test class can now directly manipulate a variable to assert the proper workings of the set / get classes.\n\n3.  Why set directly?\n\nSet the variable directly, then assert against the get and / or set methods.\n\n\nI provided a brief example at the end of this email. \n\nAs a quick preference  I rarely just create &quot;get&quot; and &quot;set&quot; methods because I have a particular state variable.  I feel that it done primarily because everyone seems to do it as oppose to doing it for functional reasons.  \n\nIf anything, I will only allow for get methods to avoid corrupting my object.  In general, I prefer to wait until there is a functional need to have get and set methods, otherwise I keep the variable &quot;private&quot; and completely hidden for others not use, or see.\n\nandrew f\n\n````````````````````````````\n\nA brief example of how I test get / set methods.\n\n+ /src/main\n     org.blah.util.MyClass.java\n\n       protected int i_;\n       public int getI() { ... }\n       public void setI(int i) { ...  }\n\n+ /src/testsuite\n     org.blah.util.MyClassTest.java\n\n       MyClass myc;\n\n       public void setUp() {\n         myc = new MyClass();\n       }     \n\n       public void test_setA() {\n         int expected = 1;\n         myc.i_ = expected;\n         int actual = myc.getI();\n         assertEquals(expected,actual);\n       }\n\n\n\nstate variables protected\n\n\nAs a quick aside, I usually do not create get / set methods \n\nIf I\n\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: raju99 \n  To: junit@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Wednesday, May 01, 2002 2:27 PM\n  Subject: [junit] Testing getXXX( ) and setXXX( ) methods\n\n\n  Hi,\n\n  I am trying to answer the following question for myself -\n  &quot;What is the best approach for testing get/set methods ?&quot;\n\n  I have my approach outlined below and would welcome comments.\n\n  Take the example :\n\n  public class Car {\n      private String _color;\n\n      public String getColor() {\n          return _color\n      }\n\n      public void setColor(String color$) {\n          _color = color$;\n      }\n\n  }\n\n  To me, the &#39;best&#39; approach seems to be the following :\n\n  1. Create an inner class CarTest that will test this class.\n\n  2. in the setUp() method, create a new Car obect and set the\n  internal field to the &quot;test&quot; value. i.e. set the field values \n  directly.\n\n  3. Testing the get method\n\n  Call the get method and make sure the &#39;test&#39; value is correctly\n  returned by the get method.\n\n  4. Testing the set method\n\n  Call the set method with a new value.\n  Check the internal field and verify that the value is the\n  one specified via set().\n\n  I&#39;m interested in opinions/suggestions.\n\n  Thanks,\n\n  Raju\n\n\n\n        Yahoo!
