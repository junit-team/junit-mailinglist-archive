It turned out to be pretty tricky to set up, and<br/>\nthe tests themselves were hard to read and create.  The general<br/>\nconsensus is that it&#39;s best to use these class-mocking methods in an<br/>\nattempt to test while you are refactoring towards an easier to test<br/>\ndesign.  One way might be to create an interface of your own that is<br/>\neither a thin wrapper of the target class, or else an interface that<br/>\nexposes only the functionality that you use - though the difficulty of<br/>\nthis varies based on what the library actually does.  If you take this<br/>\napproach, you might be able to reduce the direct coupling with the third<br/>\nparty library, if (some might say when?) you&#39;re required to change<br/>\nvendors.<br/>\n<br/>\nWorking with Legacy Code has a few sections on exactly this kind of<br/>\nissue (separating concerns and dependencies on third party libraries,<br/>\nnot jMock with CGLIB).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;The good news is I am using Spring Framework in my application. I<br/>\n&gt;could use dependency injection to inject the third party classs into<br/>\n&gt;my class. If I don&#39;t have the interface for the third party, Spring<br/>\n&gt;would still inject the implementation class for me using CGLib instead<br/>\n&gt;of dynamic proxy, right?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not sure on this one and will have to hand this off to folks with<br/>\nsome experience with jMock/CGLib with Spring. \r<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDaniel Wellman<br/>\nU.S. Trust<br/>\nPh: (201) 533-6157<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nThe message contains confidential and/or legally privileged\r<br/>\n<br/>\ninformation and is intended for use by the indicated addressee. \r<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are not the intended addressee: (a) any disclosure,\r<br/>\n<br/>\nreproduction, distribution or action you take because of it is\r<br/>\n<br/>\nstrictly prohibited; (b) please return the complete message to the\r<br/>\n<br/>\nsender; and (c) this message is not a solicitation for purchase or\r<br/>\n<br/>\nsale or an agreement of any kind whatsoever that binds the sender.<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------------------------------------------</div>",
