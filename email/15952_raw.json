Meanwhile, I&#39;d \n&gt; &gt; like to talk with you about Java 3D. I&#39;m trying to\n&gt; make a little \n&gt; &gt; exploration in sensorial capacity, but how to test\n&gt; it? Do I need to \n&gt; &gt; make a Java 3D application inside the test or is\n&gt; there a more elegant \n&gt; &gt; solution?\n&gt; You&#39;ll have to fill me in on what you mean by\n&gt; &quot;sensorial capacity&quot;.  I \n&gt; have some experience with Java3D.  The approach that\n&gt; worked the best is \n&gt; similar to what UI people call &quot;Humble Dialog&quot;: try\n&gt; to keep the actual \n&gt; rendering isolated to a very thin layer on top of a\n&gt; rich model.  This \n&gt; way, you can test the colors, positions, and\n&gt; relationships of objects \n&gt; without even referencing the Java3D API.  You may be\n&gt; able to get the \n&gt; rendering layer so thin that you can trust it after\n&gt; manual inspection \n&gt; and user testing, or you may need to use some other\n&gt; acceptance testing \n&gt; technique.  Good luck,\n&gt; \n&gt;     David Saff\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo!
