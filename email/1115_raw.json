The one\nquestion I get a lot is, &quot;How do we test the results of a database query?&quot;\nThe former method of testing the query, was to manually review the results.\nThe one solution we&#39;ve come up with is to perform the query, save the\nresults to a file, then assert that the results from the live query are\nequivalent to the stored results in the file. This gets a little more tricky\nwhen the results data contains time-sensitive fields (i.e. date fields).\n\nAnyway, I just wanted to know whether anyone had come up with a simpler\nand/or better solution.\n\n- Mike\n\n\n",
