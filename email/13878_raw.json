Apart from using\n&gt; &gt; a faster CVS server, that is.\n&gt;\n&gt; Well...\n&gt;\n&gt; 1. I use Subversion, so I don&#39;t have the same CVS issues you seem to\n&gt; have. It also looks like you have far too much stuff in a single CVS\n&gt; server or module. It looks like it&#39;s time to split them.\n\nI don&#39;t think we can change to subversion; too many users (potential\nor real) would have to change as well. (I don&#39;t know if we can mirror\na CVS with a subversion or vice-versa. A year or so ago I did try and\nfind if there was a CVS mirror application, so that we could use a \nlocal CVS server for development and refresh the remote CVS asynchronously,\nbut my Google-fu was low.)\n\nFor similar (user-oriented) reasons, I don&#39;t *think* we could split\nthe codebase into multiple modules. \n\nOn good days, the CVS is acceptably fast. It&#39;s just that the bad days\nhappen when you need speed. At least it seems that way.\n\n&gt; 2. It looks like you&#39;re spending a great deal of your effort maintaining\n&gt; test suites. I suppose you have to do that for some good reason, but\n&gt; when I run my tests, I run them all. If I need two categories of tests,\n&gt; that&#39;s two source trees. (test/source and slowtest/source)\n\nPerhaps I didn&#39;t paint a correct picture. The only suite maintenance\nwe usually do is that the tests for package X.P, which live in X.P.test,\nare collected into a suite (usually, and I think suboptimally, named\nTestPackage); and X.test has a suite that includes X.P.test.TestPackage,\netc upwards.\n\nSo when a new test [suite] materialises, there&#39;s a one-line edit in\nthe appropriate TestPackage.\n \n[The DB tests are a separate subsuite, but share code because of\n abstract test cases.]\n\n&gt; 3. How often do you want to run only a subset of tests that isn&#39;t, for\n&gt; example, a coherent package of tests?\n\nHardly ever. Just sometimes, I&#39;d like to assemble a nonce suite of\n&quot;that one there, this one here&quot;; it&#39;s never been enough of a problem\nto force a solution.\n\n&gt; In Eclipse, I mostly right-click\n&gt; either the source tree or the package and run the tests.\n\nYes. (Actually, mostly it&#39;s left-click the Run button.) \n\n&gt; 4. For the &quot;helper code&quot;, I generally make that stuff class-level as\n&gt; preparation for the refactoring, so it doesn&#39;t get in my way while I&#39;m\n&gt; moving tests around. I spend less time in limbo with compile errors or\n&gt; red tests.\n\nThat&#39;s a possibility. I&#39;ll bear that in mind for the next time; of course,\nit does add another step, but the payback might be worth it.\n\n&gt; 5. Yes, I would imagine you have too many global caches. :)\n\nI&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s one or two ...\n\nActually, the nasty dependency problem is bnodes - &quot;blank nodes&quot; in\nRDF - which have nonce IDs based on UIDs. Which means they&#39;re different\neach run. Which means they hash differently ditto. Which means things\ncome out of tables in different orders. Which means that order-dependent\nbuggy code can appear to work ...\n\n... which means that we all know that if that appears to be happening\n(ie tests will pass, then fail, with no code changes) we lock down the\nbnode ID generation. \n\n&gt; 6. I&#39;m not sure why renaming a recently-created class is such a pain,\n&gt; even in CVS: it hardly has any history to worry about, so I wouldn&#39;t\n&gt; worry about it.\n\nIt&#39;s just the Historical Broken Record; experience shows that I&#39;m likely\nto make a mistake when doing it.\n\n&gt; How long does this whole dance actually take for you? I imagine it&#39;s\n&gt; more than one minute.\n\nI&#39;d call it five. Not flowy.\n\n[I just did a CVS update; `time` reports that it took 1m11.938s, ie,\n significantly over a minute. No updates arrived.]\n\n-- \nChris &quot;electric hedgehog&quot; Dollin\nIt&#39;s called *extreme* programming, not *stupid* programming.\n\n\n",
