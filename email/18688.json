Off the<br/>\ntop of my head,<br/>\n<br/>\n- to drive the design<br/>\n- to document the design<br/>\n- to demonstrate correctness<br/>\n- to provide a safety net when changing unfamiliar code<br/>\n<br/>\nThis latter case, which Michael Feathers talks a great deal about in<br/>\nWELC, is probably one of the most common reasons that people want<br/>\nautomated tests.<br/>\n<br/>\nPutting it another way,<br/>\n<br/>\n  if I change this line of code, what other behavior will change will<br/>\nchange as a result<br/>\n<br/>\nWe ask ourselves this question every time we maintain unfamiliar code<br/>\nin an unfamiliar system without tests. The most conscientious<br/>\ndevelopers write tests before changing that line of code. Most don&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is such a common activity in software development that a program<br/>\nthat could characterize the behavior of another program and report<br/>\nwhen the behavior has changed would be useful wouldn&#39;t it?<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to JB&#39;s observation about whether it&#39;s possible to generate such<br/>\ntests for non-trivial programs - it&#39;s still early days for JUnit<br/>\nFactory but I think you&#39;d be surprised by what&#39;s already possible.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKevin<br/>\n<br/>\nwww.junitfactory.com<br/>\nYou send us code.
