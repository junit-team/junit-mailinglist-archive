Please suggest that your GUI developer take a deep breath<br/>\n&gt; and think relaxing thoughts. You could also suggest that they try<br/>\n&gt; chanting &quot;google is my friend&quot;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Point: Does JUnit have a GUI Development IDE?. With Drag and Drop<br/>\n&gt; &gt; features?.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; No.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; That&#39;s why I said I am plying with netBeans and/or Java Studio 8. By the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; way Java Studio 8 is built on netBeans. netBeans do have the Graphical<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Drag and Drop Features to Build the GUIs Soon, than by laying out the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; interface by hand.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I will be glad if he can tell me how to do this in Junit (point above).<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I can then forget netBeans or anything else.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; -Kumar&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Joel Altman<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Shuttle Training Aircraft Project<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your GUI developer needs a different tool than JUnit for their GUI<br/>\n&gt; testing. I don&#39;t write GUI&#39;s, so I can&#39;t help in any way other than<br/>\n&gt; suggesting that the good folks at google may be of help.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I do write GUI and don&#39;t understand the question your developer is asking.<br/>\nHe seems to be confusing GUI builders with testing. Has he he written a<br/>\nsimple unit test for some non GUI dialog?<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the subject of Unit testing the GUI are we talking about a web based app<br/>\n(try Fitnesse (sp?) or some other acceptance testing mechanism) or a rich<br/>\nclient application (in which case start reading Micheal Feathers &quot;The Humble<br/>\nDialog&quot;).<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<br/>\nMark<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
