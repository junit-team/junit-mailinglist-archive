B. Rainsberger and all the others who participated in my thread a \nfew weeks ago:\n\nNow Eclipse 3.0 supports what I was looking for: \nhttp://sunsite.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/eclipse/downloads/drops/R-\n3.0-200406251208/eclipse-news-part7-R3.html\n\nTake a look at header &quot;JUnit Integration&quot;: &quot;JUnit now supports \ndecorating an individual test for a test run. This is done by \nimplementing a public static setUpTest(Test) method in your TestCase \nclass ...&quot;\n\nI had not yet the time to test your solution. Now there is a \nsolution by Eclipse.\n\nBy the way, I want to use it to override setUp(). It needs to create \nan entity in the database because all other tests are depending on \nthat entity in the database. I do this because I want to have as few \npreconditions for our tests as possible. But lets not dig deeper in \nthis, because I will not follow this discussion very much longer.\n\nRainsberger, you write you consider using tearDown() a smell. We use \nthis method for our persistance layer tests. For each entity (like \nArticle, Supplier and so on) we have a test case class with methods \nlike testCreateArticle, testUpdateArticle, testDeleteArticle, \ntestGetArticleById, testArticleIdValidation and so on. The tearDown\n() deletes the created entities. So it is not just something like \ninstanceVariable = null. I don&#39;t consider tearDown() as code smell.\n\n\n\n",
