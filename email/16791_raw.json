TDD is a powerful tool, but not as much as &quot;simple  \n&gt; testing&quot;.  If a\n&gt; developer prefers to write code first and tests then, that&#39;s  \n&gt; perfectly fine\n&gt; with me.\n\nIt&#39;s not fine with me.  In the end, if a developer can show me that s/ \nhe&#39;s got very high test coverage, then I&#39;d accept the effort.  But  \nI&#39;d also strongly suggest that they write their tests first next time  \nto see if they don&#39;t find that they get done quicker and with a  \nbetter design.\n\n&gt; The important point here is that this developer needs to agree\n&gt; that writing tests is part of her job.  At least to a certain extent.\n\nI disagree that there is a limited responsibility.  A developer  \nshould not release code that they haven&#39;t tested.  They should not  \nrelease a line of code that they have not tested.  Every line, every  \nstatement, every condition should be tested before the developer  \nreleases the code.  It seems to me that&#39;s a minimum professional  \nstandard.  Releasing code that you have not thoroughly tested is,  \nsimply, unprofessional.\n\n----\nRobert C.
