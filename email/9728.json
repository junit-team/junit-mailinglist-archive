I suspect that if you can<br/>\nclarify this, you will have answered your question.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are probably at least three questions to be dealt with:<br/>\n<br/>\n1\tIs the data being presented valid?<br/>\n2\tIs the PDF (or whatever) representation of the text/graphics<br/>\n\tcorrect?<br/>\n3\tIs the data being rendered as expected?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first and second are traditional unit testing problems.  You do the<br/>\nfirst kind of testing, Adobe or whoever presumably has done the second.<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps an example of a failure in the third area would be output where<br/>\ndata that should be in tables appears in the body of the text or vice<br/>\nversa, or data that should be represented as a pie chart appears as a<br/>\nbar graph instead.  So you want to make assertions like<br/>\n<br/>\n\tassertTrue ( outputIsPieChart(datasetA) );<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Especially for applications whose whole purpose is report generation,<br/>\n&gt; I wonder how people are doing this (if at all)?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>--<br/>\nJim Dixon  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jdd@...\">jdd@...</a>   tel +44 117 982 0786  mobile +44 797 373 7881</div>",
