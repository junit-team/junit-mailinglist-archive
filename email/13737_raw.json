You know that only one of them failed (maybe a setUp or another\n&gt; test) and all the other ones are failing in cascade.\n&gt; \n&gt; And you also know that you probably only need to fix *1* test to come back\n&gt; to &quot;101 SUCCESSES&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now, wouldn&#39;t it be nice if the testing framework told you exactly *which*\n&gt; test you should look at first?\n\nI get the feeling that we only need to add one feature to JUnit to have \nit match TestNG in this regard: labeling tests as &quot;SetUp failed&quot; when \nsetUp() throws an exception. Right now, they are usually reported as \nerrors, and so are lumped in with other unexpected exceptions.\n-- \nJ. B.
