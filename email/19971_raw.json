The problem is a\nClassCastExcep=\r\ntion in BaseTestRunner when loading our suite class.  In\nJUnit 3, it didn&#39;t=\r\n matter what type of class was loaded as long as it\nhad a static suite() me=\r\nthod with no arguments.  But now in JUnit 4,\nthe class must extend TestCase=\r\n.  I don&#39;t understand why this is\nnecessary - the getTest() method returns =\r\nthe Test interface and\ninternally it still uses reflection to get the stati=\r\nc suite() method.\n So why does the code cast the Class to a TestCase?  It s=\r\neems like\nthis is a case of overzealous use of the new parameterized types =\r\nin\nJava 5 and a regression from JUnit 3.\n\nAlso, in JUnit 3 the method loadS=\r\nuiteClass() called getLoader() to get\nthe ClassLoader to use, which opened =\r\nthe door for extensibility.  This\nis gone now, why?\n\nThanks in advance...\n\n=\r\n\n\n",
