(correctness)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I had to guess, the original poster appears to be asking for<br/>\nordering for correctness, but Cedric&#39;s blog post seems to be handling<br/>\nordering for efficiency.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m happy to discuss my opinions on either or both, but first, do we<br/>\nagree on the distinction?<br/>\n<br/>\n   David Saff<br/>\n<br/>\n2009/12/23 Cédric Beust ♔ &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cbeust@...\">cbeust@...</a>&gt;:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Hi Kent,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; A few precisions:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On Wed, Dec 23, 2009 at 7:50 AM, Kent Beck &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kentb@...\">kentb@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Tests are executed in an unspecified order. There is no way to define an<br/>\n&gt;&gt; order, because in my experience independent tests are much more valuable<br/>\n&gt;&gt; than order-dependent tests.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Every time I&#39;ve had order dependencies I have had a problem with the design<br/>\n&gt;&gt; of the underlying system. Investing my available time in improving the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; design has had a much higher payoff than investing that same time into<br/>\n&gt;&gt; shuffling tests around.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I found that if the testing framework takes care of removing certain<br/>\n&gt; practical obstacles, dependent testing is actually very easy to implement<br/>\n&gt; and to use.  For example, if method c() depends on b() and a() and you only<br/>\n&gt; want to run c(), you should be able to say &quot;run c()&quot; and the framework will<br/>\n&gt; figure out which dependencies need to be run.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My experience with TestNG showed me that the fears often associated with<br/>\n&gt; test dependencies are very overstated, and dependent testing is actually<br/>\n&gt; extremely useful for a lot of scenarios such as web testing (where<br/>\n&gt; navigating from page to page adds state at each step, and having to recreate<br/>\n&gt; that state from scratch would be very expensive).  Users of Selenium +<br/>\n&gt; TestNG with dependencies can probably make a good case at giving you more<br/>\n&gt; details on this.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Independent tests enable interesting transformations like parallel<br/>\n&gt;&gt; execution or the kind of dynamic reordering that let JUnit Max deliver<br/>\n&gt;&gt; failures more quickly.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Dependencies and parallelism are actually not mutually exclusive at all.<br/>\n&gt;  Here are a couple of articles I wrote that describe the multithreaded<br/>\n&gt; topological sort algorithm that I implemented in TestNG:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://beust.com/weblog/archives/000535.html\">http://beust.com/weblog/archives/000535.html</a><br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://beust.com/weblog/archives/000536.html\">http://beust.com/weblog/archives/000536.html</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This should be especially of interest to developers interested in hard<br/>\n&gt; concurrency issues, but all this complexity is completely hidden away from<br/>\n&gt; users.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; With TestNG, you specify your dependencies (e.g. &quot;@Test(dependsOnMethods =<br/>\n&gt; &quot;f&quot;)), then your thread pool size (thread-pool-size=15) and TestNG will<br/>\n&gt; figure out how to run all your tests (both dependent and non dependent ones)<br/>\n&gt; in the most efficient parallel manner by using the threads you supplied as<br/>\n&gt; well as possible.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; ***Cédric<br/>\n&gt; *<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
