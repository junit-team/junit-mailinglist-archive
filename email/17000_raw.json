I needed\n&gt; &gt; to write some tests around a user =\r\nbelonging to a group.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I needed at a minimum an implementation of I=\r\nDfUser and IDfGroup. \nDue to the\n&gt; &gt; nature of the beast it is most common =\r\nto get these from the \nsession\n&gt; &gt; (IDfSession). As all of these are interf=\r\naces it wasn&#39;t too bad \nbut each of\n&gt; &gt; the interfaces extends others and h=\r\nave several hundred methods \neach. I\n&gt; &gt; eventually decided that what I was=\r\n trying to test in this case was\n&gt; &gt; Documentum logic and that I should jus=\r\nt trust the framework.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Another example is Documentum web component=\r\ns which are similiar \nin some ways\n&gt; &gt; to JSF. These extend standard Docume=\r\nntum classes which provide a \nlarge\n&gt; &gt; amount of functionality much of whi=\r\nch eventually ties back to a \nfunctionaing\n&gt; &gt; sql database via a custom in=\r\nterface and/or query language. In \nthese cases\n&gt; &gt; the best I could do was =\r\nto test extracted business logic \npiecemeal.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m having difficulty see=\r\ning how these statements relate \nto &quot;various \n&gt; mocking libraries&quot; having &quot;=\r\ntoo many moving parts to be useful for \nmore \n&gt; than trivial tests&quot;. It see=\r\nms the problem lies in the Documentum \nAPI and \n&gt; not in mocking libraries.=\r\n What am I missing?\n\nThe &quot;too many moving parts&quot; comment was directed at my=\r\n test code ie I \nneeded to add too much custom code to the mocks to allow t=\r\nhem to talk \nto each other as required. It is directly attributable to the =\r\n\nDocumentum API and the interconnectedness of its many interfaces. It \nhas =\r\nnothing to do with the usefulness of jmock etc.\n\nMichael Rutherfurd\n\n\n\n\n",
