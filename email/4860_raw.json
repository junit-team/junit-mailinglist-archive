There is no substitute for experience.  But it does make me feel the \npain of overly coupled, hard-to-test code that causes me to go look for a \nbetter solution.\n\nAs I have improved my test-first skills, I have learned to use that pain as \na signal.  Why does testing this code hurt so much?  It could be because \nI&#39;m stupid and need a coffee break, but it&#39;s probably because my code has a \nproblem and I need to find a better way.  I think about it for a bit, and \nif I don&#39;t come up with a solution, I hunt around for ideas in a book \nwritten by someone who knows more than I do, or I ask a list with a lot of \npeople on it who know more than I do.  I learn something and the pain goes \naway.  Now I have some new techniques for eliminating &quot;file-angst&quot;.\n\nThanks for all of the great feedback :-)\n\nAt 06:50 PM 5/1/2002 -0700, you wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Notice, everyone, how the test tool suggested a change that makes this\n&gt; &gt; class more generally useful. Hmmmm.\n&gt;\n&gt;Well, not exactly: One solution (&quot;a directory full of a bunch of xml\n&gt;catalog file variations becomes more readable and understandable than a\n&gt;bunch of code.&quot;) didn&#39;t require any change to the code and is seen as a\n&gt;better solution.  The tool&#39;s suggestion was I think not that obvious.\n&gt;\n&gt;If it was so obvious, why did David take the time to ask the question to\n&gt;the group?\n&gt;\n&gt;I think that you still need some experience to smell the refactoring.\n&gt;\n&gt;-Vladimir\n&gt;\n\nDavid Olivier\nNaval Research Laboratory\nDigital Mapping, Charting & Geodesy Analysis Program\nCode 7440.2\n\n\n",
