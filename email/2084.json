Sorry about that.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo, and that is by design. One of the key requirements of unit testing is <br/>\n&quot;Report for each test only &#39;pass&#39; or &#39;fail&#39;.&quot; Five assertions failures is no <br/>\nmore broken than one. It supports a specific technique and changing it would <br/>\nbe a Bad Thing, in the authors&#39; eyes. I agree with them.<br/>\n<br/>\nCan you factor into multiple tests? Why do you care about the number of <br/>\nfailed assertions in a test?<br/>\n<br/>\nYou may not appreciate the question. (&quot;I *did* think about this, you know!&quot;) <br/>\nAnswer it, anyway. You may be surprised what we can tell you.<br/>\n<br/>\nJBR.<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp\">http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp</a></div>",
