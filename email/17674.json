You seem to imply that we are not also practitioners. I suspect <br/>\n&gt; you&#39;re not an asshole, so I imagine you mean something else. I would <br/>\n&gt; appreciate you clarifying this position. Is it necessarily the case, <br/>\n&gt; then, that &quot;the sort of programmers who... hang out on lists like this <br/>\n&gt; one&quot; don&#39;t know what we&#39;re talking about, because I kinda think I do and <br/>\n&gt; I kinda think I&#39;ve proven that.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You do know what you&#39;re talking about, and you are practitioners, as am <br/>\nI. However you&#39;re making the classic mistake of assuming that everyone <br/>\nelse is just like you, and that what works for you works for them. This <br/>\nis a *HUGE* and unrecognized fallacy that underlies a lot more than <br/>\nprogramming methodologies. For instance, it&#39;s largely responsible for <br/>\nthe failure of modern elementary and secondary education, which works <br/>\nfor maybe 5% of children. However that&#39;s those 5% that go onto become <br/>\nteachers and principles and propagate the same techniques to future <br/>\ngenerations, while ignoring the failure of 95% of their students.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe simple fact is that people learn and think differently. No one <br/>\ntechnique works for everyone, but some techniques do work for more <br/>\npeople. We tend to self-select into groups that think similarly and <br/>\nlearn similarly to ourselves. The people who like interfaces are a <br/>\nself-selected group of programmers who think at a very high degree of <br/>\nabstraction, even for programmers (already a self-selected and abstract <br/>\nbunch). This doesn&#39;t mean they don&#39;t produce quality software. It does <br/>\nmean that you can&#39;t expect what works for them to work for all or even <br/>\nmost developers.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n﻿Elliotte Rusty Harold  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:elharo@...\">elharo@...</a><br/>\nJava I/O 2nd Edition Just Published!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafeaulait.org/books/javaio2/\">http://www.cafeaulait.org/books/javaio2/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596527500/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/\">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596527500/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/</a></div>",
