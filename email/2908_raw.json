But it is simple too.\n\nPlease correct me if I&#39;m wrong somewhere!\n\nJunitEE project has been very quiet but I like it!\nI like Cactus too and have difficulties in deciding\nwhat I want to use!\n\nKaarle Kaila\n\n&gt; gopala krishnan T wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; hello\n&gt; &gt; i would like to know, how to test session beans, i mean is \n&gt; &gt; there any process or procedure for testing session beans,\n&gt; &gt; an early reply is appreciated.\n&gt; &gt; gopal krishnan\n&gt; &gt;\n..........\n&gt; Hi ,\n&gt; I founded a framework for named Cactus testing EJB&#39;s , Servlets , \n&gt; Tag-Libs , Filters , ...\n&gt; It&#39;s a subproject from Jakarta , and it&#39;s based on JUnit\n&gt; \n&gt; http://jakarta.apache.org/cactus\n\n\n\n\n",
