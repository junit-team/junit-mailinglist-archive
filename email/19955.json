Every time I run a testSuite I<br/>\ngot a summary report about what methods failed and which passed. I<br/>\nthink this is Junit&#39;s expected behaviour.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe point is that when I try to run my testSuites alltogether at a<br/>\ntime, I got no summary (just a line telling me the most general test,<br/>\nthe one which launches the other testSuites, passed). It seems that<br/>\nJunit stops quietly, so I am afraid it may fail. <br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, I forced some of the tests to fail, then I got some<br/>\nsummary output but only for those methods which failed. <br/>\n<br/>\nI do know whether this is related to my code or is it an issue from<br/>\nJunit. I would be glad if anybody familiar with this could shed some<br/>\nlight...<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance<br/>\n<br/>\nDiego</div>",
