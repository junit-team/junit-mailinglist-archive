The methods should\ninitially be tested =\r\nin the parent class, but sometimes the inherited\nmethods are needed to veri=\r\nfy tests on the inherited class, e.g. a\nget-method.\n\nFor example:\nclass A{\n=\r\n  protected int no =3D 1;\n\n  protected changeNo(){\n    no =3D 2;\n  }\n\n  pro=\r\ntected getNo{\n    return no;\n  }\n}\n\nclass B entends A{\n  protected changeNo=\r\n(){\n    no =3D 3;\n  }\n}\n\nWhen testing changeNo in class B, I would like to =\r\nverify that no =3D=3D 3,\n but I cannot access no or A.getNo since they are =\r\nnot returned in\nobject.getClass().getDeclaredFields() or\nobject.getClass().=\r\ngetDeclaredMethods() when called on class B.\n\nI could put all my tests in t=\r\nhe same package as the classes being\ntested, but I would like to avoid that=\r\n.\n\n- Louise\n\n\n",
