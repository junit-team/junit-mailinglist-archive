I need to use URLClassLoader to load classes from projects I want my plugin to monitor (or is there by any chance much better way i didn&#39;t think of?) - the first URL in the constructor points at monitored project output directory. But without the second URL classes were loaded without @Test annotations. While debugging i discovered exception <br/>\n<br/>\ncom.sun.jdi.ClassNotLoadedException: Type has not been loaded occurred while retrieving component type of array. <br/>\n<br/>\nwhile trying to preview method&#39;s annotations. So i added another URL which points at JUnit jar from Eclipse. Annotations appeared but i&#39;m not 100% sure why it worked.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever,  I just run some tests and it seems, that:<br/>\n<br/>\nclazzLoader.loadClass(&quot;org.junit.Test&quot;).equals(Test.class)<br/>\n<br/>\nevaluates to false... I don&#39;t know what to do - is there any way i could decorate JUnitCore with my URLClassLoader? Because as far as i know (and i&#39;ve spent some time googling for it) using URLClassLoader is the only sensible way to dynamically load classes from class files...  <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your reply Gilles and once again, i&#39;d be very grateful for any more help.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest regards,<br/>\nMichal Olejnik<br/>\n<br/>\nPS. Forgive me if my english is bad, but i&#39;ve been fighting with this for whole day and i&#39;m just too tired to pay much attention to grammar and spelling. However i hope what i wrote is not very hard to understand<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, Gilles Scokart &lt;gscokart@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Is the @Test referenced by the unit test and the @Test used by the runner<br/>\n&gt; coming from the same classloader ?

So far i&#39;m only loading every class that is changed using<br/>\n&gt; &gt; IResourceChangedListener and URLClassLoader:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; URLClassLoader classLoader = new URLClassLoader(new URL[]<br/>\n&gt; &gt; {outputDirectory.toURL(), new<br/>\n&gt; &gt; URL(&quot;file:/D:/eclipse/plugins/org.junit4_4.3.1/junit.jar&quot;) });<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Class&lt;?&gt; clazz = classLoader.loadClass(fileName);<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; At this point everything looks great - when i modify JUnit4 test class it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; gets loaded with annotations on proper methods (thanks to second URL -<br/>\n&gt; &gt; without it no annotation was loaded, and to be honest i don&#39;t know why).<br/>\n&gt; &gt; However, things start to go wrong when i pass the loaded class to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; JUnitCore.run method - the result i always get says that there was &quot;No<br/>\n&gt; &gt; runnable method&quot; exception even though there are clearly some method<br/>\n&gt; &gt; annotaded with @Test...<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I have little experience in writing plugins for Eclipse, so i&#39;m kind of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; lost now... I may suspect, that the problem is with not sufficient classpath<br/>\n&gt; &gt; (cause it seems that it was a reason why i had to add another URL to class<br/>\n&gt; &gt; loader) of my plugin. So i&#39;m asking if anyone ever tried to dynamically load<br/>\n&gt; &gt; test classes from Eclipse plugin and run them using JUnitCore - if so, I&#39;d<br/>\n&gt; &gt; be very grateful for helping me out with this problem.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Thanks in advance.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Best regards,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Michal Olejnik<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  <br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
