The purpose of a\nMedia=\r\ntor is to decouple individual controls from each other. We&#39;re talking\nabout=\r\n a class that does more than that, we&#39;re talking about a class that\nsits be=\r\ntween the domain knowledge and the gui. I call such a class a\nPresenter, af=\r\nter the Model-View-Presenter architecture. Martin Fowler calls\nthis an Appl=\r\nication Fa=E7ade. Whatever you call it, it knows how to get what\nit needs f=\r\nrom the Model and it knows how to drive the gui. With that out of\nthe way, =\r\nlet&#39;s get specific.\n\n\n&gt; Here the problem arises.\n&gt; \n&gt; One example should be=\r\n if I would test my GUI behavior when something\n&gt; somewhere else changes.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; I.e. I&#39;m editing some fields to be sent later to a server and the conne=\r\nction\n&gt; goes down. Ok the mediator can do the great part of the job but wha=\r\nt if my\n&gt; current form should let me save the data into a file in order to =\r\nretrieve\n&gt; them later? That kind of knowledge lies inside the form (it&#39;s it=\r\ns own\n&gt; responsibility, above all!) while the constraints come from the out=\r\ner world.\n&gt; \n\nWell, you certainly COULD put the knowledge in the gui, but n=\r\now we&#39;re back\nto having to test it and worrying about how to test it and ma=\r\nintain it - a\njob that you&#39;re probably finding out is very difficult.\n\nWhat=\r\n if the Form gathers the information like it always does and sends it in\nth=\r\ne form of a message to the Presenter, which checks for a good db\nconnection=\r\n and decides what to do? I&#39;m back to a Presenter which is easy to\nunit test=\r\n and a gui that&#39;s dumber than dirt.\n\n\n-- \nRobert Koss, Ph.D.     | Training=\r\n, Mentoring, Contract Development\nSenior Consultant      | Object Oriented =\r\nDesign, C++, Java\nwww.objectmentor.com   | Extreme Programming\n\n\n\n",
