I see JUnit is great for nesting sub-suites within a suite<br/>\n&gt;  and<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; thereby creating a tree of suites. But when it comes to test<br/>\n&gt;  results,<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; is there a way to get a breakup of which sub-suite had how many<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; failures from TestResult?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  My philosophy has always been that all the tests should run. For a<br/>\n&gt;  while I had percentages of tests running in my GUIs, but then it hit<br/>\n&gt;  me. It&#39;s a *BINARY* computer. Pass means everything runs. Fail means<br/>\n&gt;  something doesn&#39;t run. Sort of a weakest link thing.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  This is also why successes aren&#39;t registered in TestResult. The sun<br/>\n&gt;  came up this morning. Gravity works. Ho hum. No need to write that<br/>\n&gt;  in the diary.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Re: internal sucking. The TestRunner hierarchy indeed bites. No<br/>\n&gt;  excuses. That&#39;s what 4.0 is for, when Erich and I get 3 days<br/>\n&gt;  together. In the meantime, nothing is stopping anyone from creating<br/>\n&gt;  their own (I&#39;ll be studying Michael&#39;s recent test case for ideas we<br/>\n&gt;  can steal.) As for testing EJBs, that was out of scope, so I&#39;m not<br/>\n&gt;  surprised it is more difficult than necessary. A test case like<br/>\n&gt;  Michael&#39;s would constitute constructive criticism.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Re: MIT course. I sent the instructor of the course a response, and<br/>\n&gt;  never heard anything back. Their complaints about JUnit, and their<br/>\n&gt;  linking of XP and JUnit, don&#39;t make sense to me. Of course<br/>\n&gt;  frameworks should come with docs, since I can&#39;t sit their with<br/>\n&gt;  everyone who has downloaded JUnit. And it does. Whether they are<br/>\n&gt;  good or not we can certainly debate, but they&#39;ve been good enough<br/>\n&gt;  for a bunch of folks. If someone wishes they had another doc as a<br/>\n&gt;  beginner, they are certainly welcome to write it and we&#39;ll put it in<br/>\n&gt;  the distribution.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Besides, the picture on the home page of their software engineering<br/>\n&gt;  course, software engineering being the quintessential team sport,<br/>\n&gt;  shows a row of people staring singly at computer screens and not<br/>\n&gt;  interacting with each other in any way.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Kent<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;     Yahoo!
