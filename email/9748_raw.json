The test methods\nare bound to the\n&gt; setup methods ie. they expected the setup to have\ngenerated some values\n&gt; which the test methods use for asserts.\n&gt; Now I want to change one particular setup method to\nset up the values\n&gt; differently so that I can test a different\nfunctionality, here I am\n&gt; trying to check if a proper exception is raised. The\napproach I trie was\n&gt; I made a sub-class of the BaseTest say ExtendedTest\nand here I overrided\n&gt; one of the setup functions and wrote a single test\nmethod which will\n&gt; assert for exception based on the new setup that was\ndone in the\n&gt; ExtendtedTest.\n&gt; But when I tried to run the test I found that Junit\nexecute all the\n&gt; tests that belonmg to the superClass testCase too\nand here it uses the\n&gt; overrdden setup methods and thus in my case all my\nsuper class tests\n&gt; fail.\n&gt; Is this the expected behavior ? Am I trying the\nright thing for my\n&gt; problem, is there a cleaner way for my kind of a\nrequirement ?\n\nYes, this is the expected behavior. If all Bs are As,\nthen you probably \nwant Bs to behave like As; therefore, you create BTest\nextends ATest, \nand when you execute BTest, you test whether Bs behave\nlike As by \ninheriting the tests from ATest. Makes sense, I think.\n\nIf you have two test case classes that want to share a\ntest fixture \n(setup), then extract the setup into an abstract\nsubclass of TestCase \n(called, say, TestFixture) and have the two test case\nclasses extend \nTestFixture rather than TestCase.\n\nAlso remember: if your TestCase adds /more/ test\nfixture, be sure to \ninvoke super.setUp()!\n-- \nJ.
