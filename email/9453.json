This makes no sense.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Telling people that code should not be commented, that comments are<br/>\n&gt; waste, remains extremely bad advice.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Your opinion. Enjoy it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  &gt; &gt; *  fewer comments correlate well with more bugs<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; Fewer comments are generally not the cause, though: fewer comments<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &#39;Correlates with&#39; does not mean &#39;causes&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m pretty sure that&#39;s what *I* wrote.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  &gt; &gt; *  as often as not, it&#39;s faster to rewrite uncommented code than it is<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;    to figure out what the code &quot;already says&quot;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; If the code is doing anything complex, if it is implementing rules<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; that contain domain-specific knowledge, comments are not waste --<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; they are absolutely essential.<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; Not essential, although they can help. If the code simply said what the<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; comments say, then they *would* be both the comments and the logic. It&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; simply a matter of choosing better names and extracting methods where<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; appropriate.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I really don&#39;t want to drag this out any further - but this makes no<br/>\n&gt; sense at all.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t need to drag it out any further, because Martin Fowler did it <br/>\nalready in his Refactoring book as well as Jeff Langr in his Java Style <br/>\nbook.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; In the real world, <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I rarely resort to this kind of language, but fuck right off. You do not <br/>\nknow me. You do not know what I have and have not done in the &quot;real <br/>\nworld&quot;. It scares me that I used to be that arrogant; it&#39;s a shame that <br/>\nyou still are.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt; [...] in most cases you can&#39;t explain your logic simply<br/>\n&gt; by choosing better variable names.  In most cases, you have to spell<br/>\n&gt; out why you are doing what you are doing.  Otherwise, whatever poor soul<br/>\n&gt; comes along a year or two later to fix your code is going to be lost.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Is that so? It&#39;s a good thing I&#39;ve never delivered maintainable code (as <br/>\nin, the maintainers told me so) with less than one comment per thousand <br/>\nlines. It&#39;s another good thing I haven&#39;t done it many times.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you change &quot;most&quot; to &quot;rare&quot;, then you&#39;re exactly right.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  &gt; I&#39;m not saying that I don&#39;t know how to write printf() or use the<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; debugger. I just choose not to when I can write tests instead. It&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; clear to me that tests provide the same benefits as printf() *and*<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; preserve what I have learn for posterity. &quot;It&#39;s no good to anyone else<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; in your head, Mozart. Write it down.&quot; (paraphrase of Salieri from the<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; film Amadeus.)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Take your own advice.  Don&#39;t keep it in your head.  Comment your code.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The variable names and method names *are* my comments, and they also <br/>\npass tests! When was the last time a comment passed a test?<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the way, I think you&#39;re confusing &quot;comments&quot; with &quot;documentation.&quot; <br/>\nRoadmap-style documentation and test cases as sample code are much, much <br/>\nmore effective than code-level comments. Much.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I won&#39;t drag this out any further. I see there would be no point.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
