Do you have a specific example in mind of how a TestSetup<br/>\n&gt; indicated that something was wrong.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have written an article on how singletons can defeat unit testing. I have<br/>\n&gt; observed that if a test relies on the state of a singleton, then there may<br/>\n&gt; be a desire to do one-time setup code and *that* is the sign of a code<br/>\n&gt; smell. Can you offer a different example? I&#39;d really like the opportunity to<br/>\n&gt; learn from it.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>For me, it is not a question of testing singletons.  It is a question of waiting<br/>\nfor a configuration file to be read, a logger hierarchy to be set up, a Component Manager<br/>\nto be populated, a Context to be popluated, the test to be run, and everything to be<br/>\ntorn down.  This occurs for _every_ test in the testcase.  The framework in question<br/>\nis well tested and scalable, the tests are for the Components loaded into the Component<br/>\nManager.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother example is testing RMI resources.  The testcase needs to set up the RMI<br/>\nserver code once because you will inevitably get a SocketException claiming that<br/>\nthe port you want to listen to is already bound.  In this case, the common TestCase<br/>\nclass is not sufficient.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks,<br/>\n&gt; JBR.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; Your FAQ suggests that for one-time setup code you need to run<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; it in a TestSuite.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This is what TestSetup is for. Wrap the suite in a subclass of<br/>\n&gt; TestSetup, override setUp() (and maybe tearDown()) in your subclass,<br/>\n&gt; and it only gets run once.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Alternatively, you could consider how to untangle your design so you<br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t need one-time setup.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Kent<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp\">http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
