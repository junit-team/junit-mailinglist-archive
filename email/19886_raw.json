In part=\r\nicular,\n&gt; the idea to &quot;do the simplest thing that can possibly work&quot; can be=\r\n\n&gt; dangerous, because sometimes, you just know where your code is going\n&gt; a=\r\nnd it&#39;s safe to start doing things that might not necessarily be the\n&gt; simp=\r\nlest thing at the moment but that will save you time in the near\n&gt; future.\n=\r\n&gt; \n\nagree=A3=ACI often do this. Yesterday I do this because I am clear what=\r\n\ngoing to do .so I write three test.\n    @Test public void testNormalMapRes=\r\nult(){}\n    @Test public void testThrowException(){}\n    @Test public void =\r\ntestVoidReturn(){}\nthen write product code(I&#39;m clear before write those tes=\r\nt) quickly\nthat in my mind.then run the test.Once any test failed I will st=\r\nop and\nback restart single test.\n\nBut I think Jeff is right,Jeff Langr wrot=\r\ne:\n&gt; the unnecessary logic introduces unnecessary risk\n&gt; (which is particul=\r\narly higher given the absence of more\n&gt; comprehensive tests)\n\nMaybe sometim=\r\nes we should make a balance on each edge.\n\nRegards.\nYang Gu\n\n\n\n\n",
