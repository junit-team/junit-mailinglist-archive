My \n&gt; concern is that I can&#39;t figure out a good way to write these tests \n&gt; without relying on other DAO methods.\n&gt; \n&gt; For example, my employeeDAO might have a createEmployee(Employee \n&gt; employee) method and a getEmployeeById(Integer id) method.  Almost \n&gt; all of my tests rely on a employee record being pre-populated.  For \n&gt; now, I&#39;m calling my createEmployee DAO method in setup() so every \n&gt; test has it.  Then I call the deleteEmployee(Employee employee) \n&gt; method in tearDown().  It bothers me somewhat to have to do this as \n&gt; I would prefer to only call those methods within their \ncorresponding \n&gt; test methods.  \n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve looked at DBUnit.  The problem here is that I still have to \n&gt; populate my bean from the database - then I&#39;m back to calling a DAO \n&gt; method like getEmployeeById in every method - an undesirable \n&gt; dependency.  Another option I guess would be to have some DAO \n&gt; methods used only for testing but this seems overkill.  I&#39;d rather \n&gt; use the database during testing too, not mock objects.\n&gt; \n&gt; So, I guess my questions are:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1.)Is there a good way to test DAOs in isolation, without relying \non \n&gt; other DAO methods?\n&gt; 2.)Does it really matter that much anyway if I use other DAO \n&gt; methods?  I mean, the goal is for ALL tests to pass anyway.  It can \n&gt; be confusing if your testDeleteEmployee method fails due to a \n&gt; failure in createEmployee which you have to call first, but I guess \n&gt; it wouldn&#39;t take long to figure out what really happened.\n&gt; \n&gt; Any feedback would be appreciated.\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Mike\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
