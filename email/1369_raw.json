My management is\nalso very unhappy about the concept of using freeware to to do stuff that&#39;s\nmission critical.  They want to see proof that tools work, that they&#39;re\nreliable and supported.   The use of Open Source/freeware for commercial\npurposes represents a shift in mindset because it doesn&#39;t the pattern of\nnormal procurement processes:  &quot;Okay so we&#39;ve got the source code, we can\nfix bugs ourselves if anything goes wrong: doesn&#39;t that mean we&#39;ve just\nlumbered ourselves with a whole bunch *of someone else&#39;s code* to maintain?&quot;\n\n\nYou might think businesses would say &quot;Hey, it&#39;s free!  We&#39;ve saved a bundle\nof cash!&quot; but what they actually say is &quot;If it&#39;s any good why are they\ngiving it away?&quot;.  \n\nThis is why Apache isn&#39;t on 100% of web servers.\n\nAPC\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Blum, Robert [mailto:rblum@...]\nSent: 01 June 2001 16:45\nTo: &#39;junit@yahoogroups.com&#39;\nSubject: RE: [junit] Research on the success of JUnit on projects\n\n\nYes, JUnit was a success for us. No drawbacks - except the fact that the\nfriggin machine finds your mistakes :-)\n\nBut let me ask you a question - do you really seriously have to justify\n_writing test cases_ ?\n\nIf not, what&#39;s keeping you from using it? \n\nBye,\n  Robert\n\n \n\n\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: wegfn06@... [mailto:wegfn06@...]\n&gt; Sent: Friday, June 01, 2001 8:22 AM\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: [junit] Research on the success of JUnit on projects\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Hi All,\n&gt; \n&gt; I am compiling a small piece of research about JUnit.  I want my \n&gt; company to start using it, but in order to sell the idea I would like \n&gt; to be able to call on success/failure stories of the use of JUnit on \n&gt; projects.  If you have the time, I would appreciate any stories of \n&gt; how JUnit was used successfully on your project, where there any \n&gt; disadvantages of using JUnit, do you think it improved your \n&gt; productivity etc?  I would like to quote companies, but I appreciate \n&gt; that you may think this is sensitive material, so I think the best I \n&gt; can hope for is to see if the majority of responses liked using JUnit \n&gt; or not.  Either way, thank you in advance for your help.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards\n&gt; \n&gt; Mik Q\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
