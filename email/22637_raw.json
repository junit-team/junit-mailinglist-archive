MethodRule allows you to do things=\r\n based on the specific test name, and intercept and even replace the runnin=\r\ng of a test. Consider ExpectedException. You really could not do anything l=\r\nike that in a @Before or @After method. You would have to do it inside your=\r\n test and use an execute around pattern to handle the exception.\n\nFor your =\r\nuse case it is a drop more boilerplate than a rule, but all you would do is=\r\n define a @Before method in a common superclass or in your @Before call a c=\r\nlass that encapsulates the functionality. Yes you have to wrap the call in =\r\na method rather than defining a field, but Java is kind of verbose already.=\r\n\n\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, Max Bowsher &lt;maxb@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; On 22/04=\r\n/10 15:00, yme0987654321 wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Max,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If that is your use case,=\r\n what isn&#39;t accomplished with the @BeforeClass method? \n&gt; \n&gt; There&#39;s nothin=\r\ng you can do with a method @Rule that you can&#39;t do with a\n&gt; @Before and @Af=\r\nter, but rules allow packaging and re-use of\n&gt; setup/teardown behaviour.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; I want the same advantages at a class level situation.\n&gt; \n&gt; Max.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, Max Bowsher &lt;maxb@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; On 22/04=\r\n/10 00:49, Kent Beck wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; I&#39;m not satisfied with the assymmetry bet=\r\nween Rule and ClassRule. It should be MethodRule, but that would require al=\r\nl the rules out there to change.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Could you clarify what you mean =\r\nby that? In the git branch, Rule is an \n&gt; &gt;&gt; annotation and ClassRule an in=\r\nterface so I don&#39;t understand what you \n&gt; &gt;&gt; mean by asymmetry.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; W=\r\nhat should be MethodRule?\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Changing existing rules is inevitable, =\r\nsince MethodRule#apply operates \n&gt; &gt;&gt; in the context of a FrameworkMethod a=\r\nnd an instantiated target object, \n&gt; &gt;&gt; neither of which are available at c=\r\nlass scope.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Also, I&#39;m not happy about encouraging more extra-tes=\r\nt state as this reduces the chances that tests are independent.
