For instance, the following assert fails:\n\n   assertEquals(Double.NaN, Double.NaN, 0.1);\n\ni.e. NaN is not equal to NaN. I&#39;m honestly not sure whether this is \ncorrect or not. What does the principle of least surprise suggest? If \nsomeone understands NaN they may find this correct but someone who&#39;s not \nintimately familiar with NaN may be surprised.\n\nThis edge case does have practical consequences. For one, the Apache \nCommons Math project has found it necessary to create their own double \nassertEquals methods that do consider NaN to be equal to NaN. See\n\nhttp://svn.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/jakarta/commons/proper/math/trunk/src/test/org/apache/commons/math/TestUtils.java?rev=240245&view=markup\n\nI could go either way on this. However, I do think it&#39;s important that a \ndefinite decision about how to handle NaN be made, and that the result \nof this decision be spelled out in the JavaDoc. Currently Infinity is \naddressed but not NaN, and NaN is by far the more confusing case.\n\nIt probably also wouldn&#39;t hurt to patch the JUnit 3 JavaDoc at least \nenough to document the current behavior, whatever that is.\n\n-- \n﻿Elliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nXML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim\n\n",
