You had to al=\r\nready see that this is not short time to accept a new design.\n\nWhen I submi=\r\nt something, then only Kent and David are announced. I would expect that mu=\r\nch more developers are announced as well, or even the entire group. This ma=\r\ny speed up.\n\nWhat are you suggesting to speed up the acceptance?\n\n\n",
