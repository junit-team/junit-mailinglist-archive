Actually I like it. You can never lose track of the <br/>\n    &gt; tests, and you can<br/>\n    &gt; run them in (pre-)production if you want, just to ensure <br/>\n    &gt; that production env<br/>\n    &gt; (soft&hardware) behaves like dev.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This can be accomplished without having the tests side-by-side with your<br/>\nproduction code.  Just include them in the release.<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">     &gt; Because we have a naming convention where every test <br/>\n    &gt; class name begins with<br/>\n    &gt; &quot;Test&quot;, it&#39;s also pretty easy to manipulate them when exporting.<br/>\n    &gt; Why hide the tests? I&#39;m proud of them! :) And I want them <br/>\n    &gt; to be seen right<br/>\n    &gt; aside the class they test, so it gives a visual clue that <br/>\n    &gt; they need to<br/>\n    &gt; follow the evolution of the class. Anyway.... :)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>A moot point from my perspective, but your mileage probably varies.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Jason</div>",
