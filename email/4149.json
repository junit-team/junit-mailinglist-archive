Everyone I&#39;ve shown it to has wanted their own copy&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The book has several chapters on JUnit not to mention JUnit, HTTPUnit,<br/>\n&gt;Cactus, Ant and more.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;For the complete review from Frank Carver go to:<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.javaranch.com/cgi-bin/ubb/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_top\">http://www.javaranch.com/cgi-bin/ubb/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_top</a><br/>\n&gt;ic&f=49&t=000<br/>\n&gt;191<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;If you have any comments on the book, there is a forum on JavaRanch at:<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.javaranch.com/cgi-bin/ubb/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_top\">http://www.javaranch.com/cgi-bin/ubb/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_top</a><br/>\n&gt;ic&f=49&t=000<br/>\n&gt;191<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Please share you experiences with the book or share you <br/>\n&gt;experiences with<br/>\n&gt;using the tools (JUnit, Ant, et al) to do automated testing <br/>\n&gt;and continuous<br/>\n&gt;integration.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;A small comment about the review...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I agree with Frank that the book is for more than just <br/>\n&gt;developers that are<br/>\n&gt;doing XP (XPers). I state this several times in the book. <br/>\n&gt;However, I&#39;d like<br/>\n&gt;to add...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;If you are following the XP development process and you are doing J2EE<br/>\n&gt;development, then you especially need the tools described in <br/>\n&gt;this book. This<br/>\n&gt;is because XP relies heavily on automated testing, and continuous<br/>\n&gt;integration. JUnit, which is heavily covered in this book, was <br/>\n&gt;designed and<br/>\n&gt;co-created by the father of the XP process--Kent Beck.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Here is what one J2EE XP developer wrote about the book...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&quot;I have been struggling with turning XP methodology into a <br/>\n&gt;solid development<br/>\n&gt;process. We&#39;ve had some success at my company but most times we&#39;ve met<br/>\n&gt;frustrations primarily because we were trying to teach old tools new<br/>\n&gt;tricks.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&quot;Java Tools for XP has made a big difference for us. My team <br/>\n&gt;has been able<br/>\n&gt;to use the tools described in this book to actually DO unit <br/>\n&gt;testing, and<br/>\n&gt;we&#39;ve already automated a significant portion of our testing <br/>\n&gt;and deployment<br/>\n&gt;processes. Its also let us make a good case for open source tools at my<br/>\n&gt;company.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&quot;Overall I definitely recommend this book as the first book to make XP<br/>\n&gt;real.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I receive a lot of email that states similar things. If you <br/>\n&gt;are doing XP and<br/>\n&gt;Java (especially J2EE), then the tools described in this book <br/>\n&gt;are essential.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Thanks again.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Rick Hightower<br/>\n&gt;Director of Development<br/>\n&gt;eBlox, Inc.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;eBlox Tucson<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;*******************************************<br/>\n&gt;* Check out my new book!:                 *<br/>\n&gt;* Java Tools for Extreme Programming:     *<br/>\n&gt;* Mastering Open Source Tools,            *<br/>\n&gt;* including Ant, JUnit, and Cactus        *<br/>\n&gt;*******************************************<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.rickhightower.com/JavaXPToolkit/\">http://www.rickhightower.com/JavaXPToolkit/</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Buy it at Amazon:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/047120708X/rickhightower-20\">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/047120708X/rickhightower-20</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The book was written by members of the eBlox team!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------ Yahoo!
