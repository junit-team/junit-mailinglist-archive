Ok so I wrote a simple test that shows a =\r\nJFrame and uses Java Robot to click on it. Works fine run in Eclipse on Mac=\r\n as an application or JUnit test but fails when run as JUnit plugin test. F=\r\nrame would show 1 out of 5 or so times. Removing all unneeded plugins resul=\r\nted in frame always being shown but the click never seems to happen.\n\nI als=\r\no tried Window Licker and the included Calculator test(s) - same thing...  =\r\nruns as a JUnit Test but fails as a JUnit Plugin Test. One time the frame w=\r\nas shown, but nothing happened (so the test failed). The other times, the f=\r\nrame didn&#39;t even show. Tried removing all VM args and unnecessary plugins.\n=\r\n\nIs this related to the args that Eclipse uses to run plugin tests on Mac? =\r\nOr the core plugins included to run the tests? Or...?\n\nShaun.\n\n--- In junit=\r\n@yahoogroups.com, Dale Emery &lt;dale@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi whoever you are,\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Hi - thanks for your reply. I&#39;m actually using Alex Ruiz&#39;s FEST for our =\r\ntesting and it works quite well on Windows. With or without FEST on the Mac=\r\n, I can&#39;t seem to get any UI tests to run. The initial frame/window comes u=\r\np in some cases but I can&#39;t do much more than that. When running JUnit test=\r\ns (again with or without FEST), I don&#39;t even see the frame.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve g=\r\none through what docs there are for FEST and have read the blog/article but=\r\n I can&#39;t figure it out.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve used FEST to test Swing code on a toy =\r\nproject:\n&gt; https://github.com/dhemery/towers.dead\n&gt; \n&gt; Later I restarted th=\r\ne project and used WindowLicker instead:\n&gt; https://github.com/dhemery/Tower=\r\ns\n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s been a while since I visited either project, but I think the (f=\r\new) UI tests run. Neither version of the code does much, so there aren&#39;t ma=\r\nny UI tests. The older one (which uses FEST) has more features and tests.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; I wrote all of this code on Macs running Snow Leopard and Eclipse Ganym=\r\nede. I haven&#39;t tried it on Lion or Helios.\n&gt; \n&gt; Dale\n&gt; \n&gt; --\n&gt; Dale Emery\n&gt;=\r\n Consultant to software teams and leaders\n&gt; http://dhemery.com\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n\n\n\n",
