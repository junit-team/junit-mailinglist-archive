It&#39;s fairly easy to fix (by re-implementing\nTestSetup and extending it from TestSuite), but it&#39;s annoying.\n\nOther tools, like Ant&#39;s JUnit task, could also benefit from this.\n\nI have an implementation I&#39;m willing to submit, but I would like to know how\nmany people would be interested in it.
