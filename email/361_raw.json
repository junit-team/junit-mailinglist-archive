Our solution required \nJDK 1.2, even though (for now) most of our developers are stuck on \nJDK 1.1 (we&#39;re hoping to move from MS J++ soon). \n\nObviously this is not good -- having our developers run against a \ndifferent JDK version than our tests. \n\nI&#39;m trying to clean things up, so I&#39;m ripping out our custom hacks \nand upgrading to JUnit 3.5. I notice the new classpath scanning code \n(in ClassPathTestCollector et al), but also notice that the comments \nstate that JAR scanning is not implemented. \n\nI tried Duncan McGregor&#39;s ZipAwareLoadingTestRunner and haven&#39;t had \nany luck -- various class loading and null pointer problems (not in \nhis code). \n\nSo my question is: Has anyone managed to get JUnit to scan the \nclasspath and execute tests in all jar files using JDK 1.1? \n\nthanks in advance, \nSimon \n\n\n",
