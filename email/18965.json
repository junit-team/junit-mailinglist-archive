Another<br/>\n&gt; example.. a while ago<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;I was talking to Ivan Moore (of Jester fame) and<br/>\n&gt; he was saying that he<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;had an idea for a tool that would go through your<br/>\n&gt; Java code and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&#39;privitize&#39; it; that is, make all methods private<br/>\n&gt; that could be<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;private.  In the spirit of the thing he was<br/>\n&gt; thinking of calling it<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Thatcher :-)  We were talking about it with a few<br/>\n&gt; other people who, like<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;me, are very annoyed by the fact that private gets<br/>\n&gt; in the way when its<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;in someone else&#39;s mangled code and you don&#39;t have<br/>\n&gt; the opportunity to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;peel it off, and we thought, well, wouldn&#39;t it be<br/>\n&gt; nice if your<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;environment just told you which methods weren&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; used elsewhere in the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;system?  Sort of, &quot;this one could be private if<br/>\n&gt; you wanted it to be.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;    <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Michael,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Very interesting.  Are you suggesting this tool<br/>\n&gt; would allow you to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;make more things private, or allow you to leave<br/>\n&gt; fewer things private,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;while still having the documentary benefit from the<br/>\n&gt; IDE of an &quot;only<br/>\n&gt; &gt;used locally&quot; marker?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  <br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; You could use it either way and as long as a<br/>\n&gt; language has private, <br/>\n&gt; people would probably move to one or the other<br/>\n&gt; style.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I think that the core issue behind all of this is<br/>\n&gt; what we choose to <br/>\n&gt; think of as the program.  For languages like Java<br/>\n&gt; which are file-based, <br/>\n&gt; that have representation outside the IDE, I suppose<br/>\n&gt; there will always be <br/>\n&gt; people who want to see those semantics in the<br/>\n&gt; source.  The thing that is <br/>\n&gt; interesting to consider, though, is that if our IDEs<br/>\n&gt; can infer this <br/>\n&gt; information, is there much merit in the idea of<br/>\n&gt; having the programmer <br/>\n&gt; specify it?  Could it be enough to say, well, you<br/>\n&gt; can access whatever <br/>\n&gt; you want, but the uses will be immediately apparent<br/>\n&gt; when people look at <br/>\n&gt; the code.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Typing &#39;private&#39; is a like a little ritual.  You are<br/>\n&gt; documenting a <br/>\n&gt; decision.  But, if you have control over the code,<br/>\n&gt; you can &quot;untype&quot; it <br/>\n&gt; whenever you want to.  This is pretty much the same<br/>\n&gt; as having the IDE <br/>\n&gt; infer it for you.  The only way that private has<br/>\n&gt; teeth is when you don&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; have control over the code that uses it.  And, as a<br/>\n&gt; guy who runs into <br/>\n&gt; testing dilemmas all the time, I have to say that<br/>\n&gt; those teeth feel very <br/>\n&gt; sharp.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; One way out of this might be to let IDEs manage<br/>\n&gt; private the way that <br/>\n&gt; Eclipse manages imports.  I haven&#39;t thought that<br/>\n&gt; through yet.. might be <br/>\n&gt; neat though.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Michael Feathers<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.objectmentor.com\">http://www.objectmentor.com</a><br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://michaelfeathers.typepad.com\">http://michaelfeathers.typepad.com</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n </span></blockquote>____________________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nNow that&#39;s room service!
