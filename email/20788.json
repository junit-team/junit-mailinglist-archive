But here is some advice<br/>\nwhich will hopefully help you in resolving it:<br/>\n1. Try writing some test cases for the other methods you have written. If<br/>\nthese test cases also result in the stack overflow, then they will hopefully<br/>\nnarrow down what circumstances the problem occurs under.<br/>\n2. Look for places in your code where something is being added to a<br/>\ncollection. These are places where not implementing a hashCode or equals<br/>\nmethod; or the order of inserts might be important. Write test cases to<br/>\nvalidate that these are working as you expect.<br/>\n3. Refactor the very long methods into smaller methods while adding tests<br/>\nfor them. It is hard to understand and debug methods that have deeply nested<br/>\nif/else conditions.<br/>\n4. You can try adding System.out.println&#39;s to your code as Stefan suggests.<br/>\nI would do this as a last resort. The failing test case is trying to tell<br/>\nyou something about the code and the process used to write it.<br/>\n5. When you find the fix, report back and let others know about the<br/>\nexperience. It&#39;s always good to share :-)<br/>\nGood luck!<br/>\n-Dennis<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Thu, Aug 7, 2008 at 8:07 AM, Stefan Schulze &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:algroth@...\">algroth@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;   Hi Fuguo,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I didn&#39;t meant that you have the same problem.
