The\nJUnit site maintains a lot of useful informa=\r\ntion and links to other\nresources. Many of the articles there are directed =\r\ntowards the\nbeginner and will help you greatly as you learn about JUnit. Go=\r\nogle is\nuseful when there&#39;s something you need, but don&#39;t know what it is.\n=\r\nJust type a description in, press enter and see how much help it can\nbe. I&#39;=\r\nve found quite a few useful things that way. Another tip with\nGoogle is to =\r\nsearch on the specific error message that you have, often\nyou&#39;ll find forum=\r\n discussions about that exact error, with a good\nchance of a solution being=\r\n given as well.\n\nAs you learn and start having questions, you will also fin=\r\nd the JUnit\nFAQ very helpful. The questions that it answers really are the\n=\r\nfrequent ones that most of us had asked or wondered about and Mike\nClark do=\r\nes a wonderful job of collating it. Here is a link:\n\nhttp://junit.sourcefor=\r\nge.net/doc/faq/faq.htm\n\nWhen you are ready to start asking more questions o=\r\nn the JUnit mailing\nlist, please consider following all of the advice in Er=\r\nic Raymond&#39;s\nvery helpful document: &quot;How to ask questions the smart way&quot;, a=\r\nvailable\nat his website. Here is a link:\n\nhttp://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/sma=\r\nrt-questions.html\n\nAs far as books are concerned, I recommend Pragmatic Uni=\r\nt Testing by\nHunt and Thomas for beginners. JUnit recipes by Rainsberger is=\r\n good\nonce you&#39;re past the basics. There are other good books out there, bu=\r\nt\nthese are my recommendations.\n\nI hope that this helps.\n\nSimon\n\n\nOn 2/20/0=\r\n6, praveshpappu &lt;praveshpappu@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; i want to know that can=\r\n i learn junit while i have no knowledge\n&gt; about junit but i know basic jav=\r\na programming and c programming.\n&gt; if yes then please give me an idea about=\r\n junit that how to install, how\n&gt; to learn and please also tell me how can =\r\ni built my carrier by using\n&gt; junit.\n\n\n--\nwww.simonpeter.org\n\n",
