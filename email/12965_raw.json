If not, how can we avoid it? Is there a way to enforce the sequence of test method runs?\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nThe bottom line is this: the tests should break if something is wrong. \nIf the test for deleting a record doesn&#39;t even get off the ground \nbecause there&#39;s a problem inside the add record method, then it still \nbreaks, right? And vice-versa. Granted, with these dependencies, you&#39;ve \ngot potential for some situations that may be hard to figure out, or \ncases where one single problem causes many tests unnecessarily to break, \nbut the red flags will still be thrown as soon as a bug creeps in, and \nthat&#39;s the more important value.\n\nThe only real problems you have to look out for are cases where somehow \nthe code is broken, but the tests still pass.\n\nThe other piece of advice to come to mind is to have different methods \nfor adding and deleting that only the tests use -- don&#39;t re-use the \nproduction methods in your setUp()/tearDown(). I&#39;d heard once the MS \nExcel team has two calculation engines to solve similar dilemmas. The \nproduction one is complex and optimized, the testing one is simpler and \nslow -- a lot of duplicated effort, but the only real way to verify the \nresults of complex scenarios.\n\n-- \nChris\nhttp://clabs.org/blogki\n\n\n",
