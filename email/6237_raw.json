As such, I&#39;m presented with a fairly unique opportunity to\nestablish some standard practices for unit testing.\n\nA few things are obvious. Yes, writing unit tests for all new code\nshould be STRONGLY ENCOURAGED. Yes, the JUnit framework is what we will\nuse for launching our tests. \n\nSome are less obvious, but I&#39;m still clear on what to do. For instance,\nwriting tests that include the database are often QUITE difficult. Not\neveryone has a copy of Oracle; we can&#39;t just erase tables willy-nilly to\nset up for each test; etc. So I will use mock objects (hopefully\nstarting from those at www.mockobjects.com) to simulate the connection,\nand other &quot;external&quot; data sources/sinks.\n\nAnd there are a few questions on which I&#39;d like to hear input from some\nwith more experience so I can start out using &quot;Best Practices&quot; instead\nof having to learn from my OWN experience.\n\nQUESTION 1:\n   Where do my JUnit unit tests go?\n   \n   I see 3 likely answers... (a) make each an inner class of the\n   class being tested, (b) for every class &quot;Foo&quot; have a class called \n   &quot;TestFoo&quot; in the same package, or (c) have a separate (but parallel\n   hierarchy of classes... SOURCE/com/pkg/Foo.java is tested by \n   TEST/com/pkg/TestFoo.java.\n\n   I lean towards (c) because it makes it easy to build the &quot;real&quot; code\n   and the &quot;test&quot; code separately, and omit the &quot;test&quot; code from\n   production deployment. Are there other significant issues here?\n\n\nQUESTION 2:\n   How do I automatically build the suite of all tests?\n\n   For each class, I can have several methods called &quot;testXxx()&quot; and\n   can collect them into a suite to run at once. I can collect the\n   suites together into larger suites, eventually coalescing into a\n   suite called &quot;RunAllTests&quot; which does just that. But this requires\n   me to write each of these suites, and to remember to include each\n   and every test class. I&#39;d rather if &quot;RunAllTests&quot; just magically\n   found all of the tests... that way I couldn&#39;t forget to include\n   one and wind up with some tests that never get run just because I\n   forgot a line in a suite. How do I create this &quot;magical&quot; \n   RunAllTests?\n\n   Stray thought... if there&#39;s no simple solution in straight java,\n   I wonder if ant can help me to achieve RunAllTests as an ant\n   target?\n\n\nQUESTION 3:\n   How do I &quot;turn on&quot; my mock objects when tests are running?\n\n   The most straightforward use of mock objects is to pass them\n   directly to the code being tested. However, (despite the fact that\n   this is a bit broader than simply &quot;unit&quot; testing), I plan to have\n   a lot of tests that exercise an entire sub-system at once. For\n   example, I might create the input file, run the command, and then\n   test the output file. But if this &quot;command&quot; opens a connection to\n   a database (or other system), then I&#39;d like to return a mock\n   ResultSet instead of a real one. So the code that obtains a DB\n   connection has to look at some global setting to see if we&#39;re in\n   &quot;test mode&quot; or &quot;real life&quot;. What is a good way to achieve this --\n   is it something I&#39;ll have to write for myself?\n\n\nI&#39;m sure I&#39;ll have more questions also, but this email is QUITE long\nenough as is. Thanks in advance for any feedback, suggestions, or\npointers to other forums/FAQs for this kind of stuff.\n\n-- Michael Chermside\n\n\n\n\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\njunit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n \n\nYour use of Yahoo!
