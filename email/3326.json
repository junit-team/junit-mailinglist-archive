    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1428539946\">Well, after I had created several package test suites, I realized that I <br/>\ncould refactor them into one single class, which works on different <br/>\npackage depending on some run time parameters passed through command line.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe tricky part is how to pass parameters, because JUnit doesn&#39;t allow <br/>\nyou to do too much on that.  There are two ways I have been tried:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Create my own main method.  In the main method, take the parameter <br/>\nfrom command line and set the state of the test suite, then pass the <br/>\ntest suite to the JUnit test runners.  When the runners call the test <br/>\nsuite to construct the tests, it will construct different tests <br/>\naccording to the state.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Set the envrionment variable through the -D switch of java executable <br/>\nand check those variable using System.getProperty in the suite mehtod of <br/>\nthe test suite.<br/>\n<br/>\nShane<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nDisclaimer:  I join all the news groups out of my own interest.

These TestAll <br/>\n&gt;classes can compose all test in subpackages.<br/>\n&gt;But I am confused about naming convention for these classes. For root <br/>\n&gt;Test class it&#39;s simple, name can be AllTest or TestAll, but what <br/>\n&gt;names can I assign to other? I looked for some convention, but there <br/>\n&gt;are only convention for packages or method naming, not for this <br/>\n&gt;problem. Have somebody some experience with this?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Example package structure (each level with few Test classes):<br/>\n&gt;A<br/>\n&gt;A.a<br/>\n&gt;A.a.1.xxx<br/>\n&gt;A.a.2.yyy<br/>\n&gt;A.b<br/>\n&gt;A.b.1.xxx<br/>\n&gt;A.b.2.xxx<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;If I name all test classes composing some other test as &quot;TestAll&quot;, <br/>\n&gt;there can be confusion later (many classes with name &quot;TestAll&quot;), if I <br/>\n&gt;name it &quot;TestAllXXX&quot;, where XXX is name of last level of package, <br/>\n&gt;there can be still packages with same name of the last level. <br/>\n&gt;Assigning name as TestAll_A_a_1 (thus full name of package in name of <br/>\n&gt;class) is for me too long. Some advice?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Thanx<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Zdenek Smid<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Your use of Yahoo!
