At first, I had multiple versions<br/>\nof the same fixture lying around my TestCases. As I found myself<br/>\nwriting more identical fixtures, I began to think about finding a<br/>\ncentral place for these (in order to keep my code DRY and avoid a<br/>\nmaintenance nightmare further down the road). <br/>\n<br/>\nUsing inheritance and placing the common fixtures in a super class<br/>\nseemed to be the right way to go. In fact, it worked quite well as<br/>\nlong as my classes only implemented one interface. However, as soon as<br/>\nI stumbled upon a class implementing two of these interfaces, I was<br/>\nfaced with a choice of which super TestCase to extend<br/>\n<br/>\nI realize that maybe this isn&#39;t the right way to go but I&#39;d like to be<br/>\nsure before I throw it all away and try another path<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll post the results of my &quot;quest&quot; if I ever find an interesting<br/>\nsolution.<br/>\n<br/>\nYours,<br/>\n<br/>\nDimitri<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, David Saff &lt;saff@m...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; D,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s an interesting problem.  Have you tried going at it<br/>\nincrementally?  <br/>\n&gt; Go ahead and write the unit tests for two or three of your classes, <br/>\n&gt; cutting and pasting if necessary.  Then go back and see what you<br/>\nhave to <br/>\n&gt; do to remove the duplication.  I often find this to be an effective way <br/>\n&gt; to make an abstract question concrete.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If, in the midst of doing this exercise, you find yourself with a<br/>\nsmall, <br/>\n&gt; focused example of a place where you would be tempted to use multiple <br/>\n&gt; inheritance, please post it.  I&#39;m willing to bet, with even odds, that <br/>\n&gt; you&#39;ll quickly find other ways of gracefully doing what you need.

Most of my &quot;concrete&quot; classes implement more<br/>\n&gt; &gt; than one of these interfaces.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Now, I was hoping to find a way to refactor my tests so that each<br/>\n&gt; &gt; interface has its own abstract TestCase. Then, if multiple inheritance<br/>\n&gt; &gt; was allowed in Java, I could simply implement each classes concrete<br/>\n&gt; &gt; classe&#39;s TestCase by inheriting from all the appropriate &quot;interface<br/>\n&gt; &gt; TestCases&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; This would allow me to inherit all the general purpose fixtures and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; simply add some new fixtures targeted for the concrete classe&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; specific behavior. In a way, I simply want to enforce the &quot;Liskov<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Substitution Principle&quot; as simply as possible...<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I know multiple inheritance isn&#39;t allowed in Java and should be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; avoided anyway but I&#39;d like to find a simple way to keep the general<br/>\n&gt; &gt; idea of &quot;interface specific super TestCases&quot; and apply it to classes<br/>\n&gt; &gt; implementing several of these interfaces.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Is the general idea a good one ? If it is, what is  the best way to <br/>\n&gt; &gt; achieve it ?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Thanks in advance,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; D.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; YAHOO!
