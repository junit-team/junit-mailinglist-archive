Extension points are not without\n&gt; cost. There&#39;s is or should be a significant hurdle to be jumped before\n&gt; adding a new published method. Even if the method is inherently useful\n&gt; and has no corresponding problems, it still needs to be useful enough.\n&gt; It&#39;s not enough that one or a few people might use a method. It needs to\n&gt; be pretty clear that large percentage of a library&#39;s users are going to\n&gt; take advantage of the feature, or that it be extremely important to a\n&gt; smaller but still sizeable percentage.\n&gt;\nElliotte,\n\nI had promised not to post on this topic again, but I&#39;m still genuinely \ncurious: is there not room, in your opinion, for a third option between \n&quot;totally public: published and documented for all the world to use in \nsafety&quot;, and &quot;totally private: utterly hidden, technically enforced to \nbe available only to the code publisher&quot;?  I&#39;ve found a use for this \nmiddle way.  As a framework user, I&#39;ve been grateful it was there.  As a \ndeveloper, I&#39;ve sometimes opted for the &quot;totally public&quot; when the \n&quot;totally private&quot; was obviously wrong, but found I&#39;ve wasted time on \ndocumentation and finalizing design for a feature that only a few people \nuse, and used wonderfully.\n\n    David Saff\n\n",
