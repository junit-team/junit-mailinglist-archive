Up to \nnow I am\nnot sure what to expect of it. With my little experience I only see the \nproblem of provoking\nall possible error cases, e.g.:\n\nclient.login(user, pass)     // illegal arguments, authentication error, \ntimeout ..?\n\nBut as I said, I do not know, which help EasyMock offers me in these cases.\n\n&gt;&gt; Taking my Importer/Exporter example a second time, it is more \n&gt;&gt; a cron script than an application: Doing a defined job in a \n&gt;&gt; robust and understandable manner but neither designed as a \n&gt;&gt; basis for wide enhancements nor for ultimate flexibility. \n&gt;&gt; So there are methods which start the whole work of an \n&gt;&gt; importer over the whole lifecycle (connect, fetch data, map \n&gt;&gt; data etc). Methods, which are necessary for getting the \n&gt;&gt; object in a usable state (e.g.\n&gt;&gt; connection established) are hidden away. To ensure that there \n&gt;&gt; must be the correct state before executing the main task I \n&gt;&gt; can lead the user with parameterized constructors (e.g. \n&gt;&gt; MyImporter(host, port)).\n&gt;&gt;     \n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Whole&quot; sounds like a megajob, thats not a good practice in\n&gt; unit testing. Maybe the lifecycle is a separate object that\n&gt; controls different tasks; the connections and fetchers are\n&gt; serviceobjects that do something with your data objects.\n&gt;   \nIt sounds more than it is in my case. Such kinds of importers often are \nonly some glue between\ndata formats (xml/ db), connection handling (getting the data from a to \nb) and much reboust\nexception handling and logging.\nSometimes - when I really think about which class should do what in \ncontrast to others - I tend to\ncode over-ambitioned. This leads to many classes which really do their \njob: connection handlers,\nvalue or transfer objects, data mappers, controllers whatever. And there \nlies a certain beauty, every\nclass does only what it is ment for and even better: it only knows what \ni really needs. But for a simple\ntask like &quot;get data from a, parse data into structure, put it into place \nb&quot; this produces lots of classes\nwith perhaps two methods, and some more only for building an abstraction \nlayer - which can be useless\nif it is not part of another bigger architecture.\nThe endprduct can be a less beautyful code, but in best KISS manner.\n\n&gt; All objects/units are easilier to test if they have one\n&gt; objectiv, that you can test separatly.\n&gt;\n&gt;   \nThats the point. I see a difference between a good practice in Unit \nTesting and the intention\nof how the class should be used. My FTP Example (very simplified):\n\n+FtpImporter(host, port, user, pass)\n+ImporterObjects[] import()                   // calls connect()/ \ndisconnect()\n-connect()\n-disconnect()\n(+ some setters getters for the attributes)\n\nIt is clear that this is bad for two reasons:\n- no flexibility in controlling the data-/workflow (especially open, close)\n- therefore a problem in testing\n\nBut there comes the advantage I mentioned as usage intention:\n- it is clear how to use the importer\n- it is very hard to bring the class in an invalid state\n\nOpening the open/close methods and offering the standard constructor for \nlater\ncode (configured) injection would offer a way to handle the class wrong:\n\nnew FtpImporter().import()   // missing connect\n\nIt would also need to put extra state validation into the connect/ \ndisconnect methods\n\nSaid again, it is not the best example, but it shows, how hiding \nimplementaiton details\ncan lead the usage. Sure, some assumptions must be met:\n- the code is _not_ made for flexibility or enhancements. I think for a \none-way-special-\ncase-importer this is a common simplification\n- it is sure that the workflow of the program won&#39;t change in a way I \ncan not handle,\nbecause the components/classes are too closed\n\nBest greetings!\n\n\n\n",
