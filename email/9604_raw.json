There is no &#39;zero&#39; in temperature so it is not\n&gt;&gt; correct to say it is going to be twice as cold tomorrow. And yes, I\n&gt;&gt; know there is &#39;absolute&#39; zero but ask any statistician and he will\n&gt;&gt; tell you that using ratios with our normal temperature scales is\n&gt;&gt; simply wrong.  Using ratios with time works if you are using timed\n&gt;&gt; tests and define &#39;zero&#39; as no time.  Then yes, 5 minutes is twice as\n&gt;&gt; slow as 10 minutes.\n\n5 minutes is twice as *slow* as 10 minutes?  While that might be \ntechnically accurate from a narrow mathematical definition of &quot;twice as \nslow&quot;, I doubt most readers of English would interpret it that way.\n\nIn general when making comparisons, I take &quot;faster&quot; to mean less time \nand &quot;slower&quot; to mean more time.\n\n\n",
