It emulates a dumb framebuffer\nusing virtual memory.  The primary use of this server was intended to be\nserver testing, but other novel uses for it have been found, including\ntesting clients against unusual depths and screen configurations, doing\nbatch processing with Xvfb as a background rendering engine, load\ntesting, as an aid to porting the X server to a new platform, and\nproviding an unobtrusive way to run applications that don&#39;t really need\nan X server but insist on having one anyway.\n\nHope it helps!\n\nRegards, \nReda\n-- \nGCE/E/IT/M/SS !d---(+) s+:+(++:++) a-- C++ ULS++ P+?
