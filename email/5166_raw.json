But JUnit alone isn&#39;t quite enough (which is why there are \nextensions, right?). See http://abbot.sourceforge.net\n\nI tried developing programmatic extensions to java.awt.Robot to use for \ntests, and using JFCUnit.  Both resulted in a real pain writing code, \nand something developers only used if I forced them and QA certainly \ncouldn&#39;t use.\n\nSo I abstracted the layer of user actions to be invoked from a \nhand-editable XML script, which also supports assertions for testing \npurposes.  I still have to push the developers, but now QA is writing \nsome of the tests.\n\nThe result is the abbot testing framework.  Each script encapsulate \nsemantic user actions mixed with testing assertions to verify GUI \nstate.  The scripts can be invoked from a JUnit Test case (one is \nprovided) and the failures/errors will show up as in any other JUnit \ntest.  There&#39;s also a script editor which provides recording capability \n(which is far easier and quicker than painstakingly programming &quot;move \nhere, click here, move here, click here, move here, click here&quot;.  Also, \nsince it&#39;s a script, there is no extra compile step when building and \ndebugging tests.\n\n\nOn Tuesday, June 11, 2002, at 10:38 AM, Luca Sfarzo wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; The main fact stil remains: do you all have successfully used JUnit in \n&gt; order\n&gt; to make GUI testing?\n&gt; If yes at which level have you ever did it (with JUnit)?
