This is very important. Just get\n&gt; something started. If you can&#39;t convince management to do TDD, then\nconvince\n&gt; them to do some form of unit testing, even if it isn&#39;t the developer\n&gt; themselves testing. Later on you can get TDD started at some level.\n\nI should have added that I find it useful to have both TDD and Unit testing\nthat is done by a dedicated unit tester. Not many developers have the proper\nattitude for testing; testing takes a somewhat destructive attitude, while\nwriting code is a creative process. Also, many developers don&#39;t have the\naptitude or expertise for testing. This is not a slam on developers, just a\nrecognition that testing and developing (both of which I have done) are two\ndifferent areas of expertise.\n\nFWIW,\nLauren\n\n=====\nLooking for an experienced Java/C++ Software Engineer?\nSee: http://developerdude.mystarband.net/resume.html\n\n\n\n",
