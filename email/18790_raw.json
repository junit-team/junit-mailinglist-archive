The T1\n&gt; developer is not allowed to refactor the &quot;architecture&quot; to aid testing\n&gt; and so to implement testing is actually very hard work and you end up\n&gt; being the only one who cares. It&#39;s very frustrating.\n&gt;\n&gt; Cheers\n&gt; Shane\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\nShane,\n\nI was in that situation once in the past. We said OK to the  \narchitecture, AND then we started building our part of the system  \ndriven by tests. As problems arose with the architecture, there was  \nusually some really good OO design principle that could be used to  \nexplain the problem with the architecture. Sometimes that got the  \narchitecture changed; other times, we wrote our part of the system in  \nan isolated, but testable manner and then wrote a bridge to connect  \nit to the badly architected piece. This is not ideal, but being able  \nto write your code effectively, and then adapt it to some other  \nlegacy system is often a better engineering decision, IMHO.\n\nBob Evans\n\nhttp://www.junitfactory.com/\nSend Java code, get tests.
