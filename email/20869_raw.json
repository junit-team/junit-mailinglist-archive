The listener does know which test\n&gt; is\n&gt; running, via the Description.\n&gt;  \n&gt; The listener is not notified when calling @Before and @After methods, but\n&gt; this may change because I&#39;ve been wishing to be notified as part of my\n&gt; data\n&gt; gathering efforts.\n&gt;  \n&gt; I&#39;m curious what problem you are solving.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt;  \n&gt; Kent Beck\n&gt; Three Rivers Institute\n&gt; \n&gt;   _____  \n&gt; \n&gt; From: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of\n&gt; idan72\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, September 10, 2008 7:29 AM\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: [junit] name of the test\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Hi,\n&gt; \n&gt; 1.
