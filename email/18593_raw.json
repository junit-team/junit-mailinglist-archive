Instead, talk about =\r\nwhat\n&gt; &gt; &gt; you are doing: automatic test generation. If you take a look at\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Agitar&#39;s marketing material\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (http://www.agitar.com/solutions/bu=\r\nsiness/create_junit_tests.html),\n&gt; &gt; &gt; they&#39;re not talking about TDD either=\r\n--because automatic test\n&gt; &gt; &gt; generation and TDD are simply two unrelated =\r\nthings.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; In fact the German marketing material once mentioned TDD, w=\r\nhich made\n&gt; &gt; them lose a lot of credibility in my eyes...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Which i=\r\ns why they don&#39;t say that any more.  :)\n&gt; \n&gt; But for people who don&#39;t pract=\r\nice TDD this is a difficult distinction:\n&gt;  if you have a failing test befo=\r\nre you write the code, why isn&#39;t that\n&gt; enough to be TDD?\n\nGenerally, if yo=\r\nu do in fact have a failing test before righting the\ncode that test is inte=\r\nnded to exercise, then it is TDD in some sort. \n/Good/ TDD though is a bit =\r\nmore than the just fundamental &#39;test first&#39;\nrule - it involves a rapid cycl=\r\ne of &#39;test first&#39;, then code, then\nrefactor. In other words, as people have=\r\n indicated earlier:  small\nsteps from which the design emerges.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; I *th=\r\nink* what Jimm is talking about doing is generating a test from\n&gt; the comme=\r\nnt before the implementation is written, so you would have a\n&gt; failing test=\r\n before the body of the code was there. Similarly our\n&gt; (Agitar) marketing =\r\npeople had the feeling that if our product  would\n&gt; let you write a failing=\r\n test in advance of the code that was TDD,\n&gt; right?\n\nIt seems to me that wh=\r\nat Jimm is doing is actually writing &quot;the code&quot;,\nthen generating a test, th=\r\nen writing &quot;the code&quot; again. Remember - DRY.\nIn other words, the &#39;comments&#39;=\r\n written to generate the test are\n&quot;CODE&quot;, just not java code. \n\nThink of TD=\r\nD without the words &quot;test&quot; and &quot;code&quot;.  The essence of TDD\nis that you firs=\r\nt write &quot;what should it do?&quot;, then write &quot;how it does\nit&quot;.  Generally, the =\r\n&quot;what should I do&quot; is specified in the &quot;test&quot;; \nthe &quot;how it does it&quot; is spe=\r\ncified in the &quot;code [under test]&quot;.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; The explanation I&#39;ve used is to di=\r\nstinguish between TDD in the small\n&gt; (or test-first) and TDD in the large.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; I might find a bug, write a failing test for the bug, and the fix the\n=\r\n&gt; bug.  That&#39;s would be test-first programming  (or TDD in the small).\n\nYes=\r\n, that is in fact TDD.\n\n&gt; It&#39;s a good thing to do, but the tests aren&#39;t dri=\r\nving my design.\n\nMaybe they do, maybe they don&#39;t.  Probably depends on the =\r\nscope of the\nbug.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Isn&#39;t trying to make this distinction clearer what =\r\ndrove people to\n&gt; change the name from Test First Development  --&gt; TDDevelo=\r\npement --&gt;\n&gt; TDDesign --&gt; BDDesign?  Gotta be a FAQ on this somewhere...\n\nI=\r\n don&#39;t know what drives people to keep renaming the same thing over\nand ove=\r\nr, but I do know it&#39;s aggrevating :-)\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Jtf\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.de=\r\nvelopertesting.com/\n&gt;\n\nCheers...\n--MB\n\n\n\n",
