I do =\r\nit on a regular basis ;-)\n\nA runner that creates a suite from a set of name=\r\ns should be straightforward given you can compute the number of tests befor=\r\nehand, eg. because the class can already be loaded or you know the names of=\r\n test methods per class from some other source.\n\nYou might want to look at =\r\norg.junit.runners.Suite for an example.\n\nJohannes\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups=\r\n.com, Miles Parker &lt;milesparker@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks Johannes,\n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s =\r\npretty straightforward in its own way. I need to execute an arbitrary\n&gt; set=\r\n of test methods (using @test annotations) against a known -- but not yet\n&gt;=\r\n existent at JUnit launch time -- set of classes. Those classes are generat=\r\ned\n&gt; and compiled in a previous test case within same session and then need=\r\n to be\n&gt; loaded dynamically. Ideally, I would present the name of classes a=\r\ns Strings;\n&gt; I understand that JUnit has a way to do this dynamically for m=\r\nethod names\n&gt; but I can&#39;t find a similar feature for class names -- everyth=\r\ning I&#39;ve tried\n&gt; ends up forcing me to have an explicit compiled reference =\r\nat test harness\n&gt; launch time.\n&gt; \n&gt; And of course I&#39;d really like not to ha=\r\nve to write my own runner\n&gt; implementation. ;) In TestNG I can do this with=\r\n factories but our build\n&gt; environment currently only supports JUnit.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nMiles\n\n\n\n",
