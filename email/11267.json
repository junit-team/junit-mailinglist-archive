I agree with you that there <br/>\nare too many terms that mean similar things, but &quot;developer testing&quot; <br/>\nis what most people and companies out there seem to use to describe <br/>\nthe act of software developers getting seriously involved in test <br/>\ndevelopment.  Even in the Agile community, people like Brian Marick <br/>\n(one of the original authors of the Agile Manifesto) use &quot;developer <br/>\ntesting&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nRight or wrong, most people interpret &quot;programmer testing&quot; as the <br/>\ntesting *of* a programmer&#39;s skill (e.g. certification.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is also the issue that some &quot;software engineers&quot; want to be <br/>\nthough of as developers and not programmers.  What&#39;s the difference <br/>\nbetween a programmer and a developer?  I haven&#39;t seen a serious <br/>\ndefinition of the two, but below is a humorous attempt I read <br/>\nsomewhere (origins unknown):<br/>\n<br/>\n* Programmer: A biological machine designed to convert caffeine into <br/>\ncode.<br/>\n<br/>\n* Developer: A person who develops working systems by writing and <br/>\nusing software.<br/>\n<br/>\nUsing this definition, I guess all of us are sometimes programmers <br/>\nand sometimes developers :-).  Although, apparently, you can&#39;t be a <br/>\nprogrammer if you drink decaf.<br/>\n  <br/>\nIn general usage I hear and read &quot;unit testing&quot;, &quot;developer <br/>\ntesting&quot;, and &quot;programmer testing&quot; used quite interchangeably (and <br/>\nin that order of frequency).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;(What&#39;s a &quot;unit&quot; anyway?) <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s another challenge altogether :-), but that&#39;s the primary <br/>\nreason why I thought that &quot;developer testing&quot; was better than &quot;unit <br/>\ntesting.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAlberto<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;J.
