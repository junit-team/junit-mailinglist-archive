Polymorphism could be used nicely for summing up the\n&gt; different points at the end. Just a thought.\n\nHm, the tiles don differ in behaviour or responsibility. In fact\nthe only difference is hidden in the static makeXyzTile methods\nwhich add roads or city parts to the cards.\n\n&gt; If you have different levels of abstraction in one test I would\n&gt; suggest to extract the lower level stuff to a separate method.\n\nI split the test cases in two classes. The first one tests the creation \nof tiles and makes sure a left turning road really turns left and the \nlike.\nThe other class subclasses the tiloe class and tests its protected\nmethods trying to create illegal cards (e.g. road and city part in the \nsame direction).\n\n&gt; I guess you will need this anyway in your application. Just put\n&gt; it into the test class and if necessary refactor it to the tile\n&gt; class.\nI think you are right.\nI made a method returning the number of roads and cities on a tile. \nThis reduced test cases by 7 lines each. Looks better now.\nIn fact this method is likely to be needed for determinating whether a \ntile can be placed in a position. If the number of roads required does \nnot even match the program does not have to turn the card to see it \nfits in no direction.\n\n&gt; &gt; Would you rely on some orientation of created tiles, e.g. assume\n&gt; &gt; the left turning road is always constructed as from east turning to\n&gt; &gt; south (maybe this is like the Blackbox / Whitebox discussion)?\n&gt;\n&gt; What about keeping the orientation in the board? I think the\n&gt; orientation is not so much an attribute of a tile but of the\n&gt; placement of the tile on the board.\nYes. I meant: if a makeXyz method creates a tile with a left turning \nroad and a city part, do you have a look at the source code creating \nthe tile and rely on the knowledge that the city will always be in \nnorth and the road will always be south - west or dou you allow every \ncity locaction as long as the road still turns left below the city?\n\nRobert\n\n",
