But alas, I\n&gt; &gt; believe we are off-topic now.  You are correct in\n&gt; the sense that it\n&gt; &gt; reduces memory usage, but as a habit (personally)\n&gt; I feel it should be\n&gt; &gt; avoided.  If I must optimize, this is surely a\n&gt; good optimization place.\n&gt; &gt; For example:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new\n&gt; FileReader(file));\n&gt; &gt;   String line = null;\n&gt; &gt;   while ( (line = reader.readLine()) != null ) {\n&gt; &gt;     doSomethingWith(line);\n&gt; &gt;   }\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; is _MUCH_ cheaper (in terms of allocation) than:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new\n&gt; FileReader(file));\n&gt; &gt;   while ( reader.ready() ) {\n&gt; &gt;     String line = reader.readLine();\n&gt; &gt;     doSomethingWith(line);\n&gt; &gt;   }\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t see why you think this: in both cases all\n&gt; the interesting allocation\n&gt; happens inside readLine. Where the local variable is\n&gt; declared is going\n&gt; to make essentially no difference. [Internally,\n&gt; &quot;line&quot; is a reference value\n&gt; of fixed size, allocated in the method&#39;s\n&gt; stack-frame; it&#39;s not an object\n&gt; allocated in the heap [1], so going round the loop\n&gt; redeclaring it doesn&#39;t\n&gt; burn store. It would be different if we were in a\n&gt; language with full lexical\n&gt; scoping like Scheme or Pop11, and the variable was\n&gt; captured by a closure,\n&gt; but we aren&#39;t and we cant.]\n&gt; \n&gt; [1] I can imagine an implementation that allocated\n&gt; stack-frames on the\n&gt; heap, as NJSML does, but even that doesn&#39;t allocate\n&gt; individual variables\n&gt; on the heap in cases like this.\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; Chris &quot;electric hedgehog&quot; Dollin\n&gt; C FAQs at:\n&gt;\nhttp://www.faqs.org/faqs/by-newsgroup/comp/comp.lang.c.html\n&gt; C welcome:\n&gt;\nhttp://www.angelfire.com/ms3/bchambless0/welcome_to_clc.html\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
