The original class GetInfo.java has a method. <br/>\n&gt;            String getSystemVersion(String str) which is under test. This method is supplied<br/>\n&gt;            with path variable in form of string from where it reads a xml file to get certain <br/>\n&gt;            data and return back to the user.   <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The point of confussion for me is to how to test the method. What should be the actual <br/>\n&gt; and expected result. Meaning for getting the expected result I will have to use the<br/>\n&gt; same logic as it is in the main code, if I use the same logic to read the xml file <br/>\n&gt; then the assert statement would not be meaningful as then the expected and <br/>\n&gt; actual results would be same.     <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Can you not have a couple of XML files [1] with known answers and check<br/>\nthat reading those files gets you the answers you expect?<br/>\n<br/>\n[1] Which you might construct in a scratch area, although you might<br/>\n    also consider having getSystemVersion also have a variant that<br/>\n    takes a stream content rather than a pathname.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nChris &quot;hantwig efferko VOOM!&quot; Dollin<br/>\nThe &quot;good old days&quot; used to be much better.</div>",
