The current system uses a Maven2 buildsystem.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe current deficiency (not in junit, but tooling) is not from a developer running the unit tests, it&#39;s from a non-code-developer (i.e. a database person who works with (M$) tools like Query Analyzers/Enterprise managers) verifying their database changes did not impact the current junits without needing a code-developer to &#39;babysit&#39; watching the unit tests.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe CI server would be perfect...if the sql code changes were commited to source control at the same time the TEST database instance was updated, but no source control is committed to trigger the unit tests (i.e. database changes not in source control, or in a different source control system...and generally you try not to commit code until local unit tests pass).  I will think about this one more though as a talking point to move in that direction.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nUntil then, the challenge is still the &#39;non-developer&#39; to be able to invoke running the unit tests through a GUI they (a person familiar with M$ GUI screens) can run and understand.  Command-line/console approaches are difficult to get acceptance for external users who are used to their GUI screens :-(<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, Malte Finsterwalder &lt;malte@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I think David Staff&#39;s idea with an integrations server is probably the<br/>\n&gt; best way to go.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Other than that, I don&#39;t see the problem. Why not just run JUnit as a<br/>\n&gt; console application / Ant Build or alike?<br/>\n&gt; If you want, you can wrap it in a batch-file or something to make it<br/>\n&gt; even easier to start.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Why is this situation not to your satisfaction?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Greetings,<br/>\n&gt;    Malte<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
