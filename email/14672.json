We used Coverlipse first. I liked the user interface (you initiate<br/>\ncoverage measurement with a new kind of launch configuration), but the<br/>\nresults weren&#39;t accurate. We set breakpoints on lines that the tool claimed<br/>\nweren&#39;t covered and execution stopped there. We also tried Clover, which has<br/>\na slightly less natural interface (you set an &quot;enable Clover&quot; flag on the<br/>\nproject properties). The results, however, seemed much more accurate. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe result of our testing was that we found two methods out of JUnit 4 that<br/>\nwe felt needed tests. Our overall coverage is 68%, and it seems like it<br/>\nwould be easy to get it up to 80%. However, the only functional code that<br/>\nreally needed more tests were those two methods.<br/>\n<br/>\nSincerely yours,<br/>\n<br/>\nKent Beck<br/>\nThree Rivers Institute<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>] On <br/>\n&gt; Behalf Of Thomas L Roche<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, September 01, 2005 5:28 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: [junit] [OT] coverage plugins for eclipse?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Apologies if this is OT, but IMHO coverage measurement (for guiding<br/>\n&gt; one&#39;s test writing) and IDEs (for writing and running one&#39;s tests) are<br/>\n&gt; both at least tangentially related to JUnit ... and I don&#39;t know of a<br/>\n&gt; good list for coverage measurement :-(<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m wondering, what are folks who use Eclipse (or Eclipse-based<br/>\n&gt; products) using to do coverage measurement and reporting? One option<br/>\n&gt; is to just run the coverage tool from the command line or ant, but I&#39;d<br/>\n&gt; really like something more integrated, e.g.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 0 a run config that would Run&gt;{JUnit, JUnit Plug-in Test} under the<br/>\n&gt;   coverage tool and display results in a view<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 1 mark un/covered sources in Outline view or editors<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The coverage plugins of which I&#39;m aware are<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; * Clover<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; * jcoverage<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; * Rational Developer (Unfortunately its coverage tools are part of its<br/>\n&gt;   performance-testing tools, which complicates installation and use<br/>\n&gt;   for &quot;normal&quot; testing.)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Are there others?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
