The\nfact you need multiple independent assertions indicates your tests are\ntrying to test too much at once. \n \nIt definitely is not designed for testing GUIs in the manner you describe.\nAbbot is good at testing GUIs, and is able to record scripts.  It still\nstops on a filed assertion, though.  There are plenty of scripting tools\nthat do black-box testing.  JUnit is not one of them.\n\n--\nJim McMaster\nmailto:jim.mcmaster@...\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  _____  \n\nFrom: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of\nRaffael Housler\nSent: Monday, August 22, 2005 5:47 PM\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: Re: Re: [junit] Preventing JUnit from stopping on failures.\n\n\nThis is being implemented as a large scale project. Changing the software\n&quot;as it fails&quot; is far from feasible, and more specifically, JUnit is being\nused for black-box testing (ie manipulating GUI elements and comparing them\nto BMP&#39;s etc). \n\nEach &quot;test&quot; is implemented very simularly to a script. Click this GUI\nbutton, compare this label to a BMP, etc. \n\n-Raffie-\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; From: Andrew McDonagh &lt;yahoogroups@...&gt;\n&gt; Date: 2005/08/22 Mon PM 07:13:23 EDT\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: Re: [junit] Preventing JUnit from stopping on failures.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n\n\n  _____  \n\nYAHOO!
