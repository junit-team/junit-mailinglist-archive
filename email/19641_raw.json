During this process I noticed that the following\n=\r\ntest would pass:\n\nassertEquals(1.0f, 1.999f)\n\nbut that this test would fail=\r\n:\n\nassertEquals(1.0f, 2.0f)\n\nThe assertEquals being called here is assertEq=\r\nuals(Object, Object).\nAutoboxing kicks in and constructs two Floats. The co=\r\nmparison is then\ndone in isEquals(Object expected, Object actual) where the=\r\n check is\n\n((Number) expected).longValue() =3D=3D ((Number) actual).longVal=\r\nue()\n\nI realise that when comparing floating point values, one should\ngener=\r\nally use a delta, i.e., you want to call assertEquals(double,\ndouble, doubl=\r\ne), and in the case where you want the numbers to be\nexactly equal, you cou=\r\nld use a zero delta.\n\nHowever, it seems rather counter-intuitive that asser=\r\ntEquals(Object,\nObject) allows these completely different objects to compar=\r\ne equal.\n\nAny thoughts?\n\nRegards,\n\nAlbert Strasheim\n\n\n",
