These are the risks of writing the tests after the code.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen people just can&#39;t get themselves to write tests first, I tell them to do a little exercise with the code once they have written their tests and they are satisfied that they work:  comment each line of code out one at a time and re-run the tests.  At least one test should fail each time and they should also look at the error information to be sure that the test failed for the expected reason.  It&#39;s also good to go the other direction and try to make each test fail one at a time.  A test that has never failed in its existence is a risky test.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n..David..<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>] On Behalf Of mfeathers256<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, September 11, 2007 4:07 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [junit] Re: Help,what&#39;s wrong with my TDD practice in my daily life?<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a> &lt;mailto:junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt; , &quot;CÃ©dric Beust â(tm)&quot;&quot; &lt;cbeust@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi James,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On 9/10/07, James Carr &lt;james.r.carr@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; On 9/10/07, you wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Just like everything else, use TDD sparingly. I understand <br/>\nyou are<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; currently doing this as an exercise, so it&#39;s healthy to take <br/>\nit to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; extremes and do everything by the book in order to learn, <br/>\nbut in your<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; real work, use your judgment and decide for yourself when <br/>\nyou are<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; indeed writing too much code, in which case it&#39;s probably <br/>\nsafer to go<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the usual route (get your code to work, then write tests for <br/>\nit).<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The downside of TDD is that you can end up writing a lot of <br/>\ntests for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; business code that you quickly throw away and rewrite, so <br/>\nthe amount<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of churn can be quite high.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I disagree. When I&#39;ve found something difficult to write test <br/>\nfirst<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve always done a spike, then delete the code and rewrote it <br/>\ntest<br/>\n&gt; &gt; first. I&#39;ve always found the result to be a lot more cleaner,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; especially since I wind up cleaning up the code anyway when I <br/>\nused to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; write tests around them.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;d rather have my business code tested rather than not test it <br/>\nunder<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the assumption it will one day be thrown away. ;)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Well, I never suggested not writing tests, I was just saying that<br/>\n&gt; sometimes, it&#39;s okay to write your tests once you&#39;re done with the<br/>\n&gt; business code.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Here is a scenario I&#39;ve seen happen fairly often:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Write test1<br/>\n&gt; Write code1<br/>\n&gt; Write test2<br/>\n&gt; Write code2<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Then a refactoring comes to mind and you realize you don&#39;t need <br/>\ncode1<br/>\n&gt; and code2 any more, so you write code3, and suddenly, you find<br/>\n&gt; yourself having to refactor (or throw away) both test1 and test2.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I was simply suggesting that sometimes, the following flow works <br/>\nbetter:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Write code1<br/>\n&gt; Write code2<br/>\n&gt; &lt;realize a refactoring is possible&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Refactor code1/code2 into code3<br/>\n&gt; &lt;happy with the result, now we write the test&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Write test3<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Net result: two less tests to write.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes that sequence ends there and sometimes it becomes:<br/>\n<br/>\nWrite code1<br/>\nWrite code2<br/>\n&lt;realize a refactoring is possible&gt;<br/>\nRefactor code1/code2 into code3<br/>\n&lt;happy with the result, now we write the test&gt;<br/>\nWrite test3<br/>\nShit.
