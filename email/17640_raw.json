Some problems with multi-threading don&#39;t show up on a\n&gt; single cpu computer.\n\nWhile it is true that some problems are more likely to be visible on \nmulti-CPU systems, which used to be fairly rare except for servers,\nthe multi-CPU model is actually separate from my main concern.\n\nI haven&#39;t kept up with all the JVM implementations, but in olden days,\na lot of JVMs would not split Java threads across separate CPUs. That \nwas left to multi-tasking or other platform specific implementation details.\n\nAnd on systems with separate JVMs on separate CPUs, some problems\ndon&#39;t show up on multi-CPU systems that are real on single-JVM systems \nwith heavy multi-threading.\n\nIt may be that JUnit is focused on single unit tests that are executed \nsequentially. I haven&#39;t see &quot;Manning&#39;s &quot;TDD in Action&quot; &#39;\nso I could be wrong.\n\n-- \nPat Farrell\nhttp://www.pfarrell.com/\n\n\n",
