If you annot=\r\nate a test, then it is beforeClass and afterClass.\nAnd finally,\nif you anno=\r\ntate a method, then you are listening before/after that test\nclass.\n\nRegard=\r\ns,\nBogdan\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, Alistair Israel &lt;aisrael@...&gt; wrot=\r\ne:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi, David, Malte.\n&gt;\n&gt; May I barge in?\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m seeing myself, and oth=\r\ners needing what could be called &#39;lifecycle&#39;\n&gt; event listeners/hooks in JUn=\r\nit:\n&gt;  - JUnit startup/shutdown\n&gt;  - before/after suite\n&gt;  - before/after c=\r\nlass\n&gt;  - before/after method\n&gt;\n&gt; We have the last two, but not the others.=\r\n Other things we might be\n&gt; interested in are test successes, failures and =\r\nexceptions (currently\n&gt; available using the TestWatchman Rule).\n&gt;\n&gt; How abo=\r\nut calling them &quot;join points&quot;, being able to describe/group\n&gt; them using &quot;p=\r\noint cuts&quot; then specifying the associated code to be\n&gt; executed, or the &quot;ad=\r\nvice&quot;?\n&gt;\n&gt; We could even have &#39;around&#39; advice, which would be equivalent to=\r\n\n&gt; MethodRules. Advice &#39;around&#39; test class would be class rules, and so\n&gt; o=\r\nn.\n&gt;\n&gt; I realize the added complexity (not to mention the unfamiliar\n&gt; nome=\r\nnclature) might be controversial, so I&#39;ve been hesitating to\n&gt; suggest this=\r\n.\n&gt;\n&gt; - alistair\n&gt; --\n&gt; http://alistairisrael.wordpress.com\n&gt;\n\n\n\n",
