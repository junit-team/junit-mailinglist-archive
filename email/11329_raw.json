I&#39;m a 16-year-old high school student at Troy \nHigh School, in Fullerton, CA (Class of &#39;05).  Over the past half-\nyear or so, I have been working with my AP Computer Science teacher, \nDave Wittry, on a project to make JUnit testing more accessible to \nboth teachers and students called JAM*Tester (JUnit Auto-Matic \nTester).\n\nWe just recently released the Student Version of our tool, which may \nbe useful to more than just students.  Its goal is to aid in the \ncreation of JUnit TestCases.  It also runs the tests and reports \nJUnit results.  Additionally, it provides some code-coverage \nreporting, which can be extremely useful (fyi: code-coverage provided \nin part by Clover http://www.thecortex.net/clover).\n\nAdditionally, we have the Teacher Version of the tool.  The idea \nbehind this is that a Teacher can create a battery of tests for their \nstudents&#39; labs (possibly using the Student Version), and then \nautomatically compile and run the tests for all of their students at \nonce.\n\nIf you&#39;re interested, please come to our website, \nhttp://www.jamtester.com.  We would appreciate any feedback you may \nhave for us.\n\nThanks in advance for your support,\nDavid\n\n\n\n",
