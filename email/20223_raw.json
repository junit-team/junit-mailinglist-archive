You can=\r\n use it\nto test abstract classes as interfaces as well. Imagine you have a\n=\r\nRecycable Class that has a recycable()-method. Because a Recycable is\na ver=\r\ny abstract thing you simply create an AbstractRecycableTest like\nthis:\n\npub=\r\nlic abstract class AbstractRecycableTest extends TestCase {\n\n  private Recy=\r\ncable recycable =3D null;\n\n  public abstract Recycable createRecycable();\n\n=\r\n  public void setUp() {\n    this.recycable =3D this.createRecycable();\n  }\n=\r\n\n  public final void testIsRecycled() {\n    ...\n    this.recycable.recycle(=\r\n);\n    ...\n  }\n\n  public final void testRecycleToComponents() {\n    ...\n   =\r\n this.recycable.recycle();\n    ...\n  }\n}\n\nDeclare an abstract creation-meth=\r\nod for your concrete recycable, that\ncreates for example a tetrapack or bot=\r\ntle.\n\nThen create your concrete Testcases:\n\npublic class RecycableFlugzeugT=\r\nest extends AbstractRecycableTest {\n\n  @Override\n  public final Recycable c=\r\nreateRecycable() {\n    Flugzeug flugzeug =3D new Flugzeug();\n    return flu=\r\ngzeug;\n  }\n}\n\npublic class RecycableBottleTest extends AbstractRecycableTes=\r\nt {\n\n  @Override\n  public final Recycable createRecycable() {\n    Bottle bo=\r\nttle =3D new Bottle(1.0);\n    return bottle;\n  }\n}\n\nThis are the classes th=\r\nat can be run by the Testrunner.\n\nIn this general manner you are not only a=\r\nble to test that the\nrecycle()-method has been implemented. More over you a=\r\nre able to\nensure that the recycle()-method meets the requirements and that=\r\n for\neach implementing or inheriting class! So you only have to write a\nRec=\r\nycable[...]Test and implement a creation-method to ensure that your\nclass u=\r\nnder test is really recycable.\nMaybe somebody has the idea to inherit the R=\r\necycableMilkBottleTest\nfrom your RecycableBottleTest and tries to override =\r\nyour\ncreation-method in an unexpected way; so don&#39;t forget to make each\ncre=\r\nation method final to prevent this dangerous overriding.\n\n--- In junit@yaho=\r\nogroups.com, &quot;choi_chandima&quot; &lt;choi_chandima@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; hi friends ;\n&gt; =\r\ni&#39;m using NetBeans as my development environment and i&#39;m having an \n&gt; abstr=\r\nact parent class caled &quot;Vehicle&quot; that has been inherited by o3 sub \n&gt; clase=\r\ns namely Van ,Lory,...etc. when i want to test the parent class \n&gt; which is=\r\n abstract how could i do it as it doesn&#39;t let me instantiate.\n&gt; \n&gt; choi\n&gt;\n\n=\r\n\n\n",
