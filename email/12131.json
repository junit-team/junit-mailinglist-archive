Does anyone have any book recommendations to help with <br/>\n&gt;&gt; industry accepted terms and definitions? I have seen <br/>\n&gt;references to &quot;The <br/>\n&gt;&gt; Art of Software Testing&quot; by Glenford Myers that describe it as the <br/>\n&gt;&gt; seminal work on the matter. Is that book worth getting? Is there a <br/>\n&gt;&gt; website anywhere that has &quot;standard&quot; definitions that my <br/>\n&gt;co-workers and <br/>\n&gt;&gt; I can use for enlightenment on this matter?<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; All wisdom on this matter will be greatly appreciated.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Here&#39;s wisdom that nevertheless doesn&#39;t help you: it doesn&#39;t matter.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>JB, that&#39;s good wisdom, but you&#39;re right, it doesn&#39;t answer my question.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;If they&#39;re getting hung up on what words mean in some ethereal objective <br/>\n&gt;sense, rather than simply finding a workable vocabulary to help with <br/>\n&gt;their current discussion, then I have to wonder whether they <br/>\n&gt;care about <br/>\n&gt;communicating at all.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>We actually are working on the shared vocabiulary at this time, which is why I asked. I would prefer that we use accepted terminology, but I need some definitive source to show people, so that they will accept it. Otherwise, we&#39;ll be using the terminology that the process police give us. :-(<br/>\n<br/>\nRemember: large companies don&#39;t do anything until they&#39;ve defined what they&#39;re gonna call everything.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou know you&#39;re up against an interesting challenge, when one of the questions from an attendee is &quot;What&#39;s a unit?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSimon</div>",
