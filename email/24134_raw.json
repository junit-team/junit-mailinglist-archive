Being a Java Developer is all about\ntool-suppor=\r\nt. Your approach simply makes no sense. Even SSD space is cheap,\nRam is che=\r\nap, connections are fast. Checkout/pull junit with IntelliJ. It\nwill ask yo=\r\nu to open the project. If you have configured a SDK other than 5\ngot to pro=\r\nject settings (ctrl+alt+shift+s) and choose the one that you\nfavour. The pr=\r\noject will be up and running. Checking out and configuring\ntakes me around =\r\n1 minute. IntelliJ is the most keyboard-centric IDE i know.\nIf you want to =\r\nknow a shortcut simply use ctrl+shift+a to search for the\ncommand and see t=\r\nhe shortcut. You will not immediately know about all\nbenefits but as soon a=\r\ns you have learned to use the IDE properly and\nlearned about real Java deve=\r\nlopment you will laugh at the idea of coding\nusing vi.\nWanting to develop e=\r\nffectively and staying with vi/working on just a few\nfiles simply does not =\r\nmix. Developing Java (or any other advanced OO\nlanguage) means a lot of ref=\r\nactoring all the time. You will switch\napproaches constantly. Create/delete=\r\n classes, move methods, rename\nmethods/parameters, change configuration, ..=\r\n. Without proper tool support\nthis is hard work. Also you will never get th=\r\ne style a project is coded in\nand its design without looking at the whole. =\r\nFor instance the code ive seen\nin junit so far is not the typical code styl=\r\ne of a java project. I think a\nlot of code comes from people with a C backg=\r\nround. If I would add a class\nthe way I usually write it it would simply no=\r\nt fit in.\nI cannot go into more detail but it would be a good idea to just =\r\ndrop the\nbearded-unwashed-linux-freak-attitude and give it a try. If you re=\r\nally are\nopen to something new I promise that you will not regret it. But d=\r\nont take\nit lightly. It will take a few years to adjust and learn how to ef=\r\nfectively\nuse the tools. Also theres a lot of blog-post reading, tutorial w=\r\natching\naso. A good place to start to look at how things are served in the =\r\nJava\nworld is http://tv.jetbrains.net/channel/intellij-idea . And PLEASE: d=\r\nont\nrespond with &quot;i dont use flash&quot;. Thats another thing I dont want to dis=\r\ncuss\nabout any more ;)\nRegards, Henning.\n\n\n2012/12/4 Jaroslav Tulach &lt;jaros=\r\nlav.tulach@...&gt;\n\n&gt; **\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear command line lover.\n&gt; Your request =\r\nis special. It might match the NetBeans vision of the IDE\n&gt; reproducing to =\r\n100% everything that happens on command line. Give it a\n&gt; try.\n&gt; NetBeans h=\r\nave excellent support for Maven, can deal quite well with (even\n&gt; 3rd\n&gt; par=\r\nty created) Ant scripts and there is an experimental support for Gradle.\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; However, this still requires your checkout is buildable from command line=\r\n.\n&gt; Checking-out a single file and hoping the IDE will think-up the\n&gt; surro=\r\nunding\n&gt; environment is beyond the scope of what NetBeans (and obviously an=\r\ny other\n&gt; IDE)\n&gt; can do.\n&gt;\n&gt; We are trying to aim at &quot;self describing sourc=\r\nes&quot;: When you have (you have\n&gt; checked out) sources that a (supported) comm=\r\nand line tool can understood,\n&gt; NetBeans understands it as well.\n&gt;\n&gt; -jt\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; Dne =DAt 27. listopadu 2012 14:11:11, Fenn napsal(a):\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; hi folks,\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n I am a old command-line loving unix geek, but I want to get trendy and\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n learn at least one IDE. Up until now vi+BASH has been my IDE of\n&gt; &gt; choice=\r\n. I also already program in about two dozen languages.\n&gt; &gt; To try out my se=\r\na legs I want to compare and contract Eclipse,\n&gt; &gt; Netbeans, and IntelliJ I=\r\nDEA against the following use case:\n&gt; &gt; I need to grock some java code in a=\r\nn existing SVN repository. I want\n&gt; &gt; to pull down one existing java file, =\r\nwrite some junit tests, but not\n&gt; &gt; pull down the entire giant project it i=\r\ns attached to. I may need some\n&gt; &gt; moch objects too just to get it to compi=\r\nle, and to make the junit\n&gt; &gt; tests work.\n&gt; &gt; Most of the how-to and intro =\r\nstuff I can find on these IDEs starts\n&gt; &gt; with &quot;so you make your FIRST proj=\r\nect, then pull down some menus, and\n&gt; &gt; the wonderful IDE helps you type in=\r\n your FIRST java program, then if\n&gt; &gt; you really want to you can save the e=\r\nntire project in CVS!&quot; This is\n&gt; &gt; hardly EVER the scenario I run into. It =\r\nis more likely I need to jump\n&gt; &gt; into the middle of thousands or millions =\r\nof existing files and learn\n&gt; &gt; to swim without breaking anything, maybe ev=\r\nen fix a bug or add a\n&gt; &gt; feature.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Can anyone give me some tips on =\r\nthe &quot;best&quot; way to do this with his or\n&gt; &gt; her favorite IDE and some selecti=\r\non of plugins?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Brian Fennell\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this m=\r\nessage have been removed]\n\n\n",
