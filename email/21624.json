I&#39;d suggest that a good strategy for figuring this out is<br/>\n&gt; divide and conquer. First take JUnit out of the equation and see if<br/>\n&gt; you can get any kind of newly created class to launch on save.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; For more on some dynamic class loading ideas for Eclipse, perhaps this<br/>\n&gt; blog entry I wrote will help..<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://milesparker.blogspot.com/2009/03/dynamically-loading-classes-using.html\">http://milesparker.blogspot.com/2009/03/dynamically-loading-classes-using.html</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On Sat, May 16, 2009 at 8:59 AM, blekit@... &lt;blekit@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hello,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; i&#39;m currently writing a plugin which is supposed to launch JUnit4 Tests<br/>\n&gt; &gt; after each save. So far i&#39;m only loading every class that is changed using<br/>\n&gt; &gt; IResourceChangedListener and URLClassLoader:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; URLClassLoader classLoader = new URLClassLoader(new URL[]<br/>\n&gt; &gt; {outputDirectory.toURL(), new<br/>\n&gt; &gt; URL(&quot;file:/D:/eclipse/plugins/org.junit4_4.3.1/junit.jar&quot;) });<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Class&lt;?&gt; clazz = classLoader.loadClass(fileName);<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; At this point everything looks great - when i modify JUnit4 test class it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; gets loaded with annotations on proper methods (thanks to second URL -<br/>\n&gt; &gt; without it no annotation was loaded, and to be honest i don&#39;t know why).<br/>\n&gt; &gt; However, things start to go wrong when i pass the loaded class to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; JUnitCore.run method - the result i always get says that there was &quot;No<br/>\n&gt; &gt; runnable method&quot; exception even though there are clearly some method<br/>\n&gt; &gt; annotaded with @Test...<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I have little experience in writing plugins for Eclipse, so i&#39;m kind of lost<br/>\n&gt; &gt; now... I may suspect, that the problem is with not sufficient classpath<br/>\n&gt; &gt; (cause it seems that it was a reason why i had to add another URL to class<br/>\n&gt; &gt; loader) of my plugin. So i&#39;m asking if anyone ever tried to dynamically load<br/>\n&gt; &gt; test classes from Eclipse plugin and run them using JUnitCore - if so, I&#39;d<br/>\n&gt; &gt; be very grateful for helping me out with this problem.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Thanks in advance.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Best regards,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Michal Olejnik<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
