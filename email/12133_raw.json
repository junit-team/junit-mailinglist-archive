I did my job. :)\n\n&gt;  &gt;If they&#39;re getting hung up on what words mean in some ethereal objective\n&gt;  &gt;sense, rather than simply finding a workable vocabulary to help with\n&gt;  &gt;their current discussion, then I have to wonder whether they\n&gt;  &gt;care about\n&gt;  &gt;communicating at all.\n&gt; \n&gt; We actually are working on the shared vocabiulary at this time, which is \n&gt; why I asked. I would prefer that we use accepted terminology, but I need \n&gt; some definitive source to show people, so that they will accept it. \n&gt; Otherwise, we&#39;ll be using the terminology that the process police give \n&gt; us. :-(\n&gt; \n&gt; Remember: large companies don&#39;t do anything until they&#39;ve defined what \n&gt; they&#39;re gonna call everything.\n&gt; \n&gt; You know you&#39;re up against an interesting challenge, when one of the \n&gt; questions from an attendee is &quot;What&#39;s a unit?&quot;\n\nUnderstood. Do you see why I don&#39;t say &quot;unit test&quot;? :)\n\nI don&#39;t know that there is a definitive source that I would care to use. \nYou might wish to ask this question on a group like software-testing or \nagile-testing.\n-- \nJ.
