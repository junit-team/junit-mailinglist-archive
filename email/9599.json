You mean, I assume, that when you run C++ the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;&gt;&gt;Java is too embarassed to run at all?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;&gt; Huh?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;&gt; If the C++ program takes 10 seconds, how much is 100% of <br/>\n </span></blockquote>that? What<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;  &gt;&gt; would it give you if the Java version where slower by that <br/>\n </span></blockquote>amount?<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; I didn&#39;t expected this to be so strange. If c++ prog takes 100 <br/>\n </span></blockquote>seconds,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;  &gt; 10% more is 110, 30% more is 130 and 100% more is simply 200.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Yes. I think one might usually say &quot;twice as slow&quot;, or better <br/>\n </span></blockquote>yet, &quot;took<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; twice as long&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Tonight it is going down to zero. Tomorrow it is going to be <br/>\n </span></blockquote>twice as cold.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo be technical here, Temperature is not a ratio variable, it is an <br/>\ninterval variable.  There is no &#39;zero&#39; in temperature so it is not <br/>\ncorrect to say it is going to be twice as cold tomorrow. And yes, I <br/>\nknow there is &#39;absolute&#39; zero but ask any statistician and he will <br/>\ntell you that using ratios with our normal temperature scales is <br/>\nsimply wrong.  Using ratios with time works if you are using timed <br/>\ntests and define &#39;zero&#39; as no time.  Then yes, 5 minutes is twice as <br/>\nslow as 10 minutes.  Before benchmarking make sure you have a ratio <br/>\nlevel variable if you want to express your results in ratios.  Then <br/>\nyou must define the zero point otherwise your ratios are <br/>\nmeaningless.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMatt --</div>",
