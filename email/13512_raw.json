Thanks!\n\nWell, it&#39;s nothing to do with HashMaps. It&#39;s because you use the one array \nreference. So, the second time around the loop, you&#39;re writing into the \nsame array (&#39;act&#39;) as before, which means you&#39;re overwriting the previous \nset of values.\n\nDefine the &#39;act&#39; array inside the initial for loop, and the problem will go \naway.\n\nThe lesson here is to restrict variable declarations to the smallest scope \nthat you can get away with.\n\n-- \n                &quot;Software is too expensive to build cheaply&quot;\nRobert Watkins         http://twasink.net/          robertdw@...\n\n",
