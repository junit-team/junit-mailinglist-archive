I did not mean to say that there would be no\ndocumentation other than what Structure 101 can provide.  I meant to\nsay that it might be a while, and if you had specific questions, you\ncould spend some time with the diagramming tools, or ask specific\nquestions, and I hope you could write up what you&#39;ve learned.  There&#39;s\na lot I&#39;d like to do with JUnit, and I can&#39;t promise any design\ndocumentation in less than a month.  Thanks,\n\n   David\n\nOn Fri, Oct 24, 2008 at 9:55 AM, Hans Schwaebli\n&lt;hans_schwaebli@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Well, I tried that now. It is not the kind of documentation I meant.\n&gt;\n&gt; Such tools just twist and twirl data and present it in a way which does not\n&gt; help much to understand the design.\n&gt;\n&gt; A good documentation cannot be automated away or roundtripped.\n&gt;\n&gt; You need some text and some diagrams. Both need not be perfect. But as I\n&gt; said, that can&#39;t be automated, or at least is not valuable for understanding\n&gt; it quickly as it would be from a human who knows how man thinks and how the\n&gt; design is and what does matter to know and what is unnecessary detail.\n&gt;\n&gt; But it seems no matter what I would write, you mean that there will be no\n&gt; such manual documentation. A little design documentation would be very good\n&gt; for understanding such a widely used tool. Thousands of programmers should\n&gt; not need to download a specific tool and then discover that it does not help\n&gt; them understanding JUnit&#39;s design.\n&gt;\n&gt; Just my opinion.\n&gt;\n&gt; --- On Thu, 10/23/08, David Saff &lt;david@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; From: David Saff &lt;david@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: Re: [junit] Design documentation for JUnit 4.x?\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Thursday, October 23, 2008, 1:45 PM\n&gt;\n&gt; None published.\n&gt;\n&gt; If someone wanted to download a trial copy of Structure 101 and\n&gt;\n&gt; produce some, that&#39;d be cool, and I&#39;d be happy to answer questions.\n&gt;\n&gt; David Saff\n&gt;\n&gt; On Thu, Oct 23, 2008 at 4:36 AM, Hans Schwaebli\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;hans_schwaebli@ yahoo.com&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Is there any design documentation for JUnit 4.x?\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I mean class diagrams and sequence diagrams?\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; __\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n",
