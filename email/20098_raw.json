I am, however, using\ndocumentation asserts (in the co=\r\nmments) that actually shows up in the\nJUnit report in Eclipse, so I get pre=\r\ntty good feedback. One way of\nputting it is that I&#39;m test-driving the docum=\r\nentation while I&#39;m\ndocumentation-driving the tests... :-)\n\nI&#39;m still not su=\r\nre exactly the best place to use Bumblebee (or\nProtest), but I know that fo=\r\nr API-documentation it will definitely be\na good thing.\nWith TDDoc I experi=\r\nmented with Abbot tests (&quot;GUI-clicking&quot;) where I\ncomplemented the comments =\r\nwith images by pulling bitmaps from the\nSwing frames, and then generating J=\r\navaHelp files (using docbook), and\nit actually worked (with a few minor fla=\r\nws). It should be possible to\ndo the same thing with Bumblebee. I don&#39;t wan=\r\nt to start a new thread\non whether GUI-clicking is a good way to test your =\r\napplication (I\ngenerally think it is not), but with automatically generated=\r\n JavaHelp\nin the equation the balance might change a bit for some people.\n\n=\r\nCheers\nDaniel, still wanting more feedback\n\n\nOn Nov 12, 2007 10:18 PM, Nat =\r\nPryce &lt;nat.pryce@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Very interesting! I like t=\r\nhe idea of generating useful documentation from\n&gt;  test code. I wrote a too=\r\nl & test framework with similar goals for Python\n&gt;  called Protest (http://=\r\nxspecs.sf.net/protest.html).\n&gt;\n&gt;  One interesting effect I found when using=\r\n Protest is that the generated\n&gt;  documentation was enough of a different p=\r\nerspective on the test code that\n&gt;  just skim-reading it gave really fast f=\r\needback on whether the tests acted\n&gt; as\n&gt;  a clear description of the teste=\r\nd code&#39;s behaviour.\n&gt;\n&gt;  --Nat\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  On 11/11/2007, Daniel Brolund &lt;dani=\r\nel.brolund@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Hi all,\n&gt;  &gt; I would really apprecia=\r\nte some feedback on a small framework I&#39;m\n&gt;  &gt; writing for JUnit 4.4.\n&gt;  &gt;\n=\r\n&gt;  &gt; I call it Bumblebee, and the purpose of it is to use comments and the\n=\r\n&gt;  &gt; structures in the test-suites/cases/methods to create &quot;human-readable&quot;=\r\n\n&gt;  &gt; documentation. It is especially well suited for writing snippet-heavy=\r\n\n&gt;  &gt; documentation.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; In short, Bumblebee gets events from the exe=\r\ncution of the tests\n&gt;  &gt; (suites/classes/methods) and then parses the class=\r\nes and methods for\n&gt;  &gt; specific comments to include.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; By default =\r\nit adds the de-camelcased names of the suites/cases/methods\n&gt;  &gt; as heading=\r\ns (a la agile dox), and the contained comments becomes the\n&gt;  &gt; paragraphs.=\r\n\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; The comments are actually handled as Ruby-strings that get execu=\r\nted in\n&gt;  &gt; a Bumblebee execution context before being added to the output.=\r\n The\n&gt;  &gt; execution context is\n&gt;  &gt; a kind of DSL for including code-snippe=\r\nts and other things needed, and\n&gt;  &gt; one of the core ideas of Bumblebee is =\r\nthat you should be able to\n&gt;  &gt; extend that functionality easily.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;=\r\n More detailed information about Bumblebee can be found at:\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; http:=\r\n//www.agical.com/bumblebee/bumblebee_doc.html\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; which is of course =\r\ngenerated with Bumblebee. :-)\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; The concept of Bumblebee is the sam=\r\ne as for TDDoc, which me and Joakim\n&gt;  &gt; Ohlrogge wrote some time ago as an=\r\n add-on for RMock. Unfortunately,\n&gt;  &gt; TDDoc became a bit of a dead-end tec=\r\nhnically, and Joakim and I thought\n&gt;  &gt; it would be a good idea to start fr=\r\nesh. I happened to have the time at\n&gt;  &gt; the time and I started it up. So, =\r\nif you like Bumblebee, give half of\n&gt;  &gt; your credits to Joakim!\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; =\r\nThis is an early release, and I will be very happy for any feedback I\n&gt;  &gt; =\r\ncan get to improve it.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Cheers\n&gt;  &gt; Daniel Brolund\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; _____=\r\n_____________________\n&gt;  &gt; Daniel Brolund\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Agical AB\n&gt;  &gt; V=E4ster=\r\nl=E5nggatan 79, 2 tr\n&gt;  &gt; 111 29 Stockholm, SWEDEN\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; web: www.agica=\r\nl.com\n&gt;  &gt; mob: +46-708-754002\n&gt;  &gt; mail: daniel.brolund@... &lt;daniel=\r\n.brolund%40agical.com&gt;\n&gt;  &gt; blog: danielbrolund.wordpress.com\n&gt;  &gt; priv: da=\r\nniel.brolund@... &lt;daniel.brolund%40gmail.com&gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  [Non-tex=\r\nt portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n\n\n\n-- \n________________=\r\n__________\nDaniel.Brolund@...\n\n",
