Must be the=\r\n next book to order...\n \n&gt; I&#39;d suggest classes which are likely to be worke=\r\nd on &quot;soon&quot;. Those are,\n&gt; after all, the ones which you might otherwise bre=\r\nak, and for which\n&gt; unit tests will add most value.\n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s tempting to s=\r\ntart with &quot;easy&quot; ones, but you run the risk of writing\n&gt; tests for things t=\r\nhat won&#39;t change and won&#39;t break, and you&#39;d gain an\n&gt; unrealistic view of h=\r\now easy it is(n&#39;t) to add tests post-hoc.\n\nYes, actually writing JUnit test=\r\ns is just another development\ntask/cycle you must put efforts in to explore=\r\n bugs at unit-level,\nisn&#39;t it. Perhaps the TDD methodology mixes these two =\r\ndevelopment\ncycles nattily...\n\nIt would be interesting to see a statistics =\r\nhow many bugs an\nOO-project has at unit-level and how many at integration-l=\r\nevel (during\ncooperation of objects).\n\nThanks Chris,\n csaba\n\n\n\n",
