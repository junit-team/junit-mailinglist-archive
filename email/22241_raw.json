Isn&#39;t removing tedium why we have computers in the first =\r\nplace?\n\nKent\n\nOn Dec 29, 2009, at 2:28 PM, Pigneri, Rocco wrote:\n\n&gt; Charlie=\r\n,\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;As a framework author, I can see that allowing the user to\n&gt; &gt;specif=\r\ny ordering is a simpler implementation. But I think\n&gt; &gt;it&#39;s more interestin=\r\ng to imagine the user specifying the\n&gt; &gt;nature of the dependencies and allo=\r\nwing the framework to\n&gt; &gt;figure out a strategy.\n&gt;\n&gt; I am very much with you=\r\n on this one. In my experience, there have been a lot of times when functio=\r\nns under test within the same class depend upon each other, and it would ha=\r\nve been great to have the test harness know that information. When I was re=\r\nfactoring code for a new framework package, I would have loved to have the =\r\nUI to display non-dependent tests first as it would have shown me very clea=\r\nrly the source of the problem.\n&gt;\n&gt; Specifying only the relationships in cod=\r\ne and leaving the display strategy to the test harness would allow more fle=\r\nxible display and execution of these tests based upon the user&#39;s goals rath=\r\ner than upon the dependencies themselves. I could imagine myself asking the=\r\n UI only to display the least dependent functions&#39; errors and to hide all o=\r\nther errors for quick debugging on sweeping optimizations. I could also wan=\r\nt to see the dependent tests in a tree in case I am changing a single class=\r\n and want to understand the effects of what I am touching. I could also wan=\r\nt to see all tests in a single list with the least dependent at the top and=\r\n the most dependent on the bottom when running regression tests. As you can=\r\n see, the chosen view depends more upon what I am doing than upon the test =\r\ndependencies themselves.\n&gt;\n&gt; Finally, being able to list dependencies betwe=\r\nen test classes in addition to test cases would also JUnit to report which =\r\ncomponents of the system depend upon each other. This simple extension woul=\r\nd greatly increase the power of the dependency models for larger systems (p=\r\narticularly regression tests).\n&gt;\n&gt; Thank you,\n&gt;\n&gt; Rocco\n&gt;\n&gt; From: junit@yah=\r\noogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of Charlie Poole\n&gt; Se=\r\nnt: Thursday, December 24, 2009 12:09 AM\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subj=\r\nect: RE: [junit] Order of execution for tests\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi C=E9dric,\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; On a=\r\nnother list, I identified the same variations of dependency but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; with =\r\nthe variation that for case 1. We might run B anyway but could\n&gt; &gt; &gt; highli=\r\nght the error in A in some way. That approach doesn&#39;t require\n&gt; &gt; &gt; orderin=\r\ng the tests in any particular way, which has some advantages.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; It stil=\r\nl promotes developer efficiency while not worrying about\n&gt; &gt; &gt; execution ef=\r\nficiency.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yes, we call these &quot;soft dependencies&quot;.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If =\r\n&quot;b&quot; has a hard dependency on &quot;a&quot; and &quot;a&quot; fails, &quot;a&quot; will\n&gt; &gt; be marked &quot;FAI=\r\nLED&quot; and b &quot;SKIPPED&quot;.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If &quot;b&quot; has a soft dependency on &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot; will=\r\n still run even\n&gt; &gt; if &quot;a&quot; fails but a warning could be displayed in the lo=\r\ng.\n&gt;\n&gt; This is an implementation-based view of the tests: i.e. they\n&gt; will =\r\neither be run or not run.\n&gt;\n&gt; The distinction I was trying to make - and I =\r\nthink David as\n&gt; well - is based on the cause and nature of the dependency.=\r\n\n&gt; For the sake of argument, I&#39;ll try to redefine what you&#39;re\n&gt; calling Har=\r\nd and Soft along those lines.\n&gt;\n&gt; Hard: Test A does something (sets state) =\r\nupon which B depends.\n&gt; For example, A may write to a data store and B migh=\r\nt try to\n&gt; read the information back. Or A might create a complex object\n&gt; =\r\nand B might try to call a method on that object. If we allow\n&gt; this sort of=\r\n thing, then there is no choice but to run A first\n&gt; and it makes sense to =\r\nnot run B at all if A fails. However,\n&gt; I would not want a unit test framew=\r\nork to allow it.\n&gt;\n&gt; Soft: Test A tests some functionality upon which some =\r\nother\n&gt; functionality, tested by B, depends. Therefore, if test A\n&gt; fails, =\r\nTest B will either fail as well or be inconclusive,\n&gt; so nothing further ca=\r\nn be learned from test B. In this case,\n&gt; a testing framework could respond=\r\n in a number of ways to\n&gt; the dependency:\n&gt; 1) Run the tests in order, skip=\r\nping B if A fails.\n&gt; 2) Run the tests in an arbitrary order, but skip B if =\r\nA\n&gt; already ran and failed.\n&gt; 3) Run the tests in an arbitrary order, not s=\r\nkipping any\n&gt; of them but organize reporting in such a way that a failure\n&gt;=\r\n of A takes precedence over a failure of B.\n&gt;\n&gt; As a framework author, I ca=\r\nn see that allowing the user to\n&gt; specify ordering is a simpler implementat=\r\nion. But I think\n&gt; it&#39;s more interesting to imagine the user specifying the=\r\n\n&gt; nature of the dependencies and allowing the framework to\n&gt; figure out a =\r\nstrategy.\n&gt;\n&gt; Charlie\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Every time we have discussed this potential fea=\r\nture for\n&gt; &gt; TestNG, the discussion ended up being non conclusive on the\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; real interest and the existing ability to mark certain\n&gt; &gt; methods as &quot;al=\r\nwaysRun&quot; already fills a big part of this\n&gt; &gt; scenario, so I always ended u=\r\np punting on it, but I&#39;d be\n&gt; &gt; happy to hear if someone can come up with a=\r\n good use case for\n&gt; &gt; soft dependencies...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --\n&gt; &gt; ***C=E9dric\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n*\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
