If they were non<br/>\n&gt; static, you could just create an instance and invoke these methods on that<br/>\n&gt; instance.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>But that won&#39;t be the same instance on which the tests are invoked, so<br/>\nthe method would make no sense without global side effects.  And if<br/>\nyou&#39;re going to do global side effects, you might as well make the<br/>\nmethod static.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; That&#39;s what TestNG does, by the way, although it makes more sense for TestNG<br/>\n&gt; since it&#39;s that same instance that will be used to invoke all the test<br/>\n&gt; methods afterwards, thereby allowing you to share fields between your<br/>\n&gt; @BeforeClass/@AfterClass and @Test methods.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, and also allowing users to never be sure that changes to instance<br/>\nmethods in one method won&#39;t corrupt results in a different method.  If<br/>\na user that is not an author of either framework is truly fascinated<br/>\nabout the differences in design philosophies between the two<br/>\nframeworks, my guess is that they will create a thread with an<br/>\nappropriate title, so that those people just trying to get their work<br/>\ndone can mute it and move on.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It might not be as useful for JUnit, but encouraging people to use statics<br/>\n&gt; in their test classes is problematic, in my opinion.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t encourage it.  JUnit encourages people to think about ways to<br/>\npush their designs in tests in directions so that most of their tests<br/>\ndo not require setup that is so expensive they have to wring their<br/>\nhands about how often it runs.  When that fails, JUnit allows users to<br/>\neasily separate the static state, which they _want_ to think about<br/>\nmaintaining between tests, from the instant state, which they are glad<br/>\nto let the framework set up and teardown for them.<br/>\n<br/>\n   David Saff<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; Cédric<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
