It is about design.\n\nThere is value, though, in generating JUnit tests both for people who\nare not able or not willing to do TDD. We (Agitar) have been working\non this problem and have an experimental version of our test\ngeneration engine available at www.junitfactory.com. There is a free\ndemo online and I can get an invitation for anyone who would like to\ntry it for real in Eclipse.\n\nIt is primarily designed for people who do not do TDD but we,\ninternally, find it a useful complement to cover the cases that TDD\nmisses or to bring legacy code under test in the way that Michael\nFeathers describes in Working Effectively with Legacy Code.\n\n\nKevin\n\nwww.junitfactory.com\nYou send us code. We send you tests.\n\n",
