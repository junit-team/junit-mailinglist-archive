Imagine what happens when somebody litters the\ncode with &quot;catch (RuntimeException e)&quot; because there are a whole lot of\nunchecked exceptions floating around. Having assertions failures be\nError means that only the most crude and brutish programmers (who\n&quot;catch (Throwable e)&quot; or &quot;catch (Error e)&quot;) will get it. Frankly, those\nheathens deserve what they get.\n\nAssertion failures should be caught. Meyer is right on this.\n\nRegards,\n\nRob\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
