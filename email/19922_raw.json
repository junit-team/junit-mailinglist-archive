T=\r\nhis is the difference\n&gt; &gt;  between\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; &quot;framework&quot; and &quot;platform&quot;.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;  Dear J.B. Rainsberger,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  It is a metter of opinion, the question=\r\n is simple: =BFCan I change\n&gt; &gt;  dinamically during a jUnit test the classp=\r\nath?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  The answer you provide instead of saying NO, :-) is: use Ant.=\r\n \n=BFWhy?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  Under jUnit, I can modify life cicle of the running proc=\r\ness in \norder\n&gt; &gt;  to make tests, why not to let the user to alter also som=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt;  configuration information for example: classpath (and probably \nit i=\r\ns\n&gt; &gt;  possible, specifying some class loader mechanism, but I am not \nan\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;  expert on that)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  I don&#39;t like test that depends on IDE&#39;s, becau=\r\nse when the \nproject\n&gt; &gt;  grows up you end up that is much better to run th=\r\nem under \nconsole,\n&gt; &gt;  that is why I don&#39;t like to assume specific locatio=\r\nn of Eclipse\n&gt; &gt;  classpath.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; David,\n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s hard to say without =\r\nseeing more of the code, but it sounds \nlike\n&gt; you have too strong an attac=\r\nhment to the usage of the \njava.class.path\n&gt; system property. If you want t=\r\nhat much control over loading stuff \nfrom\n&gt; a classpath, then you might wan=\r\nt to look at a custom classloader to\n&gt; control where resources are obtained=\r\n from.\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; \n&gt; James\n&gt;\n\nJames,\n\nThat was my first idea, because I=\r\n suspect that there is no other \ngeneral solution, but I don&#39;t have experie=\r\nnce configuring the class \nloader mechanism. That is why I was asking to th=\r\ne list.\n\nThanks,\n\nDavid\n\nP.D.: I have posted to the list a quite general so=\r\nlution without \nchaning the classpath.\n\n\n\n",
