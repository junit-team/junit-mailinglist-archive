For example, JUnit4Runner is an internal\n&gt; class (I know I should not depend on internal classes but it made the\n&gt; work so easy).\n\nAs extenders may have noticed, with 4.5, we&#39;re trying to be kinder to\npeople that have extended internal classes in 4.4, and will likely\ncontinue a kinder social contract into the future.  We&#39;ve found that\nit&#39;s taken a long while to settle on the internal structure of the\ndefault JUnit 4 class runner, so it&#39;s going to stay in the internal\npackage for at least another version, to indicate that this code is\nstill much less stable than the public API&#39;s, but we&#39;ll work harder to\nmake sure that custom runners that compile without deprecation\nwarnings in 4.(x) will still work in 4.(x+1).\n\n&gt; So the Eclipse version, which ships with JUnit 4.3 could not depend on\n&gt; the same base class as the JUnit 4.4-based version, which ships with\n&gt; IntelliJ.\n\nI didn&#39;t know IntelliJ had caught up.  Good for them.\n\n&gt; Also, I *think* the version of the jar that ships with Eclipse is\n&gt; missing the classes in the internal package.\n\nI don&#39;t think that&#39;s true.  What led you to think that?\n\nThanks,\n\n   David Saff\n\n",
