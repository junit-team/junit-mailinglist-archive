But reading 1 FAILURE, 9 SKIPS, or 2 FAILURES, 8 SKIPS,<br/>\nor 3 FAILURES, 7 SKIPS, doesn&#39;t tell me that the failures would have<br/>\nworked if the broken ones had passed. I need to fix the (first) broken<br/>\ntest, then re-run the others. Which is what I do with JUnit now. So<br/>\nhow does knowing that 9 were skipped change my life?<br/>\n<br/>\nNot to mention that with 3 FAILURES, 7 SKIPS, you don&#39;t _know_ that<br/>\nthe three failures weren&#39;t related, and should have been marked with a<br/>\ndependency anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; And it&#39;s so easy for the testing framework to provide accurate reports if it<br/>\n&gt; gets a little help from the developer...<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, but that help:<br/>\n1) Requires work from the developer<br/>\n2) Doesn&#39;t actually make the developer&#39;s life easier (the way the<br/>\ntests get fixed and verified doesn&#39;t change)<br/>\n3) Does make the tests run faster - but that&#39;s a seperate problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nBoth TestNG and JUnit provide accurate reports, with different<br/>\nprecision. TestNG trades off precision with uncertainty to get greater<br/>\nspeed - this is valid, but there are other ways to get the speed as<br/>\nwell.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\n               &quot;Software is too expensive to build cheaply&quot;<br/>\nRobert Watkins           <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://twasink.net/\">http://twasink.net/</a>           <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:robertdw@...\">robertdw@...</a></div>",
