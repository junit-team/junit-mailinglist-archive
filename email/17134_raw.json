So if I have three\n&gt; test cases in the suite, and the first and third test cases succeed,\n&gt; then the output file looks like &quot;..F.&quot; followed by the errors and a\n&gt; summary of how many successes/failures. There are about 80 test cases\n&gt; in the suite I&#39;m working with, and it is very time consuming and error\n&gt; prone to try to figure out which tests succeeded and which ones failed\n&gt; from a long list of dots and dot-F&#39;s. What I would like instead is to\n&gt; have the report look something like this:\n&gt; \n&gt; test-01-01: success\n&gt; test-01-02: failure\n&gt; test-02-01: success\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;errors&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;summary&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; I have looked at the JavaDoc for junit.textui.TestRunner and there is\n&gt; no way to specify how the final report comes out, more specifically no\n&gt; way to tell it to print the name of the test case and the result\n&gt; rather than either &quot;.&quot; for success or &quot;.F&quot; for failures.\n&gt; \n&gt; Can anyone advise me how I can modify this behavior? Am I stuck and\n&gt; just need to write a parser to convert the &quot;..F.&quot; to a meaningful\n&gt; report as to which tests succeeded or failed (as in the above example)?\n\nYou&#39;re not stuck writing a parser. Instead, you can write a TestListener \nthat generates the kind of report you&#39;d like to generate. I&#39;ve taken the \nliberty of sending you (privately) a recipe from _JUnit Recipes_ on the \ntopic. I have found it easiest to use the JUnit-addons test runner and \nplug in whatever test listeners I want.\n\nTake care.\n-- \nJ. B.
