Continuing this further, I woud like to bring the question of development overheads involved.\n1) What efforts have you guys taken in your respective organizations to reduce the programming overhead associated with writing unit tests? \n2) What are the tools you use for creation of unit tests, if any?\n3) Do you prefer using tools for unit tests creation?\n4) We use JBuilder in our development efforst. What would you advise us to go for to reduce our development overheads associated with unit tests?\n5) What do you guys think of cactus?\nThanks again for the valuable insight you guys have provided with this discussion.\n Mike Clark &lt;mike@...&gt; wrote:J.

It&#39;s an organizational exercise that lends \nitself to the way I run tests.  \n\nI know of many ways to search for and run all tests in the system.  When \nI&#39;ve needed to do that, and for some reason I don&#39;t have an AllTests \nsuite already built, I use the Ant batchtest.  I can&#39;t say I&#39;ve pulled \nthat lever as a safeguard against forgetting to add tests to a suite \nthough.  Alas, it&#39;s not because I have a good memory.  Rather, when \nbuilding things test-first I generally notice those errors of omission \nearly.      \n\n&gt;If there were a nice graphical\n&gt;tool to make it easy, would that help? \n&gt;\n\nPerhaps.  Eclipse has a wizard for creating a test suite, allowing you \nto pick which test classes to include from a list of tests it \nautomagically finds.  I haven&#39;t used it much, but think I might try it \nfor a while.  I can always fall back to writing the suites by hand.    \n\n&gt;Is it worth your while to build it?\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nI couldn&#39;t justify building it given my current needs.  That&#39;s not to \nsay if it were built I wouldn&#39;t use it, but it&#39;s not a tool I reach for.\n\nMIke\n\n-- \nMike Clark\nhttp://clarkware.com \n(720) 851-2014\n\n\n\nYahoo!
