For private projects this approach is very \nusefull, and I&#39;ve used it in several projects. But for a public \nframework, I am convinced this is not the way to go.\n\nThanks anyway,\n\nMartijn\n\nKevin Klinemeier wrote:\n\n&gt; This is just from the hip, but if you&#39;re intending to provide new\n&gt; functionality in a &quot;similar&quot; API, you might consider this:\n&gt;\n&gt; 1. Put your setUp and tearDown code in the TestCase.setUp() and\n&gt; tearDown() as usual.\n&gt;\n&gt; 2. Declare your setUp() and tearDown() as final.\n&gt;\n&gt; 3. Expose a new overridable method for clients to use.\n&gt;\n&gt; In general, that&#39;s the approach I use when I want to allow subclasses\n&gt; to add functionality, but fear that they&#39;ll &quot;forget&quot; to call super(..).\n&gt;\n&gt; This, of course, breaks every test currently written for your\n&gt; framework, and changes your API slightly from the very familiar JUnit\n&gt; API.  As a rebuttal (although I have no opinion either way) it isn&#39;t as\n&gt; though it&#39;s a difficult fix since your compiler will tell you\n&gt; everywhere to do it. \n&gt;\n&gt; Alternatively, whatever functionality your test classes provide could\n&gt; simply fail with a useful message if the super.setUp() isn&#39;t called.\n&gt; Catching and reliably reporting a forgotten tearDown() call is tricker,\n&gt; though.\n\n\n\n\n",
