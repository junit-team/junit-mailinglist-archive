We\nhave done what you suggest and pulled most of the guts out so that we can\nexercise them in junit.  However, we have found that typically a large\nnumber of bugs involve IE, Netscape, signing issues, or applet parameter\nissues.  So your comment about automating the applet testing is extremely\ninteresting to me.  Can you elaborate?  Your comment about extending\nTestRunner to test applets is likewise very interesting.\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Eric Vought [mailto:evought@...]\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, September 27, 2001 7:38 AM\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: Re: [junit] Testing Applets\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Wed, 26 Sep 2001, Jamie Nettles wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I want to test an applet or pieces of an applet using jUnit.  Any\n&gt; &gt; suggestions?\n&gt; \n&gt; Well, the first thing to suggest is that its no different \n&gt; from testing any\n&gt; other application (as Bob Koss points out). To expand on \n&gt; that, the thing\n&gt; which makes an application is just its main method. Everything else is\n&gt; just a collection of objects and classes which can be unit tested.\n&gt; Similarly, what makes an applet an applet is just the fact \n&gt; that you have\n&gt; an Applet implementation which ties all the rest of your \n&gt; classes together\n&gt; into a working whole. The rest is just objects and classes \n&gt; which you can\n&gt; easily test.\n&gt; \n&gt; It is relatively straight forward to write an applet in such \n&gt; a way that\n&gt; you can actually run it either as an applet or standalone. \n&gt; You do that by\n&gt; separating all of the function of the applet into other \n&gt; classes which are\n&gt; simply delegated to by a very thin Applet implementation. \n&gt; Even your main\n&gt; Panel can be separated out easily. You can then instantiate that Panel\n&gt; either inside the Applet or inside a Frame created from your \n&gt; application.\n&gt; If your applet runs in its own Frame, this is even easier. \n&gt; This type of\n&gt; modularization will also make the code much easier to unit test.\n&gt; \n&gt; You don&#39;t, therefore, need to run your unit tests in a web \n&gt; browser. They\n&gt; are run standalone from one of the junit testrunners, just like with\n&gt; everything else. You can change security settings around testcases to\n&gt; simulate the default restrictions of a browser. It *is* possible to\n&gt; automate testing of applets running in browsers for purposes of\n&gt; portability testing, for instance, but this is non-trivial \n&gt; and should be\n&gt; avoided unless/until really necessary. (It&#39;s really \n&gt; functional testing,\n&gt; not unit testing)\n&gt; \n&gt; [Aside: Has anyone thought about creating an Applet based \n&gt; TestRunner? This\n&gt; would make it significantly easier for folks (like us) that \n&gt; do portability\n&gt; testing across a gagillion VMs. When I did some of this sort \n&gt; of work for\n&gt; IBM (Orion/On Demand Server), we had to write the browser based test\n&gt; automation pretty much from scratch and it was not fun to get \n&gt; it to run in\n&gt; the various browser targets. Changes in the security API and better\n&gt; conformance since then plus the very modular nature of junit \n&gt; should make\n&gt; it *almost* trivial now.
