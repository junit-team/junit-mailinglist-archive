So, framework should provide some way to\n&gt;=\r\n supply test data lazily.\n&gt;\n&gt; From other hand if you think of IDE it should=\r\n be possible to run\n&gt; just specific test or only selected test cases. o, it=\r\n seems that there\n&gt; should be some random-acess API, which iteterator just =\r\ndoes not provide.\n&gt;\n&gt; Also note that one would be interested to know how ma=\r\nny test cases\n&gt; in the given data provider as well as a readable name for e=\r\nach test.\n\n\nI exchanged a few emails with JB about that, and my take on &quot;da=\r\nta names&quot; is\nbasically: I don&#39;t see the need.\n\nIf a test method being fed b=\r\ny a data provider fails, it will clearly say\nsomething like &quot;Expected 42 bu=\r\nt got 41&quot;. From that point, it&#39;s pretty easy\nto trace which data from the d=\r\nata set caused this error and act on it.\n\nActually, I would probably not ev=\r\nen care about that myself: I would rerun my\ntests, put a breakpoint on any =\r\nassertion thrown and let the IDE show me\nexactly where and when the test fa=\r\nils. Whether this test method was fed data\nfrom a DataProvider or from some=\r\nwhere else is irrelevant to fix the test.\n\nPS: Cedric, I thouight we alread=\r\ny discussed above points. Did you\n&gt; forgot that or my arguments wasn&#39;t very=\r\n covincing?\n\n\nNot at all, Eugene. In my response to Elliotte, I mentioned t=\r\nhat he wasn&#39;t\nthe first one to make this request and I obviously had you in=\r\n mind :-)\n\nAfter thinking about it more, it might actually be completely tr=\r\nivial for\nTestNG to support lazy data providers. I&#39;ll take a stab at it and=\r\n I&#39;ll\nreport here with the results.\n\n\n--\nC=E9dric\n\n\n[Non-text portions of t=\r\nhis message have been removed]\n\n\n",
