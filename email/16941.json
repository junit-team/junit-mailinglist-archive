I don&#39;t have the energy to list all<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; the problems with it, but I will point out that someone on this list<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; wrote about 300 pages on bringing Java legacy code under test, including<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; dozens of examples that cover the core of a J2EE application. What more<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; do you need?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I never said it was not possible, I was just complaining about the way Agile<br/>\n&gt; developers try to convince their audience.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I wish you would qualify that statement somehow. &quot;many&quot;, &quot;some&quot;, &quot;a <br/>\nfew&quot;... surely not /all/.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; As for the &quot;sloppiest&quot; part, about forty people have commented on my post so<br/>\n&gt; far, and a lot of them with experiences confirming my observations. Maybe<br/>\n&gt; you find it sloppy, but I suggest you look beyond the form, because there<br/>\n&gt; are obviously some real points in there...<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I find it sloppy to generalize to an entire community based on the <br/>\nactions of a few. That&#39;s what you seem to be doing. I find it sloppy to <br/>\nclaim that there&#39;s nothing in the literature that talks about testing <br/>\nreal J2EE applications, when clearly there is. I further find it sloppy <br/>\nto appeal to the reasoning of other sloppy thinkers, no matter how many <br/>\nof them happen to agree with you.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn general, we make far too many sweeping generalizations (irony <br/>\nintended as a joke). I, for one, try to qualify my statements and base <br/>\nthose qualifications on real evidence. I think it would be very nice <br/>\nindeed if more of us did that more often.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
