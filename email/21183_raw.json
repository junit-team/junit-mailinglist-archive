We are using mercurial at my company and it works well on both\n=\r\n&gt; windox, linux and mac. What is mainly lacking is good ide support but\n&gt; I=\r\n say that netbeans support mercurial natively now so maybe that is\n&gt; worth =\r\na try.\n&gt;\n&gt; Sharesource does not seem to have any export restrictions but is=\r\n\n&gt; lacking review features as far as I know. But it has this certain warm\n&gt;=\r\n fuzzy family &quot;niceness&quot; to it and does not feel as big and bulky as\n&gt; sour=\r\nceforge does. I felt had to mention sharesource because I like it,\n&gt; I also=\r\n think that whatever is lacking in features would be looked into\n&gt; in order=\r\n to accomodate such a well known project such as JUnit, but\n&gt; thats just ho=\r\nw I reasoning if I was running sharesource :)\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; In my book a di=\r\nstributed vcs such as Git, mercurial or bazaar would be\n&gt; a big plus.\n&gt; /J\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; On Tue, Dec 9, 2008 at 8:24 PM, mark_p_thornton\n&gt; &lt;mark.p.thornton@nt=\r\nlworld.com &lt;mark.p.thornton%40ntlworld.com&gt;&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; --- In junit@yahoog=\r\nroups.com &lt;junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt;, &quot;Nat Pryce&quot;\n&gt; &lt;nat.pryce@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; 2008/12/8 Shane Mingins &lt;shane.mingins@...&gt;:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Have you c=\r\nonsidered git and github ... just as a thought?\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; http://github=\r\n.com/\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Not sure how that fits in the Java space or not.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; It&#39;s more of a problem for people working on Windows.
