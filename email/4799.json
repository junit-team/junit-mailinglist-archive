[...] However, code does touch<br/>\n&gt; external resources at some point.  Shouldn&#39;t this be tested, and how?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Specifically, I have code that parses a xml catalog file and builds a<br/>\n&gt; catalog object structure.  I want to verify that the parsing works<br/>\n&gt; correctly.<br/>\n&gt; [...]<br/>\n&gt; But to do this test I do need some external resource, a simple catalog<br/>\n&gt; file.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What I do in this case is embed the contents of the file in the test as a<br/>\nstring constant and use that for testing.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, sometimes I think you do have to rely on external resources. For<br/>\nexample, I wrote a Java class that iterates over all files in a directory and<br/>\nits subdirectories. To test it, I need to either have real files and<br/>\ndirecotories, or somehow use mock objects to simulate the files and<br/>\ndirectories. But the class is simple enough that the thing I&#39;m really testing<br/>\nis that I understand correctly how Java&#39;s file I/O stuff works. So if I made a<br/>\nfile I/O mock object, I&#39;d still want to write a test for it which uses real<br/>\nfiles and directories.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy solution is to put really good error messages in my tests. &quot;Couldn&#39;t find<br/>\nfile &#39;abc&#39;. (This test requires that the following directory structure exists:<br/>\n...)&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nErik</div>",
