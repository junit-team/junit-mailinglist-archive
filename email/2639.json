    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-748903547\">I have recently begun concept design of a new (free) application I am<br/>\ncalling TestRunner+. It is going to be a TestRunner for JUnit that has many<br/>\nmore features than the current TestRunner GUI that comes with JUnit. A few<br/>\nof the features I am thinking of right now include: simple test suite<br/>\ncreation, reporting functionality, and of course, running the tests. I am<br/>\nlooking for a couple of developers who are passionate about unit testing and<br/>\nuser interfaces to help me design and implement the first version of this<br/>\napplication. The project is currently hosted on SourceForge so please feel<br/>\nfree to check it out: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sourceforge.net/projects/testrunnerplus/\">http://sourceforge.net/projects/testrunnerplus/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nIt is not my intention to step on the toes of anyone in the JUnit<br/>\ndevelopment project so I would like to invite any of you to contribute as<br/>\nmuch or as little as you like.  I am just a developer who loves to make<br/>\nGUI&#39;s and I saw the need for one in this project... Since I am fairly new to<br/>\nthe testing world, I would imagine that many of you have had a plethora of<br/>\nideas about how the TestRunner could be improved. I would like to tap into<br/>\nthose ideas so that we can make an application that fills your needs. Please<br/>\nsubmit a feature request from the project homepage at source forge or just<br/>\nreply to this email if you have any feature ideas...<br/>\n<br/>\nCurrently I would like to release this application under the BSD license<br/>\ninstead of the IBM license. The BSD license being less restrictive should<br/>\nmake this application even more widely available for whatever use people<br/>\nfind for it (Including IBM). Once the application is mature enough for<br/>\ngeneral consumption, I will send out another email to this group so you can<br/>\ncheck it out.<br/>\n<br/>\nSincerely,<br/>\nChris Eppstein</div>",
