There are some conditions that are required for the\n&gt; contract to hold but which the method either cannot check, cannot check\n&gt; efficiently, or simply elects not to check. In this case, the\n&gt; results are usually given as &#39;undefined&#39;. Checked preconditions on\n&gt; the other hand, can be expected to signal a particular error and generally\n&gt; to exit gracefully. Unit tests can and should verify that violations of\n&gt; checked preconditions do, in fact, fail.\n\nThis is also what I&#39;ve called DBC vs. Defensive Programming.  DBC is simply a\nstatement of the contract (expressed neatly in JUnit tests of course :-)\n-- the &quot;what&quot; must be true in order to gaurantee the results --\n\nIf you put into production code checks for preconditions or postconditions \n(or have that code generated for you), that is &quot;defensive programming&quot;.\n\n-- \nJohn Goodsen           RADSoft / Rapid Software Delivery Specialists\njgoodsen@...             eXtreme Java Internet Consultants\nhttp://www.radsoft.com           Toll Free: 866-RADSOFT (723-7638)\n\n",
