The little code snippets I us=\r\ned as tests didn&#39;t have a return value, so the tests didn&#39;t have a return v=\r\nalue. I never found a compelling reason to add a return value, although I&#39;v=\r\ne seen frameworks that relied heavily on return values from tests.\n\nWhat I =\r\nwonder is if we should relax the constraint that tests cannot return a valu=\r\ne. In the olden days it made sense because you didn&#39;t want someone to just =\r\nhappen to name a method &quot;test...&quot; and have it accidentally run as a test. W=\r\nith @Test, this risk disappears.\n\nI think this would be a trivial change in=\r\nternally to JUnit. I&#39;m not sure how many external tools have the &quot;void only=\r\n&quot; assumption baked in and how many rely on JUnit for validation.\n\nRegards,\n=\r\n\nKent\n\nOn Jan 22, 2010, at 10:17 AM, dmcg123 wrote:\n\n&gt; After over 10 years =\r\nof using JUnit, it has only just struck me that test methods must return vo=\r\nid, but why?\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve just come across an example where a particular test =\r\ndid a lot of work, and I wanted to piggy-back on its final state by calling=\r\n the method from another test.
