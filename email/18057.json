    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1603946036\">I read through Bob&#39;s post below and I find it a really interesting and good<br/>\naproach.<br/>\nWe often talk about convincing management and it can be frustrating indeed<br/>\nbut why do we have to convince /management/?<br/>\nI find it to be more important and /at the very least/ equally hard to<br/>\nconvince fellow /developers/ about the benefits of unittests.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo me unittesting is a development methodology that makes me go faster/feel<br/>\nmore comfortable with my deliveries etc etc.<br/>\nSo, If I&#39;m right about that and beleive in that: why should I ask for<br/>\npermission? If i just start unit-testing and as a result of that deliver<br/>\nbetter code faster, hopefully the better quality will be evident and speak<br/>\nfor itself.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe make so many descisions we don&#39;t ask permission for like &quot;is it ok to<br/>\nremove this dead code?, can I use a factory here?,<br/>\ncan I draw a UML-diagram on the whiteboard?, can I save it in<br/>\ndocumentation?, can I call a designmeeting?&quot; so why is unit-testing<br/>\ndifferent?<br/>\n<br/>\nI think, if you manage to convince your team /first/ then management is as<br/>\ngood as convinced when the results start showing.<br/>\nI think by example is the best way to go, start with your self and influence<br/>\nthose around you.<br/>\n<br/>\n/if/ you are convinced about the benefits of unittesting then /not/ doing<br/>\nunittesting would be unprofessional since you choose not to do it.<br/>\nSo start doing it and infect the others. Don&#39;t have managment inject the<br/>\nvirus into an unwilling team by placing demands on testcoverage etc.<br/>\nThat will rebound in my experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, what do you think? Should we tell the story to our fellow developers<br/>\ninstead of management?<br/>\n/J<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 10/2/06, Bob Runstein &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rrunstein@...\">rrunstein@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Here&#39;s an approach I&#39;ve tried to convince management of the<br/>\n&gt; benefit of object level unit tests. I don&#39;t know if it has worked<br/>\n&gt; yet, and I welcome suggestions to improve it.<br/>\n&gt; The Software Inferno<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It can be difficult to convince people the value of unit tests. As Paul<br/>\n&gt; Wheaton says in his article &quot;Evil Unit Tests&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.javaranch.com/journal/200603/Journal200603.jsp#a1\">http://www.javaranch.com/journal/200603/Journal200603.jsp#a1</a><br/>\n&gt; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.javaranch.com/journal/200603/Journal200603.jsp#a1\">http://www.javaranch.com/journal/200603/Journal200603.jsp#a1</a>&gt; people<br/>\n&gt; are both proud of the fact that they have them and bothered by the fact<br/>\n&gt; that there is so much work required to create and maintain them. As<br/>\n&gt; Paul states, a Unit Test is &quot;The smallest amount of testable code.<br/>\n&gt; Often a single method/function, sans the use of other methods or<br/>\n&gt; classes.&quot; Methods with multiple paths of execution may require<br/>\n&gt; multiple unit tests.<br/>\n&gt; We don&#39;t need that kind of test<br/>\n&gt; Often, opposition to tests at this level is based on the perceived<br/>\n&gt; return on investment: the level of effort to create and run them plus<br/>\n&gt; ongoing maintenance costs vs. what they add to delivering the finished<br/>\n&gt; application. The argument is often that the application as a whole is<br/>\n&gt; being delivered so the JUnit tests must test application functionality,<br/>\n&gt; not objects in isolation. In addition, since the functionality of the<br/>\n&gt; application will be verified by the Functional Tests performed by a test<br/>\n&gt; team and Acceptance Tests witnessed by the Customer, lower level tests<br/>\n&gt; are redundant and omitting them allows more value to be delivered in the<br/>\n&gt; form of more functionality.<br/>\n&gt; An Analogy<br/>\n&gt; In the 1974 production of Irwin Allen&#39;s The Towering Inferno, Paul<br/>\n&gt; Newman played an architect who designed a 138 story glass tower for a<br/>\n&gt; builder, played by William Holden. On the afternoon of the opening<br/>\n&gt; celebration the maintenance staff was testing the backup generators and<br/>\n&gt; a switch in the power room erupted in smoke. The architect was called<br/>\n&gt; and discovered an overload occurred due to the use of the wrong type of<br/>\n&gt; wire. At the same time on an upper floor, an overload in an electrical<br/>\n&gt; switch box started a fire in a utility room. A security guard, played<br/>\n&gt; by O.J. Simpson, read a computer warning from a heat sensor, but the<br/>\n&gt; automatic fire alarm system did not recognize it as a fire and did not<br/>\n&gt; notify the fire department. When he later saw the smoke on a video<br/>\n&gt; camera, he instructed another guard to call the fire department<br/>\n&gt; manually.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; When the fire department arrived, the fire chief, played by Steve<br/>\n&gt; McQueen, asked why the ventilation system did not automatically reverse<br/>\n&gt; to remove the smoke and whether the sprinkler system was working. The<br/>\n&gt; architect informed him that neither was working on the floor with the<br/>\n&gt; fire and he did not know why.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The story revealed that the builder needed to cut $4 million from<br/>\n&gt; construction costs and had demanded that $2 million come from the cost<br/>\n&gt; of the electrical subsystem. In order to accomplish this, the electrical<br/>\n&gt; subcontractor, played by Richard Chamberlain, changed the<br/>\n&gt; architect&#39;s specifications and reduced the robustness of the<br/>\n&gt; electrical system to the minimum that would meet the requirements of the<br/>\n&gt; building code. The other $2 million came from cost reductions in other<br/>\n&gt; subsystems with potentially similar results.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The fire department was unable to successfully fight the fire and the<br/>\n&gt; architect ultimately had to blow up the water tanks on an upper floor to<br/>\n&gt; put it out. Many people lost their lives and the building was<br/>\n&gt; destroyed.<br/>\n&gt; Now how does this relate to software?<br/>\n&gt; The glass tower is our application. Paul Newman is the Software<br/>\n&gt; Architect who designed the system to provide the functionality desired<br/>\n&gt; by William Holden, the Customer. Richard Chamberlain is the Project<br/>\n&gt; Manager who must deliver his portion of the application within the<br/>\n&gt; Customer&#39;s budget. O.J. Simpson is the Operations and Maintenance<br/>\n&gt; team. Steve McQueen is the new developer sent in to fix the problems<br/>\n&gt; with the application, but finds the problems are so pervasive that he<br/>\n&gt; cannot save it and the application has to be rebuilt practically from<br/>\n&gt; scratch.<br/>\n&gt; But the high level tests passed<br/>\n&gt; The building passed its Integration Tests: Electrical, telephone,<br/>\n&gt; elevator, air conditioning, security systems all work.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The building passed its Functional Tests: Residents are living in the<br/>\n&gt; building, business tenants are operating there.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The building passed its Acceptance Tests � The city inspectors<br/>\n&gt; passed all of the systems as meeting the building code.<br/>\n&gt; How could disaster have been prevented?<br/>\n&gt; Many things change once an application is released. Users perform<br/>\n&gt; actions and use values untested prior to release. Problems with<br/>\n&gt; algorithms and logic due to untested corner cases are revealed. New<br/>\n&gt; functionality breaks previously working functionality but no one knows<br/>\n&gt; this because the previous functionality had no low level test to reveal<br/>\n&gt; the breakage. Many of these problems can be tested for with low level<br/>\n&gt; unit tests. Examples from the analogy:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; assertEquals(&quot;highAmperageConduitWire&quot;, switchbox.getWireType);<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; floor.setTemperature(140 degrees);<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; assertTrue(floor.getSprinklerSystem().isWaterFlowing());<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; floor.setSmokePresent(true);<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; assertEquals(&quot;reverse&quot;, ventilation.getDirection());<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; fireAlarmSystem.setHeatSensorStatus(&quot;alarm&quot;);<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; assertTrue(fireAlarmSystem.fireDepartmentNotified());<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Another (shorter) Analogy<br/>\n&gt; Pharaoh wants a new pyramid built, but the straw harvest was poor so the<br/>\n&gt; ratio of straw to mud for the bricks is cut in half. No one tests<br/>\n&gt; whether the new bricks can stand the load. When the fourth level is<br/>\n&gt; reached, the bricks at the base crumble and the pyramid collapses.<br/>\n&gt; Why is software different?<br/>\n&gt; Do automobile manufacturers destroy a car in a crash test without first<br/>\n&gt; testing the characteristics of the bumper and other related components<br/>\n&gt; in isolation from the car?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Does NASA send up the space shuttle to test the heat properties of the<br/>\n&gt; ceramic tiles that line its surface or are the tiles tested on Earth<br/>\n&gt; first?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your thoughts?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Bob<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>",
