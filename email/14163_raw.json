It turned out to be pretty trick=\r\ny to set up, and\nthe tests themselves were hard to read and create.  The ge=\r\nneral\nconsensus is that it&#39;s best to use these class-mocking methods in an\n=\r\nattempt to test while you are refactoring towards an easier to test\ndesign.=\r\n  One way might be to create an interface of your own that is\neither a thin=\r\n wrapper of the target class, or else an interface that\nexposes only the fu=\r\nnctionality that you use - though the difficulty of\nthis varies based on wh=\r\nat the library actually does.  If you take this\napproach, you might be able=\r\n to reduce the direct coupling with the third\nparty library, if (some might=\r\n say when?) you&#39;re required to change\nvendors.\n\nWorking with Legacy Code ha=\r\ns a few sections on exactly this kind of\nissue (separating concerns and dep=\r\nendencies on third party libraries,\nnot jMock with CGLIB).\n\n&gt;The good news =\r\nis I am using Spring Framework in my application. I\n&gt;could use dependency i=\r\nnjection to inject the third party classs into\n&gt;my class. If I don&#39;t have t=\r\nhe interface for the third party, Spring\n&gt;would still inject the implementa=\r\ntion class for me using CGLib instead\n&gt;of dynamic proxy, right?\n\nI&#39;m not su=\r\nre on this one and will have to hand this off to folks with\nsome experience=\r\n with jMock/CGLib with Spring.=20\r\n\n\n\nDaniel Wellman\nU.S. Trust\nPh: (201) 533-6157\n\n\n------------------------=\r\n---------------------------------------------\n\nThe message contains confide=\r\nntial and/or legally privileged\r\n\ninformation and is intended for use by the indicated addressee.=20\r\n\n\n\nIf you are not the intended addressee: (a) any disclosure,\r\n\nreproduction, distribution or action you take because of it is\r\n\nstrictly prohibited; (b) please return the complete message to the\r\n\nsender; and (c) this message is not a solicitation for purchase or\r\n\nsale or an agreement of any kind whatsoever that binds the sender.\n\n-----=\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n",
