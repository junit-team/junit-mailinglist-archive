If you&#39;ve<br/>\nsent an issue, and are just waiting for it to get fixed, you have<br/>\nnothing more to do.  If you&#39;ve sent a pull request in the past, please<br/>\nsend it again, and also link to the commit from the github issue.  If<br/>\nyou&#39;ve tried to send me a message direct through github, please try<br/>\nagain, or, even better, ping me directly at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:david@...\">david@...</a>.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, my apologies.<br/>\n<br/>\n  David Saff</div>",
