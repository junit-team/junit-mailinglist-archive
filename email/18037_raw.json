Later on,\n&gt; when compare is ready to be integrated, then we&#39;d flip that testCompare\n&gt; switch to true, and then we would have an end-to-end test.  How would\n&gt; that do?\n\nI would personally just have two tests in the end: one with the fake, \nand one with the real comparison.  You could disable the real comparison \nwith an @Ignore flag, if you&#39;re using JUnit 4.  Does that make sense in \nyour situation?\n\n    David Saff\n\n",
