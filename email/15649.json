Where I work, we always perform<br/>\n&gt; &gt; builds (and the running of their JUnit tests) for deployment to our<br/>\n&gt; &gt; application servers on dedicated build machines. We never perform<br/>\n&gt; &gt; deployment builds on a developer&#39;s workstation; far too many unknowns<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and differences between developers and what they do to their machines.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The two are not mutually exclusive.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Everybody around me uses an IDE and while they are doing development, they<br/>\n&gt; build everything inside the IDE and when they are ready to check in, they<br/>\n&gt; move to the shell/command prompt and build with ant to make sure they are<br/>\n&gt; not breaking anything.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I *strongly* recommend using an IDE, and not just for JUnit.  Maybe you<br/>\n&gt; think you are productive with your current text editor (emacs, vi, TextEdit,<br/>\n&gt; etc...) but I guarantee that your productivity will shoot up with an IDE.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I wasn&#39;t trying to infer that anyone should completely avoid using an<br/>\nIDE for development. I was stating that it is not necessary to use an<br/>\nIDE to run a test suite. Further, I recommend not using an IDE for<br/>\nrunning test suites. Now, using an IDE for coding and individual unit<br/>\ntests during development can make sense, although I still use mostly<br/>\ntext editors. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nSimon<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nwww.simonpeter.com<br/>\nuab.blogspot.com</div>",
