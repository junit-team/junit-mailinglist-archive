For those that take this\n&gt; approach to development, they would probably want a\n&gt; test for each method.  I believe the eXtreme\n&gt; Programming methodology recommends this, but I am\n&gt; not\n&gt; for sure.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- Vladimir Bossicard &lt;vladimir@...&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;Does anyone have experience using inner classes\n&gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;JUnit in order to test private methods?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Sometimes a class has only one/two public methods,\n&gt; &gt; the internal \n&gt; &gt; &quot;business&quot; is split into several smaller\n&gt; (protected)\n&gt; &gt; methods (like \n&gt; &gt; algorithms).  If you test your public _and_\n&gt; &gt; protected methods, you&#39;re \n&gt; &gt; simply &quot;overtesting&quot; your class (writing more\n&gt; tests\n&gt; &gt; than strictly \n&gt; &gt; necessary).  It&#39;s up to you to decide if you need\n&gt; &gt; these tests.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I like the idea of letting the user decide if\n&gt; he/she\n&gt; &gt; wants to test the \n&gt; &gt; protected methods or not.  Sometimes it&#39;s useful,\n&gt; &gt; sometimes it&#39;s not, \n&gt; &gt; but as I don&#39;t know anything about your classes, I\n&gt; &gt; prefer not to impose \n&gt; &gt; such rules.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;  &gt; If your public methods work, doesn&#39;t that imply\n&gt; &gt; that the \n&gt; &gt; private/protected\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; methods also work?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; It depends how well these tests cover you class&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; code.  Your test \n&gt; &gt; methods may not cover 100% of the code and your\n&gt; &gt; class will still work \n&gt; &gt; fine.  If anther class extends this class and\n&gt; calls\n&gt; &gt; your \n&gt; &gt; private/protected methods with other arguments\n&gt; (and\n&gt; &gt; exercise code you \n&gt; &gt; haven&#39;t tested), your class _may_ not work\n&gt; properly\n&gt; &gt; anymore.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; You can find arguments for not testing public\n&gt; &gt; methods and for testing \n&gt; &gt; them.  The goal is to find bugs as early as\n&gt; possible\n&gt; &gt; (and not to write \n&gt; &gt; tests).  If you&#39;re confident that you write clean\n&gt; &gt; code by only testing \n&gt; &gt; the public methods, fine.  Other developers prefer\n&gt; &gt; to test public and \n&gt; &gt; protected methods.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; It&#39;s a matter of confidence\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; -Vladimir\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; -- \n&gt; &gt; Vladimir Bossicard\n&gt; &gt; www.bossicard.com\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =====\n&gt; Best Regards,\n&gt; Cornellious Mann\n&gt; \n&gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; Yahoo!
