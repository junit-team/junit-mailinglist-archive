Then I used one of the Java class I&#39;d written to grab some data.  I\nknew what was in the database (because I put it there) and therefore I knew\nwhat data should be returned to me.  Basically I just asserted that what I\ngot was indeed what I expected.  However, when your database changes, so\nprobably will your helper classes and then your tests.  So you refactor from\nthe database down.\n\nJames\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: lpsingh [mailto:lpsingh@...]\nSent: 22 August 2002 03:37\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: [junit] &quot;How you tested java classes having embedded SQL in\nit.&quot; ???\n\n\nHi Friends\n\nI am in process of writing EJBs - basically i am writing two separate layers\nof stateless session EJBs one layer will be responsible of holding Business\nlogic and other one for doing RDBMS activities ( I can  use Entity Beans for\nthe same but client don&#39;t wants to use Entity Beans at all  )\n\nI am delegating the RDBMS task to small size java helper classes and using\nthis classes in second layer EJB to perform the RDBMS tasks . These helper\nclasses mainly contains SQL stmts .\n\nAs there is very strong possibility that RDBMS end(Tabels&#92; Field Length\netc )  may go for number of changes which may or may not affect these\nclasses. I want to device a suitable Unit Testing  techniques so that I can\ntest my these helper classes as when required.\n\nPLz guide me by sharing your similar experiences &quot;How you tested java\nclasses having embedded SQL in it.&quot;\n\nregards\nL P\n\n\n\n\n\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\njunit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n \n\nYour use of Yahoo!
