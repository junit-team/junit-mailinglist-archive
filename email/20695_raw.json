But it h=\r\nas advantages.\n\nConsecutive tests which depend on failed tests, are not exe=\r\ncuted, which speeds up the tests. It also increases the information value. =\r\nPeople are not confused with dozens or even hundreds of failed tests when j=\r\nust one or two tests really failed on which most other tests depend. I know=\r\n of situations where there are dozenzs of failed tests (or more) reported b=\r\ny CruiseControl, and noone looks into them until one week before release da=\r\nte. This happens. It makes developers afraid to look into the apparent mess=\r\n. If there would be just one or two failed tests, they would look into it m=\r\nore likely, and sooner.\n\nThe heuristic strategy would not really solve the =\r\nproblem. since it is not equivalent to the dependency specification. It wou=\r\nld still run all tests, but the likelyhood that the first run tests are the=\r\n cause for all the errors would not be very high I think, whereas you could=\r\n trust the dependencies very much if they are set correctly.\n\nDependencies =\r\nare a frequent topic. We have it in OSGI, in issue tracking software, in pr=\r\noject management software, in requirement specifications and in test specif=\r\nications. Why not support it in JUnit tests too?\n\nWell, this is just some q=\r\nuick thoughts about it. This issue alone will certainly not draw people to =\r\nother test frameworks, but it would improve JUnit I think. Noone would be f=\r\norced to use that feature, but I think it would be good, if one could use i=\r\nt with JUnit, even in an coarse way (for example if the dependency &quot;testApp=\r\nlicationServerRuns&quot; passed).\n\nBye,\n\nHans\n\n\n--- On Thu, 7/17/08, Kent Beck &lt;=\r\nkentb@...&gt; wrote:\nFrom: Kent Beck &lt;kentb@...&gt;\nSubject: =\r\nRE: [junit] Does JUnit 4 now support dependencies?\nTo: junit@...=\r\nm\nDate: Thursday, July 17, 2008, 9:28 AM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n            Hans,\n\n=\r\n \n\nI agree that test dependencies are a good idea.
