I need\nto parse legacy product config files with Java.\n\nI now need to decide how such a beast will be unit tested, and I&#39;m wondering\nif anyone else has designed unit tests for exercising Antlr-generated\nparser classes.  I looked around the mail archives and the websites and\ndidn&#39;t find any mention of Antlr anywhere.\n\nI want to create a collection of ascii texts and ensure the parser reads\nall of them properly.  The result from my spike parser is an actual\nobject, not a string, so I guess I need some way of creating an\n&#39;expected result&#39; object, the input text, and comparing the parser&#39;s\nreturned object.\n\nHas anyone done this sort of parser testing before?  Do you have any\nsuggestions or pitfall warnings I should consider before I dig myself\nin too deep?\n\nI&#39;m guessing a single unit test might look something like this:\n\n  public void test1() {\n    DebugConfig expected = new DebugConfig(1,2,3,4,5,6,7);\n    String testInput = &quot;debugLevel { config 1&#92;n ...}&quot;;\n    StringInputStream in = new StringInputStream( testInput );\n    Parser foo = new com.aravox.parser.DebugConfigParser(in);\n    assertEquals( expected.toString(), foo.toString());\n  }\n\nI don&#39;t know if I want to have a bunch of methods like this with \nstrings hard coded, or if I want to somehow store the test input\nand some serialized form of the expected object in a single file.\n\nI&#39;m also not sure if I should create a separate method for each\ntest string, or just make one big method out of it.  I&#39;m thinking\nthe former, so that one failure doesn&#39;t kill all remaining tests.\n\nI lean toward the above  &#39;cause I already know how to do it, even \nif it does mean hardcoding the test inputs as strings in the test code.\n\nAny thoughts?\n\n-- \nJoi Ellis                    Software Engineer\nAravox Technologies          joi@..., gyles19@...\n\nNo matter what we think of Linux versus FreeBSD, etc., the one thing I\nreally like about Linux is that it has Microsoft worried.  Anything\nthat kicks a monopoly in the pants has got to be good for something.\n           - Chris Johnson\n\n\n",
