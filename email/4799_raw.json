Olivier&quot; &lt;dolivier@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; The rule of thumb is that unit tests should be as standalone as possible,\n&gt; and dependencies on external resources such as databases or files should be\n&gt; minimized or eliminated. [...] However, code does touch\n&gt; external resources at some point.  Shouldn&#39;t this be tested, and how?\n&gt;\n&gt; Specifically, I have code that parses a xml catalog file and builds a\n&gt; catalog object structure.  I want to verify that the parsing works\n&gt; correctly.\n&gt; [...]\n&gt; But to do this test I do need some external resource, a simple catalog\n&gt; file.\n\nWhat I do in this case is embed the contents of the file in the test as a\nstring constant and use that for testing.\n\nHowever, sometimes I think you do have to rely on external resources. For\nexample, I wrote a Java class that iterates over all files in a directory and\nits subdirectories. To test it, I need to either have real files and\ndirecotories, or somehow use mock objects to simulate the files and\ndirectories. But the class is simple enough that the thing I&#39;m really testing\nis that I understand correctly how Java&#39;s file I/O stuff works. So if I made a\nfile I/O mock object, I&#39;d still want to write a test for it which uses real\nfiles and directories.\n\nMy solution is to put really good error messages in my tests. &quot;Couldn&#39;t find\nfile &#39;abc&#39;. (This test requires that the following directory structure exists:\n...)&quot;.\n\n\nErik\n\n\n",
