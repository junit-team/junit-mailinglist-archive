Regarding &quot;thousands of test cases&quot;:<br/>\n<br/>\n* Some test coverage is better than none. Don&#39;t &quot;let the perfect be<br/>\n  the enemy of the good&quot;: write some testcases now! &quot;A journey of a<br/>\n  thousand testcases&quot; :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n* I&#39;m suspecting that you are equating testing with unit testing:<br/>\n  since you have thousands of methods you must therefore have<br/>\n  thousands of testcases. Again, some testing is better than none; but<br/>\n  also, consider writing a few functional &quot;scenario&quot; suites that<br/>\n  cover high-value, must-not-break usecases. They will tend to<br/>\n  exercise a lotta underlying code, and they can be written so as to<br/>\n  &quot;spread the cost&quot; of creating real (as opposed to mock) objects. Use<br/>\n  TestSetup to wrapper your suite, create your BigRealObject&#39;s in a<br/>\n  onetime setUp() (or &quot;along the way&quot; during your scenario&#39;s<br/>\n  execution), and each testcase in the suite can use them.<br/>\n<br/>\nA single functional &quot;scenario&quot; will not, of course, be as<br/>\ndiagnostically useful as many unit tests, but at least you will get<br/>\nthat immediate red/green, un/broken feedback:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt; changing code in the future will involve analysis of not only the<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; project code but also the junit test code<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>&quot;J. B. Rainsberger&quot; Wed, 02 Jun 2004 00:54:11 -0400<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; Tests are not overhead; they are the safety net that /enables/ you<br/>\n&gt;&gt; to make changes confidently. They /save/ you time & effort. Without<br/>\n&gt;&gt; tests, how do you know that a change you made didn&#39;t break<br/>\n&gt;&gt; something?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hear, hear! But you probably already, deep down inside, know that ...<br/>\nwhich is why you are currently probably testing MANUALLY. So when<br/>\nyou are comparing relative to the status quo, shouldn&#39;t you be<br/>\nincluding your current test costs? Or are you really not testing AT<br/>\nALL now?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; Bottom line: do you want it to work or not? If you want it to work,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; you have to test it.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hear, hear! But note he does *not* say &quot;unit test&quot;: don&#39;t forget the<br/>\nother types of testing you need to do, and don&#39;t forget that you can<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Chappell, Simon P&quot; Wed, 2 Jun 2004 13:59:30 -0500<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; use JUnit for unit tests and to drive both functional and load tests<br/>\n&gt; (a little pragmatic automation in action! :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Correct! Which is why ...<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Here are my thoughts on the pros and cons of using unit tests:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; cons:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; 1. You actually have to write unit test code.<br/>\n&gt; 2. You have to maintain unit test code.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>* s/unit//. Don&#39;t get hung up on the &quot;Unit&quot; part of &quot;JUnit&quot;--you can<br/>\n  indeed use it to drive many other types of testing.<br/>\n<br/>\n* consider tool assist. Several IDEs, notably Eclipse (and those based<br/>\n  upon it), now provide excellent support for both JUnit and<br/>\n  refactoring. These can take much of the drudgery out of both writing<br/>\n  and maintaining testcases.</div>",
