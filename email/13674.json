You know that only one of them failed (maybe a setUp or another<br/>\ntest) and all the other ones are failing in cascade.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd you also know that you probably only need to fix *1* test to come back<br/>\nto &quot;101 SUCCESSES&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, wouldn&#39;t it be nice if the testing framework told you exactly *which*<br/>\ntest you should look at first?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 100 failures, and when I look at the stack trace it&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; immediately clear where the problem actually is.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You shouldn&#39;t have to look at a stack trace, the testing framework should<br/>\ntell you right away which of the 101 FAILURES is the &quot;real&quot; one.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; Compare this to &quot;1 FAILURE, 100 SKIPS&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Now, *that* is a much more acurate view of what really happened.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; As I said, setUp and test method are one in my view of a test results.<br/>\n&gt; But that may be due to I&#39;m used to JUnit&#39;s way of handling this.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s also my impression.  Just trying to shake out your perception :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; So, assuming I don&#39;t check in code with non-green tests, why <br/>\n&gt; is it important to distinguish between skipped and failed tests?<br/>\n&gt; Doesn&#39;t a skip turn the bar red?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>With TestNG, they are yellow :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s important to distinguish between SKIPPED and FAILED because it gives<br/>\nyou a list of tests to look at in the right order.  TestNG lists them as<br/>\nfollows:<br/>\n<br/>\n- Failed tests (red)<br/>\n- Skipped tests (yellow)<br/>\n- Passed tests (green)<br/>\n<br/>\nStar fixing the failed tests and when you are done, it&#39;s quite likely that<br/>\nthe skipped tests will pass and you&#39;ll be done.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nCédric<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://beust.com/testng\">http://beust.com/testng</a></div>",
