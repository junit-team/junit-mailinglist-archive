At =\r\nthe end you can still plug the output into a GUI to see\nthe results of the =\r\napplication.  Some folks may be already familiar\nwith these APIs, but you c=\r\nan turn that into an opportunity to make the\npoint that the kind of tests y=\r\nou want to write would involve the\ncontent that is sent *via* the APIs, not=\r\n the adherence to the\nstandard.\n\nSomething like, &quot;whenever x is true, a mes=\r\nsage should be sent to lists\nincluding Y, with message contents z&quot;.  Using =\r\na mail API, and making\nassertions about the mail objects created (without s=\r\nending them\nthrough an actual mail server) would drive home the point that =\r\nyou\nwant to test the message *creation* unit, and not necessarily the\nactua=\r\nl round-trip of sending the mail and receiving it.  Once you&#39;ve\nwritten you=\r\nr tests, you can the fire up the full application and see\nit go in a real e=\r\nnough way (assuming you run a little mailserver\nlocally for this).\n\nThis ca=\r\nn be a powerful demonstration of how you can develop code to\nAPIs using uni=\r\nt tests, even before the implementation is ready.  I&#39;ve\nwritten a good chuc=\r\nk of code to in-house APIs that were not ready or\nhad major bugs.\n\nLastly, =\r\nan illuminating question may be this:  What aspects of Unit\nTesting do you =\r\nwant to drive home with this example?  I&#39;m guessing\nyour presentation alrea=\r\ndy has these points, and you want your\ncourseware to reveal them in a prett=\r\ny obvious way.  Here&#39;s some\nguesses and some ideas for &#39;tasks&#39; based on abo=\r\nve:\n\nUnit tests make development easier.\n\nThe initial &#39;task&#39; of getting the=\r\n emails/messages sent through the\nserver is faster because the tests run fa=\r\nster than the email server. \nIf you&#39;re using Jabber, claim that the Jabber =\r\nAPI you&#39;re using is only\ndefined, not implemented.  Heck, that might even b=\r\ne true at the\nmoment!\n \nUnit tests make for easier refactoring.\n\nAfter the =\r\ninitial &#39;task&#39; is done, tell the users they need to localize\nthe content me=\r\nssages, sending them in English and Martian, using a\n&#39;translator&#39; that you =\r\nprovide.  The initial tests are all still valid\nin English, and new ones ar=\r\ne added for Martian.\n\nI think you&#39;ll want to have more than one iteration i=\r\nn your example. \nUnit Tests pay you back one release at a time, and over ti=\r\nme, that&#39;s\nwhere their value is.\n\n-Kevin\n\n\nOn 5/19/05, Elliotte Harold &lt;elh=\r\naro@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; I&#39;m developing a course on test driven develo=\r\npment and JUnit. This\n&gt; course will be taught in a variety of formats and l=\r\nengths ranging from\n&gt; 90-minute seminar to one or two day hands on tutorial=\r\n to a traditional\n&gt; university setting. Obviously how much I can cover and =\r\nhow deep I can go\n&gt; will vary depending on format, length, and audience lev=\r\nel.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m wondering if anyone has any good ideas for examples to use in =\r\nthis\n&gt; course? Ideally I&#39;d like something that&#39;s simple enough to do in a d=\r\nay,\n&gt; but still gives attendees a feeling that they&#39;ve developed something\n=\r\n&gt; real. I could possibly do something involving the Mandelbrot set or\n&gt; cel=\r\nlular automata. However, I&#39;d prefer something a little less\n&gt; mathematical =\r\nif possible.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;d like it to have a GUI component, but at the same time=\r\n I&#39;d like that\n&gt; to show up fairly late in the application, and for the app=\r\nlication to\n&gt; still make sense if there&#39;s not time to cover testing GUIs.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; It should be possible to develop this program on a laptop not connected=\r\n\n&gt; to the Internet. i.e. no databases access, network communications, web\n&gt;=\r\n services, the U.S. tax code, and so forth.\n&gt; \n&gt; Students will have a wide =\r\nvariety of backgrounds so I want to avoid any\n&gt; special knowledge of subjec=\r\nts like XML processing, financial\n&gt; derivatives, quantum physics, and so fo=\r\nrth. I should be able to cover\n&gt; the background necessary to start writing =\r\nthe program in 10 minutes or\n&gt; less.\n&gt; \n&gt; Any ideas?\n&gt; \n&gt; --\n&gt; Elliotte Rus=\r\nty Harold  elharo@...\n&gt; XML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Publ=\r\nished!\n&gt; http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/\n&gt; http://www.amazon.com/e=\r\nxec/obidos/ISBN=3D0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=3Dnosim\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
