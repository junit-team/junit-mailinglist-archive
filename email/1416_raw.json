It the developers don&#39;t want to write tests or keep test\ncases up to date it&#39;s not by mixing prod and test codes in the same\nlocation that you will find a solution.\n\nI would go this way:\n- option #1 with a cvs tree\n- regularly check out the production and test code from cvs into a new\ndirectory and JUnit-test the application.  So you know if prod and test\ncodes are in sync.\n- have metrics to see how well you&#39;ve tested your code (# of tests, # of\nasserts, how well tests cover the code) so you know if developers have\nwritten test code.\n- for the release version, check out the prod code into a new directory,\nbuild the release, give it to the QA.  So you know if developers have\nwritten the right code.\n\nMy 2 cents\n\n-Vladimir\n\n",
