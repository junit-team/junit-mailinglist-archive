I have some fuzzy ideas in this direction,\n&gt; but nothing to make a paper possible yet. The bottom line is\n&gt; understanding the importance of blazing fast programmer tests and of\n&gt; separating PTs from CTs.\n\nWhat I did for Xindice (XML Database) is to separate the tests (unit,\nintegration and stress).  The unit tests run all the time but the integration\ntests run less often.\n\nThe problem is that Xindice provides several drivers (xml-rpc and embed) to\naccess the database.  To test the xml-rpc driver, you have to generate the\nxindice.war file, copy it into your Tomcat&#39;s (e.g.) webapps directory and\nreload it.  If you do this each time you make a tiny modification it&#39;s quite\npainful (and not everyone has a Tomcat server running).  So it was natural to\nseparate the tests according to their complexity.\n\nif you&#39;re interested, you can browse the code\n&lt;http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/xml-xindice/java/tests/&gt;\n\nAnother question: how would you handle a test that is supposed to pass but that\n currently fails because of a problem you can&#39;t fix?  &quot;All the tests must pass\nall the time&quot; is fine if you have control over the entire code, but what if one\nof the libraries you use has a bug?  While other are fixing the library, your\ntests are still broken but it&#39;s still ok to commit new code (because no other\nnew test fail)...\n\nHow can you handle the situation?  Removing the failing test (altering its name\nfor example) is IMO not so clean if you don&#39;t have a mechanism to automatically\nspot them.\n\n-Vladimir\n\r\n--\nVladimir R.
