As I go up the chain, aggregat=\r\ne\n&gt;this/that, the dependencies build & it isn&#39;t a single layer. Maybe it is=\r\n\n&gt;multiple layers.\n\nFine: each layer has its associated tests. I assume tha=\r\nt the tests from a lower layer do not depend on the tests in a higher layer=\r\n; otherwise you have spaghetti and not layers. Expand the idea to &#39;n&#39; layer=\r\ns.\n\n&gt;&gt;      I recommend simply running them separately. If you&#39;re using\n&gt;Ec=\r\nlipse, place\n&gt;them in separate projects.\n&gt;&gt;      You would have three proje=\r\ncts:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;            My Production Code\n&gt;&gt;            My Object-Level Test=\r\ns\n&gt;&gt;            My API-Level Tests\n&gt;\n&gt;Thanks, but...\n&gt;\n&gt;First, you stepped =\r\ninto my pet peeve w/ Eclipse. Run the &quot;all tests&quot; on one\n&gt;project and it ru=\r\nns all the tests on dependent projects. I believe it just\n&gt;walks the classp=\r\nath not the project path. It doesn&#39;t know the difference.\n\nWhy is the Objec=\r\nt-level Tests project in the API-level Tests project&#39;s classpath? Surely ea=\r\nch depends on the Production Code project, but neither depends on the other=\r\n!\n\n&gt;Second, even if I only had a few layers -- and not a complex hierarchy\n=\r\n\nYou need to define &quot;complex hierarchy&quot; here. Is it layered or not layered?=\r\n If it is layered, then the number of layers is irrelevant for the purposes=\r\n of this discussion. Simply generalize to &#39;n&#39;.\n\nIf it is not layered, then =\r\nthe design may have deeper problems that merit your immediate attention.\n\n&gt;=\r\nI&#39;d\n&gt;like the chance to do this within projects not at that level.\n\nWhy? Wh=\r\nat&#39;s the requirement for doing it in one project?\n\n&gt;Two lowest\n&gt;level tests=\r\n might have what I consider a dependency.\n\nThen they are not lowest-level t=\r\nests, by definition: one is lower than the other.\n\n&gt;&gt;      When an API-leve=\r\nl test fails, run the object-level tests to find\n&gt;out what\n&gt;object/method i=\r\nn\n&gt;&gt;      particular failed, then fix the problem.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;      If the API-lev=\r\nel tests fail and the object-level tests don&#39;t fail,\n&gt;then\n&gt;you&#39;re missing =\r\nan object-level\n&gt;&gt;      test, so write it.\n&gt;\n&gt;First thing I do when I see a=\r\n bug is review what tests  I am missing that\n&gt;should have caught it. I agre=\r\ne. I just do it at all levels in the stack,\n&gt;not\n&gt;at two.\n\nAs I say, genera=\r\nlize to &#39;n&#39;.\n\nTake care.\n\n\nJ. B.
