Furthermore, I see them as being<br/>\npackage protected and not exposed (I&#39;d like private, but I hate having<br/>\ninner test classes).  Then I think to myself, if they are package<br/>\nprotected, what should the main function of the object be.  I then come<br/>\nup with the high level API...<br/>\n<br/>\n-          PhotoDirectoryRandomizer(File sourceDir, File destinationDir)<br/>\n<br/>\n-          PhotoDirectoryRandomizer::copy() - void<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nNote: I would, and feel I should, do this before writing any tests.<br/>\nThis does not mean that I started writing any code.  I&#39;m just realizing<br/>\nwhat the API might need to be.  It appears that you started writing<br/>\ntests before realizing the API.   I used to do that too, and found<br/>\nmyself throwing out a lot of my original tests.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThe set of four methods (one being a constructor) is easy to test, and<br/>\neasy to drive with a tool like JSAP (Which I swear on for a Java command<br/>\nline parser).  The constructor would do &quot;no work&quot; but just object<br/>\ninitialization.  Finally the package protected methods can be tested<br/>\nindependently as that is where most of the work occurs.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI would not break it up past that.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nJust my 0.02$.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nBig Mike<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>] On Behalf Of<br/>\nrejohnsoca<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, August 25, 2009 3:32 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [junit] What should I be testing?<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been playing a bit with Test Driven Development, and have read the<br/>\nbook, but now I want to try it out, and am really not sure what to do<br/>\nnext...<br/>\n<br/>\nMy wife loves to show photo slide shows on our living room windows-XP<br/>\ncomputer (have patience, it will come together), but she doesn&#39;t like<br/>\nthat the pictures show up in order. I want to write a small utility to<br/>\nrename the pictures in a controllable way, but prefixing something like <br/>\n&quot;RND&quot;, a set of random digits, and the original name. For example, if<br/>\nthe original was DCIM1001.jpg, I want the class to rename the file to<br/>\n&quot;RND4356332_DCIM1001.jpg&quot;. Windows can then show the photos in a<br/>\n&#39;random&#39; order, but I can still figure out the real photo name, in case<br/>\nsomeone wants a copy. Sounds simple.<br/>\n<br/>\nI want to build this, using TDD.<br/>\nI figure that I need to build tests, and get green bars in eclipse in<br/>\nthe following order:<br/>\n-instantiate my photoRandomizer class<br/>\n-pass it several different paths, and have them be validated (null,<br/>\nempty, non-existing, very long, very short, etc...).<br/>\n<br/>\nthat was easy.<br/>\nbut my next question, is now what?<br/>\nIf I was writing this without TDD, my next step, would have been to<br/>\niterate through the directory, and rename all of the files according to<br/>\nmy scheme. I can&#39;t see an operational advantage to exposing any of this<br/>\nto outside, or make it more than one method, for testing purposes.<br/>\n<br/>\nmaybe what I should do, is have a method that iterates through the<br/>\nappropriate directory, generates a random number, and then passes both<br/>\npieces of information to another method which renames the target file.<br/>\nThis doesn&#39;t seem like a very good way to do it, but then I would at<br/>\nleast be able to test the renaming.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat am I missing?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
