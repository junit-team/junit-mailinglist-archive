My client requested me to <br/>\nupdate the JUnit in the system to version 3.8.1. <br/>\n<br/>\nc:/work/xp/lib/ is the directory which stores the junit.jar.<br/>\nI replace the junit.jar with the newest version of junit.jar I just  <br/>\ndownloaded recently and <br/>\nbuild clean refreshdb deploy are all successful. Only build test is <br/>\ngiving me problem. It seems like all test files cannot be tested at <br/>\nall. All tests are failed.<br/>\n[Junitreport] stated that *alltestfile*.xml is not a valid XML <br/>\ndocument, it is possibly corrupted.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy client told me that JUnit has changed significantly. <br/>\nDo I need to modify anything in build.xml? <br/>\nIs it only replacing the newest junit.jar but no others?<br/>\nWhere can I find a site that shows me the way to update JUnit from <br/>\nolder version to newest version3.8.1? (I am not sure which version I <br/>\nam currently using but I think it is only a bit older that <br/>\n3.8.1,Sorry!) <br/>\n<br/>\nMay be I have missed out something in converting the version. I am <br/>\nnot sure. Can anyone out there please teach me about this issue. <br/>\nYour advises and answers are really appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you so much!<br/>\n<br/>\nBest Regards,<br/>\nwenyew</div>",
