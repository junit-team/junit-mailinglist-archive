Then again,\nwhen\n&gt; I do use EJBs it&#39;s o=\r\nnly to &quot;front&quot; a non-EJB component that can be\n&gt; tested outside of an EJB c=\r\nontainer.  That is, the EJB is strictly\n&gt; conduit.  So I guess I use the ap=\r\nproach you mention for integration\n&gt; testing, if that distinction matters.\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; IMO, Cactus is great, if you absolutely must test from within the\n&gt; con=\r\ntainer.
