I have found it takes to much time t=\r\no\ncreate/destroy the exact same &#39;data set&#39; for each test.  It works fine if=\r\n\nI use setUp and tearDown but I prefer to not take that time during develop=\r\nment\ntest runs.\n\njeb\n\n-- Original Message --\n\n&gt;&gt; setUp and tear down are us=\r\ned for each testcase, but it would be enough\n&gt;&gt; to run them once. There is =\r\nan example in the FAQ but I couldn&#39;t find\n&gt;&gt; out, how to get it running.\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;The rationale of the system is that each test must be independent of other=\r\ns.\n&gt;That&#39;s why setUp() and tearDown() are called for each single test case.=\r\n\n&gt;Why\n&gt;do you want to setUp and tearDown your text fixture only once?\n&gt;\n&gt;An=\r\nyway, if you really want to do this you can do either of these two ugly\n&gt;th=\r\nings:\n&gt;\n&gt;- Write your own testSetUp() method as the first test method in th=\r\ne class\n&gt;and testTearDown() as the last test method in the class. Pretty ug=\r\nly, but\n&gt;it\n&gt;should work. I didn&#39;t try it myself, so I&#39;m not 100% sure it w=\r\nill.\n&gt;\n&gt;- If tearDown() is not really necessary, you can declare a static t=\r\nest\n&gt;fixture and initialize it at the point of definition:\n&gt;\n&gt;public class =\r\nInformationDirectoryTest extends TestCase {\n&gt;\n&gt;  private static SomeClass o=\r\nbj =3D new SomeClass();\n&gt;\n&gt;  &lt;tests&gt;\n&gt;}\n&gt;\n&gt;    ---------------\n&gt;    Paolo P=\r\nerrotta\n&gt;    Bologna, Italy\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;To unsubscribe from this group, send an =\r\nemail to:\n&gt;junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;Your use of Yahoo!
