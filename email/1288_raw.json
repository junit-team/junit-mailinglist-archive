It&#39;s an interesting one. \n\n\n\nI&#39;d like to remind that the reason for the name &quot;unit test&quot; is that it\nrefers to the _scope_ of the components that are being tested, relative to\nthe entire system.  The term &quot;unit testing&quot; should not imply anything too\nprescriptive about the strategies employed to test thoroughly at that scope,\nthough as others have stated, there are guidelines.  In object oriented\nprogramming the &quot;unit&quot; scope is often a class, but is also often a single\nmethod or a cluster of closely related classes.  Truly, a program can be\nbroken into even smaller units - expressions and statements - but everyone\nagrees this is too granular for testing.\n\nAlso recall that the test of whether we&#39;ve tested _enough_ should be code\ncoverage analysis of the component/subsystem/system under test when run\nagainst our test suite.  If testing all the public and protected methods\nalso happens to test your private methods and exception handlers thoroughly,\nthen you&#39;re all set, but you don&#39;t know that unless you have extremely\nsimple applications, or you are doing coverage analysis.  Anyway, it is\nunsafe to conclude a priori that public API testing is all that is needed;\neach situation should determine the tools and strategies used.\n\nI have two examples to offer that may help when you&#39;re in a tough situation\nwhere testing private methods or protected classes.\n\nOne is a private field accessor class, the other is a technique.\n\nI&#39;m attaching the FieldAccessor, which is mainly from Larman and Guthrie&#39;s\nJava 2 performance and idiom book.  Personally, I have yet to need this\nclass for anything, but I thought I&#39;d pass it along.  It&#39;s javadoc&#39;ed.\n\nThe technique is one that I have found useful at least once, which is to put\na public static inner class that extends junit.framework.TestCase in the\nclass under test.  This gives the inner class full access to the outer\nclass&#39;s private methods and members, while allowing the inner class to be an\ninstance of a JUnit test case.  I sent an example of this to this list a few\nweeks ago.  Another handy thing is that when you compile the outer class,\nthe inner test case is produced in a separate class file which can be safely\ndeleted when packaging the outer class for production (because the outer\nclass makes no references to the static inner class).\n\nScott Stirling\nMacromedia\n  \n\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n\nFrom: Jens Andersen\n\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\n\nSent: 5/23/01 4:44 AM\n\nSubject: [junit] How to test protected and private methods/ fields?\n\n\n\nHi all,\n\n\n\nFirst of all I have to mention that I&#39;m pretty novice when it comes to\n\nuse\nJUnit for writing unittests. But I have a question which I hope some of\n\nyou\ncan help me with - it&#39;s regarding testing private/protected methods and\n\nhow\nto organize my test package.\n\n\n\nFirst the package. I have read to articles regarding test (&quot;Junit best\n\npractices&quot; from JavaWorld and &quot;Incremental development with Ant and\n\nJUnit&quot; from developerWorks). In the JBT article Andy Schneider advice you to\n\nkeep\ntests in the same location as the source code. And in the Incremental...\n\narticle Malcolm Davis advice you to make a separate package. Which\n\napproach is the best to use?\n\n\n\nI must admit that I like the idea of making a separate package but then\n\nagain - how do I then test private and protected methods? And if I keep\n\nthe\ntests in the same location as the source code - who do I then test\n\nprivate methods?\n\n\n\nI would very much appreciate if some of you could give me a little\n\nexample\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\n\n\nJ.
