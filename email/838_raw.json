When a test step (an object\nresponsible for executing some segment of a complete test, and which for\ndiscussion here can be considered roughly the equivalent of an instance of\nTestCase) is dispatched, a context for it is placed on a context stack, and\nthe rest is sort of explained below.\n\nThe framework does some other interesting things, such as giving you the\nability to pass composite parameters directly between steps, which the\nframework automatically/transparently causes the step to iterate over. This\nis one of my favorite features because I can create test code whose sole\npurpose is to return a pile of data to use in input variation testing, and\nthen just pass a reference to it as a parameter to a test, and the framework\nwill take care of the rest, including mixing multiple data sources.\n\nAnyway, there&#39;s no reason you couldn&#39;t extend JUnit with some of the above\nideas, (or you could just buy them in a commercial tool :-) )\n\nI presented some of the principles behind Test Mentor&#39;s architecture at\nJavaOne last year. The slides are at\nhttp://jsp.java.sun.com/javaone/javaone2000/event.jsp?eventId=708 and the\ntool is at http://www.silvermark.com\n\n\n\n\n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nMike Silverstein, Lead Architect\tvoice:  (919) 858-8300 x29\nSilverMark, Inc.\t\t\tfax:    (919) 858-8308\n5511 Capital Center Drive\t\tmobile: (919) 669-5906\nSuite 510, Raleigh, NC 27606\t\ttoll free: (888) 588-0668\nhttp://www.silvermark.com\t\tmsilverstein@...\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: kconnor@...

Does it sound like the right\n&gt; thing to do?  The tmp file solution may be more expedient.\n&gt;\n&gt; -Kevin\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In junit@y..., &quot;Michael Silverstein&quot; &lt;msilverstein@s...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; We do the following with Test Mentor (a commercial component testing\n&gt; tool),\n&gt; &gt; but you could probably extend JUnit in a similar way:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; We provide a sort of managed variable scheme within the context of\n&gt; an\n&gt; &gt; executing test, respective of scope (tests in Test Mentor can be\n&gt; recursively\n&gt; &gt; defined, if you like), that&#39;s basically a bunch of\n&gt; java.util.Hashtables,\n&gt; &gt; each tied to a particular scoping level. These Hashtable values are\n&gt; &gt; accessible by APIs within the tool that resolve the correct value,\n&gt; depending\n&gt; &gt; on the context of the executing test. The APIs  make it pretty\n&gt; transparent,\n&gt; &gt; relying mostly on a test execution context stack that tracks\n&gt; whichever\n&gt; &gt; Hashtable should be active at the moment. The APIs (which any test\n&gt; inherits)\n&gt; &gt; look something like getLocalVar(name) and setLocalVar(name,value).\n&gt; So you\n&gt; &gt; could instantiate/execute a test that sets variables, which then\n&gt; &gt; instantiates/exeuctes another test within it that may or may not set\n&gt; &gt; variables with the same name, and the tool will handle variable name\n&gt; scope\n&gt; &gt; resolution automatically.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n&gt; &gt; Mike Silverstein, Lead Architect\tvoice:  (919) 858-8300 x29\n&gt; &gt; SilverMark, Inc.\t\t\tfax:    (919) 858-8308\n&gt; &gt; 5511 Capital Center Drive\t\tmobile: (919) 669-5906\n&gt; &gt; Suite 510, Raleigh, NC 27606\t\ttoll free: (888) 588-0668\n&gt; &gt; http://www.silvermark.com\t\tmsilverstein@s...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: kconnor@i...
