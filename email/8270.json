I&#39;ve written<br/>\na TestCase class and it has one testXXX() method and a tearDown()<br/>\noverride.  The tearDown() override does its own stuff and then calls<br/>\nsuper.tearDown().<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem is that both the testXXX() method I wrote and the<br/>\ntearDown() method threw exceptions, and in fact, the error in<br/>\ntestXXX() was <br/>\nresponsible for the failure of tearDown().  (I know, it wasn&#39;t the most<br/>\nbulletproof test script, but it is what it is).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I see that might be a JUnit bug is that the error in tearDown()<br/>\ncompletely masked any output of the error thrown by testXXX(), so I<br/>\nwas led to the erroneous conclusion that testXXX() was succeeding. <br/>\nWhen I commented out the code in tearDown() that was throwing, then<br/>\nand only then could I see the error in testXXX().  <br/>\n<br/>\nIs this a feature of JUnit or a bug?</div>",
