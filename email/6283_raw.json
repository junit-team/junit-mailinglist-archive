TextEdit ha=\r\ns a similar template feature (for any kind of file, I\nthink).  Have you don=\r\ne any comparison there?\n\n&gt; Other tools don&#39;t support this very well and I d=\r\non&#39;t understand why-\n&gt; I&#39;m mainly thinking about Eclipse and IntelliJ, but =\r\noften when I say \n&gt; these IDEs don&#39;t do something, I get corrected ;).\n\nEcl=\r\nipse has nice support for right-clicking on a file to create a JUnit\nTestCa=\r\nse or suite.  And the built-in test runner was provided by Erich\nGamma, who=\r\n works for OTI (the IBM subsidiary behind Eclipse).  But\nthat&#39;s not the sam=\r\ne as what you&#39;re talking about.  Eclipse has built-in\nsupport for customiza=\r\nble and extensible templates for lots of stuff like\nJavadoc elements, flow =\r\ncontrol and iteration constructs, etc. but not\nfile-level templates.  Until=\r\n you pointed it out, I didn&#39;t realize it,\nbut it seems like you are correct=\r\n.  I mean, Eclipse is extremely\nextensible, so someone could implement this=\r\n, but I don&#39;t see anything\nlike it in the default platform or Java Dev Tool=\r\ns.  Closest thing would\nbe to implement a new wizard for each type of templ=\r\nate.\n\nNetBeans has a similar &quot;create JUnit TestCase&quot; feature, which is even=\r\n\nquicker to use than Eclipse&#39;s.  But NetBeans&#39;, by default, imports a\nNetBe=\r\nans package into your TestCase and makes your TestCase extend their\nown NBT=\r\nestCase.  But that behavior can be fixed by modifying the\nTestCase preferen=\r\nces.\n \n&gt; One think I don&#39;t like about the way Junit does test suites, aside=\r\n\n&gt; from the effort of remembering to add a test to a suite, is that it \n&gt; d=\r\nrives the dependencies downward. AllTests at the top of the tree \n&gt; has to =\r\nknow about all the tests or testsuites below it.\n\nYes, this is a pain.  I p=\r\nrefer to use Ant&#39;s &lt;batch/&gt; JUnit test runner,\nwhich can make nice ASCII/XM=\r\nL/HTML (via &lt;junitreport/&gt; task) reports and\nhas a test collector that pick=\r\ns up test cases automatically and allows\nfiltering of test cases by name.\n =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; 3) Do you prefer using tools for unit tests creation?\n&gt; \n&gt; Only for bl=\r\nowing out the test boilerplate.\n\nI agree.  Minimal and preferably customiza=\r\nble tes case generation is\nmost helpful.\n\nScott Stirling\n\n\n\n",
