If all &quot;complicated&quot; <br/>\nwould be like that we can get 200% test coverage...<br/>\n<br/>\n   You came to the right conclusion that SQLException is an <br/>\nunrecoverable one and should be wrapped into a runtime exception. You <br/>\neven have slight improvement there with a common exception handler. <br/>\nThere is only one step left before template pattern, so you can have <br/>\nexactly one place where that exception handler would be used. Take a <br/>\nlook at JDBC packages in a Spring framework and either copy its design <br/>\nor use as is.<br/>\n<br/>\n   Pretty much the same pattern can be applied to other common API&#39;s and <br/>\nmany already in a very same Spring framework, so you won&#39;t have to <br/>\ninvent the wheel.<br/>\n<br/>\n   As I said, there are really good ways to make code more testable.<br/>\n<br/>\n   regards,<br/>\n   Eugene<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJ.

Can you please share your thoughts?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sure: 100% line/branch coverage is impossible to achieve. Even if it <br/>\n&gt; were possible, it&#39;s not worth the effort. Example:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; JDBC driver throws SQLException, which is checked. In my code, I have to <br/>\n&gt; do this:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; try {<br/>\n&gt;      useJdbcDriver();<br/>\n&gt; }<br/>\n&gt; catch (SQLException e) {<br/>\n&gt;      // What to do here?<br/>\n&gt; }<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Well, my default checked exception handler is this:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; try {<br/>\n&gt;      useJdbcDriver();<br/>\n&gt; }<br/>\n&gt; catch (SQLException wrapped) {<br/>\n&gt;      throw new RuntimeException(<br/>\n&gt;          &quot;Something went wrong when I used the database&quot;, wrapped);<br/>\n&gt; }<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; There are two problems with this:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 1. It takes an obscene amount of effort to simulate (or recreate) the <br/>\n&gt; conditions under which the JDBC driver throws an SQLException.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The vast, vast majority of the time, I don&#39;t handle those exceptions <br/>\n&gt; anyway, but rather pass them up the chain. To avoid coupling myself to <br/>\n&gt; my caller, I turn the checked exception into an unchecked one.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 2. Java /forces/ me to duplicate that exception handler everywhere <br/>\n&gt; throughout my code, although I /could/ get a little better with<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;      ExceptionHandler.shush(<br/>\n&gt;          &quot;Something went wrong when I used the database&quot;, shushed);<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Still, I have to duplicate /that/ everywhere, but I certainly don&#39;t need <br/>\n&gt; to test it everywhere I use it. The only thing that changes is the <br/>\n&gt; explanation message, and I never write code that depends on that text in <br/>\n&gt; any meaningful way.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Both of these make it unusually expensive to test-drive this code, <br/>\n&gt; compared to the benefit I get from test-driving it. As a result, I have <br/>\n&gt; judged that it&#39;s not worth the effort, so I don&#39;t do it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I hope that helps. </span></blockquote></div>",
