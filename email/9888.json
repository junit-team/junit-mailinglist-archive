Whenever I find it difficult to write a test for a <br/>\n&gt; method,<br/>\n&gt; I<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; ask myself whether it&#39;s the method&#39;s fault.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;     As a newbie to junit I&#39;m still trying to understand how to judge if when<br/>\n&gt; its &#39;difficult&#39; to write a test for a method. My question was sparked<br/>\n&gt; because I was in what I would call a laborous position - multiple code paths<br/>\n&gt; so multiple test cases. I had 30 test cases for one method, amounting to 300<br/>\n&gt; lines of code. Is this tedious or difficult. In JUnit world, does tedious ==<br/>\n&gt; difficult?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think &quot;tedious == difficult&quot; answers false, so tedium is not as strong <br/>\na warning signal as difficulty; however it /is/ a warning signal.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to learn how to make those judgments, then I believe you <br/>\nhave to practice. Presumably your method is structured like this.<br/>\n<br/>\nbigMethod:<br/>\n     someCode<br/>\n     if (condition)<br/>\n         truePart<br/>\n     else<br/>\n         falsePart<br/>\n     end<br/>\n     moreCode<br/>\nend<br/>\n<br/>\nIn other words, let&#39;s say there&#39;s a top-level &quot;if&quot; statement.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo make bigMethod look exactly like the above. Extract everything else <br/>\ninto methods. Now, can you test someCode, truePart, falsePart and <br/>\nmoreCode on their own? If not, apply the same refactoring again, and <br/>\nagain, and again... eventually you&#39;ll see how you could fix the testing <br/>\ntedium with refactoring.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your testing tedium is due to wanting to run the same test with 100 <br/>\ndifferent sets of data, you need better tests (Parameterized Test Case). <br/>\nIf your testing tedium is due to high cyclomatic complexity, you need <br/>\nbetter production code (refactor, extract method, move method, and so on).<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ.
