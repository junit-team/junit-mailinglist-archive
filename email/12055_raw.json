I have downloaded a\nfew smaller ones and will take on a few larger ones later (my modem\nconnection is a little slow for everything  beyond 2MB or so). As soon\nas possible - but that may take some time - I&#39;ll build and test and\ncover them :-)\n\nThanks also for the general remarks on coverage - I have had some\nexperience with this myself long ago, when I wrote a coverage\nprecompiler - source level - for C++ about 10 years ago and forced a\nmedium-sized project to go to 100% branch coverage. I also read Brian\nMarick&#39;s book and a few of his articles back then. My raw gut feeling is\nthat there is more to code coverage than an arbitrary number (&quot;85%&quot;; or\n&quot;current level is 37%&quot;) and/or Marick&#39;s concept of &quot;manual hot spot\ndetection&quot; (if I remember it correctly; which is important!) and/or\nimpossible goals (the claim - also still mine - &quot;only 100% feasible(!? -\nhow to determine?) is ok&quot;) and/or statistics showing how much/how little\ncorrelation there is between some sort and level of code coverage and\nfunctional correctness (does anyone know recent research/pracitcal\nexperience of such statistics - i.e., what is [some specific] coverage\n&quot;worth&quot; on the &quot;TCO curve of quality&quot;, so-to-speak?). \n\nWorking in real teams with real time-pressure and real chaos and real\nerrors (also mine - I&#39;m oftentimes a lazy guy who falls for &quot;code first\nand then dont test&quot; the first moment I get under pressure ...), I&#39;m\nstill (or again - after those 10 years) looking for the place where XP\nand TDD concepts on the one hand; and code coverage on the other fall in\nsync ... I also have a rough idea, but it&#39;s too early to talk about it -\nI&#39;ll first try it out on my unsuspecting team ;-)\n\nRegards\nHarald\n\n\n",
