However, I&#39;m still curious to know...<br/>\n<br/>\nI think we&#39;re ready to cut a 4.10 beta 1 release from head, including<br/>\na raft of bug fixes, most notably the fix in the contents of junit-dep<br/>\nas released to maven.  Of those of you who plan on being beta-testers:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Is there anyone who plans to download the jar directly from github<br/>\nfor testing?<br/>\n2) Is there anyone who plans to set the junit version in their pom to<br/>\n4.10-SNAPSHOT, and add <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://oss.sonatype.org/content/groups/public\">https://oss.sonatype.org/content/groups/public</a><br/>\nas a snapshot repository, in order to test through maven?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m happy to support both beta-release paths if it turns out people<br/>\nare using both.<br/>\n<br/>\n   David Saff</div>",
