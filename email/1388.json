However I think I would be reluctant to <br/>\n&gt; change the way my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; code was implemented just so that I could test it, as some <br/>\n&gt; of the other<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; My experience is different. I&#39;ve found that changing my <br/>\n&gt; coding style to make it testable (which doesn&#39;t mean just <br/>\n&gt; putting in lots of unnecessary accessors) also makes it <br/>\n&gt; better. The more I apply this to different targets, such as <br/>\n&gt; shell scripts, the more I&#39;m convinced. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Steve<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I concur.  I&#39;ve found that testable code exhibits certain composable <br/>\n&gt; properties that foster interface-based design.  For example, the <br/>\n&gt; assembly of a few simple objects to perform a more complex <br/>\n&gt; task allows <br/>\n&gt; any of the objects to be mocked.  In turn, by refactoring designs to <br/>\n&gt; extract complex static relationships into interface-based <br/>\n&gt; compositions, <br/>\n&gt; the design becomes more open to extension, but closed to <br/>\n&gt; modification. <br/>\n&gt; So, I&#39;ll up the ante and claim that designs may change as a <br/>\n&gt; side effect <br/>\n&gt; of writing tests.  This is the essence of test-first design.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Mike<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If these are indeed compex relationships then it may well be the case that<br/>\nrefactoring the code is an appropriate course of action. Not all<br/>\nrelationships *are* complex! In my experience it is better to keep the code<br/>\nsimple where ever possible. I might understand what is going on - but my<br/>\ncode maintanence successors may not.<br/>\n<br/>\nChanging the code to suit your tests could quite easily cause your code to<br/>\nhave a stitled and difficult to read style - especially to less experienced<br/>\ncoders. My goal is always clarity in coding style. <br/>\n<br/>\nMatt</div>",
