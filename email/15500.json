You both completely understood my <br/>\nsituation.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, I am a top-down design sorta guy. Especially as in most projects I <br/>\nwork on there is very little upfront technical design (no UML, <br/>\nRequirements specs, etc). Thats why i liked TDD, I could start from the <br/>\n&#39;front-end&#39; and the design just fell out natuarlly because I was always <br/>\nthinking about the use of the code.<br/>\n<br/>\nJB calls it &quot;Story Test-Driven Development&quot;. Apart from the obvious Kent<br/>\n<br/>\nBeck/XP books is their any more info on this?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again,<br/>\n<br/>\nRakesh<br/>\n<br/>\nJ. B.

Suddenly i was writing code to satisfy<br/>\n&gt;&gt;my tests (a client) and things seemed a lot more natural. Productivity<br/>\n&gt;&gt;increased and i built only what i needed. I think this is how<br/>\n&gt;&gt;development should happen (I have since hit a wall with testing<br/>\n&gt;&gt;non-POJOs that I am still grappling with).<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;However, the tests that result from TDD are NOT unti tests.

Have i misunderstood unit testing<br/>\n&gt;&gt;and TDD?<br/>\n&gt;&gt;    <br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;It sounds like your TDD tests were more of &quot;integration tests&quot; than of <br/>\n&gt;&quot;unit tests&quot;. I&#39;ll guess that you like to take a top-down approach to <br/>\n&gt;design. If you do, then take care to examine how many different objects<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;participate in a test. If it&#39;s more than one, then you should consider <br/>\n&gt;what behavior you need from each object, then test-driving (performing <br/>\n&gt;TDD on) each object in isolation. When you think you&#39;ve built the <br/>\n&gt;behavior you need from each object, you can put them together to pass <br/>\n&gt;the original integration test you wrote.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;This is very close to Story Test-Driven Development, so you haven&#39;t <br/>\n&gt;misunderstood TDD, but rather have noticed that one can practise TDD at<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;different levels of the design.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nYAHOO!
