Does anyone know why \n&gt; (time, philosophy,\n&gt; etc ) ?\n\nMy guess would be philosophy. (That DOES sound like a song title, doesn&#39;t\nit? :-)\n\nIf you can only test your class by testing the output it generates on a\nfilesystem, its design could be improved. It should probably take an\nOutputStream and write there. You can then compare the contents of the\nOutputStream to your expected result.\n\nIt&#39;s all about keeping implementation details out of the public interface. A\nfile representation is an implementation detail - a stream is not. \n\nOne of the benefits you reap if you implement your classes that way is that\nyou can add MD5 checksums, compression, etc without any redesign. If your\nclass is writing directly to a file, you would have to modify that class to\nachieve the same.\n\nOf course, that&#39;s only a guess - I could be completely off :-)\n\n&gt; \n&gt; One of the most common situations for me in testing tools is \n&gt; the need to\n&gt; test a given file output against a canonical output file.\n\nThat is definitely true for acceptance tests. Unit tests should not pose\nthat problem.\n\n\nBye,\n  Robert\n\n",
