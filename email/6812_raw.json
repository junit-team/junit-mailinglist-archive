Also, like I said, I want to say &quot;ConfigManager is not valid \n&gt;until its state (the other objects it loads) has also been \n&gt;successfully created&quot;.  \n\nIs there no object in your system that can hold a reference to\nConfigManager and make it available to the rest of the system?\n\n&gt;REGARDING:  Your answer:\n&gt;I did not originally do what you suggested with the second public \n&gt;constructor because other members of my team will see it and use it \n&gt;if they dont know better.  I feel its like &quot;changing the house to fit \n&gt;the door&quot;.\n\nThat&#39;s understandable. Read my other words on the topic: first get it\nto work, then refactor to what you really want.\n\n&gt;I will now read the article you suggested\n\nThanks.\n\n\nJ. B.
