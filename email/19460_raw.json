B=\r\noundary Conditions. \nTesting a string for particular content (isAlphaNumeri=\r\nc,\nmeetsPasswordStrengthRule, etc.).\n\nThoughts?  Or does J.B. already have =\r\na site out there, to support the\nJUnit Recipes book, that would have these =\r\nsamples?\n\nDianne\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;sares140282&quot; &lt;sares140282@=\r\n...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi\n&gt; \n&gt; can u send me, the example file of junit. using tes=\r\ntsuite, boundary \n&gt; test conditions and java program also.\n&gt; \n&gt; by\n&gt; senthi=\r\nl\n&gt;\n\n\n\n",
