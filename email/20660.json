Especially since my remote test env needs to be on Windows  :-S<br/>\n(Background: I want to use WebDriver to test our Webapps, and that<br/>\ninvolves IE...).<br/>\nAnyway, though I have previously written that GridGain seems to be<br/>\noverengineered, I have given it a try nethertheless and I am<br/>\npleasantly (!) surprised. It is very easy to setup and you can run<br/>\nyour Unit tests on any node in the grid nearly without any code change<br/>\nto your existing Testsuites- absolutely cool.<br/>\nSo anyone in need of running JUnit tests remotely, give GridGain a try.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest regards,<br/>\nLudwig<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Nat Pryce&quot; &lt;nat.pryce@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; How about ssh?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You can use sftp to copy the files to the remote machine and then ssh<br/>\n&gt; to run ant.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Or, to avoid the sftp stem, use NFS to share the drive on the build<br/>\n&gt; machine with the remote machine.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --Nat<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 2008/7/4 ludwig.adam &lt;ladam@...&gt;:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hi,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; i am currently looking for the a solution to remotely run JUnit tests<br/>\n&gt; &gt; from our cruise control (cruise control runs ant with JUnit, tests<br/>\n&gt; &gt; should run on remote machine).<br/>\n&gt; &gt; After searching for a while I found that the Eclipse JUnit integration<br/>\n&gt; &gt; features this but I didn&#39;t find a standalone-version. In addition<br/>\n&gt; &gt; GridGain (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.gridgain.com/)\">http://www.gridgain.com/)</a> seems also to support this, but is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; too overengineered for my case. Do you know any alternatives / good<br/>\n&gt; &gt; solutions for this scenario?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Thanks & Best regards,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Ludwig </span></blockquote></div>",
