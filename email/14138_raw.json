It needs to be public because\n&gt;&gt; it is used polymorphically. It should not be part of the\n&gt;&gt; API. One fix is to create a separate interface just for\n&gt;&gt; that one method. Another is to add a warning to the javadoc.\n\n--- Elliotte Harold &lt;elharo@m...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; I&#39;m not sure I understand the actual bug here. (Does anyone\n&gt; have a URL for the actual description of the bug, not just\n&gt; the newsgroup?) [...]\n\nThere is no official bug report.  The posts here, and in \nnews:comp.software.extreme-programming are the only documentation.\n\nhttp://groups-beta.google.com/group/comp.software.extreme-\nprogramming/tree/browse_frm/thread/abb6e38f1e302b72/faf1514df7169195?\nrnum=1&hl=en&_done=%2Fgroup%2Fcomp.software.extreme-programming%\n2Fbrowse_frm%2Fthread%2Fabb6e38f1e302b72%2Fc7acf271635c13e2%3Fhl%\n3Den%26#doc_faf1514df7169195\n-&gt;\nhttp://tinyurl.com/e2zpy\n\n\n&gt; [...] Most Java code exposes far more methods as public\n&gt; than it should. If indeed this method should not be part\n&gt; of the API, then it should not be public. [...]\n\nYup.  But it&#39;s defined in an &#39;interface&#39;, so it can be used \npolymorphically.  Being part of an interface, it must be public.  \nSo...  One could define another interface, as Kent Beck suggested.  \nOr one could introduce an abstract base class as a parent to Money \nand MoneyBag.  Or one could pitch the double-dispatch &quot;add&quot; code, \nand do something else.  Maybe there should be a &quot;money bag&quot; \ninterface, to allow for alternate implementations of MoneyBag?\n\n&gt; Often overuse of public reflects a failure to use package\n&gt; protected methods, often because the application has been\n&gt; divided into packages and yet the subpackages need to be\n&gt; able to access the internal parts of the superpackages.\n\nYes.  But Money and MoneyBag are in the same package.  I think this \nsuggests that they should have a common base class, for &#39;protected&#39; \nimplementation details.\n\n\nConclusion:\nI suppose it could be fixed.  But it&#39;s sample code, so I find it \nhard to get really excited about it.\n\n\n\n",
