Below you can =\r\nsee the original\n&gt; link.\n&gt;\n&gt; We use junit for integration tests. The tests =\r\nare being run in Eclipse and\n&gt; Jenkins.\n&gt;\n&gt; Now i would like to log all jun=\r\nit test run results to a database for easy\n&gt; reporting (i want to log test =\r\nclass / method name, environment, duration and\n&gt; success). I had thought ab=\r\nout parsing the junit result xmls but to log it\n&gt; directly to a database so=\r\nunds good to me, too. It sounds intrusive but also\n&gt; pretty elegant.\n&gt;\n&gt; No=\r\nrmally we just annotate a test method with the @Test annotation and\n&gt; voila=\r\n, we have our junit test method.\n&gt;\n&gt; That means we have no additional frame=\r\nwork around junit and i want to keep\n&gt; it that way!\n&gt; I fear that means tha=\r\nt if i want to implement that kind of logging i will\n&gt; probably have to hac=\r\nk into junit.\n&gt;\n&gt; Has anybody done so and can give advice if that works nic=\r\nely? Maybe you\n&gt; have an idea on how/where to place the hook in junit. Or a=\r\nre there easier\n&gt; approaches to my problem?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks!\n&gt;\n&gt; edit: To clarif=\r\ny, we already have junit test results of single test runs.\n&gt; You can get th=\r\nem out of eclipse (export junit result) or out of jenkins.\n&gt; Running our ju=\r\nnit test suites in Jenkins also allows us to track test\n&gt; failure rates of =\r\ntest suites over time. It shows you a nice chart that\n&gt; tracks how many tes=\r\nts of passed over time. In each jenkins build you can see\n&gt; which tests pas=\r\nsed, also in comparison to the last run. We need a bit more.\n&gt; We want to b=\r\ne able to analyse the performance (duration) of certain\n&gt; testcases over ti=\r\nme, over multiple runs, maybe also how they behave\n&gt; differently in differe=\r\nnt environments. Extract trends. Do some data mining.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; http://stackove=\r\nrflow.com/questions/5722431/how-to-log-junit-test-run-results-to-a-database=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; cheers!\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed=\r\n]\n\n\n",
