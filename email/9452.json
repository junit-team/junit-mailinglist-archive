If the code simply said what the<br/>\n&gt; comments say, then they *would* be both the comments and the logic.

In most cases, you have to spell<br/>\nout why you are doing what you are doing.  Otherwise, whatever poor soul<br/>\ncomes along a year or two later to fix your code is going to be lost.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;m not saying that I don&#39;t know how to write printf() or use the<br/>\n&gt; debugger. I just choose not to when I can write tests instead. It&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; clear to me that tests provide the same benefits as printf() *and*<br/>\n&gt; preserve what I have learn for posterity. &quot;It&#39;s no good to anyone else<br/>\n&gt; in your head, Mozart. Write it down.&quot; (paraphrase of Salieri from the<br/>\n&gt; film Amadeus.)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Take your own advice.  Don&#39;t keep it in your head.
