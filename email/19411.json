I mean, I have a framework that uses xml configuration<br/>\n&gt; and XPATH to make some assertion tests from our server, and I would<br/>\n&gt; like to run them using junit, as it would be easier to generate<br/>\n&gt; reports and so on. The problem is that the tests are dinamic and<br/>\n&gt; depend on an external configuration file. So if i do asserts inside a<br/>\n&gt; loop it would leave the method on the first fail/error, is there any<br/>\n&gt; way to store all the asserts and process them afterwards? what would<br/>\n&gt; you suggest?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Chapter 5 (I believe) of the book _JUnit Recipes_ (&quot;Working with test <br/>\ndata&quot;) would help you here. Scott Stirling wrote about this quite deeply.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy first choice is for each test to provide its own configuration data <br/>\nby creating a different Configuration object, instead of an XML <br/>\ndocument. This is like Spring framework, which allows configuration in <br/>\nXML and configuration in Java.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I can&#39;t do this easily, I create a test/data/configuration <br/>\ndirectory in my project with a different configuration file for each <br/>\ntest. You still need to point your code to the configuration file for <br/>\neach test, but at least all the test data is in one directory and you <br/>\ncan name each file to match the name of the test method.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Parameterized Test Case is another choice, depending on how many <br/>\nassertions you need to make and how many different inputs there are. If <br/>\nyou have just one input (the configuration file path) and a few outputs <br/>\nto check, try it; but if the expected results are very different for <br/>\neach test, then I recommend simply writing the tests and extracting the <br/>\ncommon code into methods (usually setUp() in JUnit 3 or a @Before method <br/>\nin JUnit 4).<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ.
