That&#39;s why I\n&gt; don&#39;t have specific advice for you, except to make the threading\n&gt; pluggable so that you can test your logic in a single-threaded mode\n&gt; first. I&#39;d hate to be looking for logic and threading problems together.\n\nYes, debugging multi-threaded stuff is hard. We used to let Operating \nSystems developers do it, and pay them big bucks.\n\nBut nearly all of my Java development is in a multi-threaded world.\nI&#39;m surprized that you don&#39;t run into it. Nearly every thing I do\nis run as a servlet, so you have to be thread safe. And all of my \nsystems have assorted daemons and background threads, which implement \nsimple things like WorkingSetCaches or do long things like\ntalking to radios that have to be dispatched asynchronously.\n\nAnd the AJAX folks are pushing the multi-threaded model even harder,\nwith many more server clanks, and more chances for the server to get \nwrapped arround the axel with thread issues.\n\n-- \nPat Farrell\nhttp://www.pfarrell.com/\n\n\n",
