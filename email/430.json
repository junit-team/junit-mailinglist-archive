I prefer to think in terms of the behavior of objects<br/>\nand methods, not in terms of (procedural) code branches.<br/>\n<br/>\nHis first suggestion was to embed (in every method!) debug code that writes<br/>\nto a log and indicates that the method was executed.  I do not want to<br/>\npollute my code with piles of:<br/>\n<br/>\nif (debug_mode) { SomeGlobalLogFile.write(&quot;this method happened&quot;) }<br/>\n<br/>\nAny ideas on how to assure him that exhaustive testing of every outcome of<br/>\nevery public method will prove the system is working right?<br/>\n<br/>\n--  Norm</div>",
