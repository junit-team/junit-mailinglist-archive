I imagine that you could probably write \n&gt; &gt; something to=\r\n do this yourself as quickly as extracting the\ninteresting \n&gt; &gt; parts from =\r\nmy code.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Can you give a few details about what you would be lookin=\r\ng for in a \n&gt; &gt; trend analysis?  Thanks,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;     David Saff\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; k=\r\np.berg wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;Hi all,\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;I know, JUnit &#39;unit&#39; tests sho=\r\nuld always pass ;-) But we are using the\n&gt; &gt;&gt;JUnit framework to write integ=\r\nration and systemtests as well. So from\n&gt; &gt;&gt;time to time, in this area some=\r\nthing may go wrong. Therefore I&#39;m\n&gt; &gt;&gt;looking for a tool, that generates a =\r\nreport showing only the\n&gt; &gt;&gt;differences between current and last JUnit repo=\r\nrt - which failing\n&gt; &gt;&gt;tests were fixed, which tests stopped to pass, which=\r\n tests were added\n&gt; &gt;&gt;and which removed. Additionaly a test trend analysis =\r\nshould be\n&gt; &gt;&gt;possible.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;I know, parsing the XML junitreport output=\r\n and generating the info,\n&gt; &gt;&gt;e.g., with the help of a database, would be p=\r\nossible. But is anyone\n&gt; &gt;&gt;aware of an existing tool or open source project=\r\n that can help in this\n&gt; &gt;&gt;direction?\n&gt;\n\n\nIs there such a tool for eclipse/=\r\nperforce?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
