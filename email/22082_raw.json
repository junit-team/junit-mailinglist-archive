Please allow me to\n&gt; illustrate my question w=\r\nith a simple example.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ve got a class called Coordinate that represent=\r\ns a point in a 3D\n&gt; coordinate system. I&#39;ve overloaded the toString method =\r\nof this class\n&gt; to write out the X, Y, and Z values of the coordinate in a =\r\nsimple\n&gt; String. Now I want to test my toString method using JUnit.\n&gt;\n&gt; If =\r\nthe Coordinate.toString test method fails (because the string was\n&gt; not con=\r\nstructed in the correct format) I would like to provide the\n&gt; programmer ru=\r\nnning the test with a copy of the incorrect string, since\n&gt; it provides val=\r\nuable clues about what is broken with the method under\n&gt; test. I typically =\r\ndo this by placing System.err.println statements in\n&gt; my test method. Howev=\r\ner, I realize that using System.err.println isn&#39;t\n&gt; the most portable or el=\r\negant way to provide this information to the\n&gt; programmer executing the tes=\r\nt.\n&gt;\n&gt; What I really want is a GUI that allows the programmer to select a\n&gt;=\r\n failed test from a list of failed tests, and then to view supplemental\n&gt; t=\r\nest data I provide him/her.\n&gt;\n&gt; I was thinking I could do this by completin=\r\ng the following tasks:\n&gt;\n&gt; - Implementing the RunListener interface in JUni=\r\nt.\n&gt; - Create an extension of Exception that could contain a HashMap of\n&gt; s=\r\nimple parameters and that would be passed to the constructor of a\n&gt; Failure=\r\n object from within a test.\n&gt; - Creating Failure objects in my tests that c=\r\nontain the supplemental\n&gt; failrure data.\n&gt; - Passing these failure objects =\r\nto my RunListener implementaiton.\n&gt; - Creating a FailureProcessor class tha=\r\nt displays a GUI with the\n&gt; information in my RunListener implemenation to =\r\nshow the programmer\n&gt; executing my tests the supplemental failure data as d=\r\nescribed above.\n&gt; (FailureProcessor would be an interface so that you could=\r\n do different\n&gt; things with the supplemental failure data, not just show it=\r\n in a GUI.)\n&gt;\n&gt; Before I begin this work, I wanted to ask if there was a be=\r\ntter way to\n&gt; do this. I know I could use a logging framework from within m=\r\ny test\n&gt; method, but I really want to work within the JUnut framework, not\n=\r\n&gt; outside of it. I also want a nice little GUI, not a log file.\n&gt;\n&gt; How are=\r\n other programmers handling instances when they want to display\n&gt; supplemen=\r\ntal data on failed tests? Does my approach sound reasonable?\n&gt;\n&gt; The Sunbur=\r\nned Surveyor\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n \n&gt;\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
