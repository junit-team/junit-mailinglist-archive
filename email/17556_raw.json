Mike&#39;s chapter was very good, but it was\n&gt; almost pointedly devoid of TDD. The test-later approach that the\n&gt; chapter took left the example relatively untested.\n&gt; \n&gt; Nevertheless I am very pleased with the testing orientation of Rails,\n&gt; and am looking forward to seeing that very active and energetic\n&gt; community continue to embrace the disciplines of TDD.\n\nI am finding it difficult to do TDD with Rails, mostly because I&#39;m \nexpecting to use the same dependency injection techniques there as I use \nwith Java, and that doesn&#39;t seem to fly. For this, I have two questions:\n\n  * Does anyone else have this or a similar problem?\n  * Would someone point me to a place to discuss those problems?\n\nThanks.\n-- \nJ. B.
