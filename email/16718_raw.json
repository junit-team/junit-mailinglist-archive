The problem is that it should NOT be \n&gt; looking in program files. I have a j2sdk1.4.2_06 directory on my \n&gt; root C: drive and that is what I am referencing in my JAVA_HOME. I \n&gt; even went to what should be an unnecessart step to add the tools.jar \n&gt; for this directory to my CLASSPATH property. I am not using 1.5 yet \n&gt; since it has not been approved by the organization that I work for.\n&gt; \n&gt; Why when I specifically am pointing to this directory on JAVA_HOME \n&gt; and the CLASSPATH is it deciding to look in jre1.5.0_06&#92;lib down \n&gt; under Program Files. It is obviously totally ignoring these \n&gt; properties and going on its own hunting expedition. The question is, \n&gt; how can I get it to stop?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Wayne Fay&quot; &lt;waynefay@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Might be related to the space in &quot;Program Files&quot;? I&#39;ve seen \n&gt; numerous\n&gt; &gt; bugs in Java apps due to spaces on Windows.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Perhaps reinstall JDK1.5 in a folder with no space?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; wf\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; On 5/11/06, whitworthjanet &lt;janet.e.whitworth@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sorry for posting this question here, but I am trying to run ant \n&gt; at\n&gt; &gt; &gt; home so I can get a junit report and I can&#39;t get it to run. I am\n&gt; &gt; &gt; getting the following message:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Unable to locate tools.jar. Expected to find it in C:&#92;Program\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Files&#92;Java&#92;jre1.5.0_06&#92;lib&#92;tools.jar\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I have JDK1.4 installed on my c: drive. I have JAVA_HOME \n&gt; pointing to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; it and I tried putting the tools.jar on my classpath environment\n&gt; &gt; &gt; variable. I don&#39;t know why it is looking down in C:&#92;Program \n&gt; Files&#92;Java\n&gt; &gt; &gt; or if it just went searching on its own why it didn&#39;t pick up \n&gt; either\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the 1.4 or 1.5 JDK directories that are in that directory.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Has anyone had a problem with this or have any ideas what I \n&gt; should try\n&gt; &gt; &gt; next?
