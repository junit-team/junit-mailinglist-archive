And, by\n&gt; practiced I me=\r\nan, SERIOUSLY practiced.  I talk with a lot of groups who\n&gt; say they *do* u=\r\nnit testing but have just a handful of test, rarely run,\n&gt; and no consisten=\r\ncy, idea of code coverage, etc.\n\nKeeping in mind you&#39;re preaching to the ch=\r\noir... ;-)\n\nTDD may have a place in every organization, but IMHO in some th=\r\ne\namount of work required to implement it is monumental and perhaps even\npr=\r\nohibitive. If your codebase is dozens of 1000 line files of\nfunction-less s=\r\npaghetti code maintained by mulitple programmers across\nmultiple teams in v=\r\narious geographical locations... You (and your\norganization) have a lot of =\r\nwork ahead of you before you can push TDD. \n\nWith that in mind, /starting/ =\r\neffective code testing becomes the\nhardest part, especially if nobody on yo=\r\nur team--or even entire\ncompany--has experience with unit testing. Further,=\r\n if your codebase\nisn&#39;t one that lends itself to testing, the programmers t=\r\nhat developed\nit probably need coding guidance before their code will be ab=\r\nle to be\neffectively tested.\n\nFollowing another thread of thought... \n\nTDD =\r\nrelies on &quot;Type 1&quot; people, as you called them (those that actively\nchampion=\r\n TDD). Mentors. Champions. Zealots. It&#39;s amazing (and\nsometimes scary, depe=\r\nnding on context...) how receptive people are to\nguidance from those that s=\r\nimply demand to be listened to. \n\nIf you&#39;re in an environment where TDD is =\r\nnot used/respected, do it\nanyway, but not in a vacuum. Talk about it and me=\r\nntor others in\nunderstanding how to effectively write tests and /testable c=\r\node/.\nFurther, demand that those around you do as well. Bring it up in\nmeet=\r\nings. Admit your &quot;failures&quot;--when your code fails your own unit\ntests. Coun=\r\nt the number of times this happens. When bugs come up in\napps, &quot;remind&quot; the=\r\n programmer fixing it to &quot;be sure to write a unit\ntest for this so it doesn=\r\n&#39;t happen again.&quot;\n\nIf you&#39;re interested in the big picture, identify those =\r\nprogrammers\nyou think are most likely to leave your work environment and ma=\r\nke sure\nthey understand and follow unit testing practices, knowing they&#39;ll =\r\nbe\nthe champion of unit testing (if not TDD) at the next place they go to.\n=\r\n\nGabriel.\n\n\n",
