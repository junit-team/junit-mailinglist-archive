One of the very few features we are missing is generating a class from the test class (but this feature is coming and you can join the NetBeans community and vote for this issue and other issues related to JUnit).<br/>\nTo follow Kent&#39;s approach what you need to do is first create the Dollar class in the src folder as an empty class, and then create the test class in the test folder.<br/>\nNow type the whole test. NetBeans will underline in red the lines that have a problem. Go to that line and press Alt+Enter, and NetBeans will present you the option to create the missing part in the source class. Once you can compile the test with no errors you can run it and make it fail. Then you can put your effort in filling the source class with the logic to make the test pass.<br/>\nI hope this is what you were looking for.<br/>\nAll the best,<br/>\n<br/>\nMarcelo.<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, Nat Pryce &lt;nat.pryce@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve not found the JUnit &quot;support&quot; in any IDE useful for TDD.  They<br/>\n&gt; all assume that you are testing a class that already exists, and if it<br/>\n&gt; does, they generate one test per method of that class, which produces<br/>\n&gt; unhelpful test classes with unhelpfully named tests.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --Nat<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 2009/4/19 Karl Krasnowsky &lt;karlkras@...&gt;:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; This question is really targeted to those who have used Kent Beck&#39;s book,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Test-Driven Development within the context of the NetBeans IDE, otherwise<br/>\n&gt; &gt; please disregard.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Maybe someone here can provide a pointer to already available information on<br/>\n&gt; &gt; this.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m using Kent Beck&#39;s book, Test-Driven Development as a tutorial and was<br/>\n&gt; &gt; looking at how i might use NetBeans with its JUnit plugin to mimic his<br/>\n&gt; &gt; recommended processes, but right out of the gate I&#39;m having a fundamental<br/>\n&gt; &gt; issue.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; A standard practice of KB&#39;s method is to code the test before any code is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; written, and then backfill the empty bits (class, methods, variables, etc.)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to make the test work.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; for example, here&#39;s the first JUnit test he shows in chapter 1 to begin<br/>\n&gt; &gt; building from:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Code:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; public void testMultiplication() {<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Dollar five = new Dollar(5);<br/>\n&gt; &gt; five.times(2);<br/>\n&gt; &gt; assertEquals(10, five.amount);<br/>\n&gt; &gt; }<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Problem I&#39;m having is, if I&#39;m creating tests out of the context of the Java<br/>\n&gt; &gt; project, tests in NB aren&#39;t created until you have a class with runtime<br/>\n&gt; &gt; methods to create tests from. So I have a chicken egg sort of situation. NB<br/>\n&gt; &gt; would do the obvious thing, i.e., have tests generated from code, so the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; above doesn&#39;t make any sense as it implies that the code is generated from<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the test, which is a cool idea of the IDE could support it.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I have experience using JUnit, so the framework itself isn&#39;t in question,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; but how to apply this methodology within the IDE format is.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Do I have to simply short-circuit the default process that NB and the JUnit<br/>\n&gt; &gt; plugin manufacture?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; thanks in advance for any help on this,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Karl<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -- <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.natpryce.com\">http://www.natpryce.com</a><br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
