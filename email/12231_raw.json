B. Rainsberger&quot; &lt;jbrains@r...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; zoran_101 wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thanks, this helped a lot, and also I happen to have the JUnit\n&gt; &gt; Recepies book so I just looked it up. However it looks like that \nI\n&gt; &gt; will have to run my tests in a container, meaning I have to use\n&gt; &gt; Cactus. I don&#39;t think I can do this with Cactus because they\n&gt; &gt; instantiate TestCase. If there is a way I would love to know.\n&gt; \n&gt; You can&#39;t, as the book says. :)\n&gt; \n&gt; Check back with Cactus, though: I told Vince about this and he \nsaid he \n&gt; might try to fix the problem. The question is whether it was high \nenough \n&gt; priority to be done.\n&gt; \n&gt; You have a few choices:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. Use Cactus, but be forced to use the &quot;check()&quot; pattern that \nsomeone \n&gt; on this list mentioned. (Kevin? Chris?)\n&gt; \n&gt; 2. Change the test so that it doesn&#39;t need to run in a container, \nthen \n&gt; apply the Parameterized Test Case pattern. The book is full of \n&gt; suggestions for moving tests outside of the container.\n&gt; \n&gt; What&#39;s the reason for the container in the first place?\n&gt; \n&gt; Take care.\n&gt; -- \n&gt; J.
