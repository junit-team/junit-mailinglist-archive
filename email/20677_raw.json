Your proposal is akin, it\nseems to me, to having different tests in the same class use different sets\nof @Befores. You could do that using a similar syntax to that outlined\nbelow, but it would make it harder to read tests declaratively. With the\ncurrent design, if I want to know what data a test will have available, I\nread the @Befores (and @Parameters). Then I can read all the tests assuming\nthose are the conditions under which it will execute. If I have a diffferent\nfixture, I go to a different class.\n \nCan you tell me a little more about what benefits you see from your proposed\narrangement and in which circumstances it would be superior to having tests\nwith different fixtures in different classes?\n \nRegards,\n \nKent Beck\nThree Rivers Institute\n\n  _____  \n\nFrom: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of\nMalte Finsterwalder\nSent: Wednesday, July 09, 2008 12:01 AM\nTo: junit YahooGroup\nSubject: [junit] Parameterized Tests, a proposal\n\n\n\nHi,\n\nI just got around to looking into parameterized tests a little more.\nBut it confirmed the impression I got when they came out with JUnit 4.\nThey are sooo clunky, that I rather write a test that calls a \nhelper-method with parameters instead.\n\nBut this time I had time to ask myself: Why is it so clunky?\nIn what way could it be better.\n\nSo I came up with an idea, how I would like it to be.\nAnd here is an example:\n\n@RunWith(Parameterized.class)\npublic class MyParameterizedTest {\n\nprivate Object[] data = new Object[][] {\n{&quot;param1&quot;, 2, 3},\n{&quot;other&quot;, 5, 99},\n{&quot;more&quot;, 234, 5875727343}\n};\n\n// The parameter given as &quot;data&quot; here, specifies that\n// attribute, that contains the parameters for the test\n@ParameterizedTest(&quot;data&quot;)\npublic void testWhatever(String str, int i, long j) {\n// This method gets called 3 times\n// once for each line in the above Object[]\n\n// do whatever here\n}\n\n@Test\npublic void plainNonParameterizedTest() {\n// this is a normal unit test that is\n// called just once\n}\n} \n\nI think it&#39;s a lot easier this way.\nIt allows mixing of parameterized tests and non parameterized tests, if \nyou like.\nI allows for several parameterized tests in a single class.\nAnd I don&#39;t see disadvantages.\n\nIt could be even simpler, if it were incorporated into the existing \nJUnit Test-annotation, like so:\n\n// no @RunWith-Annotation here\npublic class MyParameterizedTest {\n\nprivate Object[] data = new Object[][] {\n{&quot;param1&quot;, 2, 3},\n{&quot;other&quot;, 5, 99},\n{&quot;more&quot;, 234, 5875727343}\n};\n\n// The parameter given as &quot;data&quot; here, specifies that\n// attribute, that contains the parameters for the test\n// Use of standard Test-annotation with a new parameter\n@Test(parameterized=&quot;data&quot;)\npublic void testWhatever(String str, int i, long j) {\n// This method gets called 3 times\n// once for each line in the above Object[]\n\n// do whatever here\n}\n}\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nI already tried to implement the first version, since it&#39;s non \nintrusive, but looking into extending JUnit, I found that it&#39;s a pain in \nthe behind, if you don&#39;t want to extends internals-stuff.\nBut maybe I&#39;m just misunderstanding or missing things.\nBut that&#39;s another story for another post... shortly...\n\nGreetings,\nMalte\n\n\n \n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
