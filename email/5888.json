[...]<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Although what you say is entirely true, I think it disregards the<br/>\nimho unfortunately misleading appearance of what I imagine to be<br/>\nthe most common case, in which several tests are bundled together<br/>\nin a subclass of TestCase, from which a TestSuite is assembled on<br/>\nthe fly via reflection.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince such a subclass of TestCase defines several tests, it is<br/>\neasy (though wrong) to think that an instance of that subclass<br/>\nperforms several tests.  Then TestCase looks like the composite<br/>\nlevel of the Composite pattern, rather than the leaf level.  It<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t help that the assembly of the actual -- and unrelated --<br/>\ncomposite object from the TestCase is hidden away in the<br/>\nTestRunner, whence it is unlikely to grab the mistaken user&#39;s<br/>\nattention.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, all of this has nothing to do with the topic of the<br/>\nthread, which is JUnit&#39;s internals, not its public interface.</div>",
