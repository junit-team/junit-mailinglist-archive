But whi=\r\nle you are developing that\nskill, an assertion log might be useful.\n\n&gt; If y=\r\nou aren&#39;t going to think about the failure message when you write  \n&gt; it, t=\r\nhen don&#39;t write one.\n\nIt is often the case that you do not realize how unin=\r\nformative\na message is until you see it in action. On a larger scale this\ni=\r\ns why people have to write many drafts. If the first time\nyou see a message=\r\n is 10 months after your wrote the assertion,\nchances are it won&#39;t be as in=\r\nformative as if you&#39;d happened\nto read it at least once before you committe=\r\nd it.\n\nAs for why anyone would write to the console when writing a\ntest cas=\r\ne, I don&#39;t know, but I have often seen it and in\nfact have often seen the s=\r\nystem out being used where an\nassert should have been used. This generally =\r\noccurs when\npeople are first being introduced to unit testing, probably\nbec=\r\nause they have prior experience writing the &quot;I&#39;ll just eyeball it&quot;\nkind of =\r\n&quot;test&quot;. Maybe if by writing an assertion\n(generally the same amount of code=\r\n) they could have got something\nwritten to the console as a side effect, th=\r\ney would write assertions\ninstead and the net result would be a better test=\r\n case.\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;J.

Yes, many people have said they want  \n&gt; to log assertions i=\r\nn tests because they want the warm fuzzy feedback  \n&gt; that their tests are =\r\nrunning and assertion what they think they are  \n&gt; asserting. Logging is ju=\r\nst one, and in my opinion a bad, way to do  \n&gt; this. I believe it is much b=\r\netter to write simpler tests.\n&gt; &gt; 1) eliminating redundant logging statemen=\r\nts - Many logging statements\n&gt; &gt; in a JUnit test case simply output informa=\r\ntion that you&#39;ve already\n&gt; &gt; told JUnit about in your assertions. Developer=\r\ns often put these in as\n&gt; &gt; a &#39;sanity check&#39; to verify that the test is doi=\r\nng what they expected.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; If your tests need such a sanity check, then I=\r\n believe they should be  \n&gt; simpler.\n&gt; &gt; 2) improving assertion messages - =\r\nit&#39;s often the case that the\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; first time you see the message for an =\r\nassertion will be when the\n&gt; &gt; assertion fails, which may not happen until =\r\nyou run a regression test\n&gt; &gt; many moons after you coded the test. Unless y=\r\nou see the message\n&gt; &gt; displayed when you are developing the test, you won&#39;=\r\nt realize that the\n&gt; &gt; message - if you provided one - is not be very helpf=\r\nul. Better\n&gt; &gt; assertion messages also help to communicate to a developer w=\r\nhat the\n&gt; &gt; point of the assertion is both when it fails and when reading t=\r\nhe  \n&gt; &gt; test.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; If you aren&#39;t going to think about the failure message=\r\n when you write  \n&gt; it, then don&#39;t write one.\n&gt; &gt; 3) see finer-grain test r=\r\nesults. Every assertion is a mini-test on its\n&gt; &gt; own, but JUnit these mini=\r\n-tests are invisible until they fail.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; Absolutely not. Assertions are =\r\nnot mini-tests. A test is a test. If  \n&gt; you have multiple unrelated assert=\r\nions in a test, then move them into  \n&gt; their own tests. This leads to a nu=\r\nmber of benefits (more accurate  \n&gt; test count metrics, more information wh=\r\nen a test fails, easier to  \n&gt; isolate the cause of a failure).\n&gt; &gt; 4) by m=\r\naking logging easy, it can help to avoid the\n&gt; &gt; using-system-outs-instead-=\r\nof-asserts syndrome, where new junit test\n&gt; &gt; writers will write &quot;test case=\r\ns&quot; that actually just write a bunch of\n&gt; &gt; stuff to the console that the te=\r\nst writer then eyeballs for expected\n&gt; &gt; results\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; Why would anyone use=\r\n JUnit to spit things out to the console? If they  \n&gt; want output on the co=\r\nnsole, and they&#39;re not just using that as a way  \n&gt; to learn to use JUnit, =\r\nthen they shouldn&#39;t use JUnit.\n&gt; &gt; There are some problems with logging ass=\r\nertions that I have  \n&gt; &gt; encountered:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 1) if iterating over a colle=\r\nction and asserting each element, your log\n&gt; &gt; can be overwhelmed. Maybe it=\r\n would be useful to have some way of\n&gt; &gt; hinting that a particular assertio=\r\nn should not create notifications;\n&gt; &gt; maybe not.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; I don&#39;t even want t=\r\no think about how slowly tests will run, and how  \n&gt; much time I would wast=\r\ne deciding which tests should log what and when.  \n&gt; It&#39;s much easier just =\r\nto add logging where I want it.\n&gt; &gt; Is there any appetite out there for add=\r\ning assertion logging (or\n&gt; &gt; assertion notification) into the junit 4 fram=\r\nework? I would be\n&gt; &gt; happy to do the work if I thought it would be accepte=\r\nd into the\n&gt; &gt; main junit distribution. Or maybe this capability already ex=\r\nists\n&gt; &gt; in some way in junit 4 that I am not aware of?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; Yes, there is=\r\n such an appetite, but I hope there is a bigger appetite  \n&gt; not to include=\r\n it.\n&gt; ----\n&gt; J.
