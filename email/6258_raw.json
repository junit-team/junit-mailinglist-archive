For instance,\n&gt; writing tests that include the database are often QUITE difficult. Not\n&gt; everyone has a copy of Oracle; we can&#39;t just erase tables willy-nilly\n&gt; to set up for each test; etc. So I will use mock objects (hopefully\n&gt; starting from those at www.mockobjects.com) to simulate the connection,\n&gt; and other &quot;external&quot; data sources/sinks.\n\nYou may want to consider staying away from putting any logic in the\ndatabase (i.e. PL/SQL). We have a lot of business logic in our database\nand it makes testing difficult because mocking the database would require\nre-implementing the logic in Java.\n\n\n&gt; QUESTION 1:\n&gt;    Where do my JUnit unit tests go?\n&gt;\n&gt;    I see 3 likely answers... (a) make each an inner class of the\n&gt;    class being tested, (b) for every class &quot;Foo&quot; have a class called\n&gt;    &quot;TestFoo&quot; in the same package, or (c) have a separate (but parallel\n&gt;    hierarchy of classes... SOURCE/com/pkg/Foo.java is tested by\n&gt;    TEST/com/pkg/TestFoo.java.\n&gt;\n&gt;    I lean towards (c) because it makes it easy to build the &quot;real&quot; code\n&gt;    and the &quot;test&quot; code separately, and omit the &quot;test&quot; code from\n&gt;    production deployment. Are there other significant issues here?\n\nI use (b) and (c) on different projects. I like (b) better because it&#39;s a\nlot easier to find a test (it&#39;s right there in the same directory as the\ncode). We prefix our tests with &quot;_&quot; and suffix them with &quot;Test&quot; to make\nthem easier to find (so a test for the String class would be\n&quot;_StringTest&quot;).\n\nWe deploy the test cases along with the production code because it&#39;s easy\nand we have no reason not to. But it wouldn&#39;t be too hard to jar up\neverything that doesn&#39;t start with &quot;_&quot;.\n\n\n&gt; QUESTION 2:\n&gt;    How do I automatically build the suite of all tests?\n\nWe coded up a TestSuite that finds all the tests in the project (which is\npretty fast because they all start with &quot;_&quot; so we don&#39;t have to use\n&quot;instanceof&quot; to figure out if they are tests or not) and executes them.\n\nWe also threw in some fun options like only running tests in certain\npackages and running the tests in order of their execution speed (we have\nsome really slow tests, which I know is bad, but there&#39;s not too much we\ncan do about it).\n\nIt can also run just those tests that have been compiled in the last 10\nminutes plus tests for any classes that have been compiled in the last 10\nminutes. (So if you modify method A.foo() and class B calls A.foo(), then\n_ATest and _BTest will be executed.) This is to get around the problem of\nour test suite being really slow, which is something that I want to fix\nbut cannot (for non-technical reasons).\n\n\nAlso, our development environment, IntelliJ IDEA, allows us to select a\ndirectory or package and run all the tests it finds.\n\nIDEA also has the very handy ability to run all the test methods in the\ntest case that you are currently editing, or just the test method that the\ntext cursor is currently in. (And it will run them in the debugger too if\nyou like. So debugging a test case is as simple as putting a breakpoint in\nthe test method, putting the text cursor in that method, and then hitting\nthe keyboard shortcut for debug.)\n\n\nErik\n\n\n\n",
