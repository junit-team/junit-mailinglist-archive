Let&#39;s presume I&#39;ve reached<br/>\n &gt; the stage where I have successfully implemented the rules engine along<br/>\n &gt; with a full suite of unit tests. Would I be violating any canons by<br/>\n &gt; having JUnit output its results in some text-like form to enable quick<br/>\n &gt; comparisons between result sets of different rules changes ? Is there<br/>\n &gt; a more elegant way to accomplish this ? I&#39;m essentially trying to come<br/>\n &gt; up with a quick way to tell the user &quot;When you change Rule # 5 that<br/>\n &gt; way, loans 1, 4 and 7 fail but 2,3 and 89 now pass.&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Whenever you run your unit tests, the test results are reported<br/>\nback.  Different runners report back the results in different<br/>\nways, from the GUI with the green bar [1], to XML results<br/>\ngenerated by an Ant task [2].  So, yes, you have a number of<br/>\noptions for capturing the test results to report them back.<br/>\nDepending on the format, you could use some sort of diff/compare<br/>\ntool to point out differences between two results sets if you<br/>\nneed that, but within each run it would be obvious what works<br/>\nand what breaks.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you say &quot;tell the user,&quot; who is the consumer of these test<br/>\nresults?  I ask because, for the most part, JUnit results are a<br/>\nbit programmer-oriented.  You can of course take something like<br/>\nXML results and format them nicer for non-programmer consumption,<br/>\nor even write your own listener to output results as needed.<br/>\nBut the results generally report back assertions that fail and<br/>\nstack traces and things like that.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are looking for some tests that someone like a Product<br/>\nManager might be able to work with, you might want to look into<br/>\nsomething like the Fit [3] or Fitnesse [4] frameworks that allows<br/>\nthem to specify tests in a table-like format either in a Word/HTML<br/>\ndoc or on a wiki page.  These are higher-level functional tests,<br/>\nbut your last line sounds to me a lot like a functional test, with<br/>\nthe &quot;user&quot; experimenting with the rules to see what loan types<br/>\nbreak.<br/>\n<br/>\n[1] <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://junit.sourceforge.net/doc/cookbook/cookbook.htm\">http://junit.sourceforge.net/doc/cookbook/cookbook.htm</a><br/>\n[2] <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ant.apache.org/manual/OptionalTasks/junitreport.html\">http://ant.apache.org/manual/OptionalTasks/junitreport.html</a><br/>\n[3] <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://fit.c2.com/\">http://fit.c2.com/</a><br/>\n[4] <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.fitnesse.org/\">http://www.fitnesse.org/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nHope that helps,<br/>\nPaul<br/>\n-----<br/>\nPaul Hodgetts -- CEO, Principal Consultant<br/>\nAgile Logic  -- www.agilelogic.com<br/>\nConsulting, Coaching, Training -- On-Site & Out-Sourced Development<br/>\nAgile Processes/Lean/XP/Scrum -- Java/J2EE, C++, OOA/D, UI/IA, XML</div>",
