As I \nrecall, just adding the junit v4 jar made it work in eclipse.  You might \nckeck Windows-&gt;Preferences-&gt;Java-&gt;JUnit settings and make sure \neverything is fine.  You should see listings for JUnit 3 AND JUnit 4. \nMake sure you check &#39;Enable Assertions for JUnit ...&quot;\n\nMy problem was in running JUnit v4 from Ant.  To do this, I had to \ninstall Ant 1.7.x and update the ANT_HOME within Eclipse since it comes \nwith a built in Ant 1.6.x installation.\n\nRobert Kuropkat\n\nP.S.  You may need to make sure you have all the latest Eclipse updates...\n\n\noferstu wrote:\n&gt; *This message was transferred with a trial version of CommuniGate(tm) Pro*\n&gt; Hello,\n&gt; The link in JUnit.org website about how to use JUnit and eclipse is \n&gt; broken.\n&gt; My attempt to use JUnit with eclipse was to add the JUnit.jre file to \n&gt; the project in properties, build path.\n&gt; I added it and still cannot run JUnit4 code.\n&gt; What else should I do in order that the JUnit4 will work with my \n&gt; eclipse?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you,\n&gt; Ofer.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo!
