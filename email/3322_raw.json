These TestAll \nclasses can compose all test in subpackages.\nBut I am confused about naming convention for these classes. For root \nTest class it&#39;s simple, name can be AllTest or TestAll, but what \nnames can I assign to other? I looked for some convention, but there \nare only convention for packages or method naming, not for this \nproblem. Have somebody some experience with this?\n\nExample package structure (each level with few Test classes):\nA\nA.a\nA.a.1.xxx\nA.a.2.yyy\nA.b\nA.b.1.xxx\nA.b.2.xxx\n\nIf I name all test classes composing some other test as &quot;TestAll&quot;, \nthere can be confusion later (many classes with name &quot;TestAll&quot;), if I \nname it &quot;TestAllXXX&quot;, where XXX is name of last level of package, \nthere can be still packages with same name of the last level. \nAssigning name as TestAll_A_a_1 (thus full name of package in name of \nclass) is for me too long. Some advice?\n\nThanx\n\nZdenek Smid\n\n\n",
