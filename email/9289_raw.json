However I am still not convinced how\n&gt; would one apply these in large systems.  In particular, in compilers and\nrelated topics.\n&gt;\n&gt; A concrete instance would be an analysis that works on say some IR. The\nanalysis can usually be cast as a single class and the\n&gt; test of the &quot;unit&quot; is that each of the methods function as specified in\nthe given scenarios.  The analysis works on the\n&gt; intermediate representation (IR) of a program.  The IR is dependent on the\ninput program/source code.\n&gt;\n&gt; To test the analysis class you need to provide it an IR which means we\nneed the whole machinery to setup the IR on which the\n&gt; analysis works and then drive the analysis with the test object while\nprobing it correctness.  Generally, the machinery to\n&gt; setup the IR is complex or large.  So, would one code that up into the\ntest case?  If so, at what cost?  A more simple\n&gt; question would be that how much effort should go into setting up the\nenvironment for object to be tested and test object\n&gt; itself?  Also, say if the analysis provides information say relation\nbetween 2 entities in the IR, then how do you test for\n&gt; this relation while unit testing the analysis (may be this is into another\nform of testing but anyways...)?\n&gt;\n&gt; For people who have read &quot;Unit Testing in Java&quot; the above is a case of\nObject Under Test scenario.\n&gt;\n&gt; In simple words, if a chunk of logic embedded in a class requires large\npieces of information to be setup, then how would one\n&gt; use JUnit or any unit testing framework in such cases?  Even more, when\ninstances of such classes go through state changes\n&gt; depending on interaction with other objects how do you instrument the test\nand run the test?\n&gt;\n&gt; The reason I am posting this question is that I have heard a lot about\nJUnit and how Unit Testing is the &quot;magic bullet&quot; (of\n&gt; course I have heard people say otherwise about the latter too).  However,\nI am not convinced as to if it is applicable in all\n&gt; situations and scenarios.  Even more, are there documents or studies that\nindicate the impact of Unit Testing on projects say\n&gt; in terms of shift in timelines, # of bugs, and such?  I am trying to find\nevidence of usage of JUnit is situations similar to\n&gt; ones explained above.\n&gt;\n&gt; waiting for reply,\n&gt;\n&gt; - Venkatesh\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
