It was included in Peter Frey&#39;s book -- an excellent\ncompilation of papers on the subject.\n\nThe finding that, when shown a board containing pieces placed on random\nsquares, non-experts and experts were essentially identical in their\nability to reconstruct the board, with non-experts holding a slight\nedge. (Less mental &quot;interference&quot;, no doubt.)\n\nBut when shown positions arising from actual games, the experts&#39; memory\nwas far and away superior, tantamount to total recall (and I will bet\nthat it was especially keen with respect to the &quot;salient&quot; features,\nalthough there was no way to measure that concept as far as I can\nrecall) -- while the non-experts did just about as well with real\npositions as\nwith random positions.\n\nHowever, the point your are trying to make, I suspect, is that code\ndeveloped by TDD experts will most likely show some interesting patterns\nthat differ from code developed\nby other folks.\n\nThat appears to be Scott&#39;s thesis, as well, and I greatly look forward\nto the expansion and illustration of those views.\n\n\n\n\n",
