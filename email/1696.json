It seems like its<br/>\nnot going to be possible to do it while separating the TestCase classes and<br/>\nthe business object classes.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the reasons I see a difficulty is that we are using VisualAge for<br/>\nJava and it would make it a deployment nightmare to include the code in the<br/>\nsame packages or, worse yet, the same classes.  I know that there are<br/>\noptions I could use outside of VA such as ANT to only build certain classes,<br/>\nbut I doubt I could get the client to buy into that and I still don&#39;t think<br/>\nthat solves the private method issue.<br/>\n<br/>\nAm I just missing something easy or what?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nMike</div>",
