I can see your point about how ugly the test code is\nlooking, and how unhelpful the serialization string is to reading the\ntest code.\n\nI think you could blend the two approaches with a testing-only &quot;mock&quot;\nsubclass that adds some setter methods.  The subclass would not change\nthe constructor or any public methods. This would allow you to write\nunit test code like:\n\npublic void nameTest() {\n    A a = newCreate(&quot;3492342,0,0,,,2,3,4,29394020&quot;);\n    a.setName(NAME);\n    testObj.doSOmething();\n    \n    assert(&quot;testObj did wrong thing&quot;,testObj.getName(),NAME);\n}\n\nFor the purposes of your application, the object&#39;s still immutable. \nThe subclass exists only in your testing codebase.  Your test setup\ncode isn&#39;t running concurrently with the unit under test, so threading\nissues aren&#39;t a problem.  You may have to make the fields of the\noriginal object protected rather than private, but I think that&#39;s a\nsmall price to pay.\n\nYou can then make yourself some &quot;basic&quot; classes accessible through some\nkind of fixture, to make the above test look more like:\n\npublic void nameTest() {\n    A a = getBasicThingForTheUISubsys();\n    a.setName(NAME);\n    .\n    .\n    .\n}\n\nThis lets the reader see that this test is just like the *other* test\nthat uses the basicThingForTheUISubsys() except it&#39;s looking at the\nname.\n\nThis is all just from the hip, let me know what you think.\n\n-Kevin Klinemeier\n\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
