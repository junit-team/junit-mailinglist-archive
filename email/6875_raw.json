I&#39;ve implemented fsm&#39;s before, but never\n&gt;characterized a &quot;testable app&quot; as one that effectively *is* one.\n&gt;\n&gt;I&#39;ve summarized the key points of your post below. It&#39;s going to\n&gt;bear more rumination...\n&gt;\n&gt;Scott Stirling wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;  I&#39;ve been thinking about Test Driven Development and the question\nof\n&gt;&gt; what is it about it that ensures testability.\n&gt;&gt; ....\n&gt;&gt; Obviously, a method added for no other purpose than to make a\nclass&#39;s\n&gt;&gt; behavior more directly accessible to external tests ... enhances the\n&gt;&gt; testability of a class.\n&gt;&gt; ....\n&gt;&gt; So how do you make things testable without corrupting the object\n&gt;&gt; design with behaviors added or modified just to make objects\n&gt;&gt; testable?  And why is it that test driven development, practiced\n&gt;&gt; religiously, will typically give you 100% statement coverage without\n&gt;&gt; adding any test-only methods to a class?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I think the answer has to do with finite-state machines.  TDD is a\n&gt;&gt; methodology that results in the development of clean, working\n&gt;&gt; finite-state machines.  It works so well because the methodology of\n&gt;&gt; writing tests first drives the mental process to identify and make\n&gt;&gt; explicit, in the appropriate order of priority:\n&gt;&gt; 1. the desired outputs\n&gt;&gt; 2. the inputs and behaviors needed to transition the machine from an\n&gt;&gt; initial or existing state to desired output\n&gt;&gt; 3. the objects that compose the machine (one of the least important\n&gt;&gt; things at first, contrary to more traditional design\n&gt;&gt; methodology)....the naming of the objects and definition of their\n&gt;&gt; boundaries evolves as the 1st and 2nd priorities are realized.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; It seems the best way to build and test a finite-state machine is to\n&gt;&gt; make the inputs and outputs explicit, and to make the state\n&gt;&gt; transitions step-wise and traceable.  It&#39;s a fallout from object\n&gt;&gt; oriented programming constraints that the steps become methods in\n&gt;&gt; objects, and the traceability of the steps becomes actualized in\nyour\n&gt;&gt; unit test methods and TestCases.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; After doing TDD, traceability and explicit inputs and outputs are\nwhat\n&gt;&gt; you&#39;ve built into your application and which remain, even if you\ntake\n&gt;&gt; away the unit tests when you&#39;re done.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; So going back to the question of testability, I think there are some\n&gt;&gt; basic things that automatically result in testability in OOP (this\n&gt;&gt; list by no means accurate or exhaustive, and inspired by some\nreading\n&gt;&gt; about state machines in the testing literature, namely Beizer and\n&gt;&gt; Binder):\n&gt;&gt;   - objects or collaborations of objects modeled as finite-state\n&gt;&gt; machines\n&gt;&gt;   - methods for making state transitions in the objects themselves\nor\n&gt;&gt; in other objects\n&gt;&gt;   - explicit inputs to and outputs from methods\n&gt;&gt;   - step-wise, traceable state transitions\n&gt;\n&gt;Note:\n&gt;Here, I find that I need an example to follow the discussion.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I think these things become realized in terms of language and design\n&gt;&gt; specifics.  For example:\n&gt;&gt;   - traceability requires state transition methods to be accessible\n&gt;&gt; for unit testing\n&gt;&gt;   - state must be verifiable via attributes or methods that return\n&gt;&gt; state information and can be used in assertions\n&gt;&gt;   - step-wise means you don&#39;t make monolithic, god methods or\nclasses\n&gt;&gt; that hide multiple, untraceable transitions\n&gt;&gt;   - explicit inputs means that something like the method below\nshould\n&gt;&gt; be tuned based on the fact that the Connection object is the\n*actual*\n&gt;&gt; input needed for the behavior to do its thing:\n&gt;\n&gt;So you&#39;re from Framingham, ay? I used to live there.\n&gt;Where you working? (I was at D.G.)\n&gt;\n&gt;Congratulations again on a fine way to characterize the issue. I&#39;m\n&gt;looking\n&gt;forward to understanding your thesis even better in the future.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;------------------------ Yahoo!
