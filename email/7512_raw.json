Then go ahead and write the tests as needed.  I\nfaced an issue similar to this on a 1.5 year project -- only we were\ntold that unit tests were simply not a priority, period.  We, the\ndevelopers, knew we couldn&#39;t get along without them, so when the project\nplan was given to us without time alloted for automated tests (of any\nsort) we simply agreed to it and moved on.  We wrote the tests anyway\nand delivered ahead of schedule for every milestone/release (with the\nexception of one milestone when two of the four processors on our server\nwent nuts).  :p\n\nAs I said this may sound deceptive, but at least in our situation it was\nthe case that the management was not actually opposed to testing, they\nwere opposed to the thought that it would slow us down.  It made for a\nrather lively discussion at the end of the project. :p\n\n=jason\n\n\n",
