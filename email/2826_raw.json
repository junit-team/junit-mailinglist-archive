If this happens the way \n    &gt; it says in the\n    &gt; documentation, &quot;assert&quot; will become a reserved keyword in \n    &gt; the Java language.\n    &gt; Here is the Sun page detailing the new assertion facility:\n    &gt; http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/docs/guide/lang/assert.html\n    &gt; Note that it seems this is already in the beta of JDK 1.4.  \n    &gt; \n    &gt; The document also details ways of turning off assertions, \n    &gt; including the fact\n    &gt; that you must use a special setting at compile time in order\n    &gt; for assertions to work at all:\n    &gt; http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/docs/guide/lang/assert.html#compiling\n    &gt; \n    &gt; The question is whether not using this compile-time \n    &gt; setting frees up the\n    &gt; &quot;assert&quot; keyword for use as a method name.  My fear is that it\n    &gt; does not.  \n    &gt; \n    &gt; This could definitely cramp our style, to put it mildly.  \n    &gt; Anyone know any\n    &gt; more about this issue?\n    &gt; \n    &gt; Thanks,\n    &gt; Noah Green\n    &gt; \n    &gt; \n    &gt; \n    &gt; Noah Green\n    &gt; Software Engineering Manager\n    &gt; ThinAirApps, Inc.\n    &gt; (212) 343-5032\n    &gt; noah.green@...\n    &gt; \n    &gt; This message and any appended documentation is intended \n    &gt; only for the use of\n    &gt; the intended recipient(s) and is proprietary and confidential to\n    &gt; ThinAirApps, Inc. and may not be disclosed to third \n    &gt; parties without the\n    &gt; prior written permission of ThinAirApps, Inc.
