The =\r\nproblem is: if one fails, the other two will run \n&gt;anyway. But if the creat=\r\nion or getter methods fail, it doesn`t make \n&gt;sense for me to test the dele=\r\ntion method, as it depends on the \n&gt;correctness of the other two. I know ca=\r\nlling one test inside another \n&gt;is not recommended. What should I do in thi=\r\ns case? \n\nThere are a few options, depending on the kind of tests you&#39;re ru=\r\nnning.\n\n1. Change your tests so that they can run independently. This is th=\r\ne best overall approach.\n\n2. Make your test fixture &quot;self-repairing&quot;. Add l=\r\nogic to your test fixture so that it puts itself into the expected state ev=\r\nen when a test fails. If you can do this, then you can probably do #1.\n\n3. =\r\nPlace your tests into one, single test. You lose the ability to report on e=\r\nach test separately, but then I would argue that you really have one large =\r\ntest and not three smaller tests.\n\nOne question to ask: what are you trying=\r\n to test? If you are testing business logic that, as a side-effect, calls t=\r\nhese methods you mention, then separate data access from business logic. If=\r\n you are testing your integration with a database, then you may be testing =\r\nthe database driver and not your code!\n\nI hope this helps.\n\n\nJ. B.
