It would seem you gain the same power by allowing any Class&lt;?&gt;. The advantage of doing this is it would allow real classes within the project to act as Categories, so that if, for example, I am testing a DAO framework, I can categorize individual tests with the specific DAO subclass they are targeting, and then run a category based on the DAO supertype. Much nicer than just calling it all SlowTests. In practice that won&#39;t happen often if a custom interface is required because it will introduce a dependency on a JUnit type in the production code.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m also curious if you considered using an annotation as the category? That is having the category take a Class&lt;?&gt; that represents an annotation? You could support meta-annotations to allow a hierarchy of categories as well as supporting any subclasses or implementations of types so annotated. Coding for that would be nasty business, but it wouldn&#39;t be complicated from a client point of view, and would allow the same flexibility of inheritance without the dependency on a JUnit type.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would prefer just an arbitrary Class&lt;?&gt;, though. Inheritance is well understood by any Java programmer (unlike meta-annotations) and opens up a synergy between the category hierarchy and the code hierarchy.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, David Saff &lt;david@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; All,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; There&#39;s a short post on the upcoming Categories feature of 4.8 here:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://saffgreenbar.blogspot.com/2009/11/heres-test-code-snippet-public.html\">http://saffgreenbar.blogspot.com/2009/11/heres-test-code-snippet-public.html</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Share and enjoy,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;    David Saff<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
