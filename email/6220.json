But the TestSuite holds initialization<br/>\n&gt;stuff so it must run.  Is there a way I can start the TestSuite, run<br/>\n&gt;the intialization then get to choose which test from a class I want to<br/>\n&gt;run?<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Could you give us an example of how the TestSuite holds initialization <br/>\nstuff?  Could that initialization stuff live within the test case&#39;s <br/>\nlocal fixture rather than a global fixture?  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve seen this occur when using TestSetup to define global fixtures. <br/>\n The symptom is that tests must be run within the context of TestSetup <br/>\nto pass.  That&#39;s an unfortunate situation borne out of undesirable <br/>\ncoupling between multiple test cases and a common test fixture.  My <br/>\nexperience has been that breaking these dependencies can do wonders for <br/>\nthe design.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease post a concrete example so we can help.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMike</div>",
