Prepare to do legwork, convince people,\nand help them with JUnit<br>\n- get management/QA support. Not just superficial one, but prepare them\nto make tradeoffs when it comes to hard deadlines and still support\nyou<br>\n- if possible, work ahead towards the hard questions: how can I get a\npersistent data setup? How to clean it up and make tests\nindependent?<br>\n- start small, obviously, and incrementally build up your test base. If\nthere are old tests, work with people to convert them to JUnit \ntests<br>\n- a big plus of JUnit is that you have single starting point to run all\ntests from, your root AllTests. That is a big selling point.<br>\n- embedd it into the dev process: noone releases anything without having\nrunning tests (of course it doesn&#39;t work fully, but you get the\nidea)<br>\n- have release engineering provide managers with feedback from daily\nbuilds and test runs about system quality state<br>\n<br>\nAt Skyva, I got a dedicated QA person to help implement JUnit support,\nbut only after I had gone already an initial mile. Typically, QA is your\nfriend. I hope QA in your place cooperates rather than fights\ndevelopment.<br>\n<br>\nThere is more, but I can&#39;t think of it right now.<br>\n<br>\nGood luck,<br>\nDirk<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nAt 04:15 PM 3/16/2001 -0800, Kevin Bourrillion wrote:<br>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <blockquote type=\"cite\" class=\"ygrps-yiv-2025212595cite\" cite><font face=\"arial\" size=\"2\" color=\"#0000FF\">Hi\nDavid,</font><br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n<font face=\"arial\" size=\"2\" color=\"#0000FF\">My preference would be to never\ngrind development to a halt.&nbsp; But, I would be aggressive about\nwriting tests for all new development and all bug fixes.&nbsp; Once your\nteam is in this habit for a while you&#39;ll be well on your way.&nbsp;\nPeriodically you might use a code coverage tool to identify gaping holes\nin your testing and schedule a couple of person-days to plug them\nup.&nbsp; Another way to prioritize new test development for old code is\nto ask yourselves &quot;what are we most concerned will break?&quot; and\nthen test that.</font><br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n<font face=\"arial\" size=\"2\" color=\"#0000FF\">You&#39;ll never have a &quot;fully\ntested product&quot; -- I don&#39;t believe there is such a thing.&nbsp;\nThere will always be many more tests that could be there, no matter how\nmany you write.&nbsp; But, every well-conceived test helps a little\nmore.</font><br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n<font face=\"arial\" size=\"2\" color=\"#0000FF\">Kevin</font><br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp; \n<dl><font face=\"tahoma\" size=\"2\">\n<dd>-----Original Message----- \n<dd>From: David M.
