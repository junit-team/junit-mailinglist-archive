And not completely pragmatic.  Should you\ntest drive toSting() methods that you want for nice test failure\nreports?  There are bits & piecs that very likely will slip through\nuntested.  Some aren&#39;t a problem.  You need a new exception... do you\ntest drive it or ask your IDE to make you a new exception with the\nrequired constructors?\n\n&gt; To me, the bottom line with Test Coverage is that it is a &quot;negative\n&gt; metric&quot;. Low test coverage is an indicator of failure; but high test\n&gt; coverage is not an indicator of success. Your code could be\n&gt; highly-covered by failing tests, after all. ;)\n\nIf this were the TDD list, I&#39;d chastise you by saying that none of\nthem should fail once the code is written. :-)  I would say &quot;highly\ncovered by ineffective tests&quot;.\n \n&gt; That&#39;s why we need skilled testers: to fill in the gaps between\n&gt; Customer Tests (too high-level, often miss boundary conditions) and\n&gt; Programmer Tests (very low-level, often miss integration problems).\n\nAgreed.  There are methods and tools that can help programmers\nmaximize (or at least improve) the effectiveness of their tests. \nAnalyzing code coverage during the run of the highest level AllTests\nsuite is a first step.  Running Jester regularly also helps find holes\nin the test logic (note: that&#39;s very different than coverage).\n\nDave\n\n\n",
