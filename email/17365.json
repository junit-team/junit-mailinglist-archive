As the original poster pointed out, the reality depicted in books<br/>\n&gt; about testing is very different from the real world, and practical advice<br/>\n&gt; for that is fairly scarce (yes, I read Michael Feather&#39;s book).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Which reality depicted in which books is different from what real-world <br/>\nexperience?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, if practical advice seems scarce, I venture it&#39;s for two reasons:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. It&#39;s not easy.<br/>\n2. Once someone like Feathers writes about it, there&#39;s no real need to <br/>\nduplicate it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; That&#39;s one reason, there are plenty of others, such as &quot;We&#39;re approaching a<br/>\n&gt; deadline and I have to add this feature for our customer, so I&#39;ll do that<br/>\n&gt; instead of adding a test&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I have felt that pain. Implementing /any/ change program, such as <br/>\nchanging the way you write code, is not a good idea when you&#39;re <br/>\napproaching a deadline. That&#39;s why I have found two key ways to <br/>\nintroduce programmer testing into a programmer&#39;s practice:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. by working on a side-project where there are no immediate deadlines, <br/>\nsuch as something open source or personal, OR<br/>\n<br/>\n2. by working on a desperate project where it couldn&#39;t get much <br/>\nworse--if you spend 2 weeks trying to write tests and don&#39;t get <br/>\nanywhere, that&#39;s fine, because 2 weeks trying to add to a horrible <br/>\ncodebase probably wouldn&#39;t have helped, either.<br/>\n<br/>\nI happened to do #2 instead of #1. Some people tell me #1 has worked for <br/>\nthem, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
