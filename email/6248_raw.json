My concrete class then\nreturns the correct &quot;connection&quot; which could be a MockObject or the real\nthing.  I then have test cases that run for both scenerios (or more) by\nsimply creating another concrete class which supplies the &quot;connection&quot;.\n \n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Chermside, Michael [mailto:mchermside@...]\nSent: Wednesday, November 20, 2002 3:31 PM\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: RE: [junit] Re: Looking for some &quot;Best Practices&quot;\n\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; QUESTION 3:\n&gt; &gt;    How do I &quot;turn on&quot; my mock objects when tests are running?\n&gt; \n&gt; In our current tests we are only using mock objects for a few tests \n&gt; to mock out the database.  We have one class we call that returns a \n&gt; database connection, so we added a method to that class to allow us \n&gt; to say &quot;Hey, here&#39;s a mock object for this data source.  When someone \n&gt; requests a connection to this database, give them this mock object \n&gt; instead of a real connection.&quot;  This let&#39;s us mix mock objects and \n&gt; real connection.  For example, we have one database that is ours, and \n&gt; we have a test replica in-house.  Several other databases we deal \n&gt; with are outside our realm.  So, if need be, we could still hit our \n&gt; database and mock out all of the other ones.\n\nAha... I like that. You have to create the mock object in\nthe test case (or it&#39;s setUp()), so what you do is to hand\nthat mock object off to the factory class. This is how the\nfactory knows to hand out a mock instead of a real connection.\nNice. I think I&#39;d ALSO have the factory check an environment\nvariable (so I can report things like asking for 2 connections\nwhen it was only supposed to ask for one), but this is a\ngood approach.\n\n-- Michael Chermside\n\n\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\njunit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n\n\nYour use of Yahoo!
