Google&#39;s a hotbed of the so=\r\nrt of programmers who like to read\n&gt; and write books about OO theory and la=\r\nnguage design. But most of the\n&gt; world is not Google.\n\n\nI have to say I&#39;m q=\r\nuite amused to be characterized this way, but I&#39;ll gloss\nover the personal =\r\nstuff to get back to the debate.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, Spring, Eclipse a=\r\nnd a few other popular frameworks\nin the Java world have shown that interfa=\r\nces are not just a fad and that\ntheir usefulness to solve real-world proble=\r\nms is solidly established, and\nincreasing every day.\n\nConversely, the exagg=\r\nerated reliance on concrete classes has proven (again:\nboth in books and in=\r\n the industry) to cause all sorts of code smells, among\nwhich:  unnecessary=\r\n coupling, difficulty to test, problematic maintenance,\nreliance on undocum=\r\nented behavior, etc...\n\nOn a more general level, it&#39;s quite interesting to =\r\nsee TDD advocates now\nfinding themselves in the difficult position of havin=\r\ng to choose beween\n&quot;doing the simplest thing that could possibly work&quot; (avo=\r\nid interfaces, use\nhard core concrete classes) and &quot;write code that can be =\r\ntested&quot; (and\ninterfaces are usually recognized to help in that area).\n\nI&#39;ll=\r\n give a chance to other readers on this mailing-list to jump in and\nstate t=\r\nheir thoughts on interfaces before digging deeper myself.\n\n-- \nC=C3=A9dric\n=\r\nhttp://testng.org\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n=\r\n\n",
