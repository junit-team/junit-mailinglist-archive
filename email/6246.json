We have one class we call that returns a <br/>\n&gt; database connection, so we added a method to that class to allow us <br/>\n&gt; to say &quot;Hey, here&#39;s a mock object for this data source.  When someone <br/>\n&gt; requests a connection to this database, give them this mock object <br/>\n&gt; instead of a real connection.&quot;  This let&#39;s us mix mock objects and <br/>\n&gt; real connection.  For example, we have one database that is ours, and <br/>\n&gt; we have a test replica in-house.  Several other databases we deal <br/>\n&gt; with are outside our realm.  So, if need be, we could still hit our <br/>\n&gt; database and mock out all of the other ones.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Aha... I like that. You have to create the mock object in<br/>\nthe test case (or it&#39;s setUp()), so what you do is to hand<br/>\nthat mock object off to the factory class. This is how the<br/>\nfactory knows to hand out a mock instead of a real connection.<br/>\nNice. I think I&#39;d ALSO have the factory check an environment<br/>\nvariable (so I can report things like asking for 2 connections<br/>\nwhen it was only supposed to ask for one), but this is a<br/>\ngood approach.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Michael Chermside</div>",
