I connect to a data provider via an IP address. They have\n&gt; &gt; provided an API which I implement, and get callbacks from them with\n&gt; &gt; the data. I can create a mock of one of their classes - but since\n&gt; &gt; it&#39;s not hooked up to their IP, there&#39;s no data in it.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I suppose I could decompile their class and put some data in it - but\n&gt; &gt; at that point, am I really testing my interaction with their classes -\n&gt; &gt; or with one of my own munging?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks for any suggestions.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; About a year ago I had to get our application to work with another \n&gt; application over JNI (they only had a C/C++ interface).   I did the \n&gt; following:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. I wrote an interface that described how I wanted to access the\nremote \n&gt; API in terms of my\n&gt; application (the Facade pattern)\n&gt; \n&gt; 2. I wrote an implementation of that interface using fake data for \n&gt; testing the rest of the system.\n&gt; \n&gt; 3. I wrote tests of the real implementation against the real API (which \n&gt; accessed a local copy of the remote application). As the real API was \n&gt; not always going to be available (licensing issues), these were \n&gt; separated from the rest of the tests.  Some of these tests were also \n&gt; &quot;Learning tests&quot; to make certain I understood the remote API (and,\nin my \n&gt; case, JNI, as this\n&gt; was my first JNI project).\n&gt; \n&gt; I thus ended up with three kinds of tests:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. Learning tests to make certain I understood the API (and also \n&gt; protecting me from changes to the API).\n&gt; \n&gt; 2. Tests of my real implementation of the interface against remote\nAPI.  \n&gt; These tests were separated from the standard set of tests.\n&gt; \n&gt; 3. Tests of my application against a fake implementation.  These were \n&gt; part of the main set of tests.\n&gt; \n&gt; I hope this helps,\n&gt; \n&gt; Kathy Van Stone\n&gt; kvs@a...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---------------------------------\nYAHOO!
