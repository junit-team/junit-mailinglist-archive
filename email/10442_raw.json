What if I have a class that \n&gt; has a small section of code that is repeated constantly in the class. \n&gt; The way I was taught back in the day was to pull that section code out \n&gt; and make it a private member to enhance code readability and security \n&gt; (singular updates).\n\n...and that&#39;s all great, but that was before JUnit. Since then, we now \nhave two opposing forces: the desire to protect code from being used \nunexpectedly (by making it private) and the desire to write JUnit tests \nthat do not /overly/ depend on a class&#39;s implementation details.\n\nMaking code non-public has never made my life easier, so I don&#39;t see the \npoint in doing it. If it weren&#39;t for Eclipse, I would never do it.\n\n&lt;opinion&gt;\nIf it&#39;s important enough to test, then it&#39;s important enough to use, so \nmake it public.\n&lt;/opinion&gt;\n-- \nJ. B.
