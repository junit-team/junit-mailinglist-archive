I&#39;m fairly sure there are other ways,<br/>\n&gt; Data-Driven Tests with a custom test suite might be a better option. I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; sure Cedric can suggest how TestNG provides for this.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Since you&#39;re asking :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, being able to switch the set of tests quickly without recompiling<br/>\nanything was one of the design goals of TestNG. Groups make this very easy.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, you can invoke TestNG like this:<br/>\n<br/>\njava org.testng.TestNG -includegroups database<br/>\n<br/>\nor<br/>\n<br/>\njava org.testng.TestNG -includegroups web<br/>\n<br/>\nSome of our users have more complex ways to select test methods, and<br/>\ntypically, they use<br/>\n<br/>\n- Either different testng.xml files (testng-quick.xml, testng-nightly.xml,<br/>\netc...)<br/>\n<br/>\n- Or BeanShell to select methods being run in more complex cases (&quot;run group<br/>\n&#39;weekend&#39; during the weekend and group &#39;weekly&#39; during the week)<br/>\n<br/>\n 2. Is there a good way to test SWT?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, Eclipse is automatically tested this way. A couple of Eclipse books<br/>\ncover this and you can find more information on <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://eclipse.org\">http://eclipse.org</a> (I<br/>\nrealize you asked for SWT testing, but testing Eclipse is even more complex,<br/>\nso testing SWT should be easier).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nGoogle so far says &#39;not really&#39;. I&#39;ve made some painful conclusions and<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; design decisions from this. Chief among them has been, &quot;if you need to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; test the UI, you&#39;ve probably got model code in your view classes. Fix<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that first.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sure, but you need to test the UI too. Just because your model works doesn&#39;t<br/>\nmean that the UI does.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nCédric<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
