We&#39;re looking to incrementally start\n&gt; tagging our hundreds of test methods with attributes to control\n&gt; whether they&#39;re run or not, and provide a Filter implementation to do\n&gt; the selection logic.\n&gt;\n&gt; I haven&#39;t found much documentation on using the\n&gt; org.junit.runner.manipulation.Filter class; it seems to be very much\n&gt; something applied to a Runner or Request instance, not a property of\n&gt; the test suite itself.\n&gt;\n&gt; Since we have a large investment in organizing tests using a number of\n&gt; classes exposing a suite() method (JUnit3), it seems I want to use the\n&gt; JUnit4TestAdapter class, but once instantiated from within a suite()\n&gt; method, calling setFilter() on it has no effect. It seems that I need\n&gt; to convince the runner itself (which could be Eclipse, Ant, etc...) to\n&gt; call filter(), so unless there&#39;s something I&#39;m misunderstanding, I\n&gt; can&#39;t go down this path.\n&gt;\n&gt; A second approach that seems like it would work would be to use an\n&gt; @RunsWith annotation to set the org.junit.runners.Suite runner to run\n&gt; a suite crafted to replicate the organization we&#39;re doing today with\n&gt; suite() methods. I&#39;ve been able to apply a Filter from within my own\n&gt; Runner implementation (subclassing BlockJUnit4ClassRunner), but I\n&gt; can&#39;t see a way to apply a Filter if I&#39;m using the Suite runner.\n&gt;\n&gt; Any ideas?\n&gt;\n&gt; Jean-Philippe\n&gt; Ottawa, Canada\n&gt;\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
