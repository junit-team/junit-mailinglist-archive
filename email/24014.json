I am a user of JUnit and project contributor in github.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am glad to say that we extended Categories with new feature in pull request <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/KentBeck/junit/pull/503\">https://github.com/KentBeck/junit/pull/503</a><br/>\nThis extension is not yet in KentBeck repo, however the implementation and tests are ready.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn JUnit we got a consensus of anotations design and behavior, but we do not have consensus in javadoc for Categories class.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe would like to ask you to have a look and help us refine the Javadoc, which finally would help to all users of JUnit.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur main goal is to declare many inclusive/exclusive categories on the top of a test suite, unlike the old Categories.java runner which used just only one category.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is Maven community with surefire-plugin, which may use this extension known as groups -currently they only use a single group.<br/>\n<br/>\nNote: you&#39;r welcome to login to www.github.com and contribute to the pull #503 i mentioned above.<br/>\n<br/>\nThx, Tibor</div>",
