I go to the database where the URLs are stored and then open a<br/>\nURL connection and ping the service. <br/>\n<br/>\nI iterate through the URLs, and collect the results. I want to be able<br/>\nto display a message for all the URLs that fail. But I cannot see how<br/>\nto do that.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis test only does on thing, so I don&#39;t think this is a case where I<br/>\nneed to break up the test. Also I don&#39;t want to have to be aware of<br/>\nwhat URLs fail before hand by checking specific URLs with assertEquals.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs there a way I can display multiple errors or failures, in Junit?<br/>\nI have read the FAQ about the logic for not being able to display<br/>\nmultiple results, but I don&#39;t feel like the argument is applicable here.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf there is a previous response, please fowared the message id, when<br/>\nsearched I kept getting &#39;search timed out, only partial results&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks, Karen</div>",
