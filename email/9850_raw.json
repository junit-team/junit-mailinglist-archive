I don&#39;t know of any good answer to as general a\nsituation as this=\r\n. Does C() actually take no parameters, and changes\nstate of the class, or =\r\ndoes C() get passed in the same kind of\nparameters from A() and B()? In the=\r\n former case, maybe it does need to\nbe a private method. In the latter, mig=\r\nht C() be pulled out as a public\nmethod into a helper class?\n\n&gt; If you use =\r\nTDD would you ever end up with private methods, declaring\nthem\n&gt; as protect=\r\ned instead?\n\nIMHO, it doesn&#39;t make sense to make private methods protected =\r\nsimply to\ntest them. &quot;protected&quot; has a specific purpose in the language, an=\r\nd\nunless you are expecting people to write subclasses and override those\nme=\r\nthods, they probably shouldn&#39;t become protected...\n\nJust my 2 cents...\n\nReg=\r\nards,\nNilesh\n\n",
