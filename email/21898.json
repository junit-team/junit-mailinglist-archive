I had to make one rule which composed and delegated to an ExternalResource rule and had its own before and after methods because ExternalResource does not allow the overriding of its apply method. I certainly understand the inclination to make it final, but I would suggest that it be reconsidered.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegardless, going further replacing my custom runner, I did hit another wall, with @BeforeClass and @AfterClass. I assume there is nothing to do about those (other than an assumeThat in @BeforeClass)?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, David Saff &lt;david@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; That&#39;s right: Rules can affect the processing after @Before and before<br/>\n&gt; @After.

What happens is that I have a custom runner that suppresses the test (these are slow tests, so they are only run at check-in, not by the developer while developing).<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; However, when I replace that with a Rule, the setup method is still run (looks slow). So I guess the conclusion is that @Rule can&#39;t interrupt or override the setup and teardown process, so if you need to do that you are back to a Runner? (Or making your own setups rule-aware I guess).<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, David Saff &lt;david@&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Yishai,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I just ran a test, and the Rules in the superclass were picked up.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Can you post a small example?  Thanks,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;    David Saff<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; On Thu, Aug 20, 2009 at 10:21 AM, David Saff&lt;david@&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Yishai,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Sounds like a bug.  Can you file it at github?  Sorry for the oversight,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;   David Saff<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; On Wed, Aug 19, 2009 at 8:26 PM, yme0987654321&lt;yme0987654321@&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I&#39;m looking at the new Rule annotation in JUnit4.
