The change was not intentional. I am interested in arguments for making them public, though.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Looking at them, what they do is so trivial I would prefer them not to \n&gt; be public, solely on the grounds of simplifying the API. Every method \n&gt; that can be eliminated is one less thing to document, one less thing to \n&gt; explain, one less thing to stumble over when you&#39;re looking for \n&gt; something else.\n&gt; \n\nAssert is an utility class so it tries to offer convinient methods for almost everything. Following \nthe above argument all assert(type, type) can be removed and only left assert(String, Object, \nObject), but you will find afterwards ugly to write assert(new Integer(val1), ...).\n\n\n&gt; I suspect them becoming public had something to do with the relationship \n&gt; between the old junit.framework.Assert and the new org.junit.Assert \n&gt; classes. (The former now extends the latter.) I don&#39;t know why there are \n&gt; two classes here. They don&#39;t appear to be substantially different. Could \n&gt; we just get rid of the new one. Would anything break? Hmm, looking at I \n&gt; was able to remove org.junit.framework.Assert fairly easily. I had to do \n&gt; a search for the static imports and replace them with \n&gt; junit.framework.Assert. \n\nAs far as I can tell I think that the new Assert class was created to remove the custom \nAssertionException and use the AssertionException provided since JDK1.4. From my point of view this \nis definitely a very good reason to have it.\n\n&gt; I had to make junit.framework.Assert extend \n&gt; Object like it used to. \n\nWhat do you mean by this?\n\n:alex |.::the_mindstorm::.|\n\n",
