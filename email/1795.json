If you don&#39;t include JUnit with your release, your test will <br/>\n_never_ run.  And if your customer is an end-user I doubt that he will <br/>\ninstall JUnit and look into the jar to find the AllTest.java file :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can be proud of your test code but I think that it&#39;s better said in <br/>\nthe release note: &quot;JUnit -the leading testing framework for Java <br/>\napplication- has executed xxx tests to ensure that your application&#39;s <br/>\nquality meets the highest standards... blah blah blah&quot; :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n-Vladimir</div>",
