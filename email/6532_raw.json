But if I take the view that tests should test \n&gt; behaviour rather than code, then I have to consider &#39;partwise \n&gt; constructor fails for (2002,2,29)&#39; and &#39;parsing constructor \n&gt; fails for &quot;2002-02-29&quot;&#39; to be separate behaviours, both \n&gt; deserving to be tested.  That they almost certainly use the \n&gt; same code is an implementation detail with which the tests \n&gt; ought not to be concerned, and ought not to assume.\n\nYes and no. It&#39;s your job as developer to test everything that can fail,\nbut no more than that. To a large degree, your knowledge of the\nimplementation and risks involved help drive that. The paragraph above\nis based on the assumption that you *know* that the code paths converge\nearly. If that were not the case you would have to proceed differently.\n\n&gt; For example, if at some point in the future these \n&gt; constructors are changed to use separate implementations of \n&gt; the constraint checks for some reason, I&#39;d like the tests I \n&gt; write now to remain valid and complete.  If I assume the \n&gt; parsing constructor uses the same code as the partwise \n&gt; constructor, such a change silently makes the tests incomplete.\n\nFor what its worth, this runs counter to XP. You are proposing doing\nextra work now in anticipation of a possible change in requirements or\nimplementation in the future. I&#39;ll leave suggesting whether this is a\nbad thing or not to those who like to debate these things. On the one\nhand there are valid reasons for not doing work in anticipation of\nrequirements or changes that may never happen. On the other hand, if you\nlater make a change that invalidates the overriding assumption that the\ncode paths converge, and don&#39;t correspondingly update the tests, then\nyou have, as you said, incomplete tests. On the other hand, regular use\nof a code coverage tool should uncover testing omissions for you\nautomatically.\n\nPersonally, I&#39;d implement it the easy way and put comments in the code\nto remind me to update the test if I ever went back and refactored the\nconstructor. On top of that, I&#39;d make it a habit to regularly run the\ntests under the aegis of a code coverage tool just as a sanity check for\nthe tests themselves.\n\n&gt;   [...]\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;d also make a bunch of helper methods, such as one that takes a \n&gt; &gt; partwise date specification and an expected exception, and then \n&gt; &gt; instantiates using both constructors, asserting that both cause the \n&gt; &gt; expected exception to be thrown. That way you&#39;re not \n&gt; replicating a lot \n&gt; &gt; of code.\n&gt; \n&gt; Quite.  Unless I&#39;ve missed something, this is essentially the \n&gt; same solution as I proposed at the end of my last post.\n&gt; \n\nYup. I just didn&#39;t read down far enough in your post. What&#39;d they say\nabout great minds again? :-)\n\n\n",
