For every test method (&#39;public void&#39; and\nstarting with &#39;test&#39;) there will be a new instance of your test class.\n\nCan you show your code to verify what you are doing differently?\n\n&gt;The test object\n&gt; created during setup turned out to be reused for\n&gt; subsequent tests in the test case, which caused problems\n&gt; arising from old state, until I figured it out.\n\nThis might be the case if you are using static variables instead of member\nvariables.\nProbably a code example will best reveal the problem.\n\nI strongly agree to your general comment:\n\n&gt; Note:\n&gt; In general, I&#39;m not much fond of the name, &quot;TestCase&quot;, because\n&gt; to me that represents a single test. Since a TestCase class can\n&gt; actually have multiple test methods, the name &quot;TestFixture&quot; is\n&gt; probably more appropriate. But be that as it may...\n&gt; \n&gt; It appears to me that the word &quot;test&quot; is badly overloaded in the\n&gt; docs, meaning at various times, test method, test case, and\n&gt; potentially even test suite.\n&gt; \n&gt; The best way to eliminate confusion that I can see is to do a\n&gt; global search on &quot;test &quot;, and replace with one of the hyphenated\n&gt; words &quot;test-method&quot;, &quot;test-case&quot;, or &quot;test-suite&quot;, as appropriate.\n\nJohannes\n\n-- \n+++ GMX - Mail, Messaging & more  http://www.gmx.net +++\nBitte l�cheln!
