I had a hand in\ncreating the java.awt.Robot class (this email address is my personal email).\n\n\nIn our team we widely use Robot for GUI automation.  We do, though, have\ndifferent requirements than most since we are testing the JDK as it is being\ndeveloped, rather than testing an application built using the shipping JDK.\nI gave a brief talk last week at a JavaOne BOF about what we&#39;re doing for\nGUI test automation.\n\n\nThe glance I&#39;ve taken at JUnit so far tells me it&#39;s a framework to help\ncreating test cases, and that there&#39;s nothing in it to aid GUI automation.\nWe&#39;ve created a few different similar frameworks in our test suites here,\nand I can tell you that at the level I see JUnit operating, that use of\nRobot fits in very well.  Also, that if you choose to use Robot, that you\nwill need to develop some higher level code to provide higher level\nfunctionality.\n\n\nWe have gotten a lot of mileage out of validation through looking at\ninternal state.  Primarily this boils down to listening to listener\ninterfaces, and saying that the test passes if the right listeners are\ncalled.\n\n\n- David Herron\n\n\n\nIt isn&#39;t a question of being favorable or not.  It is a question of &quot;Do you\nwant to automate the testing of your GUI with JUnit?  And if so, to what\ngranularity?&quot;  I think testing the GUI is always good, but there are\nlimitations for JUnit to do this.  If there is pertinent state information\nthat you want to capture (which it doesn&#39;t sound like there is) you can use\nthe approach I mentioned before.  If you simply want to test the overall\nlook, a one-eyed inspection is fine.  If you want to programmatically test\nthe overall look, something like SilkTest would probably be a good way to\ngo.  I think that having state inspectors on every GUI component is\noverkill!  If there is some meta-state that your controller gets from the\nview to effect a change on your model, then write an inspector on your\ncontroller for that, but not just for testing.  The test should reflect (to\nsome degree) the usage.  Again, this isn&#39;t a silver bullet, it&#39;s just one\nexample.\n\nMVC can be difficult.  If it is done improperly it offers many traps!!  But\ndone rightly, it&#39;s a wonderful tool.  Testing is easier, refactoring is\neasier, etc.\n\n-Jason\n\n\n\n-- \n\n\nYahoo!
