I&#39;ve<br/>\nvisited teams that have a pretty good handle on cohesion and coupling,<br/>\nand adding tests isn&#39;t that hard for them. Other teams have a very hard<br/>\ntime, their code is so mangled, it&#39;s difficult even to start. If I had<br/>\nto offer advice in a nutshell, it would be to look at dependency<br/>\ninjection and either use it or use it as an idea. You can get a lot of<br/>\nmileage out of the technique of taking dependencies and passing them in<br/>\nthrough the constructor so that they can be mocked in test and real in<br/>\nproduction code.<br/>\n<br/>\nMichael Feathers<br/>\nwww.objectmentor.com<br/>\nmichaelfeathers.typepad.com<br/>\n<br/>\nMatthias Schmidt wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;Hello all,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;Here&#39;s what I would like to add:<br/>\n&gt;It is often very hard to implement unit tests after coding the application, because the programmer did not have UNITS in mind when coding. So it is not so easy to have a look at at one code unit at a time.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;So it could easily be the case that writing the tests afterwards will take a lot more time because you have to refactor your whole code before you can even start to implement the actual tests. Or to put it the other way round: TDD makes you write more modular, easier to read and maintain code.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;Best regards,<br/>\n&gt;Matt<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>] On Behalf Of Cédric Beust ? <br/>\n&gt;Sent: Friday, February 16, 2007 5:48 PM<br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: [junit] additional expenses<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hi Felix,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;This is an interesting question, and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s been brought up here<br/>\n&gt;before.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;In my experience, this is a bit hard to quantify, but it&#39;s probably fair to<br/>\n&gt;say that while the cost appears a bit on the high side initially (especially<br/>\n&gt;if the developers on your team are not used to writing tests and that there<br/>\n&gt;is no existing testing infrastructure), it tends to decrease over time as<br/>\n&gt;programmers become more experienced in writing tests, reuse or create test<br/>\n&gt;base classes and tend to write solid tests in their first iteration.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Although it&#39;s obviously hard to prove or disprove, I would probably say that<br/>\n&gt;at the very beginning, it&#39;s not rare to spend as much time writing a test as<br/>\n&gt;it is to implement the corresponding feature. That first test is always<br/>\n&gt;very expensive, especially if it&#39;s an area of your product that has no tests<br/>\n&gt;at all. It all gets better after that.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hope it helps, and looking forward to other people&#39;s answers.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
