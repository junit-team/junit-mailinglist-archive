I&#39;d be curious what others think of it.\n\nOne big hurdle in this kind of testing is timing.  You often have to make\nsure that event A has finished before you invoke event B.  This can be\ntricky when you are dealing with networked systems and suchwhat.  Robot&#39;s\nwaitForIdle() might help with that ... but like I said I haven&#39;t really had\na chance to peer too deep. \n\nIts described here:\nhttp://developer.java.sun.com/developer/TechTips/2000/tt0711.html (second\narticle down).\n\n - joe\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Vladimir Bossicard [mailto:vladimir@...]\nSent: Monday, June 04, 2001 12:30 PM\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: Re: [junit] Functional Testing with JUnit\n\n\nHi Matt,\n\ncould you please send me your code?
