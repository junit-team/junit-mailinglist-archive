I \n&gt; &gt;have also tried adding parent and child directories and played \naround \n&gt; &gt;with orderings and none seems to help.\n&gt; &gt;I am using Windows XP.  It is very strange, because it runs almost \n&gt; &gt;all the tests...all but the last one!!!\n&gt; &gt;Do you think I should re-install?  (the tests that I am writing \nwork \n&gt; &gt;OK though).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; It couldn&#39;t hurt.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m out of recommendations.
