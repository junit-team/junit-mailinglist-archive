I have waited a<br/>\nwhile, but it is very late know so I want go to sleep. Approximate<br/>\nquote is &quot;We should define helper class because YourTest class must<br/>\nhave only one construtor.&quot; It is obviously wrong. You can define<br/>\nstatic method (a function) and call it from their. If you want to be<br/>\nable to overload these functions you can define them as (instance)<br/>\nmethods and in @Parametrized function instantiate YourTest using the<br/>\nonly constructor with &quot;garbage&quot; parameters. Note, that @Parametrized<br/>\nfunction is static, so you can&#39;t call instance method directly, you<br/>\nhave to instantiate instance of this class. In your subclass you<br/>\nshould just instantiate your subclass instead and mechanism of<br/>\ninheritance will work.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is clearly design decision, whether to use helper class or not. You<br/>\ncan avoid this whether by using (static) function or by using<br/>\n&quot;garbage&quot; as parameters to your constructor. While using a helper<br/>\nclass is much &quot;cleaner&quot; disadvantage of this approach is creation a<br/>\nhelper class.</div>",
