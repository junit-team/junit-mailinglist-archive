Using this measure, the command design requires fewer lines.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother measure of simplicity is the number of algorithms that have to <br/>\nchange or be created. In the case of the switch statement, we have to <br/>\nchange 1 algorithm (the switch) and create 1 algorithm (the <br/>\nimplementation of the new command-like thing). In the case of the <br/>\ncommand design, we only have to create 1 algorithm (the implementation <br/>\nof the new command) and we don&#39;t need to change any other algorithm.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Or something, I have my preference but I don&#39;t know if it is the<br/>\n&gt; simple one in everyones book. I think it can become more complicated<br/>\n&gt; than just counting lines fo code to know what is simple but I agree<br/>\n&gt; that it is a good start.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>When counting lines of code for this purpose, I tend only to count the <br/>\nbodies of methods and exclude lines that only declare variables.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ.
