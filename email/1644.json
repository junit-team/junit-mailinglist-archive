We are looking at some commercial code<br/>\ncoverage tools - and I&#39;ll definitely check into the open source options now<br/>\n- but that&#39;s not really what I&#39;m trying to accomplish.  (I was wondering if<br/>\nusing the term code coverage might confuse the issue).  I want to do a<br/>\nstatic analyst of the code to check which classes and methods have tests.<br/>\nThink of it as Lint for Junit - Jint perhaps :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nJohn <br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Michael Silverstein<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: 6/25/01 9:05 PM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [junit] Test coverage metrics reporting tool<br/>\n<br/>\nWith Test Mentor (which among other things discovers and runs JUnit<br/>\ntests)<br/>\nwe use the JPDA <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://java.sun.com/products/jpda/\">http://java.sun.com/products/jpda/</a> to dynamically<br/>\nmonitor<br/>\nmethod entry events during test execution.

(I&#39;m sure someone<br/>\n&gt; has.)   What I<br/>\n&gt; what to do is generate a report that shows some stats on how many<br/>\n </span></blockquote>classes<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; have test cases and how many methods in the class under test have<br/>\n&gt; corresponding test methods.  I have tried it a few different ways:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 1. Just scanning through the source folder, picking up the java files<br/>\n </span></blockquote>and<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; then checking if a ?Test.java file exists in a corresponding unit test<br/>\n&gt; folder.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This approach works well if I only cared about the file coverage,<br/>\n&gt; but I now<br/>\n&gt; want info on the method coverage.  Enter method 2.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 2. Use a tool that will parse through the java source and tell me all<br/>\n </span></blockquote>the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; methods. I used javadoc for this, but the problem with it is that<br/>\n&gt; I can only<br/>\n&gt; sort through one source structure at a time, and javadoc is not so<br/>\n </span></blockquote>nice to<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; call programmatically (it shuts down your app after it runs once).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If anyone has suggestions on a better was to get info on the methods<br/>\n </span></blockquote>in a<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; class, and other information like is the class an interface, I<br/>\n&gt; would love to<br/>\n&gt; hear it.  Or better yet, if anyone has seen or built a tool<br/>\n&gt; similar to what<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m doing I would also love to hear about it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; John<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
