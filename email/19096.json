How<br/>\nwill I know when I look at the CruiseControl test results page which<br/>\ntest instance goes with which parameters?  I didn&#39;t really know.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re using CruiseControl and JUnit 3.8.  The default Test Results page<br/>\njust shows the name of the test methods, their status (Success, Failure,<br/>\nor Error), and how long they took to run.  But if he&#39;s got a suite of 20<br/>\ninstances of the same test (just with different constructor arguments)<br/>\nhow can he tell which one it was that failed?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nTodd.<br/>\n----<br/>\nTodd Bradley - Polycom, Inc.<br/>\nTest Lead, Proximo Projects<br/>\n<br/>\nVisit me at my WebOffice for IM and app sharing:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.polycomweboffice.com/todd.bradley@...\">http://www.polycomweboffice.com/todd.bradley@...</a></div>",
