It runs as a servlet so it needs a servlet\nengine such as Tomcat, Orion or Weblogic to execute it.\n\nThe latest version of JUnitEE that you can find in the CVS\ncontains also an option to print the tests executed.\n\nYou find JUnitEE on http:sourceforge.net/projects/junitee\n\nI think it does about what you request!\n\nregards\nKaarle Kaila\n\n\n--- In junit@y..., sramaswa007@y... wrote:\n&gt; Hi All,\n&gt; \n&gt;   I am designing a project to run junit test cases from the \nbrowser.  \n&gt; Basically the user is given a form where in he types in the test \n&gt; class he wants to run and clicks the submit button. \n&gt; \n&gt; The test case class is called and the results are returned back to \n&gt; the browser.  I am fine till that part as I am able to call the \n&gt; appropriate test case entered by the user and am able to display \nthe \n&gt; results on the browser.  \n&gt; \n&gt; What I also need is that, is there a way to determine and print \nwhat \n&gt; test case methods are being run.  As in case of the swingui \n&gt; (junit.swingui.TestRunner) we have the progress bar indicator that \n&gt; tells us how many test cases are run, the failures and errors and \nthe \n&gt; stack trace.  Right now I am able to get all the results but once \nall \n&gt; the test cases have finished running, till then the page displayed \nto \n&gt; the user is blank.  Is there anyway to dynamically show which \nmethod \n&gt; in the test case is running and whether its a failure or error or \n&gt; success.  Please let me know.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Sri\n\n\n",
