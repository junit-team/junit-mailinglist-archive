I have not tried\n&gt; running from command line, nor from within Eclipse, which obviously\n&gt; implies not running from a debugger. I am not sure how I would do that\n&gt; in Eclipse, to tell you the truth. I have never done this, but see my\n&gt; junit recipes book discusses running tests from within eclipse. I&#39;ll\n&gt; give that a try later today.\n\n\n\nHow&#39;d that go?\n\n\nI did comment out the various AllTests and found the offender. That\n&gt; AllTest only executed one test. So, I added a target for the one\n&gt; offending test class. When running that, the response is the same as\n&gt; below. It appears to be not running the test at all.\n\n\n\nCan you share anything about the test class that is causing the pain?\n\nGood luck,\n\n   David Saff\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
