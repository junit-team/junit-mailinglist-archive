So one writer <br/>\nthread has not died before the backups ends -&gt; there was a stream that <br/>\nwas not closed -&gt; the file could not deleted. But now i know that JUnit <br/>\ndefinitely does not spawn threads... :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you all for your help!<br/>\n<br/>\nBest regards,<br/>\n<br/>\nNils<br/>\n<br/>\nAm 30.03.2011 11:31, schrieb Malte Finsterwalder:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have done similar tests, where I write a particular file to a<br/>\n&gt; directory and then did some processing on it.<br/>\n&gt; I never had a problem with this setup. And I did reuse the same<br/>\n&gt; directory location for all my tests.<br/>\n&gt; I did clean the directory in the @Before-method and in the<br/>\n&gt; @After-method (Using jakarta FileUtils).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Standard JUnit does not spawn any threads, as far as I know. So the<br/>\n&gt; tests are run sequentially. Other runners could change this, of<br/>\n&gt; course.<br/>\n&gt; If your code spawns threads, that&#39;s a different matter of course.<br/>\n&gt; And from afar I would also suggest to check for files that where not<br/>\n&gt; properly closed.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Greetings,<br/>\n&gt; Malte<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
