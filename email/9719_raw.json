If you adopt a convention that API methods are only \n&gt; presented \n&gt; &gt;via Java Interfaces instead of concrete classes then you don&#39;t care \n&gt; &gt;about the way the implementers of the Interfaces are \n&gt; written. You can \n&gt; &gt;then make non-API methods within the concrete implementation public \n&gt; &gt;without implying that they are themselves API methods.\n&gt; \n&gt; I am not sure I follow, but as I can see this only works if \n&gt; you never plan to extend your clases, or leave them to be \n&gt; extended. I guess that in your case only thing visible from \n&gt; the outside are interfaces. If you write frameworks, it is \n&gt; difficult to get by without inheritance. Inheritance breaks \n&gt; encapsulation, keeping methods private helps encapsulate things. \n&gt; Also, I am not shure what you mean by &quot;without implying&quot;, \n&gt; generally you &quot;make statement&quot; with your code, any other \n&gt; method yo imply something (comments, documentation etc...) is \n&gt; superfluous.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Danijel Arsenovski\n\nOn the contrary, I think this approach makes it easier to extend\nframeworks. I believe that in the general case, there is no reason to\nmake methods in classes private if their API methods are only accessed\nby clients via Interface methods.\n\nHere&#39;s an example of what I mean:\n\nLet&#39;s assume we have class MyClass that implements interface\nMyInterface, with methods:\npublic int x(){\n  // return an answer based on y() and z() \n}\nprivate int y() {...}\nprivate int z() {...}\n\nAnd Interface MyInterface with method:\npublic int x()\n\nWe observe that:\n\n- MyInterface serves to &#39;publish&#39; the API method x().\n\n- Any client of MyClass will only see it in terms of \n\n- We have the choice of testing public method x() by constructing a test\nthat &#39;talks&#39; to either MyClass or MyInterface. \n\n- If we have other concrete implementors of MyInterface it makes sense\nto write the test to talk to MyInterface rather than directly to\nimplementors to they can be swapped in and tested.\n\n- x() returns a value based on values returned by private methods y()\nand z().\n\n- Methods y() and z() may be private for no other reason than that they\nare not part of the public API interface of MyClass and that the\ndeveloper did not anticipate that anyone would ever need to use them in\nextending the framework.\n\nContinuing:\nLet&#39;s say \n - we want to extend MyClass with MyClass2 that implements method int\nq().\n - we want to override x() so that it uses methods y(),  z(), and q() to\ncalculate its return value. \n\nWe have a problem: MyClass2 does not have visibility to private methods\ny() and z().\n\nIf private methods y() and z() were made public there would be no\nadverse effect on the publication of API methods because users of the\nclass would only see those methods published via MyInterface. \n\nWe have the question of whether it is *safe* to use y() and z(). Since\nthey are not published as part of the API via MyInterface it may be\nconsidered too risky to use them. This can be solved with some notes in\nthe javadoc. \n\nMethods that really are too risky to use outside of the class itself can\nalways be made private but I would hope that this is the exception and\nnot the rule.\n\nThe developer creating the extension can make the decision based on\nthose notes whether they are willing to accept fhe risk of using methods\nthat may not continue to behave the same way or even exist in the\nfuture. At least they have that choice. If they have a good set of tests\nthen changes to those methods in the future will be exposed readily\nenough.\n\nConclusion\n----------\nIf the purpose of making methods private is to indicate that they are\nnot part of a class&#39;s API a better way is to encourage users of the\nclass to program to a Java Interface instead. When you make methods\nprivate it makes the class more difficult to test and short-circuits the\nefforts of people who might need to extend the framework in\nunanticipated ways.\n\n-----------------------------\nMike Silverstein\nSilverMark, Inc.\nThe Object Testing Company\nwww.javatesting.com\n\n---\nOutgoing mail is certified Virus Free.\nChecked by AVG anti-virus system (http://www.grisoft.com).\nVersion: 6.0.522 / Virus Database: 320 - Release Date: 9/29/2003\n \n\n\n",
