In Smalltalk, a=\r\nll data is protected and all methods are public. This caused very few probl=\r\nems in practice and gave framework users a lot of flexibility. My urge to m=\r\nake methods protected comes from my experience that good coding practice (C=\r\nomposed Method, for instance) creates many methods which would make excelle=\r\nnt hooks, but that when I wrote the framework I wasn&#39;t very good at guessin=\r\ng which methods would be useful hooks and which were just good factoring. I=\r\nn a framework used &quot;among friends&quot;, where you can refactor all the client c=\r\node, protected data/public methods is a reasonable practice.\n\nHowever, as E=\r\nrich is at pains to explain to me frequently, that is not the context in wh=\r\nich we are writing JUnit. We need to balance the need for flexibility of ex=\r\ntension with the need for flexibility of design evolution. Revealing all th=\r\ne details of our implementation means we can&#39;t change anything. And so we a=\r\nre left, as you said, revealing only as much as we are certain will be usef=\r\nul.\n\nThis leaves me unsettled. I know that my frameworks aren&#39;t as useful a=\r\ns they could be, but I also know that I would regret opening them up comple=\r\ntely. I don&#39;t see how to strike a better balance than we strike with JUnit,=\r\n though, so I&#39;ll live with it.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nKent Beck\nThree Rivers In=\r\nstitute\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto=\r\n:junit@yahoogroups.com] On \n&gt; Behalf Of Elliotte Harold\n&gt; Sent: Sunday, Oct=\r\nober 30, 2005 10:59 PM\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: Re: [junit] J=\r\nUnit 4 restructuring\n&gt; \n&gt; Kent Beck wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; In general, I prefer to m=\r\nake all non-externally-visible \n&gt; methods protected,\n&gt; &gt; since I don&#39;t know=\r\n a priori which ones will prove useful as \n&gt; hooks for\n&gt; &gt; further extensio=\r\nn.\n&gt; \n&gt; I read this just before I went away on vacation and almost \n&gt; fell =\r\nout of \n&gt; my chair. I gave myself ten days to cool off and then came \n&gt; bac=\r\nk to it, \n&gt; and it still shocked me. I&#39;ve heard claims like this before, bu=\r\nt I&#39;m \n&gt; astounded to hear it from the co-author of Extreme \n&gt; Programming.=\r\n This is \n&gt; a horrible coding practice that flies in the face of good agile=\r\n \n&gt; development practices and basic object oriented principles.\n&gt; \n&gt; Basic =\r\nOOP: keep everything as private as you possibly can. This gives \n&gt; you maxi=\r\nmum flexibility for future development and change. \n&gt; Anything that \n&gt; is p=\r\nrivate can be refactored or changed as needed for any reason that \n&gt; arises=\r\n. Once you publish an interface as either protected or public \n&gt; you&#39;re stu=\r\nck with it. You can&#39;t change it later for performance or \n&gt; changing requir=\r\nements or to fix a mistake. People may be depending on \n&gt; it. This mandates=\r\n that you don&#39;t put anything into your interfaces \n&gt; unless you&#39;re really, =\r\nreally sure it&#39;s right. If you leave \n&gt; something out \n&gt; for which a use ca=\r\nse is later demonstrated, you can always put it in. \n&gt; You can almost alway=\r\ns change a method from private to \n&gt; protected without \n&gt; breaking anyone&#39;s=\r\n code. However, you cannot go the other way.\n&gt; \n&gt; Basic Agile: You Ain&#39;t Go=\r\ning to Need It (YAGNI). Why make the \n&gt; effort to \n&gt; create a protected met=\r\nhod that more than likely will never be used or \n&gt; will be used so rarely i=\r\nt won&#39;t even pay back the complexity \n&gt; cost of the \n&gt; extra JavaDoc? Desig=\r\nning for subclassing is hard. It takes \n&gt; roughly three \n&gt; times as much ef=\r\nfort as designing a final class, maybe more. Most \n&gt; non-final classes in t=\r\nhe wild are fundamentally broken. Of course \n&gt; sometimes you do need subcla=\r\nsses, but don&#39;t go adding \n&gt; extension points \n&gt; willy-nilly until you&#39;re r=\r\neady to design them properly, document them \n&gt; fully, consider their implic=\r\nations for other dependent \n&gt; methods, and do \n&gt; all the other hard work re=\r\nquired to create a truly extensible class. \n&gt; Java erred by not making fina=\r\nl the default, but there&#39;s no reason we \n&gt; have to repeat its mistakes.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; -- \n&gt; =EF=BB=BFElliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\n&gt; XML in a N=\r\nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!\n&gt; http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xia=\r\nn3/\n&gt; http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=3D0596007647/cafeaulaitA/\n&gt; re=\r\nf=3Dnosim\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
