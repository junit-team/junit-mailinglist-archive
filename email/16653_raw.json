I don&#39;t understand why /any/ project would ask\n&gt;  &gt; non-coders (or people who can code, but are not allowed to code on the\n&gt;  &gt; project, like testers) to test any code with JUnit.\n&gt; \n&gt; Maybe I misunderstood, but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s what Anna said:   she just\n&gt; said she wasn&#39;t in a position to change the code of the application, but\n&gt; she&#39;s obviously coding the tests.\n&gt; \n&gt; Which is a fairly common situation...\n\nOK. I thought it was the case that Anna needs to &quot;request a code \nchange&quot;, implying that other people write the code and she only tests. \nThat is certainly different from needing to &quot;request permission to \nchange the code&quot;.\n\nAnna, can you clarify this for us?\n-- \nJ.
