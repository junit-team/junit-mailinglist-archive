I was brought in to teach their test group there how to\nautomate Java API testing. This was before tools like Junit were mature\nenough to handle the needs of that group, so I designed and helped them\nwrite a tool that would.\n\nThe On-Demand Server consisted in part of a applet based &quot;web desktop&quot; and\nan API/framework for extending it. They supported multiple platform\narchitectures (Wintel, AIX, Solaris, Linux)  and two main browsers (IE on\nWintel, Netscape on everything). Part of the toolset which was constructed\nallowed them to run tests directly in the browser. This accomplished two\nthings: 1) It allowed them to test against the various supported browser\nVMs directly, and 2) It allowed them to remotely control\nregression/integration testing against a central automated build.\n\nI carried that tool into another test team at IBM for a similar mentoring\nrole. By then, however, the open source test tools had really come into\ntheir own and the need to do browser based testing had largely diminished,\nso I started to deprecate my tool there in favor of Junit in order to\nreduce tool maintenance costs.\n\nIn any case, I&#39;m very familiar with the problems involved and I&#39;ve taken\napart Junit on multiple occasions. It looks like it should be possible to\ncreate a TestRunner that can run as an applet. In principle, it&#39;s no\ndifferent that the TextUI or SwingUI front-ends that already exist- Junit\nis well modularized in this respect. In practice, you have to work around\nrestrictions with the classloader and trust, which, although tricky, are\nnot insurmountable.\n\nA next step from there is to get the tests to run in browser VMs without\nhuman intervention. This is much more tricky, but is possible and I&#39;ve\nplayed with the idea some. Most browsers have an (undocumented) mechanism\nwhereby you can access their virtual machine without actually loading the\nbrowser.\n\nI would certainly be interested in discussing your situation in detail. We\nmay even be able to get someone out to Pheonix if desired.\n\nOn Thu, 27 Sep 2001, Jamie Nettles wrote:\n\n&gt; Unfortunately the applet is a large legacy applet (over a megabyte).  We\n&gt; have done what you suggest and pulled most of the guts out so that we can\n&gt; exercise them in junit.  However, we have found that typically a large\n&gt; number of bugs involve IE, Netscape, signing issues, or applet parameter\n&gt; issues.  So your comment about automating the applet testing is extremely\n&gt; interesting to me.  Can you elaborate?  Your comment about extending\n&gt; TestRunner to test applets is likewise very interesting.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; &gt; From: Eric Vought [mailto:evought@...]\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Thursday, September 27, 2001 7:38 AM\n&gt; &gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [junit] Testing Applets\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; On Wed, 26 Sep 2001, Jamie Nettles wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I want to test an applet or pieces of an applet using jUnit.  Any\n&gt; &gt; &gt; suggestions?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Well, the first thing to suggest is that its no different\n&gt; &gt; from testing any\n&gt; &gt; other application (as Bob Koss points out). To expand on\n&gt; &gt; that, the thing\n&gt; &gt; which makes an application is just its main method. Everything else is\n&gt; &gt; just a collection of objects and classes which can be unit tested.\n&gt; &gt; Similarly, what makes an applet an applet is just the fact\n&gt; &gt; that you have\n&gt; &gt; an Applet implementation which ties all the rest of your\n&gt; &gt; classes together\n&gt; &gt; into a working whole. The rest is just objects and classes\n&gt; &gt; which you can\n&gt; &gt; easily test.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; It is relatively straight forward to write an applet in such\n&gt; &gt; a way that\n&gt; &gt; you can actually run it either as an applet or standalone.\n&gt; &gt; You do that by\n&gt; &gt; separating all of the function of the applet into other\n&gt; &gt; classes which are\n&gt; &gt; simply delegated to by a very thin Applet implementation.\n&gt; &gt; Even your main\n&gt; &gt; Panel can be separated out easily. You can then instantiate that Panel\n&gt; &gt; either inside the Applet or inside a Frame created from your\n&gt; &gt; application.\n&gt; &gt; If your applet runs in its own Frame, this is even easier.\n&gt; &gt; This type of\n&gt; &gt; modularization will also make the code much easier to unit test.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; You don&#39;t, therefore, need to run your unit tests in a web\n&gt; &gt; browser. They\n&gt; &gt; are run standalone from one of the junit testrunners, just like with\n&gt; &gt; everything else. You can change security settings around testcases to\n&gt; &gt; simulate the default restrictions of a browser. It *is* possible to\n&gt; &gt; automate testing of applets running in browsers for purposes of\n&gt; &gt; portability testing, for instance, but this is non-trivial\n&gt; &gt; and should be\n&gt; &gt; avoided unless/until really necessary. (It&#39;s really\n&gt; &gt; functional testing,\n&gt; &gt; not unit testing)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; [Aside: Has anyone thought about creating an Applet based\n&gt; &gt; TestRunner? This\n&gt; &gt; would make it significantly easier for folks (like us) that\n&gt; &gt; do portability\n&gt; &gt; testing across a gagillion VMs. When I did some of this sort\n&gt; &gt; of work for\n&gt; &gt; IBM (Orion/On Demand Server), we had to write the browser based test\n&gt; &gt; automation pretty much from scratch and it was not fun to get\n&gt; &gt; it to run in\n&gt; &gt; the various browser targets. Changes in the security API and better\n&gt; &gt; conformance since then plus the very modular nature of junit\n&gt; &gt; should make\n&gt; &gt; it *almost* trivial now.
