JUnit also works well with several IDEs which can help you<br/>\n&gt; monitor your progress as you write and pass tests.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You can also easily exclude or include tests using profiles in maven, if <br/>\nyou happen to use maven as a build tool.  You would need to write code <br/>\nfor this if you did not use JUnit.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think of JUnit as main() with extra features.  JUnit doesn&#39;t do the <br/>\ntesting for you, it just facilitates a more uniform test structure for <br/>\nALL tests.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nTrenton D.
