What I mean:\n\nThe following came t=\r\no me from a coder (in another company, though my\nown probably has many simi=\r\nlar instances of the following) who shall\nremain nameless (unless he wants =\r\nto paint a target on his back :-)\n\nanonymous coder 02/08/2004 01:02 PM\n&gt; I&#39;=\r\nm on this project that is writing using a very-buggy,\n&gt; very-ready-any-day-=\r\nnow customized Swing-based UI. We have no tests,\n&gt; and no test framework or=\r\n harness in place.\n\n&gt; Since I consider this a serious issue, (the project w=\r\nill easily\n&gt; exceed the 500,000 lines of code when it&#39;s done) I set about t=\r\no make\n&gt; a useable test harness for unit testing the UI. What we&#39;d like to =\r\ndo\n&gt; is (Test First) assert that each UI widget on each screen behaves\n&gt; ac=\r\ncording to our spec for all kinds of data going into the widget.\n&gt; Pretty s=\r\ntandard TDD, wouldn&#39;t you think?\n\n&gt; Turns out the seriousness of this issue=\r\n is not wholly shared by my\n&gt; peers, some of whom think testing is optional=\r\n. Here&#39;s a quote from\n&gt; one of the core developers of the oh-so-not-ready-f=\r\nor-primetime\n&gt; customized Swing framework:\n\n&gt;     You can build quality UI =\r\ncode without writing tests...\n\nHow did we get here? Here&#39;s my etiology, YMM=\r\nV:\n\nOnce, not so long ago, some Big Brains cogitated, and sent forth the\nid=\r\nea (or perhaps this meme spoke through them): \n\n&quot;Code-time testing is Good.=\r\n Cover completely, and enforce it with\nbuild-time verification.&quot;\n\nBut from =\r\nthe trenches came the response, &quot;The vast majority of us code\nUIs--how can =\r\nwe test _those_ with xUnit tools?&quot; Big heads scratched.\nThere were no UI au=\r\ntomation tools short of monsters like WinRunner,\nand manual testing is pain=\r\nful; both integrate with development\nenvironments like fish ride bicycles. =\r\nSo the Big Brains said:\n\n&quot;Make your UIs thin, and test everything underneat=\r\nh them. That should\nBe Good Enough.&quot;\n\nAnd they were, and are, right: if you=\r\n are very disciplined, and keep\nlogic and state in your UIs to absolute min=\r\nima, and test everything\nelse, you can usually get by. But\n\n- almost no one=\r\n&#39;s that disciplined. Bosses want a fix NOW, or you\n  hafta work with UI cod=\r\ne that&#39;s already thick, or there&#39;s some other\n  reason to just stick a _lit=\r\ntle_ bit of logic in there ... and you&#39;ve\n  got a bigger hole in your cover=\r\nage.\n\n- the Doctrine of Incomplete Testing spreads by induction.\n  Coders, =\r\nin our laziness, impatience, and hubris, tend to think:\n\n=B7 thin =3D=3D !(=\r\nrequired to test)\n\n=B7 my Foo is a thin extension of Bar!\n\n=B7 therefore I =\r\nneed not test it\n\n  Unfortunately, those thin layers tend to gather togethe=\r\nr into\n  big piles of buggy crap. This is the &quot;anti-test-infection.&quot;\n\n- ove=\r\nr time, the big brains were UNDERSTOOD to have said,\n\n&quot;Make your UIs thin, =\r\nand test everything underneath them. That is\nEnough.&quot;\n\n  Meanwhile, thanks =\r\nto tools built on, e.g., java.awt.Robot, now you\n  CAN &quot;go the last mile&quot;: =\r\nyou can automate and test your UIs just as\n  you test the rest of your code=\r\n, and at the same time, and using your\n  fave xUnit tooling. As the capabil=\r\nity arose, so did the myth of its\n  expendability :-(\n\nIMHO the word needs =\r\nto go out: test your @#$^%&* UIs, too! A thin UI\nis still good ... because =\r\nit&#39;s easier to test. But a well-designed,\nuntested UI is just another hole =\r\nin your coverage. &lt;/vent&gt;\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been re=\r\nmoved]\n\n\n\n",
