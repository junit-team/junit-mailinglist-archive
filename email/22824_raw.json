So the only issue tha=\r\nt I have now is running all the tests in the same context, but I have not v=\r\nerified this problem for myself,but was only told it&#39;s an issue by someone =\r\nelse on our team.  Thanks for your help Kent. Adding more logging calls hel=\r\nped me solve the problem that using the debugger didn&#39;t expose because the =\r\ndebugger slowed the main thread enough that the flag pass through was irrel=\r\nevant.\n\nMatt\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, Kent Beck &lt;kentb@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; Matt,\n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you for exploring this before reporting. I was waiting t=\r\no see if someone else jumped in on this because I don&#39;t have any experience=\r\n with EJBs.\n&gt; \n&gt; The behavior you report is certainly not how JUnit is supp=\r\nosed to work. @BeforeClass methods are (I thought) guaranteed to be called =\r\nbefore any tests in that class are called.
