For \nthese tests, success is measured by what I see in the inspector. But \nstoring these tests in junit has independent value. For one, success \ncan also defined as &#39;no exception thrown&#39;, which is what \njunit would test. (The exception might be an unanticipated error, or \na runtime exception I deliberately throw in the test). The other is \nsimply the value of &#39;cataloging&#39; and sharing these tests rather than \nhaving them ad hoc in a development workspace. True, I dont *have* to \nuse junit for that but it fits (except for the return value issue I \nam raising).\n\nObviously I can wrapper my test methods in a junit method but it is a \nwaste of time. \n\nAlso thanks to Mike for the tip about looking at the code, great \nidea. But I dont have any source for junit.jar in the junit3.8.1.zip \nfile I downloaded from junit.org (also sourceforge), else I&#39;d have \nfixed this myself. Where do I find the source distro?\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, Robert Wenner &lt;robert@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; On Monday 23 June 2003 18:43, areider wrote:\n&gt; &gt; I would like to write test methods that I can reuse outside of \njunit,\n&gt; &gt; where I would want to inspect the result of the test.
