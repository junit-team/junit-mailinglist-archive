We plan to revamp those classes for an <br/>\nupcoming 4.x release, and, for that reason, have discouraged clients <br/>\nfrom depending on the current implementation.<br/>\n<br/>\nYours is a good use case to drive this API--could you post a feature <br/>\nrequest at SourceForge, so we can track it better?  Thanks,<br/>\n<br/>\n    David Saff<br/>\n<br/>\nMichael Schechter wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; I am looking to add the following functionality to my tests:<br/>\n&gt; - When provided a list of method names on the command line, only those<br/>\n&gt; methods in the invoked class will be executed.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I need this implementation at the test class level. This was pretty<br/>\n&gt; straightforward with JUnit 3.8.1 - just create new instances of the<br/>\n&gt; derived TestCase with the method name as the argument, and add them to<br/>\n&gt; the suite.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am having a lot of difficulty trying to replicate this<br/>\n&gt; functionality. The filter logic appears to be a one-shot exclusion<br/>\n&gt; filter (everything not matching is dropped), and I can&#39;t seem to find<br/>\n&gt; any documentation that would address this.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; As Mr. Rainsberger and others have suggested, I have searched the web<br/>\n&gt; for an appropriate tutorial. I have found a number of good basic<br/>\n&gt; tutorials (including some references in this group), and a couple with<br/>\n&gt; some advanced content. I cannot seem to find one with the detail to<br/>\n&gt; unlock the tools and capabilities that I am positive are available<br/>\n&gt; within the new JUnit framework. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am also convinced that no one is as capable as the authors in<br/>\n&gt; documenting the features of the framework, and I am having trouble<br/>\n&gt; find Javadoc for some of the classes and APIs in the JUnit 4.1 tree.<br/>\n&gt; There is a fairly good chance that I am looking in the wrong place.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If anyone has any suggestions or guidance on these issues, it would be<br/>\n&gt; greatly appreciated.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks in advance!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Michael Schechter<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
