Granted, not a very nice \n&gt; solution unless,\n&gt; perhaps, it were easier to modify the exclusion list.  I hear \n&gt; in JUnit 4.0\n&gt; that one idea is to make it easy to define exclusions in TestCases\n&gt; themselves.\n\nHi,\nI was getting a ClassCastException with my EJBHome stubs and came \nacross this mail. It solved this particular problem. Thanks!\n\nOf course I have another problem. My client and EJB classes share \nsome common classes. When the client makes an EJB call and the bean  \nreturns these common classes, I get another ClassCastException. These \nare not home stubs but just ordinary Java classes. \n\nYou had mentioned in your solution that we need to exclude the EJB \ninterface classes. Does this mean I should exclude the EJB interface \nclasses *alone*. Currently I&#39;m excluding every class in the EJB \npackage from being loaded under the assumption that what is true for \nthe EJB interfaces should be valid for the other classes too ... Or \nam I wrong?\n\nAlso, is this behavior specific to the JUnit 3.7 release?\nAny input would be appreciated!\nThanks,\n--Das\n\n\n",
