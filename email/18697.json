I was trying to<br/>\nmake an additional point.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; He&#39;s saying that generating tests from existing code has the risk that the<br/>\n&gt; code doesn&#39;t do what it was intended but a test is generated to pass based<br/>\n&gt; on the incorrect code.  So you would have 100% test passes, which is<br/>\n&gt; incorrect against the actual expected results against the requirements.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I am trying to separate the various goals of testing and investigate<br/>\ndistinct strategies that would achieve each goal.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne goal is to prevent regressions: show that, after a change, the<br/>\ncode still does what it did before or at least show what behaviors<br/>\nchanged (regardless of whether the code was previously &#39;correct&#39;). I<br/>\nthink we are agreed that a machine could do this in principle even if<br/>\nit is difficult in practice. It still requires a reviewer, though, to<br/>\ndecide which changes were intended and which were not .<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother goal is to demonstrate correctness: demonstrate that the code<br/>\nbehaves correctly for all inputs. This one is not even theoretically<br/>\npossible for a machine to do. But a machine can make the job of a<br/>\nhuman reviewer easier by showing combinations of inputs and outputs<br/>\nthat are &#39;likely&#39; to represent special or border cases.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, consider this method on a Triangle class:<br/>\n<br/>\npublic boolean isIsosceles() {<br/>\n    return a == b || a == c || b == c;<br/>\n}<br/>\n<br/>\nA machine might generate tests:<br/>\n<br/>\n    public void testIsIsosceles() throws Throwable {<br/>\n        boolean result = new Triangle(59, 100, 59).isIsosceles();<br/>\n        assertTrue(&quot;result&quot;, result);<br/>\n    }<br/>\n<br/>\n    public void testIsIsosceles1() throws Throwable {<br/>\n        boolean result = new Triangle(100, 59, 59).isIsosceles();<br/>\n        assertTrue(&quot;result&quot;, result);<br/>\n    }<br/>\n<br/>\n    public void testIsIsosceles2() throws Throwable {<br/>\n        boolean result = new Triangle(30, 30, 30).isIsosceles();<br/>\n        assertTrue(&quot;result&quot;, result);<br/>\n    }<br/>\n<br/>\nA reviewer might look at these tests and exclaim &quot;That&#39;s not correct!<br/>\nThe last one is equilateral&quot; and amend the spec to exclude equilateral<br/>\ntriangles from the definition of isosceles.<br/>\n<br/>\nA second attempt might amend the code to,<br/>\n<br/>\n  public boolean isIsosceles() {<br/>\n    return a == b || a == c || b == c;<br/>\n  }<br/>\n<br/>\nThe existing tests would then serve as a regression suite. After the<br/>\nchange, one of the tests (the previously incorrect one) would now fail<br/>\nand (we hope) the others would still pass.<br/>\n<br/>\nAssuming the tests are essentially &#39;free&#39; and that we can trust the<br/>\nmachine to generate tests that are at least as good as they were<br/>\nbefore, we can throw all the existing tests away and generate new<br/>\nones.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen we might get a test like this,<br/>\n<br/>\n    public void testIsIsosceles2() throws Throwable {<br/>\n        boolean result = new Triangle(36, 36, 36).isIsosceles();<br/>\n        assertFalse(&quot;result&quot;, result);<br/>\n    }<br/>\n<br/>\nand be happy that our method now behaves correctly.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are a lot of &#39;if&#39;s and &#39;assuming&#39;s in all that but, with a<br/>\nmachine that could generate perfect regression tests in zero time, we<br/>\nmight think quite differently about the value of tests and how we use<br/>\nthem.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs JB suggested, it is impossible for a program to prove the<br/>\ncorrectness of another program. Even with a human/machine combo it is<br/>\ndifficult and tedious which is why I still write all of my code test<br/>\nfirst with TDD.<br/>\n<br/>\nTDD provides excellent regression coverage too but, if it&#39;s<br/>\nessentially free to generate tests to fill the gaps in my TDD<br/>\ncoverage, why wouldn&#39;t I?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe more astute reader will have guessed that the examples above were<br/>\nlifted directly from the demo page at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.junitfactory.com/demo/\">http://www.junitfactory.com/demo/</a>   The service is still experimental<br/>\nand somewhat less than perfect, but I&#39;d be interested in getting<br/>\nfeedback from the kind of people who think a lot about these kinds of<br/>\nthings. I can send an invitation to anyone who wants one.<br/>\n<br/>\nKevin<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.junitfactory.com\">http://www.junitfactory.com</a><br/>\nYou send us code. We send you tests. For free.</div>",
