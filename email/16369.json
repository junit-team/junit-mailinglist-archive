Simply<br/>\n&gt; stating that X line was executed Y times is of marginal use to me if I<br/>\n&gt; can&#39;t map back to see exactly /how/ that line was executed. I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; recall whether EMMA does this. Any other suggestions? Commercial version<br/>\n&gt; of jCoverage?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Why do I need this? At first, I created a custom Javadoc taglet that<br/>\n&gt; developers would add to their class-under-test&#39;s method comments, to the<br/>\n&gt; tune of:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   /**<br/>\n&gt;    * @... = FooTest#testAddBar()<br/>\n&gt;    * @... = FooTest#testAddThreeBars()<br/>\n&gt;    */<br/>\n&gt;   public void addBar(Bar bar) { ... }<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This would insert appropriate Javadoc links to the relevant test<br/>\n&gt; methods. But this is unwieldy, and certainly an unrealistic requirement<br/>\n&gt; for the developers.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
