Are these all hand-coded?  Are these organizations <br/>\nattempting to achieve (and report) near-100% code coverage?<br/>\n<br/>\nOrganizations that *do not* attempt testing these methods: How do<br/>\nthey report their code coverage? For instance, do they &quot;back-out&quot;<br/>\nthe amount of code represented by getters/setters and then report the<br/>\npercentage of remaining code covered? Or - do they lower the goal to<br/>\nsomething considerably less than 100%?<br/>\n<br/>\nIs anyone actually striving for (and reporting metrics toward) near-<br/>\n100% code coverage?<br/>\n<br/>\n_Marvin<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, Elliotte Harold &lt;elharo@m...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; y153446 wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m interested in best practices around automated unit testing <br/>\nof <br/>\n&gt; &gt; getters and setters for organizations striving for near-100% <br/>\ncode <br/>\n&gt; &gt; coverage.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Is anyone actually striving for near-100% code coverage?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Yes. Getters and setters are easy to test. Test them! You&#39;ll be <br/>\n&gt; surprised how many bugs you&#39;ll find in methods that are supposedly <br/>\ntoo <br/>\n&gt; simple to fail.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; There are a few cases where you really can&#39;t test stuff. In <br/>\nparticular <br/>\n&gt; Sometimes you just have to have unreachable code. For instance, I <br/>\n&gt; sometimes find myself implementing an interface such as <br/>\n&gt; java.util.Iterator in a private inner class. My private <br/>\nimplementation <br/>\n&gt; may never call remove() but I still need to implement that method <br/>\nanyway <br/>\n&gt; to fulfill the contract of Iterator. Normally I just make the <br/>\nmethod <br/>\n&gt; throw an exception, in case I&#39;m wrong and something does call it. <br/>\n&gt; However, there&#39;s just no way to reach it to test it (nor is there <br/>\nany <br/>\n&gt; need to do so since this code will never run.) But aside from a <br/>\nfew <br/>\n&gt; weird cases like that, all code should be tested or deleted.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -- <br/>\n&gt; Elliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@m...<br/>\n&gt; XML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/\">http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nos\">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nos</a><br/>\nim </span></blockquote></div>",
