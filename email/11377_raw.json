Categories is an\nexcellent idea that I use quite a bit.  In essence, you are group\ntests (fixtures etc) into groups and just run those groups.\n\nFor example, about 1/10 of my tests are database related and quite\nslow.  So I have a category that excludes those tests during\ndevelopment.  (Of course, prior to checking in, I run the entire\nsuite).\n\nAnother example, I am working on several classes that are coupled\ntogether logically but perhaps not structurally (aka within the xUnit\nlist).  So, during development, I create a category with the explicit\nclasses that I working on to minimize the execution of my tests.\n\nI also like the idea of having explicit tests - tests that only run if\nexplicitly requested.  I use NUnit as a tool for running diagnostics\non our applications.  These *tests* are not really tests, but rather I\nam using NUnits ability to pick them up so that I can a GUI interface\nwithout having to program one.\n\n\n\n\nOn Thu, 8 Jul 2004 10:55:14 +0200, Ilja Preuss &lt;preuss@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Paul Holser wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; my wish list for &quot;TigerUnit&quot;:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; -- use native Java assertion mechanism in Assert methods\n&gt; \n&gt; What is the business value?\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; -- make Assert no longer a superclass of TestCase.  to use Assert&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; methods unqualified, use static import\n&gt; \n&gt; Again, what&#39;s the value?\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; -- annotations for test fixture, test method, setup method, teardown\n&gt; &gt; method, fixture setup method, fixture teardown method, test category\n&gt; &gt; a la NUnit\n&gt; \n&gt; Annotations for test methods sounds like a reasonable idea.
