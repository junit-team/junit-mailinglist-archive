Now I need to add testing capabilites using JUnit, my\n&gt; goal is so I don&#39;t need to deploy every time I make some changes e.g in the Controller.\n\nWhether using Spring 2.x or 3.x, unit testing MVC controllers\nshouldn&#39;t be that hard. This is a testament to the highly decoupled\ndesign of the Spring framework.  In Spring 3.x, they take\nnon-intrusiveness even further by relying heavily on annotations and\nletting you use POJOs wherever possible.\n\nIn general, you just need to write a JUnit test class that&#39;ll perform\nthe responsibilities of the Spring container and provide test\nscaffolding for your controller&#39;s dependencies. Now, if you follow the\nprinciple of &quot;design by contract&quot; (also evident throughout the Spring\nframework) then your controller should be depending upon interfaces,\nnot concrete classes.\n\nIf so, then personally I prefer mocking those dependency interfaces at\ntest time (using a convenient mocking framework such as Mockito). To a\nlarge extent you can still mock concrete classes but using actual\ndependencies usually introduces transitive dependencies which just\nmakes your test scaffolding more complicated or bloated.\n\nAs a general example, take a 2.x SimpleFormController that calls an\nEJB to update an entity.\n1. Mock the EJB interface\n2. Instantiate the controller\n3. Supply the mock to the controller\n4. Mock the request & response parameters\n5. Call doSubmitAction()\n6. Verify that the proper ModelAndView are returned\n7. Verify that the mock EJB&#39;s update method was called with the proper\nparameters\n\nLike I said, Spring 2.5.x and above simplifies the above greatly by\nletting you call your controller methods directly with the actual\nparameters they&#39;ll need (you don&#39;t have to mock the request or\nresponse interfaces).\n\nWithout specifics as to your controllers, forms and views then this is\nas much as I can give you. Hope this helps!\n\n- alistair\n--\nhttp://alistairisrael.wordpress.com\n\n",
