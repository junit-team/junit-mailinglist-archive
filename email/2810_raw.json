It&#39;s\nunderstandable that your needs would differ and you would need to &quot;bend&quot;\njunit to make this work. Here at Terraspring, we have also made considerable\nenhancements in order to use it for integration testing. But we have\nseparated out our unit tests from our integration tests because they often\nhave different needs.\n\nchris\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Berin Loritsch [mailto:bloritsch@...]\nSent: Tuesday, October 02, 2001 12:28 PM\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: Re: [junit] Tangled design (Re: Test framework improvement)\n\n\nThe thing to reiterate is that we are testing Components that live in a\nspecific environment, and we must make sure they play nice in that\nenvironment.\nThis makes sure that changes to the environment don&#39;t break the Components,\nand vice versa.  You can&#39;t test that with dummy stuff.\n\nNot all our testcases use this heavy process--Only the testcases that test\nComponents.  We have a lot of helper classes that we test\nindividually--without\nthe extra bulk.\n\nSometime during the test cycle we need to perform the environment tests, so\nI would rather do it with JUnit than with a production system ;).\n\n",
