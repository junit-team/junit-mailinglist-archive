I have\nan accessor method called getUserSession() which is\nbeing called from my AssetManagerTestCase class (which\nextends CMSTestCase). The getUserSession() method is\ndefined in CMSTestCase. \n\nThe setUserSession() method is called within my setUp()\nmethod within CMSTestCase. So the object is being set\nproperly when the setUp() method is called but once my\ntextXXXX() methods start to be executed in my subclass,\nthe object is null.\n\nDoes anyone know why I&#39;m losing the value of this\nobject when my textXXXX() methods are executed.\n\nThank you in advance.\n\n- Bacon -\n\n\n",
