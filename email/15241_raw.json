Runnin=\r\ng TestNG programmatically\n&gt;&gt;is as simple as\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;TestNG tng =3D new TestNG(=\r\n);\n&gt;&gt;tng.addTestClass(...);\n&gt;&gt;tng.addListener(...);\n&gt;&gt;tng.run();\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Gener=\r\nating a temporary XML file in the Eclipse and IDEA plug-ins is a choice\n&gt;&gt;m=\r\nade by their respective authors, and it has pros and cons.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Either way,=\r\n I&#39;m not sure how this implementation detail impacts the user...\n&gt;&gt;Did this=\r\n cause you any trouble?\n&gt;&gt;  \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;   I knew you&#39;d respond... Anyway, it does=\r\n not cause me any trouble \n&gt; except responding to your comments, because I =\r\ndon&#39;t use TestNG. I guess \n&gt; this is mostly because I like existing tools f=\r\nor junit much better \n&gt; (especially look of the reports I get from ant task=\r\ns, cc build and few \n&gt; others)... If I&#39;ll have to write another plugin for =\r\nEclipse to run \n&gt; TestNG, because look of the current one hurt my eyes. :-)=\r\n\n&gt; \n\nAny suggestions are appreciated. We have tried to keep it in the same =\r\nline as JUnit plugin.\n\n&gt;   By the way, did anyone bothered to check the tem=\r\nporary directory after \n&gt; long time of using TestNG?\n\nTemporary directory? =\r\nThe plugin does nothing there. The temp files are created in the project \nd=\r\nirectory (or a better option I have in mind is to move them in the output d=\r\nir). However I don&#39;t \nthink this is a real worry as way to many software ar=\r\ne using this solution (take Idea, Acrobat \nReader, etc. as examples).\n\n&gt;   =\r\nAfter all, don&#39;t you think that it is much slower to create temporary \n&gt; fi=\r\nle, especially when you don&#39;t really need it? \n\nIf somebody comes out with =\r\nan example where this file writting is increasing the execution time \ninnex=\r\nplicably I will try to find out some other solution immediately.\n\n&gt; I&#39;d und=\r\nerstand if you \n&gt; would have an action to copy such xml to the clipboard, s=\r\no one can paste \n&gt; it into email or issue tracker...\n&gt; \n\nYou can save it fo=\r\nr later tests or don&#39;t know, submit it to your friend to redo the exactly t=\r\nest you \nhave run.\n\ncheers,\n\n./alex\n--\n.w( the_mindstorm )p.\n\n\n&gt;   regards,=\r\n\n&gt;   Eugene\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been remo=\r\nved]\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo!
