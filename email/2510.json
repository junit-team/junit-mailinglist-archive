So by making<br/>\nall the component variables private, I realize that I am just causing trouble for myself, since it doesn&#39;t hide them after all.  So<br/>\nnowadays I make all my widget memeber variables (JButton, JLabel, JTextField, etc.) pakcage private so that my testing classes can<br/>\naccess them easily.  My other fields are still private.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis has worked out pretty good for me for all the UI testings, but I am just a little bit concerned about the package private<br/>\nvariables.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs there anyone doing the same thing?  Or is there a better solution?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMatt Caswell wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Try JFCUnit for Swing UI stuff....<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sourceforge.net/projects/jfcunit/\">http://sourceforge.net/projects/jfcunit/</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Matt<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; _____<br/>\n&gt; This email and any attachments are confidential and are intended only for<br/>\n&gt; the addressee.
