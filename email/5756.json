For example you should probably have Acceptance Tests.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; So, I know that I will be using a combination of Jtest and<br/>\n&gt; Junit for a long time to come. If you write optimal code<br/>\n&gt; without the need for automated testing tools, then I salute you! :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Who said that the only alternative to not using JTest was to use no<br/>\nautomated testing tool at all?<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, are you developing test-first?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;&gt; I would actually interpret these exceptions as an indication<br/>\n&gt; &gt;of some extra guard conditions and more defensive programming<br/>\n&gt; &gt;needed within the tested code. If a piece of called code<br/>\n&gt; &gt;cannot handle unexpected inputs, then the fault lies with the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;code and not the inputs. :-)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I disagree. If the input violates a precondition, the fault<br/>\n&gt; &gt;lies with the input, by definition.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I wholeheartedly disagree with you. It makes no difference<br/>\n&gt; what your &quot;contract&quot; is between a piece of software and it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; callers, if the software doesn&#39;t check it&#39;s own inputs then<br/>\n&gt; it is at fault.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Mhh, I wasn&#39;t talking about the input to the software, but about the<br/>\ninput from internal components to internal components. Would you agree<br/>\nthat precondition possibly isn&#39;t that critical there?<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards, Ilja</div>",
