Which is my problem - there<br/>\n&gt; isn&#39;t a client solution to this bug - it&#39;s an asynchronous data stream that<br/>\n&gt; is actually a valid sequence of data, it&#39;s just that in *this* scenario the<br/>\n&gt; sequence is erroneous but the actual client code has no way of knowing that,<br/>\n&gt; so unfortunately, JB, it&#39;s not possible to provide an alternate client<br/>\n&gt; implementation.  I like the green-red-yellow bar solution, if only I had the<br/>\n&gt; time...:)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>In that case, just code the client to match the server&#39;s weird behavior, <br/>\nbut include documentation with the tests/production code that makes that <br/>\nclear. Some day, the server will be fixed and you&#39;ll want enough <br/>\ninformation in the code to remind you that you need to fix the client <br/>\naccordingly.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ.
