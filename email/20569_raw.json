Is there a way to\n&gt; differentiate?\n\nA test method in your test-case needs to start with the word &quot;test&quot;\nbut does not need to be named after a method in your test class.  You\ncan call your test methods anything you want, as long as the name\nstarts with &quot;test&quot;.\n\nIn fact, it&#39;s not a great idea to name tests after methods in the\nclass being tested.  If you do so, the name of the test gives no\nuseful information beyond what is already in the class under test.  In\nthe example you give, the reader already knows that your class\ncontains a method called getUser(String) and getUser(int).  A test\ncalled &quot;testGetUser&quot; is merely repeating that information and not\ndescribing what is being tested.\n\nIf you organise and name tests by the methods in the class under test,\nthen each test will need to test many different things: the happy\npath, failure cases, different boundary conditions, etc. This will\nmake the test large, and so hard to read and hard to diagnose when it\nfails.  Also you will not easily be able to test how different methods\nrelate to one another.\n\nSo, it&#39;s better to name a test after the aspect of the class&#39;\nbehaviour that the test is exercising. For example:\ntestFindsExistingUserByName, testGetsExistingUserById,\ntestReturnsNullIfUserNameNotFound,\ntestThrowsExceptionIfUserIdDoesNotExist, testStoresNewUsers, etc.\n\n--Nat\n\n",
