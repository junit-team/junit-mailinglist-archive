We strive for the goal that nothing <br/>\nships without complete automated tests. As a Java shop, we use JUnit.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, we do not use testing as a design tool. We use a spiral model <br/>\nbuilt around testing and design and coding. Some code is written test <br/>\nfirst, some code is tested after it is written. All code is designed <br/>\ninto the software structure before it is committed to source code. As <br/>\nlong as the code is tested before it ships, we are confident that it <br/>\nworks. But we do not do test first design.<br/>\n<br/>\nJim<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJames P.
