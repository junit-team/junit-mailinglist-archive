The test object\n&gt; created during setup turned out to be reused for\n&gt; subsequent tests in the test case, which caused problems\n&gt; arising from old state, until I figured it out.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now, for performance, it only makes sense that a fixture\n&gt; would be reused for each test in a test case class. So I&#39;m\n&gt; not suggesting that the implementation is wrong.\n&gt;\nFor a long time my impression was that an instance of TestCase is\ncreated, and all test methods are invoked on that same instance. The\nreason I thought this was that it seemed like the natural way to do\nit to me, plus it justified the existence of setUp. Given fixtures\nare usually instance data, a method like setUp is needed only if you\nare going to reuse the same instance on multiple test methods, and\nsome of those test methods may destroy the fixture.\n\nWhile looking through JUnit&#39;s source code, I discovered that JUnit\ncreates a new instance for each test method when it runs. So then I\ngot to wondering what setUp was really there for, because if you are\ngoing to create a new TestCase instance for each test method, then\nyou could use the constructor to initialized the fixture.\n\nLast year I created a testing toolkit similar to JUnit, Artima\nSuiteRunner, that also serves as a JUnit runner to run JUnit test\nsuites. What I ended up doing in SuiteRunner was running all the test\nmethods on the same Suite instance, calling setUpFixture and\ntearDownFixture before and after each test method. SuiteRunner is\nfree and open source:\n\nhttp://www.artima.com/suiterunner/\n\nI&#39;m curious if anyone out there has some kind of dependency on\nJUnit&#39;s approach of creating a new TestCase instance for each test\nmethod. \n\n&gt; But I read the docs at the main site, and I&#39;ve been following\n&gt; these threads for quite a while, and still I had a dead-wrong\n&gt; impression of what&#39;s going on.\n&gt; \n&gt; For example, in the FAQ, q2 &quot;How do I use a text fixture?&quot;\n&gt; says:\n&gt;    &quot;Each test runs in its own test fixture to isolate tests from the\n&gt;    changes made by other tests. Because the tests are isolated,\n&gt;    they can be run in any order.... The JUnit framework\n&gt;    automatically invokes the setUp() method before each test is\n&gt;    run and the tearDown() method after each test is run.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Now for &quot;test&quot;, I was reading &quot;test *method*&quot;. As in testX(),\n&gt; testY(). But my recent epiphany suggests that I should have\n&gt; been reading it as &quot;test *case*&quot;, as in &quot;test-case class&quot;. And\n&gt; since the example shows a single test case class, with multiple\n&gt; test methods in it, it was easy to make that assumption.\n&gt; \n&gt; Note:\n&gt; In general, I&#39;m not much fond of the name, &quot;TestCase&quot;, because\n&gt; to me that represents a single test. Since a TestCase class can\n&gt; actually have multiple test methods, the name &quot;TestFixture&quot; is\n&gt; probably more appropriate. But be that as it may...\n&gt; \n&gt; It appears to me that the word &quot;test&quot; is badly overloaded in the\n&gt; docs, meaning at various times, test method, test case, and\n&gt; potentially even test suite.\n&gt; \n&gt; The best way to eliminate confusion that I can see is to do a\n&gt; global search on &quot;test &quot;, and replace with one of the hyphenated\n&gt; words &quot;test-method&quot;, &quot;test-case&quot;, or &quot;test-suite&quot;, as appropriate.\n\nI too was confused by JUnit&#39;s overloading of the word test. There&#39;s a\nTest interface, and a both TestCase and a TestSuite implement Tests.\nSo it looks conceptually like test cases and test suites are two\nkinds of tests. But test methods also seem to be tests. I wasn&#39;t sure\nwhat JUnit&#39;s notion of the concept of &quot;test&quot; was by looking at the\nAPI or reading the articles.\n\nOne thing I tried hard to do in SuiteRunner was have a clearly but\nabstractly defined notion of &quot;test.&quot; The only place the word test\nshows up in the API is in testX, testY methods and 4 Reporter\nmethods: testStarting, testSucceeded, testFailed, testAborted. A test\nmethod is one kind of conceptual test that can be reported via the 4\nReporter methods, but not the only kind.\n\nI also tried to be clear about what a &quot;suite&quot; was. There&#39;s a class\nSuite that represents the concept of suite, which is simply a\ncollection of conceptual tests. Typically people will subclass Suite\nand add test methods -- that&#39;s one kind of suite. But once again, it&#39;s\nnot the only kind of Suite. I have a JUnitSuite internal to the\npackage that I use to run JUnit test suites. That&#39;s another kind of\nconceptual suite that is represented by a sublcass of Suite.\n\n\n",
