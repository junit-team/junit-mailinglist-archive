I would<br/>\nlike to keep test data separate from the test code. I could see this test<br/>\ndata being read from an XML file, or quite possibly being retrieved from a<br/>\ndatabase via JDBC, or both. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m wondering if there has been any discussion on this, or if anyone knows<br/>\nof any extensions that have already &quot;invented the wheel&quot; in this area. I&#39;ve<br/>\nlooked at JXUnit, but it seems as if the learning curve is a bit too much<br/>\nfor me to take it on right now. <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks, <br/>\nBill Laird<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, if there are any yahoo groups administrators reading this... please<br/>\ntake my membership status from &quot;pending&quot; to &quot;approved&quot; in the yahoo<br/>\ngroups... thanks.</div>",
