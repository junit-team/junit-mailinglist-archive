You&#39;ve implemented your feature. The test<br/>\n&gt; fails... Why?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Did I say not to use a debugger to debug? I don&#39;t think I did. I said<br/>\nthat I think the advice to always run the debugger on every line of<br/>\ncode one writes (as quoted from Code Complete) is not applicable when<br/>\none does test first programming.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; * You&#39;ve inherited some code from someone. It&#39;s badly named, barely <br/>\n&gt; commented, undocumented, and there are no unit tests. What does it<br/>\n&gt; do?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Of course, when the assumed test first approach (which I *thought* I<br/>\nexplicitly stated) is missing, a debugger may be helpful. I&#39;ve actually<br/>\nfound it more useful to convert the untested code by adding tests and<br/>\ndesign by contract assertions.<br/>\n<br/>\nDebuggers are not inherently evil. Personally, I find little use for<br/>\nthem, but they are not inherently evil. I recognize that my personal<br/>\nlack of desire or need for a debugger does not mean that everyone else<br/>\nshould share my attitude. Nonetheless, I find that the Code Complete<br/>\nadvice (practically a demand) to always run a debugger on every line of<br/>\ncode one writes is simply inappropriate in a test first design.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards,<br/>\n<br/>\nRob<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nFind the one for you at Yahoo!
