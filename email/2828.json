It&#39;s worse for use, since we have<br/>\na support package named &quot;assert&quot; which all of our packages depend on, so<br/>\nwe can&#39;t just deprecate a single method.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt always amazes me when folks go through the trouble to create a nice,<br/>\nobject oriented language with hierarchical namespaces and can&#39;t figure<br/>\nout how to add a feature without modifying the syntax.<br/>\n&lt;/rant&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nOK, I feel a little better.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Wed, 3 Oct 2001, Green, Noah wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Preliminary research by me and co-workers indicates that Sun is adding an<br/>\n&gt; assertion facility to JDK 1.4.  If this happens the way it says in the<br/>\n&gt; documentation, &quot;assert&quot; will become a reserved keyword in the Java language.<br/>\n&gt; Here is the Sun page detailing the new assertion facility:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/docs/guide/lang/assert.html\">http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/docs/guide/lang/assert.html</a><br/>\n&gt; Note that it seems this is already in the beta of JDK 1.4.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The document also details ways of turning off assertions, including the fact<br/>\n&gt; that you must use a special setting at compile time in order<br/>\n&gt; for assertions to work at all:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/docs/guide/lang/assert.html#compiling\">http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/docs/guide/lang/assert.html#compiling</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The question is whether not using this compile-time setting frees up the<br/>\n&gt; &quot;assert&quot; keyword for use as a method name.  My fear is that it<br/>\n&gt; does not.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This could definitely cramp our style, to put it mildly.
