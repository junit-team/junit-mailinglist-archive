Instead, talk about what\n&gt; &gt; you are doing: automatic test generation. If you take a look at\n&gt; &gt; Agitar&#39;s marketing material\n&gt; &gt; (http://www.agitar.com/solutions/business/create_junit_tests.html),\n&gt; &gt; they&#39;re not talking about TDD either--because automatic test\n&gt; &gt; generation and TDD are simply two unrelated things.\n&gt;\n&gt; In fact the German marketing material once mentioned TDD, which made\n&gt; them lose a lot of credibility in my eyes...\n&gt;\n\nWhich is why they don&#39;t say that any more.  :)\n\nBut for people who don&#39;t practice TDD this is a difficult distinction:\n if you have a failing test before you write the code, why isn&#39;t that\nenough to be TDD?\n\nI *think* what Jimm is talking about doing is generating a test from\nthe comment before the implementation is written, so you would have a\nfailing test before the body of the code was there. Similarly our\n(Agitar) marketing people had the feeling that if our product  would\nlet you write a failing test in advance of the code that was TDD,\nright?\n\nThe explanation I&#39;ve used is to distinguish between TDD in the small\n(or test-first) and TDD in the large.\n\nI might find a bug, write a failing test for the bug, and the fix the\nbug.  That&#39;s would be test-first programming  (or TDD in the small).\nIt&#39;s a good thing to do, but the tests aren&#39;t driving my design.\n\nIsn&#39;t trying to make this distinction clearer what drove people to\nchange the name from Test First Development  --&gt; TDDevelopement --&gt;\nTDDesign --&gt; BDDesign?  Gotta be a FAQ on this somewhere...\n\nJtf\n\n-- \n\nhttp://www.developertesting.com/\n\n",
