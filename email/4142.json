Everyone I&#39;ve shown it to has wanted their own copy&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe book has several chapters on JUnit not to mention JUnit, HTTPUnit,<br/>\nCactus, Ant and more.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the complete review from Frank Carver go to:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.javaranch.com/cgi-bin/ubb/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic&f=49&t=000\">http://www.javaranch.com/cgi-bin/ubb/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic&f=49&t=000</a><br/>\n191<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have any comments on the book, there is a forum on JavaRanch at:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.javaranch.com/cgi-bin/ubb/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic&f=49&t=000\">http://www.javaranch.com/cgi-bin/ubb/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic&f=49&t=000</a><br/>\n191<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease share you experiences with the book or share you experiences with<br/>\nusing the tools (JUnit, Ant, et al) to do automated testing and continuous<br/>\nintegration.<br/>\n<br/>\nA small comment about the review...<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree with Frank that the book is for more than just developers that are<br/>\ndoing XP (XPers). I state this several times in the book. However, Id like<br/>\nto add...<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are following the XP development process and you are doing J2EE<br/>\ndevelopment, then you especially need the tools described in this book. This<br/>\nis because XP relies heavily on automated testing, and continuous<br/>\nintegration. JUnit, which is heavily covered in this book, was designed and<br/>\nco-created by the father of the XP process--Kent Beck.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is what one J2EE XP developer wrote about the book...<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I have been struggling with turning XP methodology into a solid development<br/>\nprocess. We&#39;ve had some success at my company but most times we&#39;ve met<br/>\nfrustrations primarily because we were trying to teach old tools new<br/>\ntricks.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Java Tools for XP has made a big difference for us. My team has been able<br/>\nto use the tools described in this book to actually DO unit testing, and<br/>\nwe&#39;ve already automated a significant portion of our testing and deployment<br/>\nprocesses. Its also let us make a good case for open source tools at my<br/>\ncompany.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Overall I definitely recommend this book as the first book to make XP<br/>\nreal.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI receive a lot of email that states similar things. If you are doing XP and<br/>\nJava (especially J2EE), then the tools described in this book are essential.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again.<br/>\n<br/>\nRick Hightower<br/>\nDirector of Development<br/>\neBlox, Inc.<br/>\n<br/>\neBlox Tucson<br/>\n<br/>\n*******************************************<br/>\n* Check out my new book!:                 *<br/>\n* Java Tools for Extreme Programming:     *<br/>\n* Mastering Open Source Tools,            *<br/>\n* including Ant, JUnit, and Cactus        *<br/>\n*******************************************<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.rickhightower.com/JavaXPToolkit/\">http://www.rickhightower.com/JavaXPToolkit/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nBuy it at Amazon:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/047120708X/rickhightower-20\">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/047120708X/rickhightower-20</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThe book was written by members of the eBlox team!</div>",
