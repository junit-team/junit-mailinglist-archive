The test could fail at any one of these three points.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour suggestion of cleaning up code though made me look at the<br/>\ntransactional method I was testing though...it turns out I was missing<br/>\na rollback() call, so thanks!  But that still doesn&#39;t solve the<br/>\nproblem I have with three points of failure within my test.  If you<br/>\nhave any ideas as to how to get around this, I&#39;m all ears.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Brian<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Jason Rogers&quot; &lt;jacaetevha@f...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Could you not use the opportunity to clean up your code such that<br/>\nyou<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t need to visually inspect the DB?
