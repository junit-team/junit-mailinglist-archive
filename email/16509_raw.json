But we can think of three good reasons why this is undesirable: \n    \n   It is necessary to set up all the client JNDI properties in the test cases, making it a pain to run against several different test servers.   \n   If your production clients are servlets running inside the app server, your tests could be affected by being run in a different execution environment.   \n   It is not possible to unit test your non-EJB web-application components. \n  thank u\n  swetha\n  \n\n&quot;J.
