Frens wrote:\n\n&gt; The problem now is a missing step in Joe&#39;s &quot;algorithm&quot;. I&#39;d add a step:\n&gt; \n&gt; 3.5. If enough teach it, teaching materials get produced.\n&gt; \n&gt; While this step is implicit in steps 4 and 5, I think *right now* it&#39;s\n&gt; the sticking point in the process, and so I&#39;m going to make the step\n&gt; explicit.\n&gt; \n&gt; To my knowledge, no Java or C++ introductory textbooks describe or use\n&gt; JUnit. There are some excellent books on JUnit and TDD, but they&#39;re\n&gt; written for reasonably experienced programmers. We need materials for\n&gt; the beginning programmer. My CS 1 lab manual (which uses JUnit\n&gt; everywhere, all the time) is currently just for private use; I am\n&gt; planning to get it published somehow, somewhere. I hope to do the same\n&gt; to my PL materials.\n\nI had plans to start a book on teaching OOP entirely through tests and \nTDD, but then I started to suffer some serious burnout and I have put \nthat plan to the side for now. I strongly believe such a book would be \nvaluable, either as a fieldguide for teachers of all kinds, from \nconsultants and mentors to university instructors. I had hoped to have \nsuch a thing out in 2008, but I don&#39;t know whether that will happen.\n\nTake care.\n-- \nJ. B.
