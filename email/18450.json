I&#39;ve found TDD to be a good teaching <br/>\ntool in itself. The book introduces OO design concepts throughout (not <br/>\nin a heavy-handed fashion, however), my attempt to make a more seamless <br/>\nlearning experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost programmers learn Java separately from OO concepts. Most Java <br/>\nbooks, sadly, teach it largely from a syntactical standpoint. Few books <br/>\ndo a good job of both. Same with TDD--new programmers learn Java&#39;s <br/>\nsyntax of, then come back and have to rethink how to construct their <br/>\ncode. Seems wasteful to me. I see the pain constantly from old dogs <br/>\n(like myself)--it&#39;s a real struggle to change your approach to <br/>\ndeveloping software after so many years of ingraining code construction <br/>\ntechniques.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgile Java still uses JUnit 3.8 (it was written mostly in 2004, and <br/>\nfirst appeared in Feb 2005), but (a) JUnit 4 is a reasonably easy <br/>\ntransition, (b) most programmers will need and want to know both for a <br/>\nwhile yet, and (c) the tool ain&#39;t the thing--I&#39;d also like to think that <br/>\nsomeone could quickly adapt the code in the book to TestNG. Agile Java <br/>\nhasn&#39;t sold gobs of copies, although it got some very good reviews. I <br/>\nthink that&#39;s because it was at least a year ahead of Java 5 starting to <br/>\ntake off, which it seems to have finally been starting to do this year.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing I&#39;m pretty proud of is how the book is crafted to introduce as <br/>\nfew &quot;forward references&quot; as possible, and how it emphasizes OO <br/>\ndevelopment over procedural. I don&#39;t talk about arrays ([]) until pretty <br/>\nfar into the book.<br/>\n<br/>\nJB, your best strategy is to probably buy a few thousand copies. That <br/>\nway no one will know if you ended up rewriting it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think there&#39;s a market for an &quot;agile ruby...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nJeff<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nLangr Software Solutions<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://langrsoft.com\">http://langrsoft.com</a><br/>\nAgile Java: Crafting Code With Test-Driven Development<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJ.

I <br/>\n&gt; haven&#39;t read Jeff&#39;s from beginning to end. I think we probably have <br/>\n&gt; similar content in spots, but slightly different goals. Part of me wants <br/>\n&gt; to read it to make sure I&#39;m not rewriting it; part of me wants to avoid <br/>\n&gt; it so that I don&#39;t subconsciously rewrite it. I don&#39;t know how to deal <br/>\n&gt; with it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Jeff, maybe we should talk about my idea and you can tell me whether I&#39;d <br/>\n&gt; be rewriting your book. I feel no need to do that.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In the worst case, I would write mine in another language, which I was <br/>\n&gt; probably going to have to do, anyway.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
