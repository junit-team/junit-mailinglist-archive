Unit tests often test the interplay of two or \nthree\n&gt; methods, or even of several objects. You can&#39;t do this (effectively)\n&gt; with embedded assertions.\n\nIf you use Design by Contract then the implementation can be checked \nby \nthe compiler to be valid or not. No JUnit needed. Focus on writing\nproper contracts instead of proper tests.\n\n&gt; Do you have a pointer?\nI don&#39;t know what you mean.\n\n&gt; That&#39;s wrong, as others already stated.\n\nBut how will you test a method which returns nothing?\n\n&gt; Asserts are even less a guarantee. Asserts need to be executed to be\n&gt; effective - if you don&#39;t have external code invoking them in a well\n&gt; directed manner, they will not be of any use until in the production\n&gt; environment.\n\nIn my following posting I favor Design by Contract instead of just \nusing\nassert statements. I replied to myself. Read the thread when it \nappears.\n\n&gt; If you really prefer this way, it wouldn&#39;t be too hard to include \nthe\n&gt; unit tests into your production code. Most people seem to prefer to\n&gt; seperate the two.\n\nI prefer Design by Contract. Most people don&#39;t know that paradigma.\n\n&gt; Junit doesn&#39;t force you to develop test-driven at all.\n\nIt suggests it strongy I think. Otherwise the synchronisation of code \nand test is endangered.\n\n&gt; You might fear that it is. In practice, it doesn&#39;t seem to be that \nway.\n\nIf you use TDD in its intended form than you lose time. Thats my \nopinion.\n\n&gt; minutes. There are even tools to automate this. My IDE shows me \nwether I\n&gt; run the tests since the last code change, and an integration server\n&gt; emails me if I broke a test nevertheless.\n\nStill much work. I prefer to concentrate on code and not on test \nquality.\n\n&gt; So, did that help?\n\nYes.\n\nUsing Design by Contract is in a way a medium between implementation \nand \ntests. It is not as abstract as the implementation but not so \nconcrete \nas the tests. Read my second thread (I replied to myself).\n\n\n\n",
