I was looking at Spring a little today and\nnoticed they had a PropertiesFactoryBean. If I can convince my\nmanagers to let me use Spring I could do something like:\n\n&lt;bean id=&quot;appProperites&quot; class=&quot;package.AppProperties&quot;&gt;\n   &lt;property name=&quot;source&quot;&gt;\n      &lt;bean class=&quot;org.springframework...PropertiesFactoryBean&quot;&gt;\n         &lt;property name=&quot;location&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;value&gt;classpath:app.properties&lt;/value&gt;\n         &lt;/property&gt;\n      &lt;/bean&gt;\n   &lt;/property&gt;\n&lt;/bean&gt;\n\n&lt;bean id=&quot;otherBean&quot; class=&quot;MyBean&quot;&gt;\n   &lt;property name=&quot;appProperties&quot;&gt;\n      &lt;ref local=&quot;appProperties&quot;/&gt;\n   &lt;/property&gt;\n&lt;/bean&gt;\n\nWith this, your suggestion of injecting the AppProperties into the\ndependant objects becomes a breeze, making my testing life easier. I\ncan create a Properties object in my setUp() and set it into the\nAppProperties, then set the AppProperties into my other objects.\n\nThanks again for the reply.\n\nMichael.\n\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Jeff Grigg&quot; &lt;jeffgrigg@c...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; --- &quot;Michael&quot; &lt;mkoss917@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; [...] a class called AppProperties. This class has a lot\n&gt; &gt; of static methods on it for loading properties files and\n&gt; &gt; getting properties back out:\n&gt; &gt; [...]\n&gt; &gt; This scenario is not very testable. I like the idea of a\n&gt; &gt; static class to pull application properties from, but it\n&gt; &gt; makes testing more difficult. I could load the AppProperties\n&gt; &gt; object in the setUp (that is my solution to get it working\n&gt; &gt; until I get better suggestions), but it seems like the app\n&gt; &gt; should be designed a little differently.\n&gt; \n&gt; The AppProperties methods could use a private static member to do \n&gt; the detailed work.  And then you could use MockObject, during \n&gt; testing, to control the static member object&#39;s behavior.\n&gt; \n&gt; This can quickly lead to AppProperties being a Singleton.  That&#39;s \n&gt; OK; the tests can swap in a MockObject in setUp and clear or reset \n&gt; it on tearDown.\n&gt; \n&gt; Singleton is not ideal, but it can be refactored later to remove the \n&gt; Singleton-ness.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; How would something like this be handled in IoC (DI) projects? \n&gt; \n&gt; Other objects would accept an AppProperties instance in their \n&gt; constructor or in a &quot;set&quot; method, and keep it in a local variable.  \n&gt; You can migrate from Singleton to this pattern, over time.\n\n\n\n",
