All it takes is a database and distributed<br/>\ncomputing (finding a distributed object is expensive) to blow it out<br/>\nof the water in my opinion.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, thanks for all the replies!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;alpanhell&quot; &lt;alpanhell@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Hello,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve just started using junit and I have a question about usage.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m a bit concerned that I&#39;m not understanding something that seems<br/>\n&gt; pretty integral to the design of junit.  setUp() and tearDown() are<br/>\n&gt; called before and after every test, yet in all my TestCase&#39;s I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; creating I&#39;m finding no place where I need the same setup and teardown<br/>\n&gt; before every test within that TestCase.  I can&#39;t think of very many<br/>\n&gt; scenarios where this would be useful, yet I&#39;m finding tons of places<br/>\n&gt; where I need a one time setup and teardown for the whole TestCase.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Am I missing something here?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; thanks!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; allen </span></blockquote></div>",
