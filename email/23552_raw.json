We code in the\nlatest version of Java using NetBeans 6.9.1.  I was able to generate the\nboilerplate JUnit class for a class I&#39;m developing (source class: Angle;\ntest class: AngleTest) and had some questions just from playing around\nwith it for a few minutes yesterday:\n\n1. It seems that since NB has built-in JUnit support (i.e. Run File), I\ndon&#39;t need to have an associated Main class under the Test Packages. \nTrue or false?\n\n2. If I do decide to use a Main class as my test harness for my JUnit\nclasses, I assume I have to declare an instance of the test class.  True\nor false?\n\n3. Furthermore, if I were to instantiate the test class and run it under\nmy Main, wouldn&#39;t I basically have to make a call to each test* method\nexplicitly?  It seems like &quot;Run File&quot; does that for me.\n\n4. I was able to just do &quot;Run File&quot; on AngleTest.java and it ran for me\nin a split screen window at the bottom of NB.  Kind of cool - gives me\npass/fail and TTE (time to execute) stats.  I noticed, however, that\neverything failed because JUnit by default puts in some boilerplate\nlines of code:\n\n- a line to compare the actual result with the expected result of a\nmethod invocation (this only happens sometimes, not on all methods such\nas a void print())\n- a call to assertEquals() on both operands to make sure they match\n- a comment that tells me to review the generated code and remove the\ndefault call to fail()\n- the call to fail() all of the time\n\nThe main questions I have about this arrangement are:\n\n5. Am I supposed to go ahead and customize the values and/or code in the\nauto-generated test methods to test what I want?  What&#39;s the better\napproach: Add more code for more test cases inside the method, or keep\nchanging the existing code and re-running it until I&#39;m satisfied with\nthe test results?\n\nHere&#39;s an example method from AngleTest (testing the rad2deg() method):\n\n     /**\n      * Test of rad2deg method, of class Angle.\n      */\n     @Test\n     public void testRad2deg() {\n         System.out.println(&quot;rad2deg&quot;);\n         double rad = (Math.PI/2);     // NOTE: Changed from default 0.0\n         double expResult = 90.0;      // NOTE: Changed from default 0.0\n         double result = Angle.rad2deg(rad);\n         assertEquals(expResult, result, 0.0);\n     }\n\n6. If I deliberately set the result and expResult to be two different\nthings and also remove the call to fail(), will assertEquals() take care\nof raising a flag saying, &quot;Hey dummy, your results didn&#39;t match!&quot;?\n\n7. What happens if I set a value for the angle in degrees and make a\ncall to something like setDegrees(value)?  How can that even fail anyway\n(i.e. what&#39;s the point of having the test method)?\n\n8. If I just remove the auto-generated calls to fail() as the comment\nsuggests, then how am I going to know if my test is failing or not? \nEssentially what I&#39;m seeing is that I can rig the test however I want,\nwhich is not entirely what I&#39;d like to happen.\n\nMy class under test (CUT) Angle is just that: A class that stores\ndifferent representations of angles (degrees and radians) for my\nproject.  (Please don&#39;t suggest that I use any such existing class\nalready out there...I write all my code from scratch for several\nreasons.)\n\nThanks for your patience...I can&#39;t find any other current appropriate\nforum to ask these questions.  I want to take full advantage of JUnit&#39;s\ncapabilities to help me write unit test cases.\n\nMike\n\nP.S. I realize it would probably be helpful to attach both Angle.java\nand AngleTest.java.  If anyone has a suggestion for what to do about\nthat, I&#39;ll gladly post them.  (Neither class is proprietary.)\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
