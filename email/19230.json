And then setUp() is run immediately before each test<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  method is executed.  That&#39;s with JUnit 3.8.  I can&#39;t speak for version<br/>\n&gt; 4<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  as we haven&#39;t switched yet.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yes, but this doesn&#39;t answer Adrian&#39;s original question... (which I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; always found hard to answer as well).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>People who have been on the list a while have seen some good answers to that<br/>\nquestion, but I&#39;m happy to take another swipe at it.  JUnit is built on the<br/>\nassumption that your tests are cheap to initialize and run.<br/>\n<br/>\n1) If your tests are cheap to initialize and run, then running each test<br/>\nmethod on a distinct instance of a class gives the added benefit of ensuring<br/>\nthat tests are independent.  I have several times had functional tests pass<br/>\nwhen they should have failed, because I&#39;ve forgotten to delete a file<br/>\ncreated in one test before another test runs.  I&#39;m glad that JUnit doesn&#39;t<br/>\nadd in the potential confusion of state changed in one test affecting the<br/>\nnext test.<br/>\n<br/>\n2a) If your tests are not cheap to initialize and run and you&#39;re calling<br/>\nthem unit tests, it&#39;s worth taking a look at whether there&#39;s a way to test<br/>\nwhat the unit under test does without expensive persistent state.  Often,<br/>\nthis thinking results in valuable design insights.<br/>\n<br/>\n2b) If your tests are not cheap to initialize and run because they&#39;re<br/>\nactually integration tests, acceptance tests, or end-to-end system tests,<br/>\nthen you might want state to persist, trading off safety for performance.<br/>\nIn JUnit 3.8, you can use TestSetup for this state, and in JUnit 4, you can<br/>\nuse @BeforeClass with statics, or you can search Google for &quot;JUnit<br/>\nOneInstance.class&quot;, which will give you a solution allowing you to only<br/>\ninstantiate your test class once.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen again, I am in the camp of people who think that maintaining<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; immutable state in tests is not only harmless, it&#39;s actually very<br/>\n&gt; useful.  Which is why TestNG will not reinstantiate your test classes<br/>\n&gt; like JUnit does.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If I couldn&#39;t get my design decoupled enough to run my unit tests without<br/>\nexpensive state, I might also trade off safety for performance the way<br/>\nTestNG does.  With a reasonable object-oriented language, it seems that<br/>\nnever happens for me.<br/>\n<br/>\n   David Saff<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
