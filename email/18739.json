We, at Agitar, have put a lot of effort into the<br/>\nverification scenario but we have not neglected the verification<br/>\nscenario either. We are tackling it on a number of fronts.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne approach is similar to the approach you suggested where you seed<br/>\nthe test generator with some known-to-be-correct cases. The problem<br/>\nwith this approach is that, in the limit, it becomes easier to write<br/>\nthe test manually than to prod the machine into finding the right<br/>\ncase.  If the machine can take these suggestions and riff on them to<br/>\nfind &#39;cases like them&#39; it becomes more interesting though.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother approach is one that David Saff describes in his &quot;The Practice<br/>\nof Theories&quot; (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.tiny.cc/HttFz)\">http://www.tiny.cc/HttFz)</a> paper in which the human<br/>\nproposes hypotheses and the test generator finds examples that confirm<br/>\nthe hypothesis or that prove it to be false.<br/>\n<br/>\nYet another approach - my favorite - is to have the machine generate<br/>\nlots of examples of input-output sets and make it easy for a human<br/>\nreader to review them and spot inconsistencies. Finding smart ways of<br/>\nfiltering down all the possible examples and smart ways of presenting<br/>\nthem to the user are the two main challenges in this approach.<br/>\n<br/>\nMeanwhile, we think there is value in pure regression testing too.<br/>\n<br/>\nKevin<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.junitfactory.com\">http://www.junitfactory.com</a><br/>\nYou send us code.
