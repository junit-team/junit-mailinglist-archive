I&#39;d be leery of a class that generates HTML and sorts. If the<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; sort is an another class, it can be public and far easier to test.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  I&#39;ve always wondered why most developers are highly offended by making<br/>\n&gt;  things more public for purposes of testing<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Here is my take:  for the past twenty years, we have been taught the<br/>\nbenefits of object-oriented programming and encapsulation, at school,<br/>\nin the workplace and in countless books and articles.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe emphasis on testing has only received more visibility in the past<br/>\nfive years, and some of its principles are indeed at odds with some of<br/>\nthe OO knowledge that has been pervading the software industry for two<br/>\ndecades now.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter being told repeatedly that encapsulation was paramount to<br/>\nsoftware quality, it&#39;s not always easy to let this go in favor of<br/>\nanother technique, but I think the message is getting through and that<br/>\nmore and more developers are becoming more aware of the pros and cons<br/>\nbetween &quot;extreme OO&quot; and &quot;pragmatic testing&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn hindsight, I am absolutely shocked that all the teachers I had in<br/>\nschool 20+ years ago that I had so much respect for had absolutely no<br/>\ninclination (and sometimes only contempt) for testing...<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nCédric<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://testng.org\">http://testng.org</a></div>",
