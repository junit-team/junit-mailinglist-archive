E.G. I have a few Fortune Cookies that are stored i=\r\nn an \narray \nof \n&gt; Strings. I&#39;ve written some code that returns them random=\r\nly. \n&gt; What is the best method for testing? i.e. should I be using Mocks?\n&gt;=\r\n If anybody has any good examples or relevant web sites please let \nme \n&gt; k=\r\nnow.\n&gt; \n&gt; Your help is greatly appreciated.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sam.\n&gt;\n\n\nHi all,\nThanks fo=\r\nr your efforts in attempting to answer my question. \n\nI&#39;ll try and be more =\r\nclear:\n\nThe task I&#39;ve been given is meant to introduce me to Junit testing.=\r\n \nSo \nI started simply by writing a few methods that produce a single hard =\r\n\ncoded Fortune Cookie. That was easy to test. \n\nThe next step was to produc=\r\ne a random cookie. This is where it gets \ntricky. I&#39;ve written a basic meth=\r\nod that returns a random fortune \ncookie quote (see below).\n\nString[] fortu=\r\nneCookieQuote =3D new String[] \n{&quot;fortune cookie quote 1&quot;,\n&quot;fortune cookie =\r\nquote 2&quot;,\n&quot;fortune cookie quote 3&quot;,\n&quot;fortune cookie quote 4&quot;};\n\n\tpublic Str=\r\ning getFortuneCookieQuote(){\n\t\tRandom r =3D new Random();\n\t\treturn fortuneC=\r\nookieQuote[r.nextInt(4)];\t\n\t\t\n\t}\n\nAs you can all see it is a simple program=\r\n to create. The question is \nwhat would be the best way to test this? If an=\r\nybody knows of any good \nweb sites that explain testing (e.g. mocks, junit =\r\netc) please let me \nknow.\n\nOnce again your assistance is appreciated.\n\nSam.=\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
