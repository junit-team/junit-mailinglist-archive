Read Goedel.\n\nThe bottom line is that such a metric would have to measure every \nsingle possible path through all legal programs. In order to do that, \nthe measuring program would need to know whether the algorithms in the \nprograms every terminate--- something which Goedel proved is impossible \nin the general case.\n\nCoverage analysis can get close if several metrics are used in \ncombination. Brian Marrick goes through this in detail in The Craft of \nSoftware Testing. But even if a perfect metric were possible, as \nanother poster pointed out, a coverage metric will not tell you if a \nparticular line, expression, or branch is necessary at all or fits into \nthe system as a whole. Test-first does a much better job of eliminating \nunnecessary coverage by eliminating unnecessary code.\n\nUse coverage analysis as a tool to gain insight about what your code \nand tests are doing. Use your wits to determine what tests to add (or \ncode to remove). Train your wits by gaining experience and reading good \nbooks. Nothing will do the job for you.\n\n\n",
