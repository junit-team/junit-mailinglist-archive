B. Rainsberger [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jbr@...\">jbr@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt;Sent: Thursday, September 12, 2002 10:40 AM<br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: [junit] Catching RuntimeExceptions<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;On 2002-09-11 at 11:40 Chappell, Simon P wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&lt;snip&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;My complaint is that you can have valid, thoroughly tested software<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;that complies to all your tests (JUnit-, integration- and acceptance<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;tests) and still have JTest complain about it.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;If Jtest is complaining, then is it REALLY valid and thoroughly tested<br/>\n&gt;&gt;code? I&#39;m not trying to bait you, but if you have a automated code<br/>\n&gt;testing<br/>\n&gt;&gt;tool (let&#39;s be generic here, so no-one thinks that I&#39;m on the ParaSoft<br/>\n&gt;&gt;payroll :-) and it complains about your code then either the tool is<br/>\n&gt;&gt;defective or your code is sub-optimal.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Not necessarily. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Maybe not, but I still think that those are the two most likely reasons.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;If I have a public API, it may be worthwhile to try to interpret the<br/>\n&gt;dozens of RuntimeExceptions that my code may throw, since this would<br/>\n&gt;help my clients decipher the problem. In this case, it would be nice to<br/>\n&gt;use something like JTest to discover all the RuntimeExceptions my<br/>\n&gt;public API might throw.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;If, however, we deal with code deep within our library that the outside<br/>\n&gt;world doesn&#39;t use directly, and if we can be reasonably sure that, for<br/>\n&gt;example, Class A never passes a null reference to Class B, then it<br/>\n&gt;would likely be overkill to worry about what happens when Class B<br/>\n&gt;receives a null reference. As Ron Jeffries would say, if you&#39;re the<br/>\n&gt;only client, then simply don&#39;t pass null! (Loose paraphrase, there.)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think that I have already conceded this point a couple of times yesterday, but I&#39;ll do it again for the record. Agreed. Agreed. Agreed! :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Here is another way of putting it:<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Personally I think that the &#39;exposure&#39; of (mainly) NullPointers by<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;applying generated tests that put nonsense parameter values in<br/>\n&gt;methods<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;does improve the quality of the product.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Agreed. :-)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Well, it can identify issues, but I&#39;m not sure that it improves<br/>\n&gt;quality, since it may lead to a morass of duplication of the form<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    if (blah == null) {<br/>\n&gt;        throw new IllegalArgumentException(&quot;Blah was null.&quot;);<br/>\n&gt;    }<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;That hurts the internal quality of the product.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I would argue that comprehensive guard conditions never hurt the internal quality of the product. Now, I agree that guard conditions are often ugly code, but some of that could be refactored into private methods.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;The motto &#39;Garbage in Garbage out&#39; still applies in this case. As an<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Not agreed. GIGO is only for non-robust code. I think that &quot;Garbage<br/>\n&gt;In&quot;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;should cause appropriate guard conditions to be triggered and an<br/>\n&gt;&gt;appropriate response to be generated NPE or IAE (your choice). For<br/>\n&gt;&gt;anything other than the most trivial of code, I do not want to ever<br/>\n&gt;&gt;contribute to &quot;Garbage Out&quot;. As developers we usually have no control<br/>\n&gt;over<br/>\n&gt;&gt;the many potential ways that our code could be used, but we do have<br/>\n&gt;&gt;control over how it responds.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Once again, a public API is different from code whose only client is<br/>\n&gt;you. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Agreed ... see above.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&lt;snip /&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;This is the concept of &quot;graceful degredation&quot;. A web browser is a very<br/>\n&gt;&gt;good example of this .... a lot of web pages have awful HTML and yet<br/>\n&gt;most<br/>\n&gt;&gt;of them display acceptably, because the browser takes what it&#39;s given<br/>\n&gt;and<br/>\n&gt;&gt;does the best it can with it. A browser cannot throw an exception, but<br/>\n&gt;it<br/>\n&gt;&gt;can try to render what it&#39;s given. All software should do the best it<br/>\n&gt;can<br/>\n&gt;&gt;with what it&#39;s given or when possible reject unacceptable inputs.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I hate this, because the browser just throws away parts of a page, and<br/>\n&gt;it&#39;s not always easy to tell why that happened. It would be better, in<br/>\n&gt;my opinion, if the browser at least complained to a log or something.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I agree that such behaviour should be logged, but the internet exists with the popularity that it has today because a page&#39;s HTML has to be pretty bad before someone can&#39;t surf it. This is a good thing in a browser. Is it a good thing in a public API? Maybe not, but graceful degredation is good to keep in mind when designing such things. (Let&#39;s not forget the Law of Least Suprises either! :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;J. B.
