If you haven&#39;t already read Michael<br/>\nFeather&#39;s Working Effectively With Legacy Code, you&#39;ll likely get a<br/>\nlot out of it.  The short version is: for every hour that you spend<br/>\nwriting tests that have to work around these large dependencies, if<br/>\nyou can find at least another hour to improve the design of the tested<br/>\ncode to reduce those dependencies, the second hour will very often pay<br/>\nitself off fairly quickly.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, can you help me understand the scenario you have in mind?<br/>\nEspecially, are the objects that need to be populated somehow globally<br/>\naccessible, or do you need to somehow pass them into the JUnit test?<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\n   David<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Fri, Apr 30, 2010 at 5:17 AM, cbananth &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cbananth@...\">cbananth@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Hi,<br/>\n&gt; Is it possible to test a runtime scenario using junit? For instance, similar to attaching an eclipse debugger to a running process, attach a junit test suite to an already running JVM?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The reason why I have this doubt is because, I am making changes to a small part of a huge code base, but in order to test the small code change a lot of other objects have to be populated before invoking the test method. Also, attaching to a running process similar to eclipse debugger, would help me simulate run time scenarios and check if expected exceptions are thrown by the method being tested by Junit.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Please get back to me if my question is not clear.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thank you<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Regards<br/>\n&gt; Ananth<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
