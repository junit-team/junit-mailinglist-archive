To clarify, to load a license, I \n&gt; would need to have a saved license. The load license would then verify\n&gt; that the information that was saved was loaded correctly.\n\nThe problem is saving, then loading, then verifying that the loaded\nobject is equal to what was saved (if I understand your reasoning\ncorrectly) just tests that they you can load what you saved.  It\ndoesn&#39;t verify that the format is correct.  Also, the two ate tied\ntogether.\n\nI advise a separate test for each (&quot;advise&quot; because you don&#39;t work for\nme.. if you did, I&#39;d &quot;insist&quot;).  And don&#39;t use real files if you can\nhelp it.  Use a mocked file for each test.  Save to a mock that knows\nwhat *should* be saved, then verify that that is what was saved.  Read\nfrom a fake that will supply a serialized object in the correct\nformat, then verify that the loaded object is correct.  If you&#39;re\nusing Java you can work work with streams and not worry about files at\nall.  If the output format is textual (i.e. not binary) you can simply\nsupply string streams in the test... Mocks can result in cleaner test\ncode, though.\n\nYour milage may vary.\n\nDave\n\n\n",
