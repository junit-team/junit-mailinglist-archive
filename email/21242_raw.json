A BDD framework for Java\n&gt; that takes advantage of JUnit for example for Eclipse integration.\n&gt;\n&gt; We have tests in non-static inner classes of our test classes. These\n&gt; run wonderfully using the @RunWith annotation and our own runner.\n&gt;\n&gt; however, for individual tests, this doesn&#39;t work. What I would like\n&gt; to do is that AllDefaultPossibilitiesBuilder would check whether or\n&gt; not the test class is a non static member class. if it is, then I\n&gt; would grab the runner of the declaring class instead.\n&gt;\n&gt; I made a patch implementing this. I will try to attach it.\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
