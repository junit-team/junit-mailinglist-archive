So I have a chicken egg sort of situation. NB would do the obvious th=\r\ning, i.e., have tests generated from code, so the above doesn&#39;t make any se=\r\nnse as it implies that the code is generated from the test, which is a cool=\r\n idea of the IDE could support it.\n&gt; I have experience using JUnit, so the =\r\nframework itself isn&#39;t in question, but how to apply this methodology withi=\r\nn the IDE format is.\n&gt; Do I have to simply short-circuit the default proces=\r\ns that NB and the JUnit plugin manufacture?\n&gt;\n&gt; thanks in advance for any h=\r\nelp on this,\n&gt; Karl\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!=\r\n Groups Links\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n",
