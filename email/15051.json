So, it would <br/>\n&gt; make sense to have these parameters passed to the test method <br/>\n&gt; (like it <br/>\n&gt; is done in TestNG).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think the performance problems can be solved other ways, and I still like<br/>\nencouraging test isolation by executing tests in separate instances. The<br/>\nJUnit 4 runner creates the instances immediately in advance of invoking the<br/>\ntest method. The current design requires less duplication than passing the<br/>\nparameters to the test methods, since the parameters only appear in the<br/>\nconstructor. It might be better for the @Parameters method to return an<br/>\nIterator, allowing the lazy creation of substantial data structures,<br/>\nhowever.<br/>\n  @Parameters static Iterator&lt;Object[]&gt; data() ...<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   Second limitation is that user don&#39;t have will have to <br/>\n&gt; declaratively <br/>\n&gt; specify test data sets without writing custom @Parameters <br/>\n&gt; method and use <br/>\n&gt; some system property to differentiate between tests. Perhaps <br/>\n&gt; you can add <br/>\n&gt; some &quot;name&quot; property to Parameters annotation, so test runner <br/>\n&gt; can match <br/>\n&gt; this name with declared test data. Such name property would <br/>\n&gt; also allow <br/>\n&gt; to have multiple @Parameters methods and match them with <br/>\n&gt; @Test methods <br/>\n&gt; if you&#39;ll have same name there too. The last would allow to <br/>\n&gt; have several <br/>\n&gt; test methods with different kinds of test parameters without creating <br/>\n&gt; separate test classes (so you&#39;ll have single test class for <br/>\n&gt; class under <br/>\n&gt; testing).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t understand this objection. Can you write an example of what you<br/>\nwould like to see?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   The last thing I&#39;d like to mention is that current <br/>\n&gt; @Parameters methods <br/>\n&gt; won&#39;t scale to large data sets (the same limitation also exists in <br/>\n&gt; TestNG). I&#39;ve seen JUnit3 suite() methods that produced thousands of <br/>\n&gt; test permutations and that required lots of memory memory <br/>\n&gt; when running <br/>\n&gt; tests. So, It think that it would make sense to introduce an <br/>\n&gt; interface <br/>\n&gt; similar to JDBC ResultSet, so test runner can create iterate <br/>\n&gt; trough test <br/>\n&gt; data without loading it completely into memory and also have <br/>\n&gt; option to <br/>\n&gt; get number of tests as well as jump to Nth test. You can also <br/>\n&gt; provide an <br/>\n&gt; adapter that will take Object[][] and provide all that <br/>\n&gt; functionality for <br/>\n&gt; users who don&#39;t want to create test data dynamically.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Would the Iterator version satisfy the need to handle large data sets?<br/>\n<br/>\nSincerely yours,<br/>\n<br/>\nKent Beck<br/>\nThree Rivers Institute</div>",
