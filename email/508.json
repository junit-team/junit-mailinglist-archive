I have been using JBuilder 4 and have only successfully been able to<br/>\nhit break points in the main method (which just ends up taking you to<br/>\nunderlying JUnit code).  In debugging I would like to be able to step<br/>\nthrough the individual tests and step into the actual class that is being<br/>\ntested to see what is going on.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny thoughts?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nBob</div>",
