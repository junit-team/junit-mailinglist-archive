By \nusing Javassist together with JUnit I managed to add a powerful yet \nsimple way of doing declarative (from the test-class) mocking of \ntroublesome classes in the class tree you are about to test. \n\nRead about it here: \nhttp://tobyonrails.blogspot.com/2005/09/junitassist-unfolds-catch-\n22.html\n\nTry it and tell me what you think.\n\nBest regards,\n\nTobias Hill\nCiterus AB\nSweden\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
