The\noriginal comment by DS was in response to another person&#39;s question\nregarding problems using JUnit for testing EJBs.  My text is marked with my\ninitials, CD.  While I will take the advice of DS and have a look at the\nsource, I wanted the group to have access to his opinion, to have feedback\nthat could be used to make JUnit better for the next release.\n\nDS &gt; Junit internals suck. I would love to rewrite it, but don&#39;t\nDS &gt; have the time.\n\nCD &gt; I&#39;ve been told before that the JUnit source code serves as a great \nCD &gt; example for writing good code.  Hence, your statement surprised me.  \nCD &gt; Since you&#39;re a respected developer of a great application server, I \nCD &gt; ask that you cite a few examples to support your statement.  I&#39;d \nCD &gt; really like to hear your side of the story.\n\nDS &gt; Read the source, and you will see what I am talking about.  I believe \nDS &gt; you misunderstood the comments from other people.  JUnit is a good \nDS &gt; example of successful software development and it is also a good\nexample \nDS &gt; of XP development.  The problem with XP is that it is not designed for \nDS &gt; Library software (see the last chapter of the xp book), so it works\ngood \nDS &gt; at what it was designed for, but it is difficult to expand.  They also \nDS &gt; use way too much inheritance and not enough interfaces.  Anyway, just \nDS &gt; read the code and be the judge for yourself.\n\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;   &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\nCraig Demyanovich                      \nSystems Developer\nApogent Technologies\n(269) 544 - 7514\ncdemyanovich@... \n\n",
