For example, how do\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; you express the fact that a test method belongs to the groups\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; &quot;database&quot; and &quot;fast&quot; while another one is in &quot;database&quot; and &quot;slow&quot;?\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; I don&#39;t understand why it&#39;s important to partition fast tests by\n&gt;  &gt; &quot;database&quot; and &quot;not database&quot;. If they&#39;re fast, just run them all! If\n&gt;  &gt; you don&#39;t want to run them, then there must be something wrong with\n&gt;  &gt; them, such as these:\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; * slow\n&gt;  &gt; * require configuration to run correctly\n&gt;  &gt; * hyperactive (gold master, for example)\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; If they&#39;re fast, though, just run them all!\n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s not really about deciding if a database test is fast or if a fast\n&gt; test is a database test.\n&gt; \n&gt; Groups are just a way to describe what a test method does, and like\n&gt; many multidimensional descriptions, you can find all kinds of\n&gt; variations and overlaps or mutual exclusions. For example:\n&gt; \n&gt; @Test(groups = { &quot;database&quot;, &quot;slow&quot;, &quot;win32&quot;, &quot;nightly&quot;, &quot;multicore&quot; })\n&gt; \n&gt; When you get used to test groups, you start to separate mentally the\n&gt; static model (what defines your tests) from their dynamic one (how to\n&gt; run them), a distinction that I have always found unfortunately\n&gt; blurred by the JUnit invocation model.\n\nI guess I&#39;ve been able to tolerate the blurring so far, and that&#39;s the \ndifference. If the blurring has hurt me, I haven&#39;t noticed, and nobody \naround has noticed and cared to speak up about it.\n\n&gt;  &gt; I have yet to be on a project where /anyone/ /ever/ wanted to run &quot;all\n&gt;  &gt; the database tests&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; Really? Is this really what you meant to write? Because this happens\n&gt; very often, in my experience.\n\nExactly what I meant to write. I&#39;ve wanted to run &quot;the slow tests&quot; or \n&quot;the hyperactive tests because of bad configuration code&quot;, but never \n&quot;the database tests&quot;.\n-- \nJ. B.
