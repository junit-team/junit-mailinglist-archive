The Junit++ extension (a.k.a. JUNITPP) which is available \nat junit.org is very helpful for repeating the same tests x number of \ntimes, and you could easily add a wait time to the code that controls \nthe repetition--but I think they&#39;ve only extended the non-GUI \nTestRunner. At the very least, taking a look at JunitPP might be a \nplace to begin heading in the right direction. - DJ\n\n--- In junit@y..., &quot;LECLUSE Dirk (BMB)&quot; &lt;dirk.lecluse@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hello,\n&gt; \n&gt; Was wondering if there exists a JUnit extension that allows JUnit \nto run\n&gt; tests every x minutes (every eg 30 minutes).\n&gt; Preferable this would run in a JUnit GUI like \njunit.swingui.TestRunner, but\n&gt; with the option to check-enable repeatative testing, and specify an \ninterval\n&gt; like every x minutes.\n&gt; \n&gt; Repeatative testing is interesting to check a development that \ndepends on\n&gt; several dependancies (legacy applications) that tend to change over \ntime (eg\n&gt; go down, be modified, etc)\n&gt; \n&gt; I experimented to implement/extend junit.swingui.TestRunner but \nwithout a\n&gt; lot of success so far.\n&gt; \n&gt; Any suggestions are welcomed.\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; \n&gt; Dirk Lecluse\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; **** DISCLAIMER ****\n&gt; \n&gt;      &quot;This e-mail and any attachment thereto may contain \ninformation which is confidential and/or protected by intellectual \nproperty rights and are intended for the sole use of the recipient(s) \nnamed above. \n&gt;      Any use of the information contained herein (including, but \nnot limited to, total or partial reproduction, communication or \ndistribution in any form) by other persons than the designated \nrecipient(s) is prohibited. \n&gt;      If you have received this e-mail in error, please notify the \nsender either by telephone or by e-mail and delete the material from \nany computer&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt;      Thank you for your cooperation.\n&gt; \n&gt; For further information about Proximus mobile phone services please \nsee our website at http://www.proximus.be or refer to any Proximus \nagent.\n\n\n",
