What is it supposed to do with this counter value?\n&gt; \n&gt; ...and is using *that* thing more complex than just having the &#39;get&#39; method? Is it worth the effort?\n&gt; \nIt&#39;s an interesting conunundrum.\n\nAt least one design principle dictates the avoidance of get methods.\nAllen Holub is proponent of that practice, I believe -- the theory\nbeing that you keep sending information to objects until some\nobject has enough information to carry out the desired operation.\n\nOn the other hand, carrying that design principle to its logical\nextreme produces a system that becomes very difficult to test!\n\nEither object introspection or a plethora of call back methods\nwould be needed to verify state, in such a system.\n\nThe only alternative would be to embed test queries in the classes,\nwhere they can examine state. An external test could then invoke\nthe query to ask, &quot;did you pass or fail&quot;?\n\nOf couse, any desire to keep such methods out of the production\nobjects leads to interesting and problematic design issues, but\nit might be worth adding additional methods like:\n    eventNotificationListIncludes(EvenListener el)\n\nThere is no &quot;get&quot; in this system, but the test can still verify\nthat the internal state is as expected, using state-verification\nmethods intended for that purpose.\n\n(Open question: Should such a method return a boolean or throw\nan exception??)\n\n\n\n\n",
