To me, that&#39;s the problem: why would \none be happy with code that only sorta kinda works?\n\n&gt; This is fairly common in my experience, and I was simply arguing that in\n&gt; such cases, TDD might end up introducing extra work.\n\nOf course, if the code doesn&#39;t have to work, then TDD is more effort \nthan you need.\n\n&gt;  &gt; If you postpone your testing a bit, you have: Code v1, Code v2, Code v3,\n&gt;  &gt; Test v0.1, Code v3.1, Test v0.2, Code v3.2, Test v1, Code v3.3, Commit.\n&gt;  &gt; This is because the act of writing the tests exposes flaws in the design\n&gt;  &gt; that make the test difficult to write.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sometimes, sure. Other times, you&#39;re just wasting time writing tests for\n&gt; code that you will throw away.\n\nI think you might be describing some kind of exploratory design by \nwriting code. It looks like you mean you write code, rewrite it to \nimprove the design, rewrite it to improve the design, then check it in. \nIf that&#39;s the case, the TDD is not extra work, it&#39;s less. Here&#39;s why:\n\nIf you don&#39;t to TDD, then you end up reworking code until you like the \ndesign, but then afterwards you need to test it to see whether it works. \nEither you test it manually, say in a debugger, which is slow; or you \ntest it with printf()s, which generally requires you to add them at the \nright place, check the results, then remove them, which is slow; or you \nadd automated tests, which is often slow because you probably (1) wrote \ntoo much code at once and (2) wrote code that isn&#39;t easily tested. As a \nresult, you usually (p &gt; 0.5) rewrite the code to make it testable, then \nadd tests.\n\nIf you do TDD, then when you write the tests, you are designing before \nyou cast the algorithm into code. You get the opportunity to evaluate \nthe external design before you fill in the details. By refactoring in \nsmall steps, you get the opportunity to improve the internal design as \nyou fill in the details, with the freedom to change the internal design \nwith confidence, rather than dipping into the debugger every few \nminutes. You finally end up with code that is both well-tested and \nwell-designed, and almost certainly in less time than it takes to write \nthe code first, be happy with the design, then test is afterwards.\n\nBut, of course, if you don&#39;t need to test your code, then TDD is more \neffort than not doing TDD. But then, there are two cases:\n\n1. You&#39;re shipping shit, or\n2. You&#39;re not shipping shit, which means you&#39;re a genius, which means \nyou go faster than everyone else, anyway, whether you practise TDD or not.\n\nI just can&#39;t buy the notion that it&#39;s possible to write good, untested \ncode. Show it to me. Where is this good, untested code?\n-- \nJ. B.
