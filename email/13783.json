Or system level tests ?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What proportion of your tests hit a database/file system/network/gui ?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>As a datapoint for comparison: Jena has about 1300 classes and about 4000<br/>\ntests, and running those tests takes about 50s on my machine (a 3GHz Intel<br/>\nbeast with enough memory). We have five developers, but none of us is full-<br/>\ntime on Jena nowadays. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe tests are a mixture of unit and integration tests, and touch the <br/>\nfilesystem a little and the database not at all. Running the database<br/>\ntests (which are a subset of the normal tests with the data store in<br/>\nRDB rather than memory) takes more like 15m with MySQL and comparable <br/>\nor a lot longer with Postgres. (Likely because there&#39;s a complete<br/>\nreset of the DB between each test.) Hence the DB tests get run a lot<br/>\nless often, which is sort-of OK because they&#39;re &quot;just&quot; a storage layer<br/>\nand so long as the DB presents the same (Graph) interface as memory<br/>\ndoes, everthing else should &quot;just work&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nChris &quot;electric hedgehog&quot; Dollin<br/>\nIt&#39;s called *extreme* programming, not *stupid* programming.</div>",
