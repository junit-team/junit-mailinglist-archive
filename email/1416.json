It the developers don&#39;t want to write tests or keep test<br/>\ncases up to date it&#39;s not by mixing prod and test codes in the same<br/>\nlocation that you will find a solution.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would go this way:<br/>\n- option #1 with a cvs tree<br/>\n- regularly check out the production and test code from cvs into a new<br/>\ndirectory and JUnit-test the application.  So you know if prod and test<br/>\ncodes are in sync.<br/>\n- have metrics to see how well you&#39;ve tested your code (# of tests, # of<br/>\nasserts, how well tests cover the code) so you know if developers have<br/>\nwritten test code.<br/>\n- for the release version, check out the prod code into a new directory,<br/>\nbuild the release, give it to the QA.  So you know if developers have<br/>\nwritten the right code.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 2 cents<br/>\n<br/>\n-Vladimir</div>",
