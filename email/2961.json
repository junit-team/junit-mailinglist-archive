Hopefully, it will drastically<br/>\nreduce the &quot;dumb&quot; questions (and many of the smarter ones), and allow us<br/>\nto feel better about ignoring the ones that get through anyway.  And if<br/>\nsomeone asks a dumb question that isn&#39;t covered by the FAQ, a reasoned<br/>\nresponse should go into the FAQ!<br/>\n<br/>\nSuggestions:<br/>\n1. It should include a link to the latest version of the FAQ on the web<br/>\nsomewhere.  That way, older subscribers can keep up to date.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. It should be posted to the list whenever it is updated, similar to<br/>\nmany Usenet FAQs.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Can we PLEASEPLEASEPLEASE include a link to the ESR essay that<br/>\nsomeone posted earlier?  It is much easier to answer questions when the<br/>\nquestions are phrased well, and basic rules of etiquette are followed. <br/>\nOf course, those who ask the worst questions don&#39;t read documentation<br/>\nanyway, but it would feel good.  :}<br/>\n-- <br/>\n<br/>\nDavid Stagner<br/>\n<br/>\nNational Marrow Donor Program<br/>\n3001 Broadway Street NE<br/>\nBroadway Ridge Suite 500<br/>\nMinneapolis, MN  55413<br/>\n<br/>\nEmail: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dstagner@...\">dstagner@...</a></div>",
