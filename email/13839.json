B. Rainsberger<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Agreed, TestNG supports this out of the box, but for every <br/>\n&gt; neat feature TestNG supports out of the box there will be 20 <br/>\n&gt; people crying about this other neat feature it doesn&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; support... <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Uh, that&#39;s quite a bold statement.  I have certainly not heard anything like<br/>\nthis on our mailing-list... <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; it&#39;s for that reason that JUnit doesn&#39;t even try. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My impression is that JUnit doesn&#39;t try simply because its authors didn&#39;t<br/>\nenvision that this feature would one day be needed.  Nothing wrong with<br/>\nthat, you can&#39;t always predict what the future will hold.<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; One big difference between the two is that JUnit assumes that <br/>\n&gt; the test suite is computed before the first test runs, and I <br/>\n&gt; admit that is a fundamental and useful difference between <br/>\n&gt; JUnit and TestNG. I suppose once TestNG has a large user base <br/>\n&gt; we&#39;ll have a clearer idea how important that is. (I know that <br/>\n&gt; day is approaching!)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Thanks for the vote of confidence :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; You could say that marker annotations are &quot;merely&quot; syntax <br/>\n&gt; sugar replacing marker interfaces. That said, syntax sugar <br/>\n&gt; done well is very nice. Also, annotations were /designed/ for <br/>\n&gt; this kind of thing, and interfaces weren&#39;t. Interfaces are <br/>\n&gt; not metadata, even if they can be metadata. My butter knife <br/>\n&gt; can be a screwdriver, but that doesn&#39;t mean I should avoid <br/>\n&gt; buying a screwdriver.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well put.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nCédric<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://beust.com/weblog\">http://beust.com/weblog</a></div>",
