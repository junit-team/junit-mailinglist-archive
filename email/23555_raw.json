We code in the\n&gt; latest version of Java using NetBeans 6.9.1. I was able to generate the\n&gt; boilerplate JUnit class for a class I&#39;m developing (source class: Angle;\n&gt; test class: AngleTest) and had some questions just from playing around\n&gt; with it for a few minutes yesterday:\n&gt;\n&gt; 1. It seems that since NB has built-in JUnit support (i.e. Run File), I\n&gt; don&#39;t need to have an associated Main class under the Test Packages.\n&gt; True or false?\n&gt;\nWhat&#39;s a Main Class? I&#39;ve never, ever used one ;-)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; 2. If I do decide to use a Main class as my test harness for my JUnit\n&gt; classes, I assume I have to declare an instance of the test class. True\n&gt; or false?\n&gt;\n\nNo, you would bypass the main class, instantiate the specific class (Angle) \ndirectly and invoke methods on the instance.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; 3. Furthermore, if I were to instantiate the test class and run it under\n&gt; my Main, wouldn&#39;t I basically have to make a call to each test* method\n&gt; explicitly? It seems like &quot;Run File&quot; does that for me.\n&gt;\n\nI don&#39;t use NB so I don&#39;t know how NB does it. Normally, JUnit calls the test \nmethod and the test method calls the method under test. No main involved anywhere.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; 4. I was able to just do &quot;Run File&quot; on AngleTest.java and it ran for me\n&gt; in a split screen window at the bottom of NB. Kind of cool - gives me\n&gt; pass/fail and TTE (time to execute) stats. I noticed, however, that\n&gt; everything failed because JUnit by default puts in some boilerplate\n&gt; lines of code:\n&gt;\n&gt; - a line to compare the actual result with the expected result of a\n&gt; method invocation (this only happens sometimes, not on all methods such\n&gt; as a void print())\n&gt; - a call to assertEquals() on both operands to make sure they match\n&gt; - a comment that tells me to review the generated code and remove the\n&gt; default call to fail()\n&gt; - the call to fail() all of the time\n&gt;\n\nJust because some tool generated some code doesn&#39;t mean that the code is the \nright code; read an introductory book on writing unit tests, preferably using \nTest-Driven Development.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; The main questions I have about this arrangement are:\n&gt;\n&gt; 5. Am I supposed to go ahead and customize the values and/or code in the\n&gt; auto-generated test methods to test what I want? What&#39;s the better\n&gt; approach: Add more code for more test cases inside the method, or keep\n&gt; changing the existing code and re-running it until I&#39;m satisfied with\n&gt; the test results?\n&gt;\n&gt; Here&#39;s an example method from AngleTest (testing the rad2deg() method):\n&gt;\n&gt; /**\n&gt; * Test of rad2deg method, of class Angle.\n&gt; */\n&gt; @Test\n&gt; public void testRad2deg() {\n&gt; System.out.println(&quot;rad2deg&quot;);\n&gt; double rad = (Math.PI/2); // NOTE: Changed from default 0.0\n&gt; double expResult = 90.0; // NOTE: Changed from default 0.0\n&gt; double result = Angle.rad2deg(rad);\n&gt; assertEquals(expResult, result, 0.0);\n&gt; }\n&gt;\n&gt; 6. If I deliberately set the result and expResult to be two different\n&gt; things and also remove the call to fail(), will assertEquals() take care\n&gt; of raising a flag saying, &quot;Hey dummy, your results didn&#39;t match!&quot;?\n&gt;\nYes.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; 7. What happens if I set a value for the angle in degrees and make a\n&gt; call to something like setDegrees(value)? How can that even fail anyway\n&gt; (i.e. what&#39;s the point of having the test method)?\n&gt;\nYou tell me! Your tests should specify what the software is supposed to do, not \nthe other way around.\n\n&gt; 8. If I just remove the auto-generated calls to fail() as the comment\n&gt; suggests, then how am I going to know if my test is failing or not?\n&gt; Essentially what I&#39;m seeing is that I can rig the test however I want,\n&gt; which is not entirely what I&#39;d like to happen.\n&gt;\nSee previous question.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; My class under test (CUT) Angle is just that: A class that stores\n&gt; different representations of angles (degrees and radians) for my\n&gt; project. (Please don&#39;t suggest that I use any such existing class\n&gt; already out there...I write all my code from scratch for several\n&gt; reasons.)\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks for your patience...I can&#39;t find any other current appropriate\n&gt; forum to ask these questions. I want to take full advantage of JUnit&#39;s\n&gt; capabilities to help me write unit test cases.\n&gt;\n\nYou would not need to ask all these questions if you had read the introductory \ntutorial on JUnit at least.. Just playing with the NB menu options doesn&#39;t teach \nyou everything you need to know. Learning how to write good unit tests is \nsomething that will take more than a few minutes or hours.\n\nBest wishes,\n\nGerard\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Mike\n&gt;\n&gt; P.S. I realize it would probably be helpful to attach both Angle.java\n&gt; and AngleTest.java. If anyone has a suggestion for what to do about\n&gt; that, I&#39;ll gladly post them.
