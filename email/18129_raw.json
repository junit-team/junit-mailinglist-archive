Ant has different formatters you can use to create junit\nreports from a junit run which all derive from a common base class,\neasily overrideable, and customizable in the junitreport ant task.\n\nJUnitResultFormatter (Apache Ant API)\nhttp://freak.homeip.net/doc/ant-1.6.5/manual/api/org/apache/tools/ant/taskdefs/optional/junit/JUnitResultFormatter.html\n\nJUnit Ant Task\nhttp://ant.apache.org/manual/OptionalTasks/junit.html\n\nCurrently we are using a custom formatter to pick up the annotations\non a test, create xml, and then implementing custom XSLT run the junitreport\ntask.  This has allowed us to tag tests in the code with bug numbers,\nnotes, version numbers, email addresses to notify on failure, and sort\ninto groups on the web report depending on the state (production, dev,\nquarantined).\n\nI am currently working on a solution to write a custom junit runner\nwhich accompanies the formatter so engineers can run all tests in a\nspecific package that are in dev or production or have a specific\nversion.  I couldn&#39;t find any documentation in ant of an easy way to\nplugin a custom runner to the junit task.  I considered deriving from\nthe ant JUnitTestRunner as I would gain the benefit of it\nautomatically calling my custom formatter for me, but I can&#39;t figure\nout how to get the JUnit ant task to run my testrunner instead of the\ndefault ant\ntest runner.\n\nhttp://freak.homeip.net/doc/ant-1.6.5/manual/api/org/apache/tools/ant/taskdefs/optional/junit/JUnitTestRunner.html\n\nSince I cannot find an easy way to use a custom JUnit test runner with\nthe Ant JUnit task, I am probably going to write my own task which\ncalls my custom runner.  Writing the task won&#39;t be too difficult, but\nI would love to have my own runner logic describing which tests to run\nbased on custom annotations, with the benefits of managed threading,\nformatter, timeouts, and anything else that may come with future\nreleases of the Ant JUnit task. Not to mention as little work as\npossible in updating our current build scripts that run the tests.\n\nIf anyone knows something being released in the new version of Ant, I\nwould love to know.  I read through their beta manual and couldn&#39;t\nfind any mention of implementing a custom test runner or any custom\ninterface that extends junit.framework.TestListener.\n\nhttp://ant.apache.org/manual-beta/\n\nThank in advance!\n\n~Danny\n\n-- \nc: 650.743.1832\nKG6HHX\nB.S.
