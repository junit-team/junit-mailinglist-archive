Both worked fine, so use which ever you like.\n&gt; \n&gt; My preference is to put the test in the same directory as the \n&gt; class.  \n&gt; I like this because it reduces the number of clicks I have to make \n&gt; in my IDE (JBuilder) to get from production class to test class.  \n&gt; When you are developing in a test-first fashion, you will \n&gt; frequently switch between the test code and the production code.  \n&gt; By putting them in the same directory this makes it easier to \n&gt; navigate in the IDE.  Yes, this mixes production and test files \n&gt; together.  However it is very easy to seperate them in a build \n&gt; script (if you use a simple naming convention for test files).  \n&gt; Since you will spend more of your work day navigating between \n&gt; source files than seperating out test code, I chose to optimize the \n&gt; # of clicks I had to make in the IDE by putting files in the same \n&gt; directory.\n\nI don&#39;t see how putting tests in the same directory optimizes mouse \nclicks.  Doesn&#39;t JBuilder allow opening multiple files?  With \nNetBeans, I can just use a tabbed pane or pull out the file into a \nseparate window.  The Emacs folks (which there are apparently a lot \nof of around here) can split the window.  \n\nI prefer a separate test directory for purely aesthetic reasons.  I&#39;m \nam more and more inclined to support using the same package to allow \npackage/protected access simply because I&#39;d rather risk suboptimal \ndesigns than inhibit testing.  I don&#39;t test private methods directly \nbecause to me that is too strong a design smell to leave alone. \n\n&gt; I use the following naming convention:\n&gt;   Someclass.java\n&gt;   SomeclassT.java // the unit test\n&gt;   SomeclassM.java // a mock object of Someclass\n\nIt would seem clearer to use SomeClassTest, MockSomeClass.\n\n\n",
