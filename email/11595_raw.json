Just the Test interface (that would\n&gt; probably be the absolute minimum)?\n\nI think it&#39;s mainly the way thinks are supposed to interact - the\nskeleton, so to speak.\n\n&gt; I keep getting the impression here\n&gt; that anything anyone is unhappy with is &quot;not really part of the\n&gt; framework, you should write your own if you don&#39;t like it&quot;, as opposed\n&gt; to a positive definition which states what is part of the framework,\n&gt; why, and why it needs to never be changed.\n\nTo me, it doesn&#39;t need to be changed because it&#39;s written in a way that\nyou easily can plug in your own implementations.\n\n&gt;   I hate hearing the implication &quot;the code never changes so it must be\n&gt; really good code&quot;.\n\nI don&#39;t remember someone saying that. What *I* said was that *perhaps*\nthe code &quot;never&quot; changes *because* it is really good code and therefore\ndoesn&#39;t need to be changed that much.\n\n&gt; The only thing that unchanging code implies is\n&gt; that no one has changed it. \n\nUnchanging code which is used much and with wich most people seem to be\nquite happy might imply something more, though...\n\nNo hard feelings, Ilja\n\n\n",
