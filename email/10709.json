These tests have been running for about<br/>\n10 months now and continue to grow.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe design is:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) a tool that talks to the IE OLE object directly, using Perl -<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://samie.sourceforge.net/\">http://samie.sourceforge.net/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n2) adding lots of improvements (this tool will most likely need<br/>\nenhancements, since I found it didn&#39;t provide enough functionality<br/>\nas is; I&#39;m currently in the process of trying to open source the<br/>\nimprovements I made)<br/>\n<br/>\n3) linking it to talk to JUnit using XML-RPC<br/>\n<br/>\n4) JUnit<br/>\n<br/>\n5) company specific layer that simplifies test writing<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you don&#39;t care about using Java and JUnit you can skip steps 3,<br/>\n4, 5. You can try just using the tool, but I strongly encourage you<br/>\nto come up with a test pattern that eliminates duplication from your<br/>\ncode and makes it very easy to add new tests. (I happen to like the<br/>\ntemplate pattern.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWith this setup I&#39;ve been able to currently have over 500 web tests<br/>\nthat have been running for months and are easy to maintain. Each<br/>\nweb tests does dozens of assertions and navigations. They check for<br/>\nvery specific values on the web page - value of all form elements,<br/>\nvalue of all HTML tables, links, text, check box states, etc.<br/>\nBasically, anything that IE can normally see, I can get at<br/>\nprogrammatically, too. They also can interact with any form element,<br/>\nclick links, press the refresh button - you have programmatic<br/>\ncontrol over IE.<br/>\n<br/>\nI tried using HttpUnit before coming up with the approach described <br/>\nabove but found it too limited in its JavaScript support. I started <br/>\nat a company that already had a working product. They weren&#39;t about <br/>\nto start changing the code (JavaScript) to make it more testable or <br/>\nso that HttpUnit would like it better. Suffice it to say, I had to <br/>\ncome up with a different approach.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMisha Rybalov<br/>\nwww.gomisha.com/autotest</div>",
