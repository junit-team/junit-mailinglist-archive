I have successfully used it when unit <br/>\n&gt; testing standalone applications. Suffice to say I am hooked ;-).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; However now my situation is a bit different. There is an application <br/>\n&gt; developed by a third party. I have to develop plugins for the same. I <br/>\n&gt; want to be able to unit test my plugins, and develop a test suite. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The problem is however I can&#39;t execute my plugin as a stand-alone <br/>\n&gt; app. The code only gets executed in the context of the app that uses <br/>\n&gt; it. Hence I cant create unit tests that I can execute with Junit .I <br/>\n&gt; would be most grateful if someone could provide me with suggestions <br/>\n&gt; on how I could go about the same.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Check out www.mockobjects.com  The folks there developed some<br/>\nVisualAge for Java plugins using Mocks.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs JB explained in his reply, the idea is to find out what you are<br/>\nrelying on from the framework, and mock it.<br/>\n<br/>\nDave</div>",
