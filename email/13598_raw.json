Muller\n\n&gt; &gt; All objects should be in a &quot;sane&quot; state all the tim=\r\ne. If  not, then the \n&gt; &gt; design could be improved to avoid this problem. T=\r\nhe Pragmatic \n&gt; &gt; Programmers call what you describe as &quot;Programming by Coi=\r\nncidence&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Sane state&quot; does NOT mean that everything can be done=\r\n to the \n&gt; object at every time. Cedric&#39;s &quot;initialized&quot; example is \n&gt; proba=\r\nbly actually a design flaw, but for other states, it \n&gt; makes of course muc=\r\nh sense to disallow certain operations: If \n&gt; a database connection is not =\r\nopen, you cannot execute a \n&gt; select; if a file has been deleted, it cannot=\r\n be deleted a \n&gt; second time; a bill that has been cancelled cannot be \n&gt; i=\r\nnvoiced; etc.etc.\n\nExactly.  Even with a sane object, not all methods can b=\r\ne called at any\ntime, and since your code has this restriction, it&#39;s not su=\r\nrprising to me\nthat the tests should reflect that.\n\nInstead of relying on a=\r\n mock database, I&#39;d rather use the real one on my\ntests and if the connecti=\r\non fails, I want the testing framework to simply\n*not* call any of my datab=\r\nase tests and let me know they were not run.\n\n&gt; In many cases I saw and see=\r\n, programmers/designers/architects \n&gt; seem to believe that the String class=\r\n (where you can indeed \n&gt; execute every method sensibly at every time) is t=\r\nhe \n&gt; paradigmatic example of a class. Nothing can be further from \n&gt; the t=\r\nruth: Many classes have an &quot;interesting state diagram&quot;, \n&gt; where certain op=\r\nerations can only be invoked if certain \n&gt; conditions hold.\n\nInteresting po=\r\nint.\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; - A certain object can only be created if a previous object\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n has been created\n&gt; &gt; &gt; before.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If so, then the previous object sh=\r\nould be the only thing that can \n&gt; &gt; create the new object!\n&gt; \n&gt; This is of=\r\nten contrary to design concepts with somewhat \n&gt; centralized responsibiliti=\r\nes.\n\nAgreed.  Sometimes a method needs two objects to create a third one, a=\r\nnd\nthis method doesn&#39;t belong to a class more than another.\n\n&gt; Still, on a =\r\nmore general level - e.g. when one talks about \n&gt; closely tied groups of cl=\r\nasses (yes: they are there; not even \n&gt; one of the tutorials that explain J=\r\nUnit pretends that \n&gt; litterally everything makes sense to be\n&gt; mocked) - t=\r\nhe guidelines hinted at by JBR do make sense.\n\nYes.  It&#39;s just that when yo=\r\nu do testing, you very rapidly leave &quot;unit\ntesting&quot; (testing of one class) =\r\nto do some other form of testing, and JUnit\nstarts being a strain when this=\r\n happens in my experience because of these\ndeficiencies.\n\n-- \nC=E9dric\nhttp=\r\n://beust.com/weblog\n\n\n\n",
