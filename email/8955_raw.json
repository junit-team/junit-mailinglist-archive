Jus=\r\nt &#39;cos it isn&#39;t proven,\n&gt;doesn&#39;t make it not right. Why not accept good for=\r\ntune occasionally?\n&gt;\n&gt;      &gt; I write code, I test my code, I debug my code=\r\n when tests fail\n&gt;      &gt; by trying to analyse the output. I was hoping for=\r\n it to be\n&gt;      &gt; easier to analyse, w/o a lot of manual effort, but I don=\r\n&#39;t\n&gt;      &gt; have an itch big enough to attempt to write such a tool --\n&gt;   =\r\n   &gt; especially when it&#39;d be cheap/clean to do it in the\n&gt;      &gt; framework=\r\n.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;      So you are actually concerned about who will be writing the cod=\r\ne to\n&gt;make\n&gt;&gt;      it work?\n&gt;\n&gt;I have open source projects I help out with,=\r\n I think the bigger test is the\n&gt;community of folk you work with. If I am t=\r\nhis out of synch with you all it\n&gt;isn&#39;t a good start. There are many reason=\r\n why software projects fail, and I\n&gt;don&#39;t need to start one that appears so=\r\n unwelcomed by the development team\n&gt;for the product (that I like/use so mu=\r\nch) that I was hoping to assist  w/\n&gt;&quot;my little epiphany&quot;.\n\nAdam, please re=\r\nad more closely. This is the second time that you have distorted what we ha=\r\nve written.\n\nYour idea is not unwelcome. I have stated -- a few times -- th=\r\nat what you propose (the ability to manage dependencies of the sort you des=\r\ncribe) is a good idea and would likely be welcome to others. All I have sai=\r\nd is that I do not believe it belongs at the core of JUnit.\n\nAs for hoping =\r\nthat the JUnit team will assist you, I guess you don&#39;t know the JUnit team =\r\nvery well. Kent and Erich are nice folks, but they are not active contribut=\r\nors to JUnit these days. Just look at the gulfs in time between releases to=\r\n convince yourself. Kent and Erich are not going to jump on board and help =\r\nyou with this. They don&#39;t have the time or energy. The real activity is in =\r\nadd-on projects like JUnit-addons.\n\nJUnit is an excellent example of a well=\r\n-closed package -- not perfect, but pretty damn good -- so that the vast ma=\r\njority of new features can be implemented easily enough by adding onto JUni=\r\nt rather than changing its core. I think this is a testament to JUnit&#39;s des=\r\nign. The majority of extensions/changes fall into three categories:\n\n* Cust=\r\nomized assertions\n* Custom Test Runners\n* Custom classes to sit at the root=\r\n of a TestCase hierarchy\n\nHTMLUnit is an example of the first. Artima&#39;s sui=\r\nte runner is an example of the second. StrutsTestCase is an example of the =\r\nthird.\n\nA good solution to your problem is the second: a custom test runner=\r\n with a dependency graph collector/analyzer.\n\n&gt;      &gt; Also, much as I coul=\r\nd craft some sort of add on\n&gt;      &gt; (perhaps leverage my own sub-class fro=\r\nm TestCase) I think it\n&gt;      &gt; needs too much of what is in the framework =\r\nin order to work\n&gt;      &gt; well, and I don&#39;t fancy re-writing the thing.\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n&gt;      I don&#39;t think you&#39;d need to rewrite anything.\n&gt;\n&gt;But I do, and if I =\r\nam writing it that matters more. Few people here have\n&gt;even accepted the ne=\r\ned for the concept, and other than &quot;go write you own\n&gt;collectors&quot; not offer=\r\ned help, so why would I waste time on the\n&gt;implementation?\n\nExcuse me: did =\r\nyou expect that we would suspend our lives and help you write what you need=\r\n? That&#39;s not how open source works. I didn&#39;t see you handing out invitation=\r\ns; but rather asking, &quot;Why don&#39;t you people add this to JUnit?&quot; That we don=\r\n&#39;t need, thanks.\n\n&gt;      &gt; I use eclipse, I use ant -- I like the integrati=\r\non into those\n&gt;      &gt; tools more than I like my idea. If I can&#39;t get you t=\r\no\n&gt;      &gt; contemplate the concept, then I probably have little chance\n&gt;   =\r\n   &gt; of persuading them. If they don&#39;t use it, I won&#39;t benefit. Another\n&gt;  =\r\n    &gt; reason not to start.\n&gt;\n&gt;      You wouldn&#39;t need to persuade anyone. B=\r\noth Eclipse and Ant are open\n&gt;      source and have a quite mature plugin c=\r\noncept.\n&gt;\n&gt;Yes, I know, I&#39;ve written for both. I&#39;m hardly going to try to r=\r\neplicate\n&gt;all\n&gt;the work for both plugins just to try to get this point over=\r\n.\n\nThen I guess you don&#39;t need it that badly.\n\n&gt;      &gt; This was my first t=\r\nopic on this mailing list, and much as you\n&gt;      &gt; were pretty measured/po=\r\nlite (at least at the start) I don&#39;t\n&gt;      &gt; think I&#39;ll be back for more. =\r\nOpen Source is (IMHO) about open\n&gt;      &gt; minded discussion of ideas, and I=\r\n don&#39;t think I found that\n&gt;      &gt; here. No worries, have fun w/ what you d=\r\no.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;      It is also about contribution. I think we would all be pleased=\r\n to\n&gt;see\n&gt;&gt;      you write your tool and happy to help you where we can. If=\r\n it\n&gt;proves to\n&gt;&gt;      be valuable to many people, the best way to distribu=\r\nte it could be\n&gt;&gt;      reconsidered.\n&gt;\n&gt;Sorry, I&#39;ve heard that too many tim=\r\nes before. Sure, it is a filter of who\n&gt;wants to put skin in the game, but =\r\nit can also be used as an easy barrier.\n&gt;Yes, I know it is &quot;part of OSS the=\r\n process -- the trial by code\n&gt;production&quot;,\n&gt;but it doesn&#39;t make it always =\r\nright & I am not sure it is right here.\n&gt;\n&gt;If the community of developers/u=\r\nsers on a project isn&#39;t open to accepting a\n&gt;core change [and I feel that i=\r\ns the default reaction here -- right or\n&gt;wrong]\n&gt;then it doesn&#39;t making it =\r\na welcoming environment to want to invest to much\n&gt;effort. As such, what co=\r\nuld be done as an internal change gets relegated to\n&gt;a large external devel=\r\nopment. Sorry, as I&#39;ve stated before -- I wanted to\n&gt;clean up some ugly rep=\r\norting mess, not re-write a testing tool.\n\nYou conclude that the community =\r\nof developers is not open to accepting a core change.\n\nThe alternate conclu=\r\nsion is that the community of developers does not believe your particular p=\r\nroposed change is a good idea.\n\nOn what basis did you choose your conclusio=\r\nn over the alternative?\n\nWhen you are ready to accept the possibility that =\r\nwe merely disagree with you, rather than are nefariously blocking your prop=\r\nosal, please come back and discuss this with us again.\n\n(Incidentally, I do=\r\nn&#39;t see how we can block your proposal, anyway. We don&#39;t own JUnit.)\n\n\nJ. B=\r\n.
