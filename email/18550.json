I think of Novice rules this way: Novices should follow the <br/>\nrules for these reasons:<br/>\n<br/>\n  * the rule is simple to express<br/>\n  * the rule is safe<br/>\n  * the rule teaches<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce you have learned a lot of what the rule teaches, you can progress <br/>\nto the next levels with regards to that concept.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn this case, I find my designs improved when I wrote only one assertion <br/>\nper test. Then I noticed the equivalence between one assertion and &#39;n&#39; <br/>\nassertions, as long as all the assertions came at the end of the test. <br/>\n From that, I progressed to a new rule:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Only one set of arrange, act, assert sections per test&quot; (Google &quot;Bill <br/>\nWake 3 A&#39;s&quot; for more about arrange, act, assert.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI followed this rule for a while, then I wrote this article:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://articles.jbrains.ca/OneActPerTest.html\">http://articles.jbrains.ca/OneActPerTest.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSince then, I have progressed to this new rule:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;You&#39;d better have a damn good reason to have more than one &#39;act&#39; <br/>\nsection per test.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe article helped me articulate one or two &quot;damn good reason&quot;s. <br/>\nNowadays, I consider myself an Expert (on the Dreyfus scale, <br/>\nspecifically), so I don&#39;t worry about the rules. I notice that I tend to <br/>\nhave only one &#39;act&#39; section per test and that I tend to have only one <br/>\nassertion per test, and I notice that my designs tend to be better the <br/>\nmore I pay attention to those two things, but I no longer consider them <br/>\nrules I must follow.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope that helps.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ.
