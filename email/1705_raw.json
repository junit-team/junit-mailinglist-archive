Your class has seven pri=\r\nvate methods to help it do\nits work, which perhaps points to those seven me=\r\nthods belonging on a new\nclass with which the existing class should collabo=\r\nrate.

[mailto:=\r\nrainsber@...]\nSent: 28 June 2001 16:52\nTo:  junit@yahoogroups.com\nSu=\r\nbject: Re: [junit] Testing Private  Methods\n\nYes. Don&#39;t test protected and =\r\n package-protected methods.\n\nA quote from the XP discussion group.\n(http://=\r\n208.48.218.9/group/extremeprogramming/message/13213)\n\n&quot;I  actually do think=\r\n that it is cut and dried. Public members have a\nbehavior  that is expected=\r\n of them by their clients. Tests can be used to\ndefine that  behavior and d=\r\nemonstrate that a particular method exhibits it.\nPrivate  methods are, by d=\r\nefinition, implementation details. Their behavior\ncan vary  freely so long =\r\nas the public methods don&#39;t break. Put another\nway:\nif every  public method=\r\n has been proven to behave correctly then the class\nhas been  proven to be =\r\nbug free. Therefore, there is never a need to test\nthe private  members of =\r\na class.&quot;\n\nSo can you avoid testing them? If so, then don&#39;t;  if not, then =\r\nyou can&#39;t\nhave it both ways: either the tests are in the class  (to test pr=\r\nivate\nmethods),\nin the package (to test protected/package  methods) or you =\r\ncan&#39;t test those\nmethods. There&#39;s no magic  here...\n\nGood luck,\n\nJ. B.
