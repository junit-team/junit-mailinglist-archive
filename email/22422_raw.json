Classes=\r\n mode is one per class. Both is, well, both. In my 10+ years as test-infect=\r\ned, I have really never ever had a use-case where this kind of solution wou=\r\nld be appropriate (maybe some kind of really slow database with unlimited c=\r\nheap connections). With thousands of test classes you come to a grinding ha=\r\nlt with any of these options.\n\nWell I&#39;ll be 100% correct here, it does not =\r\nfire one thread per test. It  makes one CachedThreadPool per test class, an=\r\nd schedules runnables on it. Unfortunately the CachedThreadPool is not desi=\r\ngned to be used this way, and it needs to be shut down properly or each ins=\r\ntance will stay around for 60 seconds consuming more resources. So if you h=\r\nave 500 tests with 5 methods each in one module you&#39;ll have a maximum of 25=\r\n00 threads running in 500 instances of CachedThreadPool; and currently thos=\r\ne 2500 threads will stay around for a minute.\n\nThis is actually a lot less =\r\nefficient than just doing new Thread(runnable).start(), which is also a bit=\r\n crazy. \n\nBut there&#39;s no point in bashing the default implementation; it&#39;s =\r\nextensible and user-modifyable - which is really the important thing. Actua=\r\nlly, I suppose at some point in time Kent/David make up their mind about ho=\r\nw to solve issue 18. I&#39;ve spent quite a lot of time refining the CPC and th=\r\ney&#39;re more than welcome to supplement/replace ParallelComputer with my impl=\r\nementation. Just remember to vote for issue 18 ;)\n\n\n&gt; [DF] When you add box=\r\nes, each one runs a separate selenium rc server? How do you distribute the =\r\ntests to them?\n\nYes, 1 rc instance per box.  We just use maven properties i=\r\nn pom.xml like this;\n\n    &lt;properties&gt;\n        &lt;selenium.rc.server&gt;localhos=\r\nt&lt;/selenium.rc.server&gt;\n        &lt;selenium.rc.serverPort&gt;4444&lt;/selenium.rc.se=\r\nrverPort&gt;\n        &lt;selenium.browser&gt;*firefox&lt;/selenium.browser&gt;\n    &lt;/prope=\r\nrties&gt;\n\nThese are &quot;sensible default values&quot; in our environment and we just =\r\ninvoke maven with overriding values on our build box:\n\nmvn -Dselenium.rc.se=\r\nrver=3Dfirstrcbox.com -Dselenium.browser=3D*opera install\n\nThe we just have=\r\n a number of automatic builds that are triggered by commit hooks. \n\nI know =\r\nit&#39;s not very glorious, but it works really well in the trenches. \n\nKristia=\r\nn\n\n\n\n",
