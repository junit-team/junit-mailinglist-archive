The &quot;catch&quot; is that I have to<br/>\ncontribute testing-related examples - in other words: beautiful test<br/>\ncode.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI already have some ideas of what to cover, but I thought some of the<br/>\npeople in this group might have some examples of tests that they<br/>\nconsider particularly &quot;beautiful&quot; or clever in their approach.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it&#39;s great that developer testing has reached the point that<br/>\nsome authors/editors thought of including testing in such a book, and<br/>\nI want to make sure I pick the best possible example(s) to pick from.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\nAlberto</div>",
