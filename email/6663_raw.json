Pardon the =3D20 and =3D2Es]\n\n&lt;quote&gt;\n&gt; This is all definitely wor=\r\nth knowing, but my immediate guess is that\n&gt; the JUnitDoclet user is (re)ge=\r\nnerating far too many tests at once,\n&gt; irrespective of whether those tests =\r\nsay fail() or not\n\nIf you mean, that in a non-TDD environment, there are ma=\r\nny\nempty test methods in the beginning, that is true. (The next\nversion of =\r\nJUnitDoclet will at least count them and print that\nnumber as warning.) But=\r\n as a coach I actually have seen a\nremarkable thing:\n\n  Because it is so ea=\r\nsy to write a test _then_ (once there is\n  a place for it) they get written=\r\n naturally. Developers know\n  the importance of tests, the just need help t=\r\no get started.\n&lt;/quote&gt;\n\nIt is easy to write a test then, but it&#39;s not nece=\r\nssarily the proper test\nto write=3D2E Test-After leads to a testing methods=\r\n, rather than testing\nbehavior=3D2E One of the points of TDD is to identify=\r\n what behavior is requi=3D\nred\nup front, then implement just enough of it=\r\n=3D2E There is already overhead to=3D\n\nwriting unnecessary code; there is m=\r\nuch more overhead in testing\nunnecessary code=3D2E Generating test stubs ab=\r\ndicates the programmer of his\nresponsibility to ask himself the question, &quot;=\r\nDo I need to test this method=3D\n?\nDo I even need this method at all?&quot; That=\r\n&#39;s one reason why I distrust the\nTest-After process=3D2E\n\nStill, that&#39;s eas=\r\ny for me to say, because I don&#39;t have millions of lines o=3D\nf\nuntested (an=\r\nd untestable) legacy code standing between me and the delivery=3D\n\ndate=3D2=\r\nE I have respect for the people who effectively deal with that probl=3D\nem=\r\n=3D2E\n\n&lt;quote&gt;\n&gt; It is important for us to remember our TDD bias=3D2E :)\n\nB=\r\nTW: Did you ever consider to generate a test from an empty=3D20\nbut compila=\r\nble application method? Still the test can be=3D20\n_implemented_ before the=\r\n tested method does something=3D2E=3D20\n&lt;/quote&gt;\n\nYes, I have considered it=\r\n; but I prefer to write the test first, because i=3D\nn\nso doing, I may find=\r\n out that the method I wanted to write really needs to=3D\n\nbe something els=\r\ne entirely=3D2E\n\nI have had this discussion with quite a few of my (then) I=\r\nBM colleagues,\none of whom asserts that writing the test immediately after =\r\nwriting the\ncode is the same as writing the test before the code=3D2E The b=\r\nottom line is=3D\n\nthat as long as the individual thinks about the test firs=\r\nt, that&#39;s what is=3D\n\nimportant=3D2E To do otherwise creates more problems =\r\nto refactor away from=3D2E=3D\n\n\nTake care=3D2E\n\n--JBR\n\n\n-------------------=\r\n-------------------------------------------------\nmail2web - Check your ema=\r\nil from the web at\nhttp://mail2web.com/ .\n\n\n\n",
