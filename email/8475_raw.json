For \n&gt;these tests, success is measured by what=\r\n I see in the inspector. \n\nThe whole point of JUnit is automate those tests=\r\n so that you do not have to physically look at the result to verify it. You=\r\n code what you expect in the test and the test runner tells you whether the=\r\n results match your expectations. This is in perfect alignment with the pur=\r\npose of JUnit.\n\n&gt;But \n&gt;storing these tests in junit has independent value. =\r\nFor one, success \n&gt;can also defined as &#39;no exception thrown&#39;, which is what=\r\n \n&gt;junit would test. (The exception might be an unanticipated error, or \n&gt;a=\r\n runtime exception I deliberately throw in the test). The other is \n&gt;simply=\r\n the value of &#39;cataloging&#39; and sharing these tests rather than \n&gt;having the=\r\nm ad hoc in a development workspace. True, I dont *have* to \n&gt;use junit for=\r\n that but it fits (except for the return value issue I \n&gt;am raising).\n\nTher=\r\ne are many reasons to write tests this way. I suggest reading the available=\r\n literature, especially Kent Beck&#39;s Test-Driven Development by Example, htt=\r\np://www.xprogramming.com and http://www.junit.org.\n\n&gt;Obviously I can wrappe=\r\nr my test methods in a junit method but it is a \n&gt;waste of time. \n\nIf JUnit=\r\n wastes your time, then don&#39;t use it. If you think JUnit is beneficial, the=\r\nn you have to change your approach to work with JUnit. If you want to do so=\r\nmething slightly different than JUnit, then you have to find that or build =\r\nit yourself.\n\nI think those are your options.\n\n&gt;Also thanks to Mike for the=\r\n tip about looking at the code, great \n&gt;idea. But I dont have any source fo=\r\nr junit.jar in the junit3.8.1.zip \n&gt;file I downloaded from junit.org (also =\r\nsourceforge), else I&#39;d have \n&gt;fixed this myself. Where do I find the source=\r\n distro?\n\nsrc.jar\n\nTake care.\n\n\nJ. B.
