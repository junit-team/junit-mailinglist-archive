Instead, talk about what<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; you are doing: automatic test generation. If you take a look at<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Agitar&#39;s marketing material<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.agitar.com/solutions/business/create_junit_tests.html)\">http://www.agitar.com/solutions/business/create_junit_tests.html)</a>,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; they&#39;re not talking about TDD either--because automatic test<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; generation and TDD are simply two unrelated things.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; In fact the German marketing material once mentioned TDD, which made<br/>\n&gt; &gt; them lose a lot of credibility in my eyes...<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Which is why they don&#39;t say that any more.  :)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; But for people who don&#39;t practice TDD this is a difficult distinction:<br/>\n&gt;  if you have a failing test before you write the code, why isn&#39;t that<br/>\n&gt; enough to be TDD?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Generally, if you do in fact have a failing test before righting the<br/>\ncode that test is intended to exercise, then it is TDD in some sort. <br/>\n/Good/ TDD though is a bit more than the just fundamental &#39;test first&#39;<br/>\nrule - it involves a rapid cycle of &#39;test first&#39;, then code, then<br/>\nrefactor. In other words, as people have indicated earlier:  small<br/>\nsteps from which the design emerges.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; I *think* what Jimm is talking about doing is generating a test from<br/>\n&gt; the comment before the implementation is written, so you would have a<br/>\n&gt; failing test before the body of the code was there. Similarly our<br/>\n&gt; (Agitar) marketing people had the feeling that if our product  would<br/>\n&gt; let you write a failing test in advance of the code that was TDD,<br/>\n&gt; right?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It seems to me that what Jimm is doing is actually writing &quot;the code&quot;,<br/>\nthen generating a test, then writing &quot;the code&quot; again. Remember - DRY.<br/>\nIn other words, the &#39;comments&#39; written to generate the test are<br/>\n&quot;CODE&quot;, just not java code. <br/>\n<br/>\nThink of TDD without the words &quot;test&quot; and &quot;code&quot;.  The essence of TDD<br/>\nis that you first write &quot;what should it do?&quot;, then write &quot;how it does<br/>\nit&quot;.  Generally, the &quot;what should I do&quot; is specified in the &quot;test&quot;; <br/>\nthe &quot;how it does it&quot; is specified in the &quot;code [under test]&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; The explanation I&#39;ve used is to distinguish between TDD in the small<br/>\n&gt; (or test-first) and TDD in the large.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I might find a bug, write a failing test for the bug, and the fix the<br/>\n&gt; bug.  That&#39;s would be test-first programming  (or TDD in the small).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, that is in fact TDD.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It&#39;s a good thing to do, but the tests aren&#39;t driving my design.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Maybe they do, maybe they don&#39;t.  Probably depends on the scope of the<br/>\nbug.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Isn&#39;t trying to make this distinction clearer what drove people to<br/>\n&gt; change the name from Test First Development  --&gt; TDDevelopement --&gt;<br/>\n&gt; TDDesign --&gt; BDDesign?  Gotta be a FAQ on this somewhere...<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know what drives people to keep renaming the same thing over<br/>\nand over, but I do know it&#39;s aggrevating :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Jtf<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -- <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.developertesting.com/\">http://www.developertesting.com/</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Cheers...<br/>\n--MB</div>",
