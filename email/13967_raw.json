Howeve=\r\nr, at least  I&#39;m sure the\n&gt; tests are running the way I think they should b=\r\ne running!  \n&gt; I distrust computers and software greatly\n\nIf you trust your=\r\n eyes more than computers, you are probably in the wrong\nindustry :-)\n\n&gt; so=\r\n I&#39;m always trying to check up on what I\n&gt; think is going on... this is dou=\r\nbly true when I&#39;m using new (for me)\n&gt; software like Junit.\n&gt; \n&gt; How do you=\r\n Junit veterans assure yourself that a test is \n&gt; actually running and doin=\r\ng what it should be doing?\n\nHeavy doses of alcohol do wonder for me :-)\n\nMo=\r\nre seriously, the HTML (or wherever you generate them) reports will help\nyo=\r\nu make sure your tests pass, and if you are not quite sure of yourself,\nsom=\r\ne redundancy in your tests doesn&#39;t hurt either (testing the same feature\ntw=\r\nice in slightly modified ways in two different places).\n\nBut at some point,=\r\n you really have to trust that your code is really being\nexecuted and it ta=\r\nkes a little leap of faith to get there (especially when\nyou are testing a =\r\ntesting framework with itself, which was the case in the\nearly days of Test=\r\nNG :-)).\n\n-- \nC=E9dric\nhttp://testng.org\n\n \n\n\n",
