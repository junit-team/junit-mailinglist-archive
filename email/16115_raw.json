I think I&#39;ve got what I want to learn and decide =\r\nto\nstart PRACTICING right now. \n\nHere is the summary of what I learned:\n\n* =\r\nautomated unit testing is possible for commericial software development.\n* =\r\nfor experienced testers, the time should be shorter.\n* for team new to unit=\r\n testing, there may be some prodctivity drop at\nthe  begining. Like the fir=\r\nst 3-6 months. \n* it is best to consider the extra effort, like learning cu=\r\nrve,\nespecially at the project planning phase. \n* and lots more ...\n\nThanks=\r\n to all who ever helped. \n\nCheers, \n- Frank\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
