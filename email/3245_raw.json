If you need to call other method \nfrom oneTimeSetup, my hunch is that either those method should be static \nas well.  If that is not the case, then you can always create a singleton.\n\ncsmall@... wrote:\n\n&gt;This code below makes sense, but doesn&#39;t it require that all of the \n&gt;methods called in the oneTimeSetUp() and oneTimeTearDown() methods \n&gt;are all static?  I have many methods that I need to call in \n&gt;oneTimeSetUp() and oneTimeTearDown() that are not static.  Any \n&gt;suggestions?\n&gt;\n&gt;thanks,\n&gt;chad.\n&gt;\n&gt;there is one way to do a one time setup and tearDown in a test \n&gt;class,here is how:\n&gt;\n&gt;public class TestOne extends TestCase\n&gt;\n&gt;{\n&gt;\n&gt; public static void oneTimeSetUp()\n&gt;    {\n&gt;        System.out.println(&quot;test set up &quot;);\n&gt;    }\n&gt;\n&gt;public static void oneTimeTearDown()\n&gt;    {\n&gt;        System.out.println(&quot;test tear down &quot;);\n&gt;    }\n&gt;\n&gt;    public void test1()\n&gt;    {\n&gt;        System.out.println(&quot;test1&quot;);\n&gt;    }\n&gt;\n&gt;    public void test2()\n&gt;    {\n&gt;        System.out.println(&quot;test2&quot;);\n&gt;    }\n&gt;    public static Test suite()\n&gt;    {\n&gt;        TestSuite suite= new TestSuite(TestOne.class);\n&gt;\n&gt;        TestSetup wrapper= new TestSetup(suite)\n&gt;        {\n&gt;            public void setUp()\n&gt;            {\n&gt;                oneTimeSetUp();\n&gt;            }\n&gt;            public void tearDown()\n&gt;            {\n&gt;                oneTimeTearDown()\n&gt;\n&gt;            }\n&gt;        };\n&gt;        return wrapper;\n&gt;\n&gt;     }\n&gt;\n&gt;run this class you can see setup is done in the first order,and \n&gt;teardown is the last one.\n&gt;\n&gt;and if you specify the order to exe the test case,you can share data \n&gt;as you want.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Ellen\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt;junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;Your use of Yahoo!
