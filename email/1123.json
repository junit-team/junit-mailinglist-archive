I&#39;m building on a Unix machine, which means that the<br/>\njava ui has to connect to an X server somewhere. If it doesn&#39;t, then<br/>\nall the gui-related tests fail, since they can&#39;t open their windows.<br/>\n<br/>\nHas anybody solved this problem before? The best answers I can come up<br/>\nwith are to either separate out the gui tests that require a window to<br/>\nbe opened (anything dealing with geometry it seems), or replace the<br/>\nvisible windows with in-memory windows and see if that helps. <br/>\n<br/>\nAny suggestions are welcome...<br/>\n<br/>\nbab<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nBrian Button            <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bbutton@...\">bbutton@...</a><br/>\nSenior Consultant       Object Mentor, Inc<br/>\nSt. Louis, MO\t\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.objectmentor.com\">http://www.objectmentor.com</a></div>",
