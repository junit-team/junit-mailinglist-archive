One of the roadblocks I have gotten into is contexts.\n&gt; There is no way to test them outside of an container or file system\n&gt; when they are embedded into a method. Let me pick on an InitialContext\n&gt; and VelocityContext in this email example:\n\nWhat are you trying to test? It looks like you&#39;re testing \nVelocityContext. Are you on the Velocity project? or just a user of \nVelocity? If it&#39;s the latter, then why are you testing Velocity?\n\n&gt; VelocityContext context = new VelocityContext();\n&gt; context.put(&quot;requestMap&quot;, requestMap);\n&gt; StringWriter w = new StringWriter();\n&gt; Velocity.mergeTemplate(&quot;mytemplate.vm&quot;, &quot;UTF-8&quot;, context, w);\n&gt; String text = w.toString();\n\nI use this as the basis for testing web page templates without serving \nthem up from a web server. It works like a charm. I&#39;d prefer a solution \nthat doesn&#39;t touch the file system, but the effort required to bypass \nthe file system might be too great, considering how I write page \ntemplates (in text files).\n\n&gt; InitialContext ic = new InitialContext();\n&gt; Session session = (Session) ic.find(&quot;mail/MailSource&quot;);\n&gt; Message msg = new MimeMessage(session);\n&gt; msg.setContent(text, &quot;text/plain&quot;);\n\nAgain, what are you testing here?\n\nI find that when I&#39;m confused about whether or what to mock, or when I \nfeel like I&#39;m mocking too much, then I&#39;m confused about what I&#39;m \ntesting. Step back, breathe, and point to the object in your test that \nyou&#39;re testing. Once you do that, the path is quite clear. If it isn&#39;t, \npoint it out to us and we&#39;ll help.\n-- \nJ. B.
