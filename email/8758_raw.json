Well, one thing you might consider is that, depending on how\n&gt; useful the library is, it might be easiest to change the clients so \nthat\n&gt; they don&#39;t use that library.\n\n\nNo can do.   it is a framework library used for our messaging \ninfrustructure.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; How will your test method make assertions about what has happened in \nthe\n&gt; server VM, or the client VMs?  You&#39;ll have to have some way of \nallowing\n&gt; communication between the various virtual machines.  The easiest \nways I\n&gt; can think of are:\n&gt; \n\nThat part is easy.   This is a messaging type of application \ncommunicating through a messaging bus.   Client starts up and listens \nfor messages comming off of a queue and can make assertions based on \nnumber of messages received.   Client doesn&#39;t have to know anything \nbout server location and socket ports.\n\n\n\n\nthanks\n\n\n",
