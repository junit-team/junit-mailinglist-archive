Just implemented the TestListener and the job is\ndone. Don&#39;t know if there are other methods to do that, but by-passing the\ntestrunner makes us to not see the ouput on the console and everything is\nlogged without any output on the console.\n\nAm still extending the thing and hope it will be in shape soon :-)\n\nRegards\nVipul\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Katie Gerg [mailto:kgerg@...]\nSent: Wednesday, April 16, 2003 7:34 PM\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: RE: [junit] Identify name of the TestCase\n\n\nI&#39;ll have to take a look at the TestRunner again.  I looked at the textui\nclasses, ResultPrinter and TestRunner.  ResultPrinter implements\nTestListener, The TestRunner class extends BaseTestRunner, which in turn\nimplements TestListener - my head then exploded - just kidding.    At any\nrate, I just by passed the runner and had the listener keep track of all the\nresults, names, error/failure descriptions and detailed test case\ndescription in an object.\n\nI know this is a hack so I intend to go back and look at it later.\n\n\n  -----Original Message-----\n  From: J. B. Rainsberger [mailto:jbrains@...]\n  Sent: Tuesday, April 15, 2003 05:18 PM\n  To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n  Subject: RE: [junit] Identify name of the TestCase\n\n\n  It sounds like all you needed was to register a TestListener so that, for\neach test, you could collect its name. What you do with those names\nafterward is totally up to the individual.\n\n  Writing the TestListener is nothing. Attaching the TestListener to the\nTestRunner may take some work. I&#39;ve never actually done it. I would have to\nlook at the code.\n\n  I suppose you could have written your own TestRunner that instantiates the\ntext runner, adds the listener, asks the text runner to run the tests, then\nprocesses the results from your listener. Is this what you did? If not, then\nwhat did you do?\n\n  Thanks.\n\n  &gt;So said Katie Gerg on 4/15/2003 --------------------\n  &gt;I&#39;m embarrassed to post it because I&#39;m really serious when I say I hacked\n  &gt;it.  I have to get a suite of automated tests done by the end of this\nweek\n  &gt;so I did it without completely understanding junit but I knew what I\nwanted\n  &gt;to get out of it.  The tests I need to run are highly specialized\n(they&#39;re\n  &gt;the same with different inputs).\n  &gt;\n  &gt;I wanted a list of test cases so I know what test cases I&#39;ve run against\na\n  &gt;build (hey I&#39;m a qa person, I have to know what&#39;s in there not only what\n  &gt;failed - esp. from a test coverage perspective).  I also wanted it in a\n  &gt;format anyone could easily view, so I store the test results in a vector\n  &gt;that I dump out in an html format at the end (the location is hardcoded\nfor\n  &gt;now but it&#39;ll eventually come from a property file).\n  &gt;\n  &gt;Anyway, I confronted the same issue you had with the listener so I made\nmy\n  &gt;own testresult object that the testcase class initializes and the\nlistener\n  &gt;grabs it from it.\n  &gt;\n  &gt;I&#39;ll send it to you but I don&#39;t think it fits into the junit way of\n  &gt;thinking.\n  &gt;\n  &gt;\n  &gt;\n  &gt;\n  &gt;  -----Original Message-----\n  &gt;  From: Jesse Marlin [mailto:jlm@...]\n  &gt;  Sent: Tuesday, April 15, 2003 03:36 PM\n  &gt;  To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n  &gt;  Subject: RE: [junit] Identify name of the TestCase\n  &gt;\n  &gt;\n  &gt;  J.

Upload it to the file section. Get your\n  &gt;name in lights.\n  &gt;\n  &gt;  I agree.  I am having a difficult time finding substantive examples,\n  &gt;  and am currently struggling with TestListener.  I don&#39;t understand\n  &gt;  the relationship between a TestResult and a TestCase.  TestResult\n  &gt;  actually has the addListener method which I need, but I am not sure\n  &gt;  what to do to get a TestResult from the context of a TestCase.\n  &gt;\n  &gt;        Yahoo!
