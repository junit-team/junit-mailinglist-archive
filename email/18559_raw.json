And good testing requires good requirements. Oh and I&#39;ve always wanted an excuse to pontificate on what I&#39;d like to tell some CIOs that I know. :-)\n\nSimon (One of the JUnit list moderators)]\n\nHi, folks. &lt;&lt;Esther waves to the few people who may recognize her  \nfrom her various articles/publications&gt;&gt;\n\nI&#39;m now senior online editor at CIO.com (and more invisibly at  \nCSOonline.com), where I can get into trouble in my very own blog  \n(http://blogs.cio.com/blog/37). I am, of course, still paying a lot  \nof editorial attention to the software development community. It&#39;s  \njust that now I have the ear of the boss.\n\nAmong the things that CIOs most desperately want to know -- really,  \nthey say this -- is what their development staff thinks, but doesn&#39;t  \nSAY. At least, the developer won&#39;t say it directly to the CIO or  \nother top management. So I&#39;m starting a series of articles about  \n&quot;what CIOs really need to know about...&quot; which will cover various  \ntopics. The first one is about software requirements.\n\nMy question to you is a very simple one. If you could get your CIO to  \nunderstand one thing, just ONE THING about software requirements,  \nwhat would it be?\n\nAnd then, the obvious follow-up: why did you pick *that*? War stories  \nto illustrate your point would be great.\n\nYou can touch on anything to do with the software requirements  \nprocess; I&#39;m game for whatever you give me. It could be related to  \nsoftware testing or junit, but your pet peeve could appear anywhere  \nin the development process.\n\nIdeally I would quote you by name and company and location (&quot;Esther  \nSchindler is a senior developer at the Groovy Corporation in  \nScottsdale Arizona&quot;) but as long as you give me some kind of context  \nI&#39;m willing to work without one. That is, I do need some identifying  \ncharacteristics to give the article credibility (&quot;Esther works at a  \nlarge finance company in the Southwest&quot;) but I don&#39;t want you to lose  \nyour job when the CIO realizes that the developer quoted works for  \n*her*! &lt;grin&gt; So please be sure to let me know how to refer to you in  \nthe article.\n\nI&#39;ll be sure to stop by here (as I expect others want to participate  \nin the conversation), but it&#39;d be great if you could send me a  \nprivate message. I don&#39;t want to miss any responses. Feply privately  \nif that&#39;s easier, too.\n\nI plan to work on this during the holiday and to collect responses  \nover the next week or so. I&#39;m hoping to publish the article on  \nCIO.com by mid-January at the latest.\n\nSo: what clue would you most like your CIO to get? about software  \nrequirements, that is?\n\nEsther Schindler\nsenior online editor\nCXO Media\n\n",
