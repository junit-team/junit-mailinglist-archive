I have a test case of 6 test methods. As I\nfigur=\r\ned so far, each test method invokes setUp and tearDown methods\nonce. In set=\r\nUp method I defined some user parameters (USER_ID, and\nsuch...) which are t=\r\nhen passed to the test methods. I get these\nparameters from file and then p=\r\nut them into an arraylist (which is not\nentirely necessary, but hey...). Wh=\r\nat I need to know if there is a\nsimple way of passing the same USER_ID to a=\r\nll the test methods, and -\nafter all the methods have been executed - to pa=\r\nss the next USER_ID,\nand so forth... Basically, one USER_ID per test case e=\r\nxecution/iteration.\n\nIterating through an arraylist in setUp method, since =\r\nthe testcase is\ninstantiated as many times as there are methods in that cas=\r\ne, will\nmake it iterate through every n-th record in file, n being the numb=\r\ner\nof methods. That&#39;s pretty much silly and useless.\n\nAnnotations (@BeforeC=\r\nlass and such) are a no-no.\n\nAny help is welcome, thanks.\nTomislav\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
