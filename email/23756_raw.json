But for instance the jump to method doesn&#39;t work for FlatS=\r\npec stuff,\nand will never work because it&#39;s trying to find a method called =\r\nxxx where\nxxx is the first word in the description of the test. Which obvio=\r\nusly will\nnever work. For Scala-IDE we can work around this using aspects, =\r\nbut it\nwould be nice it this worked nicely. Hence my interest in changing\nD=\r\nescription.\n\nMatthew.\n\nLe 4 novembre 2011 23:01, Bill Venners &lt;bill@artima.=\r\ncom&gt; a =E9crit :\n\n&gt; **\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Matthew,\n&gt;\n&gt; Actually we are planning to &quot;f=\r\nix Eclipse&quot; very soon. The next release of\n&gt; ScalaTest, version 2.0, will i=\r\nnclude enhancements to support IDE\n&gt; integration, and before releasing 2.0 =\r\nwe&#39;re going to help do the actual\n&gt; integration work for Eclipse, IDEA, and=\r\n NetBeans. That way we can be sure\n&gt; we have it right before releasing the =\r\nScalaTest enhancements. I would like\n&gt; your feedback on it. I&#39;ll post annou=\r\nncements of preview snapshots on the\n&gt; scalatest-users mailing list, so ple=\r\nase join that if you&#39;d like to give\n&gt; input.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks.\n&gt;\n&gt; Bill\n&gt; ----\n&gt; =\r\nBill Venners\n&gt; Artima, Inc.\n&gt; http://www.artima.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; On Nov 3, 2011, a=\r\nt 5:50 AM, Matthew Farwell &lt;matthew@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n I&#39;m interested in this, though for slightly different reasons, maybe we\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; could exchange ideas on this. I haven&#39;t exactly thought this through in\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; detail, but I think my requirements come down to being able to store\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n arbitrary information in a Description, a key.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m interesting in =\r\ntesting with Scala, and there are (at least) two\n&gt; generic\n&gt; &gt; problems:\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; 1) Tests which are not linked to a specific method, but are run as\n&gt; =\r\nseparate\n&gt; &gt; tests. Scalatest for example allows the following\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; @Run=\r\nWith(classOf[JUnitRunner])\n&gt; &gt; class FileSpec extends FlatSpec with ShouldM=\r\natchers {\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;A Stack&quot; should &quot;pop values in last-in-first-out order&quot; =\r\nin {\n&gt; &gt; }\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; it should &quot;throw NoSuchElementException if an empty stac=\r\nk is popped&quot; in {\n&gt; &gt; }\n&gt; &gt; }\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; This creates a single method with the=\r\n two tests within. However, the\n&gt; &gt; JUnitRunner runs the single method but =\r\nrecords the two tests separately.\n&gt; &gt; This can be seen in Eclipse, see atta=\r\nched scalatest1.png. Now if I double\n&gt; &gt; click on the test name in the juni=\r\nt view, it tries to find a method of\n&gt; that\n&gt; &gt; name, and fails. Obviously,=\r\n to correct this would require a fix to\n&gt; Eclipse,\n&gt; &gt; but if I could store=\r\n the file & line number instead of the method name, I\n&gt; &gt; could jump to the=\r\n appropriate line.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 2) Scala allows spaces and other characters in m=\r\nethod names, but these\n&gt; &gt; names are munged on compilation. For instance, s=\r\npace gets translated to\n&gt; &gt; $0020.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; class FileTest extends Assertion=\r\nsForJUnit {\n&gt; &gt; @Test def `foo bar`() =3D {\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; }\n&gt; &gt; }\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Here th=\r\ne jump to in Eclipse works correctly, but the displayed\n&gt; description\n&gt; &gt; i=\r\nn Eclipse isn&#39;t nice, see scalatest2.png.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; So in both cases, the str=\r\ning I would like to display (in Eclipse,\n&gt; surefire\n&gt; &gt; whatever) doesn&#39;t m=\r\natch the method name, either because there is no\n&gt; method\n&gt; &gt; name or becau=\r\nse It&#39;s not the same thing. I think that I could work around\n&gt; &gt; most issue=\r\ns is Eclipse etc if the test runner could add some arbitrary\n&gt; &gt; informatio=\r\nn to the description, which it could subsequently use. A string\n&gt; &gt; would b=\r\ne fine, because I could define the contents of that String, but\n&gt; &gt; arbitra=\r\nry data would be even better. String would be simpler for\n&gt; everyone I\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nthink.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Please note that I&#39;m just thinking aloud at the minute, and =\r\nI haven&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; actually done any proof of concepts as yet, but if you have a=\r\nny ideas,\n&gt; &gt; please feel free to take this to email.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Matthew Farwe=\r\nll.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n[Non-tex=\r\nt portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
