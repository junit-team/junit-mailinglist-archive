If you can live with adding an annotation for a custom runner<br/>\nor a rule. I don&#39;t know if there is a way in recent JUnit versions to add<br/>\nglobal rules or your own default runner so that you don&#39;t have to annotate<br/>\nevery test but that is perhaps something that can be added and contribute.<br/>\n<br/>\nHTH<br/>\n-----------------------------------------------------<br/>\nJoakim Ohlrogge<br/>\nAgical AB<br/>\nV�sterl�nggatan 79, 2 tr<br/>\n111 29 Stockholm, SWEDEN<br/>\n<br/>\nMobile: +46-708-754004<br/>\nBlog: johlrogge.wordpress.com<br/>\nTwitter: @johlrogge<br/>\nE-mail: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:joakim.ohlrogge@...\">joakim.ohlrogge@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Thu, Apr 28, 2011 at 5:21 PM, jokap &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jokap@...\">jokap@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I posted this question on stackoverflow. Below you can see the original<br/>\n&gt; link.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We use junit for integration tests. The tests are being run in Eclipse and<br/>\n&gt; Jenkins.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Now i would like to log all junit test run results to a database for easy<br/>\n&gt; reporting (i want to log test class / method name, environment, duration and<br/>\n&gt; success). I had thought about parsing the junit result xmls but to log it<br/>\n&gt; directly to a database sounds good to me, too. It sounds intrusive but also<br/>\n&gt; pretty elegant.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Normally we just annotate a test method with the @Test annotation and<br/>\n&gt; voila, we have our junit test method.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; That means we have no additional framework around junit and i want to keep<br/>\n&gt; it that way!<br/>\n&gt; I fear that means that if i want to implement that kind of logging i will<br/>\n&gt; probably have to hack into junit.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Has anybody done so and can give advice if that works nicely? Maybe you<br/>\n&gt; have an idea on how/where to place the hook in junit. Or are there easier<br/>\n&gt; approaches to my problem?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; edit: To clarify, we already have junit test results of single test runs.<br/>\n&gt; You can get them out of eclipse (export junit result) or out of jenkins.<br/>\n&gt; Running our junit test suites in Jenkins also allows us to track test<br/>\n&gt; failure rates of test suites over time. It shows you a nice chart that<br/>\n&gt; tracks how many tests of passed over time. In each jenkins build you can see<br/>\n&gt; which tests passed, also in comparison to the last run. We need a bit more.<br/>\n&gt; We want to be able to analyse the performance (duration) of certain<br/>\n&gt; testcases over time, over multiple runs, maybe also how they behave<br/>\n&gt; differently in different environments. Extract trends. Do some data mining.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5722431/how-to-log-junit-test-run-results-to-a-database\">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5722431/how-to-log-junit-test-run-results-to-a-database</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; cheers!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>",
