B. Rainsberger &lt;jbrains762@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I understand that. I have also felt this need in the past. When I\n&gt; observed that I could solve many of the same problems by writing\n&gt; smaller, more focused tests, not only did I stop wanting to log\n&gt; assertions, but my designs improved and I delivered more solid\n&gt; features sooner. I believe that if JUnit logged its assertions, then\n&gt; that would have robbed me of this experience.\n\nFirst up I work with Phil and we&#39;ve had this discussion a few times in\nthe past. For the most part I don&#39;t think I would use this feature a\nwhole ton but there is one case that I can of.\n\nIf I&#39;m invited to come and help with a project which is struggling\nwith their tests (not having done TDD from the start), I can see using\nthe log files as a way of helping me better understand what&#39;s going\non. Are there tests without assertions? Are there tests with many\nassertions? etc.\n\nI know that Cedric suggested using log files to measure change in the\nnumber of tests etc. That sounds like work - currently we just count\nthe number of tests and use EclEmma for coverage. Not perfect - but it\nonly takes a few minutes.\n\nSo for it me it would be a tool of some, but not the greatest value.\n\nCheers\nMark\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nBlog: http://www.notesfromatooluser.com/\nOne Year of Scrum: Lessons Learned\nhttp://www.notesfromatooluser.com/2007/10/one-year-of-scr.html\nAperture vs. Lightroom - best comparisons\nhttp://www.notesfromatooluser.com/2007/02/aperture_vs_lig.html\nCustomer Retention Department - Vonage Customer Service Sucks\nhttp://www.notesfromatooluser.com/2007/06/customer_retent.html\n\n",
