In the olden days, \n&gt; =\r\nwith Eclipse 3.0 and JUnit 3.8, I could select a single test \n&gt; method in t=\r\nhe Outline view and run just that method.  \n&gt; Nowadays, whenever I try to d=\r\no that, Eclipse&#39;s test runner \n&gt; runs all the tests in the class.  The resu=\r\nlts are shown in a \n&gt; tree, and the tests I didn&#39;t ask to be run are all un=\r\nder a \n&gt; node called &quot;Unrooted Tests [Runner: JUnit 4]&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; So, I figured=\r\n there must be some simple explanation, and \n&gt; immediately did a Google sea=\r\nrch.  And it found nothing on \n&gt; topic.  So I searched the Eclipse document=\r\nation and website \n&gt; for &quot;unrooted tests&quot; and again got nothing.  So I sear=\r\nched on \n&gt; this Yahoo Group&#39;s message archive, and again found nothing.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; Am I the only person in the world who has ever had this \n&gt; problem with r=\r\nunning a single test method from Eclipse?  Or \n&gt; am I searching for the web=\r\n&#39;s most suppressed secret?\n&gt; \n&gt; Someone please tell me you&#39;ve seen this pro=\r\nblem too!  And why \n&gt; is there nothing written up about these mysterious &quot;U=\r\nnrooted \n&gt; Tests&quot; in all the places I looked?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; Todd.\n&gt; ---=\r\n-\n&gt; Todd Bradley - Polycom, Inc.\n&gt; ReadiVideo QA Lead\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo!
