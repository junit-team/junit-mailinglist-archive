We&#39;re looking to incrementally start<br/>\ntagging our hundreds of test methods with attributes to control<br/>\nwhether they&#39;re run or not, and provide a Filter implementation to do<br/>\nthe selection logic.<br/>\n<br/>\nI haven&#39;t found much documentation on using the<br/>\norg.junit.runner.manipulation.Filter class; it seems to be very much<br/>\nsomething applied to a Runner or Request instance, not a property of<br/>\nthe test suite itself.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince we have a large investment in organizing tests using a number of<br/>\nclasses exposing a suite() method (JUnit3), it seems I want to use the<br/>\nJUnit4TestAdapter class, but once instantiated from within a suite()<br/>\nmethod, calling setFilter() on it has no effect. It seems that I need<br/>\nto convince the runner itself (which could be Eclipse, Ant, etc...) to<br/>\ncall filter(), so unless there&#39;s something I&#39;m misunderstanding, I<br/>\ncan&#39;t go down this path.<br/>\n<br/>\nA second approach that seems like it would work would be to use an<br/>\n@RunsWith annotation to set the org.junit.runners.Suite runner to run<br/>\na suite crafted to replicate the organization we&#39;re doing today with<br/>\nsuite() methods. I&#39;ve been able to apply a Filter from within my own<br/>\nRunner implementation (subclassing BlockJUnit4ClassRunner), but I<br/>\ncan&#39;t see a way to apply a Filter if I&#39;m using the Suite runner.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny ideas?<br/>\n<br/>\nJean-Philippe<br/>\nOttawa, Canada</div>",
