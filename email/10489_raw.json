When I\nrun the unit test inside Eclipse the file is found and the tests run\nfine.  I even tried removing the jar from Eclipse&#39;s build path to make\nsure it was not finding the file in some other location.  The test\nfailed without the jar in the path, so I am pretty sure the unit test\nis finding the file in the jar.\n\nNow, when I run the unit tests from ANT I get a NullPointerException\nbecause the InputStream is Null.  I double checked the classpath that\nis printed out when the unit test runs and the jar file that contains\nthe xml file is on the classpath.\n\nHere is the code I am using to read in the xml file.  It is pretty\nmuch the same as the original poster.\n\n// Get our sample input file.\nInputStream is = Class.class.getResourceAsStream(&quot;/RunPOEngineTest.xml&quot;);\nInputStreamReader sr = new InputStreamReader(is);\n\nAny insight would be appreciated.  Is there some known differences\nwith running Unit test in Eclipse vs. ANT that could be tripping me up.\n\nThanks,\n\nCraig\n\n\n\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, Chad Woolley &lt;lists@t...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hello,\n&gt; \n&gt; I am writing a test related to XML parsing.  In the setUp() of my\ntest, I read \n&gt; an InputStream as follows:\n&gt; \n&gt;    inputStream = this.getClass().getResourceAsStream(&quot;sample.xml&quot;);\n&gt; \n&gt; ...where sample.xml is in the same directory as my TestCase.\n&gt; \n&gt; I then have a &quot;sanity&quot; check test to make sure I read the\nInputStream correctly:\n&gt; \n&gt;    public void testSampleInputStreamIsValid() {\n&gt;      assertNotNull(&quot;InputStream should not be null&quot;, inputStream);\n&gt;    }\n&gt; \n&gt; When I run this from within my IDE (Eclipse), it works fine -\nwhether I run the \n&gt; test directly, or from a suite (which is in another package).\n&gt; \n&gt; HOWEVER, whenever I run it from Ant or Maven, I get a failure\n(InputStream is null).\n&gt; \n&gt; This is probably a basic question related to reading InputStreams,\nbut I&#39;m not \n&gt; sure what is wrong.  Hopefully someone can help, or refer me to some\nhelpful \n&gt; documentation.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Chad\n\n\n\n  _____  \n\nYahoo!
