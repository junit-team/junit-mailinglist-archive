    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1794100604\">I know the JUnit homepage lists article and links of interest to users of<br/>\nJUnit, and I was wondering if anyone on the list knew whom I would submit a<br/>\npotential link to.<br/>\n<br/>\nI recently co-authored a book (with Rick Hightower) covering Automated<br/>\nTesting and continuous integration using JUnit and several of the extensions<br/>\nthat have also been listed on the web-page (JUnitPerf, HttpUnit, and<br/>\nCactus). It also covers Ant and JMeter (a couple of essential Jakarta<br/>\nprojects). The book includes a case study in applying each framework to an<br/>\nonline pet store, and would serve as an excellent resource for anyone<br/>\nwishing to explore JUnit as well as several of it OS extensions.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe homepage for the book, including on-line source code is at:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.rickhightower.com/JavaXPToolkit/\">http://www.rickhightower.com/JavaXPToolkit/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re working on getting a couple of sample chapters up for your perusal.<br/>\nThe book can be purchased directly from John Wiley at:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.wiley.com/Corporate/Website/Objects/Products/0,9049,1847817,00.ht\">http://www.wiley.com/Corporate/Website/Objects/Products/0,9049,1847817,00.ht</a><br/>\nml<br/>\n<br/>\nor Amazon.com at:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/047120708X/qid=1008780346/sr=8-1/ref=\">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/047120708X/qid=1008780346/sr=8-1/ref=</a><br/>\nsr_8_3_1/103-8597614-7170265<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry for this sounding like a plug--I mean it is, but I think the book<br/>\nwould be of legitimate interest to users of JUnit, both the readers of the<br/>\nmailing list and the viewers of the web-page. Part of our goal in writing it<br/>\nwas to generate publicity for the tools that have helped us so much.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\n<br/>\nNick</div>",
