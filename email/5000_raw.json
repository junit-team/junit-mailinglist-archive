You may \nbe using a class variable to serve as the unique ID.  If so, try \nchanging that to use a class method which asks for a unique id...  Do \nyou see where I&#39;m going?  E.g.\n\n  private static int idSeed = 1000;\n  public static int uniqueId() {\n    return ++idSeed;\n  }\n\nThere is a problem with this approach, but it is the same as you face \nwith your current implementation.  If the idSeed variable is \nhardcoded (as in the example above), each time you rerun the tests, \nyou will have had to make sure you removed the results from your last \ntest run.  Resolving this problem will be left as an exercise to the \nreader.\n\nRegards,\n\nManuel Amago.\n\n\n",
