The final goal would be to have the tool\n&gt;comparing the class to the test_class and create stubs for new methods\n&gt;while leaving the existing ones untouched. &lt;snip /&gt;\n\nFolks, I know I&#39;m a broken record on this one, but...\n\n...let&#39;s not forget that testing is a mindful activity, and not a mindless \nactivity. Generating test stubs, especially from classes already written, \nrelieves you of the need to think about what you&#39;re testing. This is a bad \nthing, and often a Bad Thing.\n\nDo you really need to test every method on your class? Can you remove them \ninstead? Can you consolidate them into a smaller number of methods? Should \nthey be on other classes? These are all questions that you should ask \n*especially* before writing tests for code already written. Particularly if \nyou didn&#39;t write the code but need to write the tests. By writing the tests, \none by one, thinking clearly about what feature (not method) you&#39;re testing, \nyou are forced to answer all these questions. This helps your design. That&#39;s \na Good Thing.\n\nIf the original poster has already thought of all that and decided that \ngenerating test stubs is appropriate, then that&#39;s great; but if not, he \nshould reconsider before diving in. I&#39;ve been there, and it wasn&#39;t a fun \ntrip.\n\nDon&#39;t mind me.\n\nJ. B.
