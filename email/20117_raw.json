JUnit 4.4 does include method annotations\nin the Description, which should help one of your frustrations.  Were\nyou using the default JUnit that ships with Eclipse (currently 4.3.1)?\n\nIt sounds like you also wanted to allow users to register a listener\nregardless of how the tests were run, which TestNG does with a\ncommand-line parameter, and JUnit currently does not support.  This\nsounds like a valuable feature--is a command-line parameter the ideal\nway to do it?\n\nThe default runners for JUnit classes should be out of &quot;internal&quot;\nstatus soon.  We focused first on making it possible to run any\nconceivable set of tests from JUnit, especially crazy stuff (such as\nRuby tests: http://johlrogge.wordpress.com/2007/09/08/hybrid-theory/).\n A major focus of 4.5 is making it easier to make finer-grained\nextensions to JUnit&#39;s built-in runners, without touching internals.\n\nOne more favor--can you explain how FEST currently was capturing\nscreenshots from JUnit, and why that didn&#39;t work when running tests\nfrom Eclipse?\n\nThanks again,\n\n   David Saff\n\nOn Nov 19, 2007 12:52 PM, Alex Ruiz &lt;alruiz15@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Greetings,\n&gt;\n&gt; This past weekend I tried to extend JUnit 4 and it was a very\n&gt; frustrating experience. I have documented what I found at\n&gt; http://www.jroller.com/alexRuiz/entry/junit_4_vs_testng_extensibility .\n&gt;\n&gt; I might be missing something.
