Iam working as a Software Test Engineer in Chennai.\n\nI need some help from you guys and gals. \n\nIam assigned for Java based white box testing. I need to study both Java and Junit within 20 days time. Iam new to both Java and Junit.\n\nCould anyone tell me how to prepare for that(java, junit and white box testing). \n\nHow much java knowledge should I need to work in this white box testing?? \n\n If u have any junit study material send it to me. Because iam new to Junit and Java.  \n\nAnd also try to get me the details about Junit. How to prepare for that. And how to test Java projects using Junit. \n\nHoping to hear from you soon.\n\nRegards,\n\nM.P.Thangaraju\n\n \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
