That way you have many small test methods which make it<br/>\neasier for the reader of the test class to understand your tests. <br/>\nPersonally, I don&#39;t consider it a good idea to use the same OUT (object<br/>\nunder test) for provoking different exceptions in a sequence since clean<br/>\nrecovery from exceptions is often problematic and you might run into<br/>\nsubtle variations of your behaviour. <br/>\nHowever, sometimes it is crucial to test that another exception does (or<br/>\ndoes not) occur after a first one has already been thrown (and handled<br/>\nsomehow). In that case<br/>\ndo in your test what you would do with your first exception in client<br/>\ncode, e.g. catch and ignore it. Then provoke the second exception and<br/>\ncheck that it&#39;s being thrown.<br/>\n<br/>\nJohannes<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nataliabello@...\">nataliabello@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hello!<br/>\n&gt; I am testing a method that throws different exceptions.<br/>\n&gt; Til the moment i use one testXXX method for each exception, but i<br/>\n&gt; would like to know if there is a way to test all the different<br/>\n&gt; exceptions in one test method.<br/>\n&gt; The problem is that if one of the exceptions fails ( no exception is<br/>\n&gt; thrown) the other situations are not tested.<br/>\n&gt; Is there any way to do it; some way of collect the results and make<br/>\n&gt; the test at the end??
