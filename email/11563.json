In the <br/>\nmeantime J.B. is providing good cover.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing that&#39;s missing from this discussion is the notion that mocks <br/>\nare a /design/ technique. You should use them to help you discover an <br/>\nobject&#39;s neighbours, you can test the interactions before the objects <br/>\nexist. Write the object under test as if it had the neighbouring objects <br/>\nit needs, using mocks to implement them, then implement the neighbours. <br/>\nRinse and repeat (remembering to write some integration tests to glue <br/>\nthe whole thing together). You should find this pushes you towards <br/>\nsmaller focussed objects and interfaces which some of us think is a Good <br/>\nThing.<br/>\n<br/>\nSteve<br/>\n<br/>\nJ. B.
