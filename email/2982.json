When I run under<br/>\n&gt;junit, it can&#39;t find some org.xml classes.

In some of<br/>\n&gt;my code,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I reference classes in org.w3c.dom and org.apache.crimson. Now, as<br/>\n&gt;soon as<br/>\n&gt; &gt; junit came across classes from these packages, it threw class not<br/>\n&gt;found<br/>\n&gt; &gt; exceptions. Please note that this doesn&#39;t happen in the the textui<br/>\n&gt;nor my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; own testing classes, since they are both in the classpath.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; org.w3c.dom specifically is in the rt.jar<br/>\n&gt; &gt; org.apache.crimson is a separate jar, which is on my classpath<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; After a bit of digging around in the source code, specifically in<br/>\n&gt;the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; TestCaseClassLoader, I found out about the<br/>\n&gt;junit&#92;runner&#92;exclude.properties<br/>\n&gt; &gt; file. When I added these package names to that file, things seemed<br/>\n&gt;ok, and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; those exceptions didn&#39;t take place.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; What confused me was why it didn&#39;t find the classes, even though<br/>\n&gt;they was on<br/>\n&gt; &gt; my classpath, especially the org.w3c ones which are in the rt.jar<br/>\n&gt;(with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 1.4). Furthermore, this was only a problem when using the swingui,<br/>\n&gt;with the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; textui, it was fine.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve got it working now that I put those details in the<br/>\n&gt;exclude.properties<br/>\n&gt; &gt; file. Is this perhaps a issue with using 1.4?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Any comments or explainations?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Thanks<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Anthony<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Your use of Yahoo!
