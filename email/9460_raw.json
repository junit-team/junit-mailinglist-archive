Regression test prioritization is a \n&gt; &gt; method of organizing test cases such that those tests deemed to be \n&gt; &gt; more effective by a test adequacy criterion are placed at the \n&gt; &gt; beginning of a regression test suite.  The tool that I plan to build \n&gt; &gt; will be implemented as an extension to JUnit.  As part of my \n&gt; &gt; analysis, I shall run my prioritization tool on a set of test cases \n&gt; &gt; for a real world Java application to see if the rate of fault \n&gt; &gt; detection increases.  If anyone has a Java application with a \n&gt; &gt; substantial set of JUnit test cases or would like to suggest a site \n&gt; &gt; with an application and test cases that I can download, I would \n&gt; &gt; appreciate the contribution.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thank you for your consideration in this matter.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; &gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
