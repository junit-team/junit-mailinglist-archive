B. Rainsberger wrote:\n&gt; &gt;So said Chris Dollin on 2003-08-04 --------------------\n&gt; &gt;We have an interface (Graph) with multiple implementations (A and B).\n&gt; &gt; [Some names have been changed to avoid complications.] I have a test case\n&gt; &gt; AbstractTestGraph with an abstract method Graph getGraph(), where the\n&gt; &gt; tests test the Graph(s) that getGraph() returns, and TestA/TestB define\n&gt; &gt; getGraph() to return instances of A/B as appropriate. So far, so good,\n&gt; &gt; and just as suggested in one of the Junit documents. The code for each\n&gt; &gt; test case is nice and short.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Well ... I lied about A and B; it&#39;s more like A, B, C, and X. And likely\n&gt; &gt; to be more, since Y and Z exist but may not be properly included in the\n&gt; &gt; test suite at the moment.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;(1) How can I write a test generator which takes A.class, X.class etc as\n&gt; &gt;arguments and constructs the necessary suite?\n&gt;\n&gt; I didn&#39;t understand this question.\n&gt;\n&gt; True or false: you want to create a test suite consisting of tests for all\n&gt; the implementations of an interface. (Please answer.)\n\nErm ... no, that&#39;s not it, quite. Apologies for unclear writing (perhaps,\nunclear thinking ...)\n\nI want to write a method M which given a class C which is supposed\nto implement interface I will return a suite which runs the abstract test\ncases ATC for I with respect to the implementation C. I happens to be\nGraph and the C&#39;s are implementations of Graph and there are enough\nC&#39;s that writing out explicit subclasses of ATC for each C is a pain.\n\nThis makes it easy for the writers of the different C&#39;s to run the \nabstract test cases. \n\n&gt; The obvious-to-me code\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;    public static TestCase makeMyTest( final Class someGraph )\n&gt; &gt;        {\n&gt; &gt;        class TestSomeGraph extends AbstractTestGraph\n&gt; &gt;            {\n&gt; &gt;            public TestSomeGraph( String name ) { super( name ); }\n&gt; &gt;            public static TestSuite suite() { return new TestSuite(\n&gt; &gt;TestSomeGraph ); }\n&gt; &gt;            public Graph getGraph()\n&gt; &gt;                 { return someGraph.getConstructor( new Class[] {}\n&gt; &gt;).newInstance( new Object [] {} ); }\n&gt; &gt;            }\n&gt; &gt;        }\n&gt;\n&gt; This appears to try to build concrete test cases\n&gt; (http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?AbstractTestCases) on the fly given an abstract\n&gt; test case. I have never thought of doing this before, but it makes sense.\n\nYes, I thought so too. [I have a functional programming / Lisplike background;\nhigher-order programming comes naturally.]\n\n&gt; Assuming that this is what you&#39;re trying to do, then I assume you have:\n&gt;\n&gt;    * An abstract test case GraphTest\n&gt;    * An interface Graph\n&gt;    * Implementations of Graph\n\nYes [GraphTest is called AbstractTestGraph, but what&#39;s an alpha-conversion\nbetween friends?].\n\n&gt; You would like to generate a test suite consisting of XTestCase for each\n&gt; implementation XGraph of Graph where XTestCase creates an instance of\n&gt; XGraph to test.\n\nWhat&#39;s important is not to be able to create a suite of them all (although\nthat might be nice), but to be able to trivially able to create a suite for\neach one to be plugged into the locally appropriate test-cases.\n\n[When I say &quot;suite&quot; am I being sloppy? I really mean &quot;a test that runs\nlots of tests&quot;.]\n\n&gt; This is a neat question. Let me think about this.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;So ... am I dead-ended in the wrong alley? Missing something obvious?\n&gt; &gt;Missing something subtle? Any advice would be welcome. If I have to\n&gt; &gt;hack junit source code I will, but I feel that surely I don&#39;t need to ...\n&gt;\n&gt; I don&#39;t think you are. Dynamic invocation handlers might be the order of\n&gt; the day, or something... This seems to be easy to do in a dynamic language\n&gt; like Smalltalk. :)\n\nSo far as I can tell, it would be easy in Java if classes nested inside methods\nwere allowed to be public. I suspect the restriction was not reviewed when\nthey added reflection to the official language ...\n\n-- \nChris &quot;electric hedgehog&quot; Dollin\nC FAQs at: http://www.faqs.org/faqs/by-newsgroup/comp/comp.lang.c.html\nC welcome: http://www.angelfire.com/ms3/bchambless0/welcome_to_clc.html\n\n",
