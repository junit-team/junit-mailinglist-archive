The approach it takes is t=\r\no run the tests from\nit&#39;s own servlet, so you&#39;re running the test in the co=\r\nntainer.  It makes for\na good integration test (make sure it&#39;s deployed cor=\r\nrectly, etc.).\nDeploying to run tests may slow things down a little.\n\nAnoth=\r\ner option would be mock objects (http://www.mockobjects.com,\nhttp://www.eas=\r\nymock.org).  It has a lot of mock objects that will make your\nEJB think it&#39;=\r\ns in a container.  I actually haven&#39;t tried them for EJBs, but\nit would be =\r\nthe first place I would go.\n\nIf your EJB is simply a fa=E7ade, then I&#39;d con=\r\ncentrate more on testing the\nsupporting business classes/methods, which it =\r\nsounds like you&#39;re already\ndoing.\n\nGood luck,\n-Larry\n\n-----Original Message=\r\n-----\nFrom: skmajji [mailto:skmajji@...] \nSent: Thursday, November 04=\r\n, 2004 2:34 PM\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: [junit] EJB - JUnit Testi=\r\nng\n\n\n\n\nHi,\n\nCurrently I am writing JUnit to test our business methods on EJ=\r\nBs.
