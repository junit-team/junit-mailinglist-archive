I want to write test cases that reference in=\r\nterfaces only\n&gt; &gt;  as I want to publish them as part of a spec =96 they are=\r\n to define the\n&gt; &gt;  semantics of classes.\n&gt; \n&gt; When faced with this situati=\r\non in the past I separated the tests into\n&gt; &quot;white box&quot; and &quot;black box&quot; par=\r\nts.\n&gt; \n&gt; The black box parts I implemented as assertions about the behaviou=\r\nr\n&gt; implied by the interface.\n&gt; \n&gt; The white box parts I implemented as uni=\r\nt tests that put a known\n&gt; implementation into a known (significant) state =\r\nand then passed it to\n&gt; a black-box assertion.\n&gt; \n&gt; E.g. I might have two i=\r\nmplementations of List: LinkedList and ArrayList.\n&gt; \n&gt; I would have asserti=\r\nons that I can add an element onto the end of the\n&gt; list and retrieve the l=\r\nast element, adding an element increases the\n&gt; size by one, etc. etc..\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n I would have tests for the implementations that exercised specific\n&gt; inter=\r\nnal states.  For example, for an ArrayList I would have tests\n&gt; that added =\r\nan element to an empty list, to a list that has a full\n&gt; array that needs t=\r\no be expanded, etc.  Those tests would call the\n&gt; assertions.  Something li=\r\nke:\n&gt; \n&gt;   import static ListAssert.assertAddingAnElementIncreasesTheSizeBy=\r\nOne;\n&gt; \n&gt;   ...\n&gt; \n&gt;   @Test public void\n&gt;   addingAnElementIncreasesTheSiz=\r\neByOne() {\n&gt;        assertAddingAnElementIncreasesTheSizeByOne(new ArrayLis=\r\nt());\n&gt; \n&gt;        List listAtCapacity =3D new ArrayList(4);\n&gt;        listAt=\r\nCapacity.addAll(Arrays.asList(1,2,3,4));\n&gt;        assertAddingAnElementIncr=\r\neasesTheSizeByOne(listAtCapacity);\n&gt;    }\n&gt; \n&gt; If those tests got too large=\r\n (as above), I&#39;d break them into separate\n&gt; test methods.\n&gt; \n&gt; --Nat\n&gt;\nWhat=\r\n I am trying to avoid are explicit references to implementation\nclasses in =\r\ntest cases, like in\nassertAddingAnElementIncreasesTheSizeByOne(new ArrayLis=\r\nt());. \n\nThe background of my question is the following: I want to use test=\r\ns in\na scenario where interfaces describe services (like in OSGI). When a\ns=\r\nervice becomes available (a class implementing the interface), I want\nto ru=\r\nn all tests for this service at runtime (!) to verify that the\nservice has =\r\nthe correct behaviour. I cannot do this at build time as\nthe service is dis=\r\ncovered dynamically and I don&#39;t own the\nimplementation. So I somehow have t=\r\no inject the service implementation\ninto the test case before setUp is exec=\r\nuted.\n\nJens\n\n\n",
