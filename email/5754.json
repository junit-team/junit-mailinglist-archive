The<br/>\nunsupported, open-source-produced Ant &lt;jpcovreport/&gt; task produces nicer<br/>\nHTML reports than JProbe&#39;s commercial one. Source code line counts in<br/>\nJProbe don&#39;t include abstract classes or interfaces or any class that<br/>\ndidn&#39;t get loaded at runtime, so they can be a little hard to fathom if<br/>\nyou use something like JavaNCSS to count your source.  The Ant task can<br/>\nproduce more accurate counts of source code by using a reference path to<br/>\nyour source code.  JProbe seems to run best with IBM 1.3 JVM on Windows.<br/>\nCan hang (with any JVM) if there&#39;s heavy duty RMI usage in your tests or<br/>\nclasses.  Needs lots of heap (at least -Xmx128m).<br/>\n<br/>\nBorland&#39;s OptimizeIt Coverage (formerly VMgear):<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.borland.com/optimizeit/code_coverage/index.html.\">http://www.borland.com/optimizeit/code_coverage/index.html.</a>  Fairly<br/>\nrecent addition to the OptimizeIt suite.  I was in the beta and was<br/>\ndisappointed that they did nothing to improve on some of the lacking<br/>\nfeatures of JProbe (like branch coverage).  Basically the same tool as<br/>\nJProbe with a different UI.  Might be worth looking into if you buy the<br/>\nwhole suite bundled with JBuilder.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs others already mentioned, Clover, which I like because it&#39;s<br/>\nintegrated with Ant out of the box, cheap as hell, and provides branch<br/>\ncoverage as well as the usual line and method coverage.  Downside to<br/>\nClover is that you have to precompile all your code.  Nice thing about<br/>\nJProbe and OptimizeIt is that they can run on class files or jar files<br/>\nwith no precompilation step necessary.  But the Clover reports are the<br/>\nbest looking of all and the price is right: $125 for one user.  Not sure<br/>\nhow accurate the source line summaries are off the top of my head, but I<br/>\nwould expect them to be pretty accurate since it uses Antlr to<br/>\ninstrument the source rather than runtime bytecode instrumentation.<br/>\n<br/>\nCompuware/NuMega have a code coverage tool in DevPartner TrueCoverage<br/>\nfor Java.  Similar to JProbe and OptimizeIt except it also supports code<br/>\ncoverage for C code.  Ditto for PureCoverage, the Rational code coverage<br/>\ntool.  I didn&#39;t like the PureCoverage GUI, and the tool required a<br/>\nprecompilation step.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest,<br/>\n<br/>\nScott Stirling<br/>\nFramingham, MA<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: arieroy2002 [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:arieroy@...\">arieroy@...</a>] <br/>\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, September 11, 2002 5:16 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: [junit] Re: JUnit Test coverage - Statement complete<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --- In junit@y..., &quot;shmaytan&quot; &lt;shmaytan@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hi!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I have a bunch of white-box Junit tests and I would like to check if<br/>\n&gt; I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; have executed every line of code with the tests.
