I&#39;m still looking into various \npossibilities of approaching the problem:\n\nProblem:\n&quot;This is a 5 year old system (or better,&quot;evolved over 5 years&quot;), \ninto production and has been working satisfactorily. (written using \nJava, EJB, JMS, Sybase and is pretty huge one). So far there is no \nautomated testing employed to test this system. Now that I have \nrecently been into this team, I&#39;ll have to come up with some way of \nautomating the testing process.&quot;\n\nI&#39;m looking at various possibilities. Are there any general \nprinciples to make old code, Unit test compliant?\n\nThanks,\nKalyan.\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;J. B. Rainsberger&quot; &lt;jbrains@r...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; Kalyan Kumar M wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; There is one db sitting behind the server. The server would \nexecute\n&gt; &gt; the query (mostly stored procs) on the db would get the result,\n&gt; &gt; convert it to markup and sends it to the client. So, if I \nunderstand\n&gt; &gt; you correctly, you are asking me to separate the testing work for\n&gt; &gt; both the server and the db. How can I do that? What will the \nserver\n&gt; &gt; query then?\n&gt; \n&gt; Is this right?\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. The server talks to the database synchronously, the database \nresponds.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2. The server formats the response into a message, then puts the \nmessage \n&gt; on a queue.\n&gt; \n&gt; 3. The client receives the queued message.\n&gt; \n&gt; Here&#39;s my plan of attack:\n&gt; \n&gt;   * Write one set of tests for interaction #1: check the database \n&gt; contents for each query the server executes.\n&gt; \n&gt;   * Write a small set of tests for #2: verify that the server can \nformat \n&gt; each kind of database response correctly as a message.\n&gt; \n&gt;   * Write /one/ more test for #2: verify that whenever the server \n&gt; executes a query, it also puts a message on a queue. (The \npreceding \n&gt; tests verify that it&#39;s the correct message, because the preceding \ntests \n&gt; verify that the message matches the database response.)\n&gt; \n&gt;   * Write a set of tests on the client for #3: verify that for \neach \n&gt; different kind of message the client could receive--just invoke \n&gt; onMessage()--the client reacts correctly.\n&gt; \n&gt; That&#39;s the whole thing.\n&gt; -- \n&gt; J.
