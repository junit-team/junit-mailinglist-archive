The tests takes a long while to run and is really\nfrustrating, but I could not come up with a solution.\n\nMaybe I am missing something here. The logic in the database is rather\ncomplicated and the accuracy of queries is one of the most important thing\nin the application. Now my question is how can I mock hibernate in a way\nthat to test accuracy of my query? I would appreciate any advise here.\n\nRegards,\nArash\n\nOn 9/28/07, Stephen Smith &lt;steve@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;   Hi,\n&gt;\n&gt; I consider myself more of a mockist TDD practitioner than a classicist\n&gt; these days - I would strongly advocate mocking to\n&gt; keep your tests fast and simple. Why test a third party application such\n&gt; as Hibernate? That&#39;s not your job, surely?\n&gt;\n&gt; If you want to test your classes which use Hibernate, mock the actual\n&gt; Hibernate classes within your code and write some\n&gt; behaviour driven tests, e.g. &quot;my fetch method calls Hibernate with this\n&gt; HQL&quot;. That way you ensure you&#39;re using Hibernate\n&gt; in the right way.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;d also advocate writing tests against your Hibernate config... test\n&gt; _how_ you use a third party application like\n&gt; Spring or Hibernate, but not the third party application itself.\n&gt;\n&gt; S\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt; Stephen Smith, MEng (Wales).\n&gt; http://www.stephen-smith.co.uk/\n&gt;\n&gt; Arash Bizhan zadeh wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi,\n&gt; &gt; I understand that using of mock object is ideal, but the problem is\n&gt; fetching\n&gt; &gt; the data from db is complicated and these tests I am talking about is to\n&gt; &gt; test the overall functionality of the system and also test the hibernate\n&gt; DAO\n&gt; &gt; objects; that&#39;s why I prefer to use the database data to run the test.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; Arash\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; On 9/25/07, Ilya Zelker &lt;i.zelker@... &lt;i.zelker%40gtisoft.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;mailto:i.zelker% &lt;i.zelker%25&gt;40gtisoft.com&gt;&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; One solution to consider is to use &quot;mock&quot; objects.

The application is a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; database backed application and I want to test the db functionality.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For this purpose, first thing to be done is database populating\n&gt; which\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; itself is a test suite. Is there any way to specify the order or\n&gt; tests\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in Junit?
