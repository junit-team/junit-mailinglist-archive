It should look like that:\n\nURLClassLoader clas=\r\nsLoader =3D new URLClassLoader(new URL[]\n{outputDirectory.toURL()}, JUnitCo=\r\nre.class.getClassLoader());\n\nNow everything works fine. Thanks for help :)\n=\r\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, Miles Parker &lt;milesparker@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Mi=\r\nchal,\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m not so sure on the JUnit side (see my own post on a somewhat=\r\n\n&gt; different issue) but I can comment on the dynamic class loading part.\n&gt; =\r\nAs Gilles says, you can&#39;t be certain that you&#39;re using the same class\n&gt; loa=\r\nder. I&#39;d suggest that a good strategy for figuring this out is\n&gt; divide and=\r\n conquer. First take JUnit out of the equation and see if\n&gt; you can get any=\r\n kind of newly created class to launch on save.\n&gt; \n&gt; For more on some dynam=\r\nic class loading ideas for Eclipse, perhaps this\n&gt; blog entry I wrote will =\r\nhelp..\n&gt; \n&gt; http://milesparker.blogspot.com/2009/03/dynamically-loading-cla=\r\nsses-using.html\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Sat, May 16, 2009 at 8:59 AM, blekit@... &lt;ble=\r\nkit@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hello,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; i&#39;m currently writing a plugin w=\r\nhich is supposed to launch JUnit4 Tests\n&gt; &gt; after each save. So far i&#39;m onl=\r\ny loading every class that is changed using\n&gt; &gt; IResourceChangedListener an=\r\nd URLClassLoader:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; URLClassLoader classLoader =3D new URLClassLoader=\r\n(new URL[]\n&gt; &gt; {outputDirectory.toURL(), new\n&gt; &gt; URL(&quot;file:/D:/eclipse/plug=\r\nins/org.junit4_4.3.1/junit.jar&quot;) });\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Class&lt;?&gt; clazz =3D classLoader=\r\n.loadClass(fileName);\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; At this point everything looks great - when i=\r\n modify JUnit4 test class it\n&gt; &gt; gets loaded with annotations on proper met=\r\nhods (thanks to second URL -\n&gt; &gt; without it no annotation was loaded, and t=\r\no be honest i don&#39;t know why).\n&gt; &gt; However, things start to go wrong when i=\r\n pass the loaded class to\n&gt; &gt; JUnitCore.run method - the result i always ge=\r\nt says that there was &quot;No\n&gt; &gt; runnable method&quot; exception even though there =\r\nare clearly some method\n&gt; &gt; annotaded with @Test...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I have little e=\r\nxperience in writing plugins for Eclipse, so i&#39;m kind of lost\n&gt; &gt; now... I =\r\nmay suspect, that the problem is with not sufficient classpath\n&gt; &gt; (cause i=\r\nt seems that it was a reason why i had to add another URL to class\n&gt; &gt; load=\r\ner) of my plugin. So i&#39;m asking if anyone ever tried to dynamically load\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; test classes from Eclipse plugin and run them using JUnitCore - if so, I&#39;=\r\nd\n&gt; &gt; be very grateful for helping me out with this problem.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks=\r\n in advance.\n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Michal Olejnik\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n",
