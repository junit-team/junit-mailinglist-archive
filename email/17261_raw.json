Its core is an object, say APP, static reference of which\n&gt; is kept in the main class (much like in singleton, but the\n&gt; constructor&#39;s not private; for the above stated reasons I don&#39;t want\n&gt; to discuss this detail).\n&gt; \n&gt; *snip*\n&gt; \n&gt; And what&#39;s what started to give me trouble recently. It is possible to\n&gt; initialize this APP object, loading GUI modules or not. To be honest,\n&gt; using it without UI is a workaround of mine, which I implemented to be\n&gt; somewhat closer to unit testing, although my tasks are actually\n&gt; regular regression tests, examining whole big chunks of\n&gt; functionality... So in a part of my tests that don&#39;t need the\n&gt; graphical modules, I simply don&#39;t load them. However, I&#39;ve recently\n&gt; been trying out some other type of tests that operate on a\n&gt; full-fledged application, which needs loading the UI. And that&#39;s where\n&gt; the problem begins - trying to load those modules, having used the\n&gt; application without them in previous tests, is in the application, as\n&gt; it currently is, impossible (and don&#39;t think that anyone will take\n&gt; grumbling of a humble tester into consideration).\n&gt; \n&gt; So the question to you guys is as follows: should I give up hope that\n&gt; my job has anything to do with unit testing, and allow dosens of funny\n&gt; windows to jump here and fro while basic functionality is being\n&gt; checked or rather do you see any other possibility to solve my problem\n&gt; that I, humble rookie, overlooked?\n\nIf the app class has a non-private constructor, then your tests don&#39;t \nneed to instantiate it as a singleton, right? And you also modifed the \napp class so that you can suppress the loading of the UI modules. What, \nthen, is impossible about having some tests instantiate the app without \nthe UI bits, and other tests that do?\n\n\n",
