Buy my book!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Someone saying they&#39;re too <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; busy to write an article right now is perfectly good reason - no-<br/>\n </span></blockquote>one <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; here has to answer your questions in your timeframe.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think if a person jumps into a discussion and says, &quot;Your approach <br/>\nsucks.  Buy my book!&quot; they should at least explain why.  That might <br/>\nactually be helpful to others.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Yet, I haven&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; seen any explanation as to what is inferior in your approach - <br/>\n&gt; asserting it&#39;s inferior does not make it so.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I couldn&#39;t agree more.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I also found the waving <br/>\n&gt; of the moderator stick distasteful; it&#39;s far too early for that.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; A suggestion - stop posting for 24 hours on this thread, then come <br/>\n&gt; back to it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Bill de hÓra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Whoops, too late for that!  Heheh.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the record, I never said I disagreed with what Dave and J. B. are <br/>\nadvocating.  I never said I didn&#39;t like them personally, either.  <br/>\nIt&#39;s the delivery of their message I find curious.  It seems more <br/>\ngeared toward self-interest than equitable exchange or mutual benefit.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike</div>",
