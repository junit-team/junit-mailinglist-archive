I am going to<br/>\nrecommend to the QA team and engineers at Macromedia.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m pretty well beyond the book&#39;s coverage on JUnit and Ant, so those<br/>\nsections weren&#39;t of interest to me, but what was interesting was the<br/>\ncoverage of JMeter, JUnitPerf, HttpUnit, and Cactus.  Sometimes it will be<br/>\nmuch faster for folks to use a book like this to get up to speed on those<br/>\ntools than if they were left to figure them our for themselves (which many<br/>\nwill never bother to even try).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe best thing about it just from browsing it for a few minutes was that I<br/>\nlearned that JMeter has grown up quite a bit since I last checked it out<br/>\nover a year ago.<br/>\n<br/>\nScott Stirling<br/>\nJRun QA<br/>\nMacromedia<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Nicholas Lesiecki<br/>\n<br/>\nGosh, this is the second time I&#39;ve made a post to a mailing list and<br/>\nforgotten to include some important detail!
