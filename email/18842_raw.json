I expected to talk a little about Theories and\nassertThat, but we ended up having a wide-ranging discussion about a variety\nof topics. I mind-mapped the result and put in on the conference wiki: \n\nhttp://www.agileopennorthwest.com/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?FutureOfUnitTesting\n\n \n\nThe most surprising result to me was the interest in language features for\ntesting-what would a language look like that included double-checking as a\nfirst-class concept? I was also surprised at how much commonality there was\nbetween the unit and functional testing &quot;vendors&quot;, that reporting is a big\nissue for everyone.\n\n \n\nOne thing missing from the discussion was much talk about the hopes and\ndreams of users, so I thought I would open up the question here. What is it\nyou wish your testing tool would do for you that it doesn&#39;t?\n\n \n\nCheers,\n\n \n\nKent Beck\n\nThree Rivers Institute\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
