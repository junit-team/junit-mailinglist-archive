What Agitator can do for you is \ngenerate test data that gets you code coverage and then shows you \nwhat it observed in the form of class and method invariants.  These \nobservations are in the form of Java boolean valued assertions.  For \nexample:\n\t\n\tFile.canWrite() == true\n\nOr\n\tFile.getPath().equals(&quot;C:&#92;foo&#92;bar&quot;)\n\nOr\n\tFile.list().length == 14\n\nThe developer looks at these observations and if they match the \nexpected results they can check a box and turn that into an \nassertion - the equivalent of writing &quot;assertEquals(14, \nFile.list.length)&quot; in Junit, for example.\n\nIf the observations don&#39;t match the expected behavior, the developer \ncan modify them.  For example, if the number in the last assertion \nwas supposed to be 17 instead of 14, the simply edit the observation \nand then &quot;promote&quot; it into an assertion:\n\n\tFile.list().length == 17\n\nOr the developer can create new assertion to associate with the \nmethod.\n\nCombined with Agitator&#39;s ability to automatically generate very \nrelevant test data and achieve very high code coverage automatically \n(through data flow analysis and other dynamic techniques), automated \nobservations are a powerful and very efficient way to create unit \ntests quickly to get the developer to consider inputs and conditions \nthat they might have missed.  But the developer input is still \nrequired to decide if what Agitator observed is what the code is \nsuppsed to do.\n\nI&#39;ll stop here because I don&#39;t want to use this forum to promote \nAgitator, but I wanted to clear any misconceptions and answer J.B.&#39;s \nquestions.\n\nIf you want to learn more about our Agitator and our experiences \nwith this new way to approach unit testing you can check out:\n\nwww.developertesting.com/\n\nThanks,\n\nAlberto\n\n\n\n\n",
