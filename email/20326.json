I&#39;ve a unit test case<br/>\n&gt;  which makes sure my functionality is working as per expected behavior.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  The method I followed here is simple, I&#39;ve tried injecting the mock<br/>\n&gt;  objects into my code so that my functionality uses the mock objects<br/>\n&gt;  instead of actual &#39;Real Time&#39; Connection object.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  But after I finished the whole functionality, I realized that it<br/>\n&gt;  didn&#39;t work with a &#39;Real Time&#39; Connection object. I figured out the<br/>\n&gt;  reason is that I never worried about the &#39;Real&#39; connection object when<br/>\n&gt;  I was unit testing my code.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  My question is..<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  1) Whose responsibility is to initialize this &#39;Real&#39; object in my class ?<br/>\n&gt;  2) Should my unit tests cover this &#39;Initializing real time objects&#39; as<br/>\n&gt;  well ?<br/>\n&gt;  3) What way I can assure that my &#39;Real&#39; objects are initialized<br/>\n&gt;  properly ?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  I&#39;m totally stuck here. Any suggestion would be of great help to me..<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Thanks in advance.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Sarat<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
