What would someone motivate to do so?\n\n&gt; The source (or byte) cod=\r\ne can always be forked. At that point it&#39;s out\n&gt; of my hands, and not reall=\r\ny my responsibility.\n\nAgreed. And I think the same is true when someone pro=\r\nvides his own\nimplementation of an interface. He had to do so deliberately,=\r\n so it&#39;s his\nresponsibility to make it work.\n\n\n&gt; But they can&#39;t just\n&gt; swap=\r\n out my class for a different one, if I&#39;ve written the\n&gt; implementation to =\r\ndepend on classes rather than interfaces. That&#39;s\n&gt; pretty much the point. \n=\r\n\nExactly. And to me that&#39;s a *disadvantage*, because it makes the system le=\r\nss\nflexible and reusable.\n\n \n&gt;&gt; Thirdly, interfaces define contracts. Imple=\r\nmentations which do not\n&gt;&gt; conform to the contracts aren&#39;t socially respons=\r\nible - you shouldn&#39;t\n&gt;&gt; build them that way. How do you make sure you build=\r\n them right?\n&gt;&gt; Testing, peer reviews, and well-defined types.\n&gt; \n&gt; All goo=\r\nd ideas, but if this were sufficient we never would have needed\n&gt; access pr=\r\notection in the first place.\n\nWhat makes you think we *needed* it?\n\n\n&gt; Howe=\r\nver one\n&gt; thing they all have in common is that they&#39;re using my code becau=\r\nse\n&gt; they implicitly or explicitly trust me and my library(s). I promise\n&gt; =\r\nthat the library behaves in a certain way under certain conditions and\n&gt; ac=\r\ncomplishes certain tasks. I can do this only because my libraries\n&gt; are des=\r\nigned around concrete classes.\n\nI don&#39;t think the last sentence is true. Fo=\r\nr example &quot;under certain\nconditions&quot; could include &quot;for implementations tha=\r\nt conform to the contracts\nas defined in the interface&#39;s javadocs.&quot;\n\n&gt; If s=\r\nomeone replaces the BAR\n&gt; class with a misbehaving version, then not just B=\r\nAR but also FOO and\n&gt; everything else that depends on it could be compromis=\r\ned.\n\nAgain, I think of this as a feature: by replacing the Bar class with a=\r\n\nversion behaving differently, I can customize the behaviour of the whole\ns=\r\nystem.\n\nJust think about the Comparator interface. Of course I can implemen=\r\nt a\nComparator that doesn&#39;t conform to the Comparator contract (for example=\r\n one\nthat isn&#39;t symmetric), but that is *my* responsibility, not Sun&#39;s. (Su=\r\nn&#39;s\nresponsibility is to communicate the contract, of course.)\n\nMy 0.02...\n=\r\n\nCheers, Ilja\n\n\n",
