Some of these are actually quick<br/>\n&gt;functional/acceptance tests which are testing the object interaction. <br/>\n&gt;So, with those few taken out (about 10 - 15), our tests take under 2<br/>\n&gt;minutes.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Summary: 2 minutes for somewhere around 1185 tests.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is excellent. Mike Bowler&#39;s open source package gsbase runs tests<br/>\nat about 100/second. He has &gt;700 tests.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have 1185 tests in 120 seconds, that&#39;s quite good. Imagine how<br/>\ngreat life would be if they were an order of magnitude faster,<br/>\nthough... :)<br/>\n<br/>\nThis has to do with understanding the role of programmer tests as<br/>\nopposed to customer tests. I have some fuzzy ideas in this direction,<br/>\nbut nothing to make a paper possible yet. The bottom line is<br/>\nunderstanding the importance of blazing fast programmer tests and of<br/>\nseparating PTs from CTs.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to get into the next gear, I suggest you run CruiseControl<br/>\nin the background, running all the tests, then partition the PTs from<br/>\nthe CTs. Hammer on the PTs until they run at 100/second. Run AllTests<br/>\nonly before integration.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, I understand that this is a non-trivial task, but it&#39;s worth<br/>\ninvestigating, at a minimum.<br/>\n<br/>\nJ. B.
