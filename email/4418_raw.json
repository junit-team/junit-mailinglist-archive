Having generated tests and \nachieve 100% statement coverage don&#39;t proof that you have tested what \nyour application _must_ do.  Even in a white box effort, you still have \nto go through all your tests to validate them.  Example:\n\n    /**\n     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if argument is null\n     */\n    public void toto(Integer tata) {\n       if (tata == null)\n          throw new IllegalStateArgument();\n       ...\n    }\n\nyou can achieve 100% coverage with a generated test, but this test will \nnot validate your program (because you don&#39;t throw the right exception). \n  You will then have to go through _all_ your tests to validate them.\n\nOf course you will review every single test and you will end up with a \nset of valid tests.  But I doubt that everyone will be so careful.  And \nbecause all the tests pass, you don&#39;t know where to start (no error to \nfix), so you&#39;ll take class number 1 and review the tests, class numer 2...\n\n&gt; This can help identify impossible paths in your \n&gt; code, as well as rare paths that lead to exceptions (such as null pointers).\n\n\nI already thought of that and I think that a simple tool to discover \nnull pointers could be helpful.  It can be a special TestCase of another \nJUnit.  But I don&#39;t think that if you generate &quot;validation&quot; tests for \nJUnit, you should reuse these tests as the basis for your &quot;unit&quot; tests.\n\nBut I&#39;m ready to be convinced\n\n-Vladimir\n\n-- \nVladimir Bossicard\nwww.bossicard.com\n\n\n",
