TDD is a powerful tool, but not as much as &quot;simple  <br/>\n&gt; testing&quot;.  If a<br/>\n&gt; developer prefers to write code first and tests then, that&#39;s  <br/>\n&gt; perfectly fine<br/>\n&gt; with me.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It&#39;s not fine with me.  In the end, if a developer can show me that s/ <br/>\nhe&#39;s got very high test coverage, then I&#39;d accept the effort.  But  <br/>\nI&#39;d also strongly suggest that they write their tests first next time  <br/>\nto see if they don&#39;t find that they get done quicker and with a  <br/>\nbetter design.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The important point here is that this developer needs to agree<br/>\n&gt; that writing tests is part of her job.  At least to a certain extent.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I disagree that there is a limited responsibility.  A developer  <br/>\nshould not release code that they haven&#39;t tested.  They should not  <br/>\nrelease a line of code that they have not tested.  Every line, every  <br/>\nstatement, every condition should be tested before the developer  <br/>\nreleases the code.  It seems to me that&#39;s a minimum professional  <br/>\nstandard.  Releasing code that you have not thoroughly tested is,  <br/>\nsimply, unprofessional.<br/>\n<br/>\n----<br/>\nRobert C.
