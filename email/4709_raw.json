They run in a specific \nsequence and get their data from the property files. That is fine for \ncompleted tests.\nBut we need something like a workflow in the tests; eg. test1 creates \nsomething in the database and test x uses the same data to verify \nsome additional testcases.\nWe started to examine jxunit, unfortunately it is not that well \ndocumented..\n\ncheers\n\nerik\n\n--- In junit@y..., &quot;Bill Laird&quot; &lt;wlaird@w...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hi Erik - I&#39;m not quite sure what you are trying to say. Unit tests \nin the classic sense are mutually exclusive from functional tests. \nThere may be some overlap in coverage, but there is no union of test \ncases. \n&gt; \n&gt; Is what you are trying to say is that you want to use Junit as a \nframework and harness for black box functional testing of Java API&#39;s? \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; Bill \n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;   From: erikstunkat \n&gt;   To: junit@y... \n&gt;   Sent: Wednesday, April 17, 2002 4:26 AM\n&gt;   Subject: [junit] junit tests and functional/ integration tests\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   Hi,\n&gt;   I know that unit tests should run on their own and every test \nshould \n&gt;   be executable of its own - but..\n&gt;   we want to use unit tests for a QA related functional framework \nand \n&gt;   we yet defined some tasks with ant to run tests in a specific \norder. \n&gt;   My question: is there any extension for junit to define \nproperties \n&gt;   for tests in a more straightforward way then java properties \nfiles \n&gt;   (xml?) and to combine several unit tests with global attributes \nand \n&gt;   properties?\n&gt; \n&gt;   thanks in advance!\n&gt; \n&gt;   erik stunkat\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;         Yahoo!
