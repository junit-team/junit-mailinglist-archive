Anyways -\n&gt; here is the question repeated.\n&gt; \n&gt; Do you mean that sometimes it is not commercially desirable to\n&gt; improvde design and at such times, JUnit&#39;s inability to be flexible is\n&gt; a limitation?\n&gt; \n&gt; Group,\n&gt; \n&gt; I guess I understand what this thread means, but if anyone wants to\n&gt; confirm it, that will be good too.\n\nLet me try to clarify, since my innocent remark started this.\n\nSome designs are difficult to test with JUnit, especially the way I \nchoose to use it. When I come across such a situation, I generally \nchoose to believe that JUnit is encouraging me to change my design in a \nway that makes it better. There are those who choose to believe that \nJUnit is unable to test their design, and that&#39;s JUnit&#39;s fault.\n\nOr:\n\nSometimes it&#39;s difficult to test a given design with JUnit. Some choose \nto believe that&#39;s a limitation of JUnit; others believe that&#39;s a \nlimitation of the design being tested. I am one of the latter.\n-- \nJ. B.
