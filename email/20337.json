Many times I&#39;ve seen teams do &quot;TDD&quot; but only<br/>\nwrite unit tests.  They had integration problems that were only<br/>\nbrought under control when they started writing end-to-end tests.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe most alarming I&#39;ve seen was a team that used FIT to drive their<br/>\nbusiness objects, not drive the app end-to-end.  The business signed<br/>\noff functionality based on the FIT tests but I found that the main<br/>\nmethod contained nothing but one comment: &quot;TODO write this&quot;!  Of<br/>\ncourse, that&#39;s a process breakdown not a technical problem, but an<br/>\nentertaining scare-story nonetheless in a Daily WTF kind of way.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Nat</div>",
