Let&#39;s handle this one really well in the FAQ, including all\n&gt;&gt; opinions, and point future instances of the question to the FAQ.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; This entry is weak in the draft FAQ right now:\n&gt;\n&gt; ----\n&gt;\n&gt; Why does JUnit only report the first failure in a single test?\n&gt;\n&gt; A single test method may contain multiple assertions, but the test\n&gt; method fails as soon as any of its assertions fail.\n&gt;\n&gt; By design, JUnit assumes there&#39;s no reason to report multiple failures\n&gt; in a given test method. Once a test fails, it can only fail more and\n&gt; clutter the output with side-effect failures.\n&gt;\n&gt; ----\n&gt;\n&gt; I intended to mention where to get the patch for collecting multiple\n&gt; failures, among other things.\n&gt;\n&gt; If anyone wants to take a shot at elaborating on this, it would be much\n&gt; appreciated!
