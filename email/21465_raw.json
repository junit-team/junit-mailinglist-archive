It&#39;s n=\r\not a blocking problem for me either (I can give up using annotations in leg=\r\nacy test classes, and migrate each class atomically).\n\nBelow are details of=\r\n why this is hampering me.\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, David Saff &lt;david=\r\n@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; If your test class extends TestCase, then the 3.8 rules are =\r\napplied\n&gt; exactly.  There are still lots of tools that depend fairly strong=\r\nly \n&gt; on that guarantee.\n\nOK, so this is intentional. And I understand your=\r\n point that specifying the execution rules while mixing both 3.8 and 4.x ru=\r\nles may be non-trivial.\n\n&gt; 1) In your current case, it would require very l=\r\nittle effort to\n&gt; annotate the remaining desired methods with @Test.\n\nI don=\r\n&#39;t understand: the problem is merely that the @Test annotation is not taken=\r\n into account as soon as the test class extends TestCase.\nMaybe what you me=\r\nan is, it would would require very little effort to\nnot extend TestCase? ye=\r\ns of course, but this is a contrived SSSCE just to demonstrate the issue.\n\n=\r\n&gt; Is there a real situation in which\n&gt; it is a significant amount of effort=\r\n to update a class all at once?\n\nAgain, I don&#39;t understand. What I have is =\r\na real situation where it is a significant amount of effort to remove TestC=\r\nase from the test hierarchy:\n\nI just happened to stumble on a fairly big he=\r\nap of tests which are organized in a class hierarchy (OrderDaoTestCase DaoT=\r\nestCase extends BaseTestCase extends TestCase). jUnit4 annotations are disr=\r\negarded in OrderDaoTestCase, as it indirectly extends TestCase.\n\nIf I want =\r\nto benefit from jUnit4 annotations in OrderDaoTestCase, I can either:\n- bre=\r\nak this hierarchy before extending BaseTestCase: this would be heavy work (=\r\nlots of utilities in BaseTestcase, could have been written as static utilit=\r\nies or helper classes, but the legacy situation is that most of these usefu=\r\nl utilities are based on instance methods or protected fields).\n- simply ma=\r\nking BaseTestCase not extend TestCase: that would break those test subclass=\r\nes that do rely on being indirect TestCase subclasses (ex: non-static asser=\r\nt methods).\n\n&gt; 2) Where did you look in the documentation?  Where would be =\r\na natural place to see this behavior described?\n\nOK this is a trick questio=\r\nn because I mentioned &quot;the documentation&quot; :o)\nYour question made me search =\r\nfor the docs I had read, and I realized that most of them are not from the =\r\njUnit team (or on the jUnit website).\nAs far as the standard doc is concern=\r\ned, well, this issue is probably too far-fetched to deserve an entry in the=\r\n short cookbook (which no more describes 3.8-style anyway).\nI expected I wo=\r\nuld find it in the FAQ (must not be as frequent as I thought).\n\nThis is pro=\r\nbably merely a subject for a tutorial on migrating from 3.8, which may seem=\r\n obsolete as of today, but I&#39;m sure there still exists lots of 3.8 test cod=\r\ne in the field.\n\nBest regards,\n\n    Jerome.\n\n\n",
