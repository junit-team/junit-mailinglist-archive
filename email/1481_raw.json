The\n&gt; package-scope clients usually have a public interface of their \n&gt; own which can\n&gt; then be tested separately from the classes they interact with.  \n\nThis is fair enough in a &quot;write tests first&quot; situation; I agree\nthat the tests of the public methods should be exhaustive enough\nthat they exercise any protected or private methods that are \nutilised by the public methods.\n\nHowever, the situation I described, and a situation for which I\nthink JUnit is an excellent tool, is one in which someone is \nrefactoring an existing code-base.  I&#39;ve inherited 15,000+ lines\nof code, and want the freedom of being able to &quot;smell a code smell&quot;\nand get right in there and fix it up, irrespective of whether the\n&quot;smell&quot; occurs in a public, private, or protected method.  However,\nbefore I change ANYTHING in a system that is in production, and\nit to all intents and purpose, working, I have to ensure that I\ndon&#39;t break existing functionality.\n\nIf my methodology is to &quot;smell the bad smell, write a Unit Test to\nconfirm how I believe the protected/private method is working, \nrefactor the offending code, and then IIABDTTPMIFI&quot; (if it ain&#39;t\nbroke, don&#39;t tell the project manager I fixed it) is guaranteed\nby rerunning of the JUnit test.\n\nIn this instance, I very much see the need to be able to use JUnit\nto test protected and private methods.\n\nFWIW, I found the JUnitX package at www.extreme-de.com, which\nserves my needs perfectly, and also plugs in to my favourite\narchitecture level IDE, Together UML.\n\nGlad my occasional thread has prompted so much useful (for me)\ndiscussion !\n\nBest wishes,\n\nSteven\n\n",
