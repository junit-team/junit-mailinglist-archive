It was related to JUnitParams runner (http://code.=\r\ngoogle.com/p/junitparams) which BTW. has been released today in the new ver=\r\nsion. \nNot only does JUnitParams solve the issue stated in the github comme=\r\nnts you posted, but many others as well... You&#39;re welcome to use it ;-)\n\nPa=\r\nwel\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;foo_bar_baz_qux&quot; &lt;dimitar.dimitrov@...&gt;=\r\n wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I was going to start a new thread, but I&#39;ll plug in here, to ke=\r\nep the discussion in one place.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have had the same problem, different=\r\n solution and the patch is in github: https://github.com/KentBeck/junit/pul=\r\nl/145\n&gt; \n&gt; Florian has same problem, different approach: https://github.com=\r\n/KentBeck/junit/pull/358\n&gt; \n&gt; May the Powers That Be realize that this is a=\r\n very annoying aspect of JUnit (forcing us to count lines when a test fails=\r\n) and consider including any of these patches in the JUnit tree.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best =\r\nregards,\n&gt; Dimitar\n&gt;\n\n\n\n",
