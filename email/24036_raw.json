In my mind that&#39;s in line with the most &quot;obvious&quot;=\r\n semantics.\n\n(Example: if a test is annotated &#39;UI, componentX&#39;, then it sta=\r\nnds to reason that it&#39;s a UI test of some program component X. If I want to=\r\n run only non-UI tests, or want to disable testing of said component, then =\r\nthe filters &#39;!UI&#39; and &#39;!componentX&#39; do the right thing, respectively.)\n\nChe=\r\ners,\nStephan\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, Sebastian Hennebrueder &lt;usenet@=\r\n...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I would like to introduce negation but then I believe we ha=\r\nve to put another constraint.\n&gt; \n&gt; To avoid not running tests I would put t=\r\nhe negation on the group filtering not the groups for the tests.\n&gt; \n&gt; This =\r\nallows to say: Just run all but the slow integration tests.\n&gt; \n&gt; The proble=\r\nm:\n&gt; Image you run a suite filtering for: not groupA\n&gt; \n&gt; and you have a te=\r\nst being marked with: groupA, groupB\n&gt; \n&gt; If you compare not groupA to grou=\r\npA do you fail or not.

I feel that (the need) for such an annotation implies a ris=\r\nk that test go easily lost (this is implemented on class-level in the Regex=\r\npSuite in the project unofficialjunit on SF). \n&gt; &gt; An inconvenience of this=\r\n approach is the need for some rigour when naming classes and packages. On =\r\nthe other hand, this rigour may anyhow be needed to separate &quot;true&quot; unit te=\r\nsts from integration tests, etc.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; And yes, I would chip in to reimp=\r\nlemente categories in one way or another.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Cheers,\n&gt; &gt; Georg\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; --- In junit@yahoogroups.com, David Saff &lt;saff@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Clas=\r\nses as categories was my idea.
