Yeah, I know, storytests-using-junit is odd, but the explanation\nis simple:  our customer team is composed entirely of folks who can\nread/write/tweak java at will, are comfortable with the IDE, etc.\nThey still *look* FIT&#39;ish, just with extra parens and ;&#39;s.\n\nOn Fri, Jun 20, 2008 at 9:59 AM, milesy1981 &lt;chrismiles@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Good Afternoon,\n&gt;\n&gt; I am trying to implement a better JUnit strategy here, and I was\n&gt; wondering if anyone has any tried and test ways of seperating out\n&gt; their different classes of testing. The line here is very fuzzy\n&gt; between what is an actual unit test and what is an integration test\n&gt; and I am trying to make that much more clearer.\n&gt;\n&gt; I want to have a bunch of test cases which purely test classes in\n&gt; isolation and test that their behaivour is as expected from an API\n&gt; standpoint, but I also want another set of tests which will test the\n&gt; actual functional and integration of things like making sure the\n&gt; integration with Spring and Hibernate is actually working and as I\n&gt; expect.\n&gt;\n&gt; Has anyone done this kind of seperation here before. I am just\n&gt; looking for any methodologies for seperation of these tests in\n&gt; regards to packaging, and running them etc. I run my tests from\n&gt; maven and it would be good to run the two sets of tests seprately\n&gt; from each other.\n&gt;\n&gt; Many Thanks.\n&gt;\n&gt; Chris\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n",
