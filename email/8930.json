I do know that there are collectors out there which do.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I guess there is a constant tussle between a pure framework<br/>\n&gt; and use case, but this feels like some sort of software<br/>\n&gt; evolution to me. I used to use suites, I used to use the<br/>\n&gt; Swing Runner, but now I use Eclipse and I&#39;ll never go back.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I just tried the testcase collector of Eclipse and found that it simply<br/>\nis to slow for me. I am working on projects consisting of 1000+ classes<br/>\nand I don&#39;t want to wait several seconds every time I start the tests. I<br/>\nguess it would be similar for Ant - our Ant builds already take far too<br/>\nlong, using a collector probably wouldn&#39;t improve the situation.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; When does the new user case become the norm? When does the<br/>\n&gt; framework change to satisfy the new users?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I still don&#39;t understand why the framework needs to change. Ant, Eclipse<br/>\nand other projects show very well that you can do what you want without<br/>\nneeding to change the framework.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards, Ilja</div>",
