Most<br/>\nlibraries of today are extendible - in fact, they often provide only<br/>\ninterfaces without implementations. As an (not really good, but easily<br/>\navailable) example, take JDK&#39;s Runnable interface. Obviously, you would<br/>\nhave written a test with a concrete class implementing Runnable - at<br/>\nleast to test the Thread(Runnable) and Thread(Runnable, String), but<br/>\nalso SwingUtilities.invokeLater(Runnable) and others. These concrete<br/>\nclasses are therefore part of your test suite. My question somewhat<br/>\nrephrased:<br/>\nWhen this last happened to you,<br/>\n<br/>\na)/b) did you javadoc these classes - which might be interesting for the<br/>\nAPI user as useful small examples? - <br/>\na) in the Javadoc of the library (where they clutter up the &quot;real API&quot;,<br/>\nbut are readily available)<br/>\nb) in a separate Javadoc?<br/>\n<br/>\nc) Or do you deliver the examples as code only and point the users to<br/>\nsome test/examples directory, without giving them Javadoc for those<br/>\nclasses?<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards<br/>\nHarald M. Mueller</div>",
