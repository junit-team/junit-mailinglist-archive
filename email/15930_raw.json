Thanks,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; That&#39;s pretty interesting. I like the formal introduction to JUnit.\n&gt;\n&gt; I noticed that the author points out the danger of using Pluggable\n&gt; Selector and reflection in general.\n&gt;\n&gt; What&#39;s up with that? Why do so many people find reflection so dangerous?\nI wouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s dangerous, it&#39;s just that it adds more complexity to \nthe system.  Things can break easily after refactorings because \nrefactorings don&#39;t catch the string-based reflexive name of the \nmethod/class/interface.\n\nReflection in Java is also very slow.  If used properly it doesn&#39;t \nimpact the system too much.  But that makes the system more brittle \nbecause as a developer I have to *know* that a certain part of the \nsystem uses reflection and therefore I need to tip-toe around it (eg. I \nwouldn&#39;t want code to call into that part of the system in a tight loop \nor something).\n\nI have often found that there are other ways around using reflection in \nJava.  The Adaptor pattern for instance is a simple way of implementing \nthe Pluggable Selector.  It will respond to refactorings, it doesn&#39;t add \nmuch complexity, and it&#39;s efficient.\n\n-- \nJason Rogers\n\n&quot;I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I,\nbut Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in\nthe flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved\nme, and gave himself for me.&quot;\n    Galatians 2:20\n\n (&#92; /)\n  0 0     www.squeak.org\n  =*= \n\n\n",
