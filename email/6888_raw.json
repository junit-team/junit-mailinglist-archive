Testing is not a behavior of most objects.  So we should hope to\n&gt; test most objects without modeling testing in them in any way.  So how do\n&gt; you make things testable without corrupting the object design with behaviors\n&gt; added or modified just to make objects testable?  [...]\n\nI gather from your comments that you consider it an important\nprinciple of object-oriented development that a one-to-one (or\nnearly one-to-one) correspondence between the objects being\nmodelled and the code objects used to model them is desirable.  I\nhave a feeling (entirely unsupported by any knowledge of the\nhistory of the field) that this principle might have arisen in the\ncontext of the analysis and design of simulations, rather than\nmore general software development.  It belongs to simulations,\nimho, and is not very useful elsewhere.\n\nFor example, consider the model of concurrently executing\nprocesses provided by multitasking operating systems, and in\nparticular the process and resource objects of such models.\n\nProcesses do not represent any real-world object; they are\nentirely constructs of the model.  The question of faithfulness of\nrepresentation doesn&#39;t arise.\n\nResources often do represent real-world objects, but it is highly\ndesirable that the representations have properties those objects\ndo not -- sharability among concurrently executing processes, for\nexample.\n\nThis illustrates a mode completely different from that of\nsimulation, one in which the greatest good of the model is\nconvenience for its clients (be they software or human), and\nfaithfulness of representation is, if not meaningless, of\nmarginal, zero, or even negative utility.  In such modes, adding\nbehaviour to improve testability does not necessarily corrupt the\ndesign.  (Refactoring might be better, but adding might do.)\n\nAdding such behaviour might even improve the design: testable code\nis easier to change, not only because tests can tell you when your\nchanges have broken something, but also because testable code is\nin general more modular.  Changeability is imho the most desirable\nproperty of code, and beats faithfulness of representation any\nday.  Fred Brooks writes that you should plan to throw one\nimplementation of your system away, since you will anyway.  (It\nmight be said that the XP folk plan to throw away *every*\nimplementation.)  This summarizes quite nicely my own experience,\nwhich is that the code changes many times during development and\nmaintenance.\n\n-- \nSteven Taschuk           |   7&#92; 7&#39;Z {&~         .
