For example, I find that people who disagree with my convictions<br/>\n&gt; call me dogmatic, and I find that to be a cop-out on their part. I would<br/>\n&gt; find it easier to take your ideas seriously if you didn&#39;t pose them as<br/>\n&gt; being against some nonexistent testing dogma.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I should add to clarify my position that I think you&#39;re wonderful, I <br/>\nlike you and I respect you, but I just dislike quite strongly the way <br/>\nyou present these ideas. You&#39;re naturally free not to care about that, <br/>\nbut I hope you continue to like and respect me, as I think you do.<br/>\n<br/>\n[More concisely: it wasn&#39;t a personal attack, so please don&#39;t take it <br/>\nthat way.]<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ.
