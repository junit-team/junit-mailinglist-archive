You can just<br/>\n&gt;&gt;use reflection to pick up all of the methods on a test case class that<br/>\n&gt;&gt;accept and return void and treat them as tests.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;    <br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;True, that.  I&#39;ve invited Steve to contribute a custom runner for<br/>\n&gt;JUnit 4 that does just that.  There&#39;s two specific problems with the<br/>\n&gt;suggestion:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;1) JUnit 4 allows test cases to inherit from domain classes, sometimes<br/>\n&gt;a useful trick when migrating legacy code, which would break using<br/>\n&gt;this scheme.<br/>\n&gt;2) We would then need to annotate classes, or packages, or something,<br/>\n&gt;to indicate which classes should be used as tests, to allow nifty test<br/>\n&gt;runners like ant or Eclipse to work their automagic.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Neither of these is a death knell to the idea.  But I&#39;m still afraid<br/>\n&gt;of introducing &quot;punning&quot; like this by default.  As an example, Ruby&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;test::unit, by default, automatically picks up any loaded subclass of<br/>\n&gt;TestCase (wouldn&#39;t _that_ be lovely) and runs it.  But doing so makes<br/>\n&gt;the Abstract Test Case pattern unusable.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;So far, this is mostly justification of conservatism, so I&#39;m open to<br/>\n&gt;further opinionating.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It&#39;s a funny thing about this.  I guess that this could work for JUnit <br/>\nbut sometimes ideas just need a different context to shine.. .the idea <br/>\ncould be great with one set of feature but then be odd when laid along <br/>\nside another set of features.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMichael Feathers<br/>\nmichaelfeathers.typepad.com<br/>\nwww.objectmentor.com</div>",
