Here&#39;s\nwhy I ask...\n\nIf you copy an exception eg. junit.framework.AssertionFailedError, from the\nJBuilder message area into the &quot;Run | Add Exception Breakpoint&quot; dialog it is\npossible to pick up a carriage return at the end of the exception name (You\ncan tell if this happened by looking at the Run | View Breakpoints list--the\nCR will show up as a funny character at the end of the class name)      JB\nwon&#39;t break for the exception you wanted if it has the extra CR.  To avoid\nthe problem, go to the end of the class name and backspace once to zap the\ncarriage return.\n\nTod Landis\n\n\n\n\nJoi Ellis wrote:\n\n&gt; On Wed, 14 Mar 2001, Michael wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; I found a couple others have this same problem (the debugger doesn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; stop at the breakpoint) and I haven&#39;t found a solution.
