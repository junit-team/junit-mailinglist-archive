[...]<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; minimizes the length of names where possible ([...]).<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Using this and other techniques they typically shrink<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Java code by well over 50% for a small one-time cost<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in terms of computer cycles (it takes about 4 minutes<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to process 3.8 MB of code on an 800 MHz PC).<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; That&#39;s an interesting assertion.  I&#39;m not sure that I<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; can relate it to the presence or absence of comments,<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; particularly since comments don&#39;t end up in the compiled<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; code.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;--- Jim Dixon &lt;jdd@d...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Of course.  But one of the subthreads in this discussion<br/>\n&gt;&gt; is that comments can be made unnecessary by, for example,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; appropriate choice of variable/method/class/etc names.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; This is something that we all do, I imagine.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; But the longer and more meaningful the names, the slower<br/>\n&gt;&gt; the code ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>--- Ron Jeffries &lt;ronjeffries@X...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; In what language is this true, and why?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It&#39;s easy to see how, in Java and .Net, longer and more meaningful <br/>\nmethod, parameter and [in Java] local variable names can <br/>\nincrease &quot;compiled&quot; class sizes, and hence load time.  These <br/>\nlanguages include a significant amount of metadata (&quot;source code&quot; <br/>\ninformation) in their &quot;compiled&quot; class files.  Therefore, longer <br/>\nnames will cause some slight increase in the time needed to read the <br/>\nfiles, download the &quot;executable&quot; code across a slow network, and <br/>\npossibly even the time needed to process the &quot;code&quot; once loaded.  <br/>\n(Though that last point is questionable, unless the machine is so low <br/>\non memory that it must resort to paging to process &quot;in memory&quot; data.)<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, in most applications, run time is much longer than load <br/>\ntime, and the Just In Time (JIT) Java compilers will render symbol <br/>\nname length irrelevant as they translate to machine code.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, there&#39;s still some cost, in memory, to maintaining all <br/>\nthis reflection / &quot;linker&quot; / &quot;debugger&quot; symbolic information in <br/>\nmemory.  But I don&#39;t see any reason to be concerned about it unless <br/>\noverall measurements of actual application performance indicate that <br/>\nthere&#39;s a problem.  And if there is a real performance issue, we can <br/>\ncertainly use tools, such as the IBM tools mentioned above, to <br/>\neliminate much of this extraneous and unnecessary debugging <br/>\ninformation from the production builds.</div>",
