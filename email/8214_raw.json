The problem was one\nof the stupid errors that&#39;s incredibly obvious after you see it.\nThe search path described in the documentation mentions junit.jar.\nSo, of course, I initially had a path that specified junit.jar\nwithout also listing the home directory.  I erroneously thought\nthat the test classes would be found automatically, but of course\nthe search must see\n$JUNIT_HOME:$JUNIT_HOME/junit.jar\nin order to find *both* TestRunner and the test classes.\n\nThis is so obvious in hindsight I feel terribly silly.\n\nSorry for having wasted the time and bandwidth.  I&#39;ll try to\nask less trivial questions in the future.\n\n\n\n",
