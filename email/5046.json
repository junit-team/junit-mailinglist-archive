I created a collection ( <br/>\ncollection &quot;A&quot;) that contains my expected results. My test case <br/>\ncreates a collection (collection &quot;B&quot;). Now I need to ensure that the <br/>\nitems in &quot;A&quot; are the same items that are in &quot;B&quot;. I can create my own <br/>\nmethod that takes both collections as parameters and returns a <br/>\nboolean if the items are the same ( by looping through the <br/>\ncollections) but was wondering if there was a way to use an assert* <br/>\nmethod to do the same thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks.</div>",
