Using JTest is in the same category as  \n&gt; turning up the warning level on your compiler all the way. It \nallows  \n&gt; you to flag &quot;unsafe&quot; constructs and finds things which are likely \nto be  \n&gt; errors, but no automated tool can judge intention, so they cannot \nfind  \n&gt; real design errors. Unit Testing does not find these errors either \nper  \n&gt; se, but the *process* of Unit Testing and TDD uncovers them. Take \nthe  \n&gt; following piece of (pseudo) code:\n&gt; \n\nSame can be said about the process of writing a contract (Design by\nContract) and then the code which obeys that contract. Its a cyclic\nprocess like TDD but much more natural.\n\n&gt; /**\n&gt;   * @post return =  x * i\n&gt;   */\n&gt; public int f(int x, int i)\n&gt; {\n&gt;      return x * i;\n&gt; }\n&gt; \n&gt; Is this code right? Who knows? What is it *supposed* to do? No  \n\nJust add a comment like &quot;sums up quantity and weeks&quot; and you&#39;re done.\n\n&gt; automated tool can tell you that the return value should actually  \n&gt; contain the *sum* of x and i. The only way to figure that out is \nto try  \n&gt; to use the code in a unit test and realize you cannot connect the  \n&gt; pieces you wish to connect or that you are getting the wrong \nanswer.\n&gt; \n&gt; A tool can generate &quot;automated&quot; test cases for the above, and \nthose  \n&gt; tools will generate data to test the post-condition. Of course \nboth the  \n&gt; code *and* the postcondition are wrong. They often will be because \nthey  \n&gt; are cut and pasted from the code. In many cases, the \npostcondition  \n&gt; cannot be expressed any more succinctly than the code itself.\n&gt; \n\nHow likely is it for programers who use JUnit to not use properly \nTDD?\nMuch more likely than using cut and paste postconditions.\n\nCut and paste are unlikely to happen. And if it happens as in your \nexample, then the method is unlikely to break and wouldn&#39;t be tested \nwith \nJUnit.\n\nConsider the examples at the JUnit site:\n\n    Collection collection = new ArrayList();\n    collection.add(&quot;itemA&quot;);\n    assertEquals(1, collection.size());\n    collection.add(&quot;itemB&quot;);\n    assertEquals(2, collection.size());\n    \nAs a postcondition it would maybe look like &quot;AFTER:size() == \nBEFORE:size()++&quot; (pseudo code). This is very readable, natural and \nof \nmuch greater use for testing and documenting than JUnit/TDD.\n\n&gt; A tool cannot automate testing because a tool does not have access \nto  \n&gt; the human context in which the code makes sense (or fails to). \nUnit  \n&gt; testing tends to uncover these errors in profusion. Often it is \nnot  \n&gt; even that test cases fail but that the errors are noticed when the \ntest  \n&gt; cases are being written and a serious mistake is uncovered. Test-\nFirst  \n&gt; Design makes this process more efficient by preventing the faulty \ncode  \n&gt; from being written in the first place.\n&gt; \n\nDbC with design time checking has no problem with beeing better at \nthis.\nIt is similiar like TDD, lets call it &quot;Contract based \nDevelopment&quot;. ;)\nThe contract is created first. Then the method is implemented. Same \nprocedure as TDD. Same benefits like JUnit/TDD plus many more.\n\n&gt; One of the largest advantages of TDD, therefore, is the switch in  \n&gt; focus, from inside to outside. Writing the test cases forces one \nto  \n&gt; look at the code being written from the point of view of the \ncaller and  \n&gt; notice errors which are not apparent from the narrow context of \nthe  \n&gt; code itself. Automated tools do not facilitate this thought \nbecause  \n&gt; their stated purpose is to remove the need to think about the \nissues.  \n&gt; Their only context is internal. And so, the issues are not \nthought  \n&gt; about and the coding happily continues right off a cliff.\n&gt; \n\nWriting a contract for a method is to switch the focus to outside.\n\n&gt; Automated tools are useful, but they do not replace discipline \nand  \n&gt; process.\n\nYes. But it is much easier to keep discipline when using Design by \nContract. I mean DbC checking at runtime and at compile time, either\nby using a special compiler or by creating automatically JUnit tests.\n\n\n\n",
