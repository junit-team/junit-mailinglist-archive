We should only test a Unit instead of testing the <br/>\n&gt;unit, the framework, the application server and the database.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;We are a 7 man team with little experience in what we do... We have <br/>\n&gt;noone in our team who is an expert.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;What we do is to use a not finished ERP business framework which <br/>\n&gt;hides away the technical EJB framework us, the Java developers. This <br/>\n&gt;framework uses CMP and a Fast Lane Reader. So there are many layers <br/>\n&gt;between the database and the test.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I suggested to use mock objects and Test Driven Development. But the <br/>\n&gt;senior programers don&#39;t want it. I listed all the many advantages <br/>\n&gt;but couldn&#39;t convince them.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Do not try to convince them. It only frustrates you and them. Wait for them to see the light. In the meantime, do what makes sense to you.<br/>\n<br/>\nInstead of mock, though, simply separate the business logic from the data access and you will see an improvement. When testing business logic, do not worry about where the data comes from -- make it come from anywhere convenient for you. In your tests, that would be memory and in production that would be the database.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck.<br/>\n<br/>\nJ. B.
