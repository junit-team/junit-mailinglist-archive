The word &quot;assert&quot; and &quot;test&quot; are both getting overloaded \n&gt; here. Such is the imprecision of English. This is similar to the problem \n&gt; introduced in Java 1.4 where Sun decided to start using the word assert \n&gt; in a way that broke pretty much every test suite on the planet.\n&gt; \n&gt; An AssertionError means that somewhere in the Java code there&#39;s an \n&gt; assert statement that failed, not that a JUnit assertMethod failed. It \n&gt; means that the stack trace will point right to the line that failed. It \n&gt; means that the detail message is precisely defined according to the type \n&gt; of assertion that failed, and the string conversion of the expressions \n&gt; as defined in section 15.18.1.1 of the Java Language Specification. It \n&gt; has a whole bunch of behavior and semantics tied up in this notion that \n&gt; just don&#39;t apply when it&#39;s caused by a JUnit test failure.\n&gt; \n&gt; \nUnfortunately, I cannot follow you :-(. Reading the AssertionError API:\n\n[quote]\nThrown to indicate that an assertion has failed.\n[/quote]\n\nWhile testing we are almost always talking about assertion. I agree that using an Error, instead of \nan exception may be just a little wrong.\nI am not sure what do you mean by &lt;&lt;right to the line that failed&gt;&gt;. Any Throwable will do just the \nsame.\nAs about the string conversion, that is only defining how a string conversion takes place, so i \ncannot see any relation to assertion.\n\nThis is beginning to sound religious, so maybe it would be better to agree to disagree :-).\n\n:alex |.::the_mindstorm::.|\n\n",
