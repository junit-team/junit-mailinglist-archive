And the discussion shows people feel some need.\n&gt; Would you agree so far?\n\nNo. I definitely did not mean to say &quot;you cannot discuss about this&quot;. I \ninvite you to consider 3 other interpretations for &quot;No you can&#39;t, and \nyou shouldn&#39;t&quot; that do not means &quot;you cannot discuss about this&quot;. (This \nis a classic exercise from the work of Jerry Weinberg.)\n\n&gt; &quot;...becausee those are 3 different tests &quot;\n&gt; hm,... these ARE 3 different tests because you make them 3 different tests.\n\nNo, they are 3 different tests because a test consists of &quot;given this \nprecondition, if I perform that action, I expect these results&quot;. Read \nany book on TDD, programmer testing or JUnit for references.\n\n&gt; What i wanted to point out is:\n&gt; this is a design decision.\n&gt; And i had the impression you negate this.\n\nIt is absolutely a design decision. JUnit does not support multiple \nfailing assertions per test in part because it is simpler to stop the \ntest when it first fails, and in part to encourage strong isolation of \ntests from each other. This has been part of the TDD literature for \nyears--Kent Beck, Test-Driven Development: By Example, in particular.\n\n&gt; hope i didn&#39;t hurt you.\n\nYou did, but I can recover from it. :) I appreciate your willingness to \ncontinue the conversation.\n-- \nJ.
