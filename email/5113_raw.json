Go with that.\n\nIf you&#39;d rather test the setters and getters (maybe\neven of just one or two classes), also well and good.\n\nPersonally, I tend not to test simple getters and\nsetters.  I may, however, after an incident a few\nweeks ago (which caused my partner and I to waste a\ngood 45 minutes), test any constructors that set\nmember variables, even if they look simple.\n\nI think the point lots of people don&#39;t quite get is\nthat this is fairly subjective.  There is not really,\nas far as I know, a &#39;YOU MUST TEST THIS OR ELSE&#39;\ndirective anywhere, either in JUnit or XP.  Test what\nyou feel comfortable testing that gives you confidence\nin your system.  \n\nIt also seems that, for some people, ignorance\nreplaces confidence ... ;)\n\n-Eric\n\n--- &quot;J. B. Rainsberger&quot; &lt;jbr@...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt; &gt; Sirs,\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I think this is important point and it is also\n&gt; possible to be added \n&gt; &gt; to FAQ:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; many programmers writes setters in following style\n&gt; (let&#39;s call it \n&gt; &gt; IBM-style)\n&gt; \n&gt; That&#39;s actually VAJ-style. :)\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; void setValue(ValueType newValue)\n&gt; &gt; {\n&gt; &gt;   value=newValue;\n&gt; &gt; }\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; while others preffer to do it in Sun-style:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; void setValue(ValueType value)\n&gt; &gt; {\n&gt; &gt;   this.value=value;\n&gt; &gt; }\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; now just imagine that while edditing your code you\n&gt; just pressed \n&gt; &gt; &quot;del&quot; key in &quot;void setValue(ValueType value)&quot; or\n&gt; made other typing \n&gt; &gt; mistake and got &quot;void setValue(ValueType vale)&quot; in\n&gt; this case code \n&gt; &gt; will compile BUT &quot;this.value=value;&quot; will be\n&gt; equivalent \n&gt; to &quot;this.value=this.value;&quot;\n&gt; &gt; some times such errors are very hard to find it\n&gt; out... If you have special\n&gt; &gt; test case for set/get you will find problem within\n&gt; seconds if not \n&gt; &gt; you will find problem only because other tests are\n&gt; failed...\n&gt; \n&gt; I agree that typos can make even the simplest code\n&gt; break, but if you want \n&gt; your tests to catch every typo, then you&#39;ll be\n&gt; testing forever. (If you want \n&gt; to test forever, I won&#39;t stop you, unless you&#39;re\n&gt; delivering code I&#39;m \n&gt; responsible for.) There are higher-level approaches\n&gt; to this problem:\n&gt; \n&gt; * Use macros to generate the source for\n&gt; getX()/setX() methods.\n&gt; \n&gt; * Stop writing JavaBeans; start writing objects. (I\n&gt; wish more people would do \n&gt; this. JavaBeans are *not* objects, they are just\n&gt; bags of data. If you&#39;re not \n&gt; using them with a JavaBeans tool, then write real\n&gt; objects!)\n&gt; \n&gt; * Use a coding convention that eliminates the\n&gt; problem. Some people like \n&gt; underscores in their fields (I don&#39;t, particularly),\n&gt; some people like &quot;a&quot; at \n&gt; the beginning of a formal parameter name (means\n&gt; &quot;argument&quot;), some people like \n&gt; to always do an explicit &quot;this.&quot; Pick one and go\n&gt; with it. If a coding \n&gt; convention can avoid the problem, great.\n&gt; \n&gt; Remember: test until fear turns to boredom. If\n&gt; you&#39;re afraid of coding a \n&gt; method incorrectly, then test it; that includes\n&gt; getX()/setX(). All we&#39;re \n&gt; saying is that many people don&#39;t fear methods this\n&gt; simple, so we don&#39;t test \n&gt; them, and we provide our justifications in terms of\n&gt; diminishing returns.\n&gt; \n&gt; If you spend three hours hunting down a bug because\n&gt; some careless person \n&gt; wrote &quot;value = value&quot;, that&#39;s a shame; however,\n&gt; writing 10000 tests, one for \n&gt; every getX()/setX() method, may not be the most\n&gt; effective use of your time. \n&gt; As always, YMMV.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Sorry, for beating the air...\n&gt; \n&gt; No, this is a good part of the argument that should\n&gt; probably be pointed out. \n&gt; Thank you for bringing it up.\n&gt; \n&gt; --\n&gt; J.
