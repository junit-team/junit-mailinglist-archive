Kent sent me a version privately <br/>\nsome time back. I don&#39;t know whether he ever released that publicly. <br/>\nThis version puts [] around the part that differs, but displays the <br/>\nentire strings.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing to do is use your IDE: both Eclipse and IDEA offer a <br/>\n&quot;compare strings&quot; feature that pops up side-by-side windows and <br/>\nhighlights the portions that are different.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing to do is compare strings less often that compare objects <br/>\nmore often, or compare shorter strings. Sometimes when testing is <br/>\npainful, the pain is trying to teach us about our design. (I don&#39;t <br/>\nbelieve this is your problem, but it might be, so I offer it as a <br/>\npossibility. Too many people discount it.)<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
