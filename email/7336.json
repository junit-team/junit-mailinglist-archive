Not sure how you could close the connection at<br/>\n&gt;&gt; the end of the last test method executed, though. Has anyone used<br/>\n&gt;&gt; static variables to share fixture objects among multiple test methods?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I did this very thing by accident - as I&#39;m new to JUnit testing.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have legacy DB code I have to test and the original author used a  <br/>\n&gt; static anonymous class to<br/>\n&gt; create the connection cache.  I use setup() to instantiate the  <br/>\n&gt; underlying class and get/close my<br/>\n&gt; DB connections in each test.  I pay the penalty for the connection  <br/>\n&gt; creation in the first test, but<br/>\n&gt; every other test is fairly fast.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So far, I&#39;ve found JUnits testing of each test method to be low level  <br/>\n&gt; in design and nature...  I<br/>\n&gt; create a method in an object and my test methods exercise my method -  <br/>\n&gt; checking for validity of<br/>\n&gt; execution.  I&#39;ve found JUnit assumes I&#39;m interested in assuring the  <br/>\n&gt; tested method executes and<br/>\n&gt; provides some specific result.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Maybe I&#39;m still too new to JUnit to know what I&#39;m missing with  <br/>\n&gt; SuiteRunner - but I&#39;ve always<br/>\n&gt; thought the first test I must *always* perform is the validation of my  <br/>\n&gt; code against the<br/>\n&gt; specifications - that what I&#39;m writing is performing to expectations.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your right, if I write code that modifies a part of my object in some  <br/>\n&gt; way, I need to insure that I<br/>\n&gt; haven&#39;t created an artifact that can damage some other part of the  <br/>\n&gt; code.  Isn&#39;t that the basis of<br/>\n&gt; performing lots of different asserts in each of your tests?  If I can  <br/>\n&gt; alter some part of my object<br/>\n&gt; thru my code, then after my code runs, don&#39;t I want to verify the  <br/>\n&gt; contents of the underlying<br/>\n&gt; object?  All within one test? (Not Suite of tests - but an individual  <br/>\n&gt; test...)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If I&#39;m too far off topic, please forgive me.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\nNot off topic at all. I was asking if anyone had used static members to  <br/>\nshare fixture among multiple test methods in a single TestCase, and you  <br/>\ndid. You even did it for a database connection, which was the example I  <br/>\nmentioned. The one question I still have about your test code is, did  <br/>\nyou find a way to explicitly close the connection after the last test  <br/>\nmethod finished? Or was it just left open under the assumption your app  <br/>\nwould go away soon enough.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne significant difference between the static member approach to  <br/>\nfixture sharing in JUnit and SuiteRunner is that I know how to close  <br/>\nthe connection when I&#39;m done in SuiteRunner, but not in JUnit. If  <br/>\nanyone has a way to do that, please reply.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother difference is really one of design taste I suspect. I just  <br/>\nfound it non-intuitive that JUnit gave each test method invocation its  <br/>\nown instance, especially when they also provided the setUp() method. I  <br/>\nused JUnit a long time before I realized this object wrapping was going  <br/>\non. In a previous post to this list, I asked if anyone could help me  <br/>\nunderstand what benefit I get for that wrapping. I mentioned that the  <br/>\nonly benefit I could see was that if I screw up my  setUp() and  <br/>\ntearDown() methods and don&#39;t actually initialize and clean up the  <br/>\nfixture correctly, the wrapping of method invocations may let me get  <br/>\naway with it. Vladimir Bossicard agreed that that was a benefit, and no  <br/>\none else offered any others.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy design sense when I was doing that part of SuiteRunner was to not  <br/>\nprovide the extra shield. I figured it would be relatively rare that a  <br/>\nuser would screw up their setUpFixture() and tearDownFixture() methods.  <br/>\nWhen they do, they get a red bar and can fix the bug like any other  <br/>\nbug. Then they get a green bar. And all the while the hierarchy of  <br/>\nobjects that make up their test is the intuitive simple tree of objects  <br/>\nthat for a long time (until I realized that the object wrapping was  <br/>\ngoing on) I imagined JUnit was building.<br/>\n<br/>\nBill<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Bob<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; __________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
