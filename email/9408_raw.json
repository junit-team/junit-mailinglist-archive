Let me\noffer some of my insight...\n\nI particularly like final on member variables.  I am a BIG fan of\ncreating immutable objects -- I like for my objects to be in a sane\nstate when they are created.  Having to set any number of things on them\nbefore being able to use them smells bad to me. --Personal tastes\nperhaps.  That doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t ever use setters, it&#39;s just that\navoid them like the plague, but sometimes they catch me.\n\nI tend to like final on classes.  Here are some reasons:\n  -- I don&#39;t see the the real strength of OOP being inheritance\n  -- putting final on a class makes me think twice when I want to\n     extend from it.  &quot;Is the &quot;IS-A&quot; relationship right in this\n     case or am I just being lazy?&quot;\n  -- others?? Maybe, but I don&#39;t have the brain power right now to\n     list them.\n\nI don&#39;t usually put final on methods.  If they are public in any sense\nof the word (default, protected, public) then they are part of the\npublic contract.  If the class is extended the subclass should have all\nthe right to override that functionality.  I tend to think that if it\nhurts too much for the subclass to override a method it indicates one of\ntwo things: the subclass probably shouldn&#39;t be there, refactor to a\nDelegate, _OR_ the method shouldn&#39;t be in the base class, refactor it to\nthe proper class.\n\nJust my $0.05...\n\n=jason\n\n\n\n\n",
