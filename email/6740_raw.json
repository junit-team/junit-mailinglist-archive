As a\ndeveloper and user involved in some oss frameworks, I&#39;m always\ninterested in different ideas that allow users of the framework to be\nable to test unencubmbered by the framework along with decoupling ideas.\n\nMike Clark &lt;mike@...&gt; writes:\n\n&gt; J. B. Rainsberger wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;Wonderfully. For those of you with taste, please prod me to get off my\n&gt; &gt;ass and write my upcoming article, &quot;Unit Testing within Frameworks&quot;,\n&gt; &gt;which covers strategies for frameworks including EJB, Servlet, Turbine,\n&gt; &gt;Struts and anything else people can suggest to me.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes, please write that article already.  :-)\n&gt; \n&gt; An alternative title comes to mind:\n&gt; \n&gt;     &quot;How to decouple your code from their framework&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; People tell me that books and articles with &quot;testing&quot; in the title don&#39;t \n&gt; sell as well as they&#39;d like.  It&#39;s a shame really, and I hope to help \n&gt; change that mentality.  One of my tactics in doing so, as you well know, \n&gt; is to convince readers that testing is also a design activity.  As such, \n&gt; I should be able to change any phrase about testing into a phrase about \n&gt; design.  It&#39;s something I&#39;ve been practicing, and this title is one \n&gt; attempt.     \n&gt; \n&gt; Now, please write that article!  :-)\n&gt; \n&gt; Mike\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; Mike Clark\n&gt; http://clarkware.com\n&gt; (720) 851-2014\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
