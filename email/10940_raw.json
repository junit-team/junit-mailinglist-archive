Just as there is no substitute\nfor actually testing the model and control, there is no substitute for\nactually testing the view itself, with actual UI events. Anything less\nis merely speculative, at best second-best.\n\nAs I have previously stated (e.g.\n\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/junit/message/10457\n\n) it was at one time legitimate to say &quot;I can&#39;t xUnit my UI, so I will\ntry to do the best I can,&quot; i.e. create a thin UI well-separated from\nits model and control. But it was *never* legitimate to make a virtue\nof necessity, to say (as you do) that &quot;separation is the solution.&quot;\nNow that you *can* drive your UIs from JUnit, and therefore you can\n*fully* test your UIs, your claim is illegitimate, and moreover\nencourages the &quot;anti-test-infection.&quot;\n\n\n",
