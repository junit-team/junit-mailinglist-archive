I have a large app that basically wraps an API. The testing \nthat has to get setup needs to compare states between the app and the \nAPI to ensure that all business rules comply at every state. Is this \nsomething that JUnit can/should do? The app has many different states \nthat I would have to setUp() but I&#39;d like to know if using JUnit is \nthe most effective way of testing this way?\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated!\nClaudio\n\n\n",
