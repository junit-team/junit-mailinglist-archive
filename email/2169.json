In response to <br/>\nmessages from other classes, ClassA must modify the state of this <br/>\ntree that it has constructed. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo I have a TestClassA TestCase which has a method testDoSomething() <br/>\nwhich calls the &quot;state changing&quot; method on ClassA. Now, how do I <br/>\nassert whether the states have changed correctly? The TestClassA does <br/>\nnot have access to the internal tree of ClassA.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have already written separate TestCases for the objects (nodes) <br/>\nmaking up the tree and those individual tests seem to be working <br/>\nfine. Does this mean that I do not need to test this from the <br/>\ncontainer class? Or is there some other way to do this?<br/>\n<br/>\nAny help appreciated.<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n--Das</div>",
