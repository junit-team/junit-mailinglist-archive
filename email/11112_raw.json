Apologies in advance if not.\n&gt; \n&gt; I am developing a Java application which needs to automate user GUI\n&gt; interaction with an existing\n&gt; Java-based GUI app.  THe app runs continuously and its GUI appearance\n&gt; is not predictable (different GUIs\n&gt; may appear during different runs of the app).  That said, the GUIs\n&gt; are fairly simple with most having an\n&gt; &quot;OK&quot; or &quot;Cancel&quot; button.  My quesiton is:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1)WOuld using Java GUI Testing tools be a viable option for this\n&gt; task?  I don&#39;t know enough about them\n&gt; to judge right off.  My final applicaiton would need to run as a\n&gt; standalone app but also with the capability of an external user\n&gt; to start and stop the app.  I looked into using the Java Robot class\n&gt; but it seems like it would lock the mouse/keyboard in the case\n&gt; of an app like mine which will run continuously.\n\nWhy are you testing the instance of your application running in \nproduction? Maybe I just don&#39;t understand why &quot;running continuously&quot; \nmatters.\n\n&gt; 2)If the answer to the quesiton above is yes..which Java GUI tool\n&gt; would be most suitable for this task?\n\nI like Jemmy, myself.\n-- \nJ.
