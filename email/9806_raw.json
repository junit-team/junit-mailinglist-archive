Proper usage.  From the Fixture section on JUnit Web site:\n&gt;  &gt; &lt;snip /&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; What you just snipped out was taken directly from the JUnit Web site.\n&gt; Just to keep things clear, let&#39;s put it back in:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Tests need to run against the background of a known set of objects. This\n&gt; set of objects is called a test fixture. When you are writing tests you\n&gt; will often find that you spend more time writing the code to set up the\n&gt; fixture than you do in actually testing values.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Pay close attention, class.  The set of objects is the fixture.  The\n&gt; fixture is what you set up.  This is clear and unambiguous English from\n&gt; the authors of JUnit.\n\nAgreed.\n\n&gt;  &gt; Let us try this again, with one slight correction.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &quot;Ah.. but in proper usage each fixture is a different TestCase class...&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Now, either\n&gt; \n&gt; *  this &quot;correction&quot; is also from the JUnit site, in which case they have\n&gt;    contradicted themselves, or\n&gt; \n&gt; *  this is simply your interpretation, in which case you should defer to\n&gt;    what the authors of JUnit.\n&gt; \n&gt; Which is it?  Searching on the Web page I gave a URL for, I just don&#39;t\n&gt; find the phrase &quot;in proper usage&quot;.\n&lt;snip rudeness /&gt;\n\nPerhaps you ought to read this.\n\n     http://www.xprogramming.com/testfram.htm\n\nThis is the paper that describes the genesis of xUnit. It predates JUnit \nand provides the foundation on which JUnit was built. A careful review \nwill reveal the following conclusions.\n\n  * [From the section Fixture] Design a fixture by creating a subclass \nof TestCase. Reasonably straightforward conclusion: different fixtures \nshould therefore be different subclasses of TestCase, probably forming a \nhierarchy where fixtures overlap. (Extract Class to remove duplication.)\n\n  * [From the section Test Case] A test case (not TestCase) is an object \nwith its own fixture (that is, it is an instance of a TestCase class). \nReasonably straightforward conclusion: test cases that share a fixture \nare reasonably expected to be methods in the same TestCase class, and \ntest cases that do not share a fixture are reasonably expected to be \nmethods in different TestCase classes.\n\nIt looks pretty safe to conclude that one ought to group test cases by \nfixture, rather than by some other means, such as &quot;tests for class Foo \ngo into TestCase subclass FooTest,&quot; which is what many people do -- and \nwhat Dave and I did before we understood what Kent really meant a \nfixture to be. It is in this sense that &quot;a fixture is a TestCase class,&quot; \nbecause one may easily put fixtures and TestCase classes in one-to-one \ncorrespondence. (Perhaps more properly &quot;fixture descriptions&quot; and \nTestCase classes, to maintain the class/object distinction.)\n\nNow I am not responsible for the content of the JUnit web site, so I \ncannot speak for that; however, if you want to argue by Appeal to \nAuthority, then those are reasonably straightforward conclusions drawn \nfrom Kent&#39;s own words. JUnit is, after all, just another instance of xUnit.\n\n&gt;  &gt; &quot;test case&quot; (as used in the document Jim quoted) == instance of\n&gt;  &gt; TestCase, usually implemented as a method on a TestCase class\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &quot;fixture&quot; == TestCase class\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; OK?\n&gt; \n&gt; Not really.  A TestCase always contains a fixture.\n\nVery well: a TestCase class is equivalent to a fixture description. I \nreally do not think we are gaining much by being this pedantic about it.\n\n &gt; This may or may not\n&gt; be clearly distinguished by putting it in a setUp() method, but it&#39;s the\n&gt; set of objects that you are running your test against.\n\nThe use of setUp() is irrelevant for our purpose.\n\n&gt; If we are going to be truly nitpicking, then recall that an object is an\n&gt; INSTANCE of a class.  A set of objects can never be a class.  It is  a set\n&gt; of instances of a set of classes.\n\nYes, but the object that contains them is a fixture. And every such \nobject instantiated from the same class embodies that fixture. As a \nresult, the class itself, being a blueprint for those objects, embodies \nthat fixture. Therefore, the test case class and the fixture are \nconceptually the same. The test case class is merely an expression of \nthe fixture.\n\nWas it really necessary to write all that? I am not J J Sylvester. I \nhave no interest in proving everything I know to you from first principles.\n\n&gt; My apologies to the wider world for starting this absurd thread; I was\n&gt; just trying to be helpful to the enquirer.\n\nNo, you weren&#39;t. Now that you have established a pattern, I feel I have \nsolid ground on which to say this. You were being antagonistic, as you \nhave often been, by pretending not only to know it all, but that \neveryone else is therefore incorrect. As I am often accused of \npretending to know it all -- and sometimes guilty of it -- I surely know \nthe signs.\n-- \nJ. B.
