This sounds like a \njob for Fit/Fitnesse.\n\nwww.fitnesse.org\n\nChaudhary, Harsh wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi all,\n&gt; I am writing tests for a project and I need help on something. I will\n&gt; try to be as brief as possible.\n&gt;\n&gt; I have about 100 excel spreadsheets that I am accessing via POI. These\n&gt; basically form the input to my system. Then I take this input and run it\n&gt; against a component to get some rates. The aim of my test is to compare\n&gt; the output coming from the rate engine to the output generated by\n&gt; formulas on each Excel workbook.\n&gt;\n&gt; If I run tests on all 100 workbooks at once, it takes a long time. And\n&gt; it takes longer to identify which workbooks have errors on them and why.\n&gt; So, I would like to selectively run tests on some workbooks only at a\n&gt; time. One way to do this is to write a Base Test Class which contains\n&gt; all the test methods and 100 Test classes (each corresponding to one\n&gt; workbook) which extend this class. Then these 100 classes are added to a\n&gt; suite and I can then run each test class independently.\n&gt;\n&gt; The problem is writing the 100 classes. Also, its hard to go on creating\n&gt; more classes if we need to test more workbooks.\n&gt;\n&gt; My question is, is there a way to programatically run tests on a\n&gt; workbook by passing in the name of the workbook. So that, for example, I\n&gt; can pass in the name of the Workbook and test would run for only that\n&gt; workbook.\n&gt;\n&gt; I did some research and it seems like a concept of a Plugggable Selector\n&gt; might do the trick for me. Its available at:\n&gt; http://junit.sourceforge.net/doc/cookstour/cookstour.htm \n&gt; &lt;http://junit.sourceforge.net/doc/cookstour/cookstour.htm&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; But I don&#39;t know this for sure. Has anyone done this before or have any\n&gt; idea how to do it?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Harsh.\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n\n\n",
