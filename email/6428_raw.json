This is an area\nthat has intrigued me ever since being defeated by SmallTalk, and\neventually entering the fold with Java.\n\nI captured the essence of what I gleaned from interviewing several\nhelpful\nO-O folks (Allen Holub and Steve Abell, in particular) in The JBuilder2\nBible (now out of print). Chapters 2, 12, and 13, in particular were\nfocused on summarizing O-O thinking, if you can find a copy.\n\nThe most eloquent, insightful people I know on the subject (in no\nparticular order) are:\n    * Martin Fowler\n    * Allen Hollub\n    * Peter Coad\n\nAnything you can find by them is well worth a look.\n\nHaving read the previous post, I&#39;ve ordered all three of the\nbooks in the Coad & Yourdon series:\n   * Object Oriented Analysis\n   * Object Oriented Design\n   * Object Oriented Programming\n\nThe ratings on Amazon indicate that they would be quite good\nfor beginners.\n\nOnce a basic understanding of O-O concepts is acquired, The\nPragmatic Programmer is a good treetop view of the territory.\nIt&#39;s a great guide that points you to things you might want to\ninvestigate further, so you know they&#39;re there, but without bogging\ndown in a lot of detail. (Which leaves you begging for more, in most\ncases.)\n\nAlso:\n  * Fowler&#39;s &quot;Refactoring&quot; book is nothing short of brilliant.\n  * The Test-Driven Development book looks great, as well,\n     (but I haven&#39;t gotten to it yet)\n\nI&#39;m a big fan of &quot;Document Driven Development&quot;, but I haven&#39;t\nseen anything on the topic, so far. (Anyone know of anything?)\n\nI&#39;ve taken to starting projects with a User Guide, a bullet list\nof Requirements, a collection of Design Notes, and a development\ncheck list.\n\nI cycle through the user guide and requirements documents, getting\nfeedback from users, and recording the results of experimentation\nand investigation in the Design Notes document (which starts as a\nseries of notes on technologies the app will use).\n\nAs the design starts to emerge, I begin developing the implementation\nchecklist, which keeps getting revised for as long as the implementation\n\ngoes on. (For example, refactoring steps go into the checklist first,\nand they get checked off as the refactoring goes on.)\n\nWhen new information and design changes occur, they impact the\ndocumentation first, and the code second. (When I get TDD down,\nI suspect they&#39;ll affect the tests second -- or maybe even first.)\n\nOf course, all of that depends on understanding objects and classes\nand how to work with them effectively. Hopefully you&#39;ll find some\nlinks to online papers among the replies to your query.\n\nIn the meantime, I&#39;ll query my publisher and see if we can find away\nto put those 3 chapters online...\n\n\n\n\n",
