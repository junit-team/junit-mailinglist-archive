I&#39;m using a custom Test Runner which filters the tests and only runs the ones that have the custom Annotation.  The problem I&#39;m having is that some classes have 0 tests with the custom Annotation.  When that happens, the class still shows up in the report but lists 0 tests.  I&#39;d prefer to only have a report with the tests that had the special Annotation, ie the ones that actually ran.  Is there a way to exclude the others from the report?  I&#39;m using Ant&#39;s junitreport task to generate the report.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nShay<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
