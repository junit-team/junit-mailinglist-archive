For example,<br/>\n&gt; when you write a failing test you can often get it to pass once you<br/>\n&gt; implement the functionality. Sometimes, however, the test still fails<br/>\n&gt; unexpectedly. That&#39;s why tests are so useful, they tell you you&#39;ve made<br/>\n&gt; a mistake immediately. Programmers who don&#39;t write tests would assume<br/>\n&gt; at the point of implementation that they hadn&#39;t made a mistake and<br/>\n&gt; continue with the next task.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; How do people fix such a failing test? What information do you use to<br/>\n&gt; diagnose and fix it? Or is it always the time to reach for your<br/>\n&gt; debugger?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I never reach for the debugger. I don&#39;t know how to use it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI try and make the tests as self-explanatory as possible. And run them as<br/>\noften as reasonably possible, so that I know what changes are responsible<br/>\nfor the sudden failure.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd when I have no clue, I drop println()s in appropriate places to try and<br/>\nget one, fix the problem, remove the printlns, and see if there&#39;s a way<br/>\nI can expose the same information with a test. But JBR is right: printlns<br/>\n(and logs) in tests are tempting but dangerous. Better would be<br/>\n<br/>\n    assertTrue( informative message, boolean )<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is a deep shame that Java doesn&#39;t have method literals (aka lambdas,<br/>\nor Smalltalk blocks, or whatever) so that `informative message` could be<br/>\na hairy expression that&#39;s not actually evaluated unless the test fails.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nChris &quot;#define ... #define ...
