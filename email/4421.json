If you have a large project to maintain,<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t write tons of tests only to have your project in the same state as<br/>\n&gt; if it would have been if written from scratch with the tf principles in<br/>\n&gt; mind.  If you do so, I think you are &quot;blinded&quot; by your &quot;love&quot; for the<br/>\n&gt; test-first principles.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Test-first principles don&#39;t espouse writing tons of tests in any case, blindly or<br/>\notherwise.  Rather, test-first principles recommend writing or changing code only<br/>\nwhen a test is failing.  So, I question how following TfD could be dangerous.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; But I never said that the test-first principles are bad for an already<br/>\n&gt; developed project.  You only have to keep your head cool and avoid the<br/>\n&gt; rush.  For me, generating tests is a symptom of this rush (&quot;let&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; quickly have 2,000 tests written for our project&quot;).  If 99% of your<br/>\n&gt; project is already working, why should you first start by writing tests<br/>\n&gt; for 100% of your code.  Concentrate your effort on the 1% that doesn&#39;t work.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes!  By all means, keep your head cool and avoid the rush.  Grow the tests as<br/>\nnecessarily.  That&#39;s one reason I asked in previous post what value there may be<br/>\nin having a complete set of automatically-generated tests.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; One principle of XProgramming is &quot;YAGNI&quot;: so don&#39;t write tests until you<br/>\n&gt; need them.  And keep in mind that the goal is not to write tons of<br/>\n&gt; tests, but to validate your code.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Absolutely!<br/>\n<br/>\nActually, the goal is to deliver high-quality software predictably and as quickly<br/>\nas possible.  Writing unnecessary tests will impede progress toward that goal.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nMike Clark<br/>\nClarkware Consulting, Inc.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.clarkware.com\">http://www.clarkware.com</a><br/>\n720.851.2014</div>",
