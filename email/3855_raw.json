The\n&gt; client tests use mock objects to simulate the server; the server \ntests use\n&gt; mock objects to simulate the client.  The client and server stay \ndecoupled\n&gt; and can be developed concurrently by the team.  These tests get run \nvery\n&gt; frequently and they don&#39;t take long to run.\n\n\nActually, the component I&#39;m testing is not that big that it requires \nseparate teams for the client and server sides. Rather, I&#39;m working \non a distributed system in which processes often alternatively play \nthe role of client and servers. My goal is to perform functionnal \ntest of the component which provides support for communication among \nprocesses. \n\nMore precisely, I need to exercise the network problems that can \noccur (which happen to behave differently based on which operating \nsystem the component is running on, albeit the program is written in \nJava), the potential threading problems (such as contention, \ndeadlocks and other safety problems).\n\nAs such, I believe the approach of mock objects is not so beneficial \nin my case, because it would require much effort to simulate complex \nexternal behaviors while still not exercizing some conditions that I \nencounter in a production environment.\n\nI agree I&#39;m trying to use JUnit for functional tests rather than unit \ntests for which it was designed. The reason I&#39;m currently doing this \nis that the Junit execution environment is convenient and well \nintegrated into our Java-base development process: Junit is \nintegrated into ANT and cruisecontrol, the two tools supporting \nautomatic build environment including automatic test execution, \ncollection of logs, analysis of test results and notification of test \nfailures.\n\nDoes anyone know an alternative to the Junit framework (i.e. a better \napproach) to support automated functional tests that include more \nthan one process (and possibly more than one computer). The goal \nstill being to run these tests &quot;continuously&quot; and to reduce manual \ntasks to a minimum in order to detect introduced bugs as soon as \npossible? \n\nThanks,\n\nGuillaume.\n\n--- In junit@y..., Mike Clark &lt;mike@c...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; Conventional wisdom says to use mock objects to simulate the \nnetwork.
