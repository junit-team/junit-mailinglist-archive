Mostly they were<br/>\nprovided as a test of the installation environment and helped<br/>\ntroubleshoot<br/>\nconfiguration problems. I have never received an off-the-shelf package<br/>\nthat came with unit-tests, but it would make my job easier.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Tue, 13 Nov 2001, Rogers, Jason wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; perhaps... but I some how think it is overrated.

By looking at their test code<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; comparing it to your code (which maybe isn&#39;t working), you can get an<br/>\n&gt; idea<br/>\n&gt; where you or the vendor are making unwarranted assumptions.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On Mon, 12 Nov 2001, David Stagner wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Rogers, Jason&quot; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;David Stagner&quot; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; Unit tests document API usage very well, for starters.  And<br/>\nthey<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; suggest<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; where any bugs encountered might be, even by their absence (a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; problematic condition may not be tested, and a set of tests<br/>\n&gt; could<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; rule<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; out a bunch of possible causes for a bug).<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; This seems like a pretty weak argument to me.  They only document<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; set of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the API that the authors chose to test, and they only test to the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; authors&#39;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; degrees of comfortability.  Truth be known, just because JUnit is<br/>\nin<br/>\n&gt; use<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; does<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; not mean that the code is being tested thoroughly.  Right?  You<br/>\nmay<br/>\n&gt; be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; right<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that it could show you what isn&#39;t tested, but not necessarily why.<br/>\n&gt; And<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; it only<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; gives you a clue as to what is not tested and what is.  There may<br/>\n&gt; not be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a one<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to one mapping of the public API to the tests.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Granted.  I was assuming that the set of unit tests theoretically<br/>\n&gt; &gt; provided by our imaginary vendor (has anyone ever seen a non-open<br/>\n&gt; source<br/>\n&gt; &gt; vendor do this?) would be reasonably thorough, complete, and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; representative.  If the unit tests don&#39;t exercise all the documented<br/>\n&gt; &gt; methods and boundaries of the API, they&#39;re incomplete anyway.  The<br/>\n&gt; hard<br/>\n&gt; &gt; part comes with testing coupling, interaction, and state changes<br/>\n&gt; between<br/>\n&gt; &gt; components, where the non-trivial bugs often lurk.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; On a more philosophical level, i&#39;d suggest that most unit testing is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; either very useful, or mostly useless, depending on the confidence<br/>\nof<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the programmer in the testing process.  Cowardly testing is a sign<br/>\nof<br/>\n&gt; a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; lack of confidence in the code.  Once a programmer gets in the habit<br/>\n&gt; of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; serious unit testing, the programmer will almost always be more<br/>\n&gt; &gt; confident in the code - and thus more likely to test thoroughly.<br/>\nGood<br/>\n&gt; &gt; unit testing is a self-reinforcing feedback loop.  And if i were<br/>\ngiven<br/>\n&gt; a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; set of unit tests from a vendor that clearly did not thoroughly test<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; public interface of the software, i would immediately distrust the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; software in question.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nEric Vought<br/>\nChief Technical Officer - QLUE Consulting, Inc.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:evought@...\">evought@...</a> toll-free: 888-771-3538  RTP area: 919-816-9901<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!
