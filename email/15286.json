None. Zip Zero. Zilch. Not even once.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have seen many, many developers discouraged from using libraries that <br/>\nwere too complex and confusing. Size of the public API is part of that <br/>\ncomplexity.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Actually, most of the time, it is.  I mentioned MIDP1 above, but even if you<br/>\n&gt; are thinking of open-source libraries, modifying the source means forking<br/>\n&gt; the code most of the time, with all the maintenance nightmare that ensue.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>But possible, which is why open source libraries are preferable.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; You seem to be living in a world where every author of any imaginable<br/>\n&gt; library is magically available and willing to make the changes you need when<br/>\n&gt; you ask for them right away.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>In general, they are, provided you&#39;re willing to pay a market rate for <br/>\ntheir time. Of course, if you want people to do things for free, then <br/>\nyou might have to wait a little longer (or not. Depends on the project.)<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the principles of JUnit is to do the simplest thing that could <br/>\npossibly work. That principle goes deeper than test-driven development <br/>\nthough. It applies in a lot of areas including API design. You&#39;re <br/>\nadvocating big upfront design, which I thought was an idea we had laid <br/>\nto rest, at least in this group. Designing an API in advance of the uses <br/>\nto which the API will be put is not only more work. It&#39;s also going to <br/>\nproduce a worse API because whatever you do design won&#39;t fit the use <br/>\ncases. It&#39;s only when you have a clear picture of what the users <br/>\nactually need to do that you can create the right API to fit the problem.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n﻿Elliotte Rusty Harold  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:elharo@...\">elharo@...</a><br/>\nXML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/\">http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim\">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim</a></div>",
