Is it possible to call such a testing as &quot;unit&quot; testing? In most cases stresstests are to figure out how set of components works, this set may be distributed between server and client, between peers, and so on... but jUnit fundamently works on one machine. I think PRIMARILY jUnit is for testing of classes or small sets of components. Am I right?<br/>\n<br/>\nPS. there is also difference between load testing and stress testing... above I gathered them under term &quot;stress&quot; :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
