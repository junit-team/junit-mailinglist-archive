Also, it is open source and \nanyone can participate in making it a better tool !\n\nThat said, let me explain a bit the philsophy behing J2EEUnit because \nit seems it is not that clear. Let&#39;s see the assumptions that are \nbehing it :\n\n- assumption 1 : the test classes need to run on the server side (in \nthe servlet engine),\n- assumption 2 : we need to be able to start these tests. So there \nare 2 solutions : make a servlet to start these tests or use an EJB. \nI have chosen a servlet because it is easier to use and some servlet \nengine do not support EJBs.\n- assumption 3 : we have to be able to call this servlet. Several \npossibilities : (1) call it manually by typing it&#39;s URL ore (2) write \nsome code that use the URLConnection class to call it. This is the \npart that I call the client side. Of course, the option (2) seem to \nbe the best because tests can be automated and the result can be \nverified (this is the endXXX() method). So we can verify if a cookie \nwas returned, if a header was set, ...\n- assumption 4 : in order to make option (2) above more sexy to use, \nI could have developed a GUI .... or integrate with an existing test \nframework. I have chosen to use the well renowned JUnit framework \nbecause everyone use it. So, the tests are started by JUnit.\n\nAnd as far as I have seen, JunitEE and JUnitServlet work on the same \nprinciple. Tell me if I am wrong here ?\n\nIf you have any idea to make it simpler please tell me. If I \nunderstand you correctly, you would like that the current J2EEUnit \nServlet actually returns HTML code with the test results ? Is that \nright ? This will free J2EEUnit from JUnit. It seems ok to me to also \nprovide this feature. What I could do, is provide another Servlet \nthat will display the result of the tests as HTML. The J2EEUnit user \nwill have the choice or using JUnit or calling directly the URL of \nthis other servlet in his browser. Would that make sense to you ?\n\nThanks a lot.\nVincent.\n\n\n\n\n",
