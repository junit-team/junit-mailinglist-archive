Is there a way that I can finish\n&gt; both these tests in 10 minutes (max time taken by Test 1)?\n&gt; \n&gt; I hope I made sense if not please let me know I will try to be more\n&gt; specific.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
