Do not get carried away by this<br/>\nexample..I am trying to sample a similar one..<br/>\nAssume the following heirarchy structure.. <br/>\nBizDoc = Performs versions/history relation functions.<br/>\nOrderDoc -&gt; BizDoc = Performs Order related functions.<br/>\nRequestDoc -&gt; BizDoc = Performs Request related functions.<br/>\nPurchaseOrder -&gt;OrderDoc = Performs PO specific functions.<br/>\nInvoice -&gt; OrderDoc = Performs Invoice specific functions.<br/>\nShipment -&gt; Orderdoc = Performs Shipment specific functions.<br/>\nAuction -&gt; RequestDoc = Performs auctions specific functions.<br/>\nPurchaseRequest -&gt; RequestDoc = Performs PR specific functions.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would prefer to organize my tests with a similar hierarchy structure<br/>\nto test the functions at the respective level.  Also I would like to<br/>\ninitialise the objects needed in the appropriate level for the childs<br/>\nto make use of them without doing them again.<br/>\n<br/>\nCurrently when PurchaseRequestUt and AuctionUt tests are run, it<br/>\nexecutes RequestDocUt tests as well BizDocUt tests twice which is<br/>\nunnecessary.<br/>\n<br/>\nI see two options .<br/>\n1. Have a single parent without testXXX methods do the on demand<br/>\ninitialisation at the top level and all Uts inherit from this single<br/>\nparent. And have Uts in a single level. In the above case BizDocUt &<br/>\nPurchaseRequestUt will be in the same level.  BizDocUt initialises<br/>\nsome objects in the helpers and make available for all Uts.  Or if<br/>\nPurchaseRequestUt is run first it initialises first all Bizdoc objects<br/>\nso that BizdocUt can run w/o initializing them again.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Maintain the heirarchy of Ut and use the Test suite in all Ut<br/>\nclasses to add the child tests only.<br/>\n<br/>\nGuys - don&#39;t you feel this is a very common need for any OO<br/>\napplication.  I am surprised JUnit doesn&#39;t provided this flexibility<br/>\ndirectly.  I have posted my requirement for Logical flow of tests<br/>\nwhich is also good to have.  JUnit has these missing.  I can<br/>\nhack(override) into jUnit to support these but I do not want to<br/>\nmaintain this for every release.<br/>\n<br/>\nJUnit folks..are you hearing...?<br/>\n<br/>\n~JAK<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Apr 8, 2005 1:04 AM, J.

Some test<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; cases are run at the parent level and some are run at the child level.<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; My observation is this. When I run my child test cases it traverses<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; to the parent and runs the parent&#39;s tests also.  My question is this..<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; <br/>\n&gt;  &gt; #1. Can I stop my derived Unit tests from running parent tests.?<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  Yes: collect the tests yourself with suite().<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  &gt; #2. If I cannot stop them, can I run them in a specific order so that<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; parent tests and then child tests..?  One I could think of is add them<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; to the Test Suite in every derived Uts.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  You could use GSBase&#39;s OrderedTestSuite.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  A bigger question: if you don&#39;t want to inherit the tests, then why have <br/>\n&gt;  one test case class inherit from another? If it&#39;s to share utility <br/>\n&gt;  features, then I recommend pushing those out to another class that both <br/>\n&gt;  can use.<br/>\n&gt;  -- <br/>\n&gt;  J. B.
