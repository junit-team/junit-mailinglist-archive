Then someone was talking about using the<br/>\nassertNotNull (and the other methods in Assert) to &quot;guard for the<br/>\nunanticipated&quot;. But the way I see it, using assertNotNull() or<br/>\nassertNotEqual() or the like means that you actually HAVE ANTICIPATED that<br/>\nsomething might go wrong here. And then I&#39;d prefer throwing a checked<br/>\nexception instead. There&#39;s nothing you can do with the Assert class that you<br/>\ncannot do in normal code lines too. So, if you think some assertThisOrThat<br/>\nmay guard against the unexpected, well, don&#39;t you think you could have<br/>\nwritten some if-statements as well, throwing some more saying exceptions<br/>\nthan AssertionFailedException? It sounds to me that the Assert class is used<br/>\nmerely because of &quot;convenience&quot;. But, as I said, I don&#39;t really see any<br/>\ndifference except whether you catch your own exception or an<br/>\nAssertionFailedException.<br/>\n<br/>\nJakob Jenkov</div>",
