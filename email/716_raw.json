We aren&#39;t quite ready, \nlargely because we haven&#39;t quite got the sourceforge infrastructure \nworking for us, but it&#39;s in the CVS repository. There&#39;s no doc, but \nthere are unit tests and a copy of our XP2000 paper.\n\nThe code includes our expectation library and mock implementations of \nthings like io, servlets, and jdbc. There&#39;s also a jar that provides \nsome fill-in classes so it can run in Java 1.1.x. Given it&#39;s raw \nstate, please be gentle with us ;-) \n\nInterestingly, one of the morals of this exercise is the importance \nof the IDE. Creating mock objects from an interface is actually quite \neasy if you&#39;ve got a tool, such as VisualAge or NetBeans, that will \nwrite the skeleton.\n\nSteve\n\n--- In junit@y..., &quot;Dinwiddie, George&quot; &lt;George.Dinwiddie@a...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Speaking of mock objects, I needed to test some objects that \ninitialized\n&gt; themselves from a JDBC ResultSet.  Rather than generate a test \ntable and\n&gt; stuff data into it, I decided to create a MockResultSet.  Well, \nResultSet is\n&gt; an interface with a LOT of methods.  What a boring chore this \nturned out to\n&gt; be.  In the end, I created an AbstractMockResultSet class that \nthrows an\n&gt; SQLException for every method.  If anyone needs such a thing, let \nme know\n&gt; and it could save you a lot of typing.\n\n\n\n",
