Which one failed?\n&gt; \n&gt; The one that fails with &quot;expected 10 but was 20&quot;?\n\n....if you use assertEquals(). If the test tells me what I was testing, \nthen I oughtn&#39;t to need to use assertion failure messages to tell me \nwhich assertion failed. I want to know which /test/ failed. Without a \ntest name, that is not easy.\n\n&gt;  &gt; By making the test name different from the test method name, I can use\n&gt;  &gt; the test name to report specifically which line of data led to a\n&gt;  &gt; failing\n&gt;  &gt; test.\n&gt; \n&gt; Understood.\n&gt; \n&gt; I agree that this solution works well when you want to externalize the\n&gt; data for a data-driven solution.  I guess externalizing data is my last\n&gt; resort.  I start with individual test case methods with common code\n&gt; refactored into a custom assertion.  I start there partly because it&#39;s\n&gt; easier for me to see the data and the assertion side by side in a test\n&gt; method.  And I name the test methods according to why the specific\n&gt; piece of data is important to test.  So if a test fails, I know by\n&gt; looking at the method name what went wrong.\n\nI am writing a webapp using Velocity to render DynaBeans. I want to \nverify that all my DynaBean properties are represented somewhere on the \nresulting web page without worrying about where the data comes from. I \nwrite a JUnit test to render the template with a hardcoded DynaBean. \nThere are 58 properties. I prefer not to write 58*2=116 test methods \nwhen I can write 2 (is it there? is the value right?) and generate the \n58 lines of data. (for each DynaProperty in myDynaBean...)\n\nNow maybe using JUnit to test a Velocity template is not the best \napproach, but I don&#39;t know a better one for testing a Velocity template \nin isolation. :)\n\n&gt; Rarely do I find that I have enough permutations of data to justify\n&gt; externalizing the data.  But when that does happen, I externalize it. \n&gt; Even in that case I don&#39;t use a parameterized test case.\n\nDo you then execute all permutations as one big test?\n\n&gt; I&#39;ve seen the parameterized test case used.  I&#39;ve never had occasion to\n&gt; use it myself.  Perhaps it&#39;s my testing style.  I&#39;m using this as an\n&gt; opportunity to question why I don&#39;t use parameterized test case, not as\n&gt; an opportunity to caution you not to use it.\n\nNo problem. It could be a style thing. I seem to care much more about \nexecuting each test on its own than others on this list, so maybe that&#39;s \nthe difference.\n-- \nJ. B.
