Sorry if this is stupid question.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; I need to write a test case that tests a class whose behavior depends on<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; a System property. The class reads the System property at class <br/>\n&gt; &gt; initialization<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; time. I&#39;d like to have multiple test cases, each of which sets a <br/>\n&gt; &gt; different<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; value for the System property, so each of the tests needs to be run in a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; separate JVM or possibly a separate ClassLoader.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; Is there a simple way to (e.g.) annotate my test case to cause JUnit to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; handle this for me?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; I&#39;m invoking JUnit as part of a maven build.
