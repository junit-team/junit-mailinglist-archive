Print out your Junit reports into\nand XML format (&lt;format /&gt;) and then use a standalone Java program or\nany other tool to transform the XML into excel sheets. I know that it\nis not too tough to make comma seperated .csv files from XML/XSL. I am\nnot too sure what will it take to create the binary .xls files.\n\nas far as &quot;velocity&quot; factor you mentioned, take a look at section\n4.3.2 of the book JUnit in Action. That refers to a tool called Clover\n- never used it  - but sounds like what you are looking for.\n\nhope this helps.\n\n\nOn Wed, 12 Jan 2005 15:16:09 +0000, didoss@...\n&lt;didoss@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Paul -\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks for the reply.  Unfortunately, we are already doing that.\n&gt; \n&gt; We run a nightlybuild with tests.  It copies the previous results to a\n&gt; backup-reports directory, cleans the reports directory, and then creates the\n&gt; current results html files.  Then, we send out an e-mail to the team, with\n&gt; the links to the various reports (for different &#39;chunks&#39; of code), both\n&gt; current and previous.\n&gt; \n&gt; Every morning, I am opening those reports and copying the highest level data\n&gt; (from the summary section -&gt; #tests, #failures, #errors) into an excel\n&gt; spreadsheet.\n&gt; \n&gt; Currently, we are trying to get our testing back under control - many\n&gt; iterations of allowing people to say their stories were complete without\n&gt; appropriate - or even working - tests.  Additionally, in the past, we have\n&gt; found that we have a velocity treshhold - after which our testing goes\n&gt; downhill.  So, we have a need to maintain this historical information, over\n&gt; the life of the project.\n&gt; \n&gt; I am looking for a way to automate this.  What I&#39;m thinking of is:\n&gt; when the reporting functionality totals the summary numbers, it could also\n&gt; output to another file type (ideally, straight into an excel spreadsheet;\n&gt; minimally, into a file that can be used as a data source for a spreadsheet)\n&gt; a configurable data set: date, time, #tests, #failures, #errors, #time.\n&gt; \n&gt; Dianne\n&gt; \n&gt; -------------- Original message -------------- \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Dianne Doss asked\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Is there an automated way to output the summary data (#tests,\n&gt; #errors, #failures) from my JUnit Report to an external file\n&gt; (possibly xls, or a file accessible by spreadsheet) in order to\n&gt; maintain a history of our results?\n&gt; \n&gt; In the ideal world, there would never be any errors or failures, but\n&gt; the point of the testing is to make us confident in making code\n&gt; changes.  We run a nightlybuild regression, so the next morning I\n&gt; can see if I missed anything (sometimes the failures are well\n&gt; removed from the actual class that was changed).\n&gt; \n&gt; So, we would like to be able to record historical data of the\n&gt; fluctuations.  In the past, manually, we have found that the\n&gt; errors/failures go up when we get above a certain velocity.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks for any insight that can be provided.\n&gt; \n&gt; Dianne Doss\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Dear Doss,\n&gt; \n&gt;               If you are generating JUnit Report through Ant, definitely you\n&gt; should write one build.xml file. Before generating new report, why not you\n&gt; take copy of the previous report.  In Ant API  contains copy tag and move\n&gt; tag. So\n&gt; first step you take a back up using Copy/ Move tag.\n&gt; Second step you clear your old report using delete tag.\n&gt; Third step create report folder again.\n&gt; Finally you generate new report.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Paul Domnic J.\n&gt; \n&gt; Scandent Group\n&gt; 4th Floor, KRM Centre,\n&gt; No.2, Harrington Road,\n&gt; Chetpet,\n&gt; Chennai 600 031\n&gt; India\n&gt; \n&gt; Tel:+91 44  5211 8090\n&gt; Fax:+91 44  5211 8068\n&gt; Important Email Information :- The  information  in  this  email is\n&gt; confidential and may  be  legally  privileged.
