Only counterpoint I see is that when you crash the<br/>\nentire JVM (thus app server) the bug will be fixed with much higher priority<br/>\nbecause you&#39;ll have management over you. Not sur it&#39;s a win ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nNeither of you ever experiences a server halt that could have been avoided<br/>\nby simply catching some throwables?. I did. Wrongly installed library on one<br/>\non the app servers in a cluster. Only that little rarely used feature didn&#39;t<br/>\nwork. We got an alert, fixed it, and here we go. You think it&#39;s preferable<br/>\nto get the entire JVM to exit? No talking about a JVM serving one client<br/>\nhere. A lot of clients on the same machine. It would be like you have a CGI<br/>\nthat crashes leading to a stop of the entire apache server.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m surprised I&#39;m the only one doing that sort of stuff. Anybody doing web<br/>\ndeveloppement and not feeling the need for this (Catching a wide range of<br/>\nexceptions) ?<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes you just want to do<br/>\n<br/>\ntry {<br/>\n  this();<br/>\n}catch (AnythingThatCouldGoWrongReallyAnything t) {<br/>\n    logIt(t);<br/>\n    //go on with your life, since this() was just a best-effort feature, no<br/>\ngarantee, not important, does not justify aborting the transaction.<br/>\n}<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nmathieu<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Robert Wenner<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a> ; Mathieu Gervais<br/>\nSent: Friday, May 24, 2002 2:43 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [junit] catching Throwables (Was: Should JUnit determine if<br/>\nassert*/fail is called in testFoo?)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSounds a little like catch-all-life-insurance to allow you to be lazy<br/>\nin design or implementation?<br/>\n<br/>\nBe careful, you can not catch everything like this, for examlple a<br/>\nstack overflow due to infinite recursion just crashed the JVM process<br/>\non my machine yesterday.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobert<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!
