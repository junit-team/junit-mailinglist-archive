I bought the PDF form and print<br/>\nchapters to read on the train (a lot lighter to carry<br/>\nthan a full book).  But I love the ease of use of the<br/>\nPDF to go back an find things!  <br/>\n<br/>\nPlus for me the price was great as shipping to NZ was<br/>\nfree ;-)  With my last book purchase from Amazon the<br/>\nshipping cost was over half the cost of the book!  The<br/>\nprice to pay for living in the best part of the world<br/>\nI s&#39;pose :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Michael &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mkoss917@...\">mkoss917@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I ordered it from Amazon on June 16 and I am still<br/>\n&gt; waiting for my copy<br/>\n&gt; to ship.
