[mailto:Jeff.Langr@...]\n&gt; \n&gt; Fro=\r\nm: Jim Dixon &lt;jdd@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; However, you should NEVER put an assertio=\r\nn in setUp().  \n\nI disagree on the grounds that the assert*() methods are j=\r\nust executed as regular methods.  By which I mean they have no part in the =\r\nJUnit TestCase life cycle or contractual relationship with the test runner.=\r\n  They don&#39;t fire events and they don&#39;t get invoked via reflection like tes=\r\nt*() methods do.  They&#39;re just methods for asserting boolean conditions.  A=\r\ns such, I think they can be useful in setUp() or tearDown() as long as they=\r\n&#39;re used in the general assertion capability way that Jeff seems to be usin=\r\ng them.\n\nI guess it would follow from my argument that if one is using JDK =\r\n1.4 APIs, one could just as well use the assert keyword where he&#39;s using JU=\r\nnit assert() methods in setUp() and tearDown().  Eh?  Never thought of that=\r\n before.\n\nBest,\nScott Stirling\nWorkscape, Inc.\n\n***************************=\r\n********************************************\nThis message is intended only =\r\nfor the use of the intended recipient and\nmay contain information that is P=\r\nRIVILEGED and/or CONFIDENTIAL.
