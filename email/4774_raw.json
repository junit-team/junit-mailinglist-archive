These tests lean more towards being functional tests and \nrely on multiple failures being handled correctly. There have been \nseveral opinions on this list in support of multiple failures for \nfunctional tests. \n\nWhat I would like to know is the reason TestCase inherits from Assert \nrather than delegates to it. If it delegated, we could subclass \nTestCase to handle multiple failures and still use Assert for DbC.\n\nRegards,\n\nDavid\n\n--- In junit@y..., &quot;kentlbeck&quot; &lt;kentbeck@c...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; When I&#39;ve wished for multiple failures to be recorded in my tests, \nmy \n&gt; tests were always too big. Splitting up the tests gave me more \n&gt; satisfactory tests, and pinpointed errors.\n&gt; \n&gt; If you want multiple failures, it sounds like you want a different \n&gt; mechanism than fail().\n&gt; \n&gt; The advantage of having the methods be static is that you can do \nDbC \n&gt; and have pre-/post-condition failures reported like all other JUnit \n&gt; failures.\n&gt; \n&gt; Kent\n\n\n",
