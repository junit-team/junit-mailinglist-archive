EVERYONE PAY ATTENTION.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Can anyone recommend a package out there THAT WILL EXTEND JUNIT...&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Beautiful. JUnit doesn&#39;t have to do everything, folks.\n\nThanks for being kind!  \n\nBTW thanks to the many replies, I found the extension and everything \nseems to work fine.  Now I can simulate lots of users hammering on \ntransactions at the same time.   Except that now Clearcase seems to \nhave chewed the source up and swallowed it (good thing I make backups \non a floppy!)\n\nCheers\nRob\nLowly Consultant,\nNYC\n\n\n\n",
