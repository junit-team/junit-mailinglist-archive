But in a different case, \nwhen SOAP message sent over JMS is used in the XML, the server side \nTIBCO BusinessWorks process does not accept XML input. Error msg\nsays: there was error deserialising/processing SOAP message. What \ncould be the reason? This SOAP over JMS message was taken off from\nthe queue using queuebrowser and pasted in TextPad text editor and \nsaved as XML file. I suspect, in this procedue, something is causing \nproblem, and this SOAP/XML is rejected by the TIBCO process.\n\nI have spent over a week breaking my head over it. Any help will be \ngreatly appreciated.\nPLEASE HELP.\n\nVictor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
