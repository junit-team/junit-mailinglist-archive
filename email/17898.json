Or what do you mean with reports for aggregate <br/>\ninformation? Are that reports different from the logging I generate <br/>\nwith eg log4j?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, didoss@... wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; That sounds like two different things:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The logging, whether through log4j (which I also like) or something <br/>\nelse, will provide debugging information to you.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The reports are useful for aggregate information (like how many <br/>\nfailures and errors for X number of tests for the whole product <br/>\nsuite, or whatever scope you run) and information about tests passed <br/>\nand failed (errors and failures).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; For the tests that failed, you might use the information from the <br/>\nreport (which will give you information around the issue - stack <br/>\ntrace or failure information) or information from the log files <br/>\n(information for the entire run - you might be able to see the <br/>\nprogression of state that led to the failure/error) to troubleshoot <br/>\nand fix.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I generally take the reports, or the result of an individual run, <br/>\nas my starting point, and then only look at the logging for the ones <br/>\nthat failed in some way.  If I have written my asserts well, I <br/>\nusually don&#39;t even need to look at the logging, because I will know <br/>\nexactly what went wrong.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hope this helps and good luck on the migration.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Dianne<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -------------- Original message -------------- <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;isowitz&quot; &lt;isowitz@...&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have to rewrite existing tests in JUnit tests. The old tests logs <br/>\n&gt; with a java.util.logging.Logger, e.g. starttime, start sendind <br/>\ndata, <br/>\n&gt; start recieving data, the recieved data etc. - in a word they logs <br/>\n&gt; all that can be logged. <br/>\n&gt; Should I use the java.util.logging.Logger for JUnit too or is that <br/>\n&gt; the bad way?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You spoke about reports of my result. What other kind of reports <br/>\n&gt; exists?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, didoss@ wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; What do you mean by logging,...do you mean reports of your <br/>\nresults -<br/>\n&gt; then Google JUnitReport.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; -------------- Original message -------------- <br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;isowitz&quot; &lt;isowitz@&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I have a problem with logging JUnit tests. In a package I have a <br/>\n&gt; &gt; AllTests class that calls several tests. The result of that tests <br/>\n&gt; &gt; should be logged.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m not familiar with JUnit or logging so I try to find examples <br/>\nin <br/>\n&gt; the <br/>\n&gt; &gt; web. Unfortunately i found no examples or hints for me.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; How do you log your JUnit results? <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
