Don&#39;t know what does that have to do <br/>\n&gt; with an<br/>\n&gt; &gt; empty strategy, or what is an empty strategy though. But I&#39;m sure we <br/>\n&gt; will<br/>\n&gt; &gt; soon know :).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If that&#39;s what an Adapter is, then what is a Bridge? I don&#39;t have my<br/>\n&gt; copy of Design Patterns handy right now. What you describe is what I<br/>\n&gt; would call a Bridge.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think so.  Unfortunately, whoever borrowed my Design Patterns <br/>\nsometime last fall has yet to return it, and the person I usually borrow <br/>\nit from is not around, so I&#39;m thrown on the mercy of Google, which seems <br/>\nto confirm that teemu is right:<br/>\n<br/>\nAdapter: convert the interface of one component to match the interface <br/>\nof another<br/>\nBridge: separate an abstraction from its implementation, so they can <br/>\nevolve independently.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that the Request / Runner separation in JUnit 4 is an example of <br/>\nBridge: the Request hierarchy for requesting that classes ATest, BTest, <br/>\nand CTest be run is separate from the Runner hierarchy for enumerating <br/>\nand running tests.  (But I might be wrong--there are qualified members <br/>\nof the JUnit development team who have corrected my overapplications of <br/>\npatterns terminology in the past.)<br/>\n<br/>\n    David Saff</div>",
