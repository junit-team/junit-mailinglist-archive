I develop=\r\n primarily on a\nMac.  For the most part JUnit works great on the Mac but I =\r\nhave an\nissue that I need to solve before I can move ahead.  This issue is =\r\nthe\nissue of classpath.  Exactly what elements of a JUnit test need on the\n=\r\nclasspath?  I know that the junit.jar file must be visible to the\njavac pro=\r\ngram.  On my Mac I have placed the junit.jar file in my\n/Libray/Java/Extens=\r\nions folder.  That seems to work with the swingui\nmodule very well but when=\r\n I try to run a test in textui  get an error\nmessage back saying that myFil=\r\neTest can&#39;t be found.  Does the test I\nam running need to be on my classpat=\r\nh as well?  I am executing tests\nfrom the command line while I am in in the=\r\n current directory where the\ntest and files to be tested live. swingui work=\r\ns well.  textui gives me\nerrors.  Why, if swingui works well, textui fails?=\r\n  They seem to be\ncoming from the same folder and .jar file.  \n\nI am also t=\r\nrying to install JUnit on a PC and I am having similar\nproblems.\n\nAnybody g=\r\not any ideas?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYahoo!
