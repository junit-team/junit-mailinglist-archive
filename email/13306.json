It&#39;s healthy to ask the<br/>\n&gt; original poster if this design is really necessary, but if<br/>\n&gt; they say &quot;yes&quot;, then we should just move on to solving their<br/>\n&gt; problem and not patronize them on how pure their architecture is.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You are probably more referring to my posts than to J.B.&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the OP said something along the lines of &quot;I know the design is<br/>\nsuboptimal, but I currently can&#39;t do something about it&quot;, I would have<br/>\naccepted that and concentrated on solving his testing problem using Junit.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I didn&#39;t understand him to say that. Instead I understood him to say<br/>\nsomething more along the lines of &quot;my design is quite good the way it is,<br/>\nand it is strange that Junit doesn&#39;t support testing it very well.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom the little I know about his design, I still doubt that the design is as<br/>\ngood as it could be, and I thought it might be of value to point that out,<br/>\nand perhaps even get an interesting discussion going on that issue. If I<br/>\nsounded patronizing that way, I appologize - that wasn&#39;t my intent.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; In real life, faulty or imperfect designs are the norm.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sure. That&#39;s one reason unit testing is so valuable: it makes some of the<br/>\nimperfectionism more visible, so that we can work on it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If a framework forces you to change your design to be useful,<br/>\n&gt; you can bet that most companies will keep their design and<br/>\n&gt; choose another framework.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And some developers would rather choose a framework that is lightweight than<br/>\none that better supports scenarios they don&#39;t strive for anyway. It&#39;s nice<br/>\nthat we have a choice, isn&#39;t it?<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care, Ilja</div>",
