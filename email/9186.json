I&#39;ve seen this too.  I call them &quot;riveters&quot; since I&#39;ve been reading a book on the design and construction of the Empire State Building and the analogy seems apt.  The riveters don&#39;t design or do anything sophisticated -- they just rivet together the beams that you tell them to.<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; In my current project, we don&#39;t even have any dedicated QA people; the<br/>\n&gt; programmers themselves are responsible for doing all of the <br/>\n&gt; QA. We ended up with a very heavily automated solution, one we never <br/>\n&gt; could have had without QA staff who were programmers to the point that <br/>\n&gt; they could change our software internals to make it more testable.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sounds cool.<br/>\n<br/>\nScott Stirling<br/>\nFramingham, MA</div>",
