That doesn&#39;t make them all false,\n&gt; nor mine meaningless, just not certain. Mine might&#39;ve been\n&gt; right however I started, perhaps plain luck. :-)\n\nTo me a conclusion which might be right out of plain luck *is*\nirrelevant.\n\n&gt; I write code, I test my code, I debug my code when tests fail\n&gt; by trying to analyse the output. I was hoping for it to be\n&gt; easier to analyse, w/o a lot of manual effort, but I don&#39;t\n&gt; have an itch big enough to attempt to write such a tool --\n&gt; especially when it&#39;d be cheap/clean to do it in the\n&gt; framework.\n\nSo you are actually concerned about who will be writing the code to make\nit work?\n\n&gt; Also, much as I could craft some sort of add on\n&gt; (perhaps leverage my own sub-class from TestCase) I think it\n&gt; needs too much of what is in the framework in order to work\n&gt; well, and I don&#39;t fancy re-writing the thing.\n\nI don&#39;t think you&#39;d need to rewrite anything.\n\n&gt; I use eclipse, I use ant -- I like the integration into those\n&gt; tools more than I like my idea. If I can&#39;t get you to\n&gt; contemplate the concept, then I probably have little chance\n&gt; of persuading them. If they don&#39;t use it, I won&#39;t benefit. Another\n&gt; reason not to start. \n\nYou wouldn&#39;t need to persuade anyone. Both Eclipse and Ant are open\nsource and have a quite mature plugin concept.\n\n&gt; This was my first topic on this mailing list, and much as you\n&gt; were pretty measured/polite (at least at the start) I don&#39;t\n&gt; think I&#39;ll be back for more. Open Source is (IMHO) about open\n&gt; minded discussion of ideas, and I don&#39;t think I found that\n&gt; here. No worries, have fun w/ what you do.\n\nIt is also about contribution. I think we would all be pleased to see\nyou write your tool and happy to help you where we can. If it proves to\nbe valuable to many people, the best way to distribute it could be\nreconsidered.\n\nNo hard feelings,\n\nIlja\n\n\n",
