In this case, TestNG guarantees that\n&gt; \n&gt; - All methods in group A will be run before any\n&gt; method in group B is\n&gt; invoked.\n&gt; - All methods in group A will have succeeded.  If at\n&gt; least one of them\n&gt; failed, then all test methods in group B will be\n&gt; marked as &quot;SKIPPED&quot; (not\n&gt; run), which makes it much easier for you to figure\n&gt; out which test exactly\n&gt; broke the chain (&quot;cascade effect&quot;).\n\nI meant something else. Its in J.B. Rainsberger&#39;s book\non page 185: Ignore a test.\n\nOr on this page:\nhttp://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=4603\n\nIgnored tests are always skipped, but not because\nanother test failed but because the programmer set the\ntest to be ignored, which is a kind of &quot;sleep&quot; mode.\n\nNow to your test dependancies. I&#39;ll tell you how our\ntests are grouped in the suites.\n\nThere is a JUnit test suite for every Eclipse project.\nThen we have a suite for each component in the\nprojects. The components can have these groups of\ntests: persistance tests (whether entites are\npersisted and retrieved correctly according to meta\ndata, including validation rule testing for these\nentities and entity factories), batch program tests\n(which either can be legacy data migration batch tests\nor fast lane reader batch tests), business logic tests\n(like ABC analysis, sales forecast, purchase proposals\nand so on), tests for utility classes and some other\ngroups of tests (but we have no automated GUI tests).\n\nIf persistance tests fail, then it would be no use to\nrun all other tests. If tests for utility classes\nfail, then in many cases it is no use to run all other\ntests. If batch tests fail, it doesn&#39;t mean that\nbusiness logic tests will fail and vice versa. This is\na corse grained dependency of our tests. The fine\ngrained test dependencies are much more of course.\n\nIn our team we all know that if persistance tests\nfail, we don&#39;t have to care about the business logic\ntest results.\n\nWe really have a large project. If the tests reflect\nthe code structure too close, then refactoring becomes\nvery time consuming because it affects tests very\nmuch. Thats for example why it is recommended to only\ntest public methods. My theoretical objection to\nmaintain dependency information in the tests is that\nit is additional work to do and to maintain. If the\ndependency changes for the worse, the test dependency\ninformation (annotation) need to be changed. Besides\nthis, if test group B is no longer dependent of test\ngroup A, then the tests pass although there is no\ndependency anymore. It is pure luck for a programmer\nto detect that test B is no longer dependent of test\nA. Only if a new dependency is created, the tests will\nfail. But if a dependency vanishes, the tests will not\nfail and will contain misleading dependency\nannotations. Isolated tests are more stable to change\nthan dependent tests I think.\n\nDon&#39;t get me wrong. I argued here against JUnit in\nfavor of Design by Contract a few years ago. Now I\nlike JUnit, which can apply to TestNG too, or not, who knows.\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nYahoo! Mail Mobile \nTake Yahoo! Mail with you!
