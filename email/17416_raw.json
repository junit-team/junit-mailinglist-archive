Can JUnit run test methods in a particular order?\n\nNo. JUnit makes no promises whatsoever regarding the order in which\ntest methods are executed. This is by design--JUnit supports the\nprinciple of test independence.\n\n\nOn 8/14/06, huaishih_wen &lt;hwen@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;  2. What is the best approach to unit test database code?\n&gt;  3. What is the best approach to unit test threaded program?\n\nThere&#39;s no right answer to these questions. It would help, though, if\nwe could look at a concrete example.\n\nHaving said that, the short answer to 2) is that you might want to\nlook into mock objects and consider running tests for database code\nagainst a lightweight, embedded database such as HSQLDB. The short\nanswer to 3) is, &quot;separate the threading logic from what code the\nthreads are executing, test the sequential code as usual, and learn\nthe Java Thread API inside out to figure out how to test the threading\nlogic enough to gain a degree of confidence.&quot;\n\nI happen to be in the process of writing longer &quot;answers&quot; to these\nquestions into what will become a book on test-driven development but\nI&#39;m afraid it&#39;ll still take a few months before it&#39;s going to be\navailable.\n\n-Lasse-\n\n",
