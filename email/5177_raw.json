For example:\n&gt; &gt; - contents, labels\n&gt; &gt; - enabled/disabled\n&gt; &gt; - shown/hidden\n&gt; &gt; - color, font\n&gt; &gt; - etc.\n&gt;\n&gt; Yes.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; In order to change the state of those components there must be a\n&gt; &gt; conversation from the model, or mediator in your example, to\n&gt; those widgets.\n&gt;\n&gt; Yes.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; This conversation is typically implemented in &gt; 0 lines of\n&gt; nontrivial code.\n&gt; &gt; This code is prone to breakage.\n&gt;\n&gt; In general, I don&#39;t agree. If you are doing anything more than\n&gt; making swing\n&gt; calls, that code should be elsewhere. When the code is not\n&gt; trivial, which I\n&gt; claim is rare (and I do this for a living), then test the gui. I&#39;m not\n&gt; saying don&#39;t test it - I&#39;m saying question if the test is needed. If it&#39;s\n&gt; needed, do it. If you can move the logic elsewhere, then just\n&gt; look at it to\n&gt; see if it works.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; On top of that you also have the conversation from the widgets to the\n&gt; &gt; model/mediator. This also is prone to breakage, typically through\n&gt; &gt; inappropriate use of listener callback arguments, or just\n&gt; simply forgetting\n&gt; &gt; to set up a callback.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Which would be highly visible and immediately obvious that it wasn&#39;t\n&gt; working.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; So you see, the statement that it &quot;can&#39;t break&quot; is just a bit overly\n&gt; &gt; optimistic.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Perhaps, but not to the extent that you&#39;re implying.\n\nGiven:\n1) You acknowledge that for some cases there is a greater than zero\nlikelehood that the connection to a GUI can be coded incorrectly\n2) You work for ObjectMentor, which promotes XP practices\n3) XP mandates that we test anything that can break\n\nI conclude that you agree that testing at the GUI layer for some cases is a\ngood thing.\n\nPerhaps the next task is to identify which GUI implementation patterns are\nmore prone to breakage and suggest the need for GUI-driven test cases.\n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nMike Silverstein\nSilverMark, Inc.\nThe object testing company\nhttp://www.javatesting.com\n\n\n",
