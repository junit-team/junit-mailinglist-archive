The nice thing about it is that even\nnon-technical people can grasp the concepts (thus the manager&#39;s guide\nsubtitle).  There is not a single line of code in this book which is great\nbecause it side-steps the chicken and the egg problem: coding books expect\nyou to know OO and OO books expect that you know how to code.\n\n-Phil\n\n\n\n                                                                                        \n                    &quot;Michael Hale&quot;                                                      \n                    &lt;mhale@rolemode        To:     &lt;junit@yahoogroups.com&gt;              \n                    lsoft.com&gt;             cc:                                          \n                                           Subject:     RE: [junit] OT: OO Newcomer     \n                    12/14/2002                                                          \n                    05:24 PM                                                            \n                    Please respond                                                      \n                    to junit                                                            \n                                                                                        \n                                                                                        \n\n\n\n\nObject Technology: A Manager&#39;s Guide, by David Taylor is the best\nintroduction to objects I know of and it is under 200pgs.  Of course as\nsomeone already mentioned the very best way to learn how to program (not\njust how to write code in a particular language).  Is to be mentored by\nsomeone who is already an expert.\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: mamago@... [mailto:mamago@...]\nSent: Friday, December 13, 2002 10:53 AM\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: [junit] OT: OO Newcomer\n\n\nOFF TOPIC\nDisclaimer:  see below\n\nBringing a newbie into OO\n=========================\n\nI would like to ask the people on this list for recommendations of the\nbest literature to bring an OO newbie up to speed.\n\nThe programming language in question is Java, which means that there is\na splendid wealth of online material for someone to learn the language.\nThe important thing, however, is to instill the notion of OO purity,\nwhich is harder, perhaps, than just teaching the language.\n\nFor example: the GoF patterns book is a must, but I think it is not a\ntext that you can give to someone until they have a grounding in OO\ntechniques.\n\nYour thoughts?\n\nManuel Amago.\n\n-----------------------------------------------\nDISCLAIMER\nI know this group is not for this type of question, which is why I\nexplicitly labelled this thread as OT (Off Topic).  I hope you will\nforgive my impertinence.  ;) But, I greatly value the opinions of the\npeople on this list, and I trust your opinion on this particular issue.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nmail2web - Check your email from the web at http://mail2web.com/ .\n\n\n\n\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\njunit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n\n\nYour use of Yahoo!
