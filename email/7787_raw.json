Some classes in our code might have \norder dependent methods by mistake. Those methods might behave \ncorrectly in a normal order, but in other conditions bug will \nsurface. \n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, Tung Wai Yip &lt;tungwaiyip@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; I wrote a testCreate to create and verify a record.\n&gt; \n&gt; Then testUpdate to update and verify the record created in \ntestCreate.\n&gt; \n&gt; Finally the testDelete to test delete the record created in \ntestCreate.\n&gt; \n&gt; The thress test cases comprise of a suite of test for the \npersistence of one\n&gt; kind of record. This contradicts with the idea that each test case \nshould be\n&gt; independent. On the other hand the test cases are easy to write and \nI&#39;m happy\n&gt; with the result. I wonder if there is any convincing reason to \nwrite a complex\n&gt; test case just so it can be totally independently from the others.\n&gt; \n&gt; Wai Yip Tung\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- javainsel &lt;javainsel@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; We want to test the creation, update and deletion of an object \nwhich \n&gt; &gt; is persisted in database.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; What we now do is to have three test methods for this.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In the testCreate method the object is created, checked that he \nis \n&gt; &gt; really created and then it is deleted (we have delete because \n&gt; &gt; unfortunately we don&#39;t use Mock Objects).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In the testUpdate method we create the object, update it, test \nthe \n&gt; &gt; update result and delete the created object.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In the testDelete method we create the object so that we can test \n&gt; &gt; the deletion of it.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; As you see, everything is included in the testUpdate method. We \n&gt; &gt; duplicate much code in the other two test methods.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; We write such tests for every domain object so I wonder if we \nshould \n&gt; &gt; improve our test class.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Would you write 3 or just 1 test method for that example?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; And would you try to convince senior coworkers who know little \nabout \n&gt; &gt; JUnit and dislike TDD?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; &gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
