You can use Agitator to\nfind subtle bugs. For example, Kevin Lawrence at Agitar used Agitator to\nfind a bug in the JUnit Money example code that had sat there undiscovered\nfor seven years. Another valuable part of Agitar&#39;s toolset is the Management\nDashboard which gives you a view of the quality of your tests (it&#39;s not just\nfor managers). I ran the tests for Spider through the Dashboard and learned\nabout holes in my testing technique--that was the moment that convinced me\nto join Agitar (I work there one day a week).\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nKent Beck\nThree Rivers Institute and Agitar Software\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On \n&gt; Behalf Of davek725\n&gt; Sent: Friday, May 26, 2006 7:50 AM\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: [junit] JUnit vs. Agitator\n&gt; \n&gt; My company is currently doing TDD and using JUnit for our unit \n&gt; testing - both persistence testing and business logic testing.  We \n&gt; are now looking at Agitator and trying to determine if, and how, it \n&gt; fits into our current practices.  I was wondering how others have \n&gt; decided to use Agitator (or not use it).  Some of the issues we are \n&gt; struggling with:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1.  Agitator looks like it can eliminate the need to write most JUnit \n&gt; tests (except true persistence testing).  The downside is that we \n&gt; would be left with only Agitator config files that contain our \n&gt; business logic assertions.  This seems like a big leap to take, given \n&gt; that if Agitar goes away, we have no JUnit.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2.  Agitator mocks and factories look easy to create, but look like \n&gt; they are only useful in the context of Agitator.  I couldn&#39;t use them \n&gt; for other purposes (e.g. Fitnesse, JUnit).\n&gt; \n&gt; 3.  Having my business logic tests in JUnit means they are in an \n&gt; understood format and things such as inputs and expected results are \n&gt; clearly visible and grouped with each test.  My impression of \n&gt; Agitator is that this wouldn&#39;t be as clear.\n\n\n",
