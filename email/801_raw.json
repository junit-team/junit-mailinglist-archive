Is that what\n&gt; it&#39;s doing?  If I had the source I&#39;d grep through it to see.\n&gt;  \n&gt; As Fergus noted, if you don&#39;t use JUnit&#39;s custom class loader, you have to\n&gt; restart the test application after each recompile.  This causes a\n&gt; significant slowdown in the edit-compile-test cycle.  Since the vast\n&gt; majority of applications don&#39;t have to play explicit games with the class\n&gt; loader, using the custom class loader for testing is a reasonable default.\n&gt; The default used to be to use the system class loader, but that was\n&gt; changed in version 3.3 and noted in the README file.  You&#39;re probably\n&gt; right that it should be noted in the FAQ, since it does seem to come up\n&gt; frequently.  Actually, looking at the FAQ, I notice the\n&gt; junit.util.excluded.properties noted there.  Perhaps this is another\n&gt; solution to the problem; you could run a test or check the source code.\n&gt;  \n&gt; My points are that Erich and Kent have done us all a big favor by\n&gt; releasing this code.  This code is still evolving; it&#39;s not surprising\n&gt; that the user documentation lags behind the capabilities, especially since\n&gt; the authors derive no remuneration for it.  However, the question about\n&gt; class loading problems has been answered as often as it&#39;s been asked, and\n&gt; the answers can be easily found both on sourceforge (\n&gt; &lt;http://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=97007&gt;) and here (I\n&gt; searched the archives for &quot;loader constraints&quot;).  Searching the\n&gt; yahoogroups archive, I found the message\n&gt; &lt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/junit/message/419&gt; that verifies the\n&gt; excluded.properties solution works.\n&gt;  \n&gt; So, it seems to me that you&#39;re whinging about losing time for which your\n&gt; client is paying, and instead of thinking you should have determined the\n&gt; problem quicker or thinking that solving such problems is part of\n&gt; &quot;delivering bullet-proof software,&quot; you&#39;re thinking that the authors of a\n&gt; free test package (that saves you time) have failed you.  I&#39;m sorry to\n&gt; have to put it so bluntly, but you didn&#39;t get the hint in my previous\n&gt; message.  (BTW, if you check the JUnit zip file, you&#39;ll find test cases\n&gt; that indicate the authors DID test the program.)  As I see it, you&#39;re\n&gt; still looking a gift horse in the mouth and you still haven&#39;t answered the\n&gt; question, &quot;how would you have done it better?&quot;\n&gt;  \n&gt;  - George\n&gt; \n&gt; \t-----Original Message-----\n&gt; \tFrom: Herrick, Chuck [mailto:chuck.herrick@...]\n&gt; \tSent: Tuesday, March 27, 2001 9:44 AM\n&gt; \tTo: &#39;junit@yahoogroups.com&#39;\n&gt; \tSubject: RE: [junit] cannot run testing with UI TestRunner?\n&gt; \t\n&gt; \t\n&gt; \n&gt; \tDid you not see this?

I\n&gt; tripped across the -noloading botch myself, and wasted a good couple of\n&gt; hours trying to diagnose my problems with it.\n&gt; \n&gt; \tThis kind of thing provides great material to use to trip up folks\n&gt; during technical interviews, but is hardly conducive to the deliverance of\n&gt; bullet-proof software when your client is paying you by the hour.\n&gt; \n&gt; \tFinally, I&#39;d point out that someone shows up in this Yahoo.group\n&gt; having tripped over this JUnit classloader with a frequency of about 1 per\n&gt; week.

First of all, I find JUnit\n&gt; to be a wonderful help and I&#39;m very glad to have it.  Second, the JUnit\n&gt; classloader DOES work.  I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on within\n&gt; org.w3c.dom.Document, but in general, when the -noloading switch solves\n&gt; the problem it indicates that some part of the software is using a\n&gt; different class loader and that results in an object mismatch.  The\n&gt; response to this is to disable JUnit&#39;s reloading class loader and use the\n&gt; default one (which will not reload changed classes) that the software\n&gt; under test is expecting.  Is this a bad design decision?  Do you have a\n&gt; better solution to this problem?\n&gt; \n&gt; \t  \n&gt; \t - George \n&gt; \n&gt; \t\t-----Original Message-----\n&gt; \t\tFrom: Herrick, Chuck [ &lt;mailto:chuck.herrick@...&gt;]\n&gt; \t\tSent: Tuesday, March 27, 2001 8:37 AM\n&gt; \t\tTo: &#39;junit@yahoogroups.com&#39;\n&gt; \t\tSubject: RE: [junit] cannot run testing with UI TestRunner?\n&gt; \t\t\n&gt; \t\t\n&gt; \n&gt; \t\tTake a look at the security machinations that Java demands\n&gt; the classloader undergo on behalf of the virtual machine. \n&gt; \n&gt; \t\tI would say that if JUnit can&#39;t complete some very\n&gt; fundamental piece of its business because the authors made bad design\n&gt; decisions regarding the classloader, you&#39;d need to get someone to go back\n&gt; and refactor JUnit.\n&gt; \n&gt; \t\tPerhaps someone should have tested JUnit with some test\n&gt; software before rolling it out. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \tYahoo!
