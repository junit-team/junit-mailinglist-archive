I&#39;ll know for next time.\n\nMy problem is that I am probably trying to use JUnit in a way that it\nwasn&#39;t intended to be used. I am not actually testing that a single\nmethod functions correctly ( i have seperate tests for this that work\nfine), I am testing that a method setAttribute() can set a value of an\nattribute in a database and I then assert that a method getAttribute()\nreturns me the expected value. \n\nI am hoping to test that all the attributes in the database can be set\nand that someone hasn&#39;t unwittingly changed a particular attribute to\nread-only. It would seem to be overkill to have a test method for each\nof the hundreds of attributes. So i currently do the following,\n\n\t- add a failure to a testResult\n\t- fail if the testResult failureCount &gt; 0\n\t- print out all the failures\n\nIf anyone can help me with a better approach I would be grateful.\n\nthanx again\n\n",
