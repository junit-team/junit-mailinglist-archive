We choose\nnot to go with the TIB/Adapter SDK for various\nreasons.\n\nAnyway we&#39;re busy writing a test suite that publishes\nmessages and checks that under certain subjects we get\nspecific messages. Our idea is to automate testing and\ncheck that at certain points in the process flow we\nget specific messages. We don&#39;t beleive in the log\nsolution as doesn&#39;t really check the messages\nthemselves.\n\nInitially we used jUnit and some custom code before we\nstarted writing appenders for jUnit.\n\nRegarding participation to the Raccoon framework we&#39;re\nbusy melting our stuff with the code from Cedric and\nwe&#39;re hoping to get all this stuff working together.\nBasically i&#39;m working on the Raccoon implementation\nover TIB/Rendezvous whilst Cedric works on the Raccoon\nimplementation above the TIB/Adapter SDK.\n\nThe work isn&#39;t been sent back to the Sourceforge site\nbecause TIBCO is hassling us, to put things rather\ncrudely. Raccoon is seen as unfair competition to\ntheir TIB/Adapter SDK. I beleive that opensource of an\nadapter SDK will improve TIB applications more than\nanything else, they don&#39;t.\n\nWe&#39;re working with Cedric on an offline version and\nwe&#39;ll see once that&#39;s working how we can put things on\nthe web site without TIBCO sueing us :o(\nYou&#39;ll notice for example that the javadoc for the\nTIB/Adapter SDK that was written by a couple of\ndeveloppers was removed from the site ...\n\nAs for the bugs, i think you should inform the Raccoon\ndevelopers so that they can improve the code :o)\n\nRegards,\n\nBlue.\n\nps: Blue is my first name, Avenger isn&#39;t though ;o)\nDarkBlueAvenger is my gaming nickname, if you ever\nfeel play Diablo II online ... you can find me on the\neuropean servers, occassionaly on the West Coast\nservers.\n\n--- jlhoward_nz &lt;jlhoward_nz@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Dear dba\n&gt; \n&gt; Greetings oh dark and blue.  The project we are\n&gt; working on involves taking initial code from an\n&gt; external vendor,  writing tests for it and then\n&gt; adding\n&gt; new functions onto it.   We initially investigated\n&gt; Raccoon and Tibco but found that it was a little\n&gt; buggy.   We are very keen to continue on the path of\n&gt; Junit, Tibco etc.  At the moment we have a rather\n&gt; crude automated testing framework that compares log\n&gt; files using other technologies such as ant, text\n&gt; file\n&gt; comparison utility to test IM workflows.  We are\n&gt; currently looking at how to test adapters and make\n&gt; sure they are successful.  Are you contributing the\n&gt; Racoon code back to the site or not.  Let me know\n&gt; and\n&gt; I can send you some more information.  Where are you\n&gt; based?  \n&gt; \n&gt; Regards\n&gt; \n&gt; Jonathan Howard\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- darkblueavenger &lt;darkblueavenger@...&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Hi Howard,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; We&#39;re using jUnit, Raccoon and TIBCO Active\n&gt; &gt; Enterprise currently in \n&gt; &gt; our projet.\n&gt; &gt; We&#39;re busy extending the jUnit extensions found in\n&gt; &gt; Raccoon so as to \n&gt; &gt; test the full TIB/IM workflows in an automated\n&gt; &gt; fashion\n&gt; &gt; Currently we&#39;re delving on having xml config files\n&gt; &gt; to have Raccoon \n&gt; &gt; send and record intermediate steps.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; What are you doing ?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;In junit@y..., &quot;jlhoward_nz&quot; &lt;jlhoward_nz@y...&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Has anybody being using JUNIT to test EAI projects\n&gt; like Tibco or\n&gt; &gt; Vitria or MQ series.  We are currently building a\n&gt; framework around\n&gt; &gt; Tinco using Junit and racoon and would be most\n&gt; interested in swapping\n&gt; &gt; notes and improving the community with some good\n&gt; knowledge.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nFaith Hill - Exclusive Performances, Videos & More\nhttp://faith.yahoo.com\n\n\n",
