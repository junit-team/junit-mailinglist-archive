That&#39;s pretty subjective.\n\nOk.  I  can buy that.  Of course I have worked on small to medium\nprojects that tried to incorporate almost every pattern under the\nsun--many times causing more bulk than necessary.  That is why I\ntermed it &quot;overuse&quot;, although &quot;inappropreate use&quot; applies better.\n\n\n&gt;&gt;The TestCase is taken, and by reflection is turned into a TestSuite.  So\n&gt;&gt;is it a TestCase or a TestSuite?  That is an important distinction.\n&gt;&gt;The Model is not readily apparent.  A stable and predictable model is\n&gt;&gt;essential to good design--esp. in this case.  I have no problem with\n&gt;&gt;saying that a TestCollector dynamically creates a TestSuite from a\n&gt;&gt;collection of TestCases.  That is understandable.  I do have a problem\n&gt;&gt;with the TestCase being treated as a TestSuite though.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; OK, I&#39;ll try to address this one.\n&gt; \n&gt; TestCase is a mechanism to allow fixture reuse.  An instance of a\n&gt; TestCase builds a fixture, runs a single test, and tears down the\n&gt; fixture. By allowing TestCase to contain multiple tests (i.e. public\n&gt; void testXXX() methods) you can share a fixture definition.\n&gt; \n&gt; Put another way, TestCase is NOT a way to conceptually group tests. \n&gt; Each TestCase subclass represents a fixture, and contains a group of\n&gt; tests that run in the context of that fixture. Once you realize this,\n&gt; you&#39;ll find yourself switching (as I did some time ago) from having a\n&gt; TestCase for each class you are testing (with a overly generic fixture\n&gt; of which pieces were used by the different tests) to organizing tests\n&gt; around the fixtures, with less regard for the classes being tested by\n&gt; each TestCase.\n\nI tend to test interfaces.  As such, with the current implementation of\nJUinit, I have one Abstract testcase to excersize the interface&#39;s\ncontracts.  I have concrete classes that extend that abstract test case\nfor the individual classes.  If there are specific issues or features\nof an implementation that need to be tested (i.e. consequences that\nare outside of the scope of the interface like ensuring temporary files\nare in the right place) I add new methods to the concrete test to ensure\nthat things are done properly.\n\nAs to what you are referring to as a Fixture, I am not exactly sure.\n\n\n&gt; TestSuite is a mechanism for grouping a collection of TestCase instances\n&gt; and running them sequentially.  So, TestCase has the ability to create a\n&gt; TestSuite containing all instances of itself (using reflection to create\n&gt; an instance for each constituent test).  Also, you have the ability to\n&gt; create explicit TestSuites by subclassing TestSuite and writing a custom\n&gt; suite() method.  This is useful for collecting together groups of\n&gt; smaller TestSuites which can be other custom TestSuites, or TestSuites\n&gt; generated by TestCases.\n\nThat&#39;s the thing.  The TestSuite, while theorhetically a nice feature,\nadds too much.  You also run the risk/temptation to write tests that\nrequire to be run in a specific order to pass.  If the order is changed,\nor unpredictable, you have to write more robust tests.\n\nNine times out of ten, all you really need is a TestCollector.  The\ncollector finds all your tests, and runs them.\n\n\n&gt; Both TestSuite and TestCase implement the Test interface. The\n&gt; TestRunners work with things that are Tests, hence we can point at any\n&gt; Test (ie TestSuite or TestCase) and recursively run all the contained\n&gt; tests.  The internal nodes are TestSuites and the leaves are TestCases.\n\n\nYes, but what happens if you don&#39;t want to extend either TestCase or\nTestSuite?  What happens if you want to access Assert from TestSuite?\nThe contracts are with the *implementations* of the Test interface,\nand not with the Test interface itself.\n\n&gt; I hope that makes things clearer.\n\nWhat about the other points I had?\n\n\n\n-- \n\n&quot;They that give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety\n  deserve neither liberty nor safety.&quot;\n                 - Benjamin Franklin\n\n\n",
