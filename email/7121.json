I think my process is good because I<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t need to consider whether an interface I&#39;m developing now will<br/>\n </span></blockquote>be<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; workable in the future; I just need to get it to work with what I<br/>\n&gt; need now--a much simpler and faster job--and leave it at that. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think we need to define terms a little.  Interface in this context is<br/>\na little overloaded.  I took it to mean the conceptual boundary between<br/>\nany part of my system that talks to any other part.  And with that<br/>\ndefinition, I&#39;d agree with your statements (I do the same).<br/>\n<br/>\nHmm.  Now I was prepared to say that if you&#39;re talking about an<br/>\nInterface as an API to a set of developers that are outside your group,<br/>\nthen frequent change may be a bad thing.  However, that situation just<br/>\nmakes those one of your customers, I&#39;d say.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich means that the *real* question would be:  How do you prioritize<br/>\nrequests from several different customers.  That&#39;s a more<br/>\nstraightforward question, I think.  Or at least it sounds a lot like<br/>\nsomeone else&#39;s problem.  :P<br/>\n<br/>\n(sorry for all the handwaving there...)<br/>\n<br/>\nKevin<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
