They run in a specific <br/>\nsequence and get their data from the property files. That is fine for <br/>\ncompleted tests.<br/>\nBut we need something like a workflow in the tests; eg. test1 creates <br/>\nsomething in the database and test x uses the same data to verify <br/>\nsome additional testcases.<br/>\nWe started to examine jxunit, unfortunately it is not that well <br/>\ndocumented..<br/>\n<br/>\ncheers<br/>\n<br/>\nerik<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In junit@y..., &quot;Bill Laird&quot; &lt;wlaird@w...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Hi Erik - I&#39;m not quite sure what you are trying to say.
