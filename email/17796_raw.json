The exit\ncondi=\r\ntion of this while is managed by another thread. In a given\nmoment the test=\r\n runs only the thread with the while cycle, so I want\nto test only the code=\r\n behind the first thread. This means that this\ncycle is an infinite one. At=\r\n a moment (let&#39;s say, after 2 or 3 time\nprocessing of the instructions in t=\r\nhe while cycle) the testing\nterminates, without any exception rasing, or er=\r\nror message, the\napplication simply stops. I suppose is something about tim=\r\neout... (??)\n\nIs anybody, who met this problem too? May I ask him to help m=\r\ne?\nThank&#39;s a lot!\n\nMarti\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
