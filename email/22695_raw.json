From the\ndesign perspective, why have a whole Runner just for filtering by\ncategory?  There are other things you can filter on.  And, there were\nsome definitely hackish parts of the implementation.  And, it turns\nout, there were bugs in Categories, (such as\nhttp://github.com/KentBeck/junit/issues#issue/74) that were very hard\nto elegantly fix with the current design.  And, (sorry, maven\nhopefuls), but we were anxious to get back into the meat of the code.\n\nSo, the first 4.9 snapshot is up today, with a new way of specifying\nsuites, called SuiteBuilder.  SuiteBuilder allows for flexible\nspecification of where to find the classes containing tests, and how\nto filter the resulting runners.\n\nThis suite class lists the explicit test classes to consider running,\nand then filters it down to only those tests or classes annotated with\n`@Category(Yes.class)`:\n\n\t@RunWith(SuiteBuilder.class)\n\tpublic static class OnlyYes {\n\t\t@Classes\n\t\tpublic Listed classes= new Listed(Yes1.class, Yes2.class, No1.class);\n\n\t\t@RunnerFilter\n\t\tpublic CategoryFilter filter= CategoryFilter.include(Yes.class);\n\t}\n\t\nWe hope to soon include other implementations for the @Classes\nannotation, including a classpath-searching test gatherer.  Other\nimplementations for @RunnerFilter also make sense (if you look close,\nyou&#39;ll see that RunnerFilter implementations can also re-order\nrunners, as well as selecting them).\n\nPlease have fun, and let us know how it works for you.  Thanks,\n\n   David Saff\n\n",
