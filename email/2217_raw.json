Currently the TreeNode classes do \nnot expose their internals and if I have to navigate the tree from \nthe TestCase and validate values, I&#39;ll need to add these to the \ninterface.\n\nBut, doesn&#39;t this break encapsulation in a way? In this application, \nI do not think any other client classes will be interested in picking \nand choosing nodes and checking its contents. They would only send \nmessages to the TreeHolder and let the TreeHolder delegate it on.\n\nAnother option is of course to make these additional methods package \naccessible ...\n\nThanks very much for your help. \n--Das\n\n--- In junit@y..., Johannes Link &lt;john.link@g...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; If the forwarding is anything but very very simple, I prefer to \ntest it.\n&gt; You can test (a) if the correct set of nodes has been chosen for\n&gt; forwarding (b) if the correct method in the nodes is called. IMO \nthis\n&gt; holds enough potential for (future) failure. \n&gt; To be frank, I personally test even the most trivial delegation \nmethod.\n&gt; With those tests in my back I haven&#39;t got to add many tests during\n&gt; refactoring. Adding lots of tests when refactoring breaks my flow.\n&gt; \n&gt; Johannes\n\n\n",
