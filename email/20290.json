I&#39;ve poked around the net but haven&#39;t gotten much in this<br/>\ncategory...<br/>\n<br/>\nThe root of my question is simple...  Should there be one large &#39;test&#39;<br/>\nfor each method or one small &#39;test&#39; for each method possibility?<br/>\n<br/>\nTo explain what I&#39;m asking I have a short example...  Assume the<br/>\nfollowing method I&#39;d like to test:<br/>\n<br/>\n     int ReportManager.createReport(Report report)<br/>\n<br/>\nIn this particular case, assume I&#39;d like to test the following<br/>\ncircumstances...<br/>\n<br/>\n     * Does it throw an exception if report == null?<br/>\n     * Does it throw an exception if report is empty?<br/>\n     * Does it throw an exception if report is duplicate?<br/>\n     * Does it return a valid ID if successful?<br/>\n<br/>\nSo given this scenario, how would you do it?  Would you go &#39;one big<br/>\ntest&#39;, or &#39;4 small tests&#39;?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t1 Test  =&gt; testCreateReport<br/>\n\t4 Tests =&gt; testCreateReportNull<br/>\n                 testCreateReportEmpty<br/>\n                 testCreateReportDuplicate<br/>\n                 testCreateReportSuccess<br/>\n<br/>\nI could see benefits going either way here.  While 1 test would give you<br/>\na &#39;hey this method is broken&#39;, and your resulting fail would tell you<br/>\nwhy (assuming your comment were appropriate).  On the flip side, having<br/>\n4 tests is just as easy since you&#39;d see that single test fail.<br/>\n<br/>\nComments?  Thanks!<br/>\n<br/>\nJoseph Hobbs<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;When everything is coming your way, you&#39;re in the wrong lane!&quot; - Steven<br/>\nWright<br/>\n<br/>\nThis e-mail transmission contains information that is confidential and may be privileged.
