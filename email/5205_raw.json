B. Rainsberger&quot; &lt;jbr@...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt; &gt; hehehehe....sorry you&#39;re sounding like Ron, not\n&gt; sure I\n&gt; &gt; can help there ;)\n&gt; \n&gt; You could shoot me.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thinking about it more, I guess I&#39;d have to agree\n&gt; with\n&gt; &gt; the thinking that the people working with you\n&gt; *should*\n&gt; &gt; know better and do the right thing.  If they\n&gt; don&#39;t,\n&gt; &gt; you replace them.  Unfortunately, this isn&#39;t\n&gt; always\n&gt; &gt; the case (at least where I&#39;ve been) so I&#39;ve had to\n&gt; &gt; develop some defensive coding technique.\n&gt; \n&gt; Exactly; and so the question has to be asked: why\n&gt; the hell not?! Removing \n&gt; doesn&#39;t necessarily mean firing; it can mean\n&gt; reassigning to another \n&gt; department, changing role, and so on. I firmly\n&gt; believe that any seemingly \n&gt; entirely incompetent person is really just someone\n&gt; in the wrong role. This \n&gt; notion is reinforced at least once per project.\n&gt; \n&gt; I need to find projects with fewer idiots. :)\n\nAGREED! :)\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Also, from your remark about having to change code\n&gt; &gt; because of the checked versus unchecked\n&gt; exceptions, it\n&gt; &gt; sounded like you were merely moaning about some\n&gt; part\n&gt; &gt; of your body hurting.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Doctor, it hurts when I declare which exceptions\n&gt; I&#39;m going to throw...&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Using unchecked exceptions appears to pass the\n&gt; &quot;doctor, it hurts...&quot; test!\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I, for one, don&#39;t mind having\n&gt; &gt; to go through and change a bunch of code because\n&gt; of\n&gt; &gt; some refactoring I&#39;m doing.\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t consider the exception list &quot;code&quot;. Maybe\n&gt; that&#39;s the reason we don&#39;t \n&gt; quite agree on this one. I see it as part of the\n&gt; contract, and I&#39;m not \n&gt; accustomed to explicitly state contracts. To me,\n&gt; that&#39;s what the tests are \n&gt; for. If I were a heavy-duty Design by Contract guy,\n&gt; I might think differently.\n\nAh, that could be.  Not sure what camp I fall in to at\nthe moment...(more reading?  screw that, I&#39;m going to\ngo code some tests..hahah)\n\n&gt; \n&gt; If *all I&#39;m changing* are method signatures, that&#39;s\n&gt; crappy. Period.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Really, on the whole, I would tend to agree with\n&gt; you. \n&gt; &gt; I mainly wanted to get that viewpoint out there to\n&gt; get\n&gt; &gt; the discussion a little broader, just in case\n&gt; anyone\n&gt; &gt; was thinking that the unchecked exceptions were\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; end all, be all of coding (in Java anyway).\n&gt; \n&gt; If they follow the Wiki link, they should get ample\n&gt; helpings of both sides of \n&gt; the issue. :)\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Fear (of my crappy code and/or design) makes me\n&gt; write\n&gt; &gt; tests.\n&gt; \n&gt; Me, too.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Fear (of my coworkers or even sometimes of myself)\n&gt; &gt; makes me tend to use checked versus unchecked\n&gt; &gt; exceptions.\n&gt; \n&gt; Fear of wasting my time makes me tend to use\n&gt; unchecked versus checked \n&gt; exceptions. :)\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Mindkiller?  Sure...but as long as the fear is\n&gt; &gt; controlled, and you use the response productively,\n&gt; it\n&gt; &gt; can be a good thing. ;)\n&gt; \n&gt; Fear is good, but only in moderation.\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; P.S. Ah, something else I just thought of after\n&gt; &gt; re-reading.  We are also using exceptions for flow\n&gt; &gt; control on occasion (for the web-based app we&#39;re\n&gt; &gt; converting from VB).  In those instances, the\n&gt; &gt; exception is thrown and we absolutely must notify\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; user and/or do something about it to recover.\n&gt; \n&gt; I can see where a compile test for that situation\n&gt; would seem better than a \n&gt; runtime test, but I think I prefer the runtime\n&gt; tests, all things being equal.\n&gt; \n&gt; --\n&gt; J.
