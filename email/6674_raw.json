I agree with you, that thinking \n&gt;about a test before implementing the according part of \n&gt;the application is very important. \n&gt;\n&gt;I understand you refuse to write a compilable but hollow \n&gt;method of an application method before you write the test. \n&gt;(This would make the use of a test stub generator impossible.) \n&gt;\n&gt;There I don&#39;t agree. I like the documentation aspect of code \n&gt;related tests. This kind of tests enable me to look at a test \n&gt;in order to understand the intention of an application method. \n&gt;This is very important to me. JUnitDoclet is helping me to \n&gt;keep application structure and test structure in sync, which \n&gt;is essential there. Still I can _implement_ the test method \n&gt;before I _implement_ the application method. \n\nI&#39;m not sure why writing the test before the stub provides more\ndocumentation than writing the stub before the test.\n\nAlso, if you haven&#39;t written the test, then how can you be sure that\nthe stub:\n\n1. ...has the proper signature?\n2. ...is named well?\n3. ...should be class- or instance-level?\n4. ...is written on the appropriate object?\n\nGenerally speaking, you don&#39;t really know these things until you write\ntest code, which is really just sample client code, look at it,\nevaluate it and move on. In general, it is when one sees it &quot;in print&quot;\nthan one really looks at it carefully. Writing the test first\nguarantees this, while writing the stub first does not.\n\nI don&#39;t use JUnitDoclet, so I can&#39;t comment on how using it changes the\nrules of the game. If it&#39;s easy to set up (less than 1 hour), then I\nmay start using it, just for the experience.\n\n&gt;I believe the core idea of &quot;test before code&quot; is \n&gt;possible with _regenerating_ tools like JUnitDoclet. \n&gt;It just requires some self control.\n&gt;\n&gt;After all, this is not a major dissagreement. If there \n&gt;wouldn&#39;t be that documenting aspect of tests...\n\nI would like you to expand on this: what &quot;documenting aspect&quot; do you\nmean? and why does writing the stub first enable this feature and\nwriting the test first not enable this feature?\n\nThanks.\n\n\nJ.
