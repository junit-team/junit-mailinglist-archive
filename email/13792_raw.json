I faced the same problem which you have. you have to design a specification i.e your junit client progam should\nname with e.g ClientTest.java & all the test methods (e.g test_01 or test_dbcheck) \n \nWhen you execute your test cases using ant, the execute command should use the ant build file. from the build file it should use &quot;unit test&quot; if your doing unit testing from there it should identify i.e which Java programs should execute and how the result format will be.\n \nI am doing integration testing so when i execute my junit client using ant. At the time of execution it refers to &quot;integration test&quot; and not the &quot;unit test&quot;.\n \nFor more reference read &quot;Ant tool&quot; and understand about the build XML File. \n \nThanks\nPraveen\n \n \n\n\nShawn Bertrand &lt;Shawn.Bertrand@...&gt; wrote:\nPraveen,\n\nThanks for the reply.\n\nI am aware of the use of TestSuite to limit test cases, but this won&#39;t \nwork when test cases are run under the JUnit task in Ant, which uses its \nown TestSuite to reflectively include all methods for all classes found \nin its file list.  My JUnit task looks like this:\n\n    &lt;junit printsummary=&quot;yes&quot; showoutput=&quot;no&quot; haltonerror=&quot;yes&quot; \nhaltonfailure=&quot;no&quot;\n           fork=&quot;yes&quot; jvm=&quot;${java.home}/bin/java.exe&quot;&gt;\n      &lt;formatter type=&quot;plain&quot; usefile=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;\n      &lt;formatter type=&quot;xml&quot;/&gt;\n      &lt;batchtest todir=&quot;${unit.classes.dir}&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;fileset dir=&quot;${unit.classes.dir}&quot;\n              includes=&quot;\n                  mypackage/myclass.class&quot;\n              excludes=&quot;\n                  *$*.class&quot;/&gt;\n      &lt;/batchtest&gt;\n      &lt;classpath refid=&quot;unit.tests.path&quot;/&gt;\n    &lt;/junit&gt;\n\nWhether the &quot;fileset&quot; task includes a class specifically or via \nwildcard, JUnit will instantiate a TestSuite, reflectively find all \nmethods in a class that begin with &quot;test&quot;, and then attempt to execute \nthem.  In our cases, there are a number of existing methods which begin \nwith &quot;test&quot; but are protected and thus do not get executed.  However, \nthis leads to test method failures.  Now, I could rename these methods \nto avoid the errors, but I am hoping to find a way around it so that \ndevelopers in the future could add methods to future test classes \nwithout having to worry about not naming them test*.\n\nThanks again,\n\nShawn\n\n\nPraveen AH wrote:\n\n&gt; hi shawn,\n&gt;  \n&gt;          You can always limit your test case method using your test suite.\n&gt; See the following example:\n&gt;  \n&gt; TestSuite suite= new TestSuite(MoneyTest.class);\n&gt;  \n&gt; MoneyTest.class if you give in your test suite it will run all your \n&gt; test methods.\n&gt;  \n&gt; if you want to run only few test methods which you think then\n&gt;  \n&gt; TestSuite suite= new TestSuite();\n&gt; suite.addTest(new MoneyTest(&quot;testMoneyEquals&quot;));\n&gt; suite.addTest(new MoneyTest(&quot;testSimpleAdd&quot;));\n&gt; Please let me know if you have any clarifications.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Thanks\n&gt; Praveen\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt; */sbertran &lt;Shawn.Bertrand@...&gt;/* wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;     I need to limit the test cases run from a JUnit task in my ANT script.\n&gt;     In all of my TestCase subclasses, I make sure the constructor\n&gt;     indicates a test method of &quot;testCase&quot;, but that method an other\n&gt;     methods in the subclasses that happen to begin with &quot;test&quot; are also\n&gt;     run. I suspect that TestSuite is used for all of the files identified\n&gt;     in the JUnit task, and TestSuite always finds all methods beginning\n&gt;     with &quot;test&quot;. \n&gt;\n&gt;     Is there any way to limit the test case methods to only &quot;testCase&quot; and\n&gt;     nothing else when running the TestCases under ANT?\n&gt;\n&gt;     Thanks in advance,\n&gt;\n&gt;     Shawn\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;     ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;     *Yahoo!
