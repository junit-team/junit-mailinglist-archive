What if the tested code throw a\n&gt; NullPointerException?\n&gt; You catch it and fail()? \n\nUsually, I&#39;d let that go as an Error. It&#39;s an ambiguous case because\nthe method under test could be throwing that because of bad arguments\nor because of a bug in the method under test.\n\nI go back and forth on the Failure vs. Error thing, but it sure has\nhelped to make the distinction as often as it&#39;s easy. When I see a lot\nof Errors (and few or no Failures), the first thing I look for is build\nor test misconfiguration. If I see many Failures and few (or no)\nErrors, I look for a core or major change to the software. The first\nscernario seems to happen a lot when using JBuilder 4 (which under our\nconfiguration, which clearly must be wrong, seems to not always make\neverything it should even when we do a &quot;rebuild&quot;). The second\noccasionally happens when integrating bug fixes or &quot;minor&quot; upgrades to\nthe core of our product (even after it passed its own unit tests).\n\nRegards,\n\nRob\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nMake international calls for as low as $.04/minute with Yahoo!
