I am in charge of getting a test<br/>\n&gt; framework written for an application with over 200K lines of code that does<br/>\n&gt; not have a single test case yet.  Yikes!  It is very confusing about how to<br/>\n&gt; start and how to set up an application level test suite that will touch all<br/>\n&gt; the classes.  I would be willing to write about my experiences once I<br/>\n&gt; figure it out, but that may be some time.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Can you tell us more about this effort?  Specifically, if you had test cases for all the<br/>\ncode, how would that help?<br/>\n<br/>\nIn general, before touching existing code I&#39;ll write a test to create a safety net.  The<br/>\ntest helps me learn the behaviors of the existing code, and gives me confidence that I<br/>\ncan fiddle with it safely.  The test suite grows over time as more code is touched,<br/>\ndefects are reported, and I learn more about its intended behavior.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounds as if you&#39;re attempting to write tests for all the classes post-development.<br/>\nI haven&#39;t had good experiences with attempting to generate test cases en masse.<br/>\nGenerated test code tends to be too shallow, and I miss the opportunity to learn more<br/>\nabout the code.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nMike Clark<br/>\nClarkware Consulting, Inc.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.clarkware.com\">http://www.clarkware.com</a><br/>\n720.851.2014</div>",
