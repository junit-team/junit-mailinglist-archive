Rainsberger [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jbrains@...\">jbrains@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Guys, when it gets to the point where you&#39;re arguing over<br/>\n&gt; definitions, stop. Definitions are arbitrary. You agree on the<br/>\n&gt; concepts. Relax.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The Java language only exists by virtue of its definition in the official<br/>\nlanguage specification.  Java&#39;s not very arbitrary.  I think it was<br/>\nappropriate to refer (and defer) to the spec.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the inner vs. nested distinction though, I think it&#39;s an unfortunate and<br/>\ntoo subtle choice of words in the spec.  The distinction is exactly the sort<br/>\nof nit-picky thing that the Sun Java Programmer Certification exam looks for<br/>\nunderstanding of.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the original question, I think the major reason for avoiding the nested<br/>\nstatic class on any significant size project is practicality (concrete<br/>\nseparation of concerns), e.g.:<br/>\n<br/>\n- Developers and QA may both be writing unit level tests, depending how the<br/>\nwork effort is partitioned (I&#39;ve worked on some medium sized projects where<br/>\nthis was the case).  In which case, you want the tests and classes under<br/>\ntest maintained in separate files, possibly separate packages (either for<br/>\naccess reasons or management or code ownership reasons), and possibly<br/>\nseparate directories and/or codebases.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Keeping tests in the same file as the class under test makes the file size<br/>\nlarger and more difficult to navigate, edit and maintain.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike Clark, Eric Vought and other had some other very good reasons along<br/>\nsimilar lines.<br/>\n<br/>\nScott Stirling</div>",
