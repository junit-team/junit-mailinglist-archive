This is a simple object-oriented refactoring: separating <br/>\n&gt;responsibilities of an object that does too much.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Another point to consider is that the TestSuite is the smallest execution <br/>\n&gt;unit in JUnit: you cannot execute anything smaller than a TestSuite at one <br/>\n&gt;time without changing source code. In this case, you probably do not want to <br/>\n&gt;put tests in the same TestCase class unless they somehow &quot;belong together&quot;. <br/>\n&gt;If you have two groups of tests that you think you&#39;d like to execute <br/>\n&gt;separately from one another, it is wise to place them in separate TestCase <br/>\n&gt;classes.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;[1] A test fixture is a common set of test data and collaborating objects <br/>\n&gt;shared by many tests. Generally they are implemented as instance variables in <br/>\n&gt;the TestCase class.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Good stuff!<br/>\n<br/>\nMay I add it to the FAQ?<br/>\n<br/>\nMike<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
