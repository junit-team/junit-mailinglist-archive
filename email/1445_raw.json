If you develop under Borlands tool, you get default access to the\ngraphical components on the protected level. As in VAJ the components are\nprivate I have to use reflection to gain access to them.\n\n    However, I still prefer the VAJ approach to that of JBuilder, as I can\nkeep the test code in seperate package. But that is imo a matter of personal\npreferences.\n\nToyin\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &quot;Jason Rogers&quot; &lt;jason.rogers@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;junit@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Monday, June 11, 2001 2:54 PM\nSubject: RE: [junit] Best Practice for Tests ?\n\n\n&gt; Out of curiosity...

I have decided\n&gt; to go for the seperate directory structure. The last\n&gt; option about embedding the tests in the class may make\n&gt; the code basedifficult to manage. You will have to\n&gt; have all of the testing resources in your classpath on\n&gt; production etc which does not make much sense. There\n&gt; is a tool called ANT which we will be using to manage\n&gt; the codebase. You can get to build all the code run\n&gt; the tests and deploy to production all in one script.\n&gt; I really like Together J but I have started using\n&gt; netbeans. It&#39;s totally free which my boss likes alot.\n&gt; The module for junit in that will create a test class\n&gt; for each class that contains empty test methods.  I am\n&gt; also considering a test sub directory in each package\n&gt; instead. I think the avoiding deployment of the tests\n&gt; to production makes sense.\n&gt;\n&gt; Cheers\n&gt;\n&gt; David\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- Steven Webster &lt;steven.webster@...&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve inherited a huge codebase which I&#39;ll be taking\n&gt; &gt; over development for; as soon as\n&gt; &gt; possible, I want to put skeletal JUnit tests in\n&gt; &gt; place for every class; as I perform\n&gt; &gt; refactorings, and as I introduce new functionality,\n&gt; &gt; my intention is to first flesh out\n&gt; &gt; JUnit tests, before adding feature/refactoring.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; This raises several questions, most of all related\n&gt; &gt; to what are the best practices\n&gt; &gt; for keeping Unit Tests alongside code.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Options as I see them:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 1.    A separate directory tree with a root note of\n&gt; &gt; test, the package structure of\n&gt; &gt;       which reflects that of the codebase; keep the\n&gt; &gt; tests completely isolated from\n&gt; &gt;       production code, the downside being that if I\n&gt; &gt; refactor code around packages,\n&gt; &gt;       I have to remember to move tests as well;\n&gt; &gt; also, removes my ability to test\n&gt; &gt;       private and protected methods..\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 2.    A &#39;test&#39; directory in each package of the\n&gt; &gt; codebase, containing TestXXXX\n&gt; &gt;       classes; with a TestXXXX class for each XXXX\n&gt; &gt; class in the package above.\n&gt; &gt;       Again, can&#39;t test public/protected methods,\n&gt; &gt; and a little extra work is\n&gt; &gt;       required to remove tests from production code,\n&gt; &gt; but not that much.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 3.    Actually make each class in the production\n&gt; &gt; code it&#39;s own test, ie put the\n&gt; &gt;       JUnit testing code in the class itself.  This\n&gt; &gt; gives me access to protected\n&gt; &gt;       and private methods, AND makes it easy to\n&gt; &gt; refactor and move tests around.\n&gt; &gt;       Another upside is that the JUnit plugin for\n&gt; &gt; Together UML will create all\n&gt; &gt;       these test skeletons for me in this manner.\n&gt; &gt; Downside (and I see it as a\n&gt; &gt;       pretty big downside) is that my JUnit tests\n&gt; &gt; are all but impossible to remove\n&gt; &gt;       from my production code.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Has anyone got any thoughts on this problem ?\n&gt; &gt; Anyone been in a similar\n&gt; &gt; situation, and got suggestions they could offer ?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Cheers,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Steven\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; Get personalized email addresses from Yahoo!
