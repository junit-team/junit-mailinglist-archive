But somehow moving the clases into another project broke \nsomething in junit.\n\nThe packagenames of these classes are still the same as they were \nbefore. I read the FAQ about problems people have had with the \nswingui testrunner not working when the textui testrunner works \nfine... Last week, I had the same problem (classcast exception - with \nObjectivity, not ObjectStore) that was described in the FAQ, and so I \nmade up an exclude.properties file which fixed that problem already.\n\n#\n# The list of excluded package paths for the TestCaseClassLoader\n#\nexcluded.0=sun.*\nexcluded.1=com.sun.*\nexcluded.2=org.omg.*\nexcluded.3=javax.*\nexcluded.4=sunw.*\nexcluded.5=java.*\nexcluded.6=com.objy.*\nexcluded.7=com.archiserve.*\nexcluded.8=COM.odi.*\n\nBut now, when I try to run a test under the swingUI,\nI get the following error, printed in the bottom status bar, in red.\n\nFailed to invoke suite():java.lang.VerifyError:\n(class:com/archiserve/dal/test/TestOid, method: putObject signature()\nV) Incompatible object argument for function call\n\njust fyi, testOid is a test suite in its own right, and I was trying \nto run a suite of suites there via TestEverything.\n\nWhen I try to run TestOid directly, it just hangs when trying to load \nthe test case.\n\nClicking the &quot;reload classes every run&quot; doesn&#39;t seem to do anything.\n\nBut again, all works fine under the textui testrunner.\n\nAny other ideas?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
