That was the first thing we tried. J2ME doesn&#39;t support<br/>\ncertain features in Java that JUnit relies on. J2ME doesn&#39;t have reflection,<br/>\nfor instance, which is used heavily by J2MEUnit. J2MEUnit is basically just<br/>\na rewrite of JUnit&#39;s functionality, modified not to use those features of<br/>\nJava that J2ME doesn&#39;t have.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d love to try what you talk about, with the KVM being called through ant.<br/>\nIt would be interesting if it would work. If it didn&#39;t, it would be a simple<br/>\njob to write a new task for ant to make it work.<br/>\n<br/>\nbab<br/>\n---<br/>\nBrian Button             <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bbutton@...\">bbutton@...</a><br/>\nSenior Consultant    <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.objectmentor.com\">http://www.objectmentor.com</a><br/>\nObject Mentor, Inc.<br/>\n<br/>\nExtreme Programming in St. Louis <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/xpstl\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/xpstl</a></div>",
