The user<br/>\nwill select two data sources and do a &quot;compare&quot; of specific data between<br/>\nthe two sources.  The he can elect to do a &quot;copy&quot; of data from one data<br/>\nsource to another.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m doing the copy part, and that&#39;s done now (I know...I coded first). <br/>\nThe compare part is just beginning, being done by someone else.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the end, I want to be able to run an end-to-end test, where we set<br/>\nthings up, run the compare, and then run the copy.  But until then, I<br/>\nneed to be able to fake out the compare and just my part - the copy<br/>\noperation.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I understand it, all test* methods in the class will be run in<br/>\nwhatever order they appear in the file.  What I&#39;d really like to do is<br/>\nhave a testCompare and a testCopy, but I don&#39;t think I can do that and<br/>\nget what I want.<br/>\n<br/>\nI thought about having something like:<br/>\n<br/>\nclass TestOne extends TestCase {<br/>\n    public static boolean testCompare = false;<br/>\n<br/>\n    testStuff() {<br/>\n       if (testCompare)<br/>\n          doTestCompare();<br/>\n       else<br/>\n          doFakeOutCompare();<br/>\n       doTestCopy();<br/>\n    }<br/>\n<br/>\n    doTestCompare() {<br/>\n       // really do a compare test<br/>\n    }<br/>\n<br/>\n    doFakeOutCompare() {<br/>\n       // Put stuff in the data source to make<br/>\n    }<br/>\n<br/>\n    doTestCopy() {<br/>\n       // Do the copy test<br/>\n    }<br/>\n}<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I&#39;d really have only one test method that would get called, and he<br/>\nwould pick whether to do the real compare or fake it out.  Later on,<br/>\nwhen compare is ready to be integrated, then we&#39;d flip that testCompare<br/>\nswitch to true, and then we would have an end-to-end test.  How would<br/>\nthat do?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
