It is\na useful concept, especially when testing in a BDD style. Peopl=\r\ne like to\nsometimes &quot;flesh out their ideas&quot; by writing descriptive test nam=\r\nes for\nwhich neither the test code nor the code under test as yet exists. I=\r\n do\nsupport pending tests in ScalaTest, and when running through JUnit call=\r\n them\nignored tests. That&#39;s the closest thing to pending already understood=\r\n by\ntools that integrate with JUnit. So if you add something called pending=\r\n, you\ncould still possibly report it as an ignored test. To see an example,=\r\n look\non line 80 of RunNotifierReporter:\n\nhttp://code.google.com/p/scalates=\r\nt/source/browse/trunk/src/main/scala/org/scalatest/junit/RunNotifierReporte=\r\nr.scala\n\nBasically I do this:\n\n// Closest thing we can do with pending is r=\r\neport an ignored test\n      case TestPending(ordinal, suiteName, suiteClass=\r\nName, testName,\nformatter, payload, threadName, timeStamp) =3D&gt;\n\nrunNotifie=\r\nr.fireTestIgnored(Description.createSuiteDescription(testDescriptionName(su=\r\niteName,\nsuiteClassName, testName)))\n\nSo what you could do as a JUnit enhan=\r\ncement is for a pending test call\nfireTestIgnored with perhaps a subclass o=\r\nf Description called\nPendingDescription. So existing tools would still unde=\r\nrstand it is a\nDescription, but newer versions could detect it is a Pending=\r\nDescription and\nact accordingly. Or just add some state to Description that=\r\n old tools would\nignore and new ones could use to differentiate pending tes=\r\nts from ignored\nones. Something like that would allow you to add the new fu=\r\nnctionality in a\nbackwards compatible way.\n\nIn ScalaTest, for example, I co=\r\nuld later change the code above so it sends\nsuch a PendingDescription notif=\r\nication (though it would be a good long time\nbefore I did that because I wo=\r\nuldn&#39;t want to force people to upgrade their\nJUnit for a good while.)\n\nBill=\r\n\n\nOn Sat, Apr 16, 2011 at 1:13 PM, David Saff &lt;david@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; My current feeling is that the best thing to do is to somehow allow\n&gt; cus=\r\ntom categories of test results. I&#39;m very reluctant to increase the\n&gt; number=\r\n of built-in result categories, since such a change is one of\n&gt; the most li=\r\nkely to break, or at least be under-implemented, in IDEs\n&gt; and build framew=\r\norks.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m open to ideas about the best way to do this.\n&gt;\n&gt; David\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nOn Thu, Apr 14, 2011 at 3:26 PM, lars.vonk &lt;lars.vonk@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Hi,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I would like to see progress in (acceptance) tests not yet imp=\r\nlemented.
