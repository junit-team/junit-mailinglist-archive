Actually, i have been revie=\r\nwed some of the\ncode my team wrote. Since no one really thought about testa=\r\nbility, it\nis very difficult to ADD testing code unless we can do big\nrefac=\r\ntorying, which is impossible for our case. \n\n\n&gt;  One best use of JUNIT I ha=\r\nve found is that the major test can be\nrun during the start-up of the appli=\r\ncation, which is a nice feature,\nand it reduces lot of surprises.\n&gt;  Well, =\r\nthis is all I am say about JUNIT, in my view, I think JUNIT\ndefinitly has l=\r\nong term benefits.\n&gt; \n\n[Frank] This is a point I&#39;ve never thought of. Thank=\r\ns for sharing. :)\n\nCheers, \n- Frank\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
