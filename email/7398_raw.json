In \nparticular, dig into tests for some large open-source project like \neclipse.\n\nOf course, code in hand will only get you part of the picture. The more \nchallenging part of the puzzle is developing a sense of what tests are \nworth the effort. For a lucky few projects, the answer is obvious. For \neveryone else, success relies on cultivating expertise through \nexperience (or hiring it).\n\n-- Levi\n\nOn Tuesday, April 1, 2003, at 02:07  PM, swpalmer2001 wrote:\n\n&gt; Or is this unit testing just a passing fad that is\n&gt; really nothing more than a bunch of hype?\n\nPS&gt; Despite your opening disclaimer this sounds a little like trolling \n:)\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
