    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1491624526\">Hiya, this isn&#39;t strickly a JUnit question, but more a general java <br/>\nquestion, mixed with JUnit.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a piece of code (currently in a JSPTag) which runs a piece of code <br/>\nbased on the logical outcome of a series of boolean expressions (rules).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe code looks something like:<br/>\n<br/>\n  // Check currentRec status against props<br/>\n  if (<br/>\n    (props.isSomeFeature() && !props.isSomeOther() && <br/>\n!currentRec.isBilled()) ||<br/>\n    (another rule...) ||<br/>\n    (another rule...)<br/>\n    )<br/>\n  {<br/>\n    ....<br/>\n  }<br/>\n<br/>\nThe rules all boil down to checking wheather the current record should be <br/>\neditable, so I was thinking of moving it all into say <br/>\ncurrentRec.isEditable() to make it cleaner.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, I still don&#39;t really like the idea of the big messy if statement, <br/>\nwhats the best way to break it down in a way that is both easily <br/>\nmaintainable, readable, and testable?<br/>\n<br/>\nI was thinking:<br/>\n<br/>\n  public boolean isEditable() {<br/>\n    return (checkRule1() && checkRule2() && checkRule3());<br/>\n  }<br/>\n<br/>\nBut then I was thinking that these sets of business rules, look very <br/>\nsimiliar to a test case, a series of short routines, that look at some <br/>\ndata, and ultimately return a pass/fail response.  Whats the best way to <br/>\nhandle this?  I would also invisage having tests for each rule, <br/>\ntestCheckRule1, testCheckRule2 etc. etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nAre there any existing patterns/frameworks for implementing rule based <br/>\nlogic cleanly?<br/>\n<br/>\nMark</div>",
