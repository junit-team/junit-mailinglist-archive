After that it&#39;s:  &quot;Shooooot - What the heck is this???...Wait..., I wrote this...&quot;.\n\nWith test driven development it&#39;s very easy to write 10 very easy to exhaustively test methods that break apart the challenge into little pieces that can be easily comprehended again later, especially by looking at the tests.\n\nSo I would take a look at their current code (Maybe randomly pick it from 3 people without naming names) to find something that could be much easier for you to understand had it been supported by tests, and then break it up using tests during the training session.\n\nI think that would drive home the point that testing is about simplicity, collaboration, and continuity in addition to making sure the code is correct, and having trip wires that go off when an object commits a foul.\n\nCheers,\n- Ole\n\n\n\nMark Levison wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve been asked to organize a half-day/day long session to help a team\n&gt; at my organization really learn TDD. They have all been to a TDD\n&gt; course but for a variety of reasons didn&#39;t learn enough to pick up the\n&gt; habit. The developers all think that TDD is a worthy idea but don&#39;t\n&gt; know enough to practice it day to day.\n&gt; \n&gt; To make this worthwhile I think we need a more interesting example\n&gt; than the typical factorial example and a location that encourages\n&gt; pairing. I could start with the team&#39;s existing code and tasks but I\n&gt; think we would spend a lot of time on non-trivial edge cases without\n&gt; really hitting TDD. Instead I think I will offer to pair with people\n&gt; to tackle these problems.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m looking for any and all ideas, but have some specific questions:\n&gt; - What example would you use? Brian Marick had mentioned one:\n&gt; http://www.exampler.com/blog/2007/06/26/a-workbook-for-practicing-test-driven-design-draft/ \n&gt; &lt;http://www.exampler.com/blog/2007/06/26/a-workbook-for-practicing-test-driven-design-draft/&gt;\n&gt; but the downloads are broken.\n&gt; - Do you have an example that would demonstrate any of these difficult\n&gt; issues: abstracting the database, test driving bits of the GUI?\n&gt; - Do you have good examples to help demonstrate Test Driven\n&gt; Refactoring aka Michael Feathers and Legacy code.\n&gt; - Would you go off site? They don&#39;t have a team room yet.\n&gt; - Would a boardroom setup work well to encourage pairing?\n&gt; - How long would you make the session? Half day? Full day?\n&gt; \n&gt; What would you do?\n&gt; \n&gt; BTW this was also posted to the TDD group - with apologies if you&#39;ve\n&gt; already seen it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers\n&gt; Mark\n&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Blog: http://www.notesfromatooluser.com/ \n&gt; &lt;http://www.notesfromatooluser.com/&gt;\n&gt; One Year of Scrum: Lessons Learned\n&gt; http://www.notesfromatooluser.com/2007/10/one-year-of-scr.html \n&gt; &lt;http://www.notesfromatooluser.com/2007/10/one-year-of-scr.html&gt;\n&gt; Aperture vs. Lightroom - best comparisons\n&gt; http://www.notesfromatooluser.com/2007/02/aperture_vs_lig.html \n&gt; &lt;http://www.notesfromatooluser.com/2007/02/aperture_vs_lig.html&gt;\n&gt; Customer Retention Department - Vonage Customer Service Sucks\n&gt; http://www.notesfromatooluser.com/2007/06/customer_retent.html \n&gt; &lt;http://www.notesfromatooluser.com/2007/06/customer_retent.html&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n",
