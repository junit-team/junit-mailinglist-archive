You don&#39;t have the chance to test their stuff, so you can&#39;t =\r\ntrust it in production, even though I counsel in favor of trusting it durin=\r\ng development.\n\nSo said  Michael Silverstein  on  3/14/2003 ---------------=\r\n-----\n\n&gt;Good observation about using deduction to locate points of failure.=\r\n Not\n&gt;to be picky, I tend to view statements about the possibility of never=\r\n\n&gt;needing to trace code based on small scale examples, as similar to\n&gt;concl=\r\nuding that you don&#39;t need sight to drive on highways because of\n&gt;success tr=\r\naversing one&#39;s driveway with one&#39;s eyes closed. I agree with\n&gt;Steven below =\r\nthat the strategy you take depends on your context.\n&gt;Fine-grained test case=\r\ns may reduce the need for tracing code with\n&gt;debuggers but with any suffici=\r\nently complex application, especially one\n&gt;that interacts with questionably=\r\n documented 3rd party or system APIs, a\n&gt;debugger will at some point become=\r\n invaluable in determining the cause\n&gt;of failure.\n&gt;\n&gt;----------------------=\r\n-------\n&gt;Mike Silverstein\n&gt;SilverMark, Inc.\n&gt;The Object Testing Company\n&gt;ww=\r\nw.javatesting.com\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt;&gt; From: J. B. Rainsberge=\r\nr [mailto:jbrains@...] \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; I completed my first professional Rub=\r\ny project a week ago. It \n&gt;&gt; was nothing big: three weeks of Saturdays -- b=\r\nut it was my \n&gt;&gt; first professional project with a dynamically-typed langua=\r\nge \n&gt;&gt; with no type checker. This caused me some problems, just \n&gt;&gt; because=\r\n I&#39;m not used to it. I usually say, &quot;The compiler just \n&gt;&gt; stops me from ma=\r\nking mistakes that I don&#39;t make anyway.&quot; I \n&gt;&gt; suppose that&#39;s not quite rig=\r\nht for me.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Anyhow, that&#39;s just a lead-in to my comment. In many case=\r\ns, I \n&gt;&gt; would have either an unexpected &#39;nil&#39; value, or an object \n&gt;&gt; that=\r\n doesn&#39;t understand an expected message. My first \n&gt;&gt; instinct is to get in=\r\n there with &quot;p this&quot; and &quot;p that&quot;... \n&gt;&gt; then I thought of this: if I have =\r\na &#39;nil&#39; object over here, \n&gt;&gt; then there must be a bug over there... and wh=\r\nen I started \n&gt;&gt; writing tests checking that results are non-nil over there=\r\n, I \n&gt;&gt; no longer needed to trace my code.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; I&#39;m still learning.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n&gt; So said steven.hale@... on 3/13/2003 --------------------\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; My d=\r\nebugging habits are usually something like this:\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; 1. Read the error m=\r\nessage (if there is one)\n&gt;&gt; 2. Think\n&gt;&gt; 3. Read the log\n&gt;&gt; 4. Think\n&gt;&gt; 5. W=\r\nrite a unit test\n&gt;&gt; 6. Launch the debugger\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Since adopting junit (2 -=\r\n3 years ago) I can honestly say I&#39;ve \n&gt;&gt; not yet been forced down to level =\r\n6! I try to encourage \n&gt;&gt; programmers in my team not to start at 6 first.\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Judging by the varied responses there&#39;s clearly a whole range \n&gt;&gt; of =\r\nother successful strategies - maybe it&#39;s related to the \n&gt;&gt; type of applica=\r\ntion being programmed.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Steven\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;---\n&gt;Outgoing mail is cer=\r\ntified Virus Free.\n&gt;Checked by AVG anti-virus system (http://www.grisoft.co=\r\nm).\n&gt;Version: 6.0.459 / Virus Database: 258 - Release Date: 2/25/2003\n&gt; \n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt;junit-unsubscribe@y=\r\nahoogroups.com\n&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;Your use of Yahoo!
