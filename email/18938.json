So it is not so easy to have a look at at one code unit at a time.<br/>\n <br/>\nSo it could easily be the case that writing the tests afterwards will take a lot more time because you have to refactor your whole code before you can even start to implement the actual tests. Or to put it the other way round: TDD makes you write more modular, easier to read and maintain code.<br/>\n <br/>\nBest regards,<br/>\nMatt<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>] On Behalf Of Cédric Beust ? <br/>\nSent: Friday, February 16, 2007 5:48 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [junit] additional expenses<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHi Felix,<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is an interesting question, and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s been brought up here<br/>\nbefore.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my experience, this is a bit hard to quantify, but it&#39;s probably fair to<br/>\nsay that while the cost appears a bit on the high side initially (especially<br/>\nif the developers on your team are not used to writing tests and that there<br/>\nis no existing testing infrastructure), it tends to decrease over time as<br/>\nprogrammers become more experienced in writing tests, reuse or create test<br/>\nbase classes and tend to write solid tests in their first iteration.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough it&#39;s obviously hard to prove or disprove, I would probably say that<br/>\nat the very beginning, it&#39;s not rare to spend as much time writing a test as<br/>\nit is to implement the corresponding feature. That first test is always<br/>\nvery expensive, especially if it&#39;s an area of your product that has no tests<br/>\nat all. It all gets better after that.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope it helps, and looking forward to other people&#39;s answers.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nC�gic<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://testng.org\">http://testng.org</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://testng.org\">http://testng.org</a>&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 2/16/07, felix3142 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:f.noz@...\">f.noz@...</a> &lt;mailto:f.noz%40comundus.com&gt; &gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hello,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; we&#39;re going to establish unit-testing (basically for web applications)<br/>\n&gt; in our company.

I solely refer to the writing of unit tests.<br/>\n&gt; Later saving of time (by better code) shouldn&#39;t be considered. So<br/>\n&gt; what&#39;s your experience? Can anybody do a statement about time<br/>\n&gt; consumption of writing unit tests?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Regards<br/>\n&gt; Felix<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>",
