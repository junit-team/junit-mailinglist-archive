It was difficult to explain and it made writing\n&gt; test runners more difficult. One particularly vexing problem was re-running\n&gt; single tests while making sure all the TestDecorators and TestSuite\n&gt; subclasses higher in the test tree were run correctly. \n\nAh. OK, that I hadn&#39;t thought of - and I have been peeved when I\nhaven&#39;t been able to rerun a single failing test (in Eclipse) because\nof some contextual problem, so now I see the motivation.  \n\n&gt; Now we are encountering just how heavily used TestDecorator and TestSuite\n&gt; subclassing are used in JUnit extensions. Our challenge is to provide\n&gt; equivalently powerful extension mechanisms while retaining the simplicity\n&gt; of the new approach. \n\nWe use one (two if you count a contrib as well as the main-line code)\nTestSutup decorators in our (Jena) test suite, both for doing once-only\nsetup for database tests - essentially, ensure that there&#39;s a clean\n(empty) database to work with. So it would be nice if there was at\nleast the machinery for doing something similar.\n\n[I&#39;ve twice printed, and twice lost before reading, the JUnit 4 into\n doc ... maybe this weekend, since it looks unlikely that I&#39;ll be\n mowing the lawn ...]\n\nThank you for unpacking. It&#39;s nice to know that it was my sanity\nthat needed checking.\n\n-- \nChris &quot;electric hedgehog&quot; Dollin\nIt&#39;s called *extreme* programming, not *stupid* programming.\n\n\n",
