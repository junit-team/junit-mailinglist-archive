Looking back at the emails we\n&gt; &gt;exchanged, your only real comment about it then was, &quot;I would be\n&gt; interested\n&gt; &gt;to hear anything you hear from your EJU customers about\n&gt; JUnitPerf.&quot; I also\n&gt; &gt;made the comment to you that &quot;I hope it wasn&#39;t too presumptuous of us to\n&gt; &gt;include it&quot;, which you never responded to.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; What surprises you about my response?\n&gt;\n&gt; No doubt, I was disappointed that you didn&#39;t contact me prior to\n&gt; distributing JUnitPerf.  It&#39;s not that I wouldn&#39;t have allowed you to do\n&gt; so, just that I expected something a little more collegial.  The\n&gt; after-action report stating that it was being distributed and that you\n&gt; hoped that was cool didn&#39;t sit well with me.  It didn&#39;t come across as\n&gt; genuine, but perhaps it was just my interpretation.  Going back to the\n&gt; reason for my response, it didn&#39;t have that community feel.\n&gt;\n&gt; I don&#39;t want this thread to become a reflection of your product.  If\n&gt; there&#39;s follow-up, let&#39;s take it offline.\n\nMike:\n\nNot to beat a dead horse but since your append questions my intentions in a\npublic forum, I do feel I should respond (just one more time) there as well.\nI agree that anything further should go offline.\n\nTo be absolutely specific, the integration with JUnitPerf in Enhanced JUnit\nconsists of a chapter in the manual on how to do additional stuff with\nJUnitPerf. This was based on some last minute ideas we had and chose to\ndocument shortly before release. We then had the choice of either providing\na link to JUnitPerf or providing the distribution itself. It seemed like it\nwould be more convenient for our customers to actually provide the JUnitPerf\ndistribution itself, and it was fairly small so we chose to do that.\n\nThis decision was made at the last minute when we were putting together our\nown distribution. Had the thought occurred to us earlier we might have\ncontacted you first, but it didn&#39;t and we didn&#39;t and for that I apologize.\nHad I had any inkling that it would have caused you or anyone else the\nslightest mental distress, I would have done everything in my power to\nprevent that. Again, I didn&#39;t get any indication that you were at all\ndisappointed in our correspondence last July but it might have been there\nand I just didn&#39;t pick up on it.\n\nIn the next release, we will take out the JUnitPerf distribution and just\nprovide a link to your web site. That will also settle the question of\nwhether our customers have access to the very latest JUnitPerf code, which\nsolves a problem for me.\n\n- Mike\n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nMike Silverstein\nSilverMark, Inc.\nThe object testing company\nhttp://www.javatesting.com\n\n\n",
