I&#39;ve long had a hope that we coul=\r\nd incorporate Johannes Link&#39;s\n&gt; excellent cpsuite runner into the core JUni=\r\nt distribution:\n&gt; http://www.johanneslink.net/projects/cpsuite.jsp\n&gt;\n&gt; Woul=\r\nd such a move handle your needs?\n&gt;\n&gt; David\n&gt;\n&gt; On Tue, Feb 23, 2010 at 10:3=\r\n0 AM, Loritsch, Berin C.\n&gt; &lt;berin.loritsch@... &lt;mailto:berin.loritsc=\r\nh%40gd-ais.com&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; When JUnit first started out, there really wasn=\r\n&#39;t any way to collect\n&gt; all\n&gt;&gt; the tests without writing a Suite. =A0Now An=\r\nt, Maven, and other build\n&gt;&gt; tools collect all the test classes and execute=\r\n them. =A0Essentially, the\n&gt;&gt; usefulness of test Suites has been greatly di=\r\nminished. =A0The problem\n&gt; that\n&gt;&gt; the build tools answered quite nicely wa=\r\ns the fact that manually\n&gt;&gt; maintaining the test suites can be a problem. =\r\n=A0People routinely forget\n&gt;&gt; to add test classes to the test suites, and i=\r\nt&#39;s not a question of\n&gt;&gt; laziness. =A0It&#39;s just a question of it being that=\r\n &quot;one more thing&quot; to\n&gt;&gt; remember that is so easily overlooked.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The Ca=\r\ntegories test runner provides a nice extension to Suites that\n&gt; give\n&gt;&gt; the=\r\nm some value again. =A0However, I&#39;d like to make use of them without\n&gt;&gt; exp=\r\nlicitly listing all the classes included in the suite.\n&gt; Essentially,\n&gt;&gt; I&#39;=\r\nd either like the Categories test runner to collect all the test\n&gt;&gt; classes=\r\n itself and apply the category filters, or have that built into\n&gt;&gt; the main=\r\n JUnit runner. =A0Adding support for a class collector is\n&gt;&gt; possible, and =\r\nmay even be preferable in today&#39;s testing.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Currently some projects ke=\r\nep unit tests, slow tests, and installation\n&gt;&gt; tests in separate directory =\r\nstructures so that Ant or whatever build\n&gt;&gt; tool they choose can run them s=\r\neparately. =A0Categories will allow these\n&gt;&gt; projects to clearly mark the t=\r\nests, possibly even assigning multiple\n&gt;&gt; categories to the tests. =A0This =\r\nprovides great flexibility in how\n&gt; things\n&gt;&gt; are run.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Of course, thi=\r\ns includes corresponding support in ANT to execute the\n&gt;&gt; proper categories=\r\n, or at the very least call the Categories test\n&gt; suites\n&gt;&gt; we&#39;ve set up. =\r\n=A0Since JUnit takes care of collecting the classes for\n&gt; us,\n&gt;&gt; it makes l=\r\neveraging that support as simple as calling a single test\n&gt; case\n&gt;&gt; which a=\r\nll the build tools already support.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; What thoughts do you have on this=\r\n?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n&gt;
