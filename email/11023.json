So, test that.  <br/>\nRefactoring to use streams would be a plus so that the tests don&#39;t actually <br/>\nwrite to disk.  I did this on a former project and it worked well.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the latter, encapsulate (into another class) the logic that goes into <br/>\ndetermining what to write to the PDF and test that.  Leave the testing of <br/>\nproduced PDF to customer tests (which may be nothing more than having a <br/>\ncustomer view some actual PDFs and say &#39;Yea&#39; or &#39;Nay&#39;).  I did this on a <br/>\nformer project as well and it suited our needs.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJason Rogers<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Where there is no vision, the people perish...&quot;<br/>\n    Proverbs 29:18</div>",
