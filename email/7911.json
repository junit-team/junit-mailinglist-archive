However, I need to make it as easy <br/>\nand seamless as possible to use. <br/>\n<br/>\nWith this aim in mind I&#39;ve written a VAJ tool to scan for tests at <br/>\nthe selected level (ie project, package or class), and run them <br/>\nautomatically. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow all the selection code works, the test classes work with the <br/>\nstandard main() running TestRunner, but I receive a <br/>\nAssertionFailedError: No tests found when run from the tool.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve tracked it down to the isAssignableFrom() method failing in the <br/>\nTestSuite construtor. This has me confused as by the time <br/>\nisAssignableFrom() is called we have already sucessfully loaded the <br/>\ntest class to get its constructor so the class must have been found <br/>\nin the classpath. <br/>\n<br/>\nAny ideas?<br/>\n<br/>\nTIA<br/>\nMichael Rutherfurd</div>",
