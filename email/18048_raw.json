Go for it. :-)\n\n&gt; I&#39;m still not convinced of the economics of unit testing at the\n&gt; lowest level.\n&gt; I&#39;ve been lurking this list for quite some time, attended online and\n&gt; offline seminars, listened to to Agile, XP and TDD talks, ...\n\nGotta love theory ... right up until reality smacks it upside the head.\n\n&gt; And apply it at work.\n\nNow you&#39;re talking.\n\n&gt; I am convinced that TDD is a right approach.\n\nMe too.\n\n&gt; I see big value in the agile methods.\n\nYup.\n\n&gt; But to my feeling unit testing can be done at the requirements level.\n\nOf course it can. No one around here is likely to say that it can&#39;t\nbe. Now, that said, we also believe that it brings many benefits at\nthe lower levels as well.\n\n&gt; That&#39;s why I am thinking about testdriving this approach:\n&gt;\n&gt; 1: Write unit tests only to test the requirements.\n\nCan&#39;t individual objects have requirements?\n\n&gt; 2: Write the code that implements these requirements, until tests\n&gt; pass.\n&gt; 3: Run the unit tests together with a code coverage tool\n&gt; 4: delete all executable lines of code not covered by the unit test\n\nIf the code was developed with TDD, will there really be much unused\ncode kicking around?\n\n&gt; &lt;/controversial&gt;\n\nGood for a first try, but you&#39;ll have to try harder than that to get a\ngood flamefest going. :-)\n\nYou see, to my mind you&#39;ve described integration testing. This is very\nimportant and needful to deliver software quality, but you&#39;re still\nonly testing the joined together building blocks. Does it not make\nsense to ensure that the blocks you&#39;re joining together are of high\nquality?\n\nSimon\n\n-- \nsimonpeter.org | simonpeter.com | techbook.info\n\n",
