B. Rainsberger &lt;jbrains@...&gt; wrote:\n...\n&gt; If Java had symbols (like Ruby does), then I would be able to have an\n&gt; exception class like OutOfRangeException ...\n\nI&#39;ve been experimenting recently with adding more custom exception\nclasses for similar reasons, but that wasn&#39;t a pattern I&#39;d hit upon\nwhen I wrote that blog entry.  not sure I&#39;ll stick with it, but there\nare times it seems worthwhile.\n\n&gt; ...and I&#39;m not arguing that a negative score makes sense. I&#39;m merely\n&gt; saying that without system context, it might or might not make sense for\n&gt; this class to defend itself against a negative score. It&#39;s possible that\n&gt; in the system in which it will live full time, that situation is never\n&gt; going to happen, in which case, someone /else/ (like the module that\n&gt; invokes this class) should check for such invalid data.\n\ntrue, and I wouldn&#39;t check like this uniformly. but I think it is\nimportant to distinquish between &quot;shoudn&#39;t&quot; and &quot;can&#39;t&quot; when making\nthe decision. there&#39;s also the question that as system evolves might\nthere be new callers?\n\n&gt; In the hands of a thoughtful practitioner, I believe Agitator to be a\n&gt; great thing. I am concerned that less-thoughtful practitioners will use\n&gt; Agitator as an excuse not to write tests. I&#39;ve heard it too many times\n&gt; already. I should make it clear: that&#39;s not Agitator&#39;s fault. It&#39;s just\n&gt; a statement about the product and what it does. Any product, of course,\n&gt; can be abused.\n\nthe question of the &quot;less-thoughtful&quot; is something I&#39;ve wrestled with\na few times while at Agitar. (the Management Dashboard is ripe for\nabuse in the wrong environment.) but what I&#39;ve always settled on is\nthat we need to focus on making the tools as useful as possible for\nthose with good intent, and it is better to offer those people\nsomething a solution rather than to deny it because of how it might be\nabused.\n\nJtf\n\n-- \n\nhttp://www.developertesting.com/\n\n",
