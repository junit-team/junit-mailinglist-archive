(Note: A more<br/>\n&gt; standard call back syntax ... i.e. use preTest()/postTest() [or even<br/>\n&gt; preTestCB()/postTestCB()] to wrap setUp()/testDown() could be<br/>\n&gt; favored.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Once  JUnit 4.xxx is back ported it would be possible for you to write your<br/>\nown base class implementation just as you describe.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom experience in the .NET world there is some real advantage to declaring<br/>\ntests using Attributes/Annotation. It makes it possible to derive your<br/>\nderive your test class from some other class.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis provides a comfortable migration (learning) path for developers<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; and, more importantly, provides a strategy to leverage all of the<br/>\n&gt; convenience extensions companies have built upon JUnit<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Martin it sounds like what you want is an upgraded Junit 3.8.1 with better<br/>\nsupport for fixture setup/teardown. Is that the case?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I want is the declarative approach for building tests (pioneered by<br/>\nNUnit, used by MBUnit and TestNG) made available to for Java 1.4.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf one prefers JavaDoc annotations you can always use TestNG.  Why<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; go down that path a second time?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Because TestNG isn&#39;t tightly integrated into Eclipse - so not only do I have<br/>\nto sell my dev team on making the change I also have to sell build services<br/>\non the idea. I have prove that TestNG should be a another dependancy in our<br/>\nbuild chain. In addition JUnit 4 has the profile that gaurantees the support<br/>\nlibraries like JMock et al. will eventually be support it. I&#39;m not convinced<br/>\nthat TestNG has the same momentum (sorry Cedric). This is a little bit like<br/>\nthe .Net world NUnit is the leading tool with the most support, while MBUnit<br/>\nis consistently the innovator. As a result the MBUnit bend over backwards to<br/>\nbe compatible with NUnit so that tests and tools move from NUnit with no<br/>\neffort.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<br/>\nMark<br/>\n----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nBlog: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.notesfromatooluser.com/\">http://www.notesfromatooluser.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
