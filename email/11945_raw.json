Is there better way?\n\nThat is exactly correct. Typically, you write ONE test, make it\ncompile, then make it pass. Then you write the next test, and so on.\nYou go back and forth between having all tests passing, and having\n(usually) just the one you are working on fail.\n\nIf you need to have all tests written in advance, you may have to do\nsomething a bit more complex. For example, you could provide versions\nof your test suite, with each version having one more test than the\none before it. Students would then have to download the tests, one by\none. That would be horrible to maintain.\n\nOr you could provide a printed sheet of the tests (or an electronic\ncopy) and have them copy one test at a time into their test classes.\nThat is much easier and not much of an imposition for the students.\n\nIdeally, of course, you teach them to write the tests for themselves.\nThat is really the best way, but you might use one of the other\napproaches first if they are not ready.\n\n",
