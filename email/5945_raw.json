Four, in fact. Two of them are\nsimply subclasses of the AWT and Swing test runners that add menus to the\noriginal ones. It would be silly to write an entire test runner from scratch\njust for that purpose, although there was some replication of code. Two more\nare subclasses of BaseTestRunner, one of which runs on a remote agent and\nsends test results back and another runs in a thread and adds results to a\nresults collector.\n\nBy the way and just to clarify, Test Mentor is a stand-alone Java testing\nproduct. Enhanced JUnit is JUnit with some Test Mentor functionality grafted\non via menus, plus the ability to distribute JUnit tests across VMs.\n\n- Mike\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Kent Beck [mailto:kentbeck@...]\n&gt; Sent: Friday, October 04, 2002 8:29 PM\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: [junit] Test runners\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I looked at the Test Mentor stuff. There&#39;s a lot of functionality there.\n&gt; What I&#39;m wondering is, why are you still using the existing AWT\n&gt; TestRunner? Writing a new runner just isn&#39;t that much work, not compared\n&gt; with what you&#39;ve added. By starting a runner from scratch you could\n&gt; avoid many of the problems you&#39;re having with extensibility.\n&gt;\n&gt; Kent\n\n\n",
