My hierachical requirement is\n&gt;&gt;moved out as hierarchical helpers that are creating test\n&gt;&gt;objects (similar to ObjectMother pattern suggested by IIja).. how\n&gt;&gt;does it sound..? \n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Doesn&#39;t sound ideal, but like it&#39;s probably the best you can do if you don&#39;t\n&gt;want to touch the app&#39;s design.\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Let us not question the design for testing..\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;        \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;I didn&#39;t mean to be rude here.\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;No rudeness implied. Still, please notice that not wanting to question the\n&gt;app&#39;s design when encountering testing problems is unlikely to lead to\n&gt;optimal results. Problems in test design most often just are a result of\n&gt;suboptimal app design.\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;But I wanted to imply that\n&gt;&gt;the app design is done this way for various reasons.\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Certainly. I&#39;d bet, though, that it&#39;s possible to find a design that\n&gt;conforms to both the needs of testing and those other reasons, and that most\n&gt;experienced OO developers would say that such a design is better.\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;But the\n&gt;&gt;tests has to be written around the existing app design.  The\n&gt;&gt;issue in question was the test design not the app design.\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Then the issue is how to write unit tests for a suboptimally designed app. I\n&gt;hope you can now understand why Junit doesn&#39;t strive to support that very\n&gt;well out of the box - most Junit practitioners simply prefer to improve the\n&gt;app&#39;s design in those cases.\n&gt;\n&gt;Cheers, Ilja\n&gt;\n\nIndeed.  Its always tricky adding unit tests to existing code - made \neven harder when that existing code is sub optimally designed.  It would \nbe worth Arun getting a copy of Micheal feathers book - &#39;Working \nEffectively With Legacy Code&#39; .\n\nOne of the important aspects Micheal has identified when retro fitting \ntests, is that sometimes the code will have to be made even more \nsuboptimal to allow testing.  However, once its tested, we can then \nstart to refactor the design in a safer manner.\n\nhttp://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/beforeClarity.pdf\n\n\n",
