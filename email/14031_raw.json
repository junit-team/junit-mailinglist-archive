However, one of our goals in JUnit 4 was to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; remove the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; recursive composition of tests. It is difficult to explain and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; difficult to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; support properly in test runners. What I need is an \n&gt; example of JUnit\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 4-style\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dynamic test case creation.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Nothing is coming to mind at the present time.  Let me \n&gt; give this some\n&gt; &gt; &gt; more thought.  It may be a dead horse.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; BTW: I appreciate your openness to suggestions.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; From time to I&#39;m using something like this to verify some \n&gt; conditions:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; public static TestSute suite() {\n&gt; &gt;   TestSuite suite = new TestSuite( &quot;Validator&quot;);\n&gt; &gt;   for(...) {\n&gt; &gt;     if( condition is invalid) {\n&gt; &gt;       suite.addTest( new FailingTestCase( ..., new\n&gt; &gt; ComparisonFailure(..., expect, actual));\n&gt; &gt;     } else {\n&gt; &gt;       add a regular test to the suite.\n&gt; &gt;     }\n&gt; &gt;   }\n&gt; &gt;   return suite;\n&gt; &gt; }\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; We also use this approach but for a slightly different \n&gt; reason.  Some of \n&gt; our code connects to Salesforce.com&#39;s Enterprise Web Service \n&gt; (a hosted \n&gt; CRM solution).  The configuration settings for using that service are \n&gt; located in the web.xml file of our servlet.  One of the tests \n&gt; that run \n&gt; as a part of AllTests is to check the web.xml and make sure it&#39;s \n&gt; pointing at our mock instance of the web service so that our \n&gt; functional \n&gt; tests don&#39;t accidentally overwrite data that exists in \n&gt; production.  The \n&gt; test that runs to &quot;validate&quot; the web.xml is run initially and if it \n&gt; fails we do not build up the rest of the suite.\n\n\n\n",
