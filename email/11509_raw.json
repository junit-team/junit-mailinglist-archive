There&#39;s still no way of associating state with the\nindividual MyTestCase objects, between test* methods.\n\nWhat I want is more &#39;new TestSuite(new MyTestCase());&#39;, and then\nto have EVERY test on MyTestCase called with just that object.\n\nIf you look at the TestSuite source, the only way it has to add a\ntest is through addTestMethod.  addTestMethod relies on calling\ncreateTest.  createTest constructs a new instance, every time, of\nthe provided class.\n\nI admit, I don&#39;t understand the logic in this, and am looking for\nhelp.  It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t want my setup() and teardown()s called\nevery time (they&#39;re empty for me), it&#39;s that there is important state\nto preserve BETWEEN tests, in order to make a logical breakdown\nof tests that test correctly despite an unpredictable server state.\n(I.e. I can&#39;t assume the message that gets put to the server is\nalways going to be numbered &#39;1&#39;, and hardcode that in the rest\nof my tests.)\n\nWhat&#39;s the design rationale for making this (apparently)\nimpossible, or is this just a use case that was overlooked?\n\n--  Morgan Schweers\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, Jason Rogers &lt;jacaetevha@f...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Sounds like you want a OneTimeSetUp: \n&gt; http://www.testdriven.com/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?\nviewmode=flat&order=ASC&topic_id=1115&forum=7&move\n=prev&topic_time=10891402\n52\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; Jason Rogers\n&gt; 117 N.
