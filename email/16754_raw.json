B. Rainsberger&quot; &lt;jbrains@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Now I don&#39;t necessarily agree that checking an exception message is\n&gt;  &gt; /good design/. I also don&#39;t necessarily agree that having a negative\n&gt;  &gt; value for &#39;score&#39; is cause for an exception--it depends where the\n&gt; system\n&gt;  &gt; boundaries are.\n&gt; \n&gt; In this case &quot;points&quot; was the count of JUnit or Agitator assertions --\n&gt; negative values were non-sensical.\n&gt; \n&gt; And I&#39;m not sure checking the exception message in my test is a\n&gt; question of design at all, but out of curiousity, how do you TDD\n&gt; throwing an exception?\n\nI do it the same way you do, but rather than check messages, I design \nexceptions that tell me about the problem with non-text data. The smell \nwith checking exception messages is Primitive Obsession: specifically, \nusing text to represent something meaningful.\n\nIf Java had symbols (like Ruby does), then I would be able to have an \nexception class like OutOfRangeException that takes a symbol, value and \nacceptable range. Then I could expect this kind of exception:\n\n     new OutOfRangeException(:score, -5, Range.POSITIVE)\n\nmeaning that the symbol score, at value -5, is out of the range of [0, \nMAX_INT).\n\nSince we don&#39;t have symbols in Java, I would use a string to represent \nthe variable name. I don&#39;t like it, but I find it better than checking a \nmessage that can easily change. The concept of &quot;score&quot; in a bowling game \nclass in unlikely to change name.\n\n...and I&#39;m not arguing that a negative score makes sense. I&#39;m merely \nsaying that without system context, it might or might not make sense for \nthis class to defend itself against a negative score. It&#39;s possible that \nin the system in which it will live full time, that situation is never \ngoing to happen, in which case, someone /else/ (like the module that \ninvokes this class) should check for such invalid data.\n\n&gt;  &gt; Finally, I should mention that this is not the kind of design problem I\n&gt;  &gt; have in mind when I made my admittedly baseless claim. Since it was\n&gt;  &gt; baseless, I should revise my claim. Here it is:\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;      When I write JUnit tests, I am forced to deal with dependency\n&gt;  &gt;      problems in my code. I don&#39;t yet have any evidence that Agitator\n&gt;  &gt;      would help me with that. I am concerned that since Agitator helps\n&gt;  &gt;      me /not/ write JUnit tests, it might also help me /not/ feel the\n&gt;  &gt;      pain of those kinds of dependency problems.\n&gt; \n&gt; I think it is a reasonable concern but not something to fear in\n&gt; practice. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever worked with a customer where I\n&gt; haven&#39;t pointed to the screen and said something about dependency\n&gt; injection.\n\nIn the hands of a thoughtful practitioner, I believe Agitator to be a \ngreat thing. I am concerned that less-thoughtful practitioners will use \nAgitator as an excuse not to write tests. I&#39;ve heard it too many times \nalready. I should make it clear: that&#39;s not Agitator&#39;s fault. It&#39;s just \na statement about the product and what it does. Any product, of course, \ncan be abused.\n\n&gt; fwiw about the only JUnit tests that I haven&#39;t written becuase of\n&gt; Agitator are the ones I would have written to fix the bugs that would\n&gt; have otherwise have been reported.  :)\n\nThis is exactly how I expect to use Agitator: to help me find the tests \nI missed. When the day comes that I&#39;m on a full-time Java project (if \nthat day ever comes again), I will insist on Agitator.\n-- \nJ. B.
