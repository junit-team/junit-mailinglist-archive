As long as \n&gt; TestNG still reported it (e.g. as s=\r\nkipped, or as explicitly \n&gt; ignored), it shouldn&#39;t be forgotten.\n\nYup, that=\r\n&#39;s one way.  Another one is to create a group that is always\nexcluded from =\r\nyour test runs (sometimes, a test fails and I find that I\ndon&#39;t have the ti=\r\nme to fix it just yet and I don&#39;t want the test runs to go\nred for several =\r\ndays, so I need to disable it and make sure I don&#39;t forget\nto turn it back =\r\non later).\n\nI use the group name &quot;broken&quot; for that.  Among the HTML reports=\r\n generated by\nTestNG is one that lists all the groups and test methods that=\r\n belong to\nthem, so it&#39;s trivial to see what tests belong to the &quot;broken&quot; g=\r\nroup.\n \n&gt; (In JUnit, one way to avoid forgetting is to comment out the \n&gt; b=\r\nody of the test, and then assert that the test is being run \n&gt; before a par=\r\nticular date. \n&gt; If you do forget, you automatically get a &quot;wake up call&quot; w=\r\nhen \n&gt; the date is passed)\n\nInteresting idea.  It&#39;s too bad that it still r=\r\nequires active human\nparticipation, though, so you make me wonder if it wou=\r\nld make sense to\ninclude such hint in the annotation itself:\n\n@Test(enabled=\r\n =3D false, reEnableBy(&quot;2005-06-02&quot;))\npublic void insertIntoDataBase() {\n  =\r\n...\n}\n\nand the framework would automatically ignore &quot;enabled=3Dfalse&quot; after=\r\n the given\ndate.\n\nA bit convoluted but intriguing :-)\n\n-- \nC=E9dric\nhttp://=\r\nbeust.com/weblog\n\n\n\n",
