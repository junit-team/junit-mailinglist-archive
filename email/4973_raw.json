One of the \nfundamental tasks of a good GUI testing system is to decouple the gui \ntest from the actual gui layout.  If I want to make sure that selections \nin my list work properly, I want to say things in my test like &quot;select \nfirst item in the uppermost list&quot;, &quot;select last item in the uppermost \nlist&quot;, etc, and then check to make sure the accessible GUI properties \n(selectedIndex, selectionColor, etc) are what I expect them to be.\n\nUnfortunately, all Robot alone gives you is &quot;give me a mouse press at \nthis coordinate&quot;, and &quot;check the color of this coordinate&quot;.  To be \nuseful in unit of functional tests, you need a better abstraction layer \nabove Robot (I&#39;ve written a few, and it&#39;s kind of annoying knowing that \nSun has already done so... :().\n\nT.\n\nOn Tuesday, May 14, 2002, at 08:21 AM, J.

Unless you have very high confidence that screens will get \n&gt; to a\n&gt; stable state quickly, there&#39;s little point. Maintenance of the test \n&gt; cases is\n&gt; a nightmare.\n&gt;\n&gt; Of course, if someone out there is clever enough to have done this \n&gt; well, I&#39;d\n&gt; love to know about it. I could always use more tricks in my bag. :)\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt; J. B.
