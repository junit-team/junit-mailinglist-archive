I define acceptance testing to be black box integration testing of the API, with very little, if any, usage of Mock objects, stubs, or drivers. \n\nSo - to answer your question - I would think that utilizing the services of Junit for data driven testing application is certainly a good thing in the name of reuse and consistency, but mileage will vary as to how much of the framework you will really leverage. Yes - you will definitely need something to do the verification step, and Junit&#39;s assert class is a great candidate. However, keep in mind that most of your code to implement data driven testing is the code that implements the business logic of the test cases. \n\nPerhaps a combination of junit, and dbunit is a good foundation for a framework. In my eyes, it&#39;s designing and implementing the code that handles the keyword language of your data driven testing application is where the majority of the effort will be. \n\nI would love to hear some members usage of junit in the acceptance test development phase, and if anyone took their acceptance tests to the &#39;next level&#39; such that a keyword driven macro language is used to drive and customize the acceptance tests. \n\n\nMy background is &#39;code competent&#39; QA engineer/developer so I think with functional testing for a non technically savvy QA engineer in mind. Data driven testing is perfect for non technical staff to use as a test harness into the API. \n\nCheers,\nBill \n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: NOUSHI Reda \n  To: junit@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Monday, May 13, 2002 8:04 PM\n  Subject: Re: [junit] How to create data-driven tests? II!\n\n\n  Hi all,\n  My point is slightly different. I want to create data-driven tests\n  assuming that the data is what defines the test case&#39;s steps!\n  My input file would be something like that:\n  ? this\n  ! that\n  ? this2\n  ? this3\n  ! that2\n\n  And I want it to produce something like:\n  void Test1() \n  {\n  //do this\n\n  //assert that \n\n  //do this2\n\n  //do this3\n\n  //assert that2\n  } \n\n  I know I can write some script or class that parses the input file and\n  generates the test case class, but I want something like a single class\n  that does this job for me, like that of dbUnit. The problem with dbUnit\n  is that the data is what the test case runs on...\n\n  Thanks in advance,\n  Reda\n  -- \n  GCE/E/IT/M/SS !d---(+) s+:+(++:++) a-- C++ ULS++ P+?
