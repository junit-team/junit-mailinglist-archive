Do you think it could possibly accomodate most of\nthe extensions to junit outhere? (Cactus, JXunit, etc..) It would be great\nto be able to extend junit test cases functionnality without using\nheritance.\n\n&gt;Now for the &quot;count-assert&quot; mechanism: I don&#39;t think that adding a\n&gt;plug-in is the way to go.  The easiest way is to declare a static\n&gt;variable in the Assert class.\n\nI&#39;m aware that it&#39;s a little bit overkill, but it would be the first feature\nthat could prove the concept of extensions pluggability.\nI think that in the future, features should be very carefully added to the\nframework as a lot of people have a lot of tests written. So my point is I\nthink it&#39;s worth spending time to design an extendable core rather than\nspending time designing features. (I know &quot;spending time&quot; in the case of\n&quot;assertCount++&quot;  is not really a big thing ;)  ).\n\nAn assert() could be just one more CoreEvent  to your CoreListener design.\n\nmathieu\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: Vladimir Bossicard\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSent: Sunday, July 22, 2001 4:40 PM\nSubject: Re: [junit] Proposition (?)

It&#39;s a simple enough thing\n(I\n&gt;think) that it should not be impossible to do.\n&gt;\nI have studied the pluggability in JUnit and developped a first\nprototype.  What I have done is creating a basic runner that separates\nTextRunner and UIRunner from the JUnit core business.  My experience is\nthat it requires some changes but it is absolutely feasible.\n\nIf you are familiar with the internal JUnit business, here is how it works:\n- the CoreRunner registeres itself as a TestListener to the TestResult\n(in fact there is now only one TestListener)\n- Plug-in modules register themselves as CoreListener to the CoreRunner\n- TestListener&#39;s events are passed to the plug-ins via the CoreListener\ninterface\n- new events (like when the runner starts/stops running the tests) are\nalso passed via the CoreListener interface\n\nNow for the &quot;count-assert&quot; mechanism: I don&#39;t think that adding a\nplug-in is the way to go.  The easiest way is to declare a static\nvariable in the Assert class.  This variable is accessible by the\nCoreRunner and adding methods to handle this variable in the CoreRunner\nobject is not a problem.\n\n-Vladimir\n\n\n\n",
