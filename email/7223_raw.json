Not\nto be picky, I tend to view statements about the possibility of never\nneeding to trace code based on small scale examples, as similar to\nconcluding that you don&#39;t need sight to drive on highways because of\nsuccess traversing one&#39;s driveway with one&#39;s eyes closed. I agree with\nSteven below that the strategy you take depends on your context.\nFine-grained test cases may reduce the need for tracing code with\ndebuggers but with any sufficiently complex application, especially one\nthat interacts with questionably documented 3rd party or system APIs, a\ndebugger will at some point become invaluable in determining the cause\nof failure.\n\n-----------------------------\nMike Silverstein\nSilverMark, Inc.\nThe Object Testing Company\nwww.javatesting.com\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: J. B. Rainsberger [mailto:jbrains@...] \n&gt; \n&gt; I completed my first professional Ruby project a week ago. It \n&gt; was nothing big: three weeks of Saturdays -- but it was my \n&gt; first professional project with a dynamically-typed language \n&gt; with no type checker. This caused me some problems, just \n&gt; because I&#39;m not used to it. I usually say, &quot;The compiler just \n&gt; stops me from making mistakes that I don&#39;t make anyway.&quot; I \n&gt; suppose that&#39;s not quite right for me.\n&gt; \n&gt; Anyhow, that&#39;s just a lead-in to my comment. In many cases, I \n&gt; would have either an unexpected &#39;nil&#39; value, or an object \n&gt; that doesn&#39;t understand an expected message. My first \n&gt; instinct is to get in there with &quot;p this&quot; and &quot;p that&quot;... \n&gt; then I thought of this: if I have a &#39;nil&#39; object over here, \n&gt; then there must be a bug over there... and when I started \n&gt; writing tests checking that results are non-nil over there, I \n&gt; no longer needed to trace my code.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m still learning.\n&gt; \n&gt; So said steven.hale@... on 3/13/2003 --------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; My debugging habits are usually something like this:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. Read the error message (if there is one)\n&gt; 2. Think\n&gt; 3. Read the log\n&gt; 4. Think\n&gt; 5. Write a unit test\n&gt; 6. Launch the debugger\n&gt; \n&gt; Since adopting junit (2 -3 years ago) I can honestly say I&#39;ve \n&gt; not yet been forced down to level 6! I try to encourage \n&gt; programmers in my team not to start at 6 first.\n&gt; \n&gt; Judging by the varied responses there&#39;s clearly a whole range \n&gt; of other successful strategies - maybe it&#39;s related to the \n&gt; type of application being programmed.\n&gt; \n&gt; Steven\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n---\nOutgoing mail is certified Virus Free.\nChecked by AVG anti-virus system (http://www.grisoft.com).\nVersion: 6.0.459 / Virus Database: 258 - Release Date: 2/25/2003\n \n\n\n",
