I&#39;m writing an UI for them to run the tests,\nand they want to have the option to pick out the tests they like to run\nand change parameters... and thus, I need a way externally to decide on\nthese options at runtime. Yes, perhaps there are other [better] options\nbut I have started with JUnit and I would like to stay with it at least\nfor this project.\n\n \n\nVietchau\n\n \n\n________________________________\n\nFrom: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of\nMike Bria\nSent: Friday, January 05, 2007 8:42 PM\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: Re: [junit] Re: how to skip a test at runtime\n\n \n\nSlava --\n\nI don&#39;t believe I said that JUnit is a &quot;developer-only&quot; testing tool.\nJUnit is a testing tool, simply.\n\nThis being a JUnit list (and not a &quot;Software Testing&quot; list), I&#39;d rather\nnot get too immersed into a discussion about overall [organizational]\nsoftware testing best practices.\n\nThat said, I do feel unable to decline from commenting that, while as a\ngeneral rule I certainly love an abundance of JUNit use (it&#39;s the\ncoolest!), I fail to see how the average someone who categorizes\nthemselves as a &quot;Quality Assurance (QA)&quot; tester would be wisely spending\ntheir time writing, reading, and/or maintaining [Java-based] JUnit tests\nwith the existence of other more suitable &quot;non-techie&quot; fronted automated\ntesting tools...or when they could be simply testing the system\ndirectly.\n\nAs for the perceived benefit of having &quot;a common platform&quot;, I think that\nmight be true only as long as you intend to staff only people versed in\nthat platform&#39;s common language for as long as the product is in\ndevelopment.\n\nSo, in short, I&#39;m not challenging JUnit&#39;s suitability for &quot;functional&quot;\n(integration?) tests, but rather it&#39;s suitability as a &quot;one-size fits\nall&quot; testing tool for your organization.\n\nCheers...\n--MB\n\np.s.// can you tell me what &quot;HTH&quot; stands for?\n\nSlava Imeshev wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Mike,\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m curious about how (why?) &quot;QA&quot; is using JUnit tests.\n&gt; \n&gt; Having a common platform that runs it all is good. Unit tests and\n&gt; using JUnit overgrew &quot;developer-only&quot; testing long ago. Sooner\n&gt; (better) or later they become functional tests, user acceptance tests\n&gt; and what not.\n&gt; \n&gt; So, to me limiting test run by QA is a natural requirements. We use\n&gt; Ant&#39;s &lt;batchtest if=&quot;...&quot;&gt; to select what test groups should be run in\n&gt; a particular case.\n&gt; \n&gt; HTH\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Slava Imeshev\n\n \n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
