If you want to mark methods private, you\n&gt;&gt; put them in a protocol that suggests they shouldn&#39;t be used directly.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m far from a Smalltalk expert, so if somebody is please correct me.\n&gt; However, that&#39;s not my understanding. What I think is the case is that\n&gt; in Smalltalk access protection is object-scoped rather than\n&gt; class-scoped. In Smalltalk, any object can see all of its members,\n&gt; including members declared private in a superclass, but not the\n&gt; private members of its sibling objects and unrelated objects. Thus\n&gt; Smalltalk private is a little more like Java protected, though still\n&gt; not quite the same thing. However, privacy is still stronger than\n&gt; just a suggestion. \n&gt; \nref=nosim\n\n\n\n\nYahoo! Groups Links\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
