If you can give us some information on what the &#39;void&#39; method does, we may have a suggestion for you.<br/>\n<br/>\nConsider the event/listener design in Java. An event source exposes &#39;addXXXListener&#39; and &#39;removeXXXListener&#39;, but no methods to query the list of listeners. After all, only the event source needs to know who the listeners are at any given moment.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou want to test &#39;addXXXListener&#39; to see whether it really does add the listener. You have two choices.<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Add &#39;containsXXXListener&#39; to the event source and use it in your tests. This is essentially the &#39;get&#39; method you don&#39;t want to use.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Add a listener to the event source, tell the event source to fire an event, then check that the listener heard the event.<br/>\n<br/>\nOption #1 is cleaner, although it adds a method &#39;just for testing&#39;. Rather than drag up my past comments in that direction, I suggest searching this group for the phrase &quot;just for testing&quot; and read the messages you find.<br/>\n<br/>\nOption #2 avoids the extra method, but relies on knowing how to fire an event, which kind of event is fired and building a listener that listens for that kind of event *and* can tell you whether it heard that event. That was a lot to type: the code must be more work! Also if the event source changes its internal workings, your test may no longer work. With Option #1, there&#39;s not much danger in the event source changing in a way that might break your test.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor details, look for &quot;JUnit Cookbook&quot; from Manning publications, although you&#39;ll have to be patient -- it may not be on the shelf until early 2004.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJ.
