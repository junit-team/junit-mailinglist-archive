Feel free to skip it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If, however, you find yourself a little mystified about your\n&gt; &gt; &gt; test case&#39;s behaviour, you have the option of turning on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the log to get another view on what the test case is doing.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Alternately you could run the test in a debugger. Or you could\n&gt; &gt; &gt; start writing a bunch of hand-crafted logging statements since\n&gt; &gt; &gt; logging is sometimes more effective than debugging.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; But in some cases the assertion log would already be logging what\n&gt; &gt; &gt; you need to know without your having to write those statements.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; It&#39;s just another tool that is sometimes useful. Debuggers\n&gt; &gt; &gt; are important, but you don&#39;t have to use them.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ...or you could write smaller, more focused tests and learn  \n&gt; something\n&gt; &gt; about design.\n&gt;\n&gt; Is this a fair statement to make? You&#39;ve never met Phil nor have you\n&gt; seen any of his test cases. You&#39;ve no idea if he writes small focused\n&gt; tests or not.\n&gt;\n&gt; I think we can all learn to do a better job but I don&#39;t think this\n&gt; sort of reply serves either Phil or you well. Perhaps if this\n&gt; discussion were face to face that would have helped us all.\n&gt;\nI agree, and on re-reading the statement, I can see how one could  \ninterpret it to be much more nasty than I intended it. I apologize to  \nPhil. I did not mean the comment to be nasty, but rather to offer an  \nalternative in a nice, neutral, non-judgmental tone of voice. Honest.\n\nPhil, you might already know a bunch about design, you might have  \nrelatively little experience. Either way, if you have not experienced  \nthe effect of writing small, focused tests, I recommend it. You will  \ncertainly learn something about design and you might find you don&#39;t  \nmuch want to log assertions anymore.\n\nI meant to say that the first time.\n----\nJ. B.
