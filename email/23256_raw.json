If they were non\n&gt; static, you could just create an instance and invoke=\r\n these methods on that\n&gt; instance.\n\nBut that won&#39;t be the same instance on =\r\nwhich the tests are invoked, so\nthe method would make no sense without glob=\r\nal side effects.  And if\nyou&#39;re going to do global side effects, you might =\r\nas well make the\nmethod static.\n\n&gt; That&#39;s what TestNG does, by the way, alt=\r\nhough it makes more sense for TestNG\n&gt; since it&#39;s that same instance that w=\r\nill be used to invoke all the test\n&gt; methods afterwards, thereby allowing y=\r\nou to share fields between your\n&gt; @BeforeClass/@AfterClass and @Test method=\r\ns.\n\nYes, and also allowing users to never be sure that changes to instance\n=\r\nmethods in one method won&#39;t corrupt results in a different method.  If\na us=\r\ner that is not an author of either framework is truly fascinated\nabout the =\r\ndifferences in design philosophies between the two\nframeworks, my guess is =\r\nthat they will create a thread with an\nappropriate title, so that those peo=\r\nple just trying to get their work\ndone can mute it and move on.\n\n&gt; It might=\r\n not be as useful for JUnit, but encouraging people to use statics\n&gt; in the=\r\nir test classes is problematic, in my opinion.\n\nI don&#39;t encourage it.  JUni=\r\nt encourages people to think about ways to\npush their designs in tests in d=\r\nirections so that most of their tests\ndo not require setup that is so expen=\r\nsive they have to wring their\nhands about how often it runs.  When that fai=\r\nls, JUnit allows users to\neasily separate the static state, which they _wan=\r\nt_ to think about\nmaintaining between tests, from the instant state, which =\r\nthey are glad\nto let the framework set up and teardown for them.\n\n   David =\r\nSaff\n\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt; C=C3=A9dric\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have be=\r\nen removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
