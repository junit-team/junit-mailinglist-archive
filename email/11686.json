I&#39;d be interested how you use functionality tests (in addition to<br/>\n&gt; unit tests?) and wether anyone knows any tools that are better suited for<br/>\n&gt; this kind of job than JUnit.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, Michael Feathers has written a fair amount about testing legacy <br/>\ncode (code without tests). You might like to hunt down what he writes <br/>\nabout that.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy codebase rescue approach these days is two-pronged:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Work with the people who know what the system is supposed to do, then <br/>\nwrite acceptance tests that capture that knowledge. I often do this with <br/>\nFit/FitNesse.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Write only the object tests I need to enable the refactoring <br/>\n/required/ by fixing a defect or adding a feature. It would be nice to <br/>\nrefactor for its own sake, but I can&#39;t prove that that delivers value. I <br/>\n/can/ prove that refactoring for 30 minutes saved me an hour adding a <br/>\nfeature, so it was worth doing.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for tools, I do heavily data-driven testing as well as acceptance <br/>\ntesting with Fit, and I do object-level behavior testing with JUnit. If <br/>\nyou don&#39;t know Fit, and JUnit is working for you, then keep using JUnit <br/>\nuntil you have a spare moment to experiment with Fit. :)<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
