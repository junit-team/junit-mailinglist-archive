The little code snippet=\r\ns I used as tests didn&#39;t have a return value, so the tests didn&#39;t have a re=\r\nturn value. I never found a compelling reason to add a return value, althou=\r\ngh I&#39;ve seen frameworks that relied heavily on return values from tests.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; What I wonder is if we should relax the constraint that tests cannot ret=\r\nurn a value. In the olden days it made sense because you didn&#39;t want someon=\r\ne to just happen to name a method &quot;test...&quot; and have it accidentally run as=\r\n a test. With @Test, this risk disappears.\n&gt; \n&gt; I think this would be a tri=\r\nvial change internally to JUnit. I&#39;m not sure how many external tools have =\r\nthe &quot;void only&quot; assumption baked in and how many rely on JUnit for validati=\r\non.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Kent\n&gt; \n&gt; On Jan 22, 2010, at 10:17 AM, dmcg123 wrot=\r\ne:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; After over 10 years of using JUnit, it has only just struck me th=\r\nat test methods must return void, but why?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve just come across a=\r\nn example where a particular test did a lot of work, and I wanted to piggy-=\r\nback on its final state by calling the method from another test. Is there a=\r\nny fundamental reason for not allowing me to return values? It might even b=\r\ne an opportunity to write an annotation expressing constraints about the va=\r\nlue returned.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Cheers\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Duncan McGregor\n\n\n",
