However, if I include the optional\nstring argument, then that mess=\r\nage is displayed in the output.\nI have a very high opinion of the Junit fra=\r\nmework and find it hard to\nbelieve that the null message is standard behavi=\r\nor.  It feels so\nclunky, almost as if Junit does not check to see if the op=\r\ntional\nargument was passed or not.  My guess is that there&#39;s a property\nsom=\r\newhere which allows me disable the null error but I can&#39;t find it.\n My othe=\r\nr option is to just add a string argument to all of the\nasserts in all of m=\r\ny unit tests (at this point, not that many although\nit would still be a pai=\r\nn and would probably take me at least a few hours).\nAny and all help is app=\r\nreciated.\n\n\n\n\n",
