Every tool manages to frustrate some \npeople, even JUnit.  :-)  But it&#39;s very valuable to get feedback from \nfrustrated users who are still trying to make things work.\n\nYou have a lot of specific questions, and if you choose to highlight one \nat a time, I think you&#39;ll get some really good answers from this \ncommunity. \n\nBut I was struck by your first real statement: &quot;I have to say it&#39;s fun \nto do the implement coding. But it&#39;s suffering to write JUnit cases.&quot;  \nIt made me think a lot.  I got into JUnit because I really _liked_ \nwriting test cases.  But I really respect some people that have been \nreally frustrated, like you are.  Is there more going on here than \npersonal preference?  I think there might be.\n\nI thought a lot about it, and, sadly, wrote even more.  Rather than \nburden the list with it, I&#39;ve moved my thoughts over to my tech blog:\n\nhttp://shareandenjoy.saff.net\n\nGood luck,\n\n    David Saff\n\nJean wrote:\n&gt; I&#39;ve written JUnit cases for over 1 month. \n&gt;\n&gt; I have to say it&#39;s fun to do the implement coding. But it&#39;s suffering to\n&gt; write JUnit cases. Because:\n&gt; 1. I need to know the correct result from the other way around and sometimes\n&gt; it&#39;s hard to find another way. \n&gt; 2. Database and JSP pages are difficult to JUnit test.\n&gt; 3. Mock objects brings more than double efforts during the whole develop\n&gt; process.\n&gt; 4. Exception situation is not so easy to make as JUnit claims.\n&gt;\n&gt; 3 friends in 3 different companies (small size and middle size company)\n&gt; complain JUnit as:\n&gt; 1. They planned JUnit testing firstly and they cannot keep it going. TIME\n&gt; reason?\n&gt; 2. It consumes a lot of time but hard to find big problems. JUnit does find\n&gt; small problems as we expected.\n&gt; 3. JUnit testing is not effcient enough.\n&gt; 4. Best JUnit tester is the senior software developer. But senior guys hate\n&gt; to write test cases.\n&gt; 5. For small company, it&#39;s really hard to choose between JUnit+develop and\n&gt; develop+functional testing.\n&gt;\n&gt; Is there anyone who is successful in deploying JUnit during develop as:\n&gt; JUnit + code + JUnit + code + System Testing? \n&gt;   \n\n\n",
