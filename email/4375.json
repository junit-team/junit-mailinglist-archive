Generating test stubs, especially from classes already written, <br/>\nrelieves you of the need to think about what you&#39;re testing. This is a bad <br/>\nthing, and often a Bad Thing.<br/>\n&lt;/quote&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree wholeheartedly with what you&#39;re saying.  Unfortunately, I was given the dubious honor of creating JUnit tests for code that was already written.  The test stub generator saves me alot of time creating stubs for methods that have 80+ &lt;ack!&gt; methods.  Then I go through and remove the stubs for methods that don&#39;t need to be tested and add test cases for methods that are more complex and require multiple test cases.  Stub generation is a timesaver IMHO, as long as you make sure you are still covering all your bases.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Josh</div>",
