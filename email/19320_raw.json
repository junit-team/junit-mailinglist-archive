These methods were the only=\r\n ones\nexecuted in the test class. Worked seamlessly with 4.1\n\nI just recent=\r\nly updated to JUnit 4.3.1, and the filter implementation\nno longer seems to=\r\n be applied. There is nothing I can find in the\nrelease notes that implies =\r\nthat this would have changed. The\nfrustrating thing is that setting breakpo=\r\nints in my filter has no\neffect - it is as if it is never being called.\n\nI =\r\nam including the filter implementation class and the invocation\nlogic.

That example did the trick. I was able to\n&gt; modify it, and our tea=\r\nm can now specify any subset of the test methods\n&gt; in a given class dynamic=\r\nally as part of their development process.\n&gt; \n&gt; I would strongly recommend =\r\nthat this trick (and any others that\n&gt; require extension/implementation fro=\r\nm JUnit core classes) be added to\n&gt; whatever &quot;recipes&quot; get documented.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n I feel very strongly about the utility of JUnit (or any similar tool)\n&gt; in=\r\n a testing-dependent development environment. The only drawback I\n&gt; can see=\r\n to using volunteer labor for documentation purposes is that\n&gt; these volunt=\r\neers would need access to the brains behind the code to\n&gt; write complete Ja=\r\nvadoc. For example, in following your example, I got\n&gt; tripped up by the Re=\r\nquest filterWith() method. So many frameworks\n&gt; today return a modified ins=\r\ntance of the class on which you are\n&gt; operating that I was somewhat surpris=\r\ned that the instance on which I\n&gt; called filterWith() was not modified.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; Upon reflection, your contract and implementation are perfectly\n&gt; reasona=\r\nble OO - the filtered instance is what is returned, not what is\n&gt; invoked. =\r\nThis is the kind of fine point that would be easy to miss in\n&gt; documenting =\r\nthis code as a volunteer. I point this out not as an\n&gt; argument against. In=\r\nstead, those who volunteer must be cognizant of\n&gt; the fairly subtle complex=\r\nities of this framework, and be willing to\n&gt; ask questions when contributin=\r\ng.\n&gt; \n&gt; Once again, thanks for the timely assist!\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In junit@yahoogr=\r\noups.com, &quot;Kent Beck&quot; &lt;kentb@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Michael,\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; You&#39;re rig=\r\nht that the JUnit documentation needs to be improved.

This was pretty\n&gt; &gt; \tstraightforward with JUn=\r\nit 3.8.1 - just create new instances of the\n&gt; &gt; \tderived TestCase with the =\r\nmethod name as the argument, and add them\n&gt; &gt; to\n&gt; &gt; \tthe suite.\n&gt; &gt; \t\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\tI am having a lot of difficulty trying to replicate this\n&gt; &gt; \tfunctionalit=\r\ny. The filter logic appears to be a one-shot exclusion\n&gt; &gt; \tfilter (everyth=\r\ning not matching is dropped), and I can&#39;t seem to\n&gt; &gt; find\n&gt; &gt; \tany documen=\r\ntation that would address this.\n&gt; &gt; \t\n&gt; &gt; \tAs Mr. Rainsberger and others ha=\r\nve suggested, I have searched the\n&gt; &gt; web\n&gt; &gt; \tfor an appropriate tutorial.=\r\n I have found a number of good basic\n&gt; &gt; \ttutorials (including some referen=\r\nces in this group), and a couple\n&gt; &gt; with\n&gt; &gt; \tsome advanced content. I can=\r\nnot seem to find one with the detail to\n&gt; &gt; \tunlock the tools and capabilit=\r\nies that I am positive are available\n&gt; &gt; \twithin the new JUnit framework. \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; \t\n&gt; &gt; \tI am also convinced that no one is as capable as the authors in\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; \tdocumenting the features of the framework, and I am having trouble\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n \tfind Javadoc for some of the classes and APIs in the JUnit 4.1 tree.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\tThere is a fairly good chance that I am looking in the wrong place.\n&gt; &gt; \t\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; \tIf anyone has any suggestions or guidance on these issues, it would\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; be\n&gt; &gt; \tgreatly appreciated.\n&gt; &gt; \t\n&gt; &gt; \tThanks in advance!\n&gt; &gt; \t\n&gt; &gt; \tMic=\r\nhael Schechter\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n",
