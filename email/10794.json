Typically, objects were being saved <br/>\nwith a &quot;created&quot; Date. We ended up having to pass the date to the <br/>\nmethods in question instead of instantiating the date inside the method <br/>\nin order to test effectively. Our whitebox tests with mocks were usually <br/>\nsucceeding, but the live integration tests with the database failed. <br/>\nSomehow it seems like a code smell, but fudging the comparison of two <br/>\ndates to ignore the milliseconds didn&#39;t seem right either.<br/>\n<br/>\nJohn<br/>\n<br/>\nJ.
