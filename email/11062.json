You<br/>\n&gt; can even define a but of the production class, a bit of the test class<br/>\n&gt; with the tests for that method or whatever, a bit more of the production<br/>\n&gt; class, and so on.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t like the built-in assumption that tests belong to production <br/>\ncode. A test is just another client of the production code, and clients <br/>\ndo not belong to providers. The implied dependency is in the wrong <br/>\ndirection and generally that way lie dragons.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  &gt; Why do you want a production class also to be a test? I think it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; generally a very bad idea.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t see what the problem with it is. It might cause a bit of code<br/>\n&gt; bloat, but that&#39;s often not a problem in many projects.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I disagree with the notion that code bloat is not a common problem. <br/>\nRefactoring exists in part because of code bloat.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the first part, I admit my reaction is mostly irrational, but the <br/>\nnotion that tests are clients of the production code is so ingrained in <br/>\nmy thinking that I&#39;m not easily swayed to think otherwise. It is my turn <br/>\nto sit back and be the patient observer who isn&#39;t quick to adopt a new <br/>\nidea without sufficient proof that it&#39;s worth adopting. (I suppose that <br/>\nhappens to everyone some of the time.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  &gt; This brings up something I am struggling with: in C#/NUnit, we can<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; declare a test without extending TestCase (even if we frequently extend<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; Assert, anyway). Is there some great benefit to this over the way we do<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; it in JUnit, SUnit, RubyUnit, PyUnit, ...?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You can do the same in Ruby&#39;s Test::Unit:<br/>\n </span></blockquote>&lt;snip-example /&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; One can even keep the &quot;dynamic&quot; feel of this but still have static<br/>\n&gt; typing by having the compiler do type inference, as done in Haskell and<br/>\n&gt; ML.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I know it&#39;s possible, but I don&#39;t know why it&#39;s valuable. Can someone <br/>\nwith experience doing both make a comparison? Weblog? Anything?<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
