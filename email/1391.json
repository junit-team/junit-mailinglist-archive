How did you<br/>\n&gt; accomplish it?  In particular, how could you drive a Swing GUI?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; By &quot;Functional Tests&quot;, I mean tests that check the entire application<br/>\n&gt; as a black-box (or very near to black-box testing).  It would launch<br/>\n&gt; the appliction, drive the GUI, and interpret the output of the system.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My team has been very sucessful with Unit Testing, and we want to<br/>\n&gt; advance to running Functional Tests.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; - Greg<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
