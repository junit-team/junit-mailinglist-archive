Do you think this would be a hangup often in scenarios you&#39;ve\n&gt; &gt; seen?  How did you solve such problems in JUnit 3?\n&gt;\n&gt; As far as I can tell from the community, they didn&#39;t. (I never\n&gt; personally dealt with the problem.) That was one thing they didn&#39;t like\n&gt; about JUnit: running out of memory when constructing test suites.\n\nThere&#39;s at least two ways that one could handle this issue in JUnit 4 \nout of the box:\n\n1) Write a Runner that returned a null plan, with a RunListener that \ndidn&#39;t care about the plan, such as the default command-line \nRunListener.  However, the current Eclipse runner would fall over if \ngiven such a request, as would the JUnit 3 forward compatibility layer.\n\n2) Since all the Plan needs is a list of test names, just create a list \nof names that is easy to remember, and large enough to definitely cover \nthe data space, such as the numbers from 1 to 10000.  For example, use \nthe built-in Parameterized runner, with a Parameters method that returns \na Collection whose size() method is a hard-coded number, and a lazily \npopulated iterator().  If there turns out to be fewer elements than the \nPlan predicts, mark the remaining tests as ignored.\n\nIs one of the community members that had this running out of memory \nproblem still around on the list?
