It se=\r\nems the only thing it gains is that the parameter to the matcher is the rig=\r\nht type for the comparison, but the actual underlying matches method does n=\r\not look at the generic, so if it wasn&#39;t the right type and generics were no=\r\nt used, the assert would just fail? I&#39;m I reading that right?\n\n--- In junit=\r\n@yahoogroups.com, &quot;yme0987654321&quot; &lt;yme0987654321@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; hasEntry i=\r\ns part of the Hamcrest library.

It does get deep, and\n&gt; &gt; in some =\r\ncases, compiler-dependent, if I remember correctly.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; However, we di=\r\nd find that in some cases, the signature of the\n&gt; &gt; _Matcher_ could be impr=\r\noved.
