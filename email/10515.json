I would like a checkbox which means add all those testmethods but<br/>\n&gt; commented out initially.

I would like to see a checkbox and textfield which would allow me<br/>\n&gt; to append a suffix to each testmethod. At my present stage of using<br/>\n&gt; JUnit, I find I start out with the test method given me by JUnit<br/>\n&gt; automagically,  then I populate the body with my test, then I<br/>\n&gt; copy/paste the testmethod, add 001 to the end of the first of them,<br/>\n&gt; 002 to the end of the second one, and go on to edit the body of the<br/>\n&gt; second of these testmethods.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Why not just change the name to whatever the test does, like <br/>\ntestFooDoesBar or testFooDoesThrowOnBarArg?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you copy your test code, consider moving the duplicated code to <br/>\nsetUp().<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 3. It would be great if while viewing an existing testcase file, I<br/>\n&gt; could bring up some JUnit wizard that lets me add more testmethod(s)<br/>\n&gt; from the base or, I guess, even some other, class.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My keyboard is my wizard...<br/>\n<br/>\nRobert</div>",
