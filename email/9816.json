And every such <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Here you say a fixture is an &#39;object&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; object instantiated from the same class embodies that fixture. As <br/>\n </span></blockquote>a <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; result, the class itself, being a blueprint for those objects, <br/>\n </span></blockquote>embodies <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; that fixture. Therefore, the test case class and the fixture are <br/>\n&gt; conceptually the same. The test case class is merely an expression <br/>\n </span></blockquote>of <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; the fixture.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Here you seem to say that the fixture is a class.  <br/>\nassertEquals(class,object);<br/>\n<br/>\nwill that fail?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Was it really necessary to write all that? I am not J J Sylvester. <br/>\n </span></blockquote>I <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; have no interest in proving everything I know to you from first <br/>\n </span></blockquote>principles.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; My apologies to the wider world for starting this absurd thread; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>I was<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; just trying to be helpful to the enquirer.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; No, you weren&#39;t. Now that you have established a pattern, I feel I <br/>\n </span></blockquote>have <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; solid ground on which to say this. You were being antagonistic, as <br/>\n </span></blockquote>you <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; have often been, by pretending not only to know it all, but that <br/>\n&gt; everyone else is therefore incorrect. As I am often accused of <br/>\n&gt; pretending to know it all -- and sometimes guilty of it -- I <br/>\n </span></blockquote>surely know <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; the signs.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I am a newbie to this discussion group (obviously) and am just <br/>\nlearning Java and JUnit.. and I can tell you that what Jim is saying <br/>\nis what is being taught at University level now.  Before you <br/>\nclick &#39;reply&#39; let me state that I fully understand that University <br/>\nand the &#39;real world&#39; are VERY different worlds.  However in defense <br/>\nof Jim, I have several times considered looking for a different <br/>\ngroup to follow about JUnit because of you J.B.  You may be King of <br/>\nProgrammers but your attitude doesn&#39;t fit well in a discussion <br/>\ncommunity.  I am new to Java but not new to the collaborative <br/>\ncommunity of news and discussion groups.  Let&#39;s learn from each <br/>\nother just as I have learned from all of you guys who know way more <br/>\nabout this stuff than I ever will.  But keep in mind, stepping on <br/>\nsomeone else never makes you any taller.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMatt Swaffer</div>",
