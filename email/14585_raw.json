One option\n&gt; is to just run the coverage tool from the command line or ant, but I&#39;d\n&gt; really like something more integrated, e.g.\n&gt; \n&gt; 0 a run config that would Run&gt;{JUnit, JUnit Plug-in Test} under the\n&gt;   coverage tool and display results in a view\n&gt; \n&gt; 1 mark un/covered sources in Outline view or editors\n&gt; \n&gt; The coverage plugins of which I&#39;m aware are\n&gt; \n&gt; * Clover\n&gt; \n&gt; * jcoverage\n&gt; \n&gt; * Rational Developer (Unfortunately its coverage tools are part of its\n&gt;   performance-testing tools, which complicates installation and use\n&gt;   for &quot;normal&quot; testing.)\n&gt; \n&gt; Are there others?\n\nAgitar&#39;s Agitator, which I finally saw for the first time this past \nweek. Impressive. Interesting. I&#39;d like to know more about it, but I \ncan&#39;t afford a licence.\n-- \nJ. B.
