Besides running time and number of <br/>\nfailures, the other distinguishing feature of acceptance tests is that <br/>\nthe interacts often cross the system&#39;s boundary.  By that I mean input <br/>\ncomes through non-java interfaces such as GUIs, message systems, etc. <br/>\nand output involve more side effects (i.e. go to places other than <br/>\nback to the source).  In some cases, these can be shoehorned into a <br/>\nJava interface (e.g. httpunit) but this is often where the need for <br/>\nother tools comes in.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe reason for fine-grained testing is that large-grained tests are <br/>\noverwhelmed by combinatoric explosion of conditions long before they <br/>\nachieve reasonable coverage.  The &quot;unit&quot; is usually a single class.  <br/>\nThe system can be tens to thousands of classes.  For small systems, <br/>\nthe gap may be small enough that unit and acceptance tests are <br/>\nsufficient.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOften, however, it is useful to have integration tests in between.  By <br/>\ntesting clusters of collaborating classes, integration tests can <br/>\nfurther reduce the number of acceptance tests needed to achieve <br/>\nreasonable coverage.  The thing integration tests have in common with <br/>\nunit tests is that by being entirely within the system boundary, they <br/>\ncan reuse much of the Java infrastructure, including JUnit, mock <br/>\nobjects, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest regards,<br/>\nLance<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Jan Kroeze&quot; &lt;thejcwk@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I think this summarises quite neatly what a couple of people have <br/>\nsaid,<br/>\n&gt; namely that switching to a dedicated framework from JUnit is only <br/>\nneccessary<br/>\n&gt; if there are quite a few / complicated integration tests.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I happen to agree with this, since introducing more and more <br/>\nframeworks into<br/>\n&gt; your project just for testing will certainly drive many programmers <br/>\nup the<br/>\n&gt; walls. You have to be certain the cost is worth the pay off :) Yet,<br/>\n&gt; especially with user acceptance testing, I have to side with going <br/>\nwith a<br/>\n&gt; new framework, if simply for the reason that the client should be <br/>\nable to<br/>\n&gt; read them.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 2008/9/3 kentb &lt;kentb@...&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;   Jan,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; You can use JUnit for longer-running tests, but there are some <br/>\nassumptions<br/>\n&gt; &gt; JUnit embodies that will cause some problems. JUnit assumes tests <br/>\nare<br/>\n&gt; &gt; atomic--they run or don&#39;t run, they run in unit time. Integration <br/>\ntests<br/>\n&gt; &gt; often take a long time to run, so interim feedback is valuable. <br/>\nIntegration<br/>\n&gt; &gt; tests can usefully have multiple failures, where that is less <br/>\ncommon with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; unit tests. OTOH, tests are tests--independent self-checking bits <br/>\nof code<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that run and get reported--and for that part of running <br/>\nintegration tests<br/>\n&gt; &gt; JUnit works fine.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; It seems to me to be a tradeoff between the simplicity of running <br/>\nall tests<br/>\n&gt; &gt; as JUnit tests and the challenges of getting the integration tests <br/>\nto run<br/>\n&gt; &gt; as<br/>\n&gt; &gt; JUnit tests. Different contexts will requires different solutions. <br/>\nIf I had<br/>\n&gt; &gt; a few integration tests, I&#39;d make them work with JUnit. If I had a <br/>\nlarge<br/>\n&gt; &gt; suite of integration tests that played a prominent role in <br/>\ndevelopment, I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; would use some other tool and integrate my unit testing results <br/>\nwith the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; integration results.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Regards,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Kent Beck<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Three Rivers Institute<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; _____<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a> &lt;junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt; [mailto:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a> &lt;junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt;] On Behalf Of Jan<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Kroeze<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Tuesday, September 02, 2008 1:05 AM<br/>\n&gt; &gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a> &lt;junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [junit] JUnit And Larger Scale Tests<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hi all!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m a bit of a newb to the whole TDD thing, but I understand that <br/>\nunit<br/>\n&gt; &gt; tests<br/>\n&gt; &gt; are supposed to be blazingly fast and not access the hard drive, <br/>\nnetwork,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; database or anything external to the code itself. To this end, I <br/>\nunderstand<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that a framework such as jMock can be used.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; So far, so good. But I find JUnit to be extremely useful for <br/>\nwriting<br/>\n&gt; &gt; integration, system and user acceptance tests as well.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Here&#39;s my question: what is the official position of the JUnit <br/>\ncommunity on<br/>\n&gt; &gt; using JUnit to do larger scale tests? Is there a better framework, <br/>\nor is it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; common practice to use JUnit for these tests as well?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; --<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Jan Kroeze<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  <br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -- <br/>\n&gt; Jan Kroeze<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
