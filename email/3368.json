On the topic at hand, I know that Vladimir Bossicard has implemented a<br/>\n&gt; scheme that will let you register services with the junit architecture for<br/>\n&gt; letting you extend it easily for custom reporting and what-not. I don&#39;t know<br/>\n&gt; the current status of that effort though so perhaps he can comment?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>He can comment, he can :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy project (www.bossicard.com/projects/junit.php) is the result of all <br/>\nthe experiments I made on JUnit over the last nine months.  I choose <br/>\nthis way not to replace JUnit but to see how users&#39; requests could be <br/>\nimplemented in JUnit (the official version).  I agree I coded a little <br/>\nbit too much and my version does not look like JUnit anymore :-) <br/>\nBecause this project is a prototype and not a replacement to the <br/>\nofficial version, I am not putting too much effort in it anymore and <br/>\nwait to see the direction Erich and Kent take with their framework.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am also working on another project with the idea to have more <br/>\nflexibility while running your tests (defining services accessible by <br/>\nall tests (single db connection, CORBA service, logging mechanism...), <br/>\nreplacing the different property and allTests.java files with XML files, <br/>\nwriting the output in an XML file and then converting it into HTML, text <br/>\nfile..., providing metrics for every test (and not only the failed <br/>\none),... ).  For those interested: www.bossicard.com/apricot, I&#39;ll <br/>\nrelease some code in the new few days.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Vladimir<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nVladimir Bossicard<br/>\nwww.bossicard.com</div>",
