Too often code is separated into<br/>\n&gt; more packages than it needs to be. As I said earlier, this should be<br/>\n&gt; less of a problem in future JDKs once package access can be extended<br/>\n&gt; into subpackages. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Our system has around of half a million lines of code in 80+ CVS modules. We<br/>\nuse a lot of dependency injection to manage our code dependencies. I don&#39;t<br/>\nknow how you would do this without public classes and methods.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr customers just care about a very small API, though. We started to manage<br/>\nthe *published* API by only publishing interfaces and some factories in<br/>\nspecific modules (everything public *in those modules* is published).<br/>\n<br/>\nHow does that sound to you?<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers, Ilja</div>",
