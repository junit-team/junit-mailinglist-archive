Run a bunch of test=\r\ns on a class without junit creating a new\ninstance of the class for each te=\r\nst.  I know you can use the\nBeforeClass and AfterClass methods to set stati=\r\nc data but that is so ugly.\n\n2.  It would be nice to have a chain of test w=\r\nhere if one failed it\nwould quit and not run any more.  Maybe this is alrea=\r\ndy available.  If\nit is please let me know how to do it.\n\nThanks\nBrian\n\n\n",
