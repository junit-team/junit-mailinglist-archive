We don&#39;t seem to have \nany special name for the latter. I use the term =\r\ntest case for\nthe combination of a test (set of predicates) with a single\ns=\r\net of parameters to which it is applied.\n\nIn theory &lt;g&gt; Theories could also=\r\n introduce data internally, but\nthis doesn&#39;t seem very practical. So theori=\r\nes are parameterized\nin practice, if not by nature. This tends to make them=\r\n look like\nparameterized tests when viewed from outside.\n\nAnd of course, th=\r\ne implementation of a parameterized test in \nan xUnit-style is typically a =\r\nmethod with arguments. The \nimplementation of a Theory is also a method wit=\r\nh arguments. Again,\nthis makes them look like the same thing - or as if a T=\r\nheory\nis a specialization of a parameterized test.\n\nI don&#39;t think that&#39;s th=\r\ne case. Or at least I don&#39;t think it&#39;s\nthe most useful way to view things.\n=\r\n\nDr. Who looks human, but he has two hearts. Those two sets of \npredicates =\r\nat the heart of a Theory are what make it what it is.\nWe could say - in eit=\r\nher case - that the doctor/theory is a \nsubset of humans/parameterized-test=\r\ns, with the addition of\nsome extra functionality, but this only makes sense=\r\n at a very\nsuperficial level.\n\nUse parameterized tests if you have a set of=\r\n examples you need\nto make work. Use Theories... well... if you have a theo=\r\nry that\nneeds to be demonstrated. In some kinds of work, we start with\na th=\r\neory. In other kinds, we start with examples and have to\nwork our way towar=\r\nd a mental model. IME, the former is more\ntypical in implementing algorithm=\r\ns while the latter is more\ntypical of business programming. Also IME, prema=\r\nture speculation \nabout the underlying theory/model, rather than just liste=\r\nning to\nthe customer, is a pretty common anti-pattern.\n\nFair warning: what =\r\nI know about Theories is based on my\ninterpretation of some of David&#39;s pape=\r\nrs and my efforts\nto implement it in NUnit, where it (a) works pretty well\n=\r\nand (b) is poorly understood by most users. I&#39;m generally \nfamiliar with ho=\r\nw the JUnit implementation works, but I \ndon&#39;t know all the intimate detail=\r\ns.\n\nCharlie\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: junit@yahoogroups.com &lt;ma=\r\nilto:junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt;  [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com &lt;mailto:junit%=\r\n40yahoogroups.com&gt; ] On \n&gt; Behalf Of Berin\n&gt; Sent: Friday, February 12, 201=\r\n0 3:08 PM\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com &lt;mailto:junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt; \n&gt; S=\r\nubject: [junit] Re: When to use parameterized tests vs. theories?\n&gt; \n&gt; My b=\r\nasic understanding of the _practical_ difference between \n&gt; them is that pa=\r\nrameterized tests have more restrictions on \n&gt; how the data is set up. For =\r\nexample, parameterized tests \n&gt; have an array of arrays, each internal arra=\r\ny is a set of \n&gt; parameters to apply to the test. Essentially, there is mor=\r\ne \n&gt; onus on the test writer to know what parameters are important \n&gt; to te=\r\nst, and how they are supposed to relate.\n&gt; \n&gt; Theories have much less restr=\r\nictions on the data, and instead \n&gt; force the test writer to focus on the f=\r\nunction of the theory \n&gt; independent of the data. That&#39;s a good thing IMO.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; My guess is that parameterized tests came first, and because \n&gt; of the=\r\n limitations it forced on the test writer theories came \n&gt; later. That is o=\r\nnly a guess.\n&gt; \n&gt; In some ways I would like to pair the expected result wit=\r\nh \n&gt; the passed in parameter, but that solution requires a \n&gt; parameterized=\r\n test. In most applications, I care more about \n&gt; the behavior of a class i=\r\nmplementing an interface, or \n&gt; something of that nature.\n&gt; \n&gt; What I&#39;m mis=\r\nsing here is what is the _philosophical_ difference?\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In junit@yaho=\r\nogroups.com &lt;mailto:junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt; , C=C3=A9dric Beust =E2(tm)&quot; &lt;=\r\ncbeust@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If my understanding is correct, there is definit=\r\nely an \n&gt; overlap between \n&gt; &gt; parameterized tests and theories.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; T=\r\nheories generate a set of tuples representing the combination of a \n&gt; &gt; dat=\r\na set, while parameterized can return... well, any data \n&gt; set. From \n&gt; &gt; t=\r\nhat angle, theories are a subset of parameterized tests, \n&gt; and as such, \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; might have been better off implemented as a utility function rather \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n than a full fledged feature.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --\n&gt; &gt; Cedric\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; On =\r\nFri, Feb 12, 2010 at 11:12 AM, Loritsch, Berin C. &lt; \n&gt; &gt; berin.loritsch@...=\r\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I know I&#39;m a little slow on the uptake, but=\r\n I&#39;m asking these \n&gt; &gt; &gt; questions so that I can formulate how I&#39;m going to=\r\n mentor \n&gt; my team to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; make the most of their testing investment.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; There is a certain amount of overlap between \n&gt; parameterized test=\r\ns and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; theories. The parameterized tests are a bit more of a pain to =\r\nset \n&gt; &gt; &gt; up; but they provide a little more control over how \n&gt; things ge=\r\nt matched up.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Of course, theories allow for much more robust data set=\r\ns by \n&gt; &gt; &gt; combining all the data points in every way. This can provide an=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; order of magnitude more tests automatically, but care has to be \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; taken. For example, the number of actual tests run is D^P \n&gt; where D is=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the number of data points and P is the number of \n&gt; parameters on a=\r\nny \n&gt; &gt; &gt; given theory. This can generate a lot of tests quickly, and the \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;runDiscretely&quot; option I hacked together for theories \n&gt; would defini=\r\ntely not be a preferable.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I now know that assumptions are filte=\r\nring devices for \n&gt; theories, so \n&gt; &gt; &gt; it does not mark the test as failed=\r\n. Essentially, the \n&gt; reason that an \n&gt; &gt; &gt; assumption is marked as passing=\r\n for the theory is that the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; assumption successfully filtered out tha=\r\nt data combination. I get \n&gt; &gt; &gt; that now, but I probably will use that fea=\r\nture very sparingly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The question I have is what problem was th=\r\ne reason parameterized \n&gt; &gt; &gt; tests supposed to solve, and how is that diff=\r\nerent than \n&gt; the problem \n&gt; &gt; &gt; that theories are supposed to solve?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --\n&gt; &gt; ***C=E9dric\n&gt; &gt; *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; [Non-text po=\r\nrtions of this message have been removed]\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ---------------=\r\n---------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
