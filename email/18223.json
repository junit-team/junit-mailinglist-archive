We can & do JUnit it all, but it&#39;s <br/>\njust such a big job to do. You&#39;re right that I can&#39;t, say, test <br/>\nanything about one Domain object without JMocking it&#39;s DAO and half a <br/>\ndozen more to make it with, and setting up their stubs & expects & so <br/>\non. <br/>\nBut maybe that&#39;s normal? <br/>\n<br/>\nCheers for the pointers to those books - I believe Da Boss is looking <br/>\nfor some reading recommendations for us, so that&#39;s perfect!<br/>\n  <br/>\nThanks a bunch,<br/>\nTracey</div>",
