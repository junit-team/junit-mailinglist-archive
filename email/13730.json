But, I don&#39;t really care one way or another.  <br/>\nUnless my runner distinguishes from errors and failures with a different <br/>\ncolor bar (a la some SUnit runners) all I *really* care about is <br/>\nred-bar.  I hardly ever notice the counts of errors, failures, and <br/>\npasses.  I only look at those numbers when I want some statistical <br/>\ninformation.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; In both cases, the test becomes red, which is what we<br/>\n&gt; want. My solution is easier to implement and easier to<br/>\n&gt; read.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>In what way.  Easier to implement because it&#39;s fewer key strokes?  I can <br/>\nassure you that I don&#39;t expend a lot of effort in writing asserts in the <br/>\ncatch block.  They are very simple and straight-forward.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Besides this, if another Exception instead of<br/>\n&gt; NoObjectFoundException is thrown, it indicates that<br/>\n&gt; something is terribly wrong with the system, and thus<br/>\n&gt; an error is appropriate in my eyes.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Not necessarily.  For instance, some of my current tests are SOAP <br/>\nclients.  Calls on the SOAP object (mock or real) can result in throwing <br/>\na java.rmi.RemoteException for several reasons, each of which is <br/>\nimpemented in a particular subclass of RemoteException.  I don&#39;t want to <br/>\nworry about which type of RemoteException is thrown, so I just catch the <br/>\ngeneric RemoteException.  Then I test the exception&#39;s message.  I don&#39;t <br/>\ncare to know which particular exception instance is thrown, I just want <br/>\nto know that what&#39;s in the message is what I think should be in there.  <br/>\nI don&#39;t get to control which instance is thrown, that&#39;s an <br/>\nimplementation detail which changes from time to time (eg. when a new <br/>\nRemoteException subclass is created)-- but I know that the exception <br/>\nshould reference my inputs.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour mileage may vary.  But as the OP asked &quot;which do you prefer&quot;, I <br/>\nresponded with my preference. ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJason Rogers<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I,<br/>\nbut Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in <br/>\nthe flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved <br/>\nme, and gave himself for me.&quot;<br/>\n    Galatians 2:20</div>",
