Someone who uses Java needs to do it -- that wouldn&#39;t\n&gt; be me. I could do it in Ruby, C#, or Smalltalk, none of which are very\n&gt; germane to this group. Something like this:\n&gt;\n&gt;   Write a loop that times itself, using really short names. Duplicate it\n&gt;   with really long names. Time the loops. Repeat until you&#39;re sure you&#39;ve\n&gt;   got data. I&#39;d have them in the same program. It might be desirable to try\n&gt;   it with one of the loops first in the source, then the other, just in\n&gt;   case of garbage collection issues or things like that. Or it might not.\n&gt;\n&gt; I know what I expect to happen, but I don&#39;t know what /will/ happen.\n\nWell, I think that you and I expect the same results.  A more reasonable\ntest would involve running a mix of programs that do Java-ish things.\nThey should get loaded from disk, they should send messages to one\nanother, they should hang around in memory doing nothing much, they\nshould communicate over the Net.\n\nOver the last ten years most of my work has involved the Internet.  Our\nservers spent most of their time waiting for communications; they\nusually ran at a few percent of CPU.  Whenever they didn&#39;t, we replaced\nthem with faster servers.  The problem was always disk I/O, memory\nfootprint, network I/O.   Any tests that I do will be biased towards that\nworld -- where I think that most Java applications live.\n\n--\nJim Dixon  jdd@...   tel +44 117 982 0786  mobile +44 797 373 7881\n\n\n",
