One of the concerns that I (and<br/>\ndevelopers) have is that we will end up with thousands of test cases, many<br/>\nof which will involve using substantial amounts of MockObjects to set up<br/>\ntest cases and that all this will become too much of an overhead to manage &<br/>\nmaintain. Specifically,  that changing code in the future will involve<br/>\nanalysis of not only the project code but also the junit test code - an<br/>\noverhead we don&#39;t have today of course.<br/>\n<br/>\nHas anyone applied junit on a large scale such as this? I&#39;d love to hear<br/>\ncomments about pros & cons and lessons learned etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nRgds,<br/>\nKevin.</div>",
