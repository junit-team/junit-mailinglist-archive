Your point is well taken that one<br/>\nassert may be more heavily laden with information than others.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo it really comes down to information content. If you have to report the<br/>\neffectiveness of your tests, typically to justify your efforts (and whys of<br/>\nthis are subject to debate elsewhere), then you want meaningful,<br/>\ninformation-rich metrics that are easy/transparent to gather.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy point is that there is more information content in your average assert<br/>\ncount than test case count. It&#39;s not very high in content but still higher.<br/>\nSome asserts imply more than others, as Kent&#39;s examples above show.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo assert is not a great metric but is certainly easy to derive, so why not<br/>\nuse it? It also promotes use of asserts, which is a good thing. Sometimes<br/>\npeople will create tests that have too few assertions and think they are<br/>\ndone if they run without exceptions. Reporting an assertion count in results<br/>\nwould make people aware of their lack of assertions. Of course you can<br/>\nalways get crazy and do derived metrics such as assert to LOC ratios, etc.<br/>\nbut I think that may be beyond the spirit of XP/JUnit.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; --- In junit@y..., &quot;Michael Silverstein&quot; &lt;msilverstein@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t have a strong opinion one way or another but I&#39;ve seen a<br/>\n&gt; number of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; appends that held up some number of tests as a metric of the<br/>\n&gt; effectiveness<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of their unit testing. It would strike me that a more meaningful<br/>\n&gt; metric<br/>\n&gt; &gt; would be the number of asserts, since that indicates how many<br/>\n&gt; conditions<br/>\n&gt; &gt; were checked for correctness. So it is true that a unit test passes<br/>\n&gt; or it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t and if it doesn&#39;t, you fix it and move on. However, if<br/>\n&gt; someone is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; going to tout metrics, they should at least pick one that is as<br/>\n&gt; meaningful<br/>\n&gt; &gt; as possible.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
