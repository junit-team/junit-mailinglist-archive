Using something like &#39;next&#39; basically refers to the=\r\n order in which the Rules are called. But for most Rules I have seen, the i=\r\nnteresting stuff happens in the Statements. So people say Rule, but really =\r\nmean Statement. And for Statements &#39;next&#39; doesn&#39;t make sense, while &#39;enclos=\r\ned&#39; does.\n\nJens\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, Malte Finsterwalder &lt;malte@.=\r\n..&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I would prefer to give rules in the order they are applied.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; How would I name the methods?

Therefor=\r\ne I created a RuleChain, which is a rule itself:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; @Rule\n&gt; &gt; public T=\r\nestRule chain =3D RuleChain.outerRule(new FirstRule()).enclose(new SecondRu=\r\nle());\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; What do you thing about the naming outerRule and enclose?\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; What do you think about starting with the outer rule instead of start=\r\ning with the inner rule:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; @Rule\n&gt; &gt; public TestRule chain =3D RuleCh=\r\nain.innerRule(new SecondRule()).enclosedBy(new FirstRule());\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If you=\r\n want to see the code, look at https://github.com/stefanbirkner/junit/commi=\r\nt/3584c44bedd8705f30dda4f4213fa45655b998c7\n&gt; &gt; The issue is https://github.=\r\ncom/KentBeck/junit/issues/193\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ciao,\n&gt; &gt; stefan\n&gt;\n\n\n\n",
