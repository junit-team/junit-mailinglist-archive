I hear all serious people have\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; their own runners anyway.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Rudeness objection. I use the basic test runners and\n&gt;  &gt; I am /quite/ serious.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sorry, your objection seems to be flawed logically.\n\nLet&#39;s see....\n\n&quot;I hear all serious people have their own runners anyway.&quot;\n\nif x is a person, and S x is &quot;x is serious&quot; and R x is &quot;x has his own \ntest runner&quot;, then the claim is...\n\nforall x (S x -&gt; R x)\n\nBy the law of specialization, in particular, if j means yours truly (and \nyes, I am a person), then\n\nS j -&gt; R j\n\nHowever, I don&#39;t have my own test runner, so\n\n~R j and (S j -&gt; R j)\n&lt;=&gt; ~R j and (~R j -&gt; ~S j)    [negating the consequence]\n=&gt; ~S j    [modus ponens]\n\nAccording to my reading of the situation, the result of my not having my \nown test runner is that I am not serious.\n\nThe problem is, I am /quite/ serious, having spent a year writing about \nit and all that. Say whatever you want about the quality of the work, \nwhoever spends a year writing on a topic is almost certainly serious \nabout it.\n\n&gt; You might be serious and use your own test runner.\n&gt; This does not preclude your also using the basic test\n&gt; runners.\n\nI don&#39;t see at all how this follows from the preceding. The claim is \nthat if I am serious, then I have my own test runner, but I don&#39;t have \nmy own test runner, so that implies that I am not serious. That is my \nobjection. I&#39;m quite serious.\n\n&gt; The fact that there is apparent need for better test\n&gt; runners, that basic runners are not used by all IDEs\n&gt; or ANT makes my question legitimate, I think.\n\nOh yes, just not the claim that &quot;all serious people have their own test \nrunners.&quot;\n\n&gt; JUnit is the de facto standard, but it&#39;s the TestCase\n&gt; interface, not anything else. Or am I mistaken?\n\nThe framework is what&#39;s standard, and not the test runners. Correct.\n-- \nJ. B.
