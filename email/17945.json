There is no value-add<br/>\n&gt; here.  Right?  No additional value to customers and no additional<br/>\n&gt; value to developers.  It is simply style.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Or, am I fundamentally missing something.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know about fundamentally missing something. But some small added<br/>\nvalue comes from being able to derive my test case from any class (including<br/>\nObject). On some rare occasions its been helpful to derive my test case from<br/>\nthe Object under test (BTW I&#39;ve only done this with NUnit in .NET land).<br/>\n<br/>\nIn addition assuming the test runners are like those in NUnit/MbUnit it<br/>\nwould be possible to write a new test runner that accepted tests<br/>\ndynamically. With some integration testing we did on a .NET project I used<br/>\nthis feature (it was fully baked into MbUnit) to create a test per query<br/>\nfile. The tests ran the query, exported the output and then compared the<br/>\nresults to a previously saved set of results. This allowed QA to extend the<br/>\nregression testing as they tested new features or bugs - without any<br/>\nintervention from the development team.<br/>\n<br/>\nMark<br/>\n----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nBlog: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.notesfromatooluser.com/\">http://www.notesfromatooluser.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
