Kent sent me a version privately \nsome time back. I don&#39;t know whether he ever released that publicly. \nThis version puts [] around the part that differs, but displays the \nentire strings.\n\nAnother thing to do is use your IDE: both Eclipse and IDEA offer a \n&quot;compare strings&quot; feature that pops up side-by-side windows and \nhighlights the portions that are different.\n\nAnother thing to do is compare strings less often that compare objects \nmore often, or compare shorter strings. Sometimes when testing is \npainful, the pain is trying to teach us about our design. (I don&#39;t \nbelieve this is your problem, but it might be, so I offer it as a \npossibility. Too many people discount it.)\n-- \nJ. B.
