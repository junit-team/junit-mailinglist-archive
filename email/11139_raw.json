Rainsberger [mailto:jbrains@...] \nSent: Saturday, June 05, 2004 3:50 PM\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: Re: [junit] Perform something before and after a complete test\n\n\nNeil Swingler wrote:\n\n&gt;  &gt; What is the advantage of the above code over the below code:\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;     private SomeClass thingBeingTested = new ThingBeingTested();\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt; setUp is called when that test is run. All the TestCase class instances\nare\n&gt; constructed when the suite is created so if you have 20 test methods, you\n&gt; will end up with 20 instances of ThingBeingTested existing concurrently\n&gt; which could be a problem if ThingBeingTested uses some valuable resource.\n\nThis is a great point, and it goes to show you that I never thought of \nit because I&#39;m able to avoid testing against such valuable resources \nmuch of the time. Perhaps I need to test more legacy code. :)\n\n&gt;  &gt; In other words, do we EVER really need &#39;tearDown&#39;?  I do see the need\nfor\n&gt;  &gt; setUp, especially if you need to construct (horror) interlinked mock\n&gt;  &gt; objects.  But why bother &#39;nulling&#39; out your locals? They&#39;ll be GC&#39;ed\n&gt; anyway,\n&gt;  &gt; right?\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt; tearDown is analagous to finalize. You probably only need to use it to\n&gt; release some non memory resource e.g. close a connection, rollback a\n&gt; transaction., delete some temporary files\n\nYes. The only difference is that someone actually /invokes/ \ntearDown()... and you know /when/ it&#39;ll happen, especially if you use \nthe JUnit-addons test runner. :)\n-- \nJ. B.
