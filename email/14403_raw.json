Is there a way to get\n&gt; around this issue? More specifically; is it possible to execute all\n&gt; assertions in a test function despite some have failed.\n&gt; \n&gt; I attempted using JFunc, but it is slightly incomplete. Other than\n&gt; this extension, I have had little luck finding anything else.\n\nThis is a FAQ, so search the web for more solutions. A summary:\n\n  * JUnit wasn&#39;t designed to work that way.\n  * If you want assertion #3 to evaluate even though #2 failed, then you \nprobably have separate tests, so separate them.\n  * You can get multiple failed assertions, but you have to fiddle with \nthe framework or test runner to do it.\n  * One of the other tools out there does it, but I don&#39;t know which one.\n\nSomeone will enthusiastically tell you how crappy JUnit is and that tool \nXYZ does what you want, if they haven&#39;t already.\n\nTake care.\n-- \nJ.
