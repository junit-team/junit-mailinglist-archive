I&#39;ll use the\n&gt; mailing list for discussions, then respond at Stack Overflow.\n&gt; Now, in you response you write &quot;This isn&#39;t easy, and is discouraged,\n&gt; because JUnit doesn&#39;t encourage dependent tests.&quot;\n&gt; I&#39;m not quite sure what that means :-). Is is possible, or not? Looking\n&gt; at the source code, it might just look impossible, but maybe someone\n&gt; knows something I don&#39;t?\n&gt;\n\nIt is possible, but you might need to write your own Runner.\n\nI had a pull request a while back that allowed you to designate groups of\nmethods that must &quot;happen before&quot; other methods but would not dictate the\nsequence within that graph, but then we lost interest it pursuing that line\nof testing.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;     * If I may, could I ask you to clarify your question into either\n&gt; &quot;Cannot be done&quot; or &quot;Yes. It&#39;s discouraged, you do it by...&quot;?\n&gt;\n&gt; And of course, from there on it gets messy :-)\n&gt; I know that JUnit doesn&#39;t encourage dependent test, and if our IDE of\n&gt; choice had better support for Testng (who doesn&#39;t have this particular\n&gt; sentiment),\n\n\nJUnit sees itself as purely for Unit tests.\n\nUnit tests by their very nature are supposed to be fast, so if your test\nrequires setup from a previous test... just invoke the previous test as\nyour first step in your &quot;dependent&quot; test, so you&#39;ll have something like\n\npublic class FooTest {\n\n  private Foo instance = new Foo();\n\n  @Test\n  public void something() throws Exception {\n    ...\n    assertThat(instance, is(inWonderfulState()));\n  }\n\n  @Test\n  public void whenInWonderfulStateWidgetsAreBevelled() throws Exception {\n    something();\n    instance.addWidget(new Widget());\n    assertThat(instance.getWidgets(), ... );\n  }\n\n  @Test\n  public void bevelledWidgetsOfAWonderfulFooAre5mm() throws Exception {\n    whenInWonderfulStateWidgetsAreBevelled();\n    ...\n  }\n\n  ...\n}\n\nIt doesn&#39;t matter what order the above tests are run, and dependencies are\nclearly called out. OK, so the something() method gets invoked 3 times, but\nthese are Unit tests, so it doesn&#39;t matter, and you have clean setup of the\nfresh Foo instance created for each run.\n\nAlso, by the way, true JUnit style is *one* assert per test method... ok\nnobody does that all the time... though when I have done it it has proved\nreally useful.\n\nTestNG cares about more than just Unit tests... when you hit more\nheavyweight tests, then you need to care about test sequencing as you\nreally want to try and keep the number of asserts per method down so that\nyou get a fine grained view of test failures.\n\nWhat I have wanted to see in JUnit is a way to mark smoke tests for\nfeatures. If the smoke test fails then all the tests that cover that\nfeature would be skipped.\n\nThe danger of such support is that it would be tempting to abuse for\nsequencing tests ;-)\n\n-Stephen\n\n\n&gt; we&#39;d just go down that route. But it doesn&#39;t, and now JUnit\n&gt; does support ordering, so we&#39;re trying to adapt to that.\n&gt; With JUnit 4.11, we&#39;ve got a way. If we find a way to create our own\n&gt; MethodSorter (which I hope for), we&#39;re good. If JUnit should provide its\n&gt; own mechanism (which I might dream of, but not hope for), it would be\n&gt; even better. Until then, method names are it, and now we&#39;ve got methods\n&gt; named &quot;test01_insert&quot; and &quot;test02_copy&quot;. It&#39;s not ideal, and I&#39;m a bit\n&gt; sad that the test framework insists so hard to not support us in our\n&gt; usage pattern, but I think that ship has sailed.\n&gt; Eirik\n&gt; --- In junit@yahoogroups.com, Matthew Farwell &lt;matthew@...&gt; wrote:&gt; Hi,&gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve just answered your question on Stack Overflow&gt;\n&gt; http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13723125/create-my-own-methodsorter-f&#92;\n&gt; or-junits-fixmethodorder&gt; &gt; 2012/12/5 Eirik Lygre &lt;eirik.lygre@...&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m looking at creating my own MethodSorter.
