My preferred solution is to design EJBs to be very thin layers \naround POJOs, so thin that the EJB (extending SessionBean, for example), \nonly does JNDI lookups and delegate to the resulting objects. No \ntestable logic at all.\n\nCould you do the same with your JNLP classes? I assume you need to hook \ninto the JNLP framework, either by extending classes or implementing \ninterfaces. Couldn&#39;t you make those extensions dumb delegaters to plain \nJava objects? Then you could test everything /except/ the JNLP wiring as \nnormal.\n\nMany people had trouble using this technique with EJB 2.0, because every \nexample they ever saw suggested they put all their logic directly into \ntheir session bean implementations--indeed, that was the point--so it \ntakes time to realize that this extra layer of indirection is worth the \neffort, and indeed in some cases, isn&#39;t worth the effort! Still, I think \nit&#39;s a technique you can try.\n\nGood luck.\n-- \nJ. B.
