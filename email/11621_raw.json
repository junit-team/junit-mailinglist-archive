I was reading the changelist wrong. I\n&gt; thought the change list was saying the new exactly() method was in\n&gt; version-1.0.1 but it appears above the version-1.0.1 title which, I\n&gt; guess, means that it&#39;s in a later version. I&#39;ll look into the snapshot\n&gt; version. I know it&#39;ll be in there. I just get a little leary using\n&gt; snapshots and/or nightly builds.\n\nIf you want the latest and greatest features....\n\nAt any rate, in the worst case, you could have built your own \nInvocationMatcher, or whatever that thing is. A little scary at first, \nbut likely not too difficult. Note that once() and exactly() are merely \nconvenience methods to make the syntax easier on the eyes. They just \ncreate InvocationMatcher objects (or whatever they really are) that \nmatch the number of invocations on verify().\n-- \nJ. B.
