My personal opinion is that it is a \nmatter of choosing the right tool for the task at hand, sometimes mock \nobjects will be better, other times Cactus should get the nod (particularly \nfor testing against multiple app servers in a running environment - which \nis more functional testing than unit testing anyway).\n\nRobert\n\n\n",
