While I agree that one runner with two\nmechanisms so=\r\nunds simpler than two runners with one mechanism each, I\nalso think that wh=\r\nen you have two mechanisms, you have to address\ntheir interaction, which ca=\r\nn lead to user confusion.

On the other h=\r\nand, if there is a way to solve this\n&gt;&gt; &gt; problem differently in JUnit alre=\r\nady, please let me know.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Ant and IDEA (the IDE from Intellij) don=\r\n&#39;t agree on how to gather\n&gt;&gt; &gt; classes for test. IDEA inspects the actual c=\r\nlass for things that\n&gt;&gt; &gt; extend TestCase or have a JUnit annotation on the=\r\n class (or have a\n&gt;&gt; &gt; static suite method) and executes the test. Ant gath=\r\ners tests via\n&gt;&gt; &gt; class names. To use the Ant method with JUnit outside of=\r\n Ant, you can\n&gt;&gt; &gt; use JUnitCore, and just pass it an array of classes gath=\r\nered in the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Ant form. However IDEA doesn&#39;t report those results in its=\r\n typical\n&gt;&gt; &gt; fashion. It uses its own custom runner to gather and run thes=\r\ne tests.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; The only option I see in the JUnit current code is to ma=\r\nke a custom\n&gt;&gt; &gt; runner that knows how to extract a Class[] array and pass =\r\nit on to the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; standard runner, and then use the RunWith tag to annotate=\r\n an arbitrary\n&gt;&gt; &gt; class to get IDEA to think that it is running a test sui=\r\nte. I haven&#39;t\n&gt;&gt; &gt; actually done this to see if IDEA has any issues, but it=\r\n seems like it\n&gt;&gt; &gt; should work.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; My proposal is to add an annotat=\r\nion to the Suite class called\n&gt;&gt; &gt; SuiteMethod that would annotate a method=\r\n that returns a Class[] array.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; The Suite would then be built from the =\r\ntwo annotations,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Suite.SuiteClasses plus any methods on the class (we =\r\ncould enforce\n&gt;&gt; &gt; that they be public, static, take no parameters and retu=\r\nrn a Class[]\n&gt;&gt; &gt; array) that are annotated with Suite.SuiteMethod and buil=\r\nd the Suite\n&gt;&gt; &gt; as a combination of all of the Arrays returned.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\nWhat do you think?\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; ----------------=\r\n--------------------\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
