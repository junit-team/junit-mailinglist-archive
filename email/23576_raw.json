We&#39;re happy to announce the release of JUnit 4.9.\nThis release&#39;s theme is Test-class and suite level Rules.  More\ninformation linked from\nhttp://saffgreenbar.blogspot.com/2011/08/junit-49-released.html, and\nrelease notes below.\n\nNote: please remember that until some website issues are cleared up,\nthe direct path to the new JavaDoc is at\nhttp://kentbeck.github.com/junit/javadoc/4.9/.\n\nShare and enjoy, and please try it out and give us feedback.  Thanks,\n\nYour friendly neighborhood JUnit maintainers\n\n\n\n## Summary of Changes in version 4.9, final ##\n\nRelease theme: Test-class and suite level Rules.\n\n### ClassRule ###\n\nThe `ClassRule` annotation extends the idea of method-level Rules,\nadding static fields that can affect the operation of a whole class.  Any\nsubclass of `ParentRunner`, including the standard `BlockJUnit4ClassRunner`\nand `Suite` classes, will support `ClassRule`s.\n\nFor example, here is a test suite that connects to a server once before\nall the test classes run, and disconnects after they are finished:\n\n\t@RunWith(Suite.class)\n\t@SuiteClasses({A.class, B.class, C.class})\n\tpublic class UsesExternalResource {\n\t\tpublic static Server myServer= new Server();\n\t\n\t\t@ClassRule\n\t\tpublic static ExternalResource resource= new ExternalResource() {\n\t\t\t@Override\n\t\t\tprotected void before() throws Throwable {\n\t\t\t\tmyServer.connect();\n\t\t\t};\n\t\n\t\t\t@Override\n\t\t\tprotected void after() {\n\t\t\t\tmyServer.disconnect();\n\t\t\t};\n\t\t};\n\t}\n\n### TestRule ###\n\nIn JUnit 4.9, fields that can be annotated with either `@Rule` or `@ClassRule`\nshould be of type `TestRule`.  The old `MethodRule` type, which only made sense\nfor method-level rules, will still work, but is deprecated.\n\nMost built-in Rules have been moved to the new type already, in a way that\nshould be transparent to most users.  `TestWatchman` has been deprecated,\nand replaced by `TestWatcher`, which has the same functionality, but implements\nthe new type.\n\n### Maven support ###\n\nMaven bundles have, in the past, been uploaded by kind volunteers.  Starting\nwith this release, the JUnit team is attempting to perform this task ourselves.\n\n### LICENSE checked in ###\n\nThe Common Public License that JUnit is released under is now included\nin the source repository.\n\n### Bug fixes ###\n\n- github#98: assumeTrue() does not work with expected exceptions\n- github#74: Categories + Parameterized\n\n  In JUnit 4.8.2, the Categories runner would fail to run correctly\n  if any contained test class had a custom Runner with a structure\n  significantly different from the built-in Runner.  With this fix,\n  such classes can be assigned one or more categories at the class level,\n  and will be run correctly.  Trying to assign categories to methods within\n  such a class will flag an error.\n\n- github#38: ParentRunner filters more than once\n\n  Thanks to `@reinholdfuereder`\n\n- github#248: protected BlockJUnit4ClassRunner#rules method removed from 4.8.2\n- github#187: Accidental dependency on Java 6\n\nThanks to `@kcooney` for:\n\n- github#163: Bad comparison failure message when using\nassertEquals(String, String)\n- github#227: ParentRunner now assumes that getChildren() returns a\nmodifiable list\n\n### Minor changes ###\n\n- Backed out unused folder &quot;experimental-use-of-antunit&quot;, replaced by\n  bash-based script at build_tests.sh\n- Various Javadoc fixes\n\nThanks to `@kcooney` for:\n\n- Made MultipleFailureException public, to assist extension writers.\n- github#240: Add &quot;test&quot; target to build.xml, for faster ant-driven testing.\n- github#247: Give InitializationError a useful message\n\n",
