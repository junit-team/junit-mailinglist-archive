The reason is\nthat JUnit =\r\ntests have always been isolated an we have come to expect\nthat to be the ca=\r\nse. It is quite convenient not to have to worry about\nrestoring state betwe=\r\nen testruns so that testB can never fail because\ntestA failed to clean afte=\r\nr iteself (or that testB does not run\nbecause it expects testA to have run =\r\nwhich makes it fail in\nisolation). Tests are of course not completely isola=\r\nted anyway since\nyou can write to the filesystem and mutate static data but=\r\n a new\ninstance each time sure helps.\n\nI wouldn&#39;t mind if it would be possi=\r\nble to share an instance (after\nall I don&#39;t have to use it if I don&#39;t want =\r\nto) but I think such a\nfunctionality should be the exception rather than th=\r\ne norm. One way to\ntreat such an exception would be to annotate the testcla=\r\nss as a shared\nfixture or something:\n\n@SharedFixture\n@RunOrder(AsDeclared.c=\r\nlass)\npublic class SomeTest {\n...\n}\n\nBut maybe I&#39;m getting ahead of things,=\r\n what would be the problem the\nabove would solve?\n\n/J\n\n\n\n-- \nJoakim Ohlrogg=\r\ne\nAgical AB\nV=E4sterl=E5nggatan 79, 2 tr\n111 29 Stockholm, SWEDEN\n\nBlog: jo=\r\nhlrogge.wordpress.com\n\n",
