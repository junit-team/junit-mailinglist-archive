    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1031432993\">EMMA (http://emma.sourceforge.net) is a Java code <br/>\ncoverage tool based on bytecode instrumentation. Whilst not the only <br/>\ntool on the market right now, EMMA strives to be different by being <br/>\nvery lightweight, flexible, and fast.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact, speed is one of EMMA&#39;s signature features. Besides using a <br/>\nfast bytecode processor (~2ms/class), EMMA can do instrumentation <br/>\nincrementally or even &quot;on-the-fly&quot;, without a special preparation <br/>\nphase.<br/>\n<br/>\nEMMA&#39;s mission is to move code coverage from an infrequent release <br/>\ngate (possibly run on a dedicated &quot;coverage&quot; machine because the <br/>\nlicense is too expensive for the entire team) to the domain of agile <br/>\ntesting and development (&quot;check coverage while still writing <br/>\ntestcases and *before* you check code in&quot;). Coupled with a very <br/>\nliberal license, EMMA is a tool that provides code coverage stats as <br/>\nan easy side effect of unit testing itself.<br/>\n<br/>\nEMMA is free/open source and at the same time coded from a commercial <br/>\nsoftware developer&#39;s point of view: it works in any (not just the <br/>\nlatest and greatest beta from Sun) Java 2 runtime and scales to very <br/>\nlarge projects (the largest single instrumentation run so far covered <br/>\n20000+ classes). It has no external dependencies and is not tied to <br/>\nany particular testing framework.<br/>\n<br/>\nEMMA home page: http://emma.sourceforge.net<br/>\nEMMA SourceForge project page: http://sourceforge.net/projects/emma/</div>",
