In the case of \ndiscovering rule methods from a single class, however, it seems the \npotential damage is limited. Also, the naming convention makes the code \nself-documenting to a strong degree.\n\nExample.\n\npublic class StopProduction {\n     public boolean canStopBuilding(Product product) {\n         return new ShortCircuitRuleset(this).evaluate(product);\n     }\n\n     public boolean ruleHasNotBeenSold(Product product) {\n         return product.getSalesOrder() == null;\n     }\n\n     public boolean ruleHasNotGoneTooFarAlongProductionLine(\n             Product product) {\n\n         return product.getLocationInProductionLine()\n                        &lt; ProductionLine.station(200);\n     }\n\n     public boolean ruleHasNotBeenConfigured(Product product) {\n         return !product.getConfiguration().isComplete();\n     }\n}\n\nHere, ShortCircuitRuleset discovers all boolean methods whose name \nstarts with &quot;rule&quot;. It then uses reflection to invoke each method \npassing in the parameters it received in evaluate(). If any method \nreturns false, the ruleset &quot;short circuits&quot; and returns false; otherwise \nit returns true.\n\nWhat does it take to know that the rule*() methods are likely invoked by \nreflection? Knowledge of the basic design of ShortCircuitRuleset and \nsearching for any ShortCircuitRuleset instance that refers to an \ninstance of the current class.\n\nIs that too much? I don&#39;t know. I know that Pluggable Selector gone mad \nis annoying like any other pattern gone mad. I just didn&#39;t think I&#39;d \ngone mad, so I&#39;m trying to understand why people think I did. :)\n\nThanks for your feedback.\n-- \nJ. B.
