I can live with the second issue :-) but\n&gt; the first is a bit of a pain.\n\nI&#39;ve encountered this issue myself in various forms, often when feeding \nin data from some external conformance test suite like the OASIS XSLT \ntest suite or the W3C XML test suite. Mostly I just ignore it. Once the \ntests are running, it&#39;s no big deal.\n\nThe best I&#39;ve found for handling this is simply to write a program that \nreads the input data and then generates a separate test method for each \ninput, then copy and paste the output of that program into my test \nsuite. The problem with this approach is that I have to regenerate \neverything when the external test suite changes, so mostly I don&#39;t bother.\n\nSometimes if there&#39;s a particular failing test case that bedevils me \nI&#39;ll manually break just that one out into its own test method. Then \nI&#39;ll write special case logic yo exclude that test from the main method \nthat tests the rest of the test suite.\n\n-- \nElliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nXML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim\n\n\n\n",
