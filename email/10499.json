Can you explain &quot;cascade down&quot;? <br/>\nWhat do you mean by &quot;placing&quot; a database connection? Take your time and <br/>\nbe less concise. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Hopefully someone else has had to perform this semi-functional semi-<br/>\n&gt; unit test.  A Testing Suite like this would help tremendously to<br/>\n&gt; regression test during maintenance efforts.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Based on your description, the complications come from your application <br/>\nand have nothing to do with JUnit or your testing approach. If you can <br/>\nexpress the test you need to execute in a single method, and if that <br/>\nmethod can accept every row in your data set as input, then executing <br/>\nthat test for every row in your data set is pretty simple.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ.
