The java.util.Set of listeners has an object added (the\n&gt; ContainerObjectView instance) while there is still an java.util.Iterator in\n&gt; use over the Design&#39;s listeners, which causes a\n&gt; ConcurrentModificationException.\n&gt; The tricky bit is that this will never happen when the Gui is not attached\n&gt; as a listener to the Design.\n&gt; The solution is to clone the Set or to use toArray(), and iterating over the\n&gt; copy instead.\n&gt; \n\n\nIs this the &quot;norm&quot; in the type of applications that you write?\n\nWe can write tests for the gui, no doubt about it - it&#39;s just I question how\nuseful such tests are when weighed against the effort that must go in to\nwriting them. You hit upon a case where it&#39;s not an option - you have to\ntest the gui.\n\n-- \nRobert Koss, Ph.D.     | Training, Mentoring, Contract Development\nSenior Consultant      | Object Oriented Design, C++, Java\nwww.objectmentor.com   | Extreme Programming\n\n\n\n",
