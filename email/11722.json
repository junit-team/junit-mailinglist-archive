User friendly guidance is important in all<br/>\n&gt; cases.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This isn&#39;t really a JUnit question.  It&#39;s a useability question.  Only<br/>\nyou and your organization can determine what the best approach here is,<br/>\nhowever I will give you some PERSONAL advice.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe list of ORACLE errors that can possibly happen are extensive.  I<br/>\nonce catalogued these in code for Oracle 9i (I think that was the<br/>\nversion).  It turned out that the catalogue was not that useful because<br/>\nmost of the errors were not recoverable.  That code ended up being<br/>\nrefactored to capture the generic SQLException and turn it into a more<br/>\nuser-friendly message.  Our hint to what was really going on were the<br/>\nlogs.  So, as a matter of experience I would suggest to you that you do<br/>\nnot try to capture specifically coded errors unless there is something<br/>\nyou can do about it programmatically.  For instance, the user will most<br/>\nlikely not be interested in the fact that the database needs to be<br/>\nrestarted.  They just need to know that something went wrong, and<br/>\nperhaps who to call when it happens.<br/>\n<br/>\nJason</div>",
