In order to do this, the JUnit class runs an instance of a\nprogram and determines whether it passes or fails.  Only one class is\nneeded because I can pass different projects and achieve the results. \nCreating multiple classes in this case is wasteful because all the\nsame code would be reused with the exception of the name of the\nclass.  However, because only a single class is used, the JUnit\nreport  option when running ANT cannot determine the difference\nbetween runs - it only knows it is another run of the same class.\n\nHow could I utilize the built in capabilities for reporting with only\nthat single class?   I am not familiar with what information is picked\nup upon compilation of the report.  Perhaps there is a way to &quot;fool&quot;\nthe software into thinking they are actually separate classes since\nthey are completely separate tests that I&#39;ve had create their own\nseparate XML output.  I am attempting to be platform independent,\nhowever, I may need to implement modifications with a shell script and\nlater duplicate similar actions in a batch script for windows.\n\nIn general, the output shows that there were a certain number of\ntests, but because the same class is used, the &lt;class&gt;.html file is\noverwritten along with other helpful output information.  This leaves\nonly the output for the last test run.\n\nIf anyone knows a good method for getting around this JUnit\nlimitation, please let me know!!!\n\nDavid\n\n\n\n",
