SqlUnit is often attractive if you\nwish to be ant-centric (doesn&#39;t require programming) and DbUnit if you\nwish to be more Java-centric.\n\nCheers, Paul.\n\nJ. B. Rainsberger wrote:\n&gt; dans wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;&gt;Is there a method to populate the database from the junit other than the \n&gt;&gt;dbunit . The junit should be such that it doesnt fail, as i am passing a \n&gt;&gt;parameter to my class method eg a telephone number and my unit test will \n&gt;&gt;be successful only if this is found in the table and if it is not in the \n&gt;&gt;table then my test fails which i want to avoid .\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; If your test uses the real database, then I don&#39;t see how you can avoid\n&gt; this situation: you need the real data to be there.\n&gt; \n&gt; If you only want to verify that your code invokes the stored procedure \n&gt; correctly, you can mock the JDBC API. This allows you to check the name \n&gt; of the stored procedure you try to invoke as well as the parameters you \n&gt; bind to it. This would avoid the need for using a real database and \n&gt; having real test data in there.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;&gt;Also if i throw a sql exception i want to test that too which i am \n&gt;&gt;unable to do right now .\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; You can fake the JDBC API to throw any SQLException and verify that your \n&gt; code correctly handles that exception.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;&gt;Can anybody through some light on this\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I discuss this in detail in Chapter 10 of _JUnit Recipes_.\n&gt; \n&gt; Good luck.\n\n\n",
