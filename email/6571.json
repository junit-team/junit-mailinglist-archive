So far I have used Ant<br/>\nto write test-scipts (based on the command line interface for my <br/>\napplication). Of course, these test are not really unit tests, but <br/>\napplication tests. Nevertheless, they are very useful.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy question is therefore, does anybody have any ideas about <br/>\nconverting already existing Ant based tests to JUnit?<br/>\n<br/>\nBasically, I am using some Ant functionality to copy directories <br/>\nfiles, call javac, and define some properties. I wouldn&#39;t like to <br/>\nrewrite all the scripts in Java, but calling Ant from JUnit turns out <br/>\nto be a bit ackward as well. Are there any other tools I might want <br/>\nto use?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for any help.</div>",
