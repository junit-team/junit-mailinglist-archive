However, for commercial software development, is this<br/>\nstill possible ?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough I knew JUnit and other JUnit-based open-source tools for a<br/>\ncouple of years, my company and team never really enbrace it. The<br/>\nmajor reason is Product Managers always want to add cool features to<br/>\nthe system quickly while programmers find the schedule is always too<br/>\ntight to spend any extra time to write testing. <br/>\n<br/>\nI know from the mail list and books that we can take lots of advantage<br/>\nof JUnit-based testing, I myself have no real hands-on experience on<br/>\nit. So here are my questions: <br/>\n<br/>\n* Will Junit-based testing make the project time longer or shorter ?<br/>\nAny hard statistic data ? ( Here I mean commercial project rather than<br/>\nopen-source project. )<br/>\n<br/>\n* One intersting point I found is that after Junit-based testing is<br/>\nintroduced, programmers tend to use IDE debugger much less than<br/>\nbefore.  This would save lots of time. Is that true ?<br/>\n<br/>\n* Some guys say JUnit is good for biz / util code testing. But for web<br/>\napplication development, where HTML/javascript would be root cause of<br/>\nlots of bugs, Junit is not so powerful. Any comments ? <br/>\n<br/>\n* How can I convince managers and programmers that JUnit-based is<br/>\nreally possible for commercial software development ? Any differnece<br/>\nfrom open-source projects ?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nCan some Junit gurus shed some light here ?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks, <br/>\n- Frank<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nYahoo!
