This is what I get for<br/>\n&gt; trying to be clever and concise at the same time. [1]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; assertThat(valueOf(button).isEnabled(), eventually(eq(true)));<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ...only is useful in a multi-threaded situation, in which the button<br/>\n&gt; may not be enabled the first time you check, but if you wait a while,<br/>\n&gt; it should soon become enabled.  The great thing is that this idea of<br/>\n&gt; repeatedly evaluating an expression, checking against a desired<br/>\n&gt; result, and then waiting before evaluating again is all encapsulated<br/>\n&gt; within the &quot;valueOf&quot; and &quot;eventually&quot; methods.  Once I figured this<br/>\n&gt; out, my asynchronous UI tests actually became readable.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Oh, ok, so there is a lot more at work than assertions here, and this is a<br/>\nseparate (albeit very interesting) topic from literate assertions.  I would<br/>\ndefinitely hide this kind of complexity (such as invokeLater(), join(),<br/>\netc...) in utility functions.<br/>\n<br/>\nFYI, here are a few ways you can test asynchronous code (e.g. UI or JMS)<br/>\nwith TestNG &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://beust.com/weblog/archives/000236.html\">http://beust.com/weblog/archives/000236.html</a>&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe literacy is actually secondary here, which is why I&#39;m willing to<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; live with and(greaterThan(10), lessThan(20)) when I have to [2].  The<br/>\n&gt; primary win is that the thing you&#39;re trying to assert is separated<br/>\n&gt; from the act of asserting<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m a bit confused by this, which sounds interesting, but which I can&#39;t<br/>\nconnect to your following examples:<br/>\n<br/>\n, so that you can write:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; assertThat(button, eventually(isEnabled()));  // will become enabled<br/>\n&gt; or<br/>\n&gt; assertThat(button, isEnabled());  // is now enabled<br/>\n&gt; or<br/>\n&gt; assertThat(button, not(isEnabled()));  // is disabled<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>In all these cases, it looks like both the assert and the evaluation of the<br/>\nassert are executed at the same time, can you clarify?  (maybe by explaining<br/>\nwhat eventually() really does?)<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nCédric<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
