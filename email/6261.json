(So if you modify method A.foo() and<br/>\n&gt; class B calls A.foo(), then<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; _ATest and _BTest will be executed.) This is to<br/>\n&gt; get around the problem of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; our test suite being really slow, which is<br/>\n&gt; something that I want to fix<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; but cannot (for non-technical reasons).<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; WOW!!! That sounds much better than the other<br/>\n&gt; utilities I&#39;ve been<br/>\n&gt; &gt; able to find for this, and certainly more<br/>\n&gt; feature-rich than I&#39;d have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; time to write myself. Any chance that the<br/>\n&gt; TestSuite you write would<br/>\n&gt; &gt; be available?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I wouldn&#39;t be able to release the code I wrote for<br/>\n&gt; two reasons: it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; probably copyrighted by my company, and it uses a<br/>\n&gt; lot of utility class<br/>\n&gt; code from my project (for preferences, files,<br/>\n&gt; strings, file lists, etc.).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; However, I&#39;d be happy to make a new project on<br/>\n&gt; SourceForge or something<br/>\n&gt; and create a version that isn&#39;t dependent on other<br/>\n&gt; code, especially if<br/>\n&gt; other people are interested in helping out.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have to warn you that my design is probably all<br/>\n&gt; wrong because I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; really understand the JUnit architecture yet. I<br/>\n&gt; probably should have<br/>\n&gt; created a TestCollector or something, but instead I<br/>\n&gt; created a subclass of<br/>\n&gt; TestSuite that builds the list of TestCases and<br/>\n&gt; returns them by overriding<br/>\n&gt; the testAt() and tests() methods.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Erik<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
