    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1050146453\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m beginning to wonder whether we should have separate design and<br/>\n&gt;  testing tools. This seems to be a serious source of contention among<br/>\n&gt;  programmers: we call it testing, but we mean design, and when we do<br/>\n&gt;  design, testing is a secondary consideration, and yet testing is important.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Rather than repackaging TDD and calling it BDD, hoping that Sapir-Whorf<br/>\n&gt;  will save us from our own sloppiness, maybe it&#39;s time for separate tools<br/>\n&gt;  for design and testing. I have no idea how that would work, but perhaps<br/>\n&gt;  it would help us all get along.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  So I&#39;d like a way to separate my design and testing activities when I do<br/>\n&gt;  TDD. For example, when I test-drive behavior that doesn&#39;t yet exist, I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt;  almost always designing; but when I fill in the holes by adding a test<br/>\n&gt;  for a case that should already pass, I&#39;m testing. Perhaps it would be<br/>\n&gt;  better to separate those somehow.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This seems elegant - I think there is a role for testing outside of<br/>\nTDD. In those cases I would like automated help in generating data<br/>\n(perhaps even Mocks) to test various cases. This would help test if<br/>\nstatements (they need to exist occaisonally), edge cases etc.<br/>\nBasically I want to automate as much boiler plate stuff as I can, so<br/>\nthat I can focus on the design.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<br/>\nMark Levison<br/>\n----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nBlog: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.notesfromatooluser.com/\">http://www.notesfromatooluser.com/</a><br/>\nMost Popular posts:<br/>\nScrum in a Nutshell or 5 minutes to learn Scrum<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.notesfromatooluser.com/2006/11/scrum_in_a_nuts.html\">http://www.notesfromatooluser.com/2006/11/scrum_in_a_nuts.html</a><br/>\nGetting Things Done!!!
