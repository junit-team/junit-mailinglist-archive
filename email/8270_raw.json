I&#39;ve written\na TestCase class and it has one testXXX() method and a tearDown()\noverride.  The tearDown() override does its own stuff and then calls\nsuper.tearDown().\n\nThe problem is that both the testXXX() method I wrote and the\ntearDown() method threw exceptions, and in fact, the error in\ntestXXX() was \nresponsible for the failure of tearDown().  (I know, it wasn&#39;t the most\nbulletproof test script, but it is what it is).\n\nWhat I see that might be a JUnit bug is that the error in tearDown()\ncompletely masked any output of the error thrown by testXXX(), so I\nwas led to the erroneous conclusion that testXXX() was succeeding. \nWhen I commented out the code in tearDown() that was throwing, then\nand only then could I see the error in testXXX().  \n\nIs this a feature of JUnit or a bug?\n\n\n\n",
