To me it&#39;s a bit of a hassle to get started as I didn&#39;t\nquite get it simply by reading the mini-tutorial on their web page. In\nthat tutorial I would have liked some motivation to why you have to\ninherit from a certain class in a given situation. But there are lots of\nother things I also would have liked an explaination to. Add to this\nthat it doesn&#39;t seem to have (if you know of one, please tell me) an\nactive community where you can get help, like a forum or mailing list.\nThat leaves each user pretty much alone with a small tutorial and the\nJavadoc, of course it might be enough for some people with a lot of\ntime.\n\nCould you tell us a bit more about what you have used Ejb3unit for? And\nhow you got comfortable with using it? What&#39;s your motivation for using\nit, instead changing your design and separating business logic into\nPOJO&#39;s which are called by the beans so that you&#39;re able to unit test\nthem in the normal way?\n\nBest regards,\nKent\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; jadhavajay@... 2008-01-24 07:41 &gt;&gt;&gt;\nPls. checkout http://ejb3unit.sourceforge.net \n\nThis tool allows you to unit test EJB 3.0 Entity & Session beans out\nof\ncontainer.\n\nRegards,\nAjay Jadhav\nhttp://www.divinet.co.in \n\n\nOn Jan 23, 2008 5:53 PM, Kent Larsson &lt;kent.larsson@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt;   = How do you test Java EE 5 applications =\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ve researched several JUnit extensions without finding any I like.\n&gt; How do you test your EJB components?\n&gt;\n&gt; = One possible approach without any JUnit extension =\n&gt;\n&gt; One approach I&#39;ve heard is to have the session beans as dumb\nforwarders\n&gt; of requests to normal objects. And implement the actual business\nlogic\n&gt; in normal Java classes. That way you&#39;re able to unit test your\nbusiness\n&gt; logic using a normal JUnit approach. What do you think of this\napproach?\n&gt; And do you have any sources with more information about it? What if\n&gt; there are instances of EJB stuff created inside the class? (Do we\nneed\n&gt; JMock?\n&gt;\n&gt; One example of this approach:\n&gt;\n&gt; // I guess a common interface is something you would want\n&gt; ProcessShoppingInterface {\n&gt; int methodA(int inputOne, int inputTwo);\n&gt; }\n&gt;\n&gt; // The normal class, doing some (imaginary) business logic in the\n&gt; methoA method\n&gt; // we can easily test this class using a normal JUnit test\n&gt; ProcessShoppingCartClass extends ProcessShoppingInterface {\n&gt; int methodA(int inputOne, int inputTwo) {\n&gt; int tmp = inputOne;\n&gt; for (int i=0 ; i &lt; 99 ; i++) {\n&gt; tmp += inputTwo/i;\n&gt; if (tmp &gt; 1000)\n&gt; return tmp;\n&gt; }\n&gt; return tmp * 2;\n&gt; }\n&gt; }\n&gt;\n&gt; // This is the session bean which simply forward calls to an\ninstance\n&gt; of the\n&gt; // class where the actual logic resides\n&gt; ProcessShoppingCartStatelessSessionBean extends\n&gt; ProcessShoppingInterface {&#39;\n&gt; ProcessShoppingCart normal = new ProcessShoppingCart();\n&gt; int methodA(int inputOne, int inputTwo) {\n&gt; return normal.methodA(inputOne, inputTwo);\n&gt; }\n&gt; }\n&gt;\n&gt; = Ejb3Unit =\n&gt; I have tried this a bit. But it&#39;s pretty hard to get started as the\n&gt; introductory material are sparse and doesn&#39;t give explanations about\nwhy\n&gt; certain things are used, and which alternatives we had. It might be\na\n&gt; great framework for testing, however I am having a hard time with it\nas\n&gt; I would have needed more documentation and tutorials.\n&gt;\n&gt; Have you tried it? What do you think, is it worth the hassle? Have\nyou\n&gt; got any tips on how to get started with it?\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n\n-- \nRegards,\nAjay Jadhav\nhttp://www.agileworld.net \n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n \nYahoo!
