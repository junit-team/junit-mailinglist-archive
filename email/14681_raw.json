Sounds like you have your &quot;Designer&quot; hat on. That wasn&#39;t\n&gt; what I u=\r\nnderstood to be the context of the question. &quot;How do\n&gt; I test a private met=\r\nhod&quot; is a question someone wearing their\n&gt; &quot;Tester&quot; hat would ask.\n\nI find =\r\nthat writing tests helps me a lot thinking about the design, so I&#39;m\nnot a f=\r\nan of switching my design brain off while writing tests. I&#39;m not sure\nwhy y=\r\nou would want to do that.\n\n&gt; Given that context, my mind hasn&#39;t\n&gt; changed. =\r\nIf the private method is already tested through an\n&gt; existing public method=\r\n then you don&#39;t need to do anything. In\n&gt; fact, exposing the method and wri=\r\nting an explicit test against it is\n&gt; duplication. \n\nUnless the tests of th=\r\ne already existing public method can be simplified in\nconsequence.\n\n&gt; Does =\r\nthat mean I believe Extract Class and Move Method are\n&gt; never used. Of cour=\r\nse not! But I don&#39;t think they provide a\n&gt; solution, per se, to &quot;How do I t=\r\nest a private method&quot; unless\n&gt; the context includes &quot;This wasn&#39;t developed =\r\nTDD and I don&#39;t have any\n&gt; confidence in it.&quot; \n\nI&#39;m confused, because TDD i=\r\ns much more a design practice than a testing\npractice. Anyway, I don&#39;t thin=\r\nk I proposed anything as &quot;a solution per se&quot;,\nbut said that it would be one=\r\n of the first things I&#39;d think about, and that\nI very often find that I fin=\r\nd a solution I like when I do so.\n\n&gt; Maybe I&#39;m wrong about this, but I tend=\r\n to view each of the\n&gt; refactorings as a mini-pattern: a solution to a prob=\r\nlem in a\n&gt; context. Each refactoring describes a motivation which\n&gt; include=\r\ns the context. For example, the motivation for Extract\n&gt; Class as described=\r\n in /Refactoring/ is that the class has too\n&gt; many responsibilities and has=\r\n lost cohesion. I don&#39;t see\n&gt; anything there about using the refactoring to=\r\n expose private\n&gt; methods of the class for testing. Likewise, the motivatio=\r\nn\n&gt; for Move Method doesn&#39;t include not being able to test a\n&gt; method becau=\r\nse of access restrictions.\n\nA private method that is complex enough to need=\r\n explicite testing simply is\na hint to a class that has too many responsibi=\r\nlities and has lost cohesion.\nA class that has just one responsibility is q=\r\nuite unlikely to be complex,\nlet alone have complex private methods.\n\n&gt; May=\r\nbe Martin Fowler wasn&#39;t wearing his Tester hat at the\n&gt; time. Maybe he was =\r\nand wanted to write a book about how to\n&gt; produce better designs, not about=\r\n solving problems with unit\n&gt; tests.\n\nIf I remember correctly, he put a cha=\r\npter about Code Smells in the book -\nabout hints in the code that you shoul=\r\nd refactor. Well, I think that a\nprivate method that needs explicite testin=\r\ng is such a smell.\n\n&gt; So, third maybe in a row, maybe refactorings shouldn&#39;=\r\nt\n&gt; be viewed as ways to solve problems with your the test suite?\n\nIf your =\r\ndesign is in the way while writing tests, it looks like a design\nproblem to=\r\n me. So I don&#39;t see why we should exclude refactoring as a viable\nsolution.=\r\n\n\n&gt; Or, maybe it would be an interesting topic to write an\n&gt; article on -- =\r\nhow to apply refactorings when your focus is testing\n&gt; and not design. \n\nI =\r\nreally have problems following this whole notion of &quot;focus on testing&quot; as\ns=\r\nomething that excludes thinking about design. It&#39;s just not the way I work,=\r\n\nI guess.\n\nCheers, Ilja\n\n\n",
