In particular,\n&gt; the idea to &quot;do the simplest thing that can possibly wo=\r\nrk&quot; can be\n&gt; dangerous, because sometimes, you just know where your code is=\r\n going\n&gt; and it&#39;s safe to start doing things that might not necessarily be =\r\nthe\n&gt; simplest thing at the moment but that will save you time in the near\n=\r\n&gt; future.\n\nBut sometimes I am confused with the idea to &quot;do the simplest th=\r\ning\nthat can possibly work&quot;. I lost my judgement on what is the simplest\nth=\r\ning that can possibly work,just as mentioned in this discussion.\n\nHow to ge=\r\nt good judgement?I think I no choice but more and more\nlearning and practic=\r\ne.\n\nThanks.\n\n\n",
