Are you doing this /just/ so that you can test the method by<br/>\nexternal invocation? If so then my answer is no.<br/>\n2. Is the method already tested through the public API of the class?<br/>\nIf yes then my answer is no.<br/>\n3. Does the system (code plus tests) clearly communicate everything<br/>\nthat needs to be communicated at this time? If it does then my answer<br/>\nis no.<br/>\n4. Is the flexibility and reusability that you refer to needed now or<br/>\nis it speculative? If the latter then my answer is no.<br/>\n5. Was my answer no to the previous questions and there are more<br/>\nstories needing to be implemented this iteration? Then heck no!<br/>\n<br/>\n:-)<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards,<br/>\nJim</div>",
