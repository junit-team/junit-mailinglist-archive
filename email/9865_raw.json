They are intended to be used within load tests\nbut you can use them anywhere. \n\nThe execution timer API is:\n\n// Start the timer.\nvoid start() \n\n// Return the current accumulated time in milliseconds. This does not\neffect the current accumulated time. long checkpoint() \n\n// Return the current accumulated time in milliseconds and cease\naccumulating time. long pause() \n\n// Resume accumulating time\nvoid resume()\n\n// Return the current accumulated time in milliseconds and cease\naccumulating time. \n// This simply calls pause(), however it is useful if your intention is\nto \n// communicate to the reader of the code that you are done timing. \nlong end() \n\n// Reset accumulated time to zero and cease accumulating additional time\nvoid reset() \n\n// Assert that the current execution time is outside of (greater than) a\nspecified \nvoid assertTimeOutsideOfBoundary(\n    String message, \n    long boundary)\n\n// Assert that the current execution time is within (less than or equal\nto) a specified boundary time void assertTimeWithinBoundary(\n    String message, \n    long boundary)\n\n// Assert that the current execution time is within specified start and\nend boundary times: // startBoundary &lt;= time &lt;= endBoundary void\nassertTimeWithinBounds(\n    String message, \n    long startBoundary, \n    long endBoundary)\n\n-----------------------------\nMike Silverstein\nSilverMark, Inc.\nThe Object Testing Company\nwww.javatesting.com\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Chad Woolley [mailto:lists@...] \n&gt; Sent: Thursday, November 13, 2003 1:10 PM\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: [junit] Re: performance testing\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; This is a situation where Aspect-Oriented Programming might be useful \n&gt; after all.\n&gt; \n&gt; This might be caused because the framework is doing some \n&gt; &quot;Other Stuff&quot; \n&gt; which is getting in the way of timing the actual execution \n&gt; time of the \n&gt; real work.  It may not be easy to extend the framework to get your \n&gt; numbers and still get &quot;close enough&quot; to the actual test \n&gt; execution to get \n&gt; meaningful numbers.\n&gt; \n&gt; It might turn out that the test fixture setup is obscuring the actual \n&gt; execution time of the tests.  FOr example, if the fixture setup takes \n&gt; much longer than the actual execution of the Class Under Test.  This \n&gt; would make it difficult to get meaningful numbers, since the \n&gt; variance in \n&gt; the fixture execution time would obscure the actual test performance \n&gt; numbers.\n&gt; \n&gt; In this situation, you could come up with some scheme to wrap the \n&gt; monitoring around the actual call to your Class Under Test, and avoid \n&gt; including your fixture setup in the monitoring.\n&gt; \n&gt; AOP could be well suited for this type of task, because otherwise you \n&gt; would have to duplicate this monitoring code (or at least remember to \n&gt; duplicate a call to it) in each test method.\n&gt; \n&gt; Then again, there could be a way to accomplish the same thing \n&gt; with Plain \n&gt; Old Java.  Maybe by routing all calls to the Class Under Test \n&gt; through a \n&gt; monitoring method.  This could take the class name, method \n&gt; name, and any \n&gt; params, then use some fancy reflection to invoke the method \n&gt; and gather \n&gt; the elapsed time.\n&gt; \n&gt; -- Chad\n&gt; \n&gt; Jim Dixon wrote:\n&gt; &gt; I haven&#39;t done very careful testing, but I certainly have \n&gt; noticed that \n&gt; &gt; the times reported by JUnit vary a great deal.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Running one simple set of tests just now gave me results in \n&gt; which 50% \n&gt; &gt; differences were common and more than one test took 3x as long from \n&gt; &gt; one run to the next.  So, sure, you can use JUnit for this sort of \n&gt; &gt; simple performance testing, but you should at least run the tests \n&gt; &gt; enough times to build statistical confidence in the results.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; It didn&#39;t show up in these few runs, but I believe that I \n&gt; have noticed \n&gt; &gt; before that the first test reported a much longer than \n&gt; normal time -- \n&gt; &gt; seconds rather than milliseconds.  So the order in which \n&gt; tests are run \n&gt; &gt; might introduce an effect large enough to render the \n&gt; results useless.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
