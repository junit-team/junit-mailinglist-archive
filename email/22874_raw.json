Whoever has been\n&gt; putting JUnit up on maven, I take it, hasn&#39;t been also putting up\n&gt; junit-dep?  I&#39;m sorry to say that I&#39;m very aware that a lot of people\n&gt; are indebted to the anonymous time-donor who&#39;d been keeping the maven\n&gt; repos up-to-date until several months ago.  I&#39;ve been reluctant to\n&gt; accept full responsibility for feeding a repository I neither use nor\n&gt; fully understand until some point where I was sure I could quickly\n&gt; respond to millions of users who got their junit jars auto-updated in\n&gt; a way that broke all their tests.  This might be overly cautious of\n&gt; me.\n\nHi,\n\nI use JUnit exclusively via Maven.\n\nFrom the Maven user&#39;s perspective, it would actually be for the best if\n*only* the junit-dep jar had ever been uploaded to the Maven repository\n- remember, Maven resolves dependencies, so when junit-dep is\nreferenced, it will also pull in hamcrest-core 1.1.\n\nThe issue is as follows: Maven will only put one version of any given\ngroupId+artifactId on the classpath. Since junit is present both as\njunit:junit and junit:junit-dep, it&#39;s far too easy for a project that,\nsay, depends on junit itself, and also uses jmock&#39;s junit4 integration\n(which declares a dependency on junit-dep) to end up with BOTH junit and\njunit-dep on its classpath.... potentially of different versions.\n\nPersonally, I think there&#39;s a pretty solid rationale to decide to\nback-fill the missing junit-dep uploads, and decide to never upload any\nnew versions of the junit jar with hamcrest, so that Maven users will\ngradually migrate to using a single Maven artifactId for JUnit.\n\n\nMax.\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
