We went ar=\r\nound on this. It seems\nthere\n&gt; &gt; are two\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; cases:\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; 1) I a=\r\nm throwing an exception but I want to make it more specific\nso\n&gt; &gt; I throw\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; a subclass (Exception -&gt; IllegalArgumentException). No catch\nclauses=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; care\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; about the more-specific exception. If expected is looking =\r\nfor a\nprecise\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; class, a bunch of tests will break even though the cod=\r\ne still\nworks.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve never seen an api that says &quot;when you do X, we =\r\nwill throw a\n&gt; &gt; random type of exception (though it will derive from Y)&quot;\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; I hope you have! The Liskov Substitution Principle says that I&#39;m\nallowed=\r\n\n&gt; to throw an exception I want, as long as it is an instanceof the one I\n&gt;=\r\n declare I&#39;m going to throw. This is why I don&#39;t like possibly throwing\n&gt; d=\r\nifferent exceptions in each other&#39;s inheritance tree. (I don&#39;t treat\n&gt; Runt=\r\nimeException as an instanceof Exception for the purposes of this\n&gt; line of =\r\nreasoning. To me, that was a heinous mistake on Java&#39;s part.\n&gt; They should =\r\neach extend Throwable or some other common base class.)\n\nYou can throw *new=\r\n* types of exceptions in reaction to new types of\nbehavior in different ver=\r\nsions. However, the *exact* same action should\nresult in the *exact* same t=\r\nype of exception.\n\n-- Ben\n\n\n\n\n\n",
