Examples include open <br/>\n&gt; source applications or products where the source code is the primary <br/>\n&gt; deliverable (e.g. frameworks).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think that we are talking about two different products: the final application (a jar in the Java world) and the development environment.<br/>\nThe tests code is part of the source code but not part of the final application.<br/>\nYou always can keep the tests in the cvs tree or a separate package for download.  If the customer has the knowledge to modify the code, he certainly know how to get code from a cvs tree :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n-Vladimir</div>",
