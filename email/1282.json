I kind of agree with you Ilja that if you&#39;ve got something<br/>\nthat complex, then it might indicate that it may need to be pulled out on<br/>\nits own. However I can also see that there could be plenty of situations<br/>\nwhere that would not be appropriate.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my experience most private methods are typically helper methods and not<br/>\nof the high complexity variety that Nic described. I think it would be<br/>\noverkill to test these. I have always worked to the rule of thumb that you<br/>\ntest the externally visible interfaces, and I think that is still valid for<br/>\nthe majority of cases. I accept though that there may be situations where it<br/>\nmay be beneficial to take things to a deeper level of granularity. If that<br/>\nis the case how do people do this? The only way I can think of is to use<br/>\nreflection.<br/>\n<br/>\nMatt<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Ilja Preu?<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: 23/05/01 15:00<br/>\nSubject: AW: [junit] How to test protected and private methods/ fields?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; As a specific example, say I&#39;ve got some computation that<br/>\n&gt; involves a fairly<br/>\n&gt; hairy algorithm in one place.  I probably want to encapsulate<br/>\n&gt; that algorithm<br/>\n&gt; into its own method so, e.g., I can Substitute in a new<br/>\n&gt; Algorithm later when<br/>\n&gt; someone points out that I (again) made the problem a lot<br/>\n&gt; harder than it needed<br/>\n&gt; to be.  I may well want to make that method private, though,<br/>\n&gt; as its existence<br/>\n&gt; or signature could reveal more about the internals of my<br/>\n&gt; class than I&#39;d like;<br/>\n&gt; it might, e.g., have an argument that refers to a component<br/>\n&gt; of some (private) field.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You could put the algorithm in its own class. So you could test it<br/>\nthrough<br/>\nthe public interface of the algorithm class without breaking<br/>\nencapsulation<br/>\nof the client class. Additionally you could easily use an other<br/>\nalgorithm by<br/>\njust pluging in an alternative implementation (without having to rewrite<br/>\nthe<br/>\nclient class).<br/>\n<br/>\nciao, Ilja<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!
