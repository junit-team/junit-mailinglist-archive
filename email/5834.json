Price. Starting at US$125 for a Developer License, Clover is ALOT <br/>\ncheaper than its competitors. Return On Investment is a no-brainer - <br/>\nif Clover helps you find and fix one bug that otherwise would have <br/>\nmade it into production, its easily paid for itself.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Ant integration. Because Clover plays nicely with Ant, it can be <br/>\nintegrated into your projects build scripts and run automatically, as <br/>\npart of a continuous integration effort. <br/>\n<br/>\n3. Reporting. Clover reporting is the most accurate because we parse <br/>\nyour source to produce them. This differentiates us from byte-code or <br/>\nJDPA based tools that are not always accurate in mapping back to the <br/>\nsource. Reports can be produced in XML or HTML, and (in Version 1.1, <br/>\ncoming soon) in PDF. Version 1.1 will also provide summary historical <br/>\nreporting over the lifetime of your project - Something that pointy <br/>\nheaded manager types will love to look at.<br/>\n<br/>\n4. Container friendliness. Clover will happily work with applications <br/>\nrunning inside an Application Container (eg. a J2EE server). Clover <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t care what VM you use either (as long as its 1.3 or greater).<br/>\n<br/>\nAs Scott points out, Clover uses Source-code instrumentation. This <br/>\nmeans you need to do a coverage build to measure coverage. So this <br/>\nmeans Clover isn&#39;t for everyone. As a Java Development shop, we have <br/>\ndeliberately written Clover with developers in mind.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\n-Brendan<br/>\n  <br/>\n----<br/>\nBrendan Humphreys<br/>\nLead Developer<br/>\nClover Development Team<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.thecortex.net/clover\">http://www.thecortex.net/clover</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In junit@y..., Scott Vachalek &lt;svachalek@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; You are right, the source/object approach is one<br/>\n&gt; difference.  Another is that GJTK can separate data by<br/>\n&gt; test, it&#39;s up to you whether that&#39;s important or not. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Some of the other features like runtime performance<br/>\n&gt; are more significant if you also collect coverage at<br/>\n&gt; higher levels, integration and systems level testing. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; To be honest I don&#39;t know that there would be much of<br/>\n&gt; a speed difference compared to another<br/>\n&gt; instrumentation-based solution like Clover, but the<br/>\n&gt; differences are dramatic compared to the JPDA-based<br/>\n&gt; tools.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m not in sales so I guess I&#39;ll leave it at that.  <br/>\n&gt; ;-)  Both tools are readily available for download so<br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s not hard to try them out and see which works<br/>\n&gt; better for you.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Scott<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --- Eytan Faverman &lt;shmaytan@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Andy,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; thanks for the info.
