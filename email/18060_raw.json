Thank you for caring about such things.\n\nThere are no coding standards for JUnit users. There are various\ncommunity agreed best practices, but I&#39;m not sure if they&#39;re written\ndown anywhere. The first place that I&#39;d look would be the JUnit FAQ.\nAs I look at it, it does have a section titled best practices.\n\nhttp://junit.sourceforge.net/doc/faq/faq.htm\n\nThe next thing I&#39;d do would be to use a search engine, we like Google\naround here, and I&#39;d search on keywords such as &quot;JUnit best practices&quot;\nor some such similar thing and see what you get.\n\nThe third thing that I&#39;d do would be to start cranking out test cases.\nThere is no teacher better than experience and in truth, that&#39;s how\nmany of us learned to use JUnit (rumour has it that J.B. was born\nalready knowing the deeper secrets of JUnit and that the text of JUnit\nRecipes is encoded in his DNA).\n\nA great place to start with writing JUnit tests is the Java API. Pick\nan object, String is a good candidate, and start writing tests for it.\nYou will amaze yourself with how quickly you&#39;ll get the hang of\nwriting tests by even such a simple exercise. It&#39;ll also help your\nunderstanding of the String class, and that&#39;s a good thing too.\n\nSimon\n\n-- \nsimonpeter.org | simonpeter.com | techbook.info\n\n",
