I&#39;ve noticed several similarities between the <br/>\nframework I built and JUnit and I plan to port this framework on top of <br/>\nJUnit, now I&#39;ve got some questions on the nature of JUnit that I didn&#39;t <br/>\nneed to know until now.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs the number returned by Test.countTestCases() binding? I ask because my <br/>\ncheck framework can&#39;t tell in advance how many checks it will have to do <br/>\n(it could but that would increase development effort quite a lot, and I&#39;d <br/>\nlike to avoid that). Do current TestRunners depend on a pre-defined <br/>\nstructure of the test? Another difference of my check framework to JUnit <br/>\nis that checks may again initiate checks (they provide an object to be <br/>\ntested and a central instance decides which tests to run on this object).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone got any ideas on the general design of such a beast or knows wether <br/>\nsuch a thing was already attempted on top of JUnit?<br/>\n<br/>\nregards<br/>\nJoachim Sauer<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
