If you are trying to test that you can actually create an ArrayList of your user defined type - as in your example - I would also test that you really can add an object of that type, and that you cannot add an object that is not of that type,...I don&#39;t want to test the ArrayList itself, since I trust Sun has done that, but I would want to test that it correctly recognizes what is and isn&#39;t my custom type.\n\n-------------- Original message -------------- \nFrom: Kamal Ahmed &lt;KAhmed@...&gt; \n\nHi,\nHow can we test if a &quot;new&quot; instance of an object of a certain user defined\ntype is created? e.g.\n\nreqFieldTypes = new ArrayList&lt;FieldType&gt;(fieldTypes.length);\n\nThanks,\n-Kamal.\n\n\n \n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
