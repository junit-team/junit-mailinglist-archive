Bossicard&quot; &lt;vladimir@b...&gt;<br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; Could you clarify what you mean by &quot;not need a runner&quot; and how<br/>\n </span></blockquote>that <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; influenced the design of TestResult?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; it goes something like this:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; TestResult result = new TestResult();<br/>\n&gt; TestCase test = new MyTestCase(&quot;testXYZ&quot;);<br/>\n&gt; test.run(result);<br/>\n&gt; if (result.wasSuccessful()) {<br/>\n&gt;    S.o.p(&quot;hurra!&quot;);<br/>\n&gt; }<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; no need for a TestRunner to execute the test.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>I see. The original intent was that users would write their own<br/>\nrunner-esque <br/>\ncode to run their tests.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I don&#39;t particularly like the TestResult and would replace it by<br/>\n </span></blockquote>some listener<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; architecture.  But you couldn&#39;t run a test without TestRunner like<br/>\n </span></blockquote>in the <br/>\nabove<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; example anymore.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Do you mean besides the TestListeners that can register themselves<br/>\nwith <br/>\nTestResult itself?<br/>\n<br/>\nA listener architecture is kind of what we do in SuiteRunner, in that<br/>\nyou can <br/>\nspecify multiple Reporters for a single test run, as many as you<br/>\nwant. The <br/>\nRunner app puts the specified Reporters into a DispatchReporter,<br/>\nwhich <br/>\nforwards all method invocations to each specified Reporter. The tests <br/>\nthemselves need only ever make reports to one Reporter, which in the<br/>\ncase of <br/>\nRunner, is the DispatchReporter. This is similar to registering<br/>\nmultiple <br/>\nTestListeners with TestResult, then passing a single TestResult down<br/>\ninto the <br/>\ntests.<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; &gt; if every test share the same resources, you can potentially<br/>\n </span></blockquote>have some <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; &gt; very tricky problems:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Instead of creating a fixture in the constructor and reusing it<br/>\n </span></blockquote>in each <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; test method -- hoping that testA doesn&#39;t screw up the fixture in<br/>\n </span></blockquote>a way <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; that causes testZ to fail -- you just recreate the fixture anew<br/>\n </span></blockquote>before <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; each test method.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If you recreate a fixture before each test, you&#39;re not _sharing_ a<br/>\n </span></blockquote>fixture.  The<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; problem appears when the tests truly share a fixture and when they<br/>\n </span></blockquote>rely on<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; another test&#39;s result for their execution (like in a<br/>\n </span></blockquote>create-update-delete test<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; sequence).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s true, but I still have the question: What does running each<br/>\ntest method <br/>\nin its own instance buy you that setUp and tearDown don&#39;t already buy<br/>\nyou? <br/>\nThe only advantage I can see is that you can screw up your setUp<br/>\nmethod by <br/>\nforgetting to recreate something. Running each test method in its own <br/>\ninstance shields you from any problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, is it not true that by forcing every test method into its own<br/>\ninstance, then <br/>\ntests can&#39;t share a fixture. So not only can you never encounter the<br/>\npotential <br/>\nproblems of sharing a fixture, you also aren&#39;t able to reap any<br/>\nbenefits of <br/>\nsharing a fixture. What do you usually tell people who want testB to<br/>\nuse the <br/>\nresults of testA?</div>",
