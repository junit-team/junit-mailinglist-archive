For private projects this approach is very <br/>\nusefull, and I&#39;ve used it in several projects. But for a public <br/>\nframework, I am convinced this is not the way to go.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks anyway,<br/>\n<br/>\nMartijn<br/>\n<br/>\nKevin Klinemeier wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; This is just from the hip, but if you&#39;re intending to provide new<br/>\n&gt; functionality in a &quot;similar&quot; API, you might consider this:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 1. Put your setUp and tearDown code in the TestCase.setUp() and<br/>\n&gt; tearDown() as usual.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 2. Declare your setUp() and tearDown() as final.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 3. Expose a new overridable method for clients to use.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In general, that&#39;s the approach I use when I want to allow subclasses<br/>\n&gt; to add functionality, but fear that they&#39;ll &quot;forget&quot; to call super(..).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This, of course, breaks every test currently written for your<br/>\n&gt; framework, and changes your API slightly from the very familiar JUnit<br/>\n&gt; API.  As a rebuttal (although I have no opinion either way) it isn&#39;t as<br/>\n&gt; though it&#39;s a difficult fix since your compiler will tell you<br/>\n&gt; everywhere to do it. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Alternatively, whatever functionality your test classes provide could<br/>\n&gt; simply fail with a useful message if the super.setUp() isn&#39;t called.<br/>\n&gt; Catching and reliably reporting a forgotten tearDown() call is tricker,<br/>\n&gt; though. </span></blockquote></div>",
