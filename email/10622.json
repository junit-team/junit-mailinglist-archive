It is integrated with Eclipse to use JUnit.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the upside I see that there is the knowledge that at least some <br/>\nunit testing is being done to all code. Most of the developers here <br/>\ndo not test.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the downside (my personal opinion), test-writing first or at least <br/>\nat the same time as coding is much more effective than test-writing <br/>\nafter the fact. Code written without testing in mind is not very <br/>\ntestable. I don&#39;t see how JTest can help there although the code <br/>\nstandards module would seem to help.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFor those who don&#39;t know, Parasoft&#39;s JTest is a tool to automatically <br/>\ngenerate tests for your code. It does a number of other things also.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!</div>",
