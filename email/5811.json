Martin<br/>\n           Prentice Hall, 2002 <br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/bookstore/books/AgileSoftwareDev\">http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/bookstore/books/AgileSoftwareDev</a><br/>\nelopmentPPP<br/>\n<br/>\nThis book is for the software developer in the trenches. It describes <br/>\nAgile Software Development from a practitioner&#39;s point of view. <br/>\nThrough dozens of case studies it describes and teaches the <br/>\nprinciples of object oriented software design, the patterns that <br/>\nembody those principles, and the practices that enable individuals <br/>\nand teams to use those principles. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a book of Java and C++ code -- lots of code. Every point the <br/>\nbook makes about software development it amplifies with examples in <br/>\ncode backed up with UML diagrams. What&#39;s more, the code and UML are <br/>\nnot presented in completed form -- leaving the reader to wonder how <br/>\nthey got there -- rather the code and UML are presented in stages, <br/>\nfrom humble beginnings to completed projects. By reading it, and the <br/>\naccompanying text, you will see the process of software design. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to learn UML, if you want to learn how to design <br/>\nsoftware, if you want to learn design patterns, or if you want to <br/>\nlearn the best practices of software development, this is the book to <br/>\nread. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe link above will take you to the table of contents, sample <br/>\nchapters, and other promotional material.</div>",
