RE: Test Coverage Analysis\n&gt; To ol For Junit\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; We find using simple code coverage (method entry profiling) \n&gt; is a cheap and\n&gt; easy way to double-check your tests and helps ensure you \n&gt; really did test\n&gt; everything you intended to test with your test cases. I believe Joseph\n&gt; Pelrine, possibly in this lecture\n&gt; http://oopsla.acm.org/ap/tutorials/tut66.html, mentioned \n&gt; several groups\n&gt; using XP who thought they were doing a fine job of writing \n&gt; tests, only to\n&gt; find on running their tests under a code coverage profiler \n&gt; (SilverMark&#39;s\n&gt; Test Mentor with code coverage profiling turned on), that \n&gt; they had missed a\n&gt; number of important functional variations/methods. The way I \n&gt; look at it, we\n&gt; test because we admit we are fallible. Any tool or technique \n&gt; that, when used\n&gt; properly, can help guard against that fallibility when we \n&gt; write our tests\n&gt; must be a good thing.\n&gt; \n&gt; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n&gt; Mike Silverstein, Lead Architect\tvoice:  (919) 858-8300 x29\n&gt; SilverMark, Inc.\t\t\tfax:    (919) 858-8308\n&gt; 5511 Capital Center Drive\t\tmobile: (919) 669-5906\n&gt; Suite 510, Raleigh, NC 27606\t\ttoll free: (888) 588-0668\n&gt; http://www.silvermark.com\t\tmsilverstein@...\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; &gt; From: Steve Freeman [mailto:steve@...]\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Tuesday, April 24, 2001 7:32 PM\n&gt; &gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [junit] Is coverage important?

A couple of\n&gt; &gt; projects ago we hit this number the first time we ran a coverage\n&gt; &gt; tool 3 months into the project.

RE: Test Coverage\n&gt; &gt; Analysis To ol For Junit\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Is coverage really that important?  The directive is to &quot;Test\n&gt; &gt; everything that could possibly break&quot;, not &quot;Test everything&quot;.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Unit Tests give you great benefits in productivity and quality.\n&gt; &gt; I have worked on XP teams that measured both quality and\n&gt; &gt; productivity.  Unit Testing and XP does improve both!  However,\n&gt; &gt; there comes a point where more Unit Tests only marginally\n&gt; &gt; increases quality while not increasing productivity (even\n&gt; &gt; negatively impacting productivity).  Developers should question\n&gt; &gt; the value of creating more Unit Tests.  If you are not careful,\n&gt; &gt; you can get into a &quot;Test everything&quot; mode and kill productivity.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Since Coverage metrics can lead the team to focus on &quot;Test\n&gt; &gt; Everything&quot;, it isn&#39;t a great measurement.  Instead, focus on\n&gt; &gt; &quot;things that could break&quot; and you will continue to gain both\n&gt; &gt; increased productivity and quality.   Only use Coverage tools to\n&gt; &gt; reveal something that could break.  Using coverage as a metric is\n&gt; &gt; a poor practice.  I suggest using quality metrics instead (i.e.\n&gt; &gt; number of Unit Tests and number of passing Functional Tests)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; - Greg Houston\n&gt; &gt; www.ISS.net\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; &gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
