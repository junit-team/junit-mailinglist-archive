However, if I include the optional<br/>\nstring argument, then that message is displayed in the output.<br/>\nI have a very high opinion of the Junit framework and find it hard to<br/>\nbelieve that the null message is standard behavior.  It feels so<br/>\nclunky, almost as if Junit does not check to see if the optional<br/>\nargument was passed or not.  My guess is that there&#39;s a property<br/>\nsomewhere which allows me disable the null error but I can&#39;t find it.<br/>\n My other option is to just add a string argument to all of the<br/>\nasserts in all of my unit tests (at this point, not that many although<br/>\nit would still be a pain and would probably take me at least a few hours).<br/>\nAny and all help is appreciated.</div>",
