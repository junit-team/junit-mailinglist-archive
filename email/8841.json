The JUnit test runner *I* know allows you to configure JVM<br/>\nproperties. Certainly the Ant runner does.<br/>\n   Did I miss a meeting?<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a project that depends upon other projects, both having junit tests.<br/>\nWhen I run the tests they run in the current working directory of the<br/>\nproject, and hence I access files relative to that. I could  set something<br/>\nin the JVM for one project, but that isn&#39;t the issue. The trouble comes when<br/>\nthe Eclipse junit test collector runs &quot;down&quot; into sub-projects and find and<br/>\nstart running those tests -- in a separate project. The CWD for those test<br/>\nis &quot;wrong&quot;. I&#39;d like to have the test collector ignore tests from other<br/>\nprojects (have not found a way) or somehow realize that they are in a<br/>\nseparate project, and hence run them in that project&#39;s context (i.e. CWD).<br/>\n<br/>\nregards<br/>\n<br/>\nAdam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
