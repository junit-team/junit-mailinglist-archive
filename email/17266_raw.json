But it&#39;s suffering to\nwrite JUnit cases. Because:\n1. I need to know the correct result from the other way around and sometimes\nit&#39;s hard to find another way. \n2. Database and JSP pages are difficult to JUnit test.\n3. Mock objects brings more than double efforts during the whole develop\nprocess.\n4. Exception situation is not so easy to make as JUnit claims.\n\n3 friends in 3 different companies (small size and middle size company)\ncomplain JUnit as:\n1. They planned JUnit testing firstly and they cannot keep it going. TIME\nreason?\n2. It consumes a lot of time but hard to find big problems. JUnit does find\nsmall problems as we expected.\n3. JUnit testing is not effcient enough.\n4. Best JUnit tester is the senior software developer. But senior guys hate\nto write test cases.\n5. For small company, it&#39;s really hard to choose between JUnit+develop and\ndevelop+functional testing.\n\nIs there anyone who is successful in deploying JUnit during develop as:\nJUnit + code + JUnit + code + System Testing? \n-- \nView this message in context: http://www.nabble.com/Are-you-really-using-JUnit-during-your-development--tf2039307.html#a5612073\nSent from the JUnit - User forum at Nabble.com.\n\n\n",
