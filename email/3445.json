    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1196633790\">In past situations, I&#39;ve addressed the computational problem by having a<br/>\ndecent random number library available that can generate good quality<br/>\npsuedo-random numbers from a couple of distributions. In something like<br/>\nthe permutations case, I would have static test cases that always ran in<br/>\none particular order, then I would have a testcase which would select,<br/>\nsay, one hundred additional randomly selected permutations for each test<br/>\nrun. Over the course of the project, a large portion of the problem space<br/>\nwould be tested.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the naming problem, I used log files. I wasn&#39;t using JUnit back then<br/>\n(or Java), but the framework I was using had the same problem. I logged<br/>\nthe starting seed at the beginning of the test and logged the<br/>\ninputs at the beginning of each iteration. If it failed, I could reproduce<br/>\nthe entire run in a debugger, or just copy the inputs (vectors<br/>\nrepresenting cartographic data in my case) from an iteration out of the<br/>\nlog file into a new input file to examine the failure. I also got to<br/>\ngenerating completely random data sets at some point.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, with JUnit, I have a LoggingTestCase base class that allows me to<br/>\ncollect logging information fairly easily from my testcases. I don&#39;t<br/>\nnormally rerun the same testcase with different parameters; rather, I just<br/>\nhave a loop inside the testcase. This makes a single testcase &quot;heavier&quot; in<br/>\nsome sense, but, in another sense, it doesn&#39;t. Because I have a separate<br/>\nstatic test case which verifies that the logic works in some order or<br/>\nwith the boundary cases, the  iterating testcase is only testing one<br/>\ndiscrete thing- that permutations of the same process also work.<br/>\nTypically, the iterating testcase is no more likely to fail.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Mon, 3 Dec 2001, Vladimir Bossicard wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; &gt; This argument assumes there is only one way<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to write tests and that any way that write either more or fewer tests<br/>\n&gt; &gt; is wrong.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; That was absolutely not my point (I added &quot;IMHO&quot; on purpose).  Sometimes<br/>\n&gt; writing one test is enough, sometimes writing 10,000 tests is not<br/>\n&gt; enough.  It depends on the complexity of the method you test and your<br/>\n&gt; confidence in that method.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In your case, if you have 20 statements, you have 2.43e18 possible<br/>\n&gt; permutations (let&#39;s take the simpliest case where you only permute 20<br/>\n&gt; different statements).  Maybe you will find useful to test all<br/>\n&gt; permutations (I have nothing against it), if you have 40 rules and want<br/>\n&gt; to all 8.15e47 permuations it&#39;s also fine with me.  But I don&#39;t think<br/>\n&gt; that that it&#39;s realistic to test all and every permutation, but that&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; only _my_ point of view.  If you think that you need total confidence<br/>\n&gt; and your computer is fast enough, go ahead and test every case.  I<br/>\n&gt; really don&#39;t have anything against that.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; That&#39;s simply not the case. JUnit, despite its name, is quite<br/>\n&gt; &gt; usable for writing larger scale tests and even for automating tests.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And that&#39;s what I proposed in my answer.  I simply pointed out that<br/>\n&gt; sometimes testing _all_ possibilities doesn&#39;t make (much) sense and that<br/>\n&gt; you can be reasonably confident by writing only a few tests (how many is<br/>\n&gt; *a few* is up to you).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Why not help it be a more complete framework rather than argue it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; should not grow because &quot;real&quot; unit tests wouldn&#39;t need a proposed<br/>\n&gt; &gt; enhancement?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Have I said that JUnit should not grow???  Surely not!!!  What I<br/>\n&gt; strongly think is that &quot;if there is a need, it should be addressed,<br/>\n&gt; either directly or indirectly&quot;.  &quot;Real&quot; unit tests often need more than<br/>\n&gt; the standard JUnit, and I would like to hear the problems of those users<br/>\n&gt; users more often on this newsgroup.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Our workaround to the JUnit confounding of test name with method name<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; was to make sure all of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; our assertions include a message that indicates which test<br/>\n&gt; &gt; configuration is being used.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; That was my point in another message, explaining the mean of the &quot;name&quot;<br/>\n&gt; attribute in the TestCase class.  It was simply an explanation nothing<br/>\n&gt; more.  I think that sometimes explaining the framework can be helpful,<br/>\n&gt; but it&#39;s once again my point of view :-)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -Vladimir<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nEric Vought<br/>\nChief Technical Officer - QLUE Consulting, Inc.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:evought@...\">evought@...</a> toll-free: 888-771-3538  RTP area: 919-816-9901 </span></blockquote></div>",
