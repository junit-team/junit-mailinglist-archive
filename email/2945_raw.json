We have a testcase which\nautomatically collects and organizes the log output from the\nclass-under-test. You can just tail the log file or add some\ncode to the GUI testrunner to display it. Apache/Jakarta has a nice\nlogging system. We also have our own package (http://qcijutils.qlue.com)\nwhcih includes a LoggerTestCase base class. If you use our package,\ncheck out the latest source. LoggerTestCase is not in the last binary jar.\n\nOn Mon, 15 Oct 2001, Chris Eppstein wrote:\n\n&gt; We send this kind of info to stdout on my project.
