Peo=\r\nple who are non-java/non-junit are going to make changes to the database an=\r\nd stored procedures (for many different projects).\n&gt; \n&gt; Question:\n&gt; Is ther=\r\ne an easy way for a non-java/non-junit person to, basically, one-click run =\r\nunit tests to see if changes they made will cause issues to the existing re=\r\ngression/unit tests?  The ease-of-access and results is the key/critical pa=\r\nrt, as otherwise they will just keep asking development staff to run them a=\r\nnd ask for feedback.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks for any tips/ideas/tooling!\n&gt; \n&gt; -dhartfor=\r\nd\n&gt;\n\n\n\n",
