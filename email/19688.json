Applications are how we design <br/>\nthem, purely and simply.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I think that a fair number of magic numbers and parameters would be<br/>\n&gt; easier to edit, check, and use if they were written in Java code.<br/>\n&gt; Singleton or not. Its not like editing big XML files is something you<br/>\n&gt; should do in Notepad.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is close to my point: if it&#39;s not something we can confidently <br/>\nchange without re-testing the entire application, it shouldn&#39;t be <br/>\nexternalized configuration data, it should be code. I&#39;m not convinced <br/>\nthat the choice of implementations of interfaces is configuration data. <br/>\nI think the community has lost its way on the difference between <br/>\nconfiguring applications and wiring objects together.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Just IMHO, of course.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>All opinions welcome. :)<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ.
