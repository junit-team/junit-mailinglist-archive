Unfortunately, until now my\npost w=\r\nasn&#39;t posted, so I have no source to quote. I have waited a\nwhile, but it i=\r\ns very late know so I want go to sleep. Approximate\nquote is &quot;We should def=\r\nine helper class because YourTest class must\nhave only one construtor.&quot; It =\r\nis obviously wrong. You can define\nstatic method (a function) and call it f=\r\nrom their. If you want to be\nable to overload these functions you can defin=\r\ne them as (instance)\nmethods and in @Parametrized function instantiate Your=\r\nTest using the\nonly constructor with &quot;garbage&quot; parameters. Note, that @Para=\r\nmetrized\nfunction is static, so you can&#39;t call instance method directly, yo=\r\nu\nhave to instantiate instance of this class. In your subclass you\nshould j=\r\nust instantiate your subclass instead and mechanism of\ninheritance will wor=\r\nk.\n\nIt is clearly design decision, whether to use helper class or not. You\n=\r\ncan avoid this whether by using (static) function or by using\n&quot;garbage&quot; as =\r\nparameters to your constructor. While using a helper\nclass is much &quot;cleaner=\r\n&quot; disadvantage of this approach is creation a\nhelper class.\n\n\n",
