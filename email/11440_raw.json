If there aren&#39;t many fixes that needed to be integrated, how much\nof a problem is it?\n\nPersonally, I am using JUnit for years now, both in private and big\ncommercial projects, and since 3.8.1 I never felt that it needed fixing.\nMight have something to do with the fact that I use the Eclipse\nintegration instead of the Swing Testrunner, of course...\n\n&gt;&gt; Ant is also huge and complicated, compared to JUnit.\n&gt; \n&gt; And has more uses.\n\nMore uses than core Junit, certainly. More uses than Junit + all the\navailable extensions, I am not so sure about...\n\n&gt; And yet, I have no more wrapper code for Ant than\n&gt; I have for JUnit. But you&#39;re talking technology and features here;\n&gt; I&#39;m talking about how to manage and maintain an open source project.\n\nWith all due respect, that&#39;s my general impression of this thread - that\nit&#39;s more about the philospical issues of managing an open source\nproject than about the practical implications.\n\nYou might disagree with how Junit development is managed, but I think\nuntil now it has served the community quite well. The &quot;slowness&quot; might\nwell have prevented it to become bloated with all kinds of shiny\nfeatures which now instead are available as seperate extensions...\n\nNo hard feelings, Ilja\n\n\n",
