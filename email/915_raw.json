I&#39;d already looked over much of the Jakarta \nsite and looked at the build for Ant.  I&#39;ve just signed up with ant-user.\nStefan, at first glance the &quot;Ant in Anger&quot; doc looks very good; I&#39;ll\nreread it carefully.  I didn&#39;t notice any &quot;get&quot; and &quot;commit&quot; targets \nmentioned, though.\n\nThis brings me to the point that&#39;s making it especially difficult\nfor me.  Due to circumstances beyond my control, I&#39;m trying to get\nAnt to interface with PVCS.  Why not do things the hard way?  Why\nnot try to extend something when you&#39;ve no experience using it?\nWhy not use a clumsy, proprietary source code control when a free\none is available?  &lt;sigh&gt;  I&#39;ll go back to my chore, now.\n\nThanks, sincerely,\n  George\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Stefan Bodewig [mailto:bodewig@...]\nSent: Thursday, April 05, 2001 2:45 AM\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: Re: [junit] OT: getting started with Ant\n\n\nGeorge Dinwiddie &lt;George.Dinwiddie@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; Can anyone give me pointers on getting started with Ant?\n\nI&#39;d start out with Ant&#39;s manual - reading the examples and building up\nyour own build-environments very slowly.  \n\nRecent Ant&#39;s (i.e. 1.3 and above) have a document named &quot;Ant in Anger:\nUsing Ant in a Production Environment&quot; in the docs directory, this is\nnot really something for the total beginner, but a very good reading\nfor those who have grasped the basic concepts of Ant.  You can get the\nlatest version from CVS\n&lt;http://jakarta.apache.org/cvsweb/index.cgi/~checkout~/jakarta-ant/docs/ant_\nin_anger.html?rev=1.3&content-type=text/html&gt;.\n\nFinally, join ant-user and ask questions there, I think the people\nthere are very supportive, but I&#39;m biased.\n\nCheers\n\n        Stefan\n\n\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\njunit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n \n\nYour use of Yahoo!
