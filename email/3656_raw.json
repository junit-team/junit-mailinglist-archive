I got one reply.\n\n\nGood chance it got lost.  This is a users list, so you can&#39;t expect everyone to know how\nto answer questions that are not mainstream.\n\nI know I haven&#39;t seen your question.\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; In the meantime, what else got a response?  Well, we seem to have time to respond to trivial subjects and partake\n&gt; in what is nothing short of mental masturbation and ignore substantive questions that require some effort.\n&gt; I think I have read about 30 messages about getters and setters that sounds more like a pissing contest.  And then there is the chatter about one piece of spam.  How many worthless messages did this &quot;spam&quot; generate?  Boy we nailed that one didn&#39;t we?\n\n\n\nHmmm.  That inspires people to help.  riiigghht.\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; If you need someone to chat with, get a dog.  I got one, he just doesn&#39;t know java/junit...yet.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sorry for the vent but I grow tired of groping in the dark.\n\n\nUnderstandable, maybe you should repost your question.\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks for your help.\n&gt; \n&gt; Lee Chalupa\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
