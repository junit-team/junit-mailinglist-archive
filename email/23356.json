They all have the same<br/>\n&gt;&gt; structure:<br/>\n&gt;&gt; 1. Create some test files and directories in an directory called &quot;source&quot;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; 2. Start the backup process (to backup the files/dirs in &quot;source&quot; to a<br/>\n&gt;&gt; directory called &quot;target&quot;)<br/>\n&gt;&gt; 3. Check whether all files in &quot;source&quot; exist also in &quot;target&quot;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; 4. Remove all files from the &quot;source&quot; and &quot;target&quot; directory so that the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; directories are empty for the next test.<br/>\n&gt; Is there any need to share a &#39;static&#39; directory across tests at all?<br/>\n&gt; May I suggest establishing a separate location for each test would<br/>\n&gt; ensure they don&#39;t ever clash, perhaps include the test name in the<br/>\n&gt; folder naming?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If at some point in the future your tests are run in parallel, distinct<br/>\n&gt; testing folders would support this.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Thanks for the suggestion. Sure, that is a requirement for parallel <br/>\ntesting. But i thought it should work if i have just one source and one <br/>\ntarget directory. I will get to this later if my problem can&#39;t be solved.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I suspect you have a timing issue or race conditions, so I would try and<br/>\n&gt; avoid any clashes and  aim to build a set of completely isolated tests.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Ok, i will check this. Maybe a reader-thread is not closed.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest regards,<br/>\n<br/>\nNils</div>",
