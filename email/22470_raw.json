Now Ant, Maven, and other build\n&gt; tools collect all the test classes and execute them.  Essentially, the\n&gt; usefulness of test Suites has been greatly diminished.  The problem\nthat\n&gt; the build tools answered quite nicely was the fact that manually\n&gt; maintaining the test suites can be a problem.  People routinely forget\n&gt; to add test classes to the test suites, and it&#39;s not a question of\n&gt; laziness.  It&#39;s just a question of it being that &quot;one more thing&quot; to\n&gt; remember that is so easily overlooked.\n&gt;\n&gt; The Categories test runner provides a nice extension to Suites that\ngive\n&gt; them some value again.  However, I&#39;d like to make use of them without\n&gt; explicitly listing all the classes included in the suite.\nEssentially,\n&gt; I&#39;d either like the Categories test runner to collect all the test\n&gt; classes itself and apply the category filters, or have that built into\n&gt; the main JUnit runner.  Adding support for a class collector is\n&gt; possible, and may even be preferable in today&#39;s testing.\n&gt;\n&gt; Currently some projects keep unit tests, slow tests, and installation\n&gt; tests in separate directory structures so that Ant or whatever build\n&gt; tool they choose can run them separately.  Categories will allow these\n&gt; projects to clearly mark the tests, possibly even assigning multiple\n&gt; categories to the tests.  This provides great flexibility in how\nthings\n&gt; are run.\n&gt;\n&gt; Of course, this includes corresponding support in ANT to execute the\n&gt; proper categories, or at the very least call the Categories test\nsuites\n&gt; we&#39;ve set up.  Since JUnit takes care of collecting the classes for\nus,\n&gt; it makes leveraging that support as simple as calling a single test\ncase\n&gt; which all the build tools already support.\n&gt;\n&gt; What thoughts do you have on this?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
