Perhaps a humble \n&gt; library writer might look for ways to have that answer not always be &quot;No&quot;?\n\nIf you&#39;re unsure of what to do when writing a library, it&#39;s better to do \nnothing. When in doubt, leave it out. You can always put it in again \nlater, but the opposite is not true. Do not offer people flexibility \nthey did not ask for, and may not need. Do as little as you can get away \nwith. This principle makes both the library developers&#39; and the users&#39; \nlives easier. Options are not free.\n\nIt&#39;s not as if the library is fixed in stone and nothing can ever be \nadded to it. If someone thinks of something you hadn&#39;t thought of, add \nit. But don&#39;t add just because you think someone  somewhere someday \nmight perhaps need it, even though you can&#39;t quite see how.\n\n-- \n﻿Elliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nXML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim\n\n",
