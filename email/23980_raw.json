You should turn to your test-running tool on this one, i.e.=\r\n Surefire.\n\nSurefire is your tool to organize which tests to run when and h=\r\now. JUnit is glue between Surefire and the JUnit test-classes.\n\nAbout your =\r\nproblem I think you have put yourself in a corner by trying to run all test=\r\ns in parallel in the same JVM. Even if you could use &quot;global, one-time, set=\r\nup / tear-down&quot; you still put very strict limits on what your test-classes =\r\ncan safely do and I simply don&#39;t think it is worth it.\n\nI strongly advice y=\r\nou to rethink here and configure Surefire with forkMode=3D&quot;perthread&quot;, so t=\r\nhat parallel test-executions take place in separate JVM-processes.\n\ncheers =\r\n/Henrik\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, Brett Delle Grazie &lt;bdellegrazie@...=\r\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m using JUnit 4.10 with Maven 3.0.4, Surefire 2.12.=\r\n3, JDK 1.6.0_35\n&gt; on Windows 7\n&gt; Surefire is configured with parallel=3Dmet=\r\nhods and threadCount=3D10\n&gt; For logging, I&#39;m using SLF4J to Logback, initia=\r\nlised by default method\n&gt; (i.e. configuration file logback-test.xml is on t=\r\nhe test classpath)\n&gt; \n&gt; I have an order of initialisation problem in that:\n=\r\n&gt; (1) Some unit tests test classes that use commons-logging (and logback\n&gt; =\r\nvia jcl-slf4j) but are ending up with\n&gt; Null loggers.\n&gt; (2) jcl-slf4j is no=\r\nt initialised _until_ those classes are called.\n&gt; \n&gt; If I disable paralleli=\r\nsm the code works correctly, implying an order\n&gt; of initialisation issue.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; According to the most recent FAQ on Junit.org (Section 5, #3) I could\n&gt;=\r\n use @BeforeClass and @AfterClass at the class\n&gt; level but I&#39;m talking abou=\r\nt at the global level, something that needs\n&gt; to be executed even if only a=\r\n single test is run.\n&gt; \n&gt; What is the correct method to add global, one-tim=\r\ne, setup / tear-down\n&gt; hooks? In this case they would need to execute and\n&gt;=\r\n complete (i.e. blocking) before any parallel tests are run.\n&gt; Is it simple=\r\nst to override the Runner and initialise the logging in code there?\n&gt; \n&gt; Th=\r\nanks,\n&gt; \n&gt; Best Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Brett\n&gt;\n\n\n\n",
