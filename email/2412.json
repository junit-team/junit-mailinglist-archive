    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-261920294\">Seems to me that the ideal solution is for 3rd party library<br/>\ncreators to include their unit tests as part of their library.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis not only gives more credibility to the library but also<br/>\ngives developers using the library a source for sample code.<br/>\n<br/>\nI recently used junit for the first time on a smallish project.<br/>\nThe project was a kind of communications library.  It was to<br/>\nbe used inhouse.  I gave the code to the people that were<br/>\ngoing to be using the library.  I heard nothing from them. I<br/>\nwas worried that they weren&#39;t using the library.  It turns out<br/>\nthat they didn&#39;t need me as I had junit tests and javadocs.<br/>\nThey didn&#39;t find a single bug (not that there isn&#39;t any) and<br/>\nso had no issues.<br/>\n<br/>\nJohn.<br/>\n<br/>\n----Original Message Follows----<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt;Now I had a number of problems recently that I traced not to failure<br/>\n &gt;of my code to do what I thought it should do, but rather to<br/>\n &gt;discrepancies between the behavior of plain sockets and SSL sockets.<br/>\n &gt;In other words, the SSL libraries had bugs in them.[...]<br/>\n &gt;<br/>\n &gt;So then I thought maybe what I&#39;m trying to do here isn&#39;t really Unit<br/>\n &gt;Testing. [...]<br/>\n &gt;<br/>\n &gt;In retrospect, I can come up with a characterization of the problem<br/>\n &gt;and say that I made certain assumptions about the behavior of the<br/>\n &gt;sockets API.  Given that was the case, it would have been prudent of<br/>\n &gt;me to write (very simple) test cases that verify those assumptions,<br/>\n &gt;and run them on both plain and SSL sockets.  These tests, of course,<br/>\n &gt;would be very simple, and wouldn&#39;t involve any of my product code.<br/>\n &gt;<br/>\n &gt;Presumably if I tested the assumptions correctly in both cases, then I<br/>\n &gt;wouldn&#39;t have to test my code in both of its configurations (since<br/>\n &gt;from its point of view it&#39;s not really doing anything different in the<br/>\n &gt;two different cases).<br/>\n &gt;<br/>\n &gt;Is this another form of testing (&quot;Assumption Testing&quot;)?  Or perhaps<br/>\n &gt;another way to look at it is that I&#39;m a &quot;customer&quot; of the SSL library<br/>\n &gt;provider, and I need to have my own &quot;Acceptance Test&quot; of the<br/>\n &gt;functionality that I expect it to provide?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Your tests of a third-party API are your acceptance tests of that API. If<br/>\nyou give them to the maker of the API, they can be their unit tests or their<br/>\nacceptance tests.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have found testing a third-party library to be extremely valuable...<br/>\nWhenever you get a new version of that third-party library, you can run all<br/>\nyour tests to see if the library makers have fixed known bugs, created new<br/>\nbugs, or changed assumptions....<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce you are confident of the third-party library&#39;s functionality, you could<br/>\nchoose to use Mock objects in the production code unit tests, or continue to<br/>\nuse the actual library objects.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp\">http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp</a></div>",
