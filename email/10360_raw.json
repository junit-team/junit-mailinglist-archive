Although it is usually wise to set up each individually test and this is why setUp and tearDown are so handy.  \n\nHowever, it you really want to re-use an object throughout your tests create them in the constructor.  The class that your tests are in will only be instantiated ONCE by the test framework.  Therefore, if you want to create an object X once and re-use it in all your tests you can do something like this:\n\nclass YourTests extends TestCase\n{\n    public YourTests(String name)\n    {    \n        super(name);\n        // YOUR SET UP CODE HERE\n        TheObjectYouWantToReUse X = new TheObjectYouWantToReUse();        \n    }    \n\n    \n    public void testXXX()\n    {\n\n    }\n}\n\nJames Dobson\n\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: rb \n  To: junit@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Saturday, January 31, 2004 1:05 AM\n  Subject: [junit] Re: Prob. in extending TestCase class\n\n\n  I believe that is normal, with or without extending: setUp and \n  tearDown get called for every test method. Makes sense conceptually \n  if you think about it: each method is an entire test unto itself, and \n  so needs its own setup.\n  r:b:\n\n  --- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;joshi_pranav_p&quot; &lt;pranav_p_joshi@i...&gt; \n  wrote:\n  &gt; Hi,\n  &gt;    I am using Junit Framwork for Testing our java product. we have \n  &gt; created 5 testXXX method to test diff. functionality. for all the \n  &gt; method some API call is required,that we have difine in setUp() \n  which \n  &gt; is same for all 5 testXXX method. now whenever i run the case It \n  &gt; create 5 diff. object of the class and it is calling 5 time setUp() \n  &gt; method for each textXXX call. \n  &gt; \n  &gt; Can we do it in single call ?
