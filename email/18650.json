QA wants to run some<br/>\ntests, I guess, more functional than unit test... and a senior colleague<br/>\nhas suggested to me to use JUnit. I have never written any test for QA<br/>\nbefore and I don&#39;t know what tool is better out there and so I just take<br/>\nadvice from the person who has used JUnit before and highly recommend<br/>\nit. As for testing subset of the tests, it&#39;s just an option, when they<br/>\nwant to check something specifically and not have to test the whole suit<br/>\n(for example, some tests fail and they need to re-test only those with<br/>\ndifferent parameters on another run). <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nVietchau<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>] On Behalf Of<br/>\nMike Bria<br/>\nSent: Thursday, January 04, 2007 4:17 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [junit] how to skip a test at runtime<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nHi Vietchau --<br/>\n<br/>\nI have no further suggestions about the techniques to use to do this<br/>\n(I&#39;ve<br/>\ndone what David suggests when I needed such support)<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a different note though, my I ask about the following:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; I need to create unit tests for QA and they require an option to<br/>\n </span></blockquote>select<br/>\nwhich test to run at runtime.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m curious about how (why?) &quot;QA&quot; is using JUnit tests.<br/>\n<br/>\nTypically (although certainly not by rule), JUnit tests are used more<br/>\nfor<br/>\n&quot;programmer tests&quot;, most often unit (or even &quot;object&quot;) tests. Is this<br/>\nthe<br/>\ncase for you?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf so, what value does your &quot;QA&quot; find from these types of tests?<br/>\nAdditionally, if so, might it be a risky idea to run only select tests<br/>\nas<br/>\nopposed to the collective suite?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf not, being new to JUnit, it might be advisable for you to consider<br/>\nutilizing JUnit for this purpose. (And, in this case, there is certainly<br/>\nplenty of info available on this mailing list and even more in more<br/>\nformal<br/>\nprint that would be of great value to you)<br/>\n<br/>\nJust food for thought.
