Which is what I was objecting<br/>\n&gt; against, and also why I much prefer calling it &quot;Test-Driven Development&quot;<br/>\n&gt; (and I still think that it&#39;s something you should do whenever you can but<br/>\n&gt; you certainly don&#39;t need to do it 100% of the time to obtain well-tested<br/>\n&gt; code).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I /do/ believe that I benefit more from TDD as a design activity than <br/>\nTDD as a testing activity. The tests are a pleasant side-effect of being <br/>\nable to evaluate my microdesign as I write tests to drive it.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor macrodesign, of course, I use CRC cards as well as talking to <br/>\npeople.
