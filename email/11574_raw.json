But it&#39;s impossible and likely incorrect to compare\n&gt; those results to any other project in any way other than a purely\n&gt; statistical analysis over many, many projects.  There are far too many\n&gt; other variables involved when running the tests.\n\nWell, as just another people of anecdotal evidence, for both of the\nlargish (more than 1000 unit tests) projects I&#39;ve worked on in the last\nlitte while, we also had all of the unit tests running in 20-30 seconds.\n(The functional tests took much longer, unsurprisingly--our total test\nruntime goal was about 10 minutes, which we achieved a most of the\ntime.)\n\nOur basic development strategy was this:\n\n    1. During development, run just the specific test suite on the\n    code we were working on. (This took a few seconds.)\n\n    2. Before commit, run all unit tests. (This took 20-30 seconds.)\n\n    3. Before commit, decide which, if any, functional tests are likely\n    to be important to run, and run those. (This took 0-3 minutes.)\n\n    4. Before commit, if really worried, or the changes are widespread,\n    or whatever, do a full test run. (10 minutes)\n\nWe&#39;d ocassionally get checkins, especially by the junior developers,\nthat broke stuff that they hadn&#39;t run the test for, but it was not that\ncommon an occurance, and it was caught pretty quickly, since pretty much\neverybody was doing a few full test runs per day, anyway. It was a habit\nto do an update and kick off a full test run before lunch or a coffee\nbreak.\n\nSo we were already using an informal level system, as you can see.\nWhether it&#39;s worth the bother of formalizing this, I don&#39;t know; I\nconsider it an important part of developer training to learn how to do\nanalysis of what tests should be run, which means that I would prefer\nthat all developers are doing this themselves on a continuous basis,\neven at the expense of having to deal with the ocassional mistake.\nThat&#39;s the price of learning, after all.\n\ncjs\n-- \nCurt Sampson  &lt;cjs@...&gt;   +81 90 7737 2974   http://www.NetBSD.org\n    Don&#39;t you know, in this new Dark Age, we&#39;re all light.  --XTC\n\n",
