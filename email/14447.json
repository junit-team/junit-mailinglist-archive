You have a much larger definition of &quot;small bit of functionality&quot;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; than<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; I do ;-).  That sounds like a big chunk of an application to me.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; As I said, it was a contrived example... probably not the best.  For<br/>\n&gt; what it&#39;s worth, our application doesn&#39;t model things that way.  I was<br/>\n&gt; using our business logic in a contrived situation to attempt to make a<br/>\n&gt; point.  However, it only derailed into a critique of the code and such<br/>\n&gt; -- I&#39;ll know better next time.  The point was that asserts may exist<br/>\n&gt; within a context that are related only by the context itself.  They do<br/>\n&gt; not affect each other.  For instance, applying a CreditMemo in this case<br/>\n&gt; will change the amount of a Sale and possibly its CloseDate and Stage. <br/>\n&gt; Whether or not the resulting CloseDate was correct has no affect on<br/>\n&gt; whether or not the resulting amounts of the Sale are correct. <br/>\n&gt; Nevertheless, when applying the CreditMemo to a Sale it makes sense to<br/>\n&gt; assert for all of these things.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I thought I saw this pattern in your example:<br/>\n<br/>\narrange<br/>\nact<br/>\nassert<br/>\nact some more<br/>\nassert some more<br/>\nact some more<br/>\nassert some more<br/>\n<br/>\nIck.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I mis-saw, then ignore me happily. You already know when to do that, <br/>\nanyway. :)<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
