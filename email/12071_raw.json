Are you trying to test end to end? Are you \ntrying to test your integration with some part of the framework? Is this \na Learning Test?\n\nWhat are you afraid is broken right now?\n\n&gt; I was wondering if anyone with more experience than us is doing\n&gt; similar testing with Spring/Hibernate and how are the doing such\n&gt; testing?\n\nI have no experience, but I have ideas. You said that you want to verify \nthat data makes it to the database. Who&#39;s responsible for making sure \nthe data gets into the database? (Your code? Hibernate? WebSphere?) If \nyou still need to/want to solve this problem, then I&#39;d like to start by \nestablishing who has which responsibilities.\n-- \nJ. B.
