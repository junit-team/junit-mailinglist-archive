Its been about 5yrs since I made a significant part<br/>\nof my living from writing code. Instead I spend most of my time and effort<br/>\ncoaching and training clients on the basic Agile ideas. In the past few<br/>\nweeks I&#39;ve spent a lot of time with a client that builds Java applications.<br/>\nThis has brought me back to JUnit.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m in shock, you&#39;re discussing how to use Lambda&#39;s well when some of the<br/>\nbasic elements are hard to use correctly. Examples Categories - require a<br/>\nspecial runner and the use of suites; Parameterized Data - requires a<br/>\nspecial runner etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Categories is the worst one. The client had some slow tests that should<br/>\nbe removed from their main unit test suite and run only on nightly builds.<br/>\nOver time they want to revisit the tests, speed them up (using Fake DB and<br/>\nIn Memory streams etc). In the world of Nunit no problem we would just mark<br/>\nthem as members of the category slow and run them separately on the build<br/>\nserver. In JUnit the requirement to use suites for this capability was so<br/>\npainful that we just migrated the tests to a separate eclipse project.<br/>\nTheir parameterized tests several were missing the annotations for the<br/>\nspecial test runner. There are a number of other small details where JUnit<br/>\nmakes it a little harder than necessary to do the work.<br/>\n<br/>\nSuggestion before debating an attractive Lambda syntax, make the existing<br/>\nfeatures easy to use. In addition take NUnit for spin you might find some<br/>\ngood ideas on how to handle many of these details.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nCheers<br/>\nMark Levison<br/>\nAgile Pain Relief Consulting &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://agilepainrelief.com/notesfromatooluser\">http://agilepainrelief.com/notesfromatooluser</a>&gt;<br/>\n | Writing &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://agilepainrelief.com/notesfromatooluser/\">http://agilepainrelief.com/notesfromatooluser/</a>&gt;<br/>\nProud Sponsor of Agile Tour Gatineau Ottawa &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://goagiletour.ca/\">http://goagiletour.ca/</a>&gt; Nov<br/>\n28, Toronto &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.torontoagilecommunity.org/display/PUBLIC/Home\">http://www.torontoagilecommunity.org/display/PUBLIC/Home</a>&gt;<br/>\n 26 and Montreal &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://agilemontreal.ca/agile-tour-2012/\">http://agilemontreal.ca/agile-tour-2012/</a>&gt; 24<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
