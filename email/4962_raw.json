You could for example have some method\nthat contains most of the testing logic and it takes as a parameter a\ndataset to use.  That test method reads the dataset and inserts the test\ndata into the database, performs the appropriate tests, and then cleans out\nthe database.  Each of your actual testcase methods could then call this\nmethod, each one specifying a different dbunit dataset to use.  With dbunit\nyou can have your different datasets defined in different xml files.\n\n-Christian\n  -----Original Message-----\n  From: vibha_malhotra16_2 [mailto:vibha_malhotra16_2@...]\n  Sent: Monday, May 13, 2002 4:06 AM\n  To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n  Subject: [junit] How to create data-driven tests?\n\n\n  Hi Guys,\n\n       Are there any methods in JUnit using which one testcase can be\n  executed repeatedly with different data sets as inputs?
