So closer<br/>\n&gt; &gt; inspection of (1) I noted that I was actually wrapping a number of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; DocumentListeners to get the effect I desired - unfortunately I was<br/>\n&gt; &gt; add them in the wrong order. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You might consider<br/>\n&gt; 4) expose API to getEffectDesired() and then testGettingEffectDesired<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m probably being thick, but I am not sure what you&#39;re getting at here,<br/>\ncould you expand please?  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy confusion comes (I think) from the fact that I am trying to make my UI<br/>\n&quot;lightweight&quot; in terms of functionality embedded within it.  So from that<br/>\nviewpoint the effect I am interested in is that my edit control behaves<br/>\ncorrectly.  So the UI code becomes responsible for instantiating and using<br/>\nthis text contol.  Perhaps a better (more TDD friendly?) approach would be<br/>\nto realise that I needed a text control to be have in a certain manner and<br/>\nextract that from my UI and drive that?  Having said that I&#39;d still probably<br/>\nhave nested the construction of the DocumentListeners, so I&#39;d still end up<br/>\nwith the same quandry (albeit on a smaller scale).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; So whilst (1) on its own would have worked, I like (2) as well<br/>\n&gt; &gt; because the listener can be used in a number of different ways and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; (1) only tests a specific usage.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Another thing to consider: which is more stable, your UI or your<br/>\n&gt; backend? If the latter, esp if you expect to expose it more ways in<br/>\n&gt; future (e.g. as a service), you should definitely put more test effort<br/>\n&gt; into it--over time you will &quot;spread the overhead.&quot; But if your UI is<br/>\n&gt; more stable, and you expect to &quot;forklift-replace&quot; the current backend,<br/>\n&gt; then I might not bother.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>History has shown that, in this context, the backend is/will be more stable<br/>\n(which is another reason why I adopted the two pronged approach).</div>",
