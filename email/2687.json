You&#39;re saying to create a Properties object and then<br/>\n&quot;set&quot; the values as I want and to then process them. That would do some<br/>\nof the testing. However, I also need to make sure some mandatory<br/>\nProperties<br/>\nare there and have values assigned as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPCM (Paul Michali)<br/>\n<br/>\nCarrier Voice Gateway Business Unit (CVGBU)<br/>\nCisco Systems, Inc.<br/>\n250 Apollo Drive<br/>\nChelmsford, MA 01824<br/>\n<br/>\nPhone : (800) 572-6771 x 45817  (978) 244-5817 [direct]<br/>\nPaging: (800) 365-4578 [voice]  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pcm@...\">pcm@...</a> [email page]</div>",
