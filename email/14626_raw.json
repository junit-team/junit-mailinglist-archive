Are you going to pass all these\n&gt; parameters in the constructor, store them in a separate field and\nthen have\n&gt; each method use the particular field they need?\n\nNo, I would have seperate test classes in this instance. Yes, it&#39;s a\nlimitation, but only a mild one. Most likely, particularly if I&#39;m\nwriting a suite() method to call the constructors anyway, I&#39;d making\nthese test classes private inner classes so that I don&#39;t end up with a\ncluttered source tree.\n\n&gt; &gt; The idea that I have to have tests run in a particular \n&gt; &gt; order to get repeatability strikes me as odd as well\n&gt; \n&gt; Why would you need to do that?  We are just talking about being able\nto pass\n&gt; parameters to test methods.  The order in which these methods are\ninvoked is\n&gt; irrelevant...  right?\n\nNo.\n\nFirst, yes, I was shifting the argument a bit to counter-inituitive\nbehaviour. But I was just following you there.\n\nSecondly, if it was irrelevant, you wouldn&#39;t have the &quot;requires&quot;\nannotation (I forget exactly the semantics) in TestNG; the purpose of\nthat annotation is to ensure that _known_ requirements are done first,\nnot just to ensure that required functionality is working, but to set\nup known state.\n\nThirdly, if you&#39;ve got methods in a class that can leave state behind,\nthen you&#39;ve got an implicit ordering from side effects. As I said, I\nfind it counter intuitive that I have to be careful about side effects\nin my test cases. End of digression... though I&#39;ll be happy to\ncontinue if we spawn a new thread.\n \n&gt; &gt; Have you thought about an option like this?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; @ParameterList({ &quot;oneName&quot; }, {&quot;anotherName&quot;}, {&quot;aThirdName&quot;}) \n&gt; &gt; @Test public void testSingleString(String firstName) { ...\n&gt; &gt; }\n&gt; \n&gt; You mean defining the various values in the source itself?\n\nAs an option. Not the only option, but one available under the right\ncircumstances.\n \n&gt; No, I hadn&#39;t thought about it, but it&#39;s an intriguing idea.  My first\n&gt; reaction is that it would force me to recompile my source file\nwhenever I\n&gt; want to change or add a parameter, but I can see how a JUnit user\nwouldn&#39;t\n&gt; mind that :-)\n\nOr an Eclipse user... after all, it will recompile when I save. \n\nThe main advantage here is that if you only got a few interesting\ncases to look for, you can keep them with the source code.\nFurthermore, once I finished building the test, it&#39;s not like I&#39;m\njumping back in and editing it a lot anyway.\n\n&gt; &gt; The vast majority of times I want a parameterised test, I \n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t really want a _lot_ of parameters, but I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d \n&gt; &gt; want to muck around with defining the parameters in the XML \n&gt; &gt; either;\n&gt; \n&gt; Fair enough, I&#39;m open to hearing suggestions, but I really think\nthat you\n&gt; need a way to be able to invoke the same test class with different\nvalues\n&gt; for parameters.  How would you like to do that?\n\nAnnotations in the code _as an option_ works. Supplementing the\nexisting XML and programatic techniques.\n \n&gt; Most users simply invoke TestNG from ant or from the command line\nand they\n&gt; never write a single line of XML.\n\nUnless they start doing something fancy... ;) Of course, JUnit starts\nasking you to grow beyond the default behaviour as well, so that&#39;s a\nbit of a fallacious argument.\n\nRobert.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
