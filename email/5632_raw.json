Simply because you must have a\nstable source tree to develop (I think everyone agrees on that).  But how can\nyou tell if your tree is stable?  Some would say &quot;if it compiles&quot; but I would\nadd &quot;and if the tests pass&quot;.\n\nI would sell the &quot;continuous integration&quot; tool not as an Agile tool, but simply\nas a source tree integrity checker.  Of course don&#39;t knock on the door of your\nmanager and tell him that he has no clue, that we must go agile and that&#39;s how\nwe will go there. :-)\n\nI prefer to first use the tools and then go agile.  If you first use JUnit then\nrefactoring then continuous integration, you will IMO also become agile.  More\nslowly I agree, but IMO with less friction (if you are in an &quot;non-agile&quot;\norganization).\n\n-Vladimir\n\r\n--\nVladimir Bossicard\nwww.bossicard.com\n\n",
