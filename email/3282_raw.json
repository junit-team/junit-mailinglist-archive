Which one you chose will probably depend on which one you \nfeel most comfortable with.\n\nI find that I understand the code much better using System.out \nstatements rather than trying to find my way round existing Java \ndebuggers, which IME have found lacking. (Maybe the suggestions in \nthis thread will help me change that.)\n\n&gt; Moreover, logging debug messages at this granularity tends to \n&gt; reduce the\n&gt; readability of the code, in my experience.\n\nI agree. If you use debug output/log statements, they are there to \nperform a specific task: find a bug. Once located and exterminated, \ntheir function is over, take them out.\n\nIf you would like to document an aspect of the bug, try with an \nassertion, where appropriate. Otherwise, document it with a test case \nwhich exercises the bug. Thus, if modifying the code at a later date \nyou reinsert the bug, the test will catch this case and alert you.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; If I&#39;m the poor sod who changes the code later, I&#39;d rather have a \n&gt; set of tests\n&gt; that automatically check the results.  That&#39;s not to say logging \n&gt; warning and error\n&gt; messages aren&#39;t valuable, just that analyzing debug statements \n&gt; requires more\n&gt; effort in the long run than writing tests.\n\nAs for logging statements, these are different from debug statements. \nA debug statement will probably tell you whether you reached a \ncertain point in the code, the values of certain variables at that \npoint, in effect, for me, they take the place of the debugger. These \ndon&#39;t usually add any value later on.\n\nLogging statements are different. They are there to add information. \nYou can still have logging statements at the debug level, but they \nshould be informative, rather than just: &quot;The JVM woz &#39;ere!&quot;\n\nManuel Amago.\nmailto:mamago@...\n\n\n",
