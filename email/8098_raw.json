I am tackling each of these in turn and now that I hav=\r\ne a better layout and docs I am tackling the lack for test cases. However, =\r\nsince these are the first junit test cases I have ever written I am getting=\r\n stuck.\n\n(1) One program spawns off three threads. One thread moves files i=\r\nnto storage, a second deletes files from storage, and the third catalogs al=\r\nl existing files in the storage. The problem is that each class only expose=\r\ns the constructor and the run() method - so there is really not public faci=\r\nng methods to check. The run() goes off on its own, doing all kinds of step=\r\ns using private methods, only ending upon death.\n\tSo for example, the Mover=\r\n thread is checking for files in a given directory, if it finds a file it p=\r\narses information from the filename to find its destination, them moves the=\r\n file to that destination. Once it has finished with all of the files it sl=\r\neeps for a few minutes. I would like to check all of parsing steps, but the=\r\ny are private only.\n\n(2) A second program relies on all of its data in a MS=\r\n SQL database (connection using jdbc). Is there so way to build a fake set =\r\nof tables using junit so that when run under junit it would get data from a=\r\n set of objects instead of actually going to the database. That way I can p=\r\nrovide for my own data - both bad and good - and track those results.\n\n\n\nCh=\r\nip\n-----\nProgramming: Its not just a job - its an indenture \n\n\n",
