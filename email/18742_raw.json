Let me know if this\nmight fit with your project.  If anyone else is\ninterested please let me know as well.\n\nCheers,\n- Ole\n\n--- Kevin Lawrence &lt;kev.lawrence@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; On 1/10/07, James P.

We, at Agitar, have put a lot of effort\n&gt; into the\n&gt; verification scenario but we have not neglected the\n&gt; verification\n&gt; scenario either. We are tackling it on a number of\n&gt; fronts.\n&gt; \n&gt; One approach is similar to the approach you\n&gt; suggested where you seed\n&gt; the test generator with some known-to-be-correct\n&gt; cases. The problem\n&gt; with this approach is that, in the limit, it becomes\n&gt; easier to write\n&gt; the test manually than to prod the machine into\n&gt; finding the right\n&gt; case.  If the machine can take these suggestions and\n&gt; riff on them to\n&gt; find &#39;cases like them&#39; it becomes more interesting\n&gt; though.\n&gt; \n&gt; Another approach is one that David Saff describes in\n&gt; his &quot;The Practice\n&gt; of Theories&quot; (http://www.tiny.cc/HttFz) paper in\n&gt; which the human\n&gt; proposes hypotheses and the test generator finds\n&gt; examples that confirm\n&gt; the hypothesis or that prove it to be false.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yet another approach - my favorite - is to have the\n&gt; machine generate\n&gt; lots of examples of input-output sets and make it\n&gt; easy for a human\n&gt; reader to review them and spot inconsistencies.\n&gt; Finding smart ways of\n&gt; filtering down all the possible examples and smart\n&gt; ways of presenting\n&gt; them to the user are the two main challenges in this\n&gt; approach.\n&gt; \n&gt; Meanwhile, we think there is value in pure\n&gt; regression testing too.\n&gt; \n&gt; Kevin\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.junitfactory.com\n&gt; You send us code.
