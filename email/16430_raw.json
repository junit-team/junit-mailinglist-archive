Many of the articles there are directed towards the\nbeginn=\r\ner and will help you greatly as you learn about JUnit. There is\neven a link=\r\n on the site called &quot;Getting Started&quot; that will take you to\na page full of =\r\nuseful information for those who wish to learn to use\nJUnit.\n\nGoogle is use=\r\nful when there&#39;s something you need, but don&#39;t know what\nit is. Just type a=\r\n description in, press enter and see how much help\nit can be. I&#39;ve found qu=\r\nite a few useful things that way. Another tip\nwith Google is to search on t=\r\nhe specific error message that you have,\noften you&#39;ll find forum discussion=\r\ns about that exact error, with a\ngood chance of a solution being given as w=\r\nell.\n\nAs you learn and start having questions, you will also find the JUnit=\r\n\nFAQ very helpful. The questions that it answers really are the\nfrequent on=\r\nes that most of us had asked or wondered about and Mike\nClark does a wonder=\r\nful job of collating it. Here is a link:\n\nhttp://junit.sourceforge.net/doc/=\r\nfaq/faq.htm\n\nWhen you are ready to start asking more questions on the JUnit=\r\n mailing\nlist, please consider following all of the advice in Eric Raymond&#39;=\r\ns\nvery helpful document: &quot;How to ask questions the smart way&quot;, available\nat=\r\n his website. Here is a link:\n\nhttp://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-question=\r\ns.html\n\nAs far as books are concerned, I recommend Pragmatic Unit Testing b=\r\ny\nHunt and Thomas for beginners. JUnit recipes by Rainsberger is good\nonce =\r\nyou&#39;re past the basics. There are other good books out there, but\nthese are=\r\n my recommendations.\n\nI hope that this helps.\n\nSimon\n\n--\nwww.simonpeter.org=\r\n\n\n",
