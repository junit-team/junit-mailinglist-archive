You have to go to borders.com, click on &quot;store locator,&quot; then\nclick &quot;search inventory.&quot; Type the title and the first hit is the PDF\nversion for $9.99. I couldn&#39;t find it on amazon.com.\n\nhttp://www.bordersstores.com/search/title_detail.jsp?id=54548917&srchTerms=junit+recipes&mediaType=1&srchType=Keyword\n\nMichael.\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, Shane Mingins &lt;shanemingins@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; I tend to like a book too, although that is basically\n&gt; for ease of reading.  I bought the PDF form and print\n&gt; chapters to read on the train (a lot lighter to carry\n&gt; than a full book).  But I love the ease of use of the\n&gt; PDF to go back an find things!  \n&gt; \n&gt; Plus for me the price was great as shipping to NZ was\n&gt; free ;-)  With my last book purchase from Amazon the\n&gt; shipping cost was over half the cost of the book!  The\n&gt; price to pay for living in the best part of the world\n&gt; I s&#39;pose :-)\n&gt; \n&gt; --- Michael &lt;mkoss917@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I ordered it from Amazon on June 16 and I am still\n&gt; &gt; waiting for my copy\n&gt; &gt; to ship. Amazon says it will ship by the 22nd, if\n&gt; &gt; not, I may cancel\n&gt; &gt; the order and buy the PDF version, although I really\n&gt; &gt; like having my\n&gt; &gt; books in book form, not electronic.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Michael.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Shane Mingins\n&gt; \n&gt; shanemingins@y...\n&gt; \n&gt; please remove clothes before emailing\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \t\t\n&gt; ____________________________________________________\n&gt; Start your day with Yahoo! - make it your home page \n&gt; http://www.yahoo.com/r/hs\n\n\n\n",
