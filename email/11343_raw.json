I estimate a total of 500 people \nlistened to it - which is pretty good for a breakout technical \nsession.\n\nSince Alberto Savoia is not exactly an household name :-), I know \nthat all these people did not come for me but for the topic.  Having \nthis many people showing up for a topic with &quot;testing&quot; in the title \nwould have been unthinkable a few years back - take it from me, I \ntried it.\n\nI opened the talk with a slide giving credit, and thanks, for the \ngrowing acceptance of developer testing to Kent Beck and Eric Gamma. \nIt felt great to have an appreciative audience with whom to share my \nadmiration and respect for their contributions.  In a few years I \nbelieve that the industry will finally look back and realize that \nwhat Kent and Eric have set into motion is worthy of major official \nrecognition.\n\nOverall, I believe that the talk was well received and it&#39;s my \nunderstanding that it may be available online on the JavaOne website \nsometime soon.  \n\nAlberto\n\n\n\n",
