Extract a method that reveals intent. Vladimir\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; already did it, so let&#39;s use it.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yes, but you may not want to install a whole library for one method. :)\n&gt; &gt; If that&#39;s all you want out of it, why use it.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Today, you use one method. Tomorrow, you find out he has all this cool \n&gt; stuff and you start using more. If you never grab it, you&#39;ll never know, \n&gt; and you&#39;ll never learn.\n\nNot true.  Use is not the only tool for knowing or learning. \nCommunication is another one.  And since Vladimir&#39;s library, for\nexample, is talked about so much on this list others will get the hint\nand take a look at it.  Word-of-mouth is generally a key motivator. \nFWIW: I have Vlad&#39;s library in use in more than 3 projects currently.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Make your own testcase\n&gt; &gt; that has that method in it, descend from that, and call it a day.  The\n&gt; &gt; method reveals intent and you don&#39;t have more classes hanging around\n&gt; &gt; that you don&#39;t use.  \n&gt; \n&gt; That&#39;s another way to do it, sure.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Granted, Vladimir&#39;s library isn&#39;t that large, but\n&gt; &gt; it is another library to have to be concerned about when it comes to\n&gt; &gt; versioning, updating, build time, etc.\n&gt; \n&gt; Agreed. That is a consideration. Still, why succumb to NIH syndrome?\n\nBecause we don&#39;t all live and work in a culture where we are free to\nchange everything.  We keep squeaking and perhaps we&#39;ll get some oil, or\nperhaps &quot;The Company&quot; will buy a new tire, at which point you just start\nall over again.  It&#39;s a wonderful cycle, actually, it drives out the\nboredom. :)\n\n-- \nJason Rogers\n\n&quot;Where there is no vision, the people perish...&quot;\nBible, Proverbs 29:18\n\n\n",
