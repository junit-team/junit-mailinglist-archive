Many people are writing tests for code that\npre-exists in a (at least mostly) concrete design.  The tests help us to\ntrack down and fix bugs, refactor mercilessly, and sometimes even *change*\nthe cast-in-stone design.\n\n-Jason R.\n\n    &gt; -----Original Message-----\n    &gt; From: Jason Tryon [mailto:jtryon@...]\n    &gt; Sent: Wednesday, July 18, 2001 8:44 PM\n    &gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n    &gt; Subject: RE: [junit] Why doesn&#39;t JUnit count asserts?\n    &gt; \n    &gt; \n    &gt; My premise is that the tests are the design, not simply \n    &gt; related thereto.  We\n    &gt; have a list of possible results of creating an order.  \n    &gt; These possible\n    &gt; outcomes determine the things we have to test.  In \n    &gt; creating the tests, we\n    &gt; create the design.  It then becomes the tests that drive \n    &gt; the design rather\n    &gt; than being a trailing afterthought to determine whether \n    &gt; we anwered the\n    &gt; requirements.\n    &gt; \n    &gt; Conventional Methodology:\n    &gt; \n    &gt;        Requirements ----&gt; Design ----&gt; Construction ----&gt; \n    &gt; Testing -- --&gt;\n    &gt; Delivery\n    &gt;                             ^                             \n    &gt;           |\n    &gt;                             |-----------&lt;  Revision of \n    &gt; Design &lt;-----|\n    &gt; \n    &gt; \n    &gt; Suggested Methodology :\n    &gt; \n    &gt;        Request ----&gt; Tests ----&gt; Design ----&gt; \n    &gt; Construction -- --&gt; Delivery\n    &gt;                        ^                                     |\n    &gt;                        |---------&lt; Revision of Tests &lt;-------|\n    &gt; \n    &gt; By devising the tests before construction, a couple of \n    &gt; things are gained.\n    &gt; First, the request, tests and designs are closer together \n    &gt; in the process.\n    &gt; This improves communication and the reliability of the \n    &gt; design.  Second, the\n    &gt; tests drive the development process instead of a logical \n    &gt; design improving\n    &gt; both the quality of the design and the answer the \n    &gt; solution provides to the\n    &gt; original request.\n    &gt; \n    &gt; Regards,\n    &gt; \n    &gt; Jason Tryon\n    &gt; \n    &gt; P.S.  It&#39;s pronounced Try - on ... like to try on a hat.  :)\n    &gt; \n    &gt; -----Original Message-----\n    &gt; From: Shane Duan [mailto:sduan@...]\n    &gt; Sent: Wednesday, July 18, 2001 11:55 AM\n    &gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n    &gt; Subject: Re: [junit] Why doesn&#39;t JUnit count asserts?\n    &gt; \n    &gt; \n    &gt; I would agree and also I would like to bring up a \n    &gt; couter-example to Tyron&#39;s.\n    &gt; \n    &gt; IMHO, a unit test should be closely related to the design \n    &gt; of the class.\n    &gt; Tyron&#39;s\n    &gt; exmple seems more like a black box test rather than a \n    &gt; white box one.  And a\n    &gt; unit\n    &gt; test should be a white-box test.\n    &gt; \n    &gt; So the example should be modified as the following:\n    &gt; \n    &gt; If we are talking about an Order class, a call \n    &gt; getStatus() to another layer\n    &gt; (the\n    &gt; class should be known) with specified ProductID might \n    &gt; return different\n    &gt; status,\n    &gt; PENDING (onhand and\n    &gt; not committed), COMMITTED(on hand but committed), \n    &gt; IMMINENT(on order or\n    &gt; imminent\n    &gt; arrival), PROTRACTED (protracted arrival), \n    &gt; OUT_OF_STOCK(out of stock at the\n    &gt; supplier undetermined), UNAVAILABLE.  Depending on the \n    &gt; return status of the\n    &gt; product ID, a call to Order.create() method on a Order \n    &gt; class might throw\n    &gt; create\n    &gt; an Order instance with PENDING status, a \n    &gt; ProductUnavailableException, etc.\n    &gt; \n    &gt; The point I am trying to make here is that because you \n    &gt; know about the class\n    &gt; implementation, a unit is now finer grained in UT.  The \n    &gt; language we are\n    &gt; speaking\n    &gt; in UT is programming-like rather than business like in AT.\n    &gt; \n    &gt; Jason Rogers wrote:\n    &gt; \n    &gt; &gt;\n    &gt; &gt;     &gt; I would like to hear everyones thoughts on the topic.\n    &gt; &gt;     &gt; Your point about AT&#39;s\n    &gt; &gt;     &gt; is well taken.\n    &gt; &gt;     &gt;\n    &gt; &gt;     &gt; To my way of thinking, flawed though it might be, a unit\n    &gt; &gt;     &gt; describes one\n    &gt; &gt;     &gt; scenario of one behavior.  For example, if we&#39;re talking\n    &gt; &gt;     &gt; about an ordering\n    &gt; &gt;     &gt; system, a specified product might exist in a number of\n    &gt; &gt;     &gt; states, onhand and\n    &gt; &gt;     &gt; not committed, on hand but committed, on order (imminent\n    &gt; &gt;     &gt; arrival), on order\n    &gt; &gt;     &gt; (protracted arrival), out of stock at the \n    &gt; supplier (undetermined\n    &gt; &gt;     &gt; availability) or perhaps even never available again.  A\n    &gt; &gt;     &gt; customer wanting to\n    &gt; &gt;     &gt; order that product might have patterned responses for\n    &gt; &gt;     &gt; each of these states.\n    &gt; &gt;     &gt; If the task at hand is to develop a system that will\n    &gt; &gt;     &gt; automate the response\n    &gt; &gt;     &gt; to a customer placing an order for this item, each\n    &gt; &gt;     &gt; possible state and\n    &gt; &gt;     &gt; outcome combination constitutes a unit.  Each test case\n    &gt; &gt;     &gt; contributing its\n    &gt; &gt;     &gt; behavioral rules to the design.\n    &gt; &gt;\n    &gt; &gt; I don&#39;t know, Jason.  It seems to me that unit is, for \n    &gt; all intensive\n    &gt; &gt; purposes, the class to be tested.  If all of these \n    &gt; scenarios are present\n    &gt; in\n    &gt; &gt; that one class, then they can be tested at the &quot;unit&quot; \n    &gt; level.  If the\n    &gt; &gt; scenarios are a combination of objects and their \n    &gt; interactions, I think the\n    &gt; &gt; test raises to the &quot;acceptance&quot; level.  The thing I \n    &gt; take issue with is\n    &gt; your\n    &gt; &gt; use of the term &#39;scenarios&#39;, because it conjures up ATs \n    &gt; in my mind, but\n    &gt; that\n    &gt; &gt; may just be me.\n    &gt; &gt;\n    &gt; &gt; It all comes down to what is the best way to write unit \n    &gt; tests.  Right?\n    &gt; &gt; That&#39;s a heated discussion from which I have learned to \n    &gt; stay away (for the\n    &gt; &gt; most part).  Everyone has their style and most are very \n    &gt; adamant about it.\n    &gt; &gt; There are some general principles that we can all agree \n    &gt; upon, but once\n    &gt; that\n    &gt; &gt; is done, the proofs are more or less stylistic.\n    &gt; &gt;\n    &gt; &gt; Some general principles can be found at\n    &gt; &gt; \n&lt;http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-12-2000/jw-1221-junit-2.html&gt;.  I\n&gt; don&#39;t agree with the all of the things listed there, but most of it sounds\n&gt; good and right to me.\n&gt;\n&gt; -Jason\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
