The class in question is<br/>\n<br/>\nhttps://github.com/mockito/mockito/blob/master/src/org/mockito/internal/runners/JUnit44RunnerImpl.java<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is deprecated, since the mockito maintainers are well aware that the <br/>\nJUnit4ClassRunner is deprecated.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the mockito team offers their JUnit44 runner for those people who <br/>\nwant to run the newest version of Mockito together with a pre-4.4 <br/>\nrelease of junit (for whatever reason). Post-4.4 users can just use the <br/>\nregular &#39;MockitoJUnitRunner&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith JUnit 4.12, this mockito trick won&#39;t compile anymore if I&#39;m not <br/>\nmistaken.<br/>\n<br/>\nThus, Mockito needs to ship a new release so that Mockito builds with <br/>\nthe new JUnit. That new Mockito release will likely break for older <br/>\nusers, who do not wish to upgrade their JUnit version.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think Henrik argues that this is quite common: This query, for <br/>\nexample, yields 2800 results:<br/>\nhttps://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=junit4classrunner+NOT+deprecated&type=Code&ref=searchresults<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is my understanding of the problem -- hope it helps.<br/>\n<br/>\nArie<br/>\n<br/>\nDavid Saff saff@...

Would you mind choosing one third-party runner that currently<br/>\n&gt; extends JUnit4ClassRunner, so that we can see how this choice affects<br/>\n&gt; users of that library?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;     David Saff<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On Mon, Aug 4, 2014 at 6:40 AM, hkaipe@...<br/>\n&gt; &lt;mailto:hkaipe@...&gt; [junit] &lt;junit@yahoogroups.com<br/>\n&gt; &lt;mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com&gt;&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;     __<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;     Hello<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;     I am sorry for trashing the party but I have a couple of concerns<br/>\n&gt;     that are very likely to slow down the adoption of JUnit-4.12 among<br/>\n&gt;     the providers of 3rd-party tools ...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;       --- 1) Don&#39;t remove JUnit4ClassRunner! (in package<br/>\n&gt;     org.junit.internal.runners)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;     I have developed a number of 3rd-party runnners myself and I want<br/>\n&gt;     the JUnit community to know that as a 3rd-party runner developer you<br/>\n&gt;     want the latest version of your runner to work with any version of<br/>\n&gt;     JUnit! - Otherwise the end-users (test-developers) will be less<br/>\n&gt;     likely to start using your runner because they probably don&#39;t want<br/>\n&gt;     to deal with the version-conflict hell that might raise between<br/>\n&gt;     JUnit and your 3rd-party runner.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;     A couple of good examples are the 3rd-party runners<br/>\n&gt;     MockitoJUnitRunner (from Mockito - http://mockito.org) and<br/>\n&gt;     CallbackParamsRunner (from CallbackParams - http://callbackparams.org)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;     Both runner implementations extends JUnits Runner base-class. They<br/>\n&gt;     both work as thin wrappers that hand over the main part of the<br/>\n&gt;     test-execution to whichever JUnit-runner is appropriate for the<br/>\n&gt;     JUnit-version on classpath, while they stay in the background<br/>\n&gt;     ensuring that their intended features are magically appended on the<br/>\n&gt;     test-execution with whichever extension points are appropriate for<br/>\n&gt;     the JUnit-version at hand.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;     In this manner the runners will work with JUnit-4.4 (or even older<br/>\n&gt;     versions) but they will also work fine with later JUnit-versions,<br/>\n&gt;     therewith allowing their end-users to upgrade JUnit separatly in<br/>\n&gt;     order to also benefit from new JUnit-features (such as JUnit-rules etc).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;     Now I do think that both of these runners will run just fine with<br/>\n&gt;     JUnit-4.12-beta-1 but their builds would fail the day they decide to<br/>\n&gt;     upgrade their JUnit dependency (e.g. if they want to leverage from<br/>\n&gt;     some new JUnit feature in 4.12). - So in the end this will slow down<br/>\n&gt;     the adoption of 4.12 in these 3rd-party projects because an upgrade<br/>\n&gt;     would force their communities to extra efforts in order to preserve<br/>\n&gt;     their backward-compatibility to older JUnit-version (such as 4.4).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;       --- 2) Please remove pull-request #625 from the release! (The<br/>\n&gt;     annotation @...)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;     I think this pull-request represents a very poor design choice that<br/>\n&gt;     - at best - might help performance only for JUnit runners that<br/>\n&gt;     executes their tests with concurrent threads. I would like to point<br/>\n&gt;     out that most smaller unit-tests do not!! - but they still suffer<br/>\n&gt;     from the same RunListener slowness that this issue is supposed to<br/>\n&gt;     address ...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;     A much better solution that would be generally beneficial to all<br/>\n&gt;     types of JUnit runners would be to offer RunListener implementors<br/>\n&gt;     some sort of concurrency API that allows RunListener implementations<br/>\n&gt;     to use assynchronous execution of the parts that might take a long<br/>\n&gt;     time. - That way it would be possible for all runners to seamlessly<br/>\n&gt;     benefit from RunListeners that have clever assynchronous concurrency<br/>\n&gt;     features!!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;     I can discuss this RunListener stuff forever but I don&#39;t really have<br/>\n&gt;     the time - so I invite other clever people to join the discussion ...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;     ---<br/>\n&gt;     BR /Henrik Kaipe<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
