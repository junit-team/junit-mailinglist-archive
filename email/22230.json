For case 1, consider...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Test A verifies that addition works correctly.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Test B verifies that multiplication works correctly by<br/>\n&gt; comparing the result of a multiplication operation to<br/>\n&gt; the result of a number of additions.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Test B &quot;depends&quot; on Test A in the sense that it requires<br/>\n&gt; functionality that is tested by Test A. However, it can<br/>\n&gt; be run independently, since Test A does not create any<br/>\n&gt; sort of state that Test B relies upon.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In the wild, this situation comes up quite frequently when<br/>\n&gt; a class under test implements equality. If equality isn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; working, lots of tests involving objects of that class will<br/>\n&gt; fail, but the real error is the one given by the test of<br/>\n&gt; equality.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, that&#39;s a good example.  I guess we could call it a layered dependency,<br/>\nwhich is similar to the connection between unit and functional tests:  in<br/>\ntheory, you really only need to have functional tests to assert that the<br/>\nsystem is working as expected, but in practice, unit tests verify that the<br/>\nsystem works at a more primitive level and they can therefore help find<br/>\nproblems faster.<br/>\n<br/>\nUsing this analogy, it looks like all functional tests should implicitly<br/>\ndepend on unit tests, since it makes little sense to run functional tests if<br/>\nthe primitive functionalities of your code base (captured by unit tests) are<br/>\nnot working correctly.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n***Cédric<br/>\n*<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
