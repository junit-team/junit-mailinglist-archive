(Note: A more\n&gt; standard call back syntax ... i.e. use preTest()/postTest() [or even\n&gt; preTestCB()/postTestCB()] to wrap setUp()/testDown() could be\n&gt; favored.)\n\n\nOnce  JUnit 4.xxx is back ported it would be possible for you to write your\nown base class implementation just as you describe.\n\nFrom experience in the .NET world there is some real advantage to declaring\ntests using Attributes/Annotation. It makes it possible to derive your\nderive your test class from some other class.\n\nThis provides a comfortable migration (learning) path for developers\n&gt; and, more importantly, provides a strategy to leverage all of the\n&gt; convenience extensions companies have built upon JUnit\n\n\nMartin it sounds like what you want is an upgraded Junit 3.8.1 with better\nsupport for fixture setup/teardown. Is that the case?\n\nWhat I want is the declarative approach for building tests (pioneered by\nNUnit, used by MBUnit and TestNG) made available to for Java 1.4.\n\nIf one prefers JavaDoc annotations you can always use TestNG.  Why\n&gt; go down that path a second time?\n\n\nBecause TestNG isn&#39;t tightly integrated into Eclipse - so not only do I have\nto sell my dev team on making the change I also have to sell build services\non the idea. I have prove that TestNG should be a another dependancy in our\nbuild chain. In addition JUnit 4 has the profile that gaurantees the support\nlibraries like JMock et al. will eventually be support it. I&#39;m not convinced\nthat TestNG has the same momentum (sorry Cedric). This is a little bit like\nthe .Net world NUnit is the leading tool with the most support, while MBUnit\nis consistently the innovator. As a result the MBUnit bend over backwards to\nbe compatible with NUnit so that tests and tools move from NUnit with no\neffort.\n\nCheers\nMark\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nBlog: http://www.notesfromatooluser.com/\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
