I needed\nto write some tests around a user belonging to a group.\n \nI needed at a minimum an implementation of IDfUser and IDfGroup. Due to the\nnature of the beast it is most common to get these from the session\n(IDfSession). As all of these are interfaces it wasn&#39;t too bad but each of\nthe interfaces extends others and have several hundred methods each. I\neventually decided that what I was trying to test in this case was\nDocumentum logic and that I should just trust the framework.\n \nAnother example is Documentum web components which are similiar in some ways\nto JSF. These extend standard Documentum classes which provide a large\namount of functionality much of which eventually ties back to a functionaing\nsql database via a custom interface and/or query language. In these cases\nthe best I could do was to test extracted business logic piecemeal.\n \nMichael Rutherfurd\n \n \n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of\nDavid Saff\nSent: Wednesday, 21 June 2006 12:05 PM\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: Mocking libraries and moving parts (was: Re: [junit] unit test case\nfor login())\n\n\n\nRutherford, Michael wrote:\n&gt; I&#39;ve looked in passing at the various mocking libraries\n&gt; and they looked interesting but again required too many &quot;moving parts&quot; to\nbe\n&gt; useful for more than trivial tests.\n\nCan you elaborate on this? I&#39;ve used mocking libraries on some rather \nnon-trivial tests, but I&#39;m willing to believe there are special features \nin Documentum&#39;s API that make it hard. I&#39;m curious what those features \nare.
