Being an enterprise application<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;       We do have large number of models and test cases to do that. each<br/>\n&gt; and every supply chain model the outputs will be different. Ofcourse we<br/>\n&gt; do have a defined testing team to test vivid usecases, models etc.. in a<br/>\n&gt; different aspects. But for a developer in the engine side I would like<br/>\n&gt; to execute a basic minimal set of unit test case and verify the same in<br/>\n&gt; the JUnit way. So that I an automate the things for the future release.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;       If I wanted to get baseline data .. then I will end up in doing<br/>\n&gt; the DAOs for all the tables and do the comparision right..<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Somewhere you have a method to invoke to execute your engine. Give it <br/>\ninput, and check the output. This is xUnit testing at its simplest. Now <br/>\nif you cannot instantiate your engine directly to be able to give it <br/>\ninput and check its output, then that is another discussion entirely, <br/>\nand we would have to get into specifics for that. I&#39;m happy to do so on <br/>\na best-efforts basis, or if you need more formal consulting, I am also <br/>\navailable for that.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
