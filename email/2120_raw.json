You assume that asserts and test cases are equal\nin their importance.  What I want to know is whether or not a test has\npassed.  You can count asserts and say that tests have passed, but you do\nnot know which ones have passed unless you have a failure/error mech. that\ntells you which have failed.  IMHO, if a test hasn&#39;t failed, it has passed.\nIf it passed, I don&#39;t need reassurance at any level that it passed.  If it\nfailed, I absolutely want to know which test failed and why (one step at a\ntime though :)!  This is by far more interesting to me than any other\nreporting mech. of the framework.  So, why count asserts?  Perhaps to give\nthat warm, fuzzy feeling... perhaps for some other reason.  My contention is\nthat I don&#39;t see it is being necessary.  I don&#39;t mind having the &quot;plug-in&quot;,\nhowever, for those cold Michigan winters when I need to get warm and fuzzy\nand don&#39;t have a fire.  :)\n\n-Jason\n\n    &gt; -----Original Message-----\n    &gt; From: Thomas Obst [mailto:thomas_obst@...]\n    &gt; Sent: Wednesday, July 25, 2001 10:53 AM\n    &gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n    &gt; Subject: Re: [junit] Reporting more then 1 failed \n    &gt; assertion per test\n    &gt; \n    &gt; \n    &gt; Why then does JUnit display the number of test cases? If \n    &gt; it is interesting to know how\n    &gt; many test cases the system has passed, then it is also \n    &gt; interesting to know how many\n    &gt; asserts have made it. This is especially true if a test \n    &gt; case is something like testMethod(),\n    &gt; where the individual asserts verify that various values \n    &gt; of the parameters to method()\n    &gt; work (max, min, null, normal, etc). Sure these could all \n    &gt; be individual test cases, but then\n    &gt; it becomes difficult to see whether I really have \n    &gt; exhaustively tested my method. Code\n    &gt; coverage is not the solution. That only tells me whether \n    &gt; what I have written, opposed to\n    &gt; what I should have written, works.\n    &gt; \n    &gt; - Tom\n    &gt; \n    &gt; Jason Rogers schrieb:\n    &gt; \n    &gt; &gt; AAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n    &gt; &gt;\n    &gt; &gt; Why do you care?  A test fails or it passes.  Period.\n    &gt; &gt;\n    &gt; &gt; If you want more, JUnit is probably not the framework \n    &gt; to use.  The framework\n    &gt; &gt; is not meant to give warm fuzzy feelings \n    &gt; (interpretation of green bar),\n    &gt; &gt; pains in the gut (interpretation of red bar), or minor \n    &gt; headaches (amber\n    &gt; &gt; bar?).  It is meant to tell you whether or not the code \n    &gt; works the way you\n    &gt; &gt; think it should.  It&#39;s a SIMPLE framework for \n    &gt; developers and testers, not a\n    &gt; &gt; bogus-meet-all-levels-of-satisfaction-and-feel-goods \n    &gt; reporting tool.\n    &gt; &gt;\n    &gt; &gt; Sorry for the outburst of frustration.\n    &gt; &gt; -Jason\n    &gt; &gt;\n    &gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----\n    &gt; &gt; From: dror2@...

When an exception is thrown, \n    &gt; &quot;the normal flow of\n    &gt; &gt; the program is interrupted and that the runtime \n    &gt; environment attempts to find\n    &gt; &gt; an exception handler--a block of code that can handle a \n    &gt; particular type of\n    &gt; &gt; error.&quot; (Java Tutorial)  So the next assertion is not executed.\n    &gt; &gt;\n    &gt; &gt; To &quot;correct&quot; that, you have to change the framework \n    &gt; (record the errors and\n    &gt; &gt; throw an exception at the end of the test method).  But \n    &gt; I really don&#39;t think\n    &gt; &gt; that this will solve problems:\n    &gt; &gt;\n    &gt; &gt;    assertTrue(obj != null);\n    &gt; &gt;   assertTrue(obj.status() == 3);\n    &gt; &gt;\n    &gt; &gt; if obj is null and you evaluate the next assert, the \n    &gt; &quot;NullPointerException&quot;\n    &gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t help much.\n    &gt; &gt;\n    &gt; &gt; -Vladimir\n    &gt; &gt;\n    &gt; &gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n    &gt; &gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n    &gt; &gt;\n    &gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
