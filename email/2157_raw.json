I can see that this will become a hot topic and there\n&gt;will be cases that several people changing it at the same time.\n[...]\n&gt;and people with different point of views trying to expose &quot;or impose&quot; their \n&gt;ideas.  I think it&#39;s a great tool and hope that people will be responsible \n&gt;and not screw up everything.\n&gt;\n&gt;So let&#39;s give it a try and see the result in a couple of weeks.\n\nExactly. Experiment and measure.\n\nI, for one, believe that everyone on this list will behave roughly according \nto this model:\n\nREPEAT:\nRead the ideas carefully.\nTry them out.\nIf your idea is clearly superior, then add something about it, possibly \nremoving what was there; otherwise, adopt the idea you just read about as \nsoon as possible/feasible.\n\nIf everyone agrees to do this, then we&#39;ll all benefit. If you can&#39;t do this, \nthen let me know so I can also skip reading your e-mails to this list.\n\nJBR.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp\n\n\n",
