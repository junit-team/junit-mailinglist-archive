If he lives in a world where all literals must be stored in a\n&gt;  &gt; constant, that&#39;s not jMock&#39;s fault. That&#39;s called &quot;tyranny&quot; and is bound\n&gt;  &gt; to bad for a number of other reasons.\n&gt; \n&gt; About keeping all literals constants I coudn&#39;t agree more. But if you\n&gt; need to use the same method over and over again it kind of bites when\n&gt; you need to change it doesn&#39;t it? So in a way you could say jMock\n&gt; forces you to do that (or search replace, or not change that many\n&gt; methods that often, or be really clever when you write your tests).\n\nIt&#39;s possible that the projects I&#39;ve been on have been small, but the \nfew times that I need to change method name strings in jMock tests, I \ndon&#39;t have to change 10 or 20 locations, but a handful--up to 5, say. \nThat could either be due to the size of the project or due to the way I \nhandle dependencies: once a method&#39;s being used 10 times, it&#39;s probably \nnamed correctly; and if it isn&#39;t, then it&#39;s probably not being used \nmuch. It could just be luck.\n\nAny way we slice it, it has not been a hardship for me. I&#39;ve not yet had \njMock force me to spend more than a couple of minutes a few times per \nproject on this problem. The flexibility it gives me far repays that \ncost. That could someday change.\n\n&gt; I think jMock tend to bite beginners a bit more than record/replay\n&gt; frameworks such as easyMock. If you are really good at test-driven\n&gt; programming, understand interaction based testing fully and know all\n&gt; your patterns and your OO-principles you will not have a big problem\n&gt; with jMock, Your test will not have that much setUp-code that the\n&gt; &quot;declarative&quot; nature is a problem.\n&gt; \n&gt; However in most projects (if not all) I have been on there have been a\n&gt; few people that are not (yet) that great at TDD or OO for that matter.\n&gt; Very few have yet seen the light when it comes to interaction based\n&gt; testing and think that it is used primarily for isolating your system\n&gt; from external systems. With that view they will use any mock-framework\n&gt; poorly. They make mistakes and learn from them same as we all have\n&gt; done. There will be tests with too complicated setup etc, they might\n&gt; not be your&#39;s but you may have to change them when refactoring\n&gt; something else...\n\nWell, naturally no tool is for everyone. I was simply pointing out some \nof CrazyBob&#39;s arguments with which I disagreed or that I thought were \nincomplete or inadequate. It was definitely not a call for the entire \nworld to stop using EasyMock and start using jMock.\n\n&gt;  &gt; Still, there&#39;s a flipside to the whole &quot;can&#39;t generate a method stub&quot;\n&gt;  &gt; argument. With EasyMock, if I use a faked or mocked method that doesn&#39;t\n&gt;  &gt; yet exist, my test can&#39;t even compile yet!\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes but I see that as a good thing, I totally don&#39;t see the problem.\n&gt; You will have compilation errors if your compiler runs automatically\n&gt; like in eclipse but that is kind of because it doesn&#39;t compile right?\n\nIf I&#39;m designing an API, and I haven&#39;t settled on a method name or \nsignature yet, it&#39;s nice that jMock doesn&#39;t force me to generate a \nmethod stub, possibly in many places (if I&#39;m adding to an existing \ninterface with several implementations) until I&#39;m sure it&#39;s what I want. \nWith jMock, I can run that test, watch it fail, think about whether I \nlike the proposed method, then and only then, add it to the interface.\n\nYes, I can run broken code in Eclipse, but I don&#39;t like running broken \ncode if I can avoid it.\n\n&gt;  &gt; When I practise TDD, I often\n&gt;  &gt; design interfaces, and forcing me to generate a method stub for a method\n&gt;  &gt; I might not even like yet is annoying.\n&gt; \n&gt; I usually create my interfaces from tests too and I think if anything\n&gt; RMock and Easymock promtes that: ctrl-space, done. If you don&#39;t like\n&gt; the method at some later �point, delete. I don&#39;t see how this can be\n&gt; annoying. You allways have the oportunity not to generate the method\n&gt; if you until you like it and whith rMock and EasyMock you can\n&gt; automatically refactor it to something you like when you know what you\n&gt; like, with jmock this is a bit harder IMHO. _I_ personally find it way\n&gt; more annying to replace all occurences of a method that I decided I\n&gt; didn&#39;t like at some point later when I know more about the system I&#39;m\n&gt; coding than I did when I created an interface.\n\nI think you misunderstand me, but it&#39;s not that important.\n\n&gt;  &gt; Keeping the methods as strings\n&gt;  &gt; allows me to write the test, compile it, and even run it before I decide\n&gt;  &gt; whether the interface or method signature is good enough to start\n&gt;  &gt; putting into stone.\n&gt; \n&gt; What does putting it into stone mean? It is not like you cannot change\n&gt; your mind once you generated your method-stub and it is not like you\n&gt; can&#39;t refactor it later (unless you&#39;re using jMock :))\n\nCompared to not having to remove anything at all, having to remove a \nmethod from an interface and 3 implementation is &quot;stone&quot;.\n\nI agree that jMock can make it slightly more expensive to rename a \nmocked method, but as I wrote above, in my practice, jMock returns that \ncost in other ways, and then some.\n\n&gt; And what is the point in running it, nothing can possibly call your\n&gt; mocks since the methods do not exist. To me this is like saying using\n&gt; only reflection instead of calling methods directly is bettter because\n&gt; you can run the code before it compiles. What am I missing, I don&#39;t\n&gt; see that any value is lost with EasyMock and rMock in this case.\n\nI like to run the test, because then I get to think about what&#39;s \nhappening when it runs. This is purely a personal point. This allows me \nto reflect on the run-time aspects of what I&#39;ve just written. After the \ntest fails and I look at the code again, I return to reflecting on the \ndesign aspects of what I&#39;ve just written. If, during that time, nothing \ntells me, &quot;This is silly! Change it!&quot; then I continue on.\n\n&gt;  &gt; As for EasyMock being more readable, EasyMock 1.x certainly wasn&#39;t. It\n&gt;  &gt; looks like EasyMock 2.0 gives jMock a run for its money, at least in the\n&gt;  &gt; easiest cases. The jury&#39;s out, since I haven&#39;t used it yet.\n&gt; \n&gt; I think that is in the eyes of the beholder. Ironically I noticed that\n&gt; a lot of people think that EasyMock is more intuitive than jMock and\n&gt; hence more readable until someone explains to them why jMock is more\n&gt; readable and then they change their mind. So which is better?\n\nThere is probably no one answer to that question. There is no question \nthat EasyMock is, well, easier. (It&#39;s in the name after all.) But \nreadability and refactorability of the code is not the only factor in \ndetermining which is better. I think you&#39;re forgotten that jMock has \nmore features and flexibility than (at least) EasyMock 1.x. (I could be \nwrong, because I haven&#39;t touched EasyMock since early 2004.)\n&lt;snip /&gt;\n-- \nJ. B.
