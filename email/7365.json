Since we currently have more than 500 test cases it is <br/>\n&gt; difficult to do this manually. It would of course be easy if the <br/>\n&gt; normal success rate was 100%, but a number of test cases fail since <br/>\n&gt; the implementation is not yet completed. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I simply keep two kind of tests in separate directories of my source <br/>\ntree. One kind is testing existing completed code, which should <br/>\nalways pass 100%. Another kind of tests are for not yet written code <br/>\nor not yet implemented behaviour. Those should fail, but less and <br/>\nless as you move more tests from failed category to completed. You <br/>\ncan watch the number of tests failing from release to release.</div>",
