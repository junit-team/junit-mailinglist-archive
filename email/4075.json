The order <br/>\ndoes not matter.<br/>\n<br/>\nI used to test create EJB, modify, save, delete and find EJBs. So <br/>\nused to resort to the above solution. I never cared about the order <br/>\nof execution.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Nilesh<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In junit@y..., scott.marshall@w... wrote:<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m currently developing JUnitEE for use with a J2EE application, <br/>\nand admit to being relatively new to J2EE and JUnit. However, I am <br/>\ngetting problems running test suites as the order of execution does <br/>\nnot appear to be constant. <br/>\n&gt; Tests are written in this order : <br/>\n&gt; testGetVehicle() <br/>\n&gt; testAddVehicle() <br/>\n&gt; testSaveVehicle() <br/>\n&gt; testDeleteVehicle() <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Overall flow is to retrieve an entity, modify it, then delete it. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Tests appear to be executed in this order : <br/>\n&gt; testDeleteVehicle() <br/>\n&gt; testGetVehicle() <br/>\n&gt; testAddVehicle() <br/>\n&gt; testSaveVehicle() <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; By running out of order the testDeleteVehicle() method cant find <br/>\nthe modified entity, and fails its test. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Using JBuilder 6, is this related to most recent changes and <br/>\ncompilation ? JUnitEE itself appears to be working fine. Any pointers <br/>\nof where to look ? <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Scott <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; Get a free, personalised email address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://another.com\">http://another.com</a><br/>\n&gt; TXT ALRT!
