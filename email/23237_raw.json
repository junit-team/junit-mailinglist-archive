And I also often prefer int=\r\nerfaces over abstract classes. But I do not always use interfaces. Interfac=\r\nes and abstract classes both have their place. It&#39;s hard to find simple rul=\r\nes to decide what to use where.\n&gt;\n&gt; I personally don&#39;t see having TestRule =\r\nas an abstract class causing a burdon for competent developers. Since TestR=\r\nule has only one method, it&#39;s very easy to use delegation to share code. Yo=\r\nu could have your Rule have many methods that delegate to another object, o=\r\nr your Rule could have a single accessor to get the delegate, or you could =\r\ncreate the Rule by calling a method on another object.\n&gt;\n&gt; In any case, wha=\r\nt we could use is data. Can someone give concrete cases were making TestRul=\r\ne an abstract class has caused problems? Let&#39;s get them out now, before 4.9=\r\n releases.\n&gt;\n&gt; -- Kevin\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In junit@yahoogroups.com, Malte Finsterwald=\r\ner &lt;malte@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I would rather use an interface and not an abst=\r\nract class.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; My reasoning:\n&gt;&gt; I see the tradeoff between:\n&gt;&gt; Give the =\r\nmost power and flexibility to the competent programmer that\n&gt;&gt; knows what h=\r\ne is doing: Interface\n&gt;&gt; Prevent stupid misuse errors: Abstract class.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; I would always prefer the first solution, so I would like the\n&gt;&gt; interfac=\r\ne version much better.\n&gt;&gt; Prevent the stupid misuse through good documentat=\r\nion.
