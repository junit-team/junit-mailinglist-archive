VMErrors aren&#39;t expected to be caught, though you\n&gt; always can if you really want to.  The irony being that if you catch a\n&gt; VirtualMachineError, there&#39;s a good chance you won&#39;t be able to do\n&gt; anything to recover from it.  That is, if you&#39;re out of memory and you\n&gt; catch that error, an attempt to clean up, log a message or whatever will\n&gt; likely require memory, which you don&#39;t have, so you&#39;ll just get another\n&gt; error.\n\nNevertheless JUnit does a fine job of catching, logging, and recovering\nfrom the first stack overflow.  Presumably the stack is unwound as an\nexception handler is hunted for, freeing up stack space.  It is the\nsecond stack overflow in the same suite that causes the problem. If the\nsuite only has one error, then that suite can be run multiple times.\n\n&gt; The JVM should never crash though, in the sense of a core dump.  If it\n&gt; does, it&#39;s likely a JVM bug.\n\nThanks for the suggestion. This turned out to be correct. The\nJVM in question is JDK 1.3.1 for Windows.  Turning off compilation\n(option -Xint) eliminated the problem, as did using jview; JUnit\ncorrectly reported both errors under those circumstances.\n\nOn Thu, 14 Mar 2002, Eric Heikkila wrote:\n&gt; Kind of sounds like a non-issue.

I&#39;d prefer to see a red-line and a\nmessage.  However, you are right, it is not an issue for me.  At first I\nthought that the problem might be in the custom implementation of the Test\ninterface that I was using to bridge between JUnit and a test framework I\nam developing.  Had that been the case, I would have had an issue.  Once I\nwas able to duplicate the problem with a standard TestCase, it was clear\nthat the problem wasn&#39;t in my code, and thus not a problem for me.\nHowever the strange behaviour did suggest a bug in JUnit, which might be\nan issue of interest to those who develop JUnit.  But I should have\nthought of the possibility that it was the JVM at fault.\n\nCheers,\nTheodore Norvell\n\n\n\n",
