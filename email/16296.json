Sad, but fairly common in my opinion.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It wasn&#39;t clear to me, but that could just be my fault for not reading <br/>\ncarefully.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn that case, I would look specifically at the &quot;subclass to test&quot; <br/>\npattern in _Working Effectively with Legacy Code_. It doesn&#39;t help with <br/>\nprivate methods, but it does help with protected ones.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor private methods, invoke the method by reflection, changing the <br/>\naccessibility. There should be a recipe in _JUnit Recipes_ about it. The <br/>\ntitle is, if I remember, &quot;Test private methods if you must&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I envy people who have write access to 100% of the code they need to test,<br/>\n&gt; they don&#39;t know how easy they have it :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is an arrogant statement, but it&#39;s true. I apologize for that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI pity people who stay in a job where they don&#39;t have write access to <br/>\nthe code they need to test. They don&#39;t seem to realize how crazy that is.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
