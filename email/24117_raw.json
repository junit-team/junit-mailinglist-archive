When I push to the repo, this updates\nhttp://scalastyle.github.com/ =\r\nautomatically. Then I use jekyll to generate\nan html site which I push to h=\r\nttp://www.scalastyle.org. Thus I get exactly\nthe same site on github and ww=\r\nw.scalastyle.org.\n\nI find this works well, because I want to have the two s=\r\nites. You could\neven set up a git hook to push to www.junit.org automatical=\r\nly.\n\nIf however, you&#39;re happy with junit.github.com, then you don&#39;t need\nan=\r\nything but the git repo.\n\nMatthew Farwell.\n\n2012/11/18 Mirko Friedenhagen &lt;=\r\nmfriedenhagen@...&gt;\n\n&gt; **\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello David,\n&gt;\n&gt; did you already thing=\r\n about how to publish content? I see github\n&gt; offers a simple blogging suit=\r\ne named jekyll\n&gt; (https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages)=\r\n. Should we\n&gt; go for this?\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards Mirko\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; On Fri, Nov 16, 2012 at =\r\n5:14 PM, David Saff &lt;saff@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Summary: can you help patc=\r\nh up the github pages for JUnit to serve as the\n&gt; &gt; new home of junit.org?\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; All,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; You may have recently noticed that http://junit.org wa=\r\ns down for a few\n&gt; &gt; days, and then came back a shadow of its former self. =\r\nThat site has been\n&gt; &gt; operated and maintained by 8thlight.com for several =\r\nyears, and by Object\n&gt; &gt; Mentor before that. But it recently had a rather n=\r\nasty failure, and it&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; not clear when the content that had been hosted =\r\nonly there will come\n&gt; back.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Rather than spend a lot of effort recr=\r\neating the old situation, I&#39;d like\n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; move us to a new situation, in =\r\nwhich the team that develops JUnit is the\n&gt; &gt; same one that develops the pr=\r\nimary information sources about JUnit. Along\n&gt; &gt; those lines, I&#39;d like to g=\r\net the github pages for JUnit ready to be a\n&gt; good\n&gt; &gt; new home for junit.o=\r\nrg. These pages are hosted at\n&gt; &gt; http://kentbeck.github.com/junit. They&#39;re=\r\n currently pretty sad, but they\n&gt; &gt; can be edited by opening pull requests =\r\nagainst\n&gt; &gt; https://github.com/KentBeck/junit/tree/gh-pages. Ideally, it wo=\r\nuld be a\n&gt; &gt; visually clean single page, with a short description of what J=\r\nUnit is,\n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; links to downloads, javadoc, mailing list, and the wiki =\r\n(\n&gt; &gt; http://github.com/kentbeck/junit/wiki), which is itself incomplete, b=\r\nut\n&gt; &gt; getting better day by day as a source of user documentation.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n If anyone feels like rolling up their sleeves and give this a try, it\n&gt; wo=\r\nuld\n&gt; &gt; be a great step forward. I&#39;m out of the office all next week, but a=\r\nm\n&gt; happy\n&gt; &gt; to move quickly getting the pieces in place upon my return.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks, all,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; David Saff\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of th=\r\nis message have been removed]\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; -----------------------------=\r\n-------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
