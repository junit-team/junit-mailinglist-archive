By testing \nthis way you may find also the new bugs that you did not\nat all expect. \n\nOther reasons could be, that JUnit testrunners display \nthe errors in a standard way. You don&#39;t need to read \nonly the stack-traces from your display.\n\nregagds\nKaarle Kaila\n\n\n&gt; For example if i want to write a testcase for an EJB i\n&gt; have to write a lookup initialisation function in \n&gt; setUp() method....and write a test case function for\n&gt; each test behaviour...right?\n&gt; This i can accomoplish using plain java class which\n&gt; can execute different user defined function!!!!\n&gt; \n&gt; Now if anyone you can tell a solid reason/scenario for\n&gt; which i have to use JUnit test framework, i will be\n&gt; very much thankful...and most of the beginners can\n&gt; have a clear understanding...........\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanx and Regards, \n&gt; Venky\n&gt; \n&gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; Make a great connection at Yahoo!
