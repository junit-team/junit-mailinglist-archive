When I run under\n&gt;junit, it can&#39;t find some org.xml classes.  When I run standalone I\n&gt;have no problems.\n&gt;\n&gt;If anyone knows why, I&#39;d love to find out.\n&gt;\n&gt;--- In junit@y..., Anthony  Pereira &lt;apereira@3...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Hi,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m not sure whether this is the place to submit what I&#39;m just\n&gt;going to\n&gt; &gt; write about, if not please do point me in the right direction,\n&gt;cheers.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I came across a rather bizzare scenario, today using the\n&gt; &gt; junit.swingui.TestRunner in a java 1.4beta2 environment. In some of\n&gt;my code,\n&gt; &gt; I reference classes in org.w3c.dom and org.apache.crimson. Now, as\n&gt;soon as\n&gt; &gt; junit came across classes from these packages, it threw class not\n&gt;found\n&gt; &gt; exceptions. Please note that this doesn&#39;t happen in the the textui\n&gt;nor my\n&gt; &gt; own testing classes, since they are both in the classpath.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; org.w3c.dom specifically is in the rt.jar\n&gt; &gt; org.apache.crimson is a separate jar, which is on my classpath\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; After a bit of digging around in the source code, specifically in\n&gt;the\n&gt; &gt; TestCaseClassLoader, I found out about the\n&gt;junit&#92;runner&#92;exclude.properties\n&gt; &gt; file. When I added these package names to that file, things seemed\n&gt;ok, and\n&gt; &gt; those exceptions didn&#39;t take place.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; What confused me was why it didn&#39;t find the classes, even though\n&gt;they was on\n&gt; &gt; my classpath, especially the org.w3c ones which are in the rt.jar\n&gt;(with\n&gt; &gt; 1.4). Furthermore, this was only a problem when using the swingui,\n&gt;with the\n&gt; &gt; textui, it was fine.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve got it working now that I put those details in the\n&gt;exclude.properties\n&gt; &gt; file. Is this perhaps a issue with using 1.4?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Any comments or explainations?\n&gt; &gt; Thanks\n&gt; &gt; Anthony\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt;junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Your use of Yahoo!
