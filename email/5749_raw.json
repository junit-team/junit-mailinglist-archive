(Shocking! :-) So just \nbecause they throw NPE&#39;s around doesn&#39;t make that a good approach. \nSun also gave us AWT before deciding that Swing was a better idea! \n(Of course, Swing suffers from classic second system syndrome itself!)\n&gt; \n&gt; I agree that if the JavaDocs say that a NPE may be thrown, that the \ncode is performing as advertised, but I still think that an \nIllegalArgumentException is better.\n&gt; \n&gt; Simon\n\nAlso, when the code declares (i.e. in a throws clause) a certain type \nof exception, it doesn&#39;t report the exception...it consideres \nit &quot;acceptable&quot; and documented.  The @throws tag in javadoc works the \nsame way. \n \nIf none of these exist, and the developer still claims the caller is \nresponsible for the args validity, then we&#39;re approaching the realm \nof dbc which is also supported by jtest.\n\nCarson\n\n\n\n\n",
