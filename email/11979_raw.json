Using tools we know and love,\n&gt; he shows us how to automate more than jus=\r\nt our tests: he includes\n&gt; sections on building, testing, deploying and mon=\r\nitoring our software.\n&gt; Especially interesting are the presentations of Gro=\r\novy as an alternative\n&gt; to Ant buildfiles and techniques for monitoring app=\r\nlications while they\n&gt; run. Mike shows us just some of what we can automate=\r\n on a project, and\n&gt; if we did that much, we&#39;d be rather ahead of the game.=\r\n I am putting this\n&gt; in my bag for my next project, and we will use the tec=\r\nhniques the moment\n&gt; the need for automation becomes apparent. I suspect th=\r\nat will happen\n&gt; quickly. An excellent, quick read. Informative, pragmatic,=\r\n and a source\n&gt; of other good ideas.\n&gt; \n&gt; Please order your copy directly f=\r\nrom the publisher at\n&gt; \n&gt;      http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/sk/auto/\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; Take care.\n&gt; --\n&gt; J.
