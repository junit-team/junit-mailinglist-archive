And yes, I <br/>\n&gt; know there is &#39;absolute&#39; zero but ask any statistician and he will <br/>\n&gt; tell you that using ratios with our normal temperature scales is <br/>\n&gt; simply wrong.  Using ratios with time works if you are using timed <br/>\n&gt; tests and define &#39;zero&#39; as no time.  Then yes, 5 minutes is twice as <br/>\n&gt; slow as 10 minutes.  Before benchmarking make sure you have a ratio <br/>\n&gt; level variable if you want to express your results in ratios.  Then <br/>\n&gt; you must define the zero point otherwise your ratios are <br/>\n&gt; meaningless.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I was only half as slow reading this as you were writing it, but my brain<br/>\ngot twice as hot ...<br/>\n<br/>\nRon Jeffries<br/>\nwww.XProgramming.com<br/>\nThe greatest mistake we make is living in constant fear that we will make one.<br/>\n  --  John Maxwell</div>",
