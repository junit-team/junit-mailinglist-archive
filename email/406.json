Over the next<br/>\nfew weeks I&#39;m going to posting several of them for the benefit of <br/>\nanyone else who wants to use them.  I would love to hear any feedback <br/>\nyou have to give.<br/>\n<br/>\nStarting with something extremely simple:  here&#39;s a way to run all<br/>\nthe tests in your suite in random order.<br/>\n  <br/>\nWhy would you want to do this?  For one, it helps ensure that no<br/>\ntests are making assumptions about the order they&#39;re run in.  Also, <br/>\nusing RandomTestSuites inside ActiveTestSuites can help identify race <br/>\nconditions that might not have come up otherwise.  (And maybe we just <br/>\n*like* running them randomly, okay?!)<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/junit/files/RandomTestSuite.java\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/junit/files/RandomTestSuite.java</a><br/>\n<br/>\nEnjoy,<br/>\nKevin</div>",
