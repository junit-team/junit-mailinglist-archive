I was\njust looping for 50 but it stops on fail. How do I run the same test\n50 times (no need for different inputs) OR should I just script this.\n\nsecondly I want to extract some info from the test upon failure. ie\nthe sequence of moves which caused failure OR error.\nMy test case keeps track of the sequence of moves during a game, i&#39;d\nlike a hook into printing this only if the engine fails an assertion\nor spouts an error; (arrayoutofbounds) more than likely.\n\nI&#39;m a stranger to junit but no stranger to java, if some body could\njust point me in the direction of which methods of which classes to\nimplement or override i&#39;d be most grateful.\n\nAs sample output i would some thing very vaguely like\n\ntest 4/50 failed: failed sequence follows.\nA1 B2 A3 B6 A3 B4 A3 B5 A3 .....\n\ntest 44/50 failed: failed sequence follows.\nA1 B2 A1 B6 A3 B5 A3 B3 A3 .....\n\nmany thanks\n\nRob Shepherd\nUniversity of Wales, Bangor, UK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
