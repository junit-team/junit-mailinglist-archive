B. Rainsberger wrote:\n\n&gt; I think Smalltalk does this. If you want to mark methods private, you \n&gt; put them in a protocol that suggests they shouldn&#39;t be used directly. \n\nI&#39;m far from a Smalltalk expert, so if somebody is please correct me. \nHowever, that&#39;s not my understanding. What I think is the case is that \nin Smalltalk access protection is object-scoped rather than \nclass-scoped. In Smalltalk, any object can see all of its members, \nincluding members declared private in a superclass, but not the private \nmembers of its sibling objects and unrelated objects. Thus Smalltalk \nprivate is a little more like Java protected, though still not quite the \nsame thing. However, privacy is still stronger than just a suggestion.\n\n-- \n﻿Elliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nXML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim\n\n",
