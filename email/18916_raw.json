Re people running it as an \nexperiment.  I seem to remember hearing about that on the xp mailing \nlist.. For some reason I&#39;m thinking that it might have been Kay or Zhon \nJohanson(?)  I think that some team decided to make everything public \nand discovered that their tests were too coupled to their production \ncode when they started to refactor.  I don&#39;t recall whether they decided \nto make data public also.  They may have.\n\nMichael Feathers\nwww.objectmentor.com\n\n\n\n",
