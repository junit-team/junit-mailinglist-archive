Of course,\nyou might have made a batch script to run all of your tests.\nBut JUnit already has those features(ie. TestSuites)! Why make\nsomething that&#39;s already available? The next good part is that\nall of this is easily done.\n\ncf. http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/unittests.html\n\n\n&gt; For example if i want to write a testcase for an EJB i\n&gt; have to write a lookup initialisation function in \n&gt; setUp() method....and write a test case function for\n&gt; each test behaviour...right?\n&gt; This i can accomoplish using plain java class which\n&gt; can execute different user defined function!!!!\nYou have to write a lookup initialisation sequence in your\noriginal test class also, wrong? I don&#39;t see why writing a\nsetUp() method would be a pain in the neck. All you have to\ndo is split your testing method into 3 pieces. (By this I\nmean setUp(), testXxx() and tearDown().)\n\nLet&#39;s say you wanted to test two methods in a certain class.\nAnd those methods shouldn&#39;t be called with the same instance.\nOf course, you can instance it twice, but if you do this in\nyour setUp(), you don&#39;t have to worry about those things.\nOn the contrary, if you want to test one method after the\nother has been executed, all you have to do is put them on\nthe same testing method.\n\n\nGood luck!\n\n-- \nShinobu Kawai &lt;skawai@...&gt;\n\n\n",
