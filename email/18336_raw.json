Now for this new configuration creation I may need to set up the configuration constants. I am using the following constant\n\nATTR_MAIN_TYPE_NAME\nATTR_PROJECT_NAME\nATTR_SOURCE_PATH\n\nNow when I run DebugUITools.launch method nothing happens. Console prints all statement uptill this method but not after this. \n\nWhy I need to launch Junit programmatically : My program creates some junit test cases in run time workspace when I enable my plugin nature. Since these files are created at run time they do not have there respective class files in workspace. So I will call \nproject.refreshLocal(IResource.DEPTH_INFINITE, null);\nproject.build(IncrementalProjectBuilder.FULL_BUILD, null);\n\nto build and refresh the runtime workspace. \n\nMy plugin have context menu to run these generated test cases and open junit plugin. When I click this menu option it will stop at  DebugUITools.launch method.\n\nI think  one of the possible problem could be that since I  am generating test case files  at run time and not giving  eclipse control to generate class files things might messed up with the classpath. I donot have clear idea why it is not working. \n\nJunit configuration with same number of constant defined works fine if I create junit test case manually in run time workbench and then run the  DebugUITools.launch method.\n\nAny suggestion on this will be very helpful.\n\n-Neelesh\n\n\nDavid Saff &lt;saff@...&gt; wrote:                                  Neelesh,\n \n Have you tried the methods in JUnitLaunchShortcut?  Even if you can&#39;t use\n them directly, working through the source there will be a great starting\n point for more information.\n \n If that doesn&#39;t give you what you need, can you describe which method you&#39;re\n calling, what you&#39;re trying to do, and what fails?  Thanks,\n \n David Saff\n \n On 11/6/06, Neelesh Thakur &lt;neeleshthakur101@...&gt; wrote:\n &gt;\n &gt; Hi\n &gt;\n &gt; I am trying to launch the Junit launcher programmatically.
