I wa\n&gt;  looking at www.mockobjects.com, and on the right side of the page it lists\n&gt;  &quot;implementations&quot;, and for Java it says jMock, EasyMock, and rMock.\n&gt;\n&gt;  What does it mean by implementations? What standard or specification are\n&gt;  they implementing, if any?\n&gt;\n&gt;  Or are they really very different things that only use the &quot;concept&quot; of mock\n&gt;  objects, but implement it very differently?\n\nEasyMock, jMock and rMock are not implementations of any standard or\nspecification. They&#39;re implementations of the mock object pattern\nwhere you define &quot;expectations&quot; (expected interaction, method calls in\nJava) for a smart test double, which can then afterwards verify\nwhether those expectations were met.\n\n\nOn 12/13/06, lightbulb432 &lt;veerukrishnan@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;  Any advice for a beginner as to which of those three implementations to look\n&gt;  at (any difference in functionality, robustness, or any other criteria?).\n&gt;  Looking at their websites I couldn&#39;t really tell what the main differences\n&gt;  are.\n\nI&#39;ve been personally using EasyMock for a long time. The reason for me\nhaving used EasyMock has really been just that I disliked the\nstring-based approach of jMock (which doesn&#39;t work with automated\nrefactoring tools too well, not to mention modern IDE&#39;s\nauto-completion features) and rMock has just recently appeared on the\nmarket.\n\nFunctionally all of the above frameworks are almost identical so if\nyou don&#39;t have any bias towards a specific library, I&#39;d recommend\ntrying each of them out by writing a small set of tests with each\nalternative. For jMock, however, be sure to use the 2.0 branch from\ntheir Subversion repository as the API will change completely. They&#39;re\ndumping the string-based expectation setting API in the upcoming 2.0\nrelease (which Nat Pryce promised would be out real soon...).\n\n\nLasse\n\n",
