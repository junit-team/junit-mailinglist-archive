So, I have modified testA, which directly tests classA, but <br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t realize that I have broken something in testC.  My solution is <br/>\n&gt; that we run nightlybuilds, and I check the errors/failures the next <br/>\n&gt; morning to see if my code changes could have caused any of them.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It would be nice to be a little more proactive, though,...being able to <br/>\n&gt; (easily) find all the tests that are ultimately affected by my code <br/>\n&gt; change (iterating through the workspace references until I terminate at <br/>\n&gt; all classes that start with &quot;Test&quot;, or that are in my test branch).  I <br/>\n&gt; know that I can do this manually through Eclipse, but it is not fun - <br/>\n&gt; and therefore doesn&#39;t get done.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Why can&#39;t you just run all the tests?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy are there so many dependencies on class A? I would break some <br/>\ndependencies by inserting interfaces, that way, if you just make sure <br/>\nclass A continues to respect the contracts of its various interfaces, <br/>\nthen the impact is contained. That&#39;s the point of interfaces (and the <br/>\nLiskov Substitution Principle, and indeed, OOP).<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
