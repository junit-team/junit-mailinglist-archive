I am new to JUnit annotations.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I have a need to execute a set of classic account registration  \n&gt; tests:\n&gt; &gt; register a user by [email, password], verify that that succeeds,  \n&gt; then\n&gt; &gt; immediately follow this with an identical registration with the same\n&gt; &gt; [email, password], which should fail because the account already\n&gt; &gt; exists. This is a specific case of a more general scenario where the\n&gt; &gt; first test develops state the second test needs to know about.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; It occurred to me to use a single test class, containing two @Test-\n&gt; &gt; decorated methods: register() and dupRegister(). The problem with\n&gt; &gt; this structure is that I found no documentation that indicates that\n&gt; &gt; the first decorated test method is executed after the second  \n&gt; decorated\n&gt; &gt; test method. I also considered using the Parameter annotation, with\n&gt; &gt; duplicate [email, password] provided as the parameter list. While\n&gt; &gt; that could drive the tests, I see no way of indicating in this  \n&gt; scheme\n&gt; &gt; that the first test invocation should succeed, while the second  \n&gt; should\n&gt; &gt; fail.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Would someone be kind enough to sketch a reasonable, &quot;JUnit way&quot; to\n&gt; &gt; approach this.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
