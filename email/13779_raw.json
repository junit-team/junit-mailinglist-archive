For example, to a programmer the message that there&#39;s a \nstack overflow error in the resolveXInclude() method is very useful \ninformation. A competent programmer knows how to respond to that. \nHowever &quot;stack overflow&quot; is gibberish to a typical end user. They do not \nunderstand it, and they can&#39;t plausibly do anything about it. Before \npresenting the problem to an end user it should be written in language \nthey understand. In this case, that would probably be something like, \n&quot;The programmers who wrote this software screwed up. We&#39;re sorry. It&#39;s \nnot your fault. Would you like to send a bug report to the development \nteam?&quot;\n\nIn other cases such as an IOException, the cause might well not be a \nprogrammer error. However, the error message should still be written \nwith a focus on what the user is doing and what that particular \nexception means in that particular context. For instance, if an editor \nsuch as OpenOffice or Adobe Illustrator reads an XML document and \ndiscovers it to be malformed, it should not simply tell the user that an \nattribute value is missing a quote on line 232. Again, that&#39;s not \nsomething that makes sense to an end user. However the developer of the \nsoftware would likely understand such a message and find it useful. \nProgrammers and end users do not need the same information about problems.\n\n-- \nElliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nXML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim\n\n",
