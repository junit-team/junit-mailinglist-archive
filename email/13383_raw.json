Based on the message returned my\n&gt;  testcase will pass or fai=\r\nl.\n&gt;  Additionally I have to have multiple testcases that will send message=\r\ns\n&gt;  using the same connection. Note that the server maintains a session\n&gt; =\r\n information on the client connection. \n&gt;  How do i share this session info=\r\nrmation(connection + related crap)\n&gt;  across testcases, so that i can execu=\r\nte a sequence of testcases which\n&gt;  will all use the same connection. One m=\r\nechanism i thought of was\n&gt;  extending a testcase that will contain the con=\r\nnection and use it as a\n&gt;  fixture, all testcases will call that as a fixtu=\r\nre but how do i shared\n&gt;  the connection from the fixture to other testcase=\r\ns which them selves\n&gt;  need to send messages?\n&gt;  Thanks\n&gt;  Akhil Srinivasan=\r\n\n&gt;  \n\nI&#39;m not sure this is a good way to go - you&#39;re losing test isolation\n=\r\nso that you will potentially experience multiple failures if a single\nthing=\r\n is wrong and causes a knock-on effect. Using a Mock Object\napproach would =\r\nseem to be preferred.\n\nWhat are you trying to test here  - it sounds like i=\r\nt&#39;s acceptance\ntesting of the server? If so, then why can&#39;t you extract tes=\r\nts which\nverify the behaviour of the server according to your use cases? If=\r\n\nyou&#39;re testing that sessions are correctly associated with a given\nclient,=\r\n then I would say that is a separate test.\n\nJames\n\n",
