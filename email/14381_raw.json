I&#39;m testing the performance of an app.  I&#39;m not\n&gt; &gt; a java expert and am having trouble figuring out the syntax to\n&gt; &gt; substitute myTestResult for use in myTestCase.  Can anyone suggest the\n&gt; &gt; proper syntax?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks, Tom\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; Depending on what you want to do with the timing results, you could\njust \n&gt; subclass TestCase and override runBare(), then make your test cases \n&gt; subclass your specialized TestCase.\n&gt; \n&gt;     public void runBare() throws Throwable {\n&gt;         enteredSetup();\n&gt;         setUp();\n&gt;         exitedSetup();\n&gt;         try {\n&gt;             startTimer();\n&gt;             runTest();\n&gt;             endTimer();\n&gt;         } finally {\n&gt;             try {\n&gt;                 enteredTearDown();\n&gt;                 tearDown();\n&gt;             } finally {\n&gt;                 exitedTearDown();\n&gt;             }\n&gt;         }\n&gt;     }\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; Jason Rogers\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I,\n&gt; but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in \n&gt; the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved \n&gt; me, and gave himself for me.&quot;\n&gt;     Galatians 2:20\n\nThanks, I can see how that would work.  I&#39;m still curious as to how to\nreplace the TestResult with a subclassed version.  It seems that\nTestRunner has TestResult hardcoded as the default.  Is there a way to\npass in a replacement?\n\nThanks, Tom\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
