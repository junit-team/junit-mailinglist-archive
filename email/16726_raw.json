Could you please put in big, red letters on the\n&gt; site\n&gt;  &gt; that this is strictly a legacy code technique, and that people\n&gt; should\n&gt;  &gt; try to refactor away from using the tool as quickly as possible?\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Another great tool for adding tests to code. I think I can use this\n&gt;  &gt; tomorrow.\n&gt;  &gt; --\n\n&gt; I just read the post on this little tool, so I haven&#39;t tried it yet,\n&gt; but it seems like it would be very helpful for mocking member objects\n&gt; created in a class. How do you refactor to eliminate a dependency on\n&gt; member objects. I understand how to do it with objects a class\n&gt; collaborates with, but it is a different matter when the member\n&gt; objects are &quot;owned&quot; by the object being tested. I guess you could\n&gt; provide the class with a factory class it could use to create it&#39;s\n&gt; members, but this seems like a lot of overhead for an object that only\n&gt; needs this capability for testing purposes.\n&gt; \n&gt; I am a new java programmer, so forgive me if my terminology isn&#39;t\n&gt; correct. Hopefully you can understand what I am trying to say.\n\nI always question the idea of an object owning the lifecycle of another. \nThere are some cases where this is obviously a good design, such as when \none Value Object owns another Value Object. (Think a Customer object \nthat owns a MonetaryAmount object, representing that&#39;s Customer&#39;s \noutstanding balance.) Still, especially where Services are concerned, \nobjects should wire up to one another, rather than one Service owning \nthe lifecycle of another. In my opinion, only one object should own all \nthe lifecycles of all the Services in a system, and that&#39;s the Entry Point.\n\nSince you&#39;re a new Java programmer, you might not be familiar with Eric \nEvans&#39; work &quot;Domain Driven Design&quot;. If you are not, then I strongly \nrecommend you obtain a copy and read it, as it will help you understand \nwhy I think this way. Also, it will have positive influences on your design.\n\nTake care.\n\nPS: This is worth writing about, so I think I&#39;ll do that on my weblog.\n-- \nJ. B.
