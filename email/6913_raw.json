The \n&gt; &gt; question of faithfulness of representation doesn&#39;t \n&gt; &gt; arise.\n&gt; \n&gt; I am a little on the fence with this example.  You can\n&gt; explain that a process has a start and an end, ways of\n&gt; interacting with the environment, that they use\n&gt; resources, and are controlled, enabled or regulated by\n&gt; a larger system.  In this sense, a software process\n&gt; could correspond to a natural process, like\n&gt; photosynthesis or blood clotting.\n\nCertainly an analogy can be drawn, and it justifies the use of the\nword &quot;process&quot;.  But it&#39;s a long step from that to the idea that\nOS processes are intended to *model* real-world processes, which\nis what is needed for faithfulness of representation to be an\nimportant consideration.\n\nAn analogy can also be drawn between the kind of windows that let\nyou see through walls and the windows of windowing GUIs, again\njustifying the word.  But no one objects that GUIs&#39; windows don&#39;t\nget streaked and so are not faithful representations of their\nreal-world counterparts, nor that minimizing a window has no\nreal-world analogue and so is added behaviour that corrupts the\nobject design.\n\n&gt; &gt; Resources often do represent real-world objects, but\n&gt; &gt; it is highly desirable that the representations have\n&gt; &gt; properties those objects do not -- sharability among\n&gt; &gt; concurrently executing processes, for example.\n&gt; \n&gt; How do you represent &quot;shareability&quot; as a property in\n&gt; something like a software file?  [...]\n\nThe example I had in mind was the printing system, actually,\nconstrued as a representation of the printer.  This system has\nqueueing behaviour which the printer does not, and as a result\nprinting more than one job simultaneously through the printing\nsystem gives different (and more useful) results than trying to\nprint more than one job directly on the printer.\n\n  [...]\n&gt; I wonder if &quot;changeability&quot; could be reduced and made\n&gt; more precise by analysis, like I am trying to reduce\n&gt; &quot;testability&quot; and &quot;maintainability.&quot;  [...]\n\nIf you&#39;re just looking for a more precise definition, I&#39;d suggest\nthis: a system is said to have high changeability when the cost of\nchanging it is low.  (Still vague, but it&#39;s the proper vagueness.)\n\nMy claim that changeability is desirable relies on a tacit\nassumption that the costs of change dominate the lifetime costs of\na software system.  (Well, I also have aesthetic reasons for\nliking changeability.  But cost reduction is the main pragmatic\nreason.)\n\n-- \nSteven Taschuk           | &quot;I may be wrong but I&#39;m positive.&quot;\nstaschuk@... |       _Friday_, Robert A.
