What would it be like\n&gt; to idiomaticize Testability as a marker interface in Java?\n&gt;\n&gt; One idea is that &quot;implements Testable&quot; could mean that a runtime flag\n&gt; could be used to enable/disable a set of test methods (a la JUnit&#39;s\n&gt; test**** method naming pattern) in classes.  Just a thought.\n\nHeck of a thought.\n\nI would expect:\n   a) The class structure would contain the test methods, but they\n       wouldn&#39;t be loaded in the absence of a -test flag, or some such.\n\n   b) With the -test option present, a framework would exist to help you\n\n        experiment with the APIs, uncovering gaps in the documentation.\n        (If I give an empty string as an argument, do I get a null\nString, an\n         empty string, or an exception?)\n\n   c) API documentation would have a link to a page containing test\n       methods that would exist only if the class was testable.\n\nSuch a thing could be really cool, self-documenting addition to\nlibraries.\n\nInterestingly, in considering such a thing, I realize that the tests\nwill tend\nto be class-based, in such a scenario, rather than package-based. That\nbrings back some previous discussions about how tests should be more\noriented towards &quot;basic operations&quot; than &quot;class methods&quot;.\n\nAnd that thought brings back the famous game show line:\n    &quot;Will the real unit testing please stand up?&quot;\n\nWhat the heck *is* unit testing, anyway? If it is &quot;class methods&quot;, then\nJUnitDoclet made sense. But if it is &quot;basic operations&quot;, isn&#39;t that more\n\nlike integration testing? Or is there a middle ground, say, as package-\nlevel operations?\n\nRight now, I&#39;m seeing &quot;unit&quot; as one or more of:\n  * method\n  * class\n  * package\n  * use case\n\nAre there any other candidates? Are any of these automatically\nruled out? What exactly does the word &quot;unit&quot; mean, in this\ncontext?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
