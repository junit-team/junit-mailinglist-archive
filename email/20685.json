And then I extend (or modify) this setup slightly inside <br/>\n&gt; my different test methods.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I want to do some tests with a customer object, for example how the <br/>\n&gt; customer responds to billing differnt items to his account.<br/>\n&gt; Some of theses tests can be parameterized, some can&#39;t.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; e.g. I want to write a test that billing &quot;null&quot; is not allowed and <br/>\n&gt; throws an exception. This test is not parameterized.<br/>\n&gt; Then I want to bill different goods and I want to see, that the<br/>\n </span></blockquote>customer <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; responds correctly by say calculating a correct bonus, according to his <br/>\n&gt; state. To check this, I need to bill 10 different goods, cause some of <br/>\n&gt; them have a bonus, some don&#39;t, etc.<br/>\n&gt; These 10 tests can be parameterized with a good to bill and the <br/>\n&gt; resulting bonus. They still use the same fixture, namely the customer <br/>\n&gt; object.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I would like all these tests in the same class, since they use the same <br/>\n&gt; fixture and test a coherent set of functionality.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Does that make more sense now?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>It does make sense for me. :-)</div>",
