Thanks Bill for coming u=\r\np with the idea of a custom suite runner, and thanks David for writing such=\r\n a runner! There were a couple of minor snags with your attempt below, but =\r\nwith some minor tweaks, it seems to be working nicely.\n\n1. [compile time is=\r\nsue] The @RunWith needs to fully qualify OnceOnlySuite (i.e., prefix it wit=\r\nh &#39;All.&#39;) I decided to just make it a public top-level class since its use =\r\nwill not be tied to a particular suite.\n\n&gt; Have you tested it as written?  =\r\nThere should only ever be one of the\n&gt; internal RunnerBuilders constructed,=\r\n if my brain&#39;s on right, so it\n&gt; should work.  If it doesn&#39;t, please let me=\r\n know so I can adjust my\n&gt; brain.\n\nI tested it as written in that the Set w=\r\nas an instance field of the RunnerBuilder, and it didn&#39;t work because multi=\r\nple RunnerBuilders are instantiated. That&#39;s because multiple OnceOnlySuite =\r\nrunners instantiated. In my example, I annotated A and B to each run with O=\r\nnceOnlySuite. I did not annotate &#39;All&#39; to use OnceOnlySuite because in my r=\r\neal-world scenario, the All suite does have tests that we want to run multi=\r\nple times (against different targets).\n\n\n",
