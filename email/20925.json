Out goes a<br/>\nrequest, then if no money comes in out go a series of reminders. When the<br/>\nmoney comes in it has to be matched to the original request. If the amount<br/>\nis wrong, someone needs to figure out how to reconcile the situation. The<br/>\nbusiness logic in such situations can be incredibly complicated, primarily<br/>\nbecause of the wide range of scenarios that happen in real life. Part of the<br/>\nchallenge is automating as much processing as possible, but balance this by<br/>\nasking for manual assistance any time the business or the relationship with<br/>\nthe customer might be put at risk.<br/>\n <br/>\n&quot;Stability&quot; means how stable the API is that is being tested. An interface<br/>\nthat changes daily (not just accretion, but actual changes) probably<br/>\nshouldn&#39;t have automated tests--they are just a pain.<br/>\n <br/>\n&quot;Reliability&quot; means how likely the programmer is to make a mistake while<br/>\nprogramming. Code that is dead simple doesn&#39;t benefit much from tests, while<br/>\nwriting code with lots of logic and interactions can be helped by tests.<br/>\n <br/>\nRegards,<br/>\n <br/>\nKent Beck<br/>\nThree Rivers Institute<br/>\n<br/>\n  _____  <br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>] On Behalf Of<br/>\ntoalexsmail<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, September 23, 2008 12:28 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [junit] Re: Where to test?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHi, Kent!<br/>\nYour example with Chart API is good. However, your example with<br/>\npayment processing is completely nightmare for me. I didn&#39;t understand<br/>\nwhat does the application, what client thought and what what problem<br/>\nyou strike with. I also didn&#39;t understand your Stability and<br/>\nReliability aspect. I guess this is because I didn&#39;t understand your<br/>\npayment processing example. <br/>\n<br/>\n--- In junit@yahoogroups. &lt;mailto:junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt; com, &quot;kentb&quot;<br/>\n&lt;kentb@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; All,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Last week on succeeding days I encountered two situations, one where<br/>\n&gt; system-level tests were valuable and unit tests would have been<br/>\n </span></blockquote>useless and<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; one where the reverse was true.
