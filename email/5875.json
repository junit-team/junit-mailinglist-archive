The<br/>\noriginal comment by DS was in response to another person&#39;s question<br/>\nregarding problems using JUnit for testing EJBs.  My text is marked with my<br/>\ninitials, CD.  While I will take the advice of DS and have a look at the<br/>\nsource, I wanted the group to have access to his opinion, to have feedback<br/>\nthat could be used to make JUnit better for the next release.<br/>\n<br/>\nDS &gt; Junit internals suck. I would love to rewrite it, but don&#39;t<br/>\nDS &gt; have the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nCD &gt; I&#39;ve been told before that the JUnit source code serves as a great <br/>\nCD &gt; example for writing good code.  Hence, your statement surprised me.  <br/>\nCD &gt; Since you&#39;re a respected developer of a great application server, I <br/>\nCD &gt; ask that you cite a few examples to support your statement.  I&#39;d <br/>\nCD &gt; really like to hear your side of the story.<br/>\n<br/>\nDS &gt; Read the source, and you will see what I am talking about.  I believe <br/>\nDS &gt; you misunderstood the comments from other people.  JUnit is a good <br/>\nDS &gt; example of successful software development and it is also a good<br/>\nexample <br/>\nDS &gt; of XP development.  The problem with XP is that it is not designed for <br/>\nDS &gt; Library software (see the last chapter of the xp book), so it works<br/>\ngood <br/>\nDS &gt; at what it was designed for, but it is difficult to expand.  They also <br/>\nDS &gt; use way too much inheritance and not enough interfaces.  Anyway, just <br/>\nDS &gt; read the code and be the judge for yourself.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;   &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\nCraig Demyanovich                      <br/>\nSystems Developer<br/>\nApogent Technologies<br/>\n(269) 544 - 7514<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cdemyanovich@...\">cdemyanovich@...</a></div>",
