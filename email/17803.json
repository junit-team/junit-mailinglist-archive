It&#39;s not just a <br/>\n&gt;&gt;matter of writing the assertions.  When you test, the code that you <br/>\n&gt;&gt;write is the exercising code, and you can test both clients and <br/>\n&gt;&gt;providers.  Not saying that DbC is bad, just that I wouldn&#39;t want to <br/>\n&gt;&gt;rely on its assertion mechanism rather than tests.  <br/>\n&gt;&gt;    <br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;One of the things I write unit tests for is the proper behavior of the <br/>\n&gt;methods in the face of a precondition violation. (Usually that&#39;s <br/>\n&gt;throwing an exception.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;On the other hand, I <br/>\n&gt;&gt;feel oddly comfortable writing code with lots of tests and no embedded <br/>\n&gt;&gt;DbC constructs.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;    <br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;You&#39;re perhaps not worrying about other programmers using your code with <br/>\n&gt;no tests, or other programmers trying to break your security and do bad <br/>\n&gt;things with your code. I am quite uncomfortable thinking about such <br/>\n&gt;things. That&#39;s why I check my preconditions rigorously.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Again, this comes down to the difference between API code and <br/>\napplication code.  At the API level, it often makes sense to do more <br/>\nchecking.  Internally, tests and clear code can be sufficient.<br/>\n<br/>\nMichael Feathers<br/>\nwww.objectmentor.com</div>",
