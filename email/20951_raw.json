I am new to JUnit annotations.\n&gt;\n&gt; I have a need to execute a set of classic account registration tests:\n&gt; register a user by [email, password], verify that that succeeds, then\n&gt; immediately follow this with an identical registration with the same\n&gt; [email, password], which should fail because the account already\n&gt; exists. This is a specific case of a more general scenario where the\n&gt; first test develops state the second test needs to know about.\n&gt;\n&gt; It occurred to me to use a single test class, containing two @Test-\n&gt; decorated methods: register() and dupRegister(). The problem with\n&gt; this structure is that I found no documentation that indicates that\n&gt; the first decorated test method is executed after the second decorated\n&gt; test method. I also considered using the Parameter annotation, with\n&gt; duplicate [email, password] provided as the parameter list. While\n&gt; that could drive the tests, I see no way of indicating in this scheme\n&gt; that the first test invocation should succeed, while the second should\n&gt; fail.\n&gt;\n&gt; Would someone be kind enough to sketch a reasonable, &quot;JUnit way&quot; to\n&gt; approach this.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks.\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n",
