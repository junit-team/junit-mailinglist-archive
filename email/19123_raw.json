This\nrelease will\n&gt; likely contain several new features that we believe =\r\nare ideal for all\n&gt; testers.  The first changes, however, are in our suppor=\r\nt for custom\n&gt; runners.  If you have ever written, or been tempted to write=\r\n, a custom\n&gt; runner, read on.  Otherwise, feel free to archive this mail aw=\r\nay,\nwait here\n&gt; for further updates.  :-)\n&gt; \n&gt; ...\n&gt; \n&gt; ...\n&gt; \n&gt; Are they g=\r\none?  Good.\n&gt; \n&gt; By annotating a test class with @RunWith, a tester can dec=\r\nlare to\nJUnit that\n&gt; a class should be interpreted in a vastly different wa=\r\ny than usual.\n A great\n&gt; example is Johannes Link&#39;s ClasspathSuite runner (=\r\n\n&gt; http://johanneslink.net/cpsuite.html).  However, if an extender of JUnit=\r\n\n&gt; wanted a class to be interpreted in mostly the same way, but with a\nslig=\r\nht\n&gt; change (for example, the custom runner that ships with JMock 2),\nthey =\r\nare\n&gt; required to copy or inherit from internal classes like TestClassRunne=\r\nr.\n&gt; \n&gt; In 4.4, we will add API classes that will make this process easier.=\r\n\n At the\n&gt; same time, the internal package will undergo significant changes=\r\n, almost\n&gt; certainly breaking custom runners that have depended on these\ncl=\r\nasses in the\n&gt; past.  In order to ease this transition, we would like to in=\r\nvolve\neach of\n&gt; you to get your feedback about what should change, and also=\r\n to\nprovide you\n&gt; with frequent feedback about what is changing.  To that e=\r\nnd, CVS\nHEAD has\n&gt; been updated with the latest work, and a 4.4-snapshots r=\r\nelease\ncategory has\n&gt; been created on sourceforge for snapshot zips.  You&#39;l=\r\nl notice, for\nexample,\n&gt; that TestClassRunner is already gone, replaced by =\r\nJUnit4ClassRunner.\n Other\n&gt; changes are also afoot.\n&gt; \n&gt; For further discus=\r\nsion on this topic, please join the junitcomplements\n&gt; mailing list at\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/junitcomplements/\n&gt; \n&gt; I look forward t=\r\no seeing you there!\n&gt; \n&gt;    David Saff\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this m=\r\nessage have been removed]\n&gt;\n\n\n\n",
