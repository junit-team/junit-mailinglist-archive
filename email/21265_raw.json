Eclipse tells JUnit to run class\n&gt; ASpec.AContext and method aBehavior JUnit then sees what builder it\n&gt; should use for AContext, and doesn&#39;t find the annotation there and\n&gt; tries to use the regular JUnit4 builder and since it&#39;s a JDave spec it\n&gt; fails to run.\n&gt;\n&gt; What I want to do is: in case AllDefaultPossibilitiesBuilder notices\n&gt; that the TestClass is a non-static member class, which it has no\n&gt; chance of being able run anyway, it checks whether the declaring class\n&gt; of the testclass would be able to run it instead.\n&gt;\n&gt; In the case of JDave, the declaring class would have the @RunWith\n&gt; annotation, and with the Filter created by FilterRequest, JDave can\n&gt; then choose which Context and Spec it should actually allow to run.\n&gt;\n&gt; br,\n&gt; Tuomas\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;David Saff&quot; &lt;david@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; JDave is cool.  I&#39;m not 100% clear what you want to do, and I don&#39;t\n&gt; see the\n&gt; &gt; patch.  Could you perhaps include a small test case as inline text?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;    David Saff\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; On Tue, Dec 30, 2008 at 10:27 AM, tuomaskarkkainenri &lt;\n&gt; &gt; tuomaskarkkainenri@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   I participate in JDave (http://jdave.org). A BDD framework for Java\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that takes advantage of JUnit for example for Eclipse integration.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; We have tests in non-static inner classes of our test classes. These\n&gt; &gt; &gt; run wonderfully using the @RunWith annotation and our own runner.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; however, for individual tests, this doesn&#39;t work. What I would like\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to do is that AllDefaultPossibilitiesBuilder would check whether or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; not the test class is a non static member class. if it is, then I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; would grab the runner of the declaring class instead.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I made a patch implementing this. I will try to attach it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
