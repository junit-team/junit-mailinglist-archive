It is possible to have 100% line \ncoverage and still have a defect because you have not written code \nto handle a particular case.\n&gt; \n&gt; I do not like test coverage measurement. It is not smart enough. \nObviously, 90% coverage is much better than 50% coverage, but the \nreturn on investment goes down considerably up over 90%. My opinion.\n&gt; \n&gt; Take care.\n\nI have no real practical interest in this. It is theoretical \ncuriosity.\n\nYou are right with the 100% objection. I meant a measure which \ncovers everything. If all tests are written to the results of that \nmeasure and the tests are all green then I think it is proven that \nthere are no bugs in the code (if the test has no bugs itself).\n\nThats what I am looking for. The super duper measure.\n\nAny idea?\n\n\n",
