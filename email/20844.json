You have to be certain the cost is worth the pay off :) Yet,<br/>\nespecially with user acceptance testing, I have to side with going with a<br/>\nnew framework, if simply for the reason that the client should be able to<br/>\nread them.<br/>\n<br/>\n2008/9/3 kentb &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kentb@...\">kentb@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   Jan,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; You can use JUnit for longer-running tests, but there are some assumptions<br/>\n&gt; JUnit embodies that will cause some problems. JUnit assumes tests are<br/>\n&gt; atomic--they run or don&#39;t run, they run in unit time. Integration tests<br/>\n&gt; often take a long time to run, so interim feedback is valuable. Integration<br/>\n&gt; tests can usefully have multiple failures, where that is less common with<br/>\n&gt; unit tests. OTOH, tests are tests--independent self-checking bits of code<br/>\n&gt; that run and get reported--and for that part of running integration tests<br/>\n&gt; JUnit works fine.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It seems to me to be a tradeoff between the simplicity of running all tests<br/>\n&gt; as JUnit tests and the challenges of getting the integration tests to run<br/>\n&gt; as<br/>\n&gt; JUnit tests. Different contexts will requires different solutions. If I had<br/>\n&gt; a few integration tests, I&#39;d make them work with JUnit. If I had a large<br/>\n&gt; suite of integration tests that played a prominent role in development, I<br/>\n&gt; would use some other tool and integrate my unit testing results with the<br/>\n&gt; integration results.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Regards,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Kent Beck<br/>\n&gt; Three Rivers Institute<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; _____<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a> &lt;junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt; [mailto:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a> &lt;junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt;] On Behalf Of Jan<br/>\n&gt; Kroeze<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, September 02, 2008 1:05 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a> &lt;junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: [junit] JUnit And Larger Scale Tests<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi all!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m a bit of a newb to the whole TDD thing, but I understand that unit<br/>\n&gt; tests<br/>\n&gt; are supposed to be blazingly fast and not access the hard drive, network,<br/>\n&gt; database or anything external to the code itself. To this end, I understand<br/>\n&gt; that a framework such as jMock can be used.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So far, so good. But I find JUnit to be extremely useful for writing<br/>\n&gt; integration, system and user acceptance tests as well.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Here&#39;s my question: what is the official position of the JUnit community on<br/>\n&gt; using JUnit to do larger scale tests? Is there a better framework, or is it<br/>\n&gt; common practice to use JUnit for these tests as well?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; Jan Kroeze<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>-- <br/>\nJan Kroeze<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
