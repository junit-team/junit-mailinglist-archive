Several books already exist in English so one in\n&gt; &gt; German cannot arm.\n&gt; \n&gt; While I have many books that mention JUnit, I have yet to read one that\n&gt; is about JUnit. Any recommendations. Alas, being a parochial American,\n&gt; English is the only language in which I can read technical books.\n\nI haven&#39;t read the entire book (did quick overview + read the chapter about JUnit) but this book presents the testing methodology and not only JUnit.  I don&#39;t think that you can write 200+ pages about JUnit.  The chapter about JUnit is about 20 pages and describes how to write a test case, a suite and execute tests.  Nothing new if you have access to the documentation.\n\nWhat is more interesting about this book is the presentation of several testing methods (mock objects for ex.).  I think this book is worth reading but if you don&#39;t want to learn German (...) you will find plenty of other books written in a language you better understand.\n\n-Vladimir\n\n\n\n",
