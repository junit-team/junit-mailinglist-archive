Let me clearly explain what exactly i am looking for\nI am doing API testing using Junit - Client Side.I am purely acting as a client.\nAs a client i will make a request to the server either EJB Component or Data base.\nNow the server components they added SOAP interface. So i should test the \nSOAP interface. So can you help me or suggest me some site where i can find\nSOAP interface testing.\n \nThanks in advance,\n \nWarm Regards,\nPraveen\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n&quot;J. B. Rainsberger&quot; &lt;jbrains@...&gt; wrote:\nPraveen AH wrote:\n&gt; hi folks!!!!\n&gt; \n&gt;          I am praveen member of junit yahoo groups.I need some help from \n&gt; you people.\n&gt; I am using Junit for API testing. For the upcoming product release, the \n&gt; production team  are going to add SOAP interface. Did anybody involved \n&gt; in SOAP interface testing. Suggest me some good site which helps SOAP \n&gt; interface testing. Please share more information related to SOAP \n&gt; interface testing.\n\nWhat kind of tests do you want to write?\n\n1. XML in, XML out. For this, try XMLUnit to compare the expected result \ndocument against the actual result document.\n\n2. Java object-based proxy/client. For this, simply instantiate the \nproxy, connect to the service and pretend you&#39;re testing an ordinary \nJava class/method.\n\n3. Java object-based proxy/client without connecting to a real service. \nUse the usual fake/mock duo:\n\n(a) To test that your client invokes the service correctly, mock the \nSOAP Call API and verify that you build the SOAP request correctly.\n\n(b) To test that your client handles responses correctly, attach a fake \nSOAP API that returns a hardcoded response. For one test, send back a \nsuccess repsonse; for another test, send back a fault response; for \nerror handling, send back something ill-formed, blank or throw an exception.\n\nI hope this helps.\n-- \nJ.
