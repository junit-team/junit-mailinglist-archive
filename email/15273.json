Developers<br/>\ndon&#39;t need baby-sitting and a lot of them are very capable to know the<br/>\nconsequences of their decisions.  Reusing a protected method is dangerous --<br/>\nespecially if this method has been documented with a lot of warnings -- but<br/>\nthis doesn&#39;t mean it should be banned altogether.<br/>\n<br/>\nBetween code that I cannot reuse at all and code that I can reuse but that<br/>\nmight break in the future, I will take my chances with the latter any day.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThis gives you maximum flexibility for future development and change.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFair enough:  it gives *you* the maximum flexibility.  Declaring these<br/>\nmethods protected gives *them* the maximum flexibility.  There is no clear<br/>\nwinner:  just make this decision responsibly, and not because it&#39;s written<br/>\nin bold in the Agile manifesto.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBasic Agile: You Ain&#39;t Going to Need It (YAGNI).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIs it written in bold too?  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nCédric<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://testng.org\">http://testng.org</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
