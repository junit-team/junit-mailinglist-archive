I understand that the framework offers us \na lot of possibilities, and it&#39;s up to us to choose what&#39;s the best \nway to use it, according to our needs and purposes. I think all \napproaches have its pros and cons; for example, the approach he&#39;s \nusing, of running batch tests starting with &quot;Test&quot;, has the problem \nof not selecting a particular set of tests to run each time, but he \nhas the benefit of not worrying about anything except his unit tests. \nThe suite approach, as you suggests, has a pro of grouping tests, but \nhas also a con of hard-coding in a class which tests should be run. \nThis is related to the problem I have, of running a piece of code \nsomewhere before all tests.\n\nIf I&#39;ve said something wrong, feel free to correct me, I&#39;m always \nready to learn.\n\nLeonardo Barros\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;J. B. Rainsberger&quot; &lt;jbrains@r...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;So said Michael Orozco on 2003-07-11 --------------------\n&gt; &gt;I am probably doing this all wrong! But If I only want to run \ncertain\n&gt; &gt;tests. I put a letter in front of the test that I don&#39;t want to \nrun, and\n&gt; &gt;it is ignored at runtime. I do this because junit usually runs the \nmethods\n&gt; &gt;that have the word test in front of it, and ignores the others.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;If there is a better, or proper way to do this please let me know.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes. Identify the tests that you tend to run as a group, then put \nthem in a smaller suite.\n&gt; \n&gt; Either that or build your own TestCollector that creates a suite of \nthe methods you want. It would be relatively easy to build the \naccompanying GUI to make it simpler to pick tests.\n&gt; \n&gt; Look at GSBase&#39;s RecursiveTestSuite, which allows you to filter \ntests based on any criterion you can ask the Test object.\n&gt; \n&gt; Take care.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; J.
