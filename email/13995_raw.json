I want\nthe developer of the test to state this. Maybe they could use a\nparticular formatted comment, which I could parse and use to augment\nthe results?\n\nThe method I come up with I may have to impose on other groups within\nthis project, so I don&#39;t want it to be heavy handed, if possible.\n\nThanks for any suggestions,\n\n Nick\n\n-- \nNick Piper, Developer, LogicaCMG           http://www.nickpiper.co.uk/\nGPG Encrypted mail welcome!                             1024D/3ED8B27F\nChoose life.
