B. Rainsberger wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; I think Smalltalk does this. If you want to mark methods private, you<br/>\n&gt;&gt; put them in a protocol that suggests they shouldn&#39;t be used directly.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m far from a Smalltalk expert, so if somebody is please correct me.<br/>\n&gt; However, that&#39;s not my understanding. What I think is the case is that<br/>\n&gt; in Smalltalk access protection is object-scoped rather than<br/>\n&gt; class-scoped. In Smalltalk, any object can see all of its members,<br/>\n&gt; including members declared private in a superclass, but not the<br/>\n&gt; private members of its sibling objects and unrelated objects. Thus<br/>\n&gt; Smalltalk private is a little more like Java protected, though still<br/>\n&gt; not quite the same thing. However, privacy is still stronger than<br/>\n&gt; just a suggestion. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>ref=nosim<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo! Groups Links</div>",
