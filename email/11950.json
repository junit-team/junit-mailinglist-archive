Is there better way?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hope you can help.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It depends on what you would like to teach your students.  If you are<br/>\ntrying to create an assigment where they learn to write code that<br/>\naccomplishes certain objectives, and you&#39;re not teaching a particular<br/>\ndevelopment method, you might be better served using a tool like<br/>\nFitnesse (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.fitnesse.org/)\">http://www.fitnesse.org/)</a>.  You define a series of tests<br/>\nthat the students code must pass, and when the student runs the tests<br/>\neach one is tagged as a success or failure.  The advantage is that<br/>\nthis framework does not require the methods to be written yet in order<br/>\nfor the tests to run.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou could introduce JUnit as a tool to help your students write more<br/>\nreliable code that passes the acceptance tests you define using Fitnesse.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps!<br/>\nCarl</div>",
