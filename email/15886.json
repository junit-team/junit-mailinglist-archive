    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-699378632\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt; As an example, using the Agile method (scrums, sprints) where<br/>\n&gt; a sprint of 28 days is in place code is not ready for testing<br/>\n&gt; until maybe the 21 day.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Did you actually experience this?<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as I know, Scrum doesn&#39;t say much about testing (or coding) at all -<br/>\nwhich is way many teams adopt XP practices for this part of the process.<br/>\n<br/>\nXP, on the other hand, *requires* that the customer representative expresses<br/>\nthe requirements in executable (QA style) acceptance tests, which need to be<br/>\nready at the end of the iteration (sprint). It also encourages developers to<br/>\nproduce fully working, integrated and unit tested code from day one.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I&#39;m not sure where your impression is coming from; to me it doesn&#39;t sound<br/>\nlike a team where that can happen really has groked Agile software<br/>\ndevelopment.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; In my experience the project managers<br/>\n&gt; for sprints do not understand the need for engineering specs,<br/>\n&gt; hence they do not exist, or if they do they are after the<br/>\n&gt; fact.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not sure what you mean by &quot;engineering specs&quot;, but I also don&#39;t<br/>\nunderstand why the project manager has to understand their need for them to<br/>\nbe produced at the right time. It&#39;s the responsibility of the team to<br/>\nproduce what is needed when it&#39;s needed.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; There is no time in the plan for rework of bad code.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If you need time in the plan for rework, you are not doing enough of it.<br/>\nRefactoring, as we call reworking code in small very controlled steps,<br/>\nshould be part of the developers minute-to-minute work. They should be doing<br/>\nso much of it, so tightly intermingled with the rest of their work, that<br/>\nit&#39;s impossible to measure how much of their time they are spending doing<br/>\nit.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; There is no time in the sprint for rigorous QA.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>QA should be an ongoing effort during the sprint, parallel to the rest of<br/>\nthe work. If there is &quot;no time&quot; for this, the team really is not a truly<br/>\nAgile one.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; This leads to quantity not quality.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Agreed. But it has nothing to do with Agility.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Remember that satellite that crashed in the<br/>\n&gt; planet Mars because different methods of measuring speed were<br/>\n&gt; used. Effective integration testing would have caught that problem.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>As would have better communication and collaboration. That hardly was an<br/>\nAgile project, was it? ;)<br/>\n <br/>\nCheers, Ilja</div>",
