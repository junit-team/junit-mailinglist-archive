Point well taken. back to the main track.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    &gt; &gt; I wanted to point out the potential flaws of design and<br/>\n    &gt; &gt; testing that could otherwise be missed when you put tests in the<br/>\n </span></blockquote>same<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">     &gt; &gt; package as production code.  The production code should be tested in<br/>\n </span></blockquote>the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">     &gt; &gt; same fashion it would be used by a client.  A test is a client in<br/>\n </span></blockquote>some<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">     &gt; &gt; degree.  In most cases clients exist outside of the package. <br/>\n    &gt; &gt; [..snip]<br/>\n    &gt; &gt; Thus,<br/>\n    &gt; &gt; I conclude, that testing the public interfaces of ALL objects (the<br/>\n </span></blockquote>key being<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">     &gt; &gt; ALL) should prove sufficient, thus not needing the tests to reside<br/>\n </span></blockquote>in the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">     &gt; &gt; same package as their associated production code objects.  Of<br/>\n </span></blockquote>course, there<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">     &gt; &gt; are exceptions... we have ways around those.<br/>\n<br/>\n    &gt; In an ideal world, you&#39;re right. Testing *all* the public methods<br/>\n </span></blockquote>should give you complete functional <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">     &gt; coverage. <br/>\n    &gt; However:<br/>\n    &gt; 1. You might want to put more stress on some classes and less on<br/>\n </span></blockquote>others. In this case, you might want to <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">     &gt; test more then the public methods of critical-path components, and<br/>\n </span></blockquote>less of the peripherals.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo design the objects that way.  It will take a little more thought, a lot<br/>\nmore refactoring, but generally only one test-case :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">     &gt; 2. You might want to access non-public methods in your setUp /<br/>\n </span></blockquote>tearDown.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, why?  No one has yet given me one concrete answer as to why this<br/>\nshould be.  It&#39;s all been ambiguous speculation.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">     &gt; 3. Sometimes the tested class needs a sophisticated context in runtime<br/>\n </span></blockquote>(EJB / Servlet). In this case, you <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">     &gt; might want to short circuit it in testing by calling protected /<br/>\n </span></blockquote>default access methods that would be <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">     &gt; called by the public interface in production mode.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This short circuiting could be avoided by mature mock objects and a good<br/>\ntesting framework for these contexts.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">     &gt; True, you might call all these &quot;exceptions&quot;. True, they deter from the<br/>\n </span></blockquote>pure model. Still, they are <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">     &gt; common, and are easily resolved by placing tests in the same package.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>On the other hand, I don&#39;t see the <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">     &gt; actual harm of doing so.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>But, not so common as they need to be.  There will always be exceptions,<br/>\nmost likely, but they shouldn&#39;t become the norm simply because they make<br/>\nthings a little easier.  The old addage is, &quot;No pain, no gain.&quot;  If you<br/>\nsimply take the easy way out you design will absolutely suffer!  Again, I<br/>\nbelieve tests are a way to strengthen the design, not weaken it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">     &gt; B.t.w., the right access mode for &quot;accessible in package only&quot; is<br/>\n </span></blockquote>&quot;default&quot;. &quot;protected&quot; makes it <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">     &gt; accessible to both package members and subclassses.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Thanks.  I know that, but it&#39;s good to be corrected, especially when your<br/>\nmistakes are in writing.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW: Just in case anyone is feeling slighted by my seemingly dogmatic<br/>\napproach -- it is not my intention to pick on anyone&#39;s person, but I don&#39;t<br/>\nmind pointing out what I think are flaws in the process :)  After all, what<br/>\nis this group for if we pander to people just so we don&#39;t hurt feelings and<br/>\nnever get to the bottoms of the issues.  ...just a friendly disclaimer from<br/>\nyour test-infected fellow.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Jason</div>",
