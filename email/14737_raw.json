It seems to me that techniques that so obscure they&#39;re only \n&gt;known to the cognoscenti indicate there&#39;s something missing somewhere.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nWell, there&#39;s the one I was learning yesterday: XMLBeans from the Apache \nproject. There&#39;s newer versions of Weblogic (the old ones had the \nkitchen-sink JAR from hell). The xml-apis.jar and xercesImpl.jar from \nthe Xerces project. The way Ant 1.6 has the optional jars split up. \nJaxen. Every JDBC driver I&#39;ve ever used. Hibernate.\n\nAnd those are just the ones on my home machine.\n\nAnd if it&#39;s an obscure solution, which would actually work, why not \npromote it more? We&#39;re discussing the code _you_ can write, which _you_ \ncan control - if you want to have a runtime and API jar, only you are \nstopping you.\n\nAlso, note the list. It&#39;s discussing the JUnit framework. Now, this may \nbe shocking to you... but the majority of developers still do not write \nunit tests. I still come across Java developers, some with considerable \nexperience, who haven&#39;t heard of JUnit. There is no technique so widely \nknown that there aren&#39;t droves of developers who don&#39;t know about it.\n\n&gt;&gt;You keep missing the distinction between &quot;public&quot; and &quot;published&quot;:\n&gt;&gt;&quot;published&quot; is a social convention enforced by social contracts.\n&gt;&gt;Providing a runtime JAR, to be available at _runtime_, and not\n&gt;&gt;_compile time_, is an excellent way of enforcing these conventions.\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;I&#39;ve already argued this one to death in this thread; and don&#39;t have \n&gt;anything more to add at this point; but I will try to rephrase. There \n&gt;may be a distinction between public and published in the original \n&gt;developer&#39;s mind, but it starts and stops there. For the client \n&gt;programmer, public == published; and wishing otherwise ain&#39;t going to \n&gt;make it so. The distinction that exists in Java is between public and \n&gt;package-private. That&#39;s what you need to work with. Perhaps other \n&gt;languages have clearer distinctions between public and published, but \n&gt;Java doesn&#39;t.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nExcept that if you package the published classes seperately, and only \nprovide Javadoc for the published classes, then people are not going to \n&quot;stumble over&quot; the non-published classes. We&#39;ve argued that point to \ndeath as well.\n\nI don&#39;t see it as the duty of an API designer to protect people who \ndeliberately go out of their way to inflict pain and suffering on \nthemselves. Making a clear distinction to the client programmer is all \nthat&#39;s called for.\n\n&gt;&gt;Similarly, excluding packages from JavaDoc works well.\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;That helps. Unlike runtime/API separation I&#39;ve actually seen this done. \n&gt;I&#39;d estimate I&#39;ve seen it about as frequently as I&#39;ve seen API docs that \n&gt;include package-private and private methods.  It would help more, if it \n&gt;were more common. For instance, why are the junit.samples and \n&gt;junit.tests packages published in the JavaDoc on the JUnit web site at \n&gt;http://www.junit.org/junit/javadoc/3.8.1/index.htm ?\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nI don&#39;t know - ask the ObjectMentor folks who set junit.org up. \nHowever... if you _download_ JUnit 3.8.1, and look at the _distributed_ \nJavadoc, the only packages covered are junit.framework and junit.extensions.\n\nRobert.\n\n-- \n               &quot;Software is too expensive to build cheaply&quot;\nRobert Watkins         http://twasink.net/          robertdw@...\n\n\n",
