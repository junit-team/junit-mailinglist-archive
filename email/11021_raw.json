When I use the eclipse\n&gt; plugin to run the test, it seems to be working just fine. But when I\n&gt; use the ANT, it says the BUILD failed and it does not execute the\n&gt; Thread.sleep line in one of the tests. Does anyone know why is it\n&gt; doing that? Any help on this matter would be really appreciated.\n\nHow do you know it isn&#39;t executing that line?  Are things just running slower \nin Eclipse such that the interval you have chosen to sleep is small enough to \ndo the job, and outside Eclipse you need to have a bigger interval?\n\n-- \nJason Rogers\n\n&quot;Where there is no vision, the people perish...&quot;\n    Proverbs 29:18\n\n",
