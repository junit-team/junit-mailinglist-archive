I need to execute an arbitrary\nset of test methods (using @test annotations) against a known -- but not yet\nexistent at JUnit launch time -- set of classes. Those classes are generated\nand compiled in a previous test case within same session and then need to be\nloaded dynamically. Ideally, I would present the name of classes as Strings;\nI understand that JUnit has a way to do this dynamically for method names\nbut I can&#39;t find a similar feature for class names -- everything I&#39;ve tried\nends up forcing me to have an explicit compiled reference at test harness\nlaunch time.\n\nAnd of course I&#39;d really like not to have to write my own runner\nimplementation. ;) In TestNG I can do this with factories but our build\nenvironment currently only supports JUnit.\n\nMiles\n\nOn Wed, May 13, 2009 at 4:23 AM, Johannes Link &lt;jl@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I guess your own runner implementation to use with @RunWith could do the\n&gt; trick.

For\n&gt; &gt; example, my use case is launching some tests from an Eclipse plugin\n&gt; &gt; test for code-generated classes.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; This situation is actually more difficult under JUnit4 because of\n&gt; &gt; reliance on annotations. I can&#39;t find a path that doesn&#39;t require\n&gt; &gt; class names to exist at compile time. Am I missing something?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
