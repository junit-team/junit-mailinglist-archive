Martin wrote an article in IEEE Software magazine last year<br/>\ncalled &quot;The Test Bus Imperative: Architectures That Support Automated<br/>\nAcceptance Testing&quot;. This article contains a lot of good insights on how<br/>\nto approach the problem of automated testing of GUIs. You can find the<br/>\narticle at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/MS.2005.110\">http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/MS.2005.110</a> - though<br/>\nyou need to have membership to the IEEE Computer Society to view the<br/>\nthing, or pay $20<br/>\n<br/>\nTo summarise the main point of the article, strive to ensure that *all*<br/>\nlogic in your software has a testable interface (aka test bus). The GUI<br/>\nbecomes a very thin shell over testable presentation logic, which hooks<br/>\ninto lower level business logic, and so on (all of which is testable).<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck!<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJoe Schmetzer .:.
