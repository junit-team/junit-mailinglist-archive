The idea is\n&gt; to segregate which methods were recently added.\n&gt; \n&gt; So far so good I have been able to use a doclet to\n&gt; extract these methods using the @since javadoc tag.\n&gt; This doclet has the logic to segregate these methods.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now how do I integrate this with Junit.\n&gt; Any suggestions?\n\nI think I understand. You want to be able to run, for example, &quot;only the \ntests I added in the last 2 hours&quot;.\n\nIf you are running JDK 5.0, you can do this with attributes and by using \nGSBase&#39;s RecursiveTestSuite or JUnit-addons&#39; DirectorySuiteBuilder. Each \nof these allows you to filter out tests on any criteria you want -- you \ncould ignore tests that don&#39;t have the right attribute.\n\nOther than that, you&#39;d have to use naming conventions or do what you&#39;ve \nbeen doing.\n\nIf you only want to separate test case classes from one another, you \ncould implement tag interfaces. This is essentially the same solution as \nattributes, but you cannot use it at the method level.\n\nSo you&#39;ll likely either maintain the version numbers in the code using \nXDoclet, or in a separate file for which you could write a simple \nTestSuite collector.\n-- \nJ.
