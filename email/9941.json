You want to<br/>\ntest at boundary points, so there should be assertions on at least<br/>\n<br/>\n* an empty string<br/>\n* a case where the match is at the beginning<br/>\n* a case where the match is at the end<br/>\n* a case where there is no match<br/>\n<br/>\nand probably one assertion on<br/>\n<br/>\n* a case where the match is in the middle<br/>\n<br/>\nSome people would put each assertion into a separate test method.<br/>\nThis is a quasi-religious issue for some.   I would usually group<br/>\nall of the assertions into one test method.  Unless I was actually<br/>\nimplementing the indexOf() method, in which case I would probably not<br/>\nbe so brave ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJim Dixon  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jdd@...\">jdd@...</a>   tel +44 117 982 0786  mobile +44 797 373 7881</div>",
