However, if I include the optional\nstring argument, then that message is displayed in the output.\nI have a very high opinion of the Junit framework and find it hard to\nbelieve that the null message is standard behavior. It feels so\nclunky, almost as if Junit does not check to see if the optional\nargument was passed or not. My guess is that there&#39;s a property\nsomewhere which allows me disable the null error but I can&#39;t find it.\nMy other option is to just add a string argument to all of the\nasserts in all of my unit tests (at this point, not that many although\nit would still be a pain and would probably take me at least a few hours).\nAny and all help is appreciated.\n\n\n \n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
