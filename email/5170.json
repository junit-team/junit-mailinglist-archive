The java.util.Set of listeners has an object added (the<br/>\n&gt; ContainerObjectView instance) while there is still an java.util.Iterator in<br/>\n&gt; use over the Design&#39;s listeners, which causes a<br/>\n&gt; ConcurrentModificationException.<br/>\n&gt; The tricky bit is that this will never happen when the Gui is not attached<br/>\n&gt; as a listener to the Design.<br/>\n&gt; The solution is to clone the Set or to use toArray(), and iterating over the<br/>\n&gt; copy instead.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Is this the &quot;norm&quot; in the type of applications that you write?<br/>\n<br/>\nWe can write tests for the gui, no doubt about it - it&#39;s just I question how<br/>\nuseful such tests are when weighed against the effort that must go in to<br/>\nwriting them. You hit upon a case where it&#39;s not an option - you have to<br/>\ntest the gui.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nRobert Koss, Ph.D.     | Training, Mentoring, Contract Development<br/>\nSenior Consultant      | Object Oriented Design, C++, Java<br/>\nwww.objectmentor.com   | Extreme Programming</div>",
