One prime example is<br/>\n&gt; where you are driven to make a design decision that runs counter to<br/>\n&gt; &#39;common sense&#39; and must indicate why in order to keep people from<br/>\n&gt; wrongly rewriting the code in the future. This often happens when trying<br/>\n&gt; to accommodate a framework or hardware that doesn&#39;t quite work as<br/>\n&gt; advertised.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Absolutely agreed.
