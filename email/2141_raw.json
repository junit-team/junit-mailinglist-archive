I try to write a code generator for JUnit testcases and plan to use JavaCC to parse the java files.  I have successfully generated the parser for the Java language.\n\nMy question is: how can I traverse the JJTree?  I haven&#39;t found yet a real great example to use the Visitor interface and don&#39;t want to spend too much time on searching.\n\nDo you have had experiences with JavaCC and the Visitor interface?  If so, I would be extremely glad to hear from you.\n\n-Vladimir\n\n\n\n",
