It was pretty clear to me.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Rather than deem Junit insufficient, my first thought was that I was missing<br/>\n&gt; something.  This stance was taken out of respect for “all the very smart <br/>\n&gt; people<br/>\n&gt; who&#39;ve been working with JUnit since 1999.”  The reason that I asked on this<br/>\n&gt; forum is to “take some stock in what someone with experience has to say.”<br/>\n&gt; I was expecting some explanation of why this type of testing was not <br/>\n&gt; supported.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>OK. Did you get the explanation you wanted? Sometimes the explanation <br/>\ntakes pages and pages, and I don&#39;t have the energy to write that out <br/>\nevery time someone asks.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Maybe that there were better paradigms that Junit preferred.  I was simply<br/>\n&gt; trying to best understand a piece of software before moving on.<br/>\n&gt; I guess I&#39;m confused about your need to be condescending, especially <br/>\n&gt; since my<br/>\n&gt; motivations to respect previous work, listen to experience, and recognize<br/>\n&gt; software limitations seem to line up pretty nicely with your views.<br/>\n&gt; Thanks for you time, I guess I&#39;ll have to wait until you explain the <br/>\n&gt; solutions<br/>\n&gt; that you alluded to.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I apologize for my tone. I was tired, and it seemed like you were asking <br/>\nfor our advice, then disregarding it anyway. You can understand how that <br/>\nmight be enervating.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
