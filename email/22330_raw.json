Essentially, the model has\n&gt; a\n&gt; &gt; listener infrastructure and if the u=\r\nser changes the value of the class\n&gt; &gt; attribute the appropriate event is s=\r\nupposed to fire. The typical\n&gt; &gt; setter/getter looks like this:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; cla=\r\nss MyBean extends Listenable {\n&gt; &gt; String value;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; public String getV=\r\nalue() {\n&gt; &gt; return value;\n&gt; &gt; }\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; public void setValue(String newVal=\r\nue) {\n&gt; &gt; fireAttributeChangedEvent(&quot;value&quot;, value, newValue);\n&gt; &gt; value =\r\n=3D newValue;\n&gt; &gt; }\n&gt; &gt; }\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I need to test that the setters fire the =\r\nappropriate event, and that\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; event attribute name is correct. I wa=\r\nnt a test harness to essentially\n&gt; &gt; collect all the setters and getters an=\r\nd change the value to ensure\n&gt; that\n&gt; &gt; the event is sent as expected. Then=\r\n I want to run that against all my\n&gt; &gt; domain models.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; My understand=\r\ning is that I need to generate a suite, and add the test\n&gt; &gt; instances to t=\r\nhat suite. I&#39;ve upgraded to JUnit 4 because I think it\n&gt; is\n&gt; &gt; designed be=\r\ntter. I&#39;m just at a loss as to how to start. With JUnit 4,\n&gt; &gt; individual t=\r\nests are marked with an annotation.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this =\r\nmessage have been removed]\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have =\r\nbeen removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been remove=\r\nd]\n\n\n",
