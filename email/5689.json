Is there some good way to test multithreaded code that <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t invole just waiting a few milliseconds and hoping that a task <br/>\nfinished?  I imagine that a better solution might involve calls to <br/>\njoin() but tie the unit test closely to the particular implementation.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, here&#39;s the original question with my current, unsatisfactory <br/>\ntest (although it doesn&#39;t have much of the code being tested - I <br/>\ndidn&#39;t want to clutter the post.  I should add some.):<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://saloon.javaranch.com/cgi-bin/ubb/ultimatebb.cgi?\">http://saloon.javaranch.com/cgi-bin/ubb/ultimatebb.cgi?</a><br/>\nubb=get_topic&f=9&t=001390</div>",
