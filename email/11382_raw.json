It is more more\ninformative for the CanConnectToDatabase test to fail because of\nerrors, as subsequent tests (like RetrieveData, SaveData, etc) to fail\nbecause of an invalid assumption.\n\nI picture things like additional colours for assumptions and\ncorollaries (lets say orange) in the xUnit gui.\n\nandrew f\n\n\nOn Fri, 9 Jul 2004 11:26:47 -0400, David Plass &lt;dplass@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; How does adding &#39;assumptions&#39; and &#39;corollaries&#39; help?

We are not verifying Count\n&gt; in this test, but rather indexing.  Although I would argue that it is\n&gt; nice to have pre-requisites satisfied in the middle of a test, to help\n&gt; direct your attention to the true cause of the issue.\n&gt; \n&gt; Much like the snowball effect of the nuclear reactor plant example.  A\n&gt; defect occurs, which in turn causes other defects (which in turn\n&gt; causes more defects, and so on).  From an analysis perspective it is\n&gt; difficult to pin-point the root defect because it is being masks but\n&gt; subsequent ones.  Unlike the above example, where the order of the\n&gt; defects can be used to unravel the issue, in testing order is\n&gt; independent, so the primary defects are not necessarily those that\n&gt; occur first.\n&gt; \n&gt; To address this, it would interesting to append two additional bits of\n&gt; information on an assertion.\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) Assumption.AreEqual(3,list.Count,&quot;Check the count, and the add\nmethods&quot;);\n&gt; 2) Corollory.IsTrue(list.ContainsOnly(typeof(string)));\n&gt; \n&gt; An assumption is really a pre-requisite - that if fails, really means\n&gt; that you were not even able to set-up to do the real testing.  Having\n&gt; assumptions fail helps to pin-point coupling between components - as\n&gt; well as helps direct your attention was secondary failing tests to the\n&gt; primary ones (aka the failed Assertions).\n&gt; \n&gt; An corollary is something you believe to be true, but is not essential\n&gt; to your unit test itself.  Corollaries are nice because you indirectly\n&gt; add additional tests for other components of our system without that\n&gt; much extra overhead.  Failing corollaries may highlight obscure bugs\n&gt; in other parts of your system, or they highlight your\n&gt; mis-understanding of those other parts (or they highlight a change to\n&gt; the underlying assumptions of those parts).\n&gt; \n&gt; On Thu, 8 Jul 2004 10:22:01 +0000, Jason Rogers\n&gt; &lt;jacaetevha@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; On Wednesday 07 July 2004 10:49 pm, Curt Sampson wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  On Tue, 6 Jul 2004, hedgi wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt;   Now I there is the problem.

I read some of\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt;   the postings in this newsgroup, but it seems that such kind of\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt;   requirement point a desing flaw and I should somehow rearrange my\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt;   Unit Test Structure to made the tests indepentdant. I&#39;m stuck\nwith\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt;   it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  I&#39;ve been thinking for a while that this is a serious problem in\nJUnit\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  (and most unit testing frameworks), because it&#39;s been such an\nannoyance\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  for so many people. Let&#39;s face it; a lot of groups of tests do have\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  known dependencies between tests such that if test A fails, we know\n&gt; that\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  the output of tests B, C and D are uninteresting. Yet we end up\nrunning\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  B, C and D anyway, and then searching through all the error output\nfor\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  the failure that we know is the &quot;real&quot; one, ignoring all the others\nas\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  spurious.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; With all due respect, I believe that is a code smell.  It seems to say\nto\n&gt; me\n&gt; &gt; that there is something not right about the design of the code being\n&gt; tested,\n&gt; &gt; or perhaps even more elusive, something is wrong with how the tests are\n&gt; &gt; written.  When I find these types of dependencies I inevitably rethink\nhow\n&gt; I\n&gt; &gt; have written my tests.  Have I coded in the dependencies or are they\n&gt; really\n&gt; &gt; there.  More times than not I have coded in the dependencies -- and\n&gt; therefore\n&gt; &gt; I can remove them.  Further, I would argue that I _NEED_ to remove them.\n&gt; &gt; Now, maybe I am old-fashioned but I believe tests (at least at the\n&gt; &gt; unit/programmer level) ought to be as autonomous as possible.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --\n&gt; &gt; Jason Rogers\n&gt; &gt; 117 N.
