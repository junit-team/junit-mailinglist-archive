For example all files that have a &quot;Test&quot; in their names.\n&gt; - a TestCase is only executed if it has at least one &quot;test...&quot; method (otherwise a warning is raised)\n&gt; \n&gt; The TestCollector doesn&#39;t parse the file to see if it has a &quot;test&quot; method.  At least no TestCollector found in the official release.\n&gt; \n&gt; To summarize:\n&gt; - your TestCase must implement at least one method beginning with &quot;test&quot;\n&gt; - in order to use the standard TestCollector (but you can write your own) your TestCase must contain &quot;Test&quot; in its name\n\n\nNow we have deviated from the original topic.  I have a _TestSuite_ that is not\nbeing executed as a test suite.  It is included with a number of other tests,\ngathered by Ant&#39;s junit task.  Currently, I am trying to run it through the\njunit.swingui.TestRunner class--but it also is treating my TestSUITE as a TestCase.\nThat is not cool.  If I take the time to write a TestSuite, I want it to be run\nas a suite--not a case.\n\n",
