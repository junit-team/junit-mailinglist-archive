One is named Micah, and is rather\nuser-friendly most of the time, but has a somewhat draining\nmaintenance schedule, and sporadic uptime.  The other doesn&#39;t yet have\na last name that we&#39;re sharing, although I expect the first name will\nbe &quot;Google&quot;.\n\nThanks for understanding if your great questions and valuable patches\nare responded to with more delay over the coming weeks.\n\n   David Saff\n\n",
