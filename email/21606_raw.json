I need to execute an arbitrar=\r\ny\n&gt; set of test methods (using @test annotations) against a known -- but no=\r\nt yet\n&gt; existent at JUnit launch time -- set of classes. Those classes are =\r\ngenerated\n&gt; and compiled in a previous test case within same session and th=\r\nen need to be\n&gt; loaded dynamically. Ideally, I would present the name of cl=\r\nasses as Strings;\n&gt; I understand that JUnit has a way to do this dynamicall=\r\ny for method names\n&gt; but I can&#39;t find a similar feature for class names -- =\r\neverything I&#39;ve tried\n&gt; ends up forcing me to have an explicit compiled ref=\r\nerence at test harness\n&gt; launch time.\n&gt;\n&gt; And of course I&#39;d really like not=\r\n to have to write my own runner\n&gt; implementation. ;) In TestNG I can do thi=\r\ns with factories but our build\n&gt; environment currently only supports JUnit.=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Miles\n&gt;\n&gt; On Wed, May 13, 2009 at 4:23 AM, Johannes Link &lt;jl@johannesl=\r\nink.net&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I guess your own runner implementation to use wi=\r\nth @RunWith could do the\n&gt;&gt; trick.
