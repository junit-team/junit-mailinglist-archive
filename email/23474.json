[1] This causes the issue that for example IDEA&#39;s test <br/>\nrunner cannot report the test progress in real time - the tests are <br/>\nexecuted before the progress bar is even started.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a long-term solution I&#39;m developing a new test runner [2] which <br/>\nsolves this issue and has also a bunch of other improvements. The first <br/>\nrelease of that test runner should be some time later this summer.<br/>\n<br/>\n[1] <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/orfjackal/specsy/blob/master/src/main/scala/net/orfjackal/specsy/junit/SpecsyJUnitRunner.scala\">https://github.com/orfjackal/specsy/blob/master/src/main/scala/net/orfjackal/specsy/junit/SpecsyJUnitRunner.scala</a><br/>\n[2] <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/orfjackal/jumi\">https://github.com/orfjackal/jumi</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nhuntchrisalias wrote on 17.6.2011 15:43:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Hi there,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m writing a custom test runner that is not easily able to determine<br/>\n&gt; how many tests will be executed in advance.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The runner extends ParentRunner and its getChildren method is called<br/>\n&gt; prior to tests being executed via runChild. Each test is also described<br/>\n&gt; via describeChild.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; During runChild execution, if I create child descriptions of each child<br/>\n&gt; as each unforeseeable test occurs, then I get &quot;unrooted&quot; output.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My actual use-case is that I have a test runner executing a series of<br/>\n&gt; tests within an html file. I would have to parse the html and its<br/>\n&gt; associated JavaScript to determine how many tests will be run. This<br/>\n&gt; would be tricky.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Is there a recommended means of reporting the results of tests that are<br/>\n&gt; not determinable in advance?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Kind regards,<br/>\n&gt; Christopher<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>-- <br/>\nEsko Luontola<br/>\nwww.orfjackal.net</div>",
