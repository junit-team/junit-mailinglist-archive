This class needs to be serialized to a file and then reloaded at<br/>\nsome point.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m using this as an opportunity to learn more about JUnit (since its fairly<br/>\nsimple). My question is this<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nGiven that I have two methods of my class I need to test, SaveLicense and<br/>\nLoadLicense, should I write this as two separate tests or as a single test<br/>\nthat incorporates both? To clarify, to load a license, I would need to have<br/>\na saved license. The load license would then verify that the information<br/>\nthat was saved was loaded correctly.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
