I would be interested to know how you do *that*...\n\nNot perfect, but close. The other flaky part is sample code. I don&#39;t \nmake any promises about that, but quite a bit of it is public in a \nseparate package. In XOM at least outside of samples and tests \neverything that&#39;s public (or protected) is published. This requires \ncareful thought and design, and you need to think twice (and then think \nagain) before making anything public. If you&#39;re wrong and something \nneeds to be public, you can always make it public later; but it&#39;s much \nharder to take a public method away.\n\nThe most common mistake that prevents unifying public and published is \nexcessive package differentiation. Too often code is separated into more \npackages than it needs to be. As I said earlier, this should be less of \na problem in future JDKs once package access can be extended into \nsubpackages.\n\n-- \nElliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nXML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim\n\n",
