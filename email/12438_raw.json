The idea is \n&gt; to segregate which methods were recently added.\n&gt; \n&gt; So far so good I have been able to use a doclet to \n&gt; extract these methods using the @since javadoc tag.\n&gt; This doclet has the logic to segregate these methods.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now how do I integrate this with Junit.\n&gt; Any suggestions?\n&gt; Thanks\n&gt; Raman\n&gt; \n&gt; --- &quot;J.

If you mean \n&gt; &gt; different versions of the same class, then you can&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; run those tests \n&gt; &gt; simultaneously, anyway. Tell us more about what, in\n&gt; &gt; general, you&#39;re \n&gt; &gt; trying to do.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; You can always use XSLT or XML parsing to analyze\n&gt; &gt; the test results that \n&gt; &gt; Ant generates with the &lt;junit&gt; task.\n&gt; &gt; -- \n&gt; &gt; J.
