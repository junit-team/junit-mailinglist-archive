Do you think this would be a hangup often in scenarios you&#39;ve\n&gt; seen?  How did you solve such problems in JUnit 3?\n\nAs far as I can tell from the community, they didn&#39;t. (I never \npersonally dealt with the problem.) That was one thing they didn&#39;t like \nabout JUnit: running out of memory when constructing test suites.\n\n&gt; Thanks for the excellent questions--this is exactly what we were looking\n&gt; for.\n\nYou&#39;re welcome.\n-- \nJ.
