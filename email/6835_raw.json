You are\ntalking about aspects in a system, which is exactly my point.  Testability,\nlike logging, is a cross-cutting aspect of the application, not part of the\nobjects being modeled.  You say it&#39;s easier or your preference to represent\ntestability as addtional mixed in methods here and there in the objects.  I\ndon&#39;t like that.  But it seems like it&#39;s a matter of taste.\n\n&gt; So now, always, testability is high on my list of things I consider when\n&gt; I design any system. I usually am expected to provide some way of showing,\n&gt; on a continuous basis, that the system will do what&#39;s expected of it, so\n&gt; it&#39;s really almost a final function of the system in the same way that\n&gt; the behaviour the client is looking for is a final function of it.\n\nI think we agree here.  We just disagree about how testability should be\nrepresented in an object oriented system.  This is an interesting general\nproblem for which we need some general principles.  Anyone else have\nthoughts on how to implement or represent &quot;testability?&quot;\n\nScott S.\n\n\n\n",
