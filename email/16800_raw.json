At least to a certain extent=\r\n.\n\nWell said.\n\nThere are obvious disagreements and mis-understandings about=\r\n the ways\ndevelopers should test: manual/automated, test first/during/after=\r\n,\ntest-some/test-everything, etc., but we all seem to agree that some\n(non-=\r\ntrivial) amount of testing is part of a developer&#39;s job.  This is\nnot a sur=\r\nprising result given the sample of people who participate in\nthis forum.  W=\r\nhat is somewhat surprising is that today most developers\nwill readily agree=\r\n with that statement as well (this would not have\nbeen the case 5-10 years =\r\nago).\n\nThere is, however, a difference between agreeing with something and\n=\r\npracticing it.  The state of affairs today is that most software\ndevelopmen=\r\nt organizations and individual developers agree that\ndeveloper testing is t=\r\nhe right thing to do - but very few actually do\nit, or do it well enough.  =\r\nI call this &quot;The Developer Testing Paradox&quot;\nand wrote about in some detail =\r\non developertesting.com:\n\nhttp://www.developertesting.com/archives/month200=\r\n501/20050127-TheDeveloperTestingParadox.html\n\nWhat I see on this forum (and=\r\n others) is that we (the thought leaders\nand active promoters of developer =\r\ntesting) spend too much time arguing\nwith each-other about the best way to =\r\ndo developer testing instead of\nagreeing on the common ground and joining  =\r\nforces to promote the core\nidea that we all agree upon.\n\nIf I was a develop=\r\ner exploring the idea of unit testing and wanting to\nlearn more about it an=\r\nd JUnit/TestNG/Agitator/you-name-it, I would\nfind some of the arguments we =\r\nhave to be a turn-off: &quot;I&#39;d really like\nto try developer testing, but these=\r\n people can&#39;t even agree amongst\nthemselves on how to go about it.&quot;\n\nI beli=\r\neve it&#39;s fine and healthy to have differing opinions and believe\nin differe=\r\nnt approaches to developer testing, but I can&#39;t help\nthinking that, compare=\r\nd to the reality that the vast majority of\ndevelopers and organizations are=\r\n not practicing developer testing in\nthe first place, we are splitting hair=\r\ns.\n\nI believe the best way to grow the ranks of people who become test\ninfe=\r\ncted is to lower the barriers to entry, to offer a variety of\napproaches to=\r\n suit most tastes and preferences: \n\nTest-first or test-last? Either one as=\r\n long as you test.  \nJUnit or TestNG? Whatever feels most natural to you.  =\r\n\nManual or Automated? Take your pick, mix-and-match, both are good.\n\nInstea=\r\nd of attacking or confronting people who bring other approaches,\nviews, and=\r\n tools to the table, we should welcome them because we need\nmore people on =\r\nour side and more/better tools and options to get more\npeople to join the r=\r\nanks of test-infected developers.\n\nIn my opinion, our ranks are still too s=\r\nmall for us to act in a\ndivisive way, make the entry barrier too high, or b=\r\ne too inflexible\nabout the way people choose to approach their testing.\n\nAl=\r\nberto\n\n\n\n\n\n",
