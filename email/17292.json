Everything is relative.<br/>\n&gt;   <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Actually, I would go farther out there.  There&#39;s three kinds of software <br/>\nout there:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Software good enough that some company finally decides to shrink-wrap <br/>\nit and ship it to millions, or put it up on their public website and <br/>\nwait to get bought by Yahoo!<br/>\n2) Software just good enough for the single customer that paid for it to <br/>\npay off the contract.<br/>\n3) Software that never sees the light of day. (try googling for &quot;* of <br/>\nsoftware projects fail&quot;)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile a majority of the software many of us _use_ is in category 1, I <br/>\nthink that a lot of us work in category 2, and I&#39;ll guess that more than <br/>\na few of us have had to escape from a category 3 project at some time. <br/>\n<br/>\nLet me throw on another anecdote, just for fun.  My wife is a medical <br/>\nstudent, and has recently been considering places to do her clinical <br/>\nresidency.  One place was still using drug orders written on pieces of <br/>\npaper (finally, in 2006, this is unusual even in medicine).  However, <br/>\nshe was told: 1) They&#39;re rolling out a new computer system next year, 2) <br/>\nOf course, it will probably take about six months to shake out all the <br/>\nbugs, but after that, it will be really nice.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was floored that: 1) My wife and her informant both took it for <br/>\ngranted that the software would release with significant bugs, 2) My own <br/>\nfirst reaction was actually &quot;Yeah, what can you do.&quot; (indignation came <br/>\nlater), 3) We&#39;re talking about _prescribing drugs to hospital patients_ <br/>\nhere.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, perhaps none of this is the point.  In the end, it doesn&#39;t <br/>\nmatter if the global software industry is producing software that meets <br/>\nsome criteria of &quot;good enough&quot;.  What matters to most of our paychecks <br/>\nis that our software is better than what our customers could get more <br/>\ncheaply from someone else.  I submit that disciplined unit testing has <br/>\nenough success stories that it&#39;s worth trying it to see if it makes <br/>\nthings better.<br/>\n<br/>\n    David Saff</div>",
