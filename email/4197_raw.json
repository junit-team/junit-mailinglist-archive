I would be a lot more convinced of the use of tes=\r\nts as a sole documentary\nagent if it were easy to use a tool to automatical=\r\nly jump to the appropriate\ntest for a method from the source code.\n\nSeems t=\r\no me that tests tend to evolve quite quickly and (maybe it&#39;s just me)\nhapha=\r\nzardly. One of the reasons I think that JUnit is so useful is that it\nis ve=\r\nry light-weight. If its usage was altered to structure it more, the\nsame pr=\r\noblems with syncing with the code would happen as with integrated\n(javadoc)=\r\n comments. \n\nJust my tuppence worth.\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tMi=\r\nke Clark [mailto:mike@...] \nSent:\t22 February 2002 15:26\nTo:\tjuni=\r\nt@yahoogroups.com\nSubject:\tRe: [junit] Re: JavaDocs\n\n&quot;Heath, Joseph&quot; wrote:=\r\n\n\n&gt; &gt; Then I&#39;ll leave you with this final thought:  If we design\n&gt; &gt; softwa=\r\nre by writing tests first, do the tests document the\n&gt; &gt; intention of the s=\r\noftware, or its implementation?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; But this assumes that our tests cov=\r\ner all possibilities of use, which can\n&gt; result in large test suites. I am =\r\nnot against this (in fact I prefer it),\n&gt; but often a few words of English =\r\n(or whatever language you read) is\n&gt; preferrable (IMHO) to a large test sui=\r\nte.\n&gt; I still have the test suite, however, for refactoring and code proof.=\r\n\n&gt;\n\nIf we don&#39;t write new code until we have a failing test, then the tests=\r\n\ncover all the methods.  I agree that they may not test all possible\nparame=\r\nters.  We&#39;ll maximize the testing investment by testing interesting\nboundar=\r\ny conditions and reasonable ranges for parameters.  Our code coverage\nwill =\r\nstill be very high.  And yes, we&#39;ll amass test suites quickly as our\ntests =\r\nbecome more comprehensive over time.\n\nIf a few words of English is necessar=\r\ny over and above the method signature,\nthen by all means add it to the docu=\r\nmentation.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; I would still say that that the tests document examples of =\r\nthe intention,\n&gt; rather than the intention itself. These examples may be a =\r\ncomplete set or\n&gt; may not be, often just the critical subset.\n&gt;\n\nAgreed.  E=\r\nxamples of intention and intention draw closer together the more\nwe use tes=\r\nt-first design.  Nevertheless, we&#39;re documenting intention rather\nthan impl=\r\nementation.\n\nGood points - thanks!\n\nMike\n\n--\nMike Clark\nClarkware Consultin=\r\ng, Inc.\nhttp://www.clarkware.com\n720.851.2014\n\n\n\n\nTo unsubscribe from this =\r\ngroup, send an email to:\njunit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n \n\nYour use of Y=\r\nahoo!
