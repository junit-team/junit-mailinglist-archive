(The\n&gt; test ran perfectly until the one ahead of it was added. The\n&gt; debugger then showed that the error flag was set when\n&gt; running the code.)\n&gt; \n&gt; To solve the problem, I added this method, and invoked it at\n&gt; the beginning of each test method:\n&gt;   protected void init() {\n&gt;     commentMerge.errorHandler = new CommentMergeErrorHandler();\n&gt;     testWriter = new StringWriter();\n&gt;     commentMerge.setWriter(testWriter);\n&gt;   }\n&gt; \n&gt; The tests are now working, but it looks to me like setup() isn&#39;t being\n&gt; run for each test method.\n\nIt sounds like there may be a static (i.e. class variable) somewhere\nthat is persisting that setting between tests.\n\nDave\n\n\n",
