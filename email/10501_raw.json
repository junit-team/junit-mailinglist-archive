I would search the archives of \nthis \n&gt; group for &quot;Parameterized Test Case&quot;.\n\nIt is similar I think.  Perhaps what I should do is mention more \nabout how I am allowed to access the data because of the way the \nplatform hides the actual implentation.\n\nUnfortunately, it&#39;s not as easy as just grabbing rows.  I get an \nobject which represents a file batch.  Then I can walk through that \nbatch to grab each record using a singleton on the batch object.  \nEach record is what I ultimately want to test upon.  The only way to \nget to a record is through a batch.\n\nIdeally, I want to be able to run these tests on any batch which are \nreferenced by an ID set at load time.  Ultimately, when a client \nchanges something, I want to be sure they didn&#39;t break the rules that \nwere used to extract the data.\n\nThe way I envision it, is you grab a batch, then iterate through the \nbatch getting each record object.  Once you&#39;ve gotten the object, you \nthen run your series of unit tests on that object.  YOu can check \nthat data is still there, to verifying that the JSP page that \naccesses this object contains everything that it is supposed to.  The \none thing to note is that the record is not a row, it&#39;s a BLOB which \ncan be accessed through accessor objects to get the data. \n\nThis is what I meant by cascading down.  My input is just the batch \nID, and I need to use that to get what I really want to test which \nare the records associated with that batch. \n\nWhat I&#39;m seeing in your post, is that I may be a bit too \nambitious/backwards. :)  Perhaps I need to send the batch into the \ntest and then iterate through each record rather than iterate through \neach record and pass it into each test.\n\nI was asking about where I might place the code to open and close the \nDB connection so I don&#39;t lose the connection while I&#39;m trying to \nulimately get to the record.  I don&#39;t want to open and close the \nconnection for each record. :)\n\nYou are quite correct that the complications come from the \napplication...I have written some basic jUnit tests over the past \nmonth.\n\nI just want to fit within the jUnit framework as much as possible.  \nAnother collegue wrote some code to test the web end, which used \njUnit and httpUnit, but he proceeded to overload every assert method \nand write one giant testThis method within which you called methods \nto test.  Seemed to really defeat the purpose of testing with the \njUnit framework, and sent me on this mission to find a better way.  \n\nI don&#39;t know if this makes any more sence..but hopefully it helps to \nclarify.\n\n\n\n",
