B. Rainsberger wrote: \n&gt; I disagree. Model objects representing values should be transparent, a la &quot;Naked Objects&quot;. They should let the Model objects containing business logic &quot;do with them what they may&quot;. There is a tendency in OOP to pretend there is behavior where there is no behavior. I think that is a mistake. Some objects in the system are just bags of data. I think public fields should do nicely there. Ward Cunningham has been experimenting with ignoring the prevaling paranoia against public data. I haven&#39;t seen him write anything on it yet, but it&#39;s good to test long-standing &quot;rules&quot;.\n\nI agree with that when it is applied to &quot;data structures,&quot; the naked\nobjects you refer to, but not behavioral objects.  I don&#39;t think you\nwere applying it to the latter, I just wanted to be clear.\n\n&gt; One counterexample is an object with 20 fields. Perhaps 20 set methods is clearer, at least in a language like Java with positional parameters. (In Smalltalk it&#39;s exactly the same, so it doesn&#39;t matter.) Should an object have 20 fields? Perhaps not, but some do. It is not clear that breaking that 20-field objects into four 5-field objects is any better.\n\nA twist on that... If that object needs to have 20 fields (which I don&#39;t\nbelieve it does) you can group fields together into other objects such\nthat this object is a wrapper on 5 others, each with 4 fields.  The data\nis still in one place, but it&#39;s creation is much less cumbersome and you\ncan create it in a sane state.\n\n=jason\n\n\n",
