I&#39;d \nlike to make the filename configurable, not hardcoded, so that\nthe test can be run with different inputs.  The test is also more \nportable this way, with the file not having to have a specific path \nthat is hardcoded. Anyway, how do I get that argument into JUnit, \nparticularly when running thru the GUI?  I&#39;ve heard some people say \nthat the only way to do this is via system properties set at the \ncommand line invocation of the test runner, but I was hoping there \nmight be another way.\n\nRelated to this, what is the best practice for sharing properties \namong tests? That is, suppose we were able to get that filename \nproperty into the test execution - how would all the different test \ncases know about it?   One way would be for all the TestCases to \nsubclass some other TestCase subclass that had the filename set on it \nas a static property.  But this seems a little hacked. Is there a \nbest practice for this?\n\nThanks,\nNoah Green\n\n\n\n",
