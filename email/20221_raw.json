If you have a class that uses pure JUnit 4 style, then you can\nrun ind=\r\nividual test methods without getting the &quot;Unrooted Test&quot; problem.\nIn other =\r\nwords, don&#39;t extend TestCase (or a subclass of TestCase).\n\nIn my own case, =\r\neven though I thought I was using annotations to mark my\n@Test methods, Ecl=\r\nipse was using the JUnit 3 compatibility mode.\nEclipse&#39;s test runner insist=\r\ned to run all methods whose names start with\n&quot;test&quot;.\n\nTo follow up to a few=\r\n other posts:\n\nDavid Saff wrote:\n&gt; Did the first class have a suite() metho=\r\nd or @RunWith annotation?\n\nNo.  Neither.  It doesn&#39;t seem to be related to =\r\ntest suites.\n\n\nAyub wrote:\n&gt; We are using classes that extend TestCase. We =\r\ncant use the \n&gt; new Junit4 annotations because we are dependant on code in =\r\n\n&gt; the parent classes.\n\nWe had the same issue.  However, we created a new p=\r\narent class that has\nall the useful code the old parent did, but doesn&#39;t in=\r\nherit from\nTestCase.  Now we&#39;re all switched over to doing things the new w=\r\nay,\nwhich makes it easier to use Eclipse and JUnit together.\n\nJoakim Ohlrog=\r\nge wrote:\n&gt; I have managed to cause unrooted tests earlier in my \n&gt; RSpec-J=\r\nUnit hack. Based on that experience an &quot;unrooted test&quot; \n&gt; is a test that is=\r\n run without having been declared previously \n&gt; by the runner (in my case I=\r\n had to fix my runner \n&gt; implementation that was, no doubt, not behaving ac=\r\nording to \n&gt; spec). It would probably not hurt to ask this question in an \n=\r\n&gt; Eclipse forum aswell, it seems that exlipse single-test \n&gt; runner is doin=\r\ng something that is not quite correct.\n\nI think you&#39;re right about the Ecli=\r\npse test runner not being quite\ncorrect.  But I&#39;m not on any Eclipse forums=\r\n, and I&#39;m skeptical they\nwould fix the problem anyhow since it&#39;s been there=\r\n for years without\n(apparently) too many complaints.  Plus, the workaround =\r\nof refactoring\nour tests to use pure JUnit 4 is working, and is good enough=\r\n for me.\n\n\nCheers,\nTodd.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: junit@y=\r\nahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On \n&gt; Behalf Of Bradley, Todd=\r\n\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, December 18, 2007 4:14 PM\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; S=\r\nubject: RE: [junit] what&#39;s an &quot;Unrooted Test&quot; and why can&#39;t \n&gt; I find anyth=\r\ning online about\n&gt; \n&gt; I had a few minutes to look into this over lunch toda=\r\ny.  What \n&gt; I learned is that when I had a test case that was a subclass \n&gt;=\r\n of TestCase (to be specific, my test case was a subclass of a \n&gt; subclass =\r\nof TestCase), I had the &quot;Unrooted Test&quot; problem.  \n&gt; When I made a test cas=\r\ne in a new project from scratch that \n&gt; didn&#39;t extend TestCase but only use=\r\nd @Test annotations, \n&gt; Eclipse didn&#39;t run the unrooted tests.\n&gt; \n&gt; When I =\r\nget some more time, I want to dig into it more and try \n&gt; to figure out why=\r\n this is the case.  But I&#39;m stuck in backlog \n&gt; estimation for the next 3 d=\r\nays, and then it&#39;s Christmas.

The results are shown in a tree, and the \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; tests I didn&#39;t ask to be run are all under a node called \n&gt; &quot;Unrooted \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Tests [Runner: JUnit 4]&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; So, I figured there must be some=\r\n simple explanation, and \n&gt; immediately\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; did a Google search. And i=\r\nt found nothing on topic. So I searched \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the Eclipse documentation an=\r\nd website for &quot;unrooted \n&gt; tests&quot; and again\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; got nothing. So I sear=\r\nched on this Yahoo Group&#39;s message archive, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and again found nothing.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Am I the only person in the world who has ever had this \n&gt; pro=\r\nblem with\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; running a single test method from Eclipse? Or am I \n&gt; se=\r\narching for the\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; web&#39;s most suppressed secret?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Someone =\r\nplease tell me you&#39;ve seen this problem too! And why is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; there nothin=\r\ng written up about these mysterious &quot;Unrooted \n&gt; Tests&quot; in \n&gt; &gt; &gt; all the p=\r\nlaces I looked?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Cheers,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Todd.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ----\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; .=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been remov=\r\ned]\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo!
