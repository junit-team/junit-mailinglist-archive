The essential tests are the\n&gt;  &gt; ones that drove my design decisions, while the coverage tests are the\n&gt;  &gt; ones that I added to protect against future refactorings.\n&gt; \n&gt; That restatement is interesting. I&#39;ve thought in the past that I&#39;d\n&gt; like at least three different organizational schemes for my tests:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) By class tested\n&gt; 2) By functionality tested\n&gt; 3) By order of creation*\n&gt; \n&gt; You bring out possibly yet another:\n&gt; \n&gt; 4) By intent\n&gt; \n&gt; Perhaps 3 and 4 are similar. I&#39;ve thought in the past it should be\n&gt; possible to do all of this by thinking hard about how I lay out my\n&gt; tests, but I now think that, at least, 3 and 4 lead to a different\n&gt; organization than 1 and 2. Do you think that JUnit could help with\n&gt; this, or would the first step be in an IDE?\n\nI could imagine annotating tests with the information /in theory/, but I \ncouldn&#39;t imagine stopping to bother to do it while test-driving. As I \nwrote in another message, this idea begins to feel like a teaching tool \nto me, rather than a technique for professional practice.\n-- \nJ. B.
