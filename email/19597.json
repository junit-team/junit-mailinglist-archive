I can&#39;t envision a single project that big. I&#39;d<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; want to ask the people on that project two questions:<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; 1. Why such reliance on slow tests?<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; 2. Should we break this up into about four subprojects?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Good questions. I&#39;d give you my own answers, but I doubt<br/>\n&gt; they are too interesting to this group, and they&#39;re definitely<br/>\n&gt; far off topic of the conversation about how to group tests<br/>\n&gt; together.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t agree with that last statement. If we had fewer slow tests, or <br/>\nif we partitioned the projects (perhaps) more appropriately, then we <br/>\nmight not want to group tests, which is spot on topic.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  &gt; Is it really a good idea to have a test suite so long that<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; you can&#39;t run it overnight between when people leave for work<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; and when they come back in the morning? How do you do a daily build?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We have several test suites. The unit tests run every night<br/>\n&gt; and give one level of confidence. And then some system test<br/>\n&gt; suites run each night to give more confidence about different<br/>\n&gt; things each night. In total, it takes 2 nights, but there is<br/>\n&gt; usable feedback each night.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not saying it can&#39;t be done; I&#39;m asking whether it should be done.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  &gt; No question there. If you&#39;ve managed to reduce the feedback<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; cycle from 6 weeks to 2 days, then that&#39;s great work. Still,<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; I find a 2-day cycle quite long. I imagine you have bigger<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; problems to face right now, so you&#39;re right to face them and<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; not this one, but all things being equal, I wouldn&#39;t be<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; satisfied with a 2-day cycle, and I certainly wouldn&#39;t design<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; JUnit to optimize for the case of the 2-day test cycle.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Yes, that&#39;s one reason I don&#39;t think my own stories are<br/>\n&gt; overly relevant. I&#39;m not in the &quot;sweet spot&quot; of users<br/>\n&gt; of JUnit, as I&#39;m using it for both unit tests and for<br/>\n&gt; system tests. And, while I know there are other people<br/>\n&gt; in my same boat, we&#39;re in the minority.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not usually interested in articles that say the same old thing in <br/>\nthe same old context. I&#39;m usually interested in articles that add <br/>\nsomething new, or share stories about great improvement, like I imagine <br/>\nyours would.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  &gt; But that&#39;s great work. I&#39;m impressed. Have you written about<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; what you do differently between the 6-week cycle and the<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; 2-day cycle?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Only on my resume. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>So why not as a weblog entry?<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ.
