Start with &quot;fewer lines of code&quot; as a measure of\n&gt;  simplicity. When you get to the first counterexample, add the next\n&gt;  ingredient...\n\nThank you for your comment,\n\nAre you talking about total lines of code or lines of code in one\nplace? In the example I posted (the silly one) there are obviously\nfewer lines of code in the executeCommand method in the second example\nbut the total number of lines will likely be more (counting the total\nnumber of lines in the project).\n\nThe example is not the best I couldn&#39;t think of a really good one,\nperhaps it would make more sense if the command was executed like\nthis:\n\ncommand.execute(this.robotController);\n\nOr something, I have my preference but I don&#39;t know if it is the\nsimple one in everyones book. I think it can become more complicated\nthan just counting lines fo code to know what is simple but I agree\nthat it is a good start.\n\n",
