So if all it\ndoes is execute a command with an execute() method,\nthen that&#39;s the only method on the Class.\n\nThe reason I like the Class + ClassHelper pattern is\nbecause\nI&#39;m treating the ClassHelper as a utility library that\nis specific to Class.\n\nIt makes it clear that ClassHelper is there to assist\nClass and only Class.\n\nThen once I&#39;m done creating Class and ClassHelper, I\nlook for ways to put ClassHelper methods in a Utility\nlibrary.\n\nI find this helpful when coding command objects for\ninstance.\n\nThe Command Class only has a single method execute().\n\nI code a helper with lots of little methods that help\nthe command do its job.\n\nThen later on myself, and others, working with the\ncommands can look for opportunities to centralize the\nHelper methods in a utility library.\n\nCheers,\n- Ole\n\n\n\n--- Yagiz Erkan &lt;yagizerkan@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; So, what&#39;s the advantage of having a all-public\n&gt; MyClassHelper when you can\n&gt; turn MyClass&#39; methods public? I mean if you&#39;re doing\n&gt; this only for\n&gt; testability, why not to simply turn the private\n&gt; methods of a class into\n&gt; protected or package visible?\n&gt; \n&gt;  - Yagiz Erkan -\n&gt;  http://blog.decaresystems.ie\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been\n&gt; removed]\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n \n____________________________________________________________________________________\nTV dinner still cooling? \nCheck out &quot;Tonight&#39;s Picks&quot; on Yahoo!
