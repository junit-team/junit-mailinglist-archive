Those<br/>\ntests will take longer to run, but on the other hand they give you<br/>\nmore freedom to refactor the code &quot;under the hood&quot; once you get it<br/>\nunder test, and they will verify that the functionality of the product<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t change over time. A risk with unit tests is that they tie down<br/>\nthe code, and for every change you want to make you have to change<br/>\nbundles of unit tests.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would go for an extensive system test suite, and unit tests for the<br/>\nmore complicated lower-level refactorings of important pieces of code.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<br/>\nDaniel<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Nov 19, 2007 1:58 PM, Joel Neely &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:joel.neely@...\">joel.neely@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I highly recommend _Working_Effectively_with_Legacy_Code_ by Michael<br/>\n&gt; Feathers.<br/>\n&gt;  (His definition of &quot;legacy code&quot; is simply &quot;code without tests&quot;,<br/>\n&gt;  regardless of when it<br/>\n&gt;  was written, or by whom.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  That book does an outstanding job of discussing how to get code under test.<br/>\n&gt;  The first section, &quot;The Mechanics of Change&quot;, describes goals and<br/>\n&gt; techniques<br/>\n&gt;  of unit testing, along with general strategies for getting tests<br/>\n&gt;  around code that<br/>\n&gt;  wasn&#39;t designed to be tested.
