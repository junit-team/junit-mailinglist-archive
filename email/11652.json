As you point out, this format works well for assertEquals() although we tend to use a lot of assertTrue.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy standardizing our testcase format, and specifying a defined expected result, and loading the actual, this also allows us to reduce many of the asserts to<br/>\n<br/>\nassertEquals(&quot;E: &quot; + expected + &quot; G: &quot; + actual, expected, actual);<br/>\n<br/>\nof course the same test could be <br/>\n<br/>\nassertTrue(&quot;E: &quot; + expected + &quot; G: &quot; + actual, expected == actual);<br/>\nor <br/>\nassertTrue(&quot;E: &quot; + expected + &quot; G: &quot; + actual, expected.equals(actual));<br/>\n<br/>\ndepending on the data type.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince we don&#39;t have to think much about the format it allows us to build the tests fairly quickly.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLike any attempt to have a regular format, it can lead to inefficiencies. But we generally feel that the tradeoff is worth it. It also makes it much easier to bring someone new up to speed - they can worry less about the syntax of the failure message and more about the content.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLike I said, we are pretty un-sophisticated, but it seems to work for us.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJim<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJ.
