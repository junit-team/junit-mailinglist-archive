If<br/>\n&gt;&gt; you practiced TDD, then you would not write, &quot;...likely I also <br/>\n&gt;needed<br/>\n&gt;&gt; to add something to the corresponding test code.&quot; If you practiced <br/>\n&gt;TDD,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; you would:<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; 1. Write a test<br/>\n&gt;&gt; 2. Watch it fail<br/>\n&gt;&gt; 3. Make it pass<br/>\n&gt;&gt; 4. Refactor<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Consider it&#39;s a value object, and I simply need to add a property, <br/>\n&gt;along with a getter and setter.  I don&#39;t write tests for that <br/>\n&gt;everytime.  (We have a BaseTestCase with a checkProperties() method <br/>\n&gt;that automatically does this for us via introspection.)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Certainly not. That&#39;s simple enough not to break on its own 99.9%<br/>\npercent of the time... Can we match this back to the question?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; It&#39;s the last step that leads you to see that your TestCase is doing<br/>\n&gt;&gt; too much is a candidate to be factored into smaller objects.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; I have worked on a project where test cases quickly became <br/>\n&gt;difficult to<br/>\n&gt;&gt; understand because of the massive amount of test setup -- mostly<br/>\n&gt;&gt; priming a database with known data. None of our attempts to solve <br/>\n&gt;the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; problem were entirely satisfying and the team did not agree to let <br/>\n&gt;me<br/>\n&gt;&gt; test the business logic entirely separately from the persistence<br/>\n&gt;&gt; mechanism. The result was this: after not seeing a certain TestCase <br/>\n&gt;for<br/>\n&gt;&gt; a few days it would take 10 minutes or so to remember or re-<br/>\n&gt;understand<br/>\n&gt;&gt; what was going on. Also, changes to the test setup had cascading<br/>\n&gt;&gt; effects on the rest of the tests. If I had just created a new <br/>\n&gt;TestCase,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; I could have factored the real commonality up and kept the details<br/>\n&gt;&gt; separate. That would certainly have helped, and this explains why I<br/>\n&gt;&gt; have adopted that technique as a habit.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I have a similar problem on my current project.  I&#39;m writing a <br/>\n&gt;persistence layer.  Loosely speaking, my tests take an object graph, <br/>\n&gt;persist it, read it from the persistence layer, and validate it&#39;s <br/>\n&gt;structure.  The important thing is, and this is where we share a <br/>\n&gt;common problem, there is a lot of setup involved.  In my case, to <br/>\n&gt;construct an object graph everytime a test is run.  My approach was <br/>\n&gt;to create a seperate class (named DAOTestFixture, of all things) <br/>\n&gt;which constructs and contains the object graph.  I simply create an <br/>\n&gt;instance of this class from the setUp() method in all my DAO <br/>\n&gt;TestCases.  At this point, I have about eight DAOs and corresponding <br/>\n&gt;TestCases that reuse this test fixture.  Plus, I get to use inner <br/>\n&gt;classes, reap all the benefits, and there is nothing to stop me from <br/>\n&gt;refactoring those TestCases into seperate inner classes should I want <br/>\n&gt;to in the future.  If I ever find I need to share a TestCase across <br/>\n&gt;classes (would this ever happen?), I suppose I could refactor it into <br/>\n&gt;it&#39;s own freestanding class.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>So you compose text fixtures, rather than extending them. There&#39;s no<br/>\nlaw that says a TestCase must descend from a fixture or implement the<br/>\nfixture itself, but from an organizational standpoint it is nicer for<br/>\nthe reader if each TestCase were a separate fixture, as long as the<br/>\nfixture is not tiny.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s like anything else: if you roll up three tiny things into one big<br/>\nthing, that may be no problem; but if you roll up three big things into<br/>\none even bigger thing, bad things tend to happen.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; &gt;Now, based on those very simple real world requirements, just <br/>\n&gt;exactly <br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;what is it that makes your approach so superior that you will <br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;immediately discount all others as inadequate?<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; At this point, I feel that you are being unnecessarily antagonistic.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Rudeness objection. Please tone it down.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Oh, but it&#39;s my approach that was attacked with a groundless claim.  <br/>\n&gt;Sorry for wondering why.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I will not stop you from wondering why, but I can ask you to act less<br/>\nlike an ass when you point out that you don&#39;t agree. This might work:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Now, based on those very simple real-world requirements, it looks like<br/>\nmy approach does the job. What is there in your approach that I am<br/>\nmissing with mine?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt may be that Dave was describing a general-purpose, one-size-fits-all<br/>\napproach that could be optimized in your specific case. If you ask him<br/>\ncivilly, I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll respond. If you feel he was being uncivil<br/>\ntowards you, then be the bigger man and tell him so, civilly. I missed<br/>\nhis part of the exchange, so I can&#39;t say.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; &gt;I know, I know, it&#39;s in the newsletter and the forthcoming book.  <br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;That&#39;s fabulous.  But you&#39;re preaching to the TDD converted here <br/>\n&gt;and <br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;we have found our own ways, based first on the information <br/>\n&gt;currently <br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;available and second on our own experience.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &lt;snip /&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; Given that your above statement (way up there) indicates that you do<br/>\n&gt;&gt; not practice TDD, but rather that you do something else that is<br/>\n&gt;&gt; somewhere similar to TDD, I am not sure that you can directly use <br/>\n&gt;your<br/>\n&gt;&gt; experience to argue either in favor or against TDD. I apologize if <br/>\n&gt;that<br/>\n&gt;&gt; is harsh, but I believe it is objectively true. I make no value<br/>\n&gt;&gt; judgement: do what you do if it works, but please do not call it <br/>\n&gt;TDD.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I don&#39;t see how you could have ever concluded that I don&#39;t do TDD <br/>\n&gt;based on my statment above.  Definitely a stretch ...<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, you didn&#39;t argue against it in your reply after the part in which<br/>\nI wrote it, so I assumed that you at least didn&#39;t violently disagree.<br/>\nIf you write code first, then &quot;likely&quot; add tests, why is that TDD? I<br/>\ndon&#39;t think it is.<br/>\n<br/>\nJ. B.
