I believe the class I&#39;m trying to <br/>\ntest will be extending Applet, if that helps.  As far as which <br/>\nJavaScript environment...not sure I understand what you mean by that, <br/>\nbut I&#39;ll probably be targeting IE 5.5+ and NS 6.0+ as far as browser <br/>\ncompatibility goes.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to which JSUnit I downloaded...I didn&#39;t know there were that <br/>\nmany...I&#39;ll have to go take a look at them. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\n-Eric<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In junit@y..., &quot;Schaible, Jorg&quot; &lt;joerg.schaible@g...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Hi Eric,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Has anyone written unit tests trying to use the <br/>\n&gt; &gt; netscape.javascript.JSObject?

And, if you&#39;ve used JSUnit to <br/>\nwrite <br/>\n&gt; &gt; tests for a class using JSObject, please drop me some hints. :)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Can you describe exactly what you want to test and which JavaScript<br/>\n&gt; environment you use? Also *which* JsUnit did you consider? <br/>\nXprogramming.com<br/>\n&gt; lists 4 different.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Regards,<br/>\n&gt; Jorg </span></blockquote></div>",
