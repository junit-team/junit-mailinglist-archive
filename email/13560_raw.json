If all you test is public/protected\n&gt; methods, you will miss an opportunity to catch a bug in a very fundamental\n&gt; piece of your code and you will be wasting time looking for it.\n\nIt has been my experience that most programmers, including myself, write \ntoo much code. That is, we write code covering cases that simply cannot \nhappen. The more code you have the more bugs you have. Removing code is \none of the surest ways to remove bugs, not to mention save time.\n\nThe discipline required to write all tests exclusively through public \ninterfaces often reveals that the code is not in fact behaving the way \none thinks it is. Code is not activated that seems like it should be. \nCode paths don&#39;t flow the way one expects. Sometimes the mere act of \ntrying to test a particular piece of private code and failing reveals \nthe bugs.\n\nIt is critical, though, that you use code coverage tools like Cobertura \nand Clover to actually see what&#39;s being tested. That way you know \nwhether or not you&#39;re actually testing the inner, private parts of your \ncode. What&#39;s really interesting is when you discover that a piece of \ncode you thought was being tested isn&#39;t. That discovery often reveals a \nbug that the test themselves weren&#39;t finding.\n\nFinally, a separate reason for limiting the tests to the public (and \nprotected) interfaces is the same as the reason for keeping some code \nprivate in the first place. This allows you to change algorithms and \nimplementations freely without worrying about breaking the tests. More \nimportantly, it tells you that if you make a change and the tests break, \nit really is a bug. When you&#39;re testing the private parts directly, \nmajor changes are expected to break tests and require the tests to be \nmodified. Thus it stops being obvious whether test breakage signals a \nregression or a test problem.\n\nIn my test suites, I test only what I&#39;m willing to guarantee. The tests \nbecome contracts. They are even more than the API documentation the \npromise of what my software will support. And I&#39;m only willing to \npromise to support the public and protected APIs.\n\nIt is worth noting that most of my work, especially the most tested \nparts of my work, takes the form of libraries rather than client or \nserver applications. Possibly the distinction between unit and \nacceptance testing is a little weaker here. Many end user applications \ndon&#39;t really provide any published API at all. Nonetheless I suspect \nthat even in purely internal APIs it makes sense to distinguish between \nwhat&#39;s guaranteed to be supported and what&#39;s merely a means to an end \nthat may change as necessary to optimize or refactor a code base. Tests \nshould only touch the stable, guaranteed parts.\n\n-- \nElliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nXML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim\n\n\n\n",
