But I don&#39;t\nhink =\r\nyou can throw assertion errors in the shutdown hook.\n\nAnother idea would be=\r\n to capture System.out or the logging-stream and\nverify in your tests, that=\r\n no exception is in the log/out-stream, as\nthis is (from what I understood)=\r\n closer to what you really want to\ntest for.\n\nI do the runBefore the same w=\r\nay as you said. The only difference: I\nput the init-code as @BeforeClass in=\r\n a superclass and my tests simply\ninherit from it.\n\nWhen you use eclipse, y=\r\nou probably don&#39;t build explicit suites, so you\ncan&#39;t use @BeforeClass and =\r\n@AfterClass on a suite easily.\nThis would work with\n@RunWith(Suite.class)\n@=\r\nSuiteClasses({Class1.class, Class2.class, ....})\npublic void AllTests {\n@Be=\r\nforeClass\npublic static void runBeforeAllTests() {\n}\n\n@AfterClass\npublic st=\r\natic void runAfterAllTests() {\n}\n}\n\nYou could look into cpSuite, which allo=\r\nws this, I think, and still\nruns all tests automatically.\n\nGreetings,\n   Ma=\r\nlte\n\n2009/11/19 stolsvik &lt;online@...&gt;:\n&gt; I need some way to run a =\r\ncertain test after all other tests.\n&gt;\n&gt; I run my tests in Eclipse, and do n=\r\not yet have a build system outside of it. I understand that had I done this=\r\n programmatically, I could have attached a RunListener, implementing the te=\r\nstRunFinished(Result) method.\n&gt;\n&gt; Is there any way to achieve a similar eff=\r\nect within the JUnit runner in Eclipse?\n&gt;\n&gt; Rationale: I have actual unit t=\r\nests, then bigger tests, then full-fledged &quot;integration tests&quot; or whatever =\r\none call them, where I take up my entire application-local server thingy an=\r\nd process a bunch of items, letting JUnit check after the dust settles whet=\r\nher the items was processed correctly. However, the internals are multi thr=\r\neaded, and also, this being a Swing app, lots of Runnables are sent over to=\r\n the EDT. This is all good.\n&gt;\n&gt; However, I&#39;ve sometimes seen that a thread =\r\ncrashes (uncaught exception), without this being noticed by any of the test=\r\ns running (I&#39;ve e.g. seen a ConcurrentModificationException take down the E=\r\nDT, without having a clue as to why I got that - and the next event posted =\r\njust brings up a new EDT, so I get a green bar, but with an uncaught error)=\r\n. What I&#39;d want to achieve, is to install an uncaught exception handler, an=\r\nd then, as a final step to ALL permutations of tests (e.g. both for a singl=\r\ne unit test, and also for the project-wide test run), run a test that check=\r\ns whether any thread-killing exception was caught by the handler, and if so=\r\n, fails the run. (I&#39;d throw the exception that was caught, and in any case =\r\nalso log-dump any and all such exceptions).\n&gt;\n&gt; (As a very similar question=\r\n, I&#39;d also like to have a &quot;before any tests&quot; thing, like the RunListener.te=\r\nstRunStarted(Description) method, where I could set up logging. Now I do th=\r\nat by letting ALL tests have a static block that calls a specific static me=\r\nthod which has a static boolean that tells whether the log system already i=\r\ns set up. This also works just nicely, but is a hassle nevertheless. Howeve=\r\nr, it is not possible, as I see it, to solve the above question in the same=\r\n manner.)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
