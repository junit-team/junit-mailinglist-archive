If your class implements three\ninterfaces, then you have three test cases for that class, each a\nsubclass of the corresponding abstract test for each interface. Run them\nall. No law says you must have one test case per production class, and\nin fact, you probably shouldn&#39;t!\n\n\n\nIt&#39;s a simple matter of keeping the test tree as understandable as the\nsource it is testing. If there are too many test classes testing a\nsingle source class, it become difficult to look at a package for the\nfirst time and understand what is going on. The link that Paolo sent on\nan earlier post has a link showing the use of inner classes to organize\nthe abstract test cases. The benefit is that I can enter a package, look\nfor a single class WidgetTest.java and be able to track back all of the\ntests associated with Widget.java.\n\n\n&gt;Also, only some objects implement the equals method. These\n&gt;I have a standard set of tests to ensure that null and a few other\n&gt;scenarios are handled correctly (as well as the hashcode / equals\n&gt;relationship). I would like to have these standard tests available for\n&gt;different objects without having to rewrite them all the time.\n\nGSBase&#39;s EqualsTester for testing equals(). JUnit-addons also has\nsomething, but I can&#39;t remember the name of it.\n\n\n\nThanks, I&#39;ll check it out.\n\n\n\nJ. B.
