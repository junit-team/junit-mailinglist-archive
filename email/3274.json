How do I write test cases for<br/>\nevent driven program ?<br/>\nFor e.g. I have a class A.<br/>\nThis has three functions <br/>\n1. public boolean ConnectURL(); <br/>\nThis function connects to a particular URL and loads the details onto the<br/>\nscreen. If this is successful, it returns true else false. <br/>\n2. public void Initialisation();<br/>\nThis functions initializes some parameters<br/>\n3. public boolean Save(Object obj);<br/>\nThis function saves the details on the screen and if successful, it returns<br/>\ntrue, else false.<br/>\n<br/>\n In my test class, I will be writing test methods for all these functions.<br/>\n1. Do I need to write a test method for the second function that is just<br/>\ndoing some initialization. If so, how will I write that ? <br/>\n2. For the first function, I will write a test method as follows<br/>\npublic boolean testConnectURl() {<br/>\n\tA obj1;<br/>\n\tboolean  b = obj1.ConnectURL();<br/>\n\t/// How do I write an assert statement after this ?<br/>\n}<br/>\n<br/>\nI have seen the archive of all the messages but I am not clear on how I<br/>\nwrite test classes for event driven programs.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\n<br/>\nSowmya<br/>\n -----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: \tEric Vought [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:evought@...\">evought@...</a>] <br/>\nSent:\tFriday, November 09, 2001 10:45 PM<br/>\nTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject:\tRe: [junit] Inner Class, Even Driven Classes<br/>\n<br/>\nThe short answer is that they are usually tested in the same testcase as the<br/>\nenclosing class. Where the testcase are complex enough for a sepearte<br/>\ntestcase class to make sense, refactoring the inner class to the top level<br/>\nwill also typically make sense. For the long answer, I&#39;ll lay out a few<br/>\ncases for you and how they are handled in my experience.<br/>\nIf the class is a tightly coupled private utility, like an iterator or an<br/>\nevent adapter, these are typically tested in the test case for the class.<br/>\nIn the case of an event listener, whether the listener is implemented by an<br/>\nadapter or the class itself is a minor organizational detail. The important<br/>\nquestion is whether the event is dispatched correctly. With iterators, they<br/>\ntend to be very minor in functionality and extremely tightly coupled.<br/>\nIterators are therefore more of a special reference or psuedopod of the<br/>\nclass-under-test than a separate entity and are also tested in the same<br/>\ntestcase.<br/>\nSometimes, you use an inner class to define an interface that goes along<br/>\nwith it, such as defining static inner  classes to represent listeners for<br/>\nevents which only that class will generate. The example I have in front of<br/>\nme right now is a class called LogListener.MaskChangeListener. LogListener<br/>\naccepts logging events from a Logger for dispatch. A particular LogListener,<br/>\nhowever, only accepts events of a particular set of priorities (e.g. WARNING<br/>\nor above). A Logger wishes to avoid instantiating messages that will never<br/>\nbe processed, so it monitors the priority masks of its Listeners. It should<br/>\nbe obvious that MaskChangeListener is very specific to LogListener and<br/>\ntherefore may as well be a part of it.<br/>\nIn these cases, you have a base class or interface which will be implemented<br/>\nor extended by some other class. The general practice here is to create a<br/>\ntestcase for that base class (using a stub implementation) and then the<br/>\ntestcases for actual implementations can inherit your abstract testcase to<br/>\nensure that invariants are maintained. With the inner class situation,<br/>\nhowever, most of the eventual implementations will themselves be inner<br/>\nclasses (adapters) and therefore will not be tested as separate entities.<br/>\nFurther, there really aren&#39;t any invariants to be maintained beyond what the<br/>\ncompiler will verify for you- namely, that a method exists with that<br/>\nsignature in the implementing class. So, in this case, too, there isn&#39;t any<br/>\nspecial testing to be done.<br/>\nAs your inner class gets more complex- perhaps it is an abstract class with<br/>\nsome fields or concrete code- the case for doing a seperate testcase gets<br/>\nstronger, but so does the case for refactoring. Even if the inner class<br/>\nneeds access to private state which you don&#39;t wish to expose, the dependency<br/>\ncan probably be reduced through refactoring to the point where you can use<br/>\nsimple listeners and adapters to connect two top-level classes.<br/>\nThe borderline case I sometimes run into is an inner class representing a<br/>\nsouped up type-safe enumeration. The enumeration has methods to produce or<br/>\nparse a human-readable representation of a value and has some special code<br/>\nto handle serialization safely. If the enumeration is conceptually coupled<br/>\nto the enclosing class, it makes sense to leave it as an inner class.  There<br/>\nis *some* significant functionality to test (mostly looking for simple<br/>\ntyping errors), which is conceptually different from the functionality of<br/>\nthe top-level class and tends to clutter the testcase a little if included.<br/>\nI could see a case for breaking this out into multiple testcase if there<br/>\nwere a number of similar inner classes in the top-level class. Otherwise, I<br/>\nstill tend to keep all the tests in one container.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Fri, 9 Nov 2001 <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sowmya.srinivasan@...\">sowmya.srinivasan@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Hello<br/>\n&gt; I have just started using JUnit.<br/>\n&gt; I have a few queries.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 1.
