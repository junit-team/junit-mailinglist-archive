In general, Djkstra was wrong,<br/>\nit should have been &quot;float considered harmful&quot; for 99% of<br/>\nprogrammers and programs. Use of floating point<br/>\narithmetic is to be avoided because it is a bug farm.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is criminal to use floating point when you want to represent<br/>\nmoney, and in many other cases, fixed point is vastly<br/>\nsuperior. Clearly some subfields need it, engineering calculations,<br/>\nFFT, DSP, etc. But I&#39;ve been a professional developer<br/>\nfor over 30 years, and I&#39;ve only had two cases (each for only<br/>\na few months each) where using floating point was<br/>\nthe correct answer.<br/>\n<br/>\nProper numerical analysis and algorithms for floating point<br/>\nnumbers is an art, and there are many non-obvious problems.<br/>\nRapid/Extreme programming is not well suited to<br/>\nfloating point work (and double and even quad precision don&#39;t<br/>\naddress the fundamental problems.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have a choice, don&#39;t use float.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nPat Farrell<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.pfarrell.com/\">http://www.pfarrell.com/</a></div>",
