Yes looks like I need to have a servlet that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; can reload every 5 sec.  Assuming that I have such a servlet, what do\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I need to do to capture the results at some instance.  Right now I am\n&gt; &gt; &gt; using TestResult class to store the results and then passing them as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; response to the browser after all the test cases are run.  But in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; this case do I need to use TestListener interface and then use the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; addListener method of TestResult class.  Please let me know.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; That&#39;s a viable solution, probably not the only one though.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Have you tried JUnitServlet?\n&gt; \n&gt;     http://c2.com/cgi-bin/wiki?JunitServlet\n&gt; \n&gt; It claims that the HTML result page updates itself when the tests are\n&gt; finished.  I haven&#39;t tried it myself, but it looks like another possible\n&gt; solution.\n\nI think his hope is to have a TestRunner that updates a web page with its\nresults in real time, then he will have a servlet (or something else) that will\npoll the server every N seconds to simulate a realtime environment.  If that is\nthe case, I don&#39;t think JUnitServlet is a solution because it&#39;s a framework for\ntesting servelts.  Or am I wrong about its purpose?\n\n-jason\n\n=====\nJason Rogers\n[mailto: jacaetev@...]\n------------------------------\nKeep it simple...\n(1 Corinthians 2:2, Galatians 2:20, 6:14)\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nMake a great connection at Yahoo!
