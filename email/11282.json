Can I use it<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; in place of Clover?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Yes, you can use it in place of Clover (several<br/>\n&gt; account teams at my company have switched and I am<br/>\n&gt; getting emails from external users to the same effect<br/>\n&gt; as well). Of course, there will always be feature<br/>\n&gt; differences between source code instrumentation-based<br/>\n&gt; (Clover), bytecode instrumentation-based (EMMA), and<br/>\n&gt; JVMPI-based tools (many other commercial tools).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; No, EMMA has not been integrated into Maven (yet),<br/>\n&gt; although this has been much requested as soon as it<br/>\n&gt; was published outside of Trilogy. This feature will be<br/>\n&gt; implemented in near future (another developer is<br/>\n&gt; joining the project soon specifically to address this<br/>\n&gt; area) but I don&#39;t think this is a gate for starting to<br/>\n&gt; use EMMA now.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, for my purposes, code coverage isn&#39;t /so/ important. I would only <br/>\nuse it, at this point, as integrated with Maven. Perhaps it&#39;s not so <br/>\ndifficult to do. I&#39;d just have to try it out, I suppose.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt any rate, thanks for sharing. I&#39;m sure some of our members will find <br/>\nit quite interesting.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
