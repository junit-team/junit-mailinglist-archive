My apologies if \nanyone receives this twice.\n\nI searched the archives but wasn&#39;t able to find what I was looking \nfor.  If this has already been discussed a pointer to the thread \nwould be appreciated.\n\nI want to write a JUnit test to verify that an event is generated \nwhen I call a method.  It seems to work but I have two questions.  \nDoes anyone see any problems that might arise in this test?  Is there \na better/more prefered way to do this?\n\nHere is the code/pseudocode of the test case I came up with:\n\npublic void testEventGenerated()\n{\n     MyClassThatFiresAnEvent myClass = new MyClassThatFiresAnEvent();\n\n     final Thread currentThread = Thread.currentThread();\n\n     myClass.addMyEventListener(new MyEventListener()\n     {\n         public void somethingHappened(MyEvent event)\n         {\n             currentThread.interrupt();\n         }\n     });\n                \n     Thread thread = new Thread()\n     {\n         public void run()\n         {\n             myClass.callMethodThatFiresTheEvent();\n         }\n     };\n     thread.start();\n        \n     try\n     {\n         currentThread.sleep(5000);\n         fail(&quot;Timed out waiting for the event.&quot;);\n     }\n     catch(InterruptedException ie)\n     {\n         System.out.println(&quot;Expect this exception&quot;);\n     }\n}\n\nThanks,\nKris\n\n\n\n",
