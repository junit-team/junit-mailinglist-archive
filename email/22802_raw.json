However, JUnit pro=\r\nvides you\nwith a lot of features which you would end up developing for your=\r\nself\nanyway.\n\nFor example, you will have many of these &quot;main&quot; methods which=\r\n will compare\nthe two values (the value which you expect and the actual val=\r\nue from your\nfunction). JUnit provides assertEquals methods for you. JUnit =\r\nalso gives you\nthe ability to organize your test cases into test classes an=\r\nd test suites.\nThere are a lot of tools which also utilize JUnit. For examp=\r\nle, JUnit is\nintegrated into many popular Java IDEs and works with most con=\r\ntinuous\nintegration environments (such as CruiseControl).\n\nIn other words, =\r\nif you write all your tests in your own main method, you\nwill probably find=\r\n yourself, slowly &quot;re-inventing&quot; all the features of\nJUnit. As JUnit advanc=\r\nes, you will be able to take advantage of the new\nfeatures which the commun=\r\nity provides. You also have access to the many\nother people who use JUnit a=\r\nnd who have experience writing unit tests.\n\nGood luck,\nDennis\n\n\n\nOn Mon, Ju=\r\nl 12, 2010 at 5:27 PM, dk &lt;dinesh_hem2000@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Why do w=\r\ne need to use JUnits?\n&gt; If we have to test any new class, we could create a=\r\n new class, inside that\n&gt; class we could declare a main() method and call t=\r\nhe function to be tested\n&gt; with the required arguments.\n&gt; Does using JUnits=\r\n provide any extra feature or additional functionality\n&gt; over this way of t=\r\nesting,i.e, declaring main() methods and testing?\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n[Non-text porti=\r\nons of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
