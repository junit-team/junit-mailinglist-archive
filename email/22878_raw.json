Please, pick one of the many volunteer=\r\ns and work with him/her to automate deployment to Maven Central. This will =\r\nliterally save 1000&#39;s of wasted hours for devs around the globe. (As someon=\r\ne else already stated, there is zero practical chance of breaking someone&#39;s=\r\n build when deploying a new release version.)\n\nMeanwhile I&#39;ve deployed the =\r\nlatest release versions of junit/junit-dep to my own Maven repo: http://m2r=\r\nepo.spockframwork.org/ext/junit. Also I&#39;ve set up a CI build that will cont=\r\ninually build and deploy the latest (4.9) snapshots to this repo. Hopefully=\r\n this will help some people who, like me, can&#39;t wait any longer for the lat=\r\nest JUnit versions to appear in Maven Central. The repo also hosts Hamcrest=\r\n 1.2, another important (and related) lib that isn&#39;t available from Central=\r\n.\n\nCheers,\nPeter\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, David Saff &lt;david@...&gt; wrot=\r\ne:\n&gt;\n&gt; On Tue, Aug 17, 2010 at 6:28 PM, pniederw &lt;pniederw@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nI&#39;ve noticed that JUnit includes an (outdated) version of Hamcrest. Will fu=\r\nture JUnit version continue to ship with Hamcrest?\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes, having made th=\r\nis decision, we&#39;ll stick to it until convinced it&#39;s\n&gt; doing more harm than =\r\ngood.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Do you have plans to update to Hamcrest 1.2 or higher?\n&gt; \n&gt; Un=\r\nfortunately, the last time we looked at the typing changes in\n&gt; Hamcrest 1.=\r\n2, we found that we couldn&#39;t automatically upgrade people\n&gt; without changin=\r\ng compiling tests into non-compiling tests, and, if I\n&gt; remember, in a few =\r\npathological cases, passing tests into failing\n&gt; tests.  We guessed that of=\r\n people who used the hamcrest features\n&gt; bundled with JUnit, there were mor=\r\ne that would be hurt by a version\n&gt; change than would be helped by it, so w=\r\ne&#39;ve stayed here.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Why is there no junit-dep anymore, i.e. how are we=\r\n supposed to use JUnit with Hamcrest 1.2?\n&gt; \n&gt; junit-dep has been up on git=\r\nhub for every release.  Whoever has been\n&gt; putting JUnit up on maven, I tak=\r\ne it, hasn&#39;t been also putting up\n&gt; junit-dep?  I&#39;m sorry to say that I&#39;m v=\r\nery aware that a lot of people\n&gt; are indebted to the anonymous time-donor w=\r\nho&#39;d been keeping the maven\n&gt; repos up-to-date until several months ago.  I=\r\n&#39;ve been reluctant to\n&gt; accept full responsibility for feeding a repository=\r\n I neither use nor\n&gt; fully understand until some point where I was sure I c=\r\nould quickly\n&gt; respond to millions of users who got their junit jars auto-u=\r\npdated in\n&gt; a way that broke all their tests.  This might be overly cautiou=\r\ns of\n&gt; me.\n&gt; \n&gt;    David Saff\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Cheers,\n&gt; &gt; Peter\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
