Please suggest me the=\r\n best way to achieve this.\nMy objective in brief:\n1. Obtain the test method=\r\n execution time which EXCLUDES setup and teardown time.\n2. Facilitate warm =\r\nruns for the method. Run the same method more than once. B\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0 (I dont have a problem in getting the iterations from a configuration f=\r\nile)\n(Warm tests are facilitated as=C2=A0jvm takes sometime to load the cla=\r\nss for the very first run)\nI have achieved this by modifying the junit sour=\r\nce code. Which I dont think is the best way, as and when a new version of j=\r\nunit come in... I should be spending time to identify the instrumentaiton p=\r\noints and modify it. Which is not feasible.\nI want to decouple my code from=\r\n Junit&#39;s and still should be able to achive my objectives.\nCould anyone sug=\r\ngest a better way to achieve this..?\nThanks\nShubha\n\n\n      Best Jokes, Best=\r\n Friends, Best Food and more.
