I am not proposing an<br/>\nanswer myself but as a learning experience I would<br/>\nlike to see an example of where you used something<br/>\nlike a mock or in-memory database and then got caught<br/>\nout with the &quot;real thing&quot;.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI am thinking that if this happened to me it would<br/>\nshow me where I should write another test perhaps?  <br/>\n<br/>\nFor example what are things that have gone wrong<br/>\ntesting against Postgresql and then using against<br/>\nOracle?  Can we write a test that assures that our<br/>\ncode does not have that problem?<br/>\n<br/>\nWith a concrete example it would also be good to get<br/>\nother&#39;s opinions on how the problem could have been<br/>\navoided (or not).<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<br/>\nShane<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?
