(Granted, one could debate these are functional\ntests, but that&#39;s beside the point).\n\nCan any one shed any light on how I can A) start up the mail server\nprior to running the test part of the build, and B) how to verify\nthat the server is still running, when a test is started?\n\nOnce running, I usually leave the mail server running all the time,\nbut sometimes I forget to start it and then run my tests and some\nof the tests fail. Hence the desire to start the server and test if\nthe server is still running as part of the Ant build.\n\nLater, I&#39;d like to setup CruiseControl (once I figure it out...) to\ndo a nightly build and test of the software. I&#39;ve just started\nplaying with Ant, CVS, CruiseControl, TomCat, etc. and there&#39;s alot\nto absorb, so any suggestions would be very appreciated!\n\n\nPCM (Paul Michali)\n\nCarrier Voice Gateway Business Unit (CVGBU)\nCisco Systems, Inc.\n250 Apollo Drive\nChelmsford, MA 01824\n\nPhone : (800) 572-6771 x 45817  (978) 244-5817 [direct]\nPaging: (800) 365-4578 [voice]  pcm@...
