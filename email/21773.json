Looking at the code now, it looks like a much easier<br/>\nfeature, perhaps for early 4.8.<br/>\n<br/>\nQuestion: would you rather see the tests as ignored, or not see them at all?<br/>\n<br/>\n   David Saff<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Thu, Jun 18, 2009 at 4:47 PM, William Pietri&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:william@...\">william@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi! There&#39;s some functionality I had built for myself in the land of<br/>\n&gt; JUnit 3, and I&#39;m trying to figure out how best to replicate it in JUnit<br/>\n&gt; 4. Let me explain it in two parts.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The first part is something that finds all my tests (by walking the<br/>\n&gt; filesystem) and then runs them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The second part is a way for me to segregate different sorts of tests so<br/>\n&gt; that I can run them conditionally. I previously used annotations,<br/>\n&gt; including something akin to the @Ignore annotation that I&#39;m pleased to<br/>\n&gt; see is now included. I also had something like @Category(&quot;slow&quot;), which<br/>\n&gt; allowed me to kick slow tests out of the common target that developers run.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; For the first part, I found this chunk of code, so I didn&#39;t have to<br/>\n&gt; write that myself:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://burtbeckwith.com/blog/?p=52\">http://burtbeckwith.com/blog/?p=52</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But now that I&#39;m looking to add the second part to it, it seems awkward<br/>\n&gt; enough that I wonder if I&#39;m going about it wrong.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Within this structure, it looks like I could use per-class annotations<br/>\n&gt; to kick entire classes out of the set of tests to run. But is there a<br/>\n&gt; reasonable way I could use annotations on individual methods to include<br/>\n&gt; or exclude them from the set of tests to run?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; William<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
