An assertNotNull for the same member variable fails<br/>\n&gt; at the beginning of the next test method.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Does junit initialize all member variables to null between tests?<br/>\n&gt; If so, how can I avoid it? I tried to implement blank setUp() and<br/>\n&gt; tearDown() methods, but that did not work.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Each test runs in its own instance of your test class, so the second test<br/>\nruns in a completely different instance of your class hence the NPE.  Why<br/>\nare you setting a variable within one test for use within another test?<br/>\nThat sounds like some test-coupling you probably don&#39;t want.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou use setUp() to construct a fixture that is common across all methods<br/>\nwithin your test case - this is one way of defining some known object<br/>\nstate(s) that you can then assert within your tests.  <br/>\n<br/>\nJonathan</div>",
