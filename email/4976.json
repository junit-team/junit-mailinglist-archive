Some UNIX operating systems<br/>\nhave processes that are heavy, and threads that are lightweight.<br/>\nLinux has only processes (threads are implemented as processes).<br/>\nWindows only has threads (processes are implemented as threads).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo let me see what you might be wanting:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) executing the tests in separate Threads (Java has no real concept<br/>\n   of process).<br/>\n2) executing the tests in separate JVMs<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first is easy, and is done by ActiveTestSuite (and there is<br/>\nan extension to Junit out there that does performance and load<br/>\ntesting...).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe second would require you to call Runtime.getRuntime().exec()<br/>\nfor each separate JVM you wish to run.<br/>\n<br/>\nThose processes are *very* heavy weight, and do not stress your<br/>\nclass (they are in separate classloaders, separate environments<br/>\ncompletely).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Threads are most likely what you want as they test the concurrency<br/>\nof your class the best.</div>",
