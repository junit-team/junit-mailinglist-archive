Mine don&#39;t, so I want faster feedback, and more stuff\n&gt;  &gt; running in memory makes that happen.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sometimes you need to do that, but when that happens I tend to split the\n&gt; test suite into a full version and a compact version. The full version\n&gt; can be run automatically and repeatedly on a build server. If it takes\n&gt; an hour or even 24 hours to run, it&#39;s no big deal, as long as the\n&gt; compact version runs quickly.\n&gt; \n&gt; I also sometimes reorganize test suites so I run just the subset that\n&gt; seems most likely to touch the code I&#39;m working on. That can also reduce\n&gt; build times to manageable levels.\n\nI prefer to know my code works when I integrate it, and not at some \npoint after that. If I&#39;m checking in code four times per day or more, I \ndon&#39;t want to wait 6 hours to find out that my 9:45 AM check-in didn&#39;t \nwork, then have to back away three check-ins to figure out what \nhappened. That way lies integration hell.\n\n&gt;  &gt; A question: when you test business logic that touches a relational\n&gt;  &gt; database, do you just put up with how slow those tests are? If not, what\n&gt;  &gt; do you do? HSQLDB? Something else?\n&gt; \n&gt; I haven&#39;t done a lot of RDB testing. My slowest tests mostly involve\n&gt; network connections and web servers. For that, I either put up with the\n&gt; slowness or subset the tests as described above. I suppose I could build\n&gt; a web server into my test suite, but honestly that&#39;s never been the\n&gt; simplest thing that could possibly work for me. :-) If it ever becomes a\n&gt; major problem, I might consider it.\n\nThat&#39;s good to know. You&#39;ve never, say, used Jetty for that purpose? I \nhaven&#39;t, but I hear it works quite well, filling the same role that \nHSQLDB would do in RDB testing.\n-- \nJ. B.
