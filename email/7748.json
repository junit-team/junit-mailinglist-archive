We <br/>\nduplicate much code in the other two test methods.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe write such tests for every domain object so I wonder if we should <br/>\nimprove our test class.<br/>\n<br/>\nWould you write 3 or just 1 test method for that example?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd would you try to convince senior coworkers who know little about <br/>\nJUnit and dislike TDD?</div>",
