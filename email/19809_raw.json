In fact, I use JUnit4 with annotation but I must create the parent class with dummy class, if not Maven will throw error. I do not like that way and I use Unitils test framework to enhance its capacities by using Annotation or I can force JUnit4 run with the custom TestRunner with RunWith annotation. I have a short introduction of JUnit4 RunWith class at here http://www.haiphucnguyen.net/blog/?p=51\n\nHai\n\n&quot;J. B.

It&#39;s because I&#39;ve created an\n &gt; abstract class containing all my tests and I extend this class for\n &gt; each implementation that I have to test. By doing this, I don&#39;t need\n &gt; to write redundant code to test different kind of implementations. To\n &gt; help you better understand, I give you an example :\n &gt; \n &gt; public abstract class FirstTest {\n &gt; \n &gt; @Test\n &gt; public test1() {\n &gt; // ...\n &gt; IFactory factory = getFactory();\n &gt; // ...\n &gt; }\n &gt; \n &gt; @Test\n &gt; public test2() {\n &gt; // ...\n &gt; IFactory factory = getFactory();\n &gt; // ...\n &gt; }\n &gt; \n &gt; protected abstract IFactory getFactory();\n &gt; \n &gt; }\n &gt; \n &gt; /*\n &gt; * This class should be considered a test class even there is no\n &gt; * @Test inside. Normally, it inherit all the test methods from\n &gt; * the superclass.\n &gt; *\n &gt; */\n &gt; public class Implementation1Test extends FirstTest {\n &gt; \n &gt; protected IFactory getFactory() {\n &gt; return new MyFirstImplementationFactory();\n &gt; }\n &gt; \n &gt; }\n &gt; \n &gt; Now, if I try to run Implementation1Test as a JUnit test, Eclipse\n &gt; reports me an error. I have to specify at least one @Test annotation\n &gt; in my concrete test class. Is there anybody who can help how to do that ?\n \n I believe this is a known Eclipse problem, so I recommend asking Eclipse \n people, rather than JUnit people. I had the same problem with Eclipse \n running JUnit 3 tests. Marking the super-test-class abstract worked \n around the problem there.\n -- \n J. B.
