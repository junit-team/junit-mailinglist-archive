Do you have a specific example in mind of how a<br/>\n&gt; TestSetup<br/>\n&gt; &gt; indicated that something was wrong.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m wondering if the OP&#39;s problem isn&#39;t similar. Reading a properties<br/>\n&gt; file is expensive, so we only want to do it once for a bunch of<br/>\n&gt; tests. Well, what if you explicitly passed the properties you need to<br/>\n&gt; the methods that need them?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Actually, what Avalon is doing is a bit more expensive than reading a<br/>\nproperties file.  The configuration data is in an XML format, that<br/>\ngets read and turned into a Configuration object tree.  From this<br/>\ntree, the test environment&#39;s Context is populated, the Logger hierarchy<br/>\nis set up, and the ComponentManager is populated with the Components<br/>\nthat we will be testing.  This ensures that the Components play well<br/>\nwith the rest of the system that has been well tested and run under<br/>\nload.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe TestCases we have then lets each test run against this setup.<br/>\nThe way I have &quot;bent&quot; the JUnit framework to work with mine works<br/>\nfor this solution.  Basically my test environment is set up once<br/>\nper TestCase object and torn down once per TestCase object.  Each<br/>\nTestCase needs to have its own environment so this works well.</div>",
