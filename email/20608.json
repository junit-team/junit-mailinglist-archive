Yeah, I know, storytests-using-junit is odd, but the explanation<br/>\nis simple:  our customer team is composed entirely of folks who can<br/>\nread/write/tweak java at will, are comfortable with the IDE, etc.<br/>\nThey still *look* FIT&#39;ish, just with extra parens and ;&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Fri, Jun 20, 2008 at 9:59 AM, milesy1981 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:chrismiles@...\">chrismiles@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Good Afternoon,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am trying to implement a better JUnit strategy here, and I was<br/>\n&gt; wondering if anyone has any tried and test ways of seperating out<br/>\n&gt; their different classes of testing.

I am just<br/>\n&gt; looking for any methodologies for seperation of these tests in<br/>\n&gt; regards to packaging, and running them etc. I run my tests from<br/>\n&gt; maven and it would be good to run the two sets of tests seprately<br/>\n&gt; from each other.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Many Thanks.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Chris<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
