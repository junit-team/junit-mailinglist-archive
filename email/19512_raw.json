But we shouldn&#39;t\n&gt; be fixing java.lang in junit.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In juni=\r\nt@yahoogroups.com, &quot;David Saff&quot; &lt;saff@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; All,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Kent a=\r\nnd I continue to try to fine-tune equality to produce the least\n&gt; &gt; surpris=\r\ne, and continue to wonder if well enough should have been left\n&gt; &gt; alone.  =\r\nIn 4.3, we introduced some run-time math magic to make up for\n&gt; &gt; the lack =\r\nof type-expansion once we had removed most of the primitive\n&gt; &gt; type assert=\r\nEquals methods.  Thus, it became the case, somewhat\n&gt; &gt; accidentally, that =\r\nthis would pass:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; assertEquals(new Integer(1), new Long(1));  // A\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; However, it simultaneously became the case that this would also pa=\r\nss:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; assertEquals(new BigDecimal(&quot;1.0&quot;), new BigDecimal(&quot;1.1&quot;));  /=\r\n/ B\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Line B should certainly fail.  The simplest thing to do is to =\r\nremove\n&gt; &gt; our math magic, introduce assertEquals(long, long), etc, and let=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; numerical classes define their own equality.  This means that line A\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; will now fail, since that&#39;s how Integer.equals() is defined.  This is\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; a small behavior change, but a &quot;regression&quot; of sorts.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If anyone =\r\nbelieves this is a damaging decision, please let me know.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;    David=\r\n Saff\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n",
