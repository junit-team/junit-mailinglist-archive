So I have a chicken egg sort of situatio=\r\nn. NB would do the obvious thing, i.e., have tests generated from code, so =\r\nthe above doesn&#39;t make any sense as it implies that the code is generated f=\r\nrom the test, which is a cool idea of the IDE could support it.\n&gt; &gt; I have =\r\nexperience using JUnit, so the framework itself isn&#39;t in question, but how =\r\nto apply this methodology within the IDE format is.\n&gt; &gt; Do I have to simply=\r\n short-circuit the default process that NB and the JUnit plugin manufacture=\r\n?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; thanks in advance for any help on this,\n&gt; &gt; Karl\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
