You will be\nable to have QStudio generate JUnit testfiles for you (just like\nJTest) but also when adding methods to you class you can have QStudio\nadd testmethods for these new methods.\nThe output of JUnit will be available in  tabular form whereby you can\nselect a failure or success and switch in the IDE&#39;s editor to the\ncorresponding JUnit test.\nAlso coverage based upon the execution of all tests will be presented\nas a HTML view of the sourcecode (covered lines being colored\ndistinctly).\nAnd you can enter your own expected coverage for methods as a\npercentage. When the coverage does not meet this limit you will get a\nwarning for this method.\n\nAt http://www.qa-systems.com/downloads/qstudioforjava/index.html you\ncan download a fully functional 30 day evaluation for the Windows\nplatform. (for Linux and Solaris you can get a similar evaluation but\nsince these use another licensing application you need to request a\nlicense first).\n\nYours sincerely,\nArie Roy\n\n\n--- In junit@y..., Scott Vachalek &lt;svachalek@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hello, \n&gt; \n&gt; I am not unbiased but we have a pretty good tool at:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://testersedge.com/gjtk/\n&gt; \n&gt; It is free only for non-commercial use, but most users\n&gt; are pleased with performance and ease of use. It will\n&gt; even attribute the coverage to specific JUnit tests.\n&gt; \n&gt; Scott\n&gt; \n\n\n\n",
