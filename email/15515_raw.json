Performance tests don&#39;t run as often as object tests, \nbecause the former are slower and can get in the way of the latter. When \nthis happens, I split the source tree in two, putting the performance \ntests in their own source tree, apart from the object tests. I&#39;ve done \nthis so often that I end up with this default structure for Java projects:\n\nproduction/\n     source/\n     classes/\ntest/\n     source/\n     classes/\nendtoend/\n     source/\n     classes/\nfixture/\n     source/\n     classes/\nperformance/\n     source/\n     classes/\n...and so on. Each source tree gets it own source and classes directories.\n\nSeparate source trees have many benefits:\n  * Eclipse can run all the tests in one source tree easily\n  * Different items are built to different locations, making it easier \nto avoid production code depending on test code\n  * Easy to ship the production code without the tests, since that&#39;s \nstill the norm\n\nI used to use separate projects, but that creates annoying class path \nproblems, so I settled on separate source trees. My Ant tasks mirror \nwhat Eclipse does, building separate source trees to separate build \nlocations.\n\nThe bottom line: if the tests are really /that/ different, then we \nshould emphasize the difference by placing the tests in different \nlocations, rather that merely annotating them.\n-- \nJ.
