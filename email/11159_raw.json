It\nwould help greatly if you provided a complete (though not necessarially\nlarge) code example indicating exactly what lines are the lines of\nrepetitive code you want to get rid of.\n\nIf so, you&#39;re basically just SoL in Java; the language is so inflexible\nthat you&#39;re forced into writing a lot of repetitive code. According\nto Paul Graham, Lisp- and Scheme-like languages offer you the best\nchance of being able to move beyond this, by essentially writing custom\nprogramming languages within the language for particular purpose you\nhave in mind. After a year or so of looking at this, I&#39;m coming into\nviolent agreement with him. I&#39;ve been looking at Ruby to see how one\nmight do things better while still being enough like Java that other\nprogrammers can transition to it easily.\n\n&gt; I CAN GENERATE TEST CALLS TO THESE METHODS DYNAMICALLY\n&gt; AND TEST THEIR VALIDITY\n\nI&#39;ve given up as a lost cause any serious work in dynamic code\ngeneration directly in Java. Either you use reflection, which is so\nprolix anyway that you need to be generating a lot of code to make it\nworthwhile, or you write a preprocessor for a custom language, which is\na pain.\n\nThe only thing that&#39;s really saved my sanity in the last year or so has\nbeen anonymous inner classes that extend other classes.\n\nAs an exercise, if anybody&#39;s interested in approaching this, try writing\na class that includes a state machine, and testing it thoroughly,\nespecially for allowable transitions from and to each state. I found\ntesting this pretty painful last time I had to do it.\n\ncjs\n-- \nCurt Sampson  &lt;cjs@...&gt;   +81 90 7737 2974   http://www.NetBSD.org\n    Don&#39;t you know, in this new Dark Age, we&#39;re all light.  --XTC\n\n",
