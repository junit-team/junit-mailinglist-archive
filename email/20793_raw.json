However, when I\n&gt; tried to use it I would\n&gt; still get the same problem that I started this\n&gt; thread with.\n&gt; \n&gt; From what I can tell by looking at the FEST source\n&gt; is that FEST still\n&gt; queries the table from whichever thread it is being\n&gt; called from.  This again\n&gt; brings me back to my problem: How do I query the\n&gt; table that gets modified on\n&gt; the EDT thread from a junit thread.\n&gt; \n&gt; I ultimately ended up using\n&gt; SwingUtilities.invokeAndWait using a final int\n&gt; array that stores the number of rows in the table. \n&gt; I then use an assert\n&gt; after the invoteAndWait on this final int array to\n&gt; make sure the number of\n&gt; rows is correct.\n&gt; \n&gt; One other thing, so happens when I finally got\n&gt; around to your suggestion and\n&gt; looked at FEST, you had taken out the GuiTask class!\n&gt;  I finally figured it\n&gt; out and noticed too that you are adding a whole lot\n&gt; of queries that get run\n&gt; in the EDT thread.  So far I really like what I see\n&gt; with FEST and will\n&gt; continue to use it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks for the suggestions and keep up the good\n&gt; work!\n&gt; Aaron\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Alex Ruiz wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hi Aaron,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; My suggestion is either:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1. Use FEST ( http://fest.easytesting.org/swing )\n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; test your GUIs. FEST is a library provides a\n&gt; compact,\n&gt; &gt; intuitive and easy-to-use API that makes GUI\n&gt; testing\n&gt; &gt; easy (disclaimer: I&#39;m the creator of FEST.)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 2. If you decide not to use FEST, you can still\n&gt; use\n&gt; &gt; FEST&#39;s GuiTask to solve your problem. Since FEST\n&gt; is\n&gt; &gt; open source and under the Apache 2.0 license, you\n&gt; can\n&gt; &gt; copy the source of GuiTask. Please note that\n&gt; GuiTask\n&gt; &gt; uses invokeAndWait instead of invokeLater. IMHO,\n&gt; most\n&gt; &gt; of the time in your test you need to wait for an\n&gt; &gt; action to be executed in the EDT before you can\n&gt; &gt; continue the execution of your test. You can find\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; code for GuiTask at\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\nhttp://code.google.com/p/fest/source/browse/trunk/fest/fest-swing/src/main/java/org/fest/swing/core/GuiTask.java\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Cheers,\n&gt; &gt; -Alex\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- hybrid180 &lt;aaron@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Hi,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; I am actually relatively new to Junit testing and\n&gt; I\n&gt; &gt;&gt; have a quick question\n&gt; &gt;&gt; about running tests on two different threads.  I\n&gt; am\n&gt; &gt;&gt; trying to verify that\n&gt; &gt;&gt; something is done on the swing thread with a\n&gt; junit\n&gt; &gt;&gt; test.  For example the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; following:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; \t\tSwingUtilities.invokeLater(new Runnable(){\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \t\t\tpublic void run() {\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \t\t\t\tassertEquals(2, tableModel.getRowCount());\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \t\t\t};\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \t\t\t\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \t\t});\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; When this test actually fails I&#39;ve noticed an\n&gt; &gt;&gt; AssertionError exception is\n&gt; &gt;&gt; thrown on the Swing thread but the test overall\n&gt; &gt;&gt; still passes.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; My question is this: is there a way to make the\n&gt; test\n&gt; &gt;&gt; not pass when this\n&gt; &gt;&gt; assert fails?  Or at least throw the\n&gt; AssertionError\n&gt; &gt;&gt; on the Junit thread\n&gt; &gt;&gt; instead of the Swing thread?\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Thanks for any help,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Aaron\n&gt; &gt;&gt; -- \n&gt; &gt;&gt; View this message in context:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\nhttp://www.nabble.com/Testing-on-AWT-thread-tp18876848p18876848.html\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Sent from the JUnit - User mailing list archive\n&gt; at\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Nabble.com.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;       \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; View this message in context:\n&gt;\nhttp://www.nabble.com/Testing-on-AWT-thread-tp18876848p18918286.html\n&gt; Sent from the JUnit - User mailing list archive at\n&gt; Nabble.com.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n      \n\n",
