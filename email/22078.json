However, I&#39;m much more interested in experiences than in<br/>\n&gt;&gt; votes. If someone said, &quot;I went through my code and I could<br/>\n&gt;&gt; definitely use classes as categories because of X, Y and/or Z,&quot; would<br/>\n&gt;&gt; be compelling to me. Even more compelling is if someone would write<br/>\n&gt;&gt; the test cases for the new scheme.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Just skimmed through two of my OS projects. 80% of the test cases refer to a single class under test. For about 20% of those CUTs I have more than one test class; those could benefit most since the naming convention doesn&#39;t help to show the connection.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The follow-up question is: What would I do with this meta info?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Some (many) people have asked for categories as a way of running only<br/>\nsome of their tests, and our primary goal is to help them.  If you<br/>\nwere ever tempted to run only the subset of your tests that shared<br/>\nsome given CUT, this annotation strategy would let you do that.  Does<br/>\nthat make your life better?<br/>\n<br/>\n   David Saff</div>",
