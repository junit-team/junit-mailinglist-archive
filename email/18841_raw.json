A patient came to him and said &quot;Doc, I have \nthese recurring headaches.&quot;  His response was &quot;Well, Tylenol works.&quot;  \nThe patient went off with the doctor&#39;s advice and, sure enough, his \nheadaches went away for a while.. but eventually the patient had to come \nback to the doctor for something far worse.\n\nThe desire to test private method is not something that you should \nignore, it&#39;s an indication that something else is wrong.  Using \nreflection to get at them is kind of like taking Tylenol without asking \nwhat else could be wrong.\n\nGood design is easily testable.  If you can&#39;t write test without special \ntricks, it&#39;s time to go back to your design and ask: do I really have \ngood cohesion?  Or, why is my coupling so bad that testing is hard.\n\nMichael Feathers\nwww.objectmentor.com\n\n",
