When the\ntest case passes, you&#39;ve fixed the bug.\n\nIn general, I&#39;d suggest building up your test suite incrementally as\nexisting code is refactored or new code is added, always keeping the\ncost-benefit analysis in check.\n\nMike\n\n\n--- &quot;David M.

We have a significant\n&gt; code\n&gt; base already and we&#39;re trying to move to JUnit.  What issues did you\n&gt; have\n&gt; when trying this yourself?  Was your testing hierarchy exactly the\n&gt; same as\n&gt; your application package structure?  Did you start only using JUnit\n&gt; with new\n&gt; development or with bugs as well?  Or did you take a month off and\n&gt; have\n&gt; everyone write JUnit tests?  Any help would be greatly appreciated.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; -dmg\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nGet email at your own domain with Yahoo!
