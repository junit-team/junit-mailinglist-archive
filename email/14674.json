We used Coverlipse first. I liked the user interface (you initiate<br/>\n&gt; coverage measurement with a new kind of launch configuration), but the<br/>\n&gt; results weren&#39;t accurate. We set breakpoints on lines that the tool <br/>\n&gt; claimed<br/>\n&gt; weren&#39;t covered and execution stopped there. We also tried Clover, <br/>\n&gt; which has<br/>\n&gt; a slightly less natural interface (you set an &quot;enable Clover&quot; flag on the<br/>\n&gt; project properties). The results, however, seemed much more accurate.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The result of our testing was that we found two methods out of JUnit 4 <br/>\n&gt; that<br/>\n&gt; we felt needed tests. Our overall coverage is 68%, and it seems like it<br/>\n&gt; would be easy to get it up to 80%. However, the only functional code that<br/>\n&gt; really needed more tests were those two methods.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sincerely yours,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Kent Beck<br/>\n&gt; Three Rivers Institute </span></blockquote></div>",
