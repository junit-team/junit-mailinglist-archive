Testing and QA are a somewhat different mindset after all. So\nexcuse me if I come off as somewhat pedantic.\n\nFirst, you can indeed do &quot;too much testing&quot; - or rather you can test\nineffectively and inefficiently. For example, if you have a method that\ntakes three integer arguments, &#39;arg1&#39;, &#39;arg2&#39;, and &#39;arg3&#39; - and the range\nfor those integer arguments are supposed to each be zero to one thousand\ninclusive. If I were to test this method, I would probably start with the\nfollowing simple bounds test data for each argument:\n\n-1, 0, 999, 1000, 1001\n\nI would then expand that to include -999, -1000, -1001 just to make sure\nthere wasn&#39;t some signage problem. Then I would include some magic numbers\nsuch as 255 and 256 to test variable sizes (not as applicable to Java as\nother languages, but what the hell).\n\nPretty basic testing theory right? Okay, here comes my point; what I would\nnot do is use every single data point between zero and one thousand, such as\n1, 2, 3, 4, ... 1000. That would be inefficient and most likely ineffective.\nSure you could easily test each data point for a single argument with a\nlittle bit of logic in the test code, but given that you have three\narguments, there would be one billion combinations of all positive integers.\nAssuming you could run one thousand tests per second, it would take almost\ntwelve days to run through the positive combinations alone.\n\nI am sure you have all heard of similar examples, but on a more abstract\nlevel the same principle applies; the goal of testing is to find bugs, not\nto test every possible combination of data. In most testing/QA efforts I\nhave been involved in, both as a QA Engineer and as a developer, we\ncarefully chose our test data, secnarios, suites, what have you, based on\nwhat was most likely to find a bug. We also concentrated on those areas of\ncode that we had good reason to believe were the least robust, least tested\nand the newest - i.e., for whatever reason had the most risk of being buggy.\nAlso, depending on the nature of the code and or product, we also may have\nconcentrated on code that, if it failed, would cause the most harm - e.g., I\nworked for a company that used software to collect and analyze data from HIV\nblood assays. In that case we were much less concerned about whether the\nsoftware crashed, or was user friendly, and much more concerned that the\ndata it generated, displayed, analyzed and stored was always correct. Lives\nmay have depended on correct data operations.\n\nEach software product is different with regard to the various factors that\naffect how testing is performed, but the things they all have in common are:\n\n1) You can&#39;t test everything, so you have to concentrate one the testing\nmethodologies that are most likely to find bugs.\n\n2) The earlier you test, the less costly and more effective/efficient it is\nto find a bug.\n\nSo yes, you can &quot;test too much&quot; if the testing you are doing is ineffective,\ninefficient and is not finding bugs - because it will take away time and\neffort from more productive testing methodologies. There are various metrics\nyou can use to guesstimate the points where you may just be wasting time and\neffort to test further, but you have to start your tests with well known\nbasics and work from there, and you should test early.\n\nFWIW,\nLauren\n\n=====\nLooking for an experienced Java/C++ Software Engineer?\nSee: http://developerdude.mystarband.net/resume.html\n\n\n\n",
