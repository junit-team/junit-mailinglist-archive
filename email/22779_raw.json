Then\nwhen you =\r\ncome to your setup method, only do the update if the field is\nfalse.  Just =\r\nremember to set the field to true once the update occurs.  This\nway, no mat=\r\nter which test runs first or even if a sub set of tests run, then\nthe reset=\r\n only occurs initially.\n\nThere may be a better way to do this, but I like t=\r\no fall back on this\nrecipe.\n\nBig Mike\n\nOn Thu, Jul 1, 2010 at 11:39 AM, hda=\r\nve321321 &lt;hdave321321@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks for the help. In my c=\r\nase, Spring Test does an automatic transaction\n&gt; rollback after every test =\r\nmethod, so there are no dependencies between tests\n&gt; -- so thats not a prob=\r\nlem. Because of the rollback, it is also the case that\n&gt; they order of the =\r\ntest runs also doesn&#39;t matter. The database is reset to a\n&gt; &quot;known&quot; state a=\r\nfter each test method by the transactional rollback.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;d just like to l=\r\noad the data once rather than 50 times. But the\n&gt; @BeforeClass requirement =\r\nto be a static method makes it impossible to use.\n&gt; Is there any trigger th=\r\nat can run after a class is initialized by Spring and\n&gt; before any test met=\r\nhod is executed?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In junit@yahoogroups.com &lt;junit%40yahoogroups.co=\r\nm&gt;, Mike Forsberg\n&gt; &lt;bigmike.f@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I would advise against t=\r\nhat unless you were following the following guide\n&gt; &gt; lines....\n&gt; &gt; - No te=\r\nst method (or called method) manipulates the data base.\n&gt; &gt; - The order of =\r\nthe test methods do not cause conflicts with each other\n&gt; with\n&gt; &gt; required=\r\n data being there.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Some things I&#39;d try before doing the @BeforeClas=\r\ns\n&gt; &gt; - Only populate the data you need for a given set of tests. (Don&#39;t\n&gt; =\r\npopulate\n&gt; &gt; the _whole_ database.)\n&gt; &gt; - Which of the DBUnit population fe=\r\natures are you using... I think there\n&gt; is\n&gt; &gt; one that will revert to a kn=\r\nown state, without the delete and insert.\n&gt; This\n&gt; &gt; may save some time.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; - Try to use a non-commitable transaction for testing. After all, one\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n shouldn&#39;t need to test the commit functionality.

I am using\n&gt; Spring\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Test which automatically does a transacti=\r\non rollback after each test\n&gt; method.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; However, I am also using DBUnit=\r\n to load the exact same dataset before\n&gt; each\n&gt; &gt; &gt; test method via the @Be=\r\nforeTransaction annotation.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; It has occured to me that I could s=\r\nave a lot of time if I load the\n&gt; DBUnit\n&gt; &gt; &gt; test data once per test clas=\r\ns instead of once per test method.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;ve not used the @BeforeCla=\r\nss and @AfterClass methods before, but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; apparently they require the an=\r\nnotated method to be static and this is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; interfering with my normal us=\r\ne of Spring dependency injection that\n&gt; provides\n&gt; &gt; &gt; an application conte=\r\nxt, data source, and other things I need to load\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; correct data s=\r\net.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Anyone experience this before?
