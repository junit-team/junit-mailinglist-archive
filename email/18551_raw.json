It should be \nrelatively easy to write a TestCase for the below class without having \nto worry about JNI, CORBA, or any XML-based configuration.\n\nWorking solely from the example you&#39;ve given below (and resisting the \ntemptation to discuss refactoring the class to make it more testable \n_before_ writing a test case) I can see a whole host of TestCase \ncandidates here, such as:\n\n01. testMainWithServerConfigParametersCreatesReadyServer - by directly \ncalling Server#main(String []) and using Assert#assertTrue on \nServer#isServerReady (or similar) we would be able to test if server \nconfiguration is successful. Such a test would also help by design by \nmaking us ask questions along the lines of &quot;What constitutes a ready \nserver? Configured correctly? Started?&quot;\n\n02. testGetInstanceAlwaysReturnsSameInstance - by using \nAssert#assertSame we can check that the Singleton design pattern is \nbeing enforced correctly. I&#39;m sorely tempted to suggest binning the \nSingleton pattern (is &quot;only one connection to the server at any one \ntime&quot; an explicit intention?), but refactoring before we&#39;ve finished our \nTestCase would be a bit naughty.\n\n03. testIsServerStarted/testIsServerStopped - these are \nself-explanatory, although they do bring us back to the question of \nready vs. started again.\n\nOne strategy that would be very helpful here would be mocking - there \nare plenty of articles online related to mocking in JUnit, and some \npretty good books as well.\n\nCheers,\n\nSteve.\n\n--\nStephen Smith, MEng (Wales).\nhttp://www.stephen-smith.co.uk/\n\navinash anand wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Hi\n&gt; Posting the real .java file would not be possible for me but I am \n&gt; writting a sample java file which will be doing the same (You can say \n&gt; its a prototype of it.)\n&gt; \n&gt; class server{\n&gt; private DBConnection _dbconnectoin;\n&gt; private server _serverinstance = null;\n&gt; private static VespAlarmService _alarmService;\n&gt; private static VespUuid _serverUUID;\n&gt; private server(){\n&gt; _alarmService = VespAlarmServiceImpl.getInstance();\n&gt; }\n&gt; public static server getInstance(){\n&gt; if (null == _servernstance){\n&gt; _serverinstance = new server();\n&gt; }\n&gt; return _serverinstance;\n&gt; }\n&gt; public static void main(String[] args){\n&gt; if (args.length &gt;= 1){\n&gt; try {\n&gt; //set the initial environment\n&gt; AnotherServer.getInstance().setEnvironment();\n&gt; server obj = server.getInstance();\n&gt; _serverUUID = new VespUuid(args[0]);\n&gt; StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer(_serverUUID.getInetAddress().toString());\n&gt; sb.delete(0, 1);\n&gt; sb.append(&quot;:&quot;);\n&gt; sb.append(_serverUUID.getPort());\n&gt; String sInetAddress = sb.toString();\n&gt; System.setProperty(VespConfigParams.MTT_INSTANCE_HOST_PROPERTY, \n&gt; sInetAddress);\n&gt; if(args.length &gt;= 2) {\n&gt; System.setProperty(VespConfigParams.ORB_UUID_PROPERTY, args[1]);\n&gt; }\n&gt; void startserver ()\n&gt; {\n&gt; }\n&gt; void stopserver()\n&gt; {\n&gt; }\n&gt; void isserverready()\n&gt; {\n&gt; }\n&gt; void generatevespAlarm()\n&gt; {\n&gt; }\n&gt; }\n&gt; \n&gt; This is how the main class looks. There are many other supporting JAVA \n&gt; files for this main server. It uses a JNI layer to talk to the native \n&gt; code. Which is implemented elesewhere.\n&gt; \n&gt; For it to run in the actul enviroment, it uses a wrapper .exe which \n&gt; calls an xml file where all the server properties are listed in the main \n&gt; method the location of .class files are specified which are already \n&gt; compiled and put in the java&#92;lib folder in the form of .jar. Here is the \n&gt; snippet of xml file where the exe tries to read it.\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;stringProperty property=&quot;jloader.server.main.class&quot; displayName=&quot;Main \n&gt; class&quot; default=&quot;com/xyz/server/testing&quot; enabled=&quot;false&quot; advanced=&quot;true&quot; /&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; What I am trying is to write a JUnit test suite for this Java based \n&gt; server, which will be running in the form of an .exe. And my test cases \n&gt; will be running in eclipse.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hope the entire thing might make the picture a bit clear.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks\n&gt; Avinash\n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message ----\n&gt; From: &quot;andrew.p.mcdonagh@... &lt;mailto:andrew.p.mcdonagh%40gsk.com&gt;&quot; \n&gt; &lt;andrew.p.mcdonagh@... &lt;mailto:andrew.p.mcdonagh%40gsk.com&gt;&gt;\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com &lt;mailto:junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Friday, 15 December, 2006 7:25:14 PM\n&gt; Subject: Re: [junit] Test a remote server\n&gt; \n&gt; Hi,\n&gt; \n&gt; Not sure why your Java app does not use Java&#39;s corba ability (a good Java\n&gt; ORB being http://www.jacorb. org/ ), instead of JNI...\n&gt; \n&gt; Anyway, onto your real question, how do I test the code that is dependant\n&gt; upon the other servers?\n&gt; \n&gt; As you are asking on the JUnit list I take it you mean Unit test?\n&gt; Not System or Integration testing?\n&gt; \n&gt; If so, then you will find unit testing much simpler and (imo) better, if\n&gt; none of your unit tests need to access any file, network, database or UI.\n&gt; This means they run very fast. Once you figure out how to do them, you\n&gt; should be able to write lots of them , quickly too.\n&gt; \n&gt; We could just give you some simple examples, but I tend to find it better\n&gt; to show you how to unit test one of your classes that depend on corba or\n&gt; some other system, by using one of your real classes. So, please post\n&gt; (just one) class and we&#39;ll knock up a unit test for it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards\n&gt; \n&gt; Andrew\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;avinash anand&quot; &lt;avinash_anand@ yahoo.co. uk&gt;\n&gt; Sent by: junit@yahoogroups. com\n&gt; 15-Dec-2006 09:04\n&gt; Please respond to junit@yahoogroups. com\n&gt; \n&gt; To\n&gt; junit@yahoogroups. com\n&gt; cc\n&gt; \n&gt; Subject\n&gt; [junit] Test a remote server\n&gt; \n&gt; Hi Group\n&gt; Greetings to all. These days I am writting test suit for a CORBA CRM. Let\n&gt; me first introduce the system.\n&gt; \n&gt; There is a central ORB server and many other servers which talk to each\n&gt; other through vesp. ORB being the central one. Entire code base is in C++.\n&gt; I have to test a new server introduced in the system which is written in\n&gt; Java. This new server talks to the rest through JNI. As a matter of Fact\n&gt; none of the servers can run independently, they neccesirily have to log\n&gt; into the central kit and report to the the central ORB server. After\n&gt; validation stuff the server starts working.\n&gt; \n&gt; Even this new Java based server uses an executable file to work\n&gt; (Jloader.exe written in c++)\n&gt; \n&gt; This .exe loads various .dll files in the system and in its main method\n&gt; calls the compiled .class files. This is the way how system functions.\n&gt; \n&gt; My problem is that when I will write a JUnit test case in IDE (eclipse)\n&gt; which would operate on the actual code which has 99% dependency and cannot\n&gt; be tested isolated. Is there any way to test this server code while it is\n&gt; working under the live system and the test suite running in the eclipse\n&gt; IDE.\n&gt; \n&gt; HELP !!!\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks\n&gt; Avinash\n&gt; \n&gt; ____________ _________ _________ _________ _________ _________ _\n&gt; Now you can scan emails quickly with a reading pane.
