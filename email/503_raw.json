The\n&gt; only difference is that while writing Unit tests you will have to write\n&gt; pseudo Classes, that a method you are testing, refers to, while in\n&gt; Integration testing you replace these pseudo classes by the actual classes.\n&gt; In unit testing you control the input that will come from the interacting\n&gt; classes while in integration testing the values are actually\n&gt; computed/fetched by the objects/classes.\n&gt;\n&gt; There are two cases:\n&gt;\n&gt; First, when you have been writing unit tests for each class in JUnit from\n&gt; the start. In this case the &quot;Test suite&quot; that includes test classes will\n&gt; serve the purpose you are looking for in integration testing framework.\n&gt;\n&gt; Second, you have not written any tests for your classes till now and now you\n&gt; need to change a class that interacts with other classes. In this case I\n&gt; will suggest you to write test cases for this class and test it thoroughly.\n&gt; Next you will need to trace the interaction of this class (maybe from the\n&gt; design document) with other classes and write test to ensure that the\n&gt; requirements are met.\n&gt;\n&gt; If the system design is OO and the design document is well done, all you\n&gt; will need to understand are the responsibilities of this class of objects\n&gt; and modify accordingly.\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt;\n&gt; Sachin\n&gt;\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: selena su [mailto:selena.su@...]\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, February 21, 2001 10:22 AM\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: Re: [junit] Integration Testing Framework.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks for your prompt reply gupta. How is it being done for the integration\n&gt; testing in JUnit ? Is there any references i can refer to ?\n&gt;\n&gt; I have gone through the &quot;Programmer Love Writing Tests&quot; but it only interact\n&gt; with only one class ! My worry how can i ensure that my updated class is\n&gt; working\n&gt; fine when it put into production machine ? It would be better if any\n&gt; framework\n&gt; that allows me to trace the intergration if any !\n&gt;\n&gt; thanks,\n&gt; selena\n&gt;\n&gt; sachin gupta wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hello ,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yu can use JUnit for integration testing as well. All you need to do is to\n&gt; &gt; consider the integrated systems as a unit and call the interface or\n&gt; &gt; interacting methods to check their functionality.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Is there any particular functionality you are looking for in the\n&gt; Integration\n&gt; &gt; Testing Framework ?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sachin\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; &gt; From: selena su [mailto:selena.su@...]\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Wednesday, February 21, 2001 10:03 AM\n&gt; &gt; Cc: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [junit] Integration Testing Framework.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi There:\n&gt; &gt;      Is there any Integration framework for JAVA available in the industry\n&gt; ?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; &gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
