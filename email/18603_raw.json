I&#39;ve dled the JUnit 3.8.1 source code and look through \nthem, but eith=\r\ner I am missing it or its not there.\n\nIt might be in the Junit runtime clas=\r\ns files, however the source \ncodes for those are unavailable on sourceforge=\r\n?\n\nNeed Help,\nJimm\n\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Bob Runstein&quot; &lt;rrunstei=\r\nn@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; On 12/27/06, junitheadache\n&gt; &gt; &lt;bohs01@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Hi =\r\nall,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I am currently working on auto generation of test\n&gt; &gt; cases f=\r\nor TDD for\n&gt; &gt; my honors year project.
