I generally advise against doing this purely for tests and instead look at implementing your own hamcrest matcher. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On Nov 17, 2012, at 7:39 PM, &quot;halfpirate1210&quot; &lt;bell_beauty12@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hello.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Newbie here.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I created a class (let&#39;s say class A) and in my JUnit class, I created an object (let&#39;s say object A1) from class A. Object A1 contains several variables and most importantly, an array of objects which are instantiated from another class (let&#39;s say class B); so the elements in that array are objects, not data types like int, string, etc.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; So I wanted to test this array of objects with another array of objects by simply creating another object; A2 from class A. I wanted to test using assertArrayEquals and the result is red bar.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; So my question is why did the test fail? I&#39;m thinking probably objects are always different since they are based on reference? But then again assertArrayEquals checks array length and content.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Many thanks,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; halfpirate1210<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
