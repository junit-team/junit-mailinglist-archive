More to the point it is not economically viable\n&gt;to write and maintain the recovery code.\n&gt;\n\nI agree that you have to be practical about the cost of recovery. \n Sometimes handling an exception in context is more economical than \nexiting gracefully.  When&#39;s the last time your application server \ncrashed because your servlet raised an exception?  \n\n&gt;\n&gt;If an exception is caused by a\n&gt;software error I just want the stacktrace to be logged. Forcing \n&gt;developers to write catch clauses for checked exceptions increases \n&gt;the possiblity they will lose that original stacktrace.\n&gt;\n\nIn my experience, users don&#39;t understand stack traces.  I generally log \nstack traces to a file, but print something the user understands to the \nconsole.  That requires the use of a catch clause.    \n\n&gt;\n&gt;Have you not been in the position of debugging a stacktrace to find\n&gt;that it was just a rethrow of another exception which has now been\n&gt;lost?\n&gt;\n\nI&#39;ll take that as a non-rhetorical question.\n\nI have been in that unfortunate situation.  It&#39;s certainly no fun. \n However, that pain isn&#39;t born solely out of handling exceptions in a \ncatch clause.   \n\n&gt;\n&gt;My preference would be to use unchecked exceptions everywhere and\n&gt;maybe use checked exceptions (refactor from unchecked to checked)\n&gt;where I will explicitely try to do some recovery.\n&gt;\n\nFair enough.  Do what works for you.\n\nMike\n\n\n",
