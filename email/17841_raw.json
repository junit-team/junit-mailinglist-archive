How \n&gt;&gt;will they act when we do?\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;They will learn the right way of doing things, just as children do when \n&gt;corrected. This does presume that the provider programmer knows more \n&gt;about the problem domain than the client programmer, but if the provider \n&gt;doesn&#39;t, then why are they publishing an API for others to use in the \n&gt;first place?\n&gt;\n&gt;None of us are experts in every domain we work in. We need to rely on \n&gt;the wisdom of others who are experts in those domains, as encapsulated \n&gt;in the libraries they&#39;ve published, rather than asserting that we always \n&gt;know what&#39;s best for everything and in every situation. Of course, we \n&gt;can each be experts in some fields, and those are the fields in which we \n&gt;publish libraries for the use of other, non-experts. (I have seen \n&gt;libraries designed by non-experts, and they cause more harm than good.)\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nThat does seem patriarchical.  To me, library development is just \nanother form of development.  Interestingly enough, you mention \nstatistics in another post.  After I finished school my second project \nin the workplace was a library for statistical analysis.  I&#39;m not an \nexpert in statistics by any means, but I worked closely with the initial \ngroup of users.. they were largely mathematicians and statisticians, a \nfew were chemists and physicists, and I developed a library that I \nsuspect may still be used today.   At the time, we were developing it as \na common library for research and production.\n\nI think that one advantage that I had was that I was not an expert.  I \nsat with people and we went back and forth about the meaning of \noperations and what interfaces would be useful.  I remember a couple of \nconcepts that I proposed, purely because they seemed like good object \nfactoring, that ended up being considered part of the domain.  It was a \nfun project.\n\nMichael Feathers\nwww.objectmentor.com\n\n\n",
