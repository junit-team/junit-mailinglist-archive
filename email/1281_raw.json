I probably want to encapsulate\n&gt; that algorithm\n&gt; into its own method so, e.g., I can Substitute in a new\n&gt; Algorithm later when\n&gt; someone points out that I (again) made the problem a lot\n&gt; harder than it needed\n&gt; to be.  I may well want to make that method private, though,\n&gt; as its existence\n&gt; or signature could reveal more about the internals of my\n&gt; class than I&#39;d like;\n&gt; it might, e.g., have an argument that refers to a component\n&gt; of some (private) field.\n\nYou could put the algorithm in its own class. So you could test it through\nthe public interface of the algorithm class without breaking encapsulation\nof the client class. Additionally you could easily use an other algorithm by\njust pluging in an alternative implementation (without having to rewrite the\nclient class).\n\nciao, Ilja\n\n\n",
