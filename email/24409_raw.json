If you want\na certain behaviour you need to use a specific runner. Often you will want\nmore than just one behaviour. For example you may want the spring runner\nwith junit and jparams behaviour. Sometimes you will find a way to makr\nthat work. Sometimes you just dont. A rework of the runner-concept,\nintroducing something like a chain for the behaviour-part would be a good\nidea, i guess. This could either be achieved by introducing a runner that\ndoes the work or by introducing this concept deeper into the framework. How\nare your thoughts on this? It could only work well when introduced to junit\nand the old concept would get marked deprecated as this makes\nrunner-providers like spring migrate to the new concept. I would be willing\nto give it a try and implement this if you think its a good idea. Another\nthing: anyone got junit formatter file?\nRegards, Henning\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
