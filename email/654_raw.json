You can also\nbuild your own scripts that can interact with VB or Java applications via\ntheir Rational Test Script Services (their testing framework which is given\nfor free with Rose).\n\nIf you buy their Testing Suite, you have a Test Manager which gives a\ncentral point to manage (run tests, reports errors, gather metrics and\nbuild nice reports etc..) the distributed testing environment.\n\nI think their offer is great coupled with Rose but Unit Testing as we\naddress it with jUnit does not seems to be covered.\n\nHope it helps,\n\nMarc\n\n\n\n\n\n&quot;Matt Sinclair&quot; &lt;matthew.sinclair@...&gt; on 12.03.2001 04:25:54\n\nPlease respond to junit@yahoogroups.com\n\nTo:   junit@yahoogroups.com\ncc:\n\nSubject:  [junit] Re: JUnit vs Rational Quality Architect\n\n\n--- In junit@y..., msonnet@t... wrote:\n&gt; I&#39;m going to see Rational this afternoon in Lausanne with exactly\n&gt; the same concern as you.\n\nDid you have any luck with info on Rational QA?\n\nM@\n\n\n\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\njunit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n\n\nYour use of Yahoo!
