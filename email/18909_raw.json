I don&#39;t know whether they will \nbounc=\r\ne it to you or not.  Seems odd that Eclipse 3.1.2 will run it \nfine in JUni=\r\nt 4, but Eclipse 3.2.0 will not.\n\nThank you,\nMike\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups=\r\n.com, &quot;David Saff&quot; &lt;saff@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Mike,\n&gt; \n&gt; Go ahead and log the bu=\r\ng against Eclipse, if you please, since\n&gt; Eclipse&#39;s mechanism for running s=\r\ningle tests is involved (although \nI&#39;m\n&gt; not convinced they won&#39;t bounce it=\r\n to us.  :-)\n&gt; \n&gt; That said, I wonder if part of the issue is that you&#39;re r=\r\nunning a\n&gt; JUnit 3 test class in JUnit 4.  This is of course allowed and\n&gt; =\r\nencouraged, but if you&#39;re not using the JUnit 4 functionality, \nrunning\n&gt; t=\r\nhe test case in JUnit 3 might be a good temporary workaround for \nthe\n&gt; sit=\r\nuation.
