The reason is simple: the various<br/>\nassertXYZ() methods throw Errors when they fail, and Java does not permit<br/>\nunwinding an exception stack trace so you can pick up where the exception<br/>\noccurred.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn many cases, you wouldn&#39;t want to, anyway. Having an error at point X<br/>\nwould often mean that more errors would be reported due to the first one (in<br/>\nmuch the same way a simple typo can spawn numerous compilation errors).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe right way, to get the same effect, is to have smaller test methods. If<br/>\nyou find that you are using a lot of common setup code, extract that out to<br/>\na helper method, or create a new test class and use the setUp() method.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe hard (and wrong) way is to change the assertion semantics. Define your<br/>\nown TestCase class, and provide new assertion methods so that, instead of<br/>\nthrowing an Error, you add the failure to a collection. Then, use a<br/>\nTestDecorator so that you can inspect the collection for errors, and fail<br/>\nthe test at that point. Note that you will probably have to build your own<br/>\nTest suite to do this (the inbuilt reflection support won&#39;t place the<br/>\ndecorator in for you)<br/>\n<br/>\nRobert.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n     &quot;Duct tape is like the Force: it has a light side, a dark side,<br/>\n                   and it holds the universe together&quot;<br/>\n  Robert Watkins     <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:robertdw@...\">robertdw@...</a>     <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:robertw@...\">robertw@...</a></div>",
