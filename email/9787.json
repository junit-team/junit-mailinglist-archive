There&#39;s well documented solutions.  Look it up.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I had a short discussion with &lt;I forget&gt; at OOPSLA last week about<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the recurring questions of &quot;how would I evolve &lt;insert well known<br/>\n&gt; &gt; algorithm here&gt; using TDD&quot;.  Well.. you don&#39;t have to... it&#39;s well<br/>\n&gt; &gt; known.. just use it.  Write a few tests to make sure you have it <br/>\n&gt; &gt; typed in correctly and that it keeps working.. but I see no reason<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to evolve algorithms I learned in University from a text.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Might be good exercise, though.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Possibly.

I&#39;ll use one with a<br/>\ncomplexity/efficiency to match the expected use (simplest thing that<br/>\ncould work).<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve never found artificial problems to be overly enlightening.<br/>\n<br/>\nTest-driving card games is fun... start with a simple one like War,<br/>\nand move up.<br/>\n<br/>\nDave</div>",
