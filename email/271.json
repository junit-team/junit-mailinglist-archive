I have 3.3.1, and it runs, but I have to<br/>\n&gt; change code in many of my tests to deal with deleted classes and methods<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m using. :/<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I noticed the error you&#39;re getting, and I don&#39;t see how that can be blamed<br/>\n&gt; upon the JVM.  You aren&#39;t getting a JVM core dump or anything, you&#39;re<br/>\ngetting<br/>\n&gt; JUnit failures.  When I upgraded, I had to diddle with my scripts and<br/>\n&gt; IDE settings to change some classpaths.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; You might be running into differences in the reflection API, perhaps?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; Joi Ellis                    Software Engineer<br/>\n&gt; Aravox Technologies          <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:joi@...\">joi@...</a>, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:gyles19@...\">gyles19@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; No matter what we think of Linux versus FreeBSD, etc., the one thing I<br/>\n&gt; really like about Linux is that it has Microsoft worried.
