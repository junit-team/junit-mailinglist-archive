Because we don&#39;t want to change the whole programming<br/>\n&gt; paradigm to XP we rather want to use a test-last method in the<br/>\n&gt; beginning and then watch out for further steps.<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m now in the process of investigating the basic requirements and<br/>\n&gt; conditions.<br/>\n&gt; One question that occured is if it&#39;s possible to quantify the amount<br/>\n&gt; of extra time you need when using unit testing compared to the<br/>\n&gt; non-testing approach. I solely refer to the writing of unit tests.<br/>\n&gt; Later saving of time (by better code) shouldn&#39;t be considered. So<br/>\n&gt; what&#39;s your experience? Can anybody do a statement about time<br/>\n&gt; consumption of writing unit tests?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Many people have said &quot;there is no clear answer&quot;, and I agree. Instead, <br/>\nlet me offer you a few variables to consider when guessing about the <br/>\ntime you&#39;ll need to write unit tests for code that already exists. <br/>\nYou&#39;ll spend time on each of these things:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Learning how to write tests (the syntax of JUnit)<br/>\n2. Learning when two different tests test the same thing, and deciding <br/>\nwhen to remove one.<br/>\n3. Discovering why a test is difficult to write.<br/>\n4. Changing the design of the code to make it possible to write a test.<br/>\n5. Changing the design of the code to make it easier to write a test.<br/>\n6. Deciding which parts of the system are most important to test first.<br/>\n7. Deciding whether to remove code instead of testing it, because it <br/>\nseems that code is not in use.<br/>\n8. Deciding whether to change the design of code because it would make <br/>\ntests easier to write.<br/>\n9. Deciding whether to change the design of code because it would help <br/>\navoid writing duplicate tests (tests that look the same, but test <br/>\ndifferent layers of the application)<br/>\n10. Becoming comfortable with the fact that the first test could take 2 <br/>\ndays to write, then the second one 1/2 day, then the third one 1 hour, <br/>\nthen the rest 5 minutes each<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are more, but I hope this gives you some insight into why it&#39;s <br/>\ndifficult to answer your question. All these costs can be quite high, <br/>\ndepending on your people, the code and your current project plans.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, let me share a story from my past. Readers here know the story <br/>\nwell, so I will just give you the key points. I once wrote a component <br/>\nin Java in 3 months, and it didn&#39;t quite work. I rewrote it using JUnit, <br/>\ndoing the best kind of test-driven development I knew how to do at the <br/>\ntime. The second time, I spent about 150 hours, which would be perhaps <br/>\n2.5 weeks (I worked overtime back then). If I needed to do it now, I <br/>\ncould probably do it in one week.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo here is a case of writing code in 3 months (probably 600 hours), <br/>\nspending at most 150 hours to test it (while learning how to write <br/>\ntests). I imagine that 150 hours to test 600 hours&#39; worth of code is a <br/>\ngood performance--it could have taken 1500 hours, if the codebase was <br/>\nbigger and more complex. This was Java code I wrote that integrated a <br/>\nthird-party Java tool, so it was low complexity, overall.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope that helps you. Good luck.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
