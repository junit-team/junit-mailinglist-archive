I have a number of tests to run that certain conditions\nare met in the execution of a components. I don&#39;t want to write a test\nper test condition because I don&#39;t know how many will be needed and I\ndon&#39;t want to rewrite the tests for each added (or removed condition). I\nguess this resembles most closely an array contents test however I don&#39;t\nknow how many elements are present and the array equality argument\ndoesn&#39;t apply:\n\nThe problem ofcourse is that if I loop through n conditions in a test,\nthe first one that fails will complete that test method but I want to\nreport multiple failures. The overall failure of the collection of\nconditions is not a fine grained enough a report.\n\nAny ideas, pointers?\n\nthanks\n\nchanoch\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe information transmitted is intended only for the person or entity to\nwhich it is addressed and may contain confidential and/or privileged\nmaterial.

To write a test, you simply\nextend TestCase, add your &quot;public void testYYY()&quot; methods.  You can then\nrun this test case with anyone of the several TestRunners.  You can also\nlook at J.B.&#39;s excellent starter guide at\nwww.diasparsoftware.com/articles/JUnit/jUnitStarterGuide.html.\n\n=jason\n\nOn Tue, 2002-08-13 at 20:11, Mert Nuhoglu wrote: Hello,\n\nI am a beginner to the JUnit framework. I didn&#39;t understand an issue\nabout the theory of JUnit.\n\nThe test methods defined in a TestCase class are supposed to override\nthe runTest method. How do they do that?\n\nLet me explain what I understood. There are two ways:\n\n1. According to the Adapter pattern with anonymous inner classes, each\ntest method is a subclass of the TestCase class.\n\nQuotation 1 (from A Cook&#39;s Tour):\nTestCase test= new MoneyTest(&quot;testMoneyEquals &quot;) { \n    protected void runTest() { testMoneyEquals(); } \n};\n\nHere runTest method is explicitly overridden. But where is this code\nsegment written? Inside the static suite method?\n\n2. According to the Pluggable Selector pattern, runTest method of\nTestCase class of the JUnit framework handles everything. Right?\n\nQuotation 2 (from A Cook&#39;s Tour):\nprotected void runTest() throws Throwable { \n    Method runMethod= null; \n    try { \n        runMethod= getClass().getMethod(fName, new Class[0]); \n    } catch (NoSuchMethodException e) { \n        assert(&quot;Method &#92;&quot;&quot;+fName+&quot;&#92;&quot; not found&quot;, false); \n    } \n    try { \n        runMethod.invoke(this, new Class[0]); \n    } \n    // catch InvocationTargetException and IllegalAccessException \n}\n\nAs far as I understood, runTest method reads somehow the name of the\ntest methods and invokes them.\n\nI would appreciate for your explanations...\n\nBest Regards.\nMert Nuhoglu\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n\nYahoo!
