You assume that asserts and test cases are equal\n&gt; in their importance.  What I want to know is whether or not a test has\n&gt; passed.  ...  So, why count asserts?  Perhaps to give\n&gt; that warm, fuzzy feeling... perhaps for some other reason.\n\nThe only important thing is whether the application works. Whatever else  we\nevaluate, whether it is the number of asserts, the number of tests, the number\nof test cases, or even whether we test at all, is just there to give us that\n&quot;warm, fuzzy feeling&quot; or to give us the shivers. The number of tests/asserts\ndoesn&#39;t prove anything but it does give us a hint at an appropriate body\ntemperature.\n\nI guess this whole discussion really boils down to what constitutes a test. I\nchoose to organize my tests so that I generally have one test per tested method,\nwith appropriately many asserts per test. Other programmers might want to\nrefactor my test code so that basically one assert per test was the rule. This\nis probably just a matter of taste. If so, it would be nice if JUnit would\nsupport both approaches - displaying the number of tests _and_ the number of\nasserts.\n\n- Tom\n\n\n\n",
