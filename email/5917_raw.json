That&#39;s pretty subjective.\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; The TestCase is taken, and by reflection is turned into a TestSuite.\n So\n&gt;&gt; is it a TestCase or a TestSuite?  That is an important distinction.\n&gt;&gt; The Model is not readily apparent.  A stable and predictable model\nis\n&gt;&gt; essential to good design--esp. in this case.  I have no problem with\n&gt;&gt; saying that a TestCollector dynamically creates a TestSuite from a\n&gt;&gt; collection of TestCases.  That is understandable.  I do have a\nproblem\n&gt;&gt; with the TestCase being treated as a TestSuite though.\n&gt;\n&gt;OK, I&#39;ll try to address this one.\n&gt;\n&gt;TestCase is a mechanism to allow fixture reuse.  An instance of a\n&gt;TestCase builds a fixture, runs a single test, and tears down the\n&gt;fixture. By allowing TestCase to contain multiple tests (i.e. public\n&gt;void testXXX() methods) you can share a fixture definition.\n&gt;\n&gt;Put another way, TestCase is NOT a way to conceptually group tests. \n&gt;Each TestCase subclass represents a fixture, and contains a group of\n&gt;tests that run in the context of that fixture. Once you realize this,\n&gt;you&#39;ll find yourself switching (as I did some time ago) from having a\n&gt;TestCase for each class you are testing (with a overly generic fixture\n&gt;of which pieces were used by the different tests) to organizing tests\n&gt;around the fixtures, with less regard for the classes being tested by\n&gt;each TestCase.\n&gt;\n&gt;TestSuite is a mechanism for grouping a collection of TestCase\ninstances\n&gt;and running them sequentially.  So, TestCase has the ability to create\na\n&gt;TestSuite containing all instances of itself (using reflection to\ncreate\n&gt;an instance for each constituent test).  Also, you have the ability to\n&gt;create explicit TestSuites by subclassing TestSuite and writing a\ncustom\n&gt;suite() method.  This is useful for collecting together groups of\n&gt;smaller TestSuites which can be other custom TestSuites, or TestSuites\n&gt;generated by TestCases.\n&gt;\n&gt;Both TestSuite and TestCase implement the Test interface. The\n&gt;TestRunners work with things that are Tests, hence we can point at any\n&gt;Test (ie TestSuite or TestCase) and recursively run all the contained\n&gt;tests.  The internal nodes are TestSuites and the leaves are\nTestCases.\n&gt;\n&gt;I hope that makes things clearer.\n\nRenaming TestCase to TestFixture would have made it clearer for me in\nthe beginning. The use of the term &quot;test case&quot; to represent a\ncollection of tests with common fixture is a nonstandard use of the\nterm. It sounds to me like nothing more than a name that looked good at\nfirst, but wasn&#39;t changed when perhaps it could have been. Everything\nis a TestSuite, although most of them are automatically generated for\nus. Once I made that connexion, everything became clear.\n\n&gt;Anyone think this would make a good topic for the TDD Coad Letter?\n\nYes.\n\nJ. B.
