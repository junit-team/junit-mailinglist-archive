A \nweb search reveals a couple other efforts to support unit testing, but \nit&#39;s tough to gauge how successful people have been with them.\n\nWere I doing J2ME development, I&#39;d find a way to unit (not integration) \ntest the bulk of the app irrespective of MIDP. I looked at a number of \nJ2ME examples. I have yet to come across one that isn&#39;t poorly designed \nand coded, with classes combining all sorts of concerns. UI + \ncommunications logic, command handling + parsing, game geometry/physics \n+ display logic, etc. All that parsing and math is easy to get wrong. \nIt&#39;s also very usable in other contexts if not married to the ME \nenvironment.\n\nI don&#39;t see a reason why the majority of the classes in an ME app \ncouldn&#39;t be broken down and unit-tested, and I found a few links that \nsuggest some people are doing just that. Presumably, any MIDP-specific \nstuff--which should be a small portion of the app--would have to be \nmocked and integration tested (and probably manually, based off what \nyou&#39;re telling me).\n\nBut there&#39;d still be considerable benefit to unit testing the rest of \nthe app. That&#39;s conjecture; I&#39;d like to hear from a hardcore TDD \ndeveloper who&#39;s actually done this. It could be a mess and useless \nendeavor, which says more about the quality of the environment than the \nvalue of TDD.\n\nI&#39;ve recently worked with customers using environments that don&#39;t \nsupport unit-testing very well. Working with a FoxPro developer, we were \nable to unit-test a good percentage (not all) of the code by \nrestructuring it a bit. What I found interesting is that a light almost \nimmediately went on in the Foxpro developer&#39;s head about the design \nbenefits of doing so.\n\nIf the environment doesn&#39;t support it, obviously you can&#39;t do complete \nunit-testing. One thing that is coming out of the interest in unit \ntesting is that the tool makers are figuring out how to design \nframeworks that more readily support testing (e.g. Spring), for better \nor worse.\n\nI seriously doubt that it&#39;d be necessary punt on an entire ME \napplication. And I suspect that any overhead related to how the \nenvironment had to be set up would be quickly paid off by the ability to \n&quot;close off&quot; large portions of the app.\n\nJeff\n\n-- \nLangr Software Solutions\nhttp://langrsoft.com\nAgile Java: Crafting Code With Test-Driven Development\n\n\n",
