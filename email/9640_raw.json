Can u direct to links\nor resource helpful in designing test suites in this area.\n\nThanks.\n\nRanjeet Sahay\n\n\n&quot;Leeuw van der, Tim&quot; wrote:\n\n&gt; This message is worth putting on display just for it&#39;s amazing\n&gt; content-to-sig ratio.\n&gt;\n&gt; Anyways, what do you want to test? There&#39;s many ways to test JMS related\n&gt; things, either with or without jUnit.\n&gt; If you abstract the JMS layer into a messaging-facade, you can replace the\n&gt; actual messaging-facade with a Mockup. The mockup directly connects the\n&gt; sender to the receiver and runs outside the app. server.\n&gt;\n&gt; Cut down and slice up as desired; you don&#39;t have to connect sender and\n&gt; receiver this way always - you can put a stub at either end to test them\n&gt; seperately.\n&gt;\n&gt; --Tim\n&gt;\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Kadam, Sal [mailto:skadam@...]\n&gt; Sent: woensdag 1 oktober 2003 22:59\n&gt; To: &#39;junit@yahoogroups.com&#39;\n&gt; Subject: [junit] How to test JMS code with any App. Server\n&gt;\n&gt; Guys,\n&gt;   Any thoughts.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks\n&gt;  Sal\n&gt; -----  This message is for the named person&#39;s use only.
