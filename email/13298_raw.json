There is a\nlog4j.properties file in the same directory that I&#39;m running the\njunit task, the log4j.properties file is in the classpath as well. \nThis works for me when running junit via IntelliJ so I know that\nlog4j.properties file is okay.  I&#39;ve even tried passing in the jvm\narg -Dlog4j.configuration parameter in the junit task and that\ndoesn&#39;t seem to work either.  I must be doing something obviously\nwrong but I can&#39;t seem to figure it out.   Thanks in advance. \n\n\n\nBrian Doyle\n\nI don&#39;t know about ignorance, and I don&#39;t care about apathy, but I simply will not put up with intolerance!  - Unknown\n\n\n\n\n",
