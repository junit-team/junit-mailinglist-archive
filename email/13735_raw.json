Again, the idea \n&gt; is to\n&gt;  &gt; make the intent obvious.\n&gt; \n&gt; I prefer the opposite. Use anything except setUp/tearDown. Constructors,\n&gt; field initializers, and local variables are all standard parts of Java\n&gt; that every competent Java programmer immediately understands.\n&gt; setUp()/tearDown() is the odd one out. It is a special thing that only\n&gt; works in JUnit. Since it doesn&#39;t do anything the other three don&#39;t, why\n&gt; reinvent the wheel?\n\n...because as soon as they try to do the same thing on another xUnit \nplatform, notably NUnit, they will find only [SetUp] and [TearDown] do \nwhat they expected.\n\nIncidentally, assuming you need to tear down fixture objects -- and \nadmittedly it&#39;s rare for me -- if you don&#39;t use tearDown(), then how do \nyou do it? (Or is it the case for you as for me that it just doesn&#39;t \ncome up much?)\n-- \nJ. B.
