Some of the other<br/>\n&gt; frameworks (utPLSQL, for example) already do this, but TextRunner<br/>\n&gt; seems to output next to nothing.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Is there some setting or addon that we can use to have this<br/>\n&gt; information output as well? (Short of modifying the Assert class, of<br/>\n&gt; course.)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; (I know there is discussion about whether such output has value. The<br/>\n&gt; environment I&#39;m working in requires FDA-specified validation, and at<br/>\n&gt; least the values being compared have to be reviewed by a human being<br/>\n&gt; before a final approval signature can be applied. Therefore, a<br/>\n&gt; simple &quot;OK&quot; is insufficient to to pass review.)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thank you for your insight!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You need to change Assert to do what you&#39;re proposing with JUnit.<br/>\n<br/>\nAn alternative is to use Fit/FitNesse for this testing. In case you&#39;re <br/>\nnot familiar with it, Fit operates on test data in tables, so that you <br/>\nalways see input, expected output, surrounding prose and test results. <br/>\nThe results show actual output only when it differs from expected output.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ.
