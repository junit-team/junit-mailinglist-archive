I created additional AllTest files at different levels of my project hierarchy. When I press F12 to run uTest, it always runs the same AllTest, the original one I had. The message output says it is loading AllTests.AllTests, which I deleted! <br/>\nHow do I instruct it to run my highest level AllTests?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\nScott<br/>\n:-&gt; Change is inevitable except from vending machines.</div>",
