One that we have been kicking around here in the\n&gt; office this week as well. We have been using the term &quot;syntactically\n&gt; correct&quot; to indicate a document that would pass some kind of XML\n&gt; validation. \n\nHm... you may prefer to use standard terminology.\n\n&quot;well-formed XML&quot; meaning all the tags open and close properly, and so on.\n&quot;DTD/XML schema conformant&quot; meaning that the document conforms to a \nDTD/XML schema.\n\nThe last thing we need as a community is more redundant terminology! :)\n\nSo you mean DTD conformant documents.\n\n &gt; However this does not mean the document makes sense in a\n&gt; browser - perhaps there are CSS mistakes or JavaScript mistakes, or\n&gt; basic HTML mistakes. If a document does make sense in a browser, we have\n&gt; been calling it &quot;semantically correct&quot;.\n\nWell, if the document conforms to an HTML-based DTD, then certainly a \nbrowser will understand it, except possibly for JavaScript errors.\n\n&gt; These are probably not the best use of the terms &quot;syntax&quot; and\n&gt; &quot;semantics&quot; but it seems to convey the intended difference.\n\nIndeed.\n\n&gt; Automating the process of testing if a page is syntactically correct\n&gt; seems to be reasonably easy through the use of an XML parser.\n\nChecking for conformance is very easy, yes.\n\n&gt; The semantic checking is a much more interesting problem. Validating\n&gt; CSS, or JavaScript is probably doable. But in my experience the biggest\n&gt; problem in testing a web application is the variety of browsers and OSs\n&gt; that are out there and attempting to cover even a small set of these in\n&gt; QA is resource intensive. Small differences in rendering that need to be\n&gt; tweaked with custom CSS, or certain tags that a browser docent support,\n&gt; or keywords that mean something in one browser and not another.\n\nBrowser compatibility testing takes work. HtmlUnit tries to do some of \nthis, by allowing you to set the HTTP client to mimic various browsers. \nIt does a good job, but could always go further. (Wanna help?)\n\n&gt; Anyone have any tools they use for this task? Are there any tools? Is it\n&gt; even reasonable to think that automation for this type of testing is\n&gt; possible?\n\nIt&#39;s possible, but it may not be worth it. Automate the easy stuff, then \nleave the compatibility testing to manual testers, at least until they \nnotice patterns in their testing you could automate.\n\nTake care.\n-- \nJ. B.
