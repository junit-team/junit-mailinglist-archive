I have a question about how best to apply JUnit to \nsolve my particular testing need.\n\nBasically I have a class (lets say Fruit.class) that is being mapped to \na database via an O/R  tool.  I would like to test this this mapping. \nSo I have a TestCase called FruitCRUDTestCase.  In my test case I have \ntest methods such as testCreate(), testRestore(), testUpdate(), and \ntestDelete().  Now, when writing these kind of tests before JUnit, I \ncould make the tests dependent on each other.  For example, if the \ntestCreate() method created an object, I could store a reference to it \nin an instance attribute and access again from the other test methods \n(testRestore() for example).  To my understanding, this does not seem to \nbe easily doable when using JUnit.  I can create a TestSuite that will \nexecute each of my test methods, I can even create an OrderedTestSuite \n(from gsbase) that will execute my test methods in the order that I \nspecify, but each test method will be executed within its own instance \nof TestCase so I can not use instance attributes to make data accessible \nbetween test methods.  Is there something that I am missing?\n\nNow I know that I can make the test methods completely independent to \nget around this problem, but why?  Making the test methods independent \nwould require duplicating effort since the testRestore() method would \nhave to create an object first (basically duplicate what is already \nbeing done in testCreate()).\n\nBasically I am looking for input before I write something myself.  Maybe \nsomeone has dealt with this problem before (I&#39;m sure some has -- it&#39;s \nnot that unique of a problem).  If so, please let me know how you&#39;ve \nsolved this.  I am willing to write a simple extension that will support \nthe type of behavior that I&#39;ve described, but maybe there is a better \nway of doing things.\n\nThanks,\n\n--Maciej\nmbz@...\n\n\n\n\n",
