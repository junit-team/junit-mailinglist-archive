That&#39;s by design (and it&#39;s a good design decision).<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can push these to a special snapshot repository and then ask your users<br/>\nto add three lines to their pom so that Maven will query that snapshot<br/>\nrepository. That&#39;s a good middle ground solution that I&#39;ve used a few times<br/>\nwith TestNG.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for pushing to a Maven repository, it&#39;s quite straightforward now and you<br/>\ncan now do it yourself (you no longer need to file a ticket and have someone<br/>\nfrom Maven do the push for you). You don&#39;t need to be a member of Apache<br/>\neither. Once you deploy to Nexus, it takes about an hour before it becomes<br/>\navailable on Maven central.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nCédric<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Tue, Aug 17, 2010 at 11:11 PM, Bogdan &lt;<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bogdan.mocanu.notifications@...\">bogdan.mocanu.notifications@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I would like to add something here, regarding the Maven repo push:<br/>\n&gt; - if you publish your versions of junit as SNAPSHOTS (such as<br/>\n&gt; 4.8.1-SNAPSHOT) (which I think you don&#39;t want), then yes, the users will get<br/>\n&gt; auto-updated and perhaps their tests might start failing in the morning,<br/>\n&gt; after such an update.<br/>\n&gt; - however, if you publish your versions as non-snapshot versions (such as<br/>\n&gt; 4.8.1), then the users will NOT be auto-updated. They have to manually<br/>\n&gt; select to use the new version that has just appeared in the repo, and this<br/>\n&gt; way if their tests start failing, they will know that they can either fix<br/>\n&gt; them to work with the new version of junit, or revert to the previous<br/>\n&gt; version.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am considering of taking up on this task with pushing junit to the public<br/>\n&gt; Maven repo, but I have to first learn what is exactly the process for this<br/>\n&gt; (perhaps signing up at Apache as contributor, or smt).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Bogdan<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, David Saff &lt;david@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; On Tue, Aug 17, 2010 at 6:28 PM, pniederw &lt;pniederw@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;ve noticed that JUnit includes an (outdated) version of Hamcrest.<br/>\n&gt; Will future JUnit version continue to ship with Hamcrest?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Yes, having made this decision, we&#39;ll stick to it until convinced it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; doing more harm than good.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Do you have plans to update to Hamcrest 1.2 or higher?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Unfortunately, the last time we looked at the typing changes in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hamcrest 1.2, we found that we couldn&#39;t automatically upgrade people<br/>\n&gt; &gt; without changing compiling tests into non-compiling tests, and, if I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; remember, in a few pathological cases, passing tests into failing<br/>\n&gt; &gt; tests.  We guessed that of people who used the hamcrest features<br/>\n&gt; &gt; bundled with JUnit, there were more that would be hurt by a version<br/>\n&gt; &gt; change than would be helped by it, so we&#39;ve stayed here.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Why is there no junit-dep anymore, i.e. how are we supposed to use<br/>\n&gt; JUnit with Hamcrest 1.2?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; junit-dep has been up on github for every release.  Whoever has been<br/>\n&gt; &gt; putting JUnit up on maven, I take it, hasn&#39;t been also putting up<br/>\n&gt; &gt; junit-dep?  I&#39;m sorry to say that I&#39;m very aware that a lot of people<br/>\n&gt; &gt; are indebted to the anonymous time-donor who&#39;d been keeping the maven<br/>\n&gt; &gt; repos up-to-date until several months ago.  I&#39;ve been reluctant to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; accept full responsibility for feeding a repository I neither use nor<br/>\n&gt; &gt; fully understand until some point where I was sure I could quickly<br/>\n&gt; &gt; respond to millions of users who got their junit jars auto-updated in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; a way that broke all their tests.
