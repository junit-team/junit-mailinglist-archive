It&#39;s not very general, but here&#39;s what\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve got/done, and a Question:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; * AbstractTestGraph is the class [subclass, eventually, of TestCase] of\n&gt; &gt;   tests for Graph; subclasses must define getGraph() to return the Graph\n&gt; &gt;   to be tested.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; * There are three styles of Graph, so each new implementation of Graph at\n&gt; &gt;   the moment has to generate three new subclasses of AbstractTestGraph,\n&gt; &gt;   one for each style of Graph for getGraph, and suite them up together.\n&gt; &gt;   Ikky.\n&gt;\n&gt; To avoid this, pass the Graph to the graph test as a constructor. The\n&gt; graph test stores the graph in a field (as part of the fixture).\n\nThe &quot;Ikky&quot; applied to the original code; the revised code I described doesn&#39;t\nneed to do it, because the class gets passed into the suite-construction,\nand it replicates the test for each style, extracting the constructor from the\ngraph class as you suggest.\n\n&gt; What I haven&#39;t solved to my satisfaction is how best to create a\n&gt; parameterized test case that runs multiple tests with the same\n&gt; parameters. If I override runTest(), then that runs only one test, which\n&gt; I don&#39;t like. I want to know how to do this without re-implementing the\n&gt; code in JUnit that invokes a test by reflection.\n\nI gave up and re-implemented [a useful fragment of] that code. \n\n&gt; &gt; And the Question is, why are TestSuite::isPublicTestMethod and\n&gt; &gt; TestSuite::isTestMethod *private*? Because even if I wrote a subclass\n&gt; &gt; of TestSuite, rather than using methods in MetaTestGraph, I wouldn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; be able to re-use them ...\n&gt;\n&gt; There was no need to make them non-private until now, I guess. :)\n\nThere wasn&#39;t a need to make them private in the first place, surely.\n\n-- \nChris &quot;electric hedgehog&quot; Dollin\nC FAQs at: http://www.faqs.org/faqs/by-newsgroup/comp/comp.lang.c.html\nC welcome: http://www.angelfire.com/ms3/bchambless0/welcome_to_clc.html\n\n",
