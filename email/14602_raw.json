Could you have several Fixture classes, one\nhierarchy per\n&gt; interface hierarchy, and construct the appropriate fixtures in setUp()?\n\nWhat I&#39;m already doing is creating a TestCases (or a hierarchy where\nappropriate) for each interface. These test cases are used directly as\nbase classes when I&#39;m testing a class implementing only one interface.\n\nMy problem is using delegation when I have to combine several of these\ntest cases. I understand what delegation is, and I know how to use it\nwith simple objects. But then again, JUnit fixtures still seem really\nmysterious to me :-).\n \nI can probably start with getting my head around Mikhail Shnayderman&#39;s\nanswer (http://groups.yahoo.com/group/junit/message/14534) and yours\nof course.\n\nI&#39;m going to &quot;do my homework&quot; now and try to come up with something as\neasy to use/understand as I can. I&#39;ll come back for advice on my solution.\n\nIn the meantime, I have found a workaround thanks to Joe Rainsberger&#39;s\nanswer (http://groups.yahoo.com/group/junit/message/14535) and Jason\nTibbetts&#39; (http://groups.yahoo.com/group/junit/message/14549) bonus tip.\n\nI posted an answer to the latter containing a working code sample\n(http://groups.yahoo.com/group/junit/message/14558). However, after\ntrying it &quot;on the field&quot;, I chose to stick with Joe&#39;s simpler solution\nin order not to end up with possibly large test classes containing\nseveral &quot;interface-specific&quot; internal classes. \n\nModern IDE&#39;s make it easy to navigate in such files, but I tend to\nlike my files short and to avoid internal classes.\n\nTo be honest I had never thought about studying the internals of JUnit\nbefore I faced this problem. You guys made it so easy to write tests\nwithout knowing anything about how JUnit was implemented that I\nthought I would never have to :-) (damn I&#39;m lazy!).\n\nThanks again for taking the time to answer my question and thank you\nand Erich Gamma for JUnit and your contributions to evolution of\nsoftware development!\n\nDimitri\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
