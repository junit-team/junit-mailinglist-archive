As long as you have a \nconnection object you should be able to query it.\n\n &gt; Or ordering\n&gt; methods and then calling them in that order?  \n\nNo problem at all. Of course you can call methods in the order you want. \nThat&#39;s the whole point. It is your decision in which order you invoke \nmethods on an object. The class does not say some orders are OK but some \naren&#39;t. if the method&#39;s public, you can invoke it.\n\n&gt; Or creating widgets, adding\n&gt; listeners and then starting the main Swing thread?\n\nFine. You can add listeners whenever you feel like it. We normally add \nthem before we display the widget, but if it&#39;s necessary to add or \nremove them later we can do that.\n\nI&#39;m not sure what you mean by the &quot;main Swing thread&quot;. if that&#39;s the \nsame as the main AWT thread, it&#39;s started automatically as necessary. it \ndoes not need to be started through the public API. That&#39;s as it should be.\n\n&gt;&gt;The problem comes about when people design APIs that require \n&gt;&gt;something like g.initializeContext(), g.setColor, and \n&gt;&gt;g.setFont before I&#39;m allowed to call g.drawLine. Any \n&gt;&gt;initialization that&#39;s necessary for an object to get into its \n&gt;&gt;correct state should be performed in the constructor.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s good advice, it&#39;s just impossibly hard to achieve in reality.\n&gt; Otherwise, we would never need setters.\n\nSetters are for *changing* the state of an object, not for initializing it.\n\n&gt;&gt;Complicated sequences of code execution are relics of \n&gt;&gt;procedural thinking.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; We&#39;re not talking about &quot;complicated&quot; but &quot;ordered&quot;.\n\nOrder is fine. The problem is when some orders are allowed and others \nare not. Only legal, reasonable orders should be accessible through the \npublic interface.\n\n\n\n-- \nElliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nXML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim\n\n",
