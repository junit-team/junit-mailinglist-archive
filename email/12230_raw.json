However it looks like that I\n&gt; will have to run my tests in a container, meaning I have to use\n&gt; Cactus. I don&#39;t think I can do this with Cactus because they\n&gt; instantiate TestCase. If there is a way I would love to know.\n\nYou can&#39;t, as the book says. :)\n\nCheck back with Cactus, though: I told Vince about this and he said he \nmight try to fix the problem. The question is whether it was high enough \npriority to be done.\n\nYou have a few choices:\n\n1. Use Cactus, but be forced to use the &quot;check()&quot; pattern that someone \non this list mentioned. (Kevin? Chris?)\n\n2. Change the test so that it doesn&#39;t need to run in a container, then \napply the Parameterized Test Case pattern. The book is full of \nsuggestions for moving tests outside of the container.\n\nWhat&#39;s the reason for the container in the first place?\n\nTake care.\n-- \nJ. B.
