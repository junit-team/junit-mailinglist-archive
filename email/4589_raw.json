It was never designed for that. It was \n&gt; never designed for that *on purpose*. I don&#39;t know why that is such a big \n&gt; deal. You don&#39;t like it, that&#39;s cool. Use something else, but don&#39;t mess up \n&gt; JUnit.\n\n\nAccessing private fields may go into the same direction, but it can \nsometimes be quite useful:\n\n- what if the state of you objects suddenly become unstable?  For \nexample, somewhere a private long variable becomes 0 because of some \nheavy computation and loss of precision (due to / or * for example). \nYour unit test may still be ok (first iteration of your methods) but it \nmay be difficult to simulate the 10,000th iteration, or 1,000,000th \niteration.  Accessing private fields may help you to quickly reset your \nclasses into some state (like in a debugger).  But maybe JUnit is not \nthe right tool for this kind of problems.\n\n- when testing, you should ensure that the state of your object is valid \n(pre and post conditions).  If you use private variables and don&#39;t \nexpose them via getters, it&#39;s difficult to assert their values (assert \nin Jdk1.4 is nice, inner classes are ugly)\n\n\n-Vladimir\n\n-- \nVladimir Bossicard\nwww.bossicard.com\n\n\n",
