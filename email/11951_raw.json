This is a classic source of error in software, and\n&gt;  &gt; I would hate to see you present it to students as a good idea.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Also, in your example, the price can be wrong by up to 1% in either\n&gt;  &gt; direction! Is this really what you want? If the price comes back as\n&gt;  &gt; 7.93, that&#39;s good enough?! No way.\n&gt; \n&gt; That depends on your need. Using longs to represent everything in \n&gt; pennies fails when you are attempting to use multiple currencies. \n\n&lt;snip-explanation /&gt;\n\nAgreed. I was merely suggesting something better, but simple, rather \nthan a real solution, which would involve a Money class of some kind.\n\n&gt;       Now all of this could be avoided if you accept 4 decimal digits \n&gt; for money - 1 away from your significant should cancel any rounding \n&gt; errors, or you can get each transaction as an individual. However, if \n&gt; you only get a lump long for the amount then it won&#39;t work.\n\nEven if you keep 4 decimal digits, if you multiply that value by, say, \n100,000 (or worse, 92,582), you still lose accuracy.\n\n&gt; I have found BigDecimal is actually very accurate when you initially \n&gt; load values into them using Strings [new BigDecimal(&quot;10.56&quot;)], so I have \n&gt; been using them.\n\nI haven&#39;t tried that, myself, so I should. Still, if one likes the Whole \nValue pattern, one prefers to have a Money class, that knows about \nmoney-related issues and can do money-related things.\n\nThanks for the alternatives. They&#39;re /always/ valuable.\n-- \nJ. B. Rainsberger,\nDiaspar Software Services\nhttp://www.diasparsoftware.com :: +1 416 791-8603\nLet&#39;s write software that people understand\n\n",
