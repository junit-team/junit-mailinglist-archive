B. Rainsberger&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jbr@...\">jbr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; I&#39;m not sure why writing the test before the stub provides more<br/>\n&gt;&gt; documentation than writing the stub before the test.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;All this is about &quot;tests documenting the intentions behind the code&quot;.<br/>\n&gt;What I ment by &quot;documenting aspect&quot; does not depend on which <br/>\n&gt;comes first, but if tests and app are in sync. To keep them in sync<br/>\n&gt;is much more easy, if one is the base for generating the other.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>&lt;snip /&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I understand you correctly, you&#39;re trying to make the tests better<br/>\ndocumentation for the behavior of the system. Your concern appears to<br/>\nbe that as we refactor the system, the tests become less of an<br/>\nindicator of the structure of the application, so that finding the<br/>\ntests for class X becomes difficult.<br/>\n<br/>\nImmediately, I react by saying, &quot;Don&#39;t look for the tests for class X;<br/>\nlook for the tests for behavior Y. Those tests should remain easy to<br/>\nfind, since the name of the behavior doesn&#39;t necessarily change when<br/>\nthe structure of the code changes.&quot; Without a specific example, I can&#39;t<br/>\nsay more.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we refactor the code, we often need to change the corresponding<br/>\ntests. We should take as much care in refactoring the tests as the<br/>\ncode, so that it remains easy to find the tests.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Imagine you want to add some new feature to an application <br/>\n&gt;with this kind of tests in three years from now. You need to <br/>\n&gt;modify some code and maybe you need to use some <br/>\n&gt;existing code too. Then you want to understand, what the <br/>\n&gt;intention behind those portions of code was. You want to <br/>\n&gt;understand the methods you are about to modify/use.<br/>\n&gt;Yes, you can search the tests for uses of those method.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;When I want to get an idea, what the method &quot;xyz&quot; is <br/>\n&gt;supposed to do, I prefer to look at &quot;testXyz&quot;. That is what<br/>\n&gt;I ment with the &quot;documenting aspect&quot; of tests that follow<br/>\n&gt;the structure of the application.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;ll admit that I don&#39;t have as much experience in that regard -- I<br/>\nhaven&#39;t worked on a project where the tests have been difficult to find<br/>\nbecause the code has been refactored away from the tests, even though<br/>\nthe tests still run. For Programmer Tests, I can&#39;t imagine that that&#39;s<br/>\neven possible. For Customer Tests, I would never expect to find a CT by<br/>\nlooking for a method name; I would look for the name of a use case or<br/>\ntransaction script or feature.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;JUnitDoclet allows re-generating, so it&#39;s not much work <br/>\n&gt;to keep tests and app in sync.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Regenerating what? Does it regenerate test stubs? Do I need to<br/>\nreimplement my test?!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; Also, if you haven&#39;t written the test, then how can you be sure that<br/>\n&gt;&gt; the stub:<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; 1. ...has the proper signature?<br/>\n&gt;&gt; 2. ...is named well?<br/>\n&gt;&gt; 3. ...should be class- or instance-level?<br/>\n&gt;&gt; 4. ...is written on the appropriate object?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;At that point I&#39;m not sure either. But with the skeleton of <br/>\n&gt;the application method in place, one can use the full power <br/>\n&gt;of the IDE. I&#39;m using JUnitDoclet together with IDEA.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>&lt;snip /&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI admit that since the IDE makes it easy to &quot;fix mistakes&quot;, we have the<br/>\nfreedom to make more mistakes and not pay as much of a price; but<br/>\nstill, nothing beats thinking about it first.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would have to try writing the stub, then the test, then making it<br/>\npass, in order to comment further. Since I&#39;m not working on any big<br/>\nprojects these days, I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ll learn enough to make the<br/>\nexperiment worthwhile. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; Generally speaking, you don&#39;t really know these things until you<br/>\n </span></blockquote>write<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; test code, which is really just sample client code, look at it,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; evaluate it and move on. In general, it is when one sees it &quot;in<br/>\n </span></blockquote>print&quot;<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; than one really looks at it carefully. Writing the test first<br/>\n&gt;&gt; guarantees this, while writing the stub first does not.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I consider the stub to be flexible when implementing the test. <br/>\n&gt;There is not much of a difference, except we are using <br/>\n&gt;different supporting features of the IDE.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You&#39;re right. You&#39;re willing to guess as to the stub&#39;s signature and<br/>\nchange it when you guess wrong. I prefer not to guess, but rather to<br/>\nlet the test tell me. There isn&#39;t much difference when a good IDE is<br/>\nthere to support you.<br/>\n<br/>\nI suppose that the more you guess wrong, the more information that<br/>\ngives you -- perhaps you DON&#39;T understand the task you&#39;re trying to<br/>\nimplement. Back to the CRC cards...<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; I don&#39;t use JUnitDoclet, so I can&#39;t comment on how using it changes<br/>\n </span></blockquote>the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; rules of the game. If it&#39;s easy to set up (less than 1 hour), then I<br/>\n&gt;&gt; may start using it, just for the experience.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;d be glad to help, if there would be a problem. <br/>\n&gt;If you want to look at JUnitDoclet before you install it:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.junitdoclet.org/demo.html\">http://www.junitdoclet.org/demo.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;ll check it out...<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; I would like you to expand on this: what &quot;documenting aspect&quot; do you<br/>\n&gt;&gt; mean? and why does writing the stub first enable this feature and<br/>\n&gt;&gt; writing the test first not enable this feature?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I hope, my lines in the beginning of this email clarified, <br/>\n&gt;what I ment. Sorry, if I wasn&#39;t more precise in former emails.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It did. Thanks.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJ. B.
