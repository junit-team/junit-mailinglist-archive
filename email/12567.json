I&#39;ve grabbed XMLUnit for<br/>\nJUnit and have set up a basic XMLTestCase, however the biggest problem<br/>\nI have now is dealing with my files included by the XSL under test.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo this question may be more about structuring development directories<br/>\nthan actually using XMLUnit.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom my project&#39;s root in my development environment, I have my XSL<br/>\nfiles in this directory:<br/>\n<br/>\n./web/xsl/html4/&lt;my XSL files here&gt;<br/>\n./web/xsl/html4/include/&lt;common files I include in &#39;base&#39; XSL files&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhere . is the root of the project as checked out from my version<br/>\ncontrol (other subdirectories besides /web are /src, /test, /lib,<br/>\netc.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut my XSL include files are written to access the include directory<br/>\nassuming they are being executed from the web application context --<br/>\nthat is, here&#39;s a sample include line:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;xsl:include href=&quot;/WEB-INF/xsl/html4/includes/commonIncl.xsl&quot;/&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I run XMLUnit on my XSL file, the above line fails as the<br/>\ntransformer can&#39;t find the resource<br/>\nfile:/WEB-INF/xsl/html4/includes/commonIncl.xsl.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHow do you normally structure your build directories or handle this<br/>\ninclude problem when testing XSL files outside of the container?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your advice, and Happy New Year,<br/>\n<br/>\nDan</div>",
