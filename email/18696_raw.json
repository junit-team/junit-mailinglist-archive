The system would not \nproduce the test case:\n &gt; a = new Point(0, 0);\n &gt; b = new Point(3, 4);\n &gt; assertEquals(5, a.distanceTo(b));\n\ninstead (since, in my example I coded the wrong distance function) it \nwould produce:\n\nassertEquals(7, a.distance(b));\n\nand the test would pass.  So I would have to manually check every \npassing test case to make sure that it was valid. Bummer.\n\nI would need be able to add something like:\n\n//** Test Point(0,0), Point(3,4), 5.0 **//\n\nas a guide to the test generator as to what was expected. Then, in \naddition to all the other valuable verification tests of corner cases, \netc.; it could generate the validation test.  In our lexicon, \nverification tests demonstrate that whatever the software is doing, it \nis doing correctly. Validation tests confirm that the software is doing \nthe correct thing.  Using both, we confirm that it is both doing the \nright thing, and doing it correctly.  Automated test generation is \nexcellent for verification, the question becomes how to we generate \nvalidation tests as well, without overloading the programmer.\n\nPerhaps, at this point, it is sufficient to automate the verification \ntests, and leave the validation up to the developer. Possibly, with a \nstructured requirements document, we could extract data for validation, \nand automate that as well?\n\nJust rambling,\nJim\n\nKevin Lawrence wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On 1/9/07, James P. Gunderson &lt;jgunders@... \n&gt; &lt;mailto:jgunders%40gamma-two.com&gt;&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt;  &gt; However, if I program the distance calculation incorrectly (perhaps I \n&gt; calculate the manhattan &gt; distance instead of the euclidian) how does \n&gt; the analyzing program &#39;know&#39; that I coded the\n&gt;  &gt; wrong function?\n&gt; \n&gt; I agree that this a difficult problem.\n&gt; \n&gt; One thing that a tool could do is give some examples of calling the\n&gt; function with boundary conditions or perhaps with special cases (like\n&gt; 0 or -3 or null) that you, the programmer, did not think of. For\n&gt; simple cases, like your distance between two points example, the tool\n&gt; could show some examples like\n&gt; \n&gt; a = new Point(0, 0);\n&gt; b = new Point(3, 4);\n&gt; assertEquals(5, a.distanceTo(b));\n&gt; \n&gt; and have the developer review the cases it generates. This would get\n&gt; tedious quite quickly for methods with complex arguments though.\n&gt; \n&gt; Kevin\n&gt; \n&gt; www.junitfactory.com\n&gt; You send us code. We send you tests.
