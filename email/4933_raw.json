B. Rainsberger&quot; &lt;jbr@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;junit@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Friday, May 10, 2002 10:01 PM\nSubject: Re: [junit] assertEquals(Object, Object)\n\n\n&gt; &gt; it seems to me that these methods does not test transitivity of\n&gt; &gt; equals, which is declared in Java Specification.\n&gt;\n&gt; assertEquals() checks two objects for equality according to the equals()\n&gt; method. It is not designed to test the validity of your equals() method;\n&gt; quite the opposite, it relies on the correctness of your equals() method.\n&gt;\n&gt; You may be looking for an &quot;Equals Tester&quot;: a class that tests that your\n&gt; implementation of equals() forms an equivalence relation on objects of\nyour\n&gt; class. That you would have to build yourself. I wish I had one in a common\n&gt; package to offer you, but I don&#39;t.\n&gt;\n&gt;  I think\n&gt; &gt; documentation should state that assertEquals(p1,p2) is completely\n&gt; &gt; equiv to assertTrue(p1.equals(p2)) am i right? assertEquals public\n&gt; &gt; static void assertEquals(java.lang.String message,\n&gt; &gt;              java.lang.Object expected,\n&gt; &gt;   java.lang.Object actual)  Asserts that two objects are equal. If\n&gt; &gt; they are not an AssertionFailedError is thrown.\n&gt;\n&gt; I believe assertEquals(o1, o2) essentially does this:\n&gt;\n&gt; if( o1 == null ) {\n&gt;     assertTrue(o1 == o2);\n&gt; }\n&gt; else {\n&gt;     assertTrue(o1.equals(o2));\n&gt; }\n&gt;\n&gt; If it doesn&#39;t, then I think I&#39;d better look at the source again, because\n&gt; that&#39;s what I expect it to do.\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt; J.
