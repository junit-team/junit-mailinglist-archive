I could not compile the<br/>\ntests if my life depended on it, and I had my own test cases that<br/>\ncompiled over and over.<br/>\n<br/>\nI went to compile the newly created MapperTest.java and ran into this<br/>\nproblem:<br/>\n<br/>\nMapperTest.java [14.1] No method found matching run(Test)<br/>\n\tjunit.textui.TestRunner.run(suite());<br/>\nMapperTest.java [18.1] Incompatible type for return.<br/>\n\treturn new TestSuite(MapTest.class);<br/>\n2 errors<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, I did a search within this group for any hints why this would<br/>\noccur, since I&#39;ve never had the problem before. I have not found<br/>\nanything yet, but have found the solution. I thought I should share<br/>\nthe experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nWithin the same package as where the MapTest.java was, existed a<br/>\nTest.class (and Test.java). The developer&#39;s Test.class did not have<br/>\nthe appropriate run method, and therefore could not work.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot that anyone would ever have this problem starting out with junit,<br/>\nbut if you happen to take over code from developers and they&#39;ve<br/>\ncreated a Test.class within the package, just delete or rename the<br/>\nTest.class and all will go back into the green.<br/>\n<br/>\nHopefully this will help someone someday.<br/>\n<br/>\nTerry</div>",
