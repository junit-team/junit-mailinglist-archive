    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1321253978\">A few months ago I inherited the &#39;spike&#39; code from a<br/>\nprevious developer who was no longer with the company<br/>\nwho had hired me as a contractor.  There were a few<br/>\nclasses in the repository, so the first task I set for<br/>\nmyself was adding unit tests for them, as none<br/>\nexisted.  As I started trying to craft tests for what<br/>\nI thought the classes were doing, it led to me moving<br/>\nthe old classes into another (backup) package, and<br/>\nrewriting new tests and classes in the regular<br/>\npackage.  While writing the tests I saw things I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t like, classes that were doing too much or too<br/>\nlittle, etc.  In the end, I had a better understanding<br/>\nof what the old classes were supposed to do, and the<br/>\nnew classes worked much better than the old ones from<br/>\nthe spike.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, I will admit, at that time I was only dealing<br/>\nwith about 8-10 classes, so going that route wasn&#39;t as<br/>\npainful as it could be with ten times that number. <br/>\nWith a huge number of classes, I might take a slightly<br/>\ndifferent approach.  For example, taking the classes<br/>\ninvolved in the greatest number of customer complaints<br/>\n(bug reports, whatever) OR the classes dealing with<br/>\nsomething the customer wanted changed, and writing<br/>\ntests for those and changing the classes as needed.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Eric<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Alan Bram &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:alan@...\">alan@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; In this discussion, apparently we have been talking<br/>\n&gt; about &quot;retrofitting&quot; unit tests for old code that<br/>\n&gt; never before had them. The notion seems to be that<br/>\n&gt; each method in a class, or perhaps each public<br/>\n&gt; method, should have a unit test.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I think this is wrong. I think, as J.B. said, that<br/>\n&gt; in such a case you should concentrate on testing<br/>\n&gt; features, not simply methods.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I would say that for new code, where you&#39;re writing<br/>\n&gt; tests along with your production code, it might make<br/>\n&gt; sense to try for a test per (public) method. But<br/>\n&gt; that&#39;s because in this case you have the benefit of<br/>\n&gt; thinking about the testing at the time you&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; writing the code. I think you&#39;re more likely to<br/>\n&gt; design your code in such a way as to have this make<br/>\n&gt; more sense. (The &quot;testing influences design&quot;<br/>\n&gt; notion.)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The problem I see with mindlessly (or even<br/>\n&gt; mindfully) writing a test for each method, just to<br/>\n&gt; satisfy someone&#39;s idea that code coverage is good,<br/>\n&gt; is that you&#39;re likely to (1) invest a lot of (or<br/>\n&gt; even a little) time; and (2) generate a lot of test<br/>\n&gt; code (which will have to be maintained, don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; forget), for what will turn out to be little or no<br/>\n&gt; benefit. I would bet that the marginal number of<br/>\n&gt; bugs found by &quot;complete&quot; per-method tests over a<br/>\n&gt; more sensible per-feature approach, both now and<br/>\n&gt; forever in the future, is very close to zero. At<br/>\n&gt; least that&#39;s my impression based on my own<br/>\n&gt; experiences.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; More is not always better.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I would be very curious to know if anyone can report<br/>\n&gt; on actual (measured, quantitative) experiences that<br/>\n&gt; either support or refute this.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  - Alan Bram<br/>\n&gt;    <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:alan@...\">alan@...</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
