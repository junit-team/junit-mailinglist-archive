But, measuring coverage (and quality with a tool like JesTer)<br/>\nis useful with a group that is still learning to TDD properly.  It&#39;s<br/>\nnot so much looking for full coverage as an indication that all is<br/>\nright, it&#39;s more looking for holes in the coverage that indicate that<br/>\ntests are missing.  And, yes, 100% is unrealistic because there will<br/>\nalways be things that don&#39;t need testing.. like toString methods that<br/>\nare to make test results more meaningful.<br/>\n<br/>\nDave</div>",
