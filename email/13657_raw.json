However I do \n&gt; reparse on every tes=\r\nt method, and it&#39;s not that big a deal. \n\nOh it will become one, trust me :=\r\n-)\n\nTests (not just unit tests, all tests) should go as fast as possible.  =\r\nThe\nfaster they go, the more inclined developers will be to run them on a\nr=\r\negular basis or, ideally, every time before they commit something.\n\nWhen yo=\r\nur tests start taking a long time, they only get run at night and the\n&quot;fail=\r\nure report/fix/retest&quot; cycle takes increasingly longer, making it\nharder to=\r\n identify new breakages.\n\nWhen I try to optimize the speed of my tests, the=\r\n first thing I do is appy\nthe principle &quot;Don&#39;t Repeat Yourself&quot;.  Not in te=\r\nrms of code, but of\nruntime.  If something only needs to be run once, I mak=\r\ne sure it only gets\nrun once.  Having as much control as possible on this w=\r\nas of paramount\nimportance to me, which is why TestNG extends JUnit&#39;s setUp=\r\n/tearDown\nprinciple to work around test classes, test suites and even test =\r\ngroups.\nThis gives you maximal control on the granularity of your setUp/tea=\r\nrDown\ncycle.\n\nSo my question to you is:  why do you reparse this file on ev=\r\nery test method\nwhen it&#39;s not necessary?  Because JUnit doesn&#39;t give you an=\r\ny\n&quot;setUp/tearDown&quot; method around classes?\n\n&gt; The key is that I do the repar=\r\nse for large files in each test \n&gt; method rather than in setUp or the const=\r\nructor so that those \n&gt; methods that don&#39;t need to parse the file don&#39;t do =\r\nit.\n\nIn this case, I would recommend breaking down your test class in a par=\r\nent\nclass for all the test methods that don&#39;t need this file and a subclass=\r\n for\nall the test methods that do need this file.  Then you can put the rep=\r\narse\nof your file in setUp(), which -- as someone said earlier -- makes the=\r\n\nintent obvious.\n\nLet me stress this point further.\n\nIn JUnit, you have fou=\r\nr ways to initialize / tear down your test, and they\nare *all* equivalent:\n=\r\n\n- At the beginning and end of each test method\n- In setUp()/tearDown()\n- I=\r\nn the constructor\n- At the field declaration level\n\nI find that confusing a=\r\ns hell, so I *strongly* recommend to use\nsetUp/tearDown at the exclusion of=\r\n everything else.  Again, the idea is to\nmake the intent obvious.\n\n-- \nC=E9=\r\ndric\nhttp://beust.com/weblog\n\n\n\n",
