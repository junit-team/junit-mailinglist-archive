I want my <br/>\ncompany to start using it, but in order to sell the idea I would like <br/>\nto be able to call on success/failure stories of the use of JUnit on <br/>\nprojects.  If you have the time, I would appreciate any stories of <br/>\nhow JUnit was used successfully on your project, where there any <br/>\ndisadvantages of using JUnit, do you think it improved your <br/>\nproductivity etc?  I would like to quote companies, but I appreciate <br/>\nthat you may think this is sensitive material, so I think the best I <br/>\ncan hope for is to see if the majority of responses liked using JUnit <br/>\nor not.  Either way, thank you in advance for your help.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards<br/>\n<br/>\nMik Q</div>",
