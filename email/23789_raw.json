Refactoring should be very easy.\n\nAs =\r\nI&#39;m starting to learn and play with AspectJ, I&#39;d try that (but would not be=\r\nt money on this being a good idea). This would allow to intercept calls to =\r\nSystem.out.print() and alike, and tweak it print the argument(s) of the pri=\r\nnt()-statement augmented with the class to which the calling method belongs=\r\n.\n\n \n\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, kristian@... wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Sorry, I was d=\r\noing just what I sometimes dislike of our own users ;)\n&gt; \n&gt; The real proble=\r\nm I want to solve is associating console output from a running thread to a =\r\ngiven test-case (for parallel runs). We have this fairly well covered alrea=\r\ndy and we manage to capture everything that happens within a given test-cas=\r\ne for that test-case.\n&gt; \n&gt; The real problem is that the RunListener API doe=\r\ns not demarcate test-classes properly, so I am unable to distinguish consol=\r\ne output happening in @AfterClass of one test with @BeforeClass on the test=\r\n-class on the same thread.\n&gt; \n&gt; This problem has been in the corner of my e=\r\nye for quite some time and I&#39;ve been trying to find a decent angle to solve=\r\n it from. I promise not to do anything that is frowned upon, which is why I=\r\n asked ;)\n&gt; \n&gt; Kristian\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In junit@yahoogroups.com, Matthew Farwe=\r\nll &lt;matthew@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Kristian,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In reading your original ma=\r\nil, I was also confused as to what you wanted to\n&gt; &gt; achieve.

It works for simple cases but with =\r\ncustomized\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Runner-classes and new JUnit-features (e.g. the introducti=\r\non of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; JUnit-Rules) the result is usually bad and it discourages the I=\r\nDE users\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (i.e. the developers) from taking full advantage of JUnit!\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; However, Maven (versions 2.0-2.2) and its Surefire-plugin has ha=\r\nndled the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; JUnit-integration wonderfully, as far as I know, so your po=\r\nst worries me a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; little. What is it that you want to accomplish by mov=\r\ning away from the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; successful(!) &quot;Junitcore+RunListener based approach=\r\n&quot;?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Henrik\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In junit@yahoogroups.com, krist=\r\nian@ wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I maintain the junit provid=\r\ner for maven-surefire, and I&#39;m looking into\n&gt; &gt; &gt; transitioning from a Juni=\r\ntcore+RunListener based approach to an approach\n&gt; &gt; &gt; based on something li=\r\nke BlockJUnit4ClassRunner.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Unfortunately I cannot subclass =\r\nthe BlockJUnit4ClassRunner since the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; client code itself may need to d=\r\no that, so I&#39;d somehow need to put &quot;my&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Runner in front of the clie=\r\nnt-supplied one, maybe something proxy like.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Anyone have an=\r\ny tips on this, maybe some existing code that does this ?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; K=\r\nristian\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of thi=\r\ns message have been removed]\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n",
