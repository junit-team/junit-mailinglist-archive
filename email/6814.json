I see what you are saying.  I can make a &quot;Factory&quot; which assures <br/>\n&gt;the existance of one instance of my &quot;ConfigManager&quot; object.  This <br/>\n&gt;will probably solve the problem since I can &quot;substitute&quot; (make a mock <br/>\n&gt;object) for the &quot;ConfigManager&quot;, or for whatever objects it uses.  <br/>\n&gt;The factory is now the singleton that I must call like so: <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;MyFactory.getInstance().getConfigManager();<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;where the returned &quot;ConfigManager&quot; is now an interface or abstract <br/>\n&gt;class, whose concrete instance may be either a real or mock object.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Is this correct?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That would certainly work.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I liked your article &quot;Use your singletons wisely&quot;, however I did not <br/>\n&gt;fully grasp the &quot;three questions&quot;:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;1)Will every application use this class exactly the same way? <br/>\n&gt;(exactly is the key word) <br/>\n&gt;2)Will every application ever need only one instance of this class? <br/>\n&gt;(ever and one are the key words) <br/>\n&gt;3)Should the clients of this class be unaware of the application they <br/>\n&gt;are part of? <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;What is being assumed about the classes use when you ask these three <br/>\n&gt;questions?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t understand your question here.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen considering whether a class should be a singleton, you must ask<br/>\nyourself those three questions. If you don&#39;t answer a resounding YES to<br/>\nall three, then the class probably does not want to a be singleton, so<br/>\ndon&#39;t make it one.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Thanks again, and great article!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Thanks for the kind words. Even 18 months later, people are getting<br/>\nsome use out of it. I can&#39;t be upset about that. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n-----<br/>\n<br/>\nYou answered, in another e-mail, that you don&#39;t want an unsuspecting<br/>\nprogrammer to come along and use the second, public constructor by<br/>\nmistake. This is the biggest problem with global data: it has no<br/>\napplication context; therefore it&#39;s unclear that the data belongs to an<br/>\napplication. If data belongs to an application, then ask the<br/>\napplication for it. If there is no natural object that represents the<br/>\napplication (such as a servlet, applet or frame), then create one. In<br/>\nthis case, the Application class would play the role of &quot;toolbox&quot; as I<br/>\nwrote in my article. Now there&#39;s no doubt that it&#39;s the Application&#39;s<br/>\ninstance of the ConfigManager that application components should use.<br/>\nIn short: &quot;if the config manager belongs to the application, then put<br/>\nit there.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHm... that sounds like a good post-script to my article. It&#39;s a shame<br/>\nthat developerWorks takes months to respond to e-mail. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJ. B.
