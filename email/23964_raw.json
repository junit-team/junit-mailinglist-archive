In your case you are defi=\r\nning as well as using the behavior in the same class.  This is a perspectiv=\r\ne issue. I always look at the fact that a single class should define and ha=\r\nndle single behavior. \n\nAs far as DataLoader annotation goes in the EasyTes=\r\nt framework, the biggest difference between what you suggest in your gist a=\r\nnd what DataProvider does is that a user is not required to use @DataProvid=\r\ner at the method level. He can simply use the annotation at the class level=\r\n and the framework will take care of the rest. A user can simply say @test =\r\non its test method and the framework will take care of the rest. As I said =\r\nbefore, the functionality of applying the DataLoader annotation at the meth=\r\nod level is for completeness purpose and not a mandatory requirement.\n\nAnd =\r\nI am not objecting to your solution of asking a user to provide a static cl=\r\nass per test method, but I am presenting my view point that I would persona=\r\nlly not be using such a Runner/behavior. But again that is just me. There c=\r\nould be a lot of people who may find this idea very interesting. But I am n=\r\not one of them unfortunately :(.\n\nCheers!\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, Ma=\r\ntthew Farwell &lt;matthew@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I really think that you don&#39;t unders=\r\ntand my use case here, I&#39;m sorry.\n&gt; \n&gt; This is my use case. I have a class =\r\nwhich contains multiple methods that I\n&gt; wish to test. Each test requires i=\r\nt&#39;s own, specific data set. I cannot use\n&gt; Parameterized because I must def=\r\nine a constructor, and I cannot have\n&gt; multiple constructors. I would like =\r\nto make my job easier by being able to\n&gt; say test this method with this dat=\r\naset.\n&gt; \n&gt; I use Parameterized a lot, and I have absolutely no problem with=\r\n defining\n&gt; the data in my class, just like it is suggested in the javadoc =\r\nfor\n&gt; Parameterized.\n&gt; \n&gt; If I could use the same data set for all of the m=\r\nethods I wished to test,\n&gt; then I could use the current implementation of P=\r\narameterized. So see my\n&gt; comments inline.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2012/8/29 Anuj &lt;anujkumar15=\r\n16@...&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; **\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; A Side note first: The gist has a comma along=\r\n with it, therefore it\n&gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t work when clicked. :)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Matthew, b=\r\neing a JUnit user for so long, personally I would repel at the\n&gt; &gt; idea of =\r\nwriting static classes that extend an interface in my test class.\n&gt; &gt; Here =\r\nare my reasons:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; You don&#39;t use Rules? These are effectively the same t=\r\nhing. You extend a\n&gt; class/interface and reimplement a method. Effectively =\r\nthe same thing here.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 1) It makes the whole process of writing te=\r\nst cases more complicated.\n&gt; &gt; Also, the writing test cases is now coupled =\r\nwith writing test data. A\n&gt; &gt; tester cannot work exclusively on writing tes=\r\nt data without concerning\n&gt; &gt; himself from the test cases. This leads to co=\r\nupling. We should allow the\n&gt; &gt; user to write test data separately from the=\r\n test case.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; I can understand what you&#39;re saying about separation of t=\r\nests & test data,\n&gt; but that&#39;s not what I want to do. I have no problem wit=\r\nh the data and tests\n&gt; being in the same physical file. In fact, I prefer t=\r\nhat because I&#39;m doing\n&gt; unit testing. In the past, I have defined my test d=\r\nata in another file, but\n&gt; that&#39;s not what I&#39;m talking about here.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2) =\r\nWe, as developers, get only a fraction of the time to write test cases,\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n and therefore the less time we have to spend on writing and executing the\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; test cases, the better.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 3) There is a problem of maintenance he=\r\nre. I personally believe that, the\n&gt; &gt; less you make a user depend on your =\r\nframework, the better it is. Junit&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; @Test is actually a classic exampl=\r\ne of how easy it is to get up and running\n&gt; &gt; without the user thinking abo=\r\nut any external dependencies. The user doesn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; have to follow a nice le=\r\narning curve and know the APIs. That&#39;s where\n&gt; &gt; annotations are so powerfu=\r\nl.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t understand what you&#39;re trying to say in either of these=\r\n points.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;  4) In your above gist as well(just like the previous on=\r\ne), a user has to\n&gt; &gt; provide annotation at the method level, which, as I p=\r\nointed out before, can\n&gt; &gt; and ideally should be avoided. The user should b=\r\ne able to say(in terms of\n&gt; &gt; writing test cases) something like : &quot;Here is=\r\n my test data which contains\n&gt; &gt; data for each test method I have in my tes=\r\nt class. Now run all the methods\n&gt; &gt; that are Tests and pass the right para=\r\nmeters to them.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; Like I say above, if I could define something at cla=\r\nss level, then I\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t need to add this functionality to JUnit. Also, =\r\nin your easytest\n&gt; framework, you have annotation which applies at method l=\r\nevel, so I don&#39;t\n&gt; what you&#39;re objecting to.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Well, that&#39;s where =\r\natleast my money lies and that&#39;s what I have tried to\n&gt; &gt; capture in EasyTe=\r\nst.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Again, it is a philosophical discussion which can have a lot of=\r\n rights and\n&gt; &gt; wrongs. Whenever I design any software, my philosophy alway=\r\ns is: &quot;Think\n&gt; &gt; about what the users would be required to learn/code about=\r\n my software, in\n&gt; &gt; order to get up and running with my system.&quot; The less =\r\nthe user needs to\n&gt; &gt; learn and depend on an external system, the better an=\r\nd faster the\n&gt; &gt; development. Obviously, there are situations where certain=\r\n things cannot be\n&gt; &gt; avoided, and then we make informed decisions. :)\n&gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Cheers!\n&gt; &gt; Anuj\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In junit@yahoogroups.com, Matthew Farw=\r\nell &lt;matthew@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; One thing that you can&#39;t do is stack runn=\r\ners, so you can&#39;t use Enclosed\n&gt; &gt; in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; conjunction with other runners.=\r\n I&#39;m sure there was an issue to allow\n&gt; &gt; &gt; multiple runners for a test cla=\r\nss, but I can&#39;t find it now.

If a=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; user wants to do two different things, but have them accessible in=\r\n the\n&gt; &gt; file\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; system in one place, the Enclosed runner is always av=\r\nailable:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; @RunWith(Enclosed.class)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; public class FooT=\r\nest {\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; public static class Thing1 { ... }\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; public static clas=\r\ns Thing2 { ... }\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; }\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; IMHO, classes are how Java group=\r\ns methods and data that belong\n&gt; &gt; together.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m reluctant to intro=\r\nduce new ways of grouping (such as annotations on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; methods that cont=\r\nain the names of other methods) if equivalent\n&gt; &gt; class-based\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; techn=\r\niques will work.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; David Saff\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; On Tue,=\r\n Aug 28, 2012 at 10:23 AM, Anuj &lt;anujkumar1516@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *=\r\n*\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Het Matthew,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I think my=\r\n previous mail got lost as I cannot see it being delivered\n&gt; &gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n the group even after 3 hours.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So here is my response once again:=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1) Parameterized runner does not work in a way that I =\r\nwas talking\n&gt; &gt; about\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; DataLoader below. It has the drawback that =\r\nif you provide a single\n&gt; &gt; set of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; test data for multiple methods=\r\n, it will pass all the test data to\n&gt; &gt; all the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; methods. Have a l=\r\nook at this blog post for more clarification of the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Parameterized=\r\n Runner and its drawback:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; http://www.kumaranuj.com/20=\r\n12/08/junits-parameterized-runner-and-data.html\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2) I fe=\r\nel a new runner would be a better approach although I do not\n&gt; &gt; know\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; what all feature set will this runner support.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3) =\r\nI feel it is easier and also simpler if we get rid of the whole\n&gt; &gt; idea\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; providing method names. I say this because in real world=\r\n scenario,\n&gt; &gt; no two\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; test methods will have exactly the same set=\r\n of test data. Thus the\n&gt; &gt; name\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the method should suf=\r\nfice instead of asking the user to explicitly\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; specify\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the=\r\n method name in the annotation. But thats just my approach.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; I feel this requires more input from the community.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Cheers!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Anuj\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In junit@yahoogr=\r\noups.com, Matthew Farwell &lt;matthew@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sorry f=\r\nor any misunderstanding, I agree that there are parts which\n&gt; &gt; need\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be clarified.

I was caught up in a lot of other stuff.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n I saw the proposal for @DataProvider and it looks a good start,\n&gt; &gt; but\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; IMHO\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it might not turn out to be a great one. Here ar=\r\ne some reasons\n&gt; &gt; why I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; feel\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; such apprehension:\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1)The annotation currently is applied per method,=\r\n which means\n&gt; &gt; that if\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there is a single class providing th=\r\ne input test data for 10 test\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; methods,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the user has=\r\n to apply the annotation over each test method. This\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; seems\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; undesirable as it promotes duplicacy within the test class.\n&gt; &gt; Moreo=\r\nver,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; running each test method would mean extra processing, wh=\r\nich can\n&gt; &gt; be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; avoided\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; by making the annotation sup=\r\nport ElementType.TYPE as well.

My\n&gt; &gt; point\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that I wish t=\r\no have two methods which have separate sets of data,\n&gt; &gt; so\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the=\r\nrefore I have to specify the DataProvider multiple times.\n&gt; &gt; Unless of\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; course, you&#39;re suggesting that if we specify @DataProvider at clas=\r\ns\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; level,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it has the same effect as the current Parame=\r\nterized? I wouldn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; object\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2)It is not clear from the discussion which JUnit Ru=\r\nnner will\n&gt; &gt; support\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; annotation: Parameterize=\r\nd or Theories or there would be a new\n&gt; &gt; Runner.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n I was planning to modify Parameterized, but a new runner would be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; acceptable.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3)It would be nice =\r\nif we give some sense of direction to the user\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; regarding the =\r\nstructure of DataProviderClass and the method it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; supports.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So, something like :\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Class&lt;? extends Pr=\r\novider&gt; dataProviderClass() default\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; EmptyProvider.class;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Again, forcing people to use an interface for the exter=\r\nnal\n&gt; &gt; classes\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; my\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; first thought. However=\r\n, since we&#39;re specifying the name of the\n&gt; &gt; method\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nour DataProvider (if dataProviderClass is not specified), why not\n&gt; &gt; be\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; able\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to specify it in the dataProviderClass? The main dif=\r\nference would\n&gt; &gt; be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the method would need to be s=\r\ntatic in our class, whereas in the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dataProviderClass it could b=\r\ne non-static.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3)I somehow get the feeling(and it co=\r\nuld be simply me and if that\n&gt; &gt; is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; case, please =\r\nignore me) that the aspect of performing Data Driven\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Testing\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; should be given more time, and proper thought should be put in\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; around\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; its\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; design and the way it will be made ava=\r\nilable to the end users. I\n&gt; &gt; feel\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; we\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; should not r=\r\nush into developing a feature focusing a single use\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; case/requ=\r\nirement, rather we should try to first gather and\n&gt; &gt; understand\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nall\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the aspects of Data Driven Testing and then develop that\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; requirement\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; as a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; whole rather than in pieces.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m not rushing, that&#39;s why I&#39;m asking=\r\n the question on the junit\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mailing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; list :-) However, I =\r\nthink this is a generalization of the current\n&gt; &gt; usage\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Parameterized, and this would be useful, to me at least.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Matthew.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I would be much more beneficial to the community as a who=\r\nle.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Anuj\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In junit@yahoogroups.com, Matthew Farwell &lt;ma=\r\ntthew@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hello,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sorry this took so long to get back to you, but I was trying\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n to get\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; my\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thoughts together.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I don&#39;t believe that the suggestion below fits in with the\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n current\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; JUnit\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; philospohy, so doesn&#39;t belong in t=\r\nhe junit core library.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Specifically, I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; don&#39;t thin=\r\nk CSV/Excel/XML parsing belongs in JUnit, so I agree\n&gt; &gt; with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you=\r\nr\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; decision to write it as an extension rather than as part =\r\nof\n&gt; &gt; junit\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; core.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However, I do =\r\nbelieve that we can add stuff to JUnit core in\n&gt; &gt; order\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; allow\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; people to do this sort of thing more easily, a=\r\nnd maybe help you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; your\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; code as well.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I often have the following problem: I&#39;ve g=\r\not a class Foo in\n&gt; &gt; which\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; testing multiple me=\r\nthods (foo#addInts & foo#addStrings). So I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; create\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; single class to test the two. But if either of these methods\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; better\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tested using parameterized, then I ca=\r\nn&#39;t do it because I have\n&gt; &gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; define\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; constructor. So, what I would propose is to have a\n&gt; &gt; @DataProvide=\r\nr\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; annotation\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; which specifies a method to call=\r\n which returns a collection of\n&gt; &gt; data\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this =\r\nparticular method.

See https://gist.github.com/3471426 for a short\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; proposal.
