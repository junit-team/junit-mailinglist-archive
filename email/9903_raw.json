Can Junit be used to test getter methods which have some DB hits and some logic in it ?\n    Is it in conformance with Junit philosophy ?\n \n \nThanks in advance for your replies.\n\nThanks and Regards \nNaveen.N \n\n\n\n \n\n\n  ----------\n\nThis e-mail and any files transmitted with it are for the sole use of the intended recipient(s) and may contain confidential and privileged information.\nIf you are not the intended recipient, please contact the sender by reply e-mail and destroy all copies of the original message. \nAny unauthorised review, use, disclosure, dissemination, forwarding, printing or copying of this email or any action taken in reliance on this e-mail is strictly \nprohibited and may be unlawful.\n\n\t\tVisit us at http://www.cognizant.com\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
