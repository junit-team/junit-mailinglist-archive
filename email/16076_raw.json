I m working as a software tester for the last 7 months. Now i am in a stage, that my organisation is asking me to study how to work with junit for a project. I dont know the exact process. I have gone thru some codings shown the helping web sites. U can u just help me out in knowing the entire process of how a Junit testing can be done. And on what all kind of languages it can be done. Also just tell me whether junit supports .net applications. If its not supporting can u help me in knowing the tools which does support .net applications.\n    \n   Hope that i get a positive feedback soon\n    \n   Thanking You\n\n\n   NITIN EARNEST PALLAN\n\n\n             \n---------------------------------\nRelax.
