However, <br/>\nsometimes certain things just are coupled, like a subclass to it&#39;s <br/>\nsuperclass. The class data for the superclass should exist before <br/>\nthe subclass, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, sometimes the more loosely coupled something is, the HARDER it <br/>\nis to reset it&#39;s cached data (across all interactions). And I guess <br/>\nthis is really the problem. I want to zero out all cached data <br/>\nwithout having to know about the couplings that were created <br/>\ndynamically.<br/>\n<br/>\nR.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, Jason Rogers &lt;jacaetevha@f...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Think of it this way...

And, honestly, if you think about it, each test <br/>\n&gt; &gt; method SHOULD be atomic. Mock objects seemed kind of like a <br/>\nkludge <br/>\n&gt; &gt; for tests not being run atomically.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Thoughts?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; R. </span></blockquote></div>",
