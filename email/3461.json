You have the system up and running <br/>\nand you use their recording option to run through your use cases. <br/>\nThen using their scripting language [4Test], you modify your test <br/>\ncases etc to make test suites for regression runs.<br/>\n<br/>\nJUnit on the other hand is based on the xUnit framework by Erich Beck <br/>\nand Kent Gamma and falls into the unit testing tool category. It is <br/>\nmore dependent on the actual implementation and ties closely into the <br/>\ndevelopment cycle.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, basically, you cannot compare apples and oranges. It is possible <br/>\nto use both tools on the same project.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a personal note, I think rather highly of SilkTest&#39;s features but <br/>\nI wouldnt invest in it at the moment. There are rumours about how <br/>\nSegue software isnt doing very well recently. Their main competitor <br/>\nMercury has a comparable tool (WinRunner) which my team uses.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps...<br/>\n-Suresh<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In junit@y..., &quot;Stevens, Timothy J.
