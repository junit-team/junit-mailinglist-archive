I created a new\nsubject to discuss this. It is a bit off topic but I care too much\nabout the subject to let it go :)  (sorry)\n\nI also want to point out that eventhough Cederic is quoted here I have\nno reason to beleive so far that we are somehow in oposition. It was\nmerely the queue that made me want to ask some questions to the list.\nSo here goes:\n\n\nCederic Wrote\n&gt;\n&gt;  Of course, it&#39;s very important to give low-level functions to achieve that\n&gt;  goal, but the fact that more than ten years after its inception, Java still\n&gt;  doesn&#39;t have a File#readEntireFile is absolutely baffling.  I must have\n&gt;  written this function dozens of times myself.\n\nWhat would a generic readEntireFile return? Should there be a\nreadEntireFileAsByte, readEntireFileAsChar, readEntireFileAsLines.\n\nI must admit that I have never created a readEntireFileMethod. I\nusually want to do something with the contents and then I usually end\nup with some kind of parseStream/parseWriter thingy. Why would I read\na file into memory and transform it form there when I can transform it\nwhile reading it?\n\nI have clearly have issues with files and I must admit that I always\nfind it a bit annoying when I see methods taking a file but not an\nequivalent taking a Stream. I think that the Stream API is much\nunderused by too many Java programmers and that most of the time I see\n&quot;File&quot; in code it should read &quot;Stream&quot;. Some argue that Streams are\ntoo complicated. I don&#39;t understand that really,  I think that it is\neasier to use streams/readers/writers than files since they are more\ngeneric and your toolbox becomes so much wider with hardly any effort\nat all.\n\nI am probably to constrained in my thinking here and that is why I\ncan&#39;t see a generic readEntireFile that I miss... I have to think\nharder, there is probably a whole world out there that I have not\nexplored :).\n\nWhat do people on the list prefer? Working with Files or\nStreams/Readers/Writers? For what reasons?\nPlease share your thoughts.\n\n/Joakim Ohlrogge\n\n",
