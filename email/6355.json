Admittedly, <br/>\nthis chapter was borne out of my own worst performance fears coming true <br/>\nover the years.  I&#39;ve rolled the dice with premature optimizations. The <br/>\nhouse won. I&#39;ve cast scalability to the wind hoping that by some miracle <br/>\nthe whiz-bang technology would scale. It didn&#39;t. I&#39;ve thrash-tuned until <br/>\nthere were no more levers to pull, then I did it again. Alas, I never <br/>\ncaught my tail. And yes, despite my crusade for automation, I&#39;ve spent <br/>\nway too much time manually running performance tests. I often think of <br/>\nwhat I could have done with that time. Perhaps this chapter will spare <br/>\nsome folks from those battle scars.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can download these chapters at no cost, though it does require that <br/>\nyou create an account on TSS.  In return, we would very much appreciate <br/>\nyour feedback. By all means, please make any corrections, propose <br/>\nenhancements, or tell us about EJB antipatterns that we may have missed.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance, and enjoy!<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;/shameless plug&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMike<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nMike Clark<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clarkware.com\">http://clarkware.com</a> <br/>\n(720) 851-2014</div>",
