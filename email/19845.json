I haven&#39;t made up<br/>\nmy mind why,<br/>\nmaybe I&#39;m just envious of the cool Ruby stuff and want to squeese it in just<br/>\nbecause I can or there is<br/>\nsome better reason why I&#39;m interested.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe hole I tried to fill is when you have a mixed environment of JRuby and<br/>\nJava and<br/>\nyou want your feedback in one place. The solution should work for idea and<br/>\nnetbeans aswell<br/>\nso it&#39;s not just for eclipse (just wanted to emphasize that in case someone<br/>\nmissed it)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I had that done I just started thinking &quot;hey, why not test-drive<br/>\njava-code as well&quot;<br/>\nand that&#39;s about as far as I have come in that line of thoughts.<br/>\nWhat is your experience with testing java-code from RSpec? (you seem to have<br/>\nthought<br/>\nsome more about it than me)<br/>\n<br/>\nI can see that some problems can emerge like the one you had with the<br/>\nexception-class thingy...<br/>\nIs it possible to just raise a Java exception (without rspec). In that case<br/>\nI guess you could work around<br/>\nthe problem by specifying your own action for throwing java-exceptions. If<br/>\nthe problem lies deeper<br/>\nwithing JRuby so that you can&#39;t even raise Java exceptions it becomes more<br/>\ndifficult :)<br/>\n<br/>\n/J<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 9/10/07, Per Jacobsson &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:perjacobsson@...\">perjacobsson@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   I like the idea of testing Java classes with rspec and have been playing<br/>\n&gt; around with it myself.

I believe that mixing languages<br/>\n&gt; rather than switching completely from one language to another is going<br/>\n&gt; to be more and more important. As I explored the subject i found<br/>\n&gt; myself lacking some tools. I was frustrated by the fact that I had to<br/>\n&gt; maintain two sets of tests and look for feedback in two different<br/>\n&gt; locations while developing.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I created a custom runner for JUnit to address the subject and I think<br/>\n&gt; it looks promising. I created a blog entry with some more details in<br/>\n&gt; case anyone is interested:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://johlrogge.wordpress.com/2007/09/08/hybrid-theory/\">http://johlrogge.wordpress.com/2007/09/08/hybrid-theory/</a><br/>\n&gt; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://johlrogge.wordpress.com/2007/09/08/hybrid-theory/\">http://johlrogge.wordpress.com/2007/09/08/hybrid-theory/</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have some loose plans on open-sourcing this but I would like to see<br/>\n&gt; if there are others than me that find this interesting enough to be<br/>\n&gt; worth the effort before I do.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; /Joakim Ohlrogge<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>",
