It took awhile, but I finally figured out how\nto use Junit for my purposes.\n\nI have some objects that are needed througout all of my tests, and I had to\nmake them static and initialize them in my &quot;main&quot; method when starting the\ntest.  Then, all tests are able to refer to those singletons.  It seems that\nbefore and after each test, the setup and tear down methods are called, and\nalso, class instance variables seem to be re-initialized with each test.  I\nsolved this by using the static singletons, after alot experimentation and\nconfusion.  So I am not able to test objects on a component basis in my\nsuite, because the system is dependent on many other objects.\nUnfortunately, I cannot instantiate an object completely by itself because\nof these dependencies.\n\nFor the Swing UI junit properties, I was able to specify the &quot;-noloading&quot;\narugument when starting the swingui to use the system classloader.\n\nPaul Antinori\n\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &quot;Shane Celis&quot; &lt;shane@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;junit@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Wednesday, March 20, 2002 6:30 PM\nSubject: Re: [junit] help - test abort and properties file\n\n\n&gt; To make JUnit fail whenever an error is detected, I would actually\n&gt; recommend changing/extending the behavior of TestResult, which must be\n&gt; plugged into the particular test runner that you&#39;re using.\n&gt;\n&gt; // textui/MyTestRunner.java\n&gt; protected TestResult createTestResult() {\n&gt; return new TestResult() {\n&gt; public synchronized void addFailure(Test test,\n&gt; AssertionFailedError t) {\n&gt; super.addFailure(test, t);\n&gt; stop();\n&gt; }\n&gt; };\n&gt; }\n&gt;\n&gt; It seems like a lot of people shy away from making these sorts of\n&gt; modifications, but I want encourage anyone who&#39;s using, or considering\n&gt; using, JUnit that the code base is intentionally small and easy to\n&gt; digest so that customizing it&#39;s behavior does not require a herculean\n&gt; effort.\n&gt;\n&gt; -shane\n&gt;\n&gt; On Wednesday, March 20, 2002, at 12:18  PM, Vladimir Bossicard wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Is there a way to have the test suite\n&gt; &gt;&gt; abort if one of the tests fails.  in other words, if the first test in\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; list fails, then the remaining tests are not executed. In my suite()\n&gt; &gt;&gt; method\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I list the specific tests I want to run, rather than just returning a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; new\n&gt; &gt;&gt; TestSuite with the testcase class specified.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If your tests are dependant from each other, you may reconsider refactor\n&gt; &gt; them so that they can be execution in any order.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; As for JUnit, unless you modify the runners, I don&#39;t think you can\n&gt; &gt; parametrize JUnit to do what you want.  If you use Ant, you have the\n&gt; &gt; &quot;haltonfailure&quot; option of the JUnit task but you have to check if it&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; really what you want.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; general note: if you don&#39;t specify a suite() method, JUnit will\n&gt; &gt; automatically extract all your test methods from your class.  So you\n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t need to write\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;     public static Test suite() {\n&gt; &gt;        return new TestSuite(myClass.class);\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;    }\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Also, I am having trouble with the Swing UI tester.  It created a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; junit.properties file to set the &quot;loading&quot; property to false, but it\n&gt; &gt;&gt; does\n&gt; &gt;&gt; not find my property file.  I specified the USER.HOME env variable as\n&gt; &gt;&gt; well\n&gt; &gt;&gt; as putting the file in my classpath.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The best way to figure out where JUnit looks for junit.properties file\n&gt; &gt; is to search the file on your hard drive.  JUnit searches for the\n&gt; &gt; &quot;user.home&quot; variable and not &quot;USER.HOME&quot;, maybe it&#39;s the problem.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; -Vladimir\n&gt; &gt; --\n&gt; &gt; Vladimir Bossicard\n&gt; &gt; www.bossicard.com\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; &gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
