In teams of dozens of\n&gt;programmers of various age and seniority levels scattered over\n&gt;multiple time zones, mentoring and diagrams only go so far.  The only\n&gt;way to guarantee that things don&#39;t break is to leverage your\n&gt;programming language to make sure that any infraction will simply not\n&gt;compile.\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; If the class names don&#39;t express the idea that there should only be\n&gt;&gt; one of a class in the production code then a tech huddle to agree on a\n&gt;&gt; system of names and a refactoring session can help.\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Maybe for very tiny open source projects, but certainly not in\n&gt;general, in my experience...\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nAll situations are different. I think we forget sometimes that we use \nwhat&#39;s possible in a language and conveniently ignore what isn&#39;t \npossible. A great example in Java is the lack of something like C++&#39;s \nconst member functions. If Java had them, it would be great. But they \naren&#39;t there, and, in general, we don&#39;t feel any less diligent because \nwe can&#39;t use them. A more severe example is the way that protection is \nhandled in dynamic languages. In most of them, anyone at any time can \nsubvert something that is acting like a singleton. The convention is the \nprotection, not the language.\n\nI guess we could say that the measure of our effectiveness is how \ndiligent we are with what we have, and that we would be irresponsible if \nwe use anything less than all of the mechanisms that languages offer us \nto protect us from ourselves, but really I think we have more choices \nthan that.\n\nMichael Feathers\nwww.objectmentor.com\n\n\n",
