I&#39;m not sure about this but I think I have seen posts<br/>\nabout that issue on this list. Dig in the archives to see what you come up<br/>\nwith or simply test with ant 1.7 whichever goes faster.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope this helps<br/>\n/Joakim Ohlrogge<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 10/25/06, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mmikedm1000@...\">mmikedm1000@...</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mmikedm1000@...\">mmikedm1000@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    Hi,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My question pertains to using the annotation based unit tests and test<br/>\n&gt; suites with Anthill.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am using Eclipse 3.2, Java 1.5, Junit 4.1, Ant 1.6.5, and Anthill.<br/>\n&gt; Currently I have many junit tests and test suites written in the Junit 3.8.<br/>\n&gt; These run fine in all environments. What I would like to do is use the Junit<br/>\n&gt; 4.1 annotation based testing and test suites. I have created several test<br/>\n&gt; classes and a test suite to run the test classes. Eclipse will run the<br/>\n&gt; annotation based Junit 4.1 test suite without error. When I try to run the<br/>\n&gt; new test suite on Anthill, they tests run correctly but the test names all<br/>\n&gt; appear as &#39;Unknown&#39;. I am at a loss to why.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have search Junit&#39;s and Anthill&#39;s documentation to no avail. Also I have<br/>\n&gt; initiated numerous searches on goggle, but I have not found anyone with a<br/>\n&gt; similar problem.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Does anyone have any suggestions?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks, -Michael-<br/>\n&gt; __________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Check out the new AOL.
