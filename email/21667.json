It does get deep, and<br/>\nin some cases, compiler-dependent, if I remember correctly.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, we did find that in some cases, the signature of the<br/>\n_Matcher_ could be improved.  What&#39;s the signature of hasEntry?<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is also pushing me to keep on my &quot;Dotmesh&quot; project, which would allow this:<br/>\n<br/>\nassertThat(result.entrySet()).contains(entry(&quot;Key&quot;, Date.class));<br/>\n<br/>\n[if the &quot;entry&quot; factory convenience method were written]<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\n   David Saff</div>",
