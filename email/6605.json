    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1208139825\">In our programmer integration tests that actually hit an external db, <br/>\nwe just made the tearDown implementation never fail.  <br/>\n<br/>\ntearDown() is called after each test, so in the event say we needed to <br/>\ndelete records that were added, if they didn&#39;t exist in the db due to the <br/>\ntest failing, tearDown() would go ahead and attempt to delete them, but <br/>\nnot fail if they didn&#39;t exist.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow often times when getting a failing test to fail, we&#39;ll leave the <br/>\ntearDown() implementation commented out for a while to get the code <br/>\nwritten to pass the test.  Then once the test is passing put the <br/>\ntearDown() implementation back in and leave it.  We&#39;ve done this alot with <br/>\ntests that do a binary diff on golden data, like a pdf report.<br/>\n<br/>\nRun the test with tearDown() commented out.<br/>\nVisually inspect the generated report once, if good save as our golden <br/>\ndata.<br/>\nTurn on tearDown() and have the test diff against the golden data.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps a bit...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Fri, 3 Jan 2003, Brian &lt;br524@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; No, you have a good point.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The problem is that my test writes to the database, then I call the<br/>\n&gt; method that I&#39;m unit testing which performs several database functions<br/>\n&gt; within a transaction, then I read from the database again to test the<br/>\n&gt; values.  The test could fail at any one of these three points.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Your suggestion of cleaning up code though made me look at the<br/>\n&gt; transactional method I was testing though...it turns out I was missing<br/>\n&gt; a rollback() call, so thanks!  But that still doesn&#39;t solve the<br/>\n&gt; problem I have with three points of failure within my test.  If you<br/>\n&gt; have any ideas as to how to get around this, I&#39;m all ears.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -Brian<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Jason Rogers&quot; &lt;jacaetevha@f...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Could you not use the opportunity to clean up your code such that<br/>\n&gt; you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t need to visually inspect the DB?
