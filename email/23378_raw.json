On other projects, I&#39;ve tried to\ndo the opposite, having the classes I=\r\n intend to be stable and\npublished in packages that contain the name &quot;api&quot;,=\r\n leaving all others\n&quot;use at your own risk&quot;.  Google encourages a @VisibleFo=\r\nrTesting tag,\nalthough I prefer to have designs and viewabilities that make=\r\n sense as\noutgrowths of a particular design philosophy without considering\n=\r\ntesting specifically.\n\nI believe that while it&#39;s important to allow clients=\r\n that want the\nsafest experience to easily find ways of doing so, it&#39;s also=\r\n possible\nto make life too hard for clients who want to move forward at the=\r\nir\nown risk.  (for example,\nhttp://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2011/01/apple=\r\n-screwing-new-iphones-out-of-simple-diy-repair.ars)\n\nI&#39;m sure others have i=\r\nnteresting takes on this as well,\n\n   David\n\nOn Sun, Apr 3, 2011 at 4:24 PM=\r\n, Lance Zant &lt;lance.zant@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Ok, I think I finally get that=\r\n the argument against testing private methods is a preference to push them =\r\ndown into finer grained classes where they are appropriately &quot;public&quot;. =A0I=\r\n put &quot;public&quot; in quotes because so far we have considered only the inward p=\r\nerspective, looking &quot;in&quot; toward their declarations. =A0Next, looking outwar=\r\nd, I&#39;d like to hear how one prevents them from creeping into the public int=\r\nerface of the system as a whole, which was presumably the point of their be=\r\ning private in the first place.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Lance\n&gt;\n&gt; Sent from my iPhone=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
