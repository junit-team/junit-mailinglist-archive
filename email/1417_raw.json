Both worked fine, so use which ever you like.\n\nMy preference is to put the test in the same directory as the class.  \nI like this because it reduces the number of clicks I have to make in \nmy IDE (JBuilder) to get from production class to test class.  When \nyou are developing in a test-first fashion, you will frequently \nswitch between the test code and the production code.  By putting \nthem in the same directory this makes it easier to navigate in the \nIDE.  Yes, this mixes production and test files together.  However it \nis very easy to seperate them in a build script (if you use a simple \nnaming convention for test files).  Since you will spend more of your \nwork day navigating between source files than seperating out test \ncode, I chose to optimize the # of clicks I had to make in the IDE by \nputting files in the same directory.\n\nI use the following naming convention:\n  Someclass.java\n  SomeclassT.java // the unit test\n  SomeclassM.java // a mock object of Someclass\n\n- Greg\n\n\n\n",
