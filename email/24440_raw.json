It finally turned out not to be a good idea, as there are t=\r\no many implications that require modifications on the BlockJUnit4ClassRunne=\r\nr and might break dependencies and, therefore, I decided to create this run=\r\nner from scratch (whereas, &quot;from scratch&quot; here means that I copied the Bloc=\r\nkJUnit4ClassRunner and its parent class into one class and applied a lot of=\r\n refactoring until I was able to easily include the context behavior, while=\r\n I constantly compared the results of the hierarchical context runner with =\r\nthe results of the BlockJUnit4ClassRunner on the test suite of FitNesse).\n\n=\r\nThe hierarchical context runner is able to process @BeforeClass and @AfterC=\r\nlass methods, as well as @Rule and @Before/@After statements along the whol=\r\ne context hierarchy. Let&#39;s shortly talk about them each at a time:\n\n@Before=\r\nClass / @AfterClass: Those are supported for the top level class and as the=\r\ny are static, you cannot have them within non-static member classes. My run=\r\nner requires all contexts to be non-static and, therefore, only the top lev=\r\nel class will contain those annotations. Methods annotated with these are e=\r\nxecuted right before / after the whole test hierarchy, i.e. all tests withi=\r\nn the hierarchy run between the @BeforeClass and @AfterClass methods.\n\n@Rul=\r\ne: All rules are evaluated along the whole context path. It doesn&#39;t matter =\r\nwhere you specify the rule, as long as it is visible from the current test,=\r\n it will be available and evaluated.\n\n@Before / @After: Same as for @Rule. =\r\nFor each test all @Before and @After methods are run, if they are part of t=\r\nhe context path (class, superclass, super-superclass,=85) of the current te=\r\nst.\n\nI didn&#39;t spend much time to think about having a @RunWith on inner cla=\r\nsses because I think this would more or less be better placed into another =\r\ntest class. I mean, if I choose a new runner for the inner class that &quot;most=\r\n probably&quot; will not handle the hierarchy, why won&#39;t I simple put this inner=\r\n class in a separate file? That&#39;s just a first guess=85\n\nI am really lookin=\r\ng forward to seeing your feedback, espc. as you have also investigated a lo=\r\nt of time in writing such a runner. :-)\n\nAll the best\n\nBechte\n\n\nAm 01.11.20=\r\n13 um 07:04 schrieb Aaron VonderHaar &lt;gruen0aermel@...&gt;:\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Nice w=\r\nork!\n&gt; \n&gt; I did what appears to be the same thing a few months ago: https:/=\r\n/github.com/avh4/junit-nested\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ll have to look at your code a bit mor=\r\ne, but it looks like you wrote a new runner from scratch and re-implemented=\r\n all the behaviors of BlockJUnit4ClassRunner?

The runner aims on test hierarchies, i.e.=\r\n tests that can be grouped into contexts for better readability. You can co=\r\nmpare this with the contexts in rspec and I would say it is an enhancement =\r\nof the Enclosed Runner.\n&gt; \n&gt; Let&#39;s start with an example:\n&gt; \n&gt; @RunWith(Hie=\r\nrarchicalContextRunner.class)\n&gt; public class BankAccountTest {\n&gt; private Ac=\r\ncount account;\n&gt; \n&gt; public class SavingsAccountContext {\n&gt; @Before\n&gt; public=\r\n void setup() {\n&gt; myAccount =3D new SavingsAccount();\n&gt; }\n&gt; \n&gt; @Test\n&gt; publ=\r\nic void accountWithBalanceOf100_earns3InInterest() throws Exception {\n&gt; myA=\r\nccount.setBalance(100.0);\n&gt; assertThat(myAccount.getInterestEarned(), is(cl=\r\noseTo(3.0, 0.001)));\n&gt; }\n&gt; \n&gt; @Test\n&gt; public void accountWithBalanceOf200_e=\r\narns6InInterest() throws Exception {\n&gt; myAccount.setBalance(200.0);\n&gt; asser=\r\ntThat(myAccount.getInterestEarned(), is(closeTo(6.0, 0.001)));\n&gt; }\n&gt; }\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n public class MoneyMarketAccountContext {\n&gt; @Before\n&gt; public void setup() {=\r\n\n&gt; myAccount =3D new MoneyMarketAccount();\n&gt; }\n&gt; \n&gt; @Test\n&gt; public void acc=\r\nountWithBalanceOf100_earns4InInterest() throws Exception {\n&gt; myAccount.setB=\r\nalance(100.0);\n&gt; assertThat(myAccount.getInterestEarned(), is(closeTo(4.0, =\r\n0.001)));\n&gt; }\n&gt; \n&gt; @Test\n&gt; public void accountWithBalanceOf200_earns8InInte=\r\nrest() throws Exception {\n&gt; myAccount.setBalance(200.0);\n&gt; assertThat(myAcc=\r\nount.getInterestEarned(), is(closeTo(8.0, 0.001)));\n&gt; }\n&gt; }\n&gt; }\n&gt; \n&gt; (This =\r\nexample is copied from the newest video of Robert Martin from his website h=\r\nttp://www.cleancoders.com, video 22 - Test Process, starting at 00:32:38)\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; Key points to note:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. There are no static classes that contain te=\r\nsts.\n&gt; 2. There are no extends statements, hierarchies are created by creat=\r\ning inner classes (nice syntax).\n&gt; 3. Each context can access all variables=\r\n of the parent context.\n&gt; 4. @Rule, @Before and @After annotations are run =\r\nfor the complete hierarchy of a test (not visible from the example)\n&gt; 5. Mo=\r\nstly all features of the BlockJUnit4ClassRunner are also supported.\n&gt; \n&gt; An=\r\nother example can be found on my github.org page at https://github.com/bech=\r\nte/junit-hierarchicalcontextrunner/wiki.\n&gt; \n&gt; For me, this runner closes a =\r\ngap of missing ability of the JUnit framework to support hierarchies.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nI am really looking forward to getting some feedback on this runner.\n&gt; \n&gt; A=\r\nll the best\n&gt; \n&gt; Bechte\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; \n&gt; Stefan Bechtold\n&gt; \n&gt; eCard: http://ec=\r\nard.bechte.de/\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.bechte.de, http://twitter.com/bechte \n&gt; \n&gt; [=\r\nNon-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; --=\r\nAaron V.\n&gt; [ http://github.com/avh4 ]\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this m=\r\nessage have been removed]\n\n\n",
