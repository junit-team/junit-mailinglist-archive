Of course, Java makes 100%\nreliability impossible, but it would seem that examining the classpath could\nallow some magic to be worked.  It would also seem the kind of problem that\nsomeone out there may have already solved.  Anyone have a pointer?

I&#39;d like to create a junit ant task that\n&gt; &gt; just runs on my whole codebase, but not all of my classes will have\n&gt; &gt; test methods and I&#39;ll get an error for each class that doesn&#39;t (and I\n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t want to have to explictily add each class to my build.xml file\n&gt; &gt; when I add a test).\n&gt;\n&gt; If I were to try to tackle this, I&#39;d be looking at how the ANT JUnit\n&gt; runner is structured.\n&gt;\n&gt; Very approximately, it is like this:\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;junit&gt;\n&gt;   &lt;test&gt;\n&gt;     &lt;fileset /&gt;\n&gt;   &lt;/test&gt;\n&gt; &lt;/junit&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; The &lt;junit&gt; task runs all the tests handed to it by one or more &lt;test&gt;\n&gt; elements. The &lt;test&gt; elements get their input from one or more nested\n&gt; &lt;filesets&gt;.\n&gt;\n&gt; So rather than having JUnit /not/ filter out the non-tests, I&#39;d have\n&gt; that logic in either a custom subclass of &lt;test&gt; or a custom &lt;fileset&gt;\n&gt; - or maybe even a customer selector within the fileset.\n&gt;\n&gt; Even if you don&#39;t sprinkle tests throughout your fileset, it&#39;s kinda\n&gt; lame that you have to select tests by doing pattern matching on a\n&gt; .class or .java filename. It&#39;s also error-prone as I have found out\n&gt; way too many times.\n&gt;\n&gt; I have often wanted to do something similar myself but have never\n&gt; gotten around to it. Let us know how it goes.\n&gt;\n&gt; Kevin\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo! Groups Links\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
