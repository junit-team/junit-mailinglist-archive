Are you <br/>\n </span></blockquote>familiar w/ them?<br/>\nMy understanding of mock-objects is those are the scale-down version of the <br/>\nactual object with similar behaviours.  For example, it requires a lot more <br/>\nworks (setting up, tearing down, etc) to test a class that accesses a <br/>\nfull-scale relational database, but if a mock object of the database (may be <br/>\na 2-dimension String array) is used, as long as the object&#39;s methods behaves <br/>\nlike the database&#39;s, writing test case for it becomes much simpler.  Am I any <br/>\nclose?  I don&#39;t see how can I &#39;mock&#39; a crashed client though.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again for your response.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards,<br/>\n<br/>\nSam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
