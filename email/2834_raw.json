Thing is, that I\ndidn&#39;t find their arguments compelling and they basically brushed off the\nalternatives that were presented to them. We have a particularly\nfunctional assertion package that doesn&#39;t require a keyword, and although:\n\nAssert.assertion(y &lt; 0);\n\nis a little more verbose than:\n\nassert: y &lt; 0;\n\nWhen you look at the additional flexibility and code clarity of a class:\n\nAssert.notNull(foo);\nAssert.checkParam(y &lt; 0); (throws an IllegalArgumentException)\nAssert.checkState(state, OPEN); (throws an InvalidStateException)\n\nthe JDK 1.4 approach loses out. The arguments that they needed it to\nbe a keyword so that they could produce better diagnostics also doesn&#39;t\nfloat. They could have created a special class with some additional\ncompiler Magic, just like String, Class, Thread, and so forth,\nwithout adding a new keyword, let alone a new syntactic production. I\nthink that if they had bothered to explore options they could have found\na viable one. Our package is just one of a large number that found a way\nto support assertions without changing the language.\n\nIn any case, the damage is done, so there is probably no point in\ncontinuing to argue. I do appreciate the addition of the feature; I just\nthink that they were a little heavy handed with the implementation of what\nshould have been a minor change. It makes me wonder how much they will\nbreak with the new generics support that&#39;s in the works.\n\nYour sed suggestion is a good one. I&#39;ve started hacking out a Perl script.\nOne problem I have is comming up with a logical package name to replace\n&quot;com.qlue.util.assert&quot;. I suppose I could use &quot;assertions&quot; as it will only\nbe in the imports statement and the length doesn&#39;t matter much.\n\nOn Wed, 3 Oct 2001, S. J.

It&#39;s worse for use, since we have\n&gt; &gt; a support package named &quot;assert&quot; which all of our packages depend on, so\n&gt; &gt; we can&#39;t just deprecate a single method.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; It always amazes me when folks go through the trouble to create a nice,\n&gt; &gt; object oriented language with hierarchical namespaces and can&#39;t figure\n&gt; &gt; out how to add a feature without modifying the syntax.\n&gt; &gt; &lt;/rant&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; OK, I feel a little better.\n&gt;\n&gt; Um, find, grep, and sed are your friends.\n&gt;\n&gt; Something like (on a fresh copy of your source tree(s) in case it breaks):\n&gt;\n&gt; find $directory -name &#39;*.java&#39; -exec fgrep -l &#39;&#92;.assert&#92;.&#39; {} &#92;; &gt; targets\n&gt; foreach i ( cat targets )\n&gt;    mv $i ${i}.save\n&gt;    sed -e &#39;s/&#92;.assert&#92;./.Assert./&#39; &lt; ${i}.save &gt; $i\n&gt; end\n&gt;\n&gt; ....should take care of much of the work, no?  YMMV, of course.\n&gt;\n&gt; The folks at Sun made a good case (at JavaOne 2001) for why it needs to\n&gt; be a keyword. And &quot;assert&quot; is the most useful keyword to use -- in the\n&gt; long run, it&#39;s better to bite the bullet and deal with an improved\n&gt; language rather than letting random developers contort the language\n&gt; into something convenient for them but less clear for everyone else.\n&gt; After all, 1.3.x will be around for some time yet.\n&gt;\n&gt; 1.4 is in beta at the moment, so you still have time to devise a new\n&gt; packaging scheme, deprecate the old one, and convince everyone who uses\n&gt; your stuff to change.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n-- \nEric Vought\nChief Technical Officer - QLUE Consulting, Inc.\n\nevought@... toll-free: 888-771-3538  RTP area: 919-816-9901\n\n\n",
