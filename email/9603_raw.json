There is no &#39;zero&#39; in temperature so it is \nnot \n&gt; &gt; correct to say it is going to be twice as cold tomorrow. And yes, \nI \n&gt; &gt; know there is &#39;absolute&#39; zero but ask any statistician and he \nwill \n&gt; &gt; tell you that using ratios with our normal temperature scales is \n&gt; &gt; simply wrong.  Using ratios with time works if you are using \ntimed \n&gt; &gt; tests and define &#39;zero&#39; as no time.  Then yes, 5 minutes is twice \nas \n&gt; &gt; slow as 10 minutes.  Before benchmarking make sure you have a \nratio \n&gt; &gt; level variable if you want to express your results in ratios.  \nThen \n&gt; &gt; you must define the zero point otherwise your ratios are \n&gt; &gt; meaningless.  \n&gt; \n&gt; I was only half as slow reading this as you were writing it, but my \nbrain\n&gt; got twice as hot ...\n&gt; \n\nWell I figured this thread hasn&#39;t talked about JUnit in a while, so \nwhy not throw some stats in there to mix things up a bit... \n\n\n",
