Actually let me qualify that. It is not a good book unless<br/>\n&gt; you are heavily into EJB. It angles itself towards EJB using<br/>\n&gt; several different tools; however in each case you just get started<br/>\n&gt; and it jumps topics. So in that sense it is an intro book - just a<br/>\n&gt; bit too much intro and not enough meat (using the word mastering is<br/>\n&gt; just a cruel joke). <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; A more correct title would have been &quot;EJB using XP and Open Source<br/>\n&gt; Tools&quot;. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; A very disappointing book.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Just wanted to make clear that you seem to be talking about &quot;Java Tools<br/>\nfor Extreme Programming&quot; here, not about the book in the subject?!<br/>\n<br/>\nIlja</div>",
