As I stated in my message to you dated 20\nMarch 08, we are finishing up the 4.5 release and so are not focusing on new\nfeatures.\n \nJUnit has a long history of slow evolution and I expect that to continue. I\nconsider it a compliment when people can make JUnit much more usable with\nminor modifications. If everyone has to make the same modifications, that&#39;s\ndefinitely a problem, or if everyone has to modify the core, but our\nphilosophy has always been to make JUnit an intersection instead of a union\nof all useful testing-related functionality.\n \nThe next steps I would suggest for you are:\n    1) Do something to accelerate the 4.5 release, like fill in missing\njavadoc.\n    2) Add automated tests to your feature requests.\n \nBeginning to contribute to an existing project is a little like going to\nsomeone else&#39;s home. If you are demanding, if you rearrange all the\nfurniture, if, in short, you act like you are the most important person in\nthe room, then you are unlikely to be welcome. If you listen carefully and\noffer to help, you have a chance of building a relationship that will help\nyou feel at home and prepare the way for a closer relationship.\n \nBest regards,\n \nKent Beck\nThree Rivers Institute\n\n  _____  \n\nFrom: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of\ntoalexsmail\nSent: Friday, March 28, 2008 12:03 PM\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: [junit] Re: How can I join developping group?\n\n\n\nIt tokes about 3 weeks since I started to figure out how can I\ncontribute to JUnit project. I eventually wrote to all administrators,\nbut I have receive no answer from them. If nobody want to discuss my\nproposition (and there is no discussion and threads that I opened), so\nat least give me write access to CVS and I will do it myself.\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups. &lt;mailto:junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt; com, Ilja Preuss\n&lt;it@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Did you take a look at http://junit.\n&lt;http://junit.sourceforge.net/#Developer&gt; sourceforge.net/#Developer ?\n&gt; \n&gt; toalexsmail wrote:\n&gt; &gt; I have some ideas of little improvements of JUnit.

Does any\n&gt; &gt; submitter can simply submit what he think is good?

What source version control system is\n&gt; &gt; used? How can I connect to it? In common, how can I do it? \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
