However, for commercial software development, is this\n still possible ?\n \n \n Although I knew JUnit and other JUnit-based open-source tools for a\n couple of years, my company and team never really enbrace it. The\n major reason is Product Managers always want to add cool features to\n the system quickly while programmers find the schedule is always too\n tight to spend any extra time to write testing. \n \n I know from the mail list and books that we can take lots of advantage\n of JUnit-based testing, I myself have no real hands-on experience on\n it. So here are my questions: \n \n * Will Junit-based testing make the project time longer or shorter ?\n Any hard statistic data ? ( Here I mean commercial project rather than\n open-source project. )\n \n * One intersting point I found is that after Junit-based testing is\n introduced, programmers tend to use IDE debugger much less than\n before.  This would save lots of time. Is that true ?\n \n * Some guys say JUnit is good for biz / util code testing. But for web\n application development, where HTML/javascript would be root cause of\n lots of bugs, Junit is not so powerful. Any comments ? \n \n * How can I convince managers and programmers that JUnit-based is\n really possible for commercial software development ? Any differnece\n from open-source projects ?\n \n \n  \n Can some Junit gurus shed some light here ?\n \n Thanks, \n - Frank\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n             \n\n        SPONSORED LINKS   \n                                                    Basic programming language                                       C programming language                                       Computer programming languages                                                                     The c programming language                                       C   programming language                                       List of programming languages                                                                 \n      \n---------------------------------\n   YAHOO!
