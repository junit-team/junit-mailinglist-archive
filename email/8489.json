I want to evaluate expressions which read my<br/>\n&gt; objects from the db to test my mappings.  If that doesnt blow up (and<br/>\n&gt; it does, a LOT, right now), I want to play around with that instance<br/>\n&gt; in an inspector, send messages to it, fix the toString(), test lazy<br/>\n&gt; instantiation of its parts, add some behavior, debug, etc, all in the<br/>\n&gt; context of a live instance. In short I want to _interact_ with the<br/>\n&gt; object.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If I get you right, you use JUnit (or tests written for JUnit) like you <br/>\ncould use any other code: to do something / create some state, display <br/>\nsome data. You do not assert something as for automated testing, right?<br/>\nIn fact you are debugging or developing, not testing or doing TDD?<br/>\n<br/>\nIn this case I&#39;d agree with JB: use JUnit if it helps getting your job <br/>\ndone. I can not (yet?) see what benefits JUnit could bring comapred to <br/>\nplain Java, though.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; However since I am going to the trouble to create this test code<br/>\n&gt; which produces those objects, I would like to institutionalize those<br/>\n&gt; snippets into a test suite so I and other team members can reuse them<br/>\n&gt; easily in the same manner. That&#39;s why I dont want the code in a<br/>\n&gt; scrapbook window. I&#39;m less interested in the automated test aspect<br/>\n&gt; right now.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Right now means during development / debugging, right?<br/>\nLooks like you are playing around and getting familiar with Toplink?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I mean I want to elevate my test artifacts from workspacewindow<br/>\n&gt; snippets to code which is managed by the version control system (Envy<br/>\n&gt; etc), available to team members, etc. And yes for automated testing<br/>\n&gt; eventually.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Maybe you could turn those things you found out into automated test <br/>\ncases?<br/>\n<br/>\nRobert</div>",
