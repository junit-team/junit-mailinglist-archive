However I think I would be reluctant to change the way my\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; code was implemented just so that I could test it, as some of the other\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; My experience is different. I&#39;ve found that changing my coding style to make it testable (which doesn&#39;t mean just putting in lots of unnecessary accessors) also makes it better. The more I apply this to different targets, such as shell scripts, the more I&#39;m convinced. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Steve\n&gt; \n\nI concur.  I&#39;ve found that testable code exhibits certain composable \nproperties that foster interface-based design.  For example, the \nassembly of a few simple objects to perform a more complex task allows \nany of the objects to be mocked.  In turn, by refactoring designs to \nextract complex static relationships into interface-based compositions, \nthe design becomes more open to extension, but closed to modification. \nSo, I&#39;ll up the ante and claim that designs may change as a side effect \nof writing tests.  This is the essence of test-first design.\n\nMike\n\n-- \nMike Clark\nClarkware Consulting, Inc.\nCustom Software Architecture, Design,\nDevelopment, and Performance Consulting\nhttp://www.clarkware.com\n\n\n",
