Initially I was sceptical, but am\n&gt; becoming sold on it. This is one consideration which is bothering me.\n&gt; \n&gt; Let me hastily insert a newbie warning here - I have _not_ read all\n&gt; the documentation, nor have I tried and understood even all the\n&gt; choices available when creating testcases and testsuites. However, I\n&gt; am finding useful benefit from JUnit so far and I&#39;m motivated to take\n&gt; it further. To some extent, I&#39;m beating a path for others in my team.\n&gt; \n&gt; Java is write-once-run-anywhere - right? However, some of us need to\n&gt; test platform specific behaviour, for example, classes that only run\n&gt; in Windows or some other environment.\n&gt; \n&gt; Has anyone written up or done any work with JUnit in this area?\n&gt; \n&gt; At the moment, I&#39;m envisaging something in a testcase/testsuite\n&gt; setUp() method where I have some means of checking the the test code\n&gt; is being run in the correct environment - this may mean checking\n&gt; system properties or some external property such as environment\n&gt; variables. If the environment isn&#39;t what I need for the tests to be\n&gt; valid, then I want JUnit to accept a special fail() which says to\n&gt; JUnit - don&#39;t run _any_ of the tests in this testcase/testsuite.\n&gt; \n&gt; There&#39;s no point in running them because they won&#39;t be valid tests in\n&gt; the incorrect environment, so I don&#39;t want to see a whole bunch of\n&gt; fails because they shouldn&#39;t have been run.\n\nI would recommend doing this through shell scripting, rather than in \nJUnit. Your script would simply choose not to launch the JUnit test \nrunner under the &quot;wrong&quot; conditions.\n-- \nJ. B.
