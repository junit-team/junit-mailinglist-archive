To be specific, Clover 2.0 will allow you to build up a \nhistorical record of JUnit test results and report on them, in much the \nsame way Clover 1.x does with historical coverage and metrics information.\n\nClover 2.0 is scheduled for beta release in Q2 2005.\n\nRegards,\n-Brendan\nhttp://www.cenqua.com\nSoftware Tools for Continuous Quality\n\n\nMorten Grum wrote:\n&gt; Hi all\n&gt; \n&gt; We miss exactly this sort of history presentation of results giving a quick\n&gt; view at new tests, removed tests, new passes/failings and a focus on failing\n&gt; tests. \n&gt; \n&gt; How best to proceed I don&#39;t know. We&#39;ve been thinking of using XSLT on the\n&gt; TESTS-TestSuites.xml files which our nighly build today saves in date\n&gt; stamped report folders. But we&#39;re fairly new to XSLT and slow at getting it\n&gt; right. \n&gt; \n&gt; We&#39;d like to support the best we can to get something smart here.\n&gt; \n&gt; Morten\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;&gt;-----Original Message-----\n&gt;&gt;From: didoss@...

Before generating new report,\n&gt;&gt;why not you\n&gt;&gt;      take copy of the previous report.  In Ant API  contains copy tag\n&gt;&gt;and move\n&gt;&gt;      tag. So\n&gt;&gt;      first step you take a back up using Copy/ Move tag.\n&gt;&gt;      Second step you clear your old report using delete tag.\n&gt;&gt;      Third step create report folder again.\n&gt;&gt;      Finally you generate new report.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Are you saying there&#39;s no extension for JUnit that sends the test\n&gt;&gt;results/report into a database, using JDBC or some other mechanism?  I&#39;m\n&gt;&gt;new to JUnit, too, but I find it hard to believe that there isn&#39;t\n&gt;&gt;already software to store historical test results in a database.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Todd.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Yahoo!
