Not exactly enlightening.<br/>\n<br/>\nI prefer to focus on coding problems and possibly mentioning tests and<br/>\nhearing what they have to say about it.  It&#39;s also perfectly okay with me if<br/>\nall they talk about is &quot;automated&quot; tests and not TDD, I don&#39;t think that TDD<br/>\nis a requirement to write good tests, nor does it tell me much about how<br/>\ngood that candidate is.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nC�dric<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Sat, May 1, 2010 at 5:17 AM, Mike Forsberg &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bigmike.f@...\">bigmike.f@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This may be better in a blog post, which I will hopefully get to...<br/>\n&gt; but I&#39;d like to pose two questions to the group first. Let&#39;s call it<br/>\n&gt; research.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve just completed a set of interviews and looking back on the coding<br/>\n&gt; questions. I realized that I never followed my test first mantra that<br/>\n&gt; I perform at home.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; First question, to those giving the interview... Would you ever<br/>\n&gt; suggest/remind a candidate of TDD style in his/her code?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Second question, why on earth does a candidate, like myself, forget to<br/>\n&gt; write tests and incrementally improve their code? Do this show a lack<br/>\n&gt; of software development maturity?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; As a community reminder, and to myself.... don&#39;t forget TDD style on<br/>\n&gt; interviews.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nC�dric<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>",
