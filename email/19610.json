Just<br/>\n&gt; not sure how we can know when code in an api (subproject?) will break<br/>\n&gt; the dependent projects.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I would probably have a set of acceptance tests (in the classical sense, <br/>\nnot the XP sense) in Project 1 that checks the key parts of APIProject <br/>\nthat Project 1 uses. Run those tests as part of Project 1&#39;s regular <br/>\nbuild. This way, if APIProject fails in a way that Project 1 cares <br/>\nabout, you&#39;ll know.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, even better would be for APIProject to have a separate <br/>\nrelease schedule so that Project 1 can do some checking before it <br/>\nupgrades its version of APIProject. This way, those tests need not be <br/>\npart of every Project 1 build.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo either of these suggestions help you?<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
