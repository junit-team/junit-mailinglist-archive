If it&#39;s a mathematical formula it<br/>\ncould be doing lots of rounding, summing, adding, more<br/>\nrounding it could be that I would have to put a range<br/>\non the expected results.  I also need to know what the<br/>\nexpected result should be for all the combinations of<br/>\ncorner and edge conditions that constitute 100%<br/>\ntesting.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo what I mean by 100% method testing is that the<br/>\ntests can be generated and be exhaustive for the<br/>\ninputs corresponding calculated outputs that are of<br/>\ninterest and need to be reviewed.  That&#39;s all a<br/>\nmachine can do.  <br/>\n<br/>\nActually validating the generated output, or the<br/>\nintent behind the design of the target system, in the<br/>\noriginal case a method, is left to us.<br/>\n<br/>\nI could change the the original question, which was<br/>\n&quot;What does it mean to test a method 100%&quot; to a goal<br/>\nlike:<br/>\nHave the programmer do 0 work to find out what the<br/>\ncharacteristics of the system are and minimal work in<br/>\nvalidating those charachteristics.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\n- Ole<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- &quot;James P. Gunderson&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jgunders@...\">jgunders@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Kevin:<br/>\n&gt;    I totally agree that there are a number of<br/>\n&gt; reasons for developing and running tests. I think<br/>\n&gt; that your list is a great initial classification. I<br/>\n&gt; guess my point was focused on the suggestion that<br/>\n&gt; the programmer writes some code, and without<br/>\n&gt; providing any additional information, presses the<br/>\n&gt; button that generates all the test cases. JB brought<br/>\n&gt; up the question of how much one program can &#39;reason&#39;<br/>\n&gt; about the behavior of another program. I agree with<br/>\n&gt; your observation that the ability to characterize a<br/>\n&gt; programs behavior is frequently needed and useful. I<br/>\n&gt; also agree that one package can do a lot to analyse<br/>\n&gt; another.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; All I was pointing out is that the analyzing program<br/>\n&gt; only has the source code of the target software to<br/>\n&gt; work from. Yes, a lot can be done to make sure that<br/>\n&gt; that target program has no errors in it, but it is<br/>\n&gt; harder (without extra information) to assess whether<br/>\n&gt; the target code is doing the right thing.  For<br/>\n&gt; example, suppose I write a function to calculate the<br/>\n&gt; distance between to points in space. The analysis<br/>\n&gt; can make sure that corner cases are covered, the<br/>\n&gt; code has no unnecessary complexity, that all the<br/>\n&gt; code is reachable, and so forth. And this is really<br/>\n&gt; good, useful, and provides value to me the<br/>\n&gt; programmer.  However, if I program the distance<br/>\n&gt; calculation incorrectly (perhaps I calculate the<br/>\n&gt; manhattan distance instead of the euclidian) how<br/>\n&gt; does the analyzing program &#39;know&#39; that I coded the<br/>\n&gt; wrong function?  Without the addition of<br/>\n&gt; annotations, invariants, or the inclusion of test<br/>\n&gt; data, the analyzing program is hobbled. However, if<br/>\n&gt; the programmer is required to add the additional<br/>\n&gt; information, this violates the notion that the<br/>\n&gt; programmer has to do zero addtional work.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Now, I would be happy to have a support system that<br/>\n&gt; provides all the benefits you outlined, and I would<br/>\n&gt; be perfectly happy to have a system that would take<br/>\n&gt; a small amount of additional info and demonstrate<br/>\n&gt; (dare we say prove) that the code I wrote is both<br/>\n&gt; error free and does the job I want it to. I was<br/>\n&gt; looking at the gap between the intent of the<br/>\n&gt; programmer and the function of the target software,<br/>\n&gt; and whether it is possible to bridge that gap<br/>\n&gt; without the programmer documenting the intent.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Jim<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; +++++<br/>\n&gt; Kevin Lawrence wrote:<br/>\n&gt; There are lots of reasons why one might want to have<br/>\n&gt; tests.
