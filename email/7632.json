Here&#39;s a really short review:<br/>\n<br/>\n- the general idea is to generate JUnit tests from pre- and <br/>\npostconditions embedded into the code and written in JML<br/>\n- the user supply &quot;reasonable&quot; test inputs [...] by subclassing and <br/>\nredefining the setUp method of generated TestCase classes<br/>\n<br/>\nIn theory, this seems practical but I doubt that this will survive a <br/>\nreal world project.  Some reasons:<br/>\n<br/>\n- subclassing and redefining the setUp method means to each time create <br/>\na new TestCase subclass.  I can easily imagine loosing the overview<br/>\n<br/>\n- writing postconditions is not trivial and certainly harder than <br/>\nwriting standard tests.  Since TestCases are generated from these <br/>\npostconditions, I imagine that the normal process is<br/>\n     1) write postcondition with JML<br/>\n     2) generate tests<br/>\n     3) it fails.  But is the error in JML or in code?<br/>\n     4) check the generated tests, the JML pre/postconditions and the <br/>\ncode, goto 2)<br/>\n    I&#39;m not convinced that this is the fastest way to write tests<br/>\n<br/>\n- In their code, I see the famous:<br/>\n      catch (JMLAssertionException e) {<br/>\n         fail(e.getMessage());<br/>\n      }<br/>\n   which makes me wonder...  can they debug without any stack trace?<br/>\n<br/>\n- you have to learn another language JML and successfully writing tests <br/>\nimplies that you master JML.  How do you know that you master JML if you <br/>\ncan&#39;t test your JML code?<br/>\n<br/>\n- the example is _*trivial*_.  Testing is not an easy task (that&#39;s why <br/>\nyou have mock objects, db connections, etc...) so why are the example so <br/>\ntrivial?  At least I would like to see the testing of exceptions and <br/>\nstrings.<br/>\n<br/>\nI understand that this is a research paper and from what I&#39;ve read, the <br/>\nauthors have yet to test their method on a larger project.  I&#39;m not <br/>\nvery convinced by their method.  I&#39;m open but first would like to see <br/>\nsome real life examples.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Vladimir<br/>\n<br/>\nPS: JML is hosted on sourceforge (jmlspecs).<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nVladimir R.
