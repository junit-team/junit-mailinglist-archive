There is no &#39;zero&#39; in temperature so it is not \n&gt; correct to say it is going to be twice as cold tomorrow. And yes, I \n&gt; know there is &#39;absolute&#39; zero but ask any statistician and he will \n&gt; tell you that using ratios with our normal temperature scales is \n&gt; simply wrong.  Using ratios with time works if you are using timed \n&gt; tests and define &#39;zero&#39; as no time.  Then yes, 5 minutes is twice as \n&gt; slow as 10 minutes.  Before benchmarking make sure you have a ratio \n&gt; level variable if you want to express your results in ratios.  Then \n&gt; you must define the zero point otherwise your ratios are \n&gt; meaningless.  \n\nI was only half as slow reading this as you were writing it, but my brain\ngot twice as hot ...\n\nRon Jeffries\nwww.XProgramming.com\nThe greatest mistake we make is living in constant fear that we will make one.\n  --  John Maxwell\n\n\n",
