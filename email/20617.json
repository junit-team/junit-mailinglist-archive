By taking<br/>\nadvantage of auto-boxing, we lost the advantage of automatic widening.<br/>\n While trying to simulate widening after auto-boxing, I did something<br/>\ndumb.  Thanks to Eclipse, the dumb decision was immortalized for over<br/>\na year.

(I&#39;m expecting failure)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sorry to have come late to the conversation.  My last five attempts to<br/>\n&gt; mail the list have failed.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; JUnit 4.3 has a bug.  1.2 should never equal 1.3.  Eclipse 3.3 shipped<br/>\n&gt; with JUnit 4.3, which is why this bug has had such a long lifespan.<br/>\n&gt; You can upgrade to JUnit 4.4, wait for Eclipse 3.4, or use<br/>\n&gt; assertEquals(double, double, double) directly.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   David Saff<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
