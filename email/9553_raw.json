You run them under exactly\n&gt; &gt; the same conditions.\n...\n&gt; Seriously, it depends on why you are benchmarking. When you are\n&gt; interested in speed of long running, server side software, start-up and\n&gt; warm-up time are quite uninteresting...\n\nThe test in question measured none of these things.  It measured one\ncompute-bound activity repeated millions of times.  I believe that any\noptimizations would have occurred in the first few iterations.  The test\nitself was written in such a way as to absolutely minimize the effect\nunder test, the length of variable names; and that was only a small part\nof the larger consideration.  Java programs are slowed down by\ninterpretation and layers of abstraction.\n\nWhen you set out to test something, you must first decide what it is that\nyou are testing and why.  In part, this means paying close attention to\nthe other parties and the technical issues involved.  Then you need to\ndesign a test that reflects those considerations.\n\nIn this particular case, when asked, I said that a decent test would take\nquite some time to devise.  When the test we are talking about was\nintroduced, I pointed out that it was badly designed, but took it\nseriously: I ran it different ways and carefully logged the results.\nThey weren&#39;t what I expected, but I reported them anyway.  To put them in\nperspective, I translated the test into C++ and reported those results\nas well.  Once again, they weren&#39;t what I expected (C++ results were\nstrongly influenced by variable names; Java results weren&#39;t).\n\nFor tests to be of any value, everyone needs to subject themselves to the\ndiscipline of testing.  This includes paying attention to and accepting\nthe results.  When they aren&#39;t what you expect, you don&#39;t throw out the\ntests, you try to understand.\n\n--\nJim Dixon  jdd@...   tel +44 117 982 0786  mobile +44 797 373 7881\n\n\n",
