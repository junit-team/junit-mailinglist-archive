You have the system up and running \nand you use their recording option to run through your use cases. \nThen using their scripting language [4Test], you modify your test \ncases etc to make test suites for regression runs.\n\nJUnit on the other hand is based on the xUnit framework by Erich Beck \nand Kent Gamma and falls into the unit testing tool category. It is \nmore dependent on the actual implementation and ties closely into the \ndevelopment cycle.\n\nSo, basically, you cannot compare apples and oranges. It is possible \nto use both tools on the same project.\n\nOn a personal note, I think rather highly of SilkTest&#39;s features but \nI wouldnt invest in it at the moment. There are rumours about how \nSegue software isnt doing very well recently. Their main competitor \nMercury has a comparable tool (WinRunner) which my team uses.\n\nHope this helps...\n-Suresh\n\n--- In junit@y..., &quot;Stevens, Timothy J.
