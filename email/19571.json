Would it handle your current situation?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; As Cedric pointed out, this only works if a test is a member of only one<br/>\n&gt; group. As so many others do, many of my tests are annotated to be in<br/>\n&gt; multiple groups. For instance, &quot;nightly&quot; and &quot;quick&quot; and &quot;bug&quot; meaning<br/>\n&gt; &quot;I want CruiseControl to run this test every night. Also, this test is<br/>\n&gt; quick (and is therefore suitable for our continuous build). Finally,<br/>\n&gt; this test illustrates a bug which is not yet fixed.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Thinking specifically about the annotations &quot;nightly&quot; and &quot;bug&quot;, I would <br/>\nrather have those tests in separate source trees from the &quot;normal&quot; <br/>\ntests. I should think that moving a test in and out of the nightly build <br/>\nis not done several times per day, so an annotation is more flexible <br/>\nthan necessary. Same for tests that can&#39;t pass due to a bug in someone <br/>\nelse&#39;s code. (Of course, can&#39;t you just rewrite the test to pass now, <br/>\nbut fail when the bug is fixed? Works great for me and doesn&#39;t require <br/>\nan annotation or anything: just a failure message like &#39;Somebody might <br/>\nhave fixed bug 12578. If so, change this assertion.&#39;)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo while annotations can solve these problems, they require building a <br/>\nnew, complex thing to use well, rather than relying on support that <br/>\nalready exists, and that perhaps helps me act more intentionally when <br/>\nchanging a test&#39;s &quot;group&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m thrilled that TestNG already does this, but this is not the TestNG <br/>\nmailing list.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ.
