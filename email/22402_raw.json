For e=\r\nxample, parameterized tests have an array of arrays, each internal array is=\r\n a set of parameters to apply to the test.  Essentially, there is more onus=\r\n on the test writer to know what parameters are important to test, and how =\r\nthey are supposed to relate.\n\nTheories have much less restrictions on the d=\r\nata, and instead force the test writer to focus on the function of the theo=\r\nry independent of the data.  That&#39;s a good thing IMO.\n\nMy guess is that par=\r\nameterized tests came first, and because of the limitations it forced on th=\r\ne test writer theories came later.  That is only a guess.\n\nIn some ways I w=\r\nould like to pair the expected result with the passed in parameter, but tha=\r\nt solution requires a parameterized test.  In most applications, I care mor=\r\ne about the behavior of a class implementing an interface, or something of =\r\nthat nature.\n\nWhat I&#39;m missing here is what is the _philosophical_ differen=\r\nce?\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, C=C3=A9dric Beust =E2=99&quot; &lt;cbeust@...&gt; w=\r\nrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; If my understanding is correct, there is definitely an overlap be=\r\ntween\n&gt; parameterized tests and theories.\n&gt; \n&gt; Theories generate a set of t=\r\nuples representing the combination of a data\n&gt; set, while parameterized can=\r\n return... well, any data set.  From that angle,\n&gt; theories are a subset of=\r\n parameterized tests, and as such, might have been\n&gt; better off implemented=\r\n as a utility function rather than a full fledged\n&gt; feature.\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; Ced=\r\nric\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Fri, Feb 12, 2010 at 11:12 AM, Loritsch, Berin C. &lt;\n&gt; ber=\r\nin.loritsch@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I know I&#39;m a little slow on the upta=\r\nke, but I&#39;m asking these questions\n&gt; &gt; so that I can formulate how I&#39;m goin=\r\ng to mentor my team to make the most\n&gt; &gt; of their testing investment.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; There is a certain amount of overlap between parameterized tests and\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n theories. The parameterized tests are a bit more of a pain to set up;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nbut they provide a little more control over how things get matched up.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nOf course, theories allow for much more robust data sets by combining\n&gt; &gt; a=\r\nll the data points in every way. This can provide an order of\n&gt; &gt; magnitude=\r\n more tests automatically, but care has to be taken. For\n&gt; &gt; example, the n=\r\number of actual tests run is D^P where D is the number of\n&gt; &gt; data points a=\r\nnd P is the number of parameters on any given theory. This\n&gt; &gt; can generate=\r\n a lot of tests quickly, and the &quot;runDiscretely&quot; option I\n&gt; &gt; hacked togeth=\r\ner for theories would definitely not be a preferable.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I now know th=\r\nat assumptions are filtering devices for theories, so it\n&gt; &gt; does not mark =\r\nthe test as failed. Essentially, the reason that an\n&gt; &gt; assumption is marke=\r\nd as passing for the theory is that the assumption\n&gt; &gt; successfully filtere=\r\nd out that data combination. I get that now, but I\n&gt; &gt; probably will use th=\r\nat feature very sparingly.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The question I have is what problem was =\r\nthe reason parameterized tests\n&gt; &gt; supposed to solve, and how is that diffe=\r\nrent than the problem that\n&gt; &gt; theories are supposed to solve?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; [Non=\r\n-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n-- \n&gt; ***C=E9dric\n&gt; *\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been =\r\nremoved]\n&gt;\n\n\n\n",
