But it has<br/>\n&gt; advantages.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Consecutive tests which depend on failed tests, are not executed, which<br/>\n&gt; speeds up the tests. It also increases the information value. People are not<br/>\n&gt; confused with dozens or even hundreds of failed tests when just one or two<br/>\n&gt; tests really failed on which most other tests depend. I know of situations<br/>\n&gt; where there are dozenzs of failed tests (or more) reported by CruiseControl,<br/>\n&gt; and noone looks into them until one week before release date. This happens.<br/>\n&gt; It makes developers afraid to look into the apparent mess. If there would be<br/>\n&gt; just one or two failed tests, they would look into it more likely, and<br/>\n&gt; sooner.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The heuristic strategy would not really solve the problem. since it is not<br/>\n&gt; equivalent to the dependency specification. It would still run all tests,<br/>\n&gt; but the likelyhood that the first run tests are the cause for all the errors<br/>\n&gt; would not be very high I think, whereas you could trust the dependencies<br/>\n&gt; very much if they are set correctly.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Dependencies are a frequent topic. We have it in OSGI, in issue tracking<br/>\n&gt; software, in project management software, in requirement specifications and<br/>\n&gt; in test specifications. Why not support it in JUnit tests too?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Well, this is just some quick thoughts about it. This issue alone will<br/>\n&gt; certainly not draw people to other test frameworks, but it would improve<br/>\n&gt; JUnit I think. Noone would be forced to use that feature, but I think it<br/>\n&gt; would be good, if one could use it with JUnit, even in an coarse way (for<br/>\n&gt; example if the dependency &quot;testApplicationServerRuns&quot; passed).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Bye,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hans<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --- On Thu, 7/17/08, Kent Beck &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kentb@...\">kentb@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; From: Kent Beck &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kentb@...\">kentb@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: [junit] Does JUnit 4 now support dependencies?<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Date: Thursday, July 17, 2008, 9:28 AM<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hans,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I agree that test dependencies are a good idea.
