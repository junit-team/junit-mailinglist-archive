It =\r\nlooks quite promising.\nI have now started to create a Swing GUI as the cent=\r\nral user \ninterface for this tool. So, I&#39;m able to mark different junitrepo=\r\nrt \nresults with a label that identifies the JVM, Operating system and \nint=\r\negration build number (together with the subversion/Clearcase \nlabel) used =\r\nto run the tests.\nFor trend analysis I will generate charts using JFreeChar=\r\nt or \nStyleReportPro.\n\n--Klaus\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;kamal2222ahm=\r\ned&quot; &lt;Kamal.Ahmed@w...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Klaus,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I wrote a hack for=\r\n something like this a while ago, but it was\n&gt; optimized \n&gt; &gt; &gt; for looking=\r\n at failing tests over hundreds of program versions,\n&gt; parsed \n&gt; &gt; &gt; from t=\r\next output files.  I imagine that you could probably \nwrite \n&gt; &gt; &gt; somethin=\r\ng to do this yourself as quickly as extracting the\n&gt; interesting \n&gt; &gt; &gt; par=\r\nts from my code.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Can you give a few details about what you wou=\r\nld be looking for \nin a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; trend analysis?  Thanks,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;     Da=\r\nvid Saff\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; kp.berg wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;Hi all,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt;I know, JUnit &#39;unit&#39; tests should always pass ;-) But we are \nusing the\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;JUnit framework to write integration and systemtests as well. \nSo fro=\r\nm\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;time to time, in this area something may go wrong. Therefore \nI&#39;m\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;&gt;looking for a tool, that generates a report showing only the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;dif=\r\nferences between current and last JUnit report - which \nfailing\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;tests=\r\n were fixed, which tests stopped to pass, which tests \nwere added\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;and=\r\n which removed. Additionaly a test trend analysis should be\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;possible.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;I know, parsing the XML junitreport output and generating the=\r\n \ninfo,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;e.g., with the help of a database, would be possible. But is =\r\n\nanyone\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;aware of an existing tool or open source project that can hel=\r\np \nin this\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;direction?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Is there such a tool for eclipse/pe=\r\nrforce?\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
