If my article &quot;JUnit: A Starter Guide&quot; didn&#39;t mention\nthat explicitly, then that&#39;s a defect in my article. To be sure, Kent&#39;s\noriginal article, the one in which he introduced SUnit, says that\nplainly. I suggest you read it -- it provides the best insight into why\nxUnit is the way it is.\n\n&gt;A team member believes this is the case and this is potentially\n&gt;causing a problem with our current approach to writing automated test\n&gt;cases.  Our tests are around a server which is started and configured\n&gt;such that the tests can run against the server.  We&#39;re currently\n&gt;starting and configuring the server as part of the base test class&#39;s\n&gt;constructor, but since we don&#39;t currently allow more than one instance\n&gt;of our server to be running at a time, we cough up some errors.\n\nNever, ever, ever do stuff in the TestCase constructor. Ever. Ever.\n\nEver.\n\nUse the setUp method *or* wrap the TestSuite in a TestSetup object.\nMike&#39;s FAQ explains this in detail, I believe.\n\nBest of luck, Tom.\n\nJ. B.
