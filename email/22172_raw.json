Have you\n&gt; considered using evil reflection tricks to change the private state of\n&gt; the class under test after load time?\n\nWell, the class was designed before JUnit existed, so testability wasn&#39;t\nas well understood back then.\n\nAnd most of our testing to date has been done using the JavaTest harness,\nwhich runs *every* test in its own JVM.  Yes, overkill in the other\ndirection.\n\nYes, I&#39;ve considered reflection, but I think it&#39;s better to control the\nenvironment in which the test executes.\n\nI guess the take-away from this discussion is that JUnit doesn&#39;t have\nanything to help me and I&#39;m pretty much on my own.  :-(\n\nAnyway, that&#39;s to everyone for the suggestions.\n\n",
