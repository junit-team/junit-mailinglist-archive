I&#39;d be leery of a class that generates HTML and sorts. If the<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; sort is an another class, it can be public and far easier to test.<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; I&#39;ve always wondered why most developers are highly offended by making<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; things more public for purposes of testing<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Here is my take: for the past twenty years, we have been taught the<br/>\n&gt; benefits of object-oriented programming and encapsulation, at school,<br/>\n&gt; in the workplace and in countless books and articles.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The emphasis on testing has only received more visibility in the past<br/>\n&gt; five years, and some of its principles are indeed at odds with some of<br/>\n&gt; the OO knowledge that has been pervading the software industry for two<br/>\n&gt; decades now.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; After being told repeatedly that encapsulation was paramount to<br/>\n&gt; software quality, it&#39;s not always easy to let this go in favor of<br/>\n&gt; another technique, but I think the message is getting through and that<br/>\n&gt; more and more developers are becoming more aware of the pros and cons<br/>\n&gt; between &quot;extreme OO&quot; and &quot;pragmatic testing&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In hindsight, I am absolutely shocked that all the teachers I had in<br/>\n&gt; school 20+ years ago that I had so much respect for had absolutely no<br/>\n&gt; inclination (and sometimes only contempt) for testing...<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The #1 reason I don&#39;t reuse someone&#39;s code: I don&#39;t think it will work.<br/>\nThe #2 reason: I don&#39;t think I will be able to fit it into my design.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would venture that the key property code needs in order to promote <br/>\nreuse is that it must be reliable. I can always add another Adapter.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
