We are still discussing some of t=\r\nhe internals of the TestEngine and, therefore, are open for any kind of rec=\r\nommendations. After all, this is the first draft of the prototype.\n\nWe have=\r\n also had a discussion on points 2 and 3 within the team, but we put it on =\r\nthe backlog as we wanted to have a very early prototype to gather feedback =\r\nfrom the community. I think we will decide on them within the next iteratio=\r\nn and invite you to provide feedback anytime.\n\nConcerning your point 4: &quot;Wh=\r\ny is there an execute method in a TestEngine?=E2=80=9C\n\nThe concept of a te=\r\nst engine covers both, lookup and execute tests. The core framework is not =\r\nsupposed to execute the tests itself, because a test engine could provide v=\r\nery specific test behavior, e.g. running cucumber tests, requiring a very s=\r\npecific execution path. Therefore, we decided that the engine is responsibl=\r\ne for both. In case of the JUnit5TestEngine, we will provide extension poin=\r\nts that can be used by extension providers to hook into the standard =E2=80=\r\n=9EJava testing=E2=80=9C test run circle. We are still working on this exte=\r\nnsion model, therefore, there is not much within the code, yet. Please be p=\r\natient about this feature. I hope that we are able to provide it within the=\r\n next iteration, too.\n\nAll the best,\n\nStefan\n\n\n&gt; Am 29.11.2015 um 19:41 sch=\r\nrieb Jens Schauder jens.schauder@... [junit] &lt;junit@yahoogroups.com&gt;=\r\n:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Hi everybody,\n&gt; after looking at the JUnit-Lambda prototype, I wa=\r\ns a little disappointed that there was no TestEngine allowing to register t=\r\nests by calling a test method.\n&gt; \n&gt; So I decided to write my own engine. I =\r\nfailed miserably, which was probably due to me being really tired after a g=\r\nreat conference I attended. So take my impressions with a grain of salt, bu=\r\nt anyway here are they:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; 1. (good) the API is simple (few methods to=\r\n implement)\n&gt; \n&gt; 2. Why is discoverTest of type void? I think it should rea=\r\nlly return some kind of collection of Tests/ a TestPlanSpecification, inste=\r\nad of getting a TestPlanSpecification passed in. The merging with other res=\r\nults of other engines should be task of the launcher\n&gt; \n&gt; 3. What is an Eng=\r\nine Descriptor, and why does my engine gets one passed as an argument??? My=\r\n Engine really should know how to describe itself ... but wait an EngineDes=\r\ncriptor is some kind of TestDescriptor??? Is my engine a test? doesn&#39;t make=\r\n sense to me. If it describes a test, then why has it an attribute isTest, =\r\nwhich returns false by default?\n&gt; \n&gt; 4. Why is there an execute method in a=\r\n TestEngine? If a TestEngine is something (possibly) provided by a third pa=\r\nrty, it should not execute tests. It should register them (along with all n=\r\necessary and possible meta information) and the core of JUnit should execut=\r\ne them.\n&gt; \n&gt; 5. How is the ReflectionUtils supposed to work?  I tried findA=\r\nllClassesInPackage and findAllClassesInClasspathRoot, but didn&#39;t to manage =\r\nto get anything out of them, except null.\n&gt; \n&gt; 6. As mentioned above, I&#39;m t=\r\noo stupid (or was too tired) to make it work. If somebody wants to take a l=\r\nook, the poor results are in https://github.com/schauder/junit-lambda/tree/=\r\nlambda-engine &lt;https://github.com/schauder/junit-lambda/tree/lambda-engine&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; kind regards\n&gt; Jens\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message ha=\r\nve been removed]\n\n\n",
