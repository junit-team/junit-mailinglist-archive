    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1199349975\">Hi<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Briefly the problem is two &quot;very simple&quot; Java bean classes (A and <br/>\n&gt; B).  Class A is really simple: a constructor with a number of <br/>\n&gt; arguments and a host of accessor methods for retrieving this <br/>\n&gt; (member) data.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This sounds like a data class... why does it exist if it has no behaviour?<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is something that&#39;s been really pissing me off about Java..<br/>\ninstitutionalization of crappy design practices.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; here comes the dependency.  Class B contains a number of (two) class<br/>\n&gt; A instances.  The raw data is read within readExternal and then used<br/>\n&gt; to construct the instances of A.  Class B provides a couple of <br/>\n&gt; accessors to retrieve those A instances.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Within my unit test for B&#39;s Externalizable implementation is to <br/>\n&gt; check that what I pass in on the InputStream results in the B <br/>\n&gt; instance I expect.  But B contains two As so I appear to have two <br/>\n&gt; points of failure:  A.equals might fail which would result in the <br/>\n&gt; tests for both A and B failing.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t see a problem.  You have tests for A.  You have tests for B. <br/>\nThe fact that B involves A is a non issue.  If A breaks, it&#39;s tests<br/>\nwill fail... and yes, so will B&#39;s.. so what.  If A&#39;s tests fail, that<br/>\nindicates that A is broken... don&#39;t worry that B&#39;s tests will fail<br/>\nsince A is broken... go fix A.  All the tests should pass again.<br/>\n<br/>\nDave</div>",
