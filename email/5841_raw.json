I&#39;d like to test that our system is processing each of \nthese correctly (and hopefully dilineate each test seperately in the \nresults).  Each request file also has an expected error code, for \nensuring the server processed the request as expected.  So I need to \nread each of these files in, send them to the server for processing, \nand then test that their return code is what was expected.  In my \nelementary understanding of JUnit, I can do this one of two ways:\n\n1. Create a &quot;test&quot; method for each file on the filesystem.  Each \nmethod would call through to a protected which method which actually \nperforms the test.  Advantage: I get independent results for each \nfile on the system.  Disadvantage: I&#39;d need to add a new &quot;test&quot; \nmethod each time a new request file is added.\n\n2. Create a single &quot;test&quot; method which iterates through the set of \nfiles, processing each. Advantage: we could have a variable amount of \ntest requests without changing code.  Disadvantage: the set of \nrequests is treated as one unit(one fails, they all show up as a \nfailure).\n\nIs there a way to &quot;parameterize&quot; this process?  Perhaps by allowing \nmultiple successes/failures in a single &quot;test&quot; method, or somehow \nallowing &quot;test&quot; methods that take paramters, that are somehow \ndilineated in the results?\n\nNo good recommendations, just naive questions... sorry.\n\nThanks for any help,\nAdam\n\n\n\n",
