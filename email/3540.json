    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-186630749\">What we do here is set a system property called &quot;test.data.dir&quot; which is<br/>\npassed to the JVM running JUnit either via Ant or on the command line as a<br/>\n-Dtest.data.dir=/path/to/dir.  Any test case writer who needs access to the<br/>\ndata dir always knows he can find it by System.getProperty(&quot;test.data.dir&quot;).<br/>\n<br/>\nThat works for us.  Then under the test-data dir, which is in source control<br/>\nwith the source but not mixed in with the source, we have a directory<br/>\nstructure matching the top-levels of the package structure of the code we&#39;re<br/>\ntesting.  Not the whole structure is reflected -- just what&#39;s needed to<br/>\ndistinguish say the jrun.deployment test data from the jrun.ejb.persistence<br/>\ntests, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nGenerally, the way many applications get around this problem is to establish<br/>\na default conventional location for the directory to load data from, and<br/>\nthen use a system or application level property (registry setting, etc.) to<br/>\nmake it easily customizable.  For example:<br/>\n<br/>\nWeb-apps:<br/>\nWEB-INF/classes<br/>\nWEB-INF/lib<br/>\n<br/>\nJVM:<br/>\n$JDK_HOME/jre/lib/ext<br/>\n<br/>\nApache:<br/>\nhtdocs/<br/>\ncgi-bin/<br/>\n<br/>\nIIS:<br/>\nwwwroot/<br/>\nscripts/<br/>\n<br/>\netc.<br/>\n<br/>\nScott Stirling<br/>\nJRun QA<br/>\nMacromedia<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Cormac Mullally [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Cormac.Mullally@...\">Cormac.Mullally@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hi all,<br/>\n&gt; This question is about making your junit test&#39;s extremely reusable, i<br/>\n&gt; want my tests to run even if my code is down loaded by <br/>\n&gt; someone else and<br/>\n&gt; this means i want to avoid hard coding in locations.<br/>\n&gt; I am currently working on a system which uses a SAX parser, <br/>\n&gt; to test it I<br/>\n&gt; need access to the file system to get the xml files but i <br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t want to<br/>\n&gt; hard code in the dir.  I have looked a lot of places for the <br/>\n&gt; answer, and<br/>\n&gt; i can&#39;t find a solution to my problem.  I have read the Junit best<br/>\n&gt; practices article (It deals with this issue) but it doesn&#39;t answer my<br/>\n&gt; specific question.  I want to get access to a directory? Has <br/>\n&gt; anyone come<br/>\n&gt; across this problem?<br/>\n&gt; Does anyone have any advice or ideas on where to look?<br/>\n&gt; Cheer&#39;s,<br/>\n&gt; Cormac </span></blockquote></div>",
