The first book goes into a lot of\ndetail about what to test, how to approach testing it, how to set and\nverify reasonable goals, etc. The second gives a high level view of how\ntest automation and regression fits into the whole picture. The two\ntogether should give you a good start on what you need. The second book\nincludes templates for appropriate process artifacts.\n\nOn Mon, 3 Sep 2001, Pankaj Solanki wrote:\n\n&gt; Hi all,\n&gt;\n&gt; I am a newcomer to testing world.I will be using JUnit3.7 tool for unit testing.\n&gt; At present my assignment is to write unit test release procedure.\n&gt;\n&gt; Will you please help me out in this activity such as:\n&gt; how to proceed, what to include, how the code passes from developers to tester or\n&gt; do we have any templates / design guides for this ?\n&gt;\n&gt; I already checked in site www.junit.org for articles/documentation, but its not of my use for the task at hand.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt;\n&gt; Pankaj Solanki\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n-- \nEric Vought\nChief Technical Officer - QLUE Consulting, Inc.\n\nevought@... toll-free: 888-771-3538  RTP area: 919-816-9901\n\n\n",
