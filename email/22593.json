Between the two of you, you had the right answer ;-)  In the &quot;Install New Software&quot; dialog under Galileo there was nothing there specific to JUnit.  But it occurred to me that installing &quot;EPP Java Package&quot; and &quot;Java EE IDE Feature&quot; was a reasonable thing to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nDid that and now JUnit 4.5 is install and I can access the features I previously mentioned were lacking.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!</div>",
