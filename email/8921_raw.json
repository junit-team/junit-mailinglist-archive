To the extent I am an &quot;OO\npurist&quot;, I am one because it helps me write better code faster. As does\nJunit - among other things by bringing coupling problems to light.\n\n&gt; I attempt to write standalone (decoupled)\n&gt; classes, I attempt to make them have well structed &quot;APIs&quot; but\n&gt; at the end of the day, if A uses B (however implemented, and\n&gt; however used -- aggregation, subclassing, command/messaging paradigms,\n&gt; whatever) *for whatever reason* then surely for A to work, B\n&gt; ought work?\n\nNo. A can use B without even knowing about it! And if it doesn&#39;t know\nabout B, you can simply replace B with B&#39; for your A-tests.\n\n&gt; I don&#39;t think we ever gave these fair hearing because (I\n&gt; feel) we spent all the time on why the idea was bad. To be\n&gt; frank, I didn&#39;t think anybody was listening,\n\nI think the more constructive approach might be to question ones own\nability to explain instead of the others willingness to listen. I might\nbe wrong.\n\n&gt; I think the points (one by one) that need to get agreed or dismissed\n&gt; are: \n&gt; \n&gt; 1) Are test suites (as collections of tests, which have some\n&gt; hierarchical/run order effect) are a &quot;second place&quot; to manage\n&gt; relationship between testcases? Since managing in two places\n&gt; is always flawed, are suites flawed? [If I refactor testcases\n&gt; I might forget to refactor the suites, and that is where errors creep\n&gt; in.]\n\nPlease explain wether you are speaking about manually or automatically\nconstructed suites here (or both?).\n\n&gt; 2) Are test suites becoming obsoleted by &quot;brute force\n&gt; collectors&quot;? How would we know other than a user survey?\n\nIt seems to me that the TestSuite class can&#39;t become obsolete by\ncollectors, as the collectors need to use it. So I don&#39;t understand what\nyou&#39;d like to do based on that survey.\n\n&gt; 3) If &quot;suites&quot; have outlived their purpose, why are they the\n&gt; &quot;framework&quot; way to manage run order?\n\nThey aren&#39;t. They are the frameworks way to have a hierarchical\ncollection of tests. I don&#39;t know of any alternative.\n\n&gt; 4) Does &quot;run order/dependency&quot; (not side-effect dependency)\n&gt; have any value -- despite it&#39;s smell?\n\nOf course it does, to some users of the framework. And there are already\ntools out there providing that value. If they don&#39;t suffice, it would be\nvery easy to implement your own.\n\n&gt; 5) Is &quot;run order&quot; something that ought be in the framework, however\n&gt; it is implemented. \n\n&quot;Run order&quot; is something that is in the framework. How to decide about\nrun order isn&#39;t - and shouldn&#39;t be, IMHO.\n\n&gt; As agree w/ David, in a mail I sent yesterday but haven&#39;t\n&gt; seen list exploded yet, I *may* be right about some of this,\n&gt; but I don&#39;t think dependency will get an open hearing &#39;cos of\n&gt; the stench of side-effect dependency. So be it.\n\nIf you think so, perhaps we should stop this discussion?\n\n\nRegards, Ilja\n\n\n",
