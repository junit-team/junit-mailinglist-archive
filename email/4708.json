    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2058921300\">We&#39;ve been using JUnit with Ant for a few months now. The main <br/>\nadvantages for us are the support base for JUnit -- if we run into a <br/>\nproblem, we can turn to discussion groups for help -- and that the <br/>\nopen source community is continuously improving JUnit. So we don&#39;t <br/>\nhave to worry about developing and maintaining our own testing tool.<br/>\n<br/>\nJUnit can also work with other tools, such as Ant and HTTPUnit. The <br/>\ncombination of these tools give us a framework from which we can <br/>\nquickly put together automated test suites.<br/>\n<br/>\nJUnit does have some limitations. We use it for functional testing <br/>\nrather than strictly unit testing, and we&#39;ve had to tweak it here and <br/>\nthere (nice to have the source code available, in those cases). I <br/>\nintroduced JUnit to my manager in the context of a pilot project, and <br/>\nit helped my team to understand its capabilities and limitations <br/>\nbefore implementing it. As a result, we typically mix some of JUnit&#39;s <br/>\nfeatures with some of our own techniques when we write our black-box <br/>\ntests.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Todd<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In junit@y..., arathi.bhaskar@i... wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Hi<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am familiar with Junit for a month or two month. I have also <br/>\nstarted to<br/>\n&gt; look into Cactus project for servlet testing. I am one of the very <br/>\nfew<br/>\n&gt; people in the organization to know about this & want to share <br/>\nJunit&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; features & advantages with others & convince them of its use. I <br/>\nhave tested<br/>\n&gt; some Java programs with Junit. I gave a presentation to my managar, <br/>\nto see<br/>\n&gt; if we can pilot the use of Junit in some project.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Can someone tell me the real advantages of using Junit over the<br/>\n&gt; individual&#39;s own Unit testing of the Java Code written by him. I <br/>\nhave been<br/>\n&gt; reading the articles posted on Junit homepage. Where can I find more<br/>\n&gt; articles giving the advantages of Junit.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks & Regards<br/>\n&gt; Arathi<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -----------------------Disclaimer------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The views of the author may not necessarily reflect those<br/>\n&gt; of the Company.
