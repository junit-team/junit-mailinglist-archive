In 10-15 minutes what do you try and build? Any<br/>\n&gt; reason you choose it? Anything in particular you try to demonstrate?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; With apologies if you see this posting twice - my gmail account is<br/>\n&gt; getting caught in yahoo&#39;s aggressive spam filter.

It demonstrates things like replacing one field with two <br/>\nequivalent ones, inlining constructors and driving the design of an <br/>\nindependent method (NumberTheory.gcd()) that might or might not need its <br/>\nown tests. It raises a good number of questions for a 90-minute demo <br/>\n(with Q&A as we go).<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
