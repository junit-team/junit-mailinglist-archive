Especially when the objects and interfaces \n&gt; are in the midst of evolving.\n\nThey can be made solid enough.  I myself also do iterative\ndevelopment.  I work toward the usage of the component before\nI focus on 100% functionality.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Well, maybe the difference of our views lies in the fact that \n&gt; I personally do as much test-driven, i.e. test-first \n&gt; development as possible where the design and thus the \n&gt; contracts come slowly into being (and often disappear \n&gt; quickly). Martin Fowler calls that evolutionary design and I \n&gt; guess that I often don&#39;t take the time to get the contracts \n&gt; straight and tight enough.\n\nThat is a slight difference in approach.  I look at the interface\nfirst, then the testing, and finally the implementation.  I tend\nto look at my system somewhat like a play.  Each component has\na &quot;role&quot; to play in the system.  Each role interacts with other\nroles in a predefined manner (aka script or contract).  I also\ntend to have several small components or interfaces, and have\nthem delegate to other components as need be.  That makes it\neasier to understand/design.\n\nTo me, the interface is the criteria I have for making the tests.\nNow, until the component is ready, the interface is marked as\na developmental interface.  That means that the test and the\ninterface can change.  I work torwards stablizing the interface\nASAP.  I also use the Java &quot;interface&quot; keyword to define my\ninterfaces.\n\ninterface Store\n{\n    void store(String key, Object val);\n    Object retrieve(String key);\n    void remove(String key);\n}\n\nThat interface is enough to know how to use the object store.\nIf I need a guarantee that an object store keeps the object\nreferences persistently, I use another interface to represent\nthat additional contract:\n\ninterface PersistentStore extends Store {}\n\nThat way I have the option of using a memory bound storage,\na cache like storage, or a more permanent storage.\n\nIf I need the guarantee of permanance, I use a component that\nimplements the PersistentStore interface.\n\nIt just helps me get there quicker.\n\n\n&gt; Since your examples are taken from Excalibur I suppose that \n&gt; you, Berin, are following a component-oriented and more \n&gt; &quot;design-up-front&quot; development strategy. It could be that this \n&gt; difference results in different testing strategies as well.\n&gt; \n\nYes I am.  The two examples I gave though are not components\nin the classic sense.  They are utility classes that other\ncomponents can use.\n\nThere are different needs with component testing than with\nregular class testing.  I believe I posted a very quick\nsummary of the difference between components and objects\nin another post to the list.\n\n\n",
