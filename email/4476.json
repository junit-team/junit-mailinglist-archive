JUnit won&#39;t do that.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn testing against the KVM, we found all kinds of J2ME-specific things that<br/>\nwe needed to change.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you need to startup your MIDlet to test pieces of your application, might<br/>\nI suggest that your application might be too closely tied to your<br/>\nimplementation platform? The same design logic applies to MIDlets as it does<br/>\nto any sort of GUI application. Keep your business logic separate from your<br/>\npresentation logic. This lets you test your business logic without having to<br/>\nset up all the context stuff that MIDlets need. This is the same thing I<br/>\nrecommend and do when I write applets, servlets, etc. If you make those<br/>\nclasses dumb, then you can test the rest of your system without them. And<br/>\nyou also have a lot more flexibility in how you deploy your business logic,<br/>\nas it is not tied to a particular platorm implementation.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe actually did what you said, and had J2MEUnit start up inside a MIDlet<br/>\nwhich we ran on one of the emulators. But, we were still testing out the<br/>\nbusiness logic of our system, not the MIDlet itself.<br/>\n<br/>\nbab<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\nBrian Button             <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bbutton@...\">bbutton@...</a><br/>\nSenior Consultant    <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.objectmentor.com\">http://www.objectmentor.com</a><br/>\nObject Mentor, Inc.<br/>\n<br/>\nExtreme Programming in St. Louis <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/xpstl\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/xpstl</a><br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Roland Kofler&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:roland_kofler@...\">roland_kofler@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, March 27, 2002 11:16 AM<br/>\nSubject: AW: [junit] j2me unit testing<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Brian Button wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;What we did, and as I recommend to my clients, is to separate out the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;plumbing logic (the MIDlet) from the business logic.

Put all the complexity into the business logic classes,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;which are a lot easier to test.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But, why use j2meUnit then? if you test only the &quot;non midp specific&quot; logic<br/>\n&gt; you can also relay on JUnit.<br/>\n&gt; I found it very easy to modify the test suit to run as midlet on an<br/>\n&gt; emulator, now you can use the textui to assert RMS operations etc.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I recommend to invoke testsuites from midlets added to your suite, on<br/>\ndeploy<br/>\n&gt; you can easly remove them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; regards roland kofler </span></blockquote></div>",
