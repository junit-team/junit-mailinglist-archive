You can just\n&gt; use reflection to pick up all of the methods on a test case class that\n&gt; accept and return void and treat them as tests.\n\nTrue, that.  I&#39;ve invited Steve to contribute a custom runner for\nJUnit 4 that does just that.  There&#39;s two specific problems with the\nsuggestion:\n\n1) JUnit 4 allows test cases to inherit from domain classes, sometimes\na useful trick when migrating legacy code, which would break using\nthis scheme.\n2) We would then need to annotate classes, or packages, or something,\nto indicate which classes should be used as tests, to allow nifty test\nrunners like ant or Eclipse to work their automagic.\n\nNeither of these is a death knell to the idea.  But I&#39;m still afraid\nof introducing &quot;punning&quot; like this by default.  As an example, Ruby&#39;s\ntest::unit, by default, automatically picks up any loaded subclass of\nTestCase (wouldn&#39;t _that_ be lovely) and runs it.  But doing so makes\nthe Abstract Test Case pattern unusable.\n\nSo far, this is mostly justification of conservatism, so I&#39;m open to\nfurther opinionating.\n\n   David Saff\n\n",
