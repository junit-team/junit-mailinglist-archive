Making it protected\n&gt;  means that your test class (or a class it uses) needs to extend that class.\n\nNot true, this is a common mussunderstanding, protected is /less/\nrestricted than package private so you get all you get from package\nprivate + that the functionality is available to extending classes\nfrom any package.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;  I still think that package protected gives you the best of both worlds:  the\n&gt;  method can be used from any class as long as it belongs to the same package,\n&gt;  so the coupling is minimal.\n&gt;\n\nI agree with you that package-private is a better choice since the\nfunctionality you want to protect is available only to those classes\nin the same package and not also to those that just extend your class\nfrom any package.\n\nI would pick this approach any day over tweaking access to private\nmethods via reflection. I also think that Andreas suggestion, creating\na public interface that exposes what you want to expose is good, but I\nwould opt for that sooner and not as a last resort.\n\nI agree even more with previous posters that whan you feel that a\nprivate method should be tested you should first and foremost think\nabout your design. If it is meaningful to test it is most likely\nmeaning ful to use and it may be baecause the method is in the wrong\nplace that you feel it should be private.\n\nHeck, maybe the best way is to make it public, feel really about that\nmethod being public and figure out where it should be when you\nrefactor.\n\n/Regards\n\n",
