I am trying to test a method from a class where<br/>\n&gt; I need to do lot of env specific (like logger, database connection<br/>\n&gt; etc) initialisations in it&#39;s constructor.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t want to initialize all those (by creating the object, may be<br/>\n&gt; using &#39;new&#39;)for testing a small piece of code<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; what is the best way to acheive it?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You want to test a class, but you don&#39;t want to do the work it takes to <br/>\ncreate an instance of that class. I&#39;d say you have a problem: no object, <br/>\nno test.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would like to suggest that you /don&#39;t/ need to do a lot of <br/>\nenvironment-specific initialization in the constructor of the class you <br/>\nwant to test, especially considering that you /believe/ that you should <br/>\nbe able to test the class without doing all that work. So that means <br/>\nthat the constructor(s) you have for that class, while they work, are <br/>\ninadequate. Perhaps you could add one more constructor that bypasses all <br/>\nthat stuff. Would that work?<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
