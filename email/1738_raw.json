That is, implement the XP Planning\n&gt;Game where the community is the customer.  The community could\n&gt;express what they desire (stories) and set priorities.\n\nTha would be cool. The &quot;tracker - feature request&quot; @ sourceforge seems to be\na good place to put feature requests, alas there is no voting capability.\n\nAlso, Kent himself said here\n(http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?thread_id=112344&forum_id=48542)\nthat discussion of the next release should go @\nhttp://c2.com/cgi/wiki?JunitNextRelease\n\n&gt;- Providing hooks for extensions would be great.  Right now, the most\n&gt;frequently use hook is subclassing.  Unfortunately this makes it\n&gt;difficult to use two extensions at once.\n\nIt think this is the way to go. Provide stable enough hook so that multiple\nextensions won&#39;t clash with one another. Extending by subclassing leads to\ntroubles when, for example,  you want to use a data driven extension thaty\nsays &quot;just derive your test cases from ConfigurableTestCase&quot; and at the same\ntime a servlet testing extension that says &quot;Juste derive your test cases\nfrom  ServletTestCase&quot;.\n\nBy having a more flexible extension mechanism (like test result listeners\nmaybe...) the core junit could continue to be small and beautifull while\nenabling other graviting package to integrate without junit code\nmodification and without clashing with other extensions.\n\njust my 0.02$,\nmathieu\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: dfw1@...\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSent: Monday, June 25, 2001 11:17 AM\n--- In junit@y..., &quot;Mike Duffy&quot; &lt;mike.duffy@c...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Perhaps there could be a section on the junit.org site that allows\nmembers of the community to post request for changes,\n&gt; make comments on the existing posts and keeps a weighted counter\n(five stars is five votes).\n&gt;\nDoes http://sourceforge.net/projects/junit/ do what you need?
