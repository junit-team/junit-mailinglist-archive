And, sometimes, readability trumps duplication.<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;I would be *very* reluctant to accept that. I can&#39;t remember an instance<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;where, when at first sight it seemed like accepting duplication improved<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;readability, I couldn&#39;t come up with a more appropriate design that was<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;both readable and duplication-free. Most often, I just missed an<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;important insight.<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  It happens to me sometimes, but I&#39;m reluctant to say that readability<br/>\n&gt;  trumps duplication sometimes because it is far to likely to be used as<br/>\n&gt;  an excuse.<br/>\n<br/>\nI fully agree with the notion that we shouldn&#39;t accept duplication for<br/>\nthe very same reason as Michael pointed out. Yet, I sometimes do so.<br/>\nWhy?<br/>\n<br/>\nMost of my work these days is spent coaching and working with teams<br/>\nand individuals who are just adopting these techniques, sometimes<br/>\nwriting their very first unit tests. In doing this work I&#39;ve more than<br/>\nonce found myself in a situation where the code base I&#39;m looking at<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t reveal me a better design.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn other words, I&#39;m not yet intimate enough to envision the<br/>\nrefactoring so I decide to leave it there for now--knowing that I&#39;m<br/>\ntreading a dangerous path--and being on the lookout for a design that<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t exhibit that defect.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLasse<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nLasse Koskela<br/>\n* Author of &quot;Test Driven&quot; (Manning Publications, 2007) *<br/>\n* Reaktor Innovations * <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ri.fi/en\">http://www.ri.fi/en</a> * </span></blockquote></div>",
