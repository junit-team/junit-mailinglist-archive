It should be considered to enable check\nalso the c=\r\nause of the exception.\n\nFor example, InvocationTargetException with nested =\r\nexception is\nthrown. I have currently catch of InvocationTargetException an=\r\nd\nafterwards I check whether InvocationTargetException.getCause() is\ninstan=\r\nceof expected exception.\n\nOne more example is javax.ejb.EJBException which =\r\ngetCause() mechanism,\nat least at JBoss and Glassfish implimentation, is no=\r\nt working and\ngetCausedByException() should be called instead, so it should=\r\n be a way\nto say it in @Test annotation.\n\nIt can be considered to check onl=\r\ny the cause, but the cause of the\ncause and so forth. It can be useful in s=\r\nome (rare) cases and\nimplementation is not difficult.\n\n\n",
