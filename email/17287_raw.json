Then I would agree with you=\r\n. I think that ALL software out\nthere is tested but a lot of the time it is=\r\n a manual effort and the\nwhole piece of software is not guaranteed to be te=\r\nsted every release.\nAlso a lot of testing is sadly deferred to end users.\n\n=\r\n2) I certainly don&#39;t think that most software out there works great. I\nthin=\r\nk most software is living up to our expectations of how it should\nwork but =\r\nI have certainly been on projects where nothing has been\ntested automatical=\r\nly and that had a level that we thought were\nacceptable that I now think is=\r\n embarrasing. Everything is relative.\n\nAs an example:\n\nI know if a company =\r\nthat released a whole lot of custom made software\nto their very large userb=\r\nase. When a new feature or &quot;application&quot; as\nit was called (this was a web-p=\r\nortal) was released live it was\nperfecly natural to have a &quot;break in period=\r\n&quot; of a few weeks/months.\nEvreybody knew that this is what to expect when ne=\r\nw software is\nreleased. The customer was used to this and did not find it s=\r\ntrange\nalthough they found it a bit stressfull. The developers of course ma=\r\nde\nsure that they had their evenings free atleast the first week after\ngoin=\r\ng live. The applications were devloped mainly by contractors.\n\nOf course te=\r\nsting was done, rigorous testing, the code was moved\nbetween and tested in =\r\ndifferent environments according to a very\nstrict process. A LOT of manual =\r\neffort was spent testing the software\nand still over a 100 bug reports in t=\r\nhe first week, after going live,\nfrom end-users was not unheard of. This wa=\r\ns for relatively small and\nsimple applications.\n\nI don&#39;t know about you, bu=\r\nt I don&#39;t think I ever submitted a bugreport\nto a site I visited that gave =\r\nme an error. Aparently some people do\nand my guess is that they are not hap=\r\npy when they take time out of\ntheir schedules to do that.\n\nOne application =\r\nwas later developed where automatic unit testing was\nused (with JUnit). Tha=\r\nt application was a real application and a\n&quot;proof of concept&quot; for unit test=\r\ning. The people that coded the\napplication had not used JUnit before in the=\r\nir development but were\nwell familiar with the concept and had finally conv=\r\ninced the right\npeople that it should be tried. So the developers were lear=\r\nning while\ncoding and there were some personal prestige at stake so I bet t=\r\nhey\nwere more careful than normal.\n\nWhen that application went live it was =\r\na success. To this day I only\nknow of one or two bugs that have been submit=\r\nted ever about that\napplication.\n\nI think that using JUnit was a big part o=\r\nf that success but of course\nthe extra prestige and strong commitment from =\r\nthe team was a highly\ncontributing factor. Since then JUnit has been a requ=\r\nirement by the\ncustomer. It has worked better but not as good as that succe=\r\nss-story.\nI think the biggest reason it could not be reproduced fully was t=\r\nhat\nJUnit was forced on people without any education effort. JUnit doesn&#39;t\n=\r\nwork &quot;well&quot;/&quot;at all&quot; if you don&#39;t understand why you should use it.\nMore im=\r\nportantly, It doesn&#39;t fix any problems if you think that\neverything is fine=\r\n (there are no real problems, so what if we release\na few bugs! this is sof=\r\ntware!)\n\nTo sum it up, I agree that most applications out there are not tes=\r\nted\nthe way we would like them to have been tested. I think most of them\nwo=\r\nrk well enough but I also think there are generally /too many/ bugs\nin soft=\r\nware today. I think that users and more importantly\n/developers/ have an un=\r\nhealthily high acceptance for this situation. I\nthink we as developers shou=\r\nld not be satisfied with delivering\nsoftware that contains stuff that doesn=\r\n&#39;t work even if /most/ of the\nstuff delivered works. I think this attitude =\r\nis unproffesional and I\ndon&#39;t want to work that way. I want to /know/ what =\r\nI delver works. I\nam not 100% sure all of the time about this but until I a=\r\nm I am not\nsatisfied with the situation.\n\nI am convinced that whenever you =\r\ntrade testing for features it will\nbite you sooner or later. I still do thi=\r\ns more often than I would\nlike, it happens from time to time but I hope tha=\r\nt I have learned\nbefore I can no longer get away with that &quot;my stuff tend t=\r\no work\nbetter than other stuff&quot; (the stuff that is not tested as well).\n\n\n&gt;=\r\n  I&#39;d like everybody to reflect on that for a while before I send my next\n&gt;=\r\n  message...\n\nI look forward to your next message. It is uch an interesting=\r\n subject.\nThanks for the discussion.\n\n/Joakim Ohlrogge\n\n",
