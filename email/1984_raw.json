It would strike me that a more meaningful metric\nwould be the number of asserts, since that indicates how many conditions\nwere checked for correctness. So it is true that a unit test passes or it\ndoesn&#39;t and if it doesn&#39;t, you fix it and move on. However, if someone is\ngoing to tout metrics, they should at least pick one that is as meaningful\nas possible.\n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nMike Silverstein\nSilverMark, Inc.\nThe object testing company\nhttp://www.silvermark.com\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: kentbeck@... [mailto:kentbeck@...]\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, July 17, 2001 8:24 PM\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: [junit] Re: Why doesn&#39;t JUnit count asserts?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Sorry to have noticed this thread so late. JUnit doesn&#39;t count\n&gt; asserts because they don&#39;t matter in unit testing--a test runs or it\n&gt; doesn&#39;t. If it doesn&#39;t, you don&#39;t have anything more important to do\n&gt; than fix it.\n&gt;\n&gt; Acceptance testing has different politics. There are styles of\n&gt; development/markets/customers where there *are* more important things\n&gt; to do than fix acceptance tests (I don&#39;t do this, but I understand\n&gt; the motivation). Then, degree of fuckedness is useful business input\n&gt; and worth tracking.\n&gt;\n&gt; Kent\n&gt; P.S. I apologize for the language. Not running a test correctly is\n&gt; bad.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
