In general it worked fine. However every<br/>\nnow and then (depending on user actions and what else the machine has<br/>\nrunning) we&#39;d run into the problems &quot;Missed notification&quot; and &quot;Early<br/>\nnotification&quot; which are described in thread books such as Paul Hyde&#39;s &quot;Java<br/>\nThread Programming&quot;. Solutions to these &quot;standard&quot; problems are also given<br/>\nin the thread books so we have now solved the problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat we do not have is a test that tells us that we&#39;ve solved the problem!<br/>\nWe only have tests that generally pass even when the problem is there!<br/>\n<br/>\nWe would like to write a test that specifically tests our wait()-notify()<br/>\nconstructs for robustness against &quot;Missed notification&quot; and &quot;Early<br/>\nnotification&quot;. Has anybody already though through how best to test this? Or<br/>\ndoes anyone have a reference to an article or web where this test may be<br/>\ndescribed in a generic way or with an example?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance.<br/>\n<br/>\nMorten<br/>\n<br/>\n========================================<br/>\nMorten Grum<br/>\nPH-Consult<br/>\nOrdruphøjvej 4<br/>\n2920 Charlottenlund<br/>\nDenmark<br/>\n<br/>\nTel.: +45 39 96 22 08<br/>\nMob.: +45 40 93 43 84<br/>\nFax.: +45 39 63 02 72<br/>\nMail: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mg@...\">mg@...</a><br/>\nWeb : www.phc.dk<br/>\n========================================</div>",
