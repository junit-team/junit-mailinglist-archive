It&#39;s not quite so much of a problem, but being OC as we are\nit&#39;s a royal annoyance, and I was hoping the list could help.\n\nBackground: I&#39;m using Eclipse 3.0.0, Ant 1.6.2 and JUnit 3.8.1\n(Windoze 2K). The code I&#39;m writing and testing uses Hivemind 1.0 to\ndynamically create my objects and wire them together.\n\nMy Eclipse project is set up just fine. The Ant scripts do their\nthing. Running the &quot;compile-all&quot; target from either within Eclipse or\nvia Ant on the command-line is A-OK.\n\nA have JUnit tests that run fine when run within Eclipse whether\nindividually or as a suite.\n\nI then created a &lt;junit&gt; task within the project&#39;s Ant build scripts\nto run the suite. When I ran the Ant &quot;test-XXX&quot; targets _from the\ncommand line_, everything worked as expected.\n\nHere&#39;s the rub: When I run the same Ant targets from _within Eclipse_,\nI get a bunch of java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError exceptions (when using\nthe Hivemind stuff).\n\nWhat I&#39;ve noticed is that when I run the test targets in Eclipse, the\nSystem property &quot;java.class.path&quot; is missing a couple of directories,\nmost notably, my project&#39;s ${build} directory.\n\nI&#39;m still trying to figure out what&#39;s causing this (remember, the\nbuild itself works either way, and only the tests are failing in\nEclipse) but was wondering if anyone&#39;s done this before or has had any\nsimilar experiences and might be able to point me to a few leads?\n\nThanks in advance!\nAlistair A.
