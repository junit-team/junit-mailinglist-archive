For this example, mine would look like:\n&gt;\n&gt; test_push_emptyStack()\n&gt; test_push_stackWith1Element()\n&gt; test_push_fullStack()\n&gt; test_push_nullElement()\n\nI&#39;ve lately tended toward declarative sentences where possible in my own \nwork, such as\n\ntestPushAddsAnElementToEmptyStack\ntestPushAddWorksOnStackWithOneElement // ?\n@Test pushThrowsExceptionOnFullStack\n@Test pushRejectsNullElement\n\nAdvantages:\n\n1) It makes me think harder about what I&#39;m testing.  For example, why am \nI testing a stack with one element?  Just to make sure that a stack can \nhold two elements?  In that case, I might call it \ntestStackCanHoldTwoElements, since it&#39;s not really about the push element.\n\n2) I don&#39;t have to necessarily have a method already in mind when I name \nthe test.\n\nDisadvantages:\n\n1) When I get lazy (not that this is at all common.  :-) ), you might \nsee terrible names like @Test pushIsCorrect or testPushWorks, which are \nvery questionably better than testPush.  On the other hand, the terrible \nnames make me more likely to think of better names, which can make me \nthink more about better tests.\n\n2) \nCamelCaseIsNotActuallyTheEasiestThingToRead_whichMakesMeWonderIfSomeSortOfDescriptiveFreetextAnnotationWouldBeBetter(WikisEventuallyDidThis).\n\nShare and Enjoy,\n\n    David Saff\n\n\nSPONSORED LINKS Basic programming language C programming language Computer programming languages \nThe c programming language C++ programming language List of programming languages \n\n\n\nYAHOO!
