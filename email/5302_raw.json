We \n&gt; are having some issues whereby the static variables\n&gt; in the mock \n&gt; objects are being held in the class loader.  This\n&gt; appears to be \n&gt; creating nasty confusion and giving us errors in our\n&gt; tests depending \n&gt; on the granularity by which they are run. Our\n&gt; utlimate aim was to \n&gt; execute our application test classes through a\n&gt; master TestAll \n&gt; however this seems like its not going to work.  Our\n&gt; proposed work \n&gt; around is to use ant to identify each test case and\n&gt; run them \n&gt; independently.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Has anyone seen this issue before and are there any\n&gt; suggested work \n&gt; arounds ?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks\n&gt; Matthew.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
