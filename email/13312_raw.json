In fact from ti=\r\nme to time I use the &quot;OO behaviour&quot; Junit shows, by\n&gt;  implementing the Abs=\r\ntract Testcase pattern.\n&gt;  \n&gt;  &gt; I did not want to &#39;derail&#39; the\n&gt;  &gt; discus=\r\nsion from testing to making design changes and thatz\n&gt;  &gt; why I made it cle=\r\nar that &#39;letz not question the design&#39;.\n&gt;  \n&gt;  Yes, I understand that.\n&gt;  \n=\r\n&gt;  But, as I tried to say earlier, the &quot;inventors&quot; of Junit, and many of th=\r\neir\n&gt;  users, actually actively *use* writing tests as a design technique. =\r\nSo\n&gt;  &quot;questioning the design&quot; actually doesn&#39;t sound like &quot;derailing&quot; to m=\r\ne, but\n&gt;  quite on topic. Your mileage may vary, of course.\n&gt;  \n&gt;  &gt; Also s=\r\nomeone was of the opinion that deep heirarchy could be\n&gt;  &gt; a bad design..I=\r\n wanted to step-in and say &#39;of course not..it has it&#39;s\n&gt;  &gt; own reason&#39;. \n&gt;=\r\n  \n&gt;  I believe you that you have your reasons. What I&#39;m not going to belie=\r\nve\n&gt; that\n&gt;  easily is that the design really cannot possibly be improved b=\r\ny flattening\n&gt;  the hierarchy - that simply too strongly contradicts my exp=\r\nerience. It\n&gt; would\n&gt;  have been interesting to discuss this specific insta=\r\nnce, and I would have\n&gt;  expected to learn something from it. But I also un=\r\nderstand and respect that\n&gt;  you are not interested in such a discussion.\n&gt;=\r\n  \n&gt;  &gt;&gt;  &gt; In real life, faulty or imperfect designs are the norm.\n&gt;  &gt;&gt; \n=\r\n&gt;  &gt;&gt;  Sure. That&#39;s one reason unit testing is so valuable: it makes some\n&gt;=\r\n  &gt;&gt; of the  imperfectionism more visible, so that we can work on it.\n&gt;  \n&gt;=\r\n  &gt; &#39;Faulty or imperfect design&#39;- well thatz not the case when we\n&gt;  &gt; can&#39;=\r\nt use jUnit for this purpose.\n&gt;  \n&gt;  I don&#39;t understand what you want to sa=\r\ny here.\n&gt;  \n&gt;  &gt; Sometimes the app design might\n&gt;  &gt; not provide interfaces=\r\n to such a granular level that unit\n&gt;  &gt; test might need.  It doesn&#39;t mean =\r\nthe design is imperfect or\n&gt;  &gt; sub-optimal. \n&gt;  \n&gt;  With all due respect, =\r\nin my experience it very likely means exactly that,\n&gt; as\n&gt;  it means that t=\r\nhings are rather strongly coupled. But perhaps we should\n&gt;  simply agree to=\r\n disagree here...?\n&gt;  \n&gt;  No hard feelings,\n&gt;  \n&gt;  Ilja\n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  ____=\r\n____________________________\n&gt;  Yahoo!
