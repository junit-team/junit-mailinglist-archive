Since JUnit 3 allows fully <br/>\ndynamic test tree generation, it can be undecidable in advance whether a <br/>\ngiven test case will even be included in the suite that is run, and more <br/>\ndifficult than that to actually dynamically reconstruct the test case <br/>\nalone without running the rest of the suite.<br/>\n<br/>\nEclipse will work correctly rerunning tests on suites made up of <br/>\nTestCases and TestSuites constructed in the usual way, such as <br/>\nsuite.addTestCase(MyTest.class).  This seems to be a good way to cover <br/>\n80% of what users want.  Is there another JUnit 3 pattern so prevalent <br/>\nthat addressing it would up that coverage to 90%?<br/>\n<br/>\nOne cool thing about JUnit 4 is that while you should be able to do <br/>\narbitrary test-creation cleverness using the @RunWith annotation, this <br/>\nis a static annotation that IDE&#39;s can easily check.  So version 17.1 of <br/>\nsome IDE might be able to rerun tests run with TestClassRunner (JUnit 4 <br/>\ndefault) and OldTestClassRunner (JUnit 3 default), and if it turns out a <br/>\nlot of people are using Parameterized, 17.2 could add support for that.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope that helps,<br/>\n<br/>\n    David Saff</div>",
