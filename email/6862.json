I find this extremely useful, and often use<br/>\nmock objects because they allow me to separate tests from heavy duty<br/>\nexternal dependencies like databases and app servers.  Mock objects for<br/>\ncommon things become extremely useful and wind up being re-used across the<br/>\nteam.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; &gt; My concern is not about shipping it with the product; my concern is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that, whether it ships or not, it&#39;s extra code to write and maintain.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Like I said, there&#39;s no reason it couldn&#39;t be reused.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sure. But even just doing the setup on that object is still more code<br/>\n&gt; than simply not testing it.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>At this point the discussion turned to not testing the example at all,<br/>\nrather than which strategy for testing was better.  I didn&#39;t sign up for<br/>\nthis turn of events.  :-&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; &quot;I would predict that the strategy listed above, while good<br/>\n&gt; &gt; intentioned, on a project of any size would wind up with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; lots of extra code throughout added just for testability.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s not lots of extra code. I added, in my example, two extra lines of<br/>\n&gt; code:<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Ha, ha.  Again, we are discussing general principles and you retreat to the<br/>\nparticular case.  Yes, two lines in this case.  But I am trying to analyze<br/>\nthe strategy via the example, not just this example.  For the sake of<br/>\nargument, keep in mind you&#39;re going to have a system of 100,000 LOC.  Does<br/>\nadding mixed in methods scale on a large project?<br/>\n<br/>\nSide note: I think one thing worth pointing out is that any time someone on<br/>\nthis list sends us a method and asks &quot;How the hell do I test this?&quot; they<br/>\nobviously aren&#39;t doing TDD.  If they were, they wouldn&#39;t have gotten into<br/>\nthat situation in the first  place.  There are two broad categories of JUnit<br/>\nusers: the TDD and XP folks, and the others who use it as an API and tool<br/>\nfor testing Java, regardless of development methodology.  Has nothing to do<br/>\nwith this discussion except as a hint about this problem of &quot;testability&quot;<br/>\nand my reasons for thinking it should rarely, if ever, be represented as a<br/>\nmethod added *only* to make a class testable.  I will enumerate some of my<br/>\nreasons in the separate thread on &quot;Testability.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I disagree. Maybe it comes from seeing engineers design buildings and<br/>\n&gt; similar structures: it turns out that you design them not only so that<br/>\n&gt; they fulfill their intended function after you&#39;re done building them,<br/>\n&gt; but also so that they have good &quot;buildability.&quot; They&#39;ll add in stuff<br/>\n&gt; that has no relevance to the final function simply to make it faster,<br/>\n&gt; cheaper or easier to build. This was a pretty stunning concept to me<br/>\n&gt; when I first found out about it, because it was something I&#39;d never<br/>\n&gt; considered before.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Car and motherboard manufacturers do the same thing (Boris Beizer reminds<br/>\nme).  But I&#39;m still interested in the thought process behind testability and<br/>\nhow it impacts object oriented design.  We need some principles to guide us.<br/>\nI mean, hell, you could just as well add a main() method or a test() method<br/>\nto every class you want to test, but what kind of thinking process is that?<br/>\nIt&#39;s certainly not test *first*.  I&#39;ve seen this (the main() method idea)<br/>\nrecommended as a good idea (I think in the &#39;The Practical Programmer&#39;).<br/>\nObviously there are benefits to doing your tests in a framework like JUnit,<br/>\nbut there&#39;s more to it than just having an API and a test runner and<br/>\nreporting mechanism.  I&#39;m interested in making explicit the thinking that<br/>\nguides testability.  What is &quot;testability?&quot;  And what is &quot;maintainability?&quot;<br/>\nThey are similar kinds of things.  I am hoping they fall out of good design,<br/>\nbut have yet to prove it.<br/>\n<br/>\nScott Stirling</div>",
