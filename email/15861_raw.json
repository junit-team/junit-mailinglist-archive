Look at ALL the technical optinons and then judge them\n&gt; against risk/cost/ and so on. I just have seen too many times people propose\n&gt; the &quot;technical elegant solution&quot; which was not &quot;optimal from a business\n&gt; perspective&quot;.\n\nIndeed! This is a key point that goes well beyond programming. It \nassumes, for example, that we programmers are fiscally literate, such as \nable to read a financial statement.\n\nBy show of hands, how many of us can do that?\n\nI do, frequently, because I run businesses that have nothing to do with \nshipping software. Making a business-oriented judgment, such as &quot;just \nadd RAM&quot; is easy for me. I can see the whole picture, because I do so \ndaily. Even the very best programmers count among them some people who \ndon&#39;t know what &quot;COGS&quot; means.\n\nSo perhaps I was rash in saying that any decent consultant wouldn&#39;t tell \nhis client, &quot;just add RAM.&quot; I shouldn&#39;t assume that a software \nconsultant speaks business, although I would avoid hiring one that didn&#39;t.\n\nTake care.\n-- \nJ.
