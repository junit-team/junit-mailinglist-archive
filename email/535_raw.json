I also wrote simple example, showing the usage of assertFile\nfunctions.\n\nAs I needed more than just comparion of two files, I didn&#39;t think about the\nsimple\nassertFile(&quot;file1&quot;, :file2&quot;) function, but definitly it belongs there (and\nnow I added it).\nSo, please take updated version of this extension from appended ZIP archive,\ntry\nexample (its usage is described in readme.html) and/or read more info from\nJavaDocs.\n\nMaybe you will find some kinds of assertFile functions needless, I would like\nto\ndiscuss it in wider audience, because I think that file-diff capability\nsignificantly\nimproves the JUnit framework.\n\nAlso I would like to find better diff implementations written in Java, which\nwill produce\nresults in human readable form. The SimpleDiff doesn&#39;t produce output at all\nand the\nNativeDiff relies on the native application.\n\nAny other comments are more than welcomed.\n\nThank you,\nVita\n\n\nfaith@... wrote:\n\n&gt; Vitezslav,\n&gt;\n&gt; Thank-you for the JUnit file-diff extension.  The capability is\n&gt; exactly what I need.\n&gt;\n&gt; I am having a bit of a problem implementing it. If you could give me\n&gt; an short example, I would appreciate it. Here is an outline of what I\n&gt; have tried so far.\n&gt;\n&gt; In the original post you requested an assert that would take two file\n&gt; names and return a boolean. So, before reading .java files, I tried\n&gt; the following and was told that there were not enough arguments:\n&gt; assertFile(&quot;file1&quot;, &quot;file2&quot;);\n&gt;\n&gt; Then being stubborn I tried:\n&gt; assertFile(&quot;file1&quot;, &quot;file2&quot;, null);\n&gt;\n&gt; This ran fine, however, file1 and file2 did not exist.\n&gt;\n&gt; If you could provide an example of the diff parameter that needs to\n&gt; be passed, I would appreciate it. The html mentioned a\n&gt; junit.diff.SimpleDiff.  I would like to use this.  However, I cannot\n&gt; find it in the package.\n&gt;\n&gt; Once again, I would like to say that this is an excellent idea.  It\n&gt; would be nice to see the documentation expanded.\n&gt;\n&gt; Faith\n&gt;\n\r\n--------------92C3083E44FE54D9D0853AD5\r\nContent-Type: application/x-zip-compressed;\n name=&quot;junit-file-diff.zip&quot;\r\nContent-Disposition: inline;\n filename=&quot;junit-file-diff.zip&quot;\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n--------------92C3083E44FE54D9D0853AD5--\r\n\n",
