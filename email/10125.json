Overall it&#39;s been a pretty rewarding experience.  I<br/>\noften find myself scurrying to the bookstore (or google) to read up on<br/>\nvarious topics that come up.  Today I finally ran into something I<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t solve cleanly: how does one write tests for code that spawns<br/>\nthreads, where the threads can throw exceptions?  I&#39;m specifically<br/>\nlooking at the JMF library.  In many cases the caller of the code<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t have any direct access to the threads that are spawned. <br/>\nUnless I&#39;ve missed something it looks as if JUnit does not deal with<br/>\nthis situation.  What&#39;s a good strategy for dealing with this? <br/>\nThreadGroup might help some, but only in cases where I can get access<br/>\nto the spawned threads.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAny insights appreciated.</div>",
