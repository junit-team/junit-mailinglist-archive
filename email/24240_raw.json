I personal=\r\nly would find this useful. This is a reasonably\neasy change, but may take a=\r\n while to add because of the release cycle for\nEclipse.\n\nAlso, it is fairly=\r\n easy to put an extra command line parameter to JUnitCore\nto only run parti=\r\ncular categories, similarly to the maven plugin. If this\nis wanted, please =\r\nraise an issue/pull request.\n\nAs an aside, I can&#39;t remember the last time I=\r\n ran a set of tests from the\ncommand line directly (except for answering st=\r\nack overflow questions). I\nuse Eclipse, maven and rarely ant, but never the=\r\n command line. To explain,\nI always want my tests to be run as part of a bu=\r\nild, and I always build\njust before I commit, so I don&#39;t want the mental ov=\r\nerhead of having to run\nJUnit from the command line each time.\n\nA bit of ex=\r\nplanation. Apologies if this is obvious. We&#39;re talking about\nmultiple thing=\r\ns here. JUnit, maven surefire and the Eclipse JUnit plugin.\nJUnit, given a =\r\nlist of classes/tests, will execute the tests. Maven\nsurefire & the eclipse=\r\n plugin selects the list of classes/tests to test.\nJUnit supports categorie=\r\ns, as does maven surefire, but the Eclipse plugin\ndoes not, nor does the co=\r\nmmand line.\n\nSo, ignoring the class/string debate, would the following be a=\r\ncceptable for\nyou:\n\n1) Add a command line parameter to specify categories t=\r\no include/ignore\n(JUnitCore)\n2) Change the Eclipse (or IDE of choice) to sp=\r\necify categories to\ninclude/ignore\n\nAlso, there are moves afoot to add test=\r\n discovery directly to JUnit,\nthrough ClasspathSuite or similar, so the com=\r\nmand line option may be easier\nto use.\n\nThanks.\n\nMatthew Farwell.\n\n2013/1/2=\r\n4 Charlie Poole &lt;charliepoole@...&gt;\n\n&gt; **\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi All,\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ve been =\r\nholding my peace, since I figure you all don&#39;t particularly want\n&gt; a long\n&gt;=\r\n dissertation about another test framework, running in a different language=\r\n.\n&gt; However, Matthew&#39;s question seems to call for a clear answer so you can=\r\n\n&gt; figure out which way you want to go.\n&gt;\n&gt; On Wed, Jan 23, 2013 at 10:57 A=\r\nM, Matthew Farwell matthew@...\n&gt; &gt;wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; **\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; O=\r\nk. I&#39;m trying to understand what actually happens with NUnit. I mark a\n&gt; &gt; =\r\ntest as &quot;slow&quot;, and run all of the tests in my project. Are you saying\n&gt; th=\r\nat\n&gt; &gt; without selecting the category of tests to run, the IDE doesn&#39;t run =\r\nthe\n&gt; &gt; slow tests, that is it only runs tests which are not marked as slow=\r\n? If\n&gt; &gt; this is so, how does it know which are the slow tests?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; In NU=\r\nnit, I can mark a test as slow by annotating it [Category(&quot;Slow&quot;)].\n&gt; NUnit=\r\n\n&gt; has no idea what &quot;Slow&quot; means or what to do with it. It&#39;s just a tag. In=\r\n\n&gt; order\n&gt; to make use of the category I have to either specify it using a\n=\r\n&gt; command-line\n&gt; option or select it in the Categories window of the NUnit =\r\nGui. In either\n&gt; case,\n&gt; I can choose to run all tests or just some categor=\r\nies. I can also choose to\n&gt; exclude some categories. There&#39;s actually more =\r\nflexibility at the command\n&gt; line than in the Gui, since I can specify bool=\r\nean combinations of\n&gt; categories\n&gt; there like &quot;Data-Slow&quot;, which means run =\r\nall the Data category except those\n&gt; also marked as Slow.\n&gt;\n&gt; Here are diff=\r\nerences in the implementations, as I have observed them. It\n&gt; may\n&gt; not be =\r\ncomplete and could even be dead wrong in the case of JUnit, so\n&gt; please\n&gt; c=\r\norrect me if I&#39;m off base:\n&gt;\n&gt; 1. NUnit categories are strings. JUnit&#39;s are=\r\n classes.\n&gt; 2. NUnit controls what categories to execute at runtime, withou=\r\nt changing\n&gt; the code.\n&gt; JUnit requires changing the code or at least setti=\r\nng up suites for each of\n&gt; your commonly\n&gt; used categories in advance. I su=\r\nppose some IDEs may allow runtime selection\n&gt; of categories for JUnit.\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nThese two differences appear to be orthogonal.\n&gt;\n&gt; Regarding the first diff=\r\nerence: I once spent some time considering\n&gt; emulating\n&gt; JUnit and using a =\r\nType rather than a string to represent a category. Use of\n&gt; a\n&gt; Type (class=\r\n) is more sophisticated and appealed to me at first. In the end,\n&gt; I\n&gt; coul=\r\ndn&#39;t really point to an solid advantage to the user, so we still use\n&gt; stri=\r\nngs.\n&gt;\n&gt; Regarding the second difference: Runtime category selection is som=\r\nething\n&gt; NUnit users wouldn&#39;t want to do without these days. There seems to=\r\n be no\n&gt; obstacle to allowing it in JUnit while retaining the ability to de=\r\nfine\n&gt; suites as now.\n&gt; That&#39;s what I would do...\n&gt;\n&gt; Charlie\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-te=\r\nxt portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n[Non-text portions=\r\n of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
