Actually\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; [...] if a method has advertised\n&gt; &gt; an exception in its throws clause, a caller can anticipate that it\n&gt; &gt; could happen, catch it, and call the outcome a failure.\n&gt;\n&gt; I think Java&#39;s checked exceptions are evil, so I don&#39;t bother. If it ain&#39;t\n&gt; the right exception, then the production code is barfing. Barfing is an\n&gt; error -- different from, say, answering 10 instead of 8.\nwhat about mixed language environment? I mean CORBA / Java or something like\nthis... CORBA exceptions should be proccessed in Java, catched.... so I\nthink checked exceptions are better, they AWARE programmers of majority of\npossible exception. They are part of method contracts. I FLAME :+)\n&gt;\n&gt; (For those interested in arguing about checked exceptions, first please\nread\n&gt; http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?CheckedExceptionsAreOfDubiousValue.)\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; [...]  any other\n&gt; &gt; &quot;unanticipated&quot; exception would then be an error.  but in practice,\n&gt; &gt; it probably doesn&#39;t matter whether the throwing of the wrong\n&gt; &gt; &quot;advertised&quot; exception should signal failure or error.\n&gt;\n&gt; Indeed. It may be impossible to tell, or at least too much work to tell,\n&gt; whether the problem was within or outside of your control. Better to hedge\n&gt; your bets unless you have a good reason to do otherwise. Cheaper, you\nknow.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; i was trying to use the exception example as a starting point for\n&gt; &gt; discussion about whether failure/error distinctions in junit are\n&gt; &gt; meaningful to anyone.  my experience has been that they are not--\n&gt; &gt; in either case, failure or error, you&#39;re led in the direction of a\n&gt; &gt; solution.  what do you all think?\n&gt;\n&gt; It depends on the context. When the code I&#39;m testing does not throw its\nown\n&gt; exceptions, then an error is almost always either a bug in the test or a\nnon-\n&gt; recoverable problem. When the code I&#39;m testing throws its own exceptions,\n&gt; then an error could be a bunch of different things. I suppose that, in a\n&gt; narrow context, errors are useful, but I don&#39;t really distinguish. The\nnice\n&gt; thing about errors, though, is that they prompt me to look beyond my code\nand\n&gt; my test for the problem. Maybe the disk is full. Maybe the network is\ndown.\n&gt; Maybe there&#39;s an eclipse of the sun. An error often makes me think harder\n&gt; about where the problem might be. That&#39;s usually good.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; this, too, the failure/error distinction and whether it matters, may\n&gt; &gt; be a good FAQ item too?\n&gt;\n&gt; Mike?\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt; J. B.
