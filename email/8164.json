Getting in the habit of creating our own<br/>\n&gt; suite, can lead to order dependancies since you&#39;re setting the test<br/>\n&gt; order explicitly.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Dave<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>For a simple case like he was writing (to which I was referring), you<br/>\ndon&#39;t need it.  True.  However, on larger projects I think the having<br/>\nTestSuites is very essential.  For instance, on my current gig we have<br/>\nwritten over 1900 test fixtures.  They include typical unit tests,<br/>\nfunctional tests, and integration tests.  All of the tests further break<br/>\ndown via sub-systems, the type of functionality, etc.  All of these tests<br/>\nare run before code is checked in (and often at other times), but there<br/>\nare plenty of times when I am only interested in running a subset of<br/>\ntests (one or two suites).  It provides quicker feedback since the suite<br/>\nincluding all tests takes approx. 300 seconds to run (which is much<br/>\nbetter than the 800 seconds it used to take :).<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\n=jason<br/>\n[:question | ^One]</div>",
