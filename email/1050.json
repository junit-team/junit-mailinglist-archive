(I haven&#39;t used the cvs task - we <br/>\nhave Source Safe here, but I don&#39;t suppose that it&#39;s too difficult to set up.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re using a database, as you almost certainly are, things get more <br/>\ncomplicated ;) Some possible options:<br/>\n* Someone here (I forget who) posted a &quot;MockResultSet&quot; class that can be <br/>\nused to fake database results - I think it&#39;s available on the Yahoo groups <br/>\nweb page somewhere.<br/>\n* You could set up a script (also executed by ant?) that creates some fake <br/>\ntables in your database and populates them with data, which you could then <br/>\ntest against. (You have got a test database, right?) Once the tests have <br/>\nbeen run, you could then execute a seperate script to clean up.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf anyone has any other suggestions I&#39;d love to hear them - this is a <br/>\nproblem that I&#39;ve come up against more than once...<br/>\n<br/>\n(If you decide to use ant, and are not sure how to use it, feel free to <br/>\nmail me).<br/>\n<br/>\nHTH,<br/>\nJim<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\n<br/>\n                           *   Jim Cheesman   *<br/>\n             Trabajo: <br/>\njchees@... - (34)(91) 724 9200 x 2360<br/>\n               Personal: <br/>\nmogrim@...
