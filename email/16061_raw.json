We went around on this. It seems there\nare two\n=\r\n&gt; cases:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) I am throwing an exception but I want to make it more spec=\r\nific so\nI throw\n&gt; a subclass (Exception -&gt; IllegalArgumentException). No ca=\r\ntch clauses\ncare\n&gt; about the more-specific exception. If expected is lookin=\r\ng for a precise\n&gt; class, a bunch of tests will break even though the code s=\r\ntill works.\n\nI&#39;ve never seen an api that says &quot;when you do X, we will throw=\r\n a\nrandom type of exception (though it will derive from Y)&quot;\n\nAnd if this is=\r\n a common case, what about the case &quot;We can throw either\nan IllegalArgument=\r\nException or a FileNotFoundException but nothing\nelse&quot;. I think cases like =\r\n#1 will still need to be done with the\nmanual patern (this is what NUnit pi=\r\noneered with their expected\nexception stuff, so I&#39;d tend to agree with thei=\r\nr choice).\n \n&gt; Either way you&#39;re going to get false results. One question i=\r\ns which\nscenario\n&gt; is more common? Another is which scenario is more\ndanger=\r\nous/risky/expensive?\n\nI&#39;d argue that case 2 is much more common.\n\n-- Ben\n\n\n=\r\n\n\n",
