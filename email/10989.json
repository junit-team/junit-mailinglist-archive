    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-112230143\">There is an old guideline from procedural programming days (sorry I don&#39;t remember the original source) that says that the number of tests should be &gt;= the cyclomatic complexity of a function.  (There are many texts on cyclomatic complexity but in short it&#39;s basically the number of loops/branches in a method + 1.)  <br/>\n<br/>\nThat is, a function with no branches can be covered in one test, with a single branch you need two tests (true path and false path) and so on.  For loops, consider the case of &quot;loop entered&quot; vs &quot;loop never entered&quot;.  The basic idea is that this should give you more or less 100% coverage by most metrics, and without basic coverage you can&#39;t have fully tested a method.  (The reverse is not true; you can have 100% coverage without fully testing.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as I know, the science behind code coverage hasn&#39;t quite caught up to the world of exceptions and objects: stack unwinding and polymorphism add all kinds of hidden branches so in many cases the complexity is a gross underestimate.  On the other hand, as Mr. Chappell mentioned, a single method may often be too small a unit to properly test.  On the whole though, I think getting code coverage is a good goal and a measurable one, and complexity is often a fair enough estimate while you are writing tests.<br/>\n<br/>\nScott<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Girish Patil <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Sunday, May 09, 2004 1:34 AM<br/>\n  Subject: [junit] JUnit GuideLines<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Hi<br/>\n  This is regarding the JUnit Test classes <br/>\n  Is there any guidline available for How many test<br/>\n  classes/test methods one should write for Testing<br/>\n  methods<br/>\n  For EG <br/>\n  For method <br/>\n  myMethod(String st1,Object ob1,Object ob1){<br/>\n  ..<br/>\n  }<br/>\n<br/>\n  I can write test methods with Different combinations<br/>\n  like passing null string ,valid string ,null object<br/>\n  ob1<br/>\n  etc...<br/>\n<br/>\n  is there any guideline on this ?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Regards<br/>\n  Girish<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        <br/>\n              <br/>\n  __________________________________<br/>\n  Do you Yahoo!?<br/>\n  Win a $20,000 Career Makeover at Yahoo!
