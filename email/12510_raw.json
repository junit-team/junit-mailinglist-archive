Some people recommended to\n&gt; have a new vm for each test so that a tested class does not depends\n&gt; on the ant environment, what does that actually mean? Can someone\n&gt; pleas explain? I recently changed the forkmode=&quot;once&quot; in my ant and\n&gt; hope that it would speed up the build, but somehow a few UTs got\n&gt; NullPointerExceptions on certain objects when they are not supposed\n&gt; to. And it seems like it has something to do with delegation. Can\n&gt; someone help me clarify this?\n\nIf you need tests to run in separate class loaders or separate VMs, \nbecause of reliance on global data of any kind, then you can fork per \ntest. Any singletons that your tests try to reinitialize might not \nproperly work if you run all tests in the same VM.\n\nThat said, if your tests can&#39;t run in the same VM, then you might have a \ndesign problem (reliance on global data) that you should try to solve. \nWell-isolated tests, for the most part, don&#39;t need to reload classes to \nwork.\n-- \nJ.
