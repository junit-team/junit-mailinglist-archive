I came\nacross the MoneyBag class containing the appendMoney method. When it\nsays an internal helper method, I assume it is upto the programmer to\nimplement it? I wrote something like this:\n\nvoid appendMoney(Money m){\n        fMonies.add(m);\n    }\n\nIs this what it was supposed to be?\n\nthanks,\nAshu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
