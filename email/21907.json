    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-214435670\">I&#39;ve been playing a bit with Test Driven Development, and have read the book, but now I want to try it out, and am really not sure what to do next...<br/>\n<br/>\nMy wife loves to show photo slide shows on our living room windows-XP computer (have patience, it will come together), but she doesn&#39;t like that the pictures show up in order.  I want to write a small utility to rename the pictures in a controllable way, but prefixing something like <br/>\n&quot;RND&quot;, a set of random digits, and the original name.  For example, if the original was DCIM1001.jpg, I want the class to rename the file to &quot;RND4356332_DCIM1001.jpg&quot;.  Windows can then show the photos in a &#39;random&#39; order, but I can still figure out the real photo name, in case someone wants a copy.  Sounds simple.<br/>\n<br/>\nI want to build this, using TDD.<br/>\nI figure that I need to build tests, and get green bars in eclipse in the following order:<br/>\n-instantiate my photoRandomizer class<br/>\n-pass it several different paths, and have them be validated (null, empty, non-existing, very long, very short, etc...).<br/>\n<br/>\nthat was easy.<br/>\nbut my next question, is now what?<br/>\nIf I was writing this without TDD, my next step, would have been to iterate through the directory, and rename all of the files according to my scheme.  I can&#39;t see an operational advantage to exposing any of this to outside, or make it more than one method, for testing purposes.<br/>\n<br/>\nmaybe what I should do, is have a method that iterates through the appropriate directory, generates a random number, and then passes both pieces of information to another method which renames the target file.  This doesn&#39;t seem like a very good way to do it, but then I would at least be able to test the renaming.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat am I missing?</div>",
