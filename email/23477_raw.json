There are quite many different reasons for having a\n&gt; s=\r\nkipped/ignored/pending test, and also with some testing frameworks they\n&gt; a=\r\nre marked pending during the execution of the test (e.g. ScalaTest&#39;s\n&gt; pend=\r\ningUntilFixed) whereas some mark them before executing any test code\n&gt; (e.g=\r\n. JUnit&#39;s @Ignore).\n&gt;\n&gt;\nI think this is where my idea was different. I plan=\r\nned to delegate the\nrunning completely to other frameworks and just be flex=\r\nible about what they\ncan report back. So it becomes more of a presentation-=\r\nissue (it seems to me\nthat you are also focusing on running the tests, espe=\r\ncially being clever\nabout ordering the run sequence for high probability of=\r\n catching failing\ntests fast).\nBeing the requester for pending until fixed =\r\nin scalatest I often miss the\nexplicit pending in test-frameworks. The insp=\r\niration here is rspec. As you\nsay, the difference between pending in this s=\r\nense and just ignoring is that\npending tests are run anyway but failures do=\r\n not give a &quot;red bar&quot; since they\nare expected, it works well for &quot;mockless =\r\nto down&quot; where you can flesh out\ntests from the top and pend until you can =\r\nget something working. Once one of\nyour initial tests work they change stat=\r\nus from pending to fixed (or in\nscalatest, fail because a successful test i=\r\ns marked as pending)\n\nIt also looks very promising with focus on performanc=\r\ne. Have you looked into\nincremental running al=E1 SBT or is that left to to=\r\nols like SBT?\n\nI&#39;m watching your repo now, got a bit tempted to support Jum=\r\ni in poju4s (but\nfirst change the name of that project).\n\n/J\n\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt; Esko=\r\n Luontola\n&gt; www.orfjackal.net\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message =\r\nhave been removed]\n\n\n",
