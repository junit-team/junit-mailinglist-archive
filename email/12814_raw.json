Rainsberger&quot; &lt;jbrains@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; |&gt;\n&gt; |&gt;  &gt;\n&gt; |&gt;  &gt; To solve the problem, testFindAll() should set up\n&gt; |&gt;  &gt; the data it needs in\n&gt; |&gt;  &gt; the database, so that it controls the expected\n&gt; |&gt;  &gt; outcome. This is an\n&gt; |&gt;  &gt; important trait of any good test, and not just tests\n&gt; |&gt;  &gt; that use a database.\n&gt; |&gt;\n&gt; |&gt; I preface this question with &quot;I know very little about\n&gt; |&gt; EJB&#39;s&quot;\n&gt; |&gt;\n&gt; |&gt; Is it possible to implement the findAll logic in a\n&gt; |&gt; POJO which is then easier to test?  Or is the code\n&gt; |&gt; likely to be just a call to an EJB API?\n&gt; |\n&gt; | It&#39;s certainly possible. Typically all one needs to do is pass in the\n&gt; | DataSource or Connection to the POJO and off you go.\n&gt; |\n&gt; \n&gt; This in case you are doing BMP and not CMP. You must correctly evaluate \n&gt; the costs on this option.\n\nOf course, Alex is right. With CMP there is no real value in trying to \ntest outside the container. As I wrote in _JUnit Recipes_, you might as \nwell run those tests against a live database, but run them less \nfrequently than the rest. Put them in a separate test suite and run them \nin the background with CruiseControl. Otherwise, only run them if you \nthink you&#39;ve changed something that might make them fail.\n\nAnd, as always, when you don&#39;t run all the tests all the time, proceed \nwith caution.\n-- \nJ.
