The actual shows up as how I wanted and that \nis correct if I were to verify it manually. The expected part is \ncoming out corrupted causing my test to fail. I can run the program \napplication itself VIA command prompt.  It has one functionality \nthat outputs whatever is in a textfile you specify. I then used my \n&quot;Expected Values.in&quot; file and it output correctly in command prompt. \n\nI think there are some gritty issues in J-Unit. I remember using J-\nUnit with the UI via command prompt, but after coming across Eclipse \n(making it so much easier to run), I forgot how to do so.  Does \nanyone remember how to? It will tell me whether or not Eclipse is a \npart of this issue.\n\nMy assert looks like this:\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, David Saff &lt;saff@m...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; speedracer,\n&gt; \n&gt; Do you expect these tests to fail (with non-corrupted data), or do \nyou \n&gt; expect them to pass, but the corruption causes them to fail?  If \nthe \n&gt; second, it&#39;s very unlikely that Eclipse is to blame.  You might \nwant to \n&gt; take Eclipse and JUnit out of the picture by writing a small \nprogram \n&gt; whose main procedure reads your input.in files and prints them out \nto \n&gt; the console, or compares them to literal unicode strings.  If that \n&gt; program works as expected, then perhaps the gremlins are hiding in \n&gt; Eclipse or JUnit--let us know.\n&gt; \n&gt;     David Saff\n&gt; \n&gt; speedracer1548 wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hi,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve been interested in using J-unit for globalization testing. I\n&gt; &gt; have used J-Unit before, but never in this way.  I want to use J-\nUnit\n&gt; &gt; to verify Japanese characters in resource bundles.  I am using \nEclipse\n&gt; &gt; to run J-Unit.  I am also using input.in files to use as \nthe &quot;Expected&quot;\n&gt; &gt; Data.  I correctly grab the &quot;Actual&quot; data as Eclispe shows me \nthis,\n&gt; &gt; but the &quot;Expected&quot; data comes out corrupted.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; For those of you who know locale region settings, I am in \nJapanese in\n&gt; &gt; all of them and my input.in file correctly displays Japanese\n&gt; &gt; characters, the only problem I&#39;m facing is with J-Unit. See the\n&gt; &gt; attached screenshot for clarification. The SS shows the input \nfile\n&gt; &gt; with &quot;Expected&quot; data, and also shows the character corruption \nfrom\n&gt; &gt; Eclipse.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Is this problem related to J-Unit or Eclipse, or something else?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \nhttp://img400.imageshack.us/img400/1391/junitcharcorruption1zf.jpg\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; -----------------------------------------------------------------\n-------\n&gt; &gt; YAHOO!
