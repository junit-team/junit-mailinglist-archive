I wonder if there&#39;s a lot we could learn about the<br/>\n&gt; cost/benefit analysis of cleverness.  I think that the strongest claim<br/>\n&gt; we could probably agree on is that we&#39;re most likely to win if each<br/>\n&gt; person that learns the metaphor ends up using it thousands of times<br/>\n&gt; regularly, rather than a handful of times separated by months on end.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I can buy that.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It sounds like this is a question you should address to those JUnit<br/>\n&gt; users.  Did they give you concrete feedback, or simply &quot;Nope, don&#39;t like<br/>\n&gt; it&quot;, or was there another design that enthralled them?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t recall exactly, but it feels like they simply said, &quot;Reflection? <br/>\nEww.&quot; That&#39;s what I don&#39;t get. It&#39;s a visceral reaction--that&#39;s <br/>\nfine--but I wouldn&#39;t expect that from seasoned JUnit users, since it&#39;s a <br/>\ndesign they know and use.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
