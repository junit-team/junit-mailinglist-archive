I also don&#39;t necessarily agree that having a negative \n&gt; value =\r\nfor &#39;score&#39; is cause for an exception--it depends where the\nsystem \n&gt; bound=\r\naries are.\n\nIn this case &quot;points&quot; was the count of JUnit or Agitator assert=\r\nions --\nnegative values were non-sensical.\n\nAnd I&#39;m not sure checking the e=\r\nxception message in my test is a\nquestion of design at all, but out of curi=\r\nousity, how do you TDD\nthrowing an exception?\n\n&gt; Finally, I should mention =\r\nthat this is not the kind of design problem I \n&gt; have in mind when I made m=\r\ny admittedly baseless claim. Since it was \n&gt; baseless, I should revise my c=\r\nlaim. Here it is:\n&gt; \n&gt;      When I write JUnit tests, I am forced to deal w=\r\nith dependency\n&gt;      problems in my code. I don&#39;t yet have any evidence th=\r\nat Agitator\n&gt;      would help me with that. I am concerned that since Agita=\r\ntor helps\n&gt;      me /not/ write JUnit tests, it might also help me /not/ fe=\r\nel the\n&gt;      pain of those kinds of dependency problems.\n&gt; \n\nI think it is=\r\n a reasonable concern but not something to fear in\npractice. I don&#39;t think =\r\nI&#39;ve ever worked with a customer where I\nhaven&#39;t pointed to the screen and =\r\nsaid something about dependency\ninjection.\n\nfwiw about the only JUnit tests=\r\n that I haven&#39;t written becuase of\nAgitator are the ones I would have writt=\r\nen to fix the bugs that would\nhave otherwise have been reported.  :)\n\nJtf\n\n=\r\n\n\n\n\n\n",
