If you have general <br/>\nquestions about a topic, then go to http://www.google.com, enter a few <br/>\nkeywords, press the big Search button and look through a few relavent <br/>\nlinks. Download tutorials and software, install, and try things out.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you have tried a few things out and have some specific questions, <br/>\nsuch as &quot;why doesn&#39;t this work?&quot; or &quot;what am I doing wrong here?&quot;, then <br/>\npost them here to the mailing list, where I&#39;m sure that /someone/ (and <br/>\npossibly me, depending on whether I have time at that moment) will answer.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are looking to hire a consultant to help your company adopt JUnit <br/>\nand testing-oriented practices, then by all means, please visit the <br/>\nDiaspar Software web site, the URL for which is in every message I <br/>\nwrite. If you are looking for free help, then go to the mailing lists, <br/>\nand not directly to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you for your time.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
