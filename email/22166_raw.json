I think there are a few articles out there that frown against it.  No one likes dealing with the class loader if they don&#39;t have to.\n\nHowever, using system properties in something like object construction is a good idea.  (In my opinion.)  In fact I like it soo much I&#39;m going to blog about it.  But my first rough draft has the template you need.  (It is currently the second code snippet.)  The idea is to save the system properties in a before method and restore in an after method.  Then set the property you want to change before constructing the object.  In your case it would be before loading the class.\n\nI&#39;m leaving the class loading issues as an exercise for the reader.  (Cause I don&#39;t want to touch that.)\n\nhttp://bigmikef.blogspot.com/2009/12/using-system-properties-in-test.html\n\nP.S.

The number of classes I&#39;d like\n&gt; to test this way is quite large. I think having lots of different test\n&gt; suites would quickly become unmanageable.\n&gt;\n&gt; If I need to build this capability myself, would building my own custom\n&gt; Runner be the right approach? If so, is there some documentation on how\n&gt; to write a custom Runner? Or do I just need to read the code?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; yme0987654321 wrote on 12/10/2009 08:23 PM:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The way I would handle this is to inject the relevant properties via a\n&gt; &gt; properties object, and then in production pass System.getProperties(),\n&gt; &gt; that way the tests are not coupled to the nasty global which is the\n&gt; &gt; System property.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If that isn&#39;t an option for some reason, perhaps you can organize your\n&gt; &gt; different tests into suites, and set the system property in a\n&gt; &gt; @BeforeClass method on the suite?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yishai\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In junit@yahoogroups.com&lt;mailto:junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt; &lt;mailto:junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt;, Bill\n&gt; &gt; Shannon &lt;Bill.Shannon@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;ve read the FAQ and the javadocs and done much web searching but\n&gt; &gt; can&#39;t find\n&gt; &gt; &gt; an answer to this. Sorry if this is stupid question.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I need to write a test case that tests a class whose behavior depends on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a System property. The class reads the System property at class\n&gt; &gt; initialization\n&gt; &gt; &gt; time. I&#39;d like to have multiple test cases, each of which sets a\n&gt; &gt; different\n&gt; &gt; &gt; value for the System property, so each of the tests needs to be run in a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; separate JVM or possibly a separate ClassLoader.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Is there a simple way to (e.g.) annotate my test case to cause JUnit to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; handle this for me?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m invoking JUnit as part of a maven build. Note that I don&#39;t want to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; run *all* of my JUnit tests in a single separate JVM, I want to run\n&gt; &gt; &gt; certain test cases each in their own separate JVM (or ClassLoader).\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If I have to start a new JVM or create a new ClassLoader myself, what&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the best way to initialize the CLASSPATH and find the class to be tested\n&gt; &gt; &gt; from within a JUnit test case running under maven?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
