Let me \ngo into a little bit more detail on each and let me know if there are \nfurther questions.\n\n1. Automatic White-Box Testing:  Jtest analyzes the structure of the \nclass under test then automatically generates test cases in order to \nexercise each method as fully as possible.  Out of the box, there is \nno way for the tool to know exactly what the intended logic of the \nmethod is, but, we determine all the paths of execution that can be \ntaken by a method and automatically generate test cases to force that \nexecution.  By doing so, we are generating a large suite of test \ncases that are ensuring the code is robust and not throwing any \nuncaught runtime exceptions, as well as building a suite of tests \nwhich can be used for regression testing.  As a side note, these \ntests JTest generates can be exported into JUnit test classes.\n\n2: Black Box Testing:  Jtest provides several ways to help speed up \nblack box testing as much as possible.  One way to define your own \ntests is by specifying simple values directly in the JTest UI.  The \nsecond is through JTest&#39;s generation of JUnit test classes.  You can \ntake the test classes Jtest automatically generates and extend upon \nthem to define the logic of the code.  Lastly, Jtest can \nautomatically generate a test case template including a corresponding \ntestXXX () method, as well as a setUp () and tearDown () method for \nevery method in your class.  These testXXX () methods will contain an \nempty test with a &quot;fail&quot; statement that can be replaced with your \nactual test code.\n\n3. Design By Contract:  Design by ContractTM (DbC) is a formal way of \nusing comments to incorporate specification information into the code \nitself. Jtest uses the DbC specification information to automatically \ncreate and execute test cases that verify whether a class or \ncomponent functions as its DbC specification says it should function. \nWhen you test a class or component with Jtest, Jtest automatically \ncreates and executes black-box test cases as part of its normal \nbattery of tests. Jtest designs its black-box test cases as follows: \n\n*If the code has postconditions, Jtest creates test cases that verify \nwhether the code satisfies those conditions. \n\n*If the code has assert conditions, Jtest creates test cases that try \nto make the assertions fail. \n\n*If the code has invariant conditions, Jtest creates test cases that \ntry to make the invariant conditions fail. \n\n*If the code has preconditions, Jtest tries to find inputs that force \nall of the paths in the preconditions. \n\n*If the method under test calls other methods that have specified \npreconditions, Jtest determines if the method under test can pass non-\npermissible values to the other methods. \n\n4. Coding Standards:  Since this was brought up in the post, I \nthought I&#39;d clarify what Jtest adds here.  Jtest does not generate \ntest cases to check Coding Standards, but it actually parses the \nsource code of the .java file and compares it to a list of industry \nguidelines built-in to the tool or any custom rules your group \ndefines.  There are currently 326 built in standards and this feature \nis highly customizable.\n\n\nI hope the above information was enough to help you understand what \nJtest is actually doing and where it adds value.

It automatically tests \nfor coding\n&gt; standard violations and potentially unhandled exceptions. So to \ntest if your\n&gt; classes actually work properly (provide services correctly) you&#39;ll \nhave to\n&gt; write tests.\n&gt; \n&gt; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n&gt; Mike Silverstein\n&gt; SilverMark, Inc.\n&gt; The object testing company\n&gt; http://www.javatesting.com\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; &gt; From: james.dobson@c...
