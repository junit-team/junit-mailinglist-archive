Your facts are not coordinated.\n\nLet me re-interpret, in the interest of moving this discussion along, \nbecause I find it useful.\n\nMost of the software out there is (1) only tested by customer use and \n(2) seems to work well enough to satisfy the customers.\n\nI can agree with this; however, I will point out that our industry has \ndone a good job over the past two decades (that I&#39;ve seen) of training \nusers to expect less from us, by virtue of the crap we put out there.\n\nHere&#39;s a simple example. I want a WYSIWYG HTML editor to write weblog \nentries. All I need to do is write the weblog entry, then switch to the \n&quot;Source&quot; view, then copy the contents into my weblog entry form. I have \ntried four different HTML editors for the Mac before I found one that \ndidn&#39;t suck. Mostly, here is how they have sucked:\n\n  * One of them wouldn&#39;t insert a new &lt;p&gt; tag when I pressed ENTER; it \nwould assume I meant &lt;br&gt;\n  * One of them would insert a bunch of &lt;br&gt; tags in my code samples \n(surrounding by &lt;pre&gt; tags), which doesn&#39;t actually work properly in all \nbrowsers\n  * Two of them didn&#39;t do WYSIWYG even remotely well.\n  * One of them inserted &nbsp; instead of regular spaces inside &lt;pre&gt; tags\n\nAll these products probably have loyal followings--dozens, hundreds, \neven thousands of users--and yet they have simple, silly problems that \nwould easily have been fixed by the slightest amount of attention to \nadhering to the HTML standard. The tests don&#39;t get any easier than that.\n\nSo we, as a user community, don&#39;t demand enough of software teams. If we \ndemanded more, programmers would have little choice but to test more.\n\nIt&#39;s an open question to me whether that day will ever come, but I have \nfound that TDD makes me so faster, not slower, so I get to market sooner \neither way.\n\nTake care.\n-- \nJ.
