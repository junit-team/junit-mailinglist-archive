Only subclasses in the same package would have\naccess.\n\nIf you wanted to be *really* sure it wasn&#39;t subclassed, of course, you\ncan declare it final, but that certainly doesn&#39;t solve the general case\nof your question.\n\nLastly, I wouldn&#39;t say that this suggestion is a particularly elegant\nsolution, and I could certainly be convinced that there&#39;s a better\napproach.\n\n\n$.02\n\nKevin\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nNew DSL Internet Access from SBC & Yahoo!\nhttp://sbc.yahoo.com\n\n\n",
