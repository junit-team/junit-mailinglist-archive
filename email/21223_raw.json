If somebody\nwants to contribute it would still be possible to use the maillist or\nget in direct contact with a developer.\n\n&gt; Does anyone know for sure if there&#39;s a hosting solution that scores 100% on\n&gt; Worldwide Access?\n\nI don&#39;t know any but I would look for a european hosted one. That way you\nshould be able to get around US-specific export restrictions.\n\n&gt; Does anyone know what the restrictions involve? (I\n&gt; wonder if it&#39;s something to do with SSL connections from countries to which,\n&gt; theoretically, you can&#39;t export SSL-enabling technology, or couldn&#39;t at one\n&gt; point--I&#39;m very rusty on this).\n\nI&#39;d have to check the SSL-handshake with sourceforge but I assume that\nthe server is not offering weak cryptography for establishing a SSL-\nconnection. Not the SSL-technology as such is restricted but the\n&quot;strongness&quot;. You&#39;re only allowed to export/use weak cryptography\nlike RSA-keys with AFAIR 368 bits or symmetric keys with AFAIR 40 bits.\n\nI&#39;m not sure if these numbers changed in these days (the last time\nI was interested in that was 10 years ago), but if you allow a server\nto do these kind of &quot;secure&quot; connections nowerdays you might give\nother users using a wrong version of a browser a wrong sense of\nsecurity, so many server only allow unrestricted cryptography\nfor the establishment of SSL-connections.\n\n&gt; It appears that if we allow browsing the documentation and downloading\n&gt; through junit.org, and other services through Google Code, we&#39;d be offering\n&gt; the same level of worldwide access we are now. Is that true?\n\nThe browsing of the source at sourceforge is possible without SSL,\nso it would be a step back.\n\n\nRegards, Lothar\n\n",
