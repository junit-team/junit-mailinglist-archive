Don&#39;t test protected and \n  package-protected methods.<br><br>A quote from the XP discussion group.<br>(<a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://208.48.218.9/group/extremeprogramming/message/13213)\">http://208.48.218.9/group/extremeprogramming/message/13213)</a><br><br>&quot;I \n  actually do think that it is cut and dried. Public members have a<br>behavior \n  that is expected of them by their clients. Tests can be used to<br>define that \n  behavior and demonstrate that a particular method exhibits it.<br>Private \n  methods are, by definition, implementation details. Their behavior<br>can vary \n  freely so long as the public methods don&#39;t break. Put another way:<br>if every \n  public method has been proven to behave correctly then the class<br>has been \n  proven to be bug free. Therefore, there is never a need to test<br>the private \n  members of a class.&quot;<br><br>So can you avoid testing them? If so, then don&#39;t; \n  if not, then you can&#39;t<br>have it both ways: either the tests are in the class \n  (to test private<br>methods),<br>in the package (to test protected/package \n  methods) or you can&#39;t test those<br>methods. There&#39;s no magic \n  here...<br><br>Good luck,<br><br>J. B.
