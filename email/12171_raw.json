The answer that I received\n&gt; was to use a decorator. It works this way. But I cannot execute a\n&gt; test with its decorator in Eclipse. So I cannot use it.\n\nI strongly disagree. Certainly you can. Read on.\n\n&gt; I&#39;ve coded something like this in the main method to solve the\n&gt; problem:\n&gt; TestDecorator myTestSetup = new MyTestSetup(new SupplierArticleTest\n&gt; (&quot;testInitialValidation&quot;));\n&gt; junit.textui.TestRunner.run(myTestSetup);\n\nWhat you&#39;re doing here defeats the purpose of one-time setup/teardown. \nUsually, one does this:\n\npublic class DecoratedTestSuite {\n     public static Test suite() {\n         return new MyTestSetup(new TestSuite(TestCaseToDecorate.class));\n     }\n}\n\nNow MyTestSetup.setUp() executes, then all the tests in \nTestCaseToDecorator, followed at last by MyTestSetup.tearDown(). Is this \nwhat you want?\n\nIf so, then you should be able to right-click DecoratedTestSuite in \nEclipse and run it as JUnit tests, because it has a suite() method.\n\n&lt;pause /&gt;\n\nI just tried it, and it works.\n\n&gt; The most straightforward thing would have been if I had two\n&gt; additional methods in the TestCase: setUpTestCase() and\n&gt; tearDownTestCase(). Both would be called only once, the first, when\n&gt; the test (all test methods in a TestCase) starts and the last when\n&gt; the test ends (all test methods in a TestCase).\n\nThat&#39;s exactly what TestSetup already does, so there&#39;s no need to add \nthat behavior to TestCase.\n-- \nJ.
