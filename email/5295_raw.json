B. Rainsberger [mailto:jbr@...]\n...\n&gt; &gt;...\n&gt; &gt; (How can a test show that the caller is responsible for not \n&gt; &gt; passing in a null pointer?\n&gt; \n&gt; I do this by *not* testing that I can handle the null \n&gt; pointer. The absence of \n&gt; a test indicates &quot;undefined behavior&quot; and you shouldn&#39;t rely \n&gt; on undefined \n&gt; behavior. \n\nHow can the absence of a test specify anything reliably?  (How does \nthe user know that you&#39;re trying to say that the behavior is undefined \nand that you didn&#39;t just forget to test that case?)\n\n\n&gt; &gt; Because tests, being code, can&#39;t relate code to external concepts.  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; (A specification can say that a function f returns the mathematical\n&gt; &gt; sum of two given integers subject to the limitations of 32-bit\n&gt; &gt; signed binary arithmetic.  How can a test say something like that?)\n&gt; \n&gt; I would think that the name of the method says it, \n\nThen you completely missed the example I just gave.  Note the number\nof terms necessary to define the behavior of the function.  Would you \never name a function with that level of precision or description?  \n(Don&#39;t use that exact example, since 32-bit binary values are already \ndefined in Java.)\n\n&gt; \n&gt; I, for one, would be very interested to see Sun&#39;s servlet API \n&gt; described in a \n&gt; test suite.\n\nI would hate to see _only_ a test suite.\n\nYou know, this makes me think of things like Ada and some network\nprotocols, which have a detailed specification _and_ a test suite.\n\nHaving just the test suite would be a horrible way to learn Ada or a\nprotocol enough to implement it, or even just to use it.\n\n(Actually, doesn&#39;t Sun have a J2EE test suite?)\n\n\nDaniel\n\n\n",
