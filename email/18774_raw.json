I=\r\n highly recommend\n&gt; downloading an IDE that has built in support for JUnit =\r\n(e.g. \nEclipse,\n&gt; NetBeans - both of which are free).\n&gt; \n&gt; A good IDE not o=\r\nnly makes JUnit running and reporting very easy, \n&gt; it also makes writing t=\r\nhe tests themselves and refactoring code \n&gt; a piece of cake.\n&gt; \n&gt; Alberto\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.junitfactory.com\n&gt; Generate JUnit tests.
