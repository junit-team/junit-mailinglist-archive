Then makes it as simple<br/>\nas possible for the users / solution recipients to<br/>\nvalidate the system.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m going to summarize the thread in a little apache<br/>\nlicensed eclipse documentation plugin just elaborating<br/>\non the enumeration methodology, etc. discussed in the<br/>\nthread.  I&#39;ll  post back when it&#39;s done.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW - Thanks a gazillion (To Eric as as well) for<br/>\nwriting &quot;Contributing to Eclipse&quot; and JUnit.  I think<br/>\ncalling it &quot;Briliant work&quot; would be an understatement.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\n- Ole<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Kent Beck &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kentb@...\">kentb@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; All,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; At the Agile Open Northwest conference I held an<br/>\n&gt; open space session on the<br/>\n&gt; future of testing tools. I expected to talk a little<br/>\n&gt; about Theories and<br/>\n&gt; assertThat, but we ended up having a wide-ranging<br/>\n&gt; discussion about a variety<br/>\n&gt; of topics. I mind-mapped the result and put in on<br/>\n&gt; the conference wiki: <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.agileopennorthwest.com/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?FutureOfUnitTesting\">http://www.agileopennorthwest.com/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?FutureOfUnitTesting</a><br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The most surprising result to me was the interest in<br/>\n&gt; language features for<br/>\n&gt; testing-what would a language look like that<br/>\n&gt; included double-checking as a<br/>\n&gt; first-class concept? I was also surprised at how<br/>\n&gt; much commonality there was<br/>\n&gt; between the unit and functional testing &quot;vendors&quot;,<br/>\n&gt; that reporting is a big<br/>\n&gt; issue for everyone.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; One thing missing from the discussion was much talk<br/>\n&gt; about the hopes and<br/>\n&gt; dreams of users, so I thought I would open up the<br/>\n&gt; question here. What is it<br/>\n&gt; you wish your testing tool would do for you that it<br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Cheers,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Kent Beck<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Three Rivers Institute<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been<br/>\n&gt; removed]<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n </span></blockquote>____________________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nNow that&#39;s room service!
