We wrapped it.  Yes, we had system tests, but in order to test <br/>\n&gt;&gt;our logic independently, we pretty much had to wrap it.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;    <br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I don&#39;t want the tests to be independent of the libraries they depend <br/>\n&gt;on. I want them to depend on exactly what the code depends on: no more; <br/>\n&gt;no less. That way you find bugs in the boundaries between model classes <br/>\n&gt;and libraries as well as in the model classes and libraries themselves.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s fine as a personal preference.  The question is, whether as an <br/>\nAPI developer, you should make that choice for other people.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Now if the library had a legitimate need to create documents in memory <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;for reasons other than testing, then I would add such functions. However <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;I wouldn&#39;t do it just for testing.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;      <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;The fact is, testing is a legitmate need.  Designing for testability is <br/>\n&gt;&gt;simply good engineering.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;    <br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The tail is wagging the dog. Testing is done to support the project. It <br/>\n&gt;is not the project, and it should not control the project. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Okay.  Nobody has said that testing should control the project.  If <br/>\nyou&#39;re designing an API, testability of client code is just another <br/>\nfeature that you offer the user.  It&#39;s not unprecendented.  Automobiles, <br/>\nphone switches, etc, they all design in test points.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I am willing <br/>\n&gt;to consider that a library might need to adjust itself to enable client <br/>\n&gt;applications to test *themselves* (Testing the library is the library <br/>\n&gt;vendor&#39;s responsibility) but I still haven&#39;t seen a detailed, worked out <br/>\n&gt;example demonstrating how a library might prevent client applications <br/>\n&gt;from testing themselves. Pithy sayings are well and good; but they need <br/>\n&gt;to be backed up by case studies with enough detail to allow them to be <br/>\n&gt;independently verified.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I visit work with roughly 10-15 teams a year, and the problems are <br/>\npretty common, especially now that the profile of testing has been <br/>\nraised.  The most recent one is a team that writes trading software.  <br/>\nThey don&#39;t want to issue trades to a real exchange so it&#39;s mocked.  <br/>\nTesting would bankrupt the company if their software issued testing <br/>\ntrades to a real exchange. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve never thought about case studies to show people who&#39;ve never <br/>\nencountered the problem, that there is a problem.  I&#39;m not sure what it <br/>\nwould achieve really.  If you haven&#39;t encountered it, you&#39;re lucky.  <br/>\nWhat domain do you work in?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I&#39;ll keep an eye out for such a case in the future, but I don;t recall <br/>\n&gt;ever noticing one. I do recall numerous examples where I had trouble <br/>\n&gt;testing code that wasn&#39;t intended to be used as a library in the first <br/>\n&gt;place. However in all cases I can think of the problems that prevented <br/>\n&gt;testing also prevented library usage. The problems were in no way unique <br/>\n&gt;to testability, nor did you have to resort to testability to justify <br/>\n&gt;fixing the problems,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Again, you&#39;re lucky.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMichael Feathers<br/>\nwww.objectmentor.com</div>",
