The\nunsupported, open-source-produced Ant &lt;jpcovreport/&gt; task produces nicer\nHTML reports than JProbe&#39;s commercial one. Source code line counts in\nJProbe don&#39;t include abstract classes or interfaces or any class that\ndidn&#39;t get loaded at runtime, so they can be a little hard to fathom if\nyou use something like JavaNCSS to count your source.  The Ant task can\nproduce more accurate counts of source code by using a reference path to\nyour source code.  JProbe seems to run best with IBM 1.3 JVM on Windows.\nCan hang (with any JVM) if there&#39;s heavy duty RMI usage in your tests or\nclasses.  Needs lots of heap (at least -Xmx128m).\n\nBorland&#39;s OptimizeIt Coverage (formerly VMgear):\nhttp://www.borland.com/optimizeit/code_coverage/index.html.  Fairly\nrecent addition to the OptimizeIt suite.  I was in the beta and was\ndisappointed that they did nothing to improve on some of the lacking\nfeatures of JProbe (like branch coverage).  Basically the same tool as\nJProbe with a different UI.  Might be worth looking into if you buy the\nwhole suite bundled with JBuilder.\n\nAs others already mentioned, Clover, which I like because it&#39;s\nintegrated with Ant out of the box, cheap as hell, and provides branch\ncoverage as well as the usual line and method coverage.  Downside to\nClover is that you have to precompile all your code.  Nice thing about\nJProbe and OptimizeIt is that they can run on class files or jar files\nwith no precompilation step necessary.  But the Clover reports are the\nbest looking of all and the price is right: $125 for one user.  Not sure\nhow accurate the source line summaries are off the top of my head, but I\nwould expect them to be pretty accurate since it uses Antlr to\ninstrument the source rather than runtime bytecode instrumentation.\n\nCompuware/NuMega have a code coverage tool in DevPartner TrueCoverage\nfor Java.  Similar to JProbe and OptimizeIt except it also supports code\ncoverage for C code.  Ditto for PureCoverage, the Rational code coverage\ntool.  I didn&#39;t like the PureCoverage GUI, and the tool required a\nprecompilation step.\n\nBest,\n\nScott Stirling\nFramingham, MA\n\n\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: arieroy2002 [mailto:arieroy@...] \n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, September 11, 2002 5:16 AM\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: [junit] Re: JUnit Test coverage - Statement complete\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In junit@y..., &quot;shmaytan&quot; &lt;shmaytan@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Hi!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I have a bunch of white-box Junit tests and I would like to check if\n&gt; I\n&gt; &gt; have executed every line of code with the tests.  Not just every \n&gt; &gt; method, but every line of code within the method.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Does anyone know of a good tool (hopefully free...) that works on\n&gt; Linux???\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thanks,\n&gt; &gt; -Eytan\n&gt; \n&gt; I know two commercial tools that offer support for \n&gt; showing/determining test coverage:\n&gt; 1) JTest from Parasoft (very expensive tool), see \nhttp://www.parasoft.com\n2) QStudio for Java from QA Systems (less expensive) see\nhttp://www.qa-systems.com/downloads/qstudioforjava/index.html \n\nSupport for JUnit testing, coverage information and creating your own\ncodingstandard checks will be available in QStudio for Java by the end\nof this year.\n\nGreetings\nArie Roy\n\n\n\n\n\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\njunit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n \n\nYour use of Yahoo!
