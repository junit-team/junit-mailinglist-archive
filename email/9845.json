Each object has a &quot;normal&quot; life cycle that <br/>\nconsists of the following methods being called: beginFile(), print(), <br/>\nendFile().  The result of these calls is a file generated on disk.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess that this is not unit testing because I&#39;m not testing a <br/>\nsingle method&#39;s actions.  I want to call this sequence of methods and <br/>\nthen compare the generated files to golden masters.<br/>\n<br/>\nFURTHERMORE, I&#39;d like to use reflection to perform these steps on <br/>\neach class in the heirarchy so it will automatically test new <br/>\nimplementations as they are added to the tree.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs it inappropriate to use junit in this way?  Is there a better way?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!</div>",
