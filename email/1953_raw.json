The green bar is nice and gives us (programmers)  that lovely warm\nfeeling, but there&#39;s no comparison to the hideous response of the red bar.\nIt&#39;s like the difference betweed a shiny new BMW and a clunker that just\ngets you from point A to point B.  One does its job in the simplest way it\ncan without trying to show off at all, the other is all about showing off\n(don&#39;t analyze the analogy to death - frankly I am not very good at them).\nThe reason we implemented the &quot;enhancement&quot; was for managament&#39;s sake\nmostly.  However, I guess there is something to be said about having a code\nbase of N classes and at least N asserts if not more.  It makes you wonder\nhow well the code base is tested or designed when you have N/2 asserts.\nHmmm...\n\nBTW: About the red bar, we also implemented (mostly for kicks and took it\nout later) code that would play a really obnoxious .wav file when the red\nbar showed up (&quot;Cry havoc!! and let slip the dogs of war!&quot; - from one of the\nStar Trek movies [Christopher Plummer]).  It was pretty exciting for a\nwhile. :)\n\n-Jason\n\n    &gt; -----Original Message-----\n    &gt; From: Di Iorio, Matthew (ISS Atlanta) [mailto:mdiiorio@...]\n    &gt; Sent: Monday, July 16, 2001 6:11 PM\n    &gt; To: &#39;junit@yahoogroups.com&#39;\n    &gt; Subject: [junit] Why doesn&#39;t JUnit count asserts?\n    &gt; \n    &gt; \n    &gt; We&#39;ve done the same with our JUnit.
