However, when I tried it with a new test class yesterday JUnit didn&#39;t behave in the expected way. This is in RAD 8.0.4 using JUnit 4.8.1.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe assertEquals in the second test method is reported as a failure even though the method being tested returned the correct results (I traced through with debug to verify). JUnit appended the result from the first test method to the result from the second test method and reported the second method as a failure because the combined result didn&#39;t match the expected result.<br/>\n<br/>\nAm I using the parameterized test incorrectly by having multiple test methods or is there a bug in JUnit?</div>",
