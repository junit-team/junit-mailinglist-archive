E returns to C, C \nreturns to B, B returns to A.\n\nif you want to just test A, then create a Mock of B.  The Mock of B \nwill just validate it was called, and return.  In the test, replace B \nwith Mock B.  So the test looks like...\n\nA calls Mock B, Mock B returns to A\n\nThis way you are only testing A and it&#39;s interaction with B.  It also \nhelps with maintiance of your unit tests.  Without the Mock B, \nanytime C or E changes, you are likely to need to change your test.  \nWith the mock object, the test is no longer dependent of C and E.\n\n- Greg\n\n--- In junit@y..., darren.hobbs@y... wrote:\n&gt; cc:\n&gt; bcc:\n&gt; Contact:   Tel: 2761  -  None Available, 1st Floor South, Queens \nWalk\n&gt; \n&gt; Testing private methods\n&gt; \n&gt; ...\n&gt;\n&gt; If your method chains are so large its hard to pinpoint the problem \nwhen a unit\n&gt; test fails, then perhaps some refactoring is in order to break up \nthe chain.  A\n&gt; method call should generally perform one discreet action.  In \nalmost every\n&gt; application I&#39;ve seen where hard-to-find bugs are causing problems, \nmany of them\n&gt; could be reduced by making the methods smaller, and having more of \nthem.  As\n&gt; long as each method does one well-defined thing, and is sensibly \nnamed, having\n&gt; more small methods will cause less confusion than having methods \nthat are 300\n&gt; lines long.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; -Darren\n&gt; \n\n\n\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\njunit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n \n\nYour use of Yahoo!
