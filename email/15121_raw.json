But so be it. \n\nThe application runs in WebSphere wit=\r\nh a Oracle9i backend and connects\nto MQ Series for internal/external queuin=\r\ng. It polls a database table\nthat a Legacy application populates and there =\r\nare no api for this app.\n\nMy questions are should I mock the inserts to the=\r\n legacy app database?\nAnd use cactus from this point on to test the app? An=\r\nd how do I test\nthe internal/external queuing? \n\nI hope this is the right p=\r\nlace for these questions.\n\nbrolamar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
