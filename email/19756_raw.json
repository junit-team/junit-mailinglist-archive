However, I&#39;ve\nfound that JUnit 4 and its eclipse plugin works faster and nicer. So I&#39;ve\ndecided change all my unit tests to JUnit. \n\nI have a runUnitTests ant target that is used to run (previously) the\ntest-ng tests that are marked as &quot;UnitTests&quot;\n\nAs a start, I have changed this ant target to run all tests in my tests\ntarget directory (i.e. using **/*.class)\n\nWhat I thought would happen was that JUnit would look at these classes, find\nthe ones that are marked with the JUnit 4 @Test annotation and run them.\n\nWhat I&#39;m finding however is that it is attempting to run EVERY class in that\nfolder as a test and they are either Test-NG tests or just other utility\nclasses. As a result, JUnit is throwing errors\n\ne.g.\nRunning au.tributech.tuxedo.beans.entity.PermissionTest$1\n    [junit] Tests run: 2, Failures: 0, Errors: 2, Time elapsed: 0.017 sec\n    [junit] Test au.tributech.tuxedo.beans.entity.PermissionTest$1 FAILED\n    [junit] Running\nau.tributech.tuxedo.beans.entity.PermissionTest$PermissionDescendant\n    [junit] Tests run: 2, Failures: 0, Errors: 2, Time elapsed: 0.018 sec\n    [junit] Test\nau.tributech.tuxedo.beans.entity.PermissionTest$PermissionDescendant FAILED\n\nIs there any way out of the box to make Junit just run the tests that use\norg.junit.Test annoations ??\n\nWhat I have got working (but its slow) is to write a custom ANT selector. \n&lt;batchtest fork=&quot;yes&quot; todir=&quot;${test.report.dir}&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;fileset dir=&quot;${test.fixtures.dir}&quot; includes=&quot;**/*.class&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;custom classname=&quot;au.tributech.ant.JUnit4Selector&quot;\nclasspathref=&quot;project.test.run.classpath&quot;/&gt;\n  &lt;/fileset&gt;\n&lt;/batchtest&gt;\n\nThe JUnit4Selector class I wrote simply reads in each file processed and\nuses ASM-3.0 to look for JUnit4 annotations (@Test, @RunsWith etc..). If\nthey exist it processes that file otherwise skips it.\n\nThis works but it is pretty slow and I can see it being painfully slow when\nthere are hundreds of unit tests.\n\nSurely I&#39;m missing something here and JUnit&#39;s ANT task is smarter than what\nit is appearing. I don&#39;t want to have to specify EVERY unit test when I add\nthem. That is just a maintenance nightmare.\n\nThanks for any pointers\n-- \nView this message in context: http://www.nabble.com/Junit-4-and-Ant-tf4289986.html#a12212626\nSent from the JUnit - User mailing list archive at Nabble.com.\n\n\n",
