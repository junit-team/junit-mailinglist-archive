Usually, there is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; decomposition of the algorithm in the production class.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sometimes, I simply expose what might be thought of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; as private details. Sometimes, I can think of a better way<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to structure the problem, and am not worried about exposing<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the internals.  But sometimes, I really don&#39;t want to expose<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the internals to other production classes, but still want<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to be able to get at those points for testing.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Would you not extract that functionality into another class and test it<br/>\n&gt; there?  And pass that (unit tested) code into your primary class?<br/>\n&gt;  That way<br/>\n&gt; do you not get the best of both worlds - and also the ability to plug in a<br/>\n&gt; new implementation as/when required?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Jonathan<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Absolutely, it comes back to the original class having more than one<br/>\nresponsibility.  That responsibility was hidden inside a private method, by<br/>\npulling it out into its own class we can UnitTest it directly, without the<br/>\nneed to break encapsulation, and we have a better class design.</div>",
