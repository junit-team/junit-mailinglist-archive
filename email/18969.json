The essential tests are the<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; ones that drove my design decisions, while the coverage tests are the<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; ones that I added to protect against future refactorings.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; That restatement is interesting. I&#39;ve thought in the past that I&#39;d<br/>\n&gt; like at least three different organizational schemes for my tests:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 1) By class tested<br/>\n&gt; 2) By functionality tested<br/>\n&gt; 3) By order of creation*<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You bring out possibly yet another:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 4) By intent<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Perhaps 3 and 4 are similar. I&#39;ve thought in the past it should be<br/>\n&gt; possible to do all of this by thinking hard about how I lay out my<br/>\n&gt; tests, but I now think that, at least, 3 and 4 lead to a different<br/>\n&gt; organization than 1 and 2. Do you think that JUnit could help with<br/>\n&gt; this, or would the first step be in an IDE?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I could imagine annotating tests with the information /in theory/, but I <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t imagine stopping to bother to do it while test-driving. As I <br/>\nwrote in another message, this idea begins to feel like a teaching tool <br/>\nto me, rather than a technique for professional practice.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
