We use this class to dynamically generate buttons for our \nweb site.  I would like to add testing to the class that draws the text on \nthe background image.  So far my only idea for testing a class like this is \nto visually inspect the results.  Any ideas on how one could use JUnit to \ntest something like this?  I want to verify that the image generated by this \nclass is in fact the background image with the given text and that it is \nvertically centered and that the line wrapping works as expected. \n\nA similar problem that would seem as difficult as above would be a class \nthat modifies a sound file. \n\nThanks,\nTodd Chaffee\n\n",
