A test that never executes because its assumption is never satisfied is counterproductive.  In this case, a failure would alert the user could fix the assumption, update the test data, or remove the test entirely if it&#39;s no longer needed.\n\n\n\nRocco\n\n\n\nFrom: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of Charlie Poole\nSent: Thursday, February 11, 2010 2:28 AM\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: RE: [junit] Something is bothering me about assumptions\n\n\n\n\n\nIt seems to me that the behavior you are asking for is appropriate\nif an assumption fails in a normal test as opposed to a theory.\n\nCharlie\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: junit@yahoogroups.com&lt;mailto:junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt; [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com&lt;mailto:junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt;] On\n&gt; Behalf Of Berin\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, February 09, 2010 2:29 PM\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com&lt;mailto:junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [junit] Something is bothering me about assumptions\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ve seen in a few places that if an assumption fails, the\n&gt; test automatically passes. I then ran into the test case\n&gt; that confirms that action. Coming from the aspect that I\n&gt; want to have confidence that my code and tests are\n&gt; functioning properly, I honestly think that is the wrong action.\n&gt;\n&gt; If an assumption is violated then it should be either a\n&gt; failure or at best ignored. To say the test passes because\n&gt; something failed is like saying you don&#39;t have a cavity\n&gt; because the dentist doesn&#39;t have the right tool. You don&#39;t\n&gt; know one way or the other, and the test won&#39;t be able to run\n&gt; properly when the assumption is violated.\n&gt;\n&gt; It&#39;s partly that reason that I don&#39;t use assumptions to begin\n&gt; with. If there needs to be a certain precondition to the\n&gt; test passing, I will add those assertions before I perform\n&gt; the action that needs to be tested. To me, it is a failure\n&gt; if the test could not be set up properly.\n&gt;\n&gt; If you want something a little softer, then I recommend that\n&gt; a failed assumption is equivalent to the @Ignore annotation.\n&gt; You&#39;ll see in the summary that X number of tests were run, Y\n&gt; number of tests ignored, and Z number of tests failed.\n&gt; Although, for ignored tests I&#39;d like to see what the reason\n&gt; was (failed assumption or manually ignored through the attribute).\n&gt;\n&gt; Making a test pass because of a failed assumption gives you a\n&gt; false sense of security about your code. What is happening\n&gt; is that the test just wasn&#39;t run, and there may be a\n&gt; legitimate problem hiding. To me that is the most dangerous\n&gt; part of that solution. I&#39;d rather get the bad news straight\n&gt; than trust faulty information.\n&gt;\n&gt; Am I making sense?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
