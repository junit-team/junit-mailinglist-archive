We use this class to dynamically generate buttons for our <br/>\nweb site.  I would like to add testing to the class that draws the text on <br/>\nthe background image.  So far my only idea for testing a class like this is <br/>\nto visually inspect the results.  Any ideas on how one could use JUnit to <br/>\ntest something like this?  I want to verify that the image generated by this <br/>\nclass is in fact the background image with the given text and that it is <br/>\nvertically centered and that the line wrapping works as expected. <br/>\n<br/>\nA similar problem that would seem as difficult as above would be a class <br/>\nthat modifies a sound file. <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nTodd Chaffee</div>",
