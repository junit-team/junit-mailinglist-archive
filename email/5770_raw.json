The &quot;rightness&quot; is that it is the Right Thing\n&gt; To Do(tm) to throw a IAE when receiving junk parameters. [...]\n\n*chuckle*  I&#39;ll so stipulate, though I notice that the existing\nJava API doesn&#39;t do so in all cases.  (I don&#39;t mean to refer only\nto its throwing NullPtrExc when arguments are unexpectedly null as\nothers have noted, but also, eg., to its throwing\nIndexOutOfBoundsExc from String.charAt(), and ArithmeticExc from\nBigInteger.divide().)\n\n&gt; [...] In your\n&gt; code fragment, the different things that I might do would be to\n&gt; issue different errors to the user or log file. An IAE means that\n&gt; the programmer goofed, while other errors might be for less\n&gt; negligent reasons.\n&gt; \n&gt; For example, if my code is reading a file from a CD and someone\n&gt; ejects the CD during the process [...]\n\nYes, but surely that would look like\n    try {\n            // Do something involving that file\n    } catch (CDNotInDriveException e) {\n            // (a little-known subclass of IOException)\n            // ... foo! tell user to put the CD back in\n    } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {\n            // ... which still leaves me puzzled about what goes here ...\n    } catch (RuntimeException e) {\n            // ... without being equally good here\n    }\n\nTo put it another way:\n\nCertainly IllegalArgExc means that the programmer goofed, so there\nis almost certainly no possibility of fixing the problem at\nruntime (as by asking the user to do something, or retrying the\noperation).  The program just has to accept that the operation\nthat threw the exception cannot proceed (and possibly invoke\nfallback mechanisms, make entries in a log, apologize abjectly to\nthe user, etc.).\n\nBut this applies equally for *any* unanticipated RuntimeExc, and\nso can be done generically by catching RuntimeExc...  at which\npoint it doesn&#39;t matter whether IllegalArgExc or NullPtrExc or\nIndexOutOfBoundsExc was thrown.\n\n(To be clear:  I&#39;m willing to agree that IllegalArgExc is more\ninformative than NullPtrExc to a human reading it in a stack trace\nor log, and is on these grounds preferable where appropriate.  I&#39;m\njust saying that I can&#39;t imagine running code having any use for\nthe distinction... except, conceivably, the code of a debugger.)\n\n\n",
