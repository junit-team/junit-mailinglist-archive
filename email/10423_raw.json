But the thing is this is application that I \nam trying to test and they need something automated to run it. These \nmicrosoft documents can change with date and can remain same for \nmonths. Everytime this document changes, there is a mail in my \nmailbox having the document. I have made a test document in the \ndatabase, that everday its date changes so I get one document in my \nmailbox, but with different date.  But scanning a mailbox to find \none mail can be hard? The other properties I would like to test is \nam i getting the right document back? A document can be sent in \nvarious formats, like HTML, OR word. I want to make sure if the \nformat is right..I dont know how this is possible.. May be u can \nhelp.. Thanks!!!\n\n\n\n\n",
