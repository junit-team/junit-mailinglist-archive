After that get the navigator instances\n&gt; from the factory one by one and test them.\n&gt;\n&gt; You can get the factory and the list of instances\n&gt; in a setUp() method. Write a test method for each kind\n&gt; of test and run it on all instances known to the\n&gt; factory.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thats the way I would try it,\n&gt;\n&gt; Andreas.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve been using JUnit to test my Java classes for a\n&gt; &gt; few weeks now.  I&#39;ve reached a problem that others\n&gt; &gt; have encountered as well.\n&gt; &gt; Here&#39;s the problem:\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve been asked, by my team leader, to write what&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; called an AbstractNavigator.  It doesn&#39;t matter what a\n&gt; &gt; Navigator is, the important point is that\n&gt; &gt; AbstractNavigator is an abstract class. This abstract\n&gt; &gt; class has a couple subclasses already (MDINavigator\n&gt; &gt; and TabbedPaneNavigator), and more will be written in\n&gt; &gt; the future.\n&gt; &gt; We want to create unit tests (using JUnit, let&#39;s say\n&gt; &gt; AbstractUnitTest) which will apply to any\n&gt; &gt; AbstractNavigator.  Herein lies the problem.  I can&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; actually test the AbstractNavigator because I can&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &quot;have a(n)&quot; AbstractNavigator since it&#39;s abstract.\n&gt; &gt; Therefore, I need to test a subclass of the\n&gt; &gt; AbstractNavigator, but currently, the only way I see\n&gt; &gt; of doing that (making the AbstractUnitTest &quot;have a&quot;\n&gt; &gt; MDINavigator) restricts the abstractedness of the unit\n&gt; &gt; tests.  The AbstractUnitTest could not be used without\n&gt; &gt; recompiling, a step to be avoided.\n&gt; &gt; Another method we&#39;ve thought of is to add a method\n&gt; &gt; &quot;getNavigator&quot; to the AbstractUnitTest which is called\n&gt; &gt; from the TestCase setUp() method.  This getNavigator\n&gt; &gt; method would only be implemented by subclassing the\n&gt; &gt; AbstractUnitTest class and would then return the\n&gt; &gt; specific type of AbstractNavigator to be tested (i.e.\n&gt; &gt; MDINavigator).  The problem with this solution is that\n&gt; &gt; the method of TestCase which returns the TestSuite is\n&gt; &gt; static and therefore cannot be overridden...where to\n&gt; &gt; go from here?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If anyone can give us any more information about this\n&gt; &gt; kind of abstract unit testing, we would greatly\n&gt; &gt; appreciate it.\n&gt; &gt; Thanks,\n&gt; &gt; CJ\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
