I like the IDE integration and it<br/>\nworks well with our continuous build system (Luntbuild and currently<br/>\nas trial TeamCity). I think performance depends more on other factors.<br/>\nOne developer on our team was complaining about the build time with<br/>\nall tests, which on his machine took more than 10 minutes (and because<br/>\nof that he didn&#39;t run them often enough). On my machine (different OS,<br/>\ndifferent hardware) I got it down to 2-3 minutes. In order to solve<br/>\nhis long build time, we are trying out TeamCity now, so that a<br/>\ndeveloper can run the tests on the build server before checking in his<br/>\ncode. The build server can scaled and optimized.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaven has a learning curve as all tools but until now we are pleased<br/>\nwith it. I does what it should be doing. I recently mavenized 3 old<br/>\nlegacy projects and it was nice to see how it simplified things, which<br/>\nshould save time and money.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards,<br/>\n<br/>\nHarald<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nCITOCON EUROPE 2007 - Brussels - October 19 & 20, 2007<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.citconf.com/brussels2007/\">http://www.citconf.com/brussels2007/</a><br/>\nLast week for registration!<br/>\n-- <br/>\nHarald Walker - www.bitwalker.nl<br/>\nLinkedIn - <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/in/haraldwalker\">http://www.linkedin.com/in/haraldwalker</a></div>",
