When I move over to unix, things\nare ok so long as I am running a X-Display Server. If I don&#39;t then strange\nclassloading exceptions start being thrown. All of my non-gui unit tests\nstill run fine of course.\n\nThis would be ok except that I run a daily build every night from cron\nthat does a checkout, compile, and unit test. This unit tests for the GUI\nclasses fail because there is no X-Display attached. My current solutions\nare:\n\t1. Only run GUI tests on windows (works, but lame)\n\t2. Create a &quot;fake&quot; X-Display on unix so the GUI tests can run\n\t   (I have no idea how to do this)\n\t3. Something else I didn&#39;t think of\n\nHas anybody else run into this sort of thing? If so, how did you approach\na soltion?\n\nAlso of note, the GUI unit tests do not actually display anything. They\ncreate, manipulate, add/remove AWT components but never actually write\nanything to the Display (and therefore don&#39;t read from the Display\nso I don&#39;t need any features like java.awt.Robot or anything).\n\nThanks,\n\n-- \nChester Kustarz 2\nhttp://www.monkey.org/~chester\n\n\n",
