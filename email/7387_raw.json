However, i couldn&#39;t specify all the possible \n&gt; outputs right?\n&gt; \n&gt; so how to do method testing?\n\nMaybe you have in mind a more complicated case, but what would it\ntake to *convince* you that your trimA method works? Does it really\ntake every possible string? I&#39;m thinking there is probably some\nsmaller set of cases that would provide &#39;reasonable&#39; confidence.\n\nHowever, you don&#39;t just have to use assertEquals.\nWhat about an assertTrue (or assertFalse) based on &#39;A&#39; or &#39;a&#39;\nexisting in the string after the trimA() call?\nWhat about counting the number of &#39;A&#39; and &#39;a&#39; instances BEFORE,\nand making sure the trimmed string is that many characters LESS\nin length?\n\nAnd of course, if the input is ONLY A&#39;s and a&#39;s, do you get\na NULL or an empty string?\n\nI think there are lots of things that can reasonably be tested\nwith only a few tests on a representative sample.\n\nRichard.\n\n\n",
