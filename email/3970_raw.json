You could just as \neasily use that to peer into your test code to ascertain what methods \nare actually being executed.  Then diff against all available methods \n(again javap is your friend here) to have a pretty clear picture of what \nexactly is being touched, not just what classes are being touched.  \nAutomating this task wouldn&#39;t be a horrid undertaking either.\n\nI tried to put a little polish on this script before including it in \nthis email to make it hopefully useful but no guarantees.  Here&#39;s an \nexample of the output to find all the methods being called in the \n&quot;junit&quot; java package from my code:\n\n$ jtouch junit `find $src -name &quot;*.java&quot;` 2&gt; /dev/null\njunit.framework.Assert.assert()\njunit.framework.TestResult.&lt;init&gt;()\njunit.framework.TestResult.addError()\n...\n\n-shane\n\n#!/bin/bash\n#\n# jtouch\n# Goes through a list of class files, source files, or class names and\n# determines based on an include pattern/package and an exclude package\n# what classes and methods are being touched.\n#\n# Shane Celis &lt;shane@...&gt;\n\nif [ -z &quot;$1&quot; ]; then\n\techo &quot;Usage: jtouch &lt;include package&gt; [exclude package] \n&lt;file.java ...&gt;&quot; &gt; /dev/stderr;\n\texit 2;\nfi\nif [ -z &quot;$CLASSPATH&quot; ]; then\n\techo &quot;Warning: might want to set your CLASSPATH environment \nvariable.&quot; &gt; /dev/stderr;\nfi\ninclude=&quot;$1&quot;;\nexclude=&quot;$2&quot;;\nshift;\nif [ -z &quot;$2&quot; ] || [ -f &quot;$2&quot; ]; then\n\techo &quot;debug: No exclude pattern&quot; &gt; /dev/stderr\n\texclude=&quot;*&quot;;\nelse\n\tshift;\nfi\noutput=methods.tmp\nif [ -f &quot;$output&quot; ]; then\n\techo &quot;Error: must remove &#92;&quot;$output&#92;&quot; file before continuing.&quot;\n\texit 1;\nfi\nfor file in &quot;$@&quot;; do\n\t#`find com -name &quot;*.java&quot;`; do\n\tfile=${file%%.java}\n\tfile=${file%%.class}\n\tfile=${file##./}\n\techo &quot;disassembling $file&quot; &gt; /dev/stderr\n\techo -e &quot;&#92;nDISASSEMBLING $file&quot; &gt;&gt; $output\n\tjavap -c -b &quot;$file&quot; | grep &quot;&lt;Method $include&quot; | grep -v \n&quot;$exclude&quot; | perl -e &#39;while(&lt;&gt;) {print $1, &quot;()&#92;n&quot; if (/Method \n([&#92;S&#92;.]+)&#92;(/); }&#39; &gt;&gt; $output\ndone\nsort $output | uniq | grep -v &quot;^DISASSEMBLING&quot;\n#rm &quot;$output&quot;\n\n\nOn Tuesday, February 5, 2002, at 12:02  PM, Chris Eppstein wrote:\n\n&gt; Thanks to all for your replies. To recap:\n&gt;\n&gt; The filename matching system that David proposed was my first thought as\n&gt; well and it could be implemented as an Ant task easily enough so that\n&gt; can be\n&gt; used to fail a build if a test case is missing, etc... I had started to\n&gt; write this utility when I decided to email the list and make sure I\n&gt; wasn&#39;t\n&gt; re-inventing the wheel. I think that this approach is a good first step\n&gt; but\n&gt; it doesn&#39;t give us a look into the code and it would be difficult to\n&gt; handle\n&gt; interfaces (for which I rarely write a unit test).\n&gt;\n&gt; I looked at NoUnit but I cannot get it to run with Java 1.4 -- it looks\n&gt; promising though. Quilt is the most ambitious of the open source\n&gt; projects\n&gt; and it also looks to be very promising -- but is still pre-alpha and\n&gt; probably not ready for use in a corporate setting.\n&gt;\n&gt; Integration with Ant is, of-course, a big plus for any utility that can\n&gt; be\n&gt; used for this task. Looks like there&#39;s some definate room for\n&gt; improvement in\n&gt; this area. Does anyone else have some suggestions?\n&gt;\n&gt; Chris\n&gt;\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Vladimir Bossicard [mailto:vladimir@...]\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, February 05, 2002 9:33 AM\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: Re: [junit] checking for test coverage\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Does anyone know of any utilities that can check for test coverage.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; You can have a look at Quilt: http://quilt.sourceforge.net\n&gt;\n&gt; Off the record: it would be interesting to know what is the average\n&gt; coverage of the Test First Design method: 80%, 90%, 95%, 100%?\n&gt;\n&gt; -Vladimir\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt; Vladimir Bossicard\n&gt; www.bossicard.com\n&gt;\n\n\n",
