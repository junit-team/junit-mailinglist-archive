B. Rainsberger [mailto:jbr@...]\n&gt;...\n&gt; &gt; Isn&#39;t documentation the thing that should be used to tell the\n&gt; &gt; writer of code that calls yours what your code is supposed to\n&gt; &gt; do, or what the caller is supposed to do (or not do)?  (At\n&gt; &gt; least for code meant to be re-used, such as that implementing\n&gt; &gt; an API?)\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes, it is. Please explain to me why unit tests are not \n&gt; documentation. :)\n\n\nBecause tests aren&#39;t specifications. \n\n(How can a test show that the caller is responsible for not \npassing in a null pointer?\n\nYou can&#39;t test for any particular behavior from the callee\nif the callee&#39;s behavior in the face of a null pointer is \nintentially left undefined (e.g., for flexibility in \nimplementing an interface).)\n\n(How can a test show that a caller is responsible for not\ndepending on certain current behavior of an implementation\nthat is not part of the interface contract?)\n\n\nBecause tests are code.  \n\n(They have syntactic clutter that is necessary for use as tests \nbut which is just clutter relative to the information useful to a \nclient programmer.)\n\n\nBecause tests, being code, can&#39;t relate code to external concepts.  \n\n(A specification can say that a function f returns the mathematical\nsum of two given integers subject to the limitations of 32-bit\nsigned binary arithmetic.  How can a test say something like that?)\n\n\nTests are great, but don&#39;t forget the documentation.\n\n\nIt seems that some people who write tests waste one advantage of it:  \n\nI agree that testing, especially writing tests even before you implement, \nis good because it forces you to think about what your code is supposed \nto do and how it&#39;s supposed to be used.  \n\nWell, if you&#39;re already thinking about the contract, then that&#39;s a\ngood time to document the contract.  \n\n\nYes, I know this has to be modulated by what kind of code we&#39;re\ntalking about (e.g., intra-program calls versus trans-API calls) \nand by how stable the interface contract is.  I just wouldn&#39;t\nwant to have to read test cases instead of Javadoc to figure \nout how, say, Sun&#39;s Servlet API worked and was supposed to be \nused. \n\n\n\nDaniel\n\n\n",
