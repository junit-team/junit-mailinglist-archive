What would be a proper course \nof\n&gt; &gt; action in case it is a system level exception?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Here&#39;s what I do:\n&gt; \n&gt;   try {\n&gt;     objectUnderTest.failMethod();\n&gt;     fail(&quot;failMethod call did not get exception&quot;);\n&gt;   }\n&gt;   catch (ExpectedException e) {\n&gt;     // Nothing, all is well\n&gt;     // If e has instance data, might check it\n&gt;   }\n&gt;   // Catch any unexpected checked exceptions and fail()\n&gt; \n&gt; I like fail() better than assert(false) since it expresses intent.\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t bother to check the message of the exception since the class \nis\n&gt; usually enough and the message is potentially unstable in the \npresence\n&gt; of changes elsewhere. However, if the exception contains other data \nI\n&gt; might check that. A notable example: for RemoteException I would\n&gt; probably at least check the type of the detail.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Rob\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; Yahoo!
