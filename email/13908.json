We didn&#39;t announce its availability widely until<br/>\n&gt; we thought we had something useful. We have gotten early feedback from a<br/>\n&gt; handful of developers, but we now have a release that we think can be used<br/>\n&gt; to write production tests.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I understand that some people have been quoting our private to-do list out<br/>\n&gt; of context. Private communication between Erich and me will in future take<br/>\n&gt; place more privately. It is too bad that it is not safe to let you all into<br/>\n&gt; our process. It is disturbing to find one&#39;s to-do-list quoted as promises<br/>\n&gt; broken or ideas stolen. It was just an old  to-do list. Maybe it&#39;s time to<br/>\n&gt; invest in an electron shredder :-)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I am sorry this got to you in the wrong form.<br/>\nPlease see it by yourself: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://themindstorms.blogspot.com/2005/06/junit-40.html.\">http://themindstorms.blogspot.com/2005/06/junit-40.html.</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI was doing a feature by feature comparison. And that todo list was part of the CVS (and was talking<br/>\nabout RC and final version - so I haven&#39;t got reasons to believe it was old/deprecated).<br/>\n<br/>\nhope this clears out my intention,<br/>\n:alex |.::the_mindstorm::.|<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; The theme of JUnit 4 is to encourage more developers to write more tests by<br/>\n&gt; further simplifying JUnit. To this end, we have followed NUnit&#39;s lead in<br/>\n&gt; identifying tests by annotation instead of subclassing and naming<br/>\n&gt; conventions. Tests can now live in any class. Tell JUnit they are there with<br/>\n&gt; the @Test annotation:<br/>\n&gt;   @Test public void basicTransaction() {...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The assertion methods are in an Assert class which is most easily used<br/>\n&gt; through static import:<br/>\n&gt;   import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;<br/>\n&gt;   ...<br/>\n&gt;   @Test public void example() {...assertEquals(2, 2);...}<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Set up and tear down are handled with the @Before and @After annotations.<br/>\n&gt; You can have as many @Befores and @Afters as you need. Inherited @Befores<br/>\n&gt; are executed before @Befores in subclasses and inherited @Afters are<br/>\n&gt; executed after @Afters in subclasses.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Shared setup is handled by @BeforeClass and @AfterClass. Methods with these<br/>\n&gt; annotations are executed once before (respectively after) all the tests in<br/>\n&gt; the class run.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; @Ignore causes a test not to be run, but it is reported as ignored.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; @Test takes two optional parameters. A test annotated @Test(timeout=100)<br/>\n&gt; will fail if the test takes longer than 100 milliseconds to complete. A test<br/>\n&gt; annotated @Test(expected=NullPointerException.class) will fail if a<br/>\n&gt; NullPointerException is not thrown and succeed if a NullPointerException is<br/>\n&gt; thrown.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Preserving existing investment in tests has taken nearly half of our<br/>\n&gt; development effort. JUnit 4 is forward and backward compatible. You can run<br/>\n&gt; older tests with the JUnit 4 test runner by passing them to the runner. You<br/>\n&gt; can run JUnit 4 tests with older test runners by wrapping the JUnit 4 test<br/>\n&gt; class in a compatibility class. The following method in a JUnit 4 test class<br/>\n&gt; causes it to run correctly with the Eclipse test runner.<br/>\n&gt;   public static junit.framework.Test suite() {<br/>\n&gt;     return new JUnit4TestAdapter(AssertionTest.class);<br/>\n&gt;   }<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; JUnit 4&#39;s command line interface can be invoked with:<br/>\n&gt;   java org.junit.runner.JUnitCore Test1 Test2<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The same interface can be invoked programmatically with:<br/>\n&gt;   JUnitCore.run(Test1.class, Test2.class);<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If you want to know more about the details of JUnit 4, you can browse the<br/>\n&gt; tests in org.junit.tests.*.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Erich and I will be participating on the JUnit lists to discuss further<br/>\n&gt; simplification of JUnit 4, integration with test runners, and experiences<br/>\n&gt; using it. Our experience with it (most of the tests were written JUnit 4<br/>\n&gt; style) has been very positive. The complexity of JUnit 3.x is like a tiny<br/>\n&gt; pebble in a shoe. It doesn&#39;t seem like much until it is gone.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Good testing,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Kent Beck<br/>\n&gt; Three Rivers Institute<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
