Dreaming is not a crime  \n&gt; you know? :P\n&gt;\n&gt; Any help here is SERIOUSLY appreciated, I&#39;m currently losing hours  \n&gt; and hours each day\n&gt; because I have to deploy a full JNLP java package in order to test  \n&gt; jnlp-enabled application,\n&gt; and I can&#39;t debug them at all.\n&gt;\n&gt; Also, automated JUnit testing can&#39;t presently be done AFAIK.\n&gt;\n&gt; Anyone knows a solution, or can give me some hints about this problem?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks in advance for any answer\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
