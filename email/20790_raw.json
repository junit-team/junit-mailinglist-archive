But here is some advice\n&gt; which will hopefully help you in resolving it:\n&gt; 1. Try writing some test cases for the other methods you have written. If\n&gt; these test cases also result in the stack overflow, then they will hopefully\n&gt; narrow down what circumstances the problem occurs under.\n&gt; 2. Look for places in your code where something is being added to a\n&gt; collection. These are places where not implementing a hashCode or equals\n&gt; method; or the order of inserts might be important. Write test cases to\n&gt; validate that these are working as you expect.\n&gt; 3. Refactor the very long methods into smaller methods while adding tests\n&gt; for them. It is hard to understand and debug methods that have deeply nested\n&gt; if/else conditions.\n&gt; 4. You can try adding System.out.println&#39;s to your code as Stefan suggests.\n&gt; I would do this as a last resort. The failing test case is trying to tell\n&gt; you something about the code and the process used to write it.\n&gt; 5. When you find the fix, report back and let others know about the\n&gt; experience. It&#39;s always good to share :-)\n&gt; Good luck!\n&gt; -Dennis\n&gt;\n&gt; On Thu, Aug 7, 2008 at 8:07 AM, Stefan Schulze &lt;algroth@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Hi Fuguo,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I didn&#39;t meant that you have the same problem.
