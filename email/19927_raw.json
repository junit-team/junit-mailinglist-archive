A testing framework should\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; provide this case, without using another one library.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Now you&#39;re making the hard assumption: that what you&#39;re doing is\n&gt;  &gt; commonly needed. A framework of any kind should solve common\n&gt; problems\n&gt;  &gt; and leave unusual ones to extensions. This is the difference\n&gt; between\n&gt;  &gt; &quot;framework&quot; and &quot;platform&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; Dear J.B. Rainsberger,\n&gt; \n&gt; It is a metter of opinion, the question is simple: �Can I change\n&gt; dinamically during a jUnit test the classpath?\n&gt; \n&gt; The answer you provide instead of saying NO, :-) is: use Ant. �Why?\n\nI am not certain that the answer is &quot;no&quot;, so I did not answer &quot;no&quot;. \nInstead, I gave you an answer that I thought would help you achieve the \nresult you wanted.\n\n&gt; Under jUnit, I can modify life cicle of the running process in order\n&gt; to make tests, why not to let the user to alter also some\n&gt; configuration information for example: classpath (and probably it is\n&gt; possible, specifying some class loader mechanism, but I am not an\n&gt; expert on that)\n\nEvery framework should decide which features are common enough to build \ninto the framework and which features should be implemented through \nextensions. No matter which decision the framework makes, someone will \nthink it&#39;s wrong. Since frameworks should be as small as possible, it \nmakes sense to include only those features we are certain should be there.\n\n&gt; I don&#39;t like test that depends on IDE&#39;s, because when the project\n&gt; grows up you end up that is much better to run them under console,\n&gt; that is why I don&#39;t like to assume specific location of Eclipse\n&gt; classpath.\n\nI agree, which is why I suggested Ant, which does not depend on any IDE.\n-- \nJ.
