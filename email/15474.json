I want <br/>\nto ramp up to developing EJB&#39;s, and would like to combine unit testing <br/>\nwith my build process (Maven).<br/>\n<br/>\nI have heard that there is a Cactus plug-in for Maven.  However, there <br/>\nare two problems with using Cactus: everyone who has used it for unit <br/>\ntesting says that it&#39;s more pleasurable to have bamboo shoved under <br/>\nhis/her fingernails, and the Cactus plug-in for Maven has been broken <br/>\nfor over a year.<br/>\n<br/>\nI understand that JUnitEE can be used for some unit testing of EJB&#39;s, <br/>\nbut what I have read indicates that I may not be able to automate the <br/>\ntesting in Maven.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny suggestions?</div>",
