Suppose that there were an object that represented just this \ninformation:\n\nclass SocketConnectionInfo {\n    Date connectionTime;\n    IPAddress originatingAddress;\n\n    boolean isConnectionFromSameAddressTooSoon(SocketConnectionInfo \nanotherConnection);\n}\n\nNow the code that disallows connections can talk to instances of this class. \nYou can simply bombard your code with SocketConnectionInfo objects and see \nhow it reacts to different sequences of them. This simulates the \nconnections.\n\nFinally, write code that creates a SocketConnectionInfo object for each \nincoming socket connection.\n\nI know nothing about sockets, so this is just the first idea that comes to \nmind. Would it work?\n\nJ. B.
