I had to make one =\r\nrule which composed and delegated to an ExternalResource rule and had its o=\r\nwn before and after methods because ExternalResource does not allow the ove=\r\nrriding of its apply method. I certainly understand the inclination to make=\r\n it final, but I would suggest that it be reconsidered.\n\nRegardless, going =\r\nfurther replacing my custom runner, I did hit another wall, with @BeforeCla=\r\nss and @AfterClass. I assume there is nothing to do about those (other than=\r\n an assumeThat in @BeforeClass)?\n\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, David Saff=\r\n &lt;david@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; That&#39;s right: Rules can affect the processing after=\r\n @Before and before\n&gt; @After.  Could you replace your setup/teardown with a=\r\nn\n&gt; ExternalResource rule?\n&gt; \n&gt;    David Saff\n&gt; \n&gt; On Thu, Aug 20, 2009 at =\r\n11:11 AM, yme0987654321&lt;yme0987654321@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; OK, I figured out the=\r\n problem. What happens is that I have a custom runner that suppresses the t=\r\nest (these are slow tests, so they are only run at check-in, not by the dev=\r\neloper while developing).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; However, when I replace that with a Rule,=\r\n the setup method is still run (looks slow). So I guess the conclusion is t=\r\nhat @Rule can&#39;t interrupt or override the setup and teardown process, so if=\r\n you need to do that you are back to a Runner? (Or making your own setups r=\r\nule-aware I guess).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In junit@yahoogroups.com, David Saff &lt;david=\r\n@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Yishai,\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I just ran a test, and the Rules in t=\r\nhe superclass were picked up.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Can you post a small example? =A0Thanks,=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =A0 =A0David Saff\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; On Thu, Aug 20, 2009 at 10:21 AM, Da=\r\nvid Saff&lt;david@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Yishai,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Sounds like a bug. =A0=\r\nCan you file it at github? =A0Sorry for the oversight,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; =A0 Da=\r\nvid Saff\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; On Wed, Aug 19, 2009 at 8:26 PM, yme0987654321&lt;yme09=\r\n87654321@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I&#39;m looking at the new Rule annotation in JUnit4.=\r\n It&#39;s pretty nice, but it doesn&#39;t seem to inherit.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; That is =\r\nif I have a super class that has the @Rule, sub class tests don&#39;t run the r=\r\nule on its tests.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Combined with the requirement that the ru=\r\nles field be public, this is surprising.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; The practical effe=\r\nct for me is that it can&#39;t really replace my custom runner, as the @RunWith=\r\n annotation is inherited by subclasses.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Am I missing someth=\r\ning?\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Yishai.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; --------------=\r\n----------------------\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Yahoo!
