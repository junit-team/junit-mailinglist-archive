Do excuse me if this question is\n&gt; &gt; too simple that it irritated you. OK so here is my confusion:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The method I want to test is something like this:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; public void someMethod(int someParam) throws invalidParamException\n&gt; &gt; {\n&gt; &gt;   if(someParam!=1||someParam!=2)\n&gt; &gt;         throw invalidParamException\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   someParam++;\n&gt; &gt; }\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Now this method will test someParam passed to it and if it gets stuck\n&gt; &gt; in the IF statement will throw exception else update someParam. Now\n&gt; &gt; what I wanna know is that the test method that I write to test a\n&gt; &gt; method like this should I be writing one test method that tests both\n&gt; &gt; whether exception is thrown correctly as well as someParam updated\n&gt; &gt; correctly. OR\n&gt; &gt; I should be writing one test method that tests for the exception and\n&gt; &gt; another that tests whether someParam is being updated appropriately.\n&gt;\n&gt;At least two methods.\n&gt;\n&gt;Note that the update to `someParam` is pointless in the code you\n&gt;show. `someParam` is a local variable (specifically, an argument)\n&gt;of primitive type (int); when someMethod exits, someParam evaporates.\n&gt;\n&gt;--\n&gt;Chris &quot;electric hedgehog&quot; Dollin\n&gt;Logic is rational /re/construction. Life is construction.\n\nI don&#39;t know why I didn&#39;t see it before (well, yes I do, I wasn&#39;t \nlooking!), but the example method simplifies to:\npublic void someMethod(int someParam) throws invalidParamException {\n         throw new invalidParamException();\n}\nSo it&#39;s trivial to test!  (Not to mention just plain trivial, but that&#39;s \nthe danger of trying to illustrate a point with &quot;code&quot;.  I&#39;m sure that if \none were to attempt to write a test for some observable behavior in place \nof the &quot;someParam++;&quot;  (say, a call to some other method), even the \noriginal author would discover the problem with the condition as written.\n\nThe problem with this type of code and the lack of tests is when someone \nchanges the condition and the previously unreachable code (but not \n&quot;unreachable&quot; in a simple, static sense) can then be executed.  I know I&#39;ve \nbeen bitten by that bug in the past.\n\n-Rob\n\nRob Biedenharn  &lt;Rob_Biedenharn@...&gt;\n(C) 513-295-4739\n(H) 513-677-2172        http://alum.mit.edu/www/rob_biedenharn/\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n\n",
