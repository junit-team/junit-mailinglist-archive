These are all\n&gt;assumptions (good ones, most likely).  Has anyone had real-world\n&gt;experience with this?  I am not trying to be a skeptic just for\n&gt;skepticism&#39;s sake.  I want to be convinced.\n\nYes, I have had real-world experiences that convinced me of the value of\nunit tests for documentation. It sounds like the only way for you to be\nconvinced is for you to also have similar real-world experiences.\n\n1. Unit tests can be run on MY machine, revealing undocumented problems (&quot;oh\nyes, you need NT 4 patch-level 5 for this, patch-level 4 is missing the blah\nblah DLL.&quot;) Much nicer to find this out by running the supplied tests,\nrather than code away and then wonder why your code isn&#39;t working.\n\n2. Unit tests sources are examples of how the code-under-test is expected to\nbe used.  I&#39;ve been burned too often by Documentation that is out of date or\ninaccurate or incomplete. Very often, the documentation doesn&#39;t have full\nexamples of calling every public API. Executable unit tests HAVE to be up to\ndate.... or reveal that the vendor is not running its own unit tests.\n\n3. Unit test sources can also be examples of how the code-under-test behaves\nin failure situations. &quot;hmm... this test shows that the file it opens has to\nhave write-access. That&#39;s why my code, which is trying to open a file on a\nCD-ROM, is failing.&quot; MUCH nicer to have a supplied unit test\n\n4. Poor unit tests are better than no unit tests at all.\n\nThe Booch Components (C++) were a really good class framework available in\nthe early days of C++ that came with sources (of necessity, since they were\ntemplate classes) and with unit tests. The unit tests gave you confidence\nthat whatever C++ compiler you were using was able to properly compile and\nrun the Booch components. Rogue Wave bought and buried the Booch Components,\nso you can&#39;t get them any more. They were a lot nicer than STL, IMO.\n\nToday, getting jar files (with no sources) from third-parties, it is VERY\nnice to have unit tests which will demonstrate to me that MY Java\nenvironments (MacOS 9 and X, Windows, JDK 1.1.8, JDK 1.3.1, CodeWarrior,\nVisualCafe, etc.) can run those the in those jars. Often, undocumented\ndependencies on JDK 1.3.1 show up, or assumptions were made about the\noperating system that would be revealed when running on MacOS 9.\n\n\r\n------_=_NextPart_001_01C16C6A.554A7240\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;\n&lt;HEAD&gt;\n&lt;META HTTP-=\r\nEQUIV=3D&quot;Content-Type&quot; CONTENT=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Diso-8859-1&quot;&gt;\n&lt;META N=\r\nAME=3D&quot;Generator&quot; CONTENT=3D&quot;MS Exchange Server version 5.5.2654.45&quot;&gt;\n&lt;TITL=\r\nE&gt;RE: Separate Package for Test Cases or not &lt;/TITLE&gt;\n&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY&gt;\n\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;F=\r\nONT SIZE=3D2&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; Date: Tue, 13 Nov 2001 08:10:51 -0500&lt;/FONT&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=3D2&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; From: &quot;Rogers, Jason&quot; &lt;jro=\r\ngers@...&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;\n&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=3D2&gt;&gt;Subject: RE: RE: Separate P=\r\nackage for Test Cases or not ?&lt;/FONT&gt;\n&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=3D2&gt;&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;\n&lt;BR&gt;&lt;F=\r\nONT SIZE=3D2&gt;&gt;perhaps... but I some how think it is overrated.&nbsp; The=\r\nse are all&lt;/FONT&gt;\n&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=3D2&gt;&gt;assumptions (good ones, most likel=\r\ny).&nbsp; Has anyone had real-world&lt;/FONT&gt;\n&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=3D2&gt;&gt;experienc=\r\ne with this?&nbsp; I am not trying to be a skeptic just for&lt;/FONT&gt;\n&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FON=\r\nT SIZE=3D2&gt;&gt;skepticism&#39;s sake.&nbsp; I want to be convinced.&lt;/FONT&gt;\n&lt;/P&gt;=\r\n\n\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=3D2&gt;Yes, I have had real-world experiences that convinced m=\r\ne of the value of unit tests for documentation.
