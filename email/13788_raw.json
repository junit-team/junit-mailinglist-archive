There has been a lot of discussion of 100\n&gt; errors &#39;sudden=\r\nly&#39; showing up, and most seem to think this to\n&gt; be a rare thing,...which l=\r\ned me and others to question the\n&gt; size of the development group or code ba=\r\nse. So, my first\n&gt; question, is what is a &#39;development team size&#39; threshhol=\r\nd for\n&gt; meaningful Unit Testing?  At what point do you think there\n&gt; are to=\r\no many cooks in the kitchen,...or is there no\n&gt; threshhold, assuming that y=\r\nour team sticks to the tenets of\n&gt; TDD/XP/Agile/&#39;general good coding practi=\r\nces&#39;?\n\nJutta Eckstein, who is experienced in team sizes around a hundred of=\r\n\ndevelopers, is known for saying that *especiall* for larger teams she find=\r\ns\nAgile practices to be vital. I haven&#39;t read her book yet, but it seems to=\r\n\nalso contain some advice on testing:\nhttp://www.jeckstein.de/agilebook/ind=\r\nex.html\n\n&gt; Additionally,\n&gt; my team has been struggling with maintaining our=\r\n tests at\n&gt; green bar, so my second question is what is a &#39;code size\n&gt; (num=\r\nber of classes)&#39; threshhold for meaningful Unit Testing?\n\nThe larger the co=\r\nde base, the more important automated focussed tests seem\nto be to me.\n\n&gt; W=\r\ne have upwards of 10 developers working on ~1500 classes.\n&gt; Our tests are a=\r\n pain to maintain\n\nWhat specific pain(s) are you experiencing? Can you give=\r\n examples? Why do\nyou think it has something to do with the size of the pro=\r\nject?\n\n&gt; - takes too long to run\n&gt; completely in Eclipse before checking in=\r\n;\n\nThere are too solutions here:\n\n- don&#39;t always run them all,\n- speed them=\r\n up\n\nNot having them doesn&#39;t look like a valid option to me, unless the sys=\r\ntem\ndoesn&#39;t have to work (which would make me wonder why you develop it at =\r\nall).\n\n&gt; takes ~6 hours to run\n\nWhy are they taking that long?\n\n&gt; and repor=\r\nt the nightlybuild (includes coverage testing);\n\nHow much time is coverage =\r\ntesting consuming? What value does it have for\nyou?\n\n&gt; we&#39;re nowhere near g=\r\nreen bar, so recognizing when there is\n&gt; something new (from yesterday) is =\r\nnear impossible, and\n&gt; possibly impractical (in a 40 hour work week). I&#39;m n=\r\not\n&gt; necessarily looking for any answers,...but maybe someone has\n&gt; some in=\r\nsight - has been there before - or will just commisserate with\n&gt; me.  :) \n\n=\r\nWe have around half a million lines of code (don&#39;t know the number of\nclass=\r\nes), but only 4500 unit tests (it&#39;s legacy code, we are adding tests\nslowly=\r\n). The full test suite takes several minutes to run, a full build\nroughly a=\r\nn hour. The full build is executed continuously by a Cruise Control\nserver.=\r\n\n\nBefore committing, I typically run only the suites of modules I have chan=\r\nges\nin (the code is distributed over 80+ modules). The suite for a module\nt=\r\nypically only takes a couple of seconds to run. (I hope the continuous\ntest=\r\ning plugin will soon work with the lates stable build of Eclipse again.)\n\nT=\r\nhe tests that take the most amount of time are those for parsing XML. I\ngue=\r\nss if it would become a problem, we probably could improve those.\n\nHope thi=\r\ns helps giving you some context and ideas...\n\nTake care, Ilja\n\n\n",
