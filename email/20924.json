In my own practice I rely on<br/>\nintuition and experience to evaluate them.<br/>\n <br/>\nThinking aloud:<br/>\n  * Cost--you can certainly measure the runtime of tests, the number of<br/>\nlines of code required to set up the test, and the frequency with which the<br/>\ntest needs attention. These are all a posteriori measures, though. I&#39;m not<br/>\nsure how you would estimate them beforehand with any precision.<br/>\n  * Stability--again, this is possible to measure after the fact, but I<br/>\ndon&#39;t see how to estimate it objectively. Techniques like partial validation<br/>\nare helpful with interfaces that are likely to be unstable, like XML, PDF,<br/>\nor HTML.<br/>\n  * Reliability--and again, you could measure this after the fact by, for<br/>\nexample, tracing the execution of the code invoked by a test and counting<br/>\nthe number of conditionals and polymorphic messages. <br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;ve given up on trying to objective about evaluating these factors. My gut<br/>\ngives me reasonable feedback in my daily work. If someone comes up with<br/>\neffective prediction, I&#39;d like to hear about it, though.<br/>\n <br/>\nRegards,<br/>\n <br/>\nKent Beck<br/>\nThree Rivers Institute<br/>\n<br/>\n  _____  <br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>] On Behalf Of<br/>\nKamal Ahmed<br/>\nSent: Monday, September 22, 2008 5:52 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [junit] Where to test?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKent,<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is fantastic. I could never put into words these concepts we struggle<br/>\nwith every day<br/>\nas eloquently.<br/>\nI would like to know though, how can we quantify all three factors.<br/>\nand do it in a fast and efficient way.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n-Kamal.<br/>\n<br/>\n----- Original Message ----<br/>\nFrom: kentb &lt;kentb@earthlink. &lt;mailto:kentb%40earthlink.net&gt; net&gt;<br/>\nTo: junit@yahoogroups. &lt;mailto:junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt; com<br/>\nSent: Monday, September 22, 2008 8:03:23 PM<br/>\nSubject: [junit] Where to test?<br/>\n<br/>\nAll,<br/>\n<br/>\nLast week on succeeding days I encountered two situations, one where<br/>\nsystem-level tests were valuable and unit tests would have been useless and<br/>\none where the reverse was true. Since simply the level of the tests is not<br/>\nsufficient to decide where to test, I thought a bit more about how I should<br/>\ndecide where to test. I came to three criteria:<br/>\n* The cost of writing and running the test<br/>\n* The stability of the interface the test is, errr..., testing<br/>\n* The reliability of the code satisfying the test<br/>\n<br/>\nI wrote this up in a little paper:<br/>\nwww.threeriversinst itute.org/ WhereToTest. html.
