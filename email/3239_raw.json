I have been working with JUnit for a few weeks now but \n&gt;continue to struggle with one issue.  it seems to me there is tension \n&gt;between unit testing and my preferred API.  for a given class I would \n&gt;like to expose only a handful of methods, yet do not want to forfeit \n&gt;testing my private methods.  my feeling is that I should be concerned \n&gt;with continually testing those methods, and yet fail to see why I \n&gt;should expose methods which are meaningless outside the &quot;blackbox&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt;perhaps I am missing something obvious about good design.\n\nIt has been said that OO unit testing, writing code test-first, and applying\nthe XP simplicity rules ( see\nhttp://www.xprogramming.com/xpmag/expEmergentDesign.htm ) tends to result in\nsmaller classes with public methods.\n\nBasically, you refactor a class that has lots of private methods into\nmultiple classes with mostly public methods.
