Both worked fine, so use which ever you like.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy preference is to put the test in the same directory as the class.  <br/>\nI like this because it reduces the number of clicks I have to make in <br/>\nmy IDE (JBuilder) to get from production class to test class.  When <br/>\nyou are developing in a test-first fashion, you will frequently <br/>\nswitch between the test code and the production code.  By putting <br/>\nthem in the same directory this makes it easier to navigate in the <br/>\nIDE.  Yes, this mixes production and test files together.  However it <br/>\nis very easy to seperate them in a build script (if you use a simple <br/>\nnaming convention for test files).  Since you will spend more of your <br/>\nwork day navigating between source files than seperating out test <br/>\ncode, I chose to optimize the # of clicks I had to make in the IDE by <br/>\nputting files in the same directory.<br/>\n<br/>\nI use the following naming convention:<br/>\n  Someclass.java<br/>\n  SomeclassT.java // the unit test<br/>\n  SomeclassM.java // a mock object of Someclass<br/>\n<br/>\n- Greg</div>",
