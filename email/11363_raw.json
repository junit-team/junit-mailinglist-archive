I\ninstalled junit on my pc and was also able to run the\nsample test, but when ever I try to write my own test\nI get stuck. I understand that the main class has to\nextend TestCase and the suit() has to be initiated in\nmain. Also, I understand what setup() and teardown()\ndoes.\n\nIf I can know the basic structure of the program I am\ntrying to write, that will be absolutely great. I need\na jump start.\n\nThanks,\nWanni.\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo! Mail - You care about security. So do we.\nhttp://promotions.yahoo.com/new_mail\n\n\n",
