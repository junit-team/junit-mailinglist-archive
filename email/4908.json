(Besides, this isn&#39;t really a JUnit question.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Now my test methods get quite large. &lt;snip /&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>First question: is there much raw code duplication in these tests? Start with <br/>\nduplication within a single test method -- does removing duplication make the <br/>\ntest smaller or simpler? Next look at duplication in a collection of test <br/>\nmethods -- can you factor out duplication from four or five test methods? If <br/>\nso, does that make the tests smaller?<br/>\n<br/>\nNext question: is there conceptual duplication in these tests? Do tests A, B <br/>\nand C make essentially the same assertions? You may think you&#39;re being <br/>\nthorough, but you may be doing too much by asserting the same things in a <br/>\nnumber of tests. I&#39;ve done this and I&#39;m learning to identify and challenge <br/>\nit. Trying moving the duplicated assertions to one test and let the others <br/>\nsimply assert on what&#39;s different, rather than the same old thing.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Would you rely on some orientation of created tiles, e.g. assume the <br/>\n&gt; left turning road is always constructed as from east turning to south <br/>\n&gt; (maybe this is like the Blackbox / Whitebox discussion)?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Perhaps this will help get you going until you think of something better. <br/>\nSometimes you have to make assumptions to make the tests workable in size and <br/>\nscope. If you have one test that shows that it doesn&#39;t matter which <br/>\norientation the left-turning road has, then for the remaining tests, one left-<br/>\nturning road is as good as another. If that changes, though, then you have to <br/>\nremember: aha! The south-to-west road might behave differently! I should add <br/>\na test!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Would you even allow incomplete tests (not testing what is &quot;most <br/>\n&gt; likely working&quot;, e.g. assuming a tile does not have special items)?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Test until fear turns to boredom. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJ.
