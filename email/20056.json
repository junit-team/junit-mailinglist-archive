Thanks for taking the first<br/>\n&gt; steps.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hi Joel, thank you for taking the time to try Crap4j and for having<br/>\nthe courage to present it to your colleagues despite its provocative<br/>\nname :-).<br/>\n<br/>\nWe fully expect the metric and the formula to change and evolve as<br/>\npeople use it and gain experience with it. As you recognized, this is<br/>\njust the first step.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; One question which I&#39;ve heard multiple times is, &quot;Now what?&quot; I think<br/>\n&gt; it would be great if the web site had content (even if wiki-mediated)<br/>\n&gt; describing common patterns / code structures which cause a high<br/>\n&gt; C.R.A.P. index and suggestions for corrective action. Many of my<br/>\n&gt; co-workers don&#39;t spend their days thinking about cyclomatic complexity<br/>\n&gt; and don&#39;t want to start by reading up on graph theory. Ergo a few<br/>\n&gt; &quot;case study&quot; examples would be helpful, showing before-and-after code<br/>\n&gt; where C.R.A.P. index drops and the resulting code is clearly more<br/>\n&gt; maintainable.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Thank you for taking us to task on this one. Once I get done with my<br/>\nofficial responsibilities at work this week, I&#39;ll take some time to<br/>\nwrite an FAQ for the tool.  In the meantime, I think that explaining<br/>\ncyclomatic complexity as &quot;too may ifs or loops&quot; in a single method<br/>\nmight do the job.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Finally, I&#39;d really like to be able to get more information on how the<br/>\n&gt; testing measurement is derived (and the resulting side-effects). In<br/>\n&gt; one project with lots of unit tests, including some which persisted<br/>\n&gt; results to disk, the output directories were left in a state I did not<br/>\n&gt; expect/understand. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The only &#39;side effect&#39; should be a directory/subdirectory containing<br/>\ncode coverage and complexity data + the files for the report<br/>\n(including an index.html).  You should be able to remove them anytime<br/>\nfrom Eclipse.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Knowing some of the basics here would be helpful to<br/>\n&gt; someone who wants to take effective action as a result of the<br/>\n&gt;reported index.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>We are planning a quick web demo to show how to install and run<br/>\nCrap4j, how to analyze the results and how to improve then.  I plan to<br/>\nhave it before Thanksgiving.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Again, thanks for your work on the tool. I hope to see more from it.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Thanks again for your for the feedback.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlberto</div>",
