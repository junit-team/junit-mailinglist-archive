Glad to hear from you again.\n&gt; Long time since JavaOne and JavaWorld.\n&gt;\nI wondered if that was you. THE Eric Armstrong.\n\n&gt; It&#39;s good to know that I wasn&#39;t the only one confused by the\n&gt; overloading of the word &quot;test&quot;. My next major hurdle is getting\n&gt; a good handle on the process of TDD -- the paradigm shift\n&gt; looks as big as shyifting into O-O thinking. (I seem to be having\n&gt; as much trouble doing it, at least.)\n&gt;\n&gt; Altima looks pretty interesting. I like the separation of reporting\n&gt; from testing, and the runpath idea. The short summary doesn&#39;t\n&gt; really tell me what a recipe file is good for, though. I guess I need\n&gt; to know more about the possible &quot;run properties of a particular\n&gt; suite&quot;, and why I would want to use them.\n&gt;\nA recipe file contains all the ingredients and instructions needed to \nrun a test. It currently includes a runpath, a set of Suites and/or \nTestCases to run, and a list of Reporters. So for example, if you have \n5 or 6 different tests you like to run, you can save their recipes in 5 \nfiles, put shortcuts to those files as icons on your desktop, then \ndouble click on the icons to run the tests.\n\nBy next week, though, I expect to add the notion of context properties \nto the recipe. If you want to run the same test on different databases, \nfor example, you can place custom properties in the recipe that \nindicate which database to use. The recipe is what I&#39;m planning will be \nthe primary way to pass context to tests. I&#39;m hoping to get an article \nout on passing context to tests on March 3.\n\n&gt; Most of all, I&#39;m looking forward to understanding more about\n&gt; how it &quot;can help developers create unit and conformance tests&quot;.\n&gt;\nSuiteRunner is like JUnit in a lot of ways. You can use it to run JUnit \ntests, but you can also use it standalone. I originally started writing \nit for a conformance test I needed to do, but the project sort of got \naway from us and ended up more generic.\n\n&gt; ...And to understanding more about how to do TDD well in the\n&gt; first place.\n&gt;\nThere&#39;s also a testdrivendevelopment Yahoo group:\n\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/testdrivendevelopment/\n\nbv\n--\nBill Venners\nArtima Software, Inc.\nhttp://www.artima.com\n\n\n",
