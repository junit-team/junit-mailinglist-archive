I am new to JUnit annotations.\n\nI have a need to execute a set of classic account registration tests:   \nregister a user by [email, password], verify that that succeeds, then  \nimmediately follow this with an identical registration with the same  \n[email, password], which should fail because the account already  \nexists.  This is a specific case of a more general scenario where the  \nfirst test develops state the second test needs to know about.\n\nIt occurred to me to use a single test class, containing two @Test- \ndecorated methods:  register() and dupRegister().  The problem with  \nthis structure is that I found no documentation that indicates that  \nthe first decorated test method is executed after the second decorated  \ntest method.  I also considered using the Parameter annotation, with  \nduplicate [email, password] provided as the parameter list.  While  \nthat could drive the tests, I see no way of indicating in this scheme  \nthat the first test invocation should succeed, while the second should  \nfail.\n\nWould someone be kind enough to sketch a reasonable, &quot;JUnit way&quot; to  \napproach this.\n\nThanks.\n\n\n",
