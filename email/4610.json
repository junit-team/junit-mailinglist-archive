    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1909347937\">Yep. The contract specifies what the class/method guarantees about its<br/>\nstate and output given entry state. Unit tests are a tangible form of that<br/>\nguarantee and are, in the end, what you can actually rely on to be<br/>\ncorrect. Design-By-Contract (provided by Eiffel, Java with iContract, or<br/>\nmethodical use of assertion constructs) adds the additional guarantee that<br/>\na call will not succeed if the contract is broken, making it much easier<br/>\nto locate problems.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrian Marrick makes the distinction between preconditions and checked<br/>\npreconditions. There are some conditions that are required for the<br/>\ncontract to hold but which the method either cannot check, cannot check<br/>\nefficiently, or simply elects not to check. In this case, the<br/>\nresults are usually given as &#39;undefined&#39;. Checked preconditions on<br/>\nthe other hand, can be expected to signal a particular error and generally<br/>\nto exit gracefully. Unit tests can and should verify that violations of<br/>\nchecked preconditions do, in fact, fail.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Wed, 3 Apr 2002, David V.
