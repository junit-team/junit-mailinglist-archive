That way I tested my code <br/>\nat the same time I was learning how to use the 3rd party API. I&#39;ve been <br/>\nworking this way more or less satisfactorily. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut somethig feels wrong with it, when I test this way I have less confidence <br/>\nthan with my other classes which are really unit tested. Also, when a test <br/>\nfails it&#39;s significantly harder to find the error because I don&#39;t know if it <br/>\nis in the code or in my understanding of the API.<br/>\n<br/>\nRecently, I read about Learning Tests and have started using them for the <br/>\nabove situation. Now I&#39;m starting to do this:<br/>\n1) Make Learning Tests of the 3rd party API I&#39;m about to use until I <br/>\nunderstand completely the part I&#39;m about to use.<br/>\n2) Make unit tests of my code which uses the 3rd party API in a regular TDD <br/>\nstyle. This tests can now do more intensive checking such as that the correct <br/>\ncalls to the 3rd party API are being done.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunately, I&#39;ve not found a way to do this everytime, because the 3rd <br/>\nparty API must have MockObjects or they must be easy to construct, which is <br/>\nnot always true.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome other side effects of using Learning Tests before using 3rd party APIs <br/>\nare:<br/>\n- They serve as documentation for other developers of the team. When many of <br/>\nthe team developers use this technique, you end up with a very useful <br/>\nautotested library of examples of the 3rd party API.<br/>\n- They help to spot the differences in behaviour when there is a new version <br/>\nof the 3rd party API.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\n\tJorge</div>",
