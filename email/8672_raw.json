I will try different jvms. I was running\n1.4.1_02 on linux.\n\n&gt; Why do you want to run unit tests in JWS?\n&gt; Won&#39;t the JWS startup time and the deployment slow\n&gt; down unit testing to much?\n\nCall me crazy, but I though it would be cool to provide a link so that\nuser&#39;s on a platform that I don&#39;t have access to ( Mac OS X for\nexample ) could click a link in the application or from the project\nhomepage and see all the unit tests run on their machine.\n\n99% of the time the tests would be run from an ant script, within the\napplication&#39;s help menu, IDE, or command-line, but once in awhile it\nis handy to run the tests without checking out from CVS, installing\ndependent libraries, etc.\n\nI guess I was thinking of it as the webstart version of \n&#39;make test&#39;\n\nThanks again for your time.\n\n\n",
