I appreciate them all.\n&gt;\n\nJ.B.,\n\nRest.  There are lots of good folks lurking on this list that are able to pick up the slack.  If not, those asking the questions will find answers on their own and then become the answerers.\nIt&#39;s emergent.  When you&#39;ve had ample time to recharge, I&#39;m confident you&#39;ll be even more valuable to this list and your other endeavors.\n\nThanks for all the time and energy you&#39;ve already contributed to this community.  I appreciate it.  More importantly, I hope it&#39;s been rewarding for you.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nMike\n\n--\nMike Clark\nClarkware Consulting, Inc.\nhttp://www.clarkware.com\n720.851.2014\n\n\n\n",
