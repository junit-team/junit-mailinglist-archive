All it takes is a database and distributed\ncomputing (finding a distributed object is expensive) to blow it out\nof the water in my opinion.\n\nAgain, thanks for all the replies!\n\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;alpanhell&quot; &lt;alpanhell@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hello,\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve just started using junit and I have a question about usage.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m a bit concerned that I&#39;m not understanding something that seems\n&gt; pretty integral to the design of junit.  setUp() and tearDown() are\n&gt; called before and after every test, yet in all my TestCase&#39;s I&#39;m\n&gt; creating I&#39;m finding no place where I need the same setup and teardown\n&gt; before every test within that TestCase.  I can&#39;t think of very many\n&gt; scenarios where this would be useful, yet I&#39;m finding tons of places\n&gt; where I need a one time setup and teardown for the whole TestCase.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Am I missing something here?\n&gt; \n&gt; thanks!\n&gt; \n&gt; allen\n\n\n\n\n\n",
