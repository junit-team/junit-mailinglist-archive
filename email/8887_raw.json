As far as I\n      understand unit testing using an xUnit framework and as part of the XP\n      process.  The existence of test interdependencies (outside of thread\n      testing) is a code smell which is avoided.  If the xUnit framework\nwere\n      to support the concept of dependencies it would be promoting a\nspecific\n      code smell which it is intende to avoid.\n\nI don&#39;t think a truer word has been spoken in this thread.  I think you are\nspot on. I think I trod in some &quot;test *content* dependency&quot; stigma, when I\nwas discussing run order &quot;test dependency order&quot;, which I don&#39;t feel is the\nsame.\n\nI am not saying my tests depends upon the run of another, no side effects, I\nam saying &quot;if my fruit class fails why bother testing my apple class? It has\na rotten core.&quot; It kinda goes back to Bertrand Russell... If I know fruit is\nbad, then the fact that apple succeeds doesn&#39;t make it a healthy apple, it\nis unknown.\n\nStill, I don&#39;t think the idea has a chance of a fair hearing.\n\n          In Kent Beck&#39;s book Test Driven Development by Example one of the\nTDD\n          patterns is called Isolated Test,  he asks the question: &quot;How\nshould the\n          running of your tests affect one another?&quot; and answers himself:\n&quot;Not at\n          all.&quot;  If you have to test a series of functions as a group which\nhave\n          to all be completed to constitute success, then do those all in\none\n          testFunction.\n\nI agree in principle. That said, I tests in layers, building on each other.\nI can&#39;t put 1000 tests in one testcase, just as I would put 1000 class in\none package. I just wanted to bring run order through simple statements of\ndependency. I think you see what I was saying, and you&#39;ve explained why I am\ngetting nowhere.\n\n      That really is it.  No dependency concept exists, because it is\n      something to discourage.  Dependencies are a sign that the code needs\n      more decoupling and more refactoring.\n\nPoint taken on discouragement, and boy -- yes -- I&#39;ve felt that. ;-)\n\nI think test content dependency is wrong, but not what I am saying. Either\nthat, or you decouple yourself from everything you do, a purist goal of no\nreal world value. Code used code, that is a dependency.\n\n      In the example, in Kent&#39;s book he relays the experience of having a\ntest\n      suite that would run overnight, and sometimes nothing would break and\n      other times he&#39;d get a printout of many pages with all of his bugs.\nIt\n      turned out that the large printout usually meant one test failed and\n      caused cascading failures through the rest of the tests due to\n      dependencies.\n\nThis is all about test content dependency -- side effects -- and I never\nmeant that. Why get a fruit basket full of errors when fruit is bad? I was\nactually trying to reduce this mess of an output to &quot;the *possible* root\ncause -- and if nothing else, a place to start cleaning up&quot;.\n\nThanks, you saved me from trying further...\n\nregards\n\nAdam\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
