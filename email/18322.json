In my current situation, I<br/>\nwant to write two tests:<br/>\n1) is a standard operation test where it loads a file and makes sure<br/>\neverything was sent properly to Oracle.<br/>\n2) is a specialized test where it loads a file and checks to see if<br/>\nthe site code was capitalized in Oracle.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo my question is this, should I use individual files for each test<br/>\n(i.e., one file containing many lines of site data for the first test<br/>\nand then a seperate file containing a single line with a lowercase<br/>\nsite code) and load each file at the start of each test, or should I<br/>\ncombine the data from both into a single file and load that before all<br/>\nthe tests are run (using a @BeforeClass)?<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you in advance.</div>",
