The test methods are bound to the\nsetup methods ie. they expected the setup to have generated some values\nwhich the test methods use for asserts. \nNow I want to change one particular setup method to set up the values\ndifferently so that I can test a different functionality, here I am\ntrying to check if a proper exception is raised. The approach I trie was\nI made a sub-class of the BaseTest say ExtendedTest and here I overrided\none of the setup functions and wrote a single test method which will\nassert for exception based on the new setup that was done in the\nExtendtedTest.\nBut when I tried to run the test I found that Junit execute all the\ntests that belonmg to the superClass testCase too and here it uses the\noverrdden setup methods and thus in my case all my super class tests\nfail.\nIs this the expected behavior ? Am I trying the right thing for my\nproblem, is there a cleaner way for my kind of a requirement ?\nPlease advise,\n \nThanks\nChirag \n \n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n",
