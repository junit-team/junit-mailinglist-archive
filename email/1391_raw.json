How did you\n&gt; accomplish it?  In particular, how could you drive a Swing GUI?\n&gt;\n&gt; By &quot;Functional Tests&quot;, I mean tests that check the entire application\n&gt; as a black-box (or very near to black-box testing).  It would launch\n&gt; the appliction, drive the GUI, and interpret the output of the system.\n&gt;\n&gt; My team has been very sucessful with Unit Testing, and we want to\n&gt; advance to running Functional Tests.\n&gt;\n&gt; - Greg\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
