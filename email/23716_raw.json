In https:=\r\n//issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NUTCH-672, you\n&gt; give the example:\n&gt; \n&gt; lew=\r\nis@lewis-01:~/ASF/branch-1.4/runtime/local$ export\n&gt; CLASSPATH=3D$CLASSPATH=\r\n:~/ASF/branch-1.4/src/test\n&gt; lewis@lewis-01:~/ASF/branch-1.4/runtime/local$=\r\n echo $CLASSPATH\n&gt; :/home/lewis/ASF/branch-1.4/src/test\n&gt; lewis@lewis-01:~/=\r\nASF/branch-1.4/runtime/local$ bin/nutch junit\n&gt; org.apache.nutch.fetcher.Te=\r\nstFetcher\n&gt; Class not found &quot;org.apache.nutch.fetcher.TestFetcher&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Thi=\r\ns appears to indicate that you are pointing CLASSPATH to a folder\n&gt; of sour=\r\nce files.  If that&#39;s true, you&#39;re likely to be happier if you\n&gt; point CLASS=\r\nPATH to a folder of .class files, or to a compiled .jar.\n&gt; Good luck,\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n   David\n&gt; \n&gt; On Mon, Sep 26, 2011 at 3:48 PM, lewismc2 &lt;lewis.mcgibbney@..=\r\n.&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Hi list,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m embarking on a pretty monumental JUnit t=\r\nest writing journey as part of a larger vision of improving code integrity =\r\nas well as expanding our testing activities. Before I begin writing the tes=\r\nts I have been working (frustratingly) on this particular Jira issue [1]. I=\r\nn summary, the issue attempts to add the functionality to a script [2] that=\r\n will enable us to test individual test cases from the command line rather =\r\nthan have to run every JUnit test case when we wish to review changes or re=\r\nview performance of new test cases. I am however not getting very far with =\r\nsetting the correct environment variable and could do with some guidance. T=\r\nhe patch which I&#39;m trying to apply would allow us to run\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; bin/nutch =\r\njunit org.apache.nutch.testCase\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; This would then run the specified t=\r\nest case class. I&#39;m positive that my problem is the export classpath enviro=\r\nnment variable which should point to the test case directory. I&#39;m just not =\r\nable to add the class =A0paths, therefore I get an exception and stack trac=\r\ne error (NoClassDef) whenever I try to run a test case.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Finally, ju=\r\nst to clarify, I&#39;m using the TestRunner class to run the tests.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Any=\r\n help, guidance etc would be greatly appreciated as it will enable me to pr=\r\nogress with writing and fixing some 20-30 test classes. If I can provide an=\r\ny more information please advise.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thank you in advance\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Lewi=\r\ns\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; [1] https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NUTCH-672\n&gt; &gt; [2] https=\r\n://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/nutch/trunk/src/bin/nutch\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; -----=\r\n-------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
