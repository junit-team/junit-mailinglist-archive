But I&#39;m not sure<br/>\n&gt; if I should use the DirectoryBuilder, or if I should manually maintain a<br/>\n&gt; class that launches my tests, or use annotations.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It looks like there is a way to simply annotate the classes I want to run<br/>\n&gt; and then to be able to kick off various test suites. But the docs don&#39;t have<br/>\n&gt; many examples of this. And it seems like there are many ways to do the same<br/>\n&gt; thing.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The cookbook just mentions using JUnitCore.runClasses(TestClass1.class,<br/>\n&gt; ...), but that doesn&#39;t seem very extendable.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m just looking for a simple best practice. I&#39;d like to not have to update<br/>\n&gt; a main() method each time I want to add a new test class. I&#39;d like to simply<br/>\n&gt; kick off one or another suite of test classes from my IDE in most cases and<br/>\n&gt; get a nicely printed result printed to the console.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks!<br/>\n&gt; David<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nWomen have complained until they got what men had, then they complained<br/>\nbecause it wasn&#39;t what they thought it was.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>",
