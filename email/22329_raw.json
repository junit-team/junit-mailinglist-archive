That&#39;s the easy\nproblem.  I just want to be able to define the test once, and have it\nautomatically run on each attribute-each run being counted as a separate\ntest.\n\n \n\nIn short I&#39;m not sure about how suites and such work with JUnit 4.  I\nhad a tenuous grasp on it with JUnit 3, but found out quickly that many\nassumptions in the code made my old solution a hack.  One such symptom\nis that I had to create a dummy &quot;testSomething()&quot; method just to get\nJUnit to run the suite.\n\n \n\nThink in terms of a test &quot;macro&quot; that is applied automatically to a set\nof classes.  Using the example provided in the original email, I want to\nmake JUnit find all the classes that extends the Listenable base class,\ncollect the attributes, and perform the test on those attributes.\n\n \n\nI&#39;m just not that sure of how the right way to go about it is.  I&#39;m a\nlittle gun shy based on my prior experience, and I&#39;m thinking that a\nlittle guidance to address this is best.\n\n \n\nThe same type of solution would work well for automatically testing the\nimplementations of certain interfaces to ensure they are behaving as the\ninterface is designed.\n\n \n\nFrom: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of\nGeorg\nSent: Thursday, January 28, 2010 9:25 AM\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: [junit] Re: Making good use of testing effort\n\n \n\n  \n\nHi!\n\nI hope I understand correctly that you want to ensure that the listeners\nare getting the right calls.\n\nIf yes, you should look into extensions like jmock, easymock,...\n\nCheers,\nGeorg\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com &lt;mailto:junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt; ,\n&quot;Loritsch, Berin C.&quot; &lt;berin.loritsch@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ve got a challenge that I&#39;m not sure how to approach with JUnit 4.\n&gt; I&#39;ve sort of hacked something similar in JUnit3, but there were some\n&gt; inelegant things about it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Basic problem is that I have a bunch of setters and getters on my\ndomain\n&gt; models that have predictable side effects. Essentially, the model has\na\n&gt; listener infrastructure and if the user changes the value of the class\n&gt; attribute the appropriate event is supposed to fire. The typical\n&gt; setter/getter looks like this:\n&gt; \n&gt; class MyBean extends Listenable {\n&gt; String value;\n&gt; \n&gt; public String getValue() {\n&gt; return value;\n&gt; }\n&gt; \n&gt; public void setValue(String newValue) {\n&gt; fireAttributeChangedEvent(&quot;value&quot;, value, newValue);\n&gt; value = newValue;\n&gt; }\n&gt; }\n&gt; \n&gt; I need to test that the setters fire the appropriate event, and that\nthe\n&gt; event attribute name is correct. I want a test harness to essentially\n&gt; collect all the setters and getters and change the value to ensure\nthat\n&gt; the event is sent as expected. Then I want to run that against all my\n&gt; domain models.\n&gt; \n&gt; My understanding is that I need to generate a suite, and add the test\n&gt; instances to that suite. I&#39;ve upgraded to JUnit 4 because I think it\nis\n&gt; designed better. I&#39;m just at a loss as to how to start. With JUnit 4,\n&gt; individual tests are marked with an annotation.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
