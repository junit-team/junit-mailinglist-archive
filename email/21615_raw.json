In\nmy mind, Hamcrest is a completely new way to write all the JUnit\nasserts.   Having to go back to assertTrue makes me wonder what other\nfeatures of the old asserts are not replicated in Hamcrest.  In\naddition, it reminds me of how much I didn&#39;t like old assert model J,\nparticularly how I could never remember where the expected and actual\nvalues went in the assertEqual functions J (back when I first learned\nJUnit, Eclipse hadn&#39;t yet been invented, and we coded in Emacs using the\nold JUnit test runner from 3.x).\n\n \n\n&gt;Let me take this in a different direction. I&#39;ve wanted, for a while,\n&gt;to be able to say\n&gt;\n&gt;assertThat(list).isEmpty();\n&gt;\n&gt;Using imposterization, this is possible to write, and gives the\n&gt;wonderful bonus that failure messages can be hamcrest-level\n&gt;informative, like:\n&gt;\n&gt;Expected: x.isEmpty()\n&gt;Actual: x = [a, b, c]\n\n\n\nThis looks like a wonderful idea, most certainly because it allows users\nto use all of Hamcrest without having to write thousands of &quot;import\nstatic&quot; statements.  Also, it seems like it would be much easier to find\nall the Hamcrest features because they would all be available from a\nsingle entry point rather than from multiple classes.  I also like the\nfact that this would make error reporting that much easier.\n\n \n\nRocco\n\n \n\nFrom: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of\nDavid Saff\nSent: Thursday, May 14, 2009 10:46 AM\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: Re: [junit] Missing API: Assert.assertThat(boolean) or\nIsCollection.isEmpty()\n\nRocco,\n\nOn Thu, May 14, 2009 at 10:08 AM, Pigneri, Rocco &lt;rpigneri@...\n&lt;mailto:rpigneri%40mda-data.com&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; First off, I apologize if my formatting makes this e-mail hard to\nread.\n&gt; I have been having trouble getting the formatting to work over the\n&gt; listserv.

One of the great strengths of the Hamcrest\nsystem\n&gt; is the natural readability and self-documentation of the asserts, and\n&gt; the proposed change only enhances that.  It&#39;s important to look at\nthese\n&gt; use cases from the point of view of the user.   For example, in the\n&gt; following examples\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; assertThat(list.isEmpty());\n&gt;\n&gt; assertThat(flagNotSet);\n&gt;\n&gt; assertThat(objectIsNull && listIsEmpty);\n\nIs the intent less clear in\n\nassertTrue(list.isEmpty())?\n\nLet me take this in a different direction.
