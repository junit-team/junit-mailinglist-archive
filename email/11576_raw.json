But it&#39;s impossible and likely incorrect to compare\n&gt;&gt; those results to any other project in any way other than a purely\n&gt;&gt; statistical analysis over many, many projects.  There are far too many\n&gt;&gt; other variables involved when running the tests.\n&gt;\n&gt; Well, as just another people of anecdotal evidence, for both of the\n&gt; largish (more than 1000 unit tests) projects I&#39;ve worked on in the last\n&gt; litte while, we also had all of the unit tests running in 20-30 \n&gt; seconds.\n&gt; (The functional tests took much longer, unsurprisingly--our total test\n&gt; runtime goal was about 10 minutes, which we achieved a most of the\n&gt; time.)\n&gt;\n&gt; Our basic development strategy was this:\n&gt;\n&gt;     1. During development, run just the specific test suite on the\n&gt;     code we were working on. (This took a few seconds.)\n&gt;\n&gt;     2. Before commit, run all unit tests. (This took 20-30 seconds.)\n&gt;\n&gt;     3. Before commit, decide which, if any, functional tests are likely\n&gt;     to be important to run, and run those. (This took 0-3 minutes.)\n&gt;\n&gt;     4. Before commit, if really worried, or the changes are widespread,\n&gt;     or whatever, do a full test run. (10 minutes)\n\nWhich is basically what I said.  Even people whose tests run &quot;fast \nenough&quot; seem to have some need for test organization (usually some sort \nof function-based hierarchy, though sometimes based on test execution \ntime).\n\nAnd it&#39;s certainly better to have a (correct) automatically-generated \nhierarchy than a manually-generated one, for the same reasons you rely \non (insert IDE here) for refactoring rather than doing a query-replace.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; We&#39;d ocassionally get checkins, especially by the junior developers,\n&gt; that broke stuff that they hadn&#39;t run the test for, but it was not that\n&gt; common an occurance, and it was caught pretty quickly, since pretty \n&gt; much\n&gt; everybody was doing a few full test runs per day, anyway. It was a \n&gt; habit\n&gt; to do an update and kick off a full test run before lunch or a coffee\n&gt; break.\n&gt;\n&gt; So we were already using an informal level system, as you can see.\n&gt; Whether it&#39;s worth the bother of formalizing this, I don&#39;t know; I\n&gt; consider it an important part of developer training to learn how to do\n&gt; analysis of what tests should be run, which means that I would prefer\n&gt; that all developers are doing this themselves on a continuous basis,\n&gt; even at the expense of having to deal with the ocassional mistake.\n&gt; That&#39;s the price of learning, after all.\n\nUntil the tools get up to the task, it&#39;s usually *not* worth \nformalizing it.\n\nWould you rather do analysis by reading the code, by examining an \nxref-tracker output, looking at an IDE class hierarchy, or the output \nof a tool dedicated to outlining code/test dependencies for use in \norganizing tests?\n\n\n",
