I am fine till that part as I am able to call the \nappropriate test case entered by the user and am able to display the \nresults on the browser.  \n\nWhat I also need is that, is there a way to determine and print what \ntest case methods are being run.  As in case of the swingui \n(junit.swingui.TestRunner) we have the progress bar indicator that \ntells us how many test cases are run, the failures and errors and the \nstack trace.  Right now I am able to get all the results but once all \nthe test cases have finished running, till then the page displayed to \nthe user is blank.  Is there anyway to dynamically show which method \nin the test case is running and whether its a failure or error or \nsuccess.  Please let me know.\n\nThanks,\nSri\n\n\n",
