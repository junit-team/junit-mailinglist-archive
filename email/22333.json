It includes a bunch of standard stuff that I refactored out into rules and runners and 2 base test classes.  I want to test theses pieces of the &quot;testing infrastructure&quot;, so I wrote some basic JUnit tests that themselves invoke JUnitCore.runClasses directly passing inner classes as the tests.  That part actually works great!  The issue is that when T try to run all the tests, these inner clases are picked up as well.  For example, in <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tinyurl.com/yc6j46y\">http://tinyurl.com/yc6j46y</a> I actually end up getting tests for both FunctionalTestCaseTest and FunctionalTestCaseTest$FixtureTests.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is inside the IDE, when I right click on a package or the test dir and ask it to run tests.  I understand in {build-tool=of-choice-goes-here} I could exclude these inner classes.  Guess I am looking for a general purpose solution that works no matter how the tests are launched.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance :)</div>",
