But first you have to decide which aspect(s) of the gui\n&gt;&gt; you want to\n&gt;&gt; test. For many people, making the gui so stupid that it can&#39;t\n&gt;&gt; possibly break\n&gt; \n&gt; That is in fact the way I do it. But one problem I had was that my model\n&gt; worked alright,\n&gt; but when the GUI components attached themselves as listeners, some things\n&gt; didn&#39;t work anymore...\n&gt; (Such as the collection of listeners being modified during iteration to\n&gt; update the listeners)\n&gt; \n\nCan you state the problem in a few lines of code?\n\n\n-- \nRobert Koss, Ph.D.     | Training, Mentoring, Contract Development\nSenior Consultant      | Object Oriented Design, C++, Java\nwww.objectmentor.com   | Extreme Programming\n\n\n\n",
