In an ideal world, test cases might\nstay separate, but the first hurdle is often just\ngetting developers to write them, and that&#39;s a lot\neasier to manage when the test case lives in the same\npackage as their code.\n\nCo-mingling increases the chances that they&#39;ll use the\ntest case for all of their incremental testing\n(instead of writing little mini-clients or main()\nmethods to test/debug), and helps make unit testing\nseem like part of the development process instead of a\npost-coding chore.  \n\nWe can always auto-repackage stuff later, but in my\nexperience, it&#39;s not always easy to get people to go\nback and write test cases when there&#39;s more\ninteresting work to be done.\n\n(YMMV depending on your team&#39;s experience, and how\nuniformly everybody&#39;s bought into unit testing)\n\nErin\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nGet personalized email addresses from Yahoo!
