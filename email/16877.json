A while back, as the project grew, <br/>\nthere were times when we would break tests (or because we had <br/>\nexternal dependencies that we had to wait and had not yet mocked <br/>\nthings out), tests would fail for a few days before we could get to <br/>\nthem. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis stopped our CI, so we introduced a helper class, TimeBomb. We&#39;d <br/>\nadd a call to TimeBomb with a date and the test would stop failing <br/>\nuntil after the provided date. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt was an active way to remind us go back and fix something in a few <br/>\ndays.<br/>\n<br/>\n@Ignore has a message. What about adding a date? Ignore until the <br/>\ndate, after which the test will fail by throwing a runtime exception?<br/>\n<br/>\nIs that crazy?<br/>\n<br/>\nBrett</div>",
