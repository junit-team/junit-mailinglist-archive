So i create<br/>\na MockStatement and say &quot;ms.setExpectedUpdateCalls(3)&quot;, or something to that<br/>\neffect, and pass it in to my object.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my view, this is tantamount to designing a &quot;probe&quot; which will fit through<br/>\none of the holes in the box (ie conforms to the public interface), thereby<br/>\nallowing us to snoop on what is happening inside the box.... Now, maybe i&#39;m<br/>\njust misunderstanding the terminology, but my gut tells me that this should<br/>\nnot count as &quot;black box&quot; testing.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if this is &quot;black box&quot; testing, what the heck counts as &quot;white box&quot;<br/>\ntesting?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-Brian</div>",
