For<br/>\n&gt;example, somewhere a private long variable becomes 0 because of some<br/>\n&gt;heavy computation and loss of precision (due to / or * for example).<br/>\n&gt;Your unit test may still be ok (first iteration of your methods) but it<br/>\n&gt;may be difficult to simulate the 10,000th iteration, or 1,000,000th<br/>\n&gt;iteration.  Accessing private fields may help you to quickly reset your<br/>\n&gt;classes into some state (like in a debugger).  But maybe JUnit is not<br/>\n&gt;the right tool for this kind of problems.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hm. Not a good answer, but if you&#39;re losing precision after 1M iterations of <br/>\na loop, then you simply gotta have a test for that. If that test takes <br/>\nminutes to run, then it&#39;s entirely possible that your calculation needs to <br/>\nbe broken down into something less costly to test. Without a concrete <br/>\nexample, I can&#39;t say more. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;- when testing, you should ensure that the state of your object is valid<br/>\n&gt;(pre and post conditions).  If you use private variables and don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;expose them via getters, it&#39;s difficult to assert their values (assert<br/>\n&gt;in Jdk1.4 is nice, inner classes are ugly)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>ARGH! This violently breaks the beautiful encapsulation property that helps <br/>\ndefine OO programming. If you want to know whether an object is valid, send <br/>\nit the message &quot;isValid()&quot;. Let the object itself figure that out. If you <br/>\nwant to know whether an object satisfies its pre- and postconditions, the <br/>\nobject itself is the best judge. Send it &quot;verifyPrecondition()&quot; or <br/>\n&quot;verifyPostcondition()&quot;. There is no reason to break encapsulation, which is <br/>\nthe single most well-known anti-OO-pattern out there.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, it&#39;s annoying to add those methods to every object, so judge <br/>\nwhether it&#39;s important. In this one instance, it&#39;s a pity that Java isn&#39;t <br/>\nmore like Eiffel.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe routinely add isValid() methods to our model objects. It&#39;s especially <br/>\nuseful when populating a model object from a ResultSet and from parameters <br/>\nin an HTTP request.<br/>\n<br/>\nJ. B.
