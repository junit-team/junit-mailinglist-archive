I&#39;m currently working\non a=\r\n project in which I had to use JACOB (See here FMI:\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com=\r\n/group/jacob-project/) to access a COM object\nvia Java.  I got my class wor=\r\nking correctly and was quite happy.  \n\nHowever, once I tried to write a JUn=\r\nit test for it, it mysteriously\nceased working.  After spending about a day=\r\n and a half on the issue we\ntried, in desperation, moving the whole shebang=\r\n to another developer&#39;s\nenvironment wherein it worked beautifully.\n\nThat de=\r\nveloper was then tasked with writing the JUnit test, but before\nhe could do=\r\n so he had to apply the JUnit JAR files to his Eclipse\nenvironment.  Immedi=\r\nately the COM accessing class failed once more.\n\nCurious, we uninstalled th=\r\ne JUnit JAR from my environment and lo and\nbehold, the class began working =\r\nagain.\n\nSo, obviously there is some conflict between JUnit and JACOB. I&#39;m\nu=\r\nsing JUnit 3.8.1 and JACOB 1.8.  Any help or assistance would be\ngreatly ap=\r\npreciated.\n\nJV\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
