Israel&quot; &lt;aisrael@g...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Hello, list.\n&gt; \n&gt; Chanced upon this group while Googling for possible solutions to my\n&gt; &#39;dilemna&#39;. It&#39;s not quite so much of a problem, but being OC as we \nare\n&gt; it&#39;s a royal annoyance, and I was hoping the list could help.\n&gt; \n&gt; Background: I&#39;m using Eclipse 3.0.0, Ant 1.6.2 and JUnit 3.8.1\n&gt; (Windoze 2K). The code I&#39;m writing and testing uses Hivemind 1.0 to\n&gt; dynamically create my objects and wire them together.\n&gt; \n&gt; My Eclipse project is set up just fine. The Ant scripts do their\n&gt; thing. Running the &quot;compile-all&quot; target from either within Eclipse \nor\n&gt; via Ant on the command-line is A-OK.\n&gt; \n&gt; A have JUnit tests that run fine when run within Eclipse whether\n&gt; individually or as a suite.\n&gt; \n&gt; I then created a &lt;junit&gt; task within the project&#39;s Ant build scripts\n&gt; to run the suite. When I ran the Ant &quot;test-XXX&quot; targets _from the\n&gt; command line_, everything worked as expected.\n&gt; \n&gt; Here&#39;s the rub: When I run the same Ant targets from _within \nEclipse_,\n&gt; I get a bunch of java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError exceptions (when \nusing\n&gt; the Hivemind stuff).\n&gt; \n&gt; What I&#39;ve noticed is that when I run the test targets in Eclipse, \nthe\n&gt; System property &quot;java.class.path&quot; is missing a couple of \ndirectories,\n&gt; most notably, my project&#39;s ${build} directory.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m still trying to figure out what&#39;s causing this (remember, the\n&gt; build itself works either way, and only the tests are failing in\n&gt; Eclipse) but was wondering if anyone&#39;s done this before or has had \nany\n&gt; similar experiences and might be able to point me to a few leads?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks in advance!\n&gt; Alistair A.
