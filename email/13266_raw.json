If\nthere is a design flaw, we can change it but that is not the case\nhere.  Becoz jUnit does not support inheritance for testing the app\nwhich has deep heierarchy one wouldn&#39;t want to change the design.  But\nthe points that came out of this discussion were good. I would\nsummarize it soon so that it would be beneficial for others..\n\n~JAK\n\nOn Apr 11, 2005 3:43 PM, Andrew McDonagh &lt;andrew.mcdonagh@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;  \n&gt;  Ilja Preuss wrote:\n&gt;  \n&gt;  &gt;Arun J wrote:\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;  \n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;&gt;Thanks folks..Now I have a (kind of) flat structure for\n&gt;  &gt;&gt;tests..with one abstract parent without any testXXX under\n&gt;  &gt;&gt;which all tests would be.  My hierachical requirement is\n&gt;  &gt;&gt;moved out as hierarchical helpers that are creating test\n&gt;  &gt;&gt;objects (similar to ObjectMother pattern suggested by IIja).. how\n&gt;  &gt;&gt;does it sound..? \n&gt;  &gt;&gt;    \n&gt;  &gt;&gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;Doesn&#39;t sound ideal, but like it&#39;s probably the best you can do if you\n&gt; don&#39;t\n&gt;  &gt;want to touch the app&#39;s design.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;  \n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Let us not question the design for testing..\n&gt;  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;        \n&gt;  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;  &gt;&gt;I didn&#39;t mean to be rude here.\n&gt;  &gt;&gt;    \n&gt;  &gt;&gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;No rudeness implied. Still, please notice that not wanting to question the\n&gt;  &gt;app&#39;s design when encountering testing problems is unlikely to lead to\n&gt;  &gt;optimal results. Problems in test design most often just are a result of\n&gt;  &gt;suboptimal app design.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;  \n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;&gt;But I wanted to imply that\n&gt;  &gt;&gt;the app design is done this way for various reasons.\n&gt;  &gt;&gt;    \n&gt;  &gt;&gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;Certainly. I&#39;d bet, though, that it&#39;s possible to find a design that\n&gt;  &gt;conforms to both the needs of testing and those other reasons, and that\n&gt; most\n&gt;  &gt;experienced OO developers would say that such a design is better.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;  \n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;&gt;But the\n&gt;  &gt;&gt;tests has to be written around the existing app design.  The\n&gt;  &gt;&gt;issue in question was the test design not the app design.\n&gt;  &gt;&gt;    \n&gt;  &gt;&gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;Then the issue is how to write unit tests for a suboptimally designed app.\n&gt; I\n&gt;  &gt;hope you can now understand why Junit doesn&#39;t strive to support that very\n&gt;  &gt;well out of the box - most Junit practitioners simply prefer to improve\n&gt; the\n&gt;  &gt;app&#39;s design in those cases.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;Cheers, Ilja\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;  Indeed.  Its always tricky adding unit tests to existing code - made \n&gt;  even harder when that existing code is sub optimally designed.  It would \n&gt;  be worth Arun getting a copy of Micheal feathers book - &#39;Working \n&gt;  Effectively With Legacy Code&#39; .\n&gt;  \n&gt;  One of the important aspects Micheal has identified when retro fitting \n&gt;  tests, is that sometimes the code will have to be made even more \n&gt;  suboptimal to allow testing.  However, once its tested, we can then \n&gt;  start to refactor the design in a safer manner.\n&gt;  \n&gt; http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/beforeClarity.pdf\n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  ________________________________\n&gt;  Yahoo!
