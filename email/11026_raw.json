Is the build failed because the Thread.sleep line was not executed\nor some other failure?\n\nCould you please elaborate a little more?\n\nYining\n\nOn Tue, 2004-05-18 at 01:09, boyfrnd007 wrote:\n&gt; Hi I have written this junit test where one of the tests uses the \n&gt; Thread.sleep method to sleep for a while. When I use the eclipse \n&gt; plugin to run the test, it seems to be working just fine. But when I \n&gt; use the ANT, it says the BUILD failed and it does not execute the \n&gt; Thread.sleep line in one of the tests. Does anyone know why is it \n&gt; doing that? Any help on this matter would be really appreciated.\n&gt; Thanks in advance!\n&gt; Abhishek \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo!
