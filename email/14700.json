Sounds like you have your &quot;Designer&quot; hat on. That wasn&#39;t what I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; understood to be the context of the question. &quot;How do I test a private<br/>\n&gt; &gt; method&quot; is a question someone wearing their &quot;Tester&quot; hat would ask.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Given that context, my mind hasn&#39;t changed. If the private method is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; already tested through an existing public method then you don&#39;t need<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to do anything. In fact, exposing the method and writing an explicit<br/>\n&gt; &gt; test against it is duplication.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Is it really?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; First: the question &quot;How do I test this private method&quot; is a trigger<br/>\n&gt; to me to swap out to my Designer hat - it means that there&#39;s an<br/>\n&gt; abstraction that&#39;s worth taking out.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Second: if it&#39;s already tested _enough_, then there is no need to test<br/>\n&gt; it, is there? But I don&#39;t know why I would ask that question if it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; already tested enough.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thirdly: if it&#39;s not tested enough, then exposing the method and<br/>\n&gt; writing new tests is not duplication - in fact, it can significantly<br/>\n&gt; reduce duplication by removing the need to duplicate extraneous setup<br/>\n&gt; work.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>1) &quot;How do I test this private method&quot; sounds more like a question<br/>\nasked by someone practicing test-after development. If so, you may be<br/>\nright because the entire design is now suspect. <br/>\n<br/>\n2) Exactly. Thank you!<br/>\n<br/>\n3) I disagree. It&#39;s a symptom that TDD discipline is breaking down.<br/>\nCode has been written before a test that needed it. Now&#39;s the time to<br/>\nback away from the current implementation, write the test you /really/<br/>\nwant, and then get to green. <br/>\n<br/>\nRegards,<br/>\nJim</div>",
