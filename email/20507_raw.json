Rainsberger &lt;jbrains762@...&gt;\nAsunto: Re: [junit] Help requ=\r\nested in organizing a TDD learning session\nA: junit@yahoogroups.com\nFecha: =\r\njueves, 29 mayo, 2008, 7:44 pm\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn May 29, 2008, at 14:09 , Mark Levis=\r\non wrote:\n&gt; I&#39;ve been asked to organize a half-day/day long session to h=\r\nelp a team\n&gt; at my organization really learn TDD. They have all been to =\r\na TDD\n&gt; course but for a variety of reasons didn&#39;t learn enough to pick =\r\nup the\n&gt; habit. The developers all think that TDD is a worthy idea but d=\r\non&#39;t\n&gt; know enough to practice it day to day.\n&gt;\n&gt; To make this wor=\r\nthwhile I think we need a more interesting example\n&gt; than the typical fa=\r\nctorial example and a location that encourages\n&gt; pairing. I could start =\r\nwith the team&#39;s existing code and tasks but I\n&gt; think we would spend a l=\r\not of time on non-trivial edge cases without\n&gt; really hitting TDD. Inste=\r\nad I think I will offer to pair with people\n&gt; to tackle these problems.\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m looking for any and all ideas, but have some specific questio=\r\nns:\n&gt; - What example would you use? Brian Marick had mentioned one:\n&gt;=\r\n http://www.exampler .com/blog/ 2007/06/26/ a-workbook- for-practicing- tes=\r\nt-driven- design-draft/\n&gt; but the downloads are broken.\n&gt; - Do you ha=\r\nve an example that would demonstrate any of these difficult\n&gt; issues: ab=\r\nstracting the database, test driving bits of the GUI?\n&gt; - Do you have go=\r\nod examples to help demonstrate Test Driven\n&gt; Refactoring aka Michael Fe=\r\nathers and Legacy code.\n&gt; - Would you go off site? They don&#39;t have a tea=\r\nm room yet.\n&gt; - Would a boardroom setup work well to encourage pairing?\n=\r\n&gt; - How long would you make the session? Half day? Full day?\n&gt;\n&gt; W=\r\nhat would you do?\n&gt;\nI would ask the team whether they want to work on a =\r\nreal feature in \norder to learn TDD. If they do, then iteration 1 is buildi=\r\nng something \nsimple that runs in memory and focuses on the mechanics of TD=\r\nD and a \nfew of the early hiccups. Start with something that involves a han=\r\ndful \nof objects working together. I use an example in my &quot;Architecture \nWi=\r\nthout Trying&quot; demo that shows MVC/MVP emerging without my pushing in \nthat =\r\ndirection, but simply by paying attention to duplication and \nnames. The en=\r\ntire demo takes maybe 2 hours.\n\nAfter they practice for a while, I offer to=\r\n spend an hour doing the \nsame demo, but Presenter-First style, designing t=\r\nhe Model and View \ninterfaces, usually using a dynamic mock framework. This=\r\n takes about \nan hour.\n\nSo I would definitely expect to take an entire day.=\r\n If you can \nidentify a small feature that involves displaying data from a =\r\nmodel, \nthen you can do Architecture Without Trying and it might really \nim=\r\npress them.\n\nIn between the demos, ask them to TDD something--anything --an=\r\nd check \nin with them every 40 minutes or so. By letting them choose, they =\r\nget \nto learn what they need to learn at the moment they need it. After 40 =\r\n\nminutes, spend 10 minutes answering questions or sharing tips and \ntricks =\r\nrelated to observations you made about their progress: common \nquestions, t=\r\nhat kind of thing. Then give them a 10-minute break. \nRepeat this hour as m=\r\nuch as needed.\n\nAs for offsite/onsite, do whatever it takes to give them ro=\r\nom to be \ncomfortable, space to work in pairs, and have a whiteboard or \nfl=\r\nipchart handy.\n\nI hope that helps you.\n\nTake care.\n----\nJ.
