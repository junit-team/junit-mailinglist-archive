Thanks.\n\nOne more basic question.\n\nHow is unit testing different from component testing.\nLet me clarify. Here the component is not something\nlike COM, but a set of C functions with some exposed\nAPIs. Testing includes testing these interfaces and\nfunctionality implemented by this component through\nthese set of C functions.\n\nCurrently the way I test these by writing some test\nstubs. If it is advantageous to move to cppunit/junit\nI would love to do so. Please note that the developer\nof these components is not me.\n\nWould appreciate comments/suggestions.\n\nregards,\n\nJagmohan\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;J. B.
