When you ship\nyour code, you c=\r\nertainly hope there is no bug in it.  I was just responding\nto the claim th=\r\nat &quot;if you don&#39;t TDD your code, you don&#39;t know that it works&quot;\nby saying tha=\r\nt  &quot;there are plenty of ways to know that your code works, and\ntesting is o=\r\nnly one of them&quot; (and an imperfect one at that, as somebody\npointed out ear=\r\nlier in this thread).\n\nTest cases are the only reliable indicator of code q=\r\nuality _and_ code\n&gt; reliability, and because they are automated gives me fa=\r\nr greater\n&gt; confidence in the integrity of the code I write.\n\n\nAbsolutely.\n=\r\n\nIf I&#39;m asked to review some code and tests, I will sit down and read the\nc=\r\node, and asking whether this code was tested using TDD will give me very\nli=\r\nttle clue as to its quality.\n\nKent&#39;s argument has always worked for me - TD=\r\nD when you can, think about\n&gt; it when you can&#39;t.\n\n\nAgreed.  I think that sa=\r\nying &quot;if you don&#39;t do TDD, you don&#39;t know that your\ncode works&quot; is preposte=\r\nrous.\n\nIn my opinion, it&#39;s not as important to &quot;test first&quot; as it is to &quot;te=\r\nst\nsoon&quot;, which sometimes means &quot;first&quot; and other times means &quot;when you thi=\r\nnk\nit&#39;s time&quot;.\n\n-- \nC=E9dric\nhttp://testng.org\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this=\r\n message have been removed]\n\n\n",
