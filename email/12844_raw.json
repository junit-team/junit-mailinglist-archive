This includes\npassing messages from server to client and even implementing some\nfirewall capabilities.\n\nLets take the firewall api provided my Microsoft as an example:\nhttp://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/rras/rr\nas/packet_filtering_functions.asp\n&lt;http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/rras/r\nras/packet_filtering_functions.asp&gt; \n\nIf I implement a simple firewall application that say blocks all\noutgoing http traffic. It would be nice to apply the advantages of JUnit\nto this code also.\n\n \n\nIs this possible?\n\nIf MockObjects are the answer, could somebody please give me a reference\nto some introductory material regarding this.\n\nI&#39;ve done some reading on MockObjects but find all the material hard to\nunderstand and I&#39;m still failing to see how I&#39;m going to apply\nMockObjects to test my network methods.\n\n \n\nThanks again.\n\nPico\n\n \n\n________________________________\n\nFrom: Andrew McDonagh [mailto:andrew.mcdonagh@...] \nSent: 10 February 2005 12:33 PM\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: Re: [junit] Testing certain types of methods\n\n \n\nPico Geyer wrote:\n\n&gt;Hi \n&gt;\n&gt;I&#39;m a little confused on how to test certain types of methods.\n&gt;Is JUnit supposed to be able to test all types of methods.\n&gt;\n&gt;For example how do you test a:\n&gt;1) Method that only modifies private fields and has no corresponding\n&gt;getter method to see if the field is now at the correct value\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\nThere must be some form of change in the system, aside from the internal\n\nprivate fields being modified, use this to verity the public method \nworked as expected.\n\n&gt;2) Methods that work on network traffic, ex counting all TCP packets\n&gt;that I receive. I would need an isolated environment and would need to\n&gt;be able to send X amount of packets to my machine.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\nThis is where MockObjects come into play.\n\n\n\n\n\nYahoo!
