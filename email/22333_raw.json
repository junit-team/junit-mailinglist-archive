It includes a bunch o=\r\nf standard stuff that I refactored out into rules and runners and 2 base te=\r\nst classes.  I want to test theses pieces of the &quot;testing infrastructure&quot;, =\r\nso I wrote some basic JUnit tests that themselves invoke JUnitCore.runClass=\r\nes directly passing inner classes as the tests.  That part actually works g=\r\nreat!  The issue is that when T try to run all the tests, these inner clase=\r\ns are picked up as well.  For example, in http://tinyurl.com/yc6j46y I actu=\r\nally end up getting tests for both FunctionalTestCaseTest and FunctionalTes=\r\ntCaseTest$FixtureTests.  \n\nThis is inside the IDE, when I right click on a =\r\npackage or the test dir and ask it to run tests.  I understand in {build-to=\r\nol=3Dof-choice-goes-here} I could exclude these inner classes.  Guess I am =\r\nlooking for a general purpose solution that works no matter how the tests a=\r\nre launched.\n\nThanks in advance :)\n\n\n",
