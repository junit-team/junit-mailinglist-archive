I\nassume you are able to delete it from Eclipse thou=\r\ngh.\n\n&gt; - I had a lot of tests throwing HeadlessExceptions, which surprised =\r\nme. \n&gt; Something strange with the runner?\n\nOops, we&#39;ll look into that one. =\r\nFeel free to file bugs directly if you\nprefer: http://trac.crap4j.org/newti=\r\ncket\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers, Ilja\n&gt;\n\nThanks again for taking the time Ilja.\n\nAlberto\n=\r\n\nhttp://www.crap4j.com\nKnow your CRAP.
