I connect to a data provider via an IP address. They have \nprovided an API which I implement, and get callbacks from them with \nthe data. I can create a mock of one of their classes - but since \nit&#39;s not hooked up to their IP, there&#39;s no data in it. \n\nI suppose I could decompile their class and put some data in it - but \nat that point, am I really testing my interaction with their classes -\n or with one of my own munging?\n\nThanks for any suggestions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
