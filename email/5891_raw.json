One\nof the comp sci courses has a nice case study of JUnit and design\npatterns:\n\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu/6/6.170/f01/pdf/lecture-17.pdf\n\nMy only comment on the internals of JUnit is that the\ndynamic classloader is beat.  It needs to be reworked\nto remove the excluded.properties hack and prevent\nLinkageErrors and other nastiness that catches users\nby surprise.\n\n\nScott Stirling\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Manuel Amago [mailto:mamago@...] \n[snip] \n&gt; And I suspect that in that remark lies the crux of it.  The \n&gt; common topics that appear when discussing the complexity of \n&gt; JUnit are Suites and Tests, where this is just a typical \n&gt; instantiation of the Composite pattern.  The TestResult is a \n&gt; collecting parameter, and so on.\n&gt; \n&gt; I am one of those people who puts JUnit forward as an example \n&gt; to be followed, and am, so far, unswayed from that position.  \n&gt; My views are based on the code for JUnit 3.7, but I can only \n&gt; imagine that it has gotten better, and not worse in the \n&gt; latest release.\n&gt; \n&gt; As is usually the case when using patterns in code, to the \n&gt; non-initiated any such code may look very complex indeed, and \n&gt; the relationships between the different classes unfathomable. \n&gt;  The benefits for those who do recognise the patterns, \n&gt; however, is great.\n\n\n\n",
