This set of objects is called a test \n&gt; &gt; fixture.&quot;\n\nI haven=\r\n&#39;t said anything in this thread, but, as a former QA professional, I always=\r\n look to the QA gods, G. Myers, B. Beizer or R. Binder for definitions rela=\r\nted to testing.  Developers who haven&#39;t read some of the QA classic literat=\r\nure often sound like dilletantes when they try to speak with authority abou=\r\nt testing concepts and terms.  You never find universal agreement on defini=\r\ntions, but you can at least broaden the investigation beyond what Beck or G=\r\namma said once upon a time.  This comment is about the thread in general, n=\r\not directed specifically at Jim&#39;s comment.\n \n&gt; For the last several months =\r\nI have been working on software that\n&gt; instruments Java classes.  It does t=\r\nhis by adding bytecode to \n&gt; the compiled class as it is being loaded.  The=\r\n software that does\n&gt; this is tested using JUnit.  The class that is delive=\r\nred by the \n&gt; classloader is in fact the main &quot;object&quot; of the test fixture.=\r\n  \n&gt; This class is related to the Java class, the file with the \n&gt; .class e=\r\nxtension, but it is not the same.  Among other\n&gt; things, it is much larger =\r\n:-(\n[snip]\n&gt; In other words, fixtures can include classes, although they \n&gt;=\r\n almost always consist only of objects.\n\nI think you&#39;re equivocating on the=\r\n word &#39;class&#39; here.  Classes are always dealt programmatically in Java via =\r\nthe java.lang.Class object, or, if you&#39;re manipulating the constituent bina=\r\nry data, via an InputStream or some other object.  I think you were right b=\r\nefore, in the general sense: Java deals with objects except for the primiti=\r\nve types.\n\nScott Stirling\nFramingham, MA\n\n*********************************=\r\n**************************************\nThis message is intended only for th=\r\ne use of the intended recipient and\nmay contain information that is PRIVILE=\r\nGED and/or CONFIDENTIAL.
