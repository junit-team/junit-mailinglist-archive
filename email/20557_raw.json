The place where people mess up =\r\nis when they reflexively assume that particular numbers indicate problems a=\r\nnd that there is some sort of moral imperative to confront all perceived pr=\r\noblems. The fact is, there is no linkage there other than what we bring to =\r\nthe table. People and teams have natural rhythms and we have to take care w=\r\nhen we decide what to optimize. \n\nThe fact that people are less productive =\r\non one particular day out of the week would not surprise me. If someone tol=\r\nd me that a team was uniformly productive every day of the week, I&#39;d actual=\r\nly be rather scared of what I might find if I was to visit them.\n\nMichael\n\n=\r\n-----Original Message-----\n&gt;From: Mike Hill &lt;mike@industriallogi &lt;mailto:mi=\r\nke%40industriallogic.com&gt; c.com&gt;\n&gt;Sent: Jun 10, 2008 11:39 AM\n&gt;To: junit@ya=\r\nhoogroups. &lt;mailto:junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt; com\n&gt;Subject: A Note On Data-Ga=\r\nthering (Was Re: [junit] A case for adding logging of assertions to junit)\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;On Tue, Jun 10, 2008 at 10:07 AM, Kent Beck &lt;kentb@earthlink. &lt;mailto:ke=\r\nntb%40earthlink.net&gt; net&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; This is what DevCreek (www.devcreek.com=\r\n) does, and the results are often\n&gt;&gt; surprising. For example, we noticed th=\r\nat on Wednesdays the DevCreek team\n&gt;&gt; itself wrote a quarter of the tests i=\r\nt wrote on other days. Turns out they\n&gt;&gt; were spending most of the day prep=\r\naring for the weekly status meeting.\n&gt;\n&gt;So. Side topic, and favorite horse-=\r\nfloggee of mine: did the metric\n&gt;do anything for us that simply knowing the=\r\n team well wouldn&#39;t have\n&gt;already done? I&#39;m assuming, here, dangerous habit=\r\n, that there was no\n&gt;team-perceived process-weakness on Wednesdays prior to=\r\n the metric. If\n&gt;that&#39;s a valid assumption, dangerous habit admitted, then =\r\nthis would\n&gt;seem to be a case where a metric -- not free -- gave us a false=\r\n\n&gt;positive -- not free -- requiring at least a little bit of\n&gt;investigation=\r\n to determine root cause -- not free. Metrics are\n&gt;scarily complex to me, a=\r\nnd I wish my world had either fewer of them,\n&gt;or fewer people relying on th=\r\nem.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Teams\n&gt;&gt; using DevCreek don&#39;t seem to change their behavior much o=\r\nn the basis of the\n&gt;&gt; feedback, though, which I find surprising. Perhaps th=\r\ne feedback isn&#39;t really\n&gt;&gt; all that useful, perhaps we don&#39;t have the right=\r\n presentation of the\n&gt;&gt; information, or perhaps people just need to get use=\r\nd to the idea that the\n&gt;&gt; information is there for them.\n&gt;\n&gt;Or, another fav=\r\norite equine victim of mine, perhaps people are\n&gt;decidedly less rational th=\r\nan we routinely realize.\n&gt;\n&gt;Of course, once having typed this in, I immedia=\r\ntely jump to another\n&gt;way of seeing it: put scare quotes around &#39;rational&#39;.=\r\n To make this\n&gt;second idea more clear, I&#39;ll say I might have theorized that=\r\n the team\n&gt;would respond (incorrectly) by &#39;rationally&#39; honoring feedback th=\r\nat\n&gt;didn&#39;t meet its -- what words to use here? -- gestalt self-image. In\n&gt;f=\r\nact, the team responded (correctly) by &#39;irrationally&#39; ignoring\n&gt;feedback th=\r\nat didn&#39;t meet that gestalt self-image.\n&gt;\n&gt;A third way in to the puzzle: in=\r\nformation is not useful until it is\n&gt;integrated into a framework of meaning=\r\n. At any given time, any such\n&gt;framework has a loose boundary (the so-calle=\r\nd hermeneutic horizon),\n&gt;which represents the only possible locations where=\r\n new information can\n&gt;be fit. If the boundary is not situated where the new=\r\n information can\n&gt;be fit in, it will be ignored, hence useless. So it pays =\r\nto focus\n&gt;one&#39;s attention not just on generating data, but on generating th=\r\ne\n&gt;data that will fit the current boundary for the current group and\n&gt;enabl=\r\ne that group to become what it wants.\n&gt;\n&gt;This is why I am so negative about=\r\n quests for ever-more-detailed\n&gt;metrics, or one-size-fits-all approaches to=\r\n measuring progress in\n&gt;human enterprise. Down this road lies Taylor, and a=\r\n reversion of some\n&gt;particularly hard won 20th century knowledge. When some=\r\none posts\n&gt;about &quot;what metric is best?&quot;, I wish we could all post back &quot;the=\r\n one\n&gt;that helps your team&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt;I&#39;m reminded of a magnificent insight grant=\r\ned to me by Jerome Bruner,\n&gt;who somewhere remarks that the purpose of thera=\r\npy is not to reveal the\n&gt;truth, but to construct a story which enables the =\r\npatient to move\n&gt;towards his or her goal.\n&gt;\n&gt;Cheers,\n&gt;Hill\n&gt;Wanna learn XP =\r\nskills the hard way?
