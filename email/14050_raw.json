I have written a\n&gt; library\n&gt; of which I need to test one class. The methods exposed by this class\n&gt; cannot be called randomly but by following some rules. For example,\n&gt; there is a method &quot;Connect&quot; which must be invoked before any other\n&gt; method is called. There are additional calls that are related. For\n&gt; example &quot;ChangeHeaders&quot; makes temporary change to some data (after\n&gt; some business logic verification), however this must be followed by a\n&gt; call to &quot;SaveChanges&quot; to persist this data. Whatever I have read\n&gt; about\n&gt; JUnit seems to indicate that the test methods in my test class can be\n&gt; called in any order by the JUnit framework. Is there any way (a\n&gt; pattern) to get around this issue ? Thanks much in advance..\n\nYes, the methods in your test class are not (necessarily) called\nin any particular order. This is a feature. Each test method should\nbe unrelated to the others - otherwise it&#39;s too hard to eg move\nthem around for greater expressivity, call only the failing when\nwhen you want to isolate a problem, &co.\n\nThere are at least two things you can do:\n\n(a) Ensure that each test uses its own object (easy) and that it\n    runs the piece of lifecycle you&#39;re interested in to \n    completion.\n\n(b) Refactor so that this object-state dependency is reduced\n    (preferably to zero).\n\nFor (b) I&#39;d start by fixing the `connect` problem: if nothing\ncan be done withotu a connection, I&#39;d have a more factory-like\nobject with a `connect` method; calling this delivers a connected\nobject.\n\nFor Change/Save, I&#39;d just have the test do the Change and then\nthe Save in the same testXXX() method.\n\n-- \nChris &quot;electric hedgehog&quot; Dollin\nIt&#39;s called *extreme* programming, not *stupid* programming.\n\n\n",
