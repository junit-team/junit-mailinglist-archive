However, for commercial software development, is this<br/>\n&gt; still possible ?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Although I knew JUnit and other JUnit-based open-source tools for a<br/>\n&gt; couple of years, my company and team never really enbrace it. The<br/>\n&gt; major reason is Product Managers always want to add cool features to<br/>\n&gt; the system quickly while programmers find the schedule is always too<br/>\n&gt; tight to spend any extra time to write testing. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I know from the mail list and books that we can take lots of advantage<br/>\n&gt; of JUnit-based testing, I myself have no real hands-on experience on<br/>\n&gt; it. So here are my questions: <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; * Will Junit-based testing make the project time longer or shorter ?<br/>\n&gt; Any hard statistic data ? ( Here I mean commercial project rather than<br/>\n&gt; open-source project. )<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; * One intersting point I found is that after Junit-based testing is<br/>\n&gt; introduced, programmers tend to use IDE debugger much less than<br/>\n&gt; before.  This would save lots of time. Is that true ?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; * Some guys say JUnit is good for biz / util code testing. But for web<br/>\n&gt; application development, where HTML/javascript would be root cause of<br/>\n&gt; lots of bugs, Junit is not so powerful. Any comments ? <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; * How can I convince managers and programmers that JUnit-based is<br/>\n&gt; really possible for commercial software development ? Any differnece<br/>\n&gt; from open-source projects ?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Can some Junit gurus shed some light here ?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks, <br/>\n&gt; - Frank<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Fascinating and very good questions. I will try to address some of them:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt; * Will Junit-based testing make the project time longer or shorter ?<br/>\n &gt; Any hard statistic data ?

Considering that you are least doubling (is this an english verb? <br/>\n:-) ) the quantity of code you write I would say this is the reason. Some people say that this time <br/>\nwill be reduced by less bugs and time spent bug fixing. I would like to agree with this, but <br/>\nunfortunately the projects I have worked on haven&#39;t prooved this true: the kind of bugs caught by <br/>\nunit testing are the easiest. Those real bugs that are screwing the schedules happen in such complex <br/>\nscenarios, that you will not be able to wrap inside tests. And I haven&#39;t mentioned unit tests, that <br/>\nare even more far away from catching these kind of tests.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt; * Some guys say JUnit is good for biz / util code testing.

Any comments ?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Once again I feel I am seeing it differently. I haven&#39;t seen many places where unit testing played <br/>\nan important role in this kind of scenarios. Moving to functional and integration testing, than I <br/>\nagree that some test coverage is good. Now, you need to balance how complex is to put in place such <br/>\nfunctional and integration tests and how are they gonna cut the time.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt; * One intersting point I found is that after Junit-based testing is<br/>\n &gt; introduced, programmers tend to use IDE debugger much less than<br/>\n &gt; before.

Is that true ?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>As I posted in some other mail in this thread, my approach is usually:<br/>\n<br/>\n- think about the problem, set some breakpoints, identify the problem<br/>\n- try to write some test for that =&gt; if you have the tests at this point you have some failures<br/>\n- fix the problem =&gt; than check if the tests pass<br/>\n<br/>\nI am spending the same time amount working with the debugger. The benefit is that afterwards I will <br/>\nfeel a little bit better when going back to fix some other problem in the component, cause I will <br/>\nhave some tests that are guaranteeing I am not introducing regression problems.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt; * How can I convince managers and programmers that JUnit-based is<br/>\n &gt; really possible for commercial software development ?

If you find the answer than let us all know, cause I think everybody is interested :-).<br/>\n<br/>\nI have tried different strategies, but I cannot say why some of them succeded or some of them failed.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would like to end this post, by stating that this represents my own perspective and my own <br/>\nopinions (and is not meant to start a flame).<br/>\n<br/>\ncheers,<br/>\n<br/>\n./alex<br/>\n--<br/>\n.w( the_mindstorm )p.</div>",
