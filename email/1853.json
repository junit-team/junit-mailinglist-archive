It&#39;s likely that any problems you encounter will have already<br/>\nbeen encountered (and solved) by other people and the answers will be in<br/>\nthese archives. That&#39;s certainly been my experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe also started using JUnit recently, but I didn&#39;t have to do much in the<br/>\nway of formal documentation to convince management to support it. It was<br/>\nmore a matter of &quot;hey, look at this really neat way of doing automated unit<br/>\ntesting. Once we had a decent set of automated unit tests, there was no<br/>\nturning back.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this is of some help,<br/>\nPeter</div>",
