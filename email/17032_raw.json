Those pages are very hard to maintain and to refactor.\n\n \n\nMy experience is that it is always best to have JSP concentrated on\ndisplaying data, nothing more.  That includes of course handling more or\nless data structures.  But that should be it.  If there is programming\nlogic that should go into a handler class or a helper class.  With that\ndesign approach you are now on easier to test Java classes.  Now you can\nuse Mock Objects for testing those classes if they are for example\nServlets as handlers.  I think it is always best to move all programming\nlogic that is not concerned about presentation in as much as possible\nPOJOs which are always much easier to test.\n\n \n\nFrom your previous posting I know that you are experimenting with\nCactus.  I never liked that approach because it makes my tests dependent\non a Servlet engine.\n\n \n\nIf you follow my depicted approach and still see the urge to test what\nis left in the JSPs, than use some testing framework like Selenium\n(http://openqa.org/selenium/)\n\n \n\nAndreas\n\n \n\n________________________________\n\nFrom: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of\nTejal Khatri, Gurgaon\nSent: Wednesday, June 28, 2006 6:10 AM\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: [junit] unit testing jsp\n\n \n\nHi,\n\nCan I get sample example unit testing a jsp?\n\nThanks & Regards,\nTejal Khatri\nHCL Technologies,Gurgaon\n9811687996\nDisclaimer:\nThis message and any attachment(s) contained here are information that\nis\nconfidential, proprietary to HCL Technologies and its customers.\nContents\nmay be privileged or otherwise protected by law.
