I&#39;d really like to be<br/>\nable to use the latest version of hamcrest with junit (and I don&#39;t have a<br/>\nlarge test case suite to worry about it).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother question is: if I can use hamcrest 1.2 then is there a junit jar<br/>\nthat doesn&#39;t include the old hamcrest classes?<br/>\n<br/>\ntia,<br/>\n<br/>\n:- alex<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Wed, Aug 18, 2010 at 4:47 AM, David Saff &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:david@...\">david@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On Tue, Aug 17, 2010 at 6:28 PM, pniederw &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pniederw@...\">pniederw@...</a>&lt;pniederw%40gmail.com&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve noticed that JUnit includes an (outdated) version of Hamcrest. Will<br/>\n&gt; future JUnit version continue to ship with Hamcrest?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yes, having made this decision, we&#39;ll stick to it until convinced it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; doing more harm than good.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Do you have plans to update to Hamcrest 1.2 or higher?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Unfortunately, the last time we looked at the typing changes in<br/>\n&gt; Hamcrest 1.2, we found that we couldn&#39;t automatically upgrade people<br/>\n&gt; without changing compiling tests into non-compiling tests, and, if I<br/>\n&gt; remember, in a few pathological cases, passing tests into failing<br/>\n&gt; tests. We guessed that of people who used the hamcrest features<br/>\n&gt; bundled with JUnit, there were more that would be hurt by a version<br/>\n&gt; change than would be helped by it, so we&#39;ve stayed here.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Why is there no junit-dep anymore, i.e. how are we supposed to use JUnit<br/>\n&gt; with Hamcrest 1.2?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; junit-dep has been up on github for every release. Whoever has been<br/>\n&gt; putting JUnit up on maven, I take it, hasn&#39;t been also putting up<br/>\n&gt; junit-dep? I&#39;m sorry to say that I&#39;m very aware that a lot of people<br/>\n&gt; are indebted to the anonymous time-donor who&#39;d been keeping the maven<br/>\n&gt; repos up-to-date until several months ago. I&#39;ve been reluctant to<br/>\n&gt; accept full responsibility for feeding a repository I neither use nor<br/>\n&gt; fully understand until some point where I was sure I could quickly<br/>\n&gt; respond to millions of users who got their junit jars auto-updated in<br/>\n&gt; a way that broke all their tests. This might be overly cautious of<br/>\n&gt; me.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; David Saff<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Cheers,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Peter<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
