The &quot;catch&quot; is that I have to<br/>\n&gt; contribute testing-related examples - in other words: beautiful test<br/>\n&gt; code.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I already have some ideas of what to cover, but I thought some of the<br/>\n&gt; people in this group might have some examples of tests that they<br/>\n&gt; consider particularly &quot;beautiful&quot; or clever in their approach.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I am proud of Contract Tests combined with Interaction Tests to test <br/>\nthings like controllers in a J2EE application (or whatever they&#39;re <br/>\ncalled these days). I think it&#39;s beautiful the way I can drive the <br/>\ndesign of both the View and Model by test-driving the Controllers. I <br/>\nthink the corresponding tests are very nice. If you&#39;d like specific <br/>\nexamples, I can try to cook a few up from a current project I use in <br/>\ntutorials. Contact me directly--me at jbrains dot ca--if you&#39;d like to <br/>\nsee more.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
