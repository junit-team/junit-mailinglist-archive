Given that I expected them to contain\n&gt;the same number of elements, the most valuable information to me would be\n&gt;that they were of different lengths, not which elements were/were not\n&gt;present.\n&gt;\nI partially don&#39;t agree.  I think that comparing vectors should tell you \nif the elements are equals.  If your testing a sort algorythm, you want \nto know if elements of the result vector are in the right position. \n This request (assertEquals do array properly) has been expressed by \nmany people and I think that it should be included in JUnit.\n\nBut I&#39;m against the &quot;soft warning&quot; idea.  Don&#39;t see the added value there.\n\n-Vladimir\n\n\n\n",
