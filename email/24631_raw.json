Btw.: AssumptionViolatedError would be a great name, tho=\r\nugh.\n\n@Marc Philipp:\nI totally agree with you: The testing of properties sh=\r\nould be done by an assertion framework. I don=92t think this should be part=\r\n of the unit testing framework itself. In my case it was just included beca=\r\nuse of my playground setup. In a next step, I would extract it like the Ham=\r\ncrest library. I could think of small libraries that supply such kind of as=\r\nsertion logic for very specific cases that can be used individually or may =\r\nbe bundled together for bigger applications that need almost all kinds of a=\r\nssertions like this.\n\nConcerning the exception handling, I like the JUnit R=\r\nule based approach for applications up to Java 7 (without support for lambd=\r\nas) very well. This provides a way to execute a piece of code and provide i=\r\nnformation about the code that was executed. In order to be compatible to J=\r\nava 7 (and maybe 6), I think it is a must-have feature in the next testing =\r\nframework. Anyways, wherever possible, I would strongly recommend to leave =\r\nthe assertion part out of the test framework and simply provide an extensio=\r\nn point (like the @Rule annotation) for 3rd party libraries. For Java 8, I =\r\nreally prefer the lambda approach, as it makes the test code much more read=\r\nable and expresses the intend of the test case more clearly.\n\nAll the best,=\r\n Stefan\n\n\nAm 11.01.2015 um 20:27 schrieb mail@...

Although your fluent API looks very elegant, I think testing=\r\n the properties (e.g. message, cause, and so on) of an exception is somethi=\r\nng that can and IMHO should also be done using the assertion framework that=\r\n was chosen by the user. \n&gt; \n&gt; We are currently discussing a very slim appr=\r\noach to state that a block of code is expected to throw an exception of a c=\r\nertain class. If it does not throw an exception of the expected class you&#39;l=\r\nl get an AssertionError. Now, to check the exception message etc. you can u=\r\nse the assertion framework of your choice, e.g. Hamcrest:\n&gt; \n&gt; public void =\r\ntest() {\n&gt; // setup\n&gt; \n&gt; IllegalArgumentException thrown =3D expect(Illegal=\r\nArgumentException.class, () -&gt; doSomethingThatThrows());\n&gt; \n&gt; //optionally =\r\nassert something about the exception\n&gt; assertThat(thrown, hasMessage(starts=\r\nWith(&quot;foo&quot;)));\n&gt; }\n&gt; \n&gt; For details/feedback please see the full discussion=\r\n at:\n&gt; https://github.com/junit-team/junit/pull/1055\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; \n&gt; Marc=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
