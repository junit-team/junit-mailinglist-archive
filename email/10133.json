(I&#39;m assuming <br/>\nEclipse 3.0, which has JUnit 3.8.1 with it.)<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Write a test case (create class, write test method).<br/>\n2. With the test case class open and the active editor window, choose <br/>\nRun &gt; Run As &gt; JUnit Test.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of two things happen:<br/>\n<br/>\n(a) You see the test runner with a green or red bar, depending whether <br/>\nyour test passes.<br/>\n<br/>\n(b) You see nothing. It appears as though nothing happened.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf (b), then you have Eclipse set with the option &quot;do not show the JUnit <br/>\ntest runner if all tests pass&quot;. It&#39;s in the Workbench preferences <br/>\nsomewhere. You have two choices:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Change that option, which is what I did.<br/>\n2. Open the JUnit view &quot;by hand&quot; to see the test runner. (Window &gt; Show <br/>\nView &gt; Other... then choose Java &gt; JUnit from the list of all views.)<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes this help?<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
