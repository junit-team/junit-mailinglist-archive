I\nwonder if anyone else on this list knows? I don&#39;t remember seeing such\ninterfaces in the standard J2EE API. Are they specific to a particular\napplication server product? Are they specific to your project? If so,\nand if it has any relevance to how or what you need to mock, it might\nmake sense to describe those for those of us for whom these terms\ndon&#39;t ring a bell.\n\n\nOn 9/29/06, tester_junit &lt;sujal14@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;  I am new to easymock and wondering how should I go around Mock JMS\n&gt;  objects and verify that correct JMS APIs are called\n\nI&#39;d suggest dealing with this by splitting your problem into two steps:\nA) Learn to use EasyMock on simple stuff\nB) Learn how you should use the JMS API\n\nOnce you&#39;ve clarified both of these, you should have little trouble\napplying the concepts you&#39;ve learned while doing A and B into mocking\nthe right JMS interfaces with EasyMock.\n\nI assume you&#39;ve read EasyMock&#39;s documentation [1] and gone through at\nleast some JMS tutorials [2] ?\n\n\n-Lasse-\n\n[1] http://www.easymock.org/Documentation.html\n[2] http://www.j2eeolympus.com/J2EE/JMS/JMS.jsp\n\n",
