(Joe) Rainsberger\n&gt; Diaspar Software Services\n&gt; http://www.diasparsoftware.com\n&gt; Author, JUnit Recipes: Practical Methods for Programmer Testing\n\nThanks Joe.\n  After rereading my question and your answer, I did arrive at a\nworking solution of placing the reused class within the TestCase and\nthus &#39;within reach&#39; of the methods that form my tests.  I did need it\nto be static and didn&#39;t intially conceive that JUnit invokes all the\ntestXXX methods in quick succession (In their own threads?), this did\ncause some &#39;interesting&#39; contention issues within the reused object\n(resolved with the addition of a small synchronisation block).  The\nsync issue means some more tests are needed.  Oh joy 8).\n\n--- Mark\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
