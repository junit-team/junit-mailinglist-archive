Has anyone else encountered this problem and got \nto a workable solution or workaround? We have modified the JUnit \nsource to get this working, but:\n \n - is there a particular reason why it isn&#39;t (there seems\n   to be explicit comments in the code saying it doesn&#39;t work)\n - any plans to get it working?\n\nThanks\nPeter Mularien\nDeploy Solutions, Inc.\n\n\n\n",
