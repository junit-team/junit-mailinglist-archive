One might get really\nconfused by the mixture of differen=\r\nt conventions (as I did, having\nstarted the research).\n\nIf you want to focu=\r\ns on the newest version od JUnit, watch out reading\nthe tutorials. As I sai=\r\nd, the two versions have totally different\nnaming conventions, the older on=\r\ne being deprecated by the new one.\nHere&#39;s a brilliant advice on how to reco=\r\ngnize the two styles:\nhttp://www.instrumentalservices.com/content/view/45/5=\r\n2/\n\nSad but true, if I hadn&#39;t found that very article, I would still be\ncon=\r\nfused. Even though the docs attached to the downloadable version of\nJUnit 4=\r\n.0 cover the new convention, the samples are still unchanged. \n\nHave fun le=\r\narning, as I&#39;m having for a few days :)\n\n\nAnna Skawi&#324;ska\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
