Having the compiler enforce what would otherwise be<br/>\ndocumentation (e.g., &quot;this method must never return an integer smaller<br/>\nthan zero&quot;) is great.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut doing this level of design is probably a waste of time for classes<br/>\nused within a single project when you&#39;re doing XP; just write the thing<br/>\nand make it good enough, and get it out of the way; if something changes<br/>\nlater you can just go back and change the class as you wish. There&#39;s no<br/>\nneed to do a lot of design for future issues.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t see how DBC is going to drive your coding style the way that<br/>\nTDD does, since DBC is not even about coding; it&#39;s about design before<br/>\ncoding.<br/>\n<br/>\ncjs<br/>\n-- <br/>\nCurt Sampson  &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cjs@...\">cjs@...</a>&gt;   +81 90 7737 2974   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.NetBSD.org\">http://www.NetBSD.org</a><br/>\n    Don&#39;t you know, in this new Dark Age, we&#39;re all light.  --XTC</div>",
