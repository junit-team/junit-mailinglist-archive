I want \nt=\r\no ramp up to developing EJB&#39;s, and would like to combine unit testing \nwith=\r\n my build process (Maven).\n\nI have heard that there is a Cactus plug-in for=\r\n Maven.  However, there \nare two problems with using Cactus: everyone who h=\r\nas used it for unit \ntesting says that it&#39;s more pleasurable to have bamboo=\r\n shoved under \nhis/her fingernails, and the Cactus plug-in for Maven has be=\r\nen broken \nfor over a year.\n\nI understand that JUnitEE can be used for some=\r\n unit testing of EJB&#39;s, \nbut what I have read indicates that I may not be a=\r\nble to automate the \ntesting in Maven.\n\nAny suggestions?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
