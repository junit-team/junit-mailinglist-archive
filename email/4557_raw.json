Not only that, as a component user, I find that Javadoc is\n&gt; sufficient to my purpose most of the time. It is rare that I need the\n&gt; level of detail that a class&#39; contract gives me. When I do need it, I\n&gt; want it in a formal notation, since natural languages are ambiguous. At\n&gt; that point, Java code is the preferred formal notation, since Java is the\n&gt; language I program in the most. I&#39;ll accept Smalltalk and muddle through\n&gt; with Ruby. Any way you slice it, I wanna see code. The best code is\n&gt; self-verifying executing code.  Sounds like a JUnit test. :)\n\nWhat I think would be cool is Compaq&#39;s ESC Java\n(http://research.compaq.com/SRC/esc/) modified in two ways:\n\n- Make the annotation language part of javadoc\n- Make the license usable (currently it&#39;s very limiting.)\n\nBasically then you could have compile-time &quot;design by contract&quot; tests in\nJava, written in Javadoc where they could be incorporated into the\ndocumentation.  \n\nAnother interesting verification tool (which I&#39;ve done some work on/with)\nis Java PathFinder - http://ase.arc.nasa.gov/visser/jpf/.  It does runtime\nmodel checking on real java code...  \n\nBoth of these tools are researchy and experimental, I&#39;d love to see the\nmethods they employ get pushed into a mainstream tool.\n\nLater,\n\tDale\n-- \nDale E.
