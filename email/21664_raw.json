However, several of the services for\nwhich we used to look to SourceForge have moved to other providers:\njunit.org is being hosted and maintained by 8thlight, the mailing list\nis on yahoogroups, and, more recently, we&#39;ve switched to github for\nsource control.\n\nToday, we&#39;re going to, on an experimental basis, move issue tracking\nand snapshot downloads to github as well.  GitHub allows issues to be\ncreated in a couple fewer clicks, and new releases to be uploaded in\n_many, many_ fewer clicks, than SourceForge, which should allow our\nsmall team to be faster providing interim builds to play with, and\nresponding to issues.  We&#39;ll use the next couple of months to\ntransition.  Please immediately start tracking new bugs and feature\nrequests to:\n\nhttp://github.com/KentBeck/junit/issues\n\nAnd look for interim builds at:\n\nhttp://github.com/KentBeck/junit/downloads\n\nWe will probably continue to mirror stable releases through\nSourceForge for at least the time being.\n\nAnd please give feedback on the experience, either on this list, or on\nthe issue tracker itself.  Thanks,\n\n   David Saff\n\n",
