What I was saying is that need-to-know\n&gt; states should be made accessible by methods that look at inner states\n&gt; (usually as composites).  Of course, this is not a silver bullet, it is\n&gt; simply one idea for testing one type of situation.\n&gt;\n&gt; -Jason\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
