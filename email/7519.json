It&#39;s a reasonable substitute for communication and agreement in organizations where people don&#39;t like to talk to one another or organizations which a decision is reached that everyone ignores.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther than that, I haven&#39;t found a good spot for JTest that other tools don&#39;t already fill. That&#39;s my fault: I had the chance to try it out in the summer and I was too lazy to do it. If anyone from Parasoft is reading this, I apologize for not giving your tool the time it deserves.<br/>\n<br/>\nStill, based on what I&#39;ve seen, JTest supports a kind of testing I don&#39;t do.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo said Ilja Preuss on 4/4/2003 --------------------<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; How does Jtest work? <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think &quot;How well does JTest work&quot; would be a much more interesting<br/>\nquestion. And IMO it can only be answered by trying it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, please try it for a reasonable time (say, half a year) - and try<br/>\nJunit for a similiar amount of time. If you *then* report back here with<br/>\nyour experiences, you will probably find a very interested audience.<br/>\n<br/>\nUntil then, all your points are mere speculation - and not very<br/>\ninteresting ones, to actual practitioners.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards, Ilja<br/>\n<br/>\nPS: Personally, I am not very inclined trying out Jtest - simply because<br/>\nI *like* working test-driven. YMMV.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!
