In the past, although<br/>\nunder-documented, the policy has been that the order in which test<br/>\nmethods within a test class are run is undefined.  In practice, it has<br/>\nbeen left to the JDK implementation, which has usually ended up<br/>\nmeaning the tests are run in bytecode order, and almost always been a<br/>\nstable ordering.<br/>\n<br/>\nJDK 7 (and, I believe, upcoming releases of JDK 6) changes this, by<br/>\nhaving the methods returned from reflective queries in essentially<br/>\nrandom order.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt will always be my belief that proper use of JUnit results in test<br/>\nmethods whose passing or failure does not depend on ordering.  That<br/>\nsaid, it can be very frustrating to have a test break because the JDK<br/>\nselected a particular random ordering, and then have little or no tool<br/>\nsupport in recreating the order that triggers the failure.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, accepting this patch will mean that the ordering of methods will<br/>\nno longer change from run to run, even if you change or upgrade JDKs.<br/>\nUnfortunately, it may change the ordering once--if we put this change<br/>\ninto 4.11, say, then teams using current versions of JDK 6 that<br/>\nupgrade from 4.10 to 4.11 may find their tests now running in a<br/>\ndifferent stable ordering than before.  I think this is a small price<br/>\nas a one-time cost.<br/>\n<br/>\nMore disconcerting to me would be if I started seeing test cases with<br/>\nmethod names like aaaRunMeFirst.<br/>\n<br/>\nThoughts?<br/>\n<br/>\n   David Saff</div>",
