However, there *seems* to be an assumption in this thread\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that multilpe asserts per test are somehow related to each other, such\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that if one fails and I fix it then the other possibly failing asserts\n&gt; &gt; &gt; would be fixed at the same time.  That is not always, and perhaps\n&gt; &gt; &gt; generally, not the case.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I believe it is, if the test is focused on a small bit of functionality.\n&gt;\n&gt; It is focused on a small bit of functionality and the asserts are not \n&gt; related to each other.  The functionality is the application of a \n&gt; CreditMemo to an existing sale, for which there may or may not be \n&gt; related sales (eg. a purchased recurring sale, a recurring sale in \n&gt; negotiation, one or more &quot;upsales&quot;, etc.).\n&gt; \n\nOof! You have a much larger definition of &quot;small bit of functionality&quot; than\nI do ;-).  That sounds like a big chunk of an application to me.\n \n&gt; &gt; Is it necessary (or even desirable) to test both these things in the\nsame\n&gt; &gt; test?  Could you perhaps do one test to show applying the CreditMemo to\na\n&gt; &gt; Sale does the right thing, and a second to show applying it to a\n&gt; &gt; RecurringSale is correct?  If these two actions happen in different \n&gt; &gt; classes,\n&gt; &gt; why would you need to test them at the same time?\n&gt;\n&gt; But, that was the point.  Applying it to the sale has a cascade effect \n&gt; on its related sales.  You could do a separate test for each thing but I \n&gt; tend to hate the duplication even more!  In the contrived example (based \n&gt; on reality) there should be no need to directly apply the CreditMemo for \n&gt; an originatingSale to one of its related sales.  It happens behind the \n&gt; scenes.  The test is testing that the direct effect on the originating \n&gt; sale takes place as well as the behind-the-scenes effect on its related \n&gt; sales.\n&gt;\nI do not know your application, but I might consider a comprehensive set of\ntests just to make sure CreditMemos get applied correctly to all the related\nsales objects.  Then the test for the application to an originating sale\njust has to test the cascade happened, maybe even with a mock object.  You\nwould not have to check the related sale updated &quot;correctly&quot;.  You already\ndid that in more focused tests.  Is there any reason the code would function\ndifferently when called from the original sale than when called from your\ntests?\n\n&gt; Mind you, also, that I am not truly advocating multiple failures per \n&gt; test... I am playing &quot;devil&#39;s advocate&quot; in order to shine some light on \n&gt; what seems to be forgotten territory.\n\nOh, me too.  I am not trying to be dogmatic, and I am still learning TDD.  I\njust wanted to be the advocate for the other side.\n\n--\nJim McMaster\nmailto:jim.mcmaster@...\n\n\n",
