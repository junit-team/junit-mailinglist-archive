Years back I was a contractor for the DoD. This statement means \none of a few possible things:\n\n1. &quot;We don&#39;t know what jUnit it, so we&#39;re against it&quot;\n2. &quot;We heard of something like jUnit that is actually banned, so just in \ncase we&#39;ll say jUnit is banned too.&quot;\n3. &quot;It&#39;s late, let&#39;s go home.&quot;\n\nI would suggest that since none of the people here who work with jUnit \nhave heard of this ban, plus jUnit is pretty much the standard, the \npeople making the claim must corroborate it to a *legally* binding \ndegree. Nothing like a &quot;well I heard on the internet that...&quot; or &quot;some \nguy who works at some other location says...&quot; but a copy of an actual \nmemo or directive that explicitly names jUnit and explains the reason \nfor the ban.\n\nOtherwise, I would simply be a good negotiator, viz., expressions of \nsympathy (they are free) but don&#39;t give in to whatever they say until \nthey document it.\n\n---&gt; Exceptional claims require exceptional proof &lt;---\n\nNote that you should strongly take the position that jUnit is allowed, \nit is the standard and that *they* must prove their claim. Otherwise you \nwill be trying to show a negative, which is impossible and will eat up a \nlot of your time in the process.  What will you do if you come up \nempty-handed and they say they think the memo was actually classified? \nIf they are legitimate programmers then you&#39;ll get this settled pretty \nquickly and amicably. If they are non-technical but in charge, well... \nbest of luck....\n\nJeff\n\nDavid McReynolds wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Someone popped up at a meeting this morning and announced that the US\n&gt; DoD does not allow the use of jUnit for unit testing.\n&gt;\n\n\n&gt; First, I find\n&gt; that a little hard to swallow given the second statement about junit\n&gt; being the built-in testing generator provided by java (can you say\n&gt; non-sequitor?). Secondly, I cannot corroborate that statement via google.\n&gt;\n&gt; What I need is link to a document that explicitly corroborates or\n&gt; refutes the statement. So far, it looks like the statement is false\n&gt; but I am only using deductive reasoning there.\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n\n\n",
