The notion seems to be that each method in a cl=\r\nass, or perhaps each public method, should have a unit test.\n\n  I think thi=\r\ns is wrong. I think, as J.B. said, that in such a case you should concentra=\r\nte on testing features, not simply methods.\n\n  I would say that for new cod=\r\ne, where you&#39;re writing tests along with your production code, it might mak=\r\ne sense to try for a test per (public) method. But that&#39;s because in this c=\r\nase you have the benefit of thinking about the testing at the time you&#39;re w=\r\nriting the code. I think you&#39;re more likely to design your code in such a w=\r\nay as to have this make more sense. (The &quot;testing influences design&quot; notion=\r\n.)\n\n  The problem I see with mindlessly (or even mindfully) writing a test =\r\nfor each method, just to satisfy someone&#39;s idea that code coverage is good,=\r\n is that you&#39;re likely to (1) invest a lot of (or even a little) time; and =\r\n(2) generate a lot of test code (which will have to be maintained, don&#39;t fo=\r\nrget), for what will turn out to be little or no benefit. I would bet that =\r\nthe marginal number of bugs found by &quot;complete&quot; per-method tests over a mor=\r\ne sensible per-feature approach, both now and forever in the future, is ver=\r\ny close to zero. At least that&#39;s my impression based on my own experiences.=\r\n\n\n  More is not always better.\n\n  I would be very curious to know if anyone=\r\n can report on actual (measured, quantitative) experiences that either supp=\r\nort or refute this.\n\n   - Alan Bram\n     alan@...\n\n        Yaho=\r\no!
