I think it&#39;s your solution.\n&gt; \n&gt; One thing: I have never needed to override runBare(). Can you \n&gt; explain \n&gt; why you need to do it?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks.\n&gt; -- \n&gt; J. B. Rainsberger,\n&gt; Diaspar Software Services\n&gt; http://www.diasparsoftware.com :: +1 416 791-8603\n&gt; Let&#39;s write software that people understand\n\nI override runBare() because if a test fails and if an exception \noccurs in the tearDown() method, then the test failure meassage is \nswallowed by JUnit and the exception message is shown of the tearDown\n() method instead. So I override runBare(). Now the JUnit result \nshows the test failure message. The exception in tearDown() is \nprinted to the console. That was a question I asked half a year ago \nhere and someone told me to override runBare() for this requirement.\n\nBut back to my original question and to your answer. I didn&#39;t test \nyour solution yet, but it seems to work from the first sight.\n\nI think this is what you mean:\n\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n  TestSuite testSuite = new TestSuite();\n  testSuite.add(new MyTest(&quot;someTest&quot;));\n  // MyTestSetup subclasses TestSetup\n  TestDecorator testSetup = new MyTestSetup(testSuite);\n  junit.textui.TestRunner.run(testSetup);\n}\n\nBut we run our JUnit tests in Eclipse. Eclipse has an own nice \ngraphical JUnit view (written by Erich Gamma) to display the \nresults. Now the problem with your solution seems to be this: How \ncan I teach Eclipse to run the TestDecorator?\n\nIt would be no problem if I would start a main method. But that \ndoesn&#39;t work for the Eclipse JUnit view, or am I wrong? Is there \na way to use your solution for the Eclipse JUnit view?\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n\n\n",
