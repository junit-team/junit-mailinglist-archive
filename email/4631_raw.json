I like the fact that the JUnit framework is itself \nsmall, easy to comprehend, therefore making it easy to extend.  One \nthing that perturbs me about the Assert class is the fact that it&#39;s \nstatic.  If I want to override assertTrue() globally, for instance to \nprovide more verbose output, or to change it&#39;s behavior so that a \nfailure won&#39;t result in an exception being thrown thereby discontinuing \nthe rest of the test, I have to edit the JUnit Assert class itself.  If \nAssert were an instance class I could avoid this, and easily add the \nassert extensions that everyone is asking for.\n\nI do believe that they should be extensions to JUnit, without bloating \nthe original Assert class.\n\n-shane\n\np.s.  Yes, I could make my own base TestCase class, but this doesn&#39;t \nwork retroactively, and certainly isn&#39;t a solution I would want to \nfoster for Assert Extension classes.\n\nOn Friday, April 5, 2002, at 11:42  AM, Chris Eppstein wrote:\n\n&gt; So your argument is that we really don&#39;t need anything other than \n&gt; assertTrue? I&#39;d have to disagree.\n&gt;\n&gt; JUnit is a TESTING FRAMEWORK. By using it, testing should be made \n&gt; easier. I&#39;d like to not have to reinvent the wheel for many of these \n&gt; assertions. I understand that I can easily write my own assertion \n&gt; library in just a couple hours but why should I have to? Certainly, \n&gt; after years of use, we have identified many assertions that would be \n&gt; useful to the community at large. As they are identified, it seems \n&gt; natural for JUnit to provide them in future releases.\n&gt;\n&gt; -Chris\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: J. B. Rainsberger [mailto:jbr@...]\n&gt; Sent: Friday, April 05, 2002 9:52 AM\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: RE: [junit] assertContains? -&gt; junit development question?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; it would create easier-to-read and maintain tests than having to\n&gt;&gt; currently\n&gt;&gt; do containment checks by writing\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; if(str.indexOf(keywordStr) &lt; 0) {\n&gt;&gt; \tfail(&quot;failed.&quot;);\n&gt;&gt; }\n&gt;\n&gt; Is there something wrong with:\n&gt;\n&gt; assertTrue( str.indexOf(keywordStr) &gt;= 0 )?\n&gt;\n&gt; I used to want many, many custom assertions. I now believe it&#39;s cleaner \n&gt; simply\n&gt; to build a lot of custom methods answering boolean, then using \n&gt; assertTrue() and\n&gt; assertFalse(). What changes in your example is the condition, and not \n&gt; the\n&gt; assertion mechanism.\n&gt;\n&gt; You create your own abstract TestCase class with your custom \n&gt; boolean-logic\n&gt; methods.\n&gt;\n&gt; public abstract class MyTestCase extends TestCase {\n&gt;     public static boolean containsText(final String string, final String\n&gt; pattern) {\n&gt;         return string.indexOf(pattern) &gt;= 0;\n&gt;     }\n&gt;     ...\n&gt; }\n&gt;\n&gt; ...\n&gt;\n&gt; public class SomeTest extends MyTestCase {\n&gt;     public void testSomething() {\n&gt;         assertTrue(containsText(&quot;Hello&quot;, &quot;el&quot;));\n&gt;     }\n&gt; }\n&gt;\n&gt; ...\n&gt;\n&gt; Of course, after enough of this, your code starts to look like \n&gt; procedural\n&gt; programming code, because what you REALLY want is to extend String, \n&gt; which you\n&gt; can&#39;t do. If you really want to, you can wrap String and provide the \n&gt; extra\n&gt; methods.\n&gt;\n&gt; public class MyString {\n&gt;     private final String string;\n&gt;\n&gt;     public MyString(final String aString) {\n&gt;         string = aString;\n&gt;     }\n&gt;\n&gt;     public boolean contains(final String pattern) {\n&gt;         return string.indexOf(pattern) &gt;= 0;\n&gt;     }\n&gt;\n&gt;     public boolean matchesRegex(final String regex) {\n&gt;         // ORO magic...\n&gt;     }\n&gt; }\n&gt;\n&gt; It&#39;s cleaner in one respect and uglier in another.\n&gt;\n&gt; J.
