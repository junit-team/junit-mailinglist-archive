It&#39;s only about 4-5 pages of code to read it all if you&#39;re security concerned. The test failure basically tells me you have the slowest computer to ever run these tests ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nOr, as the javadocs from the test-class say:<br/>\n<br/>\n/**<br/>\n * These tests assert that the expected peformance of classes/methods/both.<br/>\n *<br/>\n * While the occasional glitch in computing power can make these tests fail (if actual time exceeds expected + 33%),<br/>\n * the lower bound should *never* be violated.<br/>\n *<br/>\n * These tests usually fail if run in a debugger, due to the changed timings.<br/>\n * <br/>\n */<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Also, Just out of curiosity, what happens thread count wise when you aren&#39;t using ConfigurableParallelComputer, does it literally fire up a thread per test?<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, in &quot;methods&quot; mode it&#39;s one thread per test method. Classes mode is one per class. Both is, well, both. In my 10+ years as test-infected, I have really never ever had a use-case where this kind of solution would be appropriate (maybe some kind of really slow database with unlimited cheap connections). With thousands of test classes you come to a grinding halt with any of these options.<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;1 more thing, do any of the selenium projects you speak of use the &gt;selenium grid with windows? We are having a hell of a time getting &gt;that working too. We have the hub on Ubuntu and windows slaves don&#39;t &gt;play nice but Ubuntu slaves work fine. I haven&#39;t found much info on &gt;the issues we are seeing nor have a I gotten any responses on the &gt;Selenium mailing list. We may just have to skip IE testing for now &gt;and running everything on firefox Ubuntu.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>We run all our browser-bots on windows, and the CI is bamboo on linux. We do not use grid. Instead we let a single build run with 4 threads towards a single instance of selenium RC (with firefox). This has proved to be a nice, stable setup that gives us a lot of punch.<br/>\nNow we also partition the entire build into 2, so we have two separate (Windows) pizza boxes running RC+ firefox, for a grand total<br/>\nof 8 available browsers. This allows us to use firefox as the backbone in our selenium-TDD-based development that has allowed us<br/>\nvirtually regression free frequent deployments.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe run Internet Explorer and Opera on separate boxes. Opera Selenium tests are hard to make stable, but they also work concurrently.<br/>\nInternet Exploder is a strict one-instance per box for any kind of<br/>\nstability. I know some people use virtualization. We just add boxes.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other projects do much the same, but they all pre-date grid somewhat.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re also planning to try out Chrome once we upgrade to Selenium 2.0, we really need something webkit based.<br/>\n<br/>\nKristian</div>",
