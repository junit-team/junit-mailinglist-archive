At least if I run the tests with ant I\n&gt;  &gt; get an output similar to:\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Testcase: testDateIsActiveNullDate took 0,016 sec\n&gt;  &gt; Testcase: testDateIsActiveToday took 0,031 sec\n&gt;  &gt; Testcase: testDateIsActivePast took 0,047 sec\n&gt;  &gt; ...\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; I&#39;m not sure how much use this kind of micro-testing would be, though\n&gt;  &gt; I&#39;m sure you could set up your test cases to provide more valid data.\n&gt; \n&gt; I haven&#39;t done very careful testing, but I certainly have noticed that\n&gt; the times reported by JUnit vary a great deal.\n&gt; \n&gt; Running one simple set of tests just now gave me results in which 50%\n&gt; differences were common and more than one test took 3x as long from one\n&gt; run to the next.  So, sure, you can use JUnit for this sort of simple\n&gt; performance testing, but you should at least run the tests enough times to\n&gt; build statistical confidence in the results.\n&gt; \n&gt; It didn&#39;t show up in these few runs, but I believe that I have noticed\n&gt; before that the first test reported a much longer than normal time --\n&gt; seconds rather than milliseconds.  So the order in which tests are run\n&gt; might introduce an effect large enough to render the results useless.\n&gt; \n&gt; --\n&gt; Jim Dixon  jdd@...   tel +44 117 982 0786  mobile +44 797 373 7881\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; *Yahoo!
