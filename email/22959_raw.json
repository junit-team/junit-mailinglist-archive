My \nteam and me chose test driven development, espcially for the scheduler \nitself. I am using JUnit. For nearly every class there has to be JUnit \ntest class. The database schema has become quiet big. Not everything is \nneeded for the OR-mapped classes in the scheduler. In the end there are \nstill 14 classes.\n\nAs the scheduler has to be highly configurable, we need classes like: \ncourses, lecturers, students, features, rooms, roomRequiredFeatures, \ntimeSlot, lecturerPrefferredTimeSlots, and so on. I wanted to use the \n@Before annotations to create fixtures (instantiated test objects to \ntest). These test objects reflect one example of a data set from the \ndatabase.\n\nAs a matter of fact, the 14 classess are not very detailed: maybe 3-4 \nfields. The problem arises as they are bound really tight to each other. \nTHis results in 220 lines code of instanation in the @Before method \nwhich is way to much. A common way to deal with this is to write \nmockups, which simulate the test objects behaviour. But as the classes \nare very simple there is no way to simulate them.\n\nI am a little bit desperate because I have the feeling our design is \nflawed. Are there any suggesstions or course of actions for this case?\n\nI hope I made myself clear,\n\nBest regards!\n\n",
