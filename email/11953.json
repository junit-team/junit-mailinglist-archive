Of course the test won&#39;t compile<br/>\nuntil the Book class is written.<br/>\nFirst step is to write the test (which you have done).<br/>\nNext step is to compile the test -- the students need to realize they<br/>\nneed to write the beginning of the Book class with the appropriate<br/>\nconstructor and method signatures. <br/>\n<br/>\nNext step is to make the test pass by adding sufficient logic to the<br/>\nmethods.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hope you can help. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I hope this did.  This is the approach I take in writing virtually all<br/>\nmy code now days. It works extremely well. <br/>\n<br/>\nFrank<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nFrank Burough &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:fburough@...\">fburough@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
