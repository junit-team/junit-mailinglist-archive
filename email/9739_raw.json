You can&#39;t avoid this without adding your own suite() method\nexplicitly.\n\nHowever, it looks like you want to reuse set-up procedures between test\nsuites. If this is true, extract these methods into a third class\nwhich you can use from your two test classes&#39; setUp() methods.\n\nMalcolm\n\nOn Wed, 2003-10-22 at 14:59, Chirag Shashikant Doshi wrote:\n&gt; Hi all,\n&gt;  \n&gt; I have a Test Case class say BaseTest, There are some 10 odd tests in\n&gt; this class and a few setup methods. The test methods are bound to the\n&gt; setup methods ie. they expected the setup to have generated some values\n&gt; which the test methods use for asserts. \n&gt; Now I want to change one particular setup method to set up the values\n&gt; differently so that I can test a different functionality, here I am\n&gt; trying to check if a proper exception is raised. The approach I trie was\n&gt; I made a sub-class of the BaseTest say ExtendedTest and here I overrided\n&gt; one of the setup functions and wrote a single test method which will\n&gt; assert for exception based on the new setup that was done in the\n&gt; ExtendtedTest.\n&gt; But when I tried to run the test I found that Junit execute all the\n&gt; tests that belonmg to the superClass testCase too and here it uses the\n&gt; overrdden setup methods and thus in my case all my super class tests\n&gt; fail.\n&gt; Is this the expected behavior ? Am I trying the right thing for my\n&gt; problem, is there a cleaner way for my kind of a requirement ?\n&gt; Please advise,\n&gt;  \n&gt; Thanks\n&gt; Chirag \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
