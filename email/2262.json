And why can&#39;t they use one of the GUI Web test tools<br/>\nfrom Mercury or Empirix to automate this?  Is it a matter of budget for the<br/>\nQA team?  Sounds a little fishy -- like &quot;We have a QA team but they don&#39;t do<br/>\nanything with free tools, and they can&#39;t afford the COTS tools to do<br/>\nanything either.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry if I&#39;m jumping to conclusions, but your statements about the QA team<br/>\ncaught my attention.<br/>\n<br/>\nScott Stirling<br/>\nJRun QA<br/>\nMacromedia</div>",
