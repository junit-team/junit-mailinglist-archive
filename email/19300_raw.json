I have some common setup and\n&gt; teardown tasks that are shared amongst several test classes. For example I\n&gt; read test data from an xml file used by each test class that contains global\n&gt; information like Locale and Timezone. Another is removing test data from the\n&gt; db. These are not tasks I want to do once per test class but once per test\n&gt; method in several test classes. I would think it makes more sense to pull\n&gt; out these common tasks from each test class and either put them in a\n&gt; utility/helper class or create a base test class that each test class will\n&gt; inherit. The dilemma I have is which approach is better. Creating a utility\n&gt; class or creating a base test class that is inherited. The common tasks are\n&gt; not package specific, meaning they are not targeting a specific suite of\n&gt; test classes so my initial thought is to create a utility class for these\n&gt; common tasks to reside. This may seem to be more of a general java design\n&gt; question but was hoping someone can give me some pointers.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Scott\n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; No virus found in this incoming message.\n&gt; Checked by AVG Free Edition. \n&gt; Version: 7.5.463 / Virus Database: 269.6.1/776 - Release Date: 25/04/2007 12:19\n\n",
