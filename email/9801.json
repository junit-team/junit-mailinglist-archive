This<br/>\nset of objects is called a test fixture. When you are writing tests you<br/>\nwill often find that you spend more time writing the code to set up the<br/>\nfixture than you do in actually testing values.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nPay close attention, class.  The set of objects is the fixture.  The<br/>\nfixture is what you set up.  This is clear and unambiguous English from<br/>\nthe authors of JUnit.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Let us try this again, with one slight correction.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Ah.. but in proper usage each fixture is a different TestCase class...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Now, either<br/>\n<br/>\n*  this &quot;correction&quot; is also from the JUnit site, in which case they have<br/>\n   contradicted themselves, or<br/>\n<br/>\n*  this is simply your interpretation, in which case you should defer to<br/>\n   what the authors of JUnit.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich is it?  Searching on the Web page I gave a URL for, I just don&#39;t<br/>\nfind the phrase &quot;in proper usage&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor that matter, if I google I get<br/>\n<br/>\n    Your search - junit &quot;each fixture is a different TestCase class&quot; -<br/>\n    did not match any documents.<br/>\n<br/>\nGoogling on a shorter phrase gives me the same result<br/>\n<br/>\n    Your search - junit &quot;different TestCase class&quot; - did not match any<br/>\n    documents.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt would seem that if this text appears anywhere, Google hasn&#39;t noticed<br/>\nit.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &quot;test case&quot; (as used in the document Jim quoted) == instance of<br/>\n&gt; TestCase, usually implemented as a method on a TestCase class<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;fixture&quot; == TestCase class<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; OK?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Not really.  A TestCase always contains a fixture.  This may or may not<br/>\nbe clearly distinguished by putting it in a setUp() method, but it&#39;s the<br/>\nset of objects that you are running your test against.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we are going to be truly nitpicking, then recall that an object is an<br/>\nINSTANCE of a class.  A set of objects can never be a class.  It is  a set<br/>\nof instances of a set of classes.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy apologies to the wider world for starting this absurd thread; I was<br/>\njust trying to be helpful to the enquirer.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJim Dixon  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jdd@...\">jdd@...</a>   tel +44 117 982 0786  mobile +44 797 373 7881</div>",
