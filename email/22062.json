If someone said, &quot;I went through my code and I could definitely use classes as categories because of X, Y and/or Z,&quot; would be compelling to me. Even more compelling is if someone would write the test cases for the new scheme.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards,<br/>\n<br/>\nKent<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Nov 19, 2009, at 7:33 AM, David Saff wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; On Wed, Nov 18, 2009 at 7:46 PM, yme0987654321 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:yme0987654321@...\">yme0987654321@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The decision to use types to define categories is definitely surprising to see, so that has to count against it.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; However, after the initial shock wears off, I definitely see the power in it, using Java inheritance and static checking rather than free form strings and some arbitrary hierarchy delimiter in the string.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; However, I think the decision to use a specific new interface as the super type is not a good idea. It would seem you gain the same power by allowing any Class&lt;?&gt;. The advantage of doing this is it would allow real classes within the project to act as Categories, so that if, for example, I am testing a DAO framework, I can categorize individual tests with the specific DAO subclass they are targeting, and then run a category based on the DAO supertype. Much nicer than just calling it all SlowTests. In practice that won&#39;t happen often if a custom interface is required because it will introduce a dependency on a JUnit type in the production code.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Huh. The first time through, I thought &quot;that&#39;s ridiculous&quot;. The<br/>\n&gt; second time, I wondered if there&#39;s not something to this...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Totally musing out loud, but you could rename the annotation as<br/>\n&gt; TestOf, so that you&#39;d have<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; @TestOf(CustomStreamingPlatform.class)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hmm...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m also curious if you considered using an annotation as the category? That is having the category take a Class&lt;?&gt; that represents an annotation? You could support meta-annotations to allow a hierarchy of categories as well as supporting any subclasses or implementations of types so annotated. Coding for that would be nasty business, but it wouldn&#39;t be complicated from a client point of view, and would allow the same flexibility of inheritance without the dependency on a JUnit type.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I wanted to stay away from meta-annotations unless the reasons were<br/>\n&gt; _really_ compelling.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I would prefer just an arbitrary Class&lt;?&gt;, though. Inheritance is well understood by any Java programmer (unlike meta-annotations) and opens up a synergy between the category hierarchy and the code hierarchy.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Can I get another vote on this extension idea?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; David<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>",
