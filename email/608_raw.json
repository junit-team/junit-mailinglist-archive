I think that the \nassertEquals(File,String) interface is simple enough so that everyone\ncould benefit from it, and if people wanted more, it would form\na good basis for extension.\n\n&gt; 2. why should this uniformity effort be a responsibility of JUnit?\n&gt; In other words, should this be something tossed into a JUnit\n&gt; extender?\n\nI do think this is a basic requirement, and should be part of JUnit,\nbut if you want to toss it in a JUnit extender, that is fine with me.\nI don&#39;t care that much.  I can see two major reasons for this being\nbasic testing infrastructure:\n1. It makes it much easier for non-programmers to review testcases,\nto ensure that what you think are right answers really are right \nanswers.  This is especially true for long messages.  If they are\nstored as seperate files, just tell the support person, translater,\nor copyeditor, to read them and check for mistakes.  If the right\nanswers are embeded in java code, it is much harder for these people.\n2. It makes it much easier to update test cases to react to updates\nin software.  This is a huge problem.  For example, lets say you have\n2000 test cases all of which have your company&#39;s name.  Your company\nchanges names.  If they are stored in seperate files, almost anyone\ncan quickly edit the change.  Maybe even automatically.  If they are\nin Java files, it is much harder, because you need to see the context\nbefore you make the change.  (Some of the old company&#39;s names might\nstill be right.)\n\nThe whole point of JUnit is to encourage people to build and run\ntest cases.  Lots of test cases.  If we then make it hard to update\nthem as things change, people will write fewer test cases.  And things\nalways change.\n\n&gt; 3. why not use the Unix paradigm and build big tools from little\n&gt; tools?\n&gt; As an example, what happens if you wrap the &quot;&gt;&quot; command in a script,\n&gt; or in a separate Java framework which you build to manage your\n&gt; &quot;mature development process&quot;?\n\nI&#39;ve tried systems much like this, and have found them very dangerous!\nThe problem is that it is easy for wrong results to be saved as \ncorrect ones.  Once you have made this mistake, it is very hard to\ndetect it.  (All the automation which makes it easy to run tests, and\nquickly see the results, now work against you in realizing that the\n&#39;right&#39; answers are really wrong.)\n\nIn a sense, Text files are as basic a computer object as Strings or\nnumbers.  By storing right answers all alone in their own files, I \nthink it makes it easier to use UNIX&#39;s various utilities on them.\nRight now, it is very hard, because the right answers are interspersed\nwith the Java code of the test cases.\n\nJoshua Levy\n\nThe history of this message is below:\n \n&gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; &gt; From:\tbalakrishnan sengodan [SMTP:bsengodan@...]\n&gt; &gt; Sent:\tTuesday, March 06, 2001 12:36 PM\n&gt; &gt; To:\tjunit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; Subject:\tRE: [junit] Re: is there any easy way to write the test\n&gt; &gt; results i n a file \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Joshua is correct. Though the command &quot;java\n&gt; &gt; junit.textui.TestRunner your.Class &gt; filename &quot; helps\n&gt; &gt; us to create test reults in a file, we need to have a\n&gt; &gt; uniform way to store test results for future use in\n&gt; &gt; any matured development process.\n&gt; &gt; Regards\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- Joshua Levy &lt;joshualevy@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- Kevin Bourrillion &lt;kevinb@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     java junit.textui.TestRunner your.Class &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; filename\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; PS. If you were looking for a more specific\n&gt; &gt; &gt; answer... just ask a more\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; specific question!  :-)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;ll ask the more specific question:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   I&#39;m often expecting a complex text result for a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; test case.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   I would like these &quot;right answers&quot; stored in a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; text file,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   rather than in the source code of the junit test\n&gt; &gt; &gt; case.  I\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   suspect that adding a new method of the form\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   assertEquals(File expected, String result) \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   would be very useful.  Has anyone done this, or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; something like \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   this?  An even cooler way to do this (if possible)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; would\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   be a method like assertEqualsFile(String result),\n&gt; &gt; &gt; where the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   method would determine the file name by concating\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the TestCase\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   name and the test method name.  Any thoughts on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; this?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Also, it would be nice if the javadoc generated\n&gt; &gt; &gt; documentation\n&gt; &gt; &gt; for junit where on line at the www.junit.org site. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; (Or did I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; just miss them?)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Joshua  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Get email at your own domain with Yahoo!
