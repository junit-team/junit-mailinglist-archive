And possibly the callee&#39;s\ndocumentation.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Because tests are code.  \n&gt; \n&gt; (They have syntactic clutter that is necessary for use as tests \n&gt; but which is just clutter relative to the information useful to a \n&gt; client programmer.)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Because tests, being code, can&#39;t relate code to external concepts.  \n&gt; \n&gt; (A specification can say that a function f returns the mathematical\n&gt; sum of two given integers subject to the limitations of 32-bit\n&gt; signed binary arithmetic.  How can a test say something like that?)\n&gt; \n\n\ttry{\n\t    int result = instance.f(Integer.MAX_VALUE, Integer.MAX_VALUE);\n\t    fail(&quot;f should throw Exception when integer limits are met&quot;);\n\t}catch(IllegalStateException e){\n\t    assertTrue(&quot;function f returns the mathematical sum of two given\nintegers subject to the limitations of 32-bit&quot;);\n\t}\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Tests are great, but don&#39;t forget the documentation.\n&gt; \n\nAND they are great documentation. Ever tried to compile *.doc with the\nsource code to detect anomalies\nin your documentation ?\n\n&gt; \n&gt; It seems that some people who write tests waste one advantage of it:  \n&gt; \n&gt; I agree that testing, especially writing tests even before \n&gt; you implement, \n&gt; is good because it forces you to think about what your code \n&gt; is supposed \n&gt; to do and how it&#39;s supposed to be used.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Well, if you&#39;re already thinking about the contract, then that&#39;s a\n&gt; good time to document the contract.  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Yes, I know this has to be modulated by what kind of code we&#39;re\n&gt; talking about (e.g., intra-program calls versus trans-API calls) \n&gt; and by how stable the interface contract is.  I just wouldn&#39;t\n&gt; want to have to read test cases instead of Javadoc to figure \n&gt; out how, say, Sun&#39;s Servlet API worked and was supposed to be \n&gt; used. \n&gt; \n\nAgreed, but it would be nice to have some coding examples too. \nFor example setting/retrieving JNDI value in it&#39;s simplest form, then you\ncould \neasily test a JNDI setup/configuration.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Daniel\n&gt; \n\n",
