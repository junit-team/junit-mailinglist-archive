But because the\n&gt;  &gt; doGet(HttpServletRequest, HttpServletResponse) and\n&gt;  &gt; doPost(HttpServletRequest, HttpServletResponse) methods have no returns,\n&gt;  &gt; and HttpServletRequest and HttpServletResponse are generated by the\n&gt;  &gt; system, I could not create JUnit tests for them.  Does anyone have some\n&gt;  &gt; experience?  Thanks a lot for the help.\n&gt;\n&gt; You can use HTTPUnit to run tests against the servlet.  The\n&gt; problem, however, as you point out, is that you only have\n&gt; limited visibility into the servlet, since you can only check\n&gt; the returned HTTP response to the web client.  It&#39;s gets even\n&gt; more fun when you&#39;re trying to test the behavior of session\n&gt; time outs, security and log in checks, etc.\n&gt;\n&gt; What we&#39;ve discussed doing is to make our servlets (and JSPs\n&gt; via tag libraries) very thin layers that take the incoming\n&gt; requests and just delegate to our presentation helper classes.\n&gt; In many cases, we&#39;ll end up just passing the request and\n&gt; session objects along, but we now have a point where we can\n&gt; create the request or session objects in particular states\n&gt; (like expired session), so we can much more easily test the\n&gt; interface&#39;s behavior, plus we can use JUnit.\n&gt;\n&gt; This isn&#39;t a silver bullet or anything, because there are\n&gt; still cases where you want to test the actual returned HTML,\n&gt; and sometimes HTTPUnit tests are the best way to do that.\n&gt; But it seems like it will make our life a bit easier for some\n&gt; other classes of presentation layer testing.\n&gt;\n&gt; Anyone else try this?\n&gt;\n&gt; -Paul Hodgetts\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
