Well, one thing you might consider is that, depending on how<br/>\nuseful the library is, it might be easiest to change the clients so that<br/>\nthey don&#39;t use that library.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;d like to do this from ONE TestCase since that seems like a nicer <br/>\n&gt; solution than Ant parallel task.  e.g my TestClientServer  would spawn <br/>\n&gt; a server in a different VM and also spawn as many clients as I want <br/>\n&gt; each in its own VM and then once all client(s) test methods are done, <br/>\n&gt; the TestClientServer tears down.<br/>\n&gt; Is there a way to do this.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There is a way to do anything.  If you mean:  &quot;Does the JUnit framework<br/>\nprovide a facility that will let me do this easily?&quot; then the answer is<br/>\n&quot;No.&quot;  You will have to provide such a facility yourself.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt doesn&#39;t seem to me as though it will be a very difficult thing to do,<br/>\nthough.  For example: you could use one of the exec methods in Runtime<br/>\nto spawn the other VM processes.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow will your test method make assertions about what has happened in the<br/>\nserver VM, or the client VMs?  You&#39;ll have to have some way of allowing<br/>\ncommunication between the various virtual machines.  The easiest ways I<br/>\ncan think of are:<br/>\n<br/>\n- server and client programs communicate with their parent process (i.e.<br/>\nthe test method) using standard input and output (after spawning a new<br/>\nProcess using Runtime.exec(...), you would use the getInputStream() and<br/>\ngetOutputStream() methods of the resulting Process to establish<br/>\ncommunications with the spawned program).<br/>\n<br/>\n- server and client programs communicate with their parent process using<br/>\nnetwork connections -- perhaps the server and clients create<br/>\nServerSockets bound to ports you specify using a startup argument, and<br/>\nthe test method creates sockets to communicate with those ports.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\n<br/>\nbn</div>",
