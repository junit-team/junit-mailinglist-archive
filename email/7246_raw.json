If I want to run all the tests, then\nglobal.data should only be loaded once.  type1.data should be only\nloaded once and accessible for all tests of type1, then unloaded when\nall type1 tests are done.  Then type2.data gets loaded (only once)\nwhile needed and then unloaded.\n\nI was going to use TestSetup, to do the extra setup for me, but where\ndo I store the data?  I can&#39;t store it in a subclass of TestSetup,\nbecause then the Test contained by TestSetup won&#39;t have access to the\ndata.  Is there a general way of doing this type of thing?  In fact,\nmore generally, JUnit doesn&#39;t seem to have any concept of test data. \nAll examples and documents I&#39;ve seen assume that the data can be\nhard-coded into the test itself, which is not always practical.  Are\nthere generally accepted ways of loading data (and hierarchies of data)?\n\nThanks much in advance.\nJacob\n\n\n",
