However, request the favor of a quick indulgence. Would you be\n  &gt; willing\n  &gt; to share some url&#39;s that talk about testing Swing apps ?\n\n\n  Sorry we did that work about 5 years ago now. I expect that most of our\n  testing was about the business logic.  BTW if you&#39;re interested in testing\n  GUI&#39;s have your considered Micheal Feather&#39;s &quot;The Humble Dialog&quot;?[1].\n\n  Cheers\n  Mark Levison\n\n  [1] http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/TheHumbleDialogBox.pdf\n  ----------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Blog: http://dotnetjunkies.com/WebLog/mlevison/\n\n\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n  SPONSORED LINKS Basic programming language  C programming language\nComputer programming languages\n        The c programming language  C programming language  List of\nprogramming languages\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n--\n  YAHOO!
