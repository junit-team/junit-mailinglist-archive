Most of them are, as Mike indicates,\nbare of method-level javadoc, the test name suffices.\n\nFor the tests that involve business logic, sometimes.  The case I&#39;m\ntesting is sometimes complex enough that it&#39;s difficult to tell which\ninformation is related to the condition I&#39;m testing, and which data is\n&#39;required&#39; data, but has no affect on the unit under test.  For those\ntests, a word or two about just what the heck is going on is very\nhelpful, even when the test name is 80 characters long.\n\nThe wide majority of tests are undocumented and simple, which is the\nway I think it should be.  But when you need it, you really need it.\n\n-Kevin\n\nOn Wed, 05 Jan 2005 14:41:42 -0500, J. B.

When I&#39;ve\n&gt; done it in the past, I&#39;ve found that the Javadocs merely restate the\n&gt; code in English, and those are the kinds of comments I find useless,\n&gt; even distracting.\n&gt; --\n&gt; J.
