The \nproblem I see is in the release paste.  On the one hand, you have a \nframework that must stay stable, and on the other hand optional \nlibraries that must be released more frequently.\n\nThe solution would be yet another project on sourceforge, with \nguidelines and organization, to be able to release often and only for \nthe interested users (so no complain that some classes &quot;pollute&quot; JUnit).\n\nSame thing for the generation of TestCase files.  Often the proposed \nsolutions are not meant to be easily parameterized because they were \ndeveloped for a certain environment.\n\nAnyway, it&#39;s maybe time for somebody to step forward.  No, no don&#39;t look \nat me like that! :-)\n\n-Vladimir\n\n\n-- \nVladimir Bossicard\nwww.bossicard.com\n\n\n",
