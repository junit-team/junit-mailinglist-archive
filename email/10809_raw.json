I ended up doing both for\nmy current project.  I&#39;m working on a client/server app so I ended up\nessentially faking the data from the server that the client reads in order\nto test the client component by itself.  In addition, I added integration\ntests that have the client accessing the server and parsing its output\nlive.  The two sets of tests tell me different things.  If I only had the\nintegration tests, it would be more difficult to tell where the problem is\ncoming from although not impossible.\n\nMocking up the real world objects carries some risk, of course.  Namely\nthat the real world objects will change before you can update the mock\nones, and then your tests are out of date and possibly giving false\nindicators of success.  Or that the mock implementations will have bugs\nand also give false indicators of success or failure.\n\nIn reality, whether to do one or both depends on how much time you have\nand which will provide greater value.  Don&#39;t forget the downstream\nmaintenance consequences.  That is project-dependent and only you can\nanswer that.\n\nJeremy\n\n--\nJeremy Schertzinger\njeremys@...\n\n\n",
