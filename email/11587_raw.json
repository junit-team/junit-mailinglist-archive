The problem is that I&#39;m\n&gt; having difficulties accessing protected members of my EJB. Example: I\n&gt; have a session bean that I&#39;m unit testing and I want to test a\n&gt; protected method but it appears that I can only access the bean\n&gt; through the remote interface. \n\nThere is absolutely, positively, indubitably /nothing/ to be gained from \nmaking any method of an EJB implementation class anything other than \npublic, with the lone possible exception of stopping some idiot from \nsubclassing it. (So don&#39;t subclass it!)\n\n &gt; Does this mean I have to define all of\n&gt; the protected members in the remote interface so my test can access\n&gt; them? The problem that appears is when you lookup the session bean.\n&gt; You get a reference to the home interface and call create on that\n&gt; interface. This returns a proxy to your bean and the proxy only\n&gt; implements the remote interface. I need direct access to my bean to\n&gt; get a good unit test. Is this possible? Am I doing something wrong?\n\nAh, you are ready for step 2: testing the logic of the EJB without the EJB.\n\nLet me guess: your non-public method does something entirely outside the \nrealm of J2EE. Would the method survive without the container? If so, \nmerely instantiate the class and test it, like a POJO. Yes, the method \nwould need to be public, but at least you could avoid even a fake container.\n\nDetails in _JUnit Recipes_, chapter 11.\n-- \nJ. B.
