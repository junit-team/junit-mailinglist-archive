As runners can&#39;t be composed, it <br/>\nshould be handled at the root like @Ignored<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; assertEquals&  IDE integration: an additional static assert method<br/>\n&gt; (when we change the built-in assertEquals, it breaks tests that have<br/>\n&gt; been running fine for years.  This tends to cause Bad Days for already<br/>\n&gt; over-worked people.  A separate static method is an easy way for<br/>\n&gt; people to opt-in to the new behavior)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>this doesn&#39;t make sense for me at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst who will call Assert.assertEquals in some cases and <br/>\nSomeUtils.assertEquals in other cases?<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, I&#39;m quite sure that changing<br/>\n   failNotEquals(message, expected, actual);<br/>\nto<br/>\n   throw new ComparisonFailure(cleanMessage, String.valueOf(expected), <br/>\nString.valueOf(actual));<br/>\n<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t have the drawbacks you describe. Even better it would align the <br/>\ncode to what is currently done for Strings.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Most interesting is ParallelRunner.  From your description, this<br/>\n&gt; appears to be a Runner that exposes the work already latent in the<br/>\n&gt; ParallelComputer class and others.  It would be interesting if you had<br/>\n&gt; to make any changes to the existing classes in order to produce this<br/>\n&gt; new Runner without duplication.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>just make the anonymous RunnerScheduler in ParallelComputer.parallelize <br/>\nreusable and it&#39;s done.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis was my last email on this subject. This is clear to me that you are <br/>\nnot interested in what I propose. I&#39;m not really surprised as it <br/>\nconfirms the experience made by others in the past. This is sad because <br/>\nI still think that a lot of JUnit users would love improvements but at <br/>\nthe end, it is your decision.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\nMarc.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nHtmlUnit support & consulting from the source<br/>\nBlog: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mguillem.wordpress.com\">http://mguillem.wordpress.com</a></div>",
