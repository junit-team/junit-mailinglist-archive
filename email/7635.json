I haven&#39;t measured, but I&#39;d have to guess around<br/>\n&gt; 70%.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If testing time is so high, then who wants to blame me for looking <br/>\n&gt; for Parasoft JTest to make testing more productive?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I know you don&#39;t blame me, but others did.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t remember someone blaming you for *wanting to try* Jtest. What I<br/>\nremember is *you* blaming *us* for using Junit and making unsustainable<br/>\nclaims about the effectiveness of Junit vs. DBC (without even having<br/>\ntried one of them). (My memory might be somewhat distorted, of course.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; And you understand that DbC is not such a bad idea as some people <br/>\n&gt; here believe.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I also don&#39;t remember anyone claiming that DBC is a bad idea. What I<br/>\nremember is *you* claiming that DBC could replace Junit (which simply is<br/>\nwrong).<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards, Ilja</div>",
