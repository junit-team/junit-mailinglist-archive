We didn&#39;t announce its availability widely until\n&gt; we thought we had something useful. We have gotten early feedback from a\n&gt; handful of developers, but we now have a release that we think can be used\n&gt; to write production tests.\n&gt; \n&gt; I understand that some people have been quoting our private to-do list out\n&gt; of context. Private communication between Erich and me will in future take\n&gt; place more privately. It is too bad that it is not safe to let you all into\n&gt; our process. It is disturbing to find one&#39;s to-do-list quoted as promises\n&gt; broken or ideas stolen. It was just an old  to-do list. Maybe it&#39;s time to\n&gt; invest in an electron shredder :-)\n&gt; \n\nI am sorry this got to you in the wrong form.\nPlease see it by yourself: http://themindstorms.blogspot.com/2005/06/junit-40.html.\n\nI was doing a feature by feature comparison. And that todo list was part of the CVS (and was talking\nabout RC and final version - so I haven&#39;t got reasons to believe it was old/deprecated).\n\nhope this clears out my intention,\n:alex |.::the_mindstorm::.|\n\n&gt; The theme of JUnit 4 is to encourage more developers to write more tests by\n&gt; further simplifying JUnit. To this end, we have followed NUnit&#39;s lead in\n&gt; identifying tests by annotation instead of subclassing and naming\n&gt; conventions. Tests can now live in any class. Tell JUnit they are there with\n&gt; the @Test annotation:\n&gt;   @Test public void basicTransaction() {...\n&gt; \n&gt; The assertion methods are in an Assert class which is most easily used\n&gt; through static import:\n&gt;   import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;\n&gt;   ...\n&gt;   @Test public void example() {...assertEquals(2, 2);...}\n&gt; \n&gt; Set up and tear down are handled with the @Before and @After annotations.\n&gt; You can have as many @Befores and @Afters as you need. Inherited @Befores\n&gt; are executed before @Befores in subclasses and inherited @Afters are\n&gt; executed after @Afters in subclasses.\n&gt; \n&gt; Shared setup is handled by @BeforeClass and @AfterClass. Methods with these\n&gt; annotations are executed once before (respectively after) all the tests in\n&gt; the class run.\n&gt; \n&gt; @Ignore causes a test not to be run, but it is reported as ignored.\n&gt; \n&gt; @Test takes two optional parameters. A test annotated @Test(timeout=100)\n&gt; will fail if the test takes longer than 100 milliseconds to complete. A test\n&gt; annotated @Test(expected=NullPointerException.class) will fail if a\n&gt; NullPointerException is not thrown and succeed if a NullPointerException is\n&gt; thrown.\n&gt; \n&gt; Preserving existing investment in tests has taken nearly half of our\n&gt; development effort. JUnit 4 is forward and backward compatible. You can run\n&gt; older tests with the JUnit 4 test runner by passing them to the runner. You\n&gt; can run JUnit 4 tests with older test runners by wrapping the JUnit 4 test\n&gt; class in a compatibility class. The following method in a JUnit 4 test class\n&gt; causes it to run correctly with the Eclipse test runner.\n&gt;   public static junit.framework.Test suite() {\n&gt;     return new JUnit4TestAdapter(AssertionTest.class);\n&gt;   }\n&gt; \n&gt; JUnit 4&#39;s command line interface can be invoked with:\n&gt;   java org.junit.runner.JUnitCore Test1 Test2\n&gt; \n&gt; The same interface can be invoked programmatically with:\n&gt;   JUnitCore.run(Test1.class, Test2.class);\n&gt; \n&gt; If you want to know more about the details of JUnit 4, you can browse the\n&gt; tests in org.junit.tests.*.\n&gt; \n&gt; Erich and I will be participating on the JUnit lists to discuss further\n&gt; simplification of JUnit 4, integration with test runners, and experiences\n&gt; using it. Our experience with it (most of the tests were written JUnit 4\n&gt; style) has been very positive. The complexity of JUnit 3.x is like a tiny\n&gt; pebble in a shoe. It doesn&#39;t seem like much until it is gone.\n&gt; \n&gt; Good testing,\n&gt; \n&gt; Kent Beck\n&gt; Three Rivers Institute\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo!
