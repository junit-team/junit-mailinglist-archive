Are you going to pass all these\nparameters in the constructor, store them in a separate field and then have\neach method use the particular field they need?\n\n&gt; The idea that I have to have tests run in a particular \n&gt; order to get repeatability strikes me as odd as well\n\nWhy would you need to do that?  We are just talking about being able to pass\nparameters to test methods.  The order in which these methods are invoked is\nirrelevant...  right?\n\n&gt; &gt; Yes, with @Factory.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks...\n\nBy the way, I believe that both TestNG (@Factory) and JUnit (suite()) made a\nmistake when implementing this concept of a factory:  it should be an\ninterface.\n\nBoth @Factory and suite() suffer from the &quot;too much magic&quot; problem:  no type\nchecking, signatures verified at runtime (and easily misspelled), etc...\n\nMaybe something like:\n\npublic interface ITestFactory {\n  public Object[] suite();\n}\n\n&gt; Have you thought about an option like this?\n&gt; \n&gt; @ParameterList({ &quot;oneName&quot; }, {&quot;anotherName&quot;}, {&quot;aThirdName&quot;}) \n&gt; @Test public void testSingleString(String firstName) { ...\n&gt; }\n\nYou mean defining the various values in the source itself?\n\nNo, I hadn&#39;t thought about it, but it&#39;s an intriguing idea.  My first\nreaction is that it would force me to recompile my source file whenever I\nwant to change or add a parameter, but I can see how a JUnit user wouldn&#39;t\nmind that :-)\n\nI&#39;ll forward this idea to the mailing-list, see what people think of it.\n\n&gt; The vast majority of times I want a parameterised test, I \n&gt; don&#39;t really want a _lot_ of parameters, but I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d \n&gt; want to muck around with defining the parameters in the XML \n&gt; either;\n\nFair enough, I&#39;m open to hearing suggestions, but I really think that you\nneed a way to be able to invoke the same test class with different values\nfor parameters.  How would you like to do that?\n\n&gt; I can tell you outright that the major reason I don&#39;t \n&gt; even want to think about converting a serious project to \n&gt; TestNG is that the XML file is a turn off.\n\nThe XML file is optional and mainly here to make it easy to drive TestNG\nwith tools (the Eclipse and IDEA plug-in use it a lot) or to provide\nrepeatability (testng-failed.xml, or just email a certain test suite to a\ncoworker).\n\nMost users simply invoke TestNG from ant or from the command line and they\nnever write a single line of XML.\n\n-- \nCedric\n\n\n",
