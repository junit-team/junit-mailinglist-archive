It was quite \ncool and effective, but it seems to have vanished... :(\n\nDavid Saff schrieb:\n&gt; All,\n&gt; \n&gt; A good chunk of the development work among committers on the JUnit\n&gt; project these days is done by pair-programming remotely. The problem\n&gt; is that most of the solutions we&#39;ve come across (VNC, Citrix,\n&gt; Microsoft) are either too sluggish to present the ideal illusion that\n&gt; we are sharing the same instance of Eclipse, or don&#39;t play well with\n&gt; the firewalls on our personal networks. Has anyone tried a remote\n&gt; pair-programming solution that they were 100% happy with? Thanks,\n&gt; \n&gt; David Saff\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
