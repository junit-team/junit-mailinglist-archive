However, <br/>\n&gt;sometimes certain things just are coupled, like a subclass to it&#39;s <br/>\n&gt;superclass. The class data for the superclass should exist before <br/>\n&gt;the subclass, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Why should the class have its own data?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Also, sometimes the more loosely coupled something is, the HARDER it <br/>\n&gt;is to reset it&#39;s cached data (across all interactions). And I guess <br/>\n&gt;this is really the problem. I want to zero out all cached data <br/>\n&gt;without having to know about the couplings that were created <br/>\n&gt;dynamically.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I would think that the easiest way to zero out all the caches is to create new cache objects. That&#39;s the point of a loosely-coupled system. If a class uses a cache, then that class should either accept the cache from the outside world or be unaware that it&#39;s using a cache at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nCaching is more of an extra service that should be implemented as a Decorator. The application should decide to add caching when it strings objects together to form the application. Either that or components should make caching configurable.<br/>\n<br/>\nGoogle &quot;Abstraction and detail&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJ. B.
