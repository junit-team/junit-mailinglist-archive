It&#39;s the way JUnit is designed<br/>\nto be used.  I&#39;ve seen Kent make the same point.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;Oh, but it&#39;s my approach that was attacked with a groundless claim.  <br/>\n&gt; &gt;Sorry for wondering why.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Wondering is good.  Research with an open mind is better.<br/>\n<br/>\nI try to make a habit of making bold, confrontational statements.  It<br/>\nchallenges people (you obviously took it as a challenge), get&#39;s their<br/>\nattentions, and stirs up discussion.  These are all good things IMO. <br/>\nMy intention is not to attack, just to startle.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, I do believe what I expounded is the best way to do it.  The<br/>\n*best* way, not the *only* way.  In fact I don&#39;t always do it the way<br/>\nI described, but I try to.  Just like I strive to have only a single<br/>\nassertion per test (sometimes to the extent of extracting a complex<br/>\ntest into a local assert method).  Again, I didn&#39;t come up with these<br/>\nideas, I just see the truth & value in them.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It may be that Dave was describing a general-purpose, <br/>\n&gt; one-size-fits-all approach that could be optimized in your specific <br/>\n&gt; case. If you ask him civilly, I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll respond. If you feel he<br/>\n&gt; was being uncivil towards you, then be the bigger man and tell him <br/>\n&gt; so, civilly. I missed his part of the exchange, so I can&#39;t say.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think I was being uncivil.  Just putting forth what I think is<br/>\nthe *best* way to do it.  The *best* isn&#39;t always doable... but like<br/>\nthe simplest thing, you should alwasy at least consider it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If you write code first, then &quot;likely&quot; add tests, why is that TDD? I<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t think it is.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No.  To be doing TDD you don&#39;t write code without a failing test that<br/>\nrequires it in order to pass.   THAT is TDD.<br/>\n<br/>\nKent&#39;s book does a fabulous job of showing you *What TDD is*. <br/>\nEveryone should buy it & read it repeatedly until the binding falls apart.<br/>\n<br/>\n*ahem* You should also buy my book when it comes out.  It&#39;s goal is to<br/>\nshow you *how to do TDD in Java*.  Hopefull it will have a lay-flat<br/>\nbinding so you can easily have it open next to your keyoard.<br/>\n<br/>\nDave</div>",
