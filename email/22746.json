You could have a<br/>\n&gt; @DataPoints method that returned 1000 random datapoints, and would<br/>\n&gt; only be called right before you needed it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Thank you for your input. I should definitely look into JUnit 4 Theories, a feature that I didn&#39;t know existed. <br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, even before I do so � and pardon me if I misunderstood your suggestion � it looks like your approach would generate all 1,000 random DataPoints at once. This would be even worse than my current approach, since the DataPoints we are talking about are large, expensive objects. Currently, each random input is nulled in tearDown() before the next one is instantiated in setUp(). Can I do that with JUnit 4 Theories? <br/>\n<br/>\nfor (int i = 0; i &lt; 1000; i++) {<br/>\n\t// create one random DataPoint<br/>\n\t// run the test on that DataPoint<br/>\n\t// GC the DataPoint<br/>\n}<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again for your suggestions. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
