When it&#39;s done, I see the summary of elapsed \ntime and number of testcases run along with any error stack traces.  \nIs there any way that I can change this output??  For example, it \nwould be nice to display the information like the name of the class, \nname of the test method being run, and followed by either a \nsuccessful message or a failure message with the associated stack \ntrace.  Is this possible and if so, what&#39;s the magic code sequence??? Thanks\nin advance for any help!!!! \n\n\n \n\nYahoo!
