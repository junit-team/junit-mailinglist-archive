Thanks...<br/>\n<br/>\nIn short, reflection makes it easier to write and run the tests.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a class named TestSuite which uses reflection to build an<br/>\nobject for all of the test methods on a test class.  In languages<br/>\nwithout reflection, the programmer has to add register each test method<br/>\nwith a suite manually.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is a pretty tedious process, and it is also prone to error.<br/>\nSometimes people who are using the C++ port of JUnit look at a test<br/>\nthat should fail and realize that the reason that it doesn&#39;t is<br/>\nbecause the registration of the method was accidently deleted.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMichael Feathers<br/>\nwww.objectmentor.com</div>",
