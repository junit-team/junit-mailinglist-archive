I&#39;d=\r\n suggest that a good strategy for figuring this out is\ndivide and conquer. =\r\nFirst take JUnit out of the equation and see if\nyou can get any kind of new=\r\nly created class to launch on save.\n\nFor more on some dynamic class loading=\r\n ideas for Eclipse, perhaps this\nblog entry I wrote will help..\n\nhttp://mil=\r\nesparker.blogspot.com/2009/03/dynamically-loading-classes-using.html\n\n\n\nOn =\r\nSat, May 16, 2009 at 8:59 AM, blekit@... &lt;blekit@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello,\n&gt;\n&gt; i&#39;m currently writing a plugin which is supposed to launch J=\r\nUnit4 Tests\n&gt; after each save. So far i&#39;m only loading every class that is =\r\nchanged using\n&gt; IResourceChangedListener and URLClassLoader:\n&gt;\n&gt; URLClassLo=\r\nader classLoader =3D new URLClassLoader(new URL[]\n&gt; {outputDirectory.toURL(=\r\n), new\n&gt; URL(&quot;file:/D:/eclipse/plugins/org.junit4_4.3.1/junit.jar&quot;) });\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n Class&lt;?&gt; clazz =3D classLoader.loadClass(fileName);\n&gt;\n&gt; At this point ever=\r\nything looks great - when i modify JUnit4 test class it\n&gt; gets loaded with =\r\nannotations on proper methods (thanks to second URL -\n&gt; without it no annot=\r\nation was loaded, and to be honest i don&#39;t know why).\n&gt; However, things sta=\r\nrt to go wrong when i pass the loaded class to\n&gt; JUnitCore.run method - the=\r\n result i always get says that there was &quot;No\n&gt; runnable method&quot; exception e=\r\nven though there are clearly some method\n&gt; annotaded with @Test...\n&gt;\n&gt; I ha=\r\nve little experience in writing plugins for Eclipse, so i&#39;m kind of lost\n&gt; =\r\nnow... I may suspect, that the problem is with not sufficient classpath\n&gt; (=\r\ncause it seems that it was a reason why i had to add another URL to class\n&gt;=\r\n loader) of my plugin. So i&#39;m asking if anyone ever tried to dynamically lo=\r\nad\n&gt; test classes from Eclipse plugin and run them using JUnitCore - if so,=\r\n I&#39;d\n&gt; be very grateful for helping me out with this problem.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks in=\r\n advance.\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Michal Olejnik\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n",
