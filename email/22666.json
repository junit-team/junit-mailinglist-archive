If you want to know whether your<br/>\n&gt; candidate can actually do TDD (as claimed on their resume), then there&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; only one good way to find out. And a candidate that started by testing all<br/>\n&gt; the exotic failure states, rather than working through the most useful<br/>\n&gt; features, would have revealed that they probably don&#39;t understand<br/>\n&gt; incremental development.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>TDD is not rocket science.  If a candidate manages to solve complex<br/>\nprogramming problems during the interview and they have never heard of TDD<br/>\nbefore, it will be easy for them to learn if you are imposing this at your<br/>\ncompany (a mistake in my opinion, but that&#39;s a separate topic).<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for your remark about incremental development, all the examples I have<br/>\nseen of TDD when you start from scratch begin by testing trivial cases.  It<br/>\nwill take at least a half hour before the candidate starts writing code<br/>\nthat&#39;s actually complex, which is why I think it&#39;s a waste of time in an<br/>\ninterview.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nCédric<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
