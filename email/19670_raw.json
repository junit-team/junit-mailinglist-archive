I want one &quot;TrueDefaultPolicy&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;for when we look up a FooPolicy and can&#39;t find it, we get something\n&gt;&gt; &gt;more useful than a null pointer. We can subclass, the GrandpaFooPolicy\n&gt;&gt; &gt;can subclass from the &quot;TrueDefaultPolicy&quot; and the FooPolicy can extend\n&gt;&gt; &gt;the GrandpaFooPolicy, but you need a concrete instance of a base, and\n&gt;&gt; &gt;you really only want one of them.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;It&#39;s reasonable to want only one of an object, but for me it comes down\n&gt;&gt;to one question: can I trust my team members not to create two? If I\n&gt;&gt;can, it makes sense to avoid the singleton. The enforcement that\n&gt;&gt;singleton brings is the solution to a problem, but the problem is social\n&gt;&gt;not technical. It pays to know whether you have the problem or not.\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;In short, no, I do not trust the team members. Nor do I trust the JVM.\n&gt;\n&gt;Teams are rarely made of just smart, dedicated, senior people. And even \n&gt;the best make mistakes, see Murphy&#39;s Law. So the good engineering \n&gt;response to Murphy, who was a real engineer, is to reduce the chance \n&gt;that folks can do things wrong. Even when the team is only me, I&#39;m not \n&gt;sure it is wise to &#39;trust the team&#39;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nPat, the thing is, I think we can generalize in either direction on this \nand it&#39;s dangerous either way. \n\nWe could say all applications are worked on by outstanding engineers who \ncan remember what they are supposed to do or not do in the code base, or \nwe can say all applications are absolutely critical and we can&#39;t trust \nourselves or our coworkers not to make mistakes so we must do everything \npossible to avoid them. \n\nThe fact of that matter is, all people and all applications are \ndifferent.  There are teams and applications with which I wouldn&#39;t \nhesitate to &quot;just create one&quot; rather than use a singleton, and there are \nteams and applications where I wouldn&#39;t do that simply because the team \nisn&#39;t a team or the application is so critical that spurious creation of \nan object could cause disaster.\n\nI think that we have to examine each situation for the cues that we need \nto make engineering decisions.  Otherwise they aren&#39;t really decisions.\n\nMichael Feathers\nhttp://www.objectmentor.com\nhttp://beautifulcode.oreillynet.com/\n\n",
