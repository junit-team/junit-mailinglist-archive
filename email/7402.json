    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1939138961\">For the last two years we have been writing &quot;real applications&quot; that have<br/>\nunit tests for every method.  These are complex, web-based apps that<br/>\ncurrently process billions of dollars worth of financial transactions each<br/>\nweek.  The largest of these consists of over 500 source files, with over 200<br/>\nof these being test classes.  The 900+ &quot;basic&quot; unit tests run in just under<br/>\n15 seconds, every time someone does a build.  There are another 100<br/>\nintegration-type tests (also written in JUnit) that run in 10-12 minutes<br/>\nwith every checkin.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy point with all of these numbers is that it is possible--and desirable--to<br/>\ndo unit testing for large applications.  No way would we live without our<br/>\nunit tests.  They have saved us many time, and enable us to make changes and<br/>\nadd new functionality *much* faster than we otherwise could.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe biggest thing that is required to get started is a commitment on the<br/>\npart of all invovled.  Just commit to yourselves and each other that you<br/>\nwon&#39;t write any more code that doesn&#39;t have a unit test for it.  It does<br/>\ntake some time up front to get it all figured out.  You have to learn the<br/>\nbasic testing patterns.  You will probably have to tweak your architecture<br/>\nsome so that you can write less-coupled code.  You have to get a feel for<br/>\nwhen to use a mock object, when to override a method in an anonymous<br/>\nsubclass (Java), how to write container-based code that will run outside a<br/>\ncontainer, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo it shouldn&#39;t be surprising that there is ramp-up time before you really<br/>\nget good at this.  Like trying to learn any new skill, it *does* initially<br/>\nslow you down before it speeds you up.  And yes, it&#39;s difficult while you&#39;re<br/>\nstill a novice.  But they payoff is well worth it!  When we started two<br/>\nyears ago, we had many of the same questions and concerns that you do.  But<br/>\nnow we&#39;re at the point where the question of whether to write unit tests as<br/>\nwe develop is a non-issue.  As far as we&#39;re concerned, you might as well try<br/>\nto write code without a compiler--you could do it, but why would you?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe good news is that people have solved almost all of the issues you are<br/>\nlikely to encounter.  If you ask the right questions, you can find papers &<br/>\nexamples of how to unit test almost every kind of code.  A book you should<br/>\nwatch for is Dave Astel&#39;s soon-to-be-published &quot;A Practical Guide to<br/>\nTest-Driven Development&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nJeff Nielsen<br/>\nDigital Focus<br/>\nwww.digitalfocus.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;swpalmer2001&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:scott.palmer@...\">scott.palmer@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, April 01, 2003 3:07 PM<br/>\nSubject: [junit] How do I make Unit Testing practical?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; First off I better say up front that this is not meant as a troll, or<br/>\n&gt; to start some sort of flame war about unit testing....  I&#39;m really<br/>\n&gt; looking for simple insight from people who have been where I am now,<br/>\n&gt; links to articles on the web and so forth....<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I like, the rest off you, have heard great things about unit testing.<br/>\n&gt; I believe a lot of it.  I want to start writing unit tests for my<br/>\n&gt; code and in general improve my development practices.   So I downloaded<br/>\n&gt; JUnit, and read through some articles and examples.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; They are all too trivial.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am struggling as to how I can write unit tests for &quot;real code&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; Most of the examples I see are testing objects that are VERY general<br/>\n&gt; (lists, or other simple container classes, a calculator, etc..).<br/>\n&gt; But my &quot;real classes&quot; are written for my &quot;real application&quot; and as<br/>\n&gt; such there is an entire environment that is created as they work<br/>\n&gt; together.  Testing the classes in isolation seems next to impossible.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Some people will be quick to jump in and say that this must be a<br/>\n&gt; fundamental problem with my design.. my classes shouldn&#39;t be so<br/>\n&gt; dependent on each other, or something similar.    In some (trivial)<br/>\n&gt; cases it is possible to write stand alone classes, and they are<br/>\n&gt; fairly easy to test in isolation.  But a complex application needs<br/>\n&gt; all sorts of classes that bind trivial bits together... and these<br/>\n&gt; classes must rely on the very classes that they are causing to work<br/>\n&gt; together.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I find that it is these classes that are difficult to<br/>\n&gt; compartmentalize where most of my bugs tend to show up anyway, but of<br/>\n&gt; course not always.   How do you unit test such beasts?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So far in all my attempts to get started at this I find that the test<br/>\n&gt; code itself becomes very complex - not as complex as my application,<br/>\n&gt; but enough that the time I would end up writing and debugging the<br/>\n&gt; test seems completely unreasonable.   I would love to have the<br/>\n&gt; finished tests, but I simply can&#39;t see how I could justify writing<br/>\n&gt; them, as it would more than double my design and coding development<br/>\n&gt; time.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In the end I would almost end up with an &quot;automated user&quot;, and of<br/>\n&gt; course that is a tad extreme and prone to it&#39;s own sorts of errors<br/>\n&gt; and assumptions.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve told co-workers about what I have read about unit testing,<br/>\n&gt; testing frameworks etc.  None of my co-workers do unit tests, and ll<br/>\n&gt; of them have the same attitude.  Unit testing is too<br/>\n&gt; complex/difficult to use when making real complete programs.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So I&#39;m asking... Who else has been down this path?  How do I get past<br/>\n&gt; this point?   Am I making sense or have I just gotten something<br/>\n&gt; completely wrong? Or is this unit testing just a passing fad that is<br/>\n&gt; really nothing more than a bunch of hype?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;       Yahoo!
