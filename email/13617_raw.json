For instance, do they &quot;back-out&quot;\n&gt; the\n&gt; amount of code represented by getters/setters and then report the\n&gt; percentage of remaining code covered?  Or - do they lower the goal to\n&gt; something considerably less than 100%?\n\nMy strategies/ideas are different depending on which end of the \ngreenfield-to-legacy spectrum we&#39;re on.\n\nThe closer to greenfield (= almost all code is test-driven) we are, the \nless important code coverage is as an primary measure of codebase \nhealth. We recommend measuring the marginal cost of each new feature \ninstead. If we keep that low/steady in spite of arbitrarily low code \ncoverage, we don&#39;t sweat it. If a client sweats it in spite of \nlow/steady marginal cost of each new feature, I start looking for my \nnext client. Life&#39;s too short.\n\nThe closer to legacy (= almost no code is test-driven) we are, the more \nI understand code coverage goals. I respect them more /only until/ we \nget the marginal cost of adding features down to something reasonable \n(at least mildly projectable). In that case, seeing a steady increase in \ncode coverage matters more than the speed of approaching an arbitrary \nstandard.\n\n&gt; Is anyone actually striving for near-100% code coverage?\n\nNo. I strive for low defect rates and consistent/projectable and low \nmarginal cost of new features. My clients appear to appreciate this.\n-- \nJ. B. (Joe) Rainsberger\nDiaspar Software Services\nhttp://www.diasparsoftware.com\nAuthor, JUnit Recipes: Practical Methods for Programmer Testing\n\n",
