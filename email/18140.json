Are warnings a hinderance for my tests to succeed? <br/>\n&gt;  Kindly let me know in this regard.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What you encountered is *not* &quot;a warning thrown by java code&quot; - in fact <br/>\nthere is no concept of a warning at runtime as far as Java is concerned.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat you encountered is a message to the console from log4j. That it <br/>\ncontains a &quot;WARN&quot; string has no effect on how your code runs at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course the message *could* indicate that there is a problem that will <br/>\ncause your code to not function as expected, which could let tests fail. <br/>\nBut then the same would be true if log4j did not write the warning <br/>\nmessage to the console. The message itself won&#39;t have any effect on <br/>\nJUnit at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes that help?<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers, Ilja</div>",
