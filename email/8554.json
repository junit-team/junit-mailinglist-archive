While using the junit and <br/>\n&gt;junitreport tasks in ant I found that you can control whether the <br/>\n&gt;tests show up as different line items in the report, or all as part <br/>\n&gt;of the parent. In this way, you junit reports generated by ant can <br/>\n&gt;be truly &quot;class-based&quot;. For those familiar with ant, I use the <br/>\n&gt;batchtest task to select my test cases based on the class name. All <br/>\n&gt;classes that end in &quot;Test.class&quot; get run. Therefore, if my inner <br/>\n&gt;class name ends in Test then in the report you get <br/>\n&gt;OuterClassTest$InnerTest (establishing a hierarchy in the test <br/>\n&gt;listing. Otherwise, you can have all of the test methods appear <br/>\n&gt;under the single OuterClassTest entry by naming the inner classes <br/>\n&gt;something else. Pretty handy...<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I hadn&#39;t seen that. Not bad. I&#39;ll tuck that one away.<br/>\n<br/>\nStill, you base your decision on the desire to test classes, rather than behavior (which may or may not correspond to a class). I don&#39;t always want to organize tests by the production class they test, because that gets in the way of refactoring the production class. I want to organizing tests by the behavior they verify....<br/>\n<br/>\nI find myself jumping from a test to the class/method it tests, rather than the opposite way. Maybe that&#39;s why I don&#39;t do what you&#39;ve described.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJ. B.
