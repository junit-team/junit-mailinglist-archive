But when the\n&gt;tests are run, the generated document shows that all these methods\n&gt;pass (questionably good).  This gives a false sense that the code\n&gt;being tested is being tested, when it really isn&#39;t because the test\n&gt;bodies are empty.\n\nThen fix the test generator. I use an explicit failure to indicate that\nI have not yet written the test. In fact, in my &quot;JUnit: A Starter\nGuide&quot;, I suggest starting with this test:\n\ntestSomething:\n    fail(&quot;Not yet implemented&quot;)\n\nAs I add code to the test, I keep the fail statement in there until I\nhave decided that the test is complete.\n\nIt sounds to me like you should consider changing the test generator,\nand not JUnit, to solve your problem.\n\n&gt;Is there a way to track the number of assertions that pass/fail\n&gt;instead of the number of methods that are invoked in the test classes?\n\nYes, there is a way. An event/listener mechanism on the assert* methods\nwould do the job. It&#39;s not difficult to write.\n\n&lt;snip /&gt;\n&gt;This way more the classes for which tests haven&#39;t yet been written,\n&gt;but the skeleton is up and running, would show up in the report as 0\n&gt;tests run, rather than whatever number of test skeletons have been\n&gt;generated\n&gt;and may or may not be empty.\n\nAgain, I strongly suggest that you generate tests that fail, or even\ngenerate a warning, rather than rely on the test/assertion count. How\nwill you know that MyTestCase has 0 assertions when you run it in a big\ntest suite?\n\nGood luck.\n\n\nJ. B.
