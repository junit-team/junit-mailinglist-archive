What you want to do is\n&gt; maximize the ROI of the time spent writing tests (i.e. get the biggest\n&gt; bang for the buck).  You need to find places in the codebase that\n&gt; would benefit the most from adding tests and go after those first. \n&gt; You just keep plugging away at it.. What&#39;s the worst problem?  Deal\n&gt; with it.  Now what&#39;s the worst problem.  Deal with it.. etc.  Also,\n&gt; when you work on a piece of code, wrap it in some tests first.  As you\n&gt; have more & more tests in place, you&#39;ll be better able to refactor\n&gt; into something that is more testable.. so you can add more & better\n&gt; tests.  Getting a legacy codebase under test (and under control!)\n&gt; isn&#39;t a big bang effort... it&#39;s gradual... part of everyone&#39;s daily work.\n\nAlong these lines... When a bug is found first write a test that\ncaptures the bug behavior, then fix the code.  That may be a significant\ninvestment, depending on the complexity of the bug.  But, it will be\nwell worth it to have the TestFixture that catches it to make sure it\ndoesn&#39;t happen again.\n\nAlthough I agree with Dave (above) I will say this about the metrics\nthemselves, I think 2 hours is pretty high, especially if the code is at\na reasonably well-factored state (which it may not be, unless you had\n*_really_* disciplined developers).  Even if it isn&#39;t at that state, I\nstill think two hours as the average is too high.  I would estimate .75\nhours max as the average which would put you at 6567.75 hours (approx.\n821 person days).\n\n=jason\n\n\n",
