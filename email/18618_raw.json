* Getting to 100% tested takes less time if we\n&gt; generate tests from a\n&gt; model than if we write them by hand.\n\n\nSure - getting methods that are 100% tested should\ntake 0 time (For the person doing the coding).\n\nI&#39;m really wanting to write more for elaboration, but\nI&#39;ll hold off, since I&#39;d most likely be reframing some\nof the earlier material.\n\nPlease let me know if you want me to put a different\nangle on it.  \n\nCheers,\n- Ole\n\n\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Is that a fair summary?\n&gt; \n&gt;    David Saff\n&gt; \n&gt; On 1/2/07, Ole Ersoy &lt;ole_ersoy@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Hey David,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m going to go over some obvious stuff, which you\n&gt; &gt; already know, just for clearity.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I tried to start with something really simple that\n&gt; &gt; represents everything we do when coding, which is\n&gt; &gt; mapping inputs to outputs and storing those inputs\n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; outputs in tighthy little slots on objects.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; So in that example we have two slots.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Let me just define a slot as something that can\n&gt; &gt; contain everything allowed/understood by a\n&gt; computer.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Then we constrained the slots by making them int.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Now they can only contain the subset of all values\n&gt; &gt; allowed that are int.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; So now we apply an Operation to the slots and put\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; result in a different slot.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; So we have a Class that with private int a,b,c\n&gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; an Operation defined in\n&gt; &gt; Java\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; public int multiply(int a, int b)\n&gt; &gt; return aXb;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; It does not really matter what that Operation is,\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; only thing we care about is that it correctly maps\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; inputs to the outputs.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; So lets start with the inputs.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; They have already been constrained.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; But is it done or is it possible that we need to\n&gt; &gt; constrain variable b further, to satisfy a API\n&gt; &gt; contract definition.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; For instance b must be between 100 and 200.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Quick side note(If an EMF model contained all the\n&gt; &gt; variables, a, b, c, etc.) and we needed to place\n&gt; &gt; constraints on a int datatype like this, we could\n&gt; use\n&gt; &gt; an invarient constraint for that.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; OK - Back to the logic.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; So we constrain b further so that  100 &lt; b &lt; 200.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; So now we are wondering whether our method works?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; By looking at the constraint for a&b, being that\n&gt; &quot;a&quot;\n&gt; &gt; is an int, and &quot;b&quot; is a further constrained int,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; and the mapping the method performs we know all\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; possible return values.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; We also know all the possible input values.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; But we don&#39;t want to test every single input to\n&gt; &gt; output...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 101X1, 102X1, ...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; So which ones do we test?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Let&#39;s start with the assuming that were always\n&gt; going\n&gt; &gt; to pass legal values.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; So we want to test the type constraint on a and b,\n&gt; &gt; being int.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; So lets just assume that on the platform we are\n&gt; &gt; running legal values are\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; -2222222222222222222 to 2222222222222222222\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; So we use these two end of range values.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; And we test\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 101 and 199 for b, since that represents b&#39;s set\n&gt; of\n&gt; &gt; edge points.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; So the combinations we want to test for any\n&gt; &gt; mathematical operations with these two parameters\n&gt; are:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  b              a\n&gt; &gt; 101 X -2222222222222222222\n&gt; &gt; 101 X 2222222222222222222\n&gt; &gt; 199 X -2222222222222222222\n&gt; &gt; 199 X 2222222222222222222\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If X works the way it&#39;s supposed to, then these\n&gt; tests\n&gt; &gt; should pass.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Also, we test\n&gt; &gt;  b              a\n&gt; &gt; 99  X -2222222222222222222\n&gt; &gt; 99  X 2222222222222222222\n&gt; &gt; 201 X -2222222222222222222\n&gt; &gt; 201 X 2222222222222222222\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; These should not pass.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Then we assume that all other values are taken\n&gt; care\n&gt; &gt; due to the definition of X.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; So were did we get the\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n99,201,199,101,2222222222222222222,-2222222222222222222\n&gt; &gt; values from.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Lets think of a and b as being datatypes.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; b is just a new datatype that can only\n&gt; &gt; have values between 100 and 200.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; So a DataType is just meta data defining an\n&gt; allowed\n&gt; &gt; set of values...which is where EMF or Java\n&gt; reflection\n&gt; &gt; comes in.  You would use them to analyze the meta\n&gt; data\n&gt; &gt; defined for a type.  Then combine that with\n&gt; knowledge\n&gt; &gt; of operators to generate test cases.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Does that make more sense?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Cheers,\n&gt; &gt; - Ole\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- David Saff &lt;saff@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ole,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m getting my head around your suggestions. \n&gt; (At\n&gt; &gt; &gt; least) one thing is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; tripping me up:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; On 12/31/06, Ole Ersoy &lt;ole_ersoy@...&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;What does it mean for a method to be 100%\n&gt; unit\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tested?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For instance suppose there&#39;s a method\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; public int multiply(int a, int b)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; return aXb;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do we unit test this?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n=== message truncated ===\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
