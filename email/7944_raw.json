Transforming an object \nwith changing\n&gt; state into a value object (which is *identified* by its internal \nstate) often\n&gt; requires you to change method names. And sometimes it just does \nnot make\n&gt; sense.\n&gt; \n&gt; Johannes\n\nI don&#39;t know how I can apply this to the solution of the example.\n\nSo stretchX(amount) will return a new Square object which is \nstretched by X and Y with the same amount?\n\n\n\n",
