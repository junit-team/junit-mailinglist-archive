I greatly apprecia=\r\nte all inputs and thoughts on\nthis. I googled and found no past or present =\r\nprecedent to estimating\nJunit test efforts based on Code complexity measure=\r\ns. I may have missed\nsomething important due to my ignorance and relative n=\r\newness to Junit\nand estimation. I shall gladly stand corrected by more know=\r\nledgeable\nfolks.\n\n---------------------------------------------\n*Hypotheses=\r\n\nThe working hypothesis for the effort estimation was &quot;a strong\ncorelation =\r\nbetween cyclomatic complexity of existing code and the effort\nto write juni=\r\nt tests for the code&quot;.\n\nAs a consequence of this hypothesis it is further p=\r\nurported that &quot;the\nnumber of independent execution paths (Cyclomatic comple=\r\nxity) is equal\nto the number of test methods&quot;. This dictates some nasty ter=\r\nms to how\nthe junit tests must be structured but it is believed to be a *re=\r\nsonable\nthing* for estimation purposes.\n\n\n*The estimation method\nWeighted M=\r\nethods Per Class (WMPC) was used as a measure of complexity.\nWMPC is define=\r\nd to be &quot;the sum of the complexity of all methods for a\nclass, where each m=\r\nethod is weighted by its cyclomatic complexity. The\nnumber of methods and t=\r\nhe complexity of the methods involved is a\npredictor of how much time and e=\r\nffort is required to develop and\nmaintain the class. Only methods specified=\r\n in a class are included, that\nis, any methods inherited from a parent are =\r\nexcluded.&quot;\n\nThe WMPC measured from the existing codebase was normalized for=\r\n trivial\nmethods like getter and setters. \n\nThe effort was estimated using =\r\na simple formula:\nTotal Effort =3D Total number of test methods * Average e=\r\nffort for one\ntest method\n\nThe Total number of test methods is calculated a=\r\ns follows:-\nTotal test methods =3D Average WMPC of all classes * Number of =\r\nclasses\n\nThe Average effort for one test method (note that this is test met=\r\nhod\nand not test case class) was estimated from actual efforts.\n\n*Sample ca=\r\nlculation\nNumber of Classes =3D 973\nAverage WMPC ~=3D 9 (normalized for get=\r\nter and setter methods. I used\nTogether ControlCenter-&gt;Metrics for all thes=\r\ne measures)\nAverage effort per test method =3D 2 hours (It is upto the deve=\r\nloper to\ndistribute the test methods in a test case classes)\n\nTotal effort =\r\nfor writing Junit tests =3D (9 * 973) * 2 hrs =3D 17, 514 hours\n=3D 2189 Pe=\r\nrson Days. \n(*huh..hmm*. Let the beatings begin. I can&#39;t adequaltely expres=\r\ns in\nwords my manager&#39;s bewildered expression on seeing this number. But,\nt=\r\nhat&#39;s another story.)\n---------------------------------------------\n\nIf the=\r\n general direction of the estimation is correct I would want to\nspend some =\r\ntime on refining the method to include all those important\nfactors I am sur=\r\ne I have missed out above. Suggestions and pointers\ntowards places I should=\r\n look more closely to get a better grip is more\nthan welcome. Thank you you=\r\nr time and valuable feedback.\n\n\nRegards,\nSelva.\nhttp://thescian.blogspot.co=\r\nm\n\n\n\n",
