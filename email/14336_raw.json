[...]\n\n--- Elliotte Harold &lt;elharo@m...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; A popular myth. I&#39;ve lost count of how many bugs I&#39;ve found\n&gt; in set and get methods, as well as other methods that were\n&gt; &quot;too simple to fail.&quot;\n\nTrue; very true.\n\nBut, I&#39;ve also seen teams fail by putting nearly all of their \ntesting effort into testing each and every get and set method -- &gt;&gt;&gt; \nand almost nothing else! &lt;&lt;&lt;  So they have lots of tests -- but poor \ncoverage, and just about no coverage of any business logic that \nmatters.  &quot;But we wrote lots of tests!&quot; they say.\n\nRarely have I seen simple get or set methods fail.  And recently, \nwhen it happened, I wrote *one* test, using reflection, to test \n*all* the get and set methods in the whole system.\n\n(Rational Rose has a bad habit of deleting method bodies when doing \nround-trip engineering.  You gotta watch for that.)\n\nThe XP rule is, &quot;Test everything that could possibly break.&quot;  Could \na get or set method be written wrong, so as to be broken?  Well... \nmaybe.  Maybe some tool deletes method bodies.  Maybe its code \ngeneration defaults to giving you bad method bodies (in some \ncases).  Maybe the data types won&#39;t always match between get, set \nand the private field.  When you find these to be issues on your \nproject, I would certainly encourage you to write tests for them.\n\n\n\n",
