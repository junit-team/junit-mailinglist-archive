So our <br/>\ncustomers sometimes don&#39;t want us to use an open source tool like <br/>\njunit because it isn&#39;t formally validated, e.g., doesn&#39;t have written <br/>\nrequirements, traceable to design, traceable to unit and system tests, <br/>\nwith the output of the tests captured.  Any suggestions for how to <br/>\naddress this other than telling them that junit is so extensively used <br/>\nit must work, e.g., is there a suite of junit acceptance tests or even <br/>\nunit tests that we can run to prove that it works according to its <br/>\nspecs?</div>",
