However, many people haven&#39;t refactored all fixture code into <br/>\nsetUp() and tearDown().  If this is the case, there could be some time-consuming <br/>\nfixture code in the test methods themselves.  This would mean that checking <br/>\ntimes after setUp() and before tearDown() would still be counting the fixture <br/>\nexecution time in with the Class Under Test execution time.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving a listener is another viable Plain Java approach, but you would still <br/>\nhave to manually fire the listener before and after you actual invocation of the <br/>\nclass under test.  This is the type of non-refactorable duplication that AOP solves.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not advocating AOP in all cases, in fact I think you should try hard to find <br/>\na Plain Java solution that works before resorting to AOP.  I&#39;m just trying to <br/>\nillustrate that it could be useful in a specific scenario:  Monitoring execution <br/>\ntime of the class under test if 1) you have fixture setup code in your test <br/>\nmethods and 2) the execution time of that fixture setup code could obscure the <br/>\nactual execution time of the Class Under Test.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost likely this isn&#39;t the situation of the original poster, so it doesn&#39;t <br/>\nmatter.  We can drop this thread before people start complaining :).<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nChad</div>",
