I see what you are saying.  I can make a &quot;Factory&quot; which assures \n&gt;the existance of one instance of my &quot;ConfigManager&quot; object.  This \n&gt;will probably solve the problem since I can &quot;substitute&quot; (make a mock \n&gt;object) for the &quot;ConfigManager&quot;, or for whatever objects it uses.  \n&gt;The factory is now the singleton that I must call like so: \n&gt;\n&gt;MyFactory.getInstance().getConfigManager();\n&gt;\n&gt;where the returned &quot;ConfigManager&quot; is now an interface or abstract \n&gt;class, whose concrete instance may be either a real or mock object.\n&gt;\n&gt;Is this correct?\n\nThat would certainly work.\n\n&gt;I liked your article &quot;Use your singletons wisely&quot;, however I did not \n&gt;fully grasp the &quot;three questions&quot;:\n&gt;\n&gt;1)Will every application use this class exactly the same way? \n&gt;(exactly is the key word) \n&gt;2)Will every application ever need only one instance of this class? \n&gt;(ever and one are the key words) \n&gt;3)Should the clients of this class be unaware of the application they \n&gt;are part of? \n&gt;\n&gt;What is being assumed about the classes use when you ask these three \n&gt;questions?\n\nI don&#39;t understand your question here.\n\nWhen considering whether a class should be a singleton, you must ask\nyourself those three questions. If you don&#39;t answer a resounding YES to\nall three, then the class probably does not want to a be singleton, so\ndon&#39;t make it one.\n\n&gt;Thanks again, and great article!\n\nThanks for the kind words. Even 18 months later, people are getting\nsome use out of it. I can&#39;t be upset about that. :)\n\n-----\n\nYou answered, in another e-mail, that you don&#39;t want an unsuspecting\nprogrammer to come along and use the second, public constructor by\nmistake. This is the biggest problem with global data: it has no\napplication context; therefore it&#39;s unclear that the data belongs to an\napplication. If data belongs to an application, then ask the\napplication for it. If there is no natural object that represents the\napplication (such as a servlet, applet or frame), then create one. In\nthis case, the Application class would play the role of &quot;toolbox&quot; as I\nwrote in my article. Now there&#39;s no doubt that it&#39;s the Application&#39;s\ninstance of the ConfigManager that application components should use.\nIn short: &quot;if the config manager belongs to the application, then put\nit there.&quot;\n\nHm... that sounds like a good post-script to my article. It&#39;s a shame\nthat developerWorks takes months to respond to e-mail. :)\n\n\nJ. B.
