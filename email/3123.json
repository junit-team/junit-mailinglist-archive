    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-303488759\">In addition to Jim&#39;s advice, start thinking about how to separate as much<br/>\nof your logic as possible from the framework. Rather than having all of<br/>\nyour code access the complex environment directly, write top-level<br/>\nroutines/classes which access the environment then pass just what is<br/>\nneeded to lower level routines/classes. Basically, you want to get to a<br/>\npoint where you can test most of the system in a straight-forward manner,<br/>\nthen you can figure out how to initialize or mock out the complex<br/>\nenvironment for the bit of code remaining.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Mon, 29 Oct 2001 <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jack_dimas@...\">jack_dimas@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I &#39;m new with JUnit and I&#39;m considering the possibility to use it in<br/>\n&gt; my applications. However I&#39;m puzzled how this can be done because all<br/>\n&gt; the classes that are used in my applications depend heavily on a<br/>\n&gt; framework. To explain:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I &#39;m using this framework to write my servlet applications. The<br/>\n&gt; framework consists of a main servlet that calls utility classes. This<br/>\n&gt; framework manages database connections and other resources via an<br/>\n&gt; environment object which is initialized every time I run my<br/>\n&gt; application and I request the first web page. This enviroment object<br/>\n&gt; is passed to every utility class I use in my application. Each class<br/>\n&gt; uses the environment object to make for example database queries, for<br/>\n&gt; session management, to get a handle to HttpRequest, HttpResponse and<br/>\n&gt; servlet objects and other useful things.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In a case like this how could I use JUnit? How can I initialize the<br/>\n&gt; environment object from the setUp method of a TestCase? I thought of<br/>\n&gt; creating HttpServletRequest, HttpServletResponse objects to pass to<br/>\n&gt; my utility classes but I cannot figure out a way to pass a servlet<br/>\n&gt; object.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
