What is it supposed to do with this counter value?<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; ...and is using *that* thing more complex than just having the &#39;get&#39;<br/>\n&gt;method? Is it worth the effort?<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;It&#39;s an interesting conunundrum.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;At least one design principle dictates the avoidance of get methods.<br/>\n&gt;Allen Holub is proponent of that practice, I believe -- the theory<br/>\n&gt;being that you keep sending information to objects until some<br/>\n&gt;object has enough information to carry out the desired operation.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I would be interested to know how Mr. Holub implements a View in a web application. While the Controller pushes the data into the View Template, the Template still needs to stick the customer&#39;s first name *here*, last name *there* and so on... this entails some way of either (1) retrieving the data or (2) allowing the object to display its data, however you prefer to look at it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI suppose one possibility is to hand the model object a stream on which to write itself. Smalltalk does this quite a bit. The bad news is that different applications display the same data differently, so the model is the wrong place to add the method &quot;printYourselfOn(..)&quot;. We could build specialized Presentation Objects that know how to print themselves on the view, but a typical implementation would look like this:<br/>\n<br/>\nCustomerPresentationObject<br/>\n    initialize(customerModelObject)<br/>\n        @model = customerModelObject<br/>\n<br/>\n    printYourselfOn(viewTemplate)<br/>\n        viewTemplate.firstNameField.setText(firstName)<br/>\n        ...<br/>\n        viewTemplate.orderTotalField.setText(orderTotal)<br/>\n<br/>\n    firstName<br/>\n        return @...    # No special formatting here<br/>\n<br/>\n    orderTotal<br/>\n        return CurrencyFormatter.format(@...)<br/>\n<br/>\nNo matter how you package it, some object has to grab data from the model and format it onto the view. How does Mr. Holub implement this?<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;snip /&gt;<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Of couse, any desire to keep such methods out of the production<br/>\n&gt;objects leads to interesting and problematic design issues, but<br/>\n&gt;it might be worth adding additional methods like:<br/>\n&gt;    eventNotificationListIncludes(EvenListener el)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is just a dressed-up &quot;get&quot; method. It allows the caller to query about the callee&#39;s state in order to make a decision. In this case, the decision is &quot;test passes&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think this is the right separation of responsibilities: the test should decide whether it passes, not the object under test. However, how does the test want to decide?<br/>\n<br/>\nOption 1.<br/>\nassertTrue(eventSource.contains(listenerIJustAdded))<br/>\n<br/>\nOption 2.<br/>\neventSource.add(listener)<br/>\neventSource.triggerEvent()<br/>\nassertTrue(listener.heardEvent())<br/>\n<br/>\nI prefer option 1, even if it adds a method that the event source wouldn&#39;t otherwise need. That&#39;s my choice. I think it&#39;s easier (on the whole) than the maintenance issues that option 2 implies.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;(Open question: Should such a method return a boolean or throw<br/>\n&gt;an exception??)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think clearly it should answer &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;. The name is &quot;contains...&quot;, which is a query. In Ruby, it&#39;d be &quot;containsListener?&quot; Clearly a &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; answer.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJ. B.
