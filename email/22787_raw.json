My unde=\r\nrstanding is that to create a test, I should be doing something along these=\r\n lines:\n\nclass Something {\n@Test\npublic void Test() {\nAssert.assertTrue(tru=\r\ne);\n}\n}\n\nTo add setup and take down, I just make methods that are annotated=\r\n with @Before and @After. Simple enough.\nNow, my understanding is that this=\r\n setup was developed to replace the old practice of making classes that ext=\r\nend TestCase and overriding methods in there to get the same functionality.=\r\n\n\nThe one thing that I can&#39;t seem to find is how I should be grouping tests=\r\n like these. Eclipse can run this class&#39;s tests for me, and that&#39;s all good=\r\n, but how should I be grouping tests if I want to run all the tests in a pr=\r\noject at the same time? I&#39;ve looked at TestSuite and tried to get it workin=\r\ng with classes that use annotations like this, but I can&#39;t seem to figure o=\r\nut how it should be done.\n\n\n",
