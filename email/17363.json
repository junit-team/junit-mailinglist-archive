I asked <br/>\nreaders and would-be readers of the book to join me and ask me questions <br/>\nabout testing, TDD and JUnit.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne person ventured that there &quot;wasn&#39;t much difference&quot; between writing <br/>\nthe test first and the code first, so he wondered why I stressed writing <br/>\nthe test first. Here is a rough approximation of my answer.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Well, first, let me ask you what happens when you write the code first, <br/>\nthen test it. There are a few possibilities:<br/>\n<br/>\n  * write the code, write the tests, they pass, all is well<br/>\n  * write the code, write the tests, one fails, debug<br/>\n  * write the code, find it difficult to write the tests, rewrite the <br/>\ncode to be easier to test<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I&#39;m sure there are more, but that&#39;s good enough for now. I imagine <br/>\nyou&#39;ve experienced all three of these. [He had.] Now take a guess how <br/>\noften #2 and #3 happen. [He guessed around half the time for each.] Take <br/>\na guess how often #1 happens. [He guessed less than half the time.] Now <br/>\nlet&#39;s do a little computation.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Suppose that 1/2 the time, you get happy path #1. That means that 1/2 <br/>\nof 1/2 the time, or 1/4 of the time, you write the code, then either <br/>\nhave to rewrite it to write the tests, or write a test that causes the <br/>\ncode to fail. If you had written the tests first, that 1/4 of the time <br/>\nwould disappear, and the 1/2 of the time you get happy path #1 wouldn&#39;t <br/>\nbe any different.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Now that I think of it, that&#39;s wrong. Path #3 is like refactoring to be <br/>\nable to add the next feature. Suppose that that cost is the same. Now, <br/>\nsomewhere between a negligible amount of time and 1/4 of the time, TDD <br/>\nhelps you by reducing the likelihood you&#39;ll write code that fails a test <br/>\nyou know you need to write, because by writing the test first, you won&#39;t <br/>\nstop after writing code that fails the test.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Now notice that this is a /best/ case scenario, based on your <br/>\nexperience. It&#39;s likely that you get happy path #1 less than 1/2 the <br/>\ntime, so the number of times you hit paths #2 and #3 is greater. This <br/>\nincreases the cost of test-second compared to test-first.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nLet&#39;s bring this back to your example.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt;  &gt; &gt; With test first, you have something like: Test v1, Code v1, Test v2,<br/>\n &gt;  &gt; Code<br/>\n &gt;  &gt; &gt; v2, Test v3, Code v3. Check in.<br/>\n &gt;  &gt; &gt;<br/>\n &gt;  &gt; &gt; If you postpone your testing a bit, you have: Code v1, Code v2, Code<br/>\n &gt;  &gt; v3,<br/>\n &gt;  &gt; &gt; Test v3, Commit.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If you postpone your testing a bit, you have: Code v1, Code v2, Code v3, <br/>\nTest v0.1, Code v3.1, Test v0.2, Code v3.2, Test v1, Code v3.3, Commit. <br/>\nThis is because the act of writing the tests exposes flaws in the design <br/>\nthat make the test difficult to write.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ.
