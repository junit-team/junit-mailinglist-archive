We use TeamCity to run the tests, which does a great job of informing=\r\n developers and non-developers alike, at it is very easy to trigger a build=\r\n, and it will support pre-commit test running, but your DBAs would have to =\r\nuse eclipse to relate to their source control system (IDEA, or Visual Studi=\r\no).\n\nFor it to work, of course, you have to update some test database. For =\r\nthat, I recommend dbDeploy. You can put that together into the build to mod=\r\nify a defined database that is made for these pre-test commits.\n\nAnd althou=\r\ngh it doesn&#39;t seem you need it, we use DBUnit to set the database into a kn=\r\nown state before the tests run.\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;binarymonk0=\r\n1&quot; &lt;binarymonk01@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hey all,\n&gt; I&#39;m having a hard time searchin=\r\ng for the right terms to describe what I am looking for, so posting a quest=\r\nion here --\n&gt; \n&gt; Environment:\n&gt; Java 5/6, mixed windows/linux environment (=\r\nfor use-case, assume all Windows desktops), Eclipse IDE for java developers=\r\n, mix of junit 3.8/4.0 tests, and a LOT of already existing junit tests tha=\r\nt include regression/database testing.\n&gt; \n&gt; Scenario:\n&gt; Junit tests already=\r\n exist and do integration testing to the database backend, including direct=\r\n SQL queries, hibernate/JPA queries, and stored procedure calls (MS SQL).  =\r\nPeople who are non-java/non-junit are going to make changes to the database=\r\n and stored procedures (for many different projects).\n&gt; \n&gt; Question:\n&gt; Is t=\r\nhere an easy way for a non-java/non-junit person to, basically, one-click r=\r\nun unit tests to see if changes they made will cause issues to the existing=\r\n regression/unit tests?  The ease-of-access and results is the key/critical=\r\n part, as otherwise they will just keep asking development staff to run the=\r\nm and ask for feedback.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks for any tips/ideas/tooling!\n&gt; \n&gt; -dhart=\r\nford\n&gt;\n\n\n\n",
