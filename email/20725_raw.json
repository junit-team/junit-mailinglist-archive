So a direct support by JUnit for dependencies out of the box would be id=\r\neal I think.\n\nIn your example I would need to store the result of canLogin =\r\n() into a global variable. Otherwise the canLogin-test would be executed mu=\r\nltiple times if canLogin() dependency is needed in more than one test. This=\r\n is what a framework like JUnit could do more productively and correctly th=\r\nan a programmer.\n\nIn test specifications often dependencies are stated (tes=\r\nt Y depends on test X for example). A test implementer could simply use tha=\r\nt information easily if JUnit would support dependencies out of the box, fo=\r\nr example with a @Dependency annotation. Of course one would need to take c=\r\nare not to have cyclic test dependencies. This should be analysed before te=\r\nst execution by the framework.\n\n\n--- On Wed, 7/23/08, David Saff &lt;david@saf=\r\nf.net&gt; wrote:\nFrom: David Saff &lt;david@...&gt;\nSubject: Re: [junit] Does J=\r\nUnit 4 now support dependencies?\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nDate: Wednesday,=\r\n July 23, 2008, 1:32 PM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n            Hans,\n\n\n\nThere is a way =\r\nof getting very close to what you want in JUnit 4.4 and\n\nbeyond, with assum=\r\nptions:\n\n\n\nprivate boolean canLogin() {\n\n  // return true if login works\n\n}=\r\n\n\n\n\n@Test public void login() {\n\n   assertTrue(canLogin ());\n\n}\n\n\n\n@Test pu=\r\nblic void launchMissiles( ) {\n\n   assumeTrue(canLogin ());\n\n   launchMissil=\r\nes( );\n\n   assertFalse( enemyBase( ).exists( ));\n\n}\n\n\n\nThis is more general=\r\n than test dependencies, because it allows tests\n\nto depend on conditions t=\r\nhat are not really tested (for example, you\n\nmight have tests that assume y=\r\nou&#39;re running on Windows).

But it has\n\n&gt; advantages.\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt; Consecutive tests which depend on fail=\r\ned tests, are not executed, which\n\n&gt; speeds up the tests. It also increases=\r\n the information value. People are not\n\n&gt; confused with dozens or even hund=\r\nreds of failed tests when just one or two\n\n&gt; tests really failed on which m=\r\nost other tests depend. I know of situations\n\n&gt; where there are dozenzs of =\r\nfailed tests (or more) reported by CruiseControl,\n\n&gt; and noone looks into t=\r\nhem until one week before release date. This happens.\n\n&gt; It makes developer=\r\ns afraid to look into the apparent mess. If there would be\n\n&gt; just one or t=\r\nwo failed tests, they would look into it more likely, and\n\n&gt; sooner.\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt; =\r\nThe heuristic strategy would not really solve the problem. since it is not\n=\r\n\n&gt; equivalent to the dependency specification. It would still run all tests=\r\n,\n\n&gt; but the likelyhood that the first run tests are the cause for all the =\r\nerrors\n\n&gt; would not be very high I think, whereas you could trust the depen=\r\ndencies\n\n&gt; very much if they are set correctly.\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt; Dependencies are a fr=\r\nequent topic. We have it in OSGI, in issue tracking\n\n&gt; software, in project=\r\n management software, in requirement specifications and\n\n&gt; in test specific=\r\nations. Why not support it in JUnit tests too?\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt; Well, this is just som=\r\ne quick thoughts about it. This issue alone will\n\n&gt; certainly not draw peop=\r\nle to other test frameworks, but it would improve\n\n&gt; JUnit I think. Noone w=\r\nould be forced to use that feature, but I think it\n\n&gt; would be good, if one=\r\n could use it with JUnit, even in an coarse way (for\n\n&gt; example if the depe=\r\nndency &quot;testApplicationSer verRuns&quot; passed).\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt; Bye,\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt; Hans\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt; --=\r\n- On Thu, 7/17/08, Kent Beck &lt;kentb@earthlink. net&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; From: Kent Be=\r\nck &lt;kentb@earthlink. net&gt;\n\n&gt; Subject: RE: [junit] Does JUnit 4 now support =\r\ndependencies?\n\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups. com\n\n&gt; Date: Thursday, July 17, 200=\r\n8, 9:28 AM\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt; Hans,\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt; I agree that test dependencies are a good idea=\r\n.
