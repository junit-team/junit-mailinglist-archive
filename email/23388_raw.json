The good news is that GitHub has\nreleased Issues 2.0, which, among other things, fixes the sorting\noptions in the issues display, among other goodies.  The bad news is\nthat they&#39;ve not only removed the ability to vote on bugs, they&#39;ve\neliminated the ability to display or sort by existing votes.  As you\nmay know, I was using votes as a way of prioritizing future\ndevelopment (and was getting excited about getting to the end of our\nrecent round of red tape, so we could start closing more of them\ndown!)\n\nI currently have a request in to github to at least let us know what\nthe final count was.  Moving forward, it seems that the new interface\ncan sort by comment count.  I&#39;ll probably use that as a proxy for\ncommunity interest (feel free to make simple &quot;+1&quot; comments if you feel\nthe need) for the time being, but I&#39;m open to other suggestions.\n\nThanks,\n\n   David Saff\n\n",
