So if you have two\nvariable &#39;a&#39; and &#39;b&#39;, in procedure language it is &#39;add(a, b)&#39;, while in object\noriented language it is &#39;a.add(b)&#39;.  In fact, I think in the early days of C++\nthe compile just convert a.add(b) to add(a, b).\n\nHope that is clear.\n\n\nJason Rogers wrote:\n\n&gt; He said he was the author of the code, so I don&#39;t think that will work.\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Keith Ray [mailto:keith.ray@...]\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, August 07, 2001 1:27 PM\n&gt; To: &#39;junit@yahoogroups.com&#39;\n&gt; Subject: [junit] re - novice QA\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;I am invading your group as a mere QA intern. . .  I am supposed to\n&gt; &gt;implement JUnit tests on code that I have just written. However, what\n&gt; &gt;I have learned in school does not seem to apply here!  We learned\n&gt; &gt;that if the method is an &quot;add&quot; method, give it two numbers,\n&gt; &gt;and &quot;assert&quot; that the correct addition is performed, and so on. . .\n&gt; &gt;well, I have no clue what to assert!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Quick rundown of what I am testing:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Basically, my code is using the Reflection class to check all the\n&gt; &gt;members of a class for a certain type of compatibility.  Most methods\n&gt; &gt;add errors to an error vector, and then there is a simple print\n&gt; &gt;function to print out the vector... How on earth do I test this\n&gt; &gt;class??\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Thanks for any help in advance!!\n&gt; You should pair-program with the writer of this code to refactor it to be\n&gt; more testable. Search the web for &quot;test-first-design&quot;, &quot;test-first-coding&quot;,\n&gt; &quot;refactoring&quot;, etc... search Ward&#39;s Wiki as well:\n&gt; &lt;http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?FindPage&gt;.\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
