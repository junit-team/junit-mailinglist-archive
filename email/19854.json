I understand you are<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; currently doing this as an exercise, so it&#39;s healthy to take it to<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; extremes and do everything by the book in order to learn, but in your<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; real work, use your judgment and decide for yourself when you are<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; indeed writing too much code, in which case it&#39;s probably safer to go<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; the usual route (get your code to work, then write tests for it).<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; The downside of TDD is that you can end up writing a lot of tests for<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; business code that you quickly throw away and rewrite, so the amount<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; of churn can be quite high.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  I&#39;m surprised that you quickly throw away business code and rewrite it<br/>\n&gt;  when you have tests. Why wouldn&#39;t you refactor it?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Incidentally, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s wise to tell a novice to &quot;use your<br/>\n&gt;  judgment and decide for yourself&quot; about the areas in which the novice is<br/>\n&gt;  learning. If their judgment in that area were sound, they wouldn&#39;t ask<br/>\n&gt;  such elementary questions, on average.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Fair enough, but I think it&#39;s equally dangerous to tell a novice<br/>\n&quot;always do this&quot; or &quot;always do that&quot;.  In doubt, just ask, and the<br/>\noriginal poster did just that.<br/>\n<br/>\nFeedback so far:<br/>\n<br/>\n- His friends say it&#39;s too much work<br/>\n- Some people tell him &quot;It works, but here is a better way than what<br/>\nyou&#39;ve done&quot;<br/>\n- Others tell him &quot;sometimes it is indeed too much work&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nNot having a lot of experience in an area also means you&#39;re not quite<br/>\nsure who to listen to, so at the end of the day, you sometimes do have<br/>\nto listen to your instinct...<br/>\n<br/>\nAt any rate, I hope Yang Gu is learning something from this discussion...<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nCédric<br/>\nAuthor &quot;Next Generation Testing in Java&quot; (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tinyurl.com/yvyxa3)\">http://tinyurl.com/yvyxa3)</a></div>",
