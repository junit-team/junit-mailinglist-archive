You both completely understood my\n&gt; situation.\n\nI&#39;m glad.\n\n&gt; Yes, I am a top-down design sorta guy. Especially as in most projects I\n&gt; work on there is very little upfront technical design (no UML,\n&gt; Requirements specs, etc). Thats why i liked TDD, I could start from the\n&gt; &#39;front-end&#39; and the design just fell out natuarlly because I was always\n&gt; thinking about the use of the code.\n\nHere&#39;s how I recommend you proceed:\n\n1. Write a top-level test, which will probably drive out the design of a \nfew objects. Do this on a piece of paper, very roughly.\n\n2. Back out the top-level test (&quot;ignore&quot; it).\n\n3. Test-drive the individual objects you designed in step 1.\n\n4. Re-introduce the top-level test and see whether it already passes.\n\nRepeat.\n\nThis is not exactly Story TDD, but it&#39;s similar in concept.\n\n&gt; JB calls it &quot;Story Test-Driven Development&quot;. Apart from the obvious Kent\n&gt; Beck/XP books is their any more info on this?\n\nwww.industriallogic.com\n\nJosh Kerievsky, as far as I know, coined the term. If not, he \npopularized it.\n-- \nJ.
