I have many testing classes in different packa=\r\nges.\n2. Each testing class may have its own @Before and @After methods.\n3. =\r\nSome things have to be done for the whole testing class once...\nshould it b=\r\ne put in a class  constructor?\n4. I need to create a database environment b=\r\nefore all tests from all\nclasesses are run. \n@BeforeClass seems to be calle=\r\nd once at the beginning... but then\n@AfterClass is called before other test=\r\n classes are run. \n\nIt looks like, in jUnit4 all testing classes are comple=\r\ntely separated\nduring testing.\nPlease, explain what is the philosophy of jU=\r\nnit4 because there are so\nfew documents on it.\n\nHow can I create and run a =\r\ntest suite in Eclipse using its GUI?\n\n\nThanks,\nKK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
