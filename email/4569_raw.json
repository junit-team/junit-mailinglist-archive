Could\n&gt; you tell m=\r\ne how Unit Testing can be discussed without discussing \n&gt; its impact on des=\r\nign?\n\nI am sorry that I made myself misunderstood in this way.  What I\ninte=\r\nnded to say was: lets make the discussion clear for those who don&#39;t\nwant to=\r\n participate in/read the &#39;testing private methods&#39; thread, and\nmove to a &#39;T=\r\nesting & Design&#39; thread that brings the issue into better\nfocus.  I see tha=\r\nt my mistake was to omit &#39;private method&#39; when I\nmentioned separating Desig=\r\nn and (private method) Unit testing.\n\nWhat we could be saying then is:\n- to=\r\n those who want to test private methods, use another tool\n- to those who wa=\r\nnt to learn about how testing can improve design, keep\non reading (this thr=\r\nead)\n\nThe statements above are not mutually exclusive, and, therefore, can =\r\nbe\ndone in conjunction.\n\nAlso, we could try to discover how many of this ma=\r\niling list&#39;s readers\nwould actually like to be able to test private methods=\r\n (democracy?).  If\nwe find this to be a respectable percentage, we could th=\r\nen proceed to\nfind out whether they know of the benefits testing only publi=\r\nc methods\nhas on design.\n\n&gt; [...] JUnit was not built for that purpose. Not=\r\n only that, its\n&gt; creators feel \n&gt; (well Kent, anyway; I don&#39;t know how Eri=\r\nch feels) that one of \n&gt; the strengths \n&gt; of JUnit is that when the tests b=\r\necome painful to write, \n&gt; there is a tendency \n&gt; for the design to have an=\r\n organic weakness that prevents the \n&gt; testing. As \n&gt; Kent says in this cas=\r\ne, it&#39;s an opportunity to learn about \n&gt; your design.\n\nI also know about Ke=\r\nnt&#39;s position, and how much testing plays a part in\nhow HE sees development=\r\n practices should be undertaken (XP, TDD).\n\n&gt; \n&gt; If you are going to say, &quot;=\r\nTake your testing/design\n&gt; discussions elsewhere,&quot;\n\nI am *really* sorry if =\r\nmy post could be misconstrued in that manner!\nOnce again, I believe I menti=\r\noned the fact that many an insight has been\ngained from these discussions. =\r\n Keep it up!\n\n&gt; It&#39;s all in how you define &quot;unit&quot;. To me, it&#39;s the exported=\r\n\n&gt; methods of a \n&gt; class or interface. Kent and Erich may define it differe=\r\nntly. \n&gt; Clearly, you \n&gt; define it differently. \n\nI was only voicing my opi=\r\nnion for the testing of private methods being\nas it is a popular request.  =\r\nI myself believe in the benefits of testing\npublic methods only, and theref=\r\nore have no need for that functionality.\n\nI would add that, since testing o=\r\nf private methods is such a popular\nrequest, JUnit&#39;s position on the matter=\r\n should be clearly stated in the\ndocumentation (README, index.html, FAQ, ..=\r\n.), and why (pointer to\nTesting & Design discussions).  [A quick search on =\r\nGoogle revealed that\nthe only place private methods are mentioned on the ju=\r\nnit.org site is\nwhere JUnitX is mentioned.]\n\n&gt; You folks can test private m=\r\nethods until your brain pops out,\n&gt; but just don&#39;t \n&gt; expect JUnit to do it=\r\n out of the box. It was never designed \n&gt; for that. It was \n&gt; never designe=\r\nd for that *on purpose*. I don&#39;t know why that \n&gt; is such a big \n&gt; deal.\n\nA=\r\nnd it isn&#39;t!  I am just questioning whether *on purpose* is actually\nthe re=\r\nason, or whether it was never envisaged to be used that way.  Once\nagain, I=\r\n am just trying to asses how many people would like this\nfunctionality, and=\r\n how many would reconsider after reading about how\nTesting can affect Desig=\r\nn.\n\nManuel Amago.\nmailto:mamago@...\n\n\n\n",
