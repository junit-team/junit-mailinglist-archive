I&#39;m pretty sure I have my filters right; I&#39;ve done \nenough jpcoverage before.\nI&#39;ll look into useing ant&#39;s jpcoverage task.\nMT\n\n--- In junit@y..., &quot;Scott Stirling&quot; &lt;scottstirling@r...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; I always go the other way -- use Ant&#39;s jpcoverage to run JProbe\n&gt; Coverage.  Easier to automate most of the steps (run x n, merge,\n&gt; report).\n&gt; \n&gt; Last time I got 0% coverage was because I accidentally had a * \nexclusion\n&gt; filter.  Check your filters in the Coverage launchpad.\n&gt; \n&gt; Another benefit to Ant&#39;s jpcoverage is that the exclusion/inclusion\n&gt; mechanism is a little more &quot;in your face.&quot;  And if you use \njpcovreport,\n&gt; you get a much nicer looking report than the JProbe HTML report.\n&gt; \n&gt; Scott Stirling\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; &gt; From: majortaylor [mailto:majortaylor@y...] \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hi,\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m trying to get some code coverage for my junit tests. I&#39;m \nusing \n&gt; &gt; JProbe Coverage from Sitraka software to get the code coverage \n&gt; &gt; information.\n&gt; &gt; JPCoverage calls ant which in turn runs my unit tests. I&#39;ve been \n&gt; &gt; careful to set &quot;fork=&quot;no&quot; in my junit ant task so that my tests \nrun \n&gt; &gt; in the same jvm as ant.\n&gt; &gt; Despite this, and despite the fact that it&#39;s clear my tests are \n&gt; &gt; executing, jpcoverage is still reporting 0% coverage of my \n&gt; &gt; code. Does anybody have any experience with this? I&#39;m \n&gt; &gt; wondering what I \n&gt; &gt; could be doing wrong.\n&gt; &gt; I realize that there&#39;s also a jpcoverage ant task which would \nthen \n&gt; &gt; run JProbe inside my ant project (rather than vice versa); would \nthis \n&gt; &gt; be a superior approach? I suspect I would have the same problem.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thanks,\n&gt; &gt; MT\n\n\n\n",
