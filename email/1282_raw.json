Some things I hadn&#39;t thought\nabout before. I kind of agree with you Ilja that if you&#39;ve got something\nthat complex, then it might indicate that it may need to be pulled out on\nits own. However I can also see that there could be plenty of situations\nwhere that would not be appropriate.\n\nIn my experience most private methods are typically helper methods and not\nof the high complexity variety that Nic described. I think it would be\noverkill to test these. I have always worked to the rule of thumb that you\ntest the externally visible interfaces, and I think that is still valid for\nthe majority of cases. I accept though that there may be situations where it\nmay be beneficial to take things to a deeper level of granularity. If that\nis the case how do people do this? The only way I can think of is to use\nreflection.\n\nMatt\n\n \n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Ilja Preu?\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSent: 23/05/01 15:00\nSubject: AW: [junit] How to test protected and private methods/ fields?\n\n&gt; As a specific example, say I&#39;ve got some computation that\n&gt; involves a fairly\n&gt; hairy algorithm in one place.  I probably want to encapsulate\n&gt; that algorithm\n&gt; into its own method so, e.g., I can Substitute in a new\n&gt; Algorithm later when\n&gt; someone points out that I (again) made the problem a lot\n&gt; harder than it needed\n&gt; to be.  I may well want to make that method private, though,\n&gt; as its existence\n&gt; or signature could reveal more about the internals of my\n&gt; class than I&#39;d like;\n&gt; it might, e.g., have an argument that refers to a component\n&gt; of some (private) field.\n\nYou could put the algorithm in its own class. So you could test it\nthrough\nthe public interface of the algorithm class without breaking\nencapsulation\nof the client class. Additionally you could easily use an other\nalgorithm by\njust pluging in an alternative implementation (without having to rewrite\nthe\nclient class).\n\nciao, Ilja\n\n\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\njunit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n \n\nYour use of Yahoo!
