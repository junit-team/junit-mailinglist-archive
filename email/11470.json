They are the first users of the production code <br/>\nand if they are hard to write, other production code that uses the code <br/>\nunder test will also be hard to write. Development includes thrown <br/>\nexception types (throw specifications). If I write throws Exception at <br/>\neach unit test, I may hide a cumbersome exception specification in the <br/>\ncode under test -- in production code I don&#39;t want to have throws <br/>\nException attached to every method.<br/>\nIn short terms: I write no throws to my tests, unless the compiler <br/>\ncomplain, and the more often I have to do that, the more often I think <br/>\nabout my throw specifications.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobert</div>",
