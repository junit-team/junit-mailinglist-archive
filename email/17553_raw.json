The alternative to TDD is code that is not repeatably testable.\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; Therefore I consider TDD to be a minimum professional standard.\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; Developers who do not use TDD fall below that standard.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; I can&#39;t quite agree with that, but I would be thrilled to wake up one\n&gt;  &gt; morning to find out that it&#39;s true. If that became /the/ minimum\n&gt;  &gt; professional standard (whatever that would mean), I wouldn&#39;t complain.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m not quite sure I know what you are disagreeing and agreeing with.\n\nYes, I was unclear.\n\nI think you wrote, essentially, that &quot;good code&quot; is impossible without \nTDD. That&#39;s the thing with which I don&#39;t quite agree. Let me check the \nthread to be sure...\n\n&lt;pause /&gt;\n\nIt turns out I was wrong, so let me double back.\n\nI wonder about the notion of TDD being a minimum professional standard, \nonly because it&#39;s about process, and not results. I would agree with low \ndefect-rate, well-designed, easily-maintained code being a minimum \nprofessional standard, and TDD being an excellent way to achieve that. \nIt is my preferred way to achieve that. I am not prepared, however, to \nrequire it.\n\nI hope that clarifies the matter.\n-- \nJ. B.
