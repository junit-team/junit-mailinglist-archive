I&#39;m writing a new test \nrunner called Jumi http://jumi.fi/ which will have native support for \nrunning tests in parallel in the same JVM, and it take care of capturing \nthe System.out/err of individual tests.\n\nJumi will do the output capturing by replacing System.out/err with its \nown implementation, which saves all print events (the same way it saves \ntest lifecycle events), synchronizes both out and err (I think all \ncurrent IDEs and build tools fail this: \nhttps://github.com/orfjackal/misc-tools/blob/master/src/test/java/net/orfjackal/bugs/SystemOutErrBugTest.java), \nand also takes care of capturing the output of threads spawned by the \ntest thread. For long-lived threads, such as AWT event dispatch thread, \nI will also try to figure out something (I&#39;ll timestamp all print \nevents, so it should be possible to figure out roughly which test \nprinted things in the AWT thread).\n\nThe output capturing is at the top of my TODO list, so I will have it \nimplemented after a couple of productive afternoons when I have time to \nwork on it. Soon after that I&#39;ll make the first alpha release.\n\nI&#39;ve looked a bit at how to integrate Jumi with maven-surefire. Jumi and \nSurefire have some overlap, for example both of them take care of \nclassloading and starting a JVM process. One option is to use Surefire&#39;s \nclassloading and use only the core runner parts of Jumi. Otherwise Jumi \nwould need information that what are the dependency JARs, what are the \ncurrent project&#39;s classes, maybe also that which of them are test and \nproduction classes (Jumi will do caching of the dependencies&#39; class \nloaders to speed up the tests). That would require changes to Surefire, \nor then a completely new Maven plugin.\n\n\nkristian@... wrote on 4.1.2012 8:51:\n&gt; Sorry, I was doing just what I sometimes dislike of our own users ;)\n&gt;\n&gt; The real problem I want to solve is associating console output from a\n&gt; running thread to a given test-case (for parallel runs). We have this\n&gt; fairly well covered already and we manage to capture everything that\n&gt; happens within a given test-case for that test-case.\n&gt;\n&gt; The real problem is that the RunListener API does not demarcate\n&gt; test-classes properly, so I am unable to distinguish console output\n&gt; happening in @AfterClass of one test with @BeforeClass on the test-class\n&gt; on the same thread.\n&gt;\n&gt; This problem has been in the corner of my eye for quite some time and\n&gt; I&#39;ve been trying to find a decent angle to solve it from. I promise not\n&gt; to do anything that is frowned upon, which is why I asked ;)\n&gt;\n&gt; Kristian\n&gt;\n\n-- \nEsko Luontola\nwww.orfjackal.net\n\n",
