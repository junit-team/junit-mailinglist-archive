(I even stopped reading Dan Brown&#39;s Da Vinci Code for a while :-). I love\nthe way that each recipe is presented. It is very clear and concise. There are\nloads of good ideas and techniques in each recipe. Even something as simple as\ntesting getters/setters provides important information and discussion from\nvarious angles. It is very good to see different opinions of the industry about\nthe treated subjects laid out properly and objectively. I can&#39;t wait to find\nsome time to read more...\n\nJ.B. Thanks for such a valuable resource. &quot;JUnit Recipes&quot; certainly has its\nplace at the top of my library, next to GoF&#39;s Design Patterns and Bloch&#39;s\nEffective Java.\n\nRegards,\n\n - Yagiz Erkan -\n\n\n",
