    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-25570166\">By your logic, it sounds as though one might as well do away with the<br/>\nprotected keyword, as well as default package access behavior.  That is, you<br/>\nare saying that if class A&#39;s methods are accessible to members of its<br/>\npackage and subclasses or only its package, then what the programmer should<br/>\ndo is define the methods of class A as public.  You said that &quot;if the client<br/>\nhas no business touching these parts, make them private.&quot;  But we should say<br/>\nthat while a client can be an unknown, external process or third party<br/>\nlibrary, a client can also be a class in the same package of our own<br/>\nlibrary.  The existence of the various access modifiers gives us finer<br/>\ncontrol than the binary choice of public/private.<br/>\n<br/>\nScott Stirling<br/>\nJRun QA<br/>\nMacromedia<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Jason Rogers [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jason.rogers@...\">jason.rogers@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Monday, June 11, 2001 10:09 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: [junit] Best Practice for Tests ?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; IMO...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;     &gt; It simply make testing easier, without changing the <br/>\n&gt; protection of<br/>\n&gt; existing code. <br/>\n&gt;     &gt; We find it sometimes easy to test part of a flow (which usually<br/>\n&gt; resides in a separate method) rather than <br/>\n&gt;     &gt; check the public interface function. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Then shouldn&#39;t these be made part of the public interface and <br/>\n&gt; allow the<br/>\n&gt; client to interact with them?  If the client has no business <br/>\n&gt; touching these<br/>\n&gt; parts, make them private.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;     &gt; Also, I take the term &quot;public interface&quot; as relative. <br/>\n&gt; If an object<br/>\n&gt; exposes an interface (set of methods)<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; to its peer objects within its package, I see no reason <br/>\n&gt; not to test<br/>\n&gt; it, even though those methods are<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; package-protected. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I guess I disagree here.  I am not convinced that <br/>\n&gt; package-potected methods<br/>\n&gt; are part of a public interface.  If they are used that way I <br/>\n&gt; would question<br/>\n&gt; whether some refactoring needed to take place.  But that&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; just my opinion.<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t want to seem like I am picking on your design decisions.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -Jason<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
