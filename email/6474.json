Our tests are around a server which is started and configured<br/>\nsuch that the tests can run against the server.  We&#39;re currently<br/>\nstarting and configuring the server as part of the base test class&#39;s<br/>\nconstructor, but since we don&#39;t currently allow more than one instance<br/>\nof our server to be running at a time, we cough up some errors.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis isn&#39;t a major problem per se, but I&#39;m looking to get a greater<br/>\nunderstanding of how jUnit works w.r.t. this situation and learn if<br/>\nanyone else has had a similar situation and how they&#39;ve resolved this<br/>\nissue for themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance,<br/>\n<br/>\nTom Robbs</div>",
