In there, I\nwanted to read my DTD and assert that each element was properly\ndocumented (attributes, parents, children) as well as an existing\nTestCase and implementation.\n\nI implemented that using an custom implementation of junit.framework.Test\nwhich did the required testing.\n\nThis technique allows you to receive two failures in your final report if\nyou had two corrupted URLs.\n\nHope that helps !\nFrancois Beausoleil\nJava Gui Builder - http://jgb.sourceforge.net/\n\nOn Mon, 07 Oct 2002 14:44:10 -0000, &quot;beuys1234&quot; &lt;beuys@...&gt;\nsaid:\n&gt; Servus,\n&gt; I think that should be a common known problem, but I didn&#39;t find any \n&gt; answer in the FAQs so I try it here.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have a tree-like structure with URLs that I have to check. I want \n&gt; to walk through the tree recursively and check the URL at each node. \n&gt; If one of the URLs are corrupted I want to throw a failure or an \n&gt; error and proceed with checking.\n&gt; \n&gt; What I don&#39;t want to have is to fill a Map or something like that, \n&gt; where I collect corrupted URLs, while I don&#39;t throw a failure each \n&gt; time i foun a bad URL, but printing the corruptedLinksList after \n&gt; TestTermination.\n&gt; Insted of this, I would like to generate a TestCase for each URL in \n&gt; the tree dynamicaly at runtime and run this TestCase at each URL-node \n&gt; of the tree. \n&gt; Is this possible? Is there any example, how to do this? Does anyone \n&gt; have any better idea?\n&gt; \n&gt; Have a nice and peacefull day!\n&gt; \n&gt;     Wolfgang\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
