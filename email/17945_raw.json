There is no value-add\n&gt; here.  Right?  No additional value to customers and no additional\n&gt; value to developers.  It is simply style.\n&gt;\n&gt; Or, am I fundamentally missing something.\n\n\nI don&#39;t know about fundamentally missing something. But some small added\nvalue comes from being able to derive my test case from any class (including\nObject). On some rare occasions its been helpful to derive my test case from\nthe Object under test (BTW I&#39;ve only done this with NUnit in .NET land).\n\nIn addition assuming the test runners are like those in NUnit/MbUnit it\nwould be possible to write a new test runner that accepted tests\ndynamically. With some integration testing we did on a .NET project I used\nthis feature (it was fully baked into MbUnit) to create a test per query\nfile. The tests ran the query, exported the output and then compared the\nresults to a previously saved set of results. This allowed QA to extend the\nregression testing as they tested new features or bugs - without any\nintervention from the development team.\n\nMark\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nBlog: http://www.notesfromatooluser.com/\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
