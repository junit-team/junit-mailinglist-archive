You use the JUnit Swing UI.\n&gt;\n&gt; 2.  You use JAXP in your test cases or any classes referenced in your test\n&gt; cases, or even any &quot;instanceof&quot; expressions that reference JAXP classes.\n&gt; (By JAXP I mean the whole set of javax.* classes plus the org.w3c.dom.* and\n&gt; org.xml.sax.* classes)\n&gt;\n&gt; I can go into this in depth, but the bottom line problems are that JUnit\n&gt; loads classes from the same place as the JVM&#39;s system loader; the classpath.\n&gt; This necessitates the use of an exclusion list to filter out certain class\n&gt; names that either must be loaded by the system loader, or you would like to\n&gt; have loaded by the system loader.  The JUnit loader does not always delegate\n&gt; to the system loader when it should, particularly in the case of JAXP, which\n&gt; is a weird mix of classes whose names begin with the filtered &quot;javax.*&quot; and\n&gt; the unfiltered &quot;org.w3c.*&quot; and org.xml.*&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; JAXP is a special case because it is based on a set of javax.* classes.  All\n&gt; javax.* classes are excluded from the JUnit loader by default (in the\n&gt; default excluded.properties file) in junit.jar.  But JAXP, as shipped from\n&gt; Sun, comes with a bunch of other classes in org.w3c.* and org.xml.*.  The\n&gt; interesting thing is a direct dependency between javax.* classes and some\n&gt; other classes not in the usual exclusion list of com.sun.*, javax.*, etc.\n&gt;\n&gt; So what can happen, and frequently does when using the JUnit Swing UI with\n&gt; test cases or other classes, such as Log4J, that use JAXP, is that the JUnit\n&gt; class loader (properly) delegates javax.xml.* classes it &quot;sees&quot; to the\n&gt; system loader.  But then the system loader loads up a bunch of org.w3c.dom\n&gt; and/or org.xml.sax classes as the result of initializing and loading that\n&gt; JAXP class.  Later, if the JUnit loader comes across some org.w3c/xml class\n&gt; that it&#39;s never seen before, it tries to load it because the classname\n&gt; doesn&#39;t match one of the patterns in the exclude list.\n&gt;\n&gt; But it&#39;s already been loaded through the &quot;backdoor&quot; as the result of some\n&gt; other class loaded by the system loader (remember, the JVM keeps classes in\n&gt; their own namespace by identifying them by their fully qualified name plus\n&gt; the instance of their _defining_ (not initiating) loader, AND, the JVM will\n&gt; attempt to assign all unloaded classes referenced by a defined class to that\n&gt; defining class&#39;s loader).  The JVM&#39;s classresolver routine keeps track of\n&gt; all these class loading events and &quot;sees&quot; that the JUnit loader is\n&gt; attempting to define a class that has already been defined by the system\n&gt; loader.  That&#39;s wrong because according to the rules of loader constraints,\n&gt; JUnit should delegate this load to the system loader.\n&gt;\n&gt; You can hack around this (I did) by catching the LinkageError in\n&gt; TestCaseClassLoader&#39;s loadClass() method and then making a recovery call to\n&gt; findSystemClass() -- thereby delegating to the system loader after the fact\n&gt; (which is OK).  This hack only works some of the time, though, because now\n&gt; you can have the reverse problem where the JUnit loader loads a host of\n&gt; org.*.* classes, and then the system loader violates the loader contraints\n&gt; at some point when it tries to do exactly what I described above with JAXP\n&gt; because it doesn&#39;t ever delegate to its child (the JUnit loader).\n&gt; Inevitably, if your test cases use many JAXP and related XML classes, one or\n&gt; the other ClassLoader will end violating the constraints whatever you do.\n&gt;\n&gt; So the solution in the existing JUnit is to definitely add org.w3c.dom.* and\n&gt; org.xml.sax.* to your excluded.properties if you&#39;re using any JAXP stuff.\n&gt;\n&gt; What can we learn from this?  Well, one thing is that it&#39;s a good idea to\n&gt; have your custom class loaders load classes from repositories other than the\n&gt; system classpath.  Note that the JVM&#39;s built-in classloaders work that way\n&gt; (one for the jre/ext dirs, another for the java.class.path).\n&gt;\n&gt; Anyway, the excluded.properties fix is just a matter of time before it\n&gt; becomes standard in JUnit, since JAXP will be a standard part of the 1.4\n&gt; JDK.  It&#39;ll be just like having org.omg.* excluded.\n&gt;\n&gt; Scott Stirling\n&gt;\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: chw@...\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Sent: 7/10/01 10:43 PM\n&gt; Subject: [junit] Class loader error with junit\n&gt;\n&gt; Folks:\n&gt;\n&gt; I am using Junit (I am a newbie at it) with Log4j (which we use\n&gt; extensively) and I cannot seem to get the Log4j stuff initialized.\n&gt;\n&gt; When I put the DOMConfigurator.configure() call from Log4j in main(),\n&gt; it is apparently lost when the test cases are run (different class\n&gt; loader? causing the singleton functions to use a different set\n&gt; objects?)\n&gt;\n&gt; When I put the Log4j config stuff in the setUp(), I get the following.\n&gt;\n&gt; Any suggestions what the problem is and how to work around it?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks\n&gt;\n&gt; Charlie\n&gt;\n&gt; java.lang.LinkageError: Class org/xml/sax/InputSource violates loader\n&gt; constraints\n&gt;         at\n&gt; org.apache.log4j.xml.DOMConfigurator.doConfigure(DOMConfigurator.java:\n&gt; 1169)\n&gt;         at\n&gt; org.apache.log4j.xml.DOMConfigurator.doConfigure(DOMConfigurator.java:\n&gt; 1039)\n&gt;         at\n&gt; org.apache.log4j.xml.DOMConfigurator.configure(DOMConfigurator.java:11\n&gt; 97)\n&gt;         at\n&gt; com.clearmetrix.outreach.datamodel.VisitorExperienceSqlOperationTestCa\n&gt; se.setUp(VisitorExperienceSqlOperationTestCase.java:38)\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
