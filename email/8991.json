I guess I got involved in the<br/>\ndiscussion, I thought it was (at times) useful. Since it was my first<br/>\nposting (and heck, I was throttled by moderation) how was I to know that you<br/>\ndidn&#39;t want discuss on the list.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> \t&gt; I&#39;d suggest some folks should think more between posts or take a<br/>\n </span></blockquote>discussion offline until things are resolved,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> \t&gt; then come back with a summary.  But this is so unusual for this list<br/>\n </span></blockquote>(thinking over the past few years),<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> \t&gt; it will probably return to normal soon by themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;d like to think I&#39;ve been thinking, but hmm ... let me think about that<br/>\nsome more ... Yup, I&#39;m pretty sure I was. You judge so harshly yet you admit<br/>\nyou deleted much of what was there. Couldn&#39;t you have just kept on deleting<br/>\nand kept this to yourself? No, I guess you want a quiet mailing list. Ok,<br/>\nyou win -- I&#39;m done.<br/>\n<br/>\nEvery other OSS list I know says discuss here, not in private, the<br/>\ndiscussion is part of the process & best archived for reference. Clearly the<br/>\nmain two noise producers failed to come to a summary, so observation by<br/>\nother was needed. A bunch of folks jumped in with what I considered<br/>\ninteresting perspectives, I was grateful for that, even if to you viewed it<br/>\nas more noise.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;\t+1<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>-1 -- but hey, I clearly don&#39;t fit here. I thought I was discussing<br/>\nsomething of small potential with the development team of junit, but I<br/>\nclearly got that all wrong. I guess from that mistaken hypothesis all<br/>\nconclusion is obviously worthless, so I should&#39;ve just given up when I<br/>\nthought about giving up.<br/>\n<br/>\nI learned a lot from these threads, just little of it was about junit & most<br/>\nof it was about this list&#39;s participants.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo more noise from me...<br/>\n<br/>\nregards<br/>\n<br/>\nAdam</div>",
