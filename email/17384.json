In my experience, TDD makes me go<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; faster on average. If Cedric allows this to be true, then how does he<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; propose I identify those cases where TDD would not make me go faster?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s never really. In my experience, any task that&#39;s a bit more complex<br/>\n&gt; than, say, a Money or a Bowling example, is probably something you should<br/>\n&gt; think twice before you TDD.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>So I think you mean that TDD never makes me go faster? But my <br/>\nobservation is that TDD almost always makes me go faster. I have <br/>\nrewritten months of code in weeks with TDD.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Also, knowing the final goal is different from knowing the API you will need<br/>\n&gt; to reach that goal, so then again, I would probably think hard and make sure<br/>\n&gt; that going TDD is not going to make me lose.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I find that interesting. Do you believe that when I practise TDD that I <br/>\ndo not think? Do you believe that when I practise TDD that I think less <br/>\nthan when I didn&#39;t? In some ways, TDD is like doodling: it helps me work <br/>\nthrough what I&#39;m thinking about.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; Not to be glib, but if I knew when that would happen, I would have a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; mansion on Grand Cayman already.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Avoid the East Side of the island, it&#39;s still recovering from Ivan.<br/>\n&gt; Georgetown is pretty, though.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Someday... someday...<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ.
