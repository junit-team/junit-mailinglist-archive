I have managed to write my own test runner that<br/>\nused constructor dependency injection and can run junit 4 tests.<br/>\nIt&#39;s not production level code at the moment but this does not<br/>\nmatter -I just need it for a research prototype for a paper I am working<br/>\non. I have also created a google code project, the actual code and a<br/>\nmore comprehensive explanation what the project is all about can be<br/>\nfound there: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://code.google.com/p/treaty/\">http://code.google.com/p/treaty/</a><br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://code.google.com/p/treaty/\">http://code.google.com/p/treaty/</a>&gt;  .<br/>\n<br/>\nMy feeling is that this (runtime testing of discovered services) is an<br/>\nimportant use case and as frameworks that use late binding such as<br/>\nSpring and Eclipse are gaining momentum, there will be increasing demand<br/>\nfor runtime verification. Whenever I coded Eclipse plugins in the past I<br/>\nalways found that having test cases attached to the extension points (at<br/>\nleast if the x point provides interfaces to be implemented by the<br/>\nextensions) would have made the plugins much better Eclipse could<br/>\nrun in a &quot;safe mode&quot; where test cases are executed whenever a<br/>\nplugin extending the respective extension point is loaded. That would<br/>\nalso make it possible to use this kind of design in applications that<br/>\nrequire high reliability.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe nice thing about test cases (for me at least) is that they can be<br/>\nused to define the semantics of methods in a sense that they exclude<br/>\nimplementations with unintended behaviour and therefore describe the<br/>\nintended model. I see them very much on the same level as interfaces,<br/>\nand not implementation classes.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,Jens<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Kent Beck&quot; &lt;kentb@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Jens,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I think I understand your situation. What makes it a challenge for<br/>\nJUnit 4<br/>\n&gt; is that the new architecture is a DSL and the binding is intended to<br/>\nhappen<br/>\n&gt; at compile time. I wonder if a JUnit 3.8-style test would be easier.<br/>\nHere is<br/>\n&gt; pseudo-code for what I&#39;m thinking:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; public void testDiscoveredList(Class klass) {<br/>\n&gt;     TestSuite suite= new TestSuite(ListTest.class);<br/>\n&gt;     for (Test each : suite.tests) { // Does this work for Enumeration?<br/>\n&gt;         ListTest test= (ListTest) each; // Sorry about the downcast...<br/>\n&gt;         each.setList(createList(klass));<br/>\n&gt;     }<br/>\n&gt;     junit.framework.TestResult result= new<br/>\njunit.framework.TestResult();<br/>\n&gt;     suite.run(result);<br/>\n&gt;     ...check results and act appropriately<br/>\n&gt; }<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On a larger scale, what is interesting to me about this example is the<br/>\nway<br/>\n&gt; the shift to a DSL encouraged earlier binding and the resulting loss<br/>\nof<br/>\n&gt; important (to you) flexibility.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m sure you could accomplish the above with the JUnit 4 model, but<br/>\nyou&#39;d<br/>\n&gt; have to circumvent more of it. We&#39;re trying to address this with the<br/>\nchanges<br/>\n&gt; in 4.5, but I&#39;m not sure it would easily accomodate your scenario even<br/>\nso.<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;d love to see a custom runner to prove me wrong, though.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Take care,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Kent Beck<br/>\n&gt; Three Rivers Institute<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   _____<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>] On Behalf<br/>\nOf<br/>\n&gt; jensnz<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, April 23, 2008 2:57 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: [junit] Re: testing interfaces only and dependecy injection<br/>\nin test<br/>\n&gt; cases<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What I am trying to avoid are explicit references to implementation<br/>\n&gt; classes in test cases, like in<br/>\n&gt; assertAddingAnElementIncreasesTheSizeByOne(new ArrayList());.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The background of my question is the following: I want to use tests in<br/>\n&gt; a scenario where interfaces describe services (like in OSGI). When a<br/>\n&gt; service becomes available (a class implementing the interface), I want<br/>\n&gt; to run all tests for this service at runtime (!) to verify that the<br/>\n&gt; service has the correct behaviour. I cannot do this at build time as<br/>\n&gt; the service is discovered dynamically and I don&#39;t own the<br/>\n&gt; implementation. So I somehow have to inject the service implementation<br/>\n&gt; into the test case before setUp is executed.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Jens<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>",
