There is no reason to use \n&quot;assert&quot; (use IllegalArgumentException instead)\n\n&quot;Similarly, assertions should not be used for argument checking in \npublic methods&quot; (assert guide)\n\nTesting the method with a TestCase will ensure that the method _always_ \nacts like it should.  If your class is bullet-proof and handles every \ncase possible, there is not need to use the &quot;assert&quot; keyword.\n\nThe only problem with tests is that you&#39;re only testing a small part of \nyour entire application at a given time (a class at a time, using mock \nobjects if necessary).  It can be really hard to test the application \nlike it should be used (with all classes interacting with eachothers, \nwith the GUI...).  Maybe the &quot;assert&quot; keyword can be used to test the \nunexpected when you&#39;re doing integration testing.\n\nBut I still have to find out the real value of the &quot;assert&quot; keyword.\n\nCan anyone convince me?\n\n-Vladimir\n\n-- \nVladimir Bossicard\nwww.bossicard.com\n\n\n",
