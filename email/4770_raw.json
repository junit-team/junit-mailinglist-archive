Splitting up the tests gave me more \nsatisfactory tests, and pinpointed errors.\n\nIf you want multiple failures, it sounds like you want a different \nmechanism than fail().\n\nThe advantage of having the methods be static is that you can do DbC \nand have pre-/post-condition failures reported like all other JUnit \nfailures.\n\nKent\n\n\n",
