I don&#39;t see how that&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; possible, since &quot;this&quot; cannot be null. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Either you misread or I miswrote the article (or both). The bug was not <br/>\nthat a NullPointerException was thrown. The bug was that a <br/>\nNullPointerException was *not* thrown when the client passed in null to <br/>\nthe public API.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce pointed out, it was obviously a bug. XOM doesn&#39;t allow most things <br/>\nto be null, and indeed promises they aren&#39;t. Prior to writing the test, <br/>\nI devised an incorrect solution to the problem that put the null check <br/>\nin the wrong place (the non-public method). Writing the test suddenly <br/>\nmade it apparent that my solution was wrong, and that I needed to put <br/>\nthe null-check elsewhere (the public method). Had I not written the test <br/>\nbefore fixing the bug, I likely would not have noticed this.<br/>\n<br/>\nTDD isn&#39;t just about testing. It&#39;s also about helping you look at your <br/>\nown code from a different angle. Sometimes that helps you see things you <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t otherwise notice.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n﻿Elliotte Rusty Harold  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:elharo@...\">elharo@...</a><br/>\nJava I/O 2nd Edition Just Published!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafeaulait.org/books/javaio2/\">http://www.cafeaulait.org/books/javaio2/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596527500/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/\">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596527500/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/</a></div>",
