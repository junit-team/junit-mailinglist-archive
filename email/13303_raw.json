B. Rainsberger&quot; &lt;jbrains@r...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt;  &gt; The design /is/ the point of the discussion.\n&gt; \n&gt; No, it is *a* point of discussion.  It&#39;s healthy to ask the original\n&gt; poster if this design is really necessary, but if they say &quot;yes&quot;, then\n&gt; we should just move on to solving their problem and not patronize them\n&gt; on how pure their architecture is.\n\nCedric, I don&#39;t know whether you actually read the entire discussion, \nbut /not once/ did I criticize the design of the production code. What I \ntold the OP a few times was that he was /misusing/ inheritance of test \ncase classes in JUnit, and it took him a while to see that I might have \na point worth worrying about. Not once did I suggest his production code \ndesign was bad. Not once. All I said was that inheriting test case \nclasses in JUnit without wanting to inherit the test methods was silly \nand that he could have the benefit of sharing test fixture data without \ninadvertently sharing test methods.\n\n&gt; In real life, faulty or imperfect designs are the norm.\n\nCedric, you just said in the previous paragraph that I shouldn&#39;t \npatronize. Now you patronize me. Maybe your message carries less \nstrength that way. :)\n\n&gt; If a framework forces you to change your design to be useful, you can\n&gt; bet that most companies will keep their design and choose another\n&gt; framework.\n\nI can also bet that a large segment of the population will fork over a \nbunch of money to see the latest Will Smith film, but that doesn&#39;t make \nit a good film. Popular, yes; good, not necessarily.\n-- \nJ. B. (Joe) Rainsberger\nDiaspar Software Services\nhttp://www.diasparsoftware.com\nAuthor, JUnit Recipes: Practical Methods for Programmer Testing\n\n",
