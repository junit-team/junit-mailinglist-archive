I find those stubs not to be very useful or helpful, but\n&gt;  &gt;&gt; that&#39;s just one man&#39;s opinion.\n&gt; \n&gt;  &gt;&gt; As for simulated method calls, you should look at JMock.\n&gt; \n&gt; Another very nice library for that is EasyMock v2.2. I have been using\n&gt; it for 2 weeks now and did not encounter a single problem. It is worth\n&gt; considering.\n\nEasyMock and JMock are definitely two different solutions to the same \nproblem, but from what I understand, EasyMock does not have easy support \nfor what JMock calls &quot;stubs&quot; (and what I call &quot;fakes&quot;).\n\nI would love an EasyMock expert to tell me what I&#39;m missing. How do I \nfake a method with EasyMock? That is, I want to setup behavior for a \nmethod without setting up an expectation for it.\n\nTake care.\n-- \nJ. B.
