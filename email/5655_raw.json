Each class has one or more  testcase \nassociated with it. All these testecases are are added to a test suite \nsuch that each package contains one testsuite... At the topmost level i \nwill be having a mastertestsuite running which would result in testing all \nthe units... How can i write setUps for one time operations within each \ntestcase.... For example while testing session beans i want the lookup for \nEJBHome to be done only once within a testcase.. How is this possible ??\n\nRegards\nDeepStepTom\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n",
