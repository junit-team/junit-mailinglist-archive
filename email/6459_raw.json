I look forward to\nother comments on it.\n\n&gt;While I explained why I come down on the side of testing behavior vs.\n&gt;methods explicitly, and why I think it is quite possible to test most\n&gt;private methods in that manner, I will concede that there are code or\n&gt;behavior paths that you may not be able to invoke in any other manner\n- for\n&gt;example, when it comes to exceptions or errors that are just unlikely\nto\n&gt;happen in normal circumstances, but for which you must create code to\n&gt;handle. It might be necessary to write explicit tests of private\nmethods in\n&gt;such a way as to invoke this code.\n\nIf an exceptional condition is difficult to recreate in a test, then\nsimply simulate it in a test. I&#39;m assuming programmer tests, here. If\nthe goal is to test how the handler handles the exception, then there\nare two possibilities:\n\n(1) The CUT itself throws the exception.\n\nIn this case, you can subclass the CUT and override the method in which\nthe exception is thrown, then consider &quot;Replace Subclass with\nCollaborator&quot;, a refactoring which I have written up at my web site.\nWhen it comes to testing, I find it much easier to &quot;configure\ncollaborations&quot; among classes, plugging in a &quot;Crash Test Dummy&quot; (see\nMike Bowler&#39;s presentation at the XP Toronto Users Group or the\nColorado Software Summit, likely at http://www.gargoylesoftware.com\nsomewhere) where needed to simulate the exceptional condition.\n\n(2) Some other object throws the exception and the CUT handles it.\n\nIn this case, expose a public interface to plug in another\nimplementation of the exception-thrower&#39;s interface. This is simple\nmocking.\n\nI&#39;m not sure that I understand why private methods are necessarily\ninvolved here. There&#39;s probably some specific situation that you&#39;re\ntrying to address. Are you willing to (and allowed to) post code as\nexamples?\n\nI hope you see good feedback on JUnitX. Sorry I couldn&#39;t give you any.\n\nJ. B.
