What could such a metric tell me that I don&#39;t <br/>\nalready know?<br/>\n<br/>\nKent<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In junit@y..., &quot;Michael Silverstein&quot; &lt;msilverstein@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t have a strong opinion one way or another but I&#39;ve seen a <br/>\nnumber of<br/>\n&gt; appends that held up some number of tests as a metric of the <br/>\neffectiveness<br/>\n&gt; of their unit testing. It would strike me that a more meaningful <br/>\nmetric<br/>\n&gt; would be the number of asserts, since that indicates how many <br/>\nconditions<br/>\n&gt; were checked for correctness. So it is true that a unit test passes <br/>\nor it<br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t and if it doesn&#39;t, you fix it and move on. However, if <br/>\nsomeone is<br/>\n&gt; going to tout metrics, they should at least pick one that is as <br/>\nmeaningful<br/>\n&gt; as possible. </span></blockquote></div>",
