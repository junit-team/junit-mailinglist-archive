I&#39;m not being smart.\nWhat I&#39;m saying is this, somehow the data or some initialization step\naffected the testing so that you got this exception. I don&#39;t think it is a\nquirk in the Vector class itself. You can always check the class by looking\nat the source for Vector if you want to make sure though (I&#39;m too lazy to do\nit right now myself :).\n\nHope this helps to guide your efforts.\n\n- Mike\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: sinnamon@... [mailto:sinnamon@...]\n&gt; Sent: Saturday, June 02, 2001 10:57 PM\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: [Fwd: Re: [junit] Off-topic: How is ArrayIndexOutOfBounds\n&gt; possible?]\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks for the suggestions.  The responses at least\n&gt; confirm that this should not happen if all of my\n&gt; assumptions are correct.\n&gt;\n&gt; The ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException has happened only\n&gt; once that I noticed.  If it is due to a bug, somewhere\n&gt; in class Vector or somewhere in the JVM or in some underlying\n&gt; native method, then it won&#39;t be an easy one to find.\n&gt;\n&gt; In the meantime, I will have to make an explicit check\n&gt; for the Exception, so that I don&#39;t inadvertantly miss it\n&gt; next time, and  also capture as much information as possible.\n&gt;\n&gt; If it does occur again, I will try out the suggestions.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks again.\n&gt;\n&gt; regards,\n&gt;\n&gt; James\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; From: Mike Clark &lt;mike@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [junit] Off-topic: How is ArrayIndexOutOfBounds possible?\n&gt; &gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Just to rule out the possibility that another thread is removing the\n&gt; &gt; last element from the vector in between the isEmpty() and remove()\n&gt; &gt; statements, you could explicitly synchronize the steps, as in\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;     synchronized(inMsgQueue) {\n&gt; &gt;         if(!inMsgQueue.isEmpty()) {\n&gt; &gt;             msg = (SimpleMsg) inMsgQueue.remove(0);\n&gt; &gt;         }\n&gt; &gt;     }\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Just something to try...\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Mike\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Peter Spitz wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The only thing I can think of is that the isEmpty() function\n&gt; is returning a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; value of &quot;false&quot; even if the array is empty. I&#39;d put in a\n&gt; test for that.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; This sounds silly to me even as I&#39;m typing it, but it&#39;s the\n&gt; best I can do\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and maybe it will trigger some other helpful thoughts.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Peter\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: James Sinnamon\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Junit Users,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sorry for this off-topic message, but it is posible that\n&gt; someone may be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; able to offer some useful advice:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; When I tested a program recently,  I got the error:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: Array index out of range: 0\n&gt; &gt; &gt;        at java.util.Vector.remove(Vector.java:806)\n&gt; &gt; &gt;        at org.multipi.ActorMailSorter.run(ActorMailSorter.java:33)\n&gt; &gt; &gt;        at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:484)\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ... it seems to be telling me that an attempt to remove element 0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of a vector, is causing a fatal error.  The code which triggered this\n&gt; &gt; &gt; error is:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;      if(!inMsgQueue.isEmpty()) {\n&gt; &gt; &gt;         msg = (SimpleMsg) inMsgQueue.remove(0);\n&gt; &gt; &gt;        ...\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; .... where inMsgQueue is a Vector.  Now assuming that there\n&gt; are no other\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thread\n&gt; &gt; &gt; processes trying to remove elements from the vector (and I\n&gt; believe this\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to be the  case), should it be possible for this error to\n&gt; occur?  From my\n&gt; &gt; &gt; understanding of  Vector\n&gt; &gt; &gt; objects, this should not be possible.\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
