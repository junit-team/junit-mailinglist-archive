(So if you modify method A.foo() and\n&gt; &gt; class B calls A.foo(), then\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; _ATest and _BTest will be executed.) This is to\n&gt; &gt; get around the problem of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; our test suite being really slow, which is\n&gt; &gt; something that I want to fix\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but cannot (for non-technical reasons).\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; WOW!!! That sounds much better than the other\n&gt; &gt; utilities I&#39;ve been\n&gt; &gt; &gt; able to find for this, and certainly more\n&gt; &gt; feature-rich than I&#39;d have\n&gt; &gt; &gt; time to write myself. Any chance that the\n&gt; &gt; TestSuite you write would\n&gt; &gt; &gt; be available?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I wouldn&#39;t be able to release the code I wrote for\n&gt; &gt; two reasons: it&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; probably copyrighted by my company, and it uses a\n&gt; &gt; lot of utility class\n&gt; &gt; code from my project (for preferences, files,\n&gt; &gt; strings, file lists, etc.).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; However, I&#39;d be happy to make a new project on\n&gt; &gt; SourceForge or something\n&gt; &gt; and create a version that isn&#39;t dependent on other\n&gt; &gt; code, especially if\n&gt; &gt; other people are interested in helping out.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I have to warn you that my design is probably all\n&gt; &gt; wrong because I don&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; really understand the JUnit architecture yet. I\n&gt; &gt; probably should have\n&gt; &gt; created a TestCollector or something, but instead I\n&gt; &gt; created a subclass of\n&gt; &gt; TestSuite that builds the list of TestCases and\n&gt; &gt; returns them by overriding\n&gt; &gt; the testAt() and tests() methods.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Erik\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; Yahoo!
