This results in making explicitly sure that\nall\n&gt; code is actually tested (more so than writing tests that access private\n&gt; methods directly) - which is the purpose, it is more productive, and it\nmay\n&gt; point out unused code or logic errors missed by just assuming that because\n&gt; the test passed the code has been completely tested. Testing code is only\nas\n&gt; good the measured results. Pass/fails are one type of result, code\ncoverage\n&gt; metrics are another - the latter more qualitative than the former - and\nthey\n&gt; should be used together.\n\nJust to be clear what I meant by saying that code-coverage is more\nqualitative than pass/fail tests.\n\nWhile code coverage does give a quantitative measure of test coverage, and\npass/fail tests give a qualitative measure - code coverage will tell you\nmore about that particular quality of your testing effort than pass/fail\ntests. If you don&#39;t measure this quality then you won&#39;t truly know how well\nyou have tested your code - you will only have an educated guess at best.\n\nFWIW,\nLauren\n\n=====\nLooking for an experienced Java/C++ Software Engineer?\nSee: http://developerdude.mystarband.net/resume.html\n\n\n\n",
