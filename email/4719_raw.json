My experience extending the framework has\ntaught me that\n&gt; that beyond the basic classes you&#39;ve already read about, design\nwent out the\n&gt; window. Don&#39;t even look for model-view separation. You won&#39;t find\nit here.\n\nFunny that you mention it but I was actually trying to locate the\nmodel-view \ncontroller separation. I was wondering if the swing gui had fully\nsegregated \napplication model &lt;-&gt; domain model &lt;-&gt; view &lt;-&gt; controller layers.\n\n&gt; What did you have in mind?\n\nWell, I&#39;m working on a translation of jUnit into AppleScript. \n\nI&#39;ve managed to translate a good deal of the basic functionality as\nfar as the \ntextui Runner is concerned and was considering tackling the GUI\ntranslation \nshortly.\n\nHowever, I&#39;m having difficulty trying to get a sense of the intent\nbehind the \nvarious classes in the swing gui. i.e.- not so much the how or the\n&quot;what it does&quot; \nbut the why.\n\nThe class and method names give vague hints as to what the possible\nreasoning \nmight be behind the swing gui design but it&#39;s still rather cloudy for\nme. I was \nhoping that there was sort of pattern based description out there\nthat would \nhelp clear things up.\n\nThanks,\n\nAnthony\n\n\n",
