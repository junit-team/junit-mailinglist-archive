The important thing, however, \n&gt; is to instill the notion of OO purity, which is harder, \n&gt; perhaps, than just teaching the language.\n&gt; \n&gt; For example: the GoF patterns book is a must, but I think it \n&gt; is not a text that you can give to someone until they have a \n&gt; grounding in OO techniques.\n&gt; \n&gt; Your thoughts?\n&gt; \n&gt; Manuel Amago.\n&gt; \n&gt; -----------------------------------------------\n&gt; DISCLAIMER\n&gt; I know this group is not for this type of question, which is \n&gt; why I explicitly labelled this thread as OT (Off Topic).  I \n&gt; hope you will forgive my impertinence.  ;) But, I greatly \n&gt; value the opinions of the people on this list, and I trust \n&gt; your opinion on this particular issue.\n\n\n",
