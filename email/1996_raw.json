My\nfinal words on the subject: if management cares about how many assertions\nthere are, then before long, so will the developers. If you don&#39;t want them\nto care, then you should consider finding a way for management to get the\ninformation they want without counting assertions.\n\nAn interesting discussion. Thanks.\n\nJ.

The developers could care less.  Also, the\ndevelopers didn&#39;t care exactly how many tests were written.  What we wanted\nto know was that we had tested everything that could possibly break.
