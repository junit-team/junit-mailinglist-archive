So *IF* I thought  <br/>\n&gt; an interface would help, I would simply prefer:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Document doc = Document.newDocument();<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>But you can&#39;t do that with an interface. At a minimum you need<br/>\n<br/>\nDocument doc = Factory.newDocument();<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The simplicity of interfaces vs concrete classes comes from  <br/>\n&gt; dependencies.  Let&#39;s say we have some concrete class named  <br/>\n&gt; MyDocument, and it has lots and lots of methods.  Users of this class  <br/>\n&gt; depend on all these methods even if they don&#39;t call them.  If I make  <br/>\n&gt; a change to MyDocument it can affect all the callers to the extent  <br/>\n&gt; that they all have to be recompiled and redeployed.  (Yes, you can  <br/>\n&gt; play the game and try to figure out whether or not the class really  <br/>\n&gt; and truly needs to be recompiled, but that way lay madness.)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>In Java, if the public interface of the class doesn&#39;t change, you don;t <br/>\nneed to recompile clients. In fact, even if you only add things to the <br/>\npublic interface of the class, you don&#39;t need to recompile clients. In <br/>\nfact, you only need to recompile clients if the public interface changes <br/>\nin such a way that the clients need to be rewritten.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If I interpose one or more interfaces then suddenly the callers  <br/>\n&gt; depend ONLY on the methods in the interfaces that they use; and those  <br/>\n&gt; interfaces can be *very* sparse.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If I have a class that depends on only two methods in the library class, <br/>\nthen any changes beyond those two methods and the class signature itself <br/>\nare irrelevant to the client, and do not require recompilation. You do <br/>\nnot need to interpose an interface to get this benefit. Dynamic binding <br/>\ngives this to you automatically. Now in a language like C++ that links <br/>\nstatically, it may be a very different story. But in Java the clients <br/>\ndepend only on the methods in the class that they actually use. A public <br/>\nchange to a method the client actually uses requires rewriting and <br/>\nrecompilation, but so does a change to such a method in an interface. <br/>\nInterfaces add nothing to this.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  Even if there is only one  <br/>\n&gt; interface, and that interface has all the methods of MyDocument I can  <br/>\n&gt; still swap out MyDocument for some other implementation or some Mock  <br/>\n&gt; implementation.  I can also add new methods to MyDocument without  <br/>\n&gt; forcing recompilation and redeployment of the callers.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Again, if MyDocument is a class you can still add new methods to <br/>\nMyDocument without  forcing recompilation and redeployment of the <br/>\ncallers. This has nothing to do with interfaces and everything to do <br/>\nwith dynamic linking. (And again, I&#39;m talking about Java here. It can be <br/>\ndifferent in other languages.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n﻿Elliotte Rusty Harold  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:elharo@...\">elharo@...</a><br/>\nJava I/O 2nd Edition Just Published!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafeaulait.org/books/javaio2/\">http://www.cafeaulait.org/books/javaio2/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596527500/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/\">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596527500/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/</a></div>",
