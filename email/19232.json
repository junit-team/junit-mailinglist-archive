What doesvTestNG do to prevent me from<br/>\nmaking mistakes when using mutable state?<br/>\nb) I have occasionally made mistakes where immutable objects become<br/>\nmutable.  Stupid mistakes, to be sure, but that&#39;s why I write tests.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;  In JUnit 3.8, you can use TestSetup for this state, and in JUnit 4, you<br/>\n&gt; can<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  use @BeforeClass with statics<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Statics are extremely problematic with integration tools (ant, maven<br/>\n&gt; or IDE&#39;s) and they are also inherently a lot less thread-safe,<br/>\n&gt; therefore preventing you from leveraging parallelism.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve written tests that use static state and work fine from ant, but I don&#39;t<br/>\nknow everything.  Can you fill me in?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; or you can search Google for &quot;JUnit<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  OneInstance.class&quot;, which will give you a solution allowing you to only<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  instantiate your test class once.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Similary, I have always found JUnit tests hard to run reliably when<br/>\n&gt; they start depending on specialized runners.  Do the Eclipse and IDEA<br/>\n&gt; plug-ins support @RunWith?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Eclipse: Yes, natively.<br/>\nIDEA: I believe there was a bug a while back.  I&#39;ve put it on my todo list<br/>\nto try it out on the latest public beta (assuming there is one), but if<br/>\nsomeone has already tried it, I&#39;d love to know.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust to be clear, JUnit 4 can replicate both &quot;one instance for all tests&quot;<br/>\nand &quot;one instance for each test&quot; behavior in a way that works seamlessly<br/>\nwith, I know, ant and Eclipse, and will eventually be possible, when bugs<br/>\nare fixed, in other runners.  Of course, each tool must be opinionated in<br/>\nits defaults, but I assume that most tool users appreciate the final<br/>\ndecision being up to them.  I&#39;d ask about TestNG, but this is the JUnit<br/>\nlist.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I think the confusion of the original author is still<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; justified:  since both the constructor and setUp() are invoked before<br/>\n&gt; every test method, why have both?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;ll leave it up to the original author to say whether several good-faith<br/>\nattempts to answer that exact question have failed.<br/>\n<br/>\n   David Saff<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
