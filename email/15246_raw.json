My own experience and that of most of the people\nwho have responded is that @Before and @After read well. I suppose it\ndepends a little on how many annotations are present. I don&#39;t use any other\nannotations in my code, but I can see that @BeforeTestMethod might stand out\nbetter if there were many other annotations.\n\nI am reluctant to change the package name to &quot;samples&quot;, because the classes\nthere are not just examples of how you might use @RunWith, but useful bits\nof functionality. They just aren&#39;t universally useful. Also, this mirrors\nthe package naming in previous versions of JUnit.\n\n\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: notify@yahoogroups.com [mailto:notify@yahoogroups.com] \n&gt; On Behalf Of mherrmann_at\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, October 20, 2005 10:20 AM\n&gt; To: Kent Beck\n&gt; Subject: Re: JUnit 4 restructuring\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kent Beck&quot; &lt;kentb@e...&gt; \n&gt; wrote:&lt;br /&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Before -- annotation for methods to be run before\n&gt; each test method&lt;br /&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; * BeforeClass -- annotation for methods to be run\n&gt; before all tests in a&lt;br /&gt;\n&gt; &gt; class&lt;br /&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; * After -- annotation for methods to be run after\n&gt; each test method&lt;br /&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; * AfterClass -- annotation for methods to be run\n&gt; after all tests in a&lt;br /&gt;\n&gt; &gt; class&lt;br /&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Ignore -- annotation for test methods that are\n&gt; temporarily not to be run&lt;br /&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Test -- annotation for methods that are to be run\n&gt; as tests&lt;br /&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Assert -- assertion methods, expected to be used\n&gt; via static import&lt;br /&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br /&gt;\n&gt; I think Before and After don&#39;t tell the programmer enough about the\n&gt; context. As you wrote, Before is an &#39;annotation for methods to be run\n&gt; before each test method&#39;, so I would call it BeforeTestMethod. It&#39;s\n&gt; longer but much clearer. When I read my first JUnit 4 Test, &#39;Before&#39;\n&gt; made me think &#39;before what?&#39;. I was quite(although not entirely) sure\n&gt; that it had got to do with the tests but I had no idea if it meant run\n&gt; once for a class, once for every test method or just once for all\n&gt; tests. I had to look it up to be sure. &lt;br /&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br /&gt;\n&gt; For this reason I think that all annotations above should at least\n&gt; contain the word &#39;Test&#39;. &lt;br /&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br /&gt;\n&gt; Regarding runner.extensions, I agree with Stephen (if the package is\n&gt; actually meant for examples exclusively). &lt;br /&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br /&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br /&gt;\n&gt; Another thing that would imho be really great if put into the new\n&gt; release is the approach to assertions explained in the article: &lt;a\n&gt; href=&quot;http://joe.truemesh.com/blog/000511.html&quot;&gt;http://joe.tru\nemesh.com/blog/000511.html&lt;/a&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br /&gt;\n&gt; I posted my approach in the following thread:&lt;br /&gt;\n&gt; &lt;a\n&gt; href=&quot;http://saloon.javaranch.com/cgi-bin/ubb/ultimatebb.cgi?u\nbb=get_topic&amp;f=68&amp;t=000944&quot;&gt;http://saloon.javaranch.com/cgi-&gt;\nbin/ubb/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic&amp;f=68&amp;t=000944&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br\n&gt; /&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n",
