That&#39;s the difference between frameworks.<br/>\nAs I said before introducing @TypeSafe/FailSafe would hide ClassNotFoundExc. Although it would be an issue to use category class in compile time and omit the class in runtime.<br/>\n<br/>\nBR, Tibor<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, Dawid Weiss &lt;dawid.weiss@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Classes as categories was my idea.  If I had it to do over again, I&#39;d<br/>\n&gt; &gt; choose strings.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t think classes are a bad idea, actually.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I implemented the concept of &quot;groups&quot; of tests for Apache Lucene and<br/>\n&gt; it is annotation-based. That is: there is a meta-annotation @TestGroup<br/>\n&gt; that you can use to annotate your own annotations which are then<br/>\n&gt; recognized as groups and either enabled or disabled together. So, for<br/>\n&gt; example, slow tests are annotated with this thing:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; @Documented<br/>\n&gt; @Inherited<br/>\n&gt; @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)<br/>\n&gt; @TestGroup(enabled = true, sysProperty = SYSPROP_SLOW)<br/>\n&gt; public @interface Slow {}<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Lucene coders use multiple IDEs (and emacs, vi, etc...) and I think<br/>\n&gt; classes (or annotations in my case) work very well for this. One<br/>\n&gt; upside is that you don&#39;t need special support for test groups, you can<br/>\n&gt; just locate them using regular Java-element searches. Also, it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; harder to make a typo, you get support for completion, annotations<br/>\n&gt; define additional group properties (such as system properties used to<br/>\n&gt; turn them on/off), etc.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Obviously there are drawbacks like the ones you mentioned -- you need<br/>\n&gt; to reference those annotations during compilation, for example. But<br/>\n&gt; all in all, I&#39;d say it&#39;s not a bad idea to use classes/ annotations<br/>\n&gt; for defining groups.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Dawid<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
