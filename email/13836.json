What&#39;s that? &quot;Match the pattern&quot; is programmer speak.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Ah, but both of you are missing the real point. The user should not <br/>\n&gt; have been able to input an invalid social security number. The only <br/>\n&gt; case where this could happen is when the user is inputting data from <br/>\n&gt; a text file. In a properly designed GUI, the user should have been <br/>\n&gt; presented with 3 fields that only accept numeric digits. The first <br/>\n&gt; field accepts 3 digits, the 2nd 2 digits, and the last field 4 <br/>\n&gt; digits. And focus should have been move automatically between the <br/>\n&gt; fields.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is veering off topic, but I don&#39;t mind, because at least it&#39;s good <br/>\nconversation.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a user, I don&#39;t like this UI design. Specifically, when I make a <br/>\nkeying error, I usually have to use Shift+Tab to go back to input field <br/>\n#1 and correct the data there. Perhaps Novice users (think Dreyfus <br/>\nModel) benefit from such a constrained UI, but it works against me. The <br/>\none I&#39;m especially annoyed with is drop-down lists for month/year <br/>\n(credit card expiry date) or worse, month/day/year. I much prefer a text <br/>\nfield and a calendar widget. (Why isn&#39;t there are month/year widget?!)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo while this UI design can avoid certain input errors, I don&#39;t like to <br/>\nuse it. Which is worse: bad UI or bad error messages? I&#39;m not sure.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;snip /&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Since unit tests are for programmers, they should catch expected <br/>\n&gt; exceptions and let all others through to be displayed by the Unit <br/>\n&gt; Test runner.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This guideline has certainly served me well.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ.
