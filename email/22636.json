At least for code to be transmitted over the Internet (e.g. by Java Web Start or in Applets) this should be avoided too. <br/>\n<br/>\nJava does conditional compilation if the condition is final.<br/>\n<br/>\nWithout conditional compilation there is no other way than commenting out the hundreds of assertions manually - not really realistic. This keeps me from using standard test frameworks in my own projects. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn my own logger I have such a global boolean flag to disable test code generation. But this also can not stop those message String concatenations because these are done before passing the resulting String to the internally disabled assertTrue(message, ok) method.<br/>\n<br/>\nWould it be technically impossible to solve this through an annotation like e.g. @EnableTestCodeGeneration? Annotations are recognized at compile time.<br/>\n<br/>\ntomte</div>",
