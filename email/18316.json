I&#39;d like to<br/>\nspinkle test methods throughout my code, so the test can be right next<br/>\nto the code it is testing.  I&#39;d like to create a junit ant task that<br/>\njust runs on my whole codebase, but not all of my classes will have<br/>\ntest methods and I&#39;ll get an error for each class that doesn&#39;t (and I<br/>\ndon&#39;t want to have to explictily add each class to my build.xml file<br/>\nwhen I add a test).  So how do I tell junit that it isn&#39;t an error if<br/>\na class does not have a test method?</div>",
