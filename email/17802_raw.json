The exit\n&gt; condition of this while is managed by another thread. In a given\n&gt; moment the test runs only the thread with the while cycle, so I want\n&gt; to test only the code behind the first thread. This means that this\n&gt; cycle is an infinite one. At a moment (let&#39;s say, after 2 or 3 time\n&gt; processing of the instructions in the while cycle) the testing\n&gt; terminates, without any exception rasing, or error message, the\n&gt; application simply stops. I suppose is something about timeout... (??)\n&gt;\n&gt; Is anybody, who met this problem too? May I ask him to help me?\n&gt; Thank&#39;s a lot!\n\nI have very little experience with testing threaded code, but can I\nstart with the basics? Have you tested everything that isn&#39;t threaded?\nCan you move as much code as possible outside of the threading\nmechanism so that you can test it without recourse to threads.\nFinally, is there a way that you could mock the threading construct\nand test the code with these mock threads?\n\nThe principle here is that you should move as much code as possible\nout of the difficult to test areas. This is often easier said than\ndone, but it&#39;s always worth a try.\n\nJust a couple of thoughts.\n\nSimon\n\n-- \nwww.simonpeter.org\n\n",
