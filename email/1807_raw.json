Examples include open \n&gt;&gt;source applications or products where the source code is the primary \n&gt;&gt;deliverable (e.g. frameworks).\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; I think that we are talking about two different products: the final application (a jar in the Java world) and the development environment.\n&gt; The tests code is part of the source code but not part of the final application.\n&gt; You always can keep the tests in the cvs tree or a separate package for download.  If the customer has the knowledge to modify the code, he certainly know how to get code from a cvs tree :-)\n&gt; \n&gt; -Vladimir\n&gt;\n\n\nI&#39;m specifically referring to products where the source code is part and \nparcel of the product or the product provides a Java API.  It&#39;s not \nalways necessary to ship all of the test cases, but relevant test cases \nthat document and validate the use of the product should easily make up \nfor their storage and bandwidth penalties.\n\nMike\n\n \n\n-- \nMike Clark\nClarkware Consulting, Inc.\nCustom Software Architecture, Design,\nDevelopment, and Performance Consulting\nhttp://www.clarkware.com\n\n\n",
