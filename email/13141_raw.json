This should happen whether we run it \nfrom command line or from IDE like Eclipse. We are planning to \nschedule testing as a batch with lot of test cases, so we want \nredirect the output of the assert to a file. It&#39;s difficult to read \nfrom console.Can you please help us to find the solution to redirect \nthe output to a file.\n\nThanks & Regards,\nBala\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
