What was my goal? <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It was a type of end to end test.  The test&#39;s point of<br/>\n&gt; entry was the InvestorWebService object.  I asked the<br/>\n&gt; InvestorWebService for a PersonDTO (a person is one<br/>\n&gt; investor type), modified it, and sent it to the update<br/>\n&gt; method on the InvestorWebService.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; To check that this indeed worked as expected, in that<br/>\n&gt; all the tables in DB were updated as expected, I used<br/>\n&gt; DbUnit to assert that the tables matched XML datasets.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If you want to test this from end to end, and if Spring/Hibernate&#39;s <br/>\ntransaction setting is not allowing you to use automatic transaction <br/>\nhandling for this test as is, then I suppose you&#39;ll just have to begin <br/>\nand end transactions explicitly in the test. I don&#39;t know how to do <br/>\nthat, but I don&#39;t see any other way.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my opinion, if you want to test this from end to end, then you&#39;re not <br/>\ntesting enough of the application. I imagine that if you tested this <br/>\nbehavior through the application protocol -- using HTTPUnit, say -- then <br/>\nyou wouldn&#39;t have this transaction problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, if you /really/ want to test an individual class, but <br/>\ndon&#39;t see how to do so in isolation, then we have more investigating to <br/>\ndo to get to that point, with a copy of &quot;Working Effectively with Legacy <br/>\nCode&quot; at our side. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 2.  Responsibilities<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The InvestorWebService is responsible for returning an<br/>\n&gt; investor as a DTO.  It uses a DAO object (this is<br/>\n&gt; instantiated using Spring) to retrieve an investor<br/>\n&gt; business object.  The DAO uses Hibernate to retreive<br/>\n&gt; the requested investor object.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>InvestorWebService is a web service-based Repository for Investor <br/>\nobjects. Got it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Is that enough to start some discussion on your ideas?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You tell me. :)<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
