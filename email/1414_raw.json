A separate directory tree with a root note of test, the package\n&gt; structure of which reflects that of the codebase; keep the tests \n&gt; completely isolated from production code, the downside being that if I \n&gt; refactor code around packages, I have to remember to move tests as well; \n&gt; also, removes my ability to test private and protected methods..\n\nThat&#39;s what I do and it works extremely well. Sure, if you change the package\nof a class, you need to remember to change the package of the test class, but\nif you are very strict about test first development you should have no problem\nkeeping the tests and codebase packages in alignment. This technique does NOT\nremove the ability to test protected methods. Classes in the same package can\naccess package, protected, and public methods of each other.\n\nThere was a big discussion recently about how to test private methods. Read\nthe thread starting here:\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/junit/message/1267?threaded=1\n\n&gt; 2.    A &#39;test&#39; directory in each package of the codebase, containing\n&gt; TestXXXX classes\n\nYuck. This would work okay, but my personal preference is to keep test code\nseparate from production code. Same comment as above for protected and private\nmethods\n\n&gt; 3.    Actually make each class in the production code it&#39;s own test, ie put\n&gt; the JUnit testing code in the class itself.\n\nDouble yuck for the same reason as 2, I prefer not to mix test source code and\nproduction source code. It actually wouldn&#39;t be that hard to separate the test\nclass from the production class; you would code the test class as an inner\nclass. If you follow a good naming convention, it would be relatively easy to\nseparate the test class files from the codebase class files. (It doesn&#39;t\nmatter whether or not you can easily separate the source, it&#39;s the class files\nthat matter). The only advantage to this is that it allows you test private\nmethods. Again, refer to the archives for the discussion of testing private\nmethods.\n\n",
