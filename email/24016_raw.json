Our requirement is to run unit tests from wit=\r\nhin Eclipse and using Maven.\n\nThe experience was rather disappointing. \n\nTh=\r\ne support for categories in Eclipse is completely missing.  Maven plugin di=\r\nd not work out of the box as the wrong test executor was instantiated. Once=\r\n this was fixed, we found that the category class must be available in the =\r\nclass path of all projects, else the plugin fails with a ClassNotFoundExcep=\r\ntion. \n\nWhy are categories not plain strings as in TestNG? This would preve=\r\nnt class not found exceptions and in addition removes the requirement to ha=\r\nve a dependency on the single module containing the categories. If you like=\r\n you can still use String constants to be &quot;name safe&quot;.\n\nEvaluating TestNG a=\r\ns an alternative lead to the following results:\n- Good support in the Eclip=\r\nse Plugin and Maven\n-- Groups (=3D categories) are found by the Eclipse plu=\r\ngin\n- TestNG does not create a new instance per test. As a consequence all =\r\nfields must be set in @BeforeMethod. Using a normal constructor causes unex=\r\npected results.\n- @BeforeMethod is not executed, if a group is specified. T=\r\nhere is a @BeforeGroup annotation which makes the whole thing much more com=\r\nplex.\n\nBest Regards\n\nSebastian\n\n\n\n\n\n",
