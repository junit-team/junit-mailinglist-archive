What do\n&gt; you\n&gt; &gt; all think of this approach to the problem?\n&gt; \n&gt; My concern is twofold:\n&gt; a) You bring testing logic into your production code. It&#39;s reasonable\n&gt; to change your design to make it more testable but weaving testing\n&gt; *logic* into production code feels strange to me.\n\nA good point.  What do you think about the comment at the end, whereby\nthe factory would have only three static methods:\n\npublic Factory getInstance();\nprotected void setOverrideFactory(Factory testFactory);\nprotected void clearOverrideFactory();\n\nThis should limit the test specific code to the getInstance method,\nwhich would then look something like:\n\npublic Factory getInstance() {\n    if (overrideFactory!=null) {\n        return overrideFactory\n    } else {\n        //do the usual thing\n    }\n}\n\nThis would also allow classes to make their own MockFactories for\nwhatever they need.\n\n&gt; b) Having more than just one or two of those static factories raises\n&gt; chances to forget about initializing all override values in setUp and\n&gt; clearing them again in tearDown.\n\nI agree, a &quot;code smell&quot; is too many factories.  Two or three is a good\nthreshold number, I think.\n\nKevin\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
