B. Rainsberger wrote:\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;2. Using data in a file means worrying about where the files are on the\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;file system when executing the tests.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Use a relative offset from your project.home\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;project.home&quot;? You&#39;re assuming Ant, I guess. Ant is widely-accepted, but not universal... yet.\n\nAt *least* as accepted as JUnit. Point being you&#39;ll usually be \nrunning tests in the context of a project structure - \nant/make/whatever, there&#39;s a relative path structure to be exploited \nin that case.\n\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;3. What if I need to execute the tests on a file system that doesn&#39;t\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;understand &quot;g:/myCsvFiles&quot;? (Yes, there are solutions, but none as easy as\n&gt;&gt;not having to worry about it.)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;What if I need to compile the java on a file system that doesn&#39;t \n&gt;&gt;understand &quot;g:/myCsvFiles&quot;?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t understand your implied point here.\n\nA project can be setup in such a ways as to not have to worry about \nfile systems, just relative paths. So this is somewhat incidental to \nwhether to keep files in or out of java. If my test run breaks on \ng:/myCsvFiles for a test input file, is it any less likely to break \non g:/project where the test java itself is located?\n\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;4. Tests that require the file system are slower.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Not much. And not at all if you&#39;re testing through changing/adding \n&gt;&gt;files and not by changing the code.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I agree &quot;not much&quot;, except when there are 1000 tests.\n\nSure, but not at all of which need files surely. At 1000 tests, file \ninput is becoming amortized, by the number of source code files.\n\n\n&gt; I don&#39;t understand the logic of the second sentence.\n\nTesting code by making changes to a file and re-running the tests.\n\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;5. Cleaning up the file system is asynchronous (from what I can tell)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;and unreliable to do in tests that execute at a rate of dozens per second.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;If you have to clean up the file system, clean up at the end the \n&gt;&gt;run; use Ant to rmdir.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; When was the last time you tried this? When I did, tearDown() finished before the files were removed, then the next test&#39;s setUp() complained that files already existed. That&#39;s why I don&#39;t like to do it. If the Java File calls were synchronized with the underlying file system, then this wouldn&#39;t be a problem.\n\nPerhaps we&#39;re talking about different things. I don&#39;t normally use \nteardown/setup for file based tests and I&#39;m not suggesting using the \nfile system as a shared memeory is a good idea, just that it&#39;s a \ngood place to keep files for *input* to a test. The test files are \n(should be) in version control, they only have to be read/loaded, \nand the majority of what&#39;ll be tested doesn&#39;t need to be written to \nanother file; it can be held in memory and inspected from there \nbefore being gc&#39;d.\n\nFor the odd time we are writing to disk, this works for the most part\n\n  $ ant test tidy\n\nBill de h�ra\n\n-- \nSorry, I don&#39;t know the word &quot;sorry&quot;.- SHRDLU\n\n\n\n",
