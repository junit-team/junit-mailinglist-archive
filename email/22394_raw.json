By testing\nthose assumptions within the body of the theory, a set of sample\ndata can be used for many different purposes. For example,\nif I were testing division, I might have one theory about\nwhat happens with a zero divisor and another for non-zero divisors.\n\nCharlie\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On \n&gt; Behalf Of Berin\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, February 11, 2010 6:22 AM\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: [junit] Re: Something is bothering me about assumptions\n&gt; \n&gt; It does make me curious to know what the reasoning was for \n&gt; automatically passing a theory if an assumption fails.  \n&gt; Perhaps if I knew the other side of the story, it would make \n&gt; more sense to me.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Charlie Poole&quot; &lt;charlie@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; It seems to me that the behavior you are asking for is \n&gt; appropriate if \n&gt; &gt; an assumption fails in a normal test as opposed to a theory.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Charlie\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: junit@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Of Berin\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sent: Tuesday, February 09, 2010 2:29 PM\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: [junit] Something is bothering me about assumptions\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;ve seen in a few places that if an assumption fails, the test \n&gt; &gt; &gt; automatically passes.  I then ran into the test case that \n&gt; confirms \n&gt; &gt; &gt; that action.  Coming from the aspect that I want to have \n&gt; confidence \n&gt; &gt; &gt; that my code and tests are functioning properly, I honestly think \n&gt; &gt; &gt; that is the wrong action.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; If an assumption is violated then it should be either a \n&gt; failure or \n&gt; &gt; &gt; at best ignored.  To say the test passes because \n&gt; something failed is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; like saying you don&#39;t have a cavity because the dentist \n&gt; doesn&#39;t have \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the right tool.  You don&#39;t know one way or the other, and \n&gt; the test \n&gt; &gt; &gt; won&#39;t be able to run properly when the assumption is violated.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; It&#39;s partly that reason that I don&#39;t use assumptions to \n&gt; begin with.  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; If there needs to be a certain precondition to the test \n&gt; passing, I \n&gt; &gt; &gt; will add those assertions before I perform the action \n&gt; that needs to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; be tested.  To me, it is a failure if the test could not \n&gt; be set up \n&gt; &gt; &gt; properly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; If you want something a little softer, then I recommend that a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; failed assumption is equivalent to the @Ignore annotation.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; You&#39;ll see in the summary that X number of tests were \n&gt; run, Y number \n&gt; &gt; &gt; of tests ignored, and Z number of tests failed.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Although, for ignored tests I&#39;d like to see what the reason was \n&gt; &gt; &gt; (failed assumption or manually ignored through the attribute).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Making a test pass because of a failed assumption gives \n&gt; you a false \n&gt; &gt; &gt; sense of security about your code.  What is happening is that the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; test just wasn&#39;t run, and there may be a legitimate \n&gt; problem hiding.  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; To me that is the most dangerous part of that solution.  \n&gt; I&#39;d rather \n&gt; &gt; &gt; get the bad news straight than trust faulty information.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Am I making sense?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yahoo!
