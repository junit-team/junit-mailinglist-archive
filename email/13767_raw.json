These are shown to the end \n&gt; user and are part of the user interface, just like menu items, window \n&gt; titles, and other parts of the user interface. However, exception detail \n&gt; messages make extremely poor error messages. It&#39;s important to \n&gt; distinguish between these in a well-designed application, even if you&#39;re \n&gt; only ever going to ship the app in a single language.\n\nGood exceptions should have some key features:\n\n1) They should be identifiable - you should know that a given exception has \nbeen caused by a particular problem.\n\n2) They should be informative - that is, they should have the information \nabout what caused the problem.\n\nThese, curiously enough, can be used very easily to create good error \nmessages. The simple way is to have a key on the exception for a resource \nbundle, which lets you look up a message pattern, which you then use to \ncreate an error message with the data in the exception. (There are, of \ncourse, other ways to do this, and not all exceptions should result in \nerror messages being presented to huamns, anyway)\n\nIf you use this approach, it is important to ensure in your tests that you \nconstruct Exceptions with sufficent information.\n\nRobert.\n\n-- \n                &quot;Software is too expensive to build cheaply&quot;\nRobert Watkins         http://twasink.net/          robertdw@...\n\n",
