As runners can&#39;t be composed, it \nshould be handled at the root like @Ignored\n\n&gt; assertEquals&  IDE integration: an additional static assert method\n&gt; (when we change the built-in assertEquals, it breaks tests that have\n&gt; been running fine for years.  This tends to cause Bad Days for already\n&gt; over-worked people.  A separate static method is an easy way for\n&gt; people to opt-in to the new behavior)\n\nthis doesn&#39;t make sense for me at all.\n\nFirst who will call Assert.assertEquals in some cases and \nSomeUtils.assertEquals in other cases?\n\nSecond, I&#39;m quite sure that changing\n   failNotEquals(message, expected, actual);\nto\n   throw new ComparisonFailure(cleanMessage, String.valueOf(expected), \nString.valueOf(actual));\n\nwouldn&#39;t have the drawbacks you describe. Even better it would align the \ncode to what is currently done for Strings.\n\n&gt; Most interesting is ParallelRunner.  From your description, this\n&gt; appears to be a Runner that exposes the work already latent in the\n&gt; ParallelComputer class and others.  It would be interesting if you had\n&gt; to make any changes to the existing classes in order to produce this\n&gt; new Runner without duplication.\n\njust make the anonymous RunnerScheduler in ParallelComputer.parallelize \nreusable and it&#39;s done.\n\nThis was my last email on this subject. This is clear to me that you are \nnot interested in what I propose. I&#39;m not really surprised as it \nconfirms the experience made by others in the past. This is sad because \nI still think that a lot of JUnit users would love improvements but at \nthe end, it is your decision.\n\nCheers,\nMarc.\n-- \nHtmlUnit support & consulting from the source\nBlog: http://mguillem.wordpress.com\n\n\n",
