The unit testing process forces you to think about the<br/>\ninterface of the class under test.  So, not only are you testing the<br/>\nencapsulated logic of the class, but the client interface is also<br/>\nsubjected to a &quot;design&quot; test.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike<br/>\n<br/>\n--- <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ghouston@...\">ghouston@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; One thing to watch out for:  Existing classes that are hard to test!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve built tests on existing code and frequently I see classes that <br/>\n&gt; are very hard to test.  This happens because the classes were <br/>\n&gt; originally developed without Unit Testing in mind.  For a class to be<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; easy to test, it needs to follow good Object Oriented Design <br/>\n&gt; practices where the class is well encapsulated and has little <br/>\n&gt; coupling with other classes.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Note:  I&#39;ve also seen Unit Testing improve the design.  Making the <br/>\n&gt; classes testable makes for better encapsulation and lower coupling]<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Putting Unit Tests on existing code can get very ugly.  Some classes <br/>\n&gt; may not be worth Unit Testing until they are first refactored into <br/>\n&gt; something more easily tested.  This refactoring is beneficial but <br/>\n&gt; costly.  You will have to make the cost-benefit determination to see <br/>\n&gt; if you should Unit Test the difficult code, refactor it, defer it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
