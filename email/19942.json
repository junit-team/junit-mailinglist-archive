E.G. I have a few Fortune Cookies that are stored in an array of <br/>\n&gt; Strings. I&#39;ve written some code that returns them randomly. <br/>\n&gt; What is the best method for testing? i.e. should I be using Mocks?<br/>\n&gt; If anybody has any good examples or relevant web sites please let me <br/>\n&gt; know.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Your help is greatly appreciated.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sam.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Testing random (or more generally, non-deterministic) behavior is an<br/>\ninteresting question, and one I like to ask during interviews.  We<br/>\ncould talk for hours about it, but I have a feeling you are looking<br/>\nfor a practical answer.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you can seed the random number generator (you probably should), you<br/>\ncan easily test the following:<br/>\n<br/>\n- Two sequences with the same seed produce the same fortune cookies in<br/>\nthe same order.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Two sequences with different seeds produce different sequences of<br/>\nfortune cookies.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou should also test for invariant properties (i.e. things that should<br/>\nalways happen or never happen). For example, request a fortune cookie<br/>\na large number of times and make sure that it always returns a &quot;valid&quot;<br/>\nstring.  You can define a valid string as a non-null, non-empty string<br/>\nor, even better, every string you return should be in the set of<br/>\nfortune cookies strings you are using.  The latter implies that the<br/>\nset of fortune cookies strings should not include null or empty<br/>\nstrings - which sounds like a good property of a fortune cookie<br/>\ngenerator (unless you have a nihilistic view of life) and something<br/>\nelse that you should test.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are many other very interesting techniques for testing<br/>\nrandomness, but I think they might be overkill for a fortune cookie<br/>\ngenerator. But if you are interested in learning more about this type<br/>\nof testing, I wrote a chapter on testing for the O&#39;Reilly book<br/>\n&quot;Beautiful Code&quot; which covers some of these ideas.
