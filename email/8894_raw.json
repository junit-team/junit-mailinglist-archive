It\nwould\n\t&gt; simply make the error tracing a bit easier and avoid running tests that I\n\t&gt; know are going to fail.\n\n&gt;\tHave you run into this problem very regularly so far? And if you have, how\n&gt;\tbig was the effort to sort out the real problem? My guess is that going\nall\n&gt;\tthe way to define dependencies for every subclass relation is not\nworthwhile;\n&gt;\tat least not for me.\n\nThis is an interesting question. What I was proposing was an optional\nability on a given testcase, and I&#39;d make the determination on a case by\ncase basis. I agree, I don&#39;t want to do this for everything all the time\n(another reason I don&#39;t like the idea of using suites for it) -- most of the\ntime random order is fine -- but occasionally I&#39;d like to do so.\n\nI guess over the years w/ thousands of tests & thousands and test runs, I&#39;ve\ndone it enough to want to consider this. If it were there I know I&#39;d use it\nsignificantly.\n\nregards\n\nAdam\n\n\n",
