Since every test in JUnit is a method, it&#39;s often times easy to <br/>\nconvince yourself at first that every method is a test.  This is not <br/>\nthe case.  Your tests perform 5 atomic operations separate from your <br/>\ntests.  They are create, update, delete, exists, result.  These are <br/>\nregular methods; they are not tests.  The tests you want are <br/>\ncompositions of those operations.<br/>\n<br/>\n// Your tests<br/>\n<br/>\npublic void testCreate() {<br/>\n\tassertFalse(exists());<br/>\n\tcreate();<br/>\n\tassertTrue(exists());<br/>\n\tdelete();<br/>\n}<br/>\n<br/>\npublic void testUpdate() {<br/>\n\tint expected = 1;<br/>\n\tcreate();<br/>\n\tassertFalse(expected == result());<br/>\n\tupdate();<br/>\n\tassertTrue(expected == result());<br/>\n\tdelete();<br/>\n}<br/>\n<br/>\npublic void testDelete() {<br/>\n\tcreate();<br/>\n\tassertTrue(exists());<br/>\n\tdelete();<br/>\n\tassertFalse(exists());<br/>\n}<br/>\n<br/>\nNot every method is a test.<br/>\n<br/>\n-shane<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Wednesday, April 16, 2003, at 01:26  PM, javainsel wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; We want to test the creation, update and deletion of an object which<br/>\n&gt; is persisted in database.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What we now do is to have three test methods for this.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In the testCreate method the object is created, checked that he is<br/>\n&gt; really created and then it is deleted (we have delete because<br/>\n&gt; unfortunately we don&#39;t use Mock Objects).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In the testUpdate method we create the object, update it, test the<br/>\n&gt; update result and delete the created object.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In the testDelete method we create the object so that we can test<br/>\n&gt; the deletion of it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; As you see, everything is included in the testUpdate method. We<br/>\n&gt; duplicate much code in the other two test methods.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We write such tests for every domain object so I wonder if we should<br/>\n&gt; improve our test class.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Would you write 3 or just 1 test method for that example?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And would you try to convince senior coworkers who know little about<br/>\n&gt; JUnit and dislike TDD? </span></blockquote></div>",
