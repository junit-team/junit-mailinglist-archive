There are several ways to contribute to Java testing.  Some\nof these might become part of the JUnit distribution, and others will\nbecome popular extensions.  Is there anything that you&#39;d like to do\nwith JUnit that you can&#39;t now?  That&#39;s a great place to start.\nOtherwise, you could look through the bug database for something that\nlooks like it would take a day or two at most.  Is this something\nthat&#39;s explicitly for a school class, or your own interest?\n\nI&#39;ve CC&#39;ed the junit-devel list with this response, and further\ndiscussion may make sense there.  Thanks,\n\n   David Saff\n\nOn 10/28/07, Akshay Savadatti &lt;asavadatti@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hi All,\n&gt;\n&gt;       I am a student and I am interested in devoting some of my time\n&gt; to develop some additional functionality/fix bugs for junit. I am\n&gt; fairly proficient in Java, but I&#39;ve never worked on a actual open\n&gt; source software project such as junit.\n&gt;\n&gt;          I&#39;d like to know if there is anything substantial that I can\n&gt; contribute in a period of around 2-3 months. (I&#39;d also like to know if\n&gt; this is the right place to ask this question.)\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Akshay\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo! Groups Links\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n",
