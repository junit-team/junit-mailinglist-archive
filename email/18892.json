    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1004967814\">Hey Michael,<br/>\n<br/>\nYes I imagine some of use like having everything in<br/>\none class.<br/>\n<br/>\nI personally like having really small classes, and I<br/>\nalso like to have everything tested.  I anticipate<br/>\nthere will be a lot of automatic test generation tools<br/>\nout there soon, and that these will fit well with code<br/>\nstructured that way.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also find it valuable when someone says &quot;Well we<br/>\nhave to leave all that code untested because there&#39;s<br/>\nsooooo many private  methods&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI either have to say &quot;OK - Go to JUnit&#39;s site and find<br/>\nthe how to test private methods reflector thingy&quot; or<br/>\nuse the Class, ClassHelper pattern.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy personal feeling is leaving method &quot;Simplicity&quot;<br/>\njudgement up to the developer can lead to &quot;Shortcuts&quot;<br/>\n:-)<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it&#39;s easier if an entire team of developers<br/>\nagrees to a certain pattern.  That way we know how to<br/>\nlook at other people&#39;s code.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said I&#39;m also for having untested methods, as<br/>\nlong as it is generated code.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince the code is generated, to me it means that the<br/>\npattern that generated the code has already been<br/>\ntested, so that everything really is tested,  it&#39;s<br/>\njust that the test is tagged to the pattern and the<br/>\ncode generation template.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\n- Ole<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Michael Feathers &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mfeathers@...\">mfeathers@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Ole,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t know that there any security risks to that<br/>\n&gt; approach.  <br/>\n&gt; Ultimately, security is more about who has access to<br/>\n&gt; your code rather <br/>\n&gt; than anything that you do to protect it; any runtime<br/>\n&gt; can be fiddled with. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I would hesitate before using something like Class +<br/>\n&gt; ClassHelper as an <br/>\n&gt; architectural style.  It would be a shame to have to<br/>\n&gt; look at two things <br/>\n&gt; whenever you used to have to look at one. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; To me, the better thing is to notice when things are<br/>\n&gt; hard to test and <br/>\n&gt; then decide whether to break your classes down into<br/>\n&gt; pieces where <br/>\n&gt; operations can be public and whether, once public,<br/>\n&gt; they enable more in <br/>\n&gt; your code.  If you want to see an example of this,<br/>\n&gt; look at FIT <br/>\n&gt; (fit.c2.com).  I don&#39;t recall if it&#39;s that way now,<br/>\n&gt; but in the early <br/>\n&gt; versions all methods were either public or<br/>\n&gt; package-scope.  You have to <br/>\n&gt; make some serious tradeoffs when you adopt that<br/>\n&gt; style for API code, but <br/>\n&gt; in general it&#39;s a reasonable style for application<br/>\n&gt; (non-API) code.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Michael Feathers<br/>\n&gt; www.objectmentor.com<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Ole Ersoy wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;Hi Guys,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Would it be a good idea to always use all public<br/>\n&gt; &gt;methods...?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;In the context of a convention where there is a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&quot;MainClass&quot; and a &quot;MainClassHelper&quot; that has public<br/>\n&gt; &gt;methods used to help the MainClass.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Users of MainClassHelper (The collaborator should<br/>\n&gt; &gt;really be MainClass only) know that this class<br/>\n&gt; exists<br/>\n&gt; &gt;mainly for the purpose of helping MainClass, and<br/>\n&gt; all<br/>\n&gt; &gt;the methods are public, so that they can be easily<br/>\n&gt; &gt;unit tested.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Otherwise they would be private or protected<br/>\n&gt; members<br/>\n&gt; &gt;of MainClass.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;So MainClassHelper can really be thought of as a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;utility library that is specific to MainClass...<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Anyone know if there are security risks to this,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;beside API risks?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Thanks,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;- Ole<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;____________________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Don&#39;t get soaked.
