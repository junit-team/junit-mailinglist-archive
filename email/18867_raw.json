It meets the spirit of Te=\r\nstivus (http://www.artima.com/\nweblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=3D194506).\n\nSure=\r\n, ideally the design and implementation is such that you don&#39;t have to brea=\r\nk \nencapsulation, but often circumstances are less than ideal.\n\nThe assert =\r\non privates vs. don&#39;t assert on privates issue is something that we have be=\r\nen \ndebating amongst ourselves at Agitar for years.  The current version of=\r\n JUnit Factory \ncreates asserts for private fields.  I still cringe a littl=\r\ne bit when I see them.  But if we \nremove them, users complain.\n\nA possible=\r\n solution, suggested by someone else at work, is to partition the generated=\r\n tests \ninto black-box tests and white-box tests src directories.\n\nThe blac=\r\nk-box tests can only assert (and use) public stuff - they can&#39;t violate \nen=\r\ncapsulation.  \n\nThe white-box tests can peek and poke wherever they want.\n\n=\r\nI haven&#39;t given this idea enought thought to reach a conclusion, but I foun=\r\nd it intriguing \nenough to share it and solicit feedback.\n\nAlberto\n\nhttp://=\r\nwww.junitfactory.com\nA research experiment in free\nweb-based JUnit generati=\r\non\n\n\n",
