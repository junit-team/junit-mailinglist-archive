I got one reply.\n&gt;\n&gt; In the meantime, what else got a response?  Well, we seem to have time \n&gt; to respond to trivial subjects and partake\n&gt; in what is nothing short of mental masturbation and ignore substantive \n&gt; questions that require some effort.\n&gt; I think I have read about 30 messages about getters and setters that \n&gt; sounds more like a pissing contest.  And then there is the chatter \n&gt; about one piece of spam.  How many worthless messages did this &quot;spam&quot; \n&gt; generate?  Boy we nailed that one didn&#39;t we?\n&gt;\n&gt; If you need someone to chat with, get a dog.  I got one, he just \n&gt; doesn&#39;t know java/junit...yet.\n&gt;\n&gt; Sorry for the vent but I grow tired of groping in the dark.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks for your help.\n&gt;\n&gt; Lee Chalupa\n\n=======================================\nJ.
