My point is just that I suspect you are<br/>\n&gt; only thinking of JUnit-based unit tests. And I would<br/>\n&gt; agree that 14 hours of unit tests seems pretty weird.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s not quite what I&#39;m thinking, but it&#39;s closer. Certainly, I&#39;d be <br/>\nshocked to see 14 hours of fast tests, but even 14 hours of slow tests <br/>\non a single project is out of the ordinary. I can&#39;t envision a single <br/>\nproject that big. I&#39;d want to ask the people on that project two questions:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Why such reliance on slow tests?<br/>\n2. Should we break this up into about four subprojects?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; But we&#39;re running JUnit-based system and acceptance<br/>\n&gt; tests. In my experience 14 hours of automated system<br/>\n&gt; testing isn&#39;t that unusual for a reasonably large and<br/>\n&gt; complex software system.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I agree it isn&#39;t unusual (in the sense that it happens), but I would <br/>\nwant to look for improvement.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Are they all valuable? Yes, I think so. They all have<br/>\n&gt; caught or could catch bugs. In fact, if we had time,<br/>\n&gt; we would write more tests that would take even longer<br/>\n&gt; to run, since I don&#39;t think we have the test coverage<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;d like.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Is it really a good idea to have a test suite so long that you can&#39;t run <br/>\nit overnight between when people leave for work and when they come back <br/>\nin the morning? How do you do a daily build?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; As far as the speed of feedback for 14 hour tests, again<br/>\n&gt; these are system (&quot;QA&quot;) type tests. Comparing a 2 day<br/>\n&gt; feedback cycle to a 6 week feedback cycle (which is what<br/>\n&gt; we&#39;ve had on past projects) the 2 days is obviously a<br/>\n&gt; monumental step forward.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No question there. If you&#39;ve managed to reduce the feedback cycle from 6 <br/>\nweeks to 2 days, then that&#39;s great work. Still, I find a 2-day cycle <br/>\nquite long. I imagine you have bigger problems to face right now, so <br/>\nyou&#39;re right to face them and not this one, but all things being equal, <br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t be satisfied with a 2-day cycle, and I certainly wouldn&#39;t <br/>\ndesign JUnit to optimize for the case of the 2-day test cycle.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut that&#39;s great work. I&#39;m impressed. Have you written about what you do <br/>\ndifferently between the 6-week cycle and the 2-day cycle? I&#39;m sure <br/>\npeople would like to read about that.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
