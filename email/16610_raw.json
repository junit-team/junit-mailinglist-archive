The main motivation is\n    testing with databases - the vario=\r\nus login parameters are\n    always changing with new versions of databases =\r\nwe must test\n    against (not just Oracle!).\n\n ii) a new runtime Assert cal=\r\nled &#39;ignore(&quot;some msg&quot;)&#39; to parallel\n    the design-time @Ignore annotation=\r\n. The motivation is (again!)\n    testing with databases - we have a numerou=\r\ns tests that run\n    against many versions of databases, but each version h=\r\nas their\n    own idiosyncratic capabilities - e.g. each vendor handles\n    =\r\nstored-procedures a little different. A test suite may have\n    hundreds of=\r\n tests that pass all db-platforms, but some that only\n    pass for known co=\r\nnfigurations. At runtime the test can\n    interrogate the db-fixture and de=\r\ncide to not fail the testcase\n    but to ignore it.\n\nAny reason the above b=\r\nehaviour could not be implemented in a\ncustom Runner?\n\nThanks in advance,\nM=\r\nWN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
