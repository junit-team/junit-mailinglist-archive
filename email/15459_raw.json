If all &quot;complicated&quot; \nwould be like that we can get 200% test coverage...\n\n   You came to the right conclusion that SQLException is an \nunrecoverable one and should be wrapped into a runtime exception. You \neven have slight improvement there with a common exception handler. \nThere is only one step left before template pattern, so you can have \nexactly one place where that exception handler would be used. Take a \nlook at JDBC packages in a Spring framework and either copy its design \nor use as is.\n\n   Pretty much the same pattern can be applied to other common API&#39;s and \nmany already in a very same Spring framework, so you won&#39;t have to \ninvent the wheel.\n\n   As I said, there are really good ways to make code more testable.\n\n   regards,\n   Eugene\n\n\nJ.

Can you please share your thoughts?\n&gt; \n&gt; Sure: 100% line/branch coverage is impossible to achieve. Even if it \n&gt; were possible, it&#39;s not worth the effort. Example:\n&gt; \n&gt; JDBC driver throws SQLException, which is checked. In my code, I have to \n&gt; do this:\n&gt; \n&gt; try {\n&gt;      useJdbcDriver();\n&gt; }\n&gt; catch (SQLException e) {\n&gt;      // What to do here?\n&gt; }\n&gt; \n&gt; Well, my default checked exception handler is this:\n&gt; \n&gt; try {\n&gt;      useJdbcDriver();\n&gt; }\n&gt; catch (SQLException wrapped) {\n&gt;      throw new RuntimeException(\n&gt;          &quot;Something went wrong when I used the database&quot;, wrapped);\n&gt; }\n&gt; \n&gt; There are two problems with this:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. It takes an obscene amount of effort to simulate (or recreate) the \n&gt; conditions under which the JDBC driver throws an SQLException.\n&gt; \n&gt; The vast, vast majority of the time, I don&#39;t handle those exceptions \n&gt; anyway, but rather pass them up the chain. To avoid coupling myself to \n&gt; my caller, I turn the checked exception into an unchecked one.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2. Java /forces/ me to duplicate that exception handler everywhere \n&gt; throughout my code, although I /could/ get a little better with\n&gt; \n&gt;      ExceptionHandler.shush(\n&gt;          &quot;Something went wrong when I used the database&quot;, shushed);\n&gt; \n&gt; Still, I have to duplicate /that/ everywhere, but I certainly don&#39;t need \n&gt; to test it everywhere I use it. The only thing that changes is the \n&gt; explanation message, and I never write code that depends on that text in \n&gt; any meaningful way.\n&gt; \n&gt; Both of these make it unusually expensive to test-drive this code, \n&gt; compared to the benefit I get from test-driving it. As a result, I have \n&gt; judged that it&#39;s not worth the effort, so I don&#39;t do it.\n&gt; \n&gt; I hope that helps.\n\n\n",
