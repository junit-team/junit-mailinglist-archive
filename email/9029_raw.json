Do \n&gt; &gt;you think this is no longer a unit test when I start making sure \nthat \n&gt; &gt;the messenger is respondeing correctly when something is added?  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Should the unit test only make sure that the addMessage() method \nis \n&gt; &gt;working (I.e. it received the message), and the integration test \n&gt; &gt;should then make sure that when a certain message is added it \n&gt; &gt;recieves the correct response message via the listener?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Thanks\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;--- In junit@y..., &quot;Michael Rettig&quot; &lt;mrettig@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; &gt;&gt; From: Mike Clark &lt;mike@c...&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;I have already implemented this with JUnit by making the \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;TestMessenger TestCase a MessengerLister.  After I add a \nmessage \n&gt; &gt;I \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;sleep until a response is supplied. I then wake up (or time \nout \n&gt; &gt;for \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;failure) and test if this is the correct response to assert \nif \n&gt; &gt;the \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;test failed or passed. \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Sounds like a reasonable integration test.  That&#39;s generally \nthe \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; approach I take when faced with testing asynchronous messaging \n&gt; &gt;end-to-end.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Mike\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Also, you can look at mocking your messenger layer. Whenever, \nI&#39;ve \n&gt; &gt;done asynch testing, I found a way to make the testing \nsynchronouse \n&gt; &gt;using a mock layer. This was ideal for simulating odd messaging \n&gt; &gt;behavior that could not be easily replicated asynchronously.  \n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Mike Rettig\n&gt; &gt;&gt; -- \n&gt; &gt;&gt; __________________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Sign-up for your own FREE Personalized E-mail at Mail.com\n&gt; &gt;&gt; http://www.mail.com/?sr=signup\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Single & ready to mingle? lavalife.com:  Where singles click. \nFree \n&gt; &gt;to Search!\n&gt; &gt;&gt; http://www.lavalife.com/wp.epl?a=2716\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; &gt;junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Your use of Yahoo!
