I assume you want dupLoginId to be a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;snapshot&quot; of newLoginId. Right now, they refer to the same physical<br/>\n&gt; &gt; string, so a change through one reference will be seen through the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; second reference. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Strings are immutable, so I don&#39;t see that this can happen.

You<br/>\nthen set your variable newLoginId to equal that, which is to say that<br/>\nthere is some slot in memory (let&#39;s call it B) that now points to A. <br/>\nThen you set your dupLoginId variable that lives at slot C in memory and<br/>\ntell it to point to slot B, which is pointing to slot A which is &quot;ABC&quot;. <br/>\nYes, strings are immutable, but that means nothing in this case.  You<br/>\nhave 2 references to the same object in memory.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJason Rogers<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Where there is no vision, the people perish...&quot;<br/>\nBible, Proverbs 29:18</div>",
