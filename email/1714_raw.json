[mailto:rainsber@...]\nSent: 28. juni 2001 17:52\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: Re: [junit] Testing Private Methods\n\n\nYes. Don&#39;t test protected and package-protected methods.\n\nA quote from the XP discussion group.\n(http://208.48.218.9/group/extremeprogramming/message/13213)\n\n&quot;I actually do think that it is cut and dried. Public members have a\nbehavior that is expected of them by their clients. Tests can be used to\ndefine that behavior and demonstrate that a particular method exhibits it.\nPrivate methods are, by definition, implementation details. Their behavior\ncan vary freely so long as the public methods don&#39;t break. Put another way:\nif every public method has been proven to behave correctly then the class\nhas been proven to be bug free. Therefore, there is never a need to test\nthe private members of a class.&quot;\n\nSo can you avoid testing them? If so, then don&#39;t; if not, then you can&#39;t\nhave it both ways: either the tests are in the class (to test private\nmethods),\nin the package (to test protected/package methods) or you can&#39;t test those\nmethods. There&#39;s no magic here...\n\nGood luck,\n\nJ. B.

It seems like its\nnot going to be possible to do it while separating the TestCase classes and\nthe business object classes.\n\nOne of the reasons I see a difficulty is that we are using VisualAge for\nJava and it would make it a deployment nightmare to include the code in the\nsame packages or, worse yet, the same classes.  I know that there are\noptions I could use outside of VA such as ANT to only build certain\nclasses,\nbut I doubt I could get the client to buy into that and I still don&#39;t think\nthat solves the private method issue.\n\nAm I just missing something easy or what?\n\nThanks,\nMike\n\n\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\njunit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n\n\nYour use of Yahoo!
