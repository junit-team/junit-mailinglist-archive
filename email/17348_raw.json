In Eclipse 3.2, you should be able to run a JUnit \n4 test class by simply right clicking and choosing &quot;Run As &gt; JUnit test&quot;.\n\nThe documentation so far does leave out some feature gems, including this:\n\n@RunWith(Suite.class)\n@SuiteClasses({ATest.class, BTest.class, CTest.class})\npublic class MyTests() {\n    @BeforeClass public void setupDatabaseBeforeEverything() { ... }\n    @AfterClass public void teardownDatabaseAfterEverything() { ... }\n}\n\nLet me know if that does what you need.  Good luck,\n\n    David Saff\n\nkk_krzysztof wrote:\n&gt; Hi all,\n&gt;\n&gt; I am new to jUnit4, so please forgive me these questions.\n&gt; I want to create a testing framework for a database system.\n&gt; I use Eclipse so I want to use its build-in jUnit GUI.\n&gt; It allows only to execute a single testing class or all testing\n&gt; classes found in a package or a project.\n&gt;\n&gt; I find some things impossible to do.\n&gt;\n&gt; 1. I have many testing classes in different packages.\n&gt; 2. Each testing class may have its own @Before and @After methods.\n&gt; 3. Some things have to be done for the whole testing class once...\n&gt; should it be put in a class  constructor?\n&gt; 4. I need to create a database environment before all tests from all\n&gt; clasesses are run. \n&gt; @BeforeClass seems to be called once at the beginning... but then\n&gt; @AfterClass is called before other test classes are run. \n&gt;\n&gt; It looks like, in jUnit4 all testing classes are completely separated\n&gt; during testing.\n&gt; Please, explain what is the philosophy of jUnit4 because there are so\n&gt; few documents on it.\n&gt;\n&gt; How can I create and run a test suite in Eclipse using its GUI?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; KK\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo!
