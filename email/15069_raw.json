That \nsaid, many testers and test suites (including myself and my suites, and \napparently even some of JUnit&#39;s own suites) tend to gravitate toward one \ntest class per tested class. This is a very common pattern, even if it&#39;s \none JUnit wasn&#39;t meant to support and one that causes test suites to \ntake longer to run than they otherwise would.\n\nThis does make me wonder if maybe JUnit has been cutting the wrong way \nall these years. Perhaps it should be designed to organize tests by \nmodel class rather than fixture. This certainly seems a lot more natural \nto a lot of developers.\n\n-- \n﻿Elliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nXML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim\n\n",
