But, measuring coverage (and quality with a tool like JesTer)<br/>\n&gt;is useful with a group that is still learning to TDD properly.  It&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;not so much looking for full coverage as an indication that all is<br/>\n&gt;right, it&#39;s more looking for holes in the coverage that indicate that<br/>\n&gt;tests are missing.  And, yes, 100% is unrealistic because there will<br/>\n&gt;always be things that don&#39;t need testing.. like toString methods that<br/>\n&gt;are to make test results more meaningful.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Perhaps I just don&#39;t know how bad I am at TDD yet.
