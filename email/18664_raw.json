HooohHahhh!\n\nJimm in order for this to work the way it says it\nworks it has to parse source and store it in some\nmodel.  Then analyze it...looks like using rule sets.\n\nI&#39;m sure you could use the same model and rule sets\nto generate tests (Just shooting from the hip.  I&#39;d have to look at it a \nlittle more\nto see whether I could come up with a concrete example. )\n\nhttp://pmd.sourceforge.net/\n\nThanks for letting me us Joakim.  Can&#39;t wait to\nto hook it up to my maven projects.\n\nCheers,\n- Ole\n\n\n\n\nJoakim Ohlrogge wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; As a matter of fact...it would be nice to have\n&gt; &gt; something that enumerates the branches and generates a\n&gt; &gt; report on which methods has a number of branches over\n&gt; &gt; a certain limit...for code refactoring and maintenance\n&gt; &gt; purposes.\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Ole,\n&gt;\n&gt; I have not read the whole thread yet so if this has already been\n&gt; suggested I&#39;m sorry.\n&gt; PMD actually reports methods with a cyclomatic complexity that is\n&gt; larger than 10. If I&#39;m not mistaken that is what you&#39;re looking for.\n&gt;\n&gt; I find this helpful to find targets to refactor in legacy code. When\n&gt; TDD:ing the PLP (my abbreviation for path of least pain) keeps the\n&gt; cyclomatic complexity down (Like Jeff Langr suggested earlier in the\n&gt; threat).\n&gt;\n&gt; Cheers!\n&gt; /J\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n\n\n",
