Our \nproduct has the ability to crawl through source code and provide a \npowerful search capability that is powered by semantics.  In this \ncase, we have crawled through several java development frameworks \n(JUnit, JDK, Struts, Eclipse, NetBeans) and are trying to get some \nproduct feedback.\n\nIf you are interested, setup is easy.  Send an email to \nresearch@... and we&#39;ll send you login credentials and a \nURL.  Try it out and let us know what you think.\n\nThanks in advance for your help.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
