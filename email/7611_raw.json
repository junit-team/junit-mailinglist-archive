Thats a lot.\n\nActually, I find that I&#39;m spending even *larger* amounts of time working \nwith my tests.  I haven&#39;t measured, but I&#39;d have to guess around 70%.\n\nAnd if I look at that number, it scares the hell out of me:  70% of my \ncoding time doing &quot;non-production&quot; work.\n\nBUT.....\n\nI&#39;ve used JUnit regularly for the last year, after having not used any \nkind of regular testing tool for the many years of development before that.\n\nAND....\n\nI am *FAR* more productive at producing working software now with JUnit \nthan I ever was before.  The time spent working with tests\n\na) Saves me oodles of time implementing my features.  Once the test \ndefines what I need to do, I write it.  Once *all* of the tests work, my \nfeature is done.  No more guessing about boundary conditions, unexpected \nconsequences, etc....\nb) Creates much better (in particular, decoupled) code.  This makes \nsubsequent bug fixes/enhancements far easier to implement.\nc) Allows me to fix bugs fearlessly and cleanly rather than having to \nadd lots of &quot;if-then&quot; conditions around my bugs to try to isolate the \nconditions causing the bugs.\n\nTHEREFORE...\n\nYes, I spend HUGE amount of time working with my tests.  And that time \nhas *MORE* than paid for itself.  Several times over, I&#39;d guess.  I&#39;ll \nnever develop again without that investment in testing.\n\nFINALLY...\n\nI don&#39;t think DBC or JUnit are different in this regard.  I view both of \nthese as tools that formalize the contract of your methods/objects. \nBoth of them take a lot of time to set up and maintain (I feel it would \nbe naive to expect contracts to write or maintain themselves for any but \nthe most trivial methods).\n\nSo with either approach, be prepared to invest a significant amount of \ntime outside &quot;traditional&quot; production coding.  But be prepared to get \nhuge return on that time.\n\nPC\n\nPaul Christmann\nPrior Artisans, LLC\nmailto:paul@...\n504-587-9072\n\n\n\n",
