I am trying out JMock2 at the moment; I can\ndevel=\r\nop on Java5 even though the production code gets deployed to Java4.\n\nI quit=\r\ne like the API, and apparently from Elliotte&#39;s recent reporting at\nJavaOne,=\r\n Builders are expected to become more prevalent!\n\nhttp://www.cafeaulait.org=\r\n/#May_9_2007_46487\n\nJMock2 not quite as nice[1] as the previous framework t=\r\nhat I used, since the\nexamples on the site seem to have omitted all the cas=\r\nts that are required.\n\ncontext.checking(new Expectations() {{\n   one (subsc=\r\nriber).receive(message);\n}});\n\nBut in practice with JMock2, it would seem t=\r\no be:\n\ncontext.checking(new Expectations() {{\n   ((Subscriber) one (subscri=\r\nber)).receive(message);\n}});\n\nPreviously, I would have had something like:\n=\r\n\nsubscriber.expects.receive(message).once();\n\nWhere subscriber isn&#39;t a plai=\r\nn Subscriber reference; it&#39;s a reference to a\nSubscriberMock generated-clas=\r\ns that implements Subscriber, along with some\nadditional functionality / fi=\r\nelds.\n\nBut then you don&#39;t have to worry about generating the mock code when=\r\n you use\nJMock. YMMV, and that&#39;s a minor point.\n\nI also like that JMock2 is=\r\nn&#39;t invasive, in that we have a lot of JUnit3 test\ncases and I don&#39;t need t=\r\no alter the existing inheritance hierarchy. It&#39;ll do\nfor now until I start =\r\nto feel some pain and then see whether any of the\nother solutions available=\r\n can address that particular pinch point for me.\n\nCheers,\n\nJames\n\n[1] I&#39;m u=\r\nsing &#39;nice&#39; in the Northern English sense of &quot;I prefer bitter to\nlager, but=\r\n it&#39;s not worth worrying about&quot;.\n\nOn 11/05/07, Alexandru Popescu =E2=98=80 =\r\n&lt;the.mindstorm.mailinglist@...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;   On 5/11/07, J.

Smalltalkers and Rubyists love it, others hate it.=\r\n It&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; the most creative use of Java I&#39;ve ever seen and if the API fails=\r\n, I\n&gt; &gt; blame Java, not JMock.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n&gt; From their web site:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; context=\r\n.checking(new Expectations() {{\n&gt; &gt; one (subscriber).receive(message);\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n}});\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; subscriber is the mock object whose expecting receive(message)=\r\n once. The\n&gt; &gt; punctuation is ugly, but the words are beautiful. If it were=\r\n this,\n&gt; &gt; wouldn&#39;t it be nearly perfect?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; context.checking expectat=\r\nions [\n&gt; &gt; one: subscriber.receive(message);\n&gt; &gt; ]\n&gt;\n&gt; Probably. And you ha=\r\nve presented only the first code line from the\n&gt; example, which is still un=\r\nreadable: one(subscriber): does mean in fact\n&gt; that subscriber will receive=\r\n ONE message and not what the english\n&gt; reading of that code implies. And t=\r\nhis is clear once you are using the\n&gt; other methods.\n&gt; The following lines =\r\nof the sample are becoming even more readable as\n&gt; they are completely disc=\r\nonnected from the previous. Comparing this\n&gt; with:\n&gt;\n&gt; expect(myobject.doSo=\r\nmething()).andReturn()\n&gt;\n&gt; I still find this last one more readable. But, I=\r\n have to agree this is\n&gt; more a matter of taste, and so I will not argue on=\r\n (in fact I said it\n&gt; from the beginning that my ranking is a matter of tas=\r\nte and experience\n&gt; with these frameworks and not something I am absolute a=\r\nbout).\n&gt;\n&gt; bests,\n&gt;\n&gt; ./alex\n&gt; --\n&gt; .w( the_mindstorm )p.\n&gt; TestNG co-found=\r\ner\n&gt; EclipseTestNG Creator\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; --\n&gt; &gt; J.
