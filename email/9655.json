Frameworks can be a real barrier to <br/>\ntesting.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother option:<br/>\nCan you subclass the class in question?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother option:<br/>\nDigging *DEEP* into the bag of tricks, here&#39;s something to use when <br/>\nnothing else will work:  See Neil Swingler&#39;s javassist class loader <br/>\nin the Files section of this group:  <br/>\nName &quot;name.swingler.neil.classreloader.zip&quot;, description &quot;reloading <br/>\nclassloader that can introduce imposter mock classes&quot;.  It will <br/>\nenable you to swap out the offending 3rd party class with one of your <br/>\nown making.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a similar situation, I used jAdvise (which is built on top of <br/>\njavassist) to intercept and modify the internal behavior of the 3rd <br/>\nparty class factory so that I could create instances of the class I <br/>\nwanted to test, intercept all method calls to it, and disable <br/>\neverything it did that had undesirable side effects, replacing method <br/>\nbody functionality with my mock implementation.</div>",
