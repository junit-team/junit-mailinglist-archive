I&#39;m writing a new test\n&gt; runner called Jumi http://jumi.fi/ whi=\r\nch will have native support for\n&gt; running tests in parallel in the same JVM=\r\n, and it take care of capturing\n&gt; the System.out/err of individual tests.\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; Jumi will do the output capturing by replacing System.out/err with its\n&gt;=\r\n own implementation, which saves all print events (the same way it saves\n&gt; =\r\ntest lifecycle events), synchronizes both out and err (I think all\n&gt; curren=\r\nt IDEs and build tools fail this:\n&gt; https://github.com/orfjackal/misc-tools=\r\n/blob/master/src/test/java/net/orfjackal/bugs/SystemOutErrBugTest.java),\n&gt; =\r\nand also takes care of capturing the output of threads spawned by the\n&gt; tes=\r\nt thread. For long-lived threads, such as AWT event dispatch thread,\n&gt; I wi=\r\nll also try to figure out something (I&#39;ll timestamp all print\n&gt; events, so =\r\nit should be possible to figure out roughly which test\n&gt; printed things in =\r\nthe AWT thread).\n&gt;\n&gt; The output capturing is at the top of my TODO list, so=\r\n I will have it\n&gt; implemented after a couple of productive afternoons when =\r\nI have time to\n&gt; work on it. Soon after that I&#39;ll make the first alpha rele=\r\nase.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ve looked a bit at how to integrate Jumi with maven-surefire. Ju=\r\nmi and\n&gt; Surefire have some overlap, for example both of them take care of\n=\r\n&gt; classloading and starting a JVM process. One option is to use Surefire&#39;s\n=\r\n&gt; classloading and use only the core runner parts of Jumi. Otherwise Jumi\n&gt;=\r\n would need information that what are the dependency JARs, what are the\n&gt; c=\r\nurrent project&#39;s classes, maybe also that which of them are test and\n&gt; prod=\r\nuction classes (Jumi will do caching of the dependencies&#39; class\n&gt; loaders t=\r\no speed up the tests). That would require changes to Surefire,\n&gt; or then a =\r\ncompletely new Maven plugin.\n&gt;\n&gt; kristian@... wrote on 4.1.2012 8=\r\n:51:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sorry, I was doing just what I sometimes dislike of our own us=\r\ners ;)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The real problem I want to solve is associating console outp=\r\nut from a\n&gt; &gt; running thread to a given test-case (for parallel runs).
