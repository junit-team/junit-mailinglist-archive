It was actually a rather \ninvolved reworking of the code to add a new feature. I&#39;m not hugely \nsurprised that in the new code that was added there was an undiscovered \nbug since that part of the code had not yet been through the full \nprocess the older parts of XOM have gone through (code review, static \ncode analysis, code coverage measurements, etc.)\n\n&gt; Well, yes, if you assume that your tests are 100% perfect.  They were not\n&gt; the first time, why do you assume they are now?\n\nAny time someone starts using words like &quot;perfect&quot; or &quot;100%&quot;, alarm \nbells go off in my head. It&#39;s never a question of perfect or 100%. It&#39;s \na question of better or worse. My argument is that test-driven \nprogramming is better.  It produces more robust, less-buggy code than \ntraditional approaches based on attempts to understand without actually \nverifying that understanding.\n\nYes, it would probably be better if I did understand exactly why the fix \nworked but:\n\n1. If I waited to understand it, it would take much longer to actually \nproduce the fix.\n\n2. If I had focused on understanding the fix, I might not have found it \nin the first place. My theoretical understanding wwas pointing at a much \nmore complicated solution. It&#39;s easier to figure out why something you \nknow works does work, than it is to figure out what will work.\n\n3. (and this is a point a lot of people are missing) XOM is at most a \nmedium sized code base. One person probably could understand all of it \ngiven a finite amount of time. However, there is an increasing amount of \ncode for which only a heuristic and experimental understanding is possible.\n\nMy argument is that there is hope, and that truly large, convoluted, and \n  opaque code bases are nonetheless practically fixable and \nmaintainable, despite the lack of understanding.\n\n&gt; Don&#39;t you have enough proof that you are overestimating the\n&gt; comprehensiveness of these tests since they failed to catch two bugs in a\n&gt; short period of time?\n\nMy tests did not fail to catch two bugs in a short period of time. There \nwas only one bug (at least found so far) and it was in a newly \nimplemented feature. Nothing will be perfect the first go round. That&#39;s \nwhy we do beta testing and code review and so forth. I&#39;m frankly \nsurprised there haven&#39;t been more bugs found in the new parts; but it&#39;s \nprobably that they haven&#39;t received extensive shakedowns yet.\n\nBy contrast in the two months since XOM 1.1 was released, there has been \nexactly one minor bug found in it (I wasn&#39;t checking for null where I \nshould have been. See \nhttp://cafe.elharo.com/java/a-minor-glitch-in-type-safe-enums/ .) That&#39;s \npretty damn good. It&#39;s certainly much better than competing products \nlike JDOM can claim. Complex programs can never be perfect but they can \nasymptotically approach perfection.\n\n-- \n﻿Elliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nXML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim\n\n",
