Look at ALL the technical optinons and then judge them<br/>\nagainst risk/cost/ and so on. I just have seen too many times people propose<br/>\nthe &quot;technical elegant solution&quot; which was not &quot;optimal from a business<br/>\nperspective&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;It seems your experience is somewhat limited ...<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well. My knee jirk response is to take exception to that. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nI am definitely new to the Java world and my experience is definitely<br/>\nlimited in this area. I come from the database world where I use to<br/>\nrun/administer/code the databases that processed online credit card<br/>\napplications and on which people could look at their credit card statements<br/>\nonline for Fleet. So, I am very familiar w/ big roll outs.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks guys for taking the time to engage a newbie.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>]On Behalf Of<br/>\nHarald Mueller<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, January 25, 2006 11:13 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [junit] Re: Thanks - running out of memory<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Elliotte Harold wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Speaking as one of those professionals, in a desktop or server<br/>\n&gt; &gt; environment buying RAM is cheaper than almost any other alternative.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Most especially it&#39;s cheaper than rewriting the code to use less memory.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Frankly, I&#39;d fire a consultant who recommended continued hacking at $80<br/>\n&gt; &gt; an hour to save a byte here or a byte there instead of spending a few<br/>\n&gt; &gt; bucks to upgrade the RAM. In 2006 anyone who&#39;s running a desktop or a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; server with less than a gigabyte of RAM is being penny wise and very<br/>\n&gt; &gt; pound foolish.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It seems your experience is somewhat limited ...<br/>\n<br/>\n2 real scenarios:<br/>\n<br/>\n1000 servers in outlets of a Europe-wide retailer, having been installed<br/>\nover the last 5 years (sometimes, for tax reasons, with considerable<br/>\nquarrels with &quot;deciders&quot; in different countries = there are even older<br/>\nmachines around, because they are now completely written off [fiscally] and<br/>\nhence &quot;are most valuable&quot; [in the eyes of accounting]).<br/>\nIn 2001, physical mem size was not 1GB or 2GB, but 256MB or (at most) 512MB.<br/>\nOk - let&#39;s upgrade to 1 gig:<br/>\n* Travel expense for technicians to all those locations ... large enough.<br/>\n* Outsourcing the memory upgrading?: With the required quality (hardware<br/>\nchange must happen overnight, 100% guaranteed to run next day in the morning<br/>\nwhen shop opens), outsourcing cannot be bought consistently throughout all<br/>\ncountries. (Why aren&#39;t there two servers so that memory change needn&#39;t be<br/>\n100% perfect? ... is was simply never necessary).<br/>\n<br/>\nNet effect: It is (much!) cheaper to optimize some(! - critical, usually<br/>\nnewer) programs to run in 256MB even today, with 80 EUR/hour for a few weeks<br/>\nof work.<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\n<br/>\nSimilarly for a company that leases out HW+SW for a special sort of<br/>\nretailers: 5 year contracts, around 10000 widely dispersed customers =<br/>\nreplacement rate of 2000/year = around 10/day. Highest cost of operations<br/>\nare technicians&#39; travel expenses; therefore the pressure to keep HW exactly<br/>\nthe same for 5 years (until end of lease - then, all HW is routinely<br/>\nchanged) is very high.<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have a better idea how to deal with these situations in the<br/>\nshort...medium run, please tell us!<br/>\n<br/>\n* send memory over the network? ;-) (maybe there&#39;s *something* to this -<br/>\nhonestly! sometimes weird ideas are worth to look at -, but we currently<br/>\nfail to see the realistic solution following from this ...)<br/>\n<br/>\n* re-architecture everything to run centrally/on some server farms!!! ... ?<br/>\n:-( not always possible because of<br/>\n** fiscal laws that require data to be accessible in the country of the<br/>\nbusiness [yes, there are laws like this; e.g. in France]<br/>\n** up-times, bandwidths and other qualities of networks (many customers are<br/>\non ISDN lines; throughout Europe, network QoS varies considerably)<br/>\n** in 2nd scenario, one USP is actually that data are on-site.<br/>\n** and more ...<br/>\n<br/>\nBut still, I agree with the concept that buying hardware should at least be<br/>\n*considered* an option when dealing with memory problems - so that there is<br/>\na comparison of price tags of SW optimzation vs. HW replacement/upgrading<br/>\nfor a qualified management decision which way to go.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards<br/>\nHarald M.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\n10 GB Mailbox, 100 FreeSMS/Monat <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.gmx.net/de/go/topmail\">http://www.gmx.net/de/go/topmail</a><br/>\n+++ GMX - die erste Adresse f|r Mail, Message, More +++<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!
