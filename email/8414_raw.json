However, I have not found an article that explains the\nadvantages of unit testing vs integration testing.  My perhaps naive hunch\nis that the cost-per-bug-eliminated of unit testing is higher than that of\nintegration testing.  It appears this way because a single integration test\ntests a lot more code than a single unit test and takes about the same\namount of time to construct.  Plus it seems to me that a whole suite of unit\ntests with 100% code coverage cannot guarantee that even the simplest system\nwide behavior is correct (e.g. the web page appears).  Am I wrong about\nthis?  Can someone refer me information about this topic.  A scientific\nstudy paper with real numbers would be welcome.\n\nMike Bresnahan\n\n\n\n\n",
