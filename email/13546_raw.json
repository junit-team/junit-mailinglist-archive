Our research addresses test\nadequacy, test suite execution, test coverage monitoring, regression\ntest selection and prioritization, and test data generation.\nCurrently, we have a number of case study applications that we use\nduring the experimental evaluation of the efficiency and effectiveness\nof our algorithms.\n\nHowever, we are interested in applying our techniques to new\napplications written by additional software developers.  In\nparticular, we are currently interested in testing applications that\n(i) interact with relational databases through SQL Strings and JDBC\ndrivers, (ii) use an RDBMS such as HSQLDB, MySQL, or PostreSQL (with a\npreference to programs that use HSLQDB), (iii) use the DBUnit and\nJUnit testing frameworks, and (iv) includes the tracking of defects\nand version information.\n\nIf you are developing a program that fits (or nearly fits)\nrequirements (i) - (iv), could you contact me on or off list with\ninformation about your project?  If your application does not have all\nof the above characteristics (e.g., no defect tracking or the use of a\ndifferent RDBMS) I would still be interested in learning more about\nyour project.  Also, I would be excited to learn more about your\ntesting approach beyond those discussions that have already taken\nplace on this list.\n\nKind Regards,\n\ngreg\n\n-- \nGregory M. Kapfhammer\nInstructor, Computer Science Department\nAllegheny College\nOffice: 814-332-2880\ngkapfham(at)allegheny(dot)edu\nhttp://cs.allegheny.edu/~gkapfham/\n\n\n",
