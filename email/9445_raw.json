Comments are not executable and cannot \n&gt; fail if\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; they are wrong, so they are waste.\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; So code should never be commented??  This makes no sense.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Comments that merely describe how the code does things is waste. The\n&gt;  &gt; code already says that. These are the comments that a vast majority of\n&gt;  &gt; programmers insist on writing, largely because someone taught them to do\n&gt;  &gt; so in school.\n&gt; \n&gt; In my experience\n&gt; \n&gt; *  few programmers comment code to any degree\n\nI have observed the opposite: programmers consistently overcomment their \ncode, translating the code into natural language, sometimes on a \nline-by-line basis, but often on a block-by-block basis.\n\n&gt; *  fewer comments correlate well with more bugs\n\nFewer comments are generally not the cause, though: fewer comments \ncorrelate with laziness which correlates with lack of attention to \ntesting, which causes more bugs. I have observed heavily-commented buggy \ncode and sparsely-commented code with few defects. In addition to \nobserving both I have written both.\n\n&gt; *  as often as not, it&#39;s faster to rewrite uncommented code than it is\n&gt;    to figure out what the code &quot;already says&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; If the code is doing anything complex, if it is implementing rules\n&gt; that contain domain-specific knowledge, comments are not waste --\n&gt; they are absolutely essential.\n\nNot essential, although they can help. If the code simply said what the \ncomments say, then they *would* be both the comments and the logic. It&#39;s \nsimply a matter of choosing better names and extracting methods where \nappropriate.\n\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt;                                    Diagnostic messages are not\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; assertions and cannot fail if they are wrong, so they are waste.\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; It is trivially easy to put diagnostic messages inside an if -- you\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; see them if something of interest occurs.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Waste is waste. Large amounts of waste often build themselves up from a\n&gt;  &gt; large number of small amounts of waste.\n&gt; \n&gt; Often you work with code that is uncommented, buggy, and incomprehensible.\n&gt; One useful way to figure it out is sprinkling diagnostic messages here\n&gt; and there, running it, and watching what falls out.\n&gt; \n&gt; There are many other approaches.  Some people use one, some another.\n&gt; If you are fortunate, you have a variety of people working with you, so\n&gt; that when you can&#39;t understand what&#39;s in front of you, you can pass the\n&gt; problem over to someone else with a different set of skills.  If you\n&gt; are _very_ fortunate, you will have more than one tool in your own bag\n&gt; of tricks.\n\nI&#39;m not saying that I don&#39;t know how to write printf() or use the \ndebugger. I just choose not to when I can write tests instead. It&#39;s \nclear to me that tests provide the same benefits as printf() *and* \npreserve what I have learn for posterity. &quot;It&#39;s no good to anyone else \nin your head, Mozart.
