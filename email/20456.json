I want to write test cases that reference interfaces only<br/>\n&gt;  as I want to publish them as part of a spec – they are to define the<br/>\n&gt;  semantics of classes.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>When faced with this situation in the past I separated the tests into<br/>\n&quot;white box&quot; and &quot;black box&quot; parts.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe black box parts I implemented as assertions about the behaviour<br/>\nimplied by the interface.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe white box parts I implemented as unit tests that put a known<br/>\nimplementation into a known (significant) state and then passed it to<br/>\na black-box assertion.<br/>\n<br/>\nE.g. I might have two implementations of List: LinkedList and ArrayList.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would have assertions that I can add an element onto the end of the<br/>\nlist and retrieve the last element, adding an element increases the<br/>\nsize by one, etc. etc..<br/>\n<br/>\nI would have tests for the implementations that exercised specific<br/>\ninternal states.  For example, for an ArrayList I would have tests<br/>\nthat added an element to an empty list, to a list that has a full<br/>\narray that needs to be expanded, etc.  Those tests would call the<br/>\nassertions.  Something like:<br/>\n<br/>\n  import static ListAssert.assertAddingAnElementIncreasesTheSizeByOne;<br/>\n<br/>\n  ...<br/>\n<br/>\n  @Test public void<br/>\n  addingAnElementIncreasesTheSizeByOne() {<br/>\n       assertAddingAnElementIncreasesTheSizeByOne(new ArrayList());<br/>\n<br/>\n       List listAtCapacity = new ArrayList(4);<br/>\n       listAtCapacity.addAll(Arrays.asList(1,2,3,4));<br/>\n       assertAddingAnElementIncreasesTheSizeByOne(listAtCapacity);<br/>\n   }<br/>\n<br/>\nIf those tests got too large (as above), I&#39;d break them into separate<br/>\ntest methods.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Nat</div>",
