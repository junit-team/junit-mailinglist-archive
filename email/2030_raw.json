Choice one would be to get your java code out\nof any scriptlets and into classes (and if you have more than 50 lines of\njava in your jsp&#39;s I&#39;d say its a good idea anyway) and test the classes the\nway you would normally do.  If you really don&#39;t want to do this, I believe\nyour only other choice is to look into HttpUnit.  HttpUnit allows you to\nwork with the html output of your jsp using getXXX methods (like getTitle()\nto work with the &lt;TITLE&gt; tag info, etc.) and also lets you work with the\nhtml page DOM model.  Working with the DOM model would likely be a bit\nbrittle, in that any change to the nesting in your html would probably mess\nyou up.  There is also an apache project called &quot;Cactus&quot; that you could use\nif you want to test your jsp as a servlet, but I don&#39;t know much about that\noption yet.  Hope this helps.\n\nFrank\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: bhanu prakash [mailto:bhanu_sistla@...]\n&gt; Sent: Friday, July 20, 2001 9:06 AM\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: [junit] How to write Test Cases for Jsp&#39;s\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Hi Every Body\n&gt;    My name is Bhanu . how to write a test cases for\n&gt; JSP&#39;s since i have following doubts\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) since in my jsp&#39;s i dont have classes how can i\n&gt; write the test cases in junit.\n&gt; 2) if any body have sample examples please send to me\n&gt; 3) i didnot find any examples for jsp&#39;s in junit.org\n&gt; 4) Can any body explain the procedure\n&gt; regards Bhanu\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; Get personalized email addresses from Yahoo!
