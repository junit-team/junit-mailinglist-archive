These names do not go in the constant pool.\n\nThat is, since the test doesn&#39;t measure I/O, there should be no effect\nat all.  But there is.  The long names ran consistently faster in the\nJava tests. Since the test runs in a continuous loop, this can&#39;t be the\nresult of any startup effect.\n\nFWIW I translated the Java into C++ and ran the same benchmark.  Oddly\nenough, the variable name length definitely has a pronounced effect\nin C++.  On a slow PC used as a test box, results looked like this:\n\n           Java    C++ -O1    C++ -O2\nshort      13.4s     3.2s       4.1s\nlong       12.0s     8.4s       7.2s\n\nmemory use 12.4 MB   0.8 MB     0.8 MB\n\nTurning up the optimization on the C++ code had the disturbing effect\nof slowing down the short-name tests while improving the long-name\nresults.  Further optimization produced no clear benefit.\n\nThe machine was running RedHat 8.0 Linux, gcc 3.x, Sun Java 1.4.1_02,\nand X.  It was otherwise idle.  It has a CPU clocked at 533 MHz.\n\nIf you include startup times, C++&#39;s performance advantage over Java\nimproves.  However, it comes as a pleasant surprise that Java comes\nthis close to C++.\n\n--\nJim Dixon  jdd@...   tel +44 117 982 0786  mobile +44 797 373 7881\n\n\n",
