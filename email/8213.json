    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1578162946\">I installed Redhat 9, junit 3.8.1, and two JDK&#39;s -- 1.4.1 versions 01<br/>\nand 02.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegardless of how I set classpath, the TestRunner will run and<br/>\nfind no classes.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is puzzling that junit.jar can be found in order to run the<br/>\nTestRunner class, but it cannot find the junit.samples.AllTests<br/>\nclass.<br/>\n<br/>\nA few specific questions:<br/>\n1) I have tried copying junit.jar to various locations.  It<br/>\nstarts out in the junit3.8.1 directory.  Is the standard procedure<br/>\nto use that directory as its home, or is it normally moved to the<br/>\nJDK lib directory.  Would this make any difference?<br/>\n<br/>\n2) On Redhat 8.0, the swingui TestRunner could find and run<br/>\ntests on some built-in classes, such as junit.samples.money.MoneyTest.<br/>\nNow with Redhat 9, a clean install with no files from the old <br/>\nsystem, no test classes can be found -- not VectorTest, not <br/>\nmoney.MoneyTest, not samples.AllTests, nor tests.AllTests.  Does<br/>\nanyone know why these were found in Redhat 8 but not Redhat 9?<br/>\n<br/>\n3) Is there any kind of minimum hardware requirement?  I haven&#39;t<br/>\nseen one in the documentation, but I&#39;m running this on a bad<br/>\nmachine, namely a 300 MHz x86 with 256 MB RAM.<br/>\n<br/>\n4) The documentation for the installation process gives exactly<br/>\none troubleshooting tip.  It advises that if the initial tests do<br/>\nnot run, one should check to make sure that the junit.jar is on<br/>\nthe classpath.  If one is certain that junit.jar IS on the classpath<br/>\nbut it&#39;s still not working, one seems to be out of luck.  Are there<br/>\nany other JUnit troubleshooting documents or sources?<br/>\n<br/>\n5) Dave Astels posted earlier that he is using Redhat 9, Java 1.4.1<br/>\n01, and junit 3.8.1.  Are there other Linux JUnit users who can <br/>\ncompare their configurations, and possibly post configuration files <br/>\nsuch as .bashrc, etc.?  <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks</div>",
