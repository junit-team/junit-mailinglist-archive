But the point I was making about logging was echoing this<br/>\nsentiment:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Logging equips the developer with detailed context for application<br/>\nfailures. On the other hand, testing provides quality assurance and<br/>\nconfidence in the application. Logging and testing should not be<br/>\nconfused. They are complementary. When logging is wisely used, it can<br/>\nprove to be an essential tool.&quot;<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://jakarta.apache.org/log4j/docs/index.html\">http://jakarta.apache.org/log4j/docs/index.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI adopted log4j about three years ago, in which time I&#39;ve developed a<br/>\nlot of code that has log4j logging in it. I&#39;ve written a lot of tests<br/>\nin that time as well, and have used log4j in tests sometimes,<br/>\nespecially when the setUp() methods get a little complicated. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, when there&#39;s a lot of output in the logs coming from the<br/>\ncode, it helps to mark where a setUp() method ends and a test begins.<br/>\nCertainly in properly isolated unit tests there is not much need for<br/>\nlogging anywhere. (In my experience in the field, there are plenty of<br/>\nJUnit &#39;unit&#39; tests out there that do not qualify as properly isolated<br/>\nunit tests). But I don&#39;t have a problem with complex tests and test<br/>\nharnesses that log when they need to, what holds for code is true for<br/>\ntests. For unit tests, I totally accept the superiority of assertions.<br/>\nFor other kinds of tests, I think logging can provide additional<br/>\ncomplementary information that can save time finding out why the<br/>\nfailing test failed.<br/>\n<br/>\nMalcolm<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Thu, 2003-09-18 at 07:59, John L.
