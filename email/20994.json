There I had access to the method TestCase#getName() which returns the name of the test, something like &quot;testMe&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor JUnit 4 I wrote a class which extends org.junit.runners.Suite. There I can do some stuff I can do in the runBare() method of JUnit 3. I won&#39;t confuse you too much, since I have a lot of questions concerning runBare() migration from JUnit 3 to 4.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the ugliest question now I have is this: In case of a exception I want to call a method which captures the screenshot (UI tests). The file name must contain the test case name which failed. In JUnit 3 I would simple use TestCase#getName() in the run bare method. But how do I do this with JUnit 4? Please don&#39;t look too much on the letters but on my intention. How to get the name of the test method which is currently executed in the test runner?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
