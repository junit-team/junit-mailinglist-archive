I gave myself ten days to cool off and then came back to it, \nand it still shocked me. I&#39;ve heard claims like this before, but I&#39;m \nastounded to hear it from the co-author of Extreme Programming. This is \na horrible coding practice that flies in the face of good agile \ndevelopment practices and basic object oriented principles.\n\nBasic OOP: keep everything as private as you possibly can. This gives \nyou maximum flexibility for future development and change. Anything that \nis private can be refactored or changed as needed for any reason that \narises. Once you publish an interface as either protected or public \nyou&#39;re stuck with it. You can&#39;t change it later for performance or \nchanging requirements or to fix a mistake. People may be depending on \nit. This mandates that you don&#39;t put anything into your interfaces \nunless you&#39;re really, really sure it&#39;s right. If you leave something out \nfor which a use case is later demonstrated, you can always put it in. \nYou can almost always change a method from private to protected without \nbreaking anyone&#39;s code. However, you cannot go the other way.\n\nBasic Agile: You Ain&#39;t Going to Need It (YAGNI). Why make the effort to \ncreate a protected method that more than likely will never be used or \nwill be used so rarely it won&#39;t even pay back the complexity cost of the \nextra JavaDoc? Designing for subclassing is hard. It takes roughly three \ntimes as much effort as designing a final class, maybe more. Most \nnon-final classes in the wild are fundamentally broken. Of course \nsometimes you do need subclasses, but don&#39;t go adding extension points \nwilly-nilly until you&#39;re ready to design them properly, document them \nfully, consider their implications for other dependent methods, and do \nall the other hard work required to create a truly extensible class. \nJava erred by not making final the default, but there&#39;s no reason we \nhave to repeat its mistakes.\n\n-- \n﻿Elliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nXML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim\n\n",
