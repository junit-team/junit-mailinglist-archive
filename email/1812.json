But you are maybe an exception, but I&#39;m not :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Really?  If anything I&#39;d think that the tests should be more well <br/>\nwritten, not just for the customer, but for the product team evolving <br/>\nthe software.  The tests document the intended use of the API, and good <br/>\ntests will tell you much more about the software than studying the API <br/>\nout of context.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; - you don&#39;t handle exceptions and errors in your test cases like you should treat them in a real application<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Actually, testing for expected exceptions may provide better <br/>\ndocumentation as to what action should be taken when the software is <br/>\nintegrated into a real application.  In other words, by providing a test <br/>\nmethod that enumerates and tests for possible exceptions raised by the <br/>\nAPI you are effectively documenting the exception handling.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; For the customer:<br/>\n&gt; - if JUnit is not provided, he has to install the _right_ version if he wants to run the tests<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Agreed, although there are options for distributing JUnit.  Also, as <br/>\nJUnit becomes more pervasive, I think this becomes moot.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; - what if the customer doesn&#39;t know JUnit at all?  Will he understand the test cases, asserts, test suites (...) concepts immediatly?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is certainly a valid point.  However, one could argue that learning <br/>\nJUnit is easier than learning the structure of vendor-specific examples.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; - what if the customer installs JUnit, runs your tests and get a &quot;ClassCastException&quot; because he didn&#39;t overwrite the excluded.properties file?<br/>\n&gt; - and so on...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>OK, there may be general installation issues that we can&#39;t predict, but <br/>\nwe can document common problems.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Instead of test cases, I would simply write a client application that uses the product&#39;s API.  It&#39;s the best proof that the API can be used in a real application.  The customer can start from this example to make his own application.  Everybody did that, isn&#39;t it?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Indeed, this is the common approach.  I&#39;m simply suggesting that JUnit <br/>\ntests may be more beneficial in their ability to automatically check <br/>\nresults and their well-defined structure and composability.  I&#39;ve often <br/>\nrun example client applications that did something (at least I assumed <br/>\nso by all the console messages), but I&#39;m not quite sure if it was correct.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;their storage and bandwidth penalties.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s not a storage or bandwidth problem.  It&#39;s about how you want to communicate with your customers.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I want to communicate to my customers that what I&#39;ve delivered to them <br/>\nworks, that there are measures in place to verify that it continues to <br/>\nwork, and that they can learn how to communicate with it using concrete <br/>\nexamples.  Unit tests seem to be the most effective way to achieve this.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nMike Clark<br/>\nClarkware Consulting, Inc.<br/>\nCustom Software Architecture, Design,<br/>\nDevelopment, and Performance Consulting<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.clarkware.com\">http://www.clarkware.com</a></div>",
