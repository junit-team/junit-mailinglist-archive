I&#39;m interested \n&gt; &gt; in feedback regarding what others think is adequate. I am not \n&gt; &gt; interested in why the question itself is incorrect, I know that. If \n&gt; &gt; you were shown a project plan, told that unit tests weren&#39;t worked \n&gt; &gt; into the schedule, but that they should be, and asked what percentage \n&gt; &gt; of time should be added - what would you say. Keep in mind the \n&gt; &gt; positive - management wants unit tests included and is willing to \n&gt; &gt; consider allotting time.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Any thoughts?\n&gt; \n&gt; Automated Unit Tests DO NOT add to the length of a project. Add 10% to the project plan if you are not &quot;allowed&quot; to write unit tests. This number increases exponentially over the life of the project. Take at Beck&#39;s XP Explained for a proper discussion on managing the cost of change curve.  \n&gt; \n&gt; When faced with this question, I give two estimates. One with unit testing, and one without. The one without unit testing is always substantially larger.  If the estimate is predetermined, then you need to cut scope or extend the timeline. If you have no power to negotiate, then prepare for a deathmarch. \n&gt; \n&gt; Hope this helps.\n&gt; \n&gt; Mike Rettig\n\nHowever, if the developers on the project aren&#39;t familiar with unit\ntesting or whatever tool you&#39;re going to use, there will be a time cost\nfor them to come up to speed.  People new to unit testing will almost\ncertainly code slower than usual while they get used to it.  How much\nthis will impact the project depends on how long term the project is.\n\nOf course, the payoffs for this are huge, so this shouldn&#39;t discourage\nyou.\n\nTom\n\n\n\n",
