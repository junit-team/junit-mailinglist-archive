Way at the other end of the spectrum, you test methods (or\nstatements if you want to really go far), in which you have a high degree of\ncontrol and granularity but low coverage.\n\nNow add effort to the mix, which tends to push you to maximize coverage per\nunit of effort expended creating the test. This is what makes UI\nrecord/playback tools so compelling (if you forget their other limitations).\n\nSo one of the reasons we unit test must be to increase our control over what\nis tested. Discovering defects early is one of the other main reasons, but\nis not relevant to this discussion. Given this, it seems reasonable that on\noccasion, we might want to test a private method, assuming that it does not\nmeet the criteria for being refactored, but in general we should keep in\nmind the necessity to minimize effort while satisfying functionality\ncoverage objectives.\n\n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nMike Silverstein, Lead Architect\tvoice:  (919) 858-8300 x29\nSilverMark, Inc.\t\t\tfax:    (919) 858-8308\n5511 Capital Center Drive\t\tmobile: (919) 669-5906\nSuite 510, Raleigh, NC 27606\t\ttoll free: (888) 588-0668\nhttp://www.silvermark.com\t\tmsilverstein@...\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Johannes O.

But then if we are accepting that testing\n&gt; &gt; public/friendly/protected methods adecuately test these methods, why not\n&gt; go\n&gt; &gt; one step beyond and say that black box testing is all we need?\n&gt; It seems to\n&gt; &gt; me that testing private methods is as useful and valid as testing\n&gt; &gt; non-private ones, just at a different level of granularity.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; snip\n&gt;\n&gt;     yes, you may test private methods. But that is not what actually is\n&gt; intended by unit testing. The idea is to write tests for the unit and\n&gt; thereby to specify what this unit is capable of. The idea of unit\n&gt; testing is\n&gt; not testing per se. The cool thing is that you finish writing your unit,\n&gt; when your tests pass, which cuts down time in testing and implementation.\n&gt;\n&gt;     Later unit testing (the TestAll called when integrating) helps us\n&gt; finding out misbehaving units after refactoring or other code changes.\n&gt;\n&gt;     I know that this aproach is not based on mathematical\n&gt; abductions but on\n&gt; experience. Thus I don&#39;t want to make a religion out of it, but just do it\n&gt; as good habbit.\n&gt; And I don&#39;t believe that there is a proof, that testing is more and more\n&gt; efficiant, the more granular you test. Well, you could test every line of\n&gt; code.\n&gt;\n&gt; Toyin\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
