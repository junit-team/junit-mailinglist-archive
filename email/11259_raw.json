I originally\n&gt; replied to avoid misconceptions about our product, but I don&#39;t\n&gt; believe that this is the right group to discuss Agitator or software\n&gt; agitation in general.\n\nOn the contrary, if this is a technology that compliments JUnit, then \nit&#39;s absolutely a propos. Don&#39;t feel bad about discussing it here.\n\n&gt; This is a JUnit group and Agitator does not generate &quot;JUnit\n&gt; automatically&quot; as the original posting incorrectly suggested. \n&gt; Agitator does not generate JUnit at all - it uses a different\n&gt; approach and complementary approach to unit testing.  Also, unlike\n&gt; JUnit, it&#39;s a commercial product (i.e. not free.) \n\nThat doesn&#39;t bother me, and since it&#39;s out in the open, that ought not \nto bother the others, either. I changed the subject title, if that helps.\n\n&gt; I am a big fan/user/promoter of JUnit, and I believe this group will\n&gt; be best served if we stick to topics that are more directly related\n&gt; to JUnit and JUnit-based technology.\n\nIt&#39;s not like this is a high-traffic group. Even if Agitator were off \ntopic -- and I&#39;m not convinced that it is -- we can handle it.\n\n&gt; So, again, it does not sound to me like this is the right group to\n&gt; ask or answer questions about Agitator, and I will refrain from\n&gt; doing so (although it&#39;s really hard to see your &quot;baby&quot; mis-\n&gt; represented or mis-understood :-)).\n\nDon&#39;t do so on our account. I would like to discuss it, and this is a \ngood a place as any.\n-- \nJ. B.
