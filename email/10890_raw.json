I prefer &quot;target&quot; class.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;Now in the testee method, it has to access a global \nvariable &quot;logger&quot; \n&gt; &gt;(required for logging purpose) defined in that class. \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;When i run the test case it gives me NullPointertException for \n&gt; &gt;&quot;logger&quot; as it is not able to access it. \n&gt; \n&gt; That sounds like it can&#39;t access it to me as well.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;Can someone please tell me why it cannot access &quot;logger&quot;... \n&gt; \n&gt; I really don&#39;t want to sound like J.B. here, but I think that we \nneed to see some code. Can you extract the smallest portion of your \ncode that still displays the reported symptom, post it here and some \nof our finest people will take a look at it.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;Thanks in advance.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Khyati \n&gt; \n&gt; Simon\n\n\n\n",
