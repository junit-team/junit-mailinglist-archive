Please forgive me for I failed to find a=\r\nn answer.\n\nI&#39;m using @RunWith(Parameterized.class) and want to have test na=\r\nmes other than foo[int]. foo[int] isn&#39;t very helpful e.g. in Jenkins logs.\n=\r\n\nIs there a way for the test to specify the name it should be known by?\n\nFo=\r\nr now, I&#39;ve taken the Parameterized source code and modified it so that if =\r\nthe test class has a getTestName() method the runner will call that to get =\r\nthe test name.  This is currently working and I&#39;d be happy to share.\n\nHowev=\r\ner, I did have to bodge things more than I like to get it to work.  If I do=\r\n the straightforward change, then the framework asks for the test name from=\r\n the runner before the test object is created.  I&#39;m currently dealing with =\r\nthis by creating the test object when the test runner is created, i.e. in t=\r\nhe constructor of the test runner and keeping it around for the lifetime of=\r\n the test runner.  This works - but may violate some design assumptions I d=\r\non&#39;t know about and means that any exception that can be thrown creating a =\r\ntest object can cause an initialization exception.\n\nI think this is useful =\r\nfunctionality - I know of others who have also wanted something like this. =\r\n There are suggestions on StackOverflow for example to use the first parame=\r\nter of a parameterset as the test name.  I think letting the test specify a=\r\n getTestName method and defaulting to the current mechanism if there isn&#39;t =\r\none is better as its more backward compatible and gives the test developer =\r\nmore control.\n\nSo:\n\n  o is there an existing or planned way to support nami=\r\nng individual parameterized tests?\n\n  o are you interested in the approach/=\r\ncode I&#39;m trying?\n\n  o if so, what would be the best way to integrate into t=\r\nhe existing framework so that the test object is created before the test na=\r\nme is requested?\n\nbwm\n\n\n\n",
