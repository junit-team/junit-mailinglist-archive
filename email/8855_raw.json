In my version though, the\nhotkey combination is: Alt+R, S, 3.\n\nIf you really want to add a menu item to a popup menu you use the\norg.eclipse.ui.popupMenus extension point.  It has two &quot;modes&quot;, one where\nyou add a menu item to a specific popup menu and another where you\nassociate a menu item with an object.  In the latter it will show up on any\npopup menu that appears when you have a specific object selected.\n\nIt sounds like your problem is solved, but if you want to write a plugin\nanyways, you would use the latter mode where you would hook the Run JUnit\naction to an IFile (you could probably add it to a Java object, but I don&#39;t\nknow what the name of the interface is off the top of my head.  It has some\nweird name like org.eclipse.jdt.core.IPackageFragment, or\norg.eclipse.jdt.core.ICompilationUnit or something.  You can try those.)\nand then add a filter such as *Test.java so that it only shows up when you\nselect a file with that naming convention.  Here is a little plugin.xml\nexerpt:\n\n&lt;extension point=&quot;org.eclipse.ui.popupMenus&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;objectContribution\n    id=&quot;org.eclipse.ui.articles.action.contribution.popup.object&quot;\n    objectClass=&quot;org.eclipse.core.resources.IFile&quot;\n    nameFilter=&quot;*Test.java&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;filter\n      name=&quot;projectNature&quot;\n      value=&quot;org.eclipse.jdt.core.javanature&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;/filter&gt;\n    &lt;action\n      id=&quot;com.myCompany.ui.myPlugin.actions.JUnitAction&quot;\n      label=&quot;Run JUnit Test...&quot;\n      icon=&quot;icons/junit.gif&quot;\n      menubarPath=&quot;additions&quot;\n      class=&quot;com.myCompany.ui.myPlugin.actions.JUnitAction&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;/action&gt;\n  &lt;/objectContribution&gt;\n&lt;/extension&gt;\n\nActually, you may just want to dig through eclipse code to find the JUnit\naction that already exists and plug that straight into the action portion\nof your objectContribution tag.\n\nCode examples and information are based off the article:\nhttp://www.eclipse.org/articles/index.html so you may want to reference\nthat for more information.  Specifically I was looking at Example 3.\n\n-Phil\n\n\n\n                                                                                                    \n                      Jason Rogers                                                                  \n                      &lt;jacaetevha@fast         To:      JUnit &lt;junit@yahoogroups.com&gt;               \n                      -mail.org&gt;               cc:                                                  \n                                               Subject: RE: [junit] [OT] Eclipse plugin             \n                      07/30/03 05:54                                                                \n                      AM                                                                            \n                      Please respond                                                                \n                      to junit                                                                      \n                                                                                                    \n                                                                                                    \n\n\n\n\nBut that also means that the file has to be open in the editor.
