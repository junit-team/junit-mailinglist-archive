Because the EPL has superseded the CPL as its new version, it is not necessary to seek the approval of past contributors. You can simply re-license the code under the EPL as other projects such as Mondrian and olap4j[1] have done.<br/>\n<br/>\nObviously, the license is your decision. I just want to clarify that the burden of moving to the EPL is relatively low.<br/>\n<br/>\nSee the second last paragraph of Section 7 of the CPL and EPL.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike Milinkovich<br/>\nExecutive Director,<br/>\nEclipse Foundation<br/>\n<br/>\n[1] <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://forums.pentaho.com/showthread.php?69944-License-upgrade-from-CPL-to-EPL\">http://forums.pentaho.com/showthread.php?69944-License-upgrade-from-CPL-to-EPL</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, Kent Beck &lt;kentb@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Thank you for the message. It is not practical to change the <br/>\n&gt; license for JUnit because of the difficult of identifying and <br/>\n&gt; notifying contributors.
