I=\r\nn other words,  \nthe complex conditionals don&#39;t get complex until I have a =\r\nsecond test  \nthat drives out the &quot;or&quot; part of the clause. So in theory I&#39;d=\r\n end up  \nwith the combinatorial explosion you&#39;re suggesting.\n\nHowever, in =\r\npractice that doesn&#39;t happen often.\n\nSometimes these complex conditionals e=\r\nnd up as method calls:\n   if (a =3D=3D null || b =3D=3D null)\nbecomes:\n   i=\r\nf (areAnyNull(a, b)) // yes this is a trivial example, but it&#39;s  \nnot atypi=\r\ncal\n\nI end up with comprehensive tests against areAnyNull; that&#39;s easy to  =\r\n\ntest (it often becomes a public method on another class). Then I only  \nco=\r\nncern myself with two cases to cover the &quot;if&quot; block in the enclosing  \nmeth=\r\nod (createUrl in this example). I often find that encapsulating  \nthe compl=\r\nex conditionals within separate methods (a) helps make the  \ncode easier to=\r\n follow,  (b) often helps reduce the overall code size  \n(it makes some dup=\r\nlication more obvious), and (c) makes some defects  \nvery apparent.\n\nEven i=\r\nf I need to explode the tests, they end up extremely short,  \nsometimes a s=\r\ningle line, by virtue of test refactoring.\n\nIn general, it&#39;s the refactorin=\r\ng that keeps the tests in TDD sane. I  \ndon&#39;t end up with a lot of methods =\r\nthat have more than a couple of  \nbranch statements, so I don&#39;t usually hav=\r\ne a problem with covering all  \nthe combinations.\n\nRegardless, I&#39;d rather h=\r\nave the test that demonstrates that the rhs of  \nthe conditional really wor=\r\nks, and that all of the combinations thus  \nreally work. Particularly given=\r\n short circuit evaluation, I&#39;ve  \nencountered many cases where not complete=\r\nly testing this allowed  \ndefects that weren&#39;t found until much later.\n\nReg=\r\nards,\nJeff\n\n",
