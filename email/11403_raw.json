I want to run &quot;testCommon&quot; first\n&gt;  &gt;   which is in the &quot;BasicGetListTest&quot; but when I subclass it with\n&gt;  &gt;   &quot;GlucoseGetListTest&quot; it is always executed last. I read some of\n&gt;  &gt;   the postings in this newsgroup, but it seems that such kind of\n&gt;  &gt;   requirement point a desing flaw and I should somehow rearrange my\n&gt;  &gt;   Unit Test Structure to made the tests indepentdant. I&#39;m stuck with\n&gt;  &gt;   it.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve been thinking for a while that this is a serious problem in JUnit\n&gt; (and most unit testing frameworks), because it&#39;s been such an annoyance\n&gt; for so many people. Let&#39;s face it; a lot of groups of tests do have\n&gt; known dependencies between tests such that if test A fails, we know that\n&gt; the output of tests B, C and D are uninteresting. Yet we end up running\n&gt; B, C and D anyway, and then searching through all the error output for\n&gt; the failure that we know is the &quot;real&quot; one, ignoring all the others as\n&gt; spurious.\n&gt; \n&gt; I would really like a way to be able to express this dependency\n&gt; information to the test framework, so that I can get back the\n&gt; interesting results with fewer uninteresting results. Can anybody\n&gt; think of a good way to do this?\n\nOne thing you could try is this:\n\n1. Add an abort() method to interface Test that allows a test to be \naborted. For a test case, this simply fails the test with an &quot;aborted&quot; \nmessage. For test suites, this causes the suite to stop executing entirely.\n\n2. Express dependencies by building a special OrderedTestSuite class \nthat aborts when a test fails. All tests that depend on each other this \nway go into an OrderedTestSuite.\n\nThis may require a custom test runner, but that would be a good thing: \nit would mean less clutter in the base test runners.\n\nAs for the details, I don&#39;t know, since I don&#39;t want it yet. :)\n\nAnother possibility -- something that may be easier, for now -- is to \nfilter the test results based on your dependencies, since that seems to \nbe the underlying problem. I think that executing all those tests would \nbe interesting, in case doing so uncovers some strange, unexpected \ndependency that you /need/ to fix.\n-- \nJ. B.
