But I\n&gt; really don&#39;t think that this will solve problems:\n\nYes, changing that aspect of the framework would be a very significant,\nand challenging, change. It&#39;d be interesting to see how well it could\nbe done without having to change other interfaces or any existing\ntests. Perhaps by having the assert* methods find the test context (a\nslightly new/changed concept) in which they are running and logging the\nfailure there.\n\n&gt;    assertTrue(obj != null);\n&gt;    assertTrue(obj.status() == 3);\n\nThis would throw a NullPointerException (we really can&#39;t change the\nbehavior of the JVM) in the second assertTrue. The framework might deal\nwith an Exception from a test that had already failed an assertion as\nmeaningless and not to be recorded, or might be clever about what\nshould be recorded.\n\nAnother example:\n\n  // For two arrays: expected, actual\n  assertEquals(expected.length, actual.length);\n  for (int i = Math.min(expected.length-1, actual.length-1); i &gt;= 0;\ni--)\n  {\n    assertEquals(expected[i], actual[i]);\n  }\n\nThis would log a complete list of incorrect elements in addition to the\nsize being wrong. So, this example just goes to show that multiple\nreporting might be helpful in some circumstances. Obviously not all,\nand quite possibly not useful enough for the sizeable and challenging\nframework change required to support it.\n\nRegards,\n\nRob\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nMake international calls for as low as $.04/minute with Yahoo!
