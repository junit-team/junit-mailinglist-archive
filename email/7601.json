The reason for that is not so obvious <br/>\nto me. I think positive, so I don&#39;t think you&#39;re a troll, I think it was your <br/>\nway to find out how DBC and TDD interact - just say something you&#39;re not <br/>\nreally convinced of yourself but hold that view to see what arguments are <br/>\nagainst it. Please, next time just ask for these arguments instead of <br/>\nbehaving like a time sink.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBasically, mock objects are a certain sub group of dummy objects.<br/>\nThe whole field of dummy objects can be classified into three kinds:<br/>\n1. Stub objects which replace the real objects but don&#39;t provide all <br/>\nfuncionality.<br/>\n2. Dummy objects which just replace the real objects.<br/>\n3. Mock objects which are dummy objects or stub objects <br/>\n(This helpful classification is taken from &quot;Unit Tests mit Java&quot; by Johannes <br/>\nLink, a really good German book about Unit Testing for TDD in Java using <br/>\nJUnit and some extensions and tools)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTake java.sql.ResultSet as an example.<br/>\nThe real object would be an implementation of ResultSet provided by a JDBC <br/>\nDriver.<br/>\nA Stub would be a ResultSet implementation that does not provide all features <br/>\nof ResultSets.<br/>\nA Dummy would be a ResultSet implementation that provides all features of <br/>\nResultSets but replaces the ResultSet of a JDBC driver within the test <br/>\nbecause it is more convenient to test a class using a ResultSet without a <br/>\nreal database connection.<br/>\nA Mock would be a Stub or more a Dummy which provides additional features like <br/>\ngenerating statistics about the usage of the ResultSet, which could be logged <br/>\nto a Logger (file, network or whatsoever) when the .close() or .finalize() <br/>\nmethod is invoked, and that way could tell wether<br/>\na) All rows of the ResultSet were iterated over<br/>\nb) All columns of the ResultSet were read<br/>\nc) The ResultSet was correctly closed or closing was omitted<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile a Dummy would behave somewhat normal, since it&#39;s task is to just replace <br/>\nthe real object, a Mock object could also influence the test. The Mock <br/>\nResultSet e.g. could be instructed to throw an SQLException on the third <br/>\ninvocation of next() to verify wether the CUT/OUT correctly deals with <br/>\nexceptions.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNow to your questions:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Does the framework has to provide mock objects for JUnit tests?<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No, it&#39;s not required that the framework provides the mock objects. But it <br/>\nwould be helpful.<br/>\nToday, most frameworks do not provide Dummies or Mocks. Some frameworks <br/>\nprovide stubs, like &quot;javax.swing.table.AbstractTableModel&quot; for <br/>\n&quot;javax.swing.table.TableModel&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Is it possible to use Mock objects when using a ERP framework?<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That depends on wether the framework deserves the name framework or not.<br/>\nA real framework consists of two parts: The API/SPI and the implementation. If <br/>\nthe framework is a real framework, you could simply implement the API/SPI <br/>\nyourself to create mock objects and replace the implementation.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut your questions do not provide the information *where* and *why* you want <br/>\nto use Mock objects. So you program using the ERP API yourself? Or is it just <br/>\na code generation tool like Versata?<br/>\n<br/>\nProviding complete mock objects can be really elaborate. In most cases, you <br/>\ndon&#39;t provide full featured mock objects based on dummies, but mock objects <br/>\nbased on stubs providing all required features.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBye<br/>\n- -- <br/>\nITCQIS GmbH<br/>\nChristian Wolfgang Hujer<br/>\nGeschäftsführender Gesellschafter<br/>\nTelefon: +49  (0)89  27 37 04 37<br/>\nTelefax: +49  (0)89  27 37 04 39<br/>\nE-Mail: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Christian.Hujer@...\">Christian.Hujer@...</a><br/>\nWWW: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.itcqis.com/\">http://www.itcqis.com/</a><br/>\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----<br/>\nVersion: GnuPG v1.0.7 (GNU/Linux)<br/>\n<br/>\niD8DBQE+kqlczu6h7O/MKZkRAiLRAJ9V3uHqCZRNb9yO+Wjzr8EDSTLikwCeOLFO<br/>\nMeRnrKaHeBD69sX7JzTU01k=<br/>\n=yvDF<br/>\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----</div>",
