One difference I see from ScalaTest =\r\nis\nthat a &quot;theory&quot; is not treated as a special kind of test. J/NUnit\n&quot;theor=\r\nies&quot; map to ScalaTest &quot;properties.&quot; J/NUnit &quot;assumptions&quot; (when\nused with t=\r\nheories) map to ScalaTest &quot;conditions.&quot; And J/NUnit &quot;data\npoints&quot; map to a =\r\nScalaTest &quot;table.&quot;\n\nSo for this example from the JUNit 4.4 release notes:\n\n=\r\n@RunWith(Theories.class)\npublic class UserTest {\n  @DataPoint public static=\r\n String GOOD_USERNAME =3D &quot;optimus&quot;;\n  @DataPoint public static String USER=\r\nNAME_WITH_SLASH =3D &quot;optimus/prime&quot;;\n\n  @Theory public void filenameInclude=\r\nsUsername(String username) {\n    assumeThat(username, not(containsString(&quot;/=\r\n&quot;)));\n    assertThat(new User(username).configFileName(), containsString(us=\r\nername));\n  }\n}\n\nYou might do this in ScalaTest:\n\npublic class UserSuite ex=\r\ntends FunSuite {\n\n  test(&quot;filename includes username&quot;) {\n\n    val examples =\r\n=3D\n      Table(\n        &quot;username&quot;,\n        &quot;optimus&quot;,\n        &quot;optimus/pr=\r\nime&quot;\n      )\n\n    forAll (examples) { username =3D&gt;\n      whenever(!usernam=\r\ne.contains(&quot;/&quot;)) {\n        (new User(username).configFileName) should inclu=\r\nde (username)\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nA false &quot;whenever&quot; expression is a faile=\r\nd &quot;condition,&quot; that causes a\n&quot;property evaluation&quot; to be &quot;discarded.&quot; But t=\r\nhe test encompasses all\nproperty evaluations. Here there&#39;s just two propert=\r\ny evaluations, one\nof which gets discarded, but usually there would be a ta=\r\nble of many\nexample usernames, otherwise it isn&#39;t worth using a table.\n\nSo =\r\nwhat&#39;s missing from ScalaTest at this point is some way to do\nsomething lik=\r\ne this, also taken from the JUnit 4.4 release notes:\n\n@Test public void fil=\r\nenameIncludesUsername() {\n   assumeThat(File.separatorChar, is(&#39;/&#39;));\n   as=\r\nsertThat(new User(&quot;optimus&quot;).configFileName(),\nis(&quot;configfiles/optimus.cfg&quot;=\r\n));\n}\n\nThat&#39;s actually a use of an assumption disconnected with a theory, a=\r\nnd\nit seems useful. I haven&#39;t put anything like that into ScalaTest\nbecause=\r\n no one has asked for it, and I wanted to make sure that if I\nput something=\r\n in it is based on real requirements. It seems to me that\nTestNG&#39;s dependen=\r\ncies are a similar concept, except instead of an\nassumption expression (lik=\r\ne File.separatorChar is (&#39;/&#39;) here) deciding\nwhether a test is &quot;skipped&quot;, i=\r\nt is the failure of a dependent test.\n\nSo one thing I&#39;d like to hear about =\r\nfrom JUnit, NUnit, and TestNG\nusers are use cases. How have theoryless assu=\r\nmptions actually been\nused in practice? What are they good for in reality?\n=\r\n\nThe other thing is the naming. To Esko I&#39;d say that I think &quot;skipped&quot;\nsoun=\r\nds to me most like the generic term that would encompass all of\nthese conce=\r\npts, so maybe that would not be a good term for me to use\nin ScalaTest if I=\r\n end up adding this feature. I hadn&#39;t thought of\n&quot;canceled&quot; until Charlie m=\r\nentioned it, but that sounds like a clear\nway to describe a test that for t=\r\nhis run is being skipped because of\nsome unmet &quot;assumption.&quot; Another word y=\r\nou could consider for your\nrunner, Esko, is &quot;discarded,&quot; which is what I us=\r\ne for properties\nthrown out during a property check in ScalaTest.\n\nIn case =\r\nyou&#39;re curious, the details on table-driven property checks in\nScalaTest is=\r\n here:\n\nhttp://www.scalatest.org/scaladoc-1.6.1/#org.scalatest.prop.TableDr=\r\nivenPropertyChecks\n\nBill\n\nOn Tue, Jun 28, 2011 at 11:58 AM, Charlie Poole &lt;=\r\ncharliepoole@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi David,\n&gt;\n&gt; The devil is of course=\r\n in the details... see inline...\n&gt;\n&gt; On Tue, Jun 28, 2011 at 10:37 AM, Davi=\r\nd Saff &lt;david@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Just to make it clear, the s=\r\ntatuses translate as:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 1) Passed: We know it works\n&gt;\n&gt; Yes\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n 2) Failed: We know it doesn&#39;t work.\n&gt;\n&gt; Yes, but we don&#39;t know why without=\r\n further info. For example, an\n&gt; assertion may have\n&gt; failed or an unexpect=\r\ned exception may have been thrown. I currently recognize\n&gt; &#39;Failed&#39;, &#39;Faile=\r\nd:Error&#39; and &#39;Failed:Cancelled&#39;. The last one could equally well\n&gt; be treat=\r\ned as a sub-category of Inconclusive but I made it a failure because\n&gt; the =\r\ncancellation is not something the test can control.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; 3) Skipped: We _c=\r\nould_ know if it works, but have asked not to be told\n&gt; &gt; (because the info=\r\nrmation is redundant, or to save time, for example)\n&gt;\n&gt; No... The test neve=\r\nr ran... OR we are treating it as if it never ran\n&gt; (since tests can\n&gt; be i=\r\ngnored dynamically in their setup.

I&#39;m considering adding=\r\n a\n&gt; &#39;Severity&#39; field to\n&gt; the result so that this coloring (or other text =\r\ndisplay) is automatic.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; 4) Inconclusive: We _can&#39;t_ know if it works\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; Yes. This is the one we use in Theories. My intent is that\n&gt; Inconclusiv=\r\ne should have\n&gt; no effect on the success of a theory _unless_ all results a=\r\nre\n&gt; Inconclusive. I can&#39;t\n&gt; make up my mind what it should mean in a norma=\r\nl test. :-)\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Is that right? I can dig that.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m in favor of a =\r\ncategorization that we believe will serve without\n&gt; &gt; alteration for five y=\r\nears or so: there&#39;s too many runners to say &quot;Oh,\n&gt; &gt; yeah, we thought of a =\r\nfifth status!&quot; and expect them all to catch up.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; David Saff\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nOn Mon, Jun 27, 2011 at 8:42 PM, Charlie Poole &lt;charliepoole@...&gt; wro=\r\nte:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; For NUnit 3.0, I took a page from the Gallo project and defined f=\r\nour\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fundamental test\n&gt; &gt; &gt; statuses: Passed, Failed, Skipped and Inco=\r\nnclusive. =C2=A0These can be extended\n&gt; &gt; &gt; by use\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of an arbitrary te=\r\nxt field, e.g.: Skipped:Ignored.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; This allows a test runner/repo=\r\nrter to at least give some basic info without\n&gt; &gt; &gt; being extended.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; E=\r\nxtended runners could recognize specific test outcomes and report them\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; separately.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Note that in this design, Skipped and Inconclusiv=\r\ne carry no notion of being\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a GoodThing,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a BadThing or just neut=\r\nral. In practice, for example, we might color the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; testing bar yellow =\r\nfor\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Skipped.Ignored but just plain Skipped doesn&#39;t have any effect on=\r\n the test\n&gt; &gt; &gt; outcome.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Charlie\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 2011/6/27 C=C3=A9d=\r\nric Beust =E2=99=94 &lt;cedric@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; **\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n On Fri, Jun 24, 2011 at 2:36 PM, Bill Venners &lt;bill@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; The skipped concept shows up in JUnit as assumptions, and in T=\r\nestNG as\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; dependent tests, I think.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; I think =\r\nthat JUnit marks tests that fail their assumption as &quot;Failed&quot;,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; while=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; TestNG marks them as &quot;Skipped&quot; (a status which doesn&#39;t exist in JUn=\r\nit\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; AFAIK).\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; --\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; C=C3=A9dric\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; [Non-te=\r\nxt portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yahoo!
