Also, with equals() method I \ncannot =\r\nknow which data member in the class actually caused a mis- match,\nsince I a=\r\nssert only at the class level.\n\nThis is why I am thinking what to do... hop=\r\ne this clarifies the \nproblem. Any suggestions would be appreciated. Thanks=\r\n again for your \nhelp so far.\n\n- krishnan\n\npisharath_k wrote:\n\n&gt; I have a b=\r\nasic question. I have a set of classes whose values are\nset\n&gt; from a file b=\r\ny a Reader object. Now I want to test whether these \n&gt; values are set corre=\r\nctly. I can use preset values for testing purpose.\n\n&gt; But due to the large =\r\nnumber and complexity of these classes it would \n&gt; be very difficult and cu=\r\nmbersome to create objects with these preset \n&gt; values manually for testing=\r\n against the ones created by the Reader.\n&gt;\n&gt; I am thinking of creating a he=\r\nlper class for each of the above \n&gt; classes. I will pass it the object to c=\r\nompare, and it will compare the\n\n&gt; object&#39;s data against pre-defined values=\r\n that will be stored in the \n&gt; helper classes. I will need to extend junit&#39;=\r\ns Assert class for these \n&gt; helper class, since they will assert if there i=\r\ns a data mismatch. So \n&gt; my question is, is it okay to extend Assert in my =\r\nown classes ? Has \n&gt; anyone faced this problem before, and if so how did\nyo=\r\nu\n&gt; solve this ? Any help will be appreciated.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; - krishnan\n\n\n\n=\r\n\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\njunit-unsubscribe@yahoog=\r\nroups.com\n \n\nYour use of Yahoo!
