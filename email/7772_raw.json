We should only test a Unit instead of testing the \n&gt;unit, the framework, =\r\nthe application server and the database.\n&gt;\n&gt;We are a 7 man team with little=\r\n experience in what we do... We have \n&gt;noone in our team who is an expert.\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;What we do is to use a not finished ERP business framework which \n&gt;hides=\r\n away the technical EJB framework us, the Java developers. This \n&gt;framework=\r\n uses CMP and a Fast Lane Reader. So there are many layers \n&gt;between the da=\r\ntabase and the test.\n&gt;\n&gt;I suggested to use mock objects and Test Driven Dev=\r\nelopment. But the \n&gt;senior programers don&#39;t want it. I listed all the many =\r\nadvantages \n&gt;but couldn&#39;t convince them.\n\nDo not try to convince them. It o=\r\nnly frustrates you and them. Wait for them to see the light. In the meantim=\r\ne, do what makes sense to you.\n\nInstead of mock, though, simply separate th=\r\ne business logic from the data access and you will see an improvement. When=\r\n testing business logic, do not worry about where the data comes from -- ma=\r\nke it come from anywhere convenient for you. In your tests, that would be m=\r\nemory and in production that would be the database.\n\nGood luck.\n\nJ. B.
