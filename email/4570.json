What I<br/>\n&gt;intended to say was: lets make the discussion clear for those who<br/>\n </span></blockquote>don&#39;t<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;want to participate in/read the &#39;testing private methods&#39; thread, and<br/>\n&gt;move to a &#39;Testing & Design&#39; thread that brings the issue into better<br/>\n&gt;focus.  I see that my mistake was to omit &#39;private method&#39; when I<br/>\n&gt;mentioned separating Design and (private method) Unit testing.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Separate threads! Much different. I thought you meant &quot;go to another<br/>\ngroup and talk about this...&quot; No-one could argue against separate<br/>\nthreads -- it&#39;s just nicer to know that a message&#39;s contents match its<br/>\nsubject.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;What we could be saying then is:<br/>\n&gt;- to those who want to test private methods, use another tool<br/>\n&gt;- to those who want to learn about how testing can improve design,<br/>\n </span></blockquote>keep<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;on reading (this thread)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The statements above are not mutually exclusive, and, therefore, can<br/>\n </span></blockquote>be<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;done in conjunction.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No argument can be made against such precise statements. Much clearer.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Also, we could try to discover how many of this mailing list&#39;s readers<br/>\n&gt;would actually like to be able to test private methods (democracy?).<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;we find this to be a respectable percentage, we could then proceed to<br/>\n&gt;find out whether they know of the benefits testing only public methods<br/>\n&gt;has on design.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I admit that the general flow of discussion is:<br/>\n<br/>\nA: I want to test private methods.<br/>\nB: No, you don&#39;t. You want to change your design.<br/>\nA: No, I don&#39;t. I want to test private methods.<br/>\nB: But your design...<br/>\nA: Don&#39;t bore me with design! I have work to do!<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s easy to see how each side drifts further apart from the point.<br/>\nIt&#39;s the reason I&#39;ve stayed out of the discussion more and more lately,<br/>\nuntil my recent idea about how to word my position in a better way.<br/>\nThat idea was simply triggered by the most recent &quot;I want to test<br/>\nprivate methods.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; [...] JUnit was not built for that purpose. Not only that, its<br/>\n&gt;&gt; creators feel <br/>\n&gt;&gt; (well Kent, anyway; I don&#39;t know how Erich feels) that one of <br/>\n&gt;&gt; the strengths <br/>\n&gt;&gt; of JUnit is that when the tests become painful to write, <br/>\n&gt;&gt; there is a tendency <br/>\n&gt;&gt; for the design to have an organic weakness that prevents the <br/>\n&gt;&gt; testing. As <br/>\n&gt;&gt; Kent says in this case, it&#39;s an opportunity to learn about <br/>\n&gt;&gt; your design.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I also know about Kent&#39;s position, and how much testing plays a part<br/>\n </span></blockquote>in<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;how HE sees development practices should be undertaken (XP, TDD).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, it&#39;s not just Kent. Sometimes people on this list say, &quot;I&#39;m not<br/>\nKent&quot; to dismiss Kent&#39;s ideas. It ain&#39;t just Kent. Many, many, many of<br/>\nus agree with Kent, share his experience and hold the common vision.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; If you are going to say, &quot;Take your testing/design<br/>\n&gt;&gt; discussions elsewhere,&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I am *really* sorry if my post could be misconstrued in that manner!<br/>\n&gt;Once again, I believe I mentioned the fact that many an insight has<br/>\n </span></blockquote>been<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;gained from these discussions.  Keep it up!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I apologize for jumping to such a conclusion. Rather a shame that<br/>\nthat&#39;s the majority of exercise I get these days...<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; It&#39;s all in how you define &quot;unit&quot;. To me, it&#39;s the exported<br/>\n&gt;&gt; methods of a <br/>\n&gt;&gt; class or interface. Kent and Erich may define it differently. <br/>\n&gt;&gt; Clearly, you <br/>\n&gt;&gt; define it differently. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I was only voicing my opinion for the testing of private methods being<br/>\n&gt;as it is a popular request.  I myself believe in the benefits of<br/>\n </span></blockquote>testing<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;public methods only, and therefore have no need for that<br/>\n </span></blockquote>functionality.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen we agree. Nothing could be better. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I would add that, since testing of private methods is such a popular<br/>\n&gt;request, JUnit&#39;s position on the matter should be clearly stated in<br/>\n </span></blockquote>the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;documentation (README, index.html, FAQ, ...), and why (pointer to<br/>\n&gt;Testing & Design discussions).  [A quick search on Google revealed<br/>\n </span></blockquote>that<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;the only place private methods are mentioned on the junit.org site is<br/>\n&gt;where JUnitX is mentioned.]<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I would argue that JUnit is conspicuously silent on the matter, and<br/>\nwhat one doesn&#39;t say can say much. :) (OK, it&#39;s a stretch...)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; You folks can test private methods until your brain pops out,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; but just don&#39;t <br/>\n&gt;&gt; expect JUnit to do it out of the box. It was never designed <br/>\n&gt;&gt; for that. It was <br/>\n&gt;&gt; never designed for that *on purpose*. I don&#39;t know why that <br/>\n&gt;&gt; is such a big <br/>\n&gt;&gt; deal.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;And it isn&#39;t!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>So let&#39;s get back to normal programming. (Pun intended.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I am just questioning whether *on purpose* is actually<br/>\n&gt;the reason, or whether it was never envisaged to be used that way.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Kent could settle this question, if he reads this.
