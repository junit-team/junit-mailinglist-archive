It was <br/>\njust <br/>\n&gt; too fragile, and every time I set things up I got that annoying <br/>\nerror <br/>\n&gt; about the classpath, which seems to be saying &quot;it is your fault, <br/>\nand <br/>\n&gt; you&#39;re an idiot, so don&#39;t bother us&quot;. Once I made my own test <br/>\nsuite as <br/>\n&gt; a static instance, managed the TestResult object myself and added <br/>\na <br/>\n&gt; TestListener instance, a whole bunch of this stuff became much, <br/>\nmuch <br/>\n&gt; easier.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Including this.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The TestListener instance has access to every test as it is run. <br/>\nSo, at <br/>\n&gt; that point, you can have something you log, however much of it you <br/>\n&gt; want. One can even have an external source of information at that <br/>\n&gt; point. We have a database of our tests and I can query that in the <br/>\n&gt; TestListener and annotate the results with whatever stuff I want.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I frankly do not know whether junitreport can do these things. But <br/>\nit <br/>\n&gt; just puts out html. I can do that well enough myself, once i have <br/>\nthe <br/>\n&gt; information.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; - ray<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On Aug 16, 2004, at 9:44 AM, valerie_abelin wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m using Ant to run junit and junitreport.  I like the HTML <br/>\noutput<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  that junitreport generates, but I am wondering if it is <br/>\npossible to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  include more javadoc/comments in the output rather than just the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  success/failure status and time the test took to run.  It would <br/>\nbe<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  great if junitreport could include a comment from the source <br/>\ncode<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  about what each test means.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>",
