I want my \ncompany to start using it, but in order to sell the idea I would like \nto be able to call on success/failure stories of the use of JUnit on \nprojects.  If you have the time, I would appreciate any stories of \nhow JUnit was used successfully on your project, where there any \ndisadvantages of using JUnit, do you think it improved your \nproductivity etc?  I would like to quote companies, but I appreciate \nthat you may think this is sensitive material, so I think the best I \ncan hope for is to see if the majority of responses liked using JUnit \nor not.  Either way, thank you in advance for your help.\n\nRegards\n\nMik Q\n\n\n",
