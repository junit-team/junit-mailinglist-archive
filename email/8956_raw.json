I have to thank you,\nDavid, for putting this example in &gt;\tthe spotlight.\n\n&gt;\tThe second test may be better if it depends on the data from the classpath\nwalker, rather than a mock\n&gt;\t classpath walker. Presumably the mock classpath walker will be\nimplemented to hardcode specified\n&gt;\tclasspath walking data, anyway. I propose to extract the classpath walking\ndata, then, and pass it to\n&gt;\tthe second object, rather than mocking a classpath walker.\n\nJ.B. I really have to thank you for not using this as an opportunity to\ndistract. Right after I sent this I feared I&#39;d be told &quot;integration not\nunit&quot; and have the whole thread thrown out (or get side tracked) for that\none thought. That would be a shame on one example.\n\nThat all said, I half wonder if you are being tongue in check or\nsomething -- seriously -- because if you aren&#39;t joking, you said &quot;this test\nis best if it depends upon that test&quot;. Further, you said use a side effect\n(saved result) of one test for the next. [If you are saying store it in a\nfile, check that file in and test against it, then aren&#39;t we risking that\nthe output changes and the test isn&#39;t truly valid?] This all confuses me,\nsince it seems to go against so much of what you said.\n\nBeing more practical than purist I just need to know that my code works, I\ndon&#39;t care too much what is an internal-to-my-code-integration test, or not.\nAs such, I concur with what you are saying -- but I&#39;d have my second test\nuse the class in the first, not us stored results or mock objects. I need to\nknow that the solution I provide works as a unit (irrespective of user\ninput/others) that is my goal for using junit. If not we could never junit\nanything above the JDK &#39;cos we&#39;d be doing &quot;integration&quot; test.\n\nSo, do we have a valuable concept of a dependency? If this is the best way\nfor me, the user, is to test my code -- ought I be able to want it to stop\nif the walker failed?\n\nregards,\n\nAdam\n\n\n",
