Up until now vi+BASH has been my IDE of<br/>\nchoice.  I also already program in about two dozen languages.<br/>\nTo try out my sea legs I want to compare and contract Eclipse,<br/>\nNetbeans, and IntelliJ IDEA against the following use case:<br/>\nI need to grock some java code in an existing SVN repository.  I want<br/>\nto pull down one existing java file, write some junit tests, but not<br/>\npull down the entire giant project it is attached to.  I may need some<br/>\nmoch objects too just to get it to compile, and to make the junit<br/>\ntests work.<br/>\nMost of the how-to and intro stuff I can find on these IDEs starts<br/>\nwith &quot;so you make your FIRST project, then pull down some menus, and<br/>\nthe wonderful IDE helps you type in your FIRST java program, then if<br/>\nyou really want to you can save the entire project in CVS!&quot;  This is<br/>\nhardly EVER the scenario I run into.  It is more likely I need to jump<br/>\ninto the middle of thousands or millions of existing files and learn<br/>\nto swim without breaking anything, maybe even fix a bug or add a<br/>\nfeature.<br/>\n<br/>\nCan anyone give me some tips on the &quot;best&quot; way to do this with his or<br/>\nher favorite IDE and some selection of plugins?<br/>\n<br/>\nBrian Fennell</div>",
