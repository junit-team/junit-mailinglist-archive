So far its been very difficult.\n Not happy with Abbot for SWT as it injects events at the operating\nsystem level, forcing the SWT being tested to have focus at the\noperating level (painful when Eclipse grabs focus back on test\nfailure).  Has anybody out there managed to create a mock Display or\nmock shell objects?  Is PDEUnit worth trying to use?  I did not want\nto go and make plugins when all I want to do is to make sure a\nComposite is functioning properly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
