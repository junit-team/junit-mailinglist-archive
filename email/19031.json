This way I can make sure <br/>\ndifferent databases (oracle, mssql, etc) don&#39;t exhibit different <br/>\nbehaviour.<br/>\n<br/>\nEffectively, I&#39;d like my unit tests to run multiple times with a <br/>\nlittle hook in between for me to setup my hibernate configuration (to <br/>\npoint it at each database).<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d prefer not to tweak anything in Ant because I&#39;m using Netbeans <br/>\ngenerated ant scripts and, well quite frankly, changing them scares me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t mind having a little code in my tests if needed, like setting <br/>\nup a special suite or something.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny suggestions?</div>",
