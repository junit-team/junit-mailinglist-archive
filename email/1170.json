At some level stochastic methods<br/>\n&gt; just<br/>\n&gt; aren&#39;t testable in the same way that deterministic methods are.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What random number generator are you using?  My understanding<br/>\nis that there are at least two in java (java.util.Random and<br/>\njava.math.Random), and that at least one of these can be seeded<br/>\nin such a way as to always generate the same string of numbers,<br/>\nafter the seed.  I don&#39;t remember the detail off the top of my<br/>\nhead, but it is something like this:<br/>\n      random.seed(1L) ;<br/>\n      do_testing() ;<br/>\n      random.seed(1L) ;<br/>\n      do_testing() ;<br/>\nThe two calls to do_testing will do exactly the same thing,<br/>\neven if they use the random number generator, because the random<br/>\nnumber generator will do the same thing, because you seeded it<br/>\nthe same way.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, it sounds to me like you are a math focused dude, so you <br/>\nmay be using a custom random number generator.  If so, I would <br/>\nsee if it has the repeatable behavior described above (for any<br/>\nseed at all).  If so, use it, as above.  If not, consider stubbing<br/>\nit out with a routine which has a file full of numbers.  Maybe<br/>\n10,000 numbers.  The stub routine just reads the numbers out of <br/>\nthe file and returns them, starting over as required.  Your<br/>\ntests would look something like this:<br/>\n     my_random.useLibraryFile(&quot;file_full_of_numbers&quot;) ;<br/>\n     do_your_test() ;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe result of either of these plans, is a reproducable test<br/>\ncase.  Each time it runs, you will get the exact same result.<br/>\nThis will work well for regression tests.   For other sorts of<br/>\ntesting, I think your current plan (of measuring the randomness<br/>\nof the results) is the right thing to do, even if it takes a <br/>\nwhile.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can describe these in more detail if you want.  I have used<br/>\nthe file trick (a decade ago), but I think the seed trick is<br/>\nmuch better, if it will work.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoshua Levy<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
