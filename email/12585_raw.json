This is required because you (mostly) give up \ncontrol over instantiating your test objects.\n\nThat said, you can always write your tests so that they don&#39;t need each \nother. I guess you have this:\n\n  * A few tests for connecting\n  * Several tests that use a connected object\n\nThe second category of tests do not necessarily need to use the same \nconnection from the first category of tests. The second category of \ntests can simply reconnect!\n\nIn one test suite:\n\nMyConnectingTests ... {\n     testOk\n     testFailedBecauseOfX\n     testFailedBecauseOfY\n}\n\nMyOperatingTests ... {\n     private Connection connection;\n\n     setUp() {\n         connectToWorkflowObject();\n     }\n\n     testDoXWithWorkflow ...\n     testDoYWithWorkflow ....\n}\n\nEach of the &quot;operating tests&quot; connects (separately) to the same workflow \nobject. Just make sure that tearDown() closes the connection after each \ntest.\n-- \nJ. B.
