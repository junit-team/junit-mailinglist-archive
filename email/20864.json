In one case I found that a class<br/>\n&gt; that had one method mocked was using the real method in 4.4 (which<br/>\n&gt; seems wrong) and was using the mocked method in 4.5 (which seems  <br/>\n&gt; right).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; That is, it seems as if a bug was fixed from 4.4 to 4.5.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I fixed that one test of ours and now I am looking at a few others for<br/>\n&gt; similar situations.  I am mostly just curious.
