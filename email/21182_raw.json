But it has this certain warm\nfuzzy family &quot;niceness&quot; =\r\nto it and does not feel as big and bulky as\nsourceforge does. I felt had to=\r\n mention sharesource because I like it,\nI also think that whatever is lacki=\r\nng in features would be looked into\nin order to accomodate such a well know=\r\nn project such as JUnit, but\nthats just how I reasoning if I was running sh=\r\naresource :)\n\nIn my book a distributed vcs such as Git, mercurial or bazaar=\r\n would be\na big plus.\n/J\n\nOn Tue, Dec 9, 2008 at 8:24 PM, mark_p_thornton\n&lt;=\r\nmark.p.thornton@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; --- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Nat P=\r\nryce&quot; &lt;nat.pryce@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; 2008/12/8 Shane Mingins &lt;shane.mingins@.=\r\n..&gt;:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Have you considered git and github ... just as a thought?\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; http://github.com/\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Not sure how that fits in the Java space =\r\nor not.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; It&#39;s more of a problem for people working on Windows.
