While all of<br/>\nthe things that you&#39;re suggesting to cover are well and good, I would<br/>\nstrongly recommend getting all of your students grounded in basic<br/>\nJUnit for a couple of days. Then let them have a few days/weeks to use<br/>\nit against actual code and then bring them back in for a followup<br/>\nclass on the basics again. Hold off on mockobjects, db or web testing<br/>\nuntil they can write standard tests in their sleep.<br/>\n<br/>\nJUnit is a great tool, but getting developers to use even the basics<br/>\nis a challenge. Don&#39;t ask any more of them than the basics to start<br/>\nwith.<br/>\n<br/>\nSimon<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 7/6/06, Vijay &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:vijay_nathani@...\">vijay_nathani@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; I am posting this message again with some more details. I need help on<br/>\n&gt; this issue. I would appreciate if someone helps me.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am designing a course on Testing. The course should train the<br/>\n&gt; participants on all the practical tools used for testing. The suggested<br/>\n&gt; course contents are<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 1) Using Junit for unit testing<br/>\n&gt; 2) Mock objects. (Which is better JMock or EasyMock?)<br/>\n&gt; 3) DBUnit for database testing.<br/>\n&gt; 4) Web testing. (Which tool is the best HtmlUnit or JWebTest or<br/>\n&gt; Selenium?)<br/>\n&gt; 5) Acceptance testing with FIT. (Is this tool used by many people?)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If possible, I would appreciate comments from the group regarding<br/>\n&gt; topics to be added in /deleted from this course and also the questions<br/>\n&gt; in the above message.<br/>\n&gt; Thanks............Vijay<br/>\n&gt; www.geocites.com/vijay_nathani<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
