    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1524027693\">In my implementation, the EJB is in fact an interface into a &quot;Box&quot;. The<br/>\nclients of my &quot;Boxes&quot; don&#39;t know anything about Boxes. From their point of<br/>\nview, they&#39;re simply using EJBs. Also, I do use session beans and entity<br/>\nbeans just as you describe them.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe thing I&#39;m trying to say is not so weird: the EJB-*classes* themselves<br/>\ndon&#39;t *implement* business logic, but they do *provide* it to its clients by<br/>\ncalling the appropriate classes in its private BL package (because they&#39;re<br/>\nthe interface into the Box).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe task of the EJB *class* is to provide everything that EJBs are designed<br/>\nfor to provide: network access, transaction management, resource management,<br/>\nmulti-thread behaviour (euh..., I think I forgot some but you&#39;ve got the<br/>\npoint), and I&#39;m very happy with that.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe task of the Box is to provide Business Logic to its clients. The Box is<br/>\naccessible only through an EJB interface. The Business Logic package of a<br/>\nBox is private to the Box. It can&#39;t be accessed from outside the Box (not<br/>\neven from other Boxes).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Ilja Preu?

Sounds<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; weird...<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ciao, Ilja<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Why?  I&#39;m not an EJB guy, but it seems like responsibility of an EJB<br/>\n&gt; &gt; thing is to present network accessible interface.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But an interface to *what*?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Since good OO design<br/>\n&gt; &gt; avoids many responsibilities in a given class, this makes<br/>\n&gt; &gt; complete sense<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to me.  Plus it makes things much more flexible and easier to test.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Just like I wouldn&#39;t have my GUI classes implement business logic.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; EJB is a distributed component modell. Why distributed? Mainly for<br/>\n&gt; reliability and scalability: As you don&#39;t care where a component<br/>\n&gt; actually resides, you can put work-intensive components on there own<br/>\n&gt; cluster, and one cluster can stand in for another one if it fails for<br/>\n&gt; some reason.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; There are two main types of EJBs: entity beans and session beans. Entity<br/>\n&gt; beans are data classes, they are responsible for persistence. Session<br/>\n&gt; beans are the &#39;working horses&#39;, in a typical J2EE application, here<br/>\n&gt; resides your business logic.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ciao, Ilja<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit-unsubscribe@egroups.com\">junit-unsubscribe@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
