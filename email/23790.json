    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1165615108\">Hi Kristian,<br/>\n<br/>\nWe had a similar issue. I was debating for a longer while if it makes sense<br/>\nto run parallel tests within the same VM. In many situations this speeds<br/>\nthings a lot and has a nice memory conserving footprint but you cannot<br/>\nguarantee tests won&#39;t interact with each other (in the simplest case via<br/>\nmutating system properties). Finally the decision was to do it like Apache<br/>\nLucene did it -- split tests into parallel slave VMs with repeatable suite<br/>\nexecution order and sequential test execution within a single VM. This is<br/>\nimplemented in an ANT task called junit4 here.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/carrotsearch/randomizedtesting/tree/master/ant-junit4\">https://github.com/carrotsearch/randomizedtesting/tree/master/ant-junit4</a><br/>\n<br/>\nJUnit tests inside will give you a hint how to use it, the code is still<br/>\nvery fresh so documentation is scarce.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow... this was a digression. Back to your question (because we did go that<br/>\nroute as well, only backed up), one possible solution to isolating<br/>\nsysout/syserrs of parallel tests in a single VM is:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) isolate each suite (for @BeforeClass/ @AfterClass hooks) into a separate<br/>\nthread which you have under control. This can be either a custom @Runner or<br/>\na Computer, many ways to achieve it.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) write a PrintStream implementation that redirects to a thread-local<br/>\nbuffer. This gist implements a similar idea to demux multiple thread<br/>\nstreams so that each one&#39;s output appears on a single line; you&#39;ll get the<br/>\nidea I&#39;m sure.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://gist.github.com/1561833\">https://gist.github.com/1561833</a><br/>\n<br/>\n3) once you have the above the rest is easy: replace default<br/>\nSystem.out/System.err (I assume no security manager is present or it allows<br/>\nsuch replacement), clear the buffer before suite, run your suite, flush the<br/>\nbuffer. The buffer&#39;s content will be your thread&#39;s output even though<br/>\nsystem.* are singletons.<br/>\n<br/>\nLike I said though -- I would consider using multiple jvms for running<br/>\nparallel tests instead.<br/>\n<br/>\nDawid<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Wed, Jan 4, 2012 at 7:51 AM, &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kristian@...\">kristian@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; **<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sorry, I was doing just what I sometimes dislike of our own users ;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The real problem I want to solve is associating console output from a<br/>\n&gt; running thread to a given test-case (for parallel runs).

It works for simple cases but with<br/>\n&gt; customized<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Runner-classes and new JUnit-features (e.g. the introduction of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; JUnit-Rules) the result is usually bad and it discourages the IDE users<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (i.e. the developers) from taking full advantage of JUnit!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; However, Maven (versions 2.0-2.2) and its Surefire-plugin has handled<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; JUnit-integration wonderfully, as far as I know, so your post worries<br/>\n&gt; me a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; little.
