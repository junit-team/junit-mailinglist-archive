The point here is building an entire set of test framework for testing this server would require tremendeous efforts and time. Which even if I achieve would not be that worthy as \n\n1. It would always have static lines around it.\n2. Productive result Vs. Man hour consumed would be very less.\n\nSo can you suggest me any other way to nail down the problem.\n\n\nThanks\nAvinash\n\n\n----- Original Message ----\nFrom: Lasse Koskela &lt;lasse.koskela@...&gt;\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSent: Monday, 18 December, 2006 3:07:05 PM\nSubject: Re: [junit] Test a remote server\n\nHi Avinash,\n\nOn 12/18/06, avinash anand &lt;avinash_anand@ yahoo.co. uk&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Now the problem is I want to write unit test cases on this testServer\n&gt; which is a Java code. Since the test suite will be written in eclipse\n&gt; IDE, how will it test the actuall testServer class which is running\n&gt; in the live enviroment.\n\nI feel I need to point out that what you&#39;re describing is not a unit\ntest but more of a functional test. Unit tests test a single object or\na small group of objects collaborating together. Unit tests don&#39;t\ninvolve running the whole system.\n\nYes, it&#39;s a question of vocabulary but vocabulary is important.\n\nNow, on to your problem...\n\nOn 12/18/06, avinash anand &lt;avinash_anand@ yahoo.co. uk&gt; wrote:\n&gt; There is a system which you install (a multi-box installation) Which\n&gt; has the ORB server as the parent one. Other servers are scattered\n&gt; over other machines. Now I write a test server and copy the binary\n&gt; of the test server in the BIN directory. With the help of Admin console\n&gt; I start my test server and perform various operation viz start the\n&gt; server, load configuration parameters. The actuall operation of\n&gt; server is totally dependent on other servers. When a request comes\n&gt; to this test server from say server1 it performs some operation e.g\n&gt; fetches some database records and then forward a responce to\n&gt; Server2. It is this ways the system operates.\n&gt;\n&gt; There is no way that this test server can be run independently.\n&gt; Neither there is any way to run this server from any IDE as all its\n&gt; inputs and behaviour are dependent on other servers and\n&gt; services which are Native code.\n\nWhy do you say that there is no way for the server to run\nindependently? Why cannot the server be deployed with a set of fake\nservers?\n\nLasse\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n___________________________________________________________ \nNow you can scan emails quickly with a reading pane.
