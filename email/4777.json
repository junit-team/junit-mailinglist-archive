These tests lean more towards being functional tests and<br/>\n&gt; rely on multiple failures being handled correctly. There have been<br/>\n&gt; several opinions on this list in support of multiple failures for<br/>\n&gt; functional tests.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What I would like to know is the reason TestCase inherits from Assert<br/>\n&gt; rather than delegates to it. If it delegated, we could subclass<br/>\n&gt; TestCase to handle multiple failures and still use Assert for DbC.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Regards,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; David<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --- In junit@y..., &quot;kentlbeck&quot; &lt;kentbeck@c...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;&gt; When I&#39;ve wished for multiple failures to be recorded in my tests,<br/>\n&gt; my<br/>\n&gt;&gt; tests were always too big. Splitting up the tests gave me more<br/>\n&gt;&gt; satisfactory tests, and pinpointed errors.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; If you want multiple failures, it sounds like you want a different<br/>\n&gt;&gt; mechanism than fail().<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; The advantage of having the methods be static is that you can do<br/>\n&gt; DbC<br/>\n&gt;&gt; and have pre-/post-condition failures reported like all other JUnit<br/>\n&gt;&gt; failures.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Kent<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
