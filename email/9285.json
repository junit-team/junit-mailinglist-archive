However I am still not convinced how <br/>\n&gt; would one apply these in large systems.  In particular, in compilers and related topics.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; A concrete instance would be an analysis that works on say some IR. The analysis can usually be cast as a single class and the <br/>\n&gt; test of the &quot;unit&quot; is that each of the methods function as specified in the given scenarios.  The analysis works on the <br/>\n&gt; intermediate representation (IR) of a program.  The IR is dependent on the input program/source code.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; To test the analysis class you need to provide it an IR which means we need the whole machinery to setup the IR on which the <br/>\n&gt; analysis works and then drive the analysis with the test object while probing it correctness.  Generally, the machinery to <br/>\n&gt; setup the IR is complex or large.  So, would one code that up into the test case?  If so, at what cost?  A more simple <br/>\n&gt; question would be that how much effort should go into setting up the environment for object to be tested and test object <br/>\n&gt; itself?  Also, say if the analysis provides information say relation between 2 entities in the IR, then how do you test for <br/>\n&gt; this relation while unit testing the analysis (may be this is into another form of testing but anyways...)?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; For people who have read &quot;Unit Testing in Java&quot; the above is a case of Object Under Test scenario.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In simple words, if a chunk of logic embedded in a class requires large pieces of information to be setup, then how would one <br/>\n&gt; use JUnit or any unit testing framework in such cases?  Even more, when instances of such classes go through state changes <br/>\n&gt; depending on interaction with other objects how do you instrument the test and run the test?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The reason I am posting this question is that I have heard a lot about JUnit and how Unit Testing is the &quot;magic bullet&quot; (of <br/>\n&gt; course I have heard people say otherwise about the latter too).  However, I am not convinced as to if it is applicable in all <br/>\n&gt; situations and scenarios.  Even more, are there documents or studies that indicate the impact of Unit Testing on projects say <br/>\n&gt; in terms of shift in timelines, # of bugs, and such?  I am trying to find evidence of usage of JUnit is situations similar to <br/>\n&gt; ones explained above.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; waiting for reply,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; - Venkatesh<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Thanks for the reply guys.
