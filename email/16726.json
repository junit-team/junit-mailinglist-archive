I think I can use this<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; tomorrow.<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; --<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I just read the post on this little tool, so I haven&#39;t tried it yet,<br/>\n&gt; but it seems like it would be very helpful for mocking member objects<br/>\n&gt; created in a class. How do you refactor to eliminate a dependency on<br/>\n&gt; member objects. I understand how to do it with objects a class<br/>\n&gt; collaborates with, but it is a different matter when the member<br/>\n&gt; objects are &quot;owned&quot; by the object being tested. I guess you could<br/>\n&gt; provide the class with a factory class it could use to create it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; members, but this seems like a lot of overhead for an object that only<br/>\n&gt; needs this capability for testing purposes.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am a new java programmer, so forgive me if my terminology isn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; correct. Hopefully you can understand what I am trying to say.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I always question the idea of an object owning the lifecycle of another. <br/>\nThere are some cases where this is obviously a good design, such as when <br/>\none Value Object owns another Value Object. (Think a Customer object <br/>\nthat owns a MonetaryAmount object, representing that&#39;s Customer&#39;s <br/>\noutstanding balance.) Still, especially where Services are concerned, <br/>\nobjects should wire up to one another, rather than one Service owning <br/>\nthe lifecycle of another. In my opinion, only one object should own all <br/>\nthe lifecycles of all the Services in a system, and that&#39;s the Entry Point.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince you&#39;re a new Java programmer, you might not be familiar with Eric <br/>\nEvans&#39; work &quot;Domain Driven Design&quot;. If you are not, then I strongly <br/>\nrecommend you obtain a copy and read it, as it will help you understand <br/>\nwhy I think this way. Also, it will have positive influences on your design.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care.<br/>\n<br/>\nPS: This is worth writing about, so I think I&#39;ll do that on my weblog.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
