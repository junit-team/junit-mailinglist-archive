For example, a CalculatorEngine.java and\nCalculatorEngineTest.java (extended from TestCase) in parallel\ndirectories so that they&#39;re in the same package. When we we&#39;ve written a\nfew tests and find that some setup code is repeated in more than one test\nclass (often because it&#39;s setting up a mock database or file system) that\ngoes into something we call a XxxxTestUtility class - maybe\nOracleTestUtility.java.\n\nI&#39;m wondering if our TestUtility is what you&#39;re calling a fixture even\ntho it doesn&#39;t extend TestCase. This class will setup the sometimes\ncomplicated objects, often instantiating several objects and setting\ntheir state. It&#39;s methods are then called by the test classes that extend\nTestCase and are called in test suites. \n\nWe still have a one-to-one correspondence of test classes to production\nclasses which seems to help make sure that we test everything. And tells\nus where to look for code that tests a given class. If it matters, this\nproject was started a few years before we&#39;d heard of unit tests and long\nbefore test driven development reached us.\n\nOn Sat, 14 Dec 2002 16:55:56 -0500 &quot;J. B. Rainsberger&quot;\n&lt;jbr@...&gt; writes:\n&gt; So said  Steven Taschuk  on  2002-12-14 --------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;Quoth Dave Astels &lt;dave@...&gt;:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; TestCases and Classes being tested should have only coincedental\n&gt; &gt;&gt; correspondance.  A TestCase is the embodiment of a *fixture*... \n&gt; a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; specific context in which tests are run.  As such it should \n&gt; contain\n&gt; &gt;&gt; only those tests (i.e. test methods) which run in the context of \n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; fixture that the TestCase embodies.\n&gt; &gt;  [...]\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;I entirely agree that TestCases are (despite the name) intended to\n&gt; &gt;represent fixtures, and that mindlessly creating one TestCase per\n&gt; &gt;class under test is a Bad Thing.  Your example in a subsequent\n&gt; &gt;post of separate TestCases for a list implementation illustrates\n&gt; &gt;the point quite nicely.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;However, I think there are cases in which it is sensible to have\n&gt; &gt;one TestCase for one class.  For example, suppose we have a\n&gt; &gt;Comparator which sorts Integers lexicographically according to\n&gt; &gt;their written-out forms in English.  The class has no internal\n&gt; &gt;state; all instances are equivalent.\n&gt; \n&gt; Certainly: if there is no commonality of setup, then there may be \n&gt; no\n&gt; motivation whatever to separate test methods into many test cases.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;We might take the view that, when a TestCase is closely tied to a\n&gt; &gt;single class this way, the fixture under test consists simply of\n&gt; &gt;the class itself (rather than an instance with some specific\n&gt; &gt;state).  If there is nothing else in common among the test\n&gt; &gt;methods, it is not unreasonable to leave them all in the same\n&gt; &gt;TestCase, rather than, say, putting each in its own TestCase.\n&gt; \n&gt; I can find no argument against this.\n&gt; \n&gt; J.
