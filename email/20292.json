This entry might be a good place to start:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://junit.sourceforge.net/doc/faq/faq.htm#tests_15\">http://junit.sourceforge.net/doc/faq/faq.htm#tests_15</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; There are many good pieces of information in the FAQ and I suggest<br/>\n&gt; reading it carefully.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Definitely, and started there first!  It gave me some really good <br/>\npointers and make me rethink some of my strategy!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; The best thing with JUnit testing is to think in terms of <br/>\n </span></blockquote>behaviours.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; What behaviour are you expecting from your system and write a test <br/>\n </span></blockquote>for<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; that. Do not let the fact that some behaviours span multiple objects<br/>\n&gt; while others use only a single method cause you to lose sight of the<br/>\n&gt; fact that testing is best done at the unit level and the most <br/>\n </span></blockquote>workable<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; unit is the unit of behaviour.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You make an excellent point, and something I didn&#39;t realize.  I was <br/>\nthinking unit testing as &#39;test each method of my class&#39; and make sure <br/>\nthey work as expected.  But really, I&#39;m looking to test and see if my <br/>\napplication functionality (behaviour) works.  &quot;Can I create a report&quot; <br/>\nis what I&#39;m really after...<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again.</div>",
