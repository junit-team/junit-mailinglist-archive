Which is what I was objecting\n&gt; against, and also why I =\r\nmuch prefer calling it &quot;Test-Driven Development&quot;\n&gt; (and I still think that =\r\nit&#39;s something you should do whenever you can but\n&gt; you certainly don&#39;t nee=\r\nd to do it 100% of the time to obtain well-tested\n&gt; code).\n\nI know of few T=\r\nDD proponents that don&#39;t do some modicum of up-front  \ndesign. The amount I=\r\n&#39;ve found I need to do is small, and a lot of it  \nis in my head. What most=\r\n of us rail against is the notion that we need  \nto produce a complete, hig=\r\nhly detailed up-front design.\n\nYou&#39;re incorrectly assuming that TDD is just=\r\n about testing, or even  \ntesting+design, which its proponents suggest. Not=\r\n considering its  \nimpact on improving how to approach design (which can fe=\r\ned back in the  \nability to improve upon up-front design), if that&#39;s all we=\r\n got out of  \nit, TDDing 100% of the time would seem to be reasonably expen=\r\nsive.  \nParticularly for someone who was very good at designing, like yours=\r\nelf.\n\nWe also do a lot of &quot;after the fact&quot; design, i.e. we&#39;re continually  =\r\n\ntrying to stay cognizant of the design impacts of every few lines of  \ncod=\r\ne. We try to do something about it, as opposed to the crowd that  \npresumes=\r\n their up-front design is perfect.\n\nThe bigger thing TDD does is enable ref=\r\nactoring of code. Whether or  \nnot the design up front was good, the most s=\r\nignificant costs lie in  \nthe implementation and extended maintenance of th=\r\ne system. If you ever  \nget a chance to work on systems that are more than =\r\na couple years old,  \nand where business demands keep coming, you&#39;ll find t=\r\nhat&#39;s where the  \ntrue costs are. Most code out there is just bad, and high=\r\nly, highly  \nredundant.\n\nUnfortunately, it&#39;s very dangerous for programmers=\r\n to start guessing  \nwhere they don&#39;t need tests, particularly if they&#39;re n=\r\not as highly  \nskilled as you obviously are. They usually guess wrong. Lazi=\r\nness tends  \nto take control of this guessing game, and not enough tests ge=\r\nt  \nwritten. Maybe that&#39;s not so bad, if we have enough integration tests  =\r\n\n(most systems rarely do). But the bigger impact is that lack of tests  \nsi=\r\ngnificantly increases the risk of keeping the code clean, and the  \nsystem =\r\ntakes a much quicker route to complete degradation.\n\nTry working on a C++ s=\r\nystem like this that&#39;s been around 10 years,  \nthat takes an hour just to b=\r\nuild, and for which it takes hours to  \nfigure out where a simple chunk of =\r\ncode goes, and hours or days more  \nto figure out whether or not you&#39;ve bro=\r\nken something by making your  \nsimple change. Sweetly, and with great karma=\r\n, the defects often crop  \nup in the untested areas, where we thought we we=\r\nre too smart to have  \nneeded tests.\n\nI also get a lot of value out of test=\r\ns that programmers crafted with  \nthe intent to help me understand what the=\r\n classes are about. I&#39;ve had  \nopportunities to work with systems that were=\r\n comprehensively covered  \nwith unit tests. It&#39;s a breeze to find what you&#39;=\r\nre looking for in such  \na system, as opposed to the typical nightmare of n=\r\navigating through a  \nsystem in which no one considers the value that clean=\r\n tests can  \ncreate, and for which only poor, out-of-date written documents=\r\n exist.\n\nIf you&#39;re sold on the value of your level of investment in TDD, fi=\r\nne.  \nOthers have gotten far more out of it.\n\nJeff Langr\nhttp://langrsoft.c=\r\nom\n\n",
