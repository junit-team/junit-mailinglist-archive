Or am I seeing something wrong? Or is\n&gt; &gt; it impossible to JUnit-test file creation?\n\nAre you creating the PDFs yourself or via a 3rd party library (eg. iText, Big \nFaceless)?\n\nIf the former, you really should have no problem in that you know what you are \nexpecting at least in the way of bytes that get written.  So, test that.  \nRefactoring to use streams would be a plus so that the tests don&#39;t actually \nwrite to disk.  I did this on a former project and it worked well.\n\nIf the latter, encapsulate (into another class) the logic that goes into \ndetermining what to write to the PDF and test that.  Leave the testing of \nproduced PDF to customer tests (which may be nothing more than having a \ncustomer view some actual PDFs and say &#39;Yea&#39; or &#39;Nay&#39;).  I did this on a \nformer project as well and it suited our needs.\n\n-- \nJason Rogers\n\n&quot;Where there is no vision, the people perish...&quot;\n    Proverbs 29:18\n\n",
