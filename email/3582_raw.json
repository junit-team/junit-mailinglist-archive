It also covers Ant and JMeter (a couple of essential Jakarta\nprojects). The book includes a case study in applying each framework to an\nonline pet store, and would serve as an excellent resource for anyone\nwishing to explore JUnit as well as several of it OS extensions.\n\nThe homepage for the book, including on-line source code is at:\n\nhttp://www.rickhightower.com/JavaXPToolkit/\n\nWe&#39;re working on getting a couple of sample chapters up for your perusal.\nThe book can be purchased directly from John Wiley at:\n\nhttp://www.wiley.com/Corporate/Website/Objects/Products/0,9049,1847817,00.ht\nml\n\nor Amazon.com at:\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/047120708X/qid=1008780346/sr=8-1/ref=\nsr_8_3_1/103-8597614-7170265\n\nSorry for this sounding like a plug--I mean it is, but I think the book\nwould be of legitimate interest to users of JUnit, both the readers of the\nmailing list and the viewers of the web-page. Part of our goal in writing it\nwas to generate publicity for the tools that have helped us so much.\n\nCheers,\n\nNick\n\n\n",
