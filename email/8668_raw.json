I clicked the &#39;...&#39; next to\nTest class name input field and got the following\nerror message \n&quot;No Test Cases found. Check that the configured\n&#39;TestCollector&#39; is supported on this platform.\n\nShoot in the dark, do we need a java webstart aware subclass of\nTestCollector? Depending on how much research is\nrequired, perhaps I can contribute this.\n\nAnywhooos thanks for a great test framework and taking\ntime to answer my question,\nAustin\n\nPS you can browse all source code throughsa\nhttp://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/pho\ntoshowoff/photoshowoff/\n\njava webstart -- http://java.sun.com/products/javawebstart/ basically\nallows 1 click deployment of java applications with some sandbox\nrestrictions.\n\n\n",
