Of what use are private methods?\n        It would appear for the sake of testing that while fields may\n        be private, methods should never be.\n\n   b.) Who will be affected if every private method becomes\n         package-private? Do large-scale packages exist in which\n         individual developers publish the package-private APIs for\n         the class or two they work on, so that other package-\n         developers can use them?\n\n         Or is it the case that the distinction between private and\n         package-private was a nice idea in theory, but it never had\n         much practical use, so blurring the distinction between them\n         makes excellent sense?\n\nHenry Stapp wrote:\n\n&gt; The &#39;how to test private methods&#39; question (see below) came up on the\n&gt; NUnit\n&gt; group, and I thought some TDD gurus here might be able to help out.\n&gt; Sorry if\n&gt; this has already been rehashed a hundred times, but I was wrestling\n&gt; with\n&gt; this a lot myself, and despite reading the Wiki threads on this, I\n&gt; still\n&gt; don&#39;t have a good &#39;pattern&#39; to use...\n&gt;\n&gt; The example from my case was a class, KeyAuthenticator, with a method\n&gt; Validate(). Validate calls several internal methods to check\n&gt; hashcodes,\n&gt; timestamps, etc. but the client shouldn&#39;t really need to know about\n&gt; any of\n&gt; that. The problem was that the methods for checking hashcodes and\n&gt; timestamps\n&gt; were the parts that needed the most testing...\n&gt;\n&gt; public class KeyAuthenticator {\n&gt;       //... instance variables etc...\n&gt;       public bool Validate() {\n&gt;             if (!CheckTimestamp()) return false;\n&gt;             if (!CheckHash()) return false;\n&gt;             return true;\n&gt;       }\n&gt;\n&gt;       private bool CheckTimestamp() {\n&gt;             //... timestamp math\n&gt;       }\n&gt;\n&gt;       private bool CheckHash() {\n&gt;             //... MD5 hash comparison\n&gt;       }\n&gt;\n&gt; }\n&gt;\n&gt; Leaving out the backdoor reflection approach for the moment, the\n&gt; choices\n&gt; seemed to be:\n&gt;\n&gt; 1) &quot;pollute&quot; the interface by making methods public that should be\n&gt; private.\n&gt; Some argue that this is the correct thing to do, but generally\n&gt; accepted\n&gt; principles of good design seem to require making your public interface\n&gt; as\n&gt; minimal as possible.\n&gt;\n&gt; 2) Only test the public interface, perhaps giving up detailed testing\n&gt; of\n&gt; internal logic.\n&gt; The argument for this is that if the internal logic can&#39;t be easily\n&gt; tested\n&gt; through exercising the public API, then you should theoretically be\n&gt; able to\n&gt; get rid of all the &#39;untestable&#39; code, since it can&#39;t ever be\n&gt; reached...\n&gt; Somehow to me (as an admitted TDD newbie), it just seemed better to be\n&gt; able\n&gt; to bang on these internal methods directly, rather than relying on the\n&gt;\n&gt; public methods to access them. It seems easier and cleaner to test a\n&gt; method\n&gt; in isolation than to try to test it only via it&#39;s caller...\n&gt;\n&gt; 3) Make more classes... change the private methods into public methods\n&gt; of\n&gt; new simple classes.\n&gt; To use the example above, I could create a &#39;KeyHash&#39; class and a\n&gt; &#39;KeyTimestamp&#39; class, then have each of these expose public methods...\n&gt;\n&gt; perhaps this is the best refactoring, but it seemed to me to cause a\n&gt; profusion of one-method classes...\n&gt;\n&gt; 4) Make the methods &#39;protected&#39;, have your Test class inherit from\n&gt; your\n&gt; class under test.\n&gt; This does work, however having a bunch of protected methods in your\n&gt; class\n&gt; interface could give the impression to future users that the class was\n&gt;\n&gt; designed to be inherited from, which is not really true in this\n&gt; case...\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;d love to hear the group&#39;s thoughts...\n\n\n\n",
