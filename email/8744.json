However, at some<br/>\n&gt; points in the past I have been obligated to use class<br/>\n&gt; libraries that write to System.out, and which I cannot<br/>\n&gt; change.  So, to test code that uses these libraries, I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; found that I get a lot of mileage out of creating a little<br/>\n&gt; &quot;ConsoleTester&quot; helper class, which appears below.  The basic<br/>\n&gt; idea is, in my unit test I create a ConsoleTester, then<br/>\n&gt; exercise the code I want to test, then get the output that<br/>\n&gt; was written to System.out from the ConsoleTester and make assertions<br/>\n&gt; about it. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Again, please do not misunderstand:  I don&#39;t like this<br/>\n&gt; approach.  In my own code, I do not write to System.out, and<br/>\n&gt; I recommend that others avoid doing so as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>We once had the requirement that there is *no* output on the console<br/>\n(but there was). We used a similar approach to write a failing test and<br/>\nthen replaced all System.out&#39;s with logging until the test passed...<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards, Ilja</div>",
