The simplest solution \nwould be to use a class-level variable on your TestCase class.\n\nPlease note two things, though:\n\n1. By default, you don&#39;t have control over the order in which tests are \nexecuted, so it could be that the &quot;reading&quot; test is executing before the \n&quot;writing&quot; test. If you want this control, I recommend using GSBase&#39;s \nOrderedTestSuite to control the order of some of your tests.\n\n2. The desire to share data between tests (meaning that one test writes \nto a variable and another test reads it) goes against the basic \nphilosophy of JUnit and the xUnit frameworks. They were designed so that \ntests would be /isolated/ from one another, because there are all kinds \nof benefits from keeping tests isolated. To learn more about this, look \nat the books _JUnit Recipes_ and _Test-Driven Development: By Example_, \namong others.\n-- \nJ. B.
