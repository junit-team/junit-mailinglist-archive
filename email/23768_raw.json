It lets you create tests like this:\n\n@RunWith(PerfR=\r\nunner.class)\npublic class MultiThreadUsageExampleTest {\n\n  @Test\n  public v=\r\noid demonstrationTest(\n      @Varying(from=3D1, to=3D10) int threadCount,\n =\r\n     @Varying(from=3D100000, to=3D1000000, step=3D100000) int entryCount) {=\r\n\n\n      // code here that relies on threadCount and entryCount\n  }\n\n}\n\nIn t=\r\nhe above example, my runner calls demonstrationTest() 100 times, with param=\r\neter values (1, 100000), (2, 100000), ... (1, 200000), ... (10, 1000000).\n\n=\r\nWhat I want to do now is produce charts of how long each call took. There a=\r\nre a lot of approaches, but I don&#39;t know which is &quot;right.&quot;\n\n1. Register a T=\r\nestListener and write my own reports to disk from it (but is there a generi=\r\nc way to register listeners?)\n2. Create my own main program that runs the t=\r\nest suite, and have it create the report when the suite is done (maybe this=\r\n is the only way to register a TestListener anyhow?)\n3. Transform the XML o=\r\nutput of the ant junit task (but then it&#39;s bound to Ant)\n4. Transform the X=\r\nML output of the maven-surefure-plugin (but then it&#39;s bound to Maven)\n5. Wr=\r\nite performance results to disk directly from my TestRunner (should work in=\r\n any environment, but feels like a dirty approach)\n\nOther ideas are welcome=\r\n too, of course. My test runner is open source and published on GitHub; I w=\r\nant a solution that can work for everyone. So I think ideas 3 and 4 are out=\r\n.\n\nHas anyone else thought about getting data from custom test runners into=\r\n human-readable reports?\n\n-Jonathan\n\n\n",
