We wrapped it. Yes, we had system tests, but in order to test\n&gt;  &gt; our logic independently, we pretty much had to wrap it.\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t want the tests to be independent of the libraries they depend\n&gt; on. I want them to depend on exactly what the code depends on: no more;\n&gt; no less. That way you find bugs in the boundaries between model classes\n&gt; and libraries as well as in the model classes and libraries themselves.\n\nI find this statement curious. Let me explore a specific example: JDBC.\n\nJDBC consists of a generic API, mostly interfaces, and vendors implement \nthose interfaces. The idea is that, at least in the broad strokes, \ndifferent JDBC drivers implement the same basic concepts the same way \n(setting prepared statement parameters, getting connections, that kind \nof thing... differences in SQL are another story altogether).\n\nNow if I want to know whether I&#39;m using the JDBC API properly, it seems \nto be that testing against one vendor&#39;s implementation has the \nlimitation of assuming that the vendor has implemented the JDBC \ninterfaces properly. If I write a test against my code (using their JDBC \ndriver) and the test fails, where is the defect? In my code? In theirs? \nHunting that defect down takes time.\n\nConsider an alternative: I write interaction tests for my code that mock \nthe JDBC interfaces, based on commonly-accepted understanding of how the \nJDBC interface methods behave. Again, I&#39;m assuming that the vendor \nimplements the interfaces correctly; however, I also write a Contract \nTest that checks whether the JDBC driver indeed implements the interface \ncorrectly. When I write a test against my code and the test fails, the \ndefect is certainly in my code, because I&#39;m incorrectly using the JDBC \ninterfaces. When a Contract Test for the vendor&#39;s JDBC driver fails, the \ndefect is certainly in the vendor&#39;s driver. There is no need to look \nfurther.\n\nGiven that my project&#39;s System Tests will check our use of JDBC and our \nvendor&#39;s driver in the context of realistic business transactions, I see \nno need to duplicate that effort in my object tests.\n-- \nJ.
