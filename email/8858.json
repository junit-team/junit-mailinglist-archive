When I shared this situation and<br/>\nmy different ideas of how to deal with it, the suggestions I got all<br/>\ncentered on one method of handling it: abstract the unmanageable behind<br/>\ninterfaces and run my tests using a MockObject implementation of those<br/>\ninterfaces. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn your case is the mainframe specific code abstracted out of the<br/>\ntestable functionality?  If so you can test using a Mock implementation<br/>\nof the mainframe.  The other side someone else already suggested which<br/>\nis to ensure that the generated batch code matches known good examples. <br/>\nSimply set up the fake data which would generate one of  your known good<br/>\nexamples, and run the code in a unit test and check the output in the<br/>\ntestFunction().<br/>\n<br/>\nGood Luck!<br/>\nI know it&#39;s not easy to do all of this in my job.  But it&#39;s worth it<br/>\nwhere you can.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nDavid Boyer &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mangr3n@...\">mangr3n@...</a>&gt;</div>",
