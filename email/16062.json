Rainsberger changed the world a bit at a time by saying (astral date: 2/10/2006 4:49 AM) :#<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Cédric Beust ♔ wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt;    - Using debuggers less might be a good thing *if* the developers find<br/>\n&gt;&gt;    bugs faster.  I have seen quite a few TDD enthusiasts choose not to use<br/>\n&gt;&gt;    debuggers for dogmatic reasons (&quot;because I read it in a book&quot;) and then<br/>\n&gt;&gt;    spend hours writing tests or even println&#39;s trying to reproduce a <br/>\n&gt;&gt; mysterious<br/>\n&gt;&gt;    bug that a breakpoint would have caught in a few minutes.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; While I agree with your overall point, I&#39;m surprised by this. If a <br/>\n&gt; debugger could have found the problem in a few minutes, then why did it <br/>\n&gt; take hours to write the tests? If I have to write 1 test per frame of <br/>\n&gt; the stack trace, that&#39;s maybe 15-20 tests.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Now, if it takes hours to write 20 tests, then they must not be very <br/>\n&gt; good TDD practitioners; and if they&#39;re good TDD practitioners, then the <br/>\n&gt; code is easy to test and it wouldn&#39;t take hours to write 20 of them.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My general approach is this:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 1. Reason about the problem. Try to write 2-3 tests.<br/>\n&gt; 2. If #1 doesn&#39;t find the problem, launch the debugger and step until we <br/>\n&gt; find the frame of the stack where the problem occurs.<br/>\n&gt; 3. Find the values of the input to that method, then drop out of the <br/>\n&gt; debugger and write the test. It fails.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Voila. As you say, a /good/ marriage between debugger and tests.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I tend to agree with the this approach, but I use it quite in the other order:<br/>\n- reason about the problem; set some breakpoints; fire debugger; find the stack where the problem occurs<br/>\n- write the test =&gt; fails<br/>\n- fix the code =&gt; test passes<br/>\n<br/>\nI have tried both approaches, and for me (I underline this) it worked better.<br/>\n<br/>\n./alex<br/>\n--<br/>\n.w( the_mindstorm )p.</div>",
