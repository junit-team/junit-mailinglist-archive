There&#39;s some functionality I had built for myself in the land of\n&gt;&gt; JUnit 3, and I&#39;m trying to figure out how best to replicate it in JUnit\n&gt;&gt; 4. Let me explain it in two parts.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The first part is something that finds all my tests (by walking the\n&gt;&gt; filesystem) and then runs them.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The second part is a way for me to segregate different sorts of tests so\n&gt;&gt; that I can run them conditionally. I previously used annotations,\n&gt;&gt; including something akin to the @Ignore annotation that I&#39;m pleased to\n&gt;&gt; see is now included. I also had something like @Category(&quot;slow&quot;), which\n&gt;&gt; allowed me to kick slow tests out of the common target that developers run.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; For the first part, I found this chunk of code, so I didn&#39;t have to\n&gt;&gt; write that myself:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; http://burtbeckwith.com/blog/?p=52\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; But now that I&#39;m looking to add the second part to it, it seems awkward\n&gt;&gt; enough that I wonder if I&#39;m going about it wrong.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Within this structure, it looks like I could use per-class annotations\n&gt;&gt; to kick entire classes out of the set of tests to run. But is there a\n&gt;&gt; reasonable way I could use annotations on individual methods to include\n&gt;&gt; or exclude them from the set of tests to run?\n&gt;\n&gt; Since Cedric seems to be very quiet on this list these days, let me\n&gt; say that TestNG supports this [1]. I don&#39;t think I can point at JUnit\n&gt; and say that it offers the same granularity to control which tests\n&gt; run? Is it simple to do with a Custom Runner / Interceptor?\n&gt;\n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt;\n&gt; James\n&gt;\n\nDamn, missed the link!\n\n[1] http://testng.org/doc/documentation-main.html#test-groups\n\n",
