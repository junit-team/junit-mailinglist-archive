The full version <br/>\ncan be run automatically and repeatedly on a build server.

My slowest tests mostly involve <br/>\nnetwork connections and web servers. For that, I either put up with the <br/>\nslowness or subset the tests as described above. I suppose I could build <br/>\n  a web server into my test suite, but honestly that&#39;s never been the <br/>\nsimplest thing that could possibly work for me. :-) If it ever becomes a <br/>\nmajor problem, I might consider it.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n﻿Elliotte Rusty Harold  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:elharo@...\">elharo@...</a><br/>\nJava I/O 2nd Edition Just Published!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafeaulait.org/books/javaio2/\">http://www.cafeaulait.org/books/javaio2/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596527500/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/\">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596527500/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/</a></div>",
