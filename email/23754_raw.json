The next =\r\nrelease of ScalaTest, version 2.0, will include enhancements to support IDE=\r\n integration, and before releasing 2.0 we&#39;re going to help do the actual in=\r\ntegration work for Eclipse, IDEA, and NetBeans. That way we can be sure we =\r\nhave it right before releasing the ScalaTest enhancements. I would like you=\r\nr feedback on it. I&#39;ll post announcements of preview snapshots on the scala=\r\ntest-users mailing list, so please join that if you&#39;d like to give input.\n\n=\r\nThanks.\n\nBill\n----\nBill Venners\nArtima, Inc.\nhttp://www.artima.com\n\nOn Nov =\r\n3, 2011, at 5:50 AM, Matthew Farwell &lt;matthew@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; Hi,\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m interested in this, though for slightly different reasons, maybe w=\r\ne\n&gt; could exchange ideas on this. I haven&#39;t exactly thought this through in=\r\n\n&gt; detail, but I think my requirements come down to being able to store\n&gt; a=\r\nrbitrary information in a Description, a key.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m interesting in testi=\r\nng with Scala, and there are (at least) two generic\n&gt; problems:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) Tes=\r\nts which are not linked to a specific method, but are run as separate\n&gt; tes=\r\nts. Scalatest for example allows the following\n&gt; \n&gt; @RunWith(classOf[JUnitR=\r\nunner])\n&gt; class FileSpec extends FlatSpec with ShouldMatchers {\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;A Sta=\r\nck&quot; should &quot;pop values in last-in-first-out order&quot; in {\n&gt; }\n&gt; \n&gt; it should =\r\n&quot;throw NoSuchElementException if an empty stack is popped&quot; in {\n&gt; }\n&gt; }\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; This creates a single method with the two tests within. However, the\n&gt; JU=\r\nnitRunner runs the single method but records the two tests separately.\n&gt; Th=\r\nis can be seen in Eclipse, see attached scalatest1.png. Now if I double\n&gt; c=\r\nlick on the test name in the junit view, it tries to find a method of that\n=\r\n&gt; name, and fails. Obviously, to correct this would require a fix to Eclips=\r\ne,\n&gt; but if I could store the file & line number instead of the method name=\r\n, I\n&gt; could jump to the appropriate line.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2) Scala allows spaces and o=\r\nther characters in method names, but these\n&gt; names are munged on compilatio=\r\nn. For instance, space gets translated to\n&gt; $0020.\n&gt; \n&gt; class FileTest exte=\r\nnds AssertionsForJUnit {\n&gt; @Test def `foo bar`() =3D {\n&gt; \n&gt; }\n&gt; }\n&gt; \n&gt; Here=\r\n the jump to in Eclipse works correctly, but the displayed description\n&gt; in=\r\n Eclipse isn&#39;t nice, see scalatest2.png.\n&gt; \n&gt; So in both cases, the string =\r\nI would like to display (in Eclipse, surefire\n&gt; whatever) doesn&#39;t match the=\r\n method name, either because there is no method\n&gt; name or because It&#39;s not =\r\nthe same thing. I think that I could work around\n&gt; most issues is Eclipse e=\r\ntc if the test runner could add some arbitrary\n&gt; information to the descrip=\r\ntion, which it could subsequently use. A string\n&gt; would be fine, because I =\r\ncould define the contents of that String, but\n&gt; arbitrary data would be eve=\r\nn better. String would be simpler for everyone I\n&gt; think.\n&gt; \n&gt; Please note =\r\nthat I&#39;m just thinking aloud at the minute, and I haven&#39;t\n&gt; actually done a=\r\nny proof of concepts as yet, but if you have any ideas,\n&gt; please feel free =\r\nto take this to email.\n&gt; \n&gt; Matthew Farwell.\n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of thi=\r\ns message have been removed]\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message hav=\r\ne been removed]\n\n\n",
