We did indicate that<br/>\n100% passing unit tests were part of our development <br/>\nmethodology but that&#39;s as far as it went. OTOH, we ran<br/>\nfull system acceptance tests manually and provided reports <br/>\nof them to the FDA in reproducible form - that is all<br/>\nthe inputs and outputs specified as the O.P. wants <br/>\nto do with a log. Reproducible is a watchword in this<br/>\nindustry.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve heard of people automating these acceptance tests<br/>\nwith FIT - in fact I know Ward did it for some clients.<br/>\nNote however that these are a different sort of <br/>\n&quot;acceptance tests&quot; from those we talk about in XP. In<br/>\nfact, with one company, I had to come up with a <br/>\ndifferent name for XP-style acceptance tests, since<br/>\n&quot;we have no authority to accept anything.&quot; :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems to me that making unit test results available<br/>\non anything but an audit basis will lead to a lot of<br/>\nproject overhead. In many companies, the developers<br/>\nhave little influence over the promises made to the<br/>\nFDA as part of a certification plan, so it may turn<br/>\nout to be necessary to do it at this level. But if<br/>\nyou can influence it to only turn over system,<br/>\nacceptance or integration tests, life may be easier.<br/>\n<br/>\nCharlie<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>] On <br/>\n&gt; Behalf Of David Saff<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, March 12, 2009 7:06 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [junit] Re: A case for adding logging of <br/>\n&gt; assertions to junit<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If anyone has direct experience on the FDA requirement in <br/>\n&gt; question, and it&#39;s direct application to unit testing, I&#39;d <br/>\n&gt; certainly love to hear more.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;    David Saff<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On Wed, Mar 11, 2009 at 3:16 PM, Gilles Scokart <br/>\n&gt; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:gscokart@...\">gscokart@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I was about to ask if it wouldn&#39;t it be suffisent to have a report <br/>\n&gt; &gt; with only Pass/Failure stored with the sources of the test (without <br/>\n&gt; &gt; which &quot;Smith&quot; = &quot;Smith&quot; in a report doesn&#39;t have any meaning).<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; But actually I found one utility.  By tracing every <br/>\n&gt; assertion that is <br/>\n&gt; &gt; checked, you can validate that the assertion that are written into <br/>\n&gt; &gt; your test are really executed, and that there is no bug in <br/>\n&gt; your unit <br/>\n&gt; &gt; test that make the assertion skipped silently.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; If that&#39;s the reason for such report, maybe you can suggest <br/>\n&gt; that the <br/>\n&gt; &gt; report is :<br/>\n&gt; &gt; - Test ID Status<br/>\n&gt; &gt; - Source code<br/>\n&gt; &gt; - code coverage report of your unit test<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; But it is true that with regulations and laws, you can hardly argue <br/>\n&gt; &gt; anything...<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Gilles Scokart<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 2009/3/11 rsgmxw &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:markwilhelm@...\">markwilhelm@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;   One thing about the &quot;logging of assertions&quot; is reporting on the <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Actual/Observed results. I work at a company that makes Medical <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Devices. The FDA, as we&#39;re told by QA, requires the <br/>\n&gt; deposition of all <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; tests. So even Pass&#39;ing tests must have their actual <br/>\n&gt; results reported <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; on. We do this currently with manual/human tests.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; If the report could say something like:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Test ID Status Expected Actual<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; 123 Pass Smith Smith<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; 456 Pass Value &gt; 10 12<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; 789 Fail Value = &quot;abc&quot; xyz<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; ...<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; This report would be stored (for many years) for audit purposes.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Now being a newbie, maybe there is a way to do this I don&#39;t know <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; about - but very useful.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Mark<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a> &lt;junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt;, <br/>\n&gt; &quot;toalexsmail&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &lt;toalexsmail@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a> &lt;junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt;, Robert <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Wenner<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &lt;robert.wenner@&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; On Monday 09 June 2008 21:18, Cédric Beust wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If I have to go through umpteen thousand lines of <br/>\n&gt; log, I may <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; as<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; well<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; test everything manually.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nobody says you have to, but the fact that your tests pass <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t guarantee that you are testing what you <br/>\n&gt; think you are testing.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Well. If the log is important, I have to go through <br/>\n&gt; it, or I miss <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; something important. If it is not important (and I <br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t have to <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; go through it) I can skip it altogether. So what do <br/>\n&gt; you mean when <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; you<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; say I<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; don&#39;t have to go through it?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I have read carefully all the posts so far and I tend to <br/>\n&gt; agree with <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Robert. I am wonder whether I miss something important too.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I want to be clear, so I will take one step backward. <br/>\n&gt; What is the <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; MAIN purpose of JUnit? The answer is to be able to write <br/>\n&gt; AUTOMATIC <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; unit test. Unit test should be written is the correct <br/>\n&gt; way, that is <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; correctly design. This has nothing to do with logging. <br/>\n&gt; Making unit <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; test AUTOMATIC contradict using logging.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;you can skip the this paragraph&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I want to step aside for a while. Let assume that you&#39;re <br/>\n&gt; not using <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; JUnit at all and write small main function to test. I <br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t want to <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; counter why you shouldn&#39;t do this, let focus on what <br/>\n&gt; tools you do <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; use in this approach. In the most cases you will add System.out <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; both to the code and to the main. If you&#39;re using C++, for <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; instance, you will use preprocessor to switch on or off these <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; output to the console. More advance option will be to <br/>\n&gt; use logging <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; mechanism and to change it configuration depends on the <br/>\n&gt; environment <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; your program run (that is to turn on many of your log statement <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; only in development). Everything is great until your program is <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; actually fails. Again, from the experience it is almost <br/>\n&gt; always the <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; case that existing System.outs are not enough, that you <br/>\n&gt; need more <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; information or you should add some more output early in <br/>\n&gt; the code. <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; So, in this point you have to option to run your program <br/>\n&gt; AGAIN with <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; debugger or to add more System.outs and to run it as is. In both <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; cases it can be the case that you should rerun your <br/>\n&gt; program again <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; (if you use debugger you could simply not pointed out when some <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; data changed and in the System.out case you can figure <br/>\n&gt; out that you need more System.outs).<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; From the paragraph above one should conclude that when one write <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; unit test there is 2 different phases. First is to write <br/>\n&gt; them down <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; in the hope that everything will be ok (it doesn&#39;t mean, <br/>\n&gt; that you <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; design should be poor or you shouldn&#39;t supply <br/>\n&gt; appropriate messages <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; to assert statements etc) and the second phase is to rerun your <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; test if your test fails. Lets see how logging will help you.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; In the first phase I see the only purpose using logs is <br/>\n&gt; for &#39;sanity <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; check&#39; that is to ensure that you actually test what <br/>\n&gt; your think is <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; you test. If you want to make something more than just &#39;sanity <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; check&#39; you should write unit test to your unit test, <br/>\n&gt; that is pretty silly.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Moreover, you need to make such &#39;sanity check&#39; only when you <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; actually write this test. For this purpose logging is <br/>\n&gt; appropriate approach, IMHO.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; In the second phase, when you rerun your unit test when <br/>\n&gt; it fails, <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; you should consider to add more assert statement and <br/>\n&gt; more clearly <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; diagnostic messages first. When you done and you don&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; see how to <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; improve the design (recall I consider that design is <br/>\n&gt; correct) you <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; can add log statement manually. But in this case they <br/>\n&gt; will not be <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; part of new mechanism, because no more asserts will be added. So <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; this new feature will not be in use!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Using logging in the assert statement ONLY for &#39;sanity check&#39; is <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; overkill, I think. As for me I make such &#39;sanity check&#39; in the <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; following way. First of all, I use log4j MANUALLY that is as <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; addition to JUnit asserts. They don&#39;t duplicate what <br/>\n&gt; asserts does <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; they supply additional information, such as what assertion was <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; already done. In this case when assertion will fail afterwards I <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; can look on the log to see in what part of unit test it happened <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; and what tests passed. I go even further and use JDK 1.4 assert <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; statement to document precondition, postcondition and invariants <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; both in the code and in the unit test.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; The bottom line is that I see the sense using logs as a <br/>\n&gt; COMPLETION <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; to the JUnit and only for &#39;sanity check&#39;. This use is not <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; duplicates JUnit assert statements and could be written manually.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
