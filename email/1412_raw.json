A separate directory tree with a root note of test, the package\n&gt; structure of\n&gt;       which reflects that of the codebase; keep the tests completely\n&gt; isolated from\n&gt;       production code, the downside being that if I refactor code\n&gt; around packages,\n&gt;       I have to remember to move tests as well; also, removes my\n&gt; ability to test\n&gt;       private and protected methods..\n&gt; \n\nJust to clarify, classes within the same package can access each\nother&#39;s protected methods.  So, the limitation will only be on testing\nprivate methods with this approach.  Personally, I use this approach.\n\nMike\n\n=====\nMike Clark\nClarkware Consulting, Inc.\nCustom Software Architecture, Design, \nDevelopment, and Performance Consulting\nhttp://www.clarkware.com\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nGet personalized email addresses from Yahoo!
