Does Junit 4 still have them?)<br/>\nwith Junit. Other projects provide their own TestRunners - Eclipse, Ant etc.<br/>\npp. You could even rather easily write your own, if you needed to.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; JUnit can test only standalone projects.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t understand this at all. What do you mean by &quot;standalone projects&quot;,<br/>\nwhat other projects are there and why couldn&#39;t you use Junit to test them?<br/>\n<br/>\nCurious, Ilja</div>",
