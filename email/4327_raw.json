If you test your public _and_ protected methods, you&#39;re \nsimply &quot;overtesting&quot; your class (writing more tests than strictly \nnecessary).  It&#39;s up to you to decide if you need these tests.\n\nI like the idea of letting the user decide if he/she wants to test the \nprotected methods or not.  Sometimes it&#39;s useful, sometimes it&#39;s not, \nbut as I don&#39;t know anything about your classes, I prefer not to impose \nsuch rules.\n\n &gt; If your public methods work, doesn&#39;t that imply that the \nprivate/protected\n\n&gt; methods also work?\n\n\nIt depends how well these tests cover you class&#39;s code.  Your test \nmethods may not cover 100% of the code and your class will still work \nfine.  If anther class extends this class and calls your \nprivate/protected methods with other arguments (and exercise code you \nhaven&#39;t tested), your class _may_ not work properly anymore.\n\nYou can find arguments for not testing public methods and for testing \nthem.  The goal is to find bugs as early as possible (and not to write \ntests).  If you&#39;re confident that you write clean code by only testing \nthe public methods, fine.  Other developers prefer to test public and \nprotected methods.\n\nIt&#39;s a matter of confidence\n\n-Vladimir\n\n-- \nVladimir Bossicard\nwww.bossicard.com\n\n\n",
