I then compiled TestTest <br/>\nand ProxyTestSuite using the provided jars and ran TestTest. My <br/>\nproblem is that I don&#39;t seem to be able to get testSharing() to <br/>\nshare. The initial value of sharing is false. Enter the first round <br/>\nof testSharing(), the assertion is confirmed and sharing is set to <br/>\ntrue. Enter the second testSharing(), the value is false again, as <br/>\nwould be expected with the plain vanilla JUnit.<br/>\n<br/>\nCan someone point me to the correct path?<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards,<br/>\nRichard</div>",
