Definitely.\n\nBut probably NOT within my desired effort level. ;-)\n\n  &gt;BUT. As I\n  &gt;refactor, as code grows, the suites (being separate from the tests) are .\n  &gt;but that seems a level of manual effort/management that is counter\n  &gt;productive -- and hence counter testing. IMHO anything that can be better\n  &gt;done by a computer ought be done by a computer.\n\n  Maintaining test suites is not counterproductive if you have a need to\nmaintain test suites. If you need to maintain test suites to do your work,\nthen maintaining test suites is, by definition, productive.\n\nWe are failing to communicate. Either I am wrong and stubbornly failing to\nsee your point (not impossible), or I am not explaining my issues w/ suites\nwell enough...\n\nI agree that suites are a way to group tests and manage test group\nhierarchy, however they aren&#39;t (IMHO) a good tool for managing test\nhierarchies. Arrogant as that statement sounds, I honestly wonder if there\nis &quot;a better way&quot; [for my use case, and hopefully for others]. I guess I\nfigure that if there is an easier way for developers to maintain test\ndependencies, one that improves test results failure analysis, then testing\nwill be more effective/efficient. That seems nicely &quot;test infecting&quot; and\nhence junit-like, to me.\n\nSure, I may be re-inventing the wheel -- and dumbly thinking I have\nsomething new -- but I am attempting to pressure test that here. I&#39;m making\none more step at explaining (see next reply to yours below). Please keep an\nopen mind to this as an optional addition/alternative to suites. If you just\ncan&#39;t see it, then so be it. I think the problem with the example I&#39;ve given\nare that they are too small & simple. Perhaps the difference can&#39;t be\nexplained by simple example.\n\nIf the method I am proposing makes sense for a decent chunk of the user\ncommunity, and makes junit more productive for that use case, then I see it\nas a good alternative to test suites (which I feel are becoming obsolete by\ntest collectors). No reason why both couldn&#39;t be available.\n\n       I don&#39;t see how a computer can do what you&#39;re suggesting. If I\nunderstood     correctly, you want to identify tests that depend on one\nanother. What I suggested was a way to do that with what JUnit already\nprovides. Obviously, you can take that scheme, factor out a little engine\nand make it data-driven; but my point remains: it&#39;s not an addition to JUnit\nyou seek, but another way of building suites.\n\n\nI  believe I am saying/seeing a different between a human maintaining\ndisjointed groupings (suites) and a human maintaining simple assertions of\ndependency of a testcase on other testcases (or suites, I guess), and the\nengine (runner) calculating the dependency order. I guess I am describing a\ndeclarative mechanism (like ant) verses .. what would one call it ...\nprocedural?\n\n\n\n  &gt;What suite would I create?\n\n  I would create the suite I know I need. But then, I don&#39;t view integration\ntests by the objects they test: I view them by the features they support.\n\n\nMy examples were just simple ones. Dependency can be in the eye of the\nbeholder... :-)\n\n\n  &gt;I would like to be able to set X to depend upon Y/Z (almost a &quot;dynamic\n  &gt;suite&quot;) and set A on Y and Z\n\n  If *you* are setting it, then how is that different from what I suggest?\nEither a computer program determines the mapping, or you determine the\nmapping. How you EXPRESS the mapping is just a matter of implementation\ndetails. Start by maintaining the suite by hand, notice the patterns in the\nway you do things, then script it.\n\nDeclarative verses &quot;procedural&quot;.\n\nGak, why script it? That isn&#39;t going to fit into my eclipse, or ant tasks,\nusage w/o some pain. Some things aren&#39;t worth doing unless they are accepted\nby the core.\n\n\n  &gt;Is what I am discussing unreasonable? It seems an easy interface for\nusers,\n  &gt;and something that junit could manage behind the scenes.\n\n  I just don&#39;t think it&#39;s part of JUnit. It&#39;s a new Test Runner, perhaps.\nIt&#39;s a specialized Test Suite Builder. But the framework already supports\nwhat you want; someone just has to do the work of building it.\n\n\nWhy not? Suites serve a purpose, why couldn&#39;t declarative. I agree, it means\nchanges to the runner, but maybe that is warranted in this age of\nant/eclipse test collectors...\n\nregards\n\nAdam\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
