That means your code is broken (or just maybe the\n&gt; test is broken instead). Either way, fix the breakage, wherever it lies.\n&gt; Some of the other suggestions you&#39;ve gotten here are actively harmful\n&gt; and won&#39;t solve your problem (Making the private method public? Bleah.)\n\nI understand you don&#39;t believe in polluting the public API, but saying \nthat that suggestion won&#39;t solve the problem is ridiculous.\n\n1. Make the method public.\n2. Test it.\n3. Now that it&#39;s covered by tests, refactor until you reach a design \nwhere such an implementation detail either doesn&#39;t have to be public or \nmakes sense to be public. If needed, hide it behind an interface.\n\nHow doesn&#39;t that solve his problem?\n-- \nJ. B.
