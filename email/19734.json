To get a reference to RunNotifier, you&#39;ll<br/>\nneed to bypass JUnitCore and get straight to the Runner in your custom<br/>\nmain.  Take a look at JUnitCore.run(Runner) and let me know if that&#39;s<br/>\nhelpful.<br/>\n<br/>\nI assume your extension kept a persistent list of failed tests<br/>\nsomehow.  If so, you can use that in a Filter, comparing the names of<br/>\nthe failed tests to each method to decide which to run.<br/>\n<br/>\nSounds like interesting work--let me know how it goes.

I saw a thread here that<br/>\n&gt; showed a usage of RunNotifier.pleaseStop(), but I couldn&#39;t find a way<br/>\n&gt; to get a RunNotifier outside of a runner.<br/>\n&gt; Is there a way?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Also, it has a nice feature of resuming the last failed test. How can<br/>\n&gt; this be done in JUnit4?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks a lot,<br/>\n&gt; Aviv.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
