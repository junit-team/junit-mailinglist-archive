When these attributes are &quot;no&quot;, the\nlog4j output is captured by the &lt;junit&gt; task in the XML output as\nexpected.  When these attributes are &quot;yes&quot;, the log4j output is not\ncaptured, although direct output to System.out is.\n\nI can see where this attribute might effect the output, however, I\nwould imagine the effect being the opposite.  For example, when not\nforking a new JVM, I could see where the log4j loaded by JUnit would\nbe shared with the log4j loaded by ANT and there might be some\ninterference.  When the process is forked however, I do not see how\nthere would be a negative interaction.\n\nI&#39;d appreciate any enlightment :-)\n\nThanks,\nRay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
