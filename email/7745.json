What you do with those names afterward is totally up to the individual.<br/>\n<br/>\nWriting the TestListener is nothing. Attaching the TestListener to the TestRunner may take some work. I&#39;ve never actually done it. I would have to look at the code.<br/>\n<br/>\nI suppose you could have written your own TestRunner that instantiates the text runner, adds the listener, asks the text runner to run the tests, then processes the results from your listener. Is this what you did? If not, then what did you do?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;So said Katie Gerg on 4/15/2003 --------------------<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;m embarrassed to post it because I&#39;m really serious when I say I hacked<br/>\n&gt;it.  I have to get a suite of automated tests done by the end of this week<br/>\n&gt;so I did it without completely understanding junit but I knew what I wanted<br/>\n&gt;to get out of it.  The tests I need to run are highly specialized (they&#39;re<br/>\n&gt;the same with different inputs).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I wanted a list of test cases so I know what test cases I&#39;ve run against a<br/>\n&gt;build (hey I&#39;m a qa person, I have to know what&#39;s in there not only what<br/>\n&gt;failed - esp. from a test coverage perspective).  I also wanted it in a<br/>\n&gt;format anyone could easily view, so I store the test results in a vector<br/>\n&gt;that I dump out in an html format at the end (the location is hardcoded for<br/>\n&gt;now but it&#39;ll eventually come from a property file).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Anyway, I confronted the same issue you had with the listener so I made my<br/>\n&gt;own testresult object that the testcase class initializes and the listener<br/>\n&gt;grabs it from it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;ll send it to you but I don&#39;t think it fits into the junit way of<br/>\n&gt;thinking.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt;  From: Jesse Marlin [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jlm@...\">jlm@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt;  Sent: Tuesday, April 15, 2003 03:36 PM<br/>\n&gt;  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;  Subject: RE: [junit] Identify name of the TestCase<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  J.

Upload it to the file section. Get your<br/>\n&gt;name in lights.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  I agree.  I am having a difficult time finding substantive examples,<br/>\n&gt;  and am currently struggling with TestListener.  I don&#39;t understand<br/>\n&gt;  the relationship between a TestResult and a TestCase.  TestResult<br/>\n&gt;  actually has the addListener method which I need, but I am not sure<br/>\n&gt;  what to do to get a TestResult from the context of a TestCase.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;        Yahoo!
