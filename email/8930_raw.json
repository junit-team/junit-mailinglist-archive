I&#39;m not saying I&#39;m right, this is just what a quick look\n&gt; showed me. \n\nMhh, I don&#39;t know why the Ant developers decided to not use the\nTestSuite class. I do know that there are collectors out there which do.\n\n&gt; I guess there is a constant tussle between a pure framework\n&gt; and use case, but this feels like some sort of software\n&gt; evolution to me. I used to use suites, I used to use the\n&gt; Swing Runner, but now I use Eclipse and I&#39;ll never go back.\n\nI just tried the testcase collector of Eclipse and found that it simply\nis to slow for me. I am working on projects consisting of 1000+ classes\nand I don&#39;t want to wait several seconds every time I start the tests. I\nguess it would be similar for Ant - our Ant builds already take far too\nlong, using a collector probably wouldn&#39;t improve the situation.\n\n&gt; When does the new user case become the norm? When does the\n&gt; framework change to satisfy the new users?\n\nI still don&#39;t understand why the framework needs to change. Ant, Eclipse\nand other projects show very well that you can do what you want without\nneeding to change the framework.\n\nRegards, Ilja\n\n\n",
