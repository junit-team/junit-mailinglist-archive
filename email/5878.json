Any framework has a scope, and is an attempt to make<br/>\nit easy to do something within that scope.<br/>\nThe result of course is that IF you want to do something out of that scope,<br/>\nthe framework becomes a limitation.<br/>\nI never had to look into the source, did it just out of curiosity anyway,<br/>\nthough. And it probably is not very straightforward to understand. <br/>\nBut I suspect that the people who discovered Design Patterns/XP/Refactoring<br/>\nmight have some idea on Object Oriented design ;-)<br/>\nIf it doesn&#39;t work for me straight away, my first idea is to check if I<br/>\nunderstand how it should be used.<br/>\nBut I hate this attitude in particular: &quot;Junit internals suck. I would love<br/>\nto rewrite it, but don&#39;t have the time.&quot; No arguments, or concrete ideas,<br/>\njust complaining. <br/>\nCould he define the code smell &quot;the code sucks&quot; ?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Demyanovich, Craig - Apogent [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cdemyanovich@...\">cdemyanovich@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Subject: [junit] Do JUnit internals suck?!?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Below is a brief conversation that took place on another <br/>\n&gt; mailing list.  The<br/>\n&gt; original comment by DS was in response to another person&#39;s question<br/>\n&gt; regarding problems using JUnit for testing EJBs.  My text is <br/>\n&gt; marked with my<br/>\n&gt; initials, CD.  While I will take the advice of DS and have a <br/>\n&gt; look at the<br/>\n&gt; source, I wanted the group to have access to his opinion, to <br/>\n&gt; have feedback<br/>\n&gt; that could be used to make JUnit better for the next release.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; DS &gt; Junit internals suck. I would love to rewrite it, but don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; DS &gt; have the time.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; CD &gt; I&#39;ve been told before that the JUnit source code serves <br/>\n&gt; as a great <br/>\n&gt; CD &gt; example for writing good code.  Hence, your statement <br/>\n&gt; surprised me.  <br/>\n&gt; CD &gt; Since you&#39;re a respected developer of a great <br/>\n&gt; application server, I <br/>\n&gt; CD &gt; ask that you cite a few examples to support your statement.  I&#39;d <br/>\n&gt; CD &gt; really like to hear your side of the story.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; DS &gt; Read the source, and you will see what I am talking <br/>\n&gt; about.  I believe <br/>\n&gt; DS &gt; you misunderstood the comments from other people.  JUnit <br/>\n&gt; is a good <br/>\n&gt; DS &gt; example of successful software development and it is also a good<br/>\n&gt; example <br/>\n&gt; DS &gt; of XP development.  The problem with XP is that it is <br/>\n&gt; not designed for <br/>\n&gt; DS &gt; Library software (see the last chapter of the xp book), <br/>\n&gt; so it works<br/>\n&gt; good <br/>\n&gt; DS &gt; at what it was designed for, but it is difficult to <br/>\n&gt; expand.  They also <br/>\n&gt; DS &gt; use way too much inheritance and not enough interfaces.  <br/>\n&gt; Anyway, just <br/>\n&gt; DS &gt; read the code and be the judge for yourself.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;   &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Craig Demyanovich                      <br/>\n&gt; Systems Developer<br/>\n&gt; Apogent Technologies<br/>\n&gt; (269) 544 - 7514<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cdemyanovich@...\">cdemyanovich@...</a> <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
