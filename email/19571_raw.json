Would it handle your current situation?\n&gt; \n&gt; As Cedric pointed out, this only works if a test is a member of only one\n&gt; group. As so many others do, many of my tests are annotated to be in\n&gt; multiple groups. For instance, &quot;nightly&quot; and &quot;quick&quot; and &quot;bug&quot; meaning\n&gt; &quot;I want CruiseControl to run this test every night. Also, this test is\n&gt; quick (and is therefore suitable for our continuous build). Finally,\n&gt; this test illustrates a bug which is not yet fixed.&quot;\n\nThinking specifically about the annotations &quot;nightly&quot; and &quot;bug&quot;, I would \nrather have those tests in separate source trees from the &quot;normal&quot; \ntests. I should think that moving a test in and out of the nightly build \nis not done several times per day, so an annotation is more flexible \nthan necessary. Same for tests that can&#39;t pass due to a bug in someone \nelse&#39;s code. (Of course, can&#39;t you just rewrite the test to pass now, \nbut fail when the bug is fixed? Works great for me and doesn&#39;t require \nan annotation or anything: just a failure message like &#39;Somebody might \nhave fixed bug 12578. If so, change this assertion.&#39;)\n\nSo while annotations can solve these problems, they require building a \nnew, complex thing to use well, rather than relying on support that \nalready exists, and that perhaps helps me act more intentionally when \nchanging a test&#39;s &quot;group&quot;.\n\nI&#39;m thrilled that TestNG already does this, but this is not the TestNG \nmailing list.\n-- \nJ.
