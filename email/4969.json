If <br/>\nyou select a TestSuite (or, actually, anything that is not a TestCase <br/>\nsubclass) the Run button is disabled.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe reason behind that -- I think -- is that for every test to be <br/>\natomic, it need to be reloaded before running. It&#39;s easy to reload a <br/>\nTestCase subclass. It would be harder to reload a TestSuite or an <br/>\nobject implementing the Test interface.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I&#39;m proposing is to implement a &quot;junit.framework.Reloadable&quot; <br/>\ninterface to allow tests that aren&#39;t subclasses of the &quot;TestCase&quot; <br/>\nclass to be reloaded and rerun from the Swing GUI. That interface <br/>\nwould only have one method:<br/>\n<br/>\npublic Test reload();<br/>\n<br/>\nOr maybe the java.lang.Cloneable interface could be used.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I will implement those changes locally because it&#39;s a feature <br/>\nI really need. If you think it could be a good thing to include in <br/>\nJUnit, let me know and I&#39;ll send you the source code.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAlexandre</div>",
