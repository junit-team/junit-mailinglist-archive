I would like to improve upon this \n&gt;(if it&#39;s possible and/or a good idea) and test the actual Corba \n&gt;framework for availability, etc. in order to implement \n&gt;this &#39;healthcheck&#39;.  Pro&#39;s or Con&#39;s to testing the framework versus \n&gt;testing against my wrapper classes for this purpose?\n&gt;\n&gt;Is there a pattern/library or website available that will help me \n&gt;here?  I&#39;d like to avoid as many of the dumb mistakes as possible out \n&gt;of the gate. \n&gt;\n&gt;Specifically we are using Visibroker 5.2.\n&gt;\n&gt;Any help/pointers would be appreciated.\n&gt;\n&gt;Thanks...\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\nWe use CORBA and decided early on to treat it like any other framework - \nwrap it, mock it and leave it alone.\n\nThe main reasons were due to CORBAs threadiness, setup teardown costs, \nimplementation.\n\nOur ORB will auto redirect corba requests directly in memory if both \nclient and server processes are on the same machine, so you aren&#39;t \nactually using the code that goes out on to the LAN in this case - \nresulting in a kind of false test really.\n\nThe fail reason was one of scope for the tests - when does a test stop \nbeing a Unit test and start becoming an Acceptance test. - for us, \nmaking corba requests over a live network, we consider an acceptance test.\n\nHTH\n\nAndrew\n\n",
