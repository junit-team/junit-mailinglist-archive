People seem to hear what they want to hear.<br/>\nI know, I am one of them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI gave a bunch of presentations/demos where I explicitely said (many<br/>\ntimes over): &quot;Agitator does not generate tests - you don&#39;t get a<br/>\nsingle test point (i.e. a test assertion) without your participation<br/>\nand effort.  Agitator *helps* *you* to generate tests&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you were to ask attendees 2 minutes after my presentation/demo to<br/>\ndescribe Agitator most of the would say: &quot;It&#39;s a test generator&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am sure we also share some of the fault since in marketing something<br/>\nas different as Agitator you need to make reference to something<br/>\nfamiliar (i.e. &quot;... it&#39;s a bit like an automated test generators ...&quot;)<br/>\nto help people understand.  And on top of that marketing messages have<br/>\nto be short and concise.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlberto</div>",
