However, the way that nested transactions work\ndiffers from db to db and from framework to framework, e.g. some changes to the\ndata might only be visible once they have been committed by the outermost\ntransaction. Those subtleties can make it a very difficult task to do it always\nthe way Kevin describes. This is just one more argument for providing a\nmockable abstraction to your persistent data layer and to use the mock in as\nmany tests as possible.\n\nJohannes\n\n\n\n",
