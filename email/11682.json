We want to use JUnit as<br/>\n&gt; tools for performing unit testing. However, I found difficulties that<br/>\n&gt; test the correctness of JFrame (with other GUI components). Does it<br/>\n&gt; possible that test by using JUnit, say, the JLabel is appear correct<br/>\n&gt; caption after some changes. But at the same moment, how can I tigger<br/>\n&gt; the changes in JUnit?<br/>\n&gt;   Would you mind teaching me any tips to tackle this problems? Or<br/>\n&gt; does it has any articles/guide to the implementation of this kind of<br/>\n&gt; testing??<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Best regards and thanks a lot for kind attention.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I strongly recommend Dave Astels&#39; book, &quot;Test Driven Development: A <br/>\nPractical Guide&quot;. It is the only Java-based book I know that uses a <br/>\nSwing GUI as the core example for JUnit and its related GUI testing <br/>\npackages (Jemmy). Don&#39;t even think about the price of the book. If <br/>\nyou&#39;re going to be testing and test-driving Swing GUI applications for <br/>\neven just a few months, you&#39;ll get your investment back. No question.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
