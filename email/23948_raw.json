A=\r\nlso the data\nhandling(permutation of all the data set) by Theories is not s=\r\nomething that\nassist in performing data driven testing.\n\nAll this and more =\r\nresulted in I agreeing to David&#39;s suggestion of submitting an\ninitial exten=\r\nsion to Theories Runnner that handles data in a consistent way and\nprovides=\r\n users the ability to extend the framework.\nSo here is the link to the init=\r\nial source code that supports new features for doing Data Driven Testing :\n=\r\nhttps://github.com/anujgandharv/junit-theories-ext\n\nMajorly the support is =\r\nin form of annotations.\n\nThere is also a sample test in the repository that=\r\n explores most of the new\nfeatures introduced.\n\nI am looking forward to you=\r\nr suggestions of how you feel about the extension and\nwhat can be improved =\r\nso that it can be used by JUnit as an extension to Theories\nRunner.\n\nCheers=\r\n!\nAnuj Kumar\n\n\n\n",
