Put this class <br/>\nin your test package.<br/>\n<br/>\nA.2) Create a simple delegation method in the subclass with public <br/>\naccess that calls the protected method. You can also put this method <br/>\ndirectly in the class you want to test, and just remove it before <br/>\nreleasing. This causes a lot of out commenting though :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd something I sometimes do before testing smaller areas...<br/>\n<br/>\nB.1) change the method access to public for the duration of the test. <br/>\nThen change it back to private. This also gives some problems in, <br/>\nthat you cannot execute automatic tests.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf these suggestions won&#39;t do, I see no other way than looking into <br/>\nwhat reflection might do for you.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards,<br/>\nJakob Jenkov</div>",
