Here&#39;s some code to help out the next person.<br/>\n<br/>\n@BeforeClass<br/>\npublic static void runBeforeTestClass() throws Exception {<br/>\n        if(System.getProperty(&quot;someproperty&quot;) == null) {<br/>\n\t\tRunNotifier fNotifier;<br/>\n\t\tfNotifier= new RunNotifier();<br/>\n\t\tfNotifier.pleaseStop();<br/>\n\t\tfail(&quot;someproperty was not set!&quot;);<br/>\n\t\tfNotifier.fireTestStarted(null);<br/>\n\t}<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n}<br/>\n<br/>\nIf this is something you are likely to use in a number of places, you <br/>\ncan just take the notifier code, and put it in a stopRunner method <br/>\nthat takes in the string argument you want to show up in the fail <br/>\nmessage.  This works nicely as it is passed up and shows up in the <br/>\nfinal html junitreport output.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;dchoicestream&quot; &lt;dshea@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m using Eclipse 3.2 using the JUnit 4.1 test runner along with <br/>\nANT <br/>\n&gt; 1.7.0beta1 to do development, and then when I deploy everything is <br/>\n&gt; executed from ANT 1.7.0beta1 using JUnit 4.1 with the &lt;junit&gt; and <br/>\n&gt; &lt;junitreport&gt; tasks.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In my JUnit test class I have a @BeforeClass method which checks to <br/>\n&gt; make sure that the necessary properties (arguments) have been <br/>\npassed <br/>\n&gt; before even beginning the test methods.  In my @BeforeClass method, <br/>\nhow <br/>\n&gt; do I tell the runner to exit?<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve looked through UserStopTest.java, and I know that the secret <br/>\nlies <br/>\n&gt; somewhere in accessing the runner notifier and using the pleaseStop<br/>\n() <br/>\n&gt; method, but it is eluding me.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If someone could drop an example that would be great!<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
