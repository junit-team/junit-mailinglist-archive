Burn them! \n:-). So, separating test and design is all to the good. We have a well \nestablished design methodology, and (relatively good) tool support for \ndesign.\n\nWhere I see the biggest lack of support in testing tools is a formal, \nsemi-automated way to generate test stubs for requirements checking. I \nwould love to be able to extract from a structured requirements document \nand generate a slew of test stubs for those requirements. I just got bit \nin the butt today, by an untested class invariant: it was specified in \nthe design docs, but never implemented in the test code. (Bad Programmer \n- no biscuit!)  We&#39;ve been playing around with the notion of a tool to \nread the structured English requirements, and automatically extract the \ntest stubs, but haven&#39;t had the time to make any real progress.\n\n\nI agree that there are at least two large stake-holders on the JUnit \ngroup, those who do test driven DESIGN, and those who do test driven \nDEVELOPMENT, and I think that both need to be supported.\n\nJim\nJ. B. Rainsberger wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m beginning to wonder whether we should have separate design and\n&gt; testing tools. This seems to be a serious source of contention among\n&gt; programmers: we call it testing, but we mean design, and when we do\n&gt; design, testing is a secondary consideration, and yet testing is important.\n&gt; \n&gt; Rather than repackaging TDD and calling it BDD, hoping that Sapir-Whorf\n&gt; will save us from our own sloppiness, maybe it&#39;s time for separate tools\n&gt; for design and testing. I have no idea how that would work, but perhaps\n&gt; it would help us all get along.\n&gt; \n&gt; So I&#39;d like a way to separate my design and testing activities when I do\n&gt; TDD. For example, when I test-drive behavior that doesn&#39;t yet exist, I&#39;m\n&gt; almost always designing; but when I fill in the holes by adding a test\n&gt; for a case that should already pass, I&#39;m testing. Perhaps it would be\n&gt; better to separate those somehow.\n&gt; \n&gt; Any ideas?\n&gt; -- \n&gt; J. B.
