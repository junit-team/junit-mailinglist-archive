Downloading now. Thanks<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There&#39;s a few other thingd in there as well.  Mike wrote a section on<br/>\nthem for my &quot;JUnit extensions&quot; chapter.  And I made use of the<br/>\nEqualsTester in the example.  It&#39;s very handy.<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;ve just pre-ordered your book on BN. Looking forward to reading <br/>\n&gt; it.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Thanks.  Just a note.. the BN site has the &quot;real&quot; cover, Amazon still<br/>\nhas an earlier version.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;m currently delving into several XP books (Java Tools for Extreme <br/>\n&gt; Programming, as well as the Oreilly XP Cookbook)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>To be honest, I haven&#39;t read those yet.  As you&#39;re looking at TDD, you<br/>\nshould read Kent&#39;s &quot;TDD: by Example&quot; as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; I suggest EasyMock (www.easymock.org) as well as<br/>\n&gt; &gt; MockObjects (http://www.mockobjects.com)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks for the links. Got them bookmarked.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If anyone (else) on here is using Smalltalk, I have a dynamic<br/>\nMockObject framework ready for use (similar to EasyMock).<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Got a lot to learn about TDDing.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>We all do.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Sucks trying to learn this while attempting develop software with a <br/>\n&gt; deadline...<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, and the ironic thing is that once you get good at it, you&#39;ll find<br/>\nyourself working faster.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Thanks for the tips, <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Glad to be of assistance.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; and I&#39;m sure this list will be hearing from me  again.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Good.. that&#39;s what it&#39;s here for IMHO.<br/>\n<br/>\nDave</div>",
