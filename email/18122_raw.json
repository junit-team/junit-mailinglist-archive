Sorry to answer a question with a question, but what \nfrustrated you while learning or using unit testing?  What did you find \nyourself doing repeatedly that really could have been automated?  What \nconfused you and wasted your time?\n\nIf you start with answers to these questions, you&#39;re probably well on \nyour way to identifying a way to contribute to the community.  Actually, \njust answering them here would probably be a contribution, since it \nmight lead other people to new ideas.\n\n    David\n\nShashank Kalra wrote:\n&gt; Hi all !!\n&gt;\n&gt; Its nice to be part of a group with people who have experience in the\n&gt; field of testing and oop\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ve used unit testing as part of a small project and now i want to\n&gt; work on the field &quot;testing of object-oriented programs&quot; by making some\n&gt; plugin in eclipse or extending some testing functionality in junit etc etc\n&gt;\n&gt; I would really like some help on what can i do and how to start with\n&gt; this thing.\n&gt;\n&gt; thanking you all in anticipation,\n&gt;\n&gt; Shashank\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo!
