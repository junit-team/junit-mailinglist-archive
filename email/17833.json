Just because none of us are omniscient <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t mean none of us know better, especially in particular domains.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile I would not presume to tell a statistician how to use a statistics <br/>\nAPI, I wouldn&#39;t presume to design one either because I am not an expert <br/>\nin the field. I do know just enough about statistics to be dangerous. <br/>\nThat is why when I need to write statistics code I go looking for a <br/>\nstatistics library that will help me by, among other things, revealing <br/>\nthe gaps and flaws in my understanding.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy contrast, when I&#39;m working with XML, I probably do know better than <br/>\nmost what is needed, which is why I have written my own API. However <br/>\nthere probably aren&#39;t 100 people who know XML as well as I do, and an <br/>\nAPI designed just for them wouldn&#39;t be very useful. Instead I publish a <br/>\nlibrary that is appropriate for people who do know less than I do within <br/>\nthe specific field of XML. Knowing less is perfectly fine. Lord knows <br/>\nmost developers have better things to do with their lives than studying <br/>\nthe arcana of the various XML specifications.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo people occasionally get rubbed wrong by the strictness of my API? <br/>\nYes. However in almost every case, that&#39;s because what they want to do <br/>\nis wrong and contrary to their needs. They just don&#39;t know know as much <br/>\nabout XML as I do so they don&#39;t realize that. The problems they have <br/>\nusing my API are symptoms of a deeper underlying problem with their <br/>\nunderstanding and use of XML. Because my API refuses to let them do what <br/>\nthey want, they learn the right way of doing things.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is one exception, by the way. I have exactly one user of XOM who <br/>\nactually understands XML at a pretty deep level but who&#39;s still rubbed <br/>\nwrong by the strictures it imposes. He went ahead and forked the project <br/>\nto support his unique needs. That&#39;s the ultimate escape hatch, but once <br/>\nhe&#39;s forked it&#39;s now his project and not mine so I&#39;m no longer <br/>\nresponsible for what he does with the library.<br/>\n<br/>\nThink of it this way: it&#39;s like designing a car to run on the public <br/>\nroads. It&#39;s not just the driver of the car you have to worry about. You <br/>\nalso have a responsibility to other drivers, pedestrians, insurance <br/>\ncompanies, and indeed everyone who breathes on this planet. Their needs <br/>\nsometimes outweigh the needs or desires of the driver. Now if the driver <br/>\nopens up the hood and manually disables the emission control system and <br/>\nvarious safety features, there&#39;s not much you can do about it, but <br/>\nyou&#39;re not responsible for it either. But if you ship a car that spews <br/>\nnoxious emissions and injures pedestrians as soon as the buyer drives it <br/>\noff the lot, you are responsible for that. If the car only does this, <br/>\nwhen driven 75 mph or faster, you&#39;re still responsible for that, even if <br/>\nyou pout a warning in the owner&#39;s manual and the fine print of the sales <br/>\ncontract saying, &quot;Don&#39;t drive faster than 75 mph.&quot; It&#39;s much better to <br/>\ndesign the car so that proper operation doesn&#39;t rely on unenforced limits.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n﻿Elliotte Rusty Harold  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:elharo@...\">elharo@...</a><br/>\nJava I/O 2nd Edition Just Published!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafeaulait.org/books/javaio2/\">http://www.cafeaulait.org/books/javaio2/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596527500/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/\">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596527500/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/</a></div>",
