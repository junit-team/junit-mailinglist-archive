Minimally, the app mus=\r\nt have requirements \n&gt; doc signed by user&#39;s/vendor, traceability to design =\r\ndocuments from \n&gt; requirements, traceability from requirements to unit, sys=\r\ntem and \n&gt; user acceptance tests, plus a varitey of additional higher level=\r\n \n&gt; validation strategy and test plan documents.  Usually the \n&gt; traceabili=\r\nty is shown as a traceability matrix. The evidence of all \n&gt; the tests and =\r\ndev processes must be archived, signed, etc. This is \n&gt; mostly just standar=\r\nd good software development practice but ideally \n&gt; I need all these elemen=\r\nts for junit to make the QA police \n&gt; comfortable.  \n\n  I have no experienc=\r\ne in developing software w/ this degree of\nformalism, and this post made me=\r\n curious: I&#39;d understand that all the\nvalidation is required of the compone=\r\nnts included w/ the software, but I\ndon&#39;t really understand that it is requ=\r\nired of the development tools,\ntoo. Is it required that the debugger is val=\r\nidated? The compiler? The\nIDE? The OS? The JVM? Actually, the OS and the JV=\r\nM are pretty important\nfor the correct functioning of the software, as is t=\r\nhe compiler.\n\n  As I see it, unit tests are a development tool - they aren&#39;=\r\nt (usually)\nshipped w/ the software. You could, in principle, write and use=\r\n unit\ntests, but keep their sources and binaries in a separate place and ne=\r\nver\neven tell the auditors they exist, and the auditors would not know to\nm=\r\niss them. I&#39;m not suggesting you do this, I&#39;m just a little confused as\nto =\r\nwhy a development tool needs to be validated.\n  Thenagain, if you want to u=\r\nse junit to validate your software\nformally, then I guess the validation to=\r\nol itself needs to be validated?\n\n\n\n       -Antti-\n\n\n\n\n",
