In my current situation, I\n&gt; want to write two tests:\n&gt; 1) is a standard operation test where it loads a file and makes sure\n&gt; everything was sent properly to Oracle.\n&gt; 2) is a specialized test where it loads a file and checks to see if\n&gt; the site code was capitalized in Oracle.\n&gt;\n&gt; So my question is this, should I use individual files for each test\n&gt; (i.e., one file containing many lines of site data for the first test\n&gt; and then a seperate file containing a single line with a lowercase\n&gt; site code) and load each file at the start of each test, or should I\n&gt; combine the data from both into a single file and load that before all\n&gt; the tests are run (using a @BeforeClass)?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thank you in advance.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
