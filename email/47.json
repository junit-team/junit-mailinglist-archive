I know those are a pain to draw.<br/>\n<br/>\nI understand much more clearly what you are doing now.  A couple of <br/>\nquestions:<br/>\n<br/>\na) Does your &lt;&lt; MyEJBIF &gt;&gt; throw remote exceptions in the local case?  <br/>\n<br/>\ni.e. if I am the client and I want to run locally, I wouldn&#39;t expect <br/>\nany remote exceptions.  I have seen this handled both ways where the <br/>\nRemoteException are caught and where they are thrown to the client <br/>\n(regardless of local or distributed).<br/>\n<br/>\nb) Would it be possible to use the EJB&#39;s Remote Interface as your &lt;&lt; <br/>\nMyEJBIF &gt;&gt;?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is the difference between &lt;&lt; MyEJBIF &gt;&gt; and the EJB&#39;s Remote <br/>\nInterface?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first time I approached this problem I made a special business <br/>\ninterface for my objects and then realized I could just use the EJB <br/>\nRemote interface itself.  The only draw back is my client must catch <br/>\nRemote, Create, Finder EJB Exceptions (even though they may not be <br/>\nthrown) in the local case.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPS I like you choice of names i.e. biPolar...  I have an Electrical <br/>\nEngineering background and it brings back memories of Bipolar Junction <br/>\nTransistors (BJT&#39;s).  I understood exactly what you meant.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<br/>\n<br/>\nJonathan</div>",
