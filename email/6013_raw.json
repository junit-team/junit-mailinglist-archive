Non classic solution is to return to a composer a recordset object \n&gt; =\r\nand put on the composer&#39;s shoulders to fetch it, surround by specific \n&gt; in=\r\nfo and put out. This resolves memory wasting problem but tights two \n&gt; diff=\r\nerent activities together.\n\nAnd couldn&#39;t you do this with a proxy (say a sp=\r\necialised recordset\nwrapper), so that you still have the decoupling of fetc=\r\nhing information\nfrom the DB, from the building of the report.  The compose=\r\nr thus still\nfocuses solely on building a report, whereas the Data Object (=\r\nmy proxy)\ncan focus on getting data out from a store (DB, filesystem, ...).=\r\n\n\n&gt; Does it mean that every time a unit test can&#39;t be written for a \n&gt; func=\r\ntion the function must be refactored?\n\nOn this one, I will agree with the r=\r\nesponses you have already received:\na design that allows for easy unit test=\r\ning, usually also benefits from\nthe side-effects of low coupling, high cohe=\r\nsion, etc.  You have to\nbalance the work of undertaking the refactoring, wi=\r\nth the benefits:  how\nlong do you expect to be maintaining that function/me=\r\nthod; is this a one\noff, or further changes are expected for this functiona=\r\nlity; ...\n\n\nManuel Amago.\nmailto:mamago@...\n\n\n",
