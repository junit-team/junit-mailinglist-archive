Starting \nand =\r\nshutting the platform and is very expensive.  It&#39;s on the order of \na minut=\r\ne or two to start the platform.  Before I run my unit tests, I \nwant to sta=\r\nrt the platform and when they are all done, I want to shut \nit down.  This =\r\nis easy to do if I only have one test method in my test \ncase.  I can just =\r\nput the startup code in the setup method and the \nshutdown code in the tear=\r\n down.  Unfortnately, if I have more than one \nmethod in the test case this=\r\n happens before and after each method.  If \nI have 10 test methods, the uni=\r\nt test could take 20 minutes instead of \njust 3 minutes.  Is there a way to=\r\n start the platform, run all of the \ntests in the TestCase, and then shut d=\r\nown the platform?  Thanks.\n\n\n\nJay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
