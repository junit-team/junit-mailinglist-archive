I am using ANT 1.6.2 and JUnit 3.8.1,\nbut I would be w=\r\nilling to use JUnit 4 if it would help.  I am fairly\nnew to JUnit which is =\r\nwhy I would like advice on which is the best way\nI should proceed.\n\nMy orig=\r\ninal attempt to create test suites was to use XDoclet to\nauto-generate 3 te=\r\nst suites based on category tags (unit, component,\nsystem).  For instance, =\r\nUnitSuite would create a test suite that\ncontained calls to the suite metho=\r\nds of classes with the @... tag.  \n\nI would then run the &lt;junit&gt; ant =\r\ntask to execute the UnitSuite,\nComponentSuite and SystemSuite.  This approa=\r\nch seemed fine until I\ntried to implement the &lt;junitreport&gt; ant task and fo=\r\nund that my\npackage structure was lost in the HTML report.\n\nI have found a =\r\nfew discussions on how to remedy this issue, but they\nseem rather complex t=\r\no me.  I believe I have three options as\nfollows.  Any opinions/advice on a=\r\nny of them is greatly appreciated.\n\n1.) Implement a custom test runner, lis=\r\ntener and xsl style sheet to\nformat the output of the tests being run.  The=\r\n issue I am having with\nthis is how to break up the test suites and get the=\r\n information out of\nthem.\n\n2.) Break the categories up into directories so =\r\nI can tell the &lt;junit&gt;\ntask to run all tests in a directory structure.  The=\r\n Unit directory\nwould contain the package structure of the classes under te=\r\nst and the\nComponent and System directories would use some custom directori=\r\nes for\ndescribing the tests they contain.  This is the option I am leaning\n=\r\ntowards.\n\n3.) Naming conventions for different test categories.  I would no=\r\nt\nlike to impose such restrictions on the development team.\n\nI would love t=\r\no hear pros and cons for any of these options or if\nthere are any more I ha=\r\nve missed.\n\nThanks for taking the time to read this message.\n\nPatrick Gombo=\r\nla\n---------------\npgumby@...\npgombola@...\n\n\n",
