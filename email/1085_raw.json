We know the value of performing test\n&gt; cases, we just seldom actually take the time to implement them in our\n&gt; hectic schedule.  So I have put together the frame work for automatically\n&gt; generating test cases for any class, any method.  Here is a sample Java\n&gt; file:\n&gt; \n&gt;      /**\n&gt;       * @test-method\n&gt;       * @test-case 4\n&gt;       * @assert 16\n&gt;       * @test-case 5\n&gt;       * @assert 25\n&gt;       * @test-case 6\n&gt;       * @assert 36\n&gt;       */\n[snip]\n\n&gt; I have several more ideas for the above, but wanted to share the basics and\n&gt; see if anyone was interested in it.  This started out as a project to test\n&gt; our EJB&#39;s(and still does) generating all of the lookup code, and providing\n&gt; he method level testing of all our EJB&#39;s.\n&gt; \n&gt; If any interest is generated, I would be more than happy to package up what\n&gt; I have so far and share it....\n&gt; \n\nThis is a neat idea.  How do you propose handling asserts where the result\ncan&#39;t be expressed as a simple integer?  For instance, the project I&#39;m\nworking on today has unit tests which compare a UDPDatagram with a reference\nI create at runtime using a byte[] array and the UDPDatagram constructor.\n\n-- \nJoi Ellis                    Software Engineer\nAravox Technologies          joi@..., gyles19@...\n\nNo matter what we think of Linux versus FreeBSD, etc., the one thing I\nreally like about Linux is that it has Microsoft worried.  Anything\nthat kicks a monopoly in the pants has got to be good for something.\n           - Chris Johnson\n\n\n",
