I agree with you<br/>\n&gt; that it depends on the degree of oupling between methods.

If so what are the<br/>\n&gt; parameters on which the LOC for a particular test case depends on.<br/>\n&gt; This muct include teh mock classes also.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You could try, but I wouldn&#39;t trust those numbers very much. LOC are <br/>\nsuch a poor indicator of time spent writing code, especially when one <br/>\nstarts to refactor regularly.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll I can suggest is a two-week experiment where you test-drive all new <br/>\nfeatures and add tests only when you need them to support your current <br/>\nwork. After two weeks, measure how quickly you&#39;re adding new features. <br/>\nThis tells you when you&#39;ll be done, which is likely more important than <br/>\nknowing how much writing tests (alone) costs you.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ.
