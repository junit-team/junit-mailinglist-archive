This gives you the access you require.  It\n&gt; also provides other benefits, especially with TDD.  It makes managing\n&gt; the source a lot easier.  You only have to check in/out one file from\n&gt; SCM.  That way you never, ahem, forget the test code.  It&#39;s always\n&gt; married to the app code.  This helps enforce a mindset that the test\n&gt; code is just as important as the app code.  And it&#39;s really\n&gt; comfortable to bounce up and down the single file in your editor as\n&gt; you iterate between writing test code and app code.  Deployment is\n&gt; not a problem, since inner classes are compiled into seperate class\n&gt; files, using the AppClass$TestClass.class naming convention.\n\nThis sounds like a really great idea.\n\nI only recently became enamored of JUnit, as a result of JUnitDoclet&#39;s\ncreating a test framework for me. That shortened the JUnit learning\ncurve, which helped a lot.\n\nI&#39;m curious. Do you know of any IDEs that support this technique by\ngenerating static inner test classes?\n\n\n\n\n\n",
