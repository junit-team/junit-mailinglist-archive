Lets say this class has 10 \nmethods.  These methods accept each for example 2 arguments.  For \neach method I write 5 tests (5 tests that send different arguments to \neach method) that makes 10 * 5 test methods = 50 test methods.  Too \nmany methods and code for me in one test class, So I figured out i \nwould extend my test class to different ones and reuse its setup() \nteardown(), however when extending it in the suite of my extending \nclass I had to specify each test method I wanted to test otherwise If \nI used  \ntestSuite.addTestSuite(ExtendingInternalServicesTest.class);\nthen it not only ran the ExtendingInternalServicesTest but also ran \nthe InternalServicesTest test methods... so my question is is there \nanyway to have the suite of my extending test class \ntestSuite.addTestSuite(ExtendingInternalServicesTest.class); without \nits running its super test methods.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
