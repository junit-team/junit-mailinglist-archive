But maybe that&#39;s a good tradeoff.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor me, the answer is that my tests don&#39;t fail often enough to warrant  <br/>\nthat extra expense. Since I&#39;m doing TDD, assertions generally fail  <br/>\nonce, maybe a few times, during development. And while I&#39;m developing,  <br/>\nI&#39;m pretty familiar with what the test failures mean. But after that,  <br/>\nfailing tests are pretty rare, and I want them to be. So, I don&#39;t  <br/>\nusually bother with assertion failure messages.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen assertion failures do occur, *I have to look at the test anyway.*<br/>\n<br/>\n[ BTW, the assertion failure message shown as an example here (which  <br/>\nprobably won&#39;t compile, since the message goes first in JUnit) doesn&#39;t  <br/>\ntell me what &quot;n&quot; is--that&#39;s more useful than a message that simply  <br/>\nrestates the conditional expression. I&#39;d probably code:<br/>\n    assertTrue(&quot;out of range: &quot; + n, 2 &lt; n && n &lt; 10)<br/>\nBut that&#39;s nitpicking on email-code. I think I know what you probably meant. ]<br/>\n<br/>\nYeah, it&#39;d be nice to have a prettier failure message. But, that&#39;s OK:  <br/>\nif I get a failed test and can&#39;t decipher the meaning of the failure,  <br/>\nI code the nicer failure message and rerun the tests. If it&#39;s the kind  <br/>\nof failure that keeps recurring, however unfortunately, I&#39;ll keep the  <br/>\nmessage in, otherwise I&#39;ll delete it. I might also build a custom  <br/>\nassert method:<br/>\n    assertInRange(2, n, 10);<br/>\n... particularly if I have a similar need elsewhere in the code. I  <br/>\nprobably do. And at that point an assertion failure message, created  <br/>\nin assertInRange, is very prudent.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes, complex assertions hint at a problem with my system&#39;s  <br/>\ndesign--there might be a need for such a construct in the system itself:<br/>\n<br/>\n    assertTrue(new productionpackage.Interval(2, 10).encloses(n));<br/>\n<br/>\nGiven all the choices, I think the Java language makes the literate  <br/>\nprogramming one the least appealing to me. It is what it is.<br/>\n<br/>\nJeff</div>",
