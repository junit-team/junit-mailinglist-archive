Essentially, this\nincludes recording each run of the theory as a separate test.  I&#39;ve\nprepared a patch to make it possible, and to get it applied I need your\nsupport.\n\nhttp://github.com/KentBeck/junit/issues#issue/78\n\n\nThe way it works is that you mark the theory you want to be recorded\nseparately like this:\n\n@DataPoints\npublic static int[] fibonacciSeries() {\n    return new int[] {1,2,3,5,8,13};\n}\n\n@Theory(runDiscretely=true)\npublic void myTheory(int data) {\n    // do the testing\n}\n\nIf you have 6 data points, your test results will have 6 tests recorded\nlike this:\nmyTheory[1] = passed\nmyTheory[2] = passed\nmyTheory[3] = failed\nmyTheory[5] = passed\nmyTheory[8] = failed\nmyTheory[13] = passed\n\nThe advantage of this approach is that each failure is recorded\nseparately.  When you are evaluating a number of implementations of the\ninterface, you can find all the failures in one pass instead of fixing\none failure to reveal another.\n\nAdditionally, the value in the square brackets can be customized with\nthe toString() method of your objects under test.  The test names are\nbuilt with String.valueOf() on the data point value (handles null as\nwell).  This works well when you dynamically build the data points in a\nmethod like the example I provided above.  Without this solution, the\nonly clue is in the exception thrown which gives you the name of the\n@DataPoints method (fibonnacciSeries) and the index ([2]) with the first\nfailure above.  The patch I have does not remove this functionality, so\nyou have both solutions available.  The discrete test name includes the\nString value of the object and the exception thrown gives you the name\nof the data point and index (if applicable).\n\nIf you believe that this will be helpful, vote for the issue at the\nbeginning of the email.  If you want to try it out, you can get it from\ngithub here:\n\nhttp://github.com/bloritsch/junit\n\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
