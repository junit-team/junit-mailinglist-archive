Let&#39;s face it; a lot of groups of tests do have<br/>\n&gt;  known dependencies between tests such that if test A fails, we know that<br/>\n&gt;  the output of tests B, C and D are uninteresting. Yet we end up running<br/>\n&gt;  B, C and D anyway, and then searching through all the error output for<br/>\n&gt;  the failure that we know is the &quot;real&quot; one, ignoring all the others as<br/>\n&gt;  spurious.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>With all due respect, I believe that is a code smell.  It seems to say to me <br/>\nthat there is something not right about the design of the code being tested, <br/>\nor perhaps even more elusive, something is wrong with how the tests are <br/>\nwritten.  When I find these types of dependencies I inevitably rethink how I <br/>\nhave written my tests.  Have I coded in the dependencies or are they really <br/>\nthere.  More times than not I have coded in the dependencies -- and therefore <br/>\nI can remove them.  Further, I would argue that I _NEED_ to remove them.  <br/>\nNow, maybe I am old-fashioned but I believe tests (at least at the <br/>\nunit/programmer level) ought to be as autonomous as possible.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJason Rogers<br/>\n117 N.
