I&#39;ve poked around the net but haven&#39;t gotten much in this\n&gt;  category...\n\nTry the JUnit FAQ. This entry might be a good place to start:\n\nhttp://junit.sourceforge.net/doc/faq/faq.htm#tests_15\n\nThere are many good pieces of information in the FAQ and I suggest\nreading it carefully.\n\n&gt;  The root of my question is simple... Should there be one large &#39;test&#39;\n&gt;  for each method or one small &#39;test&#39; for each method possibility?\n&gt;\n&gt;  To explain what I&#39;m asking I have a short example... Assume the\n&gt;  following method I&#39;d like to test:\n&gt;\n&gt;  int ReportManager.createReport(Report report)\n&gt;\n&gt;  In this particular case, assume I&#39;d like to test the following\n&gt;  circumstances...\n&gt;\n&gt;  * Does it throw an exception if report == null?\n&gt;  * Does it throw an exception if report is empty?\n&gt;  * Does it throw an exception if report is duplicate?\n&gt;  * Does it return a valid ID if successful?\n&gt;\n&gt;  So given this scenario, how would you do it? Would you go &#39;one big\n&gt;  test&#39;, or &#39;4 small tests&#39;?\n&gt;\n&gt;  1 Test =&gt; testCreateReport\n&gt;  4 Tests =&gt; testCreateReportNull\n&gt;  testCreateReportEmpty\n&gt;  testCreateReportDuplicate\n&gt;  testCreateReportSuccess\n&gt;\n&gt;  I could see benefits going either way here. While 1 test would give you\n&gt;  a &#39;hey this method is broken&#39;, and your resulting fail would tell you\n&gt;  why (assuming your comment were appropriate). On the flip side, having\n&gt;  4 tests is just as easy since you&#39;d see that single test fail.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Comments? Thanks!\n\nThe best thing with JUnit testing is to think in terms of behaviours.\nWhat behaviour are you expecting from your system and write a test for\nthat. Do not let the fact that some behaviours span multiple objects\nwhile others use only a single method cause you to lose sight of the\nfact that testing is best done at the unit level and the most workable\nunit is the unit of behaviour.\n\nThat&#39;s what I do anyway. :-)\n\nSimon\n\n-- \nsimonpeter.org | simonpeter.com | newlife-upc.org | wisconsindistrictnews.org\n\n",
