I&#39;ve now worked around the issue by having the leaf tests consolidate their findings into the master test in a textual manner. A master test is represented by the URL of the page describing all of the tests. JUnit knows about the URLs to invoke in advance.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think what would have been nice here is to fire results as being children of the description originally provided (the master test in my scenario). Having them reported as unrooted isn&#39;t technically correct as they are children of a description provided already.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks.</div>",
