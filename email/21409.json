That skeleton had a bunch of automated tests itself so even<br/>\n&gt; if they took ages to run (can&#39;t remember exactly but it was several<br/>\n&gt; minutes) at least the existence of automated tests suggests that it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; not the worst platform to build on.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Of course, this is just an educated guess so...
