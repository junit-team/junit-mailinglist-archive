You are\n&gt; talking about aspects in a system, which is exactly my point.\n\nWell, the aspectual Java papers are on my list of things to read very, very\nsoon (i.e., I&#39;m carrying them around in my bag every day), but unfortunately\nI&#39;ve not gotten around to reading them. So I probably don&#39;t really understand\nwhat you mean by &quot;aspectual&quot; in this case.\n\nHowever, from having looked at examples of Aspect-J, particularly the\nlogging one, I can say that what I do in terms of making objects more\ntestable is not the same, because it&#39;s not something you implement the\nsame way across lots of objects (the way logging the parameters to a\nmethod would be).\n\nBasically, I change not just the code itself, but even the design of\nthe code in order to make it easier to test. I do things like changing\nfrom static factory methods in individual classes to non-static factory\nmethods in a centralized factory object so that I can use a different\nimplemenation of that factory when I do unit testing. I don&#39;t really see\nhow that&#39;s an aspectual thing, except in the most vague and general sense.\n\nThis ability to write your code differently so that you can test things\nmore easily (or at all, sometimes!) is to my mind one of the most\npowerful aspects of having the same person writing tests and code at the\nsame time, rather than testing after the code is done.\n\n&gt; You say it&#39;s easier or your preference to represent testability as\n&gt; addtional mixed in methods here and there in the objects. I don&#39;t like\n&gt; that. But it seems like it&#39;s a matter of taste.\n\nThat&#39;s only one of the strategies I&#39;ll use to make an object more testable.\n\nI wonder if someone&#39;s already written up a set of design patterns for typical\nproblems and solutions in XP-style testing.\n\ncjs\n-- \nCurt Sampson  &lt;cjs@...&gt;   +81 90 7737 2974   http://www.netbsd.org\n    Don&#39;t you know, in this new Dark Age, we&#39;re all light.  --XTC\n\n\n",
