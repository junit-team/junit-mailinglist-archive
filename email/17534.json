Mike&#39;s chapter was very good, but it was  <br/>\nalmost pointedly devoid of TDD.  The test-later approach that the  <br/>\nchapter took left the example relatively untested.<br/>\n<br/>\nNevertheless I am very pleased with the testing orientation of Rails,  <br/>\nand am looking forward to seeing that very active and energetic  <br/>\ncommunity continue to embrace the disciplines of TDD.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n----<br/>\nRobert C.
