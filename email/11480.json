They are the first users of the production code<br/>\n&gt; and if they are hard to write, other production code that uses the code<br/>\n&gt; under test will also be hard to write. Development includes thrown<br/>\n&gt; exception types (throw specifications). If I write throws Exception at<br/>\n&gt; each unit test, I may hide a cumbersome exception specification in the<br/>\n&gt; code under test -- in production code I don&#39;t want to have throws<br/>\n&gt; Exception attached to every method.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You&#39;re right: I might hide a cumbersome exception specification, but <br/>\nsomething else I do seems to compensate for that, because I can&#39;t <br/>\nremember the last time it bit me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am confused, though: why does &quot;throws Exception&quot; in a test lead to <br/>\n&quot;throws Exception&quot; in production code? That doesn&#39;t happen to me. What <br/>\ntypically happens is:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. I write the test for code that will use code that throws a checked <br/>\nexception. I don&#39;t notice.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. I write the production code, at which point I realize that I need to <br/>\ncatch a checked exception, so in my production code, I have this:<br/>\n<br/>\n....<br/>\ncatch (CheckedException wrapped) {<br/>\n     throw new RuntimeException(&quot;Something went wrong doing X&quot;, wrapped);<br/>\n}<br/>\n<br/>\n3. I look up the situation under which the code I&#39;m /using/ (not <br/>\nwriting) throws CheckedException.<br/>\n<br/>\n4. I write down exception handling tests on my test list.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can follow this relatively simple ritual and avoid missing checked <br/>\nexception specifications.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; In short terms: I write no throws to my tests, unless the compiler<br/>\n&gt; complain, and the more often I have to do that, the more often I think<br/>\n&gt; about my throw specifications.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Different strokes for different folks. I used to do this, and it seemed <br/>\nonly to cost me without benefiting me. Maybe I need to try again.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
