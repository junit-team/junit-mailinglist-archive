Had read the docs of junit, but still not sure \nwhether it is useful for us. Here is a description about our product \nand the sort of test that we are looking for. Looking foward to your \nsuggestions?\n\nThere are 2 levels of tests we need to do.  One is the Simsbuilder, \nand \nthe other is for each model we implement for a client. \n\nI&#39;ll focus on Simsbuilder testing.  As a first draft, I&#39;ll basically \ndo \na brain dump and we can refine/add to this by iteration. \n\nThese are the areas we need to test: \n\nOur product is a business model building tool. Users build a model \nusing the tool and input a scenario, and then run the generated \nsimulation based on the model and the scenario. The tool does c++ \ncode generation, compilation, and execution of the model. Two kind of \ntesting are needed. \n\n1. Test tool itself. Test strategy would be to build up a set of test \nmodels and their correct output to test the logic of the tool. An \nautomatic test framework can be built around these models so that \nthey run through the process of compilation, execution and comparison \nof output. Errors could come out at each stage of that process. This \nis not funtional testing of the tool, but more logic testing of \nequational based engine of the tool.\n\n2. Persistence \nThere are two aspects of persistence we need to test.  first is the \nfunctional test, whether we can store and access data.  the second is \nperformance test, whether the data server can handle the load.  For \nthe first instance, we can use the data generated by the test models \nabove, and put a test framework around testing the data integrity and \naccess of the data server.  For performance test, we need to simulate \nmultiple client accesses over the network, with simulated time \ndelays, varying loads etc. \n\nThanks,\nJoe\n\n\n\n",
