I truly\nbelieve that the time I spend working o=\r\nn unit tests of my commercial\napplication saves me time on the other end.  =\r\nI can spend an extra\ncouple of hours writing some tests during my developme=\r\nnt, in order to\nsave my team quite a bit of effort down the road,...take th=\r\nis scenario,...\n&gt; \n&gt; I spend a couple incremental hours writing tests while=\r\n I develop my\ncode;\n&gt; We run a nightly build;\n&gt; One morning I see that a te=\r\nst has failed;\n&gt; I spend an hour to fix it;\n&gt; It makes it to QC and our cus=\r\ntomer without further incident.\n&gt; \n&gt; OR\n&gt; \n&gt; I save a couple hours during d=\r\nevelopment and don&#39;t write tests for\nmy code;\n&gt; The code gets built and rel=\r\neased to our QC department;\n&gt; They spend a week testing the code, and then =\r\nfind the bug;\n&gt; I spend an hour to fix it;\n&gt; The code gets built and releas=\r\ned to our QC department;\n&gt; They start over, with the schedule slipped a wee=\r\nk.\n&gt; \n&gt; OR\n&gt; \n&gt; Same scenario, except that QC doesn&#39;t catch it - the custom=\r\ner does;\n&gt; we lose face with the customer;\n&gt; we repeat the full cycle to re=\r\nlease, with the schedule slipped by\nhowever long it took to get to the clie=\r\nnt.\n&gt; \n&gt; It is something that you have to sell to product management,...if\n=\r\nyou can schedule time for writing tests (and writing before/during\ndevelopm=\r\nent is less time than after the code is written), and schedule\ntime to fix =\r\nbugs correctly (and write/fix tests to make sure it\ndoesn&#39;t get through aga=\r\nin), then you can make your commitments to your\nclients while providing a q=\r\nuality product that your staff can be proud of.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; my two cents,\n&gt; Dia=\r\nnne\n&gt; \n&gt; -------------- Original message -------------- \n&gt; From: &quot;frank zou=\r\n&quot; &lt;frankz1998@...&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Hi all,\n&gt; \n&gt; After lots of reading and trying, I t=\r\nhink I understand the following\n&gt; benefits that Junit-base testing can give=\r\n us:\n&gt; \n&gt; * more robust system\n&gt; * clean / good design \n&gt; * less regression=\r\n bugs \n&gt; * confidence to do refactorying, especially at the later phase of =\r\nthe\n&gt; project. \n&gt; * and lots more...\n&gt; \n&gt; These are really good things, for=\r\n open-source projects where there is\n&gt; no deadline pressure and resource co=\r\nuld almost be thought as\n&gt; un-limitted. However, for commercial software de=\r\nvelopment, is this\n&gt; still possible ?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Although I knew JUnit and oth=\r\ner JUnit-based open-source tools for a\n&gt; couple of years, my company and te=\r\nam never really enbrace it. The\n&gt; major reason is Product Managers always w=\r\nant to add cool features to\n&gt; the system quickly while programmers find the=\r\n schedule is always too\n&gt; tight to spend any extra time to write testing. \n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; I know from the mail list and books that we can take lots of advantage=\r\n\n&gt; of JUnit-based testing, I myself have no real hands-on experience on\n&gt; i=\r\nt. So here are my questions: \n&gt; \n&gt; * Will Junit-based testing make the proj=\r\nect time longer or shorter ?\n&gt; Any hard statistic data ? ( Here I mean comm=\r\nercial project rather than\n&gt; open-source project. )\n&gt; \n&gt; * One intersting p=\r\noint I found is that after Junit-based testing is\n&gt; introduced, programmers=\r\n tend to use IDE debugger much less than\n&gt; before.  This would save lots of=\r\n time. Is that true ?\n&gt; \n&gt; * Some guys say JUnit is good for biz / util cod=\r\ne testing. But for web\n&gt; application development, where HTML/javascript wou=\r\nld be root cause of\n&gt; lots of bugs, Junit is not so powerful. Any comments =\r\n? \n&gt; \n&gt; * How can I convince managers and programmers that JUnit-based is\n&gt;=\r\n really possible for commercial software development ? Any differnece\n&gt; fro=\r\nm open-source projects ?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Can some Junit gurus shed some light he=\r\nre ?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks, \n&gt; - Frank\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; SPONSORED LINKS B=\r\nasic programming language C programming language\nComputer programming langu=\r\nages \n&gt; The c programming language C programming language List of\nprogrammi=\r\nng languages \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; YAHOO!
