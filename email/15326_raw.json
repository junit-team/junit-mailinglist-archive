We need to balance the need for flexibility of extension with the need for flexibility of design evolution. Revealing all the details of our implementation means we can&#39;t change anything. And so we are left, as you said, revealing only as much as we are certain will be useful.\n\nI basically agree with that. Protected methods are fine, as long as \nyou&#39;re reasonably confident they&#39;re right and you&#39;re willing to maintain \nthem in the future.\n\n&gt; This leaves me unsettled. I know that my frameworks aren&#39;t as useful as they could be, but I also know that I would regret opening them up completely. I don&#39;t see how to strike a better balance than we strike with JUnit, though, so I&#39;ll live with it.\n\nI think extreme programming/agile development offers a path out of this \nconundrum. Instead of looking for one big bang release that then stands \nuntouched for a few years, look to more incremental releases (like in \nthe earlier days of JUnit). Two week release cycles give you plenty of \nopportunities to open up the framework to extension as people actually \nneed and request the extension. I&#39;ve found by experience that I tend to \nbe very bad at predicting what actually will be needed, even by myself. \nTherefore the longer I can delay the decision, the more likely it is \nthat the eventual decision will be correct.\n\nOf course, at least half of this is stuff I learned first from your \nbook. :-)\n\n-- \n﻿Elliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nXML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim\n\n",
