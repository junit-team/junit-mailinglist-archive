Probably not an <br/>\nissue for most people since the goal is 0 Errors and 0 Failures <br/>\nanyway. Catching the known exceptions that shouldn&#39;t be thrown and <br/>\nlogging Failure gives a slightly more correct test result.<br/>\n<br/>\nNonetheless, we started writing tests today that follow the idiom of <br/>\nletting the undesired exceptions propagate back to the framwork.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards,<br/>\n<br/>\nRob</div>",
