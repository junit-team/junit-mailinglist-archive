This release\n&gt; is the biggest since JUnit 4.0.  More information below (taken from\n&gt; the release notes).  To download, please go to\n&gt;\n&gt; http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=15278&package_id=12472&release_id=524119\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks to all of the bug reports, feature requests, and good\n&gt; conversation so far.  We hope this release will provoke more of the\n&gt; same.\n&gt;\n&gt;    David Saff and Kent Beck\n&gt;\n&gt; ## Summary of Changes in version 4.4 ##\n&gt;\n&gt; JUnit is designed to efficiently capture developers&#39; intentions about\n&gt; their code, and quickly check their code matches those intentions.\n&gt; Over the last year, we&#39;ve been talking about what things developers\n&gt; would like to say about their code that have been difficult in the\n&gt; past, and how we can make them easier.\n&gt;\n&gt; ### assertThat ###\n&gt;\n&gt; Two years ago, Joe Walnes built a [new assertion mechanism][walnes] on\n&gt; top of what was\n&gt; then [JMock 1][].  The method name was `assertThat`, and the syntax\n&gt; looked like this:\n&gt;\n&gt; [walnes]: http://joe.truemesh.com/blog/000511.html\n&gt; [JMock 1]: http://www.jmock.org/download.html\n&gt;\n&gt;     assertThat(x, is(3));\n&gt;     assertThat(x, is(not(4)));\n&gt;     assertThat(responseString,\n&gt; either(containsString(&quot;color&quot;)).or(containsString(&quot;colour&quot;)));\n&gt;     assertThat(myList, hasItem(&quot;3&quot;));\n&gt;\n&gt; More generally:\n&gt;\n&gt;     assertThat([value], [matcher statement]);\n&gt;\n&gt; Advantages of this assertion syntax include:\n&gt;\n&gt; - More readable and typeable: this syntax allows you to think in terms\n&gt; of subject, verb, object\n&gt;   (assert &quot;x is 3&quot;) rather than `assertEquals`, which uses verb,\n&gt; object, subject (assert &quot;equals 3 x&quot;)\n&gt;\n&gt; - Combinations: any matcher statement `s` can be negated (`not(s)`),\n&gt; combined (`either(s).or(t)`),\n&gt;   mapped to a collection (`each(s)`), or used in custom combinations\n&gt; (`afterFiveSeconds(s)`)\n&gt;\n&gt; - Readable failure messages.  Compare\n&gt;\n&gt;         assertTrue(responseString.contains(&quot;color&quot;) ||\n&gt; responseString.contains(&quot;colour&quot;));\n&gt;         // ==&gt; failure message:\n&gt;         // java.lang.AssertionError:\n&gt;\n&gt;         assertThat(responseString, anyOf(containsString(&quot;color&quot;),\n&gt; containsString(&quot;colour&quot;)));\n&gt;         // ==&gt; failure message:\n&gt;         // java.lang.AssertionError:\n&gt;         // Expected: (a string containing &quot;color&quot; or a string\n&gt; containing &quot;colour&quot;)\n&gt;         //      got: &quot;Please choose a font&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; - Custom Matchers.  By implementing the `Matcher` interface yourself,\n&gt; you can get all of the\n&gt;   above benefits for your own custom assertions.\n&gt;\n&gt; - For a more thorough description of these points, see [Joe Walnes&#39;s\n&gt;   original post][walnes].\n&gt;\n&gt; We have decided to include this API directly in JUnit.\n&gt; It&#39;s an extensible and readable syntax, and it enables\n&gt; new features, like [assumptions][] and [theories][].\n&gt;\n&gt; [assumptions]: #assumptions\n&gt; [theories]: #theories\n&gt;\n&gt; Some notes:\n&gt;\n&gt; - The old assert methods are never, ever, going away.  Developers may\n&gt;   continue using the old `assertEquals`, `assertTrue`, and so on.\n&gt; - The second parameter of an `assertThat` statement is a `Matcher`.\n&gt;   We include the Matchers we want as static imports, like this:\n&gt;\n&gt;         import static org.hamcrest.CoreMatchers.is;\n&gt;\n&gt;   or:\n&gt;\n&gt;         import static org.hamcrest.CoreMatchers.*;\n&gt;\n&gt; - Manually importing `Matcher` methods can be frustrating.  [Eclipse\n&gt; 3.3][] includes the ability to\n&gt;   define\n&gt;   &quot;Favorite&quot; classes to import static methods from, which makes it easier\n&gt;   (Search for &quot;Favorites&quot; in the Preferences dialog).\n&gt;   We expect that support for static imports will improve in all Java\n&gt; IDEs in the future.\n&gt;\n&gt; [Eclipse 3.3]: http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/\n&gt;\n&gt; - To allow compatibility with a wide variety of possible matchers,\n&gt;   we have decided to include the classes from hamcrest-core,\n&gt;   from the [Hamcrest][] project.  This is the first time that\n&gt;   third-party classes have been included in JUnit.\n&gt;\n&gt; [Hamcrest]: http://code.google.com/p/hamcrest/\n&gt;\n&gt; - JUnit currently ships with a few matchers, defined in\n&gt;   `org.hamcrest.CoreMatchers` and `org.junit.matchers.JUnitMatchers`.\n&gt;   To use many, many more, consider downloading the [full hamcrest package][].\n&gt;\n&gt; [full hamcrest package]:\n&gt; http://hamcrest.googlecode.com/files/hamcrest-all-1.1.jar\n&gt;\n&gt; - JUnit contains special support for comparing string and array\n&gt;   values, giving specific information on how they differ.  This is not\n&gt;   yet available using the `assertThat` syntax, but we hope to bring\n&gt;   the two assert methods into closer alignment in future releases.\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;a name=&quot;assumptions&quot; /&gt;\n&gt; ### Assumptions ###\n&gt;\n&gt; Ideally, the developer writing a test has control of all of the forces\n&gt; that might cause a test to fail.\n&gt; If this isn&#39;t immediately possible, making dependencies explicit can\n&gt; often improve a design.\n&gt; For example, if a test fails when run in a different locale than the\n&gt; developer intended,\n&gt; it can be fixed by explicitly passing a locale to the domain code.\n&gt;\n&gt; However, sometimes this is not desirable or possible.\n&gt; It&#39;s good to be able to run a test against the code as it is currently written,\n&gt; implicit assumptions and all, or to write a test that exposes a known bug.\n&gt; For these situations, JUnit now includes the ability to express &quot;assumptions&quot;:\n&gt;\n&gt;     import static org.junit.Assume.*\n&gt;\n&gt;     @Test public void filenameIncludesUsername() {\n&gt;        assumeThat(File.separatorChar, is(&#39;/&#39;));\n&gt;        assertThat(new User(&quot;optimus&quot;).configFileName(),\n&gt; is(&quot;configfiles/optimus.cfg&quot;));\n&gt;     }\n&gt;\n&gt;     @Test public void correctBehaviorWhenFilenameIsNull() {\n&gt;        assumeTrue(bugFixed(&quot;13356&quot;));  // bugFixed is not included in JUnit\n&gt;        assertThat(parse(null), is(new NullDocument()));\n&gt;     }\n&gt;\n&gt; With this release, a failed assumption will lead to the test being\n&gt; marked as passing,\n&gt; regardless of what the code below the assumption may assert.\n&gt; In the future, this may change, and a failed assumption may lead to\n&gt; the test being ignored:\n&gt; however, third-party runners do not currently allow this option.\n&gt;\n&gt; We have included `assumeTrue` for convenience, but thanks to the\n&gt; inclusion of Hamcrest, we do not need to create `assumeEquals`,\n&gt; `assumeSame`, and other analogues to the `assert*` methods.  All of\n&gt; those functionalities are subsumed in `assumeThat`, with the appropriate\n&gt; matcher.\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;a name=&quot;theories&quot; /&gt;\n&gt; ### Theories ###\n&gt;\n&gt; More flexible and expressive assertions, combined with the ability to\n&gt; state assumptions clearly, lead to a new kind of statement of intent,\n&gt; which we call a &quot;Theory&quot;.  A test captures the intended behavior in\n&gt; one particular scenario.  A theory captures some aspect of the\n&gt; intended behavior in possibly\n&gt; infinite numbers of potential scenarios.  For example:\n&gt;\n&gt;     @RunWith(Theories.class)\n&gt;     public class UserTest {\n&gt;       @DataPoint public static String GOOD_USERNAME = &quot;optimus&quot;;\n&gt;       @DataPoint public static String USERNAME_WITH_SLASH = &quot;optimus/prime&quot;;\n&gt;\n&gt;       @Theory public void filenameIncludesUsername(String username) {\n&gt;         assumeThat(username, not(containsString(&quot;/&quot;)));\n&gt;         assertThat(new User(username).configFileName(),\n&gt; containsString(username));\n&gt;       }\n&gt;     }\n&gt;\n&gt; This makes it clear that the user&#39;s filename should be included in the\n&gt; config file name, only if it doesn&#39;t contain a slash.  Another test\n&gt; or theory might define what happens when a username does contain a slash.\n&gt;\n&gt; `UserTest` will attempt to run `filenameIncludesUsername` on\n&gt; every compatible `DataPoint` defined in the class.  If any of the\n&gt; assumptions fail, the data point is silently ignored.  If all of the\n&gt; assumptions pass, but an assertion fails, the test fails.\n&gt;\n&gt; The support for Theories has been absorbed from the [Popper][]\n&gt; project, and [more complete documentation][popper-docs] can be found\n&gt; there.\n&gt;\n&gt; [Popper]: http://popper.tigris.org\n&gt; [popper-docs]: http://popper.tigris.org/tutorial.html\n&gt;\n&gt; Defining general statements in this way can jog the developer&#39;s memory\n&gt; about other potential data points and tests, also allows [automated\n&gt; tools][junit-factory] to [search][my-blog] for new, unexpected data\n&gt; points that expose bugs.\n&gt;\n&gt; [junit-factory]: http://www.junitfactory.org\n&gt; [my-blog]: http://shareandenjoy.saff.net/2007/04/popper-and-junitfactory.html\n&gt;\n&gt; ### Other changes ###\n&gt;\n&gt; This release contains other bug fixes and new features.  Among them:\n&gt;\n&gt; - Annotated descriptions\n&gt;\n&gt;   Runner UIs, Filters, and Sorters operate on Descriptions of test\n&gt;   methods and test classes.  These Descriptions now include the\n&gt;   annotations on the original Java source element, allowing for richer\n&gt;   display of test results, and easier development of annotation-based\n&gt;   filters.\n&gt;\n&gt; - Bug fix (1715326): assertEquals now compares all Numbers using their\n&gt;   native implementation of `equals`.  This assertion, which passed in\n&gt;   4.3, will now fail:\n&gt;\n&gt;         assertEquals(new Integer(1), new Long(1));\n&gt;\n&gt;   Non-integer Numbers (Floats, Doubles, BigDecimals, etc),\n&gt;   which were compared incorrectly in 4.3, are now fixed.\n&gt;\n&gt; - `assertEquals(long, long)` and `assertEquals(double, double)` have\n&gt;   been re-introduced to the `Assert` class, to take advantage of\n&gt;   Java&#39;s native widening conversions.  Therefore, this still passes:\n&gt;\n&gt;         assertEquals(1, 1L);\n&gt;\n&gt; - The default runner for JUnit 4 test classes has been refactored.\n&gt;   The old version was named `TestClassRunner`, and the new is named\n&gt;   `JUnit4ClassRunner`.  Likewise, `OldTestClassRunner` is now\n&gt;   `JUnit3ClassRunner`.  The new design allows variations in running\n&gt;   individual test classes to be expressed with fewer custom classes.\n&gt;   For a good example, see the source to\n&gt;   `org.junit.experimental.theories.runner.api.Theories`.\n&gt;\n&gt; - The rules for determining which runner is applied by default to a\n&gt;   test class have been simplified:\n&gt;\n&gt;   1. If the class has a `@RunWith` annotation, the annotated runner\n&gt;      class is used.\n&gt;\n&gt;   2. If the class can be run with the JUnit 3 test runner (it\n&gt;      subclasses `TestCase`, or contains a `public static Test suite()`\n&gt;      method), JUnit38ClassRunner is used.\n&gt;\n&gt;   3. Otherwise, JUnit4ClassRunner is used.\n&gt;\n&gt;   This default guess can always be overridden by an explicit\n&gt;   `@RunWith(JUnit4ClassRunner.class)` or\n&gt;   `@RunWith(JUnit38ClassRunner.class)` annotation.\n&gt;\n&gt;   The old class names `TestClassRunner` and `OldTestClassRunner`\n&gt;   remain as deprecated.\n&gt;\n&gt; - Bug fix (1739095): Filters and Sorters work correctly on test\n&gt;   classes that contain a `suite` method like:\n&gt;\n&gt;         public static junit.framework.Test suite() {\n&gt;           return new JUnit4TestAdapter(MyTest.class);\n&gt;         }\n&gt;\n&gt; - Bug fix (1745048): @After methods are now correctly called\n&gt;   after a test method times out.\n&gt;\n\n",
