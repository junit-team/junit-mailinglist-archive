You can then call them from JUnit style test<br/>\nmethods that assert(...) things about the returned values. Then you get<br/>\nyour methods in the form you want and can use JUnit for its ability to<br/>\ncatalog and automatically execute tests, as well as assert and log state<br/>\nwhere it is appropriate.<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\nOutgoing mail is certified Virus Free.<br/>\nChecked by AVG anti-virus system (http://www.grisoft.com).<br/>\nVersion: 6.0.489 / Virus Database: 288 - Release Date: 6/10/2003</div>",
