I&#39;m a 16-year-old high school student at Troy <br/>\n&gt; High School, in Fullerton, CA (Class of &#39;05).  Over the past half-<br/>\n&gt; year or so, I have been working with my AP Computer Science teacher, <br/>\n&gt; Dave Wittry, on a project to make JUnit testing more accessible to <br/>\n&gt; both teachers and students called JAM*Tester (JUnit Auto-Matic <br/>\n&gt; Tester).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We just recently released the Student Version of our tool, which may <br/>\n&gt; be useful to more than just students.  Its goal is to aid in the <br/>\n&gt; creation of JUnit TestCases.  It also runs the tests and reports <br/>\n&gt; JUnit results.  Additionally, it provides some code-coverage <br/>\n&gt; reporting, which can be extremely useful (fyi: code-coverage provided <br/>\n&gt; in part by Clover <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.thecortex.net/clover)\">http://www.thecortex.net/clover)</a>.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Additionally, we have the Teacher Version of the tool.  The idea <br/>\n&gt; behind this is that a Teacher can create a battery of tests for their <br/>\n&gt; students&#39; labs (possibly using the Student Version), and then <br/>\n&gt; automatically compile and run the tests for all of their students at <br/>\n&gt; once.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If you&#39;re interested, please come to our website, <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.jamtester.com\">http://www.jamtester.com</a>  We would appreciate any feedback you may <br/>\n&gt; have for us.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks in advance for your support,<br/>\n&gt; David<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
