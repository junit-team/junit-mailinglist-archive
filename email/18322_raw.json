In my current s=\r\nituation, I\nwant to write two tests:\n1) is a standard operation test where =\r\nit loads a file and makes sure\neverything was sent properly to Oracle.\n2) i=\r\ns a specialized test where it loads a file and checks to see if\nthe site co=\r\nde was capitalized in Oracle.\n\nSo my question is this, should I use individ=\r\nual files for each test\n(i.e., one file containing many lines of site data =\r\nfor the first test\nand then a seperate file containing a single line with a=\r\n lowercase\nsite code) and load each file at the start of each test, or shou=\r\nld I\ncombine the data from both into a single file and load that before all=\r\n\nthe tests are run (using a @BeforeClass)?\n\nThank you in advance.\n\n\n\n",
