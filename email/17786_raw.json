But you could have safely assumed that\n&gt; anyone asking for use of Junit for web services would necessarily\n&gt; have common sense of using any of the major search engines. Instead\n&gt; of sermons on helping me exercise search engine skills, some\n&gt; concrete info would have been more useful (for example, look at\n&gt; other responses on this topic).\n\nOh, you&#39;ve gotta love this. Someone who dumps a quick &quot;please give me\ninfo about testing web services&quot; email, is now taking me to task about\nnot making dramatically unlikely assumptions about their level of\nknowledge.\n\nThe vast majority of emails that come through this list of the type\n&quot;pls u snd me junit info thnx&quot; are from folks who have not used a\nsearch engine and who are lazy beyond belief. These folks are welcome\nto receive help when they start following the advice in ESR&#39;s &quot;asking\nsmart questions&quot;. For the record, I also suggest that you read it. You\ngave no indication that you had ever touched a search engine. You gave\nno indication that you knew anything about web services beyond the\ncorrect spelling of the words. Here&#39;s the link (see, I can be\nhelpful):\n\nhttp://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html\n\nI also noticed quite a large number of useful looking links when I\ngoogled for &quot;testing web services junit&quot;. If I could find them, I have\nno idea why you couldn&#39;t.\n\nSimon\n\n-- \nwww.simonpeter.org\n\n",
