That way I tested my code \nat the same time I was learning how to use the 3rd party API. I&#39;ve been \nworking this way more or less satisfactorily. \n\nBut somethig feels wrong with it, when I test this way I have less confidence \nthan with my other classes which are really unit tested. Also, when a test \nfails it&#39;s significantly harder to find the error because I don&#39;t know if it \nis in the code or in my understanding of the API.\n\nRecently, I read about Learning Tests and have started using them for the \nabove situation. Now I&#39;m starting to do this:\n1) Make Learning Tests of the 3rd party API I&#39;m about to use until I \nunderstand completely the part I&#39;m about to use.\n2) Make unit tests of my code which uses the 3rd party API in a regular TDD \nstyle. This tests can now do more intensive checking such as that the correct \ncalls to the 3rd party API are being done.\n\nUnfortunately, I&#39;ve not found a way to do this everytime, because the 3rd \nparty API must have MockObjects or they must be easy to construct, which is \nnot always true.\n\nSome other side effects of using Learning Tests before using 3rd party APIs \nare:\n- They serve as documentation for other developers of the team. When many of \nthe team developers use this technique, you end up with a very useful \nautotested library of examples of the 3rd party API.\n- They help to spot the differences in behaviour when there is a new version \nof the 3rd party API.\n\nCheers,\n\tJorge\n\n\n",
