Much of the  \njava code can be written and tested in a J2SE environment.  A willing  \ndesigner could even create mockups of the ME environment sufficient  \nto allow considerable test coverage in the host environment.\n\nI have customers who complete the testing connection to their  \nembedded devices by writing unit tests on the host environment that  \nmake calls over a USB connection to a simple little program on the  \ndevice that then knows how to call into the embedded application.   \nThink of it as a very poor man&#39;s RPC.\n\nAgain, where there is a will, there is a way.\n\n\n----\nRobert C.
