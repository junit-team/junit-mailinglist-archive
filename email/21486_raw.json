If there is\n&gt; interest, I would be happy to contribute a =\r\npatch to the JUnit project\n&gt; to address it. On the other hand, if there is =\r\na way to solve this\n&gt; problem differently in JUnit already, please let me k=\r\nnow.\n&gt;\n&gt; Ant and IDEA (the IDE from Intellij) don&#39;t agree on how to gather\n=\r\n&gt; classes for test. IDEA inspects the actual class for things that\n&gt; extend=\r\n TestCase or have a JUnit annotation on the class (or have a\n&gt; static suite=\r\n method) and executes the test. Ant gathers tests via\n&gt; class names. To use=\r\n the Ant method with JUnit outside of Ant, you can\n&gt; use JUnitCore, and jus=\r\nt pass it an array of classes gathered in the\n&gt; Ant form. However IDEA does=\r\nn&#39;t report those results in its typical\n&gt; fashion. It uses its own custom r=\r\nunner to gather and run these tests.\n&gt;\n&gt; The only option I see in the JUnit=\r\n current code is to make a custom\n&gt; runner that knows how to extract a Clas=\r\ns[] array and pass it on to the\n&gt; standard runner, and then use the RunWith=\r\n tag to annotate an arbitrary\n&gt; class to get IDEA to think that it is runni=\r\nng a test suite. I haven&#39;t\n&gt; actually done this to see if IDEA has any issu=\r\nes, but it seems like it\n&gt; should work.\n&gt;\n&gt; My proposal is to add an annota=\r\ntion to the Suite class called\n&gt; SuiteMethod that would annotate a method t=\r\nhat returns a Class[] array.\n&gt; The Suite would then be built from the two a=\r\nnnotations,\n&gt; Suite.SuiteClasses plus any methods on the class (we could en=\r\nforce\n&gt; that they be public, static, take no parameters and return a Class[=\r\n]\n&gt; array) that are annotated with Suite.SuiteMethod and build the Suite\n&gt; =\r\nas a combination of all of the Arrays returned.\n&gt;\n&gt; What do you think?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
