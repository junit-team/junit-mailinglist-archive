It is not clear to me that AfterClass would be called in this case (a Suite with no @Test in it).<br/>\n<br/>\nBeforeClass and AfterClass are also static methods and the functionality I need to implement is once per instance, not once for all instances.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s unlikely that my test suite would ever be run more than once in the same JVM so I could probably make BeforeClass and AfterClass work - if AfterClass is guaranteed to be run after the Suite is finished.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs there a pattern in JUnit for BeforeSuite and AfterSuite functionality?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks.</div>",
