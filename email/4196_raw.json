Imagine you want to compare a collection of \nvalues.  Normally, you iterate through and test each one.  Problem is \nthe first failure is all you get with JUnit, not giving you a clear \npicture usually and forcing you to step outside the framework to \nunderstand what&#39;s really going on.  You can put this into multiple \ntests, but then the framework isn&#39;t working for you any longer.  It&#39;s \nactually hindering your progress.  I ended up modifying JUnit to allow \nfor multiple failures and am much happier having the option of fail-fast \nversus many failures, choosing one over the other where appropriate.\n\nhttp://www.gnufoo.org/junit/index.html#failures\n\n-shane\n\nOn Friday, February 22, 2002, at 12:57  PM, Chris Eppstein wrote:\n\n&gt; A very simple approach to this is to use multiple test methods (one for\n&gt; each\n&gt; assertion that requires a result).

[mailto:jhoepner@...]\n&gt; Sent: Friday, February 22, 2002 10:13 AM\n&gt; To: Junit (E-mail)\n&gt; Subject: [junit] multiple assertions\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello all,\n&gt;\n&gt; I am fairly new to JUnit and I have come across a problem while writing\n&gt; test\n&gt; cases.  I am in a situation where I require one test case to have\n&gt; multiple\n&gt; assertions.  If one of these assertions fails, I still need the others\n&gt; to\n&gt; run.  I&#39;m sure someone else has tried something like this in the past,\n&gt; does\n&gt; anyone have any suggestions?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt;\n&gt; Josh Hoepner\n&gt; Great Lakes Technologies Group\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
