I would rather run all the tests less frequently than the\n&gt; wrong tests frequently. If some of the tests are expensive to execute,\n&gt; then move them to CruiseControl and let them run every 10 minutes. It&#39;s\n&gt; not great, but it&#39;s better than nothing. At least you&#39;ll know within 10\n&gt; minutes of checking code in whether it broke a slow test. Moving a slow\n&gt; test into the &quot;slow test&quot; suite isn&#39;t much maintenance.\n&gt; --\n&gt; J. B.
