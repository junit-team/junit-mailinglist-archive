Your sen=\r\ntence didn&#39;t immediately ring understanding with me.\n\nBasically, what I am =\r\nrequesting, is that I&#39;d like to annotate some random method on some random =\r\nclass anywhere in the project with some annotation like @AfterTestRun - so =\r\nthat when I run either one single test class, or a package, or the entire p=\r\nroject, with the Eclipse runner, this specific method would be invoked afte=\r\nr the requested test(s) are run.\n\nSo: How do I accomplish that with &quot;@After=\r\nClass on a suite&quot;?\n\nDo I have to annotate all my test classes with some spe=\r\ncific Suite-annotation? That would be doable. However, it would be just as =\r\nawkward as I do with my logging init: Having to do some boilerplate bs on e=\r\nvery single test class - only that forgetting to do this would not give me =\r\nany immediate indication, as with the logging init; For the logging init, I=\r\n immediately see if I have forgotten those three boilerplate lines (&quot;static=\r\n { TestHelper.setupLogging() }&quot;), because log4j spews out some noise on Std=\r\n.err if any part of the system starts to log on an uninitialized logging sy=\r\nstem.\n\n&gt; \n&gt;    David Saff\n&gt; \n&gt; On Thu, Nov 19, 2009 at 7:09 AM, stolsvik &lt;o=\r\nnline@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; I need some way to run a certain test after all other=\r\n tests.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I run my tests in Eclipse, and do not yet have a build syst=\r\nem outside of it. I understand that had I done this programmatically, I cou=\r\nld have attached a RunListener, implementing the testRunFinished(Result) me=\r\nthod.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Is there any way to achieve a similar effect within the JUnit=\r\n runner in Eclipse?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Rationale: I have actual unit tests, then bigge=\r\nr tests, then full-fledged &quot;integration tests&quot; or whatever one call them, w=\r\nhere I take up my entire application-local server thingy and process a bunc=\r\nh of items, letting JUnit check after the dust settles whether the items wa=\r\ns processed correctly. However, the internals are multi threaded, and also,=\r\n this being a Swing app, lots of Runnables are sent over to the EDT. This i=\r\ns all good.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; However, I&#39;ve sometimes seen that a thread crashes (unc=\r\naught exception), without this being noticed by any of the tests running (I=\r\n&#39;ve e.g. seen a ConcurrentModificationException take down the EDT, without =\r\nhaving a clue as to why I got that - and the next event posted just brings =\r\nup a new EDT, so I get a green bar, but with an uncaught error). What I&#39;d w=\r\nant to achieve, is to install an uncaught exception handler, and then, as a=\r\n final step to ALL permutations of tests (e.g. both for a single unit test,=\r\n and also for the project-wide test run), run a test that checks whether an=\r\ny thread-killing exception was caught by the handler, and if so, fails the =\r\nrun. (I&#39;d throw the exception that was caught, and in any case also log-dum=\r\np any and all such exceptions).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; (As a very similar question, I&#39;d al=\r\nso like to have a &quot;before any tests&quot; thing, like the RunListener.testRunSta=\r\nrted(Description) method, where I could set up logging. Now I do that by le=\r\ntting ALL tests have a static block that calls a specific static method whi=\r\nch has a static boolean that tells whether the log system already is set up=\r\n. This also works just nicely, but is a hassle nevertheless. However, it is=\r\n not possible, as I see it, to solve the above question in the same manner.=\r\n)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
