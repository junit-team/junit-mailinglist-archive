B. Rainsberger&quot; &lt;jbrains762@...&gt;\r\n\r\n&gt;Are folks worried about accidentally leaving asserts out of methods,\n&gt;or about evil programmers boosting their test count by writing bogus\n&gt;tests?\n\nFrom what I can tell, more of the first than the second. I was never \nconcerned about either; however, it seems like some folks are concerned \nabout writing a test, being interrupted part way through, then forgetting to \nassert something.\n\nLet me share my experience with this. The most common mistake I make is \nthis:\n\npublic void testNullParameters() {\n    try {\n        A a = new A(null);\n    }\n    catch (IllegalArgumentException success) {\n    }\n}\n\nThis test passes, even though I know I didn&#39;t write the exception throwing \ncode. So I curse myself, add the fail() statement and move on. The great \nthing is that it only takes 15 seconds to verify that I made a mistake. Mind \nyou, this is a simple case, so you may experience different things. Counting \nassertions likely would not have helped me there.\n\nIf you&#39;re concerned about forgetting to assert, try this:\n\npublic void testMethod() {\n    fail(&quot;NYI&quot;);   // &quot;Not yet implemented&quot;\n}\n\nThe rule is: don&#39;t remove the fail statement until you&#39;re satisfied that the \ntest is correct. Do this until you don&#39;t forget to assert something as \noften. I guess this is a &quot;study&quot; within test-first programming. :)\n\nJBR.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp\n\n\n",
