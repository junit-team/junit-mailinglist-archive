I&#39;ve used it a bit in IBM VAJ, and<br/>\n&gt; really like it so far, but it would be great if I could interact with<br/>\n&gt; other users of this software, since alot of aspects of usage are<br/>\n&gt; still pretty unclear.  But I cannot seem to find link or button in<br/>\n&gt; the SourceForge page for posting to the list from the list archive<br/>\n&gt; page, even though the preceeding page clearly says &#39;Choose a list to<br/>\n&gt; browse, search, and post messages&#39;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I realize I may very well be missing something very simple that when<br/>\n&gt; explained to me will make me feel quite dumb.  On the other hand, I<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t see very many postings in that public user list, so perhaps<br/>\n&gt; something there is broken?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Is anyone else having similar frustrations, or is it just me?  The<br/>\n&gt; EasyMock alternative, I think, requires jdk 1.3, which IBM VAJ does<br/>\n&gt; not yet support, so I was hoping to bank on the MockObjects framework<br/>\n&gt; to provide much needed help in building my unit-tests.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
