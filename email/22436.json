They&#39;re drop-in replacements of each other. You&#39;re <br/>\n&gt; kind-of saying that &quot;select is broken&quot;, which is why I&#39;m just saying no.<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m repeatedly saying &quot;learn to walk before you run&quot;, and I&#39;m not sure <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m getting across clearly.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I assume you&#39;re starting firefox and not IE ? Maybe you should try to <br/>\n&gt; run 1 instance of DefaultSelenium in two different VM; in that way you <br/>\n&gt; can assert that 1 node works properly and<br/>\n&gt; just add more nodes.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You&#39;ll honestly have to talk to the people on the selenium mailing list <br/>\n&gt; about grid. I tried it once, and it worked concurrently but not at the <br/>\n&gt; level of stability<br/>\n&gt; we required - which is high.
