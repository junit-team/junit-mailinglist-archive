Such testing is especially important in the \npresence of java generics -- you want to be sure that some data types, \nsuch as in method parameters, compile correctly, but others result in a \ncompile error.  Testing these cases by hand defeats the whole purpose of \nunit testing.\n\nIs there any way to test for a compile time error in a JUnit test?  Is \nthis something that would be impossible to add?\n\njunit@yahoogroups.com wrote:\n\n&gt; \n&gt; There are 5 messages in this issue.\n&gt; \n&gt; Topics in this digest:\n&gt; \n&gt;    1.

How do you refactor to eliminate a dependency on\n&gt;&gt;member objects. I understand how to do it with objects a class\n&gt;&gt;collaborates with, but it is a different matter when the member\n&gt;&gt;objects are &quot;owned&quot; by the object being tested. I guess you could\n&gt;&gt;provide the class with a factory class it could use to create it&#39;s\n&gt;&gt;members, but this seems like a lot of overhead for an object that only\n&gt;&gt;needs this capability for testing purposes.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;I am a new java programmer, so forgive me if my terminology isn&#39;t\n&gt;&gt;correct.

As a matter\n&gt; of fact, we brought Kent Beck on board as an Agitar Fellow a couple of\n&gt; years ago.  I also gave 2 JavaOne presentation on JUnit (not\n&gt; Agitator); one in 2004 and the last one just last week where I\n&gt; co-presented with Kent Beck himself.  Agitator takes full advantage of\n&gt; any existing JUnit tests and our Dashboard product is also fully\n&gt; integrated with JUnit.\n&gt; \n&gt; So, don&#39;t think in terms of JUnit vs. Agitator, but in terms of what\n&gt; can Agitator do to complement my JUnit and TDD efforts.  Of course, I\n&gt; believe it can do a lot - but I am hardly an impartial party :-).\n&gt; \n&gt; JUnit is great for TDD which, as some people noted, is more about\n&gt; design than testing.  It&#39;s also great for crafting very specific test\n&gt; cases where you can use your intuition and understanding of the domain\n&gt; space and implementation to cover interesting scenarios and sequences.\n&gt; \n&gt; Agitator is great for exploratory testing, subjecting your code to all\n&gt; sorts of inputs - both valid and invalid - which helps you think about\n&gt; corner cases and conditions that you might have overlooked. It&#39;s also\n&gt; uniquely capable in discovering and enforcing class and method\n&gt; invariants (i.e. properties of the code that should *always* be true -\n&gt; as opposed to the more specific cases people typically write in JUnit).\n&gt; \n&gt; Bottom line:  Think in terms of JUnit + Agitator and not JUnit vs.\n&gt; Agitator.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; \n&gt; Alberto Savoia\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;davek725&quot; &lt;david.kissinger@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt;My company is currently doing TDD and using JUnit for our unit \n&gt;&gt;testing - both persistence testing and business logic testing.  We \n&gt;&gt;are now looking at Agitator and trying to determine if, and how, it \n&gt;&gt;fits into our current practices.  I was wondering how others have \n&gt;&gt;decided to use Agitator (or not use it).  Some of the issues we are \n&gt;&gt;struggling with:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;1.  Agitator looks like it can eliminate the need to write most JUnit \n&gt;&gt;tests (except true persistence testing).  The downside is that we \n&gt;&gt;would be left with only Agitator config files that contain our \n&gt;&gt;business logic assertions.  This seems like a big leap to take, given \n&gt;&gt;that if Agitar goes away, we have no JUnit.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;2.  Agitator mocks and factories look easy to create, but look like \n&gt;&gt;they are only useful in the context of Agitator.  I couldn&#39;t use them \n&gt;&gt;for other purposes (e.g. Fitnesse, JUnit).\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;3.  Having my business logic tests in JUnit means they are in an \n&gt;&gt;understood format and things such as inputs and expected results are \n&gt;&gt;clearly visible and grouped with each test.  My impression of \n&gt;&gt;Agitator is that this wouldn&#39;t be as clear.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; \n&gt; Message 4 \n&gt;     From: &quot;albsavoia&quot; albsavoia@...\n&gt;     Date: Sun May 28, 2006 10:24am(PDT) \n&gt; Subject: Re: JUnit vs. Agitator\n&gt; \n&gt; J.B. Writes:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;&gt;Also, Agitator can help retrofit tests to legacy code, however it \n&gt;&gt;/doesn&#39;t/ help you identify the specific design problems in that code, \n&gt;&gt;nor does it motivate you to improve the design. This might or might not \n&gt;&gt;concern your team at this time.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; This is Alberto jumping in again to set the record straight on\n&gt; Agitator ...\n&gt; \n&gt; Hi Joe, you might not remember me but we exchanged emails a couple of\n&gt; years ago, and I am a big fan of yours for all the work you have done\n&gt; to educate people about JUnit through your book and online presence.\n&gt; \n&gt; Anyway ... your description of using Agitator to complement TDD is\n&gt; spot-on (for people who do TDD) - thank you for jumping in and helping\n&gt; in setting the record straight.  But you also state (I paraphrase):\n&gt; &quot;Agitator does not help you identify design problems or motivate you\n&gt; to improve the design&quot;.  We have actually found, somewhat\n&gt; serendipitously, that Agitator does indeed help you in identifying\n&gt; design problems and even provides you compelling motivations to\n&gt; address them (e.g. well designed code Agitates better).\n&gt; \n&gt; A simple example, of Agitator helping you improve your design is\n&gt; blogged on developertesting.com:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.developertesting.com/archives/month200402/20040226-TestDrivenDevelopmentAndAgitatorDrivenRefactoring.html\n&gt; \n&gt; Again, this does not mean that Agitator replaces TDD, but it can\n&gt; complement TDD efforts (our own Dashboard product was developed\n&gt; practicing TDD, pair-programming, etc., AND Agitator of course).\n&gt; \n&gt; Alberto\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; \n&gt; Message 5 \n&gt;     From: &quot;Shane Mingins&quot; shane.mingins@...\n&gt;     Date: Sun May 28, 2006 1:14pm(PDT) \n&gt; Subject: Re: JUnit vs. Agitator\n&gt; \n&gt; On 5/27/06, albsavoia &lt;albsavoia@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;&gt;So, don&#39;t think in terms of JUnit vs. Agitator, but in terms of what\n&gt;&gt;can Agitator do to complement my JUnit and TDD efforts.

I get the impression that current thinking is that I could\n&gt; use Agitator instead of JUnit.  Now this may be correct  But I am wondering\n&gt; how correct?\n&gt; \n&gt; It could be correct in the same way that I could rub two sticks together\n&gt; instead of using matches or it could be correct in that I could use matches\n&gt; instead of a lighter.\n&gt; \n&gt; Or do you see Agitator complementing JUnit in the same way whether you are\n&gt; using TTD or not?\n&gt; \n&gt; My current thinking is the two tools solve slightly different problems ...\n&gt; or they address testing is different ways.  An example that comes to mind is\n&gt; in the Agitator tutorial.  In reaching full agitation the observation that\n&gt; the length of product name is less than 20 revealed a bug.  But as I saw\n&gt; that I thought ... but if I had a JUnit test testing the boundaries of name\n&gt; as specified would have been tested and that mistake highlighted\n&gt; immediately.  Anyhow at the moment I am thinking that developers should\n&gt; start with JUnit or JUnit + Agitator and not simply just Agitator.\n&gt; \n&gt; Your thoughts?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks\n&gt; Shane\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Yahoo!
