I just started using JUnit and TDD on this project\nI&#39;m working on. I am using MockObjects (I believe .9 version) through\nXDoclet to create a mock of an interface that the object I&#39;m testing\nuses. What I noticed is that introducing the call to mock.verify() in\nthe TestCase tearDown method masks exceptions that are thrown from\ntest methods. In other words if an unexpected exception occurs in a\ntest method it doesn&#39;t appear to show in the logs when the\nmock.verify() executes. Mind you, I am using the JUnit support out of\nIntelliJ Idea. However I don&#39;t think that is relevant to the problem.\nThe basics of my TestCase are as follows.\nclass MyTestCase\n{\n   private MyMock mock;\n\n   public void testMyMethod() throws UnExcpectedException\n   {\n      //Test logic here\n   }\n     public void setup()\n   {\n      mock = new MyMock();\n      //logic to set mock preconditions and expectations...\n   }\n     public void verify()\n   {\n      //This executes and thorws an exception that masks the real\nexception in the test method.\n      mock.verify();\n   }\n}\nWhen I don&#39;t use mocks then I can test and figure out problems rather\neasily because I propogate exceptions up to the JUnit framework where\nthe UI catches them and displays them accordingly. I&#39;m not sure if\nthis is the best practice which is why I&#39;m writing. Could someone\nguide me here?\n\n\n\n",
