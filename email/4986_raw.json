As for me stress\n&gt; testing is testing in conditions which are very close\n&gt; to &quot;production&quot;. Is it possible to call such a testing as &quot;unit&quot;\n&gt; testing? In most cases stresstests are to figure out how set of\n&gt; components works, this set may be distributed between server and\n&gt; client, between peers, and so on... but jUnit fundamently works on\n&gt; one machine. I think PRIMARILY jUnit is for testing of classes or\n&gt; small sets of components. Am I right?\n\nYes. Depending on what kind of system stress/load testing you are \ndoing, you may find JMeter useful. You can get it at \nhttp://jakarta.apache.org/jmeter/index.html\n\n-TJ\n\n\n\n\n",
