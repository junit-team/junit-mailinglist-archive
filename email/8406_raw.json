When inVAJava() returns true, the UI\n&gt; doesn&#39;t even give you a choice to use the reloading\n&gt; class loader.  Please make sure that the &quot;Reload\n&gt; classes every run&quot; checkbox is *not* checked and see\n&gt; if that makes things run correctly for you.  Again,\n&gt; I&#39;ve only peeked at the code but it looks to me like\n&gt; unchecking that option is what inVAJava() returning\n&gt; true forces to be the case.\n&gt; \n&gt; If the problem turns out to be the reloading class\n&gt; loader, then I suggest you spend a little time\n&gt; searching the Junit FAQ and the group archives because\n&gt; the topic comes up a lot.\n&gt; \n&gt; Rick\n&gt; \n&gt; --- ok_lilya &lt;lilya.jangirov@r...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Rick,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The reason why I want inVAJava() to return true, is\n&gt; &gt; so that\n&gt; &gt; JUnit will be able to run tests. (My own tests) When\n&gt; &gt; inVAJava() \n&gt; &gt; returns false or throws exception, the tests will\n&gt; &gt; not run.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; How do I know this? Well, I tried changing the\n&gt; &gt; inVAJava() method to \n&gt; &gt; return true and false. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thanks, \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Lily.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In junit@yahoogroups.com, Rick Berman\n&gt; &gt; &lt;rick.berman@a...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Throwing a class not found exception, catching it,\n&gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; then returning false is correct behavior for the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; method inVAJava().  The class isn&#39;t found because\n&gt; &gt; you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; aren&#39;t running inside of VAJ.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; You still haven&#39;t answered why you *want*\n&gt; &gt; inVAJava()\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to return true when you aren&#39;t inside the VAJ\n&gt; &gt; &gt; environment.  Once we know that, then perhaps we\n&gt; &gt; can\n&gt; &gt; &gt; get closer to addressing your issue.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Rick\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- ok_lilya &lt;lilya.jangirov@r...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rick,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I tried leaving out\n&gt; &gt; com.ibm.uvm.tools.DebugSupport\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from classpath but \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then what happens, it throws a class not found\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; exception and still \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t return true.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Lily.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
