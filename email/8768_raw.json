Rainsberger wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;So said jxingtang on 2003-07-22 --------------------\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;I do not know whether this is a duplicated question. I have a \nprogram \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;with large number of console output from different source. \nBasically, \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;I am using System.out.println(...). How could I verify those \noutputs \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;are correct? Thanks!\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; 1. Don&#39;t use System.out in your application directly. Your \napplication\n&gt; &gt;&gt; components should accept a PrintWriter as a parameter somewhere.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; 2. In your tests, substitute a PrintWriter wrapping a \nStringWriter in\n&gt; &gt;&gt; place of System.out. This is easy to verify.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;I agree with both of J. B.&#39;s points above.  However, at some \npoints in\n&gt; &gt;the past I have been obligated to use class libraries that write to\n&gt; &gt;System.out, and which I cannot change.  So, to test code that uses \nthese\n&gt; &gt;libraries, I&#39;ve found that I get a lot of mileage out of creating a\n&gt; &gt;little &quot;ConsoleTester&quot; helper class, which appears below.  The \nbasic\n&gt; &gt;idea is, in my unit test I create a ConsoleTester, then exercise \nthe\n&gt; &gt;code I want to test, then get the output that was written to \nSystem.out\n&gt; &gt;from the ConsoleTester and make assertions about it.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Again, please do not misunderstand:  I don&#39;t like this approach.  \nIn my\n&gt; &gt;own code, I do not write to System.out, and I recommend that others\n&gt; &gt;avoid doing so as well.\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;snip-code /&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; This looks good, although I have to question the use of a \nfinalizer. Does that really work? I would think that your test has to \ncall an explicit &quot;put the streams back the way they were&quot; method. \nRelying on finalize() is generally not a good thing.\n&gt; \n&gt; Take care.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; J.
