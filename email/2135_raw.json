My reason seems to be different\n&gt; from any of the others I&#39;ve seen.\n&gt;\n&gt; I don&#39;t give a hoot about the total number of assertions for whatever\n&gt; metrics purposes.  I do care about doing test-first coding appropriately.\n&gt;\n&gt; That means: code some context, code an assert.\n&gt; Make sure the assert fails.  Fix the assert.\n&gt; Add another assert to the same test method.\n&gt; Repeat until done with all things that assert against\n&gt; the given context for the test method.\n&gt;\n&gt; My problem is that my memory is poor, and I get\n&gt; distracted.  I just coded an assert and compiled.\n&gt; Or did I really compile?\n&gt; Drat, I forgot.\n&gt; Did I just add a new assert to the body of tests or did I not?\n&gt;\n&gt; The count of assertions would be something visual that would change so I\n&gt; could get *feedback* and not have to trust myself.  It&#39;s part of\n&gt; the reason\n&gt; there is a count of tests, anyway.\n&gt;\n&gt; What if instead of being a count, it was a simple visual symbol\n&gt; that showed,\n&gt; for a given test class, that there is now a new assert that is\n&gt; being run for\n&gt; the first time?\n&gt; (could be a royal pain to figure out... consider if asserts are changed\n&gt; or deleted)\n&gt;\n&gt; Or am I just slower than the majority of developers?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
