A test doe=\r\nsn&#39;t depend upon\n&gt;the\n&gt;side effects of a run of another, but (at some user =\r\ndetermined level) the\n&gt;run of one test ought depend upon the completion of =\r\nand success of another.\n\nOK, I think I&#39;m clear on your definition.\n\n&gt;&gt;     =\r\n When I wrote a few examples, I found that when one test depends on\n&gt;anothe=\r\nr\n&gt;(in your sense) there is\n&gt;&gt;      duplication in the tests. At a minimum,=\r\n the two tests make the same\n&gt;assertions.\n&gt;\n&gt;Ok, another example. I have a =\r\nclass that walks a classpath and generates\n&gt;listener events on things found=\r\n, I test that. I have a class that listens\n&gt;to\n&gt;such events to &quot;find&quot; thing=\r\ns that match a certain criterion, I test that.\n&gt;If\n&gt;the first class fails t=\r\no send events, then I ought not blame (or dig into)\n&gt;the second for not fin=\r\nding anything. The tests are (I believe) unit tests\n&gt;of\n&gt;each, without dupl=\r\nication.\n\nLet me parrot back so that I understand:\n\nTest A verifies that yo=\r\nu can successfully walk a classpath and decide whether to generate an event=\r\n based on the contents of the classpath.\n\nTest B verifies that on receiving=\r\n an event, something happens.\n\nThese tests are totally isolated from one an=\r\nother, as far as I can see. Why would you label Test B as dependent on Test=\r\n A?\n\nIf I were writing the tests, I would write Test A this way:\n\ntestGener=\r\nateEvents\n    classpathInfo =3D new ClasspathInfo();    // a description of=\r\n what&#39;s on the classpath, without talking to a classpath to get it\n    even=\r\ntGenerator =3D new EventGenerator(classpathInfo);\n    eventCollector =3D ne=\r\nw EventCollector();    // implements your listener interface and just colle=\r\ncts the events\n    eventGenerator.addListener(eventCollector);\n    eventGen=\r\nerator.go();    // generate events\n\n    expectedEvents =3D ....;    // a li=\r\nst of the events you expect to generate for the above classpathInfo\n    ass=\r\nertEquals(expectedEvents, eventCollector.events());\n\nIn other words, verify=\r\n the expected events are generated from a given classpathInfo. This is an e=\r\nxcellent candidate for a parameterized test case.\n\nI would write Test B thi=\r\ns way:\n\ntestHandleEvents\n    eventHandler =3D new EventHandler();    // you=\r\nr &quot;thing finder&quot;, whatever it does\n\n    anEvent =3D new SomethingOnTheClass=\r\npathEvent();    // an event your event generator might generate\n\n    eventH=\r\nandler.onEvent(anEvent);\n    // assert something about what your event hand=\r\nler did with the event\n\nIn this case, handling the events and generating th=\r\ne events are tested in isolation. The failure of one has nothing at all to =\r\ndo with the other.\n\nSo, either:\n\n* I misunderstand your requirements, or\n* =\r\nThere is no dependency between these tests and we need a different example\n=\r\n\nYou tell me. :)\n\n&gt;&gt;      The closer an object is to the core of your appli=\r\ncation, the more\n&gt;important (I think) that failures in that &gt;      object y=\r\nell loudly and\n&gt;annoyingly.\n&gt;\n&gt;If one is goign to test, then any single tes=\r\nt failing is loud enough. Why\n&gt;get 50 random reports when one focused one w=\r\nould do?\n\nIf you&#39;re getting random reports then the design has big problems=\r\n: bigger than the issue we&#39;re discussing here. In this case, I can see temp=\r\norarily disabling doomed tests as a great refactoring aid, but it falls int=\r\no the same category as something like GSBase&#39;s OrderedTestSuite: I use it t=\r\no refactor myself out of a corner, but I&#39;m glad when I don&#39;t need it anymor=\r\ne.\n\n&gt;&gt;      If your project has a big problem with core classes failing on =\r\na\n&gt;regular\n&gt;&gt;      basis, then maybe you have a process/people problem, as =\r\nopposed to a\n&gt;technical problem.\n&gt;\n&gt;So junit is for folks who don&#39;t really =\r\nneed good testing? ;-)\n\nI realize you&#39;re joking, but I honestly don&#39;t see h=\r\now this follows. Let me clarify: if your core classes are failing on a regu=\r\nlar basis, then you need to concentrate on testing them and stop building n=\r\new code. (People problem: don&#39;t realize the core is rotten.) In this case, =\r\nI would suggest zeroing in on tests for the core classes and working on jus=\r\nt those for a while. Once this is done and the core classes work, your depe=\r\nndency issue goes from serious problem to mild annoyance *and* your system =\r\nis more stable.\n\nTake care.\n\n\nJ. B.
