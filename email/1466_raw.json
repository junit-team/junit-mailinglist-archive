Point well taken. back to the main track.\n\n\n    &gt; &gt; I wanted to point out the potential flaws of design and\n    &gt; &gt; testing that could otherwise be missed when you put tests in the\nsame\n    &gt; &gt; package as production code.  The production code should be tested in\nthe\n    &gt; &gt; same fashion it would be used by a client.  A test is a client in\nsome\n    &gt; &gt; degree.  In most cases clients exist outside of the package. \n    &gt; &gt; [..snip]\n    &gt; &gt; Thus,\n    &gt; &gt; I conclude, that testing the public interfaces of ALL objects (the\nkey being\n    &gt; &gt; ALL) should prove sufficient, thus not needing the tests to reside\nin the\n    &gt; &gt; same package as their associated production code objects.  Of\ncourse, there\n    &gt; &gt; are exceptions... we have ways around those.\n\n    &gt; In an ideal world, you&#39;re right. Testing *all* the public methods\nshould give you complete functional \n    &gt; coverage. \n    &gt; However:\n    &gt; 1. You might want to put more stress on some classes and less on\nothers. In this case, you might want to \n    &gt; test more then the public methods of critical-path components, and\nless of the peripherals.\n\nSo design the objects that way.  It will take a little more thought, a lot\nmore refactoring, but generally only one test-case :)\n\n    &gt; 2. You might want to access non-public methods in your setUp /\ntearDown.\n\nAgain, why?  No one has yet given me one concrete answer as to why this\nshould be.  It&#39;s all been ambiguous speculation.\n\n    &gt; 3. Sometimes the tested class needs a sophisticated context in runtime\n(EJB / Servlet). In this case, you \n    &gt; might want to short circuit it in testing by calling protected /\ndefault access methods that would be \n    &gt; called by the public interface in production mode.\n\nThis short circuiting could be avoided by mature mock objects and a good\ntesting framework for these contexts.\n\n    &gt; True, you might call all these &quot;exceptions&quot;. True, they deter from the\npure model. Still, they are \n    &gt; common, and are easily resolved by placing tests in the same package.\nOn the other hand, I don&#39;t see the \n    &gt; actual harm of doing so.\n\nBut, not so common as they need to be.  There will always be exceptions,\nmost likely, but they shouldn&#39;t become the norm simply because they make\nthings a little easier.  The old addage is, &quot;No pain, no gain.&quot;  If you\nsimply take the easy way out you design will absolutely suffer!  Again, I\nbelieve tests are a way to strengthen the design, not weaken it.\n\n    &gt; B.t.w., the right access mode for &quot;accessible in package only&quot; is\n&quot;default&quot;. &quot;protected&quot; makes it \n    &gt; accessible to both package members and subclassses.\n\nThanks.  I know that, but it&#39;s good to be corrected, especially when your\nmistakes are in writing.\n\nBTW: Just in case anyone is feeling slighted by my seemingly dogmatic\napproach -- it is not my intention to pick on anyone&#39;s person, but I don&#39;t\nmind pointing out what I think are flaws in the process :)  After all, what\nis this group for if we pander to people just so we don&#39;t hurt feelings and\nnever get to the bottoms of the issues.  ...just a friendly disclaimer from\nyour test-infected fellow.\n\n-Jason\n\n\n",
