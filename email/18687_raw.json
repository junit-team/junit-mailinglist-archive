I showed how in\nsome of the earlier posts with simple examples.  I\ncould make the examples more elaborate, but they would\njust be extensions of the simple example.  The\napproach is what is important.\n\nIt could be that you are thinking OK how does this\nscale with Database testing, Web Applications, etc.\nbut those are all specific testing domains with\nspecific method testing requirements that would be\ndesigned around the JSR&#39;s for those domains, just like\npmd provides rule sets for specific domains/JSRs (JSF,\netc.).\n\nCheers,\nOle\n\n\n\n\n\n--- &quot;J.

She fires up eclipse,\n&gt; &gt; creates a new class, and codes a method.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Just 1.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Then she selects the Eclipse menu (Hypothetical)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Test &gt; test\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; a src/main/test\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; directory within her project is automatically\n&gt; created\n&gt; &gt; with tests that cover her method exhaustively\n&gt; (100%).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; So when I say 0 time for the developer, I mean 0\n&gt; time\n&gt; &gt; coding the tests.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Now she reviews the tests. Could be that she finds\n&gt; &gt; that her method needs some tweaking, to further\n&gt; &gt; contrain it&#39;s behaviour. Then she regenerates the\n&gt; &gt; tests.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Etc.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Now I think the question becomes:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Well, how do we know the test is tested\n&gt; &gt; 100%/Exhaustively?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; This is where the part about reading some of the\n&gt; other\n&gt; &gt; stuff I wrote earlier in previous posts comes in.\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ll be glad to elaborate on those :-)\n&gt; \n&gt; I understand this better. It&#39;s a shame that such\n&gt; tools simply cannot \n&gt; exist beyond the very simplest methods. If it were\n&gt; so easy to do, it \n&gt; would be done. I&#39;m no complexity/computational\n&gt; theory expert, but from \n&gt; what I understand, there is very little any program\n&gt; can reason about the \n&gt; behavior of any other program, so the tool you\n&gt; describe above probably \n&gt; can&#39;t be useful for any non-trivial system.\n&gt; \n&gt; As for the question of whether the method is tested\n&gt; exhaustively, that \n&gt; depends on how well the test-generating code is\n&gt; tested... and then it&#39;s \n&gt; turtles all the way down: an infinite regression. It\n&gt; simply pushes the \n&gt; problem to the next programmer.\n&gt; -- \n&gt; J. B.
