This would drastically improve your turn\na=\r\nround time.\n\nI think this is something good.\n\nAs for using mocks,  I was of=\r\n the opinion that they double the work\ntoo.  Then I realized, the mock engi=\r\nne does most of the work for you,\nif you are using interfaces that is.  Bas=\r\nically you just insert the\nresponse from the mock object and you can forget=\r\n how the mock would\nimplement anything.  Saves me a lot of time once my co-=\r\nworkers and I\nagree upon the interfaces.  Which is where the work SHOULD be=\r\n.\n\nYes, you are going to fake the rest of the application.  However, If\nyou=\r\n are intending to test a separate application from your code, maybe\nyou sho=\r\nuld just test that application alone.  For me, I like to test\nthings as sim=\r\nply as possible.  You could also supply a mock of your\ncode to allow them t=\r\no test using your code.\n\nI see your point of needing acceptance and/or inte=\r\ngration tests.  They\nshould be there too.  But, maybe as a separate suite t=\r\nhat executes\nless often.  (Like if you make a release (used loosely of cour=\r\nse).)\n\nJust my 0.02$,\n\nBig Mike\n\nOn Mon, Aug 17, 2009 at 11:36 AM, Trenton =\r\nD. Adams&lt;trenta@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Lothar,\n&gt;\n&gt; First off, I wante=\r\nd to mention, a lot of my tests can be automated, albeit with delays or pol=\r\nling. But, I suppose what I could do, is create some code that does a DB in=\r\nsert/update, that simulates what the nightly job does, without actually doi=\r\nng all the work. In other words, take some data that I&#39;m expecting, and put=\r\n it in the DB, rather than actually &quot;generate&quot; the data. That way, I don&#39;t =\r\nneed the nightly job to be part of the testing cycle.\n&gt;\n&gt; Then, all the tes=\r\nts could run independently, and not rely on each other, but I could also ru=\r\nn them in order manually, to verify that the system actually works as a who=\r\nle. Then, I could actually have an &quot;OrderedTest&quot; that instantiates all my T=\r\nestCase classes, and calls them in order. That in itself would then be it&#39;s=\r\n own separate test.\n&gt;\n&gt; Does that sound like a good idea?\n&gt;\n&gt; Anyhow, I res=\r\npond to your comments below.\n&gt;\n&gt; ----- &quot;Lothar Kimmeringer&quot; &lt;maillists_job@=\r\nkimmeringer.de&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; From: &quot;Lothar Kimmeringer&quot; &lt;maillists_job@kimmeri=\r\nnger.de&gt;\n&gt;&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;&gt; Sent: Monday, August 17, 2009 1:27=\r\n:27 AM GMT -07:00 US/Canada Mountain\n&gt;&gt; Subject: Re: [junit] Dependency Tes=\r\nting\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; The reason I ask is because this is what is basic=\r\nally happening: There\n&gt;&gt; &gt; is an external ASYNCHRONOUS SOAP messaging syste=\r\nm that is the core to\n&gt;&gt; &gt; all communication between several companies. Req=\r\nuests/responses can be\n&gt;&gt; &gt; sent to and from all of the participating parti=\r\nes. For testing purposes,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; so that my tests can be a little more contro=\r\nlled, I send requests and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; responses to and from my own server. i.e. I =\r\ndo not send to other\n&gt;&gt; &gt; companies, because I cannot guarantee they will r=\r\nespond within the time\n&gt;&gt; &gt; I need (seconds), even though technically, thei=\r\nr test systems are\n&gt;&gt; &gt; supposed to be up and running.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; If you abstrac=\r\nted the layer between your applicaiton and the messaging\n&gt;&gt; system you can =\r\nsimply define a mock that answers the requests for you.\n&gt;&gt; That way you don=\r\n&#39;t need to setup anything in advance. I&#39;m doing this\n&gt;&gt; here e.g. for testi=\r\nng the parts of our software doing OFTP by ISDN.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yes, that would =\r\nbe possible, but also a whole heck of a lot of extra work. It would probabl=\r\ny double the code, perhaps even more. I was trying to keep my part of the a=\r\npplication simple. :D\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Also, by doing this, I am still circumventi=\r\nng the testing that actually tests to see if the system actually works. And=\r\n, I don&#39;t want to do that, as I want to be sure the system actually works, =\r\nand not just my code. I could do these little abstractions (with a factory,=\r\n that has test and production configurations), and that would test my code,=\r\n but it would not test that my code works with the other system, as I would=\r\n end up having a &quot;fake&quot; layer, pretending to be their system, but never act=\r\nually verifying.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; 1. submit request to my system, through =\r\nthe external system. This is\n&gt;&gt; &gt; effectively to test receiving requests fr=\r\nom the external system, to me.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; i.e. I can send requests to myself, as =\r\nif they were coming from someone\n&gt;&gt; &gt; else&#39;s system.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; 2. receive reques=\r\nt from external system\n&gt;&gt; &gt; 3. queue job for nightly build of data\n&gt;&gt; &gt; 4. =\r\ncheck for available data from nightly job, the next day\n&gt;&gt; &gt; 5. send availa=\r\nble data\n&gt;&gt; &gt; 6. receive the data sent in #5, and email it out to a staff m=\r\nember\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; For this I see Ant or Maven a better fitting tool than JUnit. T=\r\nhere\n&gt;&gt; you have dependencies and all the things you need for data-transfer=\r\n,\n&gt;&gt; emailing, etc.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I am using Maven, but maven isn&#39;t a testing t=\r\nool. However, it does support JUnit.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; So write an Ant script t=\r\nhat is preparing everything as needed and\n&gt;&gt; start e.g. the JUnit-tests tha=\r\nt do the testing. With the optional\n&gt;&gt; tasks junit and junitreport you even=\r\n end up with a nice HTML-page\n&gt;&gt; similar to a Java-API documentation showin=\r\ng you what tests failed\n&gt;&gt; and what succeeded. Combined e.g. with Cobertura=\r\n you can see what\n&gt;&gt; parts of your application aren&#39;t under test.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Reg=\r\nards, Lothar\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; __\n&gt; =A0 =A0This communication is intended for the u=\r\nse of the recipient to whom it\n&gt; =A0 =A0is addressed, and may contain confi=\r\ndential, personal, and or privileged\n&gt; =A0 =A0information.
