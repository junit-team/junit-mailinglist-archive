I prefer starting from what is _really_ needed, and then<br/>\n&gt;&gt; think about what is the best way to fulfill those concrete needs.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sometimes to instant start working is good, but sometimes start thinking<br/>\n&gt; first is mutch better ;-) Try to make a &#39;big step&#39; can lead you make<br/>\n&gt; become to wallow.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I prefer to start step-by-step (feature-by-feature) and if we have a<br/>\n&gt; significant count of features we should release it as next version. The<br/>\n&gt; remaining feature request are then the job for the version 3 of that<br/>\n&gt; specification. I do not want the community to wait for 2 more years for<br/>\n&gt; release 2.0. So a combined workflow would be good.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; A good process can be to collect the ideas (for not more than 14 days).<br/>\n&gt; Then review and summarize it. And start a voting to collect what feature<br/>\n&gt; is most desired by the community.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; After voting we should define, how the xml should look like to handle<br/>\n&gt; that feature. This can happen while you are creating the reference<br/>\n&gt; implementation.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; When a feature is finished we should loop with the next &#39;most voted&#39;<br/>\n&gt; feature.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Are you agree?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Best regards<br/>\n&gt; Daniela Waranie<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
