Thx!\n(I asked on softwaretestingexperts@yahoogroups, but this is more sort of a\njob listing group).\n\n---------\n\nI am in an company with about 50 developers (+ management) which now\nwants/has to set up a system test group = probably 10..15 people who do\nsystem testing (we have 10 &quot;country versions&quot; of our software and up to 3\nversions per country in the field, up to 3 versions &quot;in the making&quot;).\nI do know about \n\n* testing from a testers perspective (my favorite book: B.Beizer&#39;s &quot;Black\nBox Testing&quot;)\n\n* testing in the developer community (JUnit testing is done, although\nhaphazardly, by about 50% of the developers; direct application tests are\ndone by many developers)\n\nbut I do NOT know much about &quot;higher level issues&quot; like\n\n* input quality level for system tests done by the system test group (how to\ndefine and ascertain it?)\n* management of the system test group\n* conflict resolution between development and system test group\n* and what else?\n\nIs there any literature out there (books, on the net, ...) that could be\nhelpful? (yes, I did a google, but up to now the results are &quot;quite mixed&quot;).\n\nAlso, anyone who has experience to share is very welcome!\n\nThank you!\nHarald M.
