I&#39;m really impressed with seriousness you approached to<br/>\nacceptance testing.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand it seems that much work was involved to make this<br/>\nacceptance framework work fine.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would like to make our Selenium tests work automatically from CI<br/>\nserver (linux server without X), as any JUnit test would work. This<br/>\nway our Product Owner (yes, we&#39;re Scrumming) could write all necessary<br/>\nacceptance tests instead of descriptive acceptance criteria.<br/>\n<br/>\nCI is executing &quot;mvn clean install&quot; periodically and it would be great<br/>\nif we could automate this process.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny ideas?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nMarko<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, Fredrik Wendt &lt;fredrik@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On fre, 2009-02-20 at 13:25 +0000, majkic@... wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hi guys,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I need to create automated acceptance tests. Selenium seems to be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; nice, since it allows someone without much (or none at all)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; programming experience, as our Product Owner to create those tests<br/>\n&gt; &gt; with Firefox Selenium IDE plug-in.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; But time has come to integrate those tests to other JUnit tests, so<br/>\n&gt; &gt; these can be run on CI server.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Disclaimer: No JUnit, no Selenium-RC used in the solution below.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What we did is to put all Selenium tests (HTML source) in a separate<br/>\n&gt; web-app, bundled with Selenium Core and an index.jsp that starts the<br/>\n&gt; test automatically when called by a browser. (We also mangled Selenium<br/>\n&gt; Core to let a USERNAME and PASSWORD Selenium variables be set and<br/>\n&gt; present in all tests - mangled means five lines of javascript code.)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; To have it run in a CI environment ... I wrote two applications:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; a) a simple app called &quot;test agent&quot; that can take two commands over<br/>\n&gt; XML-RPC:<br/>\n&gt; a1) start a browser pointing it at a certain URL (pointing to the<br/>\n&gt; index.jsp file mentioned above, also telling the browser where the<br/>\n&gt; selenium result should be posted)<br/>\n&gt; a2) stop a browser<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; b) A web-app called &quot;test conductor&quot; that <br/>\n&gt; b1) keeps track of test agents<br/>\n&gt; b2) aggregate results returned from browsers<br/>\n&gt; b3) register test new test runs and launch them when test agents become<br/>\n&gt; idle<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This works well and having the test files in HTML (with human readable<br/>\n&gt; ID values on all elements the test interacts with) makes it useful for<br/>\n&gt; manual testing as well. Since the web-app with test can be deployed on a<br/>\n&gt; developers machine, a developer can also ask the test conductor to run a<br/>\n&gt; test off the developer&#39;s machine (and start debugging server side).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; There&#39;s no JUnit integration. We just added a simple script on our CI<br/>\n&gt; environment (Hudson) that after each successful build of the full<br/>\n&gt; software stack does:<br/>\n&gt; i) download the build artifacts, deploy them to a test server<br/>\n&gt; ii) register a new test run with web-app b mentioned above<br/>\n&gt; iii) waits for b to return a fail/success<br/>\n&gt; iv) undeploys the artifacts from step i<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This was all setup one year ago - the client I worked for wasn&#39;t sure<br/>\n&gt; what Selenium could do or if they wanted to invest time using it. Having<br/>\n&gt; the test written/saved in human readable HTML was a good selling point -<br/>\n&gt; if they decided to not go with Selenium then the tests could still be<br/>\n&gt; used &quot;as is&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Since then:<br/>\n&gt; Selenium 1.0 still hasn&#39;t been released.<br/>\n&gt; There&#39;s still no Selenium Driver that can use HTML files as source.<br/>\n&gt; 3000+ runs completed.<br/>\n&gt; We run test agents for FF2, FF3, IE7, Safari on Mac.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Parts of the test agent and test conductor is BSD-licensed, some parts<br/>\n&gt; where developed for the client (and I think they&#39;ll be happy to share<br/>\n&gt; under BSD-ish license).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; / Fredrik<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
