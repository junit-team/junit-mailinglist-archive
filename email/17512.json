That&#39;s like making your tech support user friendly by outsourcing <br/>\n&gt;it to trained professionasl in India rather than letting your clients <br/>\n&gt;talk directly to the developers. There&#39;s a ton of theory (i.e. <br/>\n&gt;rationalizations) to support doing that, and it&#39;s completely <br/>\n&gt;counterproductive in practice.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Interfaces are very popular among the most theoretical programmers: i.e. <br/>\n&gt;exactly the sort of programmers who are likely to write books, read <br/>\n&gt;books about OO theory, and hang out on lists like this one. However in <br/>\n&gt;my experience concrete classes are much simpler and much preferred by <br/>\n&gt;the vast majority of pragmatic programmers just getting their jobs done.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Unfortunately, programmers who want to unit test their code suffer.
