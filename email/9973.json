Rather, I noted that <br/>\nnot using those constructs yielded a more explicit set of tests, to me. <br/>\n  And I was curious why you chose those constructs over individual test <br/>\ncase methods, which I think is the obvious solution.  Thanks for <br/>\nexpounding on that.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike</div>",
