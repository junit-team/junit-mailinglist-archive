I see this to be very critical for \nmethods =\r\nfailing and resulting in exceptions. this way user could \nsimultaniously sa=\r\ny what is related message resulting failure along \nwith the exact stack tra=\r\nce.\n\nAlso, junit does not give the cound of no of test cases passed.. it \ns=\r\nays total, failed and errors only.. would be happy to see total \npassed and=\r\n its % to encourage people to work on fixing others.\n\nAnother need, which I=\r\n had been badly looking for was no of asserts \nwhich have been executed.. t=\r\nhis tells me how much of auto testing \nhas been done.\n\ni.e assertEquals() a=\r\nssertNotNull all these calls should have a way \nreport to total assertcount=\r\ner.\n\nRegards,\nRaja Nagendra Kumar,\nC.T.O\nwww.tejasoft.com\n-Competant and Re=\r\nliable Offshore Java Code Audit, Refactoring and \nTest Automation Prodcut d=\r\nevelopment Partners.\n\n\n",
