Let me state it better: I dislike it when <br/>\nyou bring dogma into the discussion, as it weakens--for me--the power <br/>\nand credibility of the underlying ideas. It&#39;s as though they aren&#39;t <br/>\nstrong enough to merit consideration without assuming the intent of the <br/>\n&quot;other side&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; As a matter of fact, thank you for taking the time to comment on it.<br/>\n&gt; Testivus is meant to start discussions, not to end them :-).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Absolutely. Still, I think I would prefer the Testivus message if it <br/>\nwere, rather than apposite to dogma, more a message of &quot;not everyone has <br/>\na clear mental model of how this works; many of us struggle with it; <br/>\nhere are some talking points or pointers that will help those in that <br/>\nposition.&quot; Of course, you&#39;d need to make it far less condescending than <br/>\nI just did. Call it a draft. :)<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
