Minimally, the app must have requirements \ndoc signed by=\r\n user&#39;s/vendor, traceability to design documents from \nrequirements, tracea=\r\nbility from requirements to unit, system and \nuser acceptance tests, plus a=\r\n varitey of additional higher level \nvalidation strategy and test plan docu=\r\nments.  Usually the \ntraceability is shown as a traceability matrix. The ev=\r\nidence of all \nthe tests and dev processes must be archived, signed, etc. T=\r\nhis is \nmostly just standard good software development practice but ideally=\r\n \nI need all these elements for junit to make the QA police \ncomfortable.  =\r\nTheir great fear is an FDA auditor shows up and asks \nfor these artifacts f=\r\nor every system used by whatever they are \nauditing (such audits are semi-r=\r\negular events).  Vendor products, \ne.g., commercial test tools, have their =\r\nsoftware process and \nartifacts audited by the company QA department.\n \nNo =\r\nauditor could follow the CVS commits as a traceability matrix.  \nWhat doc d=\r\no you consider the standard users manual?  The articles \nlike the Cookbook =\r\ndon&#39;t cover all the features so they aren&#39;t easy \nto use as the basis of tr=\r\naceability.  I&#39;d probably need to use the \nCooks Tour as the design documen=\r\nt but I don&#39;t think it covers \neverything.\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, R=\r\nobert Wenner &lt;robert.wenner@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; &gt; So our \n&gt; &gt; customers sometime=\r\ns don&#39;t want us to use an open source tool like\n&gt; &gt; junit because it isn&#39;t =\r\nformally validated, \n&gt; \n&gt; Makes me curious: what tool is formally validated=\r\n?\n&gt; Can it even be formally validated without the underlying OS being \nform=\r\nally \n&gt; validated?\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; e.g., doesn&#39;t have written requirements, \n&gt;\n&gt; Giv=\r\ne them the user&#39;s manual as requirements design document?\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; traceable =\r\nto design, traceable to unit and system tests,  \n&gt; \n&gt; Requirements to desig=\r\nn tracing: You may be able to pull that from \nthe CVS \n&gt; or Subverson histo=\r\nry, if the commits happened in small step.\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; with the output of the t=\r\nests captured.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Run the test with ant and the testreport task. \n&gt; Com=\r\nmit the output to the repository to show them the history of \nsucceeding \n&gt;=\r\n tests.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Any suggestions for how to \n&gt; &gt; address this other than tell=\r\ning them that junit is so \nextensively used\n&gt; &gt; it must work, e.g., is ther=\r\ne a suite of junit acceptance tests \nor even\n&gt; &gt; unit tests that we can run=\r\n to prove that it works according to \nits\n&gt; &gt; specs?\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;d ask for the t=\r\nest documentation for one of the formally \nvalidated \n&gt; tools. If they can =\r\nactually provide such a thing, you may get a \nbetter \n&gt; idea what they are =\r\nlooking for.\n&gt; \n&gt; Good luck, and please let us know what happened.\n&gt; \n&gt; Rob=\r\nert\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
