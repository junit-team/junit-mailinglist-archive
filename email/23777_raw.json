It lets you create tests like this:\n&gt; \n&gt; @RunWith(PerfRunner.cla=\r\nss)\n&gt; public class MultiThreadUsageExampleTest {\n&gt; \n&gt;   @Test\n&gt;   public vo=\r\nid demonstrationTest(\n&gt;       @Varying(from=3D1, to=3D10) int threadCount,\n=\r\n&gt;       @Varying(from=3D100000, to=3D1000000, step=3D100000) int entryCount=\r\n) {\n&gt; \n&gt;       // code here that relies on threadCount and entryCount\n&gt;   }=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; }\n&gt; \n&gt; In the above example, my runner calls demonstrationTest() 100 =\r\ntimes, with parameter values (1, 100000), (2, 100000), ... (1, 200000), ...=\r\n (10, 1000000).\n&gt; \n&gt; What I want to do now is produce charts of how long ea=\r\nch call took. There are a lot of approaches, but I don&#39;t know which is &quot;rig=\r\nht.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. Register a TestListener and write my own reports to disk from =\r\nit (but is there a generic way to register listeners?)\n&gt; 2. Create my own m=\r\nain program that runs the test suite, and have it create the report when th=\r\ne suite is done (maybe this is the only way to register a TestListener anyh=\r\now?)\n&gt; 3. Transform the XML output of the ant junit task (but then it&#39;s bou=\r\nnd to Ant)\n&gt; 4. Transform the XML output of the maven-surefure-plugin (but =\r\nthen it&#39;s bound to Maven)\n&gt; 5. Write performance results to disk directly f=\r\nrom my TestRunner (should work in any environment, but feels like a dirty a=\r\npproach)\n&gt; \n&gt; Other ideas are welcome too, of course. My test runner is ope=\r\nn source and published on GitHub; I want a solution that can work for every=\r\none. So I think ideas 3 and 4 are out.\n&gt; \n&gt; Has anyone else thought about g=\r\netting data from custom test runners into human-readable reports?\n&gt; \n&gt; -Jon=\r\nathan\n&gt;\n\n\n\n",
