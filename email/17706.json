When you&#39;re an API writer, it behooves you to make your library<br/>\n&gt;&gt;general enough that it can be used for cases you didn&#39;t envision, or you&#39;ll<br/>\n&gt;&gt;make the life of your users harder <br/>\n&gt;&gt;    <br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;m sorry, but I flat out disagree. You should put in what is currently <br/>\n&gt;needed, no more. Do not try to support use cases you do not envision and <br/>\n&gt;do not understand. The bottom line is that if you leave something out, <br/>\n&gt;you can always add it later. However, once you&#39;ve shipped API it becomes <br/>\n&gt;impossible to take it away, even if you later realize you were mistaken <br/>\n&gt;or your design is poor. (Just look at the Java class libraries.)<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Personally, I think that API designers should anticipate that people <br/>\nwould want to test their code.  In general, the things that you have to <br/>\ndo to support that aren&#39;t too severe.  Your provide facilities for <br/>\nmocking, etc.  Most of those things can be discovered by attempting to <br/>\nwrite unit tests for code that uses your API.<br/>\n<br/>\nRe changing things in published APIs.  Yes, it can be hard but it is <br/>\ndoable.  It&#39;s really a social issue rather than a technical issue.<br/>\n<br/>\nMichael Feathers<br/>\nwww.objectmentor.com</div>",
