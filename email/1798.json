Examples <br/>\n&gt;     &gt; include open <br/>\n&gt;     &gt; source applications or products where the source code is <br/>\n&gt;     &gt; the primary <br/>\n&gt;     &gt; deliverable (e.g. frameworks).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; But Mike, don&#39;t you think this is a different beast altogether?  OpenSource<br/>\n&gt; should have the tests included because it fully expects the user to change<br/>\n&gt; the code.  If the user is responsible about maintaining the tests then it<br/>\n&gt; makes it easier for the progenitor(s) of the project accept changes to the<br/>\n&gt; base code.  At least in a somewhat perfect world... :D<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -Jason<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No doubt, maintaining test cases is an excellent way to convince open <br/>\nsource project curators that the changes work and don&#39;t break anything. <br/>\n  Moreover, the test cases are valuable stepping stones for users who <br/>\ndon&#39;t plan to contribute their changes back to the user community.  In <br/>\nany event, the intent of shipping the test cases in these situations is <br/>\nto give users of source code confidence that the software works, <br/>\ndocument it&#39;s capabilities, and provide a testable foundation for <br/>\nmodification.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll up the ante a bit and propose that products that provide a Java API <br/>\nship selected JUnit test cases to demonstrate example uses of the API. <br/>\nIt&#39;s common for such products to include example programs in various and <br/>\nsundry formats, and sometimes they even work!  I&#39;ve often thought it <br/>\nwould be handy if these examples followed a well known structure and <br/>\nautomatically validated the results.  This of course requires that <br/>\ncustomers are willing to install JUnit if it&#39;s not distributed with the <br/>\nproduct.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nMike Clark<br/>\nClarkware Consulting, Inc.<br/>\nCustom Software Architecture, Design,<br/>\nDevelopment, and Performance Consulting<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.clarkware.com\">http://www.clarkware.com</a></div>",
