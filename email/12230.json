However it looks like that I<br/>\n&gt; will have to run my tests in a container, meaning I have to use<br/>\n&gt; Cactus. I don&#39;t think I can do this with Cactus because they<br/>\n&gt; instantiate TestCase. If there is a way I would love to know.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You can&#39;t, as the book says. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nCheck back with Cactus, though: I told Vince about this and he said he <br/>\nmight try to fix the problem. The question is whether it was high enough <br/>\npriority to be done.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou have a few choices:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Use Cactus, but be forced to use the &quot;check()&quot; pattern that someone <br/>\non this list mentioned. (Kevin? Chris?)<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Change the test so that it doesn&#39;t need to run in a container, then <br/>\napply the Parameterized Test Case pattern. The book is full of <br/>\nsuggestions for moving tests outside of the container.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat&#39;s the reason for the container in the first place?<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ.
