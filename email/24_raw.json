I\n&gt; haven&#39;t had a chance to really play with it, but might -- it looks like it\n&gt; could have some nice stuff.  (I&#39;m not sure whether I&#39;d use the major\n&gt; functionality of access to restricted classes and members or not, though.)\n&gt; Does it work with JDK 1.1?\n\nI started JUnitX after reading the Refactoring-book of Martin Fowler.\nDuring my vacation I had real fun refactoring JUnit and afterwards I\nhave been curious how it would be possible to access private methods,\nclasses and attributes across packages. So I had to extend JUnit in\nmany aspects. Also the Swing GUI required more clicks than I liked to\naccess the tree of tests. So I reworked the Swing and Text UIs.\n\nNow it is a challenge to submit the changes to JUnit. I hope that JUnit\nsoon gives me the opportunity to give my best changes to it after\nhaving somebody reviewing them. So I am sad that it is a branch\ndevelopment. But I will definitely support _all_ JUnit features in\nthe JUnitX versions until everything has been merged sufficiently.\n\nI never tested the stuff with JDK 1.1. But it should be possible to\nbackport the stuff. Are you interested in doing that? Than you might\nwant to join extreme-java@egroups.com, the JUnitX and XPTest mailinglist\nI set up for developers.\n\nConcerning testing private code, it depends on your preferences.\nGenerally\nit would be better not to access private code since there is a reason\nfor beeing private. But sometimes you might want to ensure that\ncomplex algorithms work corrently and there it could be helpful to\naccess the inner state of a class. See it as a kind of last resort to\nbe sure that a test case tests the right stuff completely. It should\nnot become the general way of testing your production classes.\n\nRegards,\n\nAndreas.\n\n",
