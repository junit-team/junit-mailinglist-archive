I feel that (the need) for such an annotation implies a risk that =\r\ntest go easily lost (this is implemented on class-level in the RegexpSuite =\r\nin the project unofficialjunit on SF). \n&gt; An inconvenience of this approach=\r\n is the need for some rigour when naming classes and packages. On the other=\r\n hand, this rigour may anyhow be needed to separate &quot;true&quot; unit tests from =\r\nintegration tests, etc.\n&gt; \n&gt; And yes, I would chip in to reimplemente categ=\r\nories in one way or another.\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; Georg\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In junit@yahoogr=\r\noups.com, David Saff &lt;saff@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Classes as categories was my=\r\n idea.

Our requirement is to run unit tests from wit=\r\nhin\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Eclipse and using Maven.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The experience was rather di=\r\nsappointing.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The support for categories in Eclipse is completel=\r\ny missing. Maven plugin\n&gt; &gt; &gt; did not work out of the box as the wrong test=\r\n executor was instantiated.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Once this was fixed, we found that the ca=\r\ntegory class must be available in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the class path of all projects, els=\r\ne the plugin fails with a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ClassNotFoundException.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Why are=\r\n categories not plain strings as in TestNG? This would prevent\n&gt; &gt; &gt; class =\r\nnot found exceptions and in addition removes the requirement to have\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\na dependency on the single module containing the categories. If you like\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; you can still use String constants to be &quot;name safe&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Evalu=\r\nating TestNG as an alternative lead to the following results:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; - Good =\r\nsupport in the Eclipse Plugin and Maven\n&gt; &gt; &gt; -- Groups (=3D categories) ar=\r\ne found by the Eclipse plugin\n&gt; &gt; &gt; - TestNG does not create a new instance=\r\n per test. As a consequence all\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fields must be set in @BeforeMethod. =\r\nUsing a normal constructor causes\n&gt; &gt; &gt; unexpected results.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; - @Before=\r\nMethod is not executed, if a group is specified. There is a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; @BeforeGr=\r\noup annotation which makes the whole thing much more complex.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; B=\r\nest Regards\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sebastian\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; [Non-tex=\r\nt portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n[Non-text portio=\r\nns of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
