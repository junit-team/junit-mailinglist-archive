[...]\n  [...]\n\nI was thinking much the same thing, but unless there&#39;s something\nI&#39;m missing in Ant (certainly possible), this technique is too\ncumbersome for fine-grained incremental testing.\n\nSuppose, for concreteness, that I have a test class FooTests,\nwhich tests a class Foo.  I want FooTests to run only if either\nFooTests.java or Foo.java has changed since the last time it was\nrun, so I write (1) a target which uses &lt;junit&gt; to run FooTests\nand touches a timestamp file to record when the test was run, and\n(2) a target which uses &lt;uptodate&gt; to compare the timestamps of\nthe timestamp file and the sources, setting a property\nFooTest.do-run-run if the sources have changed.  Target 1 depends\non target 2 and has attribute if=&#39;FooTest.do-run-run&#39;.\n\nAll good so far.\n\nThe next day, I write some more classes Foo1, Foo2, ..., Foo46,\nand their tests Foo1Test, Foo2Test, ..., Foo46Test.  (I was on\nvacation in Minsk the day of that seminar on naming classes\nmeaningfully.)\n\nI want each test to run only if it or its corresponding source\nfile has changed, so... I add &lt;uptodate&gt; and &lt;junit&gt; targets for\neach of the forty-six new classes, each pair controlling its\nbehaviour with a FooNTest.do-run-run property.  That&#39;s ninety-four\ntargets altogether.\n\nEither of the following additions to Ant would make it possible to\nstate the desired behaviour tersely:\n\n1. A version of &lt;fileset&gt; which lets us say &quot;omit from the set\nthose files which are newer than their corresponding file under\nthis &lt;mapper&gt;&quot;.  (Properly done, this involves implementing a\nfairly general algebra on sets of file names.)\n\n2. A looping construction, that is, a way to say &quot;for every file x\nin this &lt;fileset&gt;, execute task y with property z set to &#39;x&#39;&quot;. \n(In the case at hand, the task would be an &lt;antcall&gt; to the\n&lt;junit&gt; task.)\n\nOn reflection, it seems a bit odd that these kinds of facilities\naren&#39;t already in Ant.  Am I missing something?\n\n-- \nSteven Taschuk           |   7&#92; 7&#39;Z {&~         .
