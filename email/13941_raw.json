I&#39;m wondering what is the right way to set up \nsome =\r\nrandom tests?  \n\nShould I just put into my tests a loop runs the test multi=\r\nple times?  \nThis seems to imply that the test needs to call setUp() to get=\r\n some \nfresh objects (&quot;test fixture&quot;) each time through the loop, which see=\r\nms \nsomehow wrong (at least I&#39;ve seen no examples like this).  Is there \nso=\r\nme better way to ask for a test to be run N times?\n\nI got turned on to JUni=\r\nt from the book\n   Building Parsers with Java=99 by Steven John Metsker\nhow=\r\never it seems that he does not use JUnit for random tests.  He has \na secti=\r\non extolling JUnit, but then a section immediately after about \nrandom test=\r\ning that doesn&#39;t use JUnit at all.\n\nPerhaps random testing is not considere=\r\nd part of unit testing?  If so, \nwhy?\n\nThanks for the help.\n--Erik N\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
