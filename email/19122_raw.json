This release will\nlikely contain several new features that we believe are ideal for all\ntesters.  The first changes, however, are in our support for custom\nrunners.  If you have ever written, or been tempted to write, a custom\nrunner, read on.  Otherwise, feel free to archive this mail away, wait here\nfor further updates.  :-)\n\n...\n\n...\n\nAre they gone?  Good.\n\nBy annotating a test class with @RunWith, a tester can declare to JUnit that\na class should be interpreted in a vastly different way than usual.  A great\nexample is Johannes Link&#39;s ClasspathSuite runner (\nhttp://johanneslink.net/cpsuite.html).  However, if an extender of JUnit\nwanted a class to be interpreted in mostly the same way, but with a slight\nchange (for example, the custom runner that ships with JMock 2), they are\nrequired to copy or inherit from internal classes like TestClassRunner.\n\nIn 4.4, we will add API classes that will make this process easier.  At the\nsame time, the internal package will undergo significant changes, almost\ncertainly breaking custom runners that have depended on these classes in the\npast.  In order to ease this transition, we would like to involve each of\nyou to get your feedback about what should change, and also to provide you\nwith frequent feedback about what is changing.  To that end, CVS HEAD has\nbeen updated with the latest work, and a 4.4-snapshots release category has\nbeen created on sourceforge for snapshot zips.  You&#39;ll notice, for example,\nthat TestClassRunner is already gone, replaced by JUnit4ClassRunner.  Other\nchanges are also afoot.\n\nFor further discussion on this topic, please join the junitcomplements\nmailing list at\n\nhttp://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/junitcomplements/\n\nI look forward to seeing you there!\n\n   David Saff\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
