I would think<br/>\nabout using composition in some of those places. (Or aren&#39;t you actually<br/>\ntalking about inheritance here?)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I would prefer to organize my tests with a similar hierarchy<br/>\n&gt; structure<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Why?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Also I would like to initialise the objects needed in the<br/>\n&gt; appropriate level for the childs to make use of them without doing<br/>\n&gt; them again. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not sure I understand this. Care to elaborate?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 1. Have a single parent without testXXX methods do the on<br/>\n&gt; demand initialisation at the top level and all Uts inherit<br/>\n&gt; from this single parent. And have Uts in a single level. In<br/>\n&gt; the above case BizDocUt & PurchaseRequestUt will be in the<br/>\n&gt; same level.  BizDocUt initialises some objects in the helpers<br/>\n&gt; and make available for all Uts.  Or if PurchaseRequestUt is<br/>\n&gt; run first it initialises first all Bizdoc objects so that<br/>\n&gt; BizdocUt can run w/o initializing them again.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>So are you saying the Bizdoc objects are global to the tests? What does it<br/>\nmean to &quot;initialize&quot; them? Where are the hold?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 2. Maintain the heirarchy of Ut and use the Test suite in all<br/>\n&gt; Ut classes to add the child tests only.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sounds like unecessary work to me.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Guys - don&#39;t you feel this is a very common need for any OO<br/>\n&gt; application.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Frankly, no, I don&#39;t feel it is. It rather looks to me as if your design is<br/>\nsuboptimal, and that your testing problems are just a symptom of that. I<br/>\ndon&#39;t know enough to be sure, though.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I am surprised JUnit doesn&#39;t provided this<br/>\n&gt; flexibility directly.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s because the inventors of Junit, and many of it users, don&#39;t just<br/>\nwrite unit tests to tests the system, but use writing tests as a *design*<br/>\ntechnique. If they encounter a problem when trying to write Junit tests for<br/>\ntheir system, they first think about what the system needed to look like to<br/>\nnot have those problems, and often find that refactoring it to that<br/>\ndirection improves the overall decoupling and flexibility.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I have posted my requirement for<br/>\n&gt; Logical flow of tests which is also good to have.  JUnit has these<br/>\n&gt; missing.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It can be added to Junit without a problem, it is flexible enough to allow<br/>\nthat. It&#39;s not at the core of Junit because many of its users actually think<br/>\nthat needing a &quot;Logical flow of tests&quot; is a thing that should be avoided.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I can hack(override) into jUnit to support these but I do<br/>\n&gt; not want to maintain this for every release.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If you want, you can write a TestSuite implementation that uses reflection<br/>\nto only call the test methods declared directly in a class (that is, not the<br/>\ninherited ones). I think it would take me less than an hour to do so. In<br/>\nyears of using Junit, I never felt the need to do that, though.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; JUnit folks..are you hearing...?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Certainly. Are you, too? ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care, Ilja</div>",
