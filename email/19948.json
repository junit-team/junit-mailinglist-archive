But has anyone<br/>\n&gt;  (like the Apache Jakarta projects, for instance) put out any tools to<br/>\n&gt;  make the shenanigans easier to cope with for a casual user?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  The only thing stopping me from fetching the JAR file from the ant<br/>\n&gt;  script that kicks the tests off is that all the logic for finding the<br/>\n&gt;  remote system and copying files from it already exists in Java code<br/>\n&gt;  that&#39;s part of my test framework.  So I&#39;d rather do all this from inside<br/>\n&gt;  my test case&#39;s superclass, if possible, so I don&#39;t have to duplicate<br/>\n&gt;  code.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>ANT tasks are very simple to write, and typically a lot simpler than<br/>\nclassloaders.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Also, Hai, your suggestion of using JUnit4&#39;s RunWith is an interesting<br/>\n&gt;  one.  I haven&#39;t use these capabilities, so I&#39;ll read up on it.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I was going to suggest that if you can&#39;t do it via ANT, since I think<br/>\nwhether you use a custom Runner or use JUnit 3.8, you will be doing<br/>\nclassloader work.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not aware of any existing Runner that will introduce a new<br/>\nclassloader, but Google might know.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\n<br/>\nJames</div>",
