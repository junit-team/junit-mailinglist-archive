The &quot;if it works, don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; touch it&quot; maxim leads ultimately to code rot, in my experience.  If I let it fester<br/>\n&gt; too long, it will become increasing difficult to make new things work.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You&#39;re absolutely right.  But everyone on the team must share the same <br/>\nvision.<br/>\n<br/>\nI personally think that the term &quot;simplest thing that can work&quot; is too <br/>\nscary.  Because everyone knows that the &quot;simplest thing that can work&quot; <br/>\nleads to spaghetti code _if_ no other measure it taken.<br/>\n<br/>\nRefactoring is a solution, but at the end of a large project, it can be <br/>\nquite hasardous (at least I can easily imagine that).<br/>\n<br/>\nQuestion maybe OT for this list, but if someone has experiences, I would <br/>\nbe glad to hear from them in private.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Vladimir<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nVladimir Bossicard<br/>\nwww.bossicard.com</div>",
