Complete \nimplementation of it will be provided by the non-abstract child \nclasses.\n\n  Also complete implementation of an interface will be provided by a \nclass implementing the interface.  \n\n  Implementation can be treated as contract which needs to be \nfulfilled by the classes.\n\n  When we test a non-abstract class, we actually test all its public \nmethods, which in a sense is its contract about its behavior with \nother classes.\n\n  In case of non-abstract class, complete contract can be tested.\n\n  How to decide contracts of an abstract class & of an interface ?\n\n  After reframing my earlier questions, I want to know :\n\n 1. How to verify complete contract which is based on partial \ncontract provided by an Abstract class, using JUnit ?\n\n 2. How to verify complete contract which is based on partial \ncontract provided by an Interface, using JUnit ?\n\n This is having other facet as follows : \n\n I&#39;ll be able to test all the non-abstract classes extending an \nabstract class & all classes implementing an interface.\n\n But many non-abstract classes will be written based on an abstract \nclass, later on. Also many new classes may provide implementation of \nan interface.\n\n So how to take into account this future development while testing \nusing JUnit ?\n\nRegards,\n--- Shivprasad M.

How do I test an Abstract class using JUnit ?\n&gt; \n&gt; Extend the class and implement all its methods.  Then test the \nsubclass.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;  2. How do I test an Interface using JUnit ?\n&gt; \n&gt; You don&#39;t.  There&#39;s nothing to test in an interface.  Is this a \nhomework\n&gt; assignment?\n&gt; \n&gt; Scott Stirling\n\n\n",
