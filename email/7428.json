    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-669211848\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt; &gt; Violating pre- and postconditions is just a small subset of what<br/>\n&gt; can go<br/>\n&gt; &gt; wrong in your code. Unit tests often test the interplay of two or<br/>\n&gt; three<br/>\n&gt; &gt; methods, or even of several objects. You can&#39;t do this <br/>\n&gt; (effectively) <br/>\n&gt; &gt; with embedded assertions.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If you use Design by Contract then the implementation can be checked <br/>\n&gt; by the compiler to be valid or not.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Are you sure? Can you show me an example of such a compiler message,<br/>\nplease?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; Do you have a pointer?<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t know what you mean.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I meant something like a web-link. In the meantime I found the<br/>\nJML-homepage, but the documentation is rather unorganized. Where does it<br/>\nstate that the checks are done at compile time?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; That&#39;s wrong, as others already stated.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; But how will you test a method which returns nothing?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>By testing for the side effect.<br/>\n<br/>\nCan you give an example of a method you think of as untestable by Junit?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; Asserts are even less a guarantee. Asserts need to be <br/>\n&gt; executed to be <br/>\n&gt; &gt; effective - if you don&#39;t have external code invoking them in a well <br/>\n&gt; &gt; directed manner, they will not be of any use until in the <br/>\n&gt; production <br/>\n&gt; &gt; environment.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In my following posting I favor Design by Contract instead of just <br/>\n&gt; using<br/>\n&gt; assert statements. I replied to myself. Read the thread when it <br/>\n&gt; appears.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The same argument applies to DBC.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; If you really prefer this way, it wouldn&#39;t be too hard to include<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; unit tests into your production code. Most people seem to prefer to <br/>\n&gt; &gt; seperate the two.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I prefer Design by Contract. Most people don&#39;t know that paradigma.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Many TDDers do know.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; Junit doesn&#39;t force you to develop test-driven at all.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It suggests it strongy I think. Otherwise the synchronisation of code <br/>\n&gt; and test is endangered.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t follow you. All you need to do is run the tests regularly, so it<br/>\nseems to me.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; You might fear that it is. In practice, it doesn&#39;t seem to be that<br/>\n&gt; way.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If you use TDD in its intended form than you lose time. Thats my <br/>\n&gt; opinion.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>OK.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; minutes. There are even tools to automate this. My IDE shows me <br/>\n&gt; wether I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; run the tests since the last code change, and an integration server<br/>\n&gt; &gt; emails me if I broke a test nevertheless.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Still much work. I prefer to concentrate on code and not on test <br/>\n&gt; quality.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>For me, test quality has a huge impact on code quality. YMMV.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also wonder what the big difference is between maintaining tests and<br/>\nmaintaining DBC-like contracts.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards, Ilja</div>",
