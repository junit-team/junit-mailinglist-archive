Even without the arbitrary speed goal, there is a<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; good reason to avoid testing against the database.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t think the rate matters so much as the absolute time. In<br/>\n&gt; particular, I&#39;m writing an article right now which hypothesizes that the<br/>\n&gt; magic number is 90 seconds. Any test suite that runs in 90 seconds or<br/>\n&gt; less is fast enough, whether that&#39;s 9000 tests or 90. Look for details<br/>\n&gt; on The Cafes in a week or two. I will be curious to see if that 90<br/>\n&gt; second figure matches other people&#39;s experiences or not.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>For a group of tests that I want to run on every change, 90 seconds is <br/>\nout of the question. Anything more than 10 seconds is too much.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor a group of tests that I want to run at least before I commit <br/>\nchanges, I can go as much as 5 minutes. It&#39;s likely that a 5-minute <br/>\nsuite fits comfortably in a 10-minute build (including check out, <br/>\ncompile, all that).<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the rate, it does matter: if 20% of my tests take 45 seconds and <br/>\nthe rest (all in memory) take 5 seconds, then I will defer improving the <br/>\nslow tests, even though there&#39;s already a fair amount of design inertia <br/>\nthere. In general, if my tests run at slower than 10 tests/second, I <br/>\nwill ask &quot;Why&quot; and consider doing something about it. To me, it&#39;s no <br/>\ndifferent than catching a production execution speed problem early.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
