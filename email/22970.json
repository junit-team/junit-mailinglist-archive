That the Course object is constructed correctly, that a Course object is sent to the right place depending on one of its fields, that values from a Course are used to set up something else? Focussing on that question usually helps to bring out the right answer.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t usually mock out data objects, since the technique is more concerned with understanding behaviour than state. <br/>\n<br/>\nS.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 27 Sep 2010, at 13:13, Konrad Reiche wrote:<br/>\n&gt; I have sent some questions regarding how to test methods using whole <br/>\n&gt; OR-mapped classes in a bundle.
