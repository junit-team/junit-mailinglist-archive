I have a program <br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;with large number of console output from different source. Basically, <br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;I am using System.out.println(...). How could I verify those outputs <br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;are correct? Thanks!<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; 1. Don&#39;t use System.out in your application directly. Your application<br/>\n&gt;&gt; components should accept a PrintWriter as a parameter somewhere.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; 2. In your tests, substitute a PrintWriter wrapping a StringWriter in<br/>\n&gt;&gt; place of System.out. This is easy to verify.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I agree with both of J. B.&#39;s points above.  However, at some points in<br/>\n&gt;the past I have been obligated to use class libraries that write to<br/>\n&gt;System.out, and which I cannot change.  So, to test code that uses these<br/>\n&gt;libraries, I&#39;ve found that I get a lot of mileage out of creating a<br/>\n&gt;little &quot;ConsoleTester&quot; helper class, which appears below.  The basic<br/>\n&gt;idea is, in my unit test I create a ConsoleTester, then exercise the<br/>\n&gt;code I want to test, then get the output that was written to System.out<br/>\n&gt;from the ConsoleTester and make assertions about it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Again, please do not misunderstand:  I don&#39;t like this approach.  In my<br/>\n&gt;own code, I do not write to System.out, and I recommend that others<br/>\n&gt;avoid doing so as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>&lt;snip-code /&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis looks good, although I have to question the use of a finalizer. Does that really work? I would think that your test has to call an explicit &quot;put the streams back the way they were&quot; method. Relying on finalize() is generally not a good thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJ. B.
