But this could get into some tricky threading<br/>\n&gt; issues.  But again I am not sure how I would update the variable and run the<br/>\n&gt; tests, and get the TestResults to come out appropriately.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You&#39;re right; you don&#39;t want to do this.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Is it so wrong to want to instantiate a test with some parameters and<br/>\n&gt; automatically run the tests on it?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No, but JUnit was not designed that way.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt; Of course I am new to Unit Testing.  It was trivially easy<br/>\n&gt; until I came across this problem.  Now it feels like I am fighting with <br/>\n&gt; JUnit,<br/>\n &gt; Parameterized TestCase is close, but I<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t want to override runTest().  I want the reflective base <br/>\n&gt; functionality to<br/>\n&gt; run all methods named test* automatically, and for the results to show up<br/>\n&gt; appropriately.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is a different problem from the one you described before, so it&#39;s a <br/>\ndifferent one from what I tried to help you solve.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have implemented Parameterized Test Suite, which is a hybrid of <br/>\nParameterized Test Case and the automatic test*() method extractor. I <br/>\ndidn&#39;t like the solution. I would recommend using FitNesse for this kind <br/>\nof test, rather than JUnit. Don&#39;t be thrown off by the fact that <br/>\nFitNesse is an &quot;acceptance testing&quot; tool. It&#39;s great for data driven <br/>\ntests like the one you&#39;re trying to write.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
