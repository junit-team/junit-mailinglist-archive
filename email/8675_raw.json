He asked, &quot;Is there a better way?&quot; I offered one.\n\nNot all opinions nee=\r\nd to be so polarizing.\n\n&gt;I understand that the framework offers us \n&gt;a lot =\r\nof possibilities, and it&#39;s up to us to choose what&#39;s the best \n&gt;way to use =\r\nit, according to our needs and purposes. I think all \n&gt;approaches have its =\r\npros and cons; for example, the approach he&#39;s \n&gt;using, of running batch tes=\r\nts starting with &quot;Test&quot;, has the problem \n&gt;of not selecting a particular se=\r\nt of tests to run each time, but he \n&gt;has the benefit of not worrying about=\r\n anything except his unit tests. \n\nHe is changing the names of tests by han=\r\nd to group tests together. JUnit already has a natural way to group tests t=\r\nogether that does not require this manual intervention. I think we can all =\r\nagree that maintaining test suites in this way -- by hand -- is only a shor=\r\nt-term solution (on the order of minutes). If a test suite needs to survive=\r\n more than a few minutes, the most effective way to build the suite is by b=\r\nuilding a TestSuite object somehow.\n\n&gt;The suite approach, as you suggests, =\r\nhas a pro of grouping tests, but \n&gt;has also a con of hard-coding in a class=\r\n which tests should be run. \n&gt;This is related to the problem I have, of run=\r\nning a piece of code \n&gt;somewhere before all tests.\n\nYour problem is easy to=\r\n solve, too: TestSetup. Or GSBase&#39;s OrderedTestSuite. Or your own custom Te=\r\nstRunner (the best solution) which runs your piece of code first, then the =\r\ntest suite. Any of those would work.\n\n&gt;If I&#39;ve said something wrong, feel f=\r\nree to correct me, I&#39;m always \n&gt;ready to learn.\n\nAs am I.\n\n\nJ. B.
