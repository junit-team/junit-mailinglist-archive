However, I disagree with the statement - unless<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;you got something other than your own experience to back that statement<br/>\n&gt;up<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;with.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;You disagree with what part: that it&#39;s a time waster or that it&#39;s a &quot;top<br/>\n&gt;time waster&quot;?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I disagree that it is &quot;a top time waster&quot; as you stated.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I can sink my teeth into this. Are you willing to name, say, five bigger time wasters, according to your experience? I&#39;m not trying to grill you, but I am interested in your perspective. I can learn from it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;As for &quot;something other than your own experience to back that statement<br/>\n&gt;up with&quot;, what on<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Earth is more important than one&#39;s experience?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The experience of a collective is more important than the myopic<br/>\n&gt;experience of an individual.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No argument there. You can agree, though, that one&#39;s opinion is shaped most by one&#39;s direct experience, in spite of what one may have read or heard.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;One person can only experience so much, thus<br/>\n&gt;we produce studies and surveys and the like to draw upon the experience of<br/>\n&gt;many to understand things that might be anomalies. Do you have a survey,<br/>\n&gt;study, or anything else that I can take to my management so that we can<br/>\n&gt;improve our own process other than &quot;some guy on a list says that<br/>\n&gt;documentation is a top time waster&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No, I don&#39;t; but then, giving you ammunition to take to your management was not my objective in writing the foregoing, so it&#39;s reasonable that my response wouldn&#39;t factor that in, no?<br/>\n<br/>\nIncidentally, isn&#39;t a study simply what one guy did? My point is: when does it end? You can discredit or simply choose not to believe any study I might put before you. At some point, you choose either to believe or you don&#39;t. This is why I don&#39;t knock myself out looking for studies. I listen to stories (told campfire-style around the bar at conferences) and I observe what happens around me. I find it more authentic.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJ. B.
