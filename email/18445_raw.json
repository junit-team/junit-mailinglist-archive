The &quot;catch&quot; is that I have to\n&gt; contribute testing-related examples - in other words: beautiful test\n&gt; code.\n&gt; \n&gt; I already have some ideas of what to cover, but I thought some of the\n&gt; people in this group might have some examples of tests that they\n&gt; consider particularly &quot;beautiful&quot; or clever in their approach.\n\nI am proud of Contract Tests combined with Interaction Tests to test \nthings like controllers in a J2EE application (or whatever they&#39;re \ncalled these days). I think it&#39;s beautiful the way I can drive the \ndesign of both the View and Model by test-driving the Controllers. I \nthink the corresponding tests are very nice. If you&#39;d like specific \nexamples, I can try to cook a few up from a current project I use in \ntutorials. Contact me directly--me at jbrains dot ca--if you&#39;d like to \nsee more.\n\nTake care.\n-- \nJ. B.
