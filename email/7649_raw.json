I did take a look at the product but decided\nit wasn&#39;t very useful for what I needed to do, which is test to simulate a\nclient using a MIDP application (i.e. routine tests, such as verifying that\nwhen you launch the app. all the menu options are there).\n\nWe opted for a GUI testing tool for now until we find a better tool (or the\ntime to make one :-) ) to test something like this.\n\nJust out of curiosity what would you like to use it for?\n\n\n\n\n  -----Original Message-----\n  From: quikdraw@...\n[mailto:quikdraw@...]\n  Sent: Tuesday, April 01, 2003 08:19 PM\n  To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n  Subject: Re: [junit] MIDP Testing Tools\n\n\n  Katie Gerg wrote:\n\n  &gt; Does anyone know of any MIDP testing tools?\n\n  Katie,\n\n  The only one I am aware of is J2MEUnit, which is a port of\n  JUnit and is currently limited to MIDP 1.0. It is also pre-\n  JDK 1.4 which means Assert.assert() and the assert keyword\n  will collide. The good news is it is easy to change Assert.assert()\n  to Assert.assertTrue(). The bad news is I&#39;ve been fighting\n  with getting the preverifier to work for several days now\n  without success. Perhaps success is just around the corner...\n\n  Maybe you will have more luck. If you do, please let me know\n  what the trick is! &lt;G&gt;\n\n  http://www.xprogramming.com/ftp/TestingFramework/j2me/J2MEUnit1_0.zip\n  --\n  Thanks,\n  Derek Lane\n  =====================================\n  --- The Gunslinger\n  quikdraw@...\n\n\n\n        Yahoo!
