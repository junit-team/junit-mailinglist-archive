Now I need\n&gt; &gt; to modify some existing EJBs which have not yet been touched with the\n&gt; &gt; test infection. Where do I start? We are nearing our beta date and we\n&gt; &gt; cannot afford any major upsets in the existing code base. I feel like\n&gt; &gt; I cannot continue my current project until I write a test of some sort\n&gt; &gt; for this session bean. I don&#39;t want to have to write an integration\n&gt; &gt; test first. I&#39;ve been hearing that cactus is the thing for me but I\n&gt; &gt; cannot get a good mental picture of how to start with it or how it\n&gt; &gt; works. If I use Cactus does that mean that I have to deploy my entire\n&gt; &gt; app before testing the EJB? Please help.\n&gt; \n&gt; Short answers:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. You can test the EJB in Cactus by just deploying the EJB. Your\nCactus \n&gt; test simply uses the EJB. No need to deploy the entire application.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2. Session beans are easy to make testable, compared to entity beans. \n&gt; You can make some mechanical code changes and test 99% of the session \n&gt; bean&#39;s logic /without/ a container!\n&gt; \n&gt; 3. You can also try MockEJB (www.mockejb.org). In fact, if I were\nyou, I \n&gt; might start here.\n&gt; \n&gt; Finally--you guessed it--read chapter 11 of _JUnit Recipes_, which \n&gt; covers testing EJBs in about 75 pages.
