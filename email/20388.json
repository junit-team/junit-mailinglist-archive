I will explain the situation and was<br/>\n&gt; hoping that maybe someone could point me in the right direction.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have written a SQL parser which parses a SQL query and builds an<br/>\n&gt; object model representation of same which it returns as the result of<br/>\n&gt; a parse.  The object model has the ability to print itself and so long<br/>\n&gt; as the parser works correctly what it prints will be very close to the<br/>\n&gt; input query.  A single test case then consists of parsing a query,<br/>\n&gt; calling printMe( ) on the resultant tree and comparing it&#39;s output to<br/>\n&gt; what was expected, which again, is very similar to but not identical<br/>\n&gt; to the original query.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So, first a general question: I know that his is closer to end to end<br/>\n&gt; testing than it is to the sort of fine grained class level tests JUNIT<br/>\n&gt; is designed for.  Is JUNIT even appropriate?  Assuming the answer is<br/>\n&gt; yes, I&#39;ll continue.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The pseudo code for a single test case would look like this:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; String orgnlQry = &quot;Select * from MyTable.MyColumn&quot;;<br/>\n&gt; String expectedQry = &quot;Select * from MyColumn&quot;;<br/>\n&gt; Parser myParser = new Parser( );<br/>\n&gt; // A bunch of code to construct Parser and connect to data store<br/>\n&gt; myParser.parse(orgnlQry);<br/>\n&gt; SQLTree tree = myParser.getTree( );<br/>\n&gt; String outQry = tree.printMe( );<br/>\n&gt; assertEquals(outQry, expectedQry);<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;d like all of my test cases to use the same parser instance so that<br/>\n&gt; I only have to initialize it once.  The only variables for each test<br/>\n&gt; than are the orgnl/expectedQry pairs of which I&#39;ve got about 120.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m able to get a single test case running but I can&#39;t figure out how<br/>\n&gt; to eliminate duplicate code.  I&#39;m also no sure how to organize the<br/>\n&gt; tests.  Shold there really be 120 different test methods or is there<br/>\n&gt; some way to call the same test method 120 times with different input<br/>\n&gt; strings?  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks in advance for any suggestions anyone can provide.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -ts1971<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>- You can separate initializing code  to setup/teardown method, this<br/>\nwill eleminate some  duplication.<br/>\n(about setup and teardown method, look here<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://junit.sourceforge.net/doc/faq/faq.htm#organize_3)\">http://junit.sourceforge.net/doc/faq/faq.htm#organize_3)</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n- For 120 different test case, if it has same format and  is in text<br/>\nfile, I recommend writing another class to process reading it and<br/>\nreturn turn each pair. <br/>\n<br/>\nLet test case use this class to load those test cases, this will save<br/>\namount of time instead of doing them all by hand.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Another issue, I think  it&#39;s better to divide those 120  cases into<br/>\ndifferent catagories (ie. simple selection, selection with where<br/>\nclause etc...) . Write a test case for each catagory.  So that when<br/>\nyour code break you can analyse which kind of sql query is the reason.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m quite new to JUnit too, so if some expert see any mistakes or any<br/>\nrecommends.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHope it helps</div>",
