No, for reasons I am about to write.\n\nYour CLASSPATH had a glaring error. I&#39;m not sure Mike saw it. Correct me if \nyou did, Mike.\n\nYou were putting the properties file in the CLASSPATH, and not the folder at \nthe root of the properties file. To be precise, you were putting \n&quot;..../junit/runner/excluded.properties&quot; in your CLASSPATH instead of just \nthe folder containing &quot;junit/runner/...&quot;. I think Mike actually mentioned \nit, but I&#39;m not sure you did it.\n\nJUnit looks for a properties file at junit.runner.excluded.properties, \nmeaning that Java looks in your CLASSPATH and tries to match \nX/junit/runner/excluded.properties for each X in the CLASSPATH. If you have \nY/junit/runner/excluded.properties in the CLASSPATH, Java will try to load \nY/junit/runner/excluded/properties/junit/runner/excluded.properties, which \nit will surely not find.\n\nI hope this is clearer.\n\nJBR.\n\n==================\nThanks.\nThat explains.\n\n--- In junit@y..., Mike Clark &lt;mike@c...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;yours_jeeva wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Mike,\n&gt; &gt; It works now.
