One thing I didn&#39;t implement was a<br/>\nnotion of skipped tests, but I&#39;m considering adding that, because it means<br/>\nsomething different than ignored or pending tests. What these mean in<br/>\nScalaTest are:<br/>\n<br/>\nignored: test used to work, but I broke it and don&#39;t have time to fix it<br/>\nnow. Don&#39;t want to delete it, so marking it ignored and have a good<br/>\nintention of coming back and fixing it later<br/>\n<br/>\npending: fleshing out the &quot;specification&quot; of code I likely haven&#39;t written<br/>\nyet, but for sure the test I haven&#39;t written yet (pendingUntilFixed is a<br/>\nsubset of this, for a bug I haven&#39;t fixed yet.)<br/>\n<br/>\nskipped: test skipped due to some assumption needed by the test not being<br/>\nmet, such as a database being available on the network.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe skipped concept shows up in JUnit as assumptions, and in TestNG as<br/>\ndependent tests, I think.<br/>\n<br/>\nBill<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Thu, Jun 23, 2011 at 1:07 AM, Esko Luontola &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:esko.luontola@...\">esko.luontola@...</a>&gt;wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; **<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Joakim Ohlrogge wrote on 23.6.2011 0:20:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Jumi looks very interesting.

There are quite many different reasons for having a<br/>\n&gt; skipped/ignored/pending test, and also with some testing frameworks they<br/>\n&gt; are marked pending during the execution of the test (e.g. ScalaTest&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; pendingUntilFixed) whereas some mark them before executing any test code<br/>\n&gt; (e.g. JUnit&#39;s @Ignore).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; At first I&#39;ll create the simplest possible solution and have just one<br/>\n&gt; concept of skipped tests. Later, once I get some feedback from users and<br/>\n&gt; framework developers, I&#39;ll gather the different use cases for skipping<br/>\n&gt; tests and think about supporting them better.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; Esko Luontola<br/>\n&gt; www.orfjackal.net<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nBill Venners<br/>\nArtima, Inc.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.artima.com\">http://www.artima.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>",
