I would \nlike to test it using Junit. However, this requires me to write a \ntest case which is distributed among many processes which act as \nclient/servers.\n\nI&#39;ve looked into jakarta&#39;s cactus, and Junit EE but I understand they \nwould support only distributed applications based on standard \ncommunication protocols (namely HTTP and an EJB contained)\n\nIs there an extension to Junit that would support testing of non-\nstandard distributed applications?\n\nI&#39;ve started designing an RMI-based version of the junit interfaces \nwhere a testcase could spawn one or more &quot;distributed test cases&quot; \nrunning on remote hosts and that would report their status through \nthe originating test&#39;s TestListener. I&#39;m basically remotizing the \njunit interfaces.\n\nI wonder if such extension would already exist and if I could reuse \nit rather than redoing this from scratch. \n\nThanks for your help,\n\nGuillaume.\n\n\n",
