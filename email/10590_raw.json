The solution to that problem is to start ant\nitself with more java heap using the ANT_OPTS environment variable.\n\nThe important point here is that ANT_OPTS is an operating system\nenvironment variable, just like JAVA_HOME or ANT_HOME, not an ant\nproperty or a command line argument, which was how I was trying to use\nit at first. Don&#39;t make the same mistake I did!\n\nTry this where ever you define your JAVA_HOME and ANT_HOME, such as\n~/.bash_profile:\n\nANT_OPTS=-Xmx80M # do some tests to figure out the minimume size you\nneed...\nJAVA_HOME=/javahome # or where ever...\nANT_HOME=/anthome # or where ever...\nexport $ANT_OPTS $JAVA_HOME $ANT_HOME \n\n-- Joe\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Ray Tayek&quot; &lt;rtayek@f...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; &gt; From: J.

When I turn on\ndebug \n&gt; &gt; &gt; logging, I get an out of memory error.  ...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Does anyone know of a workaround.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; This happens when there is a lot of console output. One hack \n&gt; &gt; is to use \n&gt; &gt; the &quot;noframes&quot; stylesheet, ...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Another workaround would be to redirect debug logging away \n&gt; &gt; from stdout  ...\n&gt; &gt; This might also be a Xalan defect. ...\n&gt; \n&gt; Great ideas, I will try them\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks for your prompt assistance.\n\n\n\n",
