As Kent Beck says, if\n&gt;&gt; you follow TDD religiously, you should have 100% statement coverage\n&gt;&gt; for your code. Let me repeat that: 100%.\n&gt;\n&gt;Yes, Kent Beck indeed did say, &quot;TDD followed religiously should result\n&gt;in 100% statement coverage.&quot; But on the other hand, the sentence\n&gt;before that in his TDD book is &quot;Statement coverage is certainly not a\n&gt;sufficient measure of test quality, but it is a starting place.&quot; \n\nTo me, the bottom line with Test Coverage is that it is a &quot;negative\nmetric&quot;. Low test coverage is an indicator of failure; but high test\ncoverage is not an indicator of success. Your code could be\nhighly-covered by failing tests, after all. ;)\n\nThat&#39;s why we need skilled testers: to fill in the gaps between\nCustomer Tests (too high-level, often miss boundary conditions) and\nProgrammer Tests (very low-level, often miss integration problems).\n\n\nJ.
