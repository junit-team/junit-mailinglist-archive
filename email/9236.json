For a better defense of ET and discussion of the <br/>\n&gt; &gt; limitation of automation than I could ever provide, you should read <br/>\n&gt; &gt; some of Cem Kaner&#39;s articles on http://www.kaner.com/. Note that I <br/>\n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t agree with a lot of it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Can we see the list of things you don&#39;t like, too?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>To clarify my sentence above, the last word &quot;it&quot; equates to things<br/>\nwritten on the site about exploratory testing, as well as a lot of<br/>\nnegatives about test automation. I already mentioned what I don&#39;t like<br/>\nabout ET in my previous append and this group/XP/agile people can<br/>\narticulate the advantages of automation better than I. If you want to<br/>\ndig, Mr. Kaner and I went back and forth a bit in on this subject in<br/>\nJanuary of this year on the software-testing group. Of course there&#39;s<br/>\nalways more to be said but not enough time. Anyway, to reiterate a<br/>\ndifferent append of mine, if you want to have a good/fun/heated<br/>\nconversation on these subjects with peple who have very strong, well<br/>\nearned opinions you should take this subject to the sodtware-testing<br/>\ngroup.<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\nOutgoing mail is certified Virus Free.<br/>\nChecked by AVG anti-virus system (http://www.grisoft.com).<br/>\nVersion: 6.0.510 / Virus Database: 307 - Release Date: 8/14/2003</div>",
