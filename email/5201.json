If they don&#39;t,<br/>\nyou replace them.  Unfortunately, this isn&#39;t always<br/>\nthe case (at least where I&#39;ve been) so I&#39;ve had to<br/>\ndevelop some defensive coding technique.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, from your remark about having to change code<br/>\nbecause of the checked versus unchecked exceptions, it<br/>\nsounded like you were merely moaning about some part<br/>\nof your body hurting.  I, for one, don&#39;t mind having<br/>\nto go through and change a bunch of code because of<br/>\nsome refactoring I&#39;m doing.  I can, however, see how<br/>\nthat&#39;s a bit of a PITA, and so you can avoid that by<br/>\nusing the unchecked exceptions.<br/>\n<br/>\nReally, on the whole, I would tend to agree with you. <br/>\nI mainly wanted to get that viewpoint out there to get<br/>\nthe discussion a little broader, just in case anyone<br/>\nwas thinking that the unchecked exceptions were the<br/>\nend all, be all of coding (in Java anyway).<br/>\n<br/>\nFear (of my crappy code and/or design) makes me write<br/>\ntests.<br/>\n<br/>\nFear (of my coworkers or even sometimes of myself)<br/>\nmakes me tend to use checked versus unchecked<br/>\nexceptions.<br/>\n<br/>\nMindkiller?  Sure...but as long as the fear is<br/>\ncontrolled, and you use the response productively, it<br/>\ncan be a good thing. ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n-Eric<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S. Ah, something else I just thought of after<br/>\nre-reading.  We are also using exceptions for flow<br/>\ncontrol on occasion (for the web-based app we&#39;re<br/>\nconverting from VB).  In those instances, the<br/>\nexception is thrown and we absolutely must notify the<br/>\nuser and/or do something about it to recover.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- &quot;J. B. Rainsberger&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jbr@...\">jbr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; Hmmm...just to jump in the middle for a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; second...personally, I dislike unchecked<br/>\n&gt; exceptions. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I used to like them, because, similar to your<br/>\n&gt; &gt; experience, you could ignore them and not have the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ripple effect when refactoring.  However, I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; seen<br/>\n&gt; &gt; this as an excuse to completely ignore the<br/>\n&gt; exception,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; in both testing and production.  Don&#39;t like that<br/>\n&gt; at<br/>\n&gt; &gt; all.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I agree, but at some point, you have to trust the<br/>\n&gt; people doing the work to do <br/>\n&gt; the work. If they ignore exceptions both in tests<br/>\n&gt; and in production, then <br/>\n&gt; perhaps you need to replace them. :)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; So, I&#39;ve decided to knuckle down and NOT use<br/>\n&gt; &gt; unchecked exceptions whenever possible.  This<br/>\n&gt; *forces*<br/>\n&gt; &gt; you to handle them.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t like the patterns that checked exceptions<br/>\n&gt; compel me to use: converted <br/>\n&gt; exception, and so on... it all sounds like jumping<br/>\n&gt; through hoops just to <br/>\n&gt; satisfy the compiler. My job is to make tests run,<br/>\n&gt; dammit, not to make the <br/>\n&gt; compiler happy!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; That fact that you say using them allows the<br/>\n&gt; compiler<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to &#39;get in the way&#39; sounds like a non-issue.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;sounds like&quot;? With respect, do you *know* that it<br/>\n&gt; is a nonissue? (If so, how <br/>\n&gt; do I make it go away?!) For me, it *is* an issue;<br/>\n&gt; otherwise, I wouldn&#39;t feel <br/>\n&gt; so strongly. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I want to let exceptions propagate as much as<br/>\n&gt; possible, because exceptions <br/>\n&gt; represent situations where my code has to throw up<br/>\n&gt; its hands and say, &quot;Man, I <br/>\n&gt; can&#39;t go any further.&quot; In most cases, that&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; unrecoverable within the layer <br/>\n&gt; and I want to propagate the exception up to the<br/>\n&gt; caller. In that case, checked <br/>\n&gt; exceptions couple the caller to callee unnecessarily<br/>\n&gt; at compile time. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Yes, the caller needs to be aware of and handle the<br/>\n&gt; exception; however, I&#39;m <br/>\n&gt; not convinced that the compiler is the only way to<br/>\n&gt; achieve that. We&#39;ve <br/>\n&gt; managed quite nicely without the compiler&#39;s help and<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m happy with the <br/>\n&gt; results. Again: that&#39;s what tests are for and that&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; why code is written by <br/>\n&gt; humans and not automatically generated.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Is this<br/>\n&gt; &gt; coupling between your two systems?  Maybe...but I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; (personally) would rather have it and make damn<br/>\n&gt; sure<br/>\n&gt; &gt; those exceptions are handled.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What fear are you addressing by using checked<br/>\n&gt; exceptions? Since it is <br/>\n&gt; possible to get along without them, you may be<br/>\n&gt; afraid of something in order <br/>\n&gt; to want to use them. What might that be?
