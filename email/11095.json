One of the concerns that I (and<br/>\n&gt;developers) have is that we will end up with thousands of test cases, many<br/>\n&gt;of which will involve using substantial amounts of MockObjects to set up<br/>\n&gt;test cases and that all this will become too much of an overhead to manage &<br/>\n&gt;maintain. Specifically,  that changing code in the future will involve<br/>\n&gt;analysis of not only the project code but also the junit test code - an<br/>\n&gt;overhead we don&#39;t have today of course.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;Has anyone applied junit on a large scale such as this? I&#39;d love to hear<br/>\n&gt;comments about pros & cons and lessons learned etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;Rgds,<br/>\n&gt;Kevin. </span></blockquote></div>",
