So many of the questions on this list are from <br/>\n&gt; beginners too lazy to use Google that, as a balance, I like <br/>\n&gt; these discussions (not theological rants, by the way--no need <br/>\n&gt; to insult--I, for one, am pragmatic in my discussion, so <br/>\n&gt; would that be applied theology?).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I wouldn&#39;t call this a &quot;low-traffic list&quot; but I agree 100%<br/>\nwith your second sentence.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, there&#39;s a very low number of lazy non-Googler<br/>\nquestions in my inbox today for some reason.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTodd.</div>",
