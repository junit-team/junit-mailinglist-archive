So to\neverybody who&#39;s reading this: please comment on this question.\n\nWhat do you think about Joe Walnes&#39; Flexible JUnit\nassertions&lt;http://64.233.161.104/search?q=cache:k4i4bq5MGYMJ:joe.truemesh.com/blog/000511.html+&gt;(this\nis a link to Google&#39;s cache because his site seems to be down at the\nmoment) and my aproach&lt;http://saloon.javaranch.com/cgi-bin/ubb/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic&f=68&t=000944&gt;\n?\n\nOn 10/22/05, Kent Beck &lt;kentb@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Thank you for the feedback. My own experience and that of most of the\n&gt; people\n&gt; who have responded is that @Before and @After read well. I suppose it\n&gt; depends a little on how many annotations are present. I don&#39;t use any\n&gt; other\n&gt; annotations in my code, but I can see that @BeforeTestMethod might stand\n&gt; out\n&gt; better if there were many other annotations.
