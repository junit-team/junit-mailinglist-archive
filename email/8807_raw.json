[I am not saying it isn&#39;t there, I just couldn&#39;t\nfind it by my search criteria.]\n\nI have a lot of unit tests, I usually run them inside the Eclipse test\nrunner (that finds all my tests in a project) or the Ant test runner (which\nagain finds all). As such, I&#39;ve given up on test suites as unnecessary for\nmy purposes. [The effort to &quot;wire tests together&quot; is more than I need/want,\nand might even limit me from just adding new tests whenever needed.] This\n&quot;test suite&quot; part may be unimportant, or not...\n\nI write unit tests for the low level objects, and also for the higher level\naggregating objects that use them. This helps me track down the cause of\nhigh level failures much easier. When junit detects problems and things fail\nI get a (sometimes long) list of failures. Finding the &quot;root cause&quot; problem\nmeans sifting through all the failures (including the aggregating failures)\nin order to find the problem, perhaps down in a low level class test. Since\nI can&#39;t control the order of execution (it is likely package alphabetical or\nsomething), I can&#39;t tell what is the lowest level test. I&#39;d like to reduce\nthe effort invested here.\n\nI was wondering if jUnit could introduce the concept of &quot;optional test\ndependencies&quot;, test X depends upon Y -- i.e. test Y runs before test X, and\ntest X runs IFF test Y succeeds.\n\nI wouldn&#39;t want to do this for every test, and it ought be user optional,\nbut I could see it as being a big benefit. I am sure there is some fancier\nOO way to explain/implement this [or even a nicer introspection way to\ndetermine this], but something like a TestCase.setDependency(Class\ntestClass) so TestCase constructors mark what they&#39;d like to depend upon.\n[For introspection maybe a public Class[] getDependencies()\ninterface/method].\n\nThe test runner engine would need to &quot;sort&quot; the calling order be dependency\ntree, and would need to know when not to call something, perhaps introducing\na new state (&quot;deferred&quot; -- meaning not run due to a dependency\nfailure/error -- to add to &quot;fail&quot;, &quot;error&quot;.)\n\nI know this is some work, but it seems (to me, at least) a simple yet\npowerful addition to jUnit. [That said, maybe I am missing something, such\nas test suites or something. Hmm ... maybe this dependency information could\nbe used to create anonymous suites on the fly...]\n\nThoughts?\n\nregards,\n\nAdam\n\nP.S. The Eclipse junit plugin that search projects to find all tests, find\ntests in dependant project, but doesn&#39;t run them &quot;in the CWD of that\nproject&quot; (which matters for some tests). This considered a bug, or just the\nway it is? I know of no way to have the search exclude dependent projects,\nis there one?\n--\n&lt;http://www.try.sybase.com&gt;\nExperience Sybase Technology ...\n\n\n",
