I am \nfinding that setUp and tearDown are not enough. I have a lot of code \nthat has to reset static state such as caches each time a test is \nrun, code that is only needed for unit testing. If each test method \nran in it&#39;s own JVM, my testing code would not require me to make \nchanges in the code I am testing.\n\nIt&#39;s not just singletons but also caches that should be initialized \nonce for a JVM. And, honestly, if you think about it, each test \nmethod SHOULD be atomic. Mock objects seemed kind of like a kludge \nfor tests not being run atomically.\n\nThoughts?\n\nR.\n\n\n\n\n",
