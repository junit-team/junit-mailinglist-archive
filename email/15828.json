It also helps<br/>\n&gt; for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the diagnostic:  instead of telling the user &quot;101 tests failed&quot;, you can<br/>\n&gt; &gt; tell them &quot;1 test failed, 100 tests were skipped&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I disagree. I occasionally do something stupid like that that breaks all<br/>\n&gt; or nearly all of my tests. Seeing that 90%+ of the tests are failing is<br/>\n&gt; a *huge* clue as to exactly what&#39;s going wrong. It keeps me from wasting<br/>\n&gt; time looking for small bugs in one class as I might do if only the first<br/>\n&gt; test failed.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I would argue that you are still wasting time since the report gives you 100<br/>\ntests to choose from, which is a bit silly since it knows *exactly* which<br/>\none failed and *exactly* which ones were skipped.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy would you prefer to read &quot;101 tests failed&quot; over &quot;1 test failed, 100<br/>\ntests skipped&quot;?<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nCédric<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
