This runner \nshould extract the tests either from jar file package or file system \nclass in a transparent way unlike two separate classes as in \nJUNIT-ADD-on i.e DirectorySuiteBuilder  and ArchiveSuiteBuilder..\n\nBy doing this, i would be eliminating all the TestXYZPackageSuite class \nwhich has suite method. This suite method creates a Test out all the \npackage classes and includes  suites of sub packages.\n\nI tried write some thing on my own using JUNIT-Addon&#39;s but looks like \nDirectorySuiteBuilder expects the directory in a similar lines of class \npath, i.e if there is java class in \n/home/classes/com/sun/rewriter/util/Parser.class then i need to give \ndirectory name as /home/classes and not \n/home/classes/com/sun/rewriter/util/.\n\nI would still believe that this could be achieved by doing some \nmodifications to DirectorySuiteBuilder, but i would be glad it this \nfeature gets into JUNIT-Add-ons as this could do away Suite class which \nare needed (as good practice) for every package.\n\nVladimir R. Bossicard could please help..I have also attached code which \nwas written using you API in JUNIT-Add-ons, could please see what i am \nmissing...\n\nThanking you in advance..\n\nRegards,\nNagendra\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n",
