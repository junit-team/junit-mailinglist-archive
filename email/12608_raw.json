One\n&gt; side effect of doing that is it gives me an extra layer of context (a\n&gt; namespace) on top of the test method name.  So, given my limited\n&gt; knowledge of your problem domain, I might have a test case like this:\n&gt; \n&gt;    public class OneSalesOrderLineTest extends TestCase {\n&gt; \n&gt;      public void setUp() {\n&gt;        // fixture for one sales order line\n&gt;      }\n&gt; \n&gt;      public void testCreateMultipleCustomerPurchaseOrderEntries() {\n&gt;      }\n&gt; \n&gt;      public void testSomethingElseAboutOneSalesOrderLine() {\n&gt;      }\n&gt;    }\n\nClose, except I don&#39;t make the mistake you&#39;ve (purposefully) made\nhere, including the &#39;multiple&#39; test with the &#39;oneLineItem&#39; test.\n\nMy test class in this case is called something like\n&quot;SpecificClientMappingSupportTest&quot; where &#39;SpecificClient&#39; is the name\nof one of our clients who has a bit of byzantine business logic that\nmust be supported by our system.  The tests all rely on fixtures that\nconfigure the system to understand that it&#39;s reading data for this\nclient, and that create inputs that resemble those that would come\nfrom other parts of the system for this client.\n\nSo, like you, I&#39;m reading the tests in this class, and I know I&#39;m in\nthe context of the StarbucksMapperSupport (Starbucks is not the real\nname, just a name I can see from my window).\n\n&gt; &gt; This particular example is partly about readability (you could infer a\n&gt; &gt; lot of the information, possibly, from the method name) and part about\n&gt; &gt; disambiguity.  There are other tests involving CustomerPurchaseOrders\n&gt; &gt; and Sales Order Lines that are similar.\n&gt; \n&gt; Does using a separate test case help with the ambiguity?\n\nI&#39;m not sure what you mean here.  I&#39;m trying to disambiguate this\ntestcase with another testCase that is named similarly:\n\ntestMultipleCustomerPurchaseOrderEntriesForManySalesOrderLinesWithDuplicates();\n\nThat test too has commentary describing the situation.  That one has a\nbug# as well, apparently I did it wrong at one point in time.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Most of the time, these comments are written before the test.  I guess\n&gt; &gt; you could say I practice document-first test development.  I write a\n&gt; &gt; sentence or two about what the test is going to do (or just a method\n&gt; &gt; name if it suffices -- you&#39;re right that it often does) then I write\n&gt; &gt; the test.\n&gt; \n&gt; I often use that technique, as well.  By writing out prose, I find\n&gt; words that I&#39;d like to use in the test method name.\n\nTrue, and most often I do the same thing.  But there are cases where I\nfelt that the prose held more information than the method name I came\nup with.  I&#39;d already written the prose, so I left it to guide me in\nthe implementation, and describe the situation to the maintainers.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Ultimately, why wouldn&#39;t you want to write actual sentences?  I like\n&gt; &gt; Java a lot, but English was my first language.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m not saying you should never write sentences.  However, if I can\n&gt; convey the same meaning in a method name, I&#39;ll do that instead of\n&gt; maintaining two separate pieces of information (the sentence and the\n&gt; method name).\n\nI think folks are overstating my intentions a bit:  I&#39;m *not* saying\nthat *all* tests need javadoc documentation, I&#39;m not even saying that\nmost of them do.  The only point I&#39;m making is that occasionally you\nneed it, and not shipping the javadoc (the original question) makes\nthat occasional-but-important information unavailable to whoever is\nusing the unit tests.\n\n-Kevin Klinemeier\n\n",
