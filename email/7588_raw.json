That&#39;s just ridiculous. That is what is \nimmature.\n&gt; \n&gt; If you show a lack of maturity, it becomes infectious. That&#39;s \nhuman nature.\n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s not about emotional involvement; it&#39;s about people making \nclaims they have no business making that make us look bad. I just \ndon&#39;t see why we should accept that.\n&gt; \n&gt; Take care.\n\nI had enough information and frustration about JUnit/TDD to start a \ndiscussion.\n\nMany Universities researched for testing methods. Many academics \ndon&#39;t seem to like JUnit/TDD paradigma.\n\nFirst I thought that this is only academic.\n\nBut then I found a commercial tool (JTest) which seems to exactly do \nwhat I was looking for.\n\nEverything must be questioned. Otherwise no progress is possible.\n\n\n\nYahoo! Groups Sponsor\n\n\n\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\njunit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n\n\nYour use of Yahoo!
