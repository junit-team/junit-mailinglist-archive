[...]\n&gt; \n&gt; Jason, I think you mean &quot;not indexed&quot;. Arrays are not &quot;ordered&quot; (in\n&gt; the  mathematical sense), they are &quot;indexed&quot;. If you need a\ncollection\n\nSounds like a case where an array is being used to collect (with an\norder implied by the index) something that is actually unordered and a\ndesire to have the test ignore ordering. An unordered collection is the\nway to go here.\n\nI&#39;ve actually got some tests now that require a partial ordering of\nresults. Unfortunately, our current tests only compare against one\nlegal ordering (which means the test only works reliably when the\nthreading code is disabled). My unconcious mind keeps telling me I\nshould write (or find) a directed (acyclic) graph class to hold the\nexpected results and verify that the actual results are a legal\ntopological sort based on the partial ordering of the graph. Haven&#39;t\nactually done it.\n\nRegards,\n\nRob\n\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nMake international calls for as low as $.04/minute with Yahoo!
