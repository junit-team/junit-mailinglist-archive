The original intent was that users would write their own<br/>\n&gt; runner-esque code to run their tests.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>IMO it was to be able to run tests wherever they are (on an embedded device for<br/>\nexample).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Do you mean besides the TestListeners that can register themselves<br/>\n&gt; with TestResult itself?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Currently you can&#39;t define your own TestListener object and tell JUnit to<br/>\ninclude them into the list of listeners...<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; A listener architecture is kind of what we do in SuiteRunner, in that<br/>\n&gt; you can specify multiple Reporters for a single test run, as many as you<br/>\n&gt; want.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>and that&#39;s what you would do if you design your application to run tests.  JUnit<br/>\nwas first design to let &quot;tests run themself&quot; (without the need of an external<br/>\napplication).  The JUnit TestRunners are more spectators than actors when it<br/>\ncomes to running the tests.  SuiteRunner is the opposite and this is reflected<br/>\nby the design decisions you made.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; That&#39;s true, but I still have the question: What does running each<br/>\n&gt; test method in its own instance buy you that setUp and tearDown <br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t already buy you? <br/>\n&gt; [...] Running each test method in its own instance shields you from <br/>\n&gt; any problem.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>you answered your question :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Also, is it not true that by forcing every test method into its own<br/>\n&gt; instance, then tests can&#39;t share a fixture.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>double-negation... :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nI make a difference between &quot;sharing results&quot; and &quot;sharing resource&quot;:<br/>\n<br/>\nA resource is something that is costy to acquire (like a connection to a db, a<br/>\nnetwork, a CORBA bridge, whatever).  JUnit was not design for integration tests<br/>\nand does not deal with these issues very nicely (your tests acquire a resource<br/>\nin the setUp method).  If it can save you seconds when you run the tests,<br/>\nsharing a resource is totally fine<br/>\n<br/>\n- sharing results is more controversial and can have some undesirable<br/>\nside-effects (discussed in previous mail).  If tests share their results, it&#39;s<br/>\nimpossible to rerun them separately (if you&#39;re a JUnit SwingUI fan, it&#39;s an<br/>\nissue).  That&#39;s why I don&#39;t like my tests to share their results<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; What do you usually tell people who want testB to use the results <br/>\n&gt; of testA?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>don&#39;t do that.  But if you really need, you can always invoke one test method<br/>\nfrom another one.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Vladimir<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nVladimir R. Bossicard<br/>\nwww.bossicard.com</div>",
