I want to make that decision in my test\nclass and not in the class that runs the suite.\n\nI think one time setup/teardown is appropriate when\nyou have a static set of data and you are testing\nmethods that read and write that data in a set way. \nFor my application, I&#39;m testing database mappings and\na thesarus used in converting individual values.  The\nsource data only needs to be loaded once, not for\nevery test.\n\nIn fact, the more I think about it, I would probably\nend up using one time setup/teardown a lot more than\nthe standard setup/teardown mechanism and it has\nnothing to do with how I&#39;ve factored my application. \nSo, having either an overloaded setUp/tearDown,\nseparate set of methods, or a tag interface to allow\none time setup/teardown makes a lot of sense to me.\n\nCurt\n---  &lt;jbase@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; I have used one time setup and teardown when testing\n&gt; tools that work on directories and files.  I want a\n&gt; know set of directories and files (and for a backup\n&gt; tool the dates).  I don&#39;t see the value in\n&gt; setup/teardown for each unit test.  This assumes the\n&gt; tool/tests do not change the setup.\n&gt; \n&gt; The only problem was &quot;tricking&quot; junit to allow this.\n&gt;  I could have done this in ant but sometimes, during\n&gt; developement I use jedit and junit and not ant.\n&gt; \n&gt; I would like junit to support a onetime\n&gt; setup/teardown for some types of tools, although it\n&gt; is possible I would get lazy and use in when I\n&gt; shouldn&#39;t.\n&gt; \n&gt; jeb\n&gt; \n&gt; _______________________________________________\n&gt; Can a Web portal forever change your life?\n&gt; Win up to $25 Million on iWon - http://www.iwon.com\n&gt; \n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
