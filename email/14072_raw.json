Given the \namount of time my tests spend waiting for the network or doing I/O, not \nto mention the benefits of true multiprocessor system, I wouldn&#39;t be \nsurprised if running multiple tests in parallel could cut execution time \nin half or more.\n\nIn the most extreme case I&#39;ve encountered, the full test suite takes \ncouple of hours to run. However, that&#39;s almost all spent waiting for the \nnetwork, so it would be extremely parallelizable.
