It doesn&#39;t mean \ndon&#39;t repeat at run time. It is a principle of code clarity, not a \nprinciple of optimization. What is a loop but a set of statements \nrepeated a few thousand times at run time but only once in code? Indeed, \na compiler might even unroll the loop so the compiled code repeats itself.\n\nWhen I try to optimize anything, including test suites, the first thing \nI do is profile. If the profiler shows I&#39;m spending a lot of time doing \nsetup work, I&#39;ll try to optimize that away. If it doesn&#39;t show that, I \nwon&#39;t waste my time making the code less clear. Optimizing tests is no \ndifferent than optimizing anything else. Optimization in absence of real \ndata is at best pointless and at worst actively harmful. It usually \nmakes code less clear for no measurable speed gain.\n\nI have indeed profiled my test suites, and so far I&#39;ve only found \noccasional cases where repeated  test setup via constructors or setUp \nmethods was a noticeable hot spot. In those few cases I&#39;ve taken steps \nto eliminate the repeated initialization, often by moving fixtures into \nlocal variables. However, well over 90% of the time the cost of test \ninitialization and the construction of TestCase objects has been \nnegligible.\n\n-- \nElliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nXML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim\n\n",
