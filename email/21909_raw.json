Or would it report a crash?)=\r\n.\n\nBut anyway, after playing with this for a while, I just did an assumeTha=\r\nt in the @BeforeClass method, and that worked out fine. IDEA doesn&#39;t report=\r\n the ignored tests as nicely, but that&#39;s life. I got to eliminate a lot of =\r\nbrittle complicated code around the runner, so it was worthwhile.\n\nI used t=\r\nhe @Rule for the external resource, which really saved the @Before and @Aft=\r\ner inheritence issue (the fact that it doesn&#39;t inherit), so ultimately 4.7 =\r\nreally improved my testing code infrastructure.\n\nSo good job.\n\nThe thing th=\r\nat got my brain tied in knots is the expectation that rules interact, or ha=\r\nve some kind of series to them. But that is just an association with the wo=\r\nrd &quot;rule&quot; and has nothing to do with how JUnit is doing the @Rule annotatio=\r\nn, which is fine once you get it.\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, David Saff=\r\n &lt;david@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m trying to think this one through.
