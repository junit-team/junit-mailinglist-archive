To JUnit, tests are independent, clean up after\nthemselves, and can be run in any order.  If your tests are dependent\non certain other tests being run before them, then you need to package\nthem into a single test.\n\nIt sounds like you can&#39;t run the later ones if the earlier ones fail,\nanyway.  I&#39;d but them all in a method named testSomething and use the\nString parameter to the assert() call to tell you which test failed\nand why.\n\nIf you really want them to be independent, use the setUp and tearDown\nmethods to provide the necessary environment.\n\n - George\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Boris Boehlen [mailto:boris@...-aachen.de]\n\t[snip]\n&gt; Simply rename your test methods so they don&#39;t start with *test* word, this\n&gt; will prevent them to be executed by TestRunner.\n\nThis is a possible solution I found too. IMHO this is not very useful in \nmy case, because I still like to know which tests succeeded and which\ndidn&#39;t.\nUnfortunately this does only work if you have written &quot;testXXX&quot; methods\nbecause\nJUnit invokes these methods independantly. \n\n&gt; Dependent actions should be written within one test case. There was\n&gt; a discussion on this mailing list few weeks ago (look for the thread\n[junit]\n&gt; Order of Tests).\nI found these discussions and do not agree. In my application area the \nresult is that I have several mini test case which depend heavily on\neach other. The glue between them would be a number of test cases which \nmust themselves be used in larger test suites (can I nest test suites,\nbtw?).\n\nRegards\n\tBoris Boehlen\n\n",
