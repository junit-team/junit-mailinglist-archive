If you have 100 XML documents, you&#39;re almost certainly doing\n&gt;  something wrong. The most obvious question I&#39;d ask is &quot;How big is the\n\nYes, I think in same way, but I still ordered to move more code to XML\nto make it more configurable. Yes, ordered.\n\n&gt;  application?&quot; It might be too big and needs to be modularized. Another\n&gt;  question I&#39;d ask is &quot;What do your layers look like?&quot; It might be poorly\n&gt;  layered.\n&gt;\n\nVery likely there are room of improvement. However, I think, if the\nmanagement put configurable as the highest priority, moving most class\nmember to XML configuration (spring in our case) . No matter how well\nthe modularized / layering, there still a lot of config file and make\nthing more complicate than it should be.\n\n&gt;  Also, why do we need to test our configuration files? I was under the\n&gt;  impression that the goal of externalizing configuration is to make it\n&gt;  /easy/ to change how the application behaves. If that&#39;s no longer easy,\n&gt;  we must stop externalizing configuration data and figure out what we&#39;re\n&gt;  doing wrong.\n\nInteresting it can be easier in some organization, once the\napplication pressed UAT and if some thing required code change, we\nneed to complete a number of process like &quot;permit to build&quot; , &quot;user\napproval&quot;, &quot;cost estimation&quot; ......  Moving code to config in fact\nprovide &quot;hole&quot; to bypassed all those procedures to make quick change.\nAnd that is the reason why management prefer more config.\n\nI can understand, what I think we can improve is there are some\nvariable that is just not make sense to be configurable, like change\nthe default will break the application, but we still ordered to make\nit configurable just because there are possible to change.....\n\nActually it is off-topic a lot. in fact I just like to make the point\nthat IoC framework is not magic and there are cases that using pattern\nlike &quot;only create once&quot; is better to make it configurable. In fact, I\nthink this case is a lot more than we expect.\n\n",
