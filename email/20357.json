In JUnit 3.8 you have an option to add<br/>\nsome methods from one class and some methods from the another class.<br/>\nSee also related topic &quot;Filter improvement&quot;. I think this<br/>\nfunctionality should be available also here, perhaps, with futher<br/>\nimprovement, such as use of patterns. <br/>\nAt least one should be able to run couples of methods from the given<br/>\nclass. When I have some related tests I preferred to run them<br/>\naltogether and to look what is fails. It helps me both to save the<br/>\ntime and to identify the problem. I feel lack of this in JUnit 4.</div>",
