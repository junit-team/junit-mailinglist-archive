Public APIs are rigid and <br/>\ninflexible. Public APIs can&#39;t be easily changed. Private and package <br/>\nprotected APIs can be. The less you have that&#39;s public the more flexible <br/>\nyour design is.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow if you genuinely discover that a private method would be more <br/>\nbroadly useful, and therefore should be public, fine. However if all <br/>\nyou&#39;re doing is splitting up one large unwieldy class into two or more <br/>\nsmaller classes, then the total number of public methods should not <br/>\nchange. Most methods that were private in the old class should stay <br/>\nprivate when moved to the new class. perhaps a few will become <br/>\npackage-protected instead. But they certainly shouldn&#39;t change to public <br/>\njust because they&#39;re moved from class A to class B.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n﻿Elliotte Rusty Harold  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:elharo@...\">elharo@...</a><br/>\nXML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/\">http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim\">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim</a></div>",
