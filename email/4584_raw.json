I was able to call a \nprivate method by using method.setAccessible(true).\nI agree that in general one should not test private methods, but when \nexceptions arise, this approach seems least intrusive. This is also \nan example of Active Code generation that many people are using these \ndays.\n\nMichael, I know that you have a fine commercial product. However I am \nlooking for an open source implementation. If there are others on the \nlist that have the same need please contact me.\n\nRegards,\n\nDavid\n\n--- In junit@y..., &quot;Michael Silverstein&quot; &lt;msilverstein@s...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; What we did with Test Mentor - Java Edition is create a set of \ngeneric\n&gt; objects that you configure for executing methods, constructors or\n&gt; accessing/setting fields. These objects transparently take care of \nall the\n&gt; reflection stuff for you. You set up these objects with code or \nwith a\n&gt; special visual test composition UI provided by the tool, or through \ntest\n&gt; generation from recorded object interactions.

It looks like it is possible to\n&gt; &gt; override access security in the latest JVMs -- look at JUnitX. I\n&gt; &gt; would like to fine a tool that can generate a wrapper class\n&gt; &gt; automatically and expose all methods as public.
