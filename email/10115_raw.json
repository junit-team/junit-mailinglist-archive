First, my email is kevin at grogdog dot com, not whatever\nyahoo groups puts in here.  Second, this file WAS still in the Files\narea, it&#39;s just that it&#39;s in a subtree called src.

To do that (say five times):\n\n  return new RepeatedTest(new RandomTestSuite(suite), 5);\n\nK\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, junit@yahoogroups.com wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; Hello,\n&gt; \n&gt; This email message is a notification to let you know that\n&gt; a file has been uploaded to the Files area of the junit \n&gt; group.\n&gt; \n&gt;   File        : /RandomTestSuite.java \n&gt;   Uploaded by : b9n &lt;kevinb@m...&gt; \n&gt;   Description : Run your tests in random order \n&gt; \n&gt; You can access this file at the URL\n&gt; \n&gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/junit/files/RandomTestSuite.java \n&gt; \n&gt; To learn more about file sharing for your group, please visit\n&gt; \n&gt; http://help.yahoo.com/help/us/groups/files\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; b9n &lt;kevinb@m...&gt;\n\n\n",
