I&#39;m in the<br/>\n&gt; unfortunate situation of having to write tests for an existing<br/>\n&gt; application(I haven&#39;t been involved in the development). ´<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Unfortunate? This is the standard situation in most processes: Test are<br/>\nwritten after development or in parallel to it. What&#39;s so unfortunate about<br/>\nwriting tests?<br/>\n<br/>\nI would recommend that you read Boris Beizer&#39;s &quot;Black Box Testing&quot; -<br/>\nalthough I&#39;m still struggling how to integrate its wisdom with modern<br/>\ntooling, it is definitely worth to get a grip on &quot;pure testing&quot; (the<br/>\n&quot;tester&#39;s job&quot;).<br/>\n<br/>\nTechnically, I do not see why you shouldn&#39;t be able to write unit tests for<br/>\nselected classes with JUnit - if the design is suitable.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut of course there are many more ways to skin a cat - various xUnit tools;<br/>\nbut also GUI testing tools [not for you], load testing tools (very<br/>\nexpensive!), and many more.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo you should first have an concept of <br/>\n<br/>\n* what you want to test: Functional correctness; but maybe also performance;<br/>\nusability; reliability; ...<br/>\n<br/>\n* to which level of granularity, e.g.<br/>\n  - methods of single classes; or of facade classes hiding a complete<br/>\n&quot;system&quot;;<br/>\n  - single web page clicks, or whole work-flows;<br/>\n<br/>\n* to which level of quality, e.g.<br/>\n  - only critical functions (e.g. defined by &quot;draw most bug reports in the<br/>\nlast 3 monts&quot;);<br/>\n  - everything to some coverage level; then you need to decide on <br/>\n  -- the coverage level (&quot;80%&quot; is in &quot;industry standard&quot;; &quot;100% feasible<br/>\ncoverage&quot; is the only sensible standard)<br/>\n  -- the type of coverage (code coverage; or some &quot;feature coverage&quot; - all<br/>\nthe features down written in some specification or documentation)<br/>\n<br/>\n... I hope this wasn&#39;t too general ...<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards<br/>\nHarald M.
