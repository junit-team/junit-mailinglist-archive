The last<br/>\noption about embedding the tests in the class may make<br/>\nthe code basedifficult to manage. You will have to<br/>\nhave all of the testing resources in your classpath on<br/>\nproduction etc which does not make much sense. There<br/>\nis a tool called ANT which we will be using to manage<br/>\nthe codebase. You can get to build all the code run<br/>\nthe tests and deploy to production all in one script.<br/>\nI really like Together J but I have started using<br/>\nnetbeans. It&#39;s totally free which my boss likes alot.<br/>\nThe module for junit in that will create a test class<br/>\nfor each class that contains empty test methods.  I am<br/>\nalso considering a test sub directory in each package<br/>\ninstead. I think the avoiding deployment of the tests<br/>\nto production makes sense.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<br/>\n<br/>\nDavid <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Steven Webster &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:steven.webster@...\">steven.webster@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;ve inherited a huge codebase which I&#39;ll be taking<br/>\n&gt; over development for; as soon as<br/>\n&gt; possible, I want to put skeletal JUnit tests in<br/>\n&gt; place for every class; as I perform<br/>\n&gt; refactorings, and as I introduce new functionality,<br/>\n&gt; my intention is to first flesh out<br/>\n&gt; JUnit tests, before adding feature/refactoring.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This raises several questions, most of all related<br/>\n&gt; to what are the best practices<br/>\n&gt; for keeping Unit Tests alongside code.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Options as I see them:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 1.    A separate directory tree with a root note of<br/>\n&gt; test, the package structure of<br/>\n&gt;       which reflects that of the codebase; keep the<br/>\n&gt; tests completely isolated from<br/>\n&gt;       production code, the downside being that if I<br/>\n&gt; refactor code around packages,<br/>\n&gt;       I have to remember to move tests as well;<br/>\n&gt; also, removes my ability to test<br/>\n&gt;       private and protected methods..<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 2.    A &#39;test&#39; directory in each package of the<br/>\n&gt; codebase, containing TestXXXX<br/>\n&gt;       classes; with a TestXXXX class for each XXXX<br/>\n&gt; class in the package above.<br/>\n&gt;       Again, can&#39;t test public/protected methods,<br/>\n&gt; and a little extra work is     <br/>\n&gt;       required to remove tests from production code,<br/>\n&gt; but not that much.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 3.    Actually make each class in the production<br/>\n&gt; code it&#39;s own test, ie put the<br/>\n&gt;       JUnit testing code in the class itself.  This<br/>\n&gt; gives me access to protected<br/>\n&gt;       and private methods, AND makes it easy to<br/>\n&gt; refactor and move tests around.<br/>\n&gt;       Another upside is that the JUnit plugin for<br/>\n&gt; Together UML will create all<br/>\n&gt;       these test skeletons for me in this manner. <br/>\n&gt; Downside (and I see it as a <br/>\n&gt;       pretty big downside) is that my JUnit tests<br/>\n&gt; are all but impossible to remove<br/>\n&gt;       from my production code.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Has anyone got any thoughts on this problem ?   <br/>\n&gt; Anyone been in a similar<br/>\n&gt; situation, and got suggestions they could offer ?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Cheers,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Steven<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet personalized email addresses from Yahoo!
