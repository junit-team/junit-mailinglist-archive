I use a special createFile(...) method to, of course, create the file, as well as track it in a Vector to be cleaned up on every tearDown();<br/>\n<br/>\nWould it be better to increment the root directory name and then delete all the structures at the end of all test cases?  Or would this present a similar problem when joining multiple tests from multiple test classes (provided they also access the file system in a similar manner).  <br/>\n<br/>\nandrew f<br/>\n<br/>\n```````````````````````<br/>\nA common idea is to kill a folder on the file system after every test, in order to start with a &quot;clean slate&quot;. Unfortunately, the<br/>\ntests are too fast for the file system, so the file system isn&#39;t clean<br/>\nbefore the next test starts.<br/>\n```````````<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
