I am not surprised as\nrunning =\r\nCppUnit (Eclipse on Windows with CDT) I found it too flaky to\ncount on.  Is=\r\n this because the group doesn&#39;t see C++ as a future\nlanguage?  It might not=\r\n be.  I lobbied to use Real-Time Java instead\nof C++, to no avail.  Later, =\r\nwhen it was too late to change, the\nproject manager told me Java would have=\r\n been a better choice.\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kent Beck&quot; &lt;kentb@..=\r\n.&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; All,\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; At the Agile Open Northwest conference I hel=\r\nd an open space session\non the\n&gt; future of testing tools. I expected to tal=\r\nk a little about Theories and\n&gt; assertThat, but we ended up having a wide-r=\r\nanging discussion about a\nvariety\n&gt; of topics. I mind-mapped the result and=\r\n put in on the conference wiki: \n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.agileopennorthwest.com/cgi=\r\n-bin/wiki.pl?FutureOfUnitTesting\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; The most surprising result to =\r\nme was the interest in language\nfeatures for\n&gt; testing-what would a languag=\r\ne look like that included\ndouble-checking as a\n&gt; first-class concept? I was=\r\n also surprised at how much commonality\nthere was\n&gt; between the unit and fu=\r\nnctional testing &quot;vendors&quot;, that reporting is\na big\n&gt; issue for everyone.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; One thing missing from the discussion was much talk about the ho=\r\npes and\n&gt; dreams of users, so I thought I would open up the question here.\n=\r\nWhat is it\n&gt; you wish your testing tool would do for you that it doesn&#39;t?\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Kent Beck\n&gt; \n&gt; Three Rivers Institute\n&gt; \n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n\n\n\n",
