S=\r\nome issues I have include:\n\n1. We have many test cases and test suites, and=\r\n it is common to\nduplicate a method name in more than one test case.  e.g.\n=\r\ntestAccessProperties() may appear many times, so if one of them fails,\nits =\r\nnot readily obvious WHICH one failed.  I usually have included the\nname of =\r\nthe test case in the test method&#39;s name, but other developers\nhere aren&#39;t w=\r\nilling to do that.  e.g.\n&quot;testOurTestCase_accessProperties&quot;.  Test case inf=\r\no should appear in\nthe results too so that we don&#39;t have to creatively name=\r\n the methods.\n\n2. I&#39;m producing one giant HTML report from the running of s=\r\neveral\ntest suites.  Each test suite is usually named AllTests.  The\nresult=\r\ning HTML shows a list of test cases all named AllTests, which\nisn&#39;t all tha=\r\nt helpful.\n\n3. It is normal for us to run the same test suite more than onc=\r\ne, but\nwith different data each time.  For example, our product has a commo=\r\nn\ninterface to access more than one type of server, so the same set of\ntest=\r\ns are invoked against more than one server (and this is controlled\nby provi=\r\nding a .properties file to the tests containing different info\nabout that s=\r\nerver).  The default behavior of the JUnit ant task\ncreated a file TEST-com=\r\n.blah.AllTests.xml file which kept getting\noverwritten with each subsequent=\r\n run of the tests against another\nserver; I solved this with the &quot;outfile&quot; =\r\nattribute so that each XML\nfile has a slightly different name, so I can at =\r\nleast preserve the\ndata.  But, the one giant HTML report isn&#39;t able to show=\r\n how one test\nrun is any different from another since it just lists\n&quot;com.bl=\r\nah.AllTests&quot; several times.  I need a way to annotate in the\ntest results w=\r\nhat each test run was for, even just a simple text\nstring would help.\n\nI re=\r\nalize some of these problems could be solved just by creating\nseveral diffe=\r\nrent HTML reports, each in its own directory appropriate\nnamed, and a highe=\r\nr-level HTML file with text descriptions and links\nto each HTML report.  Al=\r\nthough, we&#39;d kind of like one big report.\n\nHas anyone else worked out issue=\r\ns like these?  I have done a small\namount of extending JUnit (custom format=\r\nters, custom runners), so I&#39;m\nnot afraid of proceeding down that path.  Any=\r\none have tips on what has\nworked out well for them?\n\nThanks!\n\n\n\n\n\n",
