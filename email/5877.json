The<br/>\n&gt; original comment by DS was in response to another person&#39;s question<br/>\n&gt; regarding problems using JUnit for testing EJBs.  My text is marked with my<br/>\n&gt; initials, CD.  While I will take the advice of DS and have a look at the<br/>\n&gt; source, I wanted the group to have access to his opinion, to have feedback<br/>\n&gt; that could be used to make JUnit better for the next release.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; DS &gt; Junit internals suck. I would love to rewrite it, but don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; DS &gt; have the time.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; CD &gt; I&#39;ve been told before that the JUnit source code serves as a great <br/>\n&gt; CD &gt; example for writing good code.  Hence, your statement surprised me.  <br/>\n&gt; CD &gt; Since you&#39;re a respected developer of a great application server, I <br/>\n&gt; CD &gt; ask that you cite a few examples to support your statement.  I&#39;d <br/>\n&gt; CD &gt; really like to hear your side of the story.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; DS &gt; Read the source, and you will see what I am talking about.  I believe <br/>\n&gt; DS &gt; you misunderstood the comments from other people.  JUnit is a good <br/>\n&gt; DS &gt; example of successful software development and it is also a good<br/>\n&gt; example <br/>\n&gt; DS &gt; of XP development.  The problem with XP is that it is not designed for <br/>\n&gt; DS &gt; Library software (see the last chapter of the xp book), so it works<br/>\n&gt; good <br/>\n&gt; DS &gt; at what it was designed for, but it is difficult to expand.  They also <br/>\n&gt; DS &gt; use way too much inheritance and not enough interfaces.  Anyway, just <br/>\n&gt; DS &gt; read the code and be the judge for yourself.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>While I wouldn&#39;t put it the way that &quot;DS&quot; put it, I do agree with some<br/>\nof his assertions.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am constantly trying to figure out what is meant by the difference<br/>\nbetween &quot;Test&quot; and &quot;TestSuite&quot;.  Essentially, the way that the<br/>\ntestrunners work really confuses the issue.<br/>\n<br/>\nA TestCase is a collection of tests.  Each test is run by creating a new<br/>\ninstance of a class and passing in the method name of the &quot;test&quot; being<br/>\nrun.  However, in the process the TestCase is then treated like a<br/>\nTestSuite.  Unless a class implements the suite() method, there is no<br/>\nway to change how test runners will work.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had to perform such a hack for the Avalon testsuite software.  In<br/>\nthat scenario, I had the extended TestCase load the container that the<br/>\ncomponents run inside of, as well as the support classes and<br/>\nconfiguration information.  Unfortunately it is not terribly clean as<br/>\nmuch reflection based code suffers from that affliction.  I would like<br/>\nto alter the test framework for Avalon to basically have a *tester*<br/>\ncomponent that would look up the components in question from an existing<br/>\ncontainer and then run its suite of tests.  Unfortunately it doesn&#39;t fit<br/>\nthe JUnit framework way of doing things.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo further complicate the matters, there are extension classes in JUnit<br/>\nthat I do not use because I do not really understand what they are for.<br/>\nI know that JUnit works--which is really cool.  However, trying to<br/>\nfigure out *how* it works is a real PITA.  It becomes an obstacle when<br/>\ntrying to extend JUnit to work outside the simple case it was designed<br/>\nfor.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile in principle, I am against C#, there are some language constructs<br/>\nthat I find would be really nice in Java--most notably the concept of<br/>\nDelegates and Attributes.  I read an article how it would be easy to<br/>\nthrough a more powerful and flexible testing framework together using<br/>\nthose two features.  The test runner would collect all the testable<br/>\nclasses by their attributes, and then find out which test to runn on<br/>\nthe methods using delegates:  something like the following:<br/>\n<br/>\n[TestWith(SubtractionTester)]<br/>\nint subtract( int i1, int i2 )<br/>\n{<br/>\n     return i1 - i2;<br/>\n}<br/>\n<br/>\nThat way we can build a library of similar functionality--encouraging<br/>\na consistent naming scheme for methods so that you can reuse pre-written<br/>\ntests.  That reduces the amount of similar rework necessary for<br/>\ndifferent tests.<br/>\n<br/>\n(in order to get it to happen with JUnit, you would have to use XDoclet<br/>\nto create your own JavaDoc tags and manufacture your own Delegate style<br/>\nframework making a more powerful &quot;Method&quot; object).<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;They that give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety<br/>\n  deserve neither liberty nor safety.&quot;<br/>\n                 - Benjamin Franklin</div>",
