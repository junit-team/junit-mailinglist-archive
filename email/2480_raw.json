I&#39;ve used it a bit in IBM VAJ, and \nreally like it so far, but it would be great if I could interact with \nother users of this software, since alot of aspects of usage are \nstill pretty unclear.  But I cannot seem to find link or button in \nthe SourceForge page for posting to the list from the list archive \npage, even though the preceeding page clearly says &#39;Choose a list to \nbrowse, search, and post messages&#39;.\n\nI realize I may very well be missing something very simple that when \nexplained to me will make me feel quite dumb.  On the other hand, I \ndon&#39;t see very many postings in that public user list, so perhaps \nsomething there is broken?\n\nIs anyone else having similar frustrations, or is it just me?  The \nEasyMock alternative, I think, requires jdk 1.3, which IBM VAJ does \nnot yet support, so I was hoping to bank on the MockObjects framework \nto provide much needed help in building my unit-tests.\n\n\n",
