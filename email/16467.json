The general idea is that a failure is typically a problem with <br/>\nyour production code, whereas an error could be a problem with your <br/>\ntest, the environment, or a serious problem with your production code.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn general, unless I know exactly what caused the error (for example, <br/>\nbecause I just wrote the test), I run the tests again. If the error <br/>\npersists, I look for configuration problems.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe better you practise TDD, the less important the difference becomes.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope that helps.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ.
