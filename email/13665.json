It doesn&#39;t mean <br/>\ndon&#39;t repeat at run time. It is a principle of code clarity, not a <br/>\nprinciple of optimization. What is a loop but a set of statements <br/>\nrepeated a few thousand times at run time but only once in code? Indeed, <br/>\na compiler might even unroll the loop so the compiled code repeats itself.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I try to optimize anything, including test suites, the first thing <br/>\nI do is profile. If the profiler shows I&#39;m spending a lot of time doing <br/>\nsetup work, I&#39;ll try to optimize that away. If it doesn&#39;t show that, I <br/>\nwon&#39;t waste my time making the code less clear. Optimizing tests is no <br/>\ndifferent than optimizing anything else. Optimization in absence of real <br/>\ndata is at best pointless and at worst actively harmful. It usually <br/>\nmakes code less clear for no measurable speed gain.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have indeed profiled my test suites, and so far I&#39;ve only found <br/>\noccasional cases where repeated  test setup via constructors or setUp <br/>\nmethods was a noticeable hot spot. In those few cases I&#39;ve taken steps <br/>\nto eliminate the repeated initialization, often by moving fixtures into <br/>\nlocal variables. However, well over 90% of the time the cost of test <br/>\ninitialization and the construction of TestCase objects has been <br/>\nnegligible.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nElliotte Rusty Harold  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:elharo@...\">elharo@...</a><br/>\nXML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/\">http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim\">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim</a></div>",
