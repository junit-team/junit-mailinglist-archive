If that&#39;s not the case for some reason,<br/>\nthen I think you&#39;d also want to think about why that&#39;s the case before<br/>\njust going with examining serialization files.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; Even in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that case, though, testing that stuff saved with saveLicense can be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; loaded with loadLicense isn&#39;t a bad thing to do.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Yes.  Agreed.  But try to avoid using a file to do it.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Definitely.  Another poster (was it you, Dave?) suggested that String<br/>\nstreams are the way to go, and I agree with that.  If you need to share<br/>\nthese things between tests, make them fixtures and share them that way.<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nThe New Yahoo!
