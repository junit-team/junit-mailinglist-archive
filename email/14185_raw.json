[...]\n&gt; I found that the problem is with 1.4.6 and forward.  I have\n&gt; run the html through several html validators and they don&#39;t\n&gt; have any major issues, just missing 4.01 attributes that\n&gt; are not required.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m at a loss for what to do next, any ideas on what to look for or\n&gt; could someone provide another pair of eyes to look at the code?\n&gt; \n&gt; Any help is greatly appreciated.\n\nAh; you&#39;re talking about httpunit!\n\nHmmm...  And I see that you&#39;ve posted your question to the \nappropriate news group for that project, but have not received any \nresponses.\n\nI see that the HTML processing was &quot;improved&quot; in httpunit 1.5.  \n(Apparently &quot;improved&quot; applies to everyone except you.  For you, \nit&#39;s &quot;broken.&quot;  ;-)\n\nI still think the sourceforge httpunit-develop list is your best \nbet.  I&#39;d bug them again.\n\nYou might post a link to your question(s) with a brief summary here:\n  http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?HttpUnit\n(But it might not help either.)\n\n\n\n",
