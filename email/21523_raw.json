They\nall ass=\r\nume that you are testing a class that already exists, and if it\ndoes, they =\r\ngenerate one test per method of that class, which produces\nunhelpful test c=\r\nlasses with unhelpfully named tests.\n\n--Nat\n\n2009/4/19 Karl Krasnowsky &lt;kar=\r\nlkras@...&gt;:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; This question is really targeted to those who have =\r\nused Kent Beck&#39;s book,\n&gt; Test-Driven Development within the context of the =\r\nNetBeans IDE, otherwise\n&gt; please disregard.\n&gt;\n&gt; Maybe someone here can prov=\r\nide a pointer to already available information on\n&gt; this.\n&gt; I&#39;m using Kent =\r\nBeck&#39;s book, Test-Driven Development as a tutorial and was\n&gt; looking at how=\r\n i might use NetBeans with its JUnit plugin to mimic his\n&gt; recommended proc=\r\nesses, but right out of the gate I&#39;m having a fundamental\n&gt; issue.\n&gt; A stan=\r\ndard practice of KB&#39;s method is to code the test before any code is\n&gt; writt=\r\nen, and then backfill the empty bits (class, methods, variables, etc.)\n&gt; to=\r\n make the test work.\n&gt; for example, here&#39;s the first JUnit test he shows in=\r\n chapter 1 to begin\n&gt; building from:\n&gt; Code:\n&gt; public void testMultiplicati=\r\non() {\n&gt; Dollar five =3D new Dollar(5);\n&gt; five.times(2);\n&gt; assertEquals(10,=\r\n five.amount);\n&gt; }\n&gt;\n&gt; Problem I&#39;m having is, if I&#39;m creating tests out of =\r\nthe context of the Java\n&gt; project, tests in NB aren&#39;t created until you hav=\r\ne a class with runtime\n&gt; methods to create tests from. So I have a chicken =\r\negg sort of situation. NB\n&gt; would do the obvious thing, i.e., have tests ge=\r\nnerated from code, so the\n&gt; above doesn&#39;t make any sense as it implies that=\r\n the code is generated from\n&gt; the test, which is a cool idea of the IDE cou=\r\nld support it.\n&gt; I have experience using JUnit, so the framework itself isn=\r\n&#39;t in question,\n&gt; but how to apply this methodology within the IDE format i=\r\ns.\n&gt; Do I have to simply short-circuit the default process that NB and the =\r\nJUnit\n&gt; plugin manufacture?\n&gt;\n&gt; thanks in advance for any help on this,\n&gt; K=\r\narl\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n\n\n-- \nhttp://www.natpryce.com\n\n",
