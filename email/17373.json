But it&#39;s suffering to<br/>\n&gt; write JUnit cases. Because:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; 1. I need to know the correct result from the other way around and sometimes<br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s hard to find another way.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I understand, but if you don&#39;t know the correct result before you write <br/>\nthe code, then how do you know if you&#39;re writing the code correctly?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 2. Database and JSP pages are difficult to JUnit test.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, they are.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 3. Mock objects brings more than double efforts during the whole develop<br/>\n&gt; process.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Compared to what?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 4. Exception situation is not so easy to make as JUnit claims.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Can you give us an example, because I find it quite easy.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 3 friends in 3 different companies (small size and middle size company)<br/>\n&gt; complain JUnit as:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; 1. They planned JUnit testing firstly and they cannot keep it going. TIME<br/>\n&gt; reason?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If you do not need to do it correctly, then don&#39;t write tests. For <br/>\ndecades, programmers have pretended that writing correct code is not <br/>\npart of their job. They are wrong, and have always been wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 2. It consumes a lot of time but hard to find big problems. JUnit does find<br/>\n&gt; small problems as we expected.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I find this interesting: but finding all the small problems, there are <br/>\nvery few big problems.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?RidiculousSimplicityGivesRidiculousResources\">http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?RidiculousSimplicityGivesRidiculousResources</a><br/>\n<br/>\nCan you give us an example of a big problem that programmer testing with <br/>\nJUnit didn&#39;t help you/them find?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 3. JUnit testing is not effcient enough.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>In what way is it not efficient enough? What more of something do you <br/>\nexpect to get with the same amount of time?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 4. Best JUnit tester is the senior software developer. But senior guys hate<br/>\n&gt; to write test cases.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Senior guys don&#39;t have the responsibility to write correct code?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 5. For small company, it&#39;s really hard to choose between JUnit+develop and<br/>\n&gt; develop+functional testing.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There are many small teams (6-8 people) doing /all three/ effectively, <br/>\nso perhaps there are some other interesting problems to try to solve there.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Is there anyone who is successful in deploying JUnit during develop as:<br/>\n&gt; JUnit + code + JUnit + code + System Testing?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;d like to hear stories from other JUnit users, of course.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ.
