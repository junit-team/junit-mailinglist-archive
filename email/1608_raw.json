JUnit as a political gesture celebrates the ability of programmers\n&gt; to test their own software. The code and tests must be held to a\n&gt; higher standard, to demonstrate the techniques necessary to uphold\n&gt; our end of the bargain.\n\nI&#39;d like to add two aspects:\n- JUnit should be the stable angle for the very unstable projects we all\nhave to do. Changing too much jeopardizes stableness.\n- When adding too much non-core functionality one quickly looses focus of\nthe core parts. Very often the extra functionality is not exactly what I\nneed in a specific situation, so I have to reimplement it anyway. If the\nunneeded and unwanted part of a tool is prevailing many will move towards\nstarting from scratch with a new (small) framework. That&#39;s why I&#39;d rather\nhave JUnit as a core with hooks to plug in additional behaviour which is\navailable in additional tools.\n\nBTW, is the move to version 4 as described in\nhttp://c2.com/cgi/wiki?JunitNextRelease\nan &quot;official&quot; thing, i.e. promoted by Kent and Erich?\n\nJohannes\n\n\n\n\n",
