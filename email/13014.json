I see the advantage of being able to reuse <br/>\nthe existing unit-tests for performance testing without having to <br/>\nwrite the testcases again (maybe even in a different (scripting)<br/>\nlanguage). But I&#39;m sure one has to bear in mind that the unit tests <br/>\nare to be used for performance testing as well, especially regarding <br/>\ngranularity and test-data. I also fear that JUnit tests ususally tend <br/>\nto not represent user-behavior, which is supposed to be simulated <br/>\nduring load-tests. But I&#39;m pretty sure than can be achieved with <br/>\nappropriate scheduling. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo do you have any experience about how JUnit + JUnitPerf/+The <br/>\nGrinder/... competes against &quot;pure&quot; load-test tools like Mercury&#39;s <br/>\nLoadRunner, Rational Robot, OpenSTA, The Grinder(without JUnit) etc.?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe reason why I&#39;m asking is because our developers start to use <br/>\nJUnit (I made them buy your book J.B. ;-) from now on (some already <br/>\nhave used it) and I&#39;m dealing with developing performance/loadtesting <br/>\nprocesses. Most of our applications run as EJBs on Bea WLS 8.1 with <br/>\noracle DBs. <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance,<br/>\nThomas</div>",
