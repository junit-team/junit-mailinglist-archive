B. Rainsberger&#39;s suggestion of adding a test\n&gt;&gt;&gt; name to each set of parameters?  Would that address these concerns?\n&gt;&gt; It helps in part. However it relies too much on programmer design for my\n&gt;&gt; comfort. This could become very obscure and opaque very quickly.\n&gt; \n&gt; Can you expand on &quot;relies too much on programmer design&quot;?  I think I \n&gt; might know what you mean, but best to make sure.\n\n\nPart of the issue is that when writing individual tests the method name, \nwhich is required, documents the test. Yes you can write test1, test2, \ntest3, etc. but most programmers don&#39;t and when they do they feel itchy \nabout it and eventually go back to fix it. It&#39;s an obvious smell.\n\nThe proposed parameterized test syntax is more like an assert method \nthat may or may not have a message. Asserts without messages don&#39;t smell \nas bad, and aren&#39;t as likely to get fixed. Probably they don&#39;t need to \nbe when the test method name documents the problem, as do the expected \nand actual values. However with the parameterized test annotations we \nlose the method name but don&#39;t necessarily get anything to \ncounterbalance it.\n\n\n-- \n﻿Elliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nXML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim\n\n",
