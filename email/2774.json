We<br/>\nhave done what you suggest and pulled most of the guts out so that we can<br/>\nexercise them in junit.  However, we have found that typically a large<br/>\nnumber of bugs involve IE, Netscape, signing issues, or applet parameter<br/>\nissues.  So your comment about automating the applet testing is extremely<br/>\ninteresting to me.  Can you elaborate?  Your comment about extending<br/>\nTestRunner to test applets is likewise very interesting.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Eric Vought [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:evought@...\">evought@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, September 27, 2001 7:38 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [junit] Testing Applets<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On Wed, 26 Sep 2001, Jamie Nettles wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I want to test an applet or pieces of an applet using jUnit.  Any<br/>\n&gt; &gt; suggestions?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Well, the first thing to suggest is that its no different <br/>\n&gt; from testing any<br/>\n&gt; other application (as Bob Koss points out). To expand on <br/>\n&gt; that, the thing<br/>\n&gt; which makes an application is just its main method. Everything else is<br/>\n&gt; just a collection of objects and classes which can be unit tested.<br/>\n&gt; Similarly, what makes an applet an applet is just the fact <br/>\n&gt; that you have<br/>\n&gt; an Applet implementation which ties all the rest of your <br/>\n&gt; classes together<br/>\n&gt; into a working whole. The rest is just objects and classes <br/>\n&gt; which you can<br/>\n&gt; easily test.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It is relatively straight forward to write an applet in such <br/>\n&gt; a way that<br/>\n&gt; you can actually run it either as an applet or standalone. <br/>\n&gt; You do that by<br/>\n&gt; separating all of the function of the applet into other <br/>\n&gt; classes which are<br/>\n&gt; simply delegated to by a very thin Applet implementation. <br/>\n&gt; Even your main<br/>\n&gt; Panel can be separated out easily. You can then instantiate that Panel<br/>\n&gt; either inside the Applet or inside a Frame created from your <br/>\n&gt; application.<br/>\n&gt; If your applet runs in its own Frame, this is even easier. <br/>\n&gt; This type of<br/>\n&gt; modularization will also make the code much easier to unit test.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You don&#39;t, therefore, need to run your unit tests in a web <br/>\n&gt; browser. They<br/>\n&gt; are run standalone from one of the junit testrunners, just like with<br/>\n&gt; everything else. You can change security settings around testcases to<br/>\n&gt; simulate the default restrictions of a browser. It *is* possible to<br/>\n&gt; automate testing of applets running in browsers for purposes of<br/>\n&gt; portability testing, for instance, but this is non-trivial <br/>\n&gt; and should be<br/>\n&gt; avoided unless/until really necessary. (It&#39;s really <br/>\n&gt; functional testing,<br/>\n&gt; not unit testing)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Aside: Has anyone thought about creating an Applet based <br/>\n&gt; TestRunner? This<br/>\n&gt; would make it significantly easier for folks (like us) that <br/>\n&gt; do portability<br/>\n&gt; testing across a gagillion VMs. When I did some of this sort <br/>\n&gt; of work for<br/>\n&gt; IBM (Orion/On Demand Server), we had to write the browser based test<br/>\n&gt; automation pretty much from scratch and it was not fun to get <br/>\n&gt; it to run in<br/>\n&gt; the various browser targets. Changes in the security API and better<br/>\n&gt; conformance since then plus the very modular nature of junit <br/>\n&gt; should make<br/>\n&gt; it *almost* trivial now.
