A JUnit design rule is that all the tests have to be named\nbefore any of them is run, and naming should not be an expensive\nactivity.\n\nIt sounds like your best bet might be somesort of\n@RunWith(LightWeightParameters), which would look for a getTestName()\nmethod on the test object in order to create a test name.  If so,\nplease open a feature request, and I can look into it.  Thanks,\n\n   David Saff\n\nOn 1/26/07, gabrielcooper &lt;gabriel.cooper@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; When using the Parameterized RunWith annotation for your unit tests,\n&gt; the only way to identify a particular parameter is by the index by\n&gt; which it appeared in your 2d object array. So your results look like this:\n&gt;\n&gt; myTest[0] (Passed)\n&gt; myTest[1] (Passed)\n&gt; ...\n&gt; myTest[k] (Failed)\n&gt; ...\n&gt; myTest[n] (Passed)\n&gt;\n&gt; Aw, shucks. test #k failed. So you go to your java file, count down,\n&gt; one, two... all the way to the k&#39;th element. Ah. This must be the one\n&gt; that failed.\n&gt;\n&gt; Really, it&#39;s fairly annoying.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ve taken to making the first parameter of each element a text label\n&gt; for the test. It doesn&#39;t help much, because you still only see\n&gt; myTest[k] (Failed) but when you click on it (in Eclipse), I&#39;ve used\n&gt; the text label portion of the asserts to tell me what I was looking at.\n&gt;\n&gt; Uh. To be clearer...\n&gt;\n&gt; @RunWith(Parameterized.class)\n&gt; public class TestStuff {\n&gt; @Parameters\n&gt; public static Collection data() {\n&gt;     return Arrays.asList( new Object[][] {\n&gt;         { &quot;TestTwoPlusTwo&quot;, 2, 2, 4 },\n&gt;         { &quot;TestTwoPlusThree&quot;, 2, 3, 5 },\n&gt;         ...\n&gt;     });\n&gt; }\n&gt;\n&gt; public TestStuff(String friendlyName, p1, p2, p3) {\n&gt;     this.friendlyName = friendlyName;\n&gt;     this.param1 = p1;\n&gt;     this.param2 = p2;\n&gt;     this.param3 = p3;\n&gt; }\n&gt;\n&gt; @Test\n&gt; public void myTest() {\n&gt; assertTrue(testName + &quot; failed&quot;, param1 + param2 == param3);\n&gt; }\n&gt; }\n&gt;\n&gt; But like I said, it only means your error log/failure trace is a\n&gt; little more descriptive. Has anyone else done anything similar, and\n&gt; perhaps done it better?\n&gt;\n&gt; Gabriel.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo! Groups Links\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n",
