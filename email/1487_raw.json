Dave is right, JFCUnit is not \n100% the same as having a person use the keyboard and mouse.  \nInstead, JFCUnit tries to get reasonably close and make the test code \neasy to develop and maintain.  Hopefully this will make it easier for \nteams to write GUI tests and therefore test more than they could in \nthe past.\n\nMaybe JFCUnit could have an option to use Robot for creating the \nevents.  Why don&#39;t you add it as a feature request?\n\n- Greg\n\n\n\n--- In junit@y..., Robert Sartin &lt;sartin@a...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; --- David Herron &lt;davidh@7...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; I just downloaded and looked at their code.  They have a fatal, \nfrom\n&gt; &gt; my perspective, flaw.  Namely, to generate events against the \n&gt; &gt; components they create a Java level event and post it to the \nevent \n&gt; &gt; queue like so:\n&gt; \n&gt; I think the lesson here is that testing a GUI framework has \ncompletely\n&gt; different needs from testing a GUI application. Having tried to use\n&gt; java.awt.Robot to test an application, I prefer the style of \njfcunit.\n&gt; \n&gt; One man&#39;s fatal flaw is another man&#39;s feature.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Rob\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; Get personalized email addresses from Yahoo!
