Everyone I&#39;ve shown it to has wanted their own copy&quot;\n\nThe book has several chapters on JUnit not to mention JUnit, HTTPUnit,\nCactus, Ant and more.\n\nFor the complete review from Frank Carver go to:\nhttp://www.javaranch.com/cgi-bin/ubb/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic&f=49&t=000\n191\n\n\nIf you have any comments on the book, there is a forum on JavaRanch at:\nhttp://www.javaranch.com/cgi-bin/ubb/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic&f=49&t=000\n191\n\nPlease share you experiences with the book or share you experiences with\nusing the tools (JUnit, Ant, et al) to do automated testing and continuous\nintegration.\n\nA small comment about the review...\n\nI agree with Frank that the book is for more than just developers that are\ndoing XP (XPers). I state this several times in the book. However, I�d like\nto add...\n\nIf you are following the XP development process and you are doing J2EE\ndevelopment, then you especially need the tools described in this book. This\nis because XP relies heavily on automated testing, and continuous\nintegration. JUnit, which is heavily covered in this book, was designed and\nco-created by the father of the XP process--Kent Beck.\n\nHere is what one J2EE XP developer wrote about the book...\n\n&quot;I have been struggling with turning XP methodology into a solid development\nprocess. We&#39;ve had some success at my company but most times we&#39;ve met\nfrustrations primarily because we were trying to teach old tools new\ntricks.&quot;\n\n&quot;Java Tools for XP has made a big difference for us. My team has been able\nto use the tools described in this book to actually DO unit testing, and\nwe&#39;ve already automated a significant portion of our testing and deployment\nprocesses. Its also let us make a good case for open source tools at my\ncompany.&quot;\n\n&quot;Overall I definitely recommend this book as the first book to make XP\nreal.&quot;\n\nI receive a lot of email that states similar things. If you are doing XP and\nJava (especially J2EE), then the tools described in this book are essential.\n\nThanks again.\n\nRick Hightower\nDirector of Development\neBlox, Inc.\n\neBlox Tucson\n\n*******************************************\n* Check out my new book!:                 *\n* Java Tools for Extreme Programming:     *\n* Mastering Open Source Tools,            *\n* including Ant, JUnit, and Cactus        *\n*******************************************\n\nhttp://www.rickhightower.com/JavaXPToolkit/\n\nBuy it at Amazon:\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/047120708X/rickhightower-20\n\nThe book was written by members of the eBlox team!\n\n\n\n\n\n",
