If<br/>\n&gt;&gt; you think that is false, then please show us a test consistent with<br/>\n&gt;&gt; the contract of Object#equals that this implementation does not pass.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Okay, java.util HashSets and TreeSets.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;According to the contract for the Equals method on the Set Interface, a<br/>\n&gt;Set is equal to another set if they are the same size, and both contain<br/>\n&gt;the same objects.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Your implementation would return false in this case if one set were a<br/>\n&gt;TreeSet and the other were a HashSet, as the class objects aren&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;equal.  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;We could say that, in Bloch&#39;s original example with points, the real<br/>\n&gt;problem is that the ColoredPoint is changing the contract of the equals<br/>\n&gt;method.  And, in fact, this is probably what he means by the &quot;add an<br/>\n&gt;aspect&quot; portion of his statement &quot;There is simply no way to extend an<br/>\n&gt;instantiable class and add an aspect while preserving the equals<br/>\n&gt;contract.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes. I think we&#39;re in total agreement here now. Thanks for working through it with me. I know that takes patience.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJ. B.
