It seems to me that in your case you have <br/>\naccess to the source else you would not be able to test those methods no <br/>\nmatter what ... if you just had access to the class files.<br/>\n<br/>\nGoing against my better judgement here&#39;s a nice sloppy solution (you <br/>\nhave been forewarned !!). Now assuming you have the source and you are <br/>\nabsolutely dead against modifying those private methods, but don&#39;t mind <br/>\nadding a few extra public methods. Then you could write a public <br/>\naccessor function (gasp) for each private method you needed to test, <br/>\nthat would return the array object after the private method did it&#39;s <br/>\nwork. That way you could compare the state of the array before and after <br/>\neach invocation and see if the desired state was achieved. You could put <br/>\nall these public accessor functions into an inner class, and then drop <br/>\nthe compiled inner class when you are ready to release your class.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo if your class is Something.java and you have an inner class Test. You <br/>\ncan delete the Something$Test.class &lt;ensure that no other function <br/>\nwithin class Something depends on the inner Test class&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease note if you can refactor your private methods, then do that  by <br/>\nall means<br/>\n<br/>\n-george<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nrajeshwari_83 wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; There is a class which has one public method returning an ArrayList.<br/>\n&gt; The public method of this class inturn calls several private methods<br/>\n&gt; which are void. These private methods only keep adding to the<br/>\n&gt; arraylist which is finally returned by the public method. I need to<br/>\n&gt; write a JUNIT for this class specifically the private methods of this<br/>\n&gt; class. Since these methods are void, how do I write JUNIT test cases<br/>\n&gt; for them???<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; *Yahoo!
