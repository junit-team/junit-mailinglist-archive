And that often by looking into the source code...<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only one who can see the code is the developer himself, so it&#39;s a task<br/>\nfor developers, they look beyond the boundaries of modules/components, so<br/>\nthat&#39;s why they call it white box instead of black box.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a developer you have to analyze your coding (statements, paths, ...)<br/>\nand build YOUR  &quot;white&quot; test cases adequately.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen of course you have your functional test cases, because you had a<br/>\ndescription of what<br/>\nyour component should do, and these are quite &quot;black&quot; test cases.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I&#39; m trying to say is: YOU&#39;re doing something of both, but it&#39;s called<br/>\nnevertheless<br/>\nwhite box testing (for the developer). And so does JUnit, a little bit of<br/>\nboth!<br/>\nBut I always would position JUnit as a white box tool. The unit is WHAT I&#39;m<br/>\ntesting,<br/>\nI do it primarily by my METHOD of looking inside the code.<br/>\nI do it in my development ENVIRONMENT, so it&#39;s a developer test.<br/>\nThat&#39;s white box testing!<br/>\n<br/>\nTom</div>",
