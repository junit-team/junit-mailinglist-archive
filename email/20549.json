Feel free to skip it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf, however, you find yourself a little mystified about your<br/>\ntest case&#39;s behaviour, you have the option of turning on<br/>\nthe log to get another view on what the test case is doing.<br/>\nAlternately you could run the test in a debugger. Or you could <br/>\nstart writing a bunch of hand-crafted logging statements since<br/>\nlogging is sometimes more effective than debugging. <br/>\nBut in some cases the assertion log would already be logging what <br/>\nyou need to know without your having to write those statements.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s just another tool that is sometimes useful. Debuggers<br/>\nare important, but you don&#39;t have to use them.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, Robert Wenner &lt;robert.wenner@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On Monday 09 June 2008 21:18, Cédric Beust  wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If I have to go through umpteen thousand lines of log, I may as well<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; test everything manually.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Nobody says you have to, but the fact that your tests pass doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; guarantee that you are testing what you think you are testing.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Well. If the log is important, I have to go through it, or I miss <br/>\n&gt; something important. If it is not important (and I don&#39;t have to go <br/>\n&gt; through it) I can skip it altogether.
