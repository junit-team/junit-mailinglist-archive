I&#39;m curious,\nhowever, as to how that advice squares with the notion of TDD.\n\nAmong other things, testing only the important bits means being\nable to skip tests for setters and for getters. It also means not having\n\nto write a test for the main loop that merely says &quot;process every item\nin the input collection&quot;, and get down to the nitty gritty of ensuring\nthat\nthe processing steps actually work.\n\nIn TDD, on the other hand, I understand that one is not supposed to\nwrite a scrap of code until one has first written the failing test for\nit.\nThis philosophy has two intriguing features:\n   * 100% code coverage\n       Because nothing gets written that doesn&#39;t have a test in the\nfirst place.\n\n   * Un-prejudiced design\n      So you wind up creating the abstractions you really need, instead\n      of the ones you first conceive of. The example of the multi-room\n      game was illuminating in that respect. Instead of having a Room\n      class, as one might expect, simple integers were all that was\n      actually needed to represent a room. (Where did I read that?)\n\nBut writing tests first seems fundamentally incompatible with the notion\n\nof testing only what you need to test. Or am I being anal about the\nTDD idea, and in fact, &quot;simple&quot; code is written without first writing\ntests?\n(Or is there some other unifying idea I&#39;m missing.)\n\nAs an aside, I&#39;m curious to know if in TDD it is &quot;kosher&quot; to write\na failing test, examine the results and, if they look good, plug them\ninto the test. My thoughts so far are:\n   1) It feels like cheating, because the test will then succeed even\n        if my examination failed.\n\n   2) I&#39;m especially inclined to do it when the results are big, because\n\n       it&#39;s so hard to manually generate the results I expect. But that\n       means:\n          a) It&#39;s even more likely that the visual examination will\noverlook\n              something.\n          b) Taking advantage of the ability to cut and paste results\nmay\n              incline me to make larger tests than I really should be\nmaking.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
