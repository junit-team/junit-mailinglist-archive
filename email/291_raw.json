But it still seems a lot\neasier to use a static (or singleton) for the objects you want to be shared\nlike that, and still have instance variables which are not shared (versus\ninstance variables for shared, ThreadLocal variables for not shared).\n\nAnyway, it seems a little less mysterious now, anyway.  But I think I may\ntry to come up with a replacement for ActiveTestSuite that has this\ndescribed behavior instead.\n\nKevin\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Kevin Mukhar\nTo: junit@egroups.com\nSent: 1/22/01 5:34 AM\nSubject: Re: [junit] ActiveTestSuite confusion\n\nKevin Bourrillion wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; And this does basically that.  But the problem is, all the threads are\n&gt; acting on the same actual TestCase instances.  Meaning that my test\ncase\n&gt; &quot;firmament&quot; becomes pretty much useless--an object I initialize in\nsetUp()\n&gt; might have been mucked with by another thread by the time I use it!\n\nIn my opinion, that might be the point. If all you want is one thread\nper\nobject, then that doesn&#39;t test the thread safety of the object. To test\nwhether\nan object is thread safe, you need to have multiple threads accessing\nthe same\nobject at the same time. \n\nKevin Mukhar\n\n\neGroups Sponsor\t \n \n&lt;http://rd.yahoo.com/M=168002.1291681.2888959.2/D=egroupmail/S=170000718\n1:N/A=564919/*http://www.columbiahouse.com/gateway?token=7406&gt; Get 3 CDs\nfor ONLY $9.99!\nGet 3 CDs for ONLY $9.99!\t \n \n&lt;http://us.adserver.yahoo.com/l?M=168002.1291681.2888959.2/D=egroupmail/\nS=1700007181:N/A=564919/rand=117614143&gt; \t\n\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\njunit-unsubscribe@egroups.com\n\n\n\n\n",
