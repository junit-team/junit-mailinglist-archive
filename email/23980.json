You should turn to your test-running tool on this one, i.e. Surefire.<br/>\n<br/>\nSurefire is your tool to organize which tests to run when and how. JUnit is glue between Surefire and the JUnit test-classes.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout your problem I think you have put yourself in a corner by trying to run all tests in parallel in the same JVM. Even if you could use &quot;global, one-time, setup / tear-down&quot; you still put very strict limits on what your test-classes can safely do and I simply don&#39;t think it is worth it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI strongly advice you to rethink here and configure Surefire with forkMode=&quot;perthread&quot;, so that parallel test-executions take place in separate JVM-processes.<br/>\n<br/>\ncheers /Henrik<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, Brett Delle Grazie &lt;bdellegrazie@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m using JUnit 4.10 with Maven 3.0.4, Surefire 2.12.3, JDK 1.6.0_35<br/>\n&gt; on Windows 7<br/>\n&gt; Surefire is configured with parallel=methods and threadCount=10<br/>\n&gt; For logging, I&#39;m using SLF4J to Logback, initialised by default method<br/>\n&gt; (i.e. configuration file logback-test.xml is on the test classpath)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have an order of initialisation problem in that:<br/>\n&gt; (1) Some unit tests test classes that use commons-logging (and logback<br/>\n&gt; via jcl-slf4j) but are ending up with<br/>\n&gt; Null loggers.<br/>\n&gt; (2) jcl-slf4j is not initialised _until_ those classes are called.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If I disable parallelism the code works correctly, implying an order<br/>\n&gt; of initialisation issue.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; According to the most recent FAQ on Junit.org (Section 5, #3) I could<br/>\n&gt; use @BeforeClass and @AfterClass at the class<br/>\n&gt; level but I&#39;m talking about at the global level, something that needs<br/>\n&gt; to be executed even if only a single test is run.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What is the correct method to add global, one-time, setup / tear-down<br/>\n&gt; hooks? In this case they would need to execute and<br/>\n&gt; complete (i.e. blocking) before any parallel tests are run.<br/>\n&gt; Is it simplest to override the Runner and initialise the logging in code there?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Best Regards,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Brett<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
