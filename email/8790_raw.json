Then you can pass in a mock to be built.. with \n&gt; &gt;expectations as to *how* it will be built.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hello! Ding ding ding.... that&#39;s nice.\n\nGlad you like it.\n\n&gt; 1. Put the sets on an interface.\n\nExactly.\n\n&gt; 2. Expose get/set on Test Implementation and submit it to the \n&gt; builder. This tests that the builder calls the interface&#39;s sets \n&gt; correctly.\n&gt; \n&gt; 3. Don&#39;t expose get on Production Implementation because the outside\n&gt;  world doesn&#39;t need them.\n\nActually you don&#39;t need getters at all.  Mock the interface, and set\nexpectations on the set calls.  Then pass that into the\nbuilder/parser.  You don&#39;t need to capture the args other than to\ncompare them with what was expected.\n\nDave\n\n\n\n",
