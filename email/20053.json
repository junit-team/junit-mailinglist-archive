The<br/>\n&gt; response to Crap4J was so positive that we decided to go further and<br/>\n&gt; created a dedicated website crap4j.org &lt;http://www.crap4j. &lt;http://www.crap4j.org&gt; org&gt; .<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We&#39;ve had hundreds of downloads since we launched the site, along with<br/>\n&gt; many requests for Ant support and support for IDEs other than Eclipse.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We just added Ant support in 1.1.4, and we are planning to support other<br/>\n&gt; IDEs like NetBeans and IntelliJ (BTW, if you are interested in<br/>\n&gt; contribute to plug-in development please let us know).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If you have a chance, please try Crap4J on your project and let us know<br/>\n&gt; what you think. We are interested in getting this group&#39;s feedback on<br/>\n&gt; Crap4j and suggestions for improving and extending it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The home page is: www.crap4j.org &lt;http://www.crap4j. &lt;http://www.crap4j.org&gt; org&gt; ; from<br/>\n&gt; there<br/>\n&gt; you can navigate to the download page.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If you have any problems installing it or running it, feel free to ask<br/>\n&gt; for help on the forum or file a bug report or feature request.<br/>\n&gt; &lt;http://trac. &lt;http://trac.crap4j.org/&gt; crap4j.org/&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Alberto<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
