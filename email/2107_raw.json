Given that I \n    &gt; expected them to contain\n    &gt; &gt;the same number of elements, the most valuable \n    &gt; information to me would be\n    &gt; &gt;that they were of different lengths, not which elements \n    &gt; were/were not\n    &gt; &gt;present.\n    &gt; &gt;\n    &gt; I partially don&#39;t agree.  I think that comparing vectors \n    &gt; should tell you \n    &gt; if the elements are equals.  If your testing a sort \n    &gt; algorythm, you want \n    &gt; to know if elements of the result vector are in the right \n    &gt; position. \n    &gt;  This request (assertEquals do array properly) has been \n    &gt; expressed by \n    &gt; many people and I think that it should be included in JUnit.\n    &gt; \n    &gt; But I&#39;m against the &quot;soft warning&quot; idea.  Don&#39;t see the \n    &gt; added value there.\n    &gt; \n    &gt; -Vladimir\n    &gt; \n    &gt; \n    &gt; \n    &gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
