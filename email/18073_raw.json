If someone tells me that they \n&gt; specifically don&#39;t want source control, I extend my hand, shake theirs, \n&gt; then bid them good day. You must be at least this responsible to talk to\nme.\n\nLuckily I didn&#39;t have to fight *that* fight. By the time I arrived\nSourceSafe (better than nothing) and Ant were both in use, if only just.\nThey&#39;d also had at least one major screwup deploying the wrong (mixed)\nversion to prod to cause the lead to be overiden.\n\n&gt; I&#39;m glad you&#39;re coping, though. I love deleting code. Continued good luck.\n\nIt&#39;s a great feeling isn&#39;t it :-) Still a lot to go though, the basic code\nis much better but there are still amazingly dodgy design decisions\neverywhere.\n\n&gt; -- \n&gt; J.
