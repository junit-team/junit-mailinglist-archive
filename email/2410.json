That&#39;s because interface is just a collection of methods, so they are relatively easier.  It turned out that the code<br/>\nfor writing mock objects FOR INTERFACE can be refactored so came the EasyMock(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tammofreese.de/easymock/index.html)\">http://tammofreese.de/easymock/index.html)</a> and<br/>\nMockMaker (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.xpdeveloper.com/cgi-bin/wiki.cgi?MockMaker)\">http://www.xpdeveloper.com/cgi-bin/wiki.cgi?MockMaker)</a>.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for mock objects for classes, things are a lot harder.  For example, the first thing I have encountered is how to call the super<br/>\nconstructor from the mock objects and pass the valid parameters.  And the static methods, singletons just make things almost<br/>\nimpossible.  After several struggles, I now understand anti-pattern a lot better. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are two sites I have found so far:<br/>\nMockObjects (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mockobjects.sourceforge.net/index.html)\">http://mockobjects.sourceforge.net/index.html)</a> and<br/>\nExtendObjects (The link is on MockMaker page but somehow the XDeveloper is download since last Saturday).  I haven&#39;t had chance to<br/>\ngo through the latter and the MockObjects is creating a library of mock objects, which is the best solution I have seen so far.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have grown great interest in mock objects and I would like to share the experience with fellow developers, as long as this is not<br/>\noff the topic.<br/>\n<br/>\nShane<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFranksun wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; I only can mock objcect from interface ?<br/>\n&gt; If some complex objcect no interface and I want to mock it .<br/>\n&gt; How I get it ?<br/>\n&gt; thanks!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
