The corresponding method is empty and there&#39;s a comment: // do nothing: same as passing (for 4.5; may change in 4.6)<br/>\n&gt;&gt; I would like to increase the ignored tests count for an assumption failure. It&#39;s because Result doesn&#39;t provide any information, that a test is ignored because of a failing assumption.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Any objections?<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Yahoo!
