Maybe you are interested in\n&gt; what he has to say in favor of Contract-Driven Development.\n\nHe appears to have nothing to say on that; he mentions &quot;Contract-Driven\nDevelopment&quot; not once in the entire interview.\n\nContract Driven DESIGN is an excellent idea when you&#39;re designing stuff\nfar in advance, and you need to constrain how people use things years\ndown the road. Having the compiler enforce what would otherwise be\ndocumentation (e.g., &quot;this method must never return an integer smaller\nthan zero&quot;) is great.\n\nBut doing this level of design is probably a waste of time for classes\nused within a single project when you&#39;re doing XP; just write the thing\nand make it good enough, and get it out of the way; if something changes\nlater you can just go back and change the class as you wish. There&#39;s no\nneed to do a lot of design for future issues.\n\nI don&#39;t see how DBC is going to drive your coding style the way that\nTDD does, since DBC is not even about coding; it&#39;s about design before\ncoding.\n\ncjs\n-- \nCurt Sampson  &lt;cjs@...&gt;   +81 90 7737 2974   http://www.NetBSD.org\n    Don&#39;t you know, in this new Dark Age, we&#39;re all light.  --XTC\n\n",
