Expected to find it in C:&#92;Program <br/>\nFiles&#92;Java&#92;jre1.5.0_06&#92;lib&#92;tools.jar<br/>\n<br/>\nI have JDK1.4 installed on my c: drive. I have JAVA_HOME pointing to <br/>\nit and I tried putting the tools.jar on my classpath environment <br/>\nvariable. I don&#39;t know why it is looking down in C:&#92;Program Files&#92;Java <br/>\nor if it just went searching on its own why it didn&#39;t pick up either <br/>\nthe 1.4 or 1.5 JDK directories that are in that directory.<br/>\n<br/>\nHas anyone had a problem with this or have any ideas what I should try <br/>\nnext? I already checked the bug reports on the Apache web site and <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t anything like this.</div>",
