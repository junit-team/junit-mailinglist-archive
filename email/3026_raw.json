You actually asked a specific\nquestion, which is all I&#39;ve been asking for on this list. You showed\nevidence of having thought about things. There would be no reason to &quot;flame&quot;\nyou for that.\n\nIf you had just removed &quot;And before you flame me...&quot; from your message, I\nwouldn&#39;t think you were acting like a wiseass. I&#39;m sure nobody would.\n\nGive respect; get respect. Give none; get none.\n\nJBR.\n\n----- Begin original message -----\nWhy does the junit.samples.SimpleTest appear in my list of tests to run,\neven though I&#39;ve deleted the class files from my classpath?  When I\nclick the &quot;...&quot; button, it does not show up, but it does in the drop\ndown list.\n\nAny ideas?\n\n(And before you flame me, I did search the archives and faq, and have\ndome some problem solving on my own!)\n\n-dave-\n\n\n",
