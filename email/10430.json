But the thing is this is application that I <br/>\n&gt; am trying to test and they need something automated to run it. These <br/>\n&gt; microsoft documents can change with date and can remain same for <br/>\n&gt; months. Everytime this document changes, there is a mail in my <br/>\n&gt; mailbox having the document. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It sounds to me like you&#39;re trying to test the whole application at<br/>\nonce.  Focus on each individual part and it&#39;ll be easier to test.  Your<br/>\napplication basically has two parts, one to detect documents<br/>\n(DocumentFinder) that need to be sent, and another to send the documents<br/>\n(DocumentSender).  You probably shouldn&#39;t worry about verifying that the<br/>\ndocument ended up in your inbox because then you&#39;re testing the<br/>\ninternet, email protocols, and your email client which you really have<br/>\nno control of.  Just verify that the document was sent and that would be<br/>\ngood enough.  You want to make your tests not rely on anything because<br/>\nthat makes them less reliable, for example, if you verify that your<br/>\ndocument is in your inbox you need a working SMTP/POP3 server.  If the<br/>\nserver goes down, then your test will fail.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf DocumentFinder returns a list of documents to be sent you could set<br/>\nup your test something like this:<br/>\n<br/>\nThese examples should be regarded as pseudocode and not real java code.<br/>\n<br/>\ntestDocumentChanged()<br/>\n{<br/>\n\tDocumentFinder finder = new DocumentFinder();<br/>\n<br/>\n\t//some code to change the date of one document.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tfinder.find();<br/>\n<br/>\n\tassertEquals(1, finder.numDocuments());<br/>\n\tassertEquals(&quot;C:&#92;&#92;mydocument.txt&quot;, finder.documentAt(0));<br/>\n}<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you use readers and writers for your DocumentSender, then you can<br/>\nverify that the correct data is being written without actually writing<br/>\nto a socket.  Your test might look something like this.<br/>\n<br/>\ntestSendDocument()<br/>\n{<br/>\n\tString expectedData = ...;<br/>\n<br/>\n\tStringWriter writer = new StringWriter();<br/>\n\tDocumentSender sender(&quot;C:&#92;&#92;mydocument.txt&quot;, writer);<br/>\n\tsender.send();<br/>\n<br/>\n\tassertEquals(expectedData, writer.toString());<br/>\n}<br/>\n<br/>\nKris</div>",
