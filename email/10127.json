Threading is a big issue (there are several in the system), <br/>\nbut I don&#39;t think  they&#39;re any running that should affect this test.  Still, <br/>\nI&#39;ll look closer at it when I return to work after the holidays.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Thursday 18 December 2003 22:47, Chad Woolley wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Just had another idea on this one.  Sometimes, this situation can be<br/>\n&gt; time-dependent.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; For example, if your test machine is on local time, and your database<br/>\n&gt; server is on GMT, and you try to compare dates, you can get an<br/>\n&gt; intermittent failure.  This is because there is a window each day where<br/>\n&gt; the dates are different.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Or, it could be thread-related.  Some rare condition that depends on the<br/>\n&gt; underlying OS threading model, that only occurred in certain conditions.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Just some ideas.  If you do ever figure it out, please post to the list.<br/>\n&gt;   I&#39;d be interested to know what it was.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -- Chad<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; David Corbin wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;I&#39;ve got one tests which fails sporadically, and I cannot figure out any<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;reason for it to be non-deterministic in MY code.
