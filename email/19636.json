(which is on topic.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe usual suggestions for rewriting the code are offered, such as using <br/>\na factory class to allocate/create objects, and always always just <br/>\nreturning the one and only.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo far, so good. But, the Factory class has to keep a store of <br/>\nanti-singletons. And the usual call is something like<br/>\n    AntiSingleton anAnti = Factory.createAntiSingleton();<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich is used statically, and implies that the Factory is a singleton so <br/>\nits cache of AntiSingletons can be kept in one and only one store.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not seeing how changing the Singleton class to a class that needs <br/>\nthe singleton Factory class has done anything. We&#39;ve still got a <br/>\nsingleton, and so all arguments that there is implied coupling, and bad <br/>\nkarma for testing still hold.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\nPat<br/>\n<br/>\np.s. any hints of forums/lists where this topic could be explored would <br/>\nbe greatly appreciated. I&#39;ve found lots of places where rookies can ask <br/>\nhow to use a HashMap, and lots where folks argue about JSRs, but I&#39;m <br/>\nreally looking for somewhere where professional, experienced Java <br/>\ndevelopers can get answers to hard questions.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nPat Farrell\t\t\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pfarrell@...\">pfarrell@...</a><br/>\nwww.bioinformatx.com</div>",
