But I have a question which I hope some of you\ncan help me with - it&#39;s regarding testing private/protected methods and how\nto organize my test package.\n\nFirst the package. I have read to articles regarding test (&quot;Junit best\npractices&quot; from JavaWorld and &quot;Incremental development with Ant and JUnit&quot;\nfrom developerWorks). In the JBT article Andy Schneider advice you to keep\ntests in the same location as the source code. And in the Incremental...\narticle Malcolm Davis advice you to make a separate package. Which approach\nis the best to use?\n\nI must admit that I like the idea of making a separate package but then\nagain - how do I then test private and protected methods? And if I keep the\ntests in the same location as the source code - who do I then test private\nmethods?\n\nI would very much appreciate if some of you could give me a little example\n\nKind regards,\n\nJ. Andersen\n\n\n\n",
