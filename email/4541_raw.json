Ideally, my design\nwould be such that private methods wouldn&#39;t do the real work (maybe they\nneed to be filtered out into another class), but i don&#39;t want to start\nanother\ndebate.\nWhy not just have an option to allow testing private methods, and those like\nme who use the excuse &quot;in the interests of time&quot; for our bad design could put\n\nfunctionality into private methods that needs to be tested...\n\nJohn Goodsen wrote:\n\n&gt; &gt; On Fri, Mar 29, 2002 at 01:37:41PM -0600, David Stagner wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If you want to test private methods directly, you must run your\n&gt; &gt; &gt; tests as inner classes.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Not entirely true.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Since JDK1.2, reflection can be used to circumvent the\n&gt; &gt; protected/private/package private access control mechanism; provided\n&gt; &gt; that the client wishing to do so has a\n&gt; &gt; ReflectPermission(&quot;suppressAccessChecks&quot;) permission.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; See java.lang.class.getDeclaredMethods(),\n&gt; &gt;     java.lang.reflect.Method and\n&gt; &gt;     java.lang.reflect.AccessibleObject.\n&gt;\n&gt; I used to test private methods.  Now I ask myself, why I am\n&gt; trying to get into the guts of the implementation and not\n&gt; just testing from the public interface.  Using Design\n&gt; By Contract to spec out the public interface and guide\n&gt; what tests need to be written helps me do just that.\n&gt; Whenever I find myself wanting to access private parts\n&gt; in a test case, I step back and rethink why I want to\n&gt; do it... Usually it is because I am not writing my\n&gt; test first, I am writing after the fact, with knowledge\n&gt; of the implementation ...  I slap myself and get back\n&gt; into writing the tests first and all is better.\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt; John Goodsen           RADSoft / Rapid Software Delivery Specialists\n&gt; jgoodsen@...             eXtreme Java Internet Consultants\n&gt; http://www.radsoft.com           Toll Free: 866-RADSOFT (723-7638)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
