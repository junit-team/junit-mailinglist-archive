I&#39;m willing to accept that it is a problem <br/>\n&gt; with me<br/>\n&gt; rather than JUnit.  Is there something about my outlook on testing that <br/>\n&gt; I need<br/>\n&gt; to refine?  I am surprised that data driven testing like this is not <br/>\n&gt; supported,<br/>\n&gt; as it seems like soemthign that would be used a lot.  What is the reasoning<br/>\n&gt; behind JUnit not beign designed for this, and is there soemthign that I <br/>\n&gt; can do<br/>\n&gt; to acheive what I want while still keeping with JUnit&#39;s design goals.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You&#39;re welcome to feel that way; I won&#39;t press the issue anymore. It&#39;s <br/>\nentirely possible that all the very smart people who&#39;ve been working <br/>\nwith JUnit since 1999 have missed what you&#39;ll eventually figure out. I <br/>\nhave to allow for that possibility. Still, if I were you, I think I <br/>\nmight take some stock in what someone with experience has to say.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, highly data-driven testing /is/ supported by JUnit, as long <br/>\nas you don&#39;t care about how it reports tests in test runs. You could <br/>\nsimply write this test:<br/>\n<br/>\ntestAlgorithm<br/>\n     data = some array<br/>\n     foreach (item in data)<br/>\n         doTest(item)<br/>\n<br/>\nThis works just fine, except:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. If the algorithm fails for the 5th row of data, you&#39;ll never know <br/>\nwhat happens with the 6th row, because the test will fail<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Although you&#39;re really running n tests, JUnit will report it as only 1.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you don&#39;t care about these so-called limitations, then you&#39;re done.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow you /can/ run all your test*() methods for each row in a List of <br/>\nfixture objects, but I don&#39;t want to get into the details of how until I <br/>\nhave time to sit down and write an article about it. Today&#39;s not the day.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, you were earlier talking about something like instantiating and <br/>\nrunning a test from some other test. JUnit /definitely/ don&#39;t work that <br/>\nway. Don&#39;t even bother. Tests do not run other tests; that&#39;s why we have <br/>\ntest runners.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  &gt; This is a different problem from the one you described before, so it&#39;s a<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; different one from what I tried to help you solve.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Yes, that is why I tried to describe it better.  I really appreciate <br/>\n&gt; your taking<br/>\n&gt; the time to understand what I am saying and help me.  I bought your book<br/>\n&gt; yesterday and I plan to read it over the holidays.<br/>\n&gt; Alright I will look into FitNesse like you suggested.  But I still feel like<br/>\n&gt; there is either an issue with JUnit or my understanding of it since I <br/>\n&gt; failed to<br/>\n&gt; make this work.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Understand that what I&#39;m about to say is a little harsh, but it&#39;s true. <br/>\nI hope we&#39;re all mature enough to take it in the spirit in which it&#39;s given:<br/>\n<br/>\n  * A sign of maturity in any profession is when we recognize the <br/>\nlimitations of tools and work around them, often by finding better <br/>\ntools. To try hopelessly to reshape every problem so that one tool <br/>\nsolves it is wishful thinking. It&#39;s a phase we all go through and have <br/>\nto get through.<br/>\n<br/>\nFour years ago, I was you, hoping that JUnit would do everything <br/>\nincluding massage my feet when I was tired.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope Fit/FitNesse helps you solve the problem in a nicer way. If not, <br/>\nthen just wait for my next recipe: &quot;Parameterized Test Suite&quot;. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
