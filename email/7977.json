If<br/>\n&gt; you think that is false, then please show us a test consistent with<br/>\n&gt; the contract of Object#equals that this implementation does not pass.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Okay, java.util HashSets and TreeSets.<br/>\n<br/>\nAccording to the contract for the Equals method on the Set Interface, a<br/>\nSet is equal to another set if they are the same size, and both contain<br/>\nthe same objects.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour implementation would return false in this case if one set were a<br/>\nTreeSet and the other were a HashSet, as the class objects aren&#39;t<br/>\nequal.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe could say that, in Bloch&#39;s original example with points, the real<br/>\nproblem is that the ColoredPoint is changing the contract of the equals<br/>\nmethod.  And, in fact, this is probably what he means by the &quot;add an<br/>\naspect&quot; portion of his statement &quot;There is simply no way to extend an<br/>\ninstantiable class and add an aspect while preserving the equals<br/>\ncontract.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n-Kevin<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nThe New Yahoo!
