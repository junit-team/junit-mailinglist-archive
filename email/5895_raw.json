I see JUnit is great for nesting sub-suites within a suite \nand \n&gt; thereby creating a tree of suites. But when it comes to test \nresults, \n&gt; is there a way to get a breakup of which sub-suite had how many \n&gt; failures from TestResult?\n\nMy philosophy has always been that all the tests should run. For a \nwhile I had percentages of tests running in my GUIs, but then it hit \nme. It&#39;s a *BINARY* computer. Pass means everything runs. Fail means \nsomething doesn&#39;t run. Sort of a weakest link thing.\n\nThis is also why successes aren&#39;t registered in TestResult. The sun \ncame up this morning. Gravity works. Ho hum. No need to write that \nin the diary.\n\nRe: internal sucking. The TestRunner hierarchy indeed bites. No \nexcuses. That&#39;s what 4.0 is for, when Erich and I get 3 days \ntogether. In the meantime, nothing is stopping anyone from creating \ntheir own (I&#39;ll be studying Michael&#39;s recent test case for ideas we \ncan steal.) As for testing EJBs, that was out of scope, so I&#39;m not \nsurprised it is more difficult than necessary. A test case like \nMichael&#39;s would constitute constructive criticism.\n\nRe: MIT course. I sent the instructor of the course a response, and \nnever heard anything back. Their complaints about JUnit, and their \nlinking of XP and JUnit, don&#39;t make sense to me. Of course \nframeworks should come with docs, since I can&#39;t sit their with \neveryone who has downloaded JUnit. And it does. Whether they are \ngood or not we can certainly debate, but they&#39;ve been good enough \nfor a bunch of folks. If someone wishes they had another doc as a \nbeginner, they are certainly welcome to write it and we&#39;ll put it in \nthe distribution.\n\nBesides, the picture on the home page of their software engineering \ncourse, software engineering being the quintessential team sport, \nshows a row of people staring singly at computer screens and not \ninteracting with each other in any way.\n\nKent\n\n\n",
