Anytime you break the test, by changing how the<br/>\n&gt; graphics are created, you are forced to reverify. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Thanks for the suggestion.  We were already thinking along these lines but <br/>\nit seemed a bit kludgy.  But now that we can call it &quot;regression testing&quot; we <br/>\nwill feel comfortable enough to use this approach! <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again,<br/>\nTodd Chaffee</div>",
