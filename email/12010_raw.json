That is, we have a client that\nshould only use the classes in one jar talking to a server that should\nonly use the classes in another jar. It is trivial to test the\ncommunications if I smush the classpaths together, but I want a\nsensible way to restrict each of the parts to its own classloader,\npreferably without preventing the suite from having both sets of\nclasses in its *default* classloader...\n\n",
