B. Rainsberger [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jbr@...\">jbr@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Just do assertEquals on expected and actual collections. The<br/>\n&gt; &gt; collections all have sensible equals methods<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; i.e. if the 2 collections are lists they will be equal if they<br/>\n&gt; &gt; contain the same elements in the same order. If the 2 collections<br/>\n&gt; &gt; are sets they will be equal if they contain the same elements.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The only problem with this otherwise great advice is that <br/>\n&gt; comparing two lists <br/>\n&gt; for the same elements, although not at the same indices, does <br/>\n&gt; not work.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This has been discussed, I think, to death somewhere on the <br/>\n&gt; web. Maybe you <br/>\n&gt; should look at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?JavaUnitBestPractices\">http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?JavaUnitBestPractices</a> <br/>\n&gt; and hunt around <br/>\n&gt; for something on comparing arrays or some such. There should <br/>\n&gt; be quite a <br/>\n&gt; complete discussion.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The basic idea is this: write your own custom assertion <br/>\n&gt; or &quot;collectionsEquals&quot;, but be careful how to handle the differences. <br/>\n&gt; Especially for big collections, you need an easy way to know what the <br/>\n&gt; differences are between the collections in the case where <br/>\n&gt; they are not equal.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If that resource does not help you, then let us know and <br/>\n&gt; we&#39;ll fill in the <br/>\n&gt; blanks. This sounds like another &quot;Tip and Trick&quot; for my site. :)<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
