It&#39;s just a shame that <br/>\nthe compiler, which used to help here (with TestSetup) doesn&#39;t with the <br/>\ncorresponding annotation.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I think you should just use @Before and not @BeforeClass. Don&#39;t do<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; class-level setup as a performance hack; it creates more problems than<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; it solves.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t believe it&#39;s a hack: it&#39;s scoped initialization of resources. We use<br/>\n&gt; this in Java all the time (static fields, fields, local variables).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I judged by the test code that the OP was using it as a way to avoid <br/>\ninitializing the same data for all the tests in the test case class. I <br/>\nguessed that it was a performance hack, since I&#39;ve seen 1000 people want <br/>\nto do the same thing. I suppose we should let the OP tell me whether it <br/>\nreally was or wasn&#39;t a hack.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; You need a resource at the class level, you initialize it in a BeforeClass<br/>\n&gt; method. You need a resource at the method level, you initialize it in a<br/>\n&gt; Before method.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Right... so don&#39;t initialize an instance-level resource with <br/>\n@BeforeClass. Either use @Before or make the resource class-level. I&#39;m <br/>\npretty sure that&#39;s what I said, along with &quot;And by the way, why do you <br/>\nwant a class-level resource here? I&#39;m worried you might be trying to <br/>\noptimize unnecessarily and possibly counterproductively.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Doesn&#39;t get any simpler or more intuitive than that...<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I agree; so what&#39;s your point again?<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ.
