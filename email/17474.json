With Drag and Drop<br/>\nfeatures?.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s why I said I am plying with netBeans and/or Java Studio 8. By the<br/>\nway Java Studio 8 is built on netBeans. netBeans do have the Graphical<br/>\nDrag and Drop Features to Build the GUIs Soon, than by laying out the<br/>\ninterface by hand.<br/>\n<br/>\nI will be glad if he can tell me how to do this in Junit (point above).<br/>\nI can then forget netBeans or anything else.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Kumar&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJoel Altman<br/>\nShuttle Training Aircraft Project</div>",
