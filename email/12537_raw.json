It was pretty clear to me.\n&gt; \n&gt; E-mail can cause a lot of misunderstandings, especially when one \n&gt; projects their\n&gt; own assumptions into what they are reading.\n\n...and we all do.\n\n&gt; That is understandable.  But if you could point me to these pages then I \n&gt; would\n&gt; voraciously consume them.  I have of course read all the attached \n&gt; documentation\n&gt; that comes with JUnit, and I have been trying to make use of the \n&gt; JUnit-Addons\n&gt; package.\n\nIt would be best to start with Kent Beck&#39;s original paper, &quot;Smalltalk \nTesting with Patterns&quot;. It gives you some insight into the intent and \ndesign of JUnit (based on SUnit). Google will help you find it.\n\n&gt; Sure, but it is also enervating when you are told to give it up when you \n&gt; know\n&gt; that there is more to the story.\n\nIf we&#39;d been able to chat over beer, I&#39;d have been happy to go on....\n\n&gt; I believe that I have found my own answer.  At least here are my \n&gt; thoughts at the\n&gt; moment.  Data driven testing in the way that I am trying to do it is not \n&gt; easily\n&gt; supported in JUnit.  There is likely a reason for this, since a lot of \n&gt; thought\n&gt; has gone into producing JUnit.  I now believe that my approach is not in \n&gt; keeping\n&gt; with JUnit.  Since I am running the actual metadata from the application \n&gt; through\n&gt; the test, I am doing more of a data driven functional type of testing.  A\n&gt; solution that appears more consistent with JUnit and unit testing in general\n&gt; seems to be to make some mock metadata classes that are specially \n&gt; designed to\n&gt; exercise my code in the test.  This way my test is not dependent on any\n&gt; production code rather than the actual class that it is testing, and I \n&gt; am not\n&gt; trying to dynamically find all the production code and iterate through \n&gt; it all.\n&gt; Instead I am looking to carefully engineer my own metadata to exercise \n&gt; my tests.\n&gt; To implement this I basically wrote an abstract test class, and then made\n&gt; specific subclasses that are each mainly concerned with building \n&gt; specific mock\n&gt; data.  It is okay that this data is hardcoded rather than dynamic \n&gt; because I am\n&gt; looking to exercise the code by carefully building my own data rather than\n&gt; running through all data that currently exists in the application.  I was\n&gt; basically being lazy by using data that already existed and not crafting \n&gt; my own.\n\n&quot;Lazy&quot; might be harsh, but I&#39;m with you.\n\n&gt; But running actual production data does seem useful at least a few times \n&gt; when\n&gt; testing your own tests, just because there is some potential in catering \n&gt; to your\n&gt; own tests when writing your own data as well.  Does that part make \n&gt; sense?  This\n&gt; is the only thing that feels strange about my current ideas.  Am I on \n&gt; the right\n&gt; track?\n\nYes; it&#39;s just a question of which tools, and for this kind of \nend-to-end testing, I recommend Fit/FitNesse, especially when it&#39;s \nheavily data-driven, by which I mean the same algorithm and 100 sets of \ninput/expected output. The Fit ColumnFixture is built for that purpose.\n\n&gt; I know that there are many frustrations with dealing with a mailing list.  I\n&gt; applaud your taking the time to answer people�s questions, and feel very \n&gt; lucky\n&gt; to have the opportunity to carry on a dialog with an expert.  Thanks so \n&gt; much for\n&gt; your time getting me past this hurdle.\n\nNo problem. Thanks for your patience. Take care.\n-- \nJ. B.
