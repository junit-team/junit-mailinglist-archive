However,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; if you have a suite() method that calls<br/>\n&gt;&gt; TestSuite.addTest(Test), which Donny did, then no such &quot;automatic&quot;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; creation _should_ happen.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Wow, you really had me there.

Tests get<br/>\ninstantiated at the start (one instance per test), they are run, and<br/>\nthen, depending on the runner, they are thrown away or reused. That&#39;s<br/>\nwhy setUp and tearDown are important; they move expensive work to a<br/>\nlifecycle around test execution.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe justification is for the tools. Look at the behaviour in IntelliJ<br/>\nor Eclipse&#39;s test runners. You get a list of tests appearing, you can<br/>\nsee which one is being executed, you can tell which ones have failed,<br/>\nand you can look at it afterwards to see why it failed. Yes, you can<br/>\ndo it in other ways (as you&#39;ve done in TestNG), but that&#39;s why it was<br/>\ndone in JUnit 3. (4 also has this behaviour... the test<br/>\ninvoking-object is created at the start and held around).<br/>\n<br/>\nYou may want to re-read my JUnit Architecture Redux, Cedric...<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://twasink.net/blog/archives/2004/04/junit_architect.html.\">http://twasink.net/blog/archives/2004/04/junit_architect.html.</a><br/>\n<br/>\nRobert.</div>",
