Un=\r\nit testing is far easier to cover fully because each section is smaller. In=\r\ntegration testing involves a large number of things working together. There=\r\nfore, you know the integration testing failed - but no where it failed. Whe=\r\nn a unit test fails you have a far smaller haystack to search.\n\nHowever, if=\r\n I have done a proper job of unit testing against a published specification=\r\n then my confidence level entering integration testing is far higher than s=\r\nomeone that did no unit testing. Therefore, on a integration testing failur=\r\ne it should not be in my code.\n\n\nChip\n-----\nProgramming: Its not just a job=\r\n - its an indenture \n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Mike Bresnahan [mai=\r\nlto:java-junit@...]\nSent: Friday, June 20, 2003 5:33 PM\nTo: junit@y=\r\nahoogroups.com\nSubject: [junit] Re: Unit Testing vs Integration Testing\n\n\n&gt;=\r\n Unit testing gives you confidence in your objects.
