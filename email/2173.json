    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2115231982\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt;Are folks worried about accidentally leaving asserts out of methods,<br/>\n&gt;or about evil programmers boosting their test count by writing bogus<br/>\n&gt;tests?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>From what I can tell, more of the first than the second. I was never <br/>\nconcerned about either; however, it seems like some folks are concerned <br/>\nabout writing a test, being interrupted part way through, then forgetting to <br/>\nassert something.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet me share my experience with this. The most common mistake I make is <br/>\nthis:<br/>\n<br/>\npublic void testNullParameters() {<br/>\n    try {<br/>\n        A a = new A(null);<br/>\n    }<br/>\n    catch (IllegalArgumentException success) {<br/>\n    }<br/>\n}<br/>\n<br/>\nThis test passes, even though I know I didn&#39;t write the exception throwing <br/>\ncode. So I curse myself, add the fail() statement and move on. The great <br/>\nthing is that it only takes 15 seconds to verify that I made a mistake. Mind <br/>\nyou, this is a simple case, so you may experience different things. Counting <br/>\nassertions likely would not have helped me there.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re concerned about forgetting to assert, try this:<br/>\n<br/>\npublic void testMethod() {<br/>\n    fail(&quot;NYI&quot;);   // &quot;Not yet implemented&quot;<br/>\n}<br/>\n<br/>\nThe rule is: don&#39;t remove the fail statement until you&#39;re satisfied that the <br/>\ntest is correct. Do this until you don&#39;t forget to assert something as <br/>\noften. I guess this is a &quot;study&quot; within test-first programming. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nJBR.<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp\">http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp</a></div>",
