Has any one\n&gt; &gt; looked into this ? Is there any proposed changes for the JUnit assert\n&gt; &gt; method ? How will a code for the unit testing written using JUnit be\n&gt; &gt; compatible with the JDK1.4 version ?\n&gt;\n&gt;I&#39;m offering this response to be added to the new FAQ, since this\n&gt;question comes up about once a week.  Jim, are you maintaining the FAQ?\n\n\nMaintaining? Er, I haven&#39;t even started it! Still, I don&#39;t think I have too \nmuch to do tomorrow so I might as well make a start on it...\n\n\n\n\n&gt;Q: In Java 1.4, &#39;assert&#39; is a keyword.  Won&#39;t this conflict with JUnit&#39;s\n&gt;assert() method?  If so, what can be done about it?\n&gt;\n&gt;A: JUnit 3.7 deprecates assert() and replaces it with assertTrue(),\n&gt;which works exactly the same way.  Simply upgrade your JUnit to 3.7 and\n&gt;change all assert() calls in your existing tests to assertTrue().\n&gt;\n&gt;If you have Perl and a Unix shell (or a Unix-like shell in Windows, such\n&gt;as Cygwin or MKS Toolkit), this can be accomplished with a global\n&gt;replacement at the command line.\n&gt;\n&gt;Simply go to the top of your Java source code directory and run the\n&gt;following command:\n&gt;\n&gt;$ find . -name &#92;*.java | xargs perl -i.bak -p -e\n&gt;&#39;s/assert&#92;(/assertTrue&#92;(/g;&#39;\n&gt;\n&gt;This will search every Java source file in your tree for the string\n&gt;&quot;assert(&quot; and replace it with &quot;assertTrue(&quot;.  The open parentheses is\n&gt;included to avoid accidentally changing instances of the word &quot;assert&quot;\n&gt;that aren&#39;t JUnit methods.  Copies of your original source files are\n&gt;renamed with the .bak suffix, so if something goes wrong you can always\n&gt;undo your work.\n&gt;\n&gt;If you are in a Windows environment and don&#39;t have these sorts of Unix\n&gt;shell tools, Cygwin &lt;http://www.redhat.com/software/tools/cygwin/&gt; is\n&gt;freely available under GPL, and includes the find and xargs commands as\n&gt;well as Perl.  Alternately, if you have a lot of time on your hands and\n&gt;never make mistakes, you could manually edit all your tests with a GUI\n&gt;editor in your IDE.\n&gt;--\n\n\nGreat - I&#39;ll add it - with one caveat. A decent editor like ultraedit will \ndo all your regex will, and a lot more safely...\n\nAnd congratulations on writing the first entry ;)\n\nJim\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--\n\n                           *   Jim Cheesman   *\n             Trabajo: \njchees@... - (34)(91) 724 9200 x 2360\n                           Evil is \nnot all bad.\n\n\n\n",
