What Agitator can do for you is<br/>\n&gt; generate test data that gets you code coverage and then shows you<br/>\n&gt; what it observed in the form of class and method invariants.  These<br/>\n&gt; observations are in the form of Java boolean valued assertions.  For<br/>\n&gt; example:<br/>\n&gt;      <br/>\n&gt;       File.canWrite() == true<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Or<br/>\n&gt;       File.getPath().equals(&quot;C:&#92;foo&#92;bar&quot;)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Or<br/>\n&gt;       File.list().length == 14<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>So does Agitator only report invariants it uncovers, or does it also <br/>\ngenerate tabular data representing the output it received for each input?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounds like Agitator does this:<br/>\n<br/>\n  * try a bunch of inputs<br/>\n  * notice patterns in the outputs/state of the code<br/>\n  * say to the programmer, &quot;It looks like XYZ is invariant. Would this <br/>\nbe a useful assertion?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy original response was &quot;Great tool for testing legacy code, useless <br/>\nfor TDD,&quot; but this makes me think otherwise:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;snip /&gt;<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt; Combined with Agitator&#39;s ability to automatically generate very<br/>\n &gt; relevant test data and achieve very high code coverage automatically<br/>\n &gt; (through data flow analysis and other dynamic techniques), automated<br/>\n &gt; observations are a powerful and very efficient way to create unit<br/>\n &gt; tests quickly to get the developer to consider inputs and conditions<br/>\n &gt; that they might have missed.  But the developer input is still<br/>\n &gt; required to decide if what Agitator observed is what the code is<br/>\n &gt; suppsed to do.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This looks like another method of receiving feedback on the quality of <br/>\nthe tests one chooses to write, even when doing TDD.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;ll stop here because I don&#39;t want to use this forum to promote<br/>\n&gt; Agitator, but I wanted to clear any misconceptions and answer J.B.&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; questions.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No, no, this is quite good. It sounds interesting, and is certainly <br/>\nworth examining. It makes me wish I had a project to which to point it <br/>\nand try it out.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
