An XSL stylesheet that looks\n&gt;  &gt; for that one test result and highlights failures in big, bold red\n&gt;  &gt; letters would be easy (we know how to do it), and effective, if not \n&gt; perfect.\n&gt; \n&gt; I think that&#39;s not too bad a kludge, actually, though I&#39;d really prefer\n&gt; to have the information closer to the tests.\n\nCurt, just because it&#39;s not the solution you had in mind doesn&#39;t make it \na &quot;kludge&quot;. (The implication is that the solution isn&#39;t really a \nsolution at all, and the further implication is that I&#39;m just too lazy \nto solve the problem. I don&#39;t like that.) You stated your problem as &quot;I \nwant it to be obvious that test 125 failed so that I can ignore the \nother failures.&quot; You did not state as a requirement that those other \ntests ought not to execute. What I suggest is a full-blown solution to \nyour problem as stated. :)\n\n&gt; However, what about those of us who work with the command-line testrunner?\n\nBuild your own test runner that listens for that failure and alerts you \nspecially somehow. I think that suggestion puts me in the &quot;A&quot; category. :)\n\nOnce you have other, more complicated dependencies to deal with, add \nsome kind of rules engine to the test runner that allows you to collect \n&quot;key results&quot; -- that is, the list of results you check first before \nlooking at the rest. Something like that.\n\nTake care.\n-- \nJ. B. Rainsberger,\nDiaspar Software Services\nhttp://www.diasparsoftware.com :: +1 416 791-8603\nLet&#39;s write software that people understand\n\n",
