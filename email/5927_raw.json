Looking back at the emails we\n&gt;exchanged, your only real comment about it then was, &quot;I would be interested\n&gt;to hear anything you hear from your EJU customers about JUnitPerf.&quot; I also\n&gt;made the comment to you that &quot;I hope it wasn&#39;t too presumptuous of us to\n&gt;include it&quot;, which you never responded to.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\nWhat surprises you about my response?\n\nNo doubt, I was disappointed that you didn&#39;t contact me prior to \ndistributing JUnitPerf.  It&#39;s not that I wouldn&#39;t have allowed you to do \nso, just that I expected something a little more collegial.  The \nafter-action report stating that it was being distributed and that you \nhoped that was cool didn&#39;t sit well with me.  It didn&#39;t come across as \ngenuine, but perhaps it was just my interpretation.  Going back to the \nreason for my response, it didn&#39;t have that community feel.         \n\n&gt;Anyway, I would be happy to remove JUnitPerf from the distribution if it\n&gt;bothers you being there, as it is not at all core to the product. If you\n&gt;read the documentation you will see that it is described in terms of &#39;here&#39;s\n&gt;something else you can do with your tests if you add in a few JUnitPerf\n&gt;decorators&#39;. I haven&#39;t gotten any feedback from any of our customers that\n&gt;they are actually using JUnitPerf in conjunction with Enhanced JUnit.\n&gt;\n\nI don&#39;t have a problem with it being distributed.  The license clearly \ngrants you permission to do so, and I stand by that license.  Whether \nyou leave it in or not it completely up to you.  Your customers seem to \nhave already decided that your product stands on its own.\n\nI don&#39;t want this thread to become a reflection of your product.  If \nthere&#39;s follow-up, let&#39;s take it offline.\n\nMike\n\n-- \nMike Clark\nClarkware Consulting Inc.\nhttp://www.clarkware.com \n\n\n\n\n",
