I have written unit tests that range from a half dozen lines to two dozen lines. The shorter tests were for more easily tested things while the longer tests were for the more complicated test setups.<br/>\n<br/>\nAssuming that you have factored out any duplicate environment setup code, then just accept that some tests will be longer than others. My criteria as to whether it is a good test is whether it truely helps me find bugs in my code.<br/>\n<br/>\nSimon<br/>\n<br/>\n-----------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nSimon P.

The game has a specific set of tiles I want to <br/>\n&gt;create in the program.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I made the constructor of the Tile class private and provided static <br/>\n&gt;makeTileXyz methods to create tiles.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Now my test methods get quite large. Each of them assures that <br/>\n&gt;the tile <br/>\n&gt;has just (and only) the requested features. So each test checks for <br/>\n&gt;special items on the cards (e.g. isAbbey, isMarketsquare) and counts <br/>\n&gt;the roads coming in and the city parts a tile has.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;In addition tests get more complicated because tiles may be <br/>\n&gt;rotated in  <br/>\n&gt;the game. The test for makeRoadTurningLeft  (ensure the tile shows a <br/>\n&gt;road turning left) has to check whether the road goes south to west, <br/>\n&gt;west to north, north to east or east to south. In the end my tests are <br/>\n&gt;about 20 to 30 lines of code, but I was used to have 5 liners in other <br/>\n&gt;projects.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;What do you think about this test case size?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Would you create additional methods to help in testing, i.e. for <br/>\n&gt;counting the roads on one tile or a method like isSpecial?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Would you place such helpers in the test class (as they are only used <br/>\n&gt;for testing)? Does that get to complex, i.e. do you eventually need <br/>\n&gt;test cases for your test cases?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Would you rely on some orientation of created tiles, e.g. assume the <br/>\n&gt;left turning road is always constructed as from east turning to south <br/>\n&gt;(maybe this is like the Blackbox / Whitebox discussion)?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Would you even allow incomplete tests (not testing what is <br/>\n&gt;&quot;most likely <br/>\n&gt;working&quot;, e.g. assuming a tile does not have special items)?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Thanks for your comments.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Robert<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------ Yahoo!
