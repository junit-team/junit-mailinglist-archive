You mention several features of\nJUnit 3.x as new that will be part of JUnit 4 only for backward\ncompatibility. We are moving away from the composite structure\n(Test/TestCase/TestSuite) because it makes writing runners difficult and it\ndoesn&#39;t seem to be used much. We will build in the most-used decorators to\nthe test runner. We would love to figure out a way to make the runner\npluggable, but so far we haven&#39;t been able to do so. Our philosophy is to\nchoose simplicity over power when the two conflict.\n\nTake care,\n\nKent Beck\nThree Rivers Institute\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On \n&gt; Behalf Of Alexandru Popescu\n&gt; Sent: Monday, June 13, 2005 11:48 PM\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: Re: [junit] JUnit 4\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I am sorry this got to you in the wrong form.\n&gt; Please see it by yourself: \n&gt; http://themindstorms.blogspot.com/2005/06/junit-40.html.\n&gt; \n&gt; I was doing a feature by feature comparison. And that todo \n&gt; list was part of the CVS (and was talking\n&gt; about RC and final version - so I haven&#39;t got reasons to \n&gt; believe it was old/deprecated).\n&gt; \n&gt; hope this clears out my intention,\n&gt; :alex |.::the_mindstorm::.|\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; The theme of JUnit 4 is to encourage more developers to \n&gt; write more tests by\n&gt; &gt; further simplifying JUnit. To this end, we have followed \n&gt; NUnit&#39;s lead in\n&gt; &gt; identifying tests by annotation instead of subclassing and naming\n&gt; &gt; conventions. Tests can now live in any class. Tell JUnit \n&gt; they are there with\n&gt; &gt; the @Test annotation:\n&gt; &gt;   @Test public void basicTransaction() {...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The assertion methods are in an Assert class which is most \n&gt; easily used\n&gt; &gt; through static import:\n&gt; &gt;   import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;\n&gt; &gt;   ...\n&gt; &gt;   @Test public void example() {...assertEquals(2, 2);...}\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Set up and tear down are handled with the @Before and \n&gt; @After annotations.\n&gt; &gt; You can have as many @Befores and @Afters as you need. \n&gt; Inherited @Befores\n&gt; &gt; are executed before @Befores in subclasses and inherited @Afters are\n&gt; &gt; executed after @Afters in subclasses.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Shared setup is handled by @BeforeClass and @AfterClass. \n&gt; Methods with these\n&gt; &gt; annotations are executed once before (respectively after) \n&gt; all the tests in\n&gt; &gt; the class run.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; @Ignore causes a test not to be run, but it is reported as ignored.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; @Test takes two optional parameters. A test annotated \n&gt; @Test(timeout=100)\n&gt; &gt; will fail if the test takes longer than 100 milliseconds to \n&gt; complete. A test\n&gt; &gt; annotated @Test(expected=NullPointerException.class) will fail if a\n&gt; &gt; NullPointerException is not thrown and succeed if a \n&gt; NullPointerException is\n&gt; &gt; thrown.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Preserving existing investment in tests has taken nearly half of our\n&gt; &gt; development effort. JUnit 4 is forward and backward \n&gt; compatible. You can run\n&gt; &gt; older tests with the JUnit 4 test runner by passing them to \n&gt; the runner. You\n&gt; &gt; can run JUnit 4 tests with older test runners by wrapping \n&gt; the JUnit 4 test\n&gt; &gt; class in a compatibility class. The following method in a \n&gt; JUnit 4 test class\n&gt; &gt; causes it to run correctly with the Eclipse test runner.\n&gt; &gt;   public static junit.framework.Test suite() {\n&gt; &gt;     return new JUnit4TestAdapter(AssertionTest.class);\n&gt; &gt;   }\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; JUnit 4&#39;s command line interface can be invoked with:\n&gt; &gt;   java org.junit.runner.JUnitCore Test1 Test2\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The same interface can be invoked programmatically with:\n&gt; &gt;   JUnitCore.run(Test1.class, Test2.class);\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If you want to know more about the details of JUnit 4, you \n&gt; can browse the\n&gt; &gt; tests in org.junit.tests.*.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Erich and I will be participating on the JUnit lists to \n&gt; discuss further\n&gt; &gt; simplification of JUnit 4, integration with test runners, \n&gt; and experiences\n&gt; &gt; using it. Our experience with it (most of the tests were \n&gt; written JUnit 4\n&gt; &gt; style) has been very positive. The complexity of JUnit 3.x \n&gt; is like a tiny\n&gt; &gt; pebble in a shoe. It doesn&#39;t seem like much until it is gone.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Good testing,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Kent Beck\n&gt; &gt; Three Rivers Institute\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
