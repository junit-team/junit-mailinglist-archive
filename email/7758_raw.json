Right now, I&#39;m just trying to test back end server DAO code - \nnot ejbs.  The back end code works - i&#39;m just trying to get the tests \nconverted to ServerTestCases.   We&#39;ve just moved to WebLogic 7.1.\n\nWithin my test case, call it MyTestCase (that extends ServerTestCase\n()), I have a main that instantiates MyTestCase passing \nin &quot;MyTestCase&quot;.  Before calling the method I want to test, I have to \ncall a login class to set up some initial data that is required in my \ntest method (i.e, login credential data).  This login class connects \nto an oracle db to get the initial data.  Before doing so, the login  \nclass attempts to instantiate an InitialContext (to get a \nconnection), however, &#39;new InitialContext()&#39; throws the following:\n\njavax.naming.NoInitialContextException: Cannot instantiate class: \norg.jnp.interfaces.NamingContextFactory [Root\nexception is java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: \norg.jnp.interfaces.NamingContextFactory]  \n\nThe login code works when called from our Struts front end, but \nthrows the above exception when called from MyTestCase.  What am I \nmissing as far as the InitialContext goes?  It seems that \nServerTestCase has successfully set up its InitialConext prior to me \ncalling this other class.  Shouldn&#39;t the Context then be available \nfor subsequent InitialConext calls?  Obviously, this is fuzzy to me.\n\nThanks.\n\n\n",
