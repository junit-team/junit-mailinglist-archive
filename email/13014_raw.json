I see the advantage of being able to reuse \nthe existing unit-tests for performance testing without having to \nwrite the testcases again (maybe even in a different (scripting)\nlanguage). But I&#39;m sure one has to bear in mind that the unit tests \nare to be used for performance testing as well, especially regarding \ngranularity and test-data. I also fear that JUnit tests ususally tend \nto not represent user-behavior, which is supposed to be simulated \nduring load-tests. But I&#39;m pretty sure than can be achieved with \nappropriate scheduling. \n\nSo do you have any experience about how JUnit + JUnitPerf/+The \nGrinder/... competes against &quot;pure&quot; load-test tools like Mercury&#39;s \nLoadRunner, Rational Robot, OpenSTA, The Grinder(without JUnit) etc.?\n\nThe reason why I&#39;m asking is because our developers start to use \nJUnit (I made them buy your book J.B. ;-) from now on (some already \nhave used it) and I&#39;m dealing with developing performance/loadtesting \nprocesses. Most of our applications run as EJBs on Bea WLS 8.1 with \noracle DBs. \n\nThanks in advance,\nThomas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
