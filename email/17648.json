Nearly every thing I do<br/>\n&gt; is run as a servlet, so you have to be thread safe. And all of my<br/>\n&gt; systems have assorted daemons and background threads, which implement<br/>\n&gt; simple things like WorkingSetCaches or do long things like<br/>\n&gt; talking to radios that have to be dispatched asynchronously.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I run into it, but typically on platforms that do the dirty work for me, <br/>\nso I don&#39;t have to worry about it. That&#39;s what I meant. As for servlets, <br/>\nI don&#39;t typically store writable data in servlet fields, but rather only <br/>\nstateless services, so the multiple threads invoking a servlet don&#39;t <br/>\nbother me. This is a case where following a few simple rules eliminates <br/>\nthe problem, rather than testing them out.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; And the AJAX folks are pushing the multi-threaded model even harder,<br/>\n&gt; with many more server clanks, and more chances for the server to get<br/>\n&gt; wrapped arround the axel with thread issues.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I have no idea how to test-drive Ajax stuff in Java. I&#39;ve only done it <br/>\nin Ruby, and, once again, the multithreadedness doesn&#39;t much come up.<br/>\n<br/>\nI merely favor eliminating the problem to solving it. I guess I&#39;ve been <br/>\nworking in domains that haven&#39;t forced me down the same roads you&#39;ve <br/>\nbeen down.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
