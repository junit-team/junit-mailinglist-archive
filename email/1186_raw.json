There is lot of dependencies between the\n&gt; classes.\n&gt;\n&gt; In one place it is creating objects. How to write test case to verify\n&gt; that created object is wrong or right?\n&gt;\n&gt; In run time they are writing data into database, passing to various\n&gt; objects. We need to write test cases for all these. Creating objects and\n&gt; so on. Is it worth writing test cases for this sort of scenario?  I am\n&gt; thinking that doing black box testing is better than writing JUnit test\n&gt; cases.\n\n\n\n",
