Furthermore, I see them as being\npackage protected and not exposed (I&#39;d like private, but I hate having\ninner test classes).  Then I think to myself, if they are package\nprotected, what should the main function of the object be.  I then come\nup with the high level API...\n\n-          PhotoDirectoryRandomizer(File sourceDir, File destinationDir)\n\n-          PhotoDirectoryRandomizer::copy() - void\n\n \n\nNote: I would, and feel I should, do this before writing any tests.\nThis does not mean that I started writing any code.  I&#39;m just realizing\nwhat the API might need to be.  It appears that you started writing\ntests before realizing the API.   I used to do that too, and found\nmyself throwing out a lot of my original tests.\n\n \n\nThe set of four methods (one being a constructor) is easy to test, and\neasy to drive with a tool like JSAP (Which I swear on for a Java command\nline parser).  The constructor would do &quot;no work&quot; but just object\ninitialization.  Finally the package protected methods can be tested\nindependently as that is where most of the work occurs.\n\n \n\nI would not break it up past that.\n\n \n\nJust my 0.02$.\n\n \n\nBig Mike\n\n \n\nFrom: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of\nrejohnsoca\nSent: Tuesday, August 25, 2009 3:32 PM\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: [junit] What should I be testing?\n\n \n\n  \n\nI&#39;ve been playing a bit with Test Driven Development, and have read the\nbook, but now I want to try it out, and am really not sure what to do\nnext...\n\nMy wife loves to show photo slide shows on our living room windows-XP\ncomputer (have patience, it will come together), but she doesn&#39;t like\nthat the pictures show up in order. I want to write a small utility to\nrename the pictures in a controllable way, but prefixing something like \n&quot;RND&quot;, a set of random digits, and the original name. For example, if\nthe original was DCIM1001.jpg, I want the class to rename the file to\n&quot;RND4356332_DCIM1001.jpg&quot;. Windows can then show the photos in a\n&#39;random&#39; order, but I can still figure out the real photo name, in case\nsomeone wants a copy. Sounds simple.\n\nI want to build this, using TDD.\nI figure that I need to build tests, and get green bars in eclipse in\nthe following order:\n-instantiate my photoRandomizer class\n-pass it several different paths, and have them be validated (null,\nempty, non-existing, very long, very short, etc...).\n\nthat was easy.\nbut my next question, is now what?\nIf I was writing this without TDD, my next step, would have been to\niterate through the directory, and rename all of the files according to\nmy scheme. I can&#39;t see an operational advantage to exposing any of this\nto outside, or make it more than one method, for testing purposes.\n\nmaybe what I should do, is have a method that iterates through the\nappropriate directory, generates a random number, and then passes both\npieces of information to another method which renames the target file.\nThis doesn&#39;t seem like a very good way to do it, but then I would at\nleast be able to test the renaming.\n\nWhat am I missing?\n\n\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
