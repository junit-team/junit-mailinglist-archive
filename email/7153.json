Is there anyway to do <br/>\nthis with the existing framework.  In textui as it stands nothing is <br/>\noutput for a pased test (other than &quot;.&quot;) and then the failures and <br/>\nerrors are each listed seperately.  I want to have each test&#39;s result <br/>\nlisted as the tests are executed.<br/>\n<br/>\nie.  you could have a test passed then a failed test and then another <br/>\npassed test outputed in this order.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope that I haven&#39;t confused anyone with this roundabout question.<br/>\n<br/>\nM Lavery</div>",
