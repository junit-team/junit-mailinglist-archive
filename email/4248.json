The javascript functions would <br/>\nignore the default - hardcoded - action of the form, unlike pure httpUnit.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe buttons were :<br/>\n      &quot;Save&quot;, &quot;Delete&quot;, &quot;Reload&quot;...<br/>\nThe javascript functions were :<br/>\n      &quot;callSaveServlet()&quot;, &quot;callDeleteServlet()&quot;, ..<br/>\nThe target servlets were :<br/>\n      SaveServlet, DeleteServlet, ReloadServlet<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nUsing Velocity (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://jakarta.apache.org/velocity/)\">http://jakarta.apache.org/velocity/)</a>, the simplest way I <br/>\nfound, was to have this hardcoded action linked to a Velocity variable <br/>\n&quot;$actionTarget&quot;.<br/>\n=&gt;<br/>\nBefore clicking the &quot;Save&quot; button with httpUnit, I would just change, <br/>\nthrough Velocity, the value of $actionTarget to &quot;SaveServlet&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nThough not the real thing, it was good enough for repetitive unit <br/>\ntesting, as we had one &quot;non-automated&quot; test (read : &quot;manual&quot;) test, that <br/>\nwould have trapped typos related error.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nUsing this trick, I could extensively test my javascript enabled <br/>\nweb-app. with pure and simple httpUnit.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was good enough for enough for us.<br/>\nCould be for you.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlain Ravet</div>",
