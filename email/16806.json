It is not just about testing. It <br/>\nis about developing and understanding the code you;re going to write. It <br/>\nis about speeding up the development process.<br/>\n<br/>\nTest last is the traditional approach, and it doesn&#39;t even have the same <br/>\ngoals.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; JUnit or TestNG? Whatever feels most natural to you.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sure.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Instead of attacking or confronting people who bring other approaches,<br/>\n&gt; views, and tools to the table, we should welcome them because we need<br/>\n&gt; more people on our side and more/better tools and options to get more<br/>\n&gt; people to join the ranks of test-infected developers.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The sides are not where you think they are. No one here is arguing <br/>\nagainst the relevance of QA departments and testing. However test first <br/>\ndevelopment is primarily about *development*, not testing. It is a <br/>\nprogramming strategy. That strategy depends critically on writing the <br/>\nunit tests in sync with the code. It depends critically on applying <br/>\nhuman intelligence to the code so the *humans* develop better <br/>\nunderstanding of what they want. These are not side issues. They are at <br/>\nthe core of test driven development.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n﻿Elliotte Rusty Harold  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:elharo@...\">elharo@...</a><br/>\nJava I/O 2nd Edition Just Published!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafeaulait.org/books/javaio2/\">http://www.cafeaulait.org/books/javaio2/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596527500/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/\">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596527500/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/</a></div>",
