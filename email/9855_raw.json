I&#39;m retrofitting unit tests onto an existing large J2EE app.\n\nTo me, one of the benefits of tests is that they help me to spot design\nproblems early. Whenever I find it difficult to write a test for a method, I\nask myself whether it&#39;s the method&#39;s fault.\n\nYour method checks a number of fields from another class and selects its\nbehaviour based on the value of those fields. It looks like a case of\nFeature Envy, meaning that you pull out information from someone else to\ndecide what to do. Shouldn&#39;t this decision be delegated to the owner of the\ninformation itself (Move Method refactoring)? Also, those conditionals look\nlike an ideal target for the Replace Conditional with Polymorphism\nrefactoring. Maybe the &quot;status&quot; object could be the thing to delegate these\ndecisions to, after turning it into its own hierarchy? These are just hints,\nand they might not work. Your approach could be justified by the desire to\ntake DB-related methods out of the Customer business class. Still, I would\ninvestigate in other ways to do the same thing with less conditionals.\n\nSometimes I see a test as a particularly exacting and low-level &quot;user&quot; of\nthe system. As for real users, tests sometimes complain that the system is\ntoo complex. We should never assume that the user is stupid. Maybe the\nsystem really *is* too complex.\n\n---------------\nPaolo Perrotta\nBologna, Italy\n\n\n",
