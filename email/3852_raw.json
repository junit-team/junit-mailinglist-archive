The only thing you have\nto watch out for is any static code (i.e. the popular singleton\naccessor).   Email me if you need additional help.\n\nOn a related note I saw a reply mentioning Joshua.  Since the\ncode wasn&#39;t available we threw together a distributed test \nrunner using NFS and SSH.  Allows us to parallelize our\nunit test runs across about a dozen boxes.   Since we do\nseveral integration tests using the junit framework it \nhelps testing time tremendously.\n\nCheers!\n\nMike\n\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: guillaume_berche [mailto:guillaume.berche@...]\n&gt; Sent: Monday, January 21, 2002 8:49 AM\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: [junit] Junit support for non-standard distributed \n&gt; applications\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Hello,\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m working on a Java layer implementing various communication \n&gt; infrastructrure betwen processes based on raw TCP and UDP. I would \n&gt; like to test it using Junit. However, this requires me to write a \n&gt; test case which is distributed among many processes which act as \n&gt; client/servers.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve looked into jakarta&#39;s cactus, and Junit EE but I understand they \n&gt; would support only distributed applications based on standard \n&gt; communication protocols (namely HTTP and an EJB contained)\n&gt; \n&gt; Is there an extension to Junit that would support testing of non-\n&gt; standard distributed applications?\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve started designing an RMI-based version of the junit interfaces \n&gt; where a testcase could spawn one or more &quot;distributed test cases&quot; \n&gt; running on remote hosts and that would report their status through \n&gt; the originating test&#39;s TestListener. I&#39;m basically remotizing the \n&gt; junit interfaces.\n&gt; \n&gt; I wonder if such extension would already exist and if I could reuse \n&gt; it rather than redoing this from scratch. \n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks for your help,\n&gt; \n&gt; Guillaume.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
