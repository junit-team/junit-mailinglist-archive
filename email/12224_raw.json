However it looks like that \nI \n&gt; &gt;will have to run my tests in a container, meaning I have to use \n&gt; &gt;Cactus. I don&#39;t think I can do this with Cactus because they \n&gt; &gt;instantiate TestCase. If there is a way I would love to know.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; Another less elegant solution is to simply do your own comparison \n&gt; instead of the assertEquals, store any failures in an Array or \nsomesuch, \n&gt; then, at the end of the whole loop,  assertEquals that the problem \narray \n&gt; is empty, dumping the contents of the array into the message param.\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; Chris\n&gt; http://clabs.org\n\n\n\n\n",
