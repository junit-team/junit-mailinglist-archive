This release\nmakes =\r\nPODAM very fault-taulerant. PODAM will create a POJO no matter\nwhich constr=\r\nuctor type you declared (public no-arg, private no-arg,\npublic with args, n=\r\non-public with args).\n\nThe difference between 2.3.3 is that while before no=\r\nn-public, non-\ndefault constructors were not covered now they are; addition=\r\nally while\nbefore in case of non JavaBean standard constuctors PODAM create=\r\nd an\ninstance but did not populate its attributes, now it both creates an\ni=\r\nnstance and populates its attributes.\n\nRegards,\n\nMarco \n\n\n",
