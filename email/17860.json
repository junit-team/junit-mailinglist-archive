To improve my development<br/>\n&gt; skills and my JUnit skills, I am writing some JUnit tests.  Today, I<br/>\n&gt; found that the developer had implemented System.exit(n) throughout<br/>\n&gt; the application whenever there was a trapped exception.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Now, the requirements call for the application to return some exit<br/>\n&gt; code telling any downstream processes whether this application was<br/>\n&gt; 100% successful with no warnings (rc=0), 100% successful with<br/>\n&gt; warnings (rc=4), not successful at all (rc=8).  However, the only<br/>\n&gt; java mechanism for reporting return codes is System.exit(n), based on<br/>\n&gt; my use of Google.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My JUnit dilemma then, is that System.exit(n) gives the required<br/>\n&gt; application behavior but doesn&#39;t seem to be good for running JUnit<br/>\n&gt; tests from a test suite since System.exit(n) ends the JVM.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Does anyone have any insights they can share?  Since this is my first<br/>\n&gt; post to this forum, I&#39;m happy to Google some more if you&#39;ll only give<br/>\n&gt; me some keyword hint(s) beyond what I&#39;ve already tried:  &quot;java exit<br/>\n&gt; code&quot;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I see you get lots of suggestions on mocking etc. which I guess might be a<br/>\nbit difficult here. Cedrics suggestion seemed  like it might work, though I<br/>\nam not familiar with that. A simple  thing to try might be to start your own<br/>\nprocess for it and see what it returns. Runtime.exec() or whatever was the<br/>\nmethod to do that. Its slow and not a nice solution but might be one option<br/>\nto get something tested until you can fix it, if you can.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
