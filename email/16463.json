    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-618890053\">Greg,<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; We have 2 &quot;AllTests&quot; classes for each package in our system, one that <br/>\n&gt; has DB tests and one for everything else. Then we have 2 corresponding <br/>\n&gt; system-level &quot;AllTests&quot; classes that encompass all the package-<br/>\n&gt; level &quot;AllTest&quot; classes. Is there an easy and reliabe way to keep <br/>\n&gt; these &quot;AllTest&quot; classes up to date? It&#39;s hard enough to get everyone <br/>\n&gt; to write tests, but now they also have to remember to update the <br/>\n&gt; appropriate &quot;AllTests&quot; classes any time they create a new test class. <br/>\n&gt; I hoping there&#39;s a pattern or JUnit extension or something that will <br/>\n&gt; help with this. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Our project has a similar structure. A couple of months ago I asked the <br/>\nlistserve about the usefulness of a custom XDoclet task that would build <br/>\nthese AllTests class automatically. The list&#39;s consensus is that there <br/>\nisn&#39;t an existing tool to do that, but that such a tool wouldn&#39;t be <br/>\nentirely useful because there are classes that can do this on the fly, <br/>\nsuch as the JUnit Addons&#39; ArchiveSuiteBuilder <br/>\n[<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://junit-addons.sourceforge.net/junitx/util/ArchiveSuiteBuilder.html%5d\">http://junit-addons.sourceforge.net/junitx/util/ArchiveSuiteBuilder.html%5d</a>. <br/>\nBut since that&#39;s not what you (or I) are looking for, the XDoclet <br/>\napproach sounds more realistic. I can&#39;t send you what I&#39;ve written, but <br/>\nI&#39;d be happy to point you in the right direction for writing such a task <br/>\nyourself.</div>",
