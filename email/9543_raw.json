Oddly\n&gt; &gt; enough, the variable name length definitely has a pronounced effect\n&gt; &gt; in C++.  On a slow PC used as a test box, results looked like this:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;            Java    C++ -O1    C++ -O2\n&gt; &gt; short      13.4s     3.2s       4.1s\n&gt; &gt; long       12.0s     8.4s       7.2s\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; memory use 12.4 MB   0.8 MB     0.8 MB\n\n&gt; with java you have to let the hotspot warm up, running the code several\n&gt; times to let the jvm analyze code.\n\n&gt; Run the benchmark for some seconds, than start to measure.\n\nLike hell you do.\n\nWhen you are benchmarking one thing against another, you don&#39;t give one\npreferential treatment.  You run them under exactly the same conditions.\n\nNow in this case, I was actually being kind to Java.  I ignored the\nstartup time.  Had I done &quot;fairer&quot; tests, C++ would have outperformed\nJava by a much wider margin.\n\nBut the tests were absurdly biased to begin with.  They were about as\nbiased as possible towards removing all of the effects being discussed.\n\n&gt; To have a smaller footprint try -Xms1m.\n\nIn the context of the discussion you are replying to, to have a smaller\nfootprint, run the Java through JAX.  This will reduce the code size by\n60-70%.  That will reduce your load time and memory footprint by a similar\namount and have, I believe, a similar effect on execution time.\n\n--\nJim Dixon  jdd@...   tel +44 117 982 0786  mobile +44 797 373 7881\n\n\n",
