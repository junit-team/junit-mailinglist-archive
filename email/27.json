I tend to favour <br/>\nprotected over private in my objects then if I place the test in the <br/>\nsame package as my class I can test practically everything.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf I do want to place my tests in a separate test directory, I can <br/>\nmake a child class of my parent class (extends) and then proxy calls <br/>\nup to the parent via the child and test in the tests directory.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe extra work required is creating the child class and calling super <br/>\nup to the parent whenever a test is called on the child.<br/>\n<br/>\nJonathan</div>",
