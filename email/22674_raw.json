Then you c=\r\nan start your JUnit tests, and they simply start their own cache, which is =\r\nconfigured to work distributed and connect to the already running cache of =\r\nVmWare-related objects. Then the objects that you created with VmWare will =\r\nalso be available for the unit tests.\n\nThe connection in JUnit can be perfo=\r\nrmed in a Rule or in the BeforeClass methods.\n\nCheers,\nBogdan\n\n--- In junit=\r\n@yahoogroups.com, Ananth &lt;cbananth@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks a lot Kent.
