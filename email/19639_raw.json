Do you have some insights into that?\n\n&gt; About your Assurance/CPU point:  in my experience, CPU very quickly stops\n&gt; being the bottleneck for functional tests.\n&gt; \n&gt; Network bandwidth, I/O throughput, environment setup and test data\n&gt; initialization or uninitialization are what takes most of the time of\n&gt; lengthy tests as your application grows.  And as I said before, test runs\n&gt; that take hours if not sometimes entire nights to run are pretty common in\n&gt; enterprise software.\n\nOf course we all know that common != inevitable.\n\nI&#39;m not sure I need JUnit to support common behavior. What I really want \nit to support is excellent behavior. Might just be me, of course.\n\nCheers, Ilja\n\n",
