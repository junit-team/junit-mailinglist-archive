But I have a question which I hope some of you\n&gt; can help me with - it&#39;s regarding testing private/protected methods and how\n&gt; to organize my test package.\n&gt;\n&gt; First the package. I have read to articles regarding test (&quot;Junit best\n&gt; practices&quot; from JavaWorld and &quot;Incremental development with Ant and JUnit&quot;\n&gt; from developerWorks). In the JBT article Andy Schneider advice you to keep\n&gt; tests in the same location as the source code. And in the Incremental...\n&gt; article Malcolm Davis advice you to make a separate package. Which approach\n&gt; is the best to use?\n&gt;\n\nit is better to make separate package. when we can identify as two separate\ncomponents like source code and test code it is better to keep them as two\ndifferent components from configuration management point of view.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; I must admit that I like the idea of making a separate package but then\n&gt; again - how do I then test private and protected methods? And if I keep the\n&gt; tests in the same location as the source code - who do I then test private\n&gt; methods?\n&gt;\n\nwe cant test private and protected methods directly.\nwe need to find the public methods, which are using those protected and private\nmethods and test that public methods is enough. Still it is not sufficient.\n\none thing the developer can do is, he can change the private and protected to\npublic and test them. after that he can change back to private and protected\nrespectively. but this is not that much good idea.\n\nstill we need to find the exact way.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; I would very much appreciate if some of you could give me a little example\n&gt;\n&gt; Kind regards,\n&gt;\n&gt; J.
