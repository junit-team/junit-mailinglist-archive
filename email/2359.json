Any licensee<br/>\nwho has validated their Java implementation should be able to tell you<br/>\nabout it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe it was never released publicly outside of the TCK tests.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is a harness for running tests.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe product that Sun scrapped was called Java Star.  It did GUI automation<br/>\ntesting by plopping stuff into the event queue, and also some kind of<br/>\ncapture/record/playback was involved.  However, since it does it through<br/>\nthe event queue, I found it entirely useless to my needs and Robot does<br/>\nthe specific automation things that I need (ya have to build stuff around<br/>\nRobot though, but so what).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n- David<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Tue, 14 Aug 2001, Mike Clark wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Richard Jensen wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m trying to get a team to use JUnit to do automated unit testing.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; One of our members referenced &#39;JavaTest&#39; from Sun and gave me a .pdf<br/>\n&gt; &gt; document (~180 pages) with a description of it.
