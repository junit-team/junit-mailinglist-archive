Let&#39;s discuss further here, and\nthen summarize to the bug posting--I&#39;ve indicated as such to the\ntracker listing.\n\nJust to make sure I&#39;m hearing you right, it sounds like you were using\na method to run all the tests, without having to enumerate them\nindividually.  Is that right?  What were you using?  Eclipse?  Ant?\n\nIt seems there&#39;s two concerns you bring up, and JUnit doesn&#39;t handle\neither natively: Suite construction (find all the tests I might want\nto run) and suite subdivision (only run the tests I actually want to\nrun).\n\n*** Suite construction ***\n\nIt&#39;s really important for me that it&#39;s clear how to run all my tests,\nso I&#39;ve often had to start with an AllTests suite from the very\nbeginning.  Maintaining those suites can be annoying, so in some of my\nprojects, I&#39;ve used Johannes Link&#39;s excellent ClasspathSuite:\n\nhttp://www.johanneslink.net/cpsuite.html\n\nThis allows me to run all tests in a package without having to\nenumerate them.  Eclipse and ant do this &quot;in the UI&quot;, but I prefer\ndoing it in the suite definition itself, so other developers can run\nmy tests without matching the UI.\n\n*** Suite subdivision\n\nOnce we can find all the tests we might want to run, how do we\nrestrict which are actually run?  There are two out-of-the-box\nsolutions I know of.\n\nFirst, I accomplish what you discuss through package organization: I\ncan run test.unit.**, test.online.**, or test.** to get everything.\nThis doesn&#39;t match every conceivable need, but it does match every\nneed I&#39;ve had so far.  Would it handle your current situation?\n\nSecond, JUnitExt claims to add a @Category annotation that does almost\nexactly what you promise.  Would that handle your situation?  One\nthought I have is that perhaps we&#39;d want to base groups on class\nnames, so that automated refactoring can help if we decide to use a\nmore informative name, and to provide an obvious place to document and\nextend a category definition.  That is, rather than\n\n@Category(&quot;online tests&quot;) public class MyTest {\n\nWe could have\n\n@Category(OnlineTests.class) public class MyTest {\n\nOr even just\n\n@OnlineTest public class MyTest {\n\nSo, questions for the community:\n\n1) Should something like ClasspathSuite be incorporated into JUnit?\n2) Should something like JUnitExt&#39;s categories be incorporated into JUnit?\n3) If yes to the above, what should the API look like?\n\nRemember that we strive to have JUnit be the intersection of all\nuseful testing frameworks, not their union.  Thanks,\n\n   David Saff\n\nOn 7/5/07, Christian Nelson &lt;cnelson@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; I&#39;ve created a new feature request describing what I think better\n&gt; suite/group support would look like:\n&gt;\n&gt; https://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1748683&group_id=15278&atid=365278\n&gt;\n&gt; Please chime in and share your thoughts on the subject.\n&gt;\n&gt; Christian\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Christian Nelson&quot; &lt;cnelson@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I have a feeling I&#39;m about to bring up a much discussed topic,\n&gt; &gt; however, I wasn&#39;t able to find any related topics by searching this\n&gt; &gt; mailing list.  My apologies in advance if this has been hashed out\n&gt; before.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; While generally thinking that its not a great idea, I occasionally\n&gt; &gt; come into a situation where I genuinely need to partition my tests\n&gt; &gt; into more than one group or partition or suite.  The latest example is\n&gt; &gt; with a client who has many unit style tests as well as a number of\n&gt; &gt; tests which require specific network connectivity only available from\n&gt; &gt; a subset of machines (the outgoing requests must come from a specific\n&gt; &gt; ip address).  We call these the &quot;online tests&quot;.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; We want to be able to group our tests into two groups, &quot;unit tests&quot;\n&gt; &gt; and &quot;online tests&quot;.  In some case we want to run only &quot;unit tests&quot; or\n&gt; &gt; only &quot;online tests&quot;, and in other cases we want to run both (or all).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I understand that this functionality is available using JUnit 4&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; @RunWith(Suite.class) and @SuiteClasses(TestClass1.class, ...).\n&gt; &gt; However, manually adding test classes to a suite is clunky because the\n&gt; &gt; list of  test classes becomes huge.  It&#39;s also error prone; it&#39;s easy\n&gt; &gt; for developers to write a test but forget to add it to @SuiteClass.\n&gt; &gt; Lastly, test runners will run test in suites multiple times when told\n&gt; &gt; to &quot;run all tests&quot;.  That&#39;s hardly the desired behavior.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; What I really would like to see is the concept of suite (or group in\n&gt; &gt; TestNG terms) be promoted to a first class citizen.  Honestly, I think\n&gt; &gt;  I would prefer it to be at the test class level (unlike TestNG which\n&gt; &gt; is at the test method level), since the mechanism should be used for\n&gt; &gt; high-level organization IMHO.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Is there any chance something like this might make its way into JUnit?\n&gt; &gt; What can I do to help?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks,\n&gt; &gt; Christian\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
