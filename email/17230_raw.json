Sometimes=\r\n I work with streams, sometimes\nI\n&gt; work with File objects and sometimes, I=\r\n just want the content of the file\nas\n&gt; an array of strings or as one big S=\r\ntring. It&#39;s unfortunate that the latter\n&gt; is still not supported in the JDK=\r\n.\n\nThe reason I am asking is that I always seem to prefer a\nFileStream/Read=\r\ner/Writer to working directly with a file. I have\nnoticed that a lot of peo=\r\nple seem to have a preference towards working\nwith files rather than Stream=\r\ns/Readers/Writers.\n\nIf I would want random acces or something I would opt f=\r\nor working\ndirectly with files but I can&#39;t recall needing that, I have not\n=\r\nwritten storages or such. Another occation when I use file objects is\nwhen =\r\ndoing file system management, creating listing, renaming, working\nwith dire=\r\nctories etc. But when I read/write data i always use\nstreams/readers/writer=\r\ns.\n\nCould you give an example when you think that reading/writing directly\n=\r\nto/from a File is better than a stream.\n\nAlso, when you have your array of =\r\nStrings or single big string, what\ndo you typically do with it? I can think=\r\n of some things but I am\ncurious.\n\nOne of the reasons I prefer Streams so m=\r\nuch is because of the\nadvantage of being able to direct state to memory rat=\r\nher than disk and\nvary source/target media (like parser might just aswell g=\r\net its input\nfrom a keyboard, socket, file, memory-location, it should not =\r\nbe bound\nto a file). The first point of directing state to memory is\nindisp=\r\nensable when testing.\n\nAlso, files imply mutable state of the worst kind. M=\r\nost of the bugs I\nfind in my code have to do with mutablestate in one way o=\r\nr another and\nthus I try to avoid it when possible. That is also why I am a=\r\n fan of\ninteractionbased testing.\n\nJust tossing some of my reasoning in the=\r\nre to be analysed, questioned\nand developed.\n/J\n\n\n \n\n\n\n**************   IMP=\r\nORTANT MESSAGE  **************\nThis e-mail message is intended only for the=\r\n addressee(s) and contains information which may be confidential. \nIf you a=\r\nre not the intended recipient please advise the sender by return email, do =\r\nnot use or disclose the contents, and delete the message and any attachment=\r\ns from your system.
