Should you test protected/private methods, or look at \nprotected/private members?\n\nA.  Yes.  In XP, the goal of Unit Testing is to &quot;test anything that \ncould possibly break.&quot;  If that means looking inside the class then \ndo it.  White-box testing is a very efficient way to &quot;test anything \nthat could possibly break&quot;\n\n\nQ.  Ok, how do you test protected/private methods?\n\nA.  For protected members, you have two options.  The first option is \nto have your tests in the same package, so they would have access.  \nThe second option is to use Java&#39;s reflection to make the protected \n(or private) member public.\n\nI think JUnitX has code to provide access.  I have also used \na &quot;PrivilegedAccess&quot; utility class to gain access.  I&#39;ll see if we \ncan get that code posted.\n\n\n- Greg Houston\n\n\n\n",
