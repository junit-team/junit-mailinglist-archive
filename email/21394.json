You should be able to<br/>\nfind many resources on this.<br/>\n2) Getting those tests to run from maven.  I have little to contribute here,<br/>\nbut others on-list or on Google might.<br/>\n3) Optimizing the acceptance-test-writing process.  In the absence of strong<br/>\nAI, the process of translating business requirements into acceptance tests<br/>\nis always going to be an engineering task, which needs skill and time in<br/>\nyour process.  I would suggest owning it as an engineering team, with gentle<br/>\nhand-off of small parts as it becomes _obvious_ people closer to product<br/>\nownership can do them.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope that helps,<br/>\n<br/>\n   David<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Tue, Feb 24, 2009 at 7:45 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:majkic@...\">majkic@...</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:majkic@...\">majkic@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; WOW.

Selenium seems to be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; nice, since it allows someone without much (or none at all)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; programming experience, as our Product Owner to create those tests<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; with Firefox Selenium IDE plug-in.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; But time has come to integrate those tests to other JUnit tests, so<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; these can be run on CI server.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Disclaimer: No JUnit, no Selenium-RC used in the solution below.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; What we did is to put all Selenium tests (HTML source) in a separate<br/>\n&gt; &gt; web-app, bundled with Selenium Core and an index.jsp that starts the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; test automatically when called by a browser. (We also mangled Selenium<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Core to let a USERNAME and PASSWORD Selenium variables be set and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; present in all tests - mangled means five lines of javascript code.)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; To have it run in a CI environment ... I wrote two applications:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; a) a simple app called &quot;test agent&quot; that can take two commands over<br/>\n&gt; &gt; XML-RPC:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; a1) start a browser pointing it at a certain URL (pointing to the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; index.jsp file mentioned above, also telling the browser where the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; selenium result should be posted)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; a2) stop a browser<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; b) A web-app called &quot;test conductor&quot; that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; b1) keeps track of test agents<br/>\n&gt; &gt; b2) aggregate results returned from browsers<br/>\n&gt; &gt; b3) register test new test runs and launch them when test agents become<br/>\n&gt; &gt; idle<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; This works well and having the test files in HTML (with human readable<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ID values on all elements the test interacts with) makes it useful for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; manual testing as well. Since the web-app with test can be deployed on a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; developers machine, a developer can also ask the test conductor to run a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; test off the developer&#39;s machine (and start debugging server side).<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; There&#39;s no JUnit integration. We just added a simple script on our CI<br/>\n&gt; &gt; environment (Hudson) that after each successful build of the full<br/>\n&gt; &gt; software stack does:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; i) download the build artifacts, deploy them to a test server<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ii) register a new test run with web-app b mentioned above<br/>\n&gt; &gt; iii) waits for b to return a fail/success<br/>\n&gt; &gt; iv) undeploys the artifacts from step i<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; This was all setup one year ago - the client I worked for wasn&#39;t sure<br/>\n&gt; &gt; what Selenium could do or if they wanted to invest time using it. Having<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the test written/saved in human readable HTML was a good selling point -<br/>\n&gt; &gt; if they decided to not go with Selenium then the tests could still be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; used &quot;as is&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Since then:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Selenium 1.0 still hasn&#39;t been released.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; There&#39;s still no Selenium Driver that can use HTML files as source.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 3000+ runs completed.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; We run test agents for FF2, FF3, IE7, Safari on Mac.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Parts of the test agent and test conductor is BSD-licensed, some parts<br/>\n&gt; &gt; where developed for the client (and I think they&#39;ll be happy to share<br/>\n&gt; &gt; under BSD-ish license).<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; / Fredrik<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
