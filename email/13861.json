Even worse: two possibly overlapping, but often disjoint, <br/>\n&gt; sets of<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; test fixture objects in the same test case class. Some tests use<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; fixture A and others use fixture B. Why not put those in <br/>\n&gt; separate test<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; case classes for clarity?<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; Because of the activation energy required to split off a new class, <br/>\n&gt; move<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; the right methods into it, remember to link it into the next level up,<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; add it to change control, fix the pesky layout infelicities the IDE <br/>\n&gt; likes<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; to avoid providing a configure-out option for, refactor the class<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; comments, etc?<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; [Pairing is good. Would that I could.]<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; It sounds more like quite a viscous environment (either the codebase,<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; the IDE, or a combination of the two): it&#39;s easier to do a bad thing<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; than a good thing.<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; Which IDE, you poor soul? In Eclipse it&#39;s just &quot;new class, copy, run<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; tests, delete, run tests, update, commit&quot;. Well, except for the class<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; comments, I guess. For that you&#39;re on your own. :)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Eclipse.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So that&#39;s &quot;new class&quot;. Copy. Fix layout. Fix suite(). Run tests. Delete<br/>\n&gt; tests. Run. Delete other tests in other class. Run. Check that the two<br/>\n&gt; classes are a partition of the original class. (One *must* do this, so<br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s probably better to do moves than deletes.) Look for shared code<br/>\n&gt; and partition it or move it to a suitable (possibly new) superclass.<br/>\n&gt; (There&#39;s usually some helper code like this.) Link the suite() into<br/>\n&gt; the parent suite. (Yes, we don&#39;t use the automatic recursive suite<br/>\n&gt; creation. Close call: but sometimes being able to trivially comment<br/>\n&gt; out subsuites has made bug-tracking much much easier, since we do<br/>\n&gt; sometimes end up with context-sensitive problems. Perhaps we just<br/>\n&gt; have too many global caches.) Run complete test suite. Stare hard<br/>\n&gt; at the new classname, rename to suitable, because now you have to<br/>\n&gt; introduce it to CVS, and renaming it later is a pain. Perform<br/>\n&gt; introduction. No, I don&#39;t want the file CVSed when it&#39;s created, since<br/>\n&gt; if I want to back it out later (when I realise I made a complete mess)<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t want dirty footprints in the repository. OK, everything works.<br/>\n&gt; Check in. Wait forever for CVS to complete. Time passes. Maybe there&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; some mail to read? Yes. Whoppee, CVS done. Change to paranoia window.<br/>\n&gt; CVS update. Wait forever for CVS to complete. Time passes. Mail already<br/>\n&gt; read, read news instead. CVS completes. ant build, run tests, all pass.<br/>\n&gt; Hooray! Don&#39;t do this on a Friday afternoon, you&#39;ll likely miss your<br/>\n&gt; train or break the build.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Somewhere in there I fixed the auto-layout. And did a CVS update (Wait.<br/>\n&gt; Time passes. Get tea.) before running the tests.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What do you do that if I did it too I could do better? Apart from using<br/>\n&gt; a faster CVS server, that is.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well...<br/>\n<br/>\n1. I use Subversion, so I don&#39;t have the same CVS issues you seem to <br/>\nhave. It also looks like you have far too much stuff in a single CVS <br/>\nserver or module. It looks like it&#39;s time to split them.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. It looks like you&#39;re spending a great deal of your effort maintaining <br/>\ntest suites. I suppose you have to do that for some good reason, but <br/>\nwhen I run my tests, I run them all. If I need two categories of tests, <br/>\nthat&#39;s two source trees. (test/source and slowtest/source)<br/>\n<br/>\n3. How often do you want to run only a subset of tests that isn&#39;t, for <br/>\nexample, a coherent package of tests? In Eclipse, I mostly right-click <br/>\neither the source tree or the package and run the tests.<br/>\n<br/>\n4. For the &quot;helper code&quot;, I generally make that stuff class-level as <br/>\npreparation for the refactoring, so it doesn&#39;t get in my way while I&#39;m <br/>\nmoving tests around. I spend less time in limbo with compile errors or <br/>\nred tests.<br/>\n<br/>\n5. Yes, I would imagine you have too many global caches. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n6. I&#39;m not sure why renaming a recently-created class is such a pain, <br/>\neven in CVS: it hardly has any history to worry about, so I wouldn&#39;t <br/>\nworry about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow long does this whole dance actually take for you? I imagine it&#39;s <br/>\nmore than one minute.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
