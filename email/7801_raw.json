I guess there&#39;s no such th=\r\ning out there. \n\nTesting is not factory work. There is no ten-step guide to=\r\n testing with EJBs. In fact, testing with EJBs -- really doing good Program=\r\nmer Testing -- is no different from testing code that lives in any other fr=\r\namework. There are a number of approaches, and the suggestions I have for y=\r\nou depend on your approach. That&#39;s why I asked you a question.\n\nSeeing as y=\r\nou&#39;re supposedly doing research at the graduate level, I assumed that you w=\r\nere both capable and willing to think for yourself a little. Google is not =\r\nsome oracle that knows all.\n\n&gt;However, I must say this. I am really disappo=\r\ninted at some of the \n&gt;replies out there which really don&#39;t address the rea=\r\nl question. \n&lt;snip /&gt;\n\nWhen you ask skilled people in their area a question=\r\n and they give you a strange answer, you could begin by assuming that they =\r\nhave a purpose to that answer. I&#39;m not saying that every answer you got was=\r\n a good one -- frankly, that doesn&#39;t concern me -- but did you think about =\r\nwhat I asked you at all? If you did, then what did you come up with? What k=\r\nind of testing are you trying to do? What is it that you&#39;re trying to verif=\r\ny?\n\n1. The business logic in your EJBs?\n2. The way you connect your busines=\r\ns logic into the EJB framework?\n3. Your EJB/RDB mapping for a CMP entity be=\r\nan?\n4. Your EJB lifecycle methods?\n\nI would suggest different approaches --=\r\n and tools -- for each. #1 requires some deft refactoring work, #2 and #3 p=\r\nrobably require connecting to the container and #4 is dead straight-forward=\r\n &quot;plain old Java object&quot; testing.\n\nAs you can see, &quot;Testing EJBs&quot; is really=\r\n not enough information for me to point you in what I think is the right di=\r\nrection.\n\nStill think it was a useless and irrelevant answer?\n\n&gt;Anyway, I a=\r\nm just expressing myself, and I hope that I don&#39;t offend, \n&gt;or tick off any=\r\none. I totally appreciate the time you guys took to \n&gt;reply to my message.\n=\r\n\nYour comments, though, lead me to believe that my assumption was faulty: t=\r\nhat you are not interested in thinking about the problem. Instead, you just=\r\n want to be told what 14 steps to follow to get a result. I realize that I =\r\nnever finished a Master&#39;s Degree, but when I was there and working on it, I=\r\n was responsible for thinking through problems and grappling with questions=\r\n.\n\nMaybe I&#39;ve gone too far, here, but I&#39;m just expressing myself. :)\n\n\nJ.
