Java&#39;s &quot;public&quot; access modifier\ndoesn&#39;t let\nyou distinguish between an API which is meant to be published and\navailable\nto a user, and APIs that the implementation needed to be public, but\nwhich\na user shouldn&#39;t care about. (Assuming that they can&#39;t be made\npackatge-private.)\n\nDocumenting *only* interfaces would make it possible to define the\n&quot;published\nsubset&quot; of public APIs.\n\nThere is one downside, however.\n\nI work with Javadoc, which only publishes its interfaces. Since no spec\nis\ncomplete, it requires experimentation to determine many of the\nimplementation\ndetails. JUnit is a great way to set up experiments. But since there are\nno\nclasses in the published spec, there are no constructors, so it is\nextremely\ndifficult to set up unit tests for experimentation.\n\nIt&#39;s an unexpected downside to the interface-publishing strategy.\n\n\n\n\n\n",
