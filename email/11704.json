The two <br/>\n&gt; alternatives that I see are:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 1)<br/>\n&gt; src/com.mycompany.myapp.MyClass src/test.mycompany.myapp.MyClassTest<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 2)<br/>\n&gt; src/java/com.mycompany.myapp.MyClass<br/>\n&gt; src/test/com.mycompany.myapp.MyClassTest<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The first one separates the packages so that the deployment <br/>\n&gt; is easier however there&#39;s need to import the tested classes <br/>\n&gt; within the test cases. The second one removes the problem of <br/>\n&gt; importing however, for anybody external to the application, <br/>\n&gt; the test cases suddenly make part of the final product.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Something like #1 is often used to ensure that unit tests have access only<br/>\nto the public members of the classes under test.  I suppose it would also be<br/>\neasy to separate test and production code when packaging for a release, but<br/>\nI&#39;ve used choice #2 for that.  Now, there&#39;s no harm in shipping tests with<br/>\nproduction code.  End users, especially if they&#39;re using your &quot;product&quot; to<br/>\ncreate one of their own, may appreciate very much that you include tests;<br/>\nplease consider it.<br/>\n<br/>\nCraig Demyanovich</div>",
