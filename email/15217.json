For me, it works (and runs the code!) when<br/>\n&gt;&gt;rerunning individual test method instances /that were found using<br/>\n&gt;&gt;the standard TestSuite(TestCase) constructor/.  But for dynamically<br/>\n&gt;&gt;generated test cases, it doesn&#39;t rerun them.  Looks like an Eclipse<br/>\n&gt;&gt;bug to me.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Jeff,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m a little uncomfortable calling it a bug.  Since JUnit 3 allows fully <br/>\n&gt; dynamic test tree generation, it can be undecidable in advance whether a <br/>\n&gt; given test case will even be included in the suite that is run, and more <br/>\n&gt; difficult than that to actually dynamically reconstruct the test case <br/>\n&gt; alone without running the rest of the suite.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>   That is true, but from other hand you don&#39;t really have to _run_ <br/>\ntests to see that test cases will be included into suite. Note that I <br/>\nam not talking about completely random suites and in 99.9% suite() <br/>\nmethod will return the same set od test cases. So, IDE or other test <br/>\nrunner could of kept these instances alive or even easier - recreate <br/>\nonly this instance using number of the test in the suite as a key.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Eclipse will work correctly rerunning tests on suites made up of <br/>\n&gt; TestCases and TestSuites constructed in the usual way, such as <br/>\n&gt; suite.addTestCase(MyTest.class).  This seems to be a good way to cover <br/>\n&gt; 80% of what users want.  Is there another JUnit 3 pattern so prevalent <br/>\n&gt; that addressing it would up that coverage to 90%?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>   Heh. Most of the users don&#39;t even run tests from the IDE (those run <br/>\non continuous integration server using Ant or Maven). That may quite <br/>\nchange the estimate you gave before. In any case where did you get <br/>\nsuch numbers anyways? :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; One cool thing about JUnit 4 is that while you should be able to do <br/>\n&gt; arbitrary test-creation cleverness using the @RunWith annotation, this <br/>\n&gt; is a static annotation that IDE&#39;s can easily check.  So version 17.1 of <br/>\n&gt; some IDE might be able to rerun tests run with TestClassRunner (JUnit 4 <br/>\n&gt; default) and OldTestClassRunner (JUnit 3 default), and if it turns out a <br/>\n&gt; lot of people are using Parameterized, 17.2 could add support for that.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>   It seems violating the concept of annotations. You should not <br/>\nannotate the behaviour, but rather define enough metadata that can be <br/>\nused by the tool to decide how to behave. From this point of view the <br/>\napproach Cedric choose for TestNG is less intrusive (even so I hate <br/>\nxml configs and believe that he should of provided an API for IDE <br/>\nintegration and embedding instead of generating temporary xml configs <br/>\nfrom an IDE plugins)<br/>\n<br/>\n   regards,<br/>\n   Eugene</div>",
