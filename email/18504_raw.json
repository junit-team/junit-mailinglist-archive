You can just\n&gt;&gt;use reflection to pick up all of the methods on a test case class that\n&gt;&gt;accept and return void and treat them as tests.\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;True, that.  I&#39;ve invited Steve to contribute a custom runner for\n&gt;JUnit 4 that does just that.  There&#39;s two specific problems with the\n&gt;suggestion:\n&gt;\n&gt;1) JUnit 4 allows test cases to inherit from domain classes, sometimes\n&gt;a useful trick when migrating legacy code, which would break using\n&gt;this scheme.\n&gt;2) We would then need to annotate classes, or packages, or something,\n&gt;to indicate which classes should be used as tests, to allow nifty test\n&gt;runners like ant or Eclipse to work their automagic.\n&gt;\n&gt;Neither of these is a death knell to the idea.  But I&#39;m still afraid\n&gt;of introducing &quot;punning&quot; like this by default.  As an example, Ruby&#39;s\n&gt;test::unit, by default, automatically picks up any loaded subclass of\n&gt;TestCase (wouldn&#39;t _that_ be lovely) and runs it.  But doing so makes\n&gt;the Abstract Test Case pattern unusable.\n&gt;\n&gt;So far, this is mostly justification of conservatism, so I&#39;m open to\n&gt;further opinionating.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nIt&#39;s a funny thing about this.  I guess that this could work for JUnit \nbut sometimes ideas just need a different context to shine.. .the idea \ncould be great with one set of feature but then be odd when laid along \nside another set of features.\n\n\nMichael Feathers\nmichaelfeathers.typepad.com\nwww.objectmentor.com\n\n\n",
