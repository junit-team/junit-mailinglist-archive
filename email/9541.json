To say that java (1.4) is 30 times<br/>\n&gt; slower is simply false (was true for old jdk).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I do believe that what I said was that on the particular test that I was<br/>\nrunning, Perl (_Perl_, not Java (1.4 or whatever)) was 30 times slower.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhether this was &quot;commonly accepted&quot; is irrelevant.  What matters is<br/>\nwhat happens when you run the tests.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJim Dixon  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jdd@...\">jdd@...</a>   tel +44 117 982 0786  mobile +44 797 373 7881</div>",
