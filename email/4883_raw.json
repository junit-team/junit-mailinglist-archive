There are\n&gt; two axioms that you have to use in order to make the approach\n&gt; successful:\n&gt;\n&gt; * NEVER assume anything about the internals.  Any code that uses\n&gt;   assumptions _*will*_ break.\n\nKnowing about the internals does not necessarily break the tests. Daniel\nmade the point for me in his follow up post.\n\n&gt; * USE sufficiently strong external contracts to ensure the proper\n&gt;   usage of a type of object.  The contracts should be loose enough\n&gt;   to encourage different implementation details, but strong enough\n&gt;   to be quantifiably tested.\n\nSometimes the (public) contract cannot be made sufficiently strong\nbeforehand. Especially when the objects and interfaces are in the midst of\nevolving.\n\nWell, maybe the difference of our views lies in the fact that I personally\ndo as much test-driven, i.e. test-first development as possible where the\ndesign and thus the contracts come slowly into being (and often disappear\nquickly). Martin Fowler calls that evolutionary design and I guess that I\noften don&#39;t take the time to get the contracts straight and tight enough.\n\nSince your examples are taken from Excalibur I suppose that you, Berin, are\nfollowing a component-oriented and more &quot;design-up-front&quot; development\nstrategy. It could be that this difference results in different testing\nstrategies as well.\n\nJohannes\n\n\n",
