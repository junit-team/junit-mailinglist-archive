The bad advice was the\n_categorical_ statement that comments are waste.\n\nComments which just restate what the code says might be considered\nwaste, and there is of course a tendency for comments to lag the code:\npeople often change the code without changing the accompanying\ncomments.\n\nOn the other hand, if the code embodies application-specific knowledge,\nit is usually important and often essential to explain.\n\nI had a friend who worked for a large manufacturer of sausages.  He\nwas an OR expert.  His code saved the manufacturer several million\ndollars a year by minimizing the use of ingredients.\n\nThey had a corporate reorganization.  His Sausage program was turned\nover to the DP department because, after all, it was software.  The\nDP guys couldn&#39;t figure out what it did.  So they optimized it away.\n\nWalter was well known for his incredibly precise, tight code.  It\nwas beautiful.\n\nHe was also very economical with comments.  That wasn&#39;t so wonderful\nfor those who had to decrypt the code when he wasn&#39;t there.\n\n&gt; Saying &quot;write your code in a way that it doesn&#39;t need comments&quot; is very\n&gt; good advice, on the other hand.\n\nThat I would agree with.  Although some of us do like Javadocs.\n\n&gt;                                 And in my experience you *can* learn to\n&gt; write code in a way that you very seldom need to fall back on this\n&gt; crutch.\n\nCrutch?  Name-calling helps no one.\n\nCan we return to JUnit and the thrill of unit testing?\n\n--\nJim Dixon  jdd@...   tel +44 117 982 0786  mobile +44 797 373 7881\n\n\n\n",
