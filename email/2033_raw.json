Also you can try to shorten your JNDI name (less\n&quot;/&quot; in them), because the naming service does a &quot;hop&quot; for every &quot;/&quot; in the\nbinding name. The default JDNI name for EJB that uses the fully qualified\nclass name can be pretty long.\n\nmathieu\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: tsmets@...\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSent: Tuesday, July 17, 2001 2:45 AM\nSubject: [junit] JunitPerf\n\n\nI&#39;m currently trying to make a JunitPerf to be able to monitor the\nNamingService response time (for EJB&#39;s development). As a matter of fact\nVisualAge Websphere Test environment is a real snail & lookups can take\nsometimes many seconds. My problem is the fact that the potential real issue\nis the latency in the response.\n\nI was wandering if someone could help in defining a way to avoid the\noverhead of the System.currentTimemillis() coded in the JunitPerf. On the\nproduction environment the biggest part of the response time is divided in\nthree parts - believe - :\n  1. CurrentTime access\n  2. Naming access\n  3. CurrentTime access\n\nTo reduce the influence of the timing, I can loop the Naming Access, but\nthen I get the caching kicking in.\n\nIf someone had an hint to keep the test as simple as possible (no looping on\nall the Names to access)...\n\nTx,\n\nThomas,\n\n\n",
