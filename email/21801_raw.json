I would like to &quot;hijack&quot; this ecosystem for other\n&gt; l=\r\nanguages/environments than Java. I actually did something for running\n&gt; Jav=\r\nascript tests with htmlunit and would now like to to do the same\n&gt; thing fo=\r\nr C/C++ tests: use JUnit to drive and report test executions\n&gt; that encapsu=\r\nlates native tests.\n&gt;\n&gt; I am no sure this is a good idea, but it kind of wo=\r\nrked for my JS\n&gt; tests. For the C tests, I am confronted with an issue prob=\r\nably due to\n&gt; my misunderstanding of JUnit architecture: It seems that Runn=\r\ner\n&gt; instances need Class objects to work on, being passed them by the\n&gt; fr=\r\namework. But of course, in my particular case I do not have specific\n&gt; Clas=\r\ns objects to work with as tests are written in native C/C++ code.\n&gt;\n&gt; Could=\r\n somebody point me to the right direction, or give me some good\n&gt; reasons t=\r\no forget about this ?\n\nArnaud,\n\nThere are definitely ways to do what you wa=\r\nnt.  Runner doesn&#39;t require\na Java class, it just happens that almost all o=\r\nf the provided\nsubclasses do have a Java class.\n\nHow are you planning to ru=\r\nn the overall test suite?  Depending on that\nanswer, it may work best to ha=\r\nve a &quot;stand-in&quot; Java class that serves\nas the root of your C++ suite.\n\n   D=\r\navid Saff\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks\n&gt;\n&gt; Arnaud\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
