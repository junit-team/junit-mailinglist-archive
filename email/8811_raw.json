This helps me track down the cause of\n&gt;high leve=\r\nl failures much easier. When junit detects problems and things\n&gt;fail\n&gt;I get=\r\n a (sometimes long) list of failures. Finding the &quot;root cause&quot; problem\n&gt;mea=\r\nns sifting through all the failures (including the aggregating failures)\n&gt;i=\r\nn order to find the problem, perhaps down in a low level class test. \n\nSo y=\r\nou have two main test suites.\n\n1. Object-level tests.\n2. Integration tests.=\r\n\n\nThis necessarily means that you do not have the benefit of &quot;one defect, o=\r\nne failure&quot;, since likely you always have &quot;one defect, at least two failure=\r\ns&quot;.\n\n&gt;Since\n&gt;I can&#39;t control the order of execution (it is likely package a=\r\nlphabetical\n&gt;or\n&gt;something), I can&#39;t tell what is the lowest level test. I&#39;=\r\nd like to reduce\n&gt;the effort invested here.\n\nThis is a myth. You *can* cont=\r\nrol the order of execution of test and of test suites; you simply have to m=\r\naintain suites.\n\n&gt;I was wondering if jUnit could introduce the concept of &quot;=\r\noptional test\n&gt;dependencies&quot;, test X depends upon Y -- i.e. test Y runs bef=\r\nore test X, and\n&gt;test X runs IFF test Y succeeds.\n\nThis is not something fo=\r\nr JUnit to introduce, because it is already supported. Create a TestSuite f=\r\nrom the specific tests you want to execute, and in the given order.\n\nIf you=\r\n also want the behavior of &quot;stop the presses if any test fails&quot;, then simpl=\r\ny wrap the test methods you want to call in one big test method called &quot;myL=\r\nongTest&quot; and run that one test method.\n\n&gt;I wouldn&#39;t want to do this for eve=\r\nry test, and it ought be user optional,\n&gt;but I could see it as being a big =\r\nbenefit.\n\nYou can maintain a list of tests and run them as necessary. Simpl=\r\ne.\n\n&gt;P.S. The Eclipse junit plugin that search projects to find all tests, =\r\nfind\n&gt;tests in dependant project, but doesn&#39;t run them &quot;in the CWD of that\n=\r\n&gt;project&quot; (which matters for some tests).\n\nIt shouldn&#39;t. It is best to writ=\r\ne your tests so that it doesn&#39;t. Or your production code; whichever. Pass t=\r\nhe desired working directory into the tests as a JVM parameter or something=\r\n.\n\nTake care.\n\n\nJ. B.
