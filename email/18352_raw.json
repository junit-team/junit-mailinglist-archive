The original class GetInfo.java has a method. \n&gt;            String getSystemVersion(String str) which is under test. This method is supplied\n&gt;            with path variable in form of string from where it reads a xml file to get certain \n&gt;            data and return back to the user.   \n&gt; \n&gt; The point of confussion for me is to how to test the method. What should be the actual \n&gt; and expected result. Meaning for getting the expected result I will have to use the\n&gt; same logic as it is in the main code, if I use the same logic to read the xml file \n&gt; then the assert statement would not be meaningful as then the expected and \n&gt; actual results would be same.     \n\nCan you not have a couple of XML files [1] with known answers and check\nthat reading those files gets you the answers you expect?\n\n[1] Which you might construct in a scratch area, although you might\n    also consider having getSystemVersion also have a variant that\n    takes a stream content rather than a pathname.\n\n-- \nChris &quot;hantwig efferko VOOM!&quot; Dollin\nThe &quot;good old days&quot; used to be much better.\n\n",
