Or are we really only interested in the result\n&gt;  of the main method we&#39;re testing?\n\nIt depends on what your strategy is. I&#39;d advice against &quot;navigating&quot;\nwith mocks (in order to test this branch mockA.someFlag() needs to\nreturn 4711 and then it will go through this loop two times before so\nmockA.hasNext() must return true twice and then false. After that we\nsetup expectations on MockB and those are the ones we /really/ care\nabout).\n\nBasically, if you are /navigating/ to something that you care about.\nSee if you can structure your code so that you don&#39;t have to navigate.\nCan you extract that chunk of logic to a separate method or class. Do\nyou lack an abstraction?\n\nIt is certainly not wrong to leave mocks out entirely. Lots of really\ngood TDD:ers do that so it&#39;s nothing to feel embarrassed about. I\npersonally think that mocks are handy since it gets painful so quickly\nwhen you&#39;re on the wrong track but that is just me.\n\nI like this story about a team evolving:\nhttp://igorstoyanov.blogspot.com/2005/10/stubs-or-mocks-state-or-behavior_30.html\n\nMaybe a team has to go through that evolution? Maybe your team evolves\ndifferently? The important thing is to keep looking for and\nimplementing improvements.\n\n/J\n\n",
