B. Rainsberger wrote:\n\n&gt; If you have a failing test, but you aren&#39;t sure why it fails, and you \n&gt; suspect the problem is in a private method, what do you generally do?\n\nIf I have a failing test that fails because an exception is thrown out \nof a private method, I debug it. First off I eyeball the code both in \nthe private method and the public method being tested. Most of the time \nthe reason for the failure is obvious. If it&#39;s not, I&#39;ll generally set a \nbreakpoint or two and step through the code in the debugger and watch \nwhat actually happens. This is a lot more productive than guessing at \nwhat the problem might be. If I could guess right, then I wouldn&#39;t need \nto step through it.\n\nIt used to be common in quality code to do a code review by stepping \nthrough the entire program in a debugger. This tended to reveal a lot of \nsurprises about how the code was really working. This technique has \nfallen out of favor as applications grew larger. It&#39;s really impractical \ntoday. However, when something is going wrong in a known piece of code \nnothing beats single stepping through it in a debugger. This almost \nalways points me to the exact statement where what I think the code is \ndoing diverges from what the code is actually doing.\n\nThis requires that the bug is consistently reproducible and I have a \ntest that reproduces it. However, once I&#39;ve got that I&#39;m good to go. \nWriting hypothetical tests for what I think the bug might be only works \nif the bug is so obvious that I can eyeball it in the first place. The \ntricky bugs are the ones where everything looks like it should work and \nI can&#39;t see why it doesn&#39;t. That&#39;s when I need to isolate the problem \nmore closely than a test method can. I need to find out which statement \nis failing, not which method is failing. I already know the answer to \nthe latter question.\n\nIf the bug proves to be deep inside another piece of code, then I might \nlater add a second test that aims more closely at the bug. However, \nthat&#39;s only done after I&#39;ve identified the bug, and often I don&#39;t even \nbother to do that. After all, there&#39;s already at least one test for the \nissue.\n\n-- \n﻿Elliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nXML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim\n\n",
