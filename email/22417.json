We are still build them up...<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Feb 13, 2010, at 4:28 PM, krosenvold wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the thing you&#39;re missing is that maven surefire 2.5 works with JUST junit 4.7+ or a *combination* of junit 4.7+ /and/ ConfigurableParallelComputer.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen using surefire with junit /alone/ it does not support threadCount. You will need to use the /combination/ to restrict threadCount. Since you&#39;re a selenium user you WILL need to limit threads, which means you *cannot* get by with just junit 4.7+, but you *will* need ConfigurableParallelComputer.<br/>\n<br/>\nI will update the surefire docs to be a bit clearer on this restriction.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know at least three selenium projects that are doing exactly what you want. Most run with parallel=classes and a thread restriction, since this allows a smooth number of concurrent tests, something that is good for your grid. My current firefox runs went from 45 minutes single thread to 8 minutes concurrent, so there&#39;s definitely a huge upside.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis does not mean it&#39;s a simple task, since most selenium test suites are not written with concurrency support in mind. Quite frankly, if you think getting surefire/junit to work is hard you can rest assured that the worst part is still ahead of you.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>",
