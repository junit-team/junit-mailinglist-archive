My \nco=\r\nncern is that I can&#39;t figure out a good way to write these tests \nwithout r=\r\nelying on other DAO methods.\n\nFor example, my employeeDAO might have a crea=\r\nteEmployee(Employee \nemployee) method and a getEmployeeById(Integer id) met=\r\nhod.  Almost \nall of my tests rely on a employee record being pre-populated=\r\n.  For \nnow, I&#39;m calling my createEmployee DAO method in setup() so every \n=\r\ntest has it.  Then I call the deleteEmployee(Employee employee) \nmethod in =\r\ntearDown().  It bothers me somewhat to have to do this as \nI would prefer t=\r\no only call those methods within their corresponding \ntest methods.  \n\nI&#39;ve=\r\n looked at DBUnit.  The problem here is that I still have to \npopulate my b=\r\nean from the database - then I&#39;m back to calling a DAO \nmethod like getEmpl=\r\noyeeById in every method - an undesirable \ndependency.  Another option I gu=\r\ness would be to have some DAO \nmethods used only for testing but this seems=\r\n overkill.  I&#39;d rather \nuse the database during testing too, not mock objec=\r\nts.\n\nSo, I guess my questions are:\n\n1.)Is there a good way to test DAOs in =\r\nisolation, without relying on \nother DAO methods?\n2.)Does it really matter =\r\nthat much anyway if I use other DAO \nmethods?  I mean, the goal is for ALL =\r\ntests to pass anyway.  It can \nbe confusing if your testDeleteEmployee meth=\r\nod fails due to a \nfailure in createEmployee which you have to call first, =\r\nbut I guess \nit wouldn&#39;t take long to figure out what really happened.\n\nAny=\r\n feedback would be appreciated.\nThanks,\nMike\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nYahoo!
