You can use this as an early clue\n&gt; that whatever you broke is a case that is actually under test.\n\nI would agree. I spend a lot of time in my unit tests writing the structure:\n\npublic void testWhatever() {\n   setup_stuff_here();\n   more_setup_stuff_here();\n   try {\n      method_under_test();\n   } catch(Exception e) {\n      fail(e.getMessage());\n   }\n}\n\nbecause an error indicates an exception thrown by functionality NOT under\ntest. An exception thrown by functionality that IS under test is properly\nreported as a failure (the implicit assertion is that there will be no\nexception thrown).\n\nIt would be more expressive to simply be able to call fail(e), and would\nmake more semantic information available to test run environments that could\nmake use of it.\n\n- John\n\n\n",
