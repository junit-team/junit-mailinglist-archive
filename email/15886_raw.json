It also encourages developers to\nproduce fully working, integr=\r\nated and unit tested code from day one.\n\nSo I&#39;m not sure where your impress=\r\nion is coming from; to me it doesn&#39;t sound\nlike a team where that can happe=\r\nn really has groked Agile software\ndevelopment.\n\n\n&gt; In my experience the pr=\r\noject managers\n&gt; for sprints do not understand the need for engineering spe=\r\ncs,\n&gt; hence they do not exist, or if they do they are after the\n&gt; fact.\n\nI&#39;=\r\nm not sure what you mean by &quot;engineering specs&quot;, but I also don&#39;t\nunderstan=\r\nd why the project manager has to understand their need for them to\nbe produ=\r\nced at the right time. It&#39;s the responsibility of the team to\nproduce what =\r\nis needed when it&#39;s needed.\n\n&gt; There is no time in the plan for rework of b=\r\nad code.\n\nIf you need time in the plan for rework, you are not doing enough=\r\n of it.\nRefactoring, as we call reworking code in small very controlled ste=\r\nps,\nshould be part of the developers minute-to-minute work. They should be =\r\ndoing\nso much of it, so tightly intermingled with the rest of their work, t=\r\nhat\nit&#39;s impossible to measure how much of their time they are spending doi=\r\nng\nit.\n\n&gt; There is no time in the sprint for rigorous QA.\n\nQA should be an =\r\nongoing effort during the sprint, parallel to the rest of\nthe work. If ther=\r\ne is &quot;no time&quot; for this, the team really is not a truly\nAgile one.\n\n&gt; This =\r\nleads to quantity not quality.\n\nAgreed. But it has nothing to do with Agili=\r\nty.\n\n&gt; Remember that satellite that crashed in the\n&gt; planet Mars because di=\r\nfferent methods of measuring speed were\n&gt; used. Effective integration testi=\r\nng would have caught that problem.\n\nAs would have better communication and =\r\ncollaboration. That hardly was an\nAgile project, was it? ;)\n \nCheers, Ilja\n=\r\n\n\n",
