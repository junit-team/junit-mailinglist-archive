Nor will it make JUnit any more difficult to understand. But it wil=\r\nl enable new JUnit users to have more utilities at their fingertips. I thin=\r\nk that most users are confused initially when they come to JUnit because it=\r\n doesn&#39;t do a whole lot. Personally, I don&#39;t care a whole lot for my own us=\r\ne, but I think that adding some more utilities to JUnit will enhance it&#39;s o=\r\nut-of-the-box usability. The power users will eventually get under the hood=\r\n and make extensions where it suits them.\n\nWhat&#39;s confusing to me about the=\r\n assert class is that it only goes part of the way. It provides a bunch of =\r\nassertions but then an arbitrary line in the sand has been drawn to say tha=\r\nt these are all that anyone should need. This is confusing. I would rather =\r\nsee the Assert class simplified down to only one method: assertTrue. This w=\r\nould then beg for the extensibility you describe and the framework would at=\r\n least be consistent. Otherwise, we should recognise the Assert class as a =\r\nutility for programmers and load it up. You don&#39;t have to the methods there=\r\n if you don&#39;t want to.\n\nChris\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Shane Celis=\r\n \nSent: Friday, April 05, 2002 2:03 PM\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: R=\r\ne: [junit] assertContains? -&gt; junit development question?\n\n\nI have to disag=\r\nree.  I like the fact that the JUnit framework is itself \nsmall, easy to co=\r\nmprehend, therefore making it easy to extend.  One \nthing that perturbs me =\r\nabout the Assert class is the fact that it&#39;s \nstatic.  If I want to overrid=\r\ne assertTrue() globally, for instance to \nprovide more verbose output, or t=\r\no change it&#39;s behavior so that a \nfailure won&#39;t result in an exception bein=\r\ng thrown thereby discontinuing \nthe rest of the test, I have to edit the JU=\r\nnit Assert class itself.  If \nAssert were an instance class I could avoid t=\r\nhis, and easily add the \nassert extensions that everyone is asking for.\n\nI =\r\ndo believe that they should be extensions to JUnit, without bloating \nthe o=\r\nriginal Assert class.\n\n-shane\n\np.s.  Yes, I could make my own base TestCase=\r\n class, but this doesn&#39;t \nwork retroactively, and certainly isn&#39;t a solutio=\r\nn I would want to \nfoster for Assert Extension classes.\n\nOn Friday, April 5=\r\n, 2002, at 11:42  AM, Chris Eppstein wrote:\n\n&gt; So your argument is that we =\r\nreally don&#39;t need anything other than \n&gt; assertTrue? I&#39;d have to disagree.\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; JUnit is a TESTING FRAMEWORK. By using it, testing should be made \n&gt; ea=\r\nsier. I&#39;d like to not have to reinvent the wheel for many of these \n&gt; asser=\r\ntions. I understand that I can easily write my own assertion \n&gt; library in =\r\njust a couple hours but why should I have to? Certainly, \n&gt; after years of =\r\nuse, we have identified many assertions that would be \n&gt; useful to the comm=\r\nunity at large. As they are identified, it seems \n&gt; natural for JUnit to pr=\r\novide them in future releases.\n&gt;\n&gt; -Chris\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; -----Original Message----=\r\n-\n&gt; From: J. B.

I now =\r\nbelieve it&#39;s cleaner \n&gt; simply\n&gt; to build a lot of custom methods answering=\r\n boolean, then using \n&gt; assertTrue() and\n&gt; assertFalse(). What changes in y=\r\nour example is the condition, and not \n&gt; the\n&gt; assertion mechanism.\n&gt;\n&gt; You=\r\n create your own abstract TestCase class with your custom \n&gt; boolean-logic\n=\r\n&gt; methods.\n&gt;\n&gt; public abstract class MyTestCase extends TestCase {\n&gt;     pu=\r\nblic static boolean containsText(final String string, final String\n&gt; patter=\r\nn) {\n&gt;         return string.indexOf(pattern) &gt;=3D 0;\n&gt;     }\n&gt;     ...\n&gt; }=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; ...\n&gt;\n&gt; public class SomeTest extends MyTestCase {\n&gt;     public void t=\r\nestSomething() {\n&gt;         assertTrue(containsText(&quot;Hello&quot;, &quot;el&quot;));\n&gt;     }=\r\n\n&gt; }\n&gt;\n&gt; ...\n&gt;\n&gt; Of course, after enough of this, your code starts to look =\r\nlike \n&gt; procedural\n&gt; programming code, because what you REALLY want is to e=\r\nxtend String, \n&gt; which you\n&gt; can&#39;t do. If you really want to, you can wrap =\r\nString and provide the \n&gt; extra\n&gt; methods.\n&gt;\n&gt; public class MyString {\n&gt;   =\r\n  private final String string;\n&gt;\n&gt;     public MyString(final String aString=\r\n) {\n&gt;         string =3D aString;\n&gt;     }\n&gt;\n&gt;     public boolean contains(f=\r\ninal String pattern) {\n&gt;         return string.indexOf(pattern) &gt;=3D 0;\n&gt;  =\r\n   }\n&gt;\n&gt;     public boolean matchesRegex(final String regex) {\n&gt;         //=\r\n ORO magic...\n&gt;     }\n&gt; }\n&gt;\n&gt; It&#39;s cleaner in one respect and uglier in ano=\r\nther.\n&gt;\n&gt; J.
