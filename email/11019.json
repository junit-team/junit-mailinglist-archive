When I use the eclipse <br/>\nplugin to run the test, it seems to be working just fine. But when I <br/>\nuse the ANT, it says the BUILD failed and it does not execute the <br/>\nThread.sleep line in one of the tests. Does anyone know why is it <br/>\ndoing that? Any help on this matter would be really appreciated.<br/>\nThanks in advance!<br/>\nAbhishek</div>",
