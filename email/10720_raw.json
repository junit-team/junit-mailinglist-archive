At the end of all the tests, I print the \nassert count too. Ofcourse this a non-standard way..\n\nIt would be better, if JUnit new versions have assertXXXX method call \ncount too.printed at the end of test cycle.\n\nRegards,\nNagendra\n\njavayang@... wrote:\n\n&gt; Howdy folks,\n&gt;\n&gt; I have a test method that iteratres through a String array performing\n&gt; assert checks.  The problem I have is on the first failure, the tests\n&gt; discontinues and the rest of the array is not checked.  This makes\n&gt; sense because of the exception that is thrown and handled by JUNIT. \n&gt; Is there a away I can keep the loop running until it finishes all the\n&gt; strings.  I can catch the exception but how do I add it to the\n&gt; current aggregate test results that JUNIT is keeping track of.  Also,\n&gt; is this the best way or proper way to do this?  I don&#39;t think it\n&gt; makes very much sense to write a test method for each string in the\n&gt; arry, it wouldn&#39;t be very scalable or dynamic.
