By\ndebugging my code I noticed that JUnit calls the static initializers\nof my classes on the second run again, even if I deselect &quot;Reload\nclasses every run&quot;.\n \nFrom this I guess that JUnit throws away the class code and all\nassociated objects on the heap after the first run, no matter what\n&quot;Reload classes every run&quot; says. I guess this is related to the class\nloader, but I could not find a workaround.\n \nAm I missing something? If not, is this a bug or a feature?\n \nIn my opinion an application should not be able to throw away objects\nwithout providing some means to do cleanup, e.g. by calling finalize()\nor offering some other sort of shutdown hook.\n \nWith best regards,\nChristian Schlichtherle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
