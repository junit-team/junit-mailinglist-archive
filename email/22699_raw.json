From the\n&gt; design perspe=\r\nctive, why have a whole Runner just for filtering by\n&gt; category?  There are=\r\n other things you can filter on.  And, there were\n&gt; some definitely hackish=\r\n parts of the implementation.  And, it turns\n&gt; out, there were bugs in Cate=\r\ngories, (such as\n&gt; http://github.com/KentBeck/junit/issues#issue/74) that w=\r\nere very hard\n&gt; to elegantly fix with the current design.  And, (sorry, mav=\r\nen\n&gt; hopefuls), but we were anxious to get back into the meat of the code.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; So, the first 4.9 snapshot is up today, with a new way of specifying\n&gt;=\r\n suites, called SuiteBuilder.  SuiteBuilder allows for flexible\n&gt; specifica=\r\ntion of where to find the classes containing tests, and how\n&gt; to filter the=\r\n resulting runners.\n&gt; \n&gt; This suite class lists the explicit test classes t=\r\no consider running,\n&gt; and then filters it down to only those tests or class=\r\nes annotated with\n&gt; `@Category(Yes.class)`:\n&gt; \n&gt; \t@RunWith(SuiteBuilder.cla=\r\nss)\n&gt; \tpublic static class OnlyYes {\n&gt; \t\t@Classes\n&gt; \t\tpublic Listed classes=\r\n=3D new Listed(Yes1.class, Yes2.class, No1.class);\n&gt; \n&gt; \t\t@RunnerFilter\n&gt; \t=\r\n\tpublic CategoryFilter filter=3D CategoryFilter.include(Yes.class);\n&gt; \t}\n&gt; =\r\n\t\n&gt; We hope to soon include other implementations for the @Classes\n&gt; annota=\r\ntion, including a classpath-searching test gatherer.  Other\n&gt; implementatio=\r\nns for @RunnerFilter also make sense (if you look close,\n&gt; you&#39;ll see that =\r\nRunnerFilter implementations can also re-order\n&gt; runners, as well as select=\r\ning them).\n&gt; \n&gt; Please have fun, and let us know how it works for you.
