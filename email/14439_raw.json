Is there a way to get\n&gt; around this issue? More specifically; is it possible to execute all\n&gt; assertions in a test function despite some have failed.\n&gt; \n&gt; I attempted using JFunc, but it is slightly incomplete. Other than\n&gt; this extension, I have had little luck finding anything else.\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers!\n&gt; -Raffie-\n\nA long time ago, put in almost the same situation (having multiple assertions with different results \non same test) I have patched the Assert class behavior in the following way:\n- first things in the test method you set the behavior of the assertion (fail on assert, continue on \nfailed assertion, defaulting to JUnit general behavior)\n- with the 2nd type of behavior having all the failures reported at the end of the method\n\nThe only thing I have missed at that point was that the total numbers where screwed :-).\n\nI will not dive into the discussion if this was bad or good, cause I cannot remember the whole \nthing. All I remember is what I have done :-).\n\ntake care,\n:alex |.::the_mindstorm::.|\n\n",
