B. Rainsberger wrote:\n\n&gt; &gt; But it&#39;s really just using summaryString as a testing utility.  I&#39;d be\n&gt; &gt; tempted to write this instead, which feels clearer:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; assertThat(states, summarizeTo(&quot;GREEN 0.0 GREEN 0.5 RED 1.0&quot;))\n&gt;\n&gt; The problem with this is that you lose the context of the &quot;states&quot;\n&gt; object in the method &quot;summarizeTo&quot;. Generalizing this looks bad, as it\n&gt; resorts to the kind of reflection you showed next:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Constraint summarizeTo(String summary) {\n&gt; &gt;     return applyTo(eq(summary), callMethod(&quot;summaryString&quot;));\n&gt; &gt; }\n&gt;\n&gt; callMethod on which object? Bang, you&#39;re dead. :)\n\nNot again.  :)\n\nJust to clarify, callMethod could be written with exactly the semantics \nneeded above.  I believe that your point was that clarity has been shot \ndead, since not many people want to reason about higher-order functions \nrather than string equality when doing testing.  Very true.  This is \nwhat I get for choosing the first example at hand.\n\nHowever, thinking harder about constraints was helpful for me.  The aha \nfor me is that writing a new constraint has value whenever it allows the \nframework to get its hands on a whole value that it otherwise wouldn&#39;t \nhave.  This is why I actually rarely write\n\nassertThat(x, eq(&quot;Target string&quot;));\n\n(I did in the first month or so after learning JMock.  Martin Fowler: \n&quot;Often when you come across something new it can be a good idea to \noveruse it in order to find out it&#39;s [sic] boundaries.&quot;)\n\nassertEquals(&quot;Target string&quot;, x);\n\nmeans exactly the same thing, doesn&#39;t freak non-JMock maintainers, and \nproduces an error string that Eclipse can parse nicely for me.\n\nHowever,\n\nassertTrue(x &lt; 100)\n\nis much more troublesome.  The framework never gets its hands on the \nactual value of x, so all you get is &quot;assertion failed&quot; (or in Ruby, \n&quot;&lt;false&gt; is not &lt;true&gt;&quot;.  I love that.).  Instead,\n\nassertThat(x, lessThan(100))\n\nexposes the actual value of x to the framework, and now you get an \ninformative failure message for free.  All this is to say that \nsummarizeTo was a bad place to write a constraint. \n\n&gt; So...\n&gt;\n&gt;      assertThat(states.summary(), eq(new Summary(0, 0.5, 1));\n&gt;\n&gt; would be my choice.\n\nMine is\n\nassertThat(states.summary(), eq(new Summary(&quot;GREEN 0.0 GREEN 0.5 RED 1.0&quot;)))\n\n    David Saff\n\n",
