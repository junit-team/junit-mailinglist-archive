I would like to &quot;hijack&quot; this ecosystem for other\nlanguages/environments than Java. I actually did something for running\nJavascript tests with htmlunit and would now like to to do the same\nthing for C/C++ tests: use JUnit to drive and report test executions\nthat encapsulates native tests.\n\nI am no sure this is a good idea, but it kind of worked for my JS\ntests. For the C tests, I am confronted with an issue probably due to\nmy misunderstanding of JUnit architecture: It seems that Runner\ninstances need Class objects to work on, being passed them by the\nframework. But of course, in my particular case I do not have specific\nClass objects to work with as tests are written in native C/C++ code.\n\nCould somebody point me to the right direction, or give me some good\nreasons to forget about this ?\n\nThanks\n\nArnaud\n\n",
