Those are,<br/>\n&gt; after all, the ones which you might otherwise break, and for which<br/>\n&gt; unit tests will add most value.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s tempting to start with &quot;easy&quot; ones, but you run the risk of writing<br/>\n&gt; tests for things that won&#39;t change and won&#39;t break, and you&#39;d gain an<br/>\n&gt; unrealistic view of how easy it is(n&#39;t) to add tests post-hoc.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, actually writing JUnit tests is just another development<br/>\ntask/cycle you must put efforts in to explore bugs at unit-level,<br/>\nisn&#39;t it. Perhaps the TDD methodology mixes these two development<br/>\ncycles nattily...<br/>\n<br/>\nIt would be interesting to see a statistics how many bugs an<br/>\nOO-project has at unit-level and how many at integration-level (during<br/>\ncooperation of objects).<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks Chris,<br/>\n csaba</div>",
