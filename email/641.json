I have a bookmark to the JavaDoc, but the online <br/>\nversion appears to document JUnit 3.2.  Is someone maintaining a <br/>\npublic site with the latest JavaDoc (SourceForge doesn&#39;t have <br/>\nanything in the docs section)?<br/>\n<br/>\nJUnit 3.5 seems to have introduced the &quot;-noloader&quot; flag to the <br/>\ntestrunners, causing me much grief until I learned how to turn off <br/>\nthe default class loader.  Where would I go to learn about such <br/>\nthings without having to grep through the JUnit source code?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks (a mostly satisfied customer :)<br/>\n<br/>\n_chas_</div>",
