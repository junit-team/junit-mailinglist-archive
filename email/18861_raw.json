These seem to be set up\naccording to 4.0 style, since they use @Test attributes and do not\ninherit from TestCase. I can run these cases using the &quot;run junit\ntest&quot; in the context menu.\nHowever, I&#39;m having problems to bundle these cases in a testsuite.\n\nI have tried to setup a testsuite using the eclipse dialog &quot;new\nJunit Test Suite&quot;, but adding my tests to the suite in the dialog\nwas impossible since the textbox where I was supposed to select\nmy tests would not be populated.\n\nSo I generated an empty suite and tried to use\naddTestSuite(MyTest.class), which would not work... I guess this\nis because it is part of the 3.8 framework.\n\n\nMy question is hence. How am I supposed to bundle my Tests together\nin general using the 4.0 way of doing things, and how can I do that\neffectively using Eclipse?\nAm I running into an eclipse problem or do I just not understand how\nthe new framework is supposed to be used?\n\nany comments and pointers to up to date documentation would be very\nmuch appreciated!\n\nthanks!\nTimo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
