If you&#39;re not sure which will come back\nwhen you run the test, then you&#39;re test is not really useful.\n\nI would propose that you need at least two tests:\n\n1) Set up the DAO so that it returns an expected &#39;null&#39;, and then\nassertNull to check it.\n2) Set up the DAO so that it returns an expected number of records,\nand then check that exactly that number is returned\n(assertEquals(list.size(), n), where n is the expected number of\nrecords).\n\nBoth of these tests either require you to put the database that the\nDAO talks to in a known state, or to decouple the DAO from an actual\ndatabase.  You might also think about returning an empty List in the\ncase that you have zero records to remove the need for &#39;null&#39; checks\nin your code.\n\nHope that helps,\n- Bill\n\n-- \nBill Woodward wpwood@... http://www.saifa.net\n\n&quot;I have more trouble with D.
