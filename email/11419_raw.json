B. Rainsberger&quot; &lt;jbrains@r...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; ericheikkila wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Hmmm....sounds like you&#39;re trying to over-engineer the problem.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Why not have a unit test for the database connection.  If that\n&gt; &gt; fails, then all your database dependant tests fail, you know that\n&gt; &gt; the connection could not be established due to the DB connection\n&gt; &gt; test.  The fact that the other tests fail as a side effect is\n&gt; &gt; somewhat irrelevant.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The other suggestion I saw about doing asserts in setup could be\n&gt; &gt; used, too.  Or, something I currently do (an idea blatantly \nstolen\n&gt; &gt; from my co-workers), if testing some pre-existing condition is to\n&gt; &gt; simply notate:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; assertEquals(&quot;Test setup: This should be zero initially&quot;, 0,\n&gt; &gt; someClass.Value());\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Then if a &#39;test setup&#39; assert is thrown, you know that there was\n&gt; &gt; something wrong before you even made it to the asserts you were\n&gt; &gt; really testing.  Very useful, simple, and doesn&#39;t require some \ngrand\n&gt; &gt; mechanism.\n&gt; \n&gt; When you write three of those, you have duplication in the failure \n&gt; message. Wouldn&#39;t you like to refactor that?\n&gt; -- \n&gt; J. B.
