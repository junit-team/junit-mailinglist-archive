I would like an<br/>\n&gt; &gt; error/failure in testMoneyEquals() to show *first* in the output. How to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; implement this? The test writer could somehow specify a &quot;level&quot; for each<br/>\n&gt; &gt; test (basic, mid, complex). That could be totally optionnal and thus not<br/>\n&gt; &gt; change the current API. That would be *just a hint* from the test writer to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the person running the tests saying &quot;hey, look there first&quot;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve been relying upon the undocumented behavior in JUnit&#39;s reflection support.<br/>\n&gt; Reflection seems to return methods based on their order within the class file,<br/>\n&gt; and JUnit&#39;s Result stores failures in a vector.  Vector&#39;s elements() method<br/>\n&gt; is documented as returning the contents in vector order.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So, basically, I write my tests in order, simplest first, most complex last,<br/>\n&gt; and it comes out in the right order if I use have JUnit use reflection to<br/>\n&gt; identify the test methods.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Naturally, if Kent or Erich change the Result class, I&#39;m hosed.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I like the idea of test cases classified by their complexity and<br/>\ndefinitely it is not good to rely on some undocumented features,<br/>\nthus I would appreciate some support in JUnit framework.<br/>\n<br/>\nMorover ordering test functions by their complexity restricts<br/>\nyou to the class boundaries. Suite, generally, can include tests<br/>\nfrom several classes and then it would be nice to have *basic*<br/>\ntests from all classes grouped together.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; If you wanted to do this &quot;right&quot;, you could extend TestRunner and replace<br/>\n&gt; printFailures() with a version which sorts the enumeration based on whatever<br/>\n&gt; criteria you like.  Method name comes to mind as something easy to use.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Personnally I&#39;m not even sure it&#39;s worth it, but I wanted to share that idea<br/>\n&gt; &gt; with people on the list.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Oh, I think it&#39;s worth it.  The last time I brought it up I got flamed. :p<br/>\n&gt; I hope you fare better than I did.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Now maybe some core XP funs will curicify me, but I see<br/>\nit useful to have a possibility to define dependencies between<br/>\nthose above metnioned groups of tests with the same complexity level.<br/>\nI like the TestRunner which will skip more complex tests, when<br/>\nsome basic tests fail. Note, that for testing some large products<br/>\nthe test can take 1 hour or more. Why should I wait for<br/>\nsuch a long time just to know that some basic test failed and<br/>\nthus all others depending on it failed too.<br/>\n<br/>\nVita<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; Joi Ellis                    Software Engineer<br/>\n&gt; Aravox Technologies          <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:joi@...\">joi@...</a>, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:gyles19@...\">gyles19@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; No matter what we think of Linux versus FreeBSD, etc., the one thing I<br/>\n&gt; really like about Linux is that it has Microsoft worried.
