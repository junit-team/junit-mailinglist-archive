You&#39;ll get differences between them if the =\r\nrunning times of tests are different but the serious differences should be =\r\nobvious.\n&gt; \n&gt; Are you going to asses the differences visually or is this go=\r\ning to be in a script; if the latter, the problem is more interesting (i.e.=\r\n harder).\n&gt; \n&gt; Hope this helps\n&gt; \n&gt; jim\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In junit@yahoogroups.com, =\r\n&quot;rohitkulkarni15&quot; &lt;rohitkulkarni15@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Currently,=\r\n I have a requirement of comparing results of two JUnit reports(with same s=\r\net of tests).\n&gt; &gt; The result of this comparison activity should be to gener=\r\nate a diff report that mentions only those tests whose status is different =\r\nas compared to the 1st result\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; i.e. If i have report A and report B=\r\n, how to get the list of differences between these two reports.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Ca=\r\nn someone please guide me on how to do this?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thanks,\n&gt; &gt; Rohit\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt;\n\n\n\n",
