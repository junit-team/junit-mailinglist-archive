I can&#39;t write assertThat(someString).isMyMothersMaidenName(),=\r\n for example.\n\nIf your mother&#39;s maiden name is an important concept in the =\r\ndomain,\nit&#39;s probably already expressed (or should be?) as a method on some=\r\n\nobject, perhaps Name, which allows:\n\nassertThat(Name.fromString(someString=\r\n)).isMyMothersMaidenName();\n\nFor absolutely free, _if_ you don&#39;t finalize N=\r\name.  I think that it\nintensifies some of the better aspects of TDD design =\r\n(&quot;That assertion\nwould be easier to debug if I had a method called\nisMyMoth=\r\nersMaidenName()&quot;);\n\nWith current hamcrest, you have to Repeat Yourself, by =\r\nwriting both\nName.isMyMothersMaidenName and Matchers.isMyMothersMaidenName.=\r\n\n\n&gt; I&#39;d like to see some middle-ground between the two. =A0Maybe a factory =\r\nfunction can use reflection to create a matcher that is then passed as a pa=\r\nrameter to assertThat. =A0I think this is how the logicalpractice-collectio=\r\nns library works.\n\nI see the single-arg assertThat as sugar on top of exact=\r\nly that\nimplementation, so the following would be equivalent:\n\nassertThat(l=\r\nist).isEmpty();\nassertThat(list, theAforementioned(List.class).isEmpty());\n=\r\n\nYes, some serious work needs to be done on naming on the second line,\nbut =\r\nhopefully the idea is clear.\n\n   David Saff\n\n",
