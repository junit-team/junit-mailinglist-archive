The semantics of using a constructor also seem far more<br/>\n&gt; obvious to me as everyone reading my code knows Java, while not<br/>\n&gt; everyone is a JUnit guru.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The additional complexity of having the (as far as I can tell)<br/>\n&gt; redundant setUp method seems counterproductive, so why does setUp exist?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I find that &quot;setUp()&quot; reveals intent pretty well. Some people have <br/>\ndifficulty with the idea of storing fixture objects in fields, as they <br/>\nincorrectly think that they can write to those fields from one test and <br/>\nread those values from the next test. For this reason, I find that when <br/>\nI explain how to refactor code out of tests into the setUp() method, <br/>\npeople understand the concepts more easily.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s also worth noting that in NUnit, for example, test case instances <br/>\nare pooled, so initializing in the constructor does not behave as you <br/>\nmight expect. There&#39;s nothing in the contract of the JUnit test case <br/>\nthat guarantees that instances are not pooled, so JUnit 5.0, for <br/>\nexample, could decide to pool instances of test case. At that point, <br/>\nyou&#39;d have to change your code.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope that sheds some light on the matter.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
