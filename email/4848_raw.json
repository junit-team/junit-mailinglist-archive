(LNG-MBC)&quot; \n&gt;&gt;&lt;timothy.j.stevens@...&gt;:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; \tCan&#39;t break!!?? You never make typos and return the \n&gt;&gt;wrong variable\n&gt;&gt;&gt; in a getter, or set the wrong variable in a setter? If so, you&#39;re a\n&gt;&gt;&gt; better\n&gt;&gt;&gt; coder than me :)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;I hope this was tongue-in-cheek. I don&#39;t think I have *ever* \n&gt;&gt;returned the wrong \n&gt;&gt;variable from a getX() method[1]. In order to make this \n&gt;&gt;mistake, I&#39;d have to be \n&gt;&gt;drunk. As for setting the wrong variable in a setX() method, \n&gt;&gt;see my previous \n&gt;&gt;message. I&#39;ve made that mistake exactly once.\n&gt;\n&gt;That&#39;s wonderful. I have made this mistake greater than one times (and\nI\n&gt;wasn&#39;t drunk! :-)\n\nHonestly, that surprises me.\n\n&gt;&gt;Folks, don&#39;t test the getX() and setX() methods; but rather \n&gt;&gt;test that the \n&gt;&gt;constructor stores the appropriate parameter in the \n&gt;&gt;appropriate field. I know \n&gt;\n&gt;But isn&#39;t this what testing the setter and getter is doing??\n\nNo. In the case of a Java Bean, there is a no-arg constructor. Do you\nreally need a unit test to verify that &quot;this.value = value&quot; and &quot;return\nvalue&quot; work? If you feel you do, then keep writing those tests. I think\nit&#39;s overkill.\n\n&gt; While I am in\n&gt;the minority here, I am testing my accessors and I am intending to\n&gt;continue testing my accessors. I have no desire to change your\nbehaviour,\n&gt;but there are other people out there who are going to read this and\nask\n&gt;themselves whether they are wrong or paranoid to be testing getters\nand\n&gt;setters.\n\nI will never say &quot;wrong&quot;. The philosophy is simple: test everything\nthat you want to work. It&#39;s just that there&#39;s little ROI on testing\nmethods that do nothing more than change the value of a variable or\nanswer the value of a variable. I would only do it if I was having a\nbad day, unsure of my concentration level or had just made a mistake\nwith a method that simple.\n\n&gt; To these people, I say &quot;Test away!&quot; I have found it useful to\n&gt;test everything that I can. You do not find it useful, so don&#39;t test\nwhat\n&gt;you are certain cannot break.\n\nAgreed.\n\n&gt;&gt;I&#39;m about 100 times more likely to write a bug there than in \n&gt;&gt;the getX() or setX\n&gt;&gt;() method itself.\n&gt;\n&gt;That&#39;s your personal situation. Some of us still make that mistake.\n&gt;\n&gt;I&#39;ve been programming since I was in my early teens (1980 if I\nremember\n&gt;correctly) and I still have a couple of mistakes that I make\nregularly. My\n&gt;most common one is to forget to increment loop counters. Now that&#39;s a\ndumb\n&gt;mistake and I&#39;m sure that I&#39;m the only person on the list who makes\nthat\n&gt;mistake, but make it I do. Those endless loops always make for lots of\n&gt;fun! :-)\n\nActually, this brings up an interesting point. I&#39;m sure we all have\nerrors we make on a regular basis. Mine are more syntax errors -- I\nforget semicolons, but then the Java parser in jEdit complains to me\nand I fix the problem even before compiling. Each individual programmer\nwill tend to write more tests to cover up commonly-made mistakes. These\nwill be different from programmer to programmer. There is no &quot;right&quot;\nand &quot;wrong&quot;, here. I could see this becoming a tug-of-war on a team,\nthough: A adds a test for the get/set methods; B removes the tests\nbecause they got in the way of a refactoring; A adds them back to the\nrefactored code...\n\n&gt;&gt;[1] Note that I&#39;m ignoring cases where the compiler caught a typo.\n&gt;\n&gt;Not all languages that junit has been ported to will do that!\n\nAgreed, but as this is the JUnit mailing list, my comments (all\ncomments, really) must be placed within the context of Java. It should\nbe clear that I would behave differently when writing Smalltalk or\nRuby.\n\nJ. B.
