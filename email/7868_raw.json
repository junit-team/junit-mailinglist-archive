In most cases ye=\r\ns B&#39;s method is trivial so I\n&gt;could\n&gt;start from the other end and drive my =\r\ncode from the root class&#39;s test.\n&gt;However being a newbie(ish) at junit I do=\r\nn&#39;t currently like the idea of\n&gt;starting from that end as I still have a te=\r\nndency to &quot;wander off&quot; sometimes\n&gt;within my coding (you know how it is...) =\r\nand by driving from the wrong\n&gt;direction gives me the freedom to screw up. =\r\nI guess this is just a\n&gt;discipline thing.  BTW I like the idea of mocking i=\r\nn this context - I\n&gt;hadn&#39;t\n&gt;(yet) thought of that.\n&gt;\n&gt;Jonathan\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;-----Or=\r\niginal Message-----\n&gt;From: J. B. Rainsberger [mailto:jbrains@...]\n&gt;S=\r\nent: 25 April 2003 18:22\n&gt;To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;Subject: Re: [junit] T=\r\nest and test case dependencies\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;When B calls C, is B&#39;s method trivial? =\r\nSee the JUnit FAQ for details on\n&gt;what\n&gt;I mean by that. If B&#39;s method is tr=\r\nivial, then testing B only tests C and\n&gt;nothing else, so I wouldn&#39;t bother =\r\nwriting the test. If B&#39;s method takes\n&gt;parameters and passes them to C, the=\r\nn B&#39;s method still cannot break: only\n&gt;the methods that call B&#39;s method and=\r\n C could break, so test those.\n&gt;\n&gt;I would use the same approach for the rel=\r\nationship between A and B.\n&gt;\n&gt;If B&#39;s method is not trivial, then as soon as=\r\n you feel the pain of\n&gt;duplicated tests mock the behavior in C that B calls=\r\n and use that mock\n&gt;behavior in the test. This allows you to test B in isol=\r\nation from any\n&gt;defects in C.\n&gt;\n&gt;I hope this helps.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;So said Jonathan Od=\r\ndy on 4/25/2003 --------------------\n&gt;&gt;I understand that in general we want=\r\n to write tests and test cases that\n&gt;are\n&gt;&gt;not dependent upon each other so=\r\n that an earlier failing(?) test doesn&#39;t\n&gt;&gt;set\n&gt;&gt;state of the underlying ob=\r\nject(s) to prejudice later tests.  Okay fine,\n&gt;but\n&gt;&gt;I was wondering how pe=\r\nople solve/resolve the following type of dependency.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;If I have thr=\r\nee classes A, B and C where A delegates some functionality to\n&gt;&gt;B\n&gt;&gt;which d=\r\nelegates to C.  During my implementation and unit testing I write\n&gt;&gt;tests f=\r\nor C then implement the desired functionality in C.  I then repeat\n&gt;&gt;the pr=\r\nocess for B and A, okay fine.  But now I have an implied unit test\n&gt;&gt;depend=\r\nency don&#39;t I?  So when running my tests as a suite I really want my\n&gt;&gt;test =\r\ncases to run in the order C, B, A and never any other order because\n&gt;if\n&gt;&gt;t=\r\nhe defect is in C then I want to know about it from C and not from A or\n&gt;B.=\r\n\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;I am currently implementing a small library that does a lot of thi=\r\ns style\n&gt;&gt;of\n&gt;&gt;delegation, and being reasonably new to JUnit I wondered how=\r\n other people\n&gt;&gt;work round this issue especially since those nice Eclipse p=\r\neople provide a\n&gt;&gt;helpful &quot;run all tests in a package option&quot;.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Thanks =\r\ninadnavce\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Jonathan\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Yahoo!
