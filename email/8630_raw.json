I\nseem to remember that the places where I use &quot;new&quot; are referring either\nto:\n- unit testing vs functional testing (older)\n- mock objects vs stubs (older)\n\nTDD is certainly new but I don&#39;t think it in opposition to &quot;unit\ntesting&quot;. It is a way of writing unit tests (it&#39;s actually more - it&#39;s a\nway of developing application) and I wouldn&#39;t put &quot;unit testing&quot; on the\nsame level as &quot;TDD&quot;.\n\nPoint taken though! Do you think you could send me a private email and\npoint to me where you have seen this usage of &quot;new&quot;?\n\nThanks\n-Vincent\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Thomas Stankus Jr. [mailto:tjstankus@...]\n&gt; Sent: 09 July 2003 15:52\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: [junit] Re: JUnit in Action book\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks for the info. I actually purchased the ebook through Manning&#39;s\nMEAP\n&gt; program\n&gt; last night and read the first chapter. Well done so far! I especially\nlike\n&gt; the logical way\n&gt; you demonstrate the value of JUnit over old-style (non-framework) unit\n&gt; testing\n&gt; methods. This is great, convincing stuff for someone new to JUnit and\ngood\n&gt; ammo for\n&gt; anyone trying to convince management to invest more heavily in\nup-front\n&gt; testing. I&#39;m\n&gt; looking forward to reading subsequent chapters as they are published.\n&gt; \n&gt; I do have one sematic, nitpicky gripe. In several places, unit testing\nis\n&gt; referred to as a\n&gt; &quot;new&quot; testing strategy. Wouldn&#39;t it be better to refer to Test Driven\n&gt; Development as\n&gt; the &quot;new&quot; strategy? Unit testing has been around for quite some time,\nbut\n&gt; TDD is\n&gt; (arguably) a new strategy.\n&gt; \n&gt; -TJ\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Vincent Massol&quot; &lt;vmassol@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Hi,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m happy to announce that my JUnit in Action book is now available\n&gt; &gt; through the Manning Early Access Programme (MEAP). This means that\nyou\n&gt; &gt; can subscribe to it and get the chapters in PDF format as they are\n&gt; &gt; published (first chapter is already published, 2 others will be\n&gt; &gt; published tomorrow and other chapters will be posted at a rate of 1\nper\n&gt; &gt; week).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; More information about the book and MEAP is available at\n&gt; &gt; http://www.manning.com/massol/\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Here&#39;s some information about the book (taken from the book&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; back-cover):\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Developers in the know are switching to a new testing strategy -\nunit\n&gt; &gt; testing - which interleaves coding and testing in an integrated way.\n&gt; &gt; This has proven to be a powerful combination that results in better\n&gt; &gt; designed software with fewer defects and faster delivery cycles.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; JUnit in Action shows you how to benefit from this strategy using\nthe\n&gt; &gt; popular open source testing framework, JUnit. It&#39;s a no fluff\ndiscussion\n&gt; &gt; of unit testing techniques and best practices. It gives examples of\n&gt; &gt; tough situations such as how to unit test EJBs, database\napplications,\n&gt; &gt; JSPs and Taglibs. It discusses unit testing of J2EE applications,\nand\n&gt; &gt; shows how to test in automated builds.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; What&#39;s Inside:\n&gt; &gt; - Unit testing best practices\n&gt; &gt; - Testing in isolation with mock objects\n&gt; &gt; - In-container testing with Cactus\n&gt; &gt; - Automated builds with Ant and Maven\n&gt; &gt; - Unit testing from within Eclipse\n&gt; &gt; - Test Driven Development principles\n&gt; &gt; - Unit testing\n&gt; &gt;   - Java apps\n&gt; &gt;   - Servlets\n&gt; &gt;   - JSP\n&gt; &gt;   - Taglibs\n&gt; &gt;   - Filters\n&gt; &gt;   - EJB\n&gt; &gt;   - DB apps\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Note that the book can also pre-ordered from Amazon\n&gt; &gt; (http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1930110995/\n&gt; qid=1057695644\n&gt; &gt; /sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_1/104-1481474-9343103?v=glance&s=books&n=507846).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Feel free to ask any question.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks\n&gt; &gt; -Vincent\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
