We want to use JUnit as\n&gt; tools for performing unit testing. However, I found difficulties that\n&gt; test the correctness of JFrame (with other GUI components). Does it\n&gt; possible that test by using JUnit, say, the JLabel is appear correct\n&gt; caption after some changes. But at the same moment, how can I tigger\n&gt; the changes in JUnit?\n&gt;   Would you mind teaching me any tips to tackle this problems? Or\n&gt; does it has any articles/guide to the implementation of this kind of\n&gt; testing??\n&gt; \n&gt;   Best regards and thanks a lot for kind attention.\n\nI strongly recommend Dave Astels&#39; book, &quot;Test Driven Development: A \nPractical Guide&quot;. It is the only Java-based book I know that uses a \nSwing GUI as the core example for JUnit and its related GUI testing \npackages (Jemmy). Don&#39;t even think about the price of the book. If \nyou&#39;re going to be testing and test-driving Swing GUI applications for \neven just a few months, you&#39;ll get your investment back. No question.\n-- \nJ. B.
