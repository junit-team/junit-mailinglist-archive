With this feat=\r\nure many nice ways to do thing become possible. Therefore I am wondering if=\r\n other people agree that it might be time for a JUnit5 putting this new fea=\r\nture to good use.\n\nA source for inspiration for me in this regard are the F=\r\nunSuite of ScalaTest http://www.scalatest.org/getting_started_with_fun_suit=\r\ne\n\nThere a test definition is a method call (instead of a method definition=\r\n in JUnit) that registers a test for execution. It looks roughly like this:=\r\n\n\n\nclass MyTestClass{\n\n    test(&quot;The test name&quot;){\n        // the actual tes=\r\nt goes here \n    }\n}\n\nWith this approach things like Rules become extremly =\r\ntrivial, since all you have to do is wrap the code block (i.e. closure) in =\r\na new new code block. \n\nAlso parameterized test become fairly easy, because=\r\n you would just put the call to test in a loop.\n\nWhat do you think? Is this=\r\n an interesting direction for JUnit to go?\n\nkind regards \nJens\n\n\n\n\n",
