Not that I <br/>\ncould think of any wrong way, but I&#39;m wondering why you only have one <br/>\nchance.  What if you actually came up with a better way than all these <br/>\nafter some time using JUnit?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Interesting. It seems to me like it&#39;d be a much more common<br/>\n&gt;solution than that. I&#39;ll go back and look at my designs again<br/>\n&gt;and see if I can come up with a different approach that avoids<br/>\n&gt;the need for the &quot;dynamic property&quot;. Perhaps I&#39;m missing a<br/>\n&gt;good solution.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I should clarify that the factory approach is common, the use of dynamic <br/>\nproperties is not, in my experience.  As we&#39;ve seen in other posts, <br/>\noften times the test fixture can directly set the implementation on the <br/>\nfactory.  Then the factory is set into something else, which is set into <br/>\nsomething else, etc.  This is one reason I suggest that testability <br/>\nhelps balance out the use of composition and inheritance.  If <br/>\ninheritance is overused, then mocking any aspect of the system is <br/>\ngenerally difficult.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Well, I have one suggestion. In response to my question about <br/>\n&gt;where to place the tests, nearly everybody responded that a <br/>\n&gt;separate source hierarchy was the best place (5 of 6 responders,<br/>\n&gt;and the 6th proposed a new solution and said separate hierarchy<br/>\n&gt;was his second choice). I think that&#39;s sufficient agreement to<br/>\n&gt;make this an acknowledged &quot;best practice&quot;, and if you agree and<br/>\n&gt;would like to add it to the FAQ, I&#39;ll volunteer to write up an<br/>\n&gt;item on it. Let me know.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s a best practice or just a personal aesthetic thing. <br/>\n But we could claim it as a best practice.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s how it&#39;s currently described in the &quot;Organizing Tests&quot; section of <br/>\nthe FAQ:<br/>\n<br/>\n    <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://junit.sourceforge.net/doc/faq/faq.htm#organize_1\">http://junit.sourceforge.net/doc/faq/faq.htm#organize_1</a><br/>\n<br/>\nIf another entry in the &quot;Best Practices&quot; section would help, go for it. <br/>\n Thanks!<br/>\n<br/>\nMike<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nMike Clark<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clarkware.com\">http://clarkware.com</a> <br/>\n(720) 851-2014</div>",
