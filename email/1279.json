What are we trying to do when we do &quot;unit&quot; testing?<br/>\n&gt;A. We are testing all of the interfaces exposed by a &quot;unit&quot; to external<br/>\n&gt;components to ensure that those interfaces react as we would expect them to<br/>\n&gt;in all reasonable scenarios that we can think of.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;So to answer the question about private/protected methods: Does a private<br/>\n&gt;method expose itself to external components? No - therefore we do not need<br/>\n&gt;to test them. Errors within private methods will become apparent from<br/>\n&gt;testing the other interfaces.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Undoubtably that&#39;s true. But then if we are accepting that testing <br/>\npublic/friendly/protected methods adecuately test these methods, why not go <br/>\none step beyond and say that black box testing is all we need? It seems to <br/>\nme that testing private methods is as useful and valid as testing <br/>\nnon-private ones, just at a different level of granularity.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;snip&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJim<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\n<br/>\n                           *   Jim Cheesman   *<br/>\n             Trabajo: <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jchees@...\">jchees@...</a> - (34)(91) 724 9200 x 2360<br/>\n         On one hand, I&#39;m <br/>\nindecisive, but on the other, I&#39;m not.</div>",
