Particularly in the area of visibility.. many developers assume \n&gt;&gt;that no written agreement can be sufficient if something is made \n&gt;&gt;public.  I think that the issue is that we are not used to thinking \n&gt;&gt;about agreements beyond the code and we&#39;re not used to holding people to \n&gt;&gt;them.\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;I&#39;d rephrase that a little. We have decades of experience with \n&gt;documenting software and APIs and trying to make decrees (not agreements \n&gt;as I&#39;ll explain in another post) about how it must be used. Experience \n&gt;has proven that this doesn&#39;t work well. Consider the issues with even a \n&gt;very well-known code base like Java with very well known and documented \n&gt;design principles. How many mucked up hashCode()-equals() \n&gt;implementations do we still encounter? Ten years ago, it was even worse. \n&gt;  And don&#39;t get me started on runtime vs. checked exceptions. Even major \n&gt;APIs pushed through the JCP still get this exactly backwards. You need \n&gt;documentation, certainly, but documentation alone is not sufficient for \n&gt;robust code.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nI&#39;d argue that by and large, Java has been very successful.  It provided \nenough hand holding to allow average programmers to deliver a wide array \nof good applications. \n\nWhen they designed Java, they knew that they were targetting the middle \nof the road... they left out a slew of features which would have made \nlife easier for more advanced developers and they did it deliberately to \nmake the language more approachable.  Despite that, there are people who \nstill screw up and they screw up precisely because the language offers \nenough freedom to screw up.  On balance, that&#39;s okay because if it \ndidn&#39;t it would probably be far less functional than it is.\n\nA lot of the backlash that we are seeing against Java right now comes \nfrom the fact that many people are discovering that they can be more \nproductive without the hand holding, and they are willing to assume \nresponsibility to leave it behind.\n\n&gt;By contrast, things that we can enforce in code do seem to work pretty \n&gt;well. That we also have decades of experience telling us. Garbage \n&gt;collection improves on manual memory management. Checked exceptions get \n&gt;programmers to write a lot more error handling code than documentation \n&gt;ever did. (Not quite as much as they should, of course, but a lot more \n&gt;than they used to.) Automated unit tests (ideally run without programmer \n&gt;involvement on a continuous integration server) keep programmers from \n&gt;breaking the build. Having the source code repository either verify \n&gt;formatting  or reformat code before checking it in keeps badly formatted \n&gt;code from being checked into the source code repository.\n&gt;\n&gt;These aren&#39;t absolutes. They are matters of degree. But they are large \n&gt;matters of degree. We know these things. We&#39;ve learned them through \n&gt;experience. Rules we enforce in code and systems are far more likely to \n&gt;be followed than rules we merely document.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nTrue, but it is a double edged sword.  It works when people don&#39;t need \nthe freedom to deal with exceptional cases, or when they do need the \nfreedom and have it.\n\nMichael Feathers\nwww.objectmentor.com\n\n\n",
