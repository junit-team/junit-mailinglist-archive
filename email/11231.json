You can <br/>\ncontrol order by 1) putting all 3 operations in one test method (aka <br/>\nlinear programming) or 2) explicitly adding test methods to a test <br/>\nsuite in the order you desire (it&#39;s an ordered collection under the <br/>\nhood).<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, is that a design smell?  Probably.  Does that mean JUnit isn&#39;t the <br/>\nright tool?  I don&#39;t think so.  The computer-checked assertions are <br/>\nstill valuable over, say, visual inspection.  And perhaps not having to <br/>\nvisually inspect results every time the tests are run will afford more <br/>\ntime to address the design smell.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike</div>",
