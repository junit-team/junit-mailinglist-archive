Specifically, a\nstatic inner class does not have any reference to an enclosing instance.&quot;\n\nThe example the book gives is:\n\npublic class MyOuter {\n  public static class MyInner {\n  }\n  public static void main(String[] args) {\n    MyInner aMyInner = new MyOuter.MyInner();\n  }\n}\n\nAn inner class most definately does NOT need to be bound to an outer class\nas is proved by the code snippet above.  It is true that a non-static inner\nclass DOES need to be bound to an enclosing class though.\n\nFor less information in a more confused manner see the Java Language\nSpecification 2nd edition section 8.1.2.\n\n-Phil\n\n\n\n                                                                                                      \n                      Scott Palmer                                                                    \n                      &lt;scott.palmer@2con         To:      junit@yahoogroups.com                       \n                      nected.org&gt;                cc:                                                  \n                                                 Subject: [junit] Re: What&#39;s wrong with using inner   \n                      04/10/03 08:55 AM          classes for tests?                                   \n                      Please respond to                                                               \n                      junit                                                                           \n                                                                                                      \n                                                                                                      \n\n\n\n\nI just thought I would point out that (at least according to some)\nthere is no such thing as a &#39;static inner class&#39;.  An &#39;inner&#39; class\nMUST be bound to an instance of the outer class, and thus can&#39;t be\nstatic.  What you are talking about here I think is referred to as a\n&#39;nested&#39; class.  Which is declared exactly like you would expect a\n&#39;static inner class&#39; to be declared if that&#39;s what it was called:-).  I\nremember hearing the term &#39;top level nested class&#39;  I think it was in\nan article on jRoundup.com.\n\nI know, not exactly relevant to the discussion.. I&#39;ll get back to work\n:-)\n\nI don&#39;t recall anyone mentioning that if for some reason you need\naccess to a private member to do your test. E.g. to verify internal\nstate of your object that is not easily verifiable via public or\nprotected methods, then a inner class would help.  I&#39;m new to Unit\nTesting so there is probably something else that is wrong with that\n:-).  It seems that there are occasionally valid reasons to do that\nthough.\n\nScott\n\nOn Wednesday, April 9, 2003, at 04:25 PM, junit@yahoogroups.com wrote:\n\n&gt; Are static inner classes actually a member variable...\n\n\n\n\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\njunit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n\n\nYour use of Yahoo!
