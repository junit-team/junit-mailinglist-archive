Oops.)\n\nWe hacked up an earlier version of JUnit to scan through all jar \nfiles in the classpath and run all found tests. Our solution required \nJDK 1.2, even though (for now) most of our developers are stuck on \nJDK 1.1 (we&#39;re hoping to move from MS J++ soon). \n\nObviously this is not good -- having our developers run against a \ndifferent JDK version than our tests. \n\nI&#39;m trying to clean things up, so I&#39;m ripping out our custom hacks \nand upgrading to JUnit 3.5. I notice the new classpath scanning code \n(in ClassPathTestCollector et al), but also notice that the comments \nstate that JAR scanning is not implemented. \n\nI tried Duncan McGregor&#39;s ZipAwareLoadingTestRunner and haven&#39;t had \nany luck -- various class loading and null pointer problems (not in \nhis code). \n\nSo my question is: Has anyone managed to get JUnit to scan the \nclasspath and execute tests in all jar files using JDK 1.1? \n\nthanks in advance, \nSimon \n\n\n\n",
