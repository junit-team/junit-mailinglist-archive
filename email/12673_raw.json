So we do the following:\n\n- a status-method (returning a string) is introduced into each\ntestcases (this is not necessary, but helpful)\n- a java-program scans the testcases, generates an omitted list (not\nready, run manual etc) as csv and generates suites for the testcases\n(based on package names)\n- another javaprogram (lets call it the runner) starts the tests,\nbeginning with the &quot;anchor&quot;-suite - there is no graphical output\n(could probably done with a listener)\n- the runner loads the saved result of the previous test run (refer to\nbelow)\n- the runner compares the result of the current run (which gives also\ninformation like total numbers of testcases, failed testcases, runtime\netc) with the previous run\n- remark: the result contains the same information which is available\nin the gui-runner and probably in xml-reports\n- If a current failure is not found in the previous list, then it gets\nthe status new (this works also for different errors for the same\ntestcase)\n- the runner saves the new result as csv (status, class, failure,\nexception) under a fixed name as reference for the next run and\nadditionally archives it with a timestamp\n\nThe result of this process is:\n- the omitted list tells us how much work is left (it is also archived\nwith a timestamp, but this history is needed not that often)\n- the overall statistics of the testrun tells us how much work ist\ndone &lt;g&gt;\n- the testresults gives us a list of failures to work on and most\nimportant the newly introduced errors get the status new - to be\nchecked immediately\n- a simple textsearch on the archive-directory reveals the history of\na testcase (when and how did he show up in the failure-history)\n- by copying and renaming an archived result we can run the current\ntests against any historical result (daily regression versus weekly\nbuild for example)\n\nI manually import the csv-files and the statistical information into a\nspreadsheet with three tabs: omitted, failed, regression history\n(charts with the overall numbers, especially the number of &quot;new&quot;\nerrors). At least the creation of the csv-data is no problem (the\ncomplete set of information is available) and the import could be\nsemi-automized with a macro - I have not figured out how to insert an\nexcel-row directly from java. The only thing I would like to add is to\nsave the eclipse-logfile as well, but I do not know how ...\n\nTo me the important thing is to keep the historical data and to see\nimmediately when a testcase fails. In theory everything is green and\nif not it is fixed before the next run ... at least thats what the\ntheory says &lt;g&gt;. Maybe you can use and extend this approach to extract\nand excel the data you need.\n\n   cheers, Carsten \n\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, didoss@c... wrote:\n&gt; Not hearing anyone running forward with a solution, I&#39;m left with\ntwo questions: one for the group, and one for some &#39;higher up&#39;.\n&gt; \n&gt; For the group: do you think that this would be useful functionality\nfor someone to try and creat?\n&gt; \n&gt; For some &#39;higher up&#39;: if I were interested in writing this code,\nwhat is the process for that?\n&gt; \n&gt; thanks, Dianne\n&gt; \n&gt; -------------- Original message -------------- \n&gt; \n&gt; Paul Dominic writes:\n&gt;       \n&gt;                     If you are generating JUnit Report through Ant,\n&gt; definitely you\n&gt;       should write one build.xml file. Before generating new report,\n&gt; why not you\n&gt;       take copy of the previous report.  In Ant API  contains copy\ntag\n&gt; and move\n&gt;       tag. So\n&gt;       first step you take a back up using Copy/ Move tag.\n&gt;       Second step you clear your old report using delete tag.\n&gt;       Third step create report folder again.\n&gt;       Finally you generate new report.\n&gt; \n&gt; Are you saying there&#39;s no extension for JUnit that sends the test\n&gt; results/report into a database, using JDBC or some other mechanism?\n I&#39;m\n&gt; new to JUnit, too, but I find it hard to believe that there isn&#39;t\n&gt; already software to store historical test results in a database.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Todd.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
