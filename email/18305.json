    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-996420819\">Thanks David,<br/>\nThat was what I was trying to say /and/ I think decoupling your code from<br/>\nEJB specifics and JNDI lookups and EJB-lifecycle events is a good idea. An<br/>\nEJB container is an execution environment and business logic should not<br/>\ndepend on where it is executing. A combination of JUnit-tests without cactus<br/>\nand systemtests (executed as a client against the application deployed in a<br/>\ncontainer works well in our project). The latter is run with our homecooked<br/>\nacceptance testing framework and the former with junit. This is possible<br/>\nbecause our EJB:s are merely shells contining our services that are<br/>\nimplemented as pojos and tested outside the EJB.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt works well for us. Of course there are different ways to skin a cat :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 11/3/06, David Saff &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:saff@...\">saff@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Just to clarify, on projects like this, I usually have two levels of<br/>\n&gt; tests:<br/>\n&gt; user tests that verify that the end user sees what she expects (running in<br/>\n&gt; the container, even through the browser), and developer tests that verify<br/>\n&gt; that my classes work as I expect. For user tests, it&#39;s essential to have<br/>\n&gt; all the components in place. For developer tests, it&#39;s counter-productive:<br/>\n&gt; I want to understand what my code does independently of what services are<br/>\n&gt; provided by third-party containers or servers, and I also want to run<br/>\n&gt; developer tests often and fast.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I think this is the same thing Vishal is saying below, but I wanted a<br/>\n&gt; chance<br/>\n&gt; to rephrase it a little.

It&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; very easy to package you test and run them on server side. They also<br/>\n&gt; &gt; have documentation on how to test EJB or any regular JUnit test in the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; container.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; For higher level testing (i.e testing like a customer), if you need to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; verify something in container, then verify it in container. Don&#39;t try to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; run it outside, otherwise the whole purpose of testing is lost.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; --Vishal<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; lenniedg2000 wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m using Eclipse 3.2, Orion application server, J2EE 5.0, Oracle<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; database.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;ve written a jUnit test but it doesn&#39;t run since it doesn&#39;t run<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; within the application server &quot;container&quot; and so can&#39;t find the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; database data-sources that I&#39;ve setup.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; How can I run jUnit unit tests inside an application server<br/>\n&gt; &quot;container&quot;?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Kind Regards,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Lennie De Villiers<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; __________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Notice: This email message, together with any attachments, may contain<br/>\n&gt; &gt; information of BEA Systems, Inc., its subsidiaries and affiliated<br/>\n&gt; &gt; entities, that may be confidential, proprietary, copyrighted and/or<br/>\n&gt; &gt; legally privileged, and is intended solely for the use of the individual<br/>\n&gt; &gt; or entity named in this message.
