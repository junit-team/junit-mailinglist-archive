I&#39;ve done the same thing in many production systems,\n&gt; and I rarely test it.\n\nIf you&#39;ve done this many times it seems a reusable mock object could be\nuseful across all these implementations.  Something as fundamental and\ncommon as Connections and Datasources are used in lots of projects,\nobviously.\n\n&gt; Note that Kent Beck says, right in the first page or two of his chapter\n&gt; on testing in _Extreme Programming Explained_, you should not write\n&gt; tests for things that seem simple and unlikely to break. (I&#39;d quote it,\n&gt; but I&#39;m at home right now and the book is at work.)\n\nI read it as applying mainly to simple accessors and mutators, but I get the\npoint.  Again, the simplicity of the code example had nothing to do with the\noriginal thread, which was about how to unit test certain predicaments\npeople code themselves into (or inherit from someone else).\n\n&gt; My concern is not about shipping it with the product; my concern is\n&gt; that, whether it ships or not, it&#39;s extra code to write and maintain.\n\nLike I said, there&#39;s no reason it couldn&#39;t be reused.  We&#39;re talking about a\nConnection and some kind of ConnectionFactory, pretty commonly used, as you\nsaid above.\n\nAnother idea, borrowed from Kent Beck&#39;s latest book on TDD, is SelfShunt,\nwhere you have the TestCase itself be a kind of mock object, implementing\nthe interface of whatever class your class under test expects to interact\nwith.\n\n&gt; Well, I saw it, perhaps incorrectly, as you saying &quot;there is never\n&gt; a case where it&#39;s better to modify implementation code to make it\n&gt; testable,&quot; and I presented a single case that I thought disproved this\n&gt; statement. (At the very least, it does for me. I guess it&#39;s a matter of\n&gt; opinion whether or not it does for others.)\n\nI think &quot;testability&quot; can become a slippery slope.  We&#39;re only debating\nafter all, and in this debate I chose and am sticking to my original\nargument that (and not the capitulation to &quot;last resort,&quot; where I don&#39;t\ncompletely disagree with you):\n\n&quot;I would predict that the strategy listed above, while good intentioned, on\na project of any size would wind up with lots of extra code throughout added\njust for testability.  I don&#39;t think you should add a method just to make\nyour stuff accessible to a test class, unless possibly as a last resort.\nTestability is an aspectual concern, not really a part of an object being\nmodeled.  So this strategy has the potential to make testability a\ncorrupting influence on the modeling of objects, in my opinion.&quot;\n\n&gt; I wouldn&#39;t, because it was test-driven development that drove me to the\n&gt; above solution in the first place. I thought, &quot;Darn, to test this I&#39;ve\n&gt; got to make another mock object here, and pass it a database connection.\n&gt; Why not just pass in the connection directly, and save myself the effort?&quot;\n\nOK, that&#39;s cool.  What can I say?  Seems fine in this situation.\n\nScott S.\n\n\n\n",
