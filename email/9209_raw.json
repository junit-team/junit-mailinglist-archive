Let&#39;s write a test and find out.&quot;)\n\nAlmost. Its more like a somewhat informed walk through an application.\nThe direction you take on the walk is guided by a combination of some\ngeneral goal for the testing session, where you are in the application\nand what you&#39;ve observed about the application so far. \n\nExploratory testing is usually performed on an application&#39;s end-user\ninterface, although I suppose you could do it at the unit level with a\ndebugger and interactive development environment.\n\n&gt; It sounds to me like the &quot;scripted testing&quot; he&#39;s talking \n&gt; about in that article is not XP-style testing, where you run \n&gt; the tests as you come up with them, but instead one where you \n&gt; create a whole series of tests before you take them to the \n&gt; code. Especially where he says:\n&gt; \n&gt;     Scripting has its place. I can imagine testing situations where\n&gt;     efficiency and repeatability are so important that we \n&gt; should script\n&gt;     or automate them.\n&gt; \n&gt; I can&#39;t imagine a situation where efficiency and repeatability are\n&gt; *not* important enough to script the tests! \n&gt; But if you can \n&gt; somehow manipulate the system quickly enough to do \n&gt; exploratory testing, you can probably come up with a way for \n&gt; the script to manipulate the system even more quickly, and \n&gt; then just add your tests to the script, rather than throwing \n&gt; them away as soon as you&#39;ve tried them out.\n&gt; \n&gt; cjs\n\nThe good part of ET is that you spend less time coming up with scripts\nand automating and more time testing, so you have a greater liklihood of\ngoing down a path you might not otherwise have tested. The bad part,\nobviously, is that because there is no automation some paths may only\nget hit once, possibly before a defect is ever inserted there.\n\nI&#39;ve seen demonstrations of Exploratory testing by experts in that\nparticular field. When they did find defects using this technique, they\nwere usually unable to reproduce them because they couldn&#39;t remember the\nexact steps they had followed to get where they were. Some get around\nthis with a video recorder, with mixed success. Ultimately it is a\ntechnique to consider whether to use, given your own particular context.\n\n---\nOutgoing mail is certified Virus Free.\nChecked by AVG anti-virus system (http://www.grisoft.com).\nVersion: 6.0.510 / Virus Database: 307 - Release Date: 8/14/2003\n \n\n\n",
