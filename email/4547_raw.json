Now I ask myself, why I am\n&gt; trying to get into the guts of the implementation and not\n&gt; just testing from the public interface.  Using Design\n&gt; By Contract to spec out the public interface and guide\n&gt; what tests need to be written helps me do just that.\n&gt; Whenever I find myself wanting to access private parts\n&gt; in a test case, I step back and rethink why I want to\n&gt; do it... Usually it is because I am not writing my\n&gt; test first, I am writing after the fact, with knowledge\n&gt; of the implementation ...  I slap myself and get back\n&gt; into writing the tests first and all is better.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\nThanks!  You said what i was trying to say much better than i did! While \nin theory i may argue in favor of inner classes to test private methods, \nin practice i don&#39;t test them directly. In practice, i don&#39;t even design \nprivate methods directly. I start by writing up a public interface *on \npaper* using DBC (it helps to be away from the computer). Then i work \nout any method dependencies, and start coding test-first. Private \nmethods arise in my code as refactorings - the third time i find myself \nwriting the same bit of code, i refactor it into a private method. If \ni&#39;m doing things right, the refactoring does not add or alter my unit \ntests in any way. I make sure the unit tests pass, and go on with more \nnew functionality.\n\nHmm... is there a Pattern there? Or at least a good rule of thumb? \n&quot;Private methods should generally result only from refactoring&quot;. Yeah... \nthis explains why i think of needing to test private methods directly as \na smell.\n\n-- \n\nDavid Stagner\n\nNational Marrow Donor Program\n3001 Broadway Street NE\nBroadway Ridge Suite 500\nMinneapolis, MN  55413\n\nEmail: dstagner@...\n\n\n\n",
