Now,\n&gt; these run against a single backend and now several developers in my\n&gt; group would like to use these tests against other backends to test them.\n&gt; The most natural way to do this is with the test suite mechanism in\n&gt; jUnit. That is to say, make up a suite that requires merely that the\n&gt; backend be set and test away. Or so I thought.\n&gt;\n&gt; The different backends are different projects in our group and live in\n&gt; different Maven modules.\n&gt;\n&gt; The problem is that making a suite using annotations does not really\n&gt; work so well. The annotations are not inherited. The other solution\n&gt; which is to have the developers make their own suites by annotations is\n&gt; also very clunky and will probably break at some point.\n&gt;\n&gt; So here is my question: Is there any way to make a test suite that is a\n&gt; harness and can be reused?\n&gt;\n&gt; I assume that jUnit 3.8&#39;s method of explicitly creating a suite is going\n&gt; to get deprecated soon, right? So that would be a deadend. Also, are\n&gt; their plans to make annotations inheritable at some point in jUnit? We\n&gt; could maybe live with cutting and pasting for the short term if we knew\n&gt; that this issue would get resolved at some point.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks!\n&gt;\n&gt; Jeff\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n",
