I&#39;m new to unit testing so please bear with me. I have a<br/>\n&gt; method that contains a lot of try and catch statements:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; try{<br/>\n&gt; \tstatement1<br/>\n&gt; \tstatement2<br/>\n&gt; }<br/>\n&gt; catch(ExceptionType1 e1){<br/>\n&gt; \tSystem.err.println(&quot;The following exception occurred &quot; +<br/>\n&gt; e1.toString());<br/>\n&gt; }<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I know that this is not a very good way of handling exceptions but I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; struggling to find a better way. Another alternative is to use a logger<br/>\n&gt; such as log4j, but this does not help much. The problem is how do I test<br/>\n&gt; if the method is not working properly, as the exception was caught and<br/>\n&gt; won&#39;t be visible to JUnit.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The most obvious solution would be to let the method throw all<br/>\n&gt; exceptions that are generated. The problem is that there are 5 or 6<br/>\n&gt; different types of exceptions that this method can generate and this<br/>\n&gt; seems to make my code very messy.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Could anyone please tell me what is the proper approach to this, or<br/>\n&gt; refer me to any relevant reading.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks in advance.<br/>\n&gt; Pico<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Seems to me you have three options. Which one you choose will depend on <br/>\nwhat the intent of your code is.<br/>\n<br/>\n1) You could just let the exceptions propagate up. The two previous <br/>\nresponses assumed that this was an option for you. It may not be.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut if, for whatever reason, you can&#39;t propagate the exceptions...<br/>\n<br/>\n2)  If it is not important that statement2/3/4/5 execute and all you are <br/>\ngoing to do is log the failure, just put a single try catch around the <br/>\nwhole method*.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) Do what you are doing now except*<br/>\n<br/>\n* Instead of writing to System.err, write to a log. Write a unit test <br/>\nthat checks the contents of the log after a failure.<br/>\n<br/>\nKevin</div>",
