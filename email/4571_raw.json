Is\nanybody\n&gt; &gt;else is doing this and how they are implementing DBC (iCon=\r\ntract? JASS?\nor\n&gt; &gt;merely at a documentation level?)\n&gt;\n&gt;JBR\n&gt;\n&gt;Test-Driven =\r\nDevelopment drives a programmer towards DBC on a test-by-test\n&gt;basis. As a =\r\nresult, although I don&#39;t use DBC tools, I believe I&#39;m doing\nDBC\n&gt;\n&gt;by simpl=\r\ny writing the tests first. In a way, JUnit is my DBC tool.\n&gt;\n&gt;From: steven.=\r\nhale@...\n&gt;\n&gt;I can see your point from a component manufacturer&#39;s point =\r\nof view - I can\n&gt;test that I can fullfil my contract using JUnit.\n&gt;\n&gt;From a=\r\n component user view point I&#39;d still like to see a concise\n&gt;description of =\r\nthe prerequisites without having to dig into the component\n&gt;code or even th=\r\ne unit testing code...\n&gt;... though I realise I&#39;m in danger of reopening the=\r\n javadoc v unit test\n&gt;discussion :-)\n\nIndeed. Not only that, as a component=\r\n user, I find that Javadoc is\nsufficient to my purpose most of the time. It=\r\n is rare that I need the level\n\nof detail that a class&#39; contract gives me. =\r\nWhen I do need it, I want it in\na\nformal notation, since natural languages =\r\nare ambiguous. At that point, Java\n\ncode is the preferred formal notation, =\r\nsince Java is the language I program\n\nin the most. I&#39;ll accept Smalltalk an=\r\nd muddle through with Ruby. Any way\nyou\nslice it, I wanna see code. The bes=\r\nt code is self-verifying executing code.\n\nSounds like a JUnit test. :)\n\nJ. =\r\nB.
