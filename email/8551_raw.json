I just don&#39;t think that it&#39;s necessarily any clearer: it&#39;s\n&gt;ju=\r\nst all in one file rather than in three.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Your points are good, but the=\r\ny seem to boil down to having several\n&gt;different classes with good names an=\r\nd all will be right with the world.\n&gt;While that may be true, the problem I =\r\nhave is more at the package scope.\n&gt;When looking at a directory, how do you=\r\n know where to start looking? \n\nThe names of the classes make that obvious.=\r\n Returning to my example, if I want to see how Bag works, I look for anythi=\r\nng that has &quot;BagTest&quot; in the name. The fact that there may be four classes =\r\nmatches those criteria shouldn&#39;t be a big problem.\n\n&gt;The\n&gt;reason I like the=\r\n inner classes is that you can set up a test suite of\n&gt;sorts in an obviousl=\r\ny named class. With those inner classes, you can\n&gt;still have several test f=\r\niles that support that main one, but if you are\n&gt;entering a directory to in=\r\nvestigate someone else&#39;s testing strategy,\n&gt;then having a well-defined star=\r\nting point is a great help. Don&#39;t get me\n&gt;wrong, you can still use several =\r\ndifferent files, so long as they are\n&gt;referenced from within an obviously n=\r\named one. Using your Bag examples,\n&gt;I would say that the BagTest should ref=\r\ner to the other two, and possibly\n&gt;a third that actually has the run-of-the=\r\n-mill type tests. That way, when\n&gt;entering a directory with tests for 20 or=\r\n more classes (look at\n&gt;java.util for example), I could find BagTest.java q=\r\nuickly and from there\n&gt;discover the other test classes that are directly ap=\r\nplicable.\n\nSome projects have used a different approach. They manage test s=\r\nuites manually. What you have called &quot;BagTest&quot; would be &quot;BagSuite&quot; for them=\r\n, and in BagSuite you would find a hand-built test suite that refers to all=\r\n the classes that contain tests for a Bag. BagSuite would refer to EmptyBag=\r\nTest, HelloTwiceBagTest and OneItemBagTest, for example. This way you know =\r\nimmediately to look at BagSuite to find all the bag tests.\n\nWhen you open i=\r\nt, though, BagSuite does nothing more than say &quot;see EmptyBagTest, HelloTwic=\r\neBagTest and OneItemBagTest for details.&quot; I claim that seeing the three Jav=\r\na source files all named *BagTest.java does the same work without the extra=\r\n source file.\n\nAs for a well-defined starting point, the set of test files =\r\n*BagTest.java *is* a well-defined, obviously-named starting point. It is pe=\r\nrhaps slightly less obvious than opening &quot;BagTest.java&quot;, but not so much th=\r\nat it poses a problem. If someone wants to write &quot;BagTest.java&quot;, then that&#39;=\r\ns cool with me, but I wouldn&#39;t do it.\n\n&gt;Granted, this is all beginning to s=\r\nound like the student teaching the\n&gt;teacher, but while I lack some JUnit ex=\r\nperience, the software\n&gt;engineering experience is there. One of the hardest=\r\n things about\n&gt;approaching a body of source code (production or test) is fi=\r\nguring out\n&gt;where to start. To that end, it seems having a single, well-nam=\r\ned\n&gt;starting point makes great strides.\n\nIt does. Another technique is talk=\r\ning to people: a close-knit team will agree to standards and uphold them, o=\r\nbviating the need for documentation masquerading as code. Another technique=\r\n is a drawing on the wall, or a list on the corkboard.\n\nI have a general av=\r\nersion to code that does nothing more than document something. That&#39;s why w=\r\ne have documentation. Code should be self-documenting, but it should also d=\r\no something useful at runtime.\n\nAnd keep in mind: we&#39;ll all teachers and st=\r\nudents here.\n\nTake care.\n\n[Conclusion: I don&#39;t think what you&#39;re doing is b=\r\nad; but I wouldn&#39;t do it myself, because I would solve the same problem a d=\r\nifferent way.]\n\nJ.
