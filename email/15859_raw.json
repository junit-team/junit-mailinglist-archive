In 2006 anyone who&#39;s running a desktop or a\n&gt; &gt; server with less than a gigabyte of RAM is being penny wise and very\n&gt; &gt; pound foolish.\n\nIt seems your experience is somewhat limited ...\n\n2 real scenarios:\n\n1000 servers in outlets of a Europe-wide retailer, having been installed\nover the last 5 years (sometimes, for tax reasons, with considerable\nquarrels with &quot;deciders&quot; in different countries = there are even older\nmachines around, because they are now completely written off [fiscally] and\nhence &quot;are most valuable&quot; [in the eyes of accounting]).\nIn 2001, physical mem size was not 1GB or 2GB, but 256MB or (at most) 512MB.\nOk - let&#39;s upgrade to 1 gig:\n* Travel expense for technicians to all those locations ... large enough. \n* Outsourcing the memory upgrading?: With the required quality (hardware\nchange must happen overnight, 100% guaranteed to run next day in the morning\nwhen shop opens), outsourcing cannot be bought consistently throughout all\ncountries. (Why aren&#39;t there two servers so that memory change needn&#39;t be\n100% perfect? ... is was simply never necessary).\n\nNet effect: It is (much!) cheaper to optimize some(! - critical, usually\nnewer) programs to run in 256MB even today, with 80 EUR/hour for a few weeks\nof work.\n\n---\n\nSimilarly for a company that leases out HW+SW for a special sort of\nretailers: 5 year contracts, around 10000 widely dispersed customers =\nreplacement rate of 2000/year = around 10/day. Highest cost of operations\nare technicians&#39; travel expenses; therefore the pressure to keep HW exactly\nthe same for 5 years (until end of lease - then, all HW is routinely\nchanged) is very high.\n\n---\n\nIf you have a better idea how to deal with these situations in the\nshort...medium run, please tell us! \n\n* send memory over the network? ;-) (maybe there&#39;s *something* to this -\nhonestly! sometimes weird ideas are worth to look at -, but we currently\nfail to see the realistic solution following from this ...)\n\n* re-architecture everything to run centrally/on some server farms!!! ... ?\n:-( not always possible because of \n** fiscal laws that require data to be accessible in the country of the\nbusiness [yes, there are laws like this; e.g. in France]\n** up-times, bandwidths and other qualities of networks (many customers are\non ISDN lines; throughout Europe, network QoS varies considerably)\n** in 2nd scenario, one USP is actually that data are on-site.\n** and more ...\n\nBut still, I agree with the concept that buying hardware should at least be\n*considered* an option when dealing with memory problems - so that there is\na comparison of price tags of SW optimzation vs. HW replacement/upgrading\nfor a qualified management decision which way to go.\n\nRegards\nHarald M.\n\n-- \n10 GB Mailbox, 100 FreeSMS/Monat http://www.gmx.net/de/go/topmail\n+++ GMX - die erste Adresse f�r Mail, Message, More +++\n\n",
