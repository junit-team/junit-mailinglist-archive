It works for simple cases b=\r\nut with customized Runner-classes and new JUnit-features (e.g. the introduc=\r\ntion of JUnit-Rules) the result is usually bad and it discourages the IDE u=\r\nsers (i.e. the developers) from taking full advantage of JUnit!\n\nHowever, M=\r\naven (versions 2.0-2.2) and its Surefire-plugin has handled the JUnit-integ=\r\nration wonderfully, as far as I know, so your post worries me a little. Wha=\r\nt is it that you want to accomplish by moving away from the successful(!) &quot;=\r\nJunitcore+RunListener based approach&quot;?\n\nHenrik\n\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.c=\r\nom, kristian@... wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt; \n&gt; I maintain the junit provider for mave=\r\nn-surefire, and I&#39;m looking into transitioning from  a Junitcore+RunListene=\r\nr based approach to an approach based on something like BlockJUnit4ClassRun=\r\nner.\n&gt; \n&gt; Unfortunately I cannot subclass the BlockJUnit4ClassRunner since =\r\nthe client code itself may need to do that, so I&#39;d somehow need to put &quot;my&quot;=\r\n \n&gt; Runner in front of the client-supplied one, maybe something proxy like.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Anyone have any tips on this, maybe some existing code that does this=\r\n ?\n&gt; \n&gt; Kristian\n&gt;\n\n\n\n",
