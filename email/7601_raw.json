April 2003 15:08 schrieb javainsel:\n&gt; We use a ERP framework which sit=\r\ns on top of EJB.\n&gt;\n&gt; Does the framework has to provide mock objects for JUn=\r\nit tests?\n&gt;\n&gt; Is it possible to use Mock objects when using a ERP framework=\r\n?\n&gt;\n&gt; And which Mock objects to use? There seem to be many solutions.\nFirst=\r\n: I take this post as a confession that in the previous threads about TDD \n=\r\nvs. DBC you really didn&#39;t know what you were talking of, because if you wer=\r\ne, \nyou wouldn&#39;t ask such questions but instead respond to my posts on thes=\r\ne \nthreads to continue argueing for DBC. The reason for that is not so obvi=\r\nous \nto me. I think positive, so I don&#39;t think you&#39;re a troll, I think it w=\r\nas your \nway to find out how DBC and TDD interact - just say something you&#39;=\r\nre not \nreally convinced of yourself but hold that view to see what argumen=\r\nts are \nagainst it. Please, next time just ask for these arguments instead =\r\nof \nbehaving like a time sink.\n\n\nBasically, mock objects are a certain sub =\r\ngroup of dummy objects.\nThe whole field of dummy objects can be classified =\r\ninto three kinds:\n1. Stub objects which replace the real objects but don&#39;t =\r\nprovide all \nfuncionality.\n2. Dummy objects which just replace the real obj=\r\nects.\n3. Mock objects which are dummy objects or stub objects \n(This helpfu=\r\nl classification is taken from &quot;Unit Tests mit Java&quot; by Johannes \nLink, a r=\r\neally good German book about Unit Testing for TDD in Java using \nJUnit and =\r\nsome extensions and tools)\n\n\nTake java.sql.ResultSet as an example.\nThe rea=\r\nl object would be an implementation of ResultSet provided by a JDBC \nDriver=\r\n.\nA Stub would be a ResultSet implementation that does not provide all feat=\r\nures \nof ResultSets.\nA Dummy would be a ResultSet implementation that provi=\r\ndes all features of \nResultSets but replaces the ResultSet of a JDBC driver=\r\n within the test \nbecause it is more convenient to test a class using a Res=\r\nultSet without a \nreal database connection.\nA Mock would be a Stub or more =\r\na Dummy which provides additional features like \ngenerating statistics abou=\r\nt the usage of the ResultSet, which could be logged \nto a Logger (file, net=\r\nwork or whatsoever) when the .close() or .finalize() \nmethod is invoked, an=\r\nd that way could tell wether\na) All rows of the ResultSet were iterated ove=\r\nr\nb) All columns of the ResultSet were read\nc) The ResultSet was correctly =\r\nclosed or closing was omitted\n\nWhile a Dummy would behave somewhat normal, =\r\nsince it&#39;s task is to just replace \nthe real object, a Mock object could al=\r\nso influence the test. The Mock \nResultSet e.g. could be instructed to thro=\r\nw an SQLException on the third \ninvocation of next() to verify wether the C=\r\nUT/OUT correctly deals with \nexceptions.\n\n\nNow to your questions:\n&gt; Does th=\r\ne framework has to provide mock objects for JUnit tests?\nNo, it&#39;s not requi=\r\nred that the framework provides the mock objects. But it \nwould be helpful.=\r\n\nToday, most frameworks do not provide Dummies or Mocks. Some frameworks \np=\r\nrovide stubs, like &quot;javax.swing.table.AbstractTableModel&quot; for \n&quot;javax.swing=\r\n.table.TableModel&quot;.\n\n&gt; Is it possible to use Mock objects when using a ERP =\r\nframework?\nThat depends on wether the framework deserves the name framework=\r\n or not.\nA real framework consists of two parts: The API/SPI and the implem=\r\nentation. If \nthe framework is a real framework, you could simply implement=\r\n the API/SPI \nyourself to create mock objects and replace the implementatio=\r\nn.\n\nBut your questions do not provide the information *where* and *why* you=\r\n want \nto use Mock objects. So you program using the ERP API yourself? Or i=\r\ns it just \na code generation tool like Versata?\n\nProviding complete mock ob=\r\njects can be really elaborate. In most cases, you \ndon&#39;t provide full featu=\r\nred mock objects based on dummies, but mock objects \nbased on stubs providi=\r\nng all required features.\n\n\nBye\n- -- \nITCQIS GmbH\nChristian Wolfgang Hujer\n=\r\nGesch=E4ftsf=FChrender Gesellschafter\nTelefon: +49  (0)89  27 37 04 37\nTele=\r\nfax: +49  (0)89  27 37 04 39\nE-Mail: Christian.Hujer@...\nWWW: http:/=\r\n/www.itcqis.com/\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: GnuPG v1.0.7 (GNU/L=\r\ninux)\n\niD8DBQE+kqlczu6h7O/MKZkRAiLRAJ9V3uHqCZRNb9yO+Wjzr8EDSTLikwCeOLFO\nMeR=\r\nnrKaHeBD69sX7JzTU01k=3D\n=3DyvDF\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n\n",
