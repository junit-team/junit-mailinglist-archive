Once you&#39;ve gotten the object, you\n&gt; then run your series of unit tests on that object.  \n\nIt sounds like you can use the Parameterized Test Case idea. In your \ncustom suite() method, perform the above to build a test for each record \nin your batch.\n\n&gt; YOu can check\n&gt; that data is still there, to verifying that the JSP page that\n&gt; accesses this object contains everything that it is supposed to.  The\n&gt; one thing to note is that the record is not a row, it&#39;s a BLOB which\n&gt; can be accessed through accessor objects to get the data.\n\nI don&#39;t think this is important. Somewhere you have a method that uses \nyour accessor objects to retrieve the information for a (logical) row. \nThat&#39;s all that matters.\n\n&lt;snip /&gt;\n&gt; What I&#39;m seeing in your post, is that I may be a bit too\n&gt; ambitious/backwards. :)  Perhaps I need to send the batch into the\n&gt; test and then iterate through each record rather than iterate through\n&gt; each record and pass it into each test.\n\nEither would work; however, I would prefer the latter, since in that \ncase, each record would execute as its own test -- and you want to \nexecute a test for each record.\n\n&gt; I was asking about where I might place the code to open and close the\n&gt; DB connection so I don&#39;t lose the connection while I&#39;m trying to\n&gt; ulimately get to the record.  I don&#39;t want to open and close the\n&gt; connection for each record. :)\n\nWrap it in a singleton, then.\n\n&lt;snip /&gt;\n&gt; I don&#39;t know if this makes any more sence..but hopefully it helps to\n&gt; clarify.\n\nI believe that I understood enough to give you better advice. I hope it \nhelps.\n-- \nJ. B. Rainsberger,\nDiaspar Software Services\nhttp://www.diasparsoftware.com :: +1 416 791-8603\nLet&#39;s write software that people understand\n\n",
