Unfortunately, I landed at the\n&gt; position of &quot;tester&quot; which allows me to request minor changes in code,\n&gt; but not changing the whole philosophy of project.\n&gt;   Although I don&#39;t generally do &quot;off-topic&quot; posts.\n\nSo if you&#39;re stuck using floating-point numbers, then I go back to my \nearlier advice. If you also can&#39;t add equals() to the class you&#39;re \ntesting, then you are indeed stuck pulling apart the values from each \nclass and checking them individually. This statement is true whether \nthey&#39;re floating point or not.\n\nI don&#39;t mean to be rude, so please interpret what I&#39;m about to say in \nthe nicest possible way. I don&#39;t understand why /any/ project would ask \nnon-coders (or people who can code, but are not allowed to code on the \nproject, like testers) to test any code with JUnit. That misses the \nwhole point of what JUnit is for. JUnit is not a testing tool in the \ntraditional testing sense. Trying to test code with JUnit /almost \nalways/ results in identifying design problems that impede code-level \ntesting, and so JUnit is more of a design tool than anything else. If \nall you want to do is automate external (QA-style) tests, then why are \nthose tests at the code level? Why aren&#39;t they at the product level \nusing tools like WinRunner or Silk Performer?\n\nAre you in a position and do you have the courage to communicate that \nkind of message to your project&#39;s manager? or your testing department \nmanager? If it helps, you have one of the world&#39;s experts on the topic \ngiving you the information. :) [The people on this list can vouch for me.]\n\nGood luck.\n-- \nJ. B.
