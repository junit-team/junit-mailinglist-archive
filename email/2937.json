I think the benefits of a similar approach<br/>\nare going to be most obvious when working within a<br/>\nteam. Remember, we&#39;re looking to reduce code-ownership<br/>\nso we have to write clear, standard code. If<br/>\ndevelopers were all off writing their own types of<br/>\ntests that got executed in different ways then when i<br/>\nwas assigned the task of working on your work units<br/>\nnot only would i have to figure out &quot;what&quot; i would<br/>\nalso have to spend time on &quot;how&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, even if you dont use JUnit if you&#39;re working in a<br/>\ngroup you will need to enforce/recommend some sort of<br/>\nstandards around unit testing your code and you&#39;ll<br/>\nfind when you do this that there is much similiarity<br/>\namong your tests so you may as well abstract that to a<br/>\nbase class so that you&#39;re not duplicating<br/>\neffort...hey, we&#39;re building a framework...why build<br/>\nit? You need it. It exists (JUnit) and the price is<br/>\nright (free).<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess i am saying you dont NEED to use JUnit. You&#39;re<br/>\nabsolutely right...you can write your own tests in a<br/>\nplain class...but there are many advantages to a<br/>\nstructured approach to unit testing and the guys that<br/>\ndeveloped JUnit were pretty smart and have thought of<br/>\nmost of the components of unit testing for us. So why<br/>\nnot take advantage?<br/>\n<br/>\nPatrick<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- venkatesh srinivasan &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:venky_gct@...\">venky_gct@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Hi Folks<br/>\n&gt; I am having a basic question..!<br/>\n&gt; Why should i go for JUnit testing Framework which i<br/>\n&gt; can accompolish in plain java class.?<br/>\n&gt; See what ever i am writing inside a test case<br/>\n&gt; funtion<br/>\n&gt; , i can write it in a plain java class which doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; extend TestCase class?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; For example if i want to write a testcase for an EJB<br/>\n&gt; i<br/>\n&gt; have to write a lookup initialisation function in <br/>\n&gt; setUp() method....and write a test case function for<br/>\n&gt; each test behaviour...right?<br/>\n&gt; This i can accomoplish using plain java class which<br/>\n&gt; can execute different user defined function!!!!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Now if anyone you can tell a solid reason/scenario<br/>\n&gt; for<br/>\n&gt; which i have to use JUnit test framework, i will be<br/>\n&gt; very much thankful...and most of the beginners can<br/>\n&gt; have a clear understanding...........<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanx and Regards, <br/>\n&gt; Venky<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; __________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; Make a great connection at Yahoo!
