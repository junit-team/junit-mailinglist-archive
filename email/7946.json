Read Goedel.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe bottom line is that such a metric would have to measure every <br/>\nsingle possible path through all legal programs. In order to do that, <br/>\nthe measuring program would need to know whether the algorithms in the <br/>\nprograms every terminate--- something which Goedel proved is impossible <br/>\nin the general case.<br/>\n<br/>\nCoverage analysis can get close if several metrics are used in <br/>\ncombination. Brian Marrick goes through this in detail in The Craft of <br/>\nSoftware Testing. But even if a perfect metric were possible, as <br/>\nanother poster pointed out, a coverage metric will not tell you if a <br/>\nparticular line, expression, or branch is necessary at all or fits into <br/>\nthe system as a whole. Test-first does a much better job of eliminating <br/>\nunnecessary coverage by eliminating unnecessary code.<br/>\n<br/>\nUse coverage analysis as a tool to gain insight about what your code <br/>\nand tests are doing. Use your wits to determine what tests to add (or <br/>\ncode to remove). Train your wits by gaining experience and reading good <br/>\nbooks. Nothing will do the job for you.</div>",
