JUnit 4.4 does include method annotations<br/>\nin the Description, which should help one of your frustrations.  Were<br/>\nyou using the default JUnit that ships with Eclipse (currently 4.3.1)?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounds like you also wanted to allow users to register a listener<br/>\nregardless of how the tests were run, which TestNG does with a<br/>\ncommand-line parameter, and JUnit currently does not support.  This<br/>\nsounds like a valuable feature--is a command-line parameter the ideal<br/>\nway to do it?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe default runners for JUnit classes should be out of &quot;internal&quot;<br/>\nstatus soon.  We focused first on making it possible to run any<br/>\nconceivable set of tests from JUnit, especially crazy stuff (such as<br/>\nRuby tests: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://johlrogge.wordpress.com/2007/09/08/hybrid-theory/)\">http://johlrogge.wordpress.com/2007/09/08/hybrid-theory/)</a>.<br/>\n A major focus of 4.5 is making it easier to make finer-grained<br/>\nextensions to JUnit&#39;s built-in runners, without touching internals.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne more favor--can you explain how FEST currently was capturing<br/>\nscreenshots from JUnit, and why that didn&#39;t work when running tests<br/>\nfrom Eclipse?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again,<br/>\n<br/>\n   David Saff<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Nov 19, 2007 12:52 PM, Alex Ruiz &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:alruiz15@...\">alruiz15@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Greetings,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This past weekend I tried to extend JUnit 4 and it was a very<br/>\n&gt; frustrating experience.
