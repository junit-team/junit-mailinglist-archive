We&#39;=\r\nve completely converted - sorry for misleading the topic.\n\nHowever, this le=\r\naves me somewhat further afield with specifying more\nthan one test method t=\r\no be run using the JUnit 4 APIs. I&#39;ve looked\nthrough the classes, even rege=\r\nnerating the Javadoc, and can&#39;t find\nanything. I&#39;m very confused (and a lit=\r\ntle frustrated) because the\nclasses or methods I want to use are either und=\r\nocumented (no Javadoc)\nor marked for internal use only.\n\nAny suggestions?\n\n=\r\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Michael Schechter&quot; &lt;bard@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Tha=\r\nt&#39;s odd - it works just fine for me. However, trying to filter on\n&gt; more th=\r\nan one method doesn&#39;t seem to be intuitively obvious, and\n&gt; nothing really =\r\nseems to work.\n&gt; \n&gt; The code I use to get one test to run is as follows (it=\r\n&#39;s from the\n&gt; test class&#39;s main() method):\n&gt;     JUnitCore core =3D new JUn=\r\nitCore();\n&gt;     Request testRequest =3D Request.method(aTestClass, someArgu=\r\nments[0]);\n&gt;     core.run(testRequest);\n&gt; \n&gt; I have no idea how to extend t=\r\nhis model to being able to specify\n&gt; multiple methods, however.\n&gt; \n&gt; In add=\r\nition, I really hope that someone starts documenting all of the\n&gt; nifty new=\r\n features in JUnit 4.x - the current level is somewhat\n&gt; (frustratingly) in=\r\ncomplete. The basic features have been covered by a\n&gt; number of writers - t=\r\nhe more complex, such as this issue, still seem\n&gt; to be missing.\n&gt; \n&gt; I thi=\r\nnk JUnit has the potential to become even more popular with a\n&gt; clearer exa=\r\nmination of the framework on which it is built. There seems\n&gt; to be a great=\r\n deal of power and flexibility available - it&#39;s just\n&gt; really unclear as to=\r\n how to get at it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks in advance!\n&gt; \n&gt; Michael Schechter\n&gt; \n&gt; --- =\r\nIn junit@yahoogroups.com, David Saff &lt;saff@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Shannon,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; You are right--this doesn&#39;t currently work in JUnit 4.1.  Could you\n&gt; op=\r\nen \n&gt; &gt; a tracker issue on the sourceforge page, and we&#39;ll see if this can =\r\nbe \n&gt; &gt; remedied in a future version?  Thanks,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;     David Saff\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; Shannon wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Greetings,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m trying to filter a JUn=\r\nit 3.8x test case class using the 4.1\n&gt; &gt; &gt; runner, so that only one of the=\r\n test methods in the class is run and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the others are ignored. I creat=\r\ne and run the test like this:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Request r =3D Request.method(OldS=\r\ntyleTestCase.class,\n&quot;testSomeMethod&quot;);\n&gt; &gt; &gt; jcore.run(r);\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The =\r\noutcome is that all test methods are run, not just the one test\n&gt; &gt; &gt; metho=\r\nd I specified. I also tried using a custom filter, but the\nfilter\n&gt; &gt; &gt; nev=\r\ner gets called because the runner for this class is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; org.junit.interna=\r\nl.runners.OldTestClassRunner which does not\nimplement\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Filter.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Do I need to write my own runner to get this to work? Is there\nanother=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; work around?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks for any help.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; /Shannon\n&gt;=\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
