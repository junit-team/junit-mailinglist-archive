Being a newbie in unit testing it&#39;s being hard to me to do it, but who said that life have to be easy?\n\nSeriously, the current version available is for WO 4.0, numbered 0.9, and it&#39;s a somehow abandoned project. &#39;Somehow&#39; means that the author (Michael Jonhston) said that he is more interested into develop a functional testing framework rather than a unit testing one right now.\nI have made the porting from 4.0 version to 5.0, the one I&#39;m using. About the use of unit tests in WO there&#39;s a thread in the omnigroup list that I figure you have read. \n\nYou can e-mail me for any question. I&#39;ll be glad of sharing my testing pains with anybody :).\n\nSanti\n\n--- In junit@y..., Michael Finney &lt;finney@A...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; I hear there is a WOUnit in town somewhere.
