I have a testing scenario I need help with. The application I\nam working on has a class called AppProperties. This class has a lot\nof static methods on it for loading properties files and getting\nproperties back out:\n\npublic void loadProperties() {\n   //reads properties from classpath\n   AppProperties.addResource(&quot;app.properties&quot;);\n   AppProperties.addResource(&quot;MessageResources.properties&quot;);\n}\n\npublic void performTest() {\n   boolean test = AppProperties.getBoolean(&quot;app.perform.test&quot;);\n   if (test) {\n      ...\n   }\n}\n\nThis scenario is not very testable. I like the idea of a static class\nto pull application properties from, but it makes testing more\ndifficult. I could load the AppProperties object in the setUp (that is\nmy solution to get it working until I get better suggestions), but it\nseems like the app should be designed a little differently. How would\nsomething like this be handled in IoC (DI) projects? \n\nThanks for any input.\n\nMichael.\n\n\n\n\n\n",
