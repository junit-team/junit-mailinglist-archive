Over the next\nfew weeks I&#39;m going to posting several of them for the benefit of \nanyone else who wants to use them.  I would love to hear any feedback \nyou have to give.\n\nStarting with something extremely simple:  here&#39;s a way to run all\nthe tests in your suite in random order.\n  \nWhy would you want to do this?  For one, it helps ensure that no\ntests are making assumptions about the order they&#39;re run in.  Also, \nusing RandomTestSuites inside ActiveTestSuites can help identify race \nconditions that might not have come up otherwise.  (And maybe we just \n*like* running them randomly, okay?!)\n\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/junit/files/RandomTestSuite.java\n\nEnjoy,\nKevin\n\n\n\n",
