Can you please share your thoughts?\n\nSure: 100% line/branch coverage is impossible to achieve. Even if it \nwere possible, it&#39;s not worth the effort. Example:\n\nJDBC driver throws SQLException, which is checked. In my code, I have to \ndo this:\n\ntry {\n     useJdbcDriver();\n}\ncatch (SQLException e) {\n     // What to do here?\n}\n\nWell, my default checked exception handler is this:\n\ntry {\n     useJdbcDriver();\n}\ncatch (SQLException wrapped) {\n     throw new RuntimeException(\n         &quot;Something went wrong when I used the database&quot;, wrapped);\n}\n\nThere are two problems with this:\n\n1. It takes an obscene amount of effort to simulate (or recreate) the \nconditions under which the JDBC driver throws an SQLException.\n\nThe vast, vast majority of the time, I don&#39;t handle those exceptions \nanyway, but rather pass them up the chain. To avoid coupling myself to \nmy caller, I turn the checked exception into an unchecked one.\n\n2. Java /forces/ me to duplicate that exception handler everywhere \nthroughout my code, although I /could/ get a little better with\n\n     ExceptionHandler.shush(\n         &quot;Something went wrong when I used the database&quot;, shushed);\n\nStill, I have to duplicate /that/ everywhere, but I certainly don&#39;t need \nto test it everywhere I use it. The only thing that changes is the \nexplanation message, and I never write code that depends on that text in \nany meaningful way.\n\nBoth of these make it unusually expensive to test-drive this code, \ncompared to the benefit I get from test-driving it. As a result, I have \njudged that it&#39;s not worth the effort, so I don&#39;t do it.\n\nI hope that helps.\n-- \nJ. B.
