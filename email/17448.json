If the developer is<br/>\n&gt; experienced, she will produce testable code, whether she uses TDD or not.<br/>\n&gt;   <br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;ll agree with the first claim, having produced plenty of testable code <br/>\nprior to doing TDD. The more I&#39;ve done TDD--*and* the more I&#39;ve improved <br/>\nmy knowledge of what makes a good design--the easier it&#39;s become to <br/>\nwrite non-TDD code that was testable.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, the second claim is simply not true. I&#39;ve seen plenty of code <br/>\nwritten by &quot;experienced&quot; developers that was not easily testable, even <br/>\nthough everyone agreed that it exhibited what they thought was a good <br/>\ndesign. That includes some of the non-TDD code I&#39;ve written (even after <br/>\nhaving done TDD).<br/>\n<br/>\nUltimately, there are billions of lines of difficult-to-test code out <br/>\nthere, some of it written by extremely experienced programmers. The best <br/>\nway to learn how to build testable code--if that&#39;s important to you--is <br/>\nto try and write tests for everything. Whether you do that test-first or <br/>\ntest-after is up to you (or maybe your team). I find it far easier to do <br/>\ntest-first.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; And as an experienced developer, she will always consider all her options<br/>\n&gt; before picking a methodology, which is always more healthy than saying &quot;I do<br/>\n&gt; TDD 100% of the time&quot;.<br/>\n&gt;   <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Most of the people that believe in TDD try to do it 100% of the time <br/>\nbecause they derive a considerable amount of benefit from it (and oddly, <br/>\nbecause they enjoy it). As JB mentions, the best tactic for less <br/>\nexperienced programmers is to try to do everything TDD. With more <br/>\nexperience, perhaps then they could consider backing off of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI still try to do it 100%. It&#39;s a goal for me, not an absolute. I derive <br/>\na considerable increase in development speed from doing this, so I&#39;m <br/>\nbaffled at the continuing claims that it&#39;s &quot;unhealthy&quot; or <br/>\n&quot;unprofessional.&quot; It&#39;s also never been at the expense of the customer or <br/>\nthe schedule. (It can be, if the developers don&#39;t practice it well, <br/>\nsomething I&#39;ve seen in at least one fiasco of a project.) When I back off:<br/>\n- I lose some amount of documentation-by-example<br/>\n- I don&#39;t always make the best decisions that will allow me to <br/>\neffectively test after<br/>\n- I lose some ability to easily introduce new functionality in the code<br/>\n- I increase my risk level of making a future change that breaks <br/>\nsomething elsewhere in the system.<br/>\n- I increase the time I spend having to debug the code<br/>\n<br/>\nBut hey, that&#39;s just me. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s productive to try and <br/>\nconvince people that want to continue to make excuses for not doing <br/>\nsomething. Programmers need to use their best judgment. For me, I view <br/>\ncode that can&#39;t be easily proven to work as ultimately very costly (I <br/>\ncould say close to useless, but that would just get people upset).<br/>\n<br/>\nJeff Langr<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nLangr Software Solutions<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://langrsoft.com\">http://langrsoft.com</a><br/>\nAgile Java: Crafting Code With Test-Driven Development</div>",
