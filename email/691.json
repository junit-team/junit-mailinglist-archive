I can see<br/>\nall the benefits about using JUnit but I think there must be some<br/>\nconstraints behind it...:-). With my little knowledge of Junit and i<br/>\ndon&#39;t have much ideas of the JUnit contraints unless for those experts<br/>\nlike you has implemented it on an applications.<br/>\n    Therefore,  it would be much appreciate if experts can provide me<br/>\nthe JUnit constraints which you have implemented using JUnit on an<br/>\napplication. This will guide me to certain extend JUnit can go before i<br/>\npropose to my boss about using JUnit for testing framework.<br/>\n     Once last question, is there any constraints on JUnit and Ant tools<br/>\n<br/>\n?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,</div>",
