EMMA does everything we&#39;ve\n&gt; needed so far, and so I don&#39;t feel a=\r\nny design to change.\n&gt; But there are definitely other good coverage tools o=\r\nut\n&gt; there, too.\n&gt;\n&gt; The cost of implementation is very low, as is the cost=\r\n\n&gt; of switching.  So why not go with EMMA for now and if\n&gt; you find it does=\r\nn&#39;t do something you need, switch it\n&gt; out later?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Todd.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n",
