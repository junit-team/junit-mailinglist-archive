What I mean:<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m automating some tests on a legacy batch-mode app that runs<br/>\nremotely. This app runs headlessly, emitting tons &#39;o files to a<br/>\nfilespace, so basically I&#39;m automating<br/>\n<br/>\n* invoking the app (setting up its inputs)<br/>\n<br/>\n* waiting for it to finish<br/>\n<br/>\n* verifying the output<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst I wrote some classes to setup for and invoke the app. I know<br/>\nenough Ant to JAR this code up, so I wrote a build.xml (in eclipse)<br/>\nfor that, built the JAR, deployed it to one of the app&#39;s boxes (this<br/>\nis the kind of app that bogs down one&#39;s laptop if run locally), and<br/>\nran it with `java -jar ...`, so I know that works.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen I wrote a JUnit test that calls the code that calls the app, and<br/>\nrebuilt the JAR (from eclipse). Eclipse compiled the new JUnit-using<br/>\nclass OK, and included that class in the JAR it built, but the JAR<br/>\ndoes not contain junit.jar or any of its classes. So to deploy the<br/>\nnew JAR, I just unzipped junit.jar on top of my JAR&#39;s contents,<br/>\nchanged the Main-Class in its manifest, and re-JARed, deployed, and ran.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat worked, but ugly. How best to tell Ant to include make available<br/>\neither &lt;project name&gt;/lib/junit.jar or its contents in the output JAR?</div>",
