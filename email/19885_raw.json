Ideally, I&#39;d like to be able to break down =\r\nthe JUnit results\n&gt; &gt; that can be filtered, aggregated, and so forth for re=\r\nports.\n\nKirk, DevCreek can show a detailed review of the past day&#39;s testing=\r\n\nand also historical charts with trending information. The complete\nhistory=\r\n of test run and test method executions are recorded for each\ndeveloper on =\r\nthe team. Every test run inside of the developer&#39;s IDE is\nrecorded rather t=\r\nhan just those triggered by the build process after\ncheck-in. We have an Ec=\r\nlipse Java plug-in ready for use with JUnit,\nand a web API to collect JUnit=\r\n or other metrics from outside of\nEclipse. We would be happy to work with y=\r\nou if you are using JUnit\nfrom an alternative IDE or text editor. If you ar=\r\ne happy sharing your\ndata with the community then the service is free to us=\r\ne.\n\nhttp://devcreek.com\n\nYou can get detailed feedback on your recent testi=\r\nng either in Eclipse\nor on the website. We present each executed test run, =\r\nwhether it was\nsuccessful or not and the number of tests involved. This can=\r\n help you\nto become more aware of how you are testing, alert you when you a=\r\nre\nstraying from your preferred behaviour (for example when you are lost\nin=\r\n the debugger for hours on end rather than writing a new test), or\nact as a=\r\n measure for adopting a new testing style. We also show some\nsimple heurist=\r\nics and a list of added test methods. The intention is\nthat this data can f=\r\need back into your own and your team&#39;s learning\npractices.\n\nI haven&#39;t done =\r\nmuch coding the last few days, but feel free to get an\nidea of the recorded=\r\n activity by looking at the DevCreek project\nitself (TestCreek is an earlie=\r\nr project name for DevCreek):\n\nProject activity: https://devcreek.com/proje=\r\nct/TestCreek\n\nMy own testing activity:\nhttps://devcreek.com/principalActivi=\r\nty/TestCreek/DGJ\n\nThe other side is historical charts. We keep a history of=\r\n the test\nexecutions for the entire duration of the project. We have number=\r\n of\nbuilt-in reports that \n\ncover a range of testing analyses. For example =\r\ntotal test methods,\nfrequency of test run \n\nexecutions, test durations, res=\r\nults and so on. We also have some\nreports that get closer to \n\nquality and =\r\nprocess measures such as time taken to fix broken tests,\nthe cost for addin=\r\ng a \n\nnew test method (by number of executed tests/new test method), testin=\r\ng\nby hour-of-day or \n\nday-of-week and so on.\n\nCurrently there isn&#39;t much co=\r\nntrol over filtering and manipulating\nthese charts though we intend to move=\r\n to a more interactive mechanism.\n You can download your project&#39;s data as =\r\nXML for custom analysis. You\ncan also explore any of the open projects to l=\r\nearn how they are\ntesting. We have collected about 25 person years of testi=\r\nng activity\nso far. This sort of \n\ndata is so new, we are all still explori=\r\nng the\nspace to find the gems, so getting as many people involved as possib=\r\nle\nis very useful.\n\nHere are the reports collected so far during the develo=\r\npment of\nDevCreek itself:\n\nhttps://devcreek.com/reports/projects/TestCreek/=\r\nindex.html\n\nAll of the open projects, such as DevCreek/TestCreek, are open =\r\nto the\npublic for us all to learn from. Feel free to click around.\n\nWe have=\r\n also put together a short animation of the first nine months\nof testing wh=\r\nile developing DevCreek. It&#39;s not a report but does\nattempt to provide an a=\r\nlternative kind of view onto the development\nprocess.\n\nhttps://community.de=\r\nvcreek.com/space/David+Jones/blog/2007-09-10_1\n\n\nIf you have any questions =\r\nabout JUnit integration, or alternative\nreports please ask.\n\nCheers\nDavid J=\r\nones\n\n\n\n",
