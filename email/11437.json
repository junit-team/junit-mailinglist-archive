Here&#39;s the situation:<br/>\n<br/>\n    1. I have a test that I know, if it fails, many other tests will<br/>\n    produce invalid results.<br/>\n<br/>\n    2. In most cases, if I fix only this test, all the other tests will<br/>\n    then pass, too.<br/>\n<br/>\n    3. It may well be possible, us being programmers and all, to explain<br/>\n    this to the computer, so that we as humans do not have to do the<br/>\n    tedious work of searching through a lot of errors for the one<br/>\n    &quot;important&quot; one.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo which of these two is the correct conclusion?<br/>\n<br/>\n    A. We should try to find a simple way of explaining this to the<br/>\n    computer, so that we as humans save time and effort.<br/>\n<br/>\n    B. We should forget about improving the current system, and continue<br/>\n    to do a tedious search through the manual list, justifying this by<br/>\n    coming up with various excuses as to how other things should be<br/>\n    fixed.<br/>\n<br/>\nI suppose this really divides us up into three sorts of people. Those<br/>\nwho can find a solution to A, those who can&#39;t and are thus forced to<br/>\ncontinue with B, and those who do not want to find a solution to A. I<br/>\ncan tell you right now, I&#39;m B at the moment, but I have hope at some<br/>\npoint of getting to to A. I invite the rest of you to consider which<br/>\nof these types of person you are.<br/>\n<br/>\ncjs<br/>\n-- <br/>\nCurt Sampson  &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cjs@...\">cjs@...</a>&gt;   +81 90 7737 2974   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.NetBSD.org\">http://www.NetBSD.org</a><br/>\n    Don&#39;t you know, in this new Dark Age, we&#39;re all light.  --XTC</div>",
