I&#39;d enjoy helping with =\r\nthe\neffort when the time comes. I&#39;m an old Java guy still, despite my recen=\r\nt\nfocus on Scala, and I could bring some experience of actually using in a\n=\r\ntesting context features similar to those that will be made available to a\n=\r\nJUnit 5 via Java 8 (lamdas, extension methods, etc.).\n\nBill\n\nOn Wed, Dec 19=\r\n, 2012 at 1:57 AM, Malte Finsterwalder &lt;\nmalte@...&gt; wrote:\n\n=\r\n&gt; **\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi David,\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; On 18 December 2012 18:35, David Saff &lt;saff@goog=\r\nle.com&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thinking more about this, I think that what defines JU=\r\nnit, as Neale\n&gt; points\n&gt; &gt; out, is its philosophy, and the community of peo=\r\nple who buy into that\n&gt; &gt; philosophy. So I think that when considering a ne=\r\nw version, we could\n&gt; &gt; certainly consider strongly following the design ex=\r\namples of other\n&gt; &gt; frameworks, like Jumi or others, but in the end, a JUni=\r\nt 5 would be built\n&gt; &gt; piece by piece by submissions to this community.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; JUnit for me is still the de facto standard for unit testing in Java.\n=\r\n&gt; It&#39;s integrated in all the major IDEs from the start.\n&gt; It&#39;s known by pre=\r\ntty much every Java Developer.\n&gt; Even if they don&#39;t use it or don&#39;t use it =\r\nwell, it&#39;s still the first unit\n&gt; testing framework that comes to mind.\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n This has probably to do with the trust in the people who guide and develop=\r\n\n&gt; JUnit. But I really don&#39;t know\n&gt; Moving towards JUnit 5 I think it will =\r\nbe hard to to loose this status, I\n&gt; think.\n&gt;\n&gt; When it makes sense to use =\r\nan existing library (and licences allow), I see\n&gt; no principal problem in r=\r\neusing something like Jumi for JUnit 5.\n&gt; I have no idea, whether that make=\r\ns sense at all, since I didn&#39;t look into\n&gt; Jumi.\n&gt; I just don&#39;t think that =\r\nJUnit 5 should necessarily be &quot;built piece by piece\n&gt;\n&gt; by submissions to t=\r\nhis community&quot;.\n&gt; Using Hamcrest inside JUnit 4 was a great move and it is =\r\nan external\n&gt; library.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; I think also that the compatibility between =\r\nJUnit 3 and JUnit 4 was\n&gt; &gt; instrumental in making it useful for teams, and=\r\n I&#39;d like to see a similar\n&gt; &gt; focus on backward compatibility moving forwa=\r\nrd.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I also think, that backwards compatibility for executing JUnit =\r\n4 Tests at\n&gt; least is a must.\n&gt; If I can&#39;t gracefully migrate towards JUnit=\r\n 5 I would have a problem and\n&gt; many other as well.\n&gt; I&#39;m not sure whether =\r\nwe still need JUnit 3 support, though.\n&gt; JUnit 4 is old enough, that I thin=\r\nk we could kill JUnit 3 if that makes\n&gt; things easier.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; One last tho=\r\nught: one of the biggest confusions about JUnit 4 was the\n&gt; fact\n&gt; &gt; that i=\r\nt was both a version number referring to a new release of a\n&gt; software\n&gt; &gt; =\r\npackage, _and_ the only useful name for the collection of new libraries\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n included in that release. Starting in JUnit 5, I think a different naming\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; scheme would be quite helpful. Choosing a scheme that I&#39;m positive we\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; _won&#39;t_ use, for example:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; - The runner and interfaces introduced=\r\n in JUnit &lt;=3D 3 would be JUnit\n&gt; Cupcake\n&gt; &gt; - The runner and interfaces i=\r\nntroduced in JUnit 4 would be JUnit Donut\n&gt; &gt; - The runner and interfaces i=\r\nntroduced in JUnit 5 would be JUnit Eclair\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I think JUnit 4 was a gr=\r\neat naming.\n&gt; I made clear, that the new software release also brough the n=\r\new libraries.\n&gt; I don&#39;t see that as a problem.\n&gt;\n&gt; And doing the same with =\r\nJUnit 5 would be consistent with that.\n&gt; So when JUnit 5 changes the interf=\r\nace for tests and also brings a new\n&gt; release (of course) I would still cal=\r\nl it JUnit 5 and everyone should know\n&gt; what&#39;s meant.\n&gt; I think it would be=\r\n much more confusing If you started to introduce two\n&gt; names. One for the s=\r\noftware release version and one for the interface.\n&gt; Then I would have to s=\r\nay something like: I use JUnit 5 but I&#39;m writing\n&gt; JUnit Donut style tests?=\r\n And who can remember those strange names anyways?\n&gt; Do you remember the la=\r\nst two names of Eclipse and can sort them? Or any\n&gt; other product that uses=\r\n naming for that matter?\n&gt; I can&#39;t.\n&gt; But I can easily remember JUnit 3, 4 =\r\nand 5. And I have no problem in\n&gt; stating that I use JUnit 5 with JUnit 4 s=\r\ntyle tests.\n&gt;\n&gt; On the other hand I strongly believe that, whatever you do,=\r\n it will work\n&gt; out ok for two reasons:\n&gt; 1) JUnit is just too established =\r\nand too well known.\n&gt; 2) I trust in Kent and you, to stear JUnit in a good =\r\ndirection and to\n&gt; listen to the community.\n&gt;\n&gt; Greetings,\n&gt; Malte\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; [N=\r\non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n\n-- \nBill Ven=\r\nners\nArtima, Inc.\nhttp://www.artima.com\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this messag=\r\ne have been removed]\n\n\n",
