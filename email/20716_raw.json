Up to now I am not sure what to expect of it. With \n&gt; my little =\r\nexperience I only see the problem of provoking all \n&gt; possible error cases,=\r\n e.g.:\n&gt; \n&gt; client.login(user, pass) // illegal arguments, authentication \n=\r\n&gt; error, timeout ..?\n&gt; \n&gt; But as I said, I do not know, which help EasyMock=\r\n offers me \n&gt; in these cases.\n\nMock frameworks will help you in cases, when=\r\n you want to manipulate\nthe indirect outputs and inputs of a unit. Assuming=\r\n your login example\nuses a connection object, this connection object will p=\r\nrovide outputs\nfor the client (exceptions, login...) as well as expecting\ni=\r\nnputs (connection parameters, network...). But these outputs and\ninputs are=\r\n all indirect, so the client can&#39;t directly control.\n\nTo control these inpu=\r\nts anyway - maybe to test how the client reacts\non connection errors - you =\r\nmay use an object that substitutes the\nreal connection object. Usally you k=\r\nnow the main exception cases,\nyou are able to handle in your objects method=\r\n. All other exceptions\nare thrown through or you have to catch them at a de=\r\neper level.\n\nMock frameworks offer different substitutes for the real objec=\r\nt.\nJB already mentioned it, if you hide the real implementation\ndetails beh=\r\nind interfaces, its easy to substitute, manipulate,\ncontrol etc. a dependen=\r\nd component.\n\nAnd thats it what you realy want: Isolate your unit and contr=\r\nol\nit in a well definied environment to test all assumption as well\nas unsu=\r\nfficiencies, for example different exceptions, you except\nin your method an=\r\nd you can handle at this point.\n\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Whole&quot; sounds like a megajob, thats n=\r\not a good practice in unit \n&gt; &gt; testing. Maybe the lifecycle is a separate =\r\nobject that controls \n&gt; &gt; different tasks; the connections and fetchers are=\r\n \n&gt; serviceobjects that \n&gt; &gt; do something with your data objects.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; It=\r\n sounds more than it is in my case. Such kinds of importers \n&gt; often are on=\r\nly some glue between data formats (xml/ db), \n&gt; connection handling (gettin=\r\ng the data from a to\n&gt; b) and much reboust\n&gt; exception handling and logging=\r\n.\n&gt; Sometimes - when I really think about which class should do \n&gt; what in =\r\ncontrast to others - I tend to code over-ambitioned. \n&gt; This leads to many =\r\nclasses which really do their\n&gt; job: connection handlers,\n&gt; value or transf=\r\ner objects, data mappers, controllers \n&gt; whatever. And there lies a certain=\r\n beauty, every class does \n&gt; only what it is ment for and even better: it o=\r\nnly knows what \n&gt; i really needs. But for a simple task like &quot;get data from=\r\n a, \n&gt; parse data into structure, put it into place b&quot; this produces \n&gt; lot=\r\ns of classes with perhaps two methods, and some more only \n&gt; for building a=\r\nn abstraction layer - which can be useless if \n&gt; it is not part of another =\r\nbigger architecture.\n&gt; The endprduct can be a less beautyful code, but in b=\r\nest KISS manner.\n\nIf an overall class is a sufficient solution, a simple an=\r\nd stupid\ntestcase may ensure your expectation as well. But...\n\n&gt; &gt; All obje=\r\ncts/units are easilier to test if they have one \n&gt; objectiv, that \n&gt; &gt; you =\r\ncan test separatly.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; Thats the point. I see a difference between =\r\na good practice \n&gt; in Unit Testing and the intention of how the class shoul=\r\nd be \n&gt; used. My FTP Example (very simplified):\n&gt; \n&gt; +FtpImporter(host, por=\r\nt, user, pass)\n&gt; +ImporterObjects[] import() // calls connect()/\n&gt; disconne=\r\nct()\n&gt; -connect()\n&gt; -disconnect()\n&gt; (+ some setters getters for the attribu=\r\ntes)\n&gt; \n&gt; It is clear that this is bad for two reasons:\n&gt; - no flexibility =\r\nin controlling the data-/workflow \n&gt; (especially open, close)\n&gt; - therefore=\r\n a problem in testing\n&gt; \n&gt; But there comes the advantage I mentioned as usa=\r\nge intention:\n&gt; - it is clear how to use the importer\n&gt; - it is very hard t=\r\no bring the class in an invalid state\n&gt; \n&gt; Opening the open/close methods a=\r\nnd offering the standard \n&gt; constructor for later code (configured) injecti=\r\non would offer \n&gt; a way to handle the class wrong:\n\nI&#39;m not really sure if =\r\nits the intended usecase for the Importer\nto assume it has connected/discon=\r\nnected states.\n\n&gt; new FtpImporter().import() // missing connect\n&gt; \n&gt; It wou=\r\nld also need to put extra state validation into the \n&gt; connect/ disconnect =\r\nmethods\n\nThats an assumption or expectation you want to test as well.\nSo I =\r\nsee no real chance to test this aspect as well in another\nway discribed by =\r\nJBR.\n\nTo underline it, its easier to look onto interfaces at the\nfirst step=\r\n and don&#39;t worry about the implementation details.\nFrom my first experience=\r\n it also saves a little time, because\nyou don&#39;t waste your time on the unce=\r\nrtainity of quickly changing\nimplememantions - e.g. today SQL-Database-Pers=\r\nistence, tomorrow\nsome other Persistence.\n\n&gt;  \n&gt; \n\n",
