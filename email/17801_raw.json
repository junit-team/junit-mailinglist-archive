However, as the system starts  \n&gt; to get complicated those simple constructors sometimes become  \n&gt; complications because of the need to have mocks for unit tests. Later  \n&gt; they become even greater complications because of the need to break  \n&gt; or invert dependencies between modules.\n\nAt such point as that becomes a real problem, I&#39;m willing to refactor to \naccomplish this. However in my experience most classes are not reused, \nmost do not need to be mocked, most do not need to be decoupled, and \nvery few classes need multiple implementations.\n\nMy objection is not to using these techniques in the rare cases where \nit&#39;s actually necessary. My objection is to starting by assuming that \nthe simplest thing (concrete classes with constructors) can&#39;t possibly \nwork, and jumping straight into the deep end every time.\n\nIf you need it, fine; but more likely than not you don&#39;t. YAGNI isn&#39;t \njust about features. It&#39;s also about programming techniques. Additional \nlayers of indirection are powerful problem solvers; but they are also \npowerful obfuscators. They should not be introduced gratuitously just \nbecause they might be useful to someone some day.\n\n-- \n﻿Elliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nJava I/O 2nd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeaulait.org/books/javaio2/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596527500/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/\n\n",
