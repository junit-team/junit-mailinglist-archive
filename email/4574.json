However, as you say, there are <br/>\nprobably scenarios in which the more explicit statement is useful.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 08:35 AM 4/3/2002 +0200, you wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Don&#39;t get me wrong I&#39;m a big fan of JUnit and unit testing but...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;...I do regularly have problems using components, which would not have<br/>\n&gt;occurred if there had been clearly stated pre-conditions (admittedly these<br/>\n&gt;components don&#39;t usually come with associated unit tests).<br/>\n&gt;Are a collection of unit tests a clear statement of the contract? I&#39;m not<br/>\n&gt;convinced. I do agree that by rigourously using TFD you will end up with<br/>\n&gt;classes/methods with sweet smelling contracts. However if we consider the<br/>\n&gt;airline metaphor which is often used for DBC: when I&#39;m booking a ticket<br/>\n&gt;with an airline I like to know the conditions which are attached - I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;merely  want a list of previous passengers and how they got on.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Steven Hale, wm-data<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>David Olivier<br/>\nNaval Research Laboratory<br/>\nDigital Mapping, Charting & Geodesy Analysis Program<br/>\nCode 7440.2</div>",
