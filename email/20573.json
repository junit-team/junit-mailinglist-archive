Or you could<br/>\n&gt; start writing a bunch of hand-crafted logging statements since<br/>\n&gt; logging is sometimes more effective than debugging.<br/>\n&gt; But in some cases the assertion log would already be logging what<br/>\n&gt; you need to know without your having to write those statements.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s just another tool that is sometimes useful.
