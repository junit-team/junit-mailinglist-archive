Thus, the goals for code that gets\ninto the junit repository include that it should:\n\n1) Minimize dependencies on external libraries or particular JDK\nversions beyond a widely-used minimum.\n2) Be very unlikely to change API moving forward.\n3) Emphasize opportunities for extension over the richness of core features.\n4) Have potential usefulness to all Java developers, regardless of\ntheir application domain.\n5) Match in style to the current JUnit codebase.\n\nMany people have made JUnit extensions that would be useful to a\nhealthy portion of Java developers, but do not meet all of the above\ncriteria.  For example, the extension may target a particular IDE, or\ndata that is stored in a SQL database, or in XML, or it may be\nexperimental, and likely to change API, or it may require an external\ndependency.  Also, as the popularity of non-Java languages on the JVM\nhas grown, some people have made extensions to JUnit that make it\neasier to use JUnit&#39;s core functionality in ways idiomatic to those\nother languages.\n\nIt has always been an option for developers of these extensions to\npublish them on their own repositories.  However, having a central\nclearing-house as an option for extension developers has some\nadvantages, including discoverability, documentation, and dependency\nmanagement.\n\nThe goal is for junit.contrib (just started on\nhttps://github.com/dsaff/junit.contrib) to be this clearing house.\nAll Java classes in this project should be in packages prefixed with\norg.junit.contrib.\n\nNow, the\n\n=== PROPOSAL ===\n\nThe root structure of the project will contain:\n\n/\n  README\n  docs/\n  java/\n  scala/ [?]\n  clojure/ [?]\n\nThus, a folder for overall documentation, and then a folder\nper-language.  I haven&#39;t thought about how non-java language\nextensions should be organized.\n\nUnder java, there should be a folder per &quot;subproject&quot; (names chosen,\nwith apologies, by http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random):\n\njava/\n  brewmasters/\n  callisto/\n  hekler/\n  norway/\n  ...\n\nEach subproject should be organized as its own maven project:\n\njava/brewmasters/\n  pom.xml\n  src/main/java/org/junit/contrib/brewmasters/...\n  src/test/java/org/junit/contrib/brewmasters/...\n\nAs potential users and contributors to such a repository, are there\npitfalls in this organization that I should be aware of in advance?\nThanks,\n\n   David Saff\n\n",
