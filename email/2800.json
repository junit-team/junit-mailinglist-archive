Over time, it<br/>\nseems that JUnitX and JUnit have grown more different.  What I was wondering<br/>\nwas:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Does JUnit support access to private/protected?   It doesn&#39;t seem like it<br/>\nfrom the latest Javadoc but I could be wrong.<br/>\n2. Were there or are there plans for merging the features and interfaces of<br/>\nthese two versions?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\nnoah<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNoah Green<br/>\nSoftware Engineering Manager<br/>\nThinAirApps, Inc.<br/>\n(212) 343-5032<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:noah.green@...\">noah.green@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThis message and any appended documentation is intended only for the use of<br/>\nthe intended recipient(s) and is proprietary and confidential to<br/>\nThinAirApps, Inc. and may not be disclosed to third parties without the<br/>\nprior written permission of ThinAirApps, Inc.
