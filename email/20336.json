In particular, they have, say, 30 instances of  <br/>\nthe same integration defect--effectively duplicates--and find about 25  <br/>\nof them. They don&#39;t know the other 5 are lurking until a customer  <br/>\npoints it out.<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe that the less we rely on end-to-end tests, the less we&#39;d  <br/>\nallow ourselves to duplicate high-level structures, and therefore the  <br/>\nfewer integration defects we&#39;d have. This would make end-to-end tests  <br/>\nall the less valuable.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; I use a design technique based on<br/>\n&gt; &gt; collaboration tests and contract tests that drive out integration<br/>\n&gt; &gt; defects without integration tests, but it took me a few years of TDD<br/>\n&gt; &gt; practice before I felt comfortable with the technique. It&#39;s not for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; beginners.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Did you write that up in a blog or article and do you have a link for<br/>\n&gt; that?<br/>\n&gt; You could protect it with a TDD adult check somehow so that  <br/>\n&gt; beginners are<br/>\n&gt; protected from TDD-adult only content...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I haven&#39;t written it up in that fashion yet, in part because I feel  <br/>\nlike I&#39;d mostly be duplicating content from mockobjects.com and I  <br/>\ndon&#39;t see the point in duplicating work that I know exists. That said,  <br/>\nI describe the technique as the centerpiece of my Test-Driven  <br/>\nEnterprise Code tutorials (Agile 2005-2006, XP 2006-2007, various  <br/>\nother conferences) and it would be a TDD clinic if Agile 2008 accepts  <br/>\nit.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeday, I&#39;ll write it in a book.
