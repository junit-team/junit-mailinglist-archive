I&#39;ll respond to the direc=\r\nt\nsituation on the original thread, but I wanted to talk here about the\nlar=\r\nger context.\n\nFor those not aware of the context of Marc&#39;s comment, the\nhig=\r\nhest-voted issue on github is now over a year old, and there are\n140 open i=\r\nssues.  By reducing the time to resolve issues, we wouldn&#39;t\nlose the effort=\r\n of motivated developers like Marc.\n\nHere&#39;s a first couple of steps.\n\n1) Fo=\r\nr several years now, issue triage and patch acceptance has been\none of seve=\r\nral priorities that have competed for time during pair\nprogramming sessions=\r\n between the developers.  One benefit was that the\nproject didn&#39;t get away =\r\nfrom either of us, and we were able to\nevaluate proposed changes from multi=\r\nple perspectives.  I&#39;m going to\ntry taking solo point on these activities, =\r\nwith Kent as advisor.  Give\nme a couple months to get a routine going, and =\r\nthen let me know if the\nproject seems like a more appealing place to contri=\r\nbute.\n\n2) As part of this, I&#39;ll try to provide feedback within a week on ne=\r\nw\nissues and patches.  This may mean that feature requests we are\nunlikely =\r\nto incorporate will get closed quickly, rather than left open\nand abandoned=\r\n.  Let me know if it starts feeling like too much\npushback.\n\nWhile this wil=\r\nl apply to new issues and patches, there&#39;s still a\nbacklog to get through. =\r\n I can&#39;t estimate how quickly I&#39;ll be able to\nget through it, nor am I sure=\r\n in advance whether I will prioritize the\ncommunication backlog above all n=\r\new development activities.  If you&#39;ve\nread this far, and would like to bump=\r\n your issue or patch up in the\nqueue with a reminder message, I should see =\r\nit.\n\nJUnit will likely continue to grow more slowly than your average open\n=\r\nsource project.  This has had advantages in maintaining a coherent\ncore of =\r\nconcepts and limited churn in the core.  There are things like\nreporting an=\r\nd data parsing that the core junit.jar file is unlikely to\never do, as it s=\r\ntrives to be &quot;the intersection of all useful test\nframeworks, not their uni=\r\non&quot;.  The Runners and Rules included in\njunit.jar have always been intended=\r\n as examples and starting points\nfor further extension outside of the core.=\r\n\n\nI think there could be value in a bundling of JUnitUnion: the JUnit\nCore,=\r\n plus a set of very useful and reusable extensions managed by\npeople outsid=\r\ne the core JUnit team.  I&#39;d love suggestions on the\ntechnical and manageria=\r\nl ways such a super-package could be maintained\nand distributed.\n\nThanks fo=\r\nr sticking around.  Share and Enjoy.\n\n   David Saff\n\nOn Mon, Feb 14, 2011 a=\r\nt 3:47 AM, mguillemot &lt;mguillemot@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hi David,\n&gt;\n&gt; not real=\r\nly the most motivating answer :-(\n&gt;\n&gt; Providing a clean patch requires time=\r\n.
