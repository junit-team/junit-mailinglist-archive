I feel that (the need) for such an annotation implies a risk that test go easily lost (this is implemented on class-level in the RegexpSuite in the project unofficialjunit on SF). <br/>\nAn inconvenience of this approach is the need for some rigour when naming classes and packages. On the other hand, this rigour may anyhow be needed to separate &quot;true&quot; unit tests from integration tests, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd yes, I would chip in to reimplemente categories in one way or another.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\n   Georg<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, David Saff &lt;saff@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Classes as categories was my idea.

If anyone has the passion and time to invest in a<br/>\n&gt; string-based category implementation, we should talk.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On Thu, Sep 20, 2012 at 2:48 PM, sebastian_4711 &lt;usenet@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; **<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hello,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; we start using categories in a project to distinguish unit and integration<br/>\n&gt; &gt; tests using database. Our requirement is to run unit tests from within<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Eclipse and using Maven.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The experience was rather disappointing.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The support for categories in Eclipse is completely missing. Maven plugin<br/>\n&gt; &gt; did not work out of the box as the wrong test executor was instantiated.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Once this was fixed, we found that the category class must be available in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the class path of all projects, else the plugin fails with a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ClassNotFoundException.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Why are categories not plain strings as in TestNG? This would prevent<br/>\n&gt; &gt; class not found exceptions and in addition removes the requirement to have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; a dependency on the single module containing the categories. If you like<br/>\n&gt; &gt; you can still use String constants to be &quot;name safe&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Evaluating TestNG as an alternative lead to the following results:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; - Good support in the Eclipse Plugin and Maven<br/>\n&gt; &gt; -- Groups (= categories) are found by the Eclipse plugin<br/>\n&gt; &gt; - TestNG does not create a new instance per test. As a consequence all<br/>\n&gt; &gt; fields must be set in @BeforeMethod. Using a normal constructor causes<br/>\n&gt; &gt; unexpected results.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; - @BeforeMethod is not executed, if a group is specified. There is a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; @BeforeGroup annotation which makes the whole thing much more complex.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Best Regards<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sebastian<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  <br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
