Thats a lot.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Actually, I find that I&#39;m spending even *larger* amounts of time working <br/>\nwith my tests.  I haven&#39;t measured, but I&#39;d have to guess around 70%.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if I look at that number, it scares the hell out of me:  70% of my <br/>\ncoding time doing &quot;non-production&quot; work.<br/>\n<br/>\nBUT.....<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve used JUnit regularly for the last year, after having not used any <br/>\nkind of regular testing tool for the many years of development before that.<br/>\n<br/>\nAND....<br/>\n<br/>\nI am *FAR* more productive at producing working software now with JUnit <br/>\nthan I ever was before.  The time spent working with tests<br/>\n<br/>\na) Saves me oodles of time implementing my features.  Once the test <br/>\ndefines what I need to do, I write it.  Once *all* of the tests work, my <br/>\nfeature is done.  No more guessing about boundary conditions, unexpected <br/>\nconsequences, etc....<br/>\nb) Creates much better (in particular, decoupled) code.  This makes <br/>\nsubsequent bug fixes/enhancements far easier to implement.<br/>\nc) Allows me to fix bugs fearlessly and cleanly rather than having to <br/>\nadd lots of &quot;if-then&quot; conditions around my bugs to try to isolate the <br/>\nconditions causing the bugs.<br/>\n<br/>\nTHEREFORE...<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, I spend HUGE amount of time working with my tests.  And that time <br/>\nhas *MORE* than paid for itself.  Several times over, I&#39;d guess.  I&#39;ll <br/>\nnever develop again without that investment in testing.<br/>\n<br/>\nFINALLY...<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think DBC or JUnit are different in this regard.  I view both of <br/>\nthese as tools that formalize the contract of your methods/objects. <br/>\nBoth of them take a lot of time to set up and maintain (I feel it would <br/>\nbe naive to expect contracts to write or maintain themselves for any but <br/>\nthe most trivial methods).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo with either approach, be prepared to invest a significant amount of <br/>\ntime outside &quot;traditional&quot; production coding.  But be prepared to get <br/>\nhuge return on that time.<br/>\n<br/>\nPC<br/>\n<br/>\nPaul Christmann<br/>\nPrior Artisans, LLC<br/>\nmailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:paul@...\">paul@...</a><br/>\n504-587-9072</div>",
