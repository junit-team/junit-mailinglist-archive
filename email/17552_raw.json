Start with &quot;fewer lines of code&quot; as a measure of\n&gt;  &gt; simplicity. When you get to the first counterexample, add the next\n&gt;  &gt; ingredient...\n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you for your comment,\n&gt; \n&gt; Are you talking about total lines of code or lines of code in one\n&gt; place?\n\nI mean lines of code (not of declarations) involved in adding the \nfeature. Using this measure, the command design requires fewer lines.\n\nAnother measure of simplicity is the number of algorithms that have to \nchange or be created. In the case of the switch statement, we have to \nchange 1 algorithm (the switch) and create 1 algorithm (the \nimplementation of the new command-like thing). In the case of the \ncommand design, we only have to create 1 algorithm (the implementation \nof the new command) and we don&#39;t need to change any other algorithm.\n\n&gt; Or something, I have my preference but I don&#39;t know if it is the\n&gt; simple one in everyones book. I think it can become more complicated\n&gt; than just counting lines fo code to know what is simple but I agree\n&gt; that it is a good start.\n\nWhen counting lines of code for this purpose, I tend only to count the \nbodies of methods and exclude lines that only declare variables.\n-- \nJ.
