The bad advice was the<br/>\n_categorical_ statement that comments are waste.<br/>\n<br/>\nComments which just restate what the code says might be considered<br/>\nwaste, and there is of course a tendency for comments to lag the code:<br/>\npeople often change the code without changing the accompanying<br/>\ncomments.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, if the code embodies application-specific knowledge,<br/>\nit is usually important and often essential to explain.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had a friend who worked for a large manufacturer of sausages.  He<br/>\nwas an OR expert.  His code saved the manufacturer several million<br/>\ndollars a year by minimizing the use of ingredients.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey had a corporate reorganization.  His Sausage program was turned<br/>\nover to the DP department because, after all, it was software.  The<br/>\nDP guys couldn&#39;t figure out what it did.  So they optimized it away.<br/>\n<br/>\nWalter was well known for his incredibly precise, tight code.  It<br/>\nwas beautiful.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe was also very economical with comments.  That wasn&#39;t so wonderful<br/>\nfor those who had to decrypt the code when he wasn&#39;t there.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Saying &quot;write your code in a way that it doesn&#39;t need comments&quot; is very<br/>\n&gt; good advice, on the other hand.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That I would agree with.  Although some of us do like Javadocs.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;                                 And in my experience you *can* learn to<br/>\n&gt; write code in a way that you very seldom need to fall back on this<br/>\n&gt; crutch.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Crutch?  Name-calling helps no one.<br/>\n<br/>\nCan we return to JUnit and the thrill of unit testing?<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJim Dixon  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jdd@...\">jdd@...</a>   tel +44 117 982 0786  mobile +44 797 373 7881</div>",
