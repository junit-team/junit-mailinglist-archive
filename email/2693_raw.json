My immediate need is to report \nperformance information: time of execution.\n\nI think that this information is of general importance.  I was \nconvinced after hearing anecdote Cem Kaner told about some tests that \nare run at Oracle.  The essential idea is any dramatic change in \nperformance (faster or slower) behaviour warrants investigation, even \nif [especially if] other test assertions fail to locate a specific \nproblem.\n\nI did some poking around on the web.  The google search &quot;junit \nperformance testresult&quot; uncovered a couple references on netbeans.org. \n Otherwise, nothing exciting.\n\nI could also use a couple good references to successful attempts at \nextending TestResult.  I only need some hints about passing the \ninformation around.  I will of course tailor the contents to suit the \ntask I have in mind.\n\n\n",
