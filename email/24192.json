    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-506424457\">Hi All,<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree with Malte that the name &quot;JUnit 5&quot; would make most sense to users,<br/>\ndespite the problems with version numbers. I&#39;d enjoy helping with the<br/>\neffort when the time comes. I&#39;m an old Java guy still, despite my recent<br/>\nfocus on Scala, and I could bring some experience of actually using in a<br/>\ntesting context features similar to those that will be made available to a<br/>\nJUnit 5 via Java 8 (lamdas, extension methods, etc.).<br/>\n<br/>\nBill<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Wed, Dec 19, 2012 at 1:57 AM, Malte Finsterwalder &lt;<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:malte@...\">malte@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; **<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi David,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On 18 December 2012 18:35, David Saff &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:saff@...\">saff@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Thinking more about this, I think that what defines JUnit, as Neale<br/>\n&gt; points<br/>\n&gt; &gt; out, is its philosophy, and the community of people who buy into that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; philosophy. So I think that when considering a new version, we could<br/>\n&gt; &gt; certainly consider strongly following the design examples of other<br/>\n&gt; &gt; frameworks, like Jumi or others, but in the end, a JUnit 5 would be built<br/>\n&gt; &gt; piece by piece by submissions to this community.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; JUnit for me is still the de facto standard for unit testing in Java.<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s integrated in all the major IDEs from the start.<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s known by pretty much every Java Developer.<br/>\n&gt; Even if they don&#39;t use it or don&#39;t use it well, it&#39;s still the first unit<br/>\n&gt; testing framework that comes to mind.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This has probably to do with the trust in the people who guide and develop<br/>\n&gt; JUnit. But I really don&#39;t know<br/>\n&gt; Moving towards JUnit 5 I think it will be hard to to loose this status, I<br/>\n&gt; think.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; When it makes sense to use an existing library (and licences allow), I see<br/>\n&gt; no principal problem in reusing something like Jumi for JUnit 5.<br/>\n&gt; I have no idea, whether that makes sense at all, since I didn&#39;t look into<br/>\n&gt; Jumi.<br/>\n&gt; I just don&#39;t think that JUnit 5 should necessarily be &quot;built piece by piece<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; by submissions to this community&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; Using Hamcrest inside JUnit 4 was a great move and it is an external<br/>\n&gt; library.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I think also that the compatibility between JUnit 3 and JUnit 4 was<br/>\n&gt; &gt; instrumental in making it useful for teams, and I&#39;d like to see a similar<br/>\n&gt; &gt; focus on backward compatibility moving forward.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I also think, that backwards compatibility for executing JUnit 4 Tests at<br/>\n&gt; least is a must.<br/>\n&gt; If I can&#39;t gracefully migrate towards JUnit 5 I would have a problem and<br/>\n&gt; many other as well.<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m not sure whether we still need JUnit 3 support, though.<br/>\n&gt; JUnit 4 is old enough, that I think we could kill JUnit 3 if that makes<br/>\n&gt; things easier.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; One last thought: one of the biggest confusions about JUnit 4 was the<br/>\n&gt; fact<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that it was both a version number referring to a new release of a<br/>\n&gt; software<br/>\n&gt; &gt; package, _and_ the only useful name for the collection of new libraries<br/>\n&gt; &gt; included in that release. Starting in JUnit 5, I think a different naming<br/>\n&gt; &gt; scheme would be quite helpful. Choosing a scheme that I&#39;m positive we<br/>\n&gt; &gt; _won&#39;t_ use, for example:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; - The runner and interfaces introduced in JUnit &lt;= 3 would be JUnit<br/>\n&gt; Cupcake<br/>\n&gt; &gt; - The runner and interfaces introduced in JUnit 4 would be JUnit Donut<br/>\n&gt; &gt; - The runner and interfaces introduced in JUnit 5 would be JUnit Eclair<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I think JUnit 4 was a great naming.<br/>\n&gt; I made clear, that the new software release also brough the new libraries.<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t see that as a problem.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And doing the same with JUnit 5 would be consistent with that.<br/>\n&gt; So when JUnit 5 changes the interface for tests and also brings a new<br/>\n&gt; release (of course) I would still call it JUnit 5 and everyone should know<br/>\n&gt; what&#39;s meant.<br/>\n&gt; I think it would be much more confusing If you started to introduce two<br/>\n&gt; names. One for the software release version and one for the interface.<br/>\n&gt; Then I would have to say something like: I use JUnit 5 but I&#39;m writing<br/>\n&gt; JUnit Donut style tests? And who can remember those strange names anyways?<br/>\n&gt; Do you remember the last two names of Eclipse and can sort them? Or any<br/>\n&gt; other product that uses naming for that matter?<br/>\n&gt; I can&#39;t.<br/>\n&gt; But I can easily remember JUnit 3, 4 and 5. And I have no problem in<br/>\n&gt; stating that I use JUnit 5 with JUnit 4 style tests.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On the other hand I strongly believe that, whatever you do, it will work<br/>\n&gt; out ok for two reasons:<br/>\n&gt; 1) JUnit is just too established and too well known.<br/>\n&gt; 2) I trust in Kent and you, to stear JUnit in a good direction and to<br/>\n&gt; listen to the community.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Greetings,<br/>\n&gt; Malte<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>-- <br/>\nBill Venners<br/>\nArtima, Inc.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.artima.com\">http://www.artima.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
