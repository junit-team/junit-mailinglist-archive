When should i make a different testcase and things like that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI subscribed to yahoo groups, and found all you intellectuals exchanging<br/>\nideas on Junit which are certainly enlightening.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy basic question is, Does writing testcases invlove making a different<br/>\nstructure all together, i mean writing classes and then testing them<br/>\nindependently from the code which is a part of my application.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease if you could write something about how should i proceed to write<br/>\ntestcases, i would be obliged. Your replies will be highly appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThanx and Regards,<br/>\nManpreet</div>",
