As posted last time this discussion went around<br/>\nevought&gt; the exact same circles:<br/>\n...<br/>\nevought&gt;         public void setJ(int j) {d_j = j;}<br/>\nevought&gt;         public int getJ() {return d_i;}<br/>\n<br/>\nevought&gt; This code is trivial. It is also wrong. Somebody probably created the<br/>\nevought&gt; accessors for i and then cut and paste them for j without editting<br/>\nevought&gt; everywhere they should. Without a testcase here, there will be a more<br/>\nevought&gt; complex failure somewhere else. Somebody will spend an hour or so pulling<br/>\nevought&gt; their hair out. A testcase for this is very quick to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe main problem with testing at this level is that, just as it is<br/>\ntempting to create the getters and setters using cut-n-paste, it is<br/>\ntempting to create the unit tests using cut-n-paste.  Admit it, we&#39;ve<br/>\nall done it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter a lot of soul searching, the conclusion I have come to for my<br/>\nown work is that unit tests should not really be testing the &quot;raw&quot;<br/>\nmethods of a class.  Rather, they should be testing the real<br/>\nfunctionality actually required by users of the class.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t help help feeling in this case that (maybe) there might<br/>\nactually be no real need for a getJ() accessor, and it may have been<br/>\ncreated from a knee-jerk &quot;must provide all the accessors in case<br/>\nsomeone wants to use this class as a JavaBean&quot;. If you have a real<br/>\nneed in your system to call such a method, then provide a unit test<br/>\nwhen you have that need, but before you do that, consider whether the<br/>\nreal need in the system is for a more specific call, which can be<br/>\ntested in more depth.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nFrank Carver     <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:frank@...\">frank@...</a>    <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.efsol.com/\">http://www.efsol.com/</a></div>",
