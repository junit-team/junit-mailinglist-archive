How would you feel about making &quot;private&quot; just a<br/>\n&gt; suggestion? i.e. why not allow anyone to invoke any private method from<br/>\n&gt; any class they want to? Of course, they would know when doing this that<br/>\n&gt; they were doing something skanky. Would you be happy with such a<br/>\n&gt; language? If not, why not? And why is a naming convention good enough to<br/>\n&gt; keep packages and classes unpublished if it&#39;s not good enough to keep<br/>\n&gt; methods unpublished?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If you think the private keyword should be just a suggestion, then I<br/>\n&gt; think we will just have to agree to disagree at this point. But if you<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t think private is unnecessary, then I think there&#39;s a contradiction<br/>\n&gt; in your philosophy that&#39;s worth exploring further.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think Smalltalk does this. If you want to mark methods private, you <br/>\nput them in a protocol that suggests they shouldn&#39;t be used directly. I <br/>\ndon&#39;t have experience with the resulting code or the people that use it, <br/>\nbut I notice that much good Smalltalk (really good, tested Smalltalk) <br/>\nhas been written.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ.
