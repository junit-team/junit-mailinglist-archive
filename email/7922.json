But you can answer me without <br/>\nknowing the book.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe discusses testing private methods and has three solutions for <br/>\ndoing it: using &quot;public&quot; modifier, using reflection and using mock <br/>\nobjects to ease the problem of dealing with private methods or even <br/>\nto bypass it. (Page 153)<br/>\n<br/>\n1. The first two solutions I understand. But how can mock objects <br/>\nease or bypass the problem of testing private methods?<br/>\n<br/>\nNext he writes about branch coverage and cyclomatic complexity. He <br/>\nwrites that counting the branches is difficult if the message which <br/>\nis sent is polymorph. (Page 156)<br/>\n<br/>\n2. I understand this to this point. But then he writes that the <br/>\ncounting of branches is impossible if dynamic class loading is <br/>\nallowed. Why is it impossible then?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing I don&#39;t understand is the a solution to the problem <br/>\nwith the Square class which extends the Rectangle class.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem arises if a method &quot;stretchX(int factor)&quot; is added to <br/>\nthe Rectangle class. Then you can override it in the Square class <br/>\n(so that Y is stretched too with the factor). But then a Square <br/>\ninstance cannot be used everywhere where a Rectangle instance is can <br/>\nbe used.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe has three solution for this: reversing the extends relationship, <br/>\nextracting a common super class and introducing a value semantics <br/>\n(&quot;Wertesemantik&quot;).<br/>\n<br/>\n3. How does a solution look like with value semantics? I&#39;m not sure <br/>\nif I translated the word correctly.</div>",
