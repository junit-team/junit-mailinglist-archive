On their second <br/>\nassignment, I had them write tests for the class they <br/>\nimplemented in their first assignment. (Yes, I know, that&#39;s not <br/>\ntest first...)  On the second assigment, I ran their unit tests <br/>\nagainst my implementation of the first assignment&#39;s class.  I <br/>\nused the text user interface as this made batching up the tests <br/>\neasier.  However, on inspection of the student&#39;s code, I had <br/>\nseveral students whose tests passed, but they didn&#39;t actually call <br/>\nassert*() or fail().  For example:<br/>\n<br/>\npublic class MP0Test extends TestCase {<br/>\n  ...<br/>\n  public void testGetValue() {<br/>\n      MP0class mp0 = readConfig();<br/>\n       mp0.getValue() == 42;<br/>\n  }<br/>\n}<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes anyone think JUnit should give  some kind of warning <br/>\nwhen no assert* or fail is called in a test* method?<br/>\n<br/>\nJoel Jones<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jones@...\">jones@...</a></div>",
