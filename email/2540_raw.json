Look at JUnit&#39;s tests for instance.  Look\nat the sample Money tests that are published with JUnit.  Go to junit.org,\nor the junit wiki, or the SourceForge site, etc.  I think it would be a good\nidea for you to try learning what you can from the documentation and\nexamples that already exist, then, when you have more specific questions,\nask the group.\n\nIt isn&#39;t that we are unwilling to answer questions, it&#39;s just that I think\nmost people expect that new comers will put forth some effort in addressing\nthe learning curve.  Personaly, I don&#39;t expect you to make yourself\ncompletely versed in JUnit, I simply expect you to familiarize yourself with\nthe product enough to be able to ask intelligent questions about it.\n\nTry to understand what an Assert is, what a TestCase is, what a TestResult\nis, what a TestRunner is...  These are the basics.  (Actually, you could\neven skip TestResult for now.)  Then, if you have a class that you already\nknow you want to write tests for (or you are doing test first design and\nhave an idea of the class you will be writing) tell us about it.  We will\nthen have a common language for describing how to write the tests -- JUnit&#39;s\nframework!\n\nI hope you don&#39;t take this email offensively.  I understand that it is\nsometimes overwhelming to learn a new product (JUnit), not to mention a new\nparadigm (unit testing or testing in general).  I only hope to guide you to\nsome possible good starting places.\n\n-Jason\n\n    &gt; -----Original Message-----\n    &gt; From: Alagusundaram Paulraj [mailto:apaulra@...]\n    &gt; Sent: Friday, August 31, 2001 12:31 PM\n    &gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n    &gt; Subject: Re: [junit] Need help\n    &gt; \n    &gt; \n    &gt; I also need to know how to write test cases in Java using Junit\n    &gt; \n    &gt; Pankaj Solanki wrote:\n    &gt; \n    &gt; &gt; Hello, I am a newcomer to testing world.I will be using \n    &gt; JUnit3.7 tool\n    &gt; &gt; for unit testing.
