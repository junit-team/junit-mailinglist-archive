Having this setup run for each test method does not slow my<br/>\n&gt; testcases down appreciably. It doesn&#39;t matter to the testcases where the<br/>\n&gt; Logger actually sends its output to- just that there is something there to<br/>\n&gt; accept events. I have a LoggerTestCase which performs this setup for me<br/>\n&gt; and I just don&#39;t worry about it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The issue is similar with config files. Most testcases don&#39;t care where<br/>\n&gt; the configuration data comes from. I just create a Map as a fixture which<br/>\n&gt; contains exactly what is needed for particular testcases. My code doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; care what mechanism was used to populate the Map or what 10 gazillion<br/>\n&gt; other values might be available. The actual process of interpreting the<br/>\n&gt; config files or database or whatever is in a separate package and<br/>\n&gt; independently tested.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I think the design issue is making your classes much less dependent on the<br/>\n&gt; global state. Singletons are just one aspect of that. If these components<br/>\n&gt; are hidden behind nice interfaces, then you have a lot of freedom to<br/>\n&gt; decide just how much initialization is needed and can dumnmy out a lot of<br/>\n&gt; extra complexity.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The thing to reiterate is that we are testing Components that live in a<br/>\nspecific environment, and we must make sure they play nice in that environment.<br/>\nThis makes sure that changes to the environment don&#39;t break the Components,<br/>\nand vice versa.  You can&#39;t test that with dummy stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot all our testcases use this heavy process--Only the testcases that test<br/>\nComponents.  We have a lot of helper classes that we test individually--without<br/>\nthe extra bulk.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometime during the test cycle we need to perform the environment tests, so<br/>\nI would rather do it with JUnit than with a production system ;).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; RMI *is* an issue and is one of the places I have had significant problems<br/>\n&gt; with per-testcase fixtures. This and other testing issues led to me<br/>\n&gt; dramatically reducing my use of RMI.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t typically use RMI in most cases, however we do have a component that<br/>\nexposes an RMI interface, so we need to test it.</div>",
