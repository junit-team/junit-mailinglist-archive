    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-79315806\">Mike,<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that they&#39;re both valuable (and necessary), mostly because they<br/>\ntest different things.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy unit tests guarantee that the small parts of my code work the way I<br/>\nexpect them to, and enforce the contracts of the API I&#39;m providing.  I<br/>\ncan test code that interacts with other systems even before those other<br/>\nsystems exist, so long as we&#39;ve defined their API.  Its important,<br/>\nhowever, to limit the scope of your unit tests to things that *you* are<br/>\nresponsible for.  If you miss that, you&#39;ll end up writing<br/>\nunit-integration tests, that I find become unwieldy fairly quickly.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I&#39;ve noticed in my integration testing is that now that I use unit<br/>\ntests, finding the actual problems that crop up during integration<br/>\ntesting takes much less time.  Whereas before all I knew was &quot;the<br/>\nwebpage does NOT appear&quot; and I had a forest of reasons why that could<br/>\nbe, now I know from my unit tests that large parts of the system are<br/>\nworking, and the problem must be somewhere in the &#39;seams&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\nActually, I&#39;d say that leads me to the opposite of your hunch that &quot;the<br/>\ncost-per-bug-eliminated of unit testing is higher than that of<br/>\nintegration testing&quot;, because there&#39;s generally a long period of time<br/>\nin the integration test between bug discovery and bug repair, where in<br/>\nmy unit tests, its quite small.  I suppose I&#39;d also disagree that the<br/>\ntwo take the same amount of time to construct, as I&#39;m a true believer<br/>\n(tm) that writing unit tests at the same time as your code takes the<br/>\nsame time as writing your code without unit tests and testing by hand. <br/>\nIn both those cases you still have to go through integration tests when<br/>\nyou&#39;re done.<br/>\n<br/>\nLastly, the advantages in cleanup of your API (if it isn&#39;t easlity<br/>\ntestable, it may not be easily usable) are, to me at least, very real<br/>\nand significant.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust to be clear, I still integration test, too.  It just tends to go<br/>\nsmoother, and I have better knowledge of where the problem is.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis obviously wasn&#39;t a scientific study paper, but hopefully its a<br/>\nhelpful perspective.<br/>\n<br/>\nKevin<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Mike Bresnahan &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:java-junit@...\">java-junit@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I have experience with integration testing but not much with unit<br/>\n&gt; testing.<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve been reading up on unit testing  (e.g. mock objects, test first<br/>\n&gt; development).  However, I have not found an article that explains the<br/>\n&gt; advantages of unit testing vs integration testing.  My perhaps naive<br/>\n&gt; hunch<br/>\n&gt; is that the cost-per-bug-eliminated of unit testing is higher than<br/>\n&gt; that of<br/>\n&gt; integration testing.  It appears this way because a single<br/>\n&gt; integration test<br/>\n&gt; tests a lot more code than a single unit test and takes about the<br/>\n&gt; same<br/>\n&gt; amount of time to construct.  Plus it seems to me that a whole suite<br/>\n&gt; of unit<br/>\n&gt; tests with 100% code coverage cannot guarantee that even the simplest<br/>\n&gt; system<br/>\n&gt; wide behavior is correct (e.g. the web page appears).  Am I wrong<br/>\n&gt; about<br/>\n&gt; this?  Can someone refer me information about this topic.  A<br/>\n&gt; scientific<br/>\n&gt; study paper with real numbers would be welcome.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Mike Bresnahan<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nSBC Yahoo!
