When I run them, it<br/>\n&gt; seems to be running only the old style tests. I was able to run all<br/>\n&gt; of them only by removing &quot;extends TestCase&quot; and using &quot;@Test&quot;<br/>\n&gt; annotation for everything. Is the the only way or are there other<br/>\n&gt; ways.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>As far as I know you can&#39;t mix old- and newstyle test in ONE class and I<br/>\ndon&#39;t think that makes any sense anyways.
