He<br/>\n&gt; &gt; states &quot;that a test suite that covers one implementation of a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; specification does not necessarily cover a different<br/>\n&gt; &gt; implementation of the same specification&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I interpret &quot;not necessarily&quot; as &quot;there&#39;s no such thing in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the general case&quot;. One short example which is hopefully<br/>\n&gt; &gt; obvious enough this time. Consider a function for sorting an<br/>\n&gt; &gt; array of String objects:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Snipping a bunch of stuff]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In reality, you *can* have the best of both worlds.  The<br/>\n&gt; issue at hand is that a general test case excercises all the<br/>\n&gt; contracts that the public interface has.  A contract is a<br/>\n&gt; guarantee that the class must satisfy.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [...]<br/>\n&gt; If what you are talking about is different than what I just<br/>\n&gt; described, perhaps it is because we&#39;re not speaking the same<br/>\n&gt; language?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Maybe, let me summarize in my language:<br/>\nWhat you say is that one can have sufficiently stable software and<br/>\nsufficient coverage with test cases that consider the external contracts<br/>\nonly. What I say is that one cannot go beyond a certain level of quality,<br/>\ni.e. below a certain MTBF, without implementation-aware test cases. As long<br/>\nas your &quot;sufficiently stable&quot; is below that level, everything&#39;s fine. My<br/>\nguess is that this can be achieved for most application fields.<br/>\nHowever, I&#39;m also guessing that one can be testing more efficiently (less<br/>\ntesting effort for same quality) with looking at the implementation than<br/>\nwithout looking at it.<br/>\n<br/>\nJohannes</div>",
