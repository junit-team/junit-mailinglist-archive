After thinking \nabout this now I would have to agree with the reasons people are putting \nforward about private methods. I can now start seeing some improvements that \ncan be made in my design :-)\n\nSo thanks to all that have contributed in this discussion and helped me open \nmy eyes that little bit more - which are not usually very wide open in \nmornings!.\n\nA+ David\n\nOn 30/08/05, Michael Feathers &lt;mfeathers@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt;  David wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hi,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t agree with this. Imagine that you have class with one point of \n&gt; &gt; entry\n&gt; &gt; for the client i.e. one public method. You can&#39;t change the access \n&gt; &gt; modifier\n&gt; &gt; of your method just to test it. Wrapping your private method in a public\n&gt; &gt; method is just the same as changing the access modifier. It is will\n&gt; &gt; documented and it works to use java reflection.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The developers in the project I am currently working changed their \n&gt; &gt; private\n&gt; &gt; methods to public just to UNIT test their code. It is currently very\n&gt; &gt; important to test the private methods as it accounts for over 60% of the\n&gt; &gt; functionality and logic. I have found that enables me to test bottom \n&gt; &gt; up and\n&gt; &gt; I have more confidence when coding and when I need to refactor.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I have posted the SecureClassAccess.java in the &quot;files&quot; section of \n&gt; &gt; group for\n&gt; &gt; anyone that does want to us it to test their private methods.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; The issue is that when it is hard to test something without tricks (like \n&gt; reflective access) it usually means that there is a design with better \n&gt; cohesion out there to discover. I&#39;d say that if 60% of your logic is in \n&gt; private methods, then chances are very high that this is true for that \n&gt; code.\n&gt; \n&gt; Michael Feathers\n&gt; www.objectmentor.com &lt;http://www.objectmentor.com&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt;  ------------------------------\n&gt; YAHOO!
