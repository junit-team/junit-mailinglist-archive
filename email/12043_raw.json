I&#39;m\nin t=\r\nhe\n&gt; &gt; unfortunate situation of having to write tests for an existing\n&gt; &gt; a=\r\npplication(I haven&#39;t been involved in the development). =B4\n&gt; \n&gt; Unfortunat=\r\ne? This is the standard situation in most processes: Test\nare\n&gt; written aft=\r\ner development or in parallel to it. What&#39;s so\nunfortunate about\n&gt; writing =\r\ntests?\n\nAs Chris Dollin stated, &quot;unfortunate&quot; refers to writing the test\npo=\r\nst-hoc. \n\n\n&gt; I would recommend that you read Boris Beizer&#39;s &quot;Black Box Test=\r\ning&quot; -\n&gt; although I&#39;m still struggling how to integrate its wisdom with\nmod=\r\nern\n&gt; tooling, it is definitely worth to get a grip on &quot;pure testing&quot; (the\n=\r\n&gt; &quot;tester&#39;s job&quot;).\n\nThanks, I&#39;ll take a look at it.\n\n&gt; Technically, I do no=\r\nt see why you shouldn&#39;t be able to write unit\ntests for\n&gt; selected classes =\r\nwith JUnit - if the design is suitable.\n\nIs there infomation somewhere in t=\r\nhe net about whether or not a design\nis suitable for being tested with JUni=\r\nt?\n\n&gt; But of course there are many more ways to skin a cat - various xUnit\n=\r\ntools;\n&gt; but also GUI testing tools [not for you], load testing tools (very=\r\n\n&gt; expensive!), and many more.\n&gt; \n&gt; So you should first have an concept of =\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; * what you want to test: Functional correctness; but maybe also\nperfo=\r\nrmance;\n&gt; usability; reliability; ...\n\nIt is about functional correctness. =\r\nI did load tests using &quot;The\nGrinder 3&quot; (can be found at sourceforge), which=\r\n is free. There are a\nlot of open source load testing tools, so they are no=\r\nt necessarily\nexpensive. \n\n\n&gt; * to which level of granularity, e.g.\n&gt;   - m=\r\nethods of single classes; or of facade classes hiding a\ncomplete\n&gt; &quot;system&quot;=\r\n;\n&gt;   - single web page clicks, or whole work-flows;\n\nThat is to be determi=\r\nned and I know only we can do that. \n\n\n&gt; * to which level of quality, e.g.\n=\r\n&gt;   - only critical functions (e.g. defined by &quot;draw most bug reports\nin th=\r\ne\n&gt; last 3 monts&quot;);\n&gt;   - everything to some coverage level; then you need =\r\nto decide on \n&gt;   -- the coverage level (&quot;80%&quot; is in &quot;industry standard&quot;; &quot;=\r\n100%\nfeasible\n&gt; coverage&quot; is the only sensible standard)\n\nI assume the leve=\r\nl of quality depends on the level of granularity. \n\n&gt;   -- the type of cove=\r\nrage (code coverage; or some &quot;feature coverage&quot;\n- all\n&gt; the features down w=\r\nritten in some specification or documentation)\n\nCode coverage is not an iss=\r\nue here but &quot;feature coverage&quot; is. Is\n&quot;feature coverage&quot; a common term? Any=\r\n references? \n\n&gt; ... I hope this wasn&#39;t too general ...\n\nMy question was ge=\r\nneral as well, thank you for your answer.\n\n\n\n",
