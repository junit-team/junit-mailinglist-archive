And if f() in g() is tested ok, it&#39;s also ok in\n&gt;&gt; &gt; g(). If the test of f() is failed, the global test is failed too.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; I want that the result based on beyond code succeed, but it is\n&gt;&gt; &gt; failed.What\n&gt;&gt; &gt; can I do if I want to accomplish that function?\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Thanks a lot!\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Hi,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I&#39;m not sure I quite follow. Do you mean perhaps that you&#39;d like to\n&gt;&gt; specify dependencies between tests; i.e. if test A fails, then don&#39;t\n&gt;&gt; bother running tests B, C, D and E?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Could you try to re-state the problem that you&#39;re trying to solve so\n&gt;&gt; that we can have a better understanding and give you a more accurate\n&gt;&gt; answer?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Cheers,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; James\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; I am so sorry. My English is very poor, so I can just try to make myself\n&gt; understood a little better.\n&gt; OK,let&#39;s test the following codes with junit4.\n&gt; 1.\n&gt; @Test(expected = NullPointerException.class)\n&gt; public void f1(){\n&gt; String s = null;\n&gt; System.out.println(s.length());\n&gt; }\n&gt; If I run f1(), the result will be that junit4 test runs without Exceptions\n&gt; or Errors, because the test f1() obtains its expected Exception. Can you\n&gt; follow me here?\n&gt;\n&gt; 2.\n&gt; @Test\n&gt; public void f2(){\n&gt; String s = null;\n&gt; System.out.println(s.length());\n&gt; }\n&gt; If I run f2(), the result will be that junit4 test runs with an Exception\n&gt; called NullPointerException, which is not expected. If you can&#39;t understand\n&gt; what I say here, I have to learn English harder.\n&gt;\n&gt; 3.\n&gt; @Test(expected = NullPointerException.class)\n&gt; public void f3(){\n&gt; String s = null;\n&gt; System.out.println(s.length());\n&gt; }\n&gt; The content in f3() is the same as in f1(), so if I run f3(), the result is\n&gt; the same as f1().\n&gt;\n&gt; 4.\n&gt; @Test\n&gt; public void g(){\n&gt; f1();\n&gt; f3();\n&gt; }\n&gt; I want to use f1() test and f3() test in g(), because the test&#39;s result of\n&gt; f1() and of f3() above is that it runs without Exceptions or Errors. So\n&gt; I(not junit4&#39;s @test) expected if I run g(), the result is that it runs\n&gt; without Exceptions or Errors too. Can you follow me here? But the mechanism\n&gt; of junit4 does not like I expected. When I run g(), the actual result is\n&gt; that it runs with an Exception called NullPointerException.\n&gt; If I wanna immplement the function I expected above, what shall I do? Why I\n&gt; wanna the function? Because I wanna use reflect machanism to simplify the\n&gt; whole test in our project.\n&gt; If you can&#39;t follow me above, I set an additional example as follows:\n&gt; 5.\n&gt; @Test\n&gt; public void g1(){\n&gt; f1();\n&gt; f2();\n&gt; }\n&gt; If I run g1(), the result I expected is that it runs with the\n&gt; NullPointerException. Because the result in test f2() is that it runs with\n&gt; the NullPointerException. And because the result in test f1() is that it\n&gt; runs without any Exception, so the result in g1() is that it runs with the\n&gt; NullPointerException, and the NullPointerException causes by f2().\n&gt; That&#39;s what I wanna do. If you haven&#39;t understand, I can just say very very\n&gt; sorry. I have try my best.\n\nI&#39;m still not clear why you would want to do this. To my mind, test\nisolation means that you don&#39;t need g1(). It doesn&#39;t add anything new.\nIt probably suffers from being a toy example that doesn&#39;t help me\nunderstand why you would want to do this.\n\nIf you write a method\n\n@Test\npublic void g() {\n  f1();\n  f2();\n}\n\nthe calls to f1() and f2() are just normal Java method calls. It is\nthe JUnit Runner that understands the expected parameter of the @Test\nannotation, but that gets lost when you (in the test body) are\ninvoking methods. Perhaps you need to read about the Runner API and\nroll your own custom Runner, but I can&#39;t be sure at this stage.\n\nCheers,\n\nJames\n\n",
