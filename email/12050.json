On the extremeprogramming <br/>\nYahoo! group we talk about adding tests to existing code all the time. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nMichael Feathers is completing a book entitled &quot;Working Effectively with <br/>\nLegacy Code&quot; which contains hundreds of pages of advice in this <br/>\ndirection. I spent most of yesterday afternoon talking about this with a <br/>\nclient and his programming group. Let me summarize my description:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Test-drive all new code, including new features and defect fixes.<br/>\n2. For each defect fix:<br/>\n    a. Use the debugger to locate the defective line of code.<br/>\n    b. Extract the defective line of code to a separate class.<br/>\n    c. Test-drive a replacement for that class.<br/>\n    d. Change the existing code /delicately/ to invoke the newly <br/>\ntest-driven replacement.<br/>\n<br/>\nOver time, you replace the old code with new, tested code. It might take <br/>\nyears, but each time you replace untested code with tested code, you get <br/>\ncloser to a 100% tested system.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat you must /not/ do is try to add 100% test coverage to the current <br/>\nsystem starting day 1. That just loses money.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
