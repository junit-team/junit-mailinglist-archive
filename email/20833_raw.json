Separating them allows\nme to pick what to run.\n\nHonestly, I&#39;ve been giving some thought to the concept of integration\ntesting and wondering myself where it fits in (after some thought-provoking\ncomments from Joe Rainsberger). Right now my thinking is that it is a\nvaluable testing practice to do white-box integration testing and automating\nthose tests using a tool such as JUnit is probably a good idea. However, I&#39;m\nnot sure that TDD integration testing is the right thing - anyone else have\nthoughts on this? (Maybe I should start another thread...)\n\nAs for user acceptance tests, I try not to do these in JUnit at all. The\nreason is, I want the user to be able to read them. Therefore, I use tools\nsuch as Fitnesse, and now I&#39;m trying out Concordian.\n\nUltimately you&#39;ll need to find what works for you and your team, and you&#39;ll\nprobably change your strategy several times as you learn the &#39;feel&#39; of TDD.\nIt takes some time to learn, but has been the most valuable practice I&#39;ve\nfound in software design. Welcome to TDD.\n\nHope this helps!\n-Dennis\n\n\nOn 9/2/08, Jan Kroeze &lt;thejcwk@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;   Hi all!\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m a bit of a newb to the whole TDD thing, but I understand that unit\n&gt; tests\n&gt; are supposed to be blazingly fast and not access the hard drive, network,\n&gt; database or anything external to the code itself. To this end, I understand\n&gt; that a framework such as jMock can be used.\n&gt;\n&gt; So far, so good. But I find JUnit to be extremely useful for writing\n&gt; integration, system and user acceptance tests as well.\n&gt;\n&gt; Here&#39;s my question: what is the official position of the JUnit community on\n&gt; using JUnit to do larger scale tests? Is there a better framework, or is it\n&gt; common practice to use JUnit for these tests as well?\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt; Jan Kroeze\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
