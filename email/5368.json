This class will be used by EJBs and uses <br/>\nsome of the resources offered by the Application Server, so it won&#39;t <br/>\nrun outside de App Server. I would like to know what the best <br/>\nstrategy would be. What I did was to create a tester EJB that runs <br/>\nall the tests for the class, and to write a TestCase that uses this <br/>\ntester EJB. This approach has two main problems. First, from the EJB <br/>\nI am not able to use some of the TestCase features, like the use of <br/>\nassert methods. Second, I am writing the test code twice, once in the <br/>\nEJB and then again in the TestCase.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI would appreciate it if you can give some pointers.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance,</div>",
