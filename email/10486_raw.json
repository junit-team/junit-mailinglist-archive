Say that I\n&gt;  &gt;  &gt; want to make sure all the tests are actually getting called.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;  Why wouldn&#39;t your tests be executed? Are you worried that you are\n&gt;  &gt;  building test suites incorrectly or that the test runners are broken?\n&gt;  &gt; Or\n&gt;  &gt;  is it something else?\n&gt; \n&gt; There are all sorts of reasons that things might not get executed. For\n&gt; one thing, I am not using the TestRunner functionality. It is not,\n&gt; actually, a requirement when using junit.\n\nYou&#39;re writing your own test runner? I see. In that case, just implement \nTestListener /or/ use the JUnit-addons test runner, which provides an \nopen test listener architecture, making it very easy to track the \nprogress of each test.\n\n&gt; But, also, if I am going to set up something that is going to run\n&gt; automatically for some period of time, then I will carefully check to\n&gt; confirm that it is doing exactly what I think it is doing, at least\n&gt; once.\n\nI understand that, but, for example, if I run the Swing-based test \nrunner, I can watch the tests make progress. Once I&#39;m satisfied that \nnothing&#39;s obviously broken, I&#39;m pretty confident in the test runners. \nThe text-based one, for example, prints a dot for each test. If I don&#39;t \nsee &quot;E&quot; or &quot;F&quot;, then that test must have passed.\n\n&gt; It seems easy enough to add a method in junit that takes an\n&gt; OutputStream and writes verbose output to that stream.\n\nNo need to add a method in JUnit: just implement the TestListener \ninterface. Since you&#39;re writing your own test runner, you&#39;ll have to do \nthat, anyway.\n\n&gt; This is sort of on general principals. If you are writing a framework,\n&gt; there needs to be a way to run the framework for maximum transparency,\n&gt; as well as a way to run them most efficiently.\n\nThat&#39;s an interesting statement. I don&#39;t mean to contradict you, but if \nthat were such a general principal, then I&#39;d think someone else would \nhave brought that up sometime between 2000 and now.\n\n&lt;snip /&gt;\n&gt; Then I will write up something and submit it to the sourceforge team.\n\nGood luck. I&#39;ll say this, though: if you would say more about what \nspecifically you&#39;re trying to achieve and why the current framework \ndoesn&#39;t do it, we might be able to suggest a solution that doesn&#39;t \nrequire more code.\n-- \nJ.
