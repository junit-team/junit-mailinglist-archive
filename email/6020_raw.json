Can you start reading and once \nyou \n&gt; got enough data you write it as XML?\n&gt; \n\nThat&#39;s exactly  what I meant by the second solution. I have a reader \nobject that after its execute() function being called returns a \nresult set. So the composer actully fetches the recordsed and writes \nout the read data. The benefit is that memory is allocated as lowest \namount as it needed but the disatvantage is the composer has to not \nforgetting to close the reader object otherwise the DB connection is \nleft open. \n\nAfter reading for awhile I found usefulness of MockObjects and found \nthat my obstacles may be overcome if I separate a too big function. \nThe function from inside called the reader featched the resultset and \ncomposed the output. If I make several small subfunctions then I \ncould test each of them separately with help of MockObjects. But then \nanother question comes in. Should I test the one big public function \n(that actually inside merely calls several small functions)? \n\nLet me make up an example:\n\npublic void buildReport(ReportSpec spec, OutputStream out) {\n  init(spec);\n  ResultSet rec = reader.execute(spec);\n  composeData(rec, spec, out);\n  reader.close();\n}\n\nlook at this snippet as at an logical example. I wrote an own test \nfor  each of internal functions by using MockObjects (if needed) but \nshould I test buildReport function? It seems to me I&#39;m just not able \nto.\n\nSorry for a long question.\n\n\n\n",
