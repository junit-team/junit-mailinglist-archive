None of us are omniscient.  And, in fact, \n&gt; many of of us didn&#39;t see that people might want to write tests for code \n&gt; that uses our APIs eventually, for instance. \n\nLet&#39;s try to stay away from absolutes like omniscience and focus on \nrelative quantities instead. Just because none of us are omniscient \ndoesn&#39;t mean none of us know better, especially in particular domains.\n\nWhile I would not presume to tell a statistician how to use a statistics \nAPI, I wouldn&#39;t presume to design one either because I am not an expert \nin the field. I do know just enough about statistics to be dangerous. \nThat is why when I need to write statistics code I go looking for a \nstatistics library that will help me by, among other things, revealing \nthe gaps and flaws in my understanding.\n\nBy contrast, when I&#39;m working with XML, I probably do know better than \nmost what is needed, which is why I have written my own API. However \nthere probably aren&#39;t 100 people who know XML as well as I do, and an \nAPI designed just for them wouldn&#39;t be very useful. Instead I publish a \nlibrary that is appropriate for people who do know less than I do within \nthe specific field of XML. Knowing less is perfectly fine. Lord knows \nmost developers have better things to do with their lives than studying \nthe arcana of the various XML specifications.\n\nDo people occasionally get rubbed wrong by the strictness of my API? \nYes. However in almost every case, that&#39;s because what they want to do \nis wrong and contrary to their needs. They just don&#39;t know know as much \nabout XML as I do so they don&#39;t realize that. The problems they have \nusing my API are symptoms of a deeper underlying problem with their \nunderstanding and use of XML. Because my API refuses to let them do what \nthey want, they learn the right way of doing things.\n\nThere is one exception, by the way. I have exactly one user of XOM who \nactually understands XML at a pretty deep level but who&#39;s still rubbed \nwrong by the strictures it imposes. He went ahead and forked the project \nto support his unique needs. That&#39;s the ultimate escape hatch, but once \nhe&#39;s forked it&#39;s now his project and not mine so I&#39;m no longer \nresponsible for what he does with the library.\n\nThink of it this way: it&#39;s like designing a car to run on the public \nroads. It&#39;s not just the driver of the car you have to worry about. You \nalso have a responsibility to other drivers, pedestrians, insurance \ncompanies, and indeed everyone who breathes on this planet. Their needs \nsometimes outweigh the needs or desires of the driver. Now if the driver \nopens up the hood and manually disables the emission control system and \nvarious safety features, there&#39;s not much you can do about it, but \nyou&#39;re not responsible for it either. But if you ship a car that spews \nnoxious emissions and injures pedestrians as soon as the buyer drives it \noff the lot, you are responsible for that. If the car only does this, \nwhen driven 75 mph or faster, you&#39;re still responsible for that, even if \nyou pout a warning in the owner&#39;s manual and the fine print of the sales \ncontract saying, &quot;Don&#39;t drive faster than 75 mph.&quot; It&#39;s much better to \ndesign the car so that proper operation doesn&#39;t rely on unenforced limits.\n\n-- \n﻿Elliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nJava I/O 2nd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeaulait.org/books/javaio2/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596527500/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/\n\n",
