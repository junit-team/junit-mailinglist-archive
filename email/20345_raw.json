Is it enough for\nyou to have the developers include it in the code directly? Would you\nlike to be able to easily edit it on your QA team? Does that data need\nspecial formatting rules?\n\n(sorry for the small self/own project advertisement: I usually cover\nthis topic in my testing presentations. Also I would mention that it\nis very well covered in the book Next Generation Java Testing and the\nscenario is very well supported in TestNG (http://testng.org), even if\nI am pretty sure JUnit has some mechanisms for it too).\n\nbests,\n\n./alex\n--\n.w( the_mindstorm )p.\n TestNG co-founder\nEclipseTestNG Creator\n\n&gt;\n&gt;  &gt; I am working as QA Engineer\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; I have a requirement for API testing where we have many\n&gt; APIs(Approaximately\n&gt;  &gt; 250),\n&gt;  &gt; each API method is going to take 3 to 10 parameters.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; If i have suppose 4 parameters in a method, the possible cases would be\n&gt;  &gt; Factorial(4)=24.\n&gt;  &gt; Is it advisable to prepare test scripts for all 24 methods(positive &\n&gt;  &gt; negative)?.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Method 1:Writing test scripts for each case( positive or negative).ie 24\n&gt;  &gt; cases for a method which takes 4 parameters\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Method 2:Preparing common script for a method, using parser read\n&gt; parameters\n&gt;  &gt; from an xml file and pass them to method\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Method 3:Preparing common script for a method, read parameters from txt\n&gt; file\n&gt;  &gt; and pass them to method\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Note:I have the similar requirement in C# also\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; It would be more appreciated if you suggest me the suitable way among the\n&gt;  &gt; above methods\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Thanks in advance...\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Regards,\n&gt;  &gt; Raghava\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; _____\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Never miss a thing.
