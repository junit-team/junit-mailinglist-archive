But that was long before TDD and the whole &quot;test infect=\r\ned&quot; thing.\n\nAs far as I know, none of my university professors (both underg=\r\nrad and graduate) had any clue about version control or unit testing, espec=\r\nially automated unit testing.  I just always chalked that up to them having=\r\n a completely academic background, with no real world professional software=\r\n engineering experience.  An important part of the first 5 years of my care=\r\ner was understanding the difference between how professors wanted things do=\r\nne and how things are done in the industry.

The first year I taught the course, I had to back up=\r\n and do a session on version control. A significant number of the students =\r\n(including some who had worked in industry) had never seen it. The fact tha=\r\nt one can get through a CS degree too without using version control is less=\r\n surprising, but still disappointing.\n\nS.\n\nOn 6 May 2010, at 19:59, Loritsc=\r\nh, Berin C. wrote:\n&gt; I know this opens up a huge can of worms, but it is am=\r\nazing to me what\n&gt; should be standard engineering practices are neither pra=\r\ncticed nor\n&gt; understood.
