I have came<br/>\n&gt; across various tools including XJB, EJBUnit, Embedded Jboss, Cactus, <br/>\n&gt; etc.. I am just<br/>\n&gt; wondering which solution is the most mature and most supported by the <br/>\n&gt; community. I need<br/>\n&gt; to be able to mock up JNDI so that I can test the persistance in my <br/>\n&gt; EJB&#39;s. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve used MockEJB for that. Its MockContext worked well.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I would like to test<br/>\n&gt; outside the container as I hear this is the best method for testing <br/>\n&gt; EJBs. Can anyone give me<br/>\n&gt; some suggestions and point me in the right direction. Any help would be <br/>\n&gt; greatly appreciate,<br/>\n&gt; a tutorial anything that will help get me started. I would preferable <br/>\n&gt; like a solution that can fit<br/>\n&gt; into a night build and test enviornment. We use Continuum to build and <br/>\n&gt; test our companies<br/>\n&gt; code everynight. If I could drive the EJB test cases from a Maven pom <br/>\n&gt; that would be a bonus.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It&#39;s getting older, but the suggestions in _JUnit Recipes_ have yet to <br/>\nbe replaced with better advice, at least in print.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ.
