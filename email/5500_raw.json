I believe the class I&#39;m trying to \ntest will be extending Applet, if that helps.  As far as which \nJavaScript environment...not sure I understand what you mean by that, \nbut I&#39;ll probably be targeting IE 5.5+ and NS 6.0+ as far as browser \ncompatibility goes.\n\nAs to which JSUnit I downloaded...I didn&#39;t know there were that \nmany...I&#39;ll have to go take a look at them. :)\n\nThanks,\n\n-Eric\n\n--- In junit@y..., &quot;Schaible, Jorg&quot; &lt;joerg.schaible@g...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hi Eric,\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Has anyone written unit tests trying to use the \n&gt; &gt; netscape.javascript.JSObject?  I&#39;ve been poking around, but \nhaven&#39;t \n&gt; &gt; found a good way to create one containing the values I want.  Of \n&gt; &gt; course they would just *HAVE* to make it final, so I couldn&#39;t \nextend \n&gt; &gt; it. :p\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I have downloaded the latest JSUnit, so if that&#39;s the route I \nwill \n&gt; &gt; have to take, just let me know.  And, if you&#39;ve used JSUnit to \nwrite \n&gt; &gt; tests for a class using JSObject, please drop me some hints. :)\n&gt; \n&gt; Can you describe exactly what you want to test and which JavaScript\n&gt; environment you use? Also *which* JsUnit did you consider? \nXprogramming.com\n&gt; lists 4 different.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Jorg\n\n\n",
