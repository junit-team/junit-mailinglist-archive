The\nexception is caught by the BeforeAndAfterRunner which invokes addFailure\nexecuting &quot;notifier.fireTestFailure(...).\n\nNone of the actual test methods for this test get executed as expected.\nHowever, in the eclipse plugin the node for that test is green as are all of\nthe subnodes for the methods. The nodes don&#39;t have the check annotation, but\nno indication that a failure occured is provided. The exception message is\ncompletely eaten. \n\nThe only way I was able to determine what why that tests was not run was to\ndebug into the Junit4.1 code.\n\nIs this a know issue, or might I be missing something?\n\nthanks!\n--\nView this message in context: http://www.nabble.com/Failure-in-%40Before-not-reflected-in-Eclipse-plugin-runner-t1591178.html#a4317937\nSent from the JUnit - User forum at Nabble.com.\n\n\n\n\n",
