The problem I have is on the first failure, the tests \ndiscontinues and the rest of the array is not checked.  This makes \nsense because of the exception that is thrown and handled by JUNIT.  \nIs there a away I can keep the loop running until it finishes all the \nstrings.  I can catch the exception but how do I add it to the \ncurrent aggregate test results that JUNIT is keeping track of.  Also, \nis this the best way or proper way to do this?  I don&#39;t think it \nmakes very much sense to write a test method for each string in the \narry, it wouldn&#39;t be very scalable or dynamic.  Thanks in advance for \nany help or advice.  \n\nKent\n\n\n\n",
