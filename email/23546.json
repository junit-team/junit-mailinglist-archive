The AppRunner in turn <br/>\nuses the org.junit.rules.TemporaryFolder rule to create its temporary <br/>\ndirectories. At first I had code like this:<br/>\n<br/>\n@Rule public TemporaryFolder sandbox = new TemporaryFolder();<br/>\n@Rule public AppRunner app = new AppRunner(sandbox);<br/>\n<br/>\nBut since that didn&#39;t work quite right, I had to embed the <br/>\nTemporaryFolder inside AppRunner and manually wrap it around AppRunner&#39;s <br/>\nexecution.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, it would be better for TemporaryFolder to throw an exception if its <br/>\ngetRoot/newFile/newFolder method is called before create() is called. <br/>\nWhen I was using it incorrectly, my tests were polluting the current <br/>\nworking directory with temporary files, because new File(null, fileName) <br/>\nproduces a relative path. I&#39;ll go file an issue about this...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDavid Saff wrote on 4.8.2011 20:45:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Kent,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve seen several examples in the wild. Easiest to explain is this: I<br/>\n&gt; have an ExternalResource that starts and stops an expensive server. I<br/>\n&gt; also have a Timeout rule. If the Timeout is applied around the<br/>\n&gt; ExternalResource, then I am asserting that server startup + test +<br/>\n&gt; server stopping all happens within the timeout. If the<br/>\n&gt; ExternalResource is applied around the Timeout, then I am ignoring the<br/>\n&gt; server startup time, and just asserting about the test time.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; One possibility is to create specialized TimeoutExternalResource and<br/>\n&gt; ExternalResourceTimeout rules that bake-in the ordering. I like the<br/>\n&gt; RuleChain approach better, because it encourages separation of<br/>\n&gt; concerns.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; David Saff<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>-- <br/>\nEsko Luontola<br/>\nwww.orfjackal.net</div>",
