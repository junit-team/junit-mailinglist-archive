When I&#39;m <br/>\n </span></blockquote>done, <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;I check the Java class back in, along with the corresponding test <br/>\n&gt; &gt;code.  Cruisecontrol detects this and automatically runs a build <br/>\n </span></blockquote>on <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;the build server.  If the code passes all the tests, I go home and <br/>\n&gt; &gt;life is good because I know I&#39;ll get a paycheck the next week to <br/>\n </span></blockquote>pay <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;rent and buy food.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Based on the above description, I disagree that you practice TDD. If<br/>\n&gt; you practiced TDD, then you would not write, &quot;...likely I also <br/>\n </span></blockquote>needed<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; to add something to the corresponding test code.&quot; If you practiced <br/>\n </span></blockquote>TDD,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; you would:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 1. Write a test<br/>\n&gt; 2. Watch it fail<br/>\n&gt; 3. Make it pass<br/>\n&gt; 4. Refactor<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Consider it&#39;s a value object, and I simply need to add a property, <br/>\nalong with a getter and setter.  I don&#39;t write tests for that <br/>\neverytime.  (We have a BaseTestCase with a checkProperties() method <br/>\nthat automatically does this for us via introspection.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It&#39;s the last step that leads you to see that your TestCase is doing<br/>\n&gt; too much is a candidate to be factored into smaller objects.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have worked on a project where test cases quickly became <br/>\n </span></blockquote>difficult to<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; understand because of the massive amount of test setup -- mostly<br/>\n&gt; priming a database with known data. None of our attempts to solve <br/>\n </span></blockquote>the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; problem were entirely satisfying and the team did not agree to let <br/>\n </span></blockquote>me<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; test the business logic entirely separately from the persistence<br/>\n&gt; mechanism. The result was this: after not seeing a certain TestCase <br/>\n </span></blockquote>for<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; a few days it would take 10 minutes or so to remember or re-<br/>\n </span></blockquote>understand<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; what was going on. Also, changes to the test setup had cascading<br/>\n&gt; effects on the rest of the tests. If I had just created a new <br/>\n </span></blockquote>TestCase,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I could have factored the real commonality up and kept the details<br/>\n&gt; separate. That would certainly have helped, and this explains why I<br/>\n&gt; have adopted that technique as a habit.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I have a similar problem on my current project.  I&#39;m writing a <br/>\npersistence layer.  Loosely speaking, my tests take an object graph, <br/>\npersist it, read it from the persistence layer, and validate it&#39;s <br/>\nstructure.  The important thing is, and this is where we share a <br/>\ncommon problem, there is a lot of setup involved.  In my case, to <br/>\nconstruct an object graph everytime a test is run.  My approach was <br/>\nto create a seperate class (named DAOTestFixture, of all things) <br/>\nwhich constructs and contains the object graph.  I simply create an <br/>\ninstance of this class from the setUp() method in all my DAO <br/>\nTestCases.  At this point, I have about eight DAOs and corresponding <br/>\nTestCases that reuse this test fixture.  Plus, I get to use inner <br/>\nclasses, reap all the benefits, and there is nothing to stop me from <br/>\nrefactoring those TestCases into seperate inner classes should I want <br/>\nto in the future.  If I ever find I need to share a TestCase across <br/>\nclasses (would this ever happen?), I suppose I could refactor it into <br/>\nit&#39;s own freestanding class.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;Now, based on those very simple real world requirements, just <br/>\n </span></blockquote>exactly <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;what is it that makes your approach so superior that you will <br/>\n&gt; &gt;immediately discount all others as inadequate?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; At this point, I feel that you are being unnecessarily antagonistic.<br/>\n&gt; Rudeness objection. Please tone it down.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Oh, but it&#39;s my approach that was attacked with a groundless claim.  <br/>\nSorry for wondering why.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;I know, I know, it&#39;s in the newsletter and the forthcoming book.  <br/>\n&gt; &gt;That&#39;s fabulous.  But you&#39;re preaching to the TDD converted here <br/>\n </span></blockquote>and <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;we have found our own ways, based first on the information <br/>\n </span></blockquote>currently <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;available and second on our own experience.<br/>\n&gt; &lt;snip /&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Given that your above statement (way up there) indicates that you do<br/>\n&gt; not practice TDD, but rather that you do something else that is<br/>\n&gt; somewhere similar to TDD, I am not sure that you can directly use <br/>\n </span></blockquote>your<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; experience to argue either in favor or against TDD. I apologize if <br/>\n </span></blockquote>that<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; is harsh, but I believe it is objectively true. I make no value<br/>\n&gt; judgement: do what you do if it works, but please do not call it <br/>\n </span></blockquote>TDD.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t see how you could have ever concluded that I don&#39;t do TDD <br/>\nbased on my statment above.  Definitely a stretch ...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;I beleive TDD has <br/>\n&gt; &gt;gathered quite a bit of momentum by now and if you have any chance <br/>\n </span></blockquote>of <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;influencing its direction you need to provide a little more than <br/>\n </span></blockquote>just <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;self-referential justification for your approach.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Now you have turned this into an ad-hominem attack. I do not believe<br/>\n&gt; that many of us is interesting in this kind of thing. As a <br/>\n </span></blockquote>moderator, I<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; am asking you to tone it down. Just because we do not write<br/>\n&gt; novel-length, in-depth answers to your question does not mean that <br/>\n </span></blockquote>we<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; are evading anything. It means that we are busy.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>HAHAHAHAHAHA!!  You guys are too much ...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;You say, &quot;This will help us write and organize groups of tests <br/>\n </span></blockquote>that <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;are simpler, cleaner, more understandable, and more maintainable.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;These are all noble goals for an approach to TDD.  Would you care <br/>\n </span></blockquote>to <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;elaborate on just why you believe you have achieved these goals?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If I were Dave -- and I clearly am not -- I would not take much<br/>\n&gt; interest in justifying myself to someone who so rudely challenges <br/>\n </span></blockquote>me.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Civilly-worded challenges are perfectly acceptable.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Puh-leeze!!<br/>\n<br/>\nSincerely,<br/>\nMike Colbert</div>",
