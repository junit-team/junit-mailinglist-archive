So closer<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; inspection of (1) I noted that I was actually wrapping a number of<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; DocumentListeners to get the effect I desired - unfortunately I<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; was add them in the wrong order.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Thomas L Roche Mon, 7 Jun 2004 13:40:42 -0400<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; You might consider<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;&gt; 4) expose API to getEffectDesired(...) and then <br/>\n&gt;&gt;    testGettingEffectDesired(...)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Jonathan Oddy Tue, 8 Jun 2004 09:34:39 +0100<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;m probably being thick, but I am not sure what you&#39;re getting at<br/>\n&gt; here, could you expand please?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Actually, presuming I guess correctly about what happened, you almost<br/>\nget it below:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; My confusion comes (I think) from the fact that I am trying to make<br/>\n&gt; my UI &quot;lightweight&quot; in terms of functionality embedded within it. So<br/>\n&gt; from that viewpoint the effect I am interested in is that my edit<br/>\n&gt; control behaves correctly. So the UI code becomes responsible for<br/>\n&gt; instantiating and using this text contol. Perhaps a better (more TDD<br/>\n&gt; friendly?) approach would be to realise that I needed a text control<br/>\n&gt; to be have in a certain manner and extract that from my UI and drive<br/>\n&gt; that? Having said that I&#39;d still probably have nested the<br/>\n&gt; construction of the DocumentListeners, so I&#39;d still end up with the<br/>\n&gt; same [quandary]<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Right, but presumably <br/>\n<br/>\n* there is a reason why you needed to&quot;nested the construction of the<br/>\n  DocumentListeners&quot; as you did. Presuming that non-atomic operation<br/>\n  is goal-directed, let&#39;s call its goal &quot;foo-optimality.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n* there is (at least one) right way and wrong way to attain<br/>\n  foo-optimality (as you have found)<br/>\n<br/>\n* your UI seeks to cause foo-optimality (bring to foo-ition ?-), and<br/>\n  possibly report on some aspect of foo-ness to the user.<br/>\n<br/>\nTherefore I&#39;m suggesting that you might want to consider if it&#39;s worth<br/>\nthe effort to<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; 4) expose API to getEffectDesired() <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>0 write some expressive, relatively-atomic API, e.g.<br/>\n  attainFooOptimality(...) that does what your UI wanted, and does it<br/>\n  correctly (darn those pesky DocumentListeners !-) This would<br/>\n  presumably be reusable in future (or is foo-optimality some passing<br/>\n  fancy?)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; and then testGettingEffectDesired()<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>1 red/green/refactor that API<br/>\n<br/>\n2 call that API from your UI (&quot;lightening its weight&quot;)<br/>\n<br/>\nas well as keeping your implementation-neutral UI testcase, keeping in<br/>\nmind the correct, general rule that<br/>\n<br/>\nJ.
