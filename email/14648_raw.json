This is to \nensure that no bugs exist/are introduced that will be exhibited only \nwhen logging is set to a certain level.   An example of such a bug \nmight be:\n\nIf (log.isInfoEnabled())\n\tlog.info(&quot;Using sequence: &quot; + (seq++));\n\nSo, this code works fine as long as info level logging is enabled \nfor this class.   Let&#39;s say one day in production, we decide to \nreduce the spam generated by this class by bumping up the log level \nto WARN.   All of a sudden, things start failing, etc.\n\nSo, let&#39;s say this code exists inside class Foo.   I can test both \nends of the spectrum by doing something like:\n\npublic class FooDebugTest extends TestCase\n{\n\tprotected void setUp() throws Exception()\n{\n\tLogger.getLog(Foo.class).setLevel(Level.DEBUG);\n}\n\n... tests\n}\n\npublic class FooFatalTest extends FooDebugTest\n{\n\tprotected void setUp() throws Exception()\n{\n\tLogger.getLog(Foo.class).setLevel(Level.FATAL);\n}\n}\n\n\nOr, I can create an abstract class BaseFooTest and extend it with \nFooDebugTest and FooFatalTest.\n\nEither way, is there something more clever that I can do to \naccomplish my goal of testing min/max logging levels?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
