They reasoned that<br/>\nmisplaced components is something that gets found really quickly<br/>\nand that can change a lot in reviews so the focused on that everything<br/>\n/worked/ and didn&#39;t try to verify the cosmetics.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know what kind of components you are testing and I can imagine that<br/>\nsome type of graphic components can be hard to find valuable asserts for.<br/>\nBut I think in general if there is a will there is a way. If you want to<br/>\ntest a GUI you figure out how to do it. If you don&#39;t want to test a GUI you<br/>\ncollect evidence that it is impossible.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have found that asking questions and really listening in this situation<br/>\ncan help move forward:<br/>\n* are automated tests important? Why? Why not?<br/>\n* what are the consequences if something doesn&#39;t work?<br/>\n* why can&#39;t this be unit tested?<br/>\n* is there any part that we can test today? (until we have figured out how<br/>\nto test the rest)<br/>\n* If it can&#39;t be unit tested, are there any other tools that can be used<br/>\nthat would give an acceptable level of certainty?<br/>\n* if it can&#39;t be tested how can we know that it works<br/>\n* can the process of knowing that it works be repeated by any one<br/>\n* can the process be repeated often enough<br/>\n* can the process be repeated by anyone? any developer? just one developer?<br/>\n<br/>\nI think in this case it is a combination of a people-problem and that<br/>\ntesting GUI:s is really hard.<br/>\nIs there any other developer that disagrees that this can&#39;t be tested?<br/>\nI have also realised (better late than ever) that it is more satisfying to<br/>\nlook for relative improvements.<br/>\nIf we test more stuff today than yesterday than that is a good thing even if<br/>\nwe don&#39;t test as much as we<br/>\nwould like to test.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would have liked to give you something concrete but I just sprayed a bunch<br/>\nof stuff your way, maybe you can use some of it.<br/>\nCheers!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 8/16/06, Altman, Joel G.

With Drag and Drop<br/>\n&gt; features?.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; That&#39;s why I said I am plying with netBeans and/or Java Studio 8. By the<br/>\n&gt; way Java Studio 8 is built on netBeans. netBeans do have the Graphical<br/>\n&gt; Drag and Drop Features to Build the GUIs Soon, than by laying out the<br/>\n&gt; interface by hand.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I will be glad if he can tell me how to do this in Junit (point above).<br/>\n&gt; I can then forget netBeans or anything else.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -Kumar&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Joel Altman<br/>\n&gt; Shuttle Training Aircraft Project<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>",
