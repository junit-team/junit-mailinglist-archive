So they they=\r\n must be distributing their\n&gt; code as a set of additional modules (jars, cl=\r\nasses) on top of JUnit.  By\n&gt; my reading of the license ,they are not requi=\r\nred to distribute the\n&gt; source to their work since it is not a &quot;contributio=\r\nn&quot; to the &quot;Program&quot;\n&gt; (i.e. JUnit).  So they do have to make the source to =\r\nJUnit available\n&gt; (which they seem to be complying with) but they do not ha=\r\nve to make the\n&gt; source code to their additions available.\n&gt;  \n&gt; I&#39;m not a =\r\nlawyer but I do spend a fair amount of time looking at license\n&gt; agreements=\r\n since our products incorporate open source so I&#39;ve gotten\n&gt; pretty good at=\r\n reading these things over the years.  Does anyone want to\n&gt; educate me on =\r\nwhere I went wrong with my reasoning?\n&gt;  \n&gt; Kent\n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; _________________=\r\n_______________\n&gt; \n&gt; From: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.=\r\ncom] On Behalf Of\n&gt; David Saff\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, July 26, 2006 11:25 AM\n&gt; =\r\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: Re: [junit] Mobile JUnit\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On=\r\nce you run the exe, which is a self-installer, you get, among other \n&gt; thin=\r\ngs, a text file stating:\n&gt; \n&gt; *********************************************=\r\n***************************\n&gt; *\n&gt; *****************************************=\r\n*******************************\n&gt; *\n&gt; \n&gt; This Software includes unmodified =\r\nJUnit binary code developed under the\n&gt; Common Public License Version 1.0 (=\r\nCPL).

They have produced something they call\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Mobi=\r\nle JUnit&quot; and they have made it available for download here:\n&gt; &gt;\nhttp://dev=\r\neloper.sonyericsson.com/site/global/docstools/java/p_java.jsp\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The p=\r\nroblem is, the file is a Windows .exe contained in a .zip. \n&gt; &gt; That&#39;s no g=\r\nood to me on Linux. Aren&#39;t they contravening the open\n&gt; &gt; source license of=\r\n JUnit by producing their own extension and not\n&gt; &gt; making the source code =\r\navailable?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Your comments would be greatly appreciated :-)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; K=\r\nind regards.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Jim.\n&gt; &gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n",
