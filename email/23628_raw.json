Additionally some information is missing or very hard to find (new features like rules, current version, how to contribute, ...)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I would like to have one site with all the information. This makes it easier to find the information and JUnit would look more professional. IMHO the github pages are a good place for the JUnit documentation, because we can use all the git(hub) features for creating the documentation.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; What do you think?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Stefan Birkner\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n",
