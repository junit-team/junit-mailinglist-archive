I read the documentation on junit.org, but it&#39;s not really clear<br/>\n&gt; to me how I actually share a fixture. I&#39;m probably completely off<br/>\n&gt; track in regards to what the cookbook actually tries to explain,<br/>\n&gt; but I wish multiple tests (as separate classes) to work on a common<br/>\n&gt; set of fixtures. Is the proper way to have the fixtures as static<br/>\n&gt; variables in a separate class? From the documentation I gathered:<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The desire for a shared fixture is a symptom of an opportunity to <br/>\nreduce the coupling of your design. For example, I was working on a <br/>\nsystem dealing with exchange rates. We had a global variable <br/>\n(essentially) for storing the rates. Different tests wanted different <br/>\nrates on different dates. We struggled with fancy schemes for only <br/>\ninstalling rates at certain times. In the end, we passed the rates <br/>\ninto the routines that needed them, which made testing simpler, made <br/>\nthe &quot;proper&quot; home for the rates in the application obvious, and <br/>\nenabled a bunch of other refactorings.<br/>\n<br/>\nKent</div>",
