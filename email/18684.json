She fires up eclipse,<br/>\n&gt; creates a new class, and codes a method.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Just 1.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Then she selects the Eclipse menu (Hypothetical)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Test &gt; test<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; a src/main/test<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; directory within her project is automatically created<br/>\n&gt; with tests that cover her method exhaustively (100%).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So when I say 0 time for the developer, I mean 0 time<br/>\n&gt; coding the tests.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Now she reviews the tests. Could be that she finds<br/>\n&gt; that her method needs some tweaking, to further<br/>\n&gt; contrain it&#39;s behaviour. Then she regenerates the<br/>\n&gt; tests.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Etc.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Now I think the question becomes:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;Well, how do we know the test is tested<br/>\n&gt; 100%/Exhaustively?&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This is where the part about reading some of the other<br/>\n&gt; stuff I wrote earlier in previous posts comes in.<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ll be glad to elaborate on those :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I understand this better. It&#39;s a shame that such tools simply cannot <br/>\nexist beyond the very simplest methods. If it were so easy to do, it <br/>\nwould be done. I&#39;m no complexity/computational theory expert, but from <br/>\nwhat I understand, there is very little any program can reason about the <br/>\nbehavior of any other program, so the tool you describe above probably <br/>\ncan&#39;t be useful for any non-trivial system.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the question of whether the method is tested exhaustively, that <br/>\ndepends on how well the test-generating code is tested... and then it&#39;s <br/>\nturtles all the way down: an infinite regression. It simply pushes the <br/>\nproblem to the next programmer.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
