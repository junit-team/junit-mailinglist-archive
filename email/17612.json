Most are literally unit tests.<br/>\nFor example, the code that reads configuration files can be tested by <br/>\ngetting the values read.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut other classes are &#39;controllers&#39; for finite state machines.<br/>\nThe member functions such as process() read input, feed it to the FSA, <br/>\nand trigger state changes.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat test design approach can decouple the Controller class from the FSA <br/>\nimplementation class?<br/>\n<br/>\nSimilarly, the FSA class calls a &#39;scribe&#39; class to record significant <br/>\nevents to a database. So the FSA is coupled to the persistance layer, <br/>\nwhich is coupled to the JDBC driver.<br/>\n<br/>\nClearly one could implement a dummy JDBC driver, but that would most <br/>\nlikely generated more bugs that just using an existing production JDBC <br/>\ndriver.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo how do folks decouple?<br/>\n-- <br/>\nPat Farrell<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.pfarrell.com/\">http://www.pfarrell.com/</a></div>",
