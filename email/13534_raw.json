I have tried searching in Google as well as \nprevious messages in this group, but I haven&#39;t really seen something \nthat I can understand at my stage [also, my dearching skills may not \nbe that good!]\n\nIf you can simply point me so some good posts in this group or some \nlinks on Google, I will take it from there.\n\nSome background: We use JDBC code within our Java applications and \nwe have separated as much database code as possible. There still \nremain some classes which need to have JDBC code for performance \nreasons. We connect to a database on a separate server and do not \nintend to use an in-memory database.\n\nRegards\nSherlockSridhar\n\n\n\n\n\n",
