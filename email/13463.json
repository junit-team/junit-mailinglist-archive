If I run this test by itself,<br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s ok.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I also have a class suite called AgentsTestSuite which contains the<br/>\n&gt; HouseholdTest.  If I run this test, I get errors on one or two of the<br/>\n&gt; methods; i.e rerunning the test over and over again sometimes gives<br/>\n&gt; one error and sometimes two (always on the same methods).  If I use<br/>\n&gt; Rerun failed tests - Failures first, the test is ok in all<br/>\n&gt; circumstances.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; AgentsTestSuite is inside another suite called ModelTest.  Running<br/>\n&gt; this throws up errors on the same methods as above, plus another in a<br/>\n&gt; different test suite (which again is ok by itself). Rerunning failed<br/>\n&gt; tests first clears one of the methods in the HouseholdTest but that&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What is going on here?  I&#39;ve spent quite a while debugging it but<br/>\n&gt; can&#39;t seem to figure out where the snag is.  Has anyone else<br/>\n&gt; encountered something like this?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I imagine your HouseholdTest tests use some external resource (file <br/>\nsystem, database, something). If so, then something else in your <br/>\nAgentsTestSuite is putting that external resource in a state that your <br/>\nHouseholdTest tests doesn&#39;t expect. Clean that up, if you can.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf that&#39;s not it, then I would need more specifics to get any further.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
