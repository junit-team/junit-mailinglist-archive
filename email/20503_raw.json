They have all been to a TDD\ncourse but for a variety of reasons didn&#39;t learn enough to pick up the\nhabit. The developers all think that TDD is a worthy idea but don&#39;t\nknow enough to practice it day to day.\n\nTo make this worthwhile I think we need a more interesting example\nthan the typical factorial example and a location that encourages\npairing. I could start with the team&#39;s existing code and tasks but I\nthink we would spend a lot of time on non-trivial edge cases without\nreally hitting TDD. Instead I think I will offer to pair with people\nto tackle these problems.\n\nI&#39;m looking for any and all ideas, but have some specific questions:\n- What example would you use? Brian Marick had mentioned one:\nhttp://www.exampler.com/blog/2007/06/26/a-workbook-for-practicing-test-driven-design-draft/\nbut the downloads are broken.\n- Do you have an example that would demonstrate any of these difficult\nissues: abstracting the database, test driving bits of the GUI?\n- Do you have good examples to help demonstrate Test Driven\nRefactoring aka Michael Feathers and Legacy code.\n- Would you go off site? They don&#39;t have a team room yet.\n- Would a boardroom setup work well to encourage pairing?\n- How long would you make the session? Half day? Full day?\n\nWhat would you do?\n\nBTW this was also posted to the TDD group - with apologies if you&#39;ve\nalready seen it.\n\nCheers\nMark\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nBlog: http://www.notesfromatooluser.com/\nOne Year of Scrum: Lessons Learned\nhttp://www.notesfromatooluser.com/2007/10/one-year-of-scr.html\nAperture vs. Lightroom - best comparisons\nhttp://www.notesfromatooluser.com/2007/02/aperture_vs_lig.html\nCustomer Retention Department - Vonage Customer Service Sucks\nhttp://www.notesfromatooluser.com/2007/06/customer_retent.html\n\n",
