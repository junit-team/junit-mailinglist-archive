Okay\n&gt;    fine, but\n&gt;    I  was  wondering  how  people  solve/resolve  the  following  type of\n&gt;    dependency.\n&gt;    If   I  have  three  classes  A,  B  and  C  where  A  delegates  some\n&gt;    functionality to B\n&gt;    which  delegates  to  C.   During my implementation and unit testing I\n&gt;    write\n&gt;    tests  for  C  then  implement the desired functionality in C.  I then\n&gt;    repeat\n&gt;    the  process  for  B and A, okay fine.  But now I have an implied unit\n&gt;    test\n&gt;    dependency don&#39;t I?  So when running my tests as a suite I really want\n&gt;    my\n&gt;    test  cases  to  run  in  the  order C, B, A and never any other order\n&gt;    because if\n&gt;    the  defect is in C then I want to know about it from C and not from A\n&gt;    or B.\nSeeing the error in A or B shouldn&#39;t preclude seeing the error in C.  If\nit does, you need to strengthen your test cases for C.  I find this to be\na good problem.  The tests for A and B become more than unit tests, they\nbecome &#39;sand box&#39; tests as well (testing how well objects play together).\n If you don&#39;t like this behavior and you are able to separate the\nfunctionality, you could resort to simply testing the new unit level\nfunctionality of B and A and not concerning yourself with the delegated\nfunctionality.\n\nThen again, if neither of these appeal to you or are possible, you could\nuse Vladimir&#39;s JUnit-Addons to order your test cases.\n\n--\n=jason\n[:question | ^One]\n\n",
