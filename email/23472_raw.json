I&#39;ve now worked around the issue by having the leaf t=\r\nests consolidate their findings into the master test in a textual manner. A=\r\n master test is represented by the URL of the page describing all of the te=\r\nsts. JUnit knows about the URLs to invoke in advance.\n\nI think what would h=\r\nave been nice here is to fire results as being children of the description =\r\noriginally provided (the master test in my scenario). Having them reported =\r\nas unrooted isn&#39;t technically correct as they are children of a description=\r\n provided already.\n\nThanks.\n\n",
