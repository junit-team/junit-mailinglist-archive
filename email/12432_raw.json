The idea is \nto segregate which methods were recently added.\n\nSo far so good I have been able to use a doclet to \nextract these methods using the @since javadoc tag.\nThis doclet has the logic to segregate these methods.\n\nNow how do I integrate this with Junit.\nAny suggestions?\nThanks\nRaman\n\n--- &quot;J.

If you mean \n&gt; different versions of the same class, then you can&#39;t\n&gt; run those tests \n&gt; simultaneously, anyway. Tell us more about what, in\n&gt; general, you&#39;re \n&gt; trying to do.\n&gt; \n&gt; You can always use XSLT or XML parsing to analyze\n&gt; the test results that \n&gt; Ant generates with the &lt;junit&gt; task.\n&gt; -- \n&gt; J.
