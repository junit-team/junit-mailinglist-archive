Then makes it as simple\nas possible for the users / solution recipients to\nvalidate the system.  \n\nI&#39;m going to summarize the thread in a little apache\nlicensed eclipse documentation plugin just elaborating\non the enumeration methodology, etc. discussed in the\nthread.  I&#39;ll  post back when it&#39;s done.\n\nBTW - Thanks a gazillion (To Eric as as well) for\nwriting &quot;Contributing to Eclipse&quot; and JUnit.  I think\ncalling it &quot;Briliant work&quot; would be an understatement.\n\nCheers,\n- Ole\n\n\n--- Kent Beck &lt;kentb@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; All,\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; At the Agile Open Northwest conference I held an\n&gt; open space session on the\n&gt; future of testing tools. I expected to talk a little\n&gt; about Theories and\n&gt; assertThat, but we ended up having a wide-ranging\n&gt; discussion about a variety\n&gt; of topics. I mind-mapped the result and put in on\n&gt; the conference wiki: \n&gt; \n&gt;\nhttp://www.agileopennorthwest.com/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?FutureOfUnitTesting\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; The most surprising result to me was the interest in\n&gt; language features for\n&gt; testing-what would a language look like that\n&gt; included double-checking as a\n&gt; first-class concept? I was also surprised at how\n&gt; much commonality there was\n&gt; between the unit and functional testing &quot;vendors&quot;,\n&gt; that reporting is a big\n&gt; issue for everyone.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; One thing missing from the discussion was much talk\n&gt; about the hopes and\n&gt; dreams of users, so I thought I would open up the\n&gt; question here. What is it\n&gt; you wish your testing tool would do for you that it\n&gt; doesn&#39;t?\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Kent Beck\n&gt; \n&gt; Three Rivers Institute\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been\n&gt; removed]\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n \n____________________________________________________________________________________\nNow that&#39;s room service!
