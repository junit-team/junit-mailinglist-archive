A distribute=\r\nd system of servers and special servers and common user\n  nodes.\n\n2. Each s=\r\nerver is connected with every other special server but not\nwith a server.\n\n=\r\n3. Every time a client wants to connect to a server, it first connects\nwith=\r\n a special server which then loactes the best server available to\nit and se=\r\nnd its IP address to it after which a normal connection is\nestablished betw=\r\neen that client and its nearest (best) server.\n\nThere are fail-safe arrange=\r\nments built into the code.\n\nWhich testing framework will allow me to test t=\r\nhis across a small\nsample network ? I don&#39;t wish to only simulate this on a=\r\n single\nmachine but across multiple machines with each having a role among =\r\nthe\nthree mentioned above. How, if at all, can I go about setting such a\nte=\r\nst bed up using Junit, if at all ?\n\nAny help will be most welcome.\n\nNote : =\r\nI&#39;m not looking for stress/load tests but for functional testing.\n\n\n",
