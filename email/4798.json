But if you want to, go ahead.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that a testing tool can suggest you to change your code but <br/>\nshouldn&#39;t force you to do it.  You - and not the testing tool - are the <br/>\none knowing what the code should do.  You shouldn&#39;t for example be <br/>\nforced to change the access specifiers of a class to please the testing <br/>\ntool.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Testability is a good quality to have -- and many times<br/>\n&gt; it accidently improves the design.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It&#39;s hopefully not &quot;accidental&quot; :-)  If your tests are easy to write, <br/>\nit&#39;s the sign that your classes have a loose coupling and high cohesion, <br/>\nwhich is the sign of a good design.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Vladimir<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nVladimir Bossicard<br/>\nwww.bossicard.com</div>",
