Can you explain?\n\nA difference of style here.  We have all of our individual tests compiled\ninto some TestSuite.  We then include all of those test suites into the\nAllTests package in the AllTests project.  Our buildSuite() method becomes\njust a few lines of code, referencing all of the other project suites (whose\nbuildSuite() methods are also short and sweet, including only the classes\nfor that package).  But it seems you have stepped around this by\nprogrammatically loading every test case in the workspace.  Do you also load\nthe JUnit test cases (e.g. MoneyTest)?\n\n    &gt; I  use the VAJ toolapi to extract automatically all tests \n    &gt; to be run (see\n    &gt; below code. Not perfect code, but it&#39;s TSTTCPW). They can \n    &gt; easily be packaged\n    &gt; in another JAR if needed (with ant for example).\n\nHow do you do this outside of VAJ using the Tools API?\n\n    &gt; collectTests() will find every TestCase subclass in the \n    &gt; workspace. I have a\n    &gt; ant script that loads the latest release stuff before \n    &gt; running this.\n\nWhen you say &quot;loads&quot;, you mean it loads into VAJ?\n\n    &gt; Those running the tests still need the code to be tested \n    &gt; anyway. One other\n    &gt; point for this way of having tests in the same \n    &gt; package/project that I didn&#39;t\n    &gt; mention is that it&#39;s very easy to keep versions in sync \n    &gt; (tests & code). If\n    &gt; you have two projects, you can end up runnning old tests \n    &gt; on newer classes,\n    &gt; etc..\n\nWe don&#39;t encounter this problem since the tests projects map one-to-one with\nthe production code projects, as well as the packages within them.  I guess\nI dont&#39; quite comprehend how this could happen.\n\nThanks for your thoughts!\n\n-Jason\n\n\n",
