The change was not intentional. I am interested in arguments for making them public, though.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Looking at them, what they do is so trivial I would prefer them not to <br/>\n&gt; be public, solely on the grounds of simplifying the API. Every method <br/>\n&gt; that can be eliminated is one less thing to document, one less thing to <br/>\n&gt; explain, one less thing to stumble over when you&#39;re looking for <br/>\n&gt; something else.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Assert is an utility class so it tries to offer convinient methods for almost everything. Following <br/>\nthe above argument all assert(type, type) can be removed and only left assert(String, Object, <br/>\nObject), but you will find afterwards ugly to write assert(new Integer(val1), ...).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I suspect them becoming public had something to do with the relationship <br/>\n&gt; between the old junit.framework.Assert and the new org.junit.Assert <br/>\n&gt; classes. (The former now extends the latter.) I don&#39;t know why there are <br/>\n&gt; two classes here. They don&#39;t appear to be substantially different. Could <br/>\n&gt; we just get rid of the new one. Would anything break? Hmm, looking at I <br/>\n&gt; was able to remove org.junit.framework.Assert fairly easily. I had to do <br/>\n&gt; a search for the static imports and replace them with <br/>\n&gt; junit.framework.Assert. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>As far as I can tell I think that the new Assert class was created to remove the custom <br/>\nAssertionException and use the AssertionException provided since JDK1.4. From my point of view this <br/>\nis definitely a very good reason to have it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I had to make junit.framework.Assert extend <br/>\n&gt; Object like it used to. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What do you mean by this?<br/>\n<br/>\n:alex |.::the_mindstorm::.|</div>",
