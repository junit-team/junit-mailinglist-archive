B. is saying, I strongly recommend you keep to\nthe following rule: Each test should correspond to testing one thing in\none configuration state.\n\nIf you have 10 tests, and 4 different configurations you want to run\nthem in, that&#39;s (4 x 10 =) 40 tests in total. \n\nIn JUnit, you don&#39;t have to write 40 test methods. You can get away\nwith 10, and run them in different suites. You can name the suites\nwhatever you like, but I recommend you name them so you can tell which\ntests correspond to which configuration. \n\n(btw. Now it looks like you&#39;ve got 40 tests instead of 10, your fellow\nprogrammers will be very impressed by your productivity next time they\nrun the test suite! ;)\n\nIt&#39;s not cheating. You&#39;ve got 40 tests, each testing something unique.\nThe important thing is to avoid situations where you have to explain\n&quot;these tests pass if you run them this way, but four of them fail you\nrun them that way&quot;. That&#39;s brings in complexity you just don&#39;t want in\nyour test suite.\n\nOn Sat, 2003-09-27 at 18:57, J. B.

I find the second problem to be \n&gt; worth fixing, but others do not.\n&gt; \n&gt; I think it&#39;s a good first step, but it will annoy you pretty quickly. \n&gt; Try it and see.\n&gt; \n&gt; Good luck.\n-- \nMalcolm Sparks\nCongreve Computing\nhttp://www.congreve.com\n\n\n",
