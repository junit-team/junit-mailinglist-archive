The original intent was that users would write their own\n&gt; runner-esque code to run their tests.\n\nIMO it was to be able to run tests wherever they are (on an embedded device for\nexample).\n\n&gt; Do you mean besides the TestListeners that can register themselves\n&gt; with TestResult itself?\n\nCurrently you can&#39;t define your own TestListener object and tell JUnit to\ninclude them into the list of listeners...\n\n&gt; A listener architecture is kind of what we do in SuiteRunner, in that\n&gt; you can specify multiple Reporters for a single test run, as many as you\n&gt; want.\n\nand that&#39;s what you would do if you design your application to run tests.  JUnit\nwas first design to let &quot;tests run themself&quot; (without the need of an external\napplication).  The JUnit TestRunners are more spectators than actors when it\ncomes to running the tests.  SuiteRunner is the opposite and this is reflected\nby the design decisions you made.\n\n&gt; That&#39;s true, but I still have the question: What does running each\n&gt; test method in its own instance buy you that setUp and tearDown \n&gt; don&#39;t already buy you? \n&gt; [...] Running each test method in its own instance shields you from \n&gt; any problem.\n\nyou answered your question :-)\n\n&gt; Also, is it not true that by forcing every test method into its own\n&gt; instance, then tests can&#39;t share a fixture.\n\ndouble-negation... :-)\n\nI make a difference between &quot;sharing results&quot; and &quot;sharing resource&quot;:\n\nA resource is something that is costy to acquire (like a connection to a db, a\nnetwork, a CORBA bridge, whatever).  JUnit was not design for integration tests\nand does not deal with these issues very nicely (your tests acquire a resource\nin the setUp method).  If it can save you seconds when you run the tests,\nsharing a resource is totally fine\n\n- sharing results is more controversial and can have some undesirable\nside-effects (discussed in previous mail).  If tests share their results, it&#39;s\nimpossible to rerun them separately (if you&#39;re a JUnit SwingUI fan, it&#39;s an\nissue).  That&#39;s why I don&#39;t like my tests to share their results\n\n&gt; What do you usually tell people who want testB to use the results \n&gt; of testA?\n\ndon&#39;t do that.  But if you really need, you can always invoke one test method\nfrom another one.\n\n-Vladimir\n\n-- \nVladimir R. Bossicard\nwww.bossicard.com\n\n",
