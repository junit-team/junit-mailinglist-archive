Now, I realize that I can test <br/>\nthe client and the server individually. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, the big question is how do I test them independently?<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Client: I&#39;m not sure if I can use Mock Objects to simulate the <br/>\nresults from the server. Can someone please let me know if that <br/>\nwould work?<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Server: The same way in which I was testing the server from the <br/>\nclient. It&#39;s just that I&#39;m shifting the test code to the server now. <br/>\nAm I heading in the right direction?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for you reply again.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards,<br/>\nKalyan.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; Thanks for your reply. I&#39;m testing the following things:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 1. How the client collects the parameters that need to be sent <br/>\n </span></blockquote>the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; server<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Let me try saying this differently, as a question.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;Does the client send the correct parameters to the server, based <br/>\n </span></blockquote>on <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; user input?&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Is that translation correct?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; 2. How the server responds to the request.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Again.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;Does the server correctly process the request? Does it respond as <br/>\n&gt; expected to each different kind of request?&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Is that translation correct?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If both are correct, then we should be able to test both without <br/>\n&gt; worrying about asynchrony. </span></blockquote></div>",
