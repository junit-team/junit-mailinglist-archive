I would choose the one providing the best ROI <br/>\n&gt; for the situation. In a language that checks preconditions for me, I <br/>\n&gt; would get #2 for free. In Java, which doesn&#39;t, it depends on the cost of <br/>\n&gt; violating the precondition. If it&#39;s anything like persistent data <br/>\n&gt; corruption all the way up to loss of life, I would probably insist on <br/>\n&gt; #2. If it&#39;s nothing worse than having to retry one of a batch of <br/>\n&gt; transactions, I might go with #1. Still, I would probably insist on #4 <br/>\n&gt; and prefer #6.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>-- <br/>\n﻿Elliotte Rusty Harold  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:elharo@...\">elharo@...</a><br/>\nJava I/O 2nd Edition Just Published!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafeaulait.org/books/javaio2/\">http://www.cafeaulait.org/books/javaio2/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596527500/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/\">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596527500/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/</a></div>",
