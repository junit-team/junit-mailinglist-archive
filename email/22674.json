Then you can start your JUnit tests, and they simply start their own cache, which is configured to work distributed and connect to the already running cache of VmWare-related objects. Then the objects that you created with VmWare will also be available for the unit tests.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe connection in JUnit can be performed in a Rule or in the BeforeClass methods.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\nBogdan<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, Ananth &lt;cbananth@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks a lot Kent.
