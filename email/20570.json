A distributed system of servers and special servers and common user<br/>\n  nodes.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Each server is connected with every other special server but not<br/>\nwith a server.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Every time a client wants to connect to a server, it first connects<br/>\nwith a special server which then loactes the best server available to<br/>\nit and send its IP address to it after which a normal connection is<br/>\nestablished between that client and its nearest (best) server.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are fail-safe arrangements built into the code.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich testing framework will allow me to test this across a small<br/>\nsample network ? I don&#39;t wish to only simulate this on a single<br/>\nmachine but across multiple machines with each having a role among the<br/>\nthree mentioned above. How, if at all, can I go about setting such a<br/>\ntest bed up using Junit, if at all ?<br/>\n<br/>\nAny help will be most welcome.<br/>\n<br/>\nNote : I&#39;m not looking for stress/load tests but for functional testing.</div>",
