I&#39;d be interested in\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;any feedback, if people want to suggest additions or improvements.\n&gt; I don&#39;t really understand this:\n&gt; \n&gt; This is a design decision that permeates JUnit, and when you decide to\n&gt; report multiple failures per test, you begin to fight against JUnit.\n\nI would think this refers to wanting later assertions to execute after a \nprevious assertion fails, which JUnit doesn&#39;t do on purpose.\n\n&gt; I don&#39;t see how having more that one assert &quot;fights against&quot; JUnit (what\n&gt; does this even mean?) and in the code that I see every day, very few tests\n&gt; contain only one assert.  Especially if your tests require two or three\n&gt; statements to set up in the test method (not in setUp()), in which case\n&gt; there is even more to be gained to run more than one assert so you don&#39;t\n&gt; have to duplicate this code in other test methods.\n\nI see many people misunderstand the message of &quot;one assert per test&quot;. \nIt&#39;s not important to have precisely one assert per test, but it is \ngenerally wise to avoid doing this:\n\narrange\nact\nassert\nact some more\nassert some more\nact some more\nassert some more\n\nLet me emphasize that this is /generally/ unwise. Not always so. (I \nusually split this into three separate tests.)\n\n&gt; Also, the fix you show in your documentation is simplistic.  What if the\n&gt; code to be extracted is specific to that test method?  If you move it to\n&gt; setUp(), you are suddenly charging *all* the other test methods of that same\n&gt; class with this set up cost that they have no need for.\n&gt; \n&gt; Also, it seems to me your recommended pattern for code that must throw an\n&gt; exception (&quot;don&#39;t catch it and declare the exception in the throws\n&gt; statement&quot;) goes against common practice.  Plus, it will cause JUnit to\n&gt; report an Error instead of a Failure, although this distinction is\n&gt; thankfully going away with JUnit4.\n&gt; \n&gt; A more common way to address this problem is to catch the exception and do a\n&gt; fail().\n\nI don&#39;t quite understand this. If the test expects the exception, then \nwe usually catch it and /don&#39;t/ fail; but if the test doesn&#39;t expect the \nexception, then we usually throw it up into JUnit and let it report the \nerror.\n-- \nJ.
