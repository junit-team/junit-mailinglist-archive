We are wondering of the tearDown() time is <br/>\nsimilary included?<br/>\n<br/>\nJUnit 4.3 looks very nice, and we are also wondering if the<br/>\nuse of the @BeforeClass/@AfterClass Annotations will prevent the <br/>\nsetUp/tearDown times being included.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis seems like a suitable question and it is not covered in the FAQ, <br/>\nwhich was last modified in 2002.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks all</div>",
