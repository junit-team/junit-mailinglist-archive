Dreaming is not a crime you know? :P=\r\n\n\nAny help here is SERIOUSLY appreciated, I&#39;m currently losing hours and ho=\r\nurs each day \nbecause I have to deploy a full JNLP java package in order to=\r\n test jnlp-enabled application, \nand I can&#39;t debug them at all.\n\nAlso, auto=\r\nmated JUnit testing can&#39;t presently be done AFAIK.\n\nAnyone knows a solution=\r\n, or can give me some hints about this problem?\n\nThanks in advance for any =\r\nanswer\n\n\n",
