Perhaps I&#39;m just special?  :)  Specifically,\nI&#39;ve defined a base class with setup and teardown methods that are\nsupposed to be called before and after all tests are run.  To do this,\nI&#39;m using the @BeforeClass and @AfterClass annotations.  I then extend\nthis base class, which can have a local setup/teardown, and the tests in\nthem.  When I run it, I get an exception stating that the base class&#39;s\nsetup method should be static.\n\nNote:  I&#39;m using Eclipse and the JUnit 3.8.x runner.  My test classes\nhave the static suite method that utilize the JUnit4TestAdapter.\n\nMike\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  SPONSORED LINKS \n        Basic programming language   C programming language   Computer programming languages     The c programming language   C++ programming language   Software programming language \n    \n---------------------------------\n  YAHOO!
