That&#39;s because interface is just a collection of methods, so they are relatively easier.  It turned out that the code\nfor writing mock objects FOR INTERFACE can be refactored so came the EasyMock(http://tammofreese.de/easymock/index.html) and\nMockMaker (http://www.xpdeveloper.com/cgi-bin/wiki.cgi?MockMaker).\n\nAs for mock objects for classes, things are a lot harder.  For example, the first thing I have encountered is how to call the super\nconstructor from the mock objects and pass the valid parameters.  And the static methods, singletons just make things almost\nimpossible.  After several struggles, I now understand anti-pattern a lot better. :)\n\nThere are two sites I have found so far:\nMockObjects (http://mockobjects.sourceforge.net/index.html) and\nExtendObjects (The link is on MockMaker page but somehow the XDeveloper is download since last Saturday).  I haven&#39;t had chance to\ngo through the latter and the MockObjects is creating a library of mock objects, which is the best solution I have seen so far.\n\nI have grown great interest in mock objects and I would like to share the experience with fellow developers, as long as this is not\noff the topic.\n\nShane\n\n\nFranksun wrote:\n\n&gt; I only can mock objcect from interface ?\n&gt; If some complex objcect no interface and I want to mock it .\n&gt; How I get it ?\n&gt; thanks!\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
