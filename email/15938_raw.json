The Adaptor pattern for instance is a simple way of implementing\n&gt; the Pluggable Selector.  It will respond to refactorings, it doesn&#39;t add\n&gt; much complexity, and it&#39;s efficient.\n\nReally? How does Adapter do this? Specifically, I was working in an area \nwhere there were a number of rule methods, like\n\n     boolean isReadyToStart();\n     boolean isX();\n     boolean isY();\n\nand there was one big method that essentially did this:\n\n     if (isReadyToStart() && isX() && isY() && ... ) {\n         doTheCoolThing();\n     }\n\nNow there /is/ an obvious refactoring here, to use &quot;inject&quot; which might \nnow be part of Commons Collections, but which I ended up implementing \nsome time ago.\n\n     create a Predicate for each rule and add it to a rules Set\n\n     Inject inject = new Inject(false) {\n         public boolean result;\n\n         public Inject(boolean startValue) {\n             this.result = startValue;\n         }\n\n         public void process(Object input) {\n             Predicate each = (Predicate) input;\n             result = result && each.evaluate();\n         }\n     }\n\n\n     CollectionUtils.forEachDo(rules, inject);\n\n     if (inject.result) {\n         doTheCoolThing();\n     }\n\nThis is better: to add a new rule requires only adding a Predicate to \nthe rules Set, but that probably means adding the boolean method, then \nwrapping it in a Predicate, or worse, littering the codebase with a \nbunch of top-level Predicate implementations that I can&#39;t read together \nat a glance. (They&#39;re often one-line methods, anyway!) I prefer to \ndiscover all the rules and use them. For this, I do what JUnit does: use \na naming convention and collect all the rules into a ruleset and run \nthem with the Inject closure. When I showed some well-known and \nwell-meaning agilistas this, they uniformly thought I was nuts. Since \nthey all use xUnit, I find that surprising.\n\nGranted, in JDK 5.0 I would use annotations instead of reflection, but I \ndon&#39;t plan to work much in JDK 5.0. If I wanted to write C++, I&#39;d write C++.\n-- \nJ. B.
