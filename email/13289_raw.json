B. (Joe) Rainsberger wrote:\n\n&gt; When I have used &quot;one dataset for all tests&quot;, it has made incremental\n&gt; design difficult. The primary problem is relationships between entities\n&gt; in the data set. I might have to add a few Contracts to test the next\n&gt; feature, but then I need a new Agent or Department or something, and\n&gt; that affects the expected results in tests related to those entities.\n\n&gt; When I&#39;ve done it -- three times was enough to learn for good -- the\n&gt; cost ended up being higher than expected and rose as the project went\n&gt; on, which is rarely a good sign.\n\nI had the same experience, although not so much as you. It was more a \ntheoretical thought of me that &quot;one dataset for all tests&quot; can&#39;t be good.\n\n&gt; I think real data is good, because real data is often stranger than\n&gt; made-up test data. I think one dataset for all tests is a mistake -- a\n&gt; big mistake.\n\nLet me explain my fictive data in contrast to real data.\n\nFor example I calculate ABC analysis in a batch program.\n\nI will simplify the model:\n\nArticle\n- id\n- salesHistoryWeekCollection\n- abcIndicator\n\nSalesHistoryWeek\n- week\n- year\n- soldQuantity\n- price\n- category {warehouse, commission or direct}\n\nFor every Article I calculate its soldQuantityPrice (soldQuantity *\nprice).\n\nThen I rank them in a list according to their soldQuantityPrice.\n\nThe first 10% in the ranking list will be A articles. The next 20%\nwill be B articles. The rest are C articles.\n\nThen I persist the ABC indicator on the article entities.\n\nWith real data I would have 65.000 articles.\n\nSo I make some fake data for my JUnit tests. I simply create 10\narticles. Each one has 6 salesHistoryWeeks: 2 for each category.\n\nFor the first article (id 1) I set the highest soldQuantities and\nprices. For the last article, I set the lowest soldQuantities and prices.\n\nAfter the calculation I expect the articles with id 1, 2, and 3 to be\nA articles and the articles wtih ids 6 - 9 to be C articles.\n\nIts all in my hand. I even create invalid data, because I know that my\ncalculation doesn&#39;t need all the data which my validation rules would\nrequire normally.\n\nI even create and change the parameters in the database for my\ncalculation. For example in my first test case I set the params to\nconsider only article salesHistoryWeeks with category &#39;warehouse&#39;.\nAfter the calculation I check the result. It must be different than if\nI had chosen all categories to be considered.\n\nThe dataset for my ABC analysis is as small as possible, just 10\narticles. I only test the business logic, not performance or something\nelse.\n\nOf course some errors still can be undetected. They are often detected\nwhen run against real data. Then such things as NullPointerExceptions\ncan happen. I fix the bug and extend my test and test data if\nnecessary. Still I use invented data for my test.\n\nI try to make my JUnit test automatic and independent, creating its\ndata for each test case or even test method and deleting them after\nthe test.\n\nI consider testing with real data to be an integration test while\ntesting with invented data would be more of a unit test.\n\n\n\n\n",
