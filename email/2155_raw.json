But in my case I would have a lot of &quot;false \n&gt; warnings&quot; because I\n&gt; have a lot of methods that validate something and throw if \n&gt; it&#39;s invalid (but\n&gt; do nothing if valid, so return is void). The tests look like that :\n&gt; \n&gt; public void testAValidationTest() throws Exception {\n&gt;     validator.validate(VALID_DATA);\n&gt; }\n&gt; \n&gt; So, no asserts, but a perfectly valid test case.\n&gt; \n&gt; I would then probably get 200 warnings, so how could I \n&gt; differentiate the\n&gt; legitimate ones from false ones?\n&gt; \n&gt; If this feature goes in, it should be possible to turn it on/off, like\n&gt; assert counting I guess :)\n&gt; \n&gt; mathieu\n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; From: Keith Ray\n&gt; To: &#39;junit@yahoogroups.com&#39;\n&gt; Sent: Friday, July 27, 2001 12:36 PM\n&gt; Subject: [junit] re - assert counting\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; As I said before, I would just want a warning when a test \n&gt; method is empty or\n&gt; has no asserts... but I don&#39;t want to go to the trouble of \n&gt; getting some\n&gt; code-coverage tool working.\n&gt; &gt; I think Jeff has hit the nail on the head, I too would like to be\n&gt; &gt; able to get some feedback when the number of asserts has changed\n&gt; &gt; for the same reasons.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Seems to me that the simplest thing that could possibly work is\n&gt; &gt; to count the asserts.\n&gt; I&#39;m not using the current JUnit, since my old version is \n&gt; doing just fine,\n&gt; with no class-loader problems because it doesn&#39;t do its own \n&gt; class-loading,\n&gt; and I&#39;ve customized it to write time-per-test information to \n&gt; stdout, etc...\n&gt; Eventually I will add the no-asserts warning to my versions \n&gt; of CppUnit and\n&gt; JUnit.\n&gt; Does the current JUnit have a tree view of test-cases within \n&gt; test-suites\n&gt; within other test-suites? If it did, then the lowest-level \n&gt; view of a single\n&gt; test-case could display the assert count, or perhaps turn \n&gt; some color if\n&gt; there were no asserts.\n&gt; Did the code that someone wrote to look for TestCase \n&gt; subclasses in specified\n&gt; directory hierarchies or jar files, and automatically run \n&gt; them, get put into\n&gt; JUnit or made public?\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
