So i was not sure<br/>\nif we could handle pop up windows and page refreshed. I would really<br/>\nappreciate if you could let me know how its done. And thanks for your<br/>\nquick response.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs the author of HttpUnit, I can assure you that such functionality is<br/>\nmost definitely built in. (I cannot believe that I forgot to include<br/>\nthis in the FAQ). Now there are a number of different types of<br/>\n&quot;pop-up&quot; windows. New windows launched by settting targets to _blank<br/>\nor an unknown frame name are created as new instances of WebWindow.<br/>\nYou can check for their creation by setting a WebWindowListener.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other types are triggered by JavaScript. Alert dialog require no<br/>\nuser interaction (other than to dismiss them) and their content can be<br/>\nread by the WebClient: popNextAlert and getNextAlert methods.<br/>\nJavaScript dialogs can be checked and answered by adding a<br/>\nDialogResponder.<br/>\n<br/>\nExamples of all of these are found in the regression tests included in<br/>\nthe archive. I will make sure to add them to the FAQ.</div>",
