I got some idea from you. Thanks.\n&gt;\n&gt;But if the classes and the methods I want to test are abstract, I\n&gt;can&#39;t know what will happen in the methods of the subclasses which\n&gt;extend from these abstract classes.\n\n\nThe only thing that JUnit really tests is the unit (hence the name), where \na unit is usually (in my experience) a method. It doesn&#39;t test the \nrelationships between methods - this is a seperate field.\n\nTo test an abstract class you&#39;ll need to create a second class that extends \nthe first, with only the barest of implementations - and then test that.\n\n\n\n&gt;  Why I asked this question is that\n&gt;these classes I will test are a framework of our project, many of\n&gt;them are abstract classes. Our project team must follow this\n&gt;framework and extend from these abstract classes to develop our\n&gt;project. Now I was assigned to test if this framework is correct.\n&gt;What can I do?\n\nDefine correct to start with!\n\n\nWhat do you really want to test? Junit can be used (as I mentioned above) \nto test if the individual methods in the base class(es) are doing what you \nexpect - does a method called &quot;saveFile()&quot; really save a file, and is it \nthe file you expect; does a method call &quot;reportError(BigError myError)&quot; \nreally report myError, what happens if myError is null, or...\nIt won&#39;t tell you if the framework you have is correct, stable etc. It&#39;ll \nonly give you confidence that the individual classes are stable and &quot;correct&quot;.\n\n\n\nJim\n\n\n\n--\n\n                           *   Jim Cheesman   *\n             Trabajo: \njchees@... - (34)(91) 724 9200 x 2360\n                 I am becoming \nincreasingly worried that\n                  there isn&#39;t enough anxiety in \nmy life.\n\n\n\n",
