I&#39;m impressed.\n\n&gt; I was\n&gt; looking at the gap between the intent of the\n&gt; programmer and the function of the target software,\n&gt; and whether it is possible to bridge that gap\n&gt; without the programmer documenting the intent.\n\n(I&#39;m probably saying what you are saying again here,\nplus less elegantly, but I&#39;m a work in progress)\n\nWith respect to intent I would think the following.\n\nGiven the method body and the datatypes, we can deduce\nthe intent 100% (Meaning that we can say precisely\nwhat will happen per the corner cases, edge cases,\netc, however we now have to be able to say whether the\ndeduced intent matches the intent of the designer.\n\nAnd the only way to do that 100% is to validate\nwhether the corner cases and edge conditions produce\nthe right output.  If it&#39;s a mathematical formula it\ncould be doing lots of rounding, summing, adding, more\nrounding it could be that I would have to put a range\non the expected results.  I also need to know what the\nexpected result should be for all the combinations of\ncorner and edge conditions that constitute 100%\ntesting.\n\nSo what I mean by 100% method testing is that the\ntests can be generated and be exhaustive for the\ninputs corresponding calculated outputs that are of\ninterest and need to be reviewed.  That&#39;s all a\nmachine can do.  \n\nActually validating the generated output, or the\nintent behind the design of the target system, in the\noriginal case a method, is left to us.\n\nI could change the the original question, which was\n&quot;What does it mean to test a method 100%&quot; to a goal\nlike:\nHave the programmer do 0 work to find out what the\ncharacteristics of the system are and minimal work in\nvalidating those charachteristics.\n\nCheers,\n- Ole\n\n\n\n--- &quot;James P. Gunderson&quot; &lt;jgunders@...&gt;\nwrote:\n\n&gt; Kevin:\n&gt;    I totally agree that there are a number of\n&gt; reasons for developing and running tests. I think\n&gt; that your list is a great initial classification. I\n&gt; guess my point was focused on the suggestion that\n&gt; the programmer writes some code, and without\n&gt; providing any additional information, presses the\n&gt; button that generates all the test cases. JB brought\n&gt; up the question of how much one program can &#39;reason&#39;\n&gt; about the behavior of another program. I agree with\n&gt; your observation that the ability to characterize a\n&gt; programs behavior is frequently needed and useful. I\n&gt; also agree that one package can do a lot to analyse\n&gt; another.\n&gt; \n&gt; All I was pointing out is that the analyzing program\n&gt; only has the source code of the target software to\n&gt; work from. Yes, a lot can be done to make sure that\n&gt; that target program has no errors in it, but it is\n&gt; harder (without extra information) to assess whether\n&gt; the target code is doing the right thing.  For\n&gt; example, suppose I write a function to calculate the\n&gt; distance between to points in space. The analysis\n&gt; can make sure that corner cases are covered, the\n&gt; code has no unnecessary complexity, that all the\n&gt; code is reachable, and so forth. And this is really\n&gt; good, useful, and provides value to me the\n&gt; programmer.  However, if I program the distance\n&gt; calculation incorrectly (perhaps I calculate the\n&gt; manhattan distance instead of the euclidian) how\n&gt; does the analyzing program &#39;know&#39; that I coded the\n&gt; wrong function?  Without the addition of\n&gt; annotations, invariants, or the inclusion of test\n&gt; data, the analyzing program is hobbled. However, if\n&gt; the programmer is required to add the additional\n&gt; information, this violates the notion that the\n&gt; programmer has to do zero addtional work.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now, I would be happy to have a support system that\n&gt; provides all the benefits you outlined, and I would\n&gt; be perfectly happy to have a system that would take\n&gt; a small amount of additional info and demonstrate\n&gt; (dare we say prove) that the code I wrote is both\n&gt; error free and does the job I want it to. I was\n&gt; looking at the gap between the intent of the\n&gt; programmer and the function of the target software,\n&gt; and whether it is possible to bridge that gap\n&gt; without the programmer documenting the intent.\n&gt; \n&gt; Jim\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; +++++\n&gt; Kevin Lawrence wrote:\n&gt; There are lots of reasons why one might want to have\n&gt; tests. Off the\n&gt; top of my head,\n&gt; \n&gt; - to drive the design\n&gt; - to document the design\n&gt; - to demonstrate correctness\n&gt; - to provide a safety net when changing unfamiliar\n&gt; code\n&gt; \n&gt; This latter case, which Michael Feathers talks a\n&gt; great deal about in\n&gt; WELC, is probably one of the most common reasons\n&gt; that people want\n&gt; automated tests.\n&gt; \n&gt; Putting it another way,\n&gt; \n&gt;   if I change this line of code, what other behavior\n&gt; will change will\n&gt; change as a result\n&gt; \n&gt; We ask ourselves this question every time we\n&gt; maintain unfamiliar code\n&gt; in an unfamiliar system without tests. The most\n&gt; conscientious\n&gt; developers write tests before changing that line of\n&gt; code. Most don&#39;t.\n&gt; \n&gt; This is such a common activity in software\n&gt; development that a program\n&gt; that could characterize the behavior of another\n&gt; program and report\n&gt; when the behavior has changed would be useful\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t it?\n&gt; \n&gt; As to JB&#39;s observation about whether it&#39;s possible\n&gt; to generate such\n&gt; tests for non-trivial programs - it&#39;s still early\n&gt; days for JUnit\n&gt; Factory but I think you&#39;d be surprised by what&#39;s\n&gt; already possible.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Kevin\n&gt; \n&gt; www.junitfactory.com\n&gt; You send us code.
