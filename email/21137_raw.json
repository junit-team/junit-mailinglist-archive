Now The problem is that all\ncases can be only designed to be in a method ( I do the &#39;for loop&#39; to let\neach unit input test against the fixture.), it means that in this case many\ntests happened in one method. Is there any way to execute a test in a\nmethod?\n\nRegards.\n\nmmchut\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
