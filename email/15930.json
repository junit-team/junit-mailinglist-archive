Thanks,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; That&#39;s pretty interesting. I like the formal introduction to JUnit.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I noticed that the author points out the danger of using Pluggable<br/>\n&gt; Selector and reflection in general.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What&#39;s up with that? Why do so many people find reflection so dangerous?<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I wouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s dangerous, it&#39;s just that it adds more complexity to <br/>\nthe system.  Things can break easily after refactorings because <br/>\nrefactorings don&#39;t catch the string-based reflexive name of the <br/>\nmethod/class/interface.<br/>\n<br/>\nReflection in Java is also very slow.  If used properly it doesn&#39;t <br/>\nimpact the system too much.  But that makes the system more brittle <br/>\nbecause as a developer I have to *know* that a certain part of the <br/>\nsystem uses reflection and therefore I need to tip-toe around it (eg. I <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t want code to call into that part of the system in a tight loop <br/>\nor something).<br/>\n<br/>\nI have often found that there are other ways around using reflection in <br/>\nJava.  The Adaptor pattern for instance is a simple way of implementing <br/>\nthe Pluggable Selector.  It will respond to refactorings, it doesn&#39;t add <br/>\nmuch complexity, and it&#39;s efficient.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJason Rogers<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I,<br/>\nbut Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in<br/>\nthe flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved<br/>\nme, and gave himself for me.&quot;<br/>\n    Galatians 2:20<br/>\n<br/>\n (&#92; /)<br/>\n  0 0     www.squeak.org<br/>\n  =*=</div>",
