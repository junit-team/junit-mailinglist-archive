We should only test a Unit instead of testing the <br/>\n&gt; unit, the framework, the application server and the database.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m testing with databases right now and it&#39;s in fact very tricky.  I&#39;m not<br/>\nusing mock objects and directly test with the database.  The reason is that I<br/>\ntest a database access layer, so I really need to test with the databases I support.<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe that you have to test with the database anyway so I would at least<br/>\nhave some integration tests that are using the databases directly.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the side note, I&#39;ve made an *alpha* release of the TestRunner I currently use<br/>\nfor my integration tests.  There is no documentation and it&#39;s released *as is*<br/>\nso if you like to live dangerously, you can try it out.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I suggested to use mock objects and Test Driven Development. But the <br/>\n&gt; senior programers don&#39;t want it. I listed all the many advantages <br/>\n&gt; but couldn&#39;t convince them.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I would first present JUnit and set up Continuous Integration (or a nightly<br/>\nbuild).  Once the developers are more confident in their tests, you can<br/>\nintroduce TDD.  I don&#39;t think that TDD is a requirement for good software. <br/>\nTests definitively are.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would also introduce Eclipse/PMD and check out the errors in the code.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Vladimir<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nVladimir R.
