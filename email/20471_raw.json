If not, please point us to the proper \np=\r\nlace.\n\nJExample is an extensions that introduces dependencies. But unlike e=\r\ng TestNG, we go  beyond mere dependencies. We use \ndependencies to pass the=\r\n &quot;instance under test&quot; from one the test method to the next. If test B depe=\r\nnds on A, the return value of A \ncan be used as B&#39;s fixture. And if A test =\r\nfails, B and all other dependees of A are skipped and marked as white. We s=\r\nhow in an \nempirical study (accepted at the XP2008 conference) that JExampl=\r\ne improves performance, shortness of test methods, and defect \nlocalization=\r\n.\n\nLet me give an example :)\n\nTesting a stack is not trivial, there is an i=\r\nntrinsic dependency between pushing and popping elements. An element can no=\r\nt be \npopped without pushing it first. Intrinsic dependencies are evil. If =\r\nthere is a bug in push, both push&#39;s and pop&#39;s test fail, even if \nthere is =\r\nno bug in pop! Therefore, we declare that testPop depends on the successful=\r\n outcome of testPush. When running the \ntests, the return value of testPush=\r\n is used as the fixture of testPop.\n\n@Test\npublic Stack testPush() {\n      =\r\nStack s =3D new Stack();\n      s.push(&quot;Foo&quot;);\n      assertEquals(1, s.size(=\r\n));\n      return s;\n}\n\n@Test\n@Depends(&quot;testPush&quot;)\npublic void testPop(Stack=\r\n s) {\n      s.pop(&quot;Foo&quot;);\n      assertEquals(0, s.size());\n}\n\nUsing JExampl=\r\ne, each test method is a comprehensive constructor that creates an example =\r\ninstance of the unit under test. That is \nalso why JExample is called JExam=\r\nple. The idea of example-driven testing is based on the work of Markus Gael=\r\nli.\n\nYou can learn more about JExample here\n\nhttp://www.iam.unibe.ch/~akuhn=\r\n/blog/2008/04/jexample-quickstart/\nhttp://www.iam.unibe.ch/~scg/Research/JE=\r\nxample/\n\nDownload\n\nhttp://www.iam.unibe.ch/~scg/Research/JExample/jexample-=\r\nlatest.jar\n\nPlease give it a try (JExample is a seamless extension of JUnit=\r\n and even runs with the normal JUnit runner of Eclipse) and let us \nknow wh=\r\nat you think. \n\ncheers,\nAdrian\n\n\n",
