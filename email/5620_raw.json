Run a subset of tests during active development, all tests for\nintegration & build. Use techniques like Mock Objects to insulate things\nbeing tested, and to speed the tests.\n\n    It&#39;s nice to get a complete list of failures so that you\n    can attempt to fix as many as possible before having to dive into the build\n    process again...\n\nAs above, you need tools that support incremental development.  Batch\nmode development doesn&#39;t cut it anymore, especially not if you are\ntrying to be Agile (or, better yet, eXtreme).  Also, if you have\nmultiple failures, they may be ripple effects, although if you are\nwriting tests properly (which having them all in one method isn&#39;t) they\nshould be independent.\n\nThat raises another point:  If you have all your tests in one method (an\nextreme case.. even just multiple independent tests in the same method)\nyou loose the independence,  subsequent tests are sensitive to the\nactions of previous ones.\n\nDave\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nDave Astels\n  Coauthor of &quot;A Practical Guide to XP&quot; \n  Editor of the Test-Driven Development Edition of The Coad Letter\n  Presenter at XP2002 of: \n    the &quot;XP For One&quot; tutorial & &quot;Refactoring with UML&quot; paper \nCEO & Master Software Craftsman \n\nAn Agile Software Studio\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
