With regards to the last two points,<br/>\nwhich I think are definitely interesting:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) The main thing we were hoping to get with classes was help from the<br/>\ncompiler, based on a real-life experience (in a different context) in which<br/>\nsomeone checked in a test that should have been in the &quot;must pass&quot; group,<br/>\nbut mispeled the label name, causing a bug to slip through.  There was also<br/>\nthe thought that IDE&#39;s could help with renames and reference counts.  I&#39;ll<br/>\nleave it to more frequent users of the feature to say whether those have<br/>\nbeen worth it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d also take quite seriously any recommendations for how we could enable<br/>\nstring-based category names without breaking existing users.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) It&#39;s been quite a while since I&#39;ve thought of JUnitCore.main as the<br/>\nprimary &quot;runtime&quot; of JUnit.  It&#39;s been many, many years since I worked on a<br/>\nteam where invoking that directly was done with any frequency whatsoever.<br/>\n The vast majority of tests are run either through IDEs or build systems,<br/>\nwhich, as far as I&#39;ve seen, always bypass the command-line processing<br/>\nfunctionality of JUnitCore in order to implement their own graphical or<br/>\nXML-based configuration system.  So adding command-line options to<br/>\nJUnitCore has become rather low-priority in my book, since it would help<br/>\nsuch a small percentage of users.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s an explanation of the current status quo, which needs not<br/>\nnecessarily be maintained.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope that users and maintainers of other frameworks feel welcome to post<br/>\ntheir experiences with these other frameworks here.<br/>\n<br/>\n   David Saff<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Wed, Jan 23, 2013 at 7:41 PM, Charlie Poole &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:charliepoole@...\">charliepoole@...</a>&gt;wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; **<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi All,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve been holding my peace, since I figure you all don&#39;t particularly want<br/>\n&gt; a long<br/>\n&gt; dissertation about another test framework, running in a different language.<br/>\n&gt; However, Matthew&#39;s question seems to call for a clear answer so you can<br/>\n&gt; figure out which way you want to go.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On Wed, Jan 23, 2013 at 10:57 AM, Matthew Farwell <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:matthew@...\">matthew@...</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; **<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Ok. I&#39;m trying to understand what actually happens with NUnit. I mark a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; test as &quot;slow&quot;, and run all of the tests in my project. Are you saying<br/>\n&gt; that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; without selecting the category of tests to run, the IDE doesn&#39;t run the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; slow tests, that is it only runs tests which are not marked as slow? If<br/>\n&gt; &gt; this is so, how does it know which are the slow tests?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; In NUnit, I can mark a test as slow by annotating it [Category(&quot;Slow&quot;)].<br/>\n&gt; NUnit<br/>\n&gt; has no idea what &quot;Slow&quot; means or what to do with it. It&#39;s just a tag. In<br/>\n&gt; order<br/>\n&gt; to make use of the category I have to either specify it using a<br/>\n&gt; command-line<br/>\n&gt; option or select it in the Categories window of the NUnit Gui. In either<br/>\n&gt; case,<br/>\n&gt; I can choose to run all tests or just some categories. I can also choose to<br/>\n&gt; exclude some categories. There&#39;s actually more flexibility at the command<br/>\n&gt; line than in the Gui, since I can specify boolean combinations of<br/>\n&gt; categories<br/>\n&gt; there like &quot;Data-Slow&quot;, which means run all the Data category except those<br/>\n&gt; also marked as Slow.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Here are differences in the implementations, as I have observed them. It<br/>\n&gt; may<br/>\n&gt; not be complete and could even be dead wrong in the case of JUnit, so<br/>\n&gt; please<br/>\n&gt; correct me if I&#39;m off base:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 1. NUnit categories are strings. JUnit&#39;s are classes.<br/>\n&gt; 2. NUnit controls what categories to execute at runtime, without changing<br/>\n&gt; the code.<br/>\n&gt; JUnit requires changing the code or at least setting up suites for each of<br/>\n&gt; your commonly<br/>\n&gt; used categories in advance. I suppose some IDEs may allow runtime selection<br/>\n&gt; of categories for JUnit.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; These two differences appear to be orthogonal.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Regarding the first difference: I once spent some time considering<br/>\n&gt; emulating<br/>\n&gt; JUnit and using a Type rather than a string to represent a category. Use of<br/>\n&gt; a<br/>\n&gt; Type (class) is more sophisticated and appealed to me at first. In the end,<br/>\n&gt; I<br/>\n&gt; couldn&#39;t really point to an solid advantage to the user, so we still use<br/>\n&gt; strings.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Regarding the second difference: Runtime category selection is something<br/>\n&gt; NUnit users wouldn&#39;t want to do without these days. There seems to be no<br/>\n&gt; obstacle to allowing it in JUnit while retaining the ability to define<br/>\n&gt; suites as now.<br/>\n&gt; That&#39;s what I would do...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Charlie<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>",
