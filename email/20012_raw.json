I have came\n&gt; across various tools including XJB, EJBUnit, Embedded Jboss, Cactus, \n&gt; etc.. I am just\n&gt; wondering which solution is the most mature and most supported by the \n&gt; community. I need\n&gt; to be able to mock up JNDI so that I can test the persistance in my \n&gt; EJB&#39;s. \n\nI&#39;ve used MockEJB for that. Its MockContext worked well.\n\n&gt; I would like to test\n&gt; outside the container as I hear this is the best method for testing \n&gt; EJBs. Can anyone give me\n&gt; some suggestions and point me in the right direction. Any help would be \n&gt; greatly appreciate,\n&gt; a tutorial anything that will help get me started. I would preferable \n&gt; like a solution that can fit\n&gt; into a night build and test enviornment. We use Continuum to build and \n&gt; test our companies\n&gt; code everynight. If I could drive the EJB test cases from a Maven pom \n&gt; that would be a bonus.\n\nIt&#39;s getting older, but the suggestions in _JUnit Recipes_ have yet to \nbe replaced with better advice, at least in print.\n\nTake care.\n-- \nJ.
