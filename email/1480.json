Well, most probably I was not clear. I&#39;m sorry <br/>\n&gt;     &gt; for that. I&#39;ll try<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; again:<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; <br/>\n&gt;     &gt; After testing the model, I like to do integration tests <br/>\n&gt;     &gt; for model, control<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; and view. I do this by checking the view. But as the view <br/>\n&gt;     &gt; is used by users<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; only, there is no need to know state, at least for <br/>\n&gt;     &gt; programm components other<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; than the tests. This approach is (Did I get you right <br/>\n&gt;     &gt; now?) not favorable in<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; your eyes? Which would be your favorable approach?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It isn&#39;t a question of being favorable or not.  It is a question <br/>\nof &quot;Do you<br/>\n&gt; want to automate the testing of your GUI with JUnit?  And if so, to <br/>\nwhat<br/>\n&gt; granularity?&quot;  I think testing the GUI is always good, but there are<br/>\n&gt; limitations for JUnit to do this.  If there is pertinent state <br/>\ninformation<br/>\n&gt; that you want to capture (which it doesn&#39;t sound like there is) you <br/>\ncan use<br/>\n&gt; the approach I mentioned before.  If you simply want to test the <br/>\noverall<br/>\n&gt; look, a one-eyed inspection is fine.  If you want to <br/>\nprogrammatically test<br/>\n&gt; the overall look, something like SilkTest would probably be a good <br/>\nway to<br/>\n&gt; go.  I think that having state inspectors on every GUI component is<br/>\n&gt; overkill!  If there is some meta-state that your controller gets <br/>\nfrom the<br/>\n&gt; view to effect a change on your model, then write an inspector on <br/>\nyour<br/>\n&gt; controller for that, but not just for testing.  The test should <br/>\nreflect (to<br/>\n&gt; some degree) the usage.  Again, this isn&#39;t a silver bullet, it&#39;s <br/>\njust one<br/>\n&gt; example.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; MVC can be difficult.  If it is done improperly it offers many <br/>\ntraps!!  But<br/>\n&gt; done rightly, it&#39;s a wonderful tool.  Testing is easier, <br/>\nrefactoring is<br/>\n&gt; easier, etc.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -Jason </span></blockquote></div>",
