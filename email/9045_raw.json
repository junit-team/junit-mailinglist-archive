As I put the tests in the same package, but in another\n&gt; &gt; source tree, that would do the trick.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Should I have to make its &quot;unpublished&quot; quality more obvious, I&#39;d \n&gt; &gt; add a big red (html)  &quot;FOR TEST ONLY - DON&#39;T USE&quot; in the javadoc of \n&gt; &gt; the method. \n&gt; \n&gt; Reasonable strategy. In the face of the tools I currently use, I&#39;d\n&gt; probably think about alternatively deprecating it (in Eclipse, use of \n&gt; a deprecated method can be made very obvious, whereas I rather seldom \n&gt; take a look into javadoc).\n\nThat&#39;s my approach.  Jury-rig it until you can get some real tests in.\n Then remove the rigging.\n\nI have yet to be convinced that &quot;under normal conditions&quot; you ever\nneed or want to test private stuff.. things that are private are\nimplementation details.. and as such not part of the behaviour of the\nclass.\n\nDave\n\n\n",
