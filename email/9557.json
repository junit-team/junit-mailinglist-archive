However, C++ deals with much of this at compile time.<br/>\nThink template metaprogramming.  Typical benchmarks show C++ running at<br/>\n97% or so of the speed of C.  As you add interpretation, the speed goes<br/>\ndown.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is an old issue.  About 20 years ago, Intel had two candidate<br/>\nfuture CPUs.  One was the 386, and the other was the iAPX 432, a machine<br/>\ndesigned to run object-oriented languages, Smalltalk in particular.<br/>\nThis was an exciting project.  Books and papers were written on the<br/>\nsubject; people knew that this was the way of the future.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut after a bright beginning, the 432 project was destroyed by benchmarks<br/>\npublished by a team at the University of California at Berkeley.  These<br/>\nshowed the 432 being easily beaten by, as I recall, an Intel 8080 (8086?),<br/>\na commodity 8-bit processor.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe benchmarks were biased; they had been set up by the RISC team at<br/>\nBerkeley, who had a vested interest in seeing complex architectures fail.<br/>\nHowever, the point proven was that object-oriented programming techniques<br/>\nand run-time interpretation have a high overhead.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease bear in mind when considering these remarks that I was one of those<br/>\nexcited by the 432 ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJim Dixon  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jdd@...\">jdd@...</a>   tel +44 117 982 0786  mobile +44 797 373 7881</div>",
