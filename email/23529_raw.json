It turns out that the floats were being =\r\ncasted to doubles, so I modified the code so that the floats remained as fl=\r\noats. At the request of David Saff, I attempted to write a test that would =\r\ncause either the previous implementation that printed out thrown exceptions=\r\n with doubles, or my new implementation that does the same with floats inst=\r\nead, to fail. So far, I have only been able to write tests with wide variet=\r\nies of input that cause both implementations to fail, but not just one, jus=\r\nt because of the messy nature of floats and doubles. I have run out of idea=\r\ns of input to use (two float arrays to be compared against each other and a=\r\n maximum delta when comparing the floats in the two arrays) that would caus=\r\ne only one implementation to fail. Any ideas? \n\nRegards,\nJuan\n\n\n",
