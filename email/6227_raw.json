As such, I&#39;m presented with a fairly unique opportunity to\nestabl=\r\nish some standard practices for unit testing.\n\nA few things are obvious. Ye=\r\ns, writing unit tests for all new code\nshould be STRONGLY ENCOURAGED. Yes, =\r\nthe JUnit framework is what we\nwill use for launching our tests. \n\nSome are=\r\n less obvious, but I&#39;m still clear on what to do. For instance,\nwriting tes=\r\nts that include the database are often QUITE difficult. Not\neveryone has a =\r\ncopy of Oracle; we can&#39;t just erase tables willy-nilly\nto set up for each t=\r\nest; etc. So I will use mock objects (hopefully\nstarting from those at www.=\r\nmockobjects.com) to simulate the connection,\nand other &quot;external&quot; data sour=\r\nces/sinks.\n\nAnd there are a few questions on which I&#39;d like to hear input f=\r\nrom\nsome with more experience so I can start out using &quot;Best Practices&quot;\nins=\r\ntead of having to learn from my OWN experience.\n\nQUESTION 1:\n   Where do my=\r\n JUnit unit tests go?\n   \n   I see 3 likely answers... (a) make each an inn=\r\ner class of the\n   class being tested, (b) for every class &quot;Foo&quot; have a cla=\r\nss called \n   &quot;TestFoo&quot; in the same package, or (c) have a separate (but pa=\r\nrallel\n   hierarchy of classes... SOURCE/com/pkg/Foo.java is tested by \n   =\r\nTEST/com/pkg/TestFoo.java.\n\n   I lean towards (c) because it makes it easy =\r\nto build the &quot;real&quot; code\n   and the &quot;test&quot; code separately, and omit the &quot;t=\r\nest&quot; code from\n   production deployment. Are there other significant issues=\r\n here?\n\n\nQUESTION 2:\n   How do I automatically build the suite of all tests=\r\n?\n\n   For each class, I can have several methods called &quot;testXxx()&quot; and\n   =\r\ncan collect them into a suite to run at once. I can collect the\n   suites t=\r\nogether into larger suites, eventually coalescing into a\n   suite called &quot;R=\r\nunAllTests&quot; which does just that. But this requires\n   me to write each of =\r\nthese suites, and to remember to include each\n   and every test class. I&#39;d =\r\nrather if &quot;RunAllTests&quot; just magically\n   found all of the tests... that wa=\r\ny I couldn&#39;t forget to include\n   one and wind up with some tests that neve=\r\nr get run just because I\n   forgot a line in a suite. How do I create this =\r\n&quot;magical&quot; \n   RunAllTests?\n\n   Stray thought... if there&#39;s no simple soluti=\r\non in straight java,\n   I wonder if ant can help me to achieve RunAllTests =\r\nas an ant\n   target?\n\n\nQUESTION 3:\n   How do I &quot;turn on&quot; my mock objects wh=\r\nen tests are running?\n\n   The most straightforward use of mock objects is t=\r\no pass them\n   directly to the code being tested. However, (despite the fac=\r\nt that\n   this is a bit broader than simply &quot;unit&quot; testing), I plan to have=\r\n\n   a lot of tests that exercise an entire sub-system at once. For\n   examp=\r\nle, I might create the input file, run the command, and then\n   test the ou=\r\ntput file. But if this &quot;command&quot; opens a connection to\n   a database (or ot=\r\nher system), then I&#39;d like to return a mock\n   ResultSet instead of a real =\r\none. So the code that obtains a DB\n   connection has to look at some global=\r\n setting to see if we&#39;re in\n   &quot;test mode&quot; or &quot;real life&quot;. What is a good w=\r\nay to achieve this --\n   is it something I&#39;ll have to write for myself?\n\n\nI=\r\n&#39;m sure I&#39;ll have more questions also, but this email is QUITE long\nenough =\r\nas is. Thanks in advance for any feedback, suggestions, or\npointers to othe=\r\nr forums/FAQs for this kind of stuff.\n\n-- Michael Chermside\n\n\n\n",
