It does get deep, and<br/>\n&gt; in some cases, compiler-dependent, if I remember correctly.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; However, we did find that in some cases, the signature of the<br/>\n&gt; _Matcher_ could be improved.  What&#39;s the signature of hasEntry?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This is also pushing me to keep on my &quot;Dotmesh&quot; project, which would allow this:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; assertThat(result.entrySet()).contains(entry(&quot;Key&quot;, Date.class));<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [if the &quot;entry&quot; factory convenience method were written]<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;    David Saff<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
