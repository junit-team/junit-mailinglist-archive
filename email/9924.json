And there are 2 issue that i have to concern.<br/>\n1- the method insert record in a table, how can i test it&#39;s inserting <br/>\nright records ? Also , it&#39;s make mofification in other fields, <br/>\nrecalculating amount for example.<br/>\n2- I have to hardcode values for those beans, that means that i have <br/>\nto initiate those values at begging of each method ? which are the <br/>\nmore polite way to face this issue ?<br/>\n<br/>\n  Is the &quot;divide and conquer&quot; the only solution ?<br/>\nThank for your suggestions<br/>\nAdrian</div>",
