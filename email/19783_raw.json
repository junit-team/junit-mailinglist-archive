I \nalso ra=\r\nn your testcase, and the results are similar but different.  \nIn both cases=\r\n, I see the console showing only &lt;terminated..&gt;.  But \nin your test case, t=\r\nhe JUnit panel in eclipse shows the test being \nrun and the bar progresses.=\r\n  In my test case, the JUnit panel shows \nnothing being run and there is no=\r\n progress bar.  All it says at the \ntop of the JUnit panel is &quot;Launching Te=\r\nstLocalUserMapperService...&quot;  \nThen, the console show that the test has ter=\r\nminated.  \n\nI believe my test case is okay because it worked previously.  I=\r\n can \nalso run the same test case on my home computer.  But it does not \nwo=\r\nrk on my office computer.  I can&#39;t figure out what exactly is \ncausing ecli=\r\npse or Junit to not function.  Is there something that \nit depends on?  \n\nW=\r\nhen I try to debug the test case, it says &quot;Could not connect to \nVM.
