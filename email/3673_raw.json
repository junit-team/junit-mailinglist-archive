You may actually\nwant two clean VMs: one to write in and one to read in. Have Ant set a\nsystem property for you with the details of how to find the Java process\nand kick off the VM.\n\nI&#39;ve never done this with JUnit, though I had to do something very similar\nquite a while ago with an in-house test framework. The only real problem\nwas that some classes that were not serializable had to be wrapped or\nmanually martialed in order to set up the test data or do the comparison.\nFor instance, you can&#39;t (easily) control a Stream via RMI.\n\nOn Thu, 27 Dec 2001, difranr wrote:\n\n&gt; Alan E,\n&gt;\n&gt; I am having the same problem and have not yet found a way to get\n&gt; around it either.

Ideally, the first execution would create data,\n&gt; &gt; and the subsequent test would run in a fresh process, loading and\n&gt; &gt; verifying the data.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t even know how to get junit to start a new test in a new\n&gt; &gt; process. And I&#39;m having another problem which might be related:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Clicking &quot;run&quot; on the Junit window a second time after a successful\n&gt; &gt; first run always fails. ObjectStore applications load a native\n&gt; &gt; library on start-up. Subsequent times I try to run the same test, I\n&gt; &gt; get the following error:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; java.lang.unsatisfiedLinkError: Native Library\n&gt; &gt; c:&#92;odi&#92;osji&#92;bin&#92;o5osji_jdk.dll already loaded in another\n&gt; classloader.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Anyone know how I can get around this?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
