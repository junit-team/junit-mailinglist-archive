I find hamcrest very useful when using Java but<br/>\nI haven&#39;t found a case where I would use it with Groovy and it is unfortunate<br/>\ndesign that I have to include hamrest on the classpath to keep JUnit happy<br/>\nbut have no use for it. Some version which had a pom with hamcrest marked as<br/>\noptional (if it is present at all) is what I would like to see and (although<br/>\nsomewhat more controversial) I would have a preference for all class<br/>\nreferences to hamcrest done through reflection.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers, Paul.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 20/10/2012 4:34 AM, Marc Philipp wrote:<br/>\n&gt;  From my very personal point-of-view I cannot imagine using JUnit without<br/>\n&gt; Hamcrest anymore.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; @Paul: What would be the benefit of &quot;breaking the dependency&quot; entirely?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; @Mirko: Why shouldn&#39;t you be able to use a different version of Hamcrest?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Regards, Marc<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
