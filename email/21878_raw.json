Adams schrieb:\n&gt;  \n&gt; But yes, I think setting up a test, that is not dependant on any other\n&gt; test, is possible, but I would have to hard code a bunch of stuff in the\n&gt; tests, and I would have to put all of the tests in a single test, in\n&gt; order for them to succeed. And doing that would prevent a bit of my\n&gt; actual code from being tested.\n\nI don&#39;t know what type of application you developed, but that\nsounds not good.\n\n&gt; One other question is, can I trust the order of execution of the test\n&gt; methods in a single TestCase implemention? Or are all of them also\n&gt; supposed to be independent?\n\nThey are supposed to be independent but in reality most test-runners\n(Junit, Eclipse, Ant as far as I found out) go through the tests in\nthe order they are defined in the class. This might change with a\ndifferent version of the JVM/JRE returning the names of the methods\nin a different order when using Java Reflection but an order today\nshould stay the same tomorrow if none of these components change.\n\nIf you derive a test-class from another, the methods of the deriving\nclass will be executed first, then the methods of the superclass.\nSo if you depend on a specific order of executing the methods you\nshouldn&#39;t override classes or use the suite-methods (if they\nstill exist in JUnit 4, I&#39;m still stuck with the previous version).\n\n&gt; The reason I ask is because this is what is basically happening: There\n&gt; is an external ASYNCHRONOUS SOAP messaging system that is the core to\n&gt; all communication between several companies. Requests/responses can be\n&gt; sent to and from all of the participating parties. For testing purposes,\n&gt; so that my tests can be a little more controlled, I send requests and\n&gt; responses to and from my own server. i.e. I do not send to other\n&gt; companies, because I cannot guarantee they will respond within the time\n&gt; I need (seconds), even though technically, their test systems are\n&gt; supposed to be up and running.\n\nIf you abstracted the layer between your applicaiton and the messaging\nsystem you can simply define a mock that answers the requests for you.\nThat way you don&#39;t need to setup anything in advance. I&#39;m doing this\nhere e.g. for testing the parts of our software doing OFTP by ISDN.\n\n&gt; 1. submit request to my system, through the external system. This is\n&gt; effectively to test receiving requests from the external system, to me.\n&gt; i.e. I can send requests to myself, as if they were coming from someone\n&gt; else&#39;s system.\n&gt; 2. receive request from external system\n&gt; 3. queue job for nightly build of data\n&gt; 4. check for available data from nightly job, the next day\n&gt; 5. send available data\n&gt; 6. receive the data sent in #5, and email it out to a staff member\n\nFor this I see Ant or Maven a better fitting tool than JUnit. There\nyou have dependencies and all the things you need for data-transfer,\nemailing, etc.\n\nSo write an Ant script that is preparing everything as needed and\nstart e.g. the JUnit-tests that do the testing. With the optional\ntasks junit and junitreport you even end up with a nice HTML-page\nsimilar to a Java-API documentation showing you what tests failed\nand what succeeded. Combined e.g. with Cobertura you can see what\nparts of your application aren&#39;t under test.\n\n\nRegards, Lothar\n\n",
