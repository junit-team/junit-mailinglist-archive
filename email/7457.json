Could it be the case?  I tested the server and 2 clients locally (I <br/>\nhave no access to a network system) and it *seemed* (I don&#39;t know for sure <br/>\nthough) to work fine.  Am I missing something?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;However if the tcp connection is not closed properly (client disconnected <br/>\n </span></blockquote>from net,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;client OS crashed, ...) the server ist not informed by the tcp layer about<br/>\n&gt;it. For such cases you will have to add functionality to your server to <br/>\n&gt;actively detect them by a call to a client&#39;s method.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know how to implement this.  Right now, all the server&#39;s methods are <br/>\ndeclared in the remote interface, and the client gets a remote object of the <br/>\nremote interface&#39;s type to call its method.  If the server calls the client&#39;s <br/>\nmethod, would it be in another remote interface?  And what does the method <br/>\ndo, or just an empty method and may be some kind of Exception will be <br/>\ngenerated when called on?  <br/>\n<br/>\nAppreicate your further explaination, thank you again.<br/>\n<br/>\nSam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
