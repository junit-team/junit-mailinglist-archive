It tried to essentially \ncreate an English-like Java/business rules hybrid. It never reached the \npoint where nontechnical people could easily use it to do anything \nuseful, and that was its overriding goal. I suspect your goal is \nsimilar. It is a difficult goal to reach, so I suggest either throwing \nyourself into making ESL very easy for nontechnical people to use, or \ndon&#39;t bother trying. If you create something somewhat in the middle, \nyou&#39;ll just anger both sides. (I have plenty of personal experience on \nthis one.)\n\nAlso, please don&#39;t name interfaces with &quot;IF&quot; at the end. A good OO \ndesign doesn&#39;t distinguish among kinds of types: concrete classes, \nabstract classes and interfaces should all look the same. An interface \nis a role a class can play, so name it that way without extra \ndecoration. Let the Javadoc tell me it&#39;s an interface.\n\nI have tried something similar, and have found it difficult to do it in \na domain-neutral way. It always ended up looking like a clunky \nBASIC/Java hybrid. Let me suggest that you pick a business domain to \ntarget and concentrate on that. You&#39;ll be more effective that way, even \nif you reach fewer people.\n\nPlease don&#39;t think I&#39;m discouraging you. I&#39;m just trying to push you \ndown a brighter tunnel than the one you seem to be going down. :)\n\ndvydra2 wrote:\n\n&gt; In the spirit of &quot;release early, release often&quot; I&#39;ve decided to post\n&gt; my work in progress. All feedback will be greately appreciated. I am\n&gt; especially interested to hear whether such a tool can be helpful for\n&gt; your current project.  I apologize in advance for the lack of\n&gt; documentation, but I hope the examples are self-explanatory. If\n&gt; something is not clear please write me and I will create an FAQ right\n&gt; away.\n&gt;\n&gt; ESL homepage is http://javamentor.com/esl\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt;\n&gt; David\n\n=======================================\nJ.
