I&#39;m not talking about the annoying\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo ads appearing at the end of messages, I&#39;m talking about REAL\n&gt; &gt; SPAMMING,\n\nI suspect David is right. In my experience with Yahoo, they are very\ngood about nailing inappropriate use. After all, inappropriate\nadvertising is lost revenue to them (that advertiser should have paid\nfor the privilege). Unfortunately, the visibility of mailing lists at\nYahoo seems to have increased the level of spamming greatly (egroups\nwasn&#39;t as bad). I&#39;ve started making the lists I administer restricted\nso the list moderator has to approve new subscriptions. More work for\nthe moderator, but workable for lower subscription groups. It might be\ntoo much work for the moderator of this group though.\n\nRegards,\n\nRob\n\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nSend your FREE holiday greetings online!\nhttp://greetings.yahoo.com\n\n",
