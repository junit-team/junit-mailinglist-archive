It has direct support for fakes/stubs.\n&gt; \n&gt; EasyMock 1 had default return values/throwables for that,\n&gt; EasyMock 2 has stub return values/throwables for that.\n\nSo jMock &gt; EasyMock1, but jMock ~ EasyMock2 with regard to support for \nfakes.\n\n&gt;  &gt; 2. It makes ignoring method parameters easy.\n&gt; \n&gt; I agree, This was a major pain in EasyMock 1.\n&gt; The rationale behind this was that I found no way to make\n&gt; this refactoring-safe (reordering parameter refactorings should\n&gt; not break the test). In EasyMock 2, matchers can be defined\n&gt; directly in the method calls, allowing to ignore arguments,\n&gt; match only parts of an argument, and so on.\n&gt; You may even define your own matchers.\n\nThat sounds like an improvement. Since jMock&#39;s comparative \nrefactoring-unfriendliness is not a big cost for me, I&#39;m not moved to \nswitch to EasyMock2.\n\n&gt;  &gt; 3. Its support for complex parameter, method or invocation matching is\n&gt;  &gt; great.\n&gt; \n&gt; EasyMock 2 has much better support for that. Argument matchers\n&gt; are in my opinion better. Inter-mock dependencies can be defined.\n\nI would have to look at this.\n\n&gt;  &gt; If there is ever a 2nd edition of _JUnit Recipes_, I will replace all\n&gt;  &gt; the EasyMock example code with jMock.\n&gt; \n&gt; As the author of EasyMock, I am sad to hear that.\n&gt; Can you elaborate which features are missing in\n&gt; EasyMock 2 that are so crucial that you consider switching?\n\nIt&#39;s not a question of what&#39;s missing in EasyMock2. The reason is that \nsince 2003, I&#39;ve been using jMock exclusively as my dynamic mock objects \nlibrary, so that&#39;s what I know best. If I get on a project where they \nalready use EasyMock2, I&#39;m sure I&#39;d get used to it quickly and would \nprobably enjoy it.\n\n&gt;  &gt; The people who don&#39;t like jMock often say it&#39;s because declaring the\n&gt;  &gt; method names as strings makes refactoring more error-prone. That might\n&gt;  &gt; be the case, but I have never felt pain as a result of it.\n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s not only a problem when renaming methods.\n&gt; \n&gt; Reordering, adding, or removing parameters all break tests at runtime,\n&gt; and you have to adapt them manually to the new situation.\n&gt; Tests using EasyMock work after reordering and removing\n&gt; parameters, and after adding parameters if no matchers were used.\n\nSee above: you&#39;re right, but I find the cost to be low.\n\n&gt; And there is also the issue of code completion when defining expectations.\n&gt; With JMock, it does not work, you have to rely on text completion features.\n&gt; With EasyMock, it works like a charm.\n\nI do admit that this is a shortcoming, but I don&#39;t find that annoying \nwhen I use jMock. In fact, in an odd way, if I find I really want code \ncompletion when defining fakes or expectations, then perhaps my \ninterface is too complex. :)\n\nPerhaps.\n\nTammo, don&#39;t get me wrong: I really appreciate what EasyMock 1 did for \nme for 2 solid years, and EasyMock 1 is immortalized in _JUnit Recipes_. \nIt&#39;s just that I preferred jMock 1.0 to EasyMock 1, and I haven&#39;t had \nthe need to leave jMock yet. EasyMock 2 doesn&#39;t pull me and jMock 1.x \ndoesn&#39;t push me away.\n\nTake care.\n-- \nJ. B.
