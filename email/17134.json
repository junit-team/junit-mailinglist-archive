    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-590694139\">james_adams wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I have inherited some code which runs a suite of JUnit test cases (via<br/>\n&gt; junit.textui.TestRunner.doRun(mySuite)) and outputs the results of the<br/>\n&gt; test case either as &quot;.&quot; for a success, or &quot;.F&quot; for a failure, followed<br/>\n&gt; by the errors and a summary of the run results. So if I have three<br/>\n&gt; test cases in the suite, and the first and third test cases succeed,<br/>\n&gt; then the output file looks like &quot;..F.&quot; followed by the errors and a<br/>\n&gt; summary of how many successes/failures. There are about 80 test cases<br/>\n&gt; in the suite I&#39;m working with, and it is very time consuming and error<br/>\n&gt; prone to try to figure out which tests succeeded and which ones failed<br/>\n&gt; from a long list of dots and dot-F&#39;s. What I would like instead is to<br/>\n&gt; have the report look something like this:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; test-01-01: success<br/>\n&gt; test-01-02: failure<br/>\n&gt; test-02-01: success<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;errors&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;summary&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have looked at the JavaDoc for junit.textui.TestRunner and there is<br/>\n&gt; no way to specify how the final report comes out, more specifically no<br/>\n&gt; way to tell it to print the name of the test case and the result<br/>\n&gt; rather than either &quot;.&quot; for success or &quot;.F&quot; for failures.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Can anyone advise me how I can modify this behavior? Am I stuck and<br/>\n&gt; just need to write a parser to convert the &quot;..F.&quot; to a meaningful<br/>\n&gt; report as to which tests succeeded or failed (as in the above example)?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You&#39;re not stuck writing a parser. Instead, you can write a TestListener <br/>\nthat generates the kind of report you&#39;d like to generate. I&#39;ve taken the <br/>\nliberty of sending you (privately) a recipe from _JUnit Recipes_ on the <br/>\ntopic. I have found it easiest to use the JUnit-addons test runner and <br/>\nplug in whatever test listeners I want.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
