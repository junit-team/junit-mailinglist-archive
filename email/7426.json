Thats how I <br/>\n&gt; understand Design by Contract. You write your method definition and <br/>\n&gt; then you write the contract for it. Then you implement your method. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And then you need to somehow run the system through different scenarios,<br/>\nso it seems to me.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Now the great thing: When you compile your code the implementation <br/>\n&gt; can be checked whether it obeys the contract. If not, a compile error <br/>\n&gt; is thrown. That it!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Have you tried this? AFAIK, contracts are checked at runtime, not<br/>\ncompile time.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t know about JML, though I wonder how they would do it at compile<br/>\ntime...<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; No JUnit test needed! Not TDD needed! Besides <br/>\n&gt; this, a contract serves as a documentation.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Unit tests do that, too. They even serve as examples on how the code is<br/>\nexpected to be used - DBC doesn&#39;t do that.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; And it can use invariants <br/>\n&gt; which JUnit will always lack of.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>OTOH, DBC can&#39;t test the interaction of several objects as intensive as<br/>\nJunit can.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Now come on and don&#39;t tell me: &quot;We always used JUnit, most people do, <br/>\n&gt; why do you little inexperienced programer think you have a better <br/>\n&gt; idea than people like Gamma or Fowler?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;d rather suggest to *try* both your idea and Junit (and possibly even<br/>\nTDD) for a reasonable time and *then* report about your findings.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I am not satisfied with the JUnit and TDD &quot;paradigma&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s OK.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; They are <br/>\n&gt; originated because of a *poverty* in Java programing language. If <br/>\n&gt; Java would support proper Design by Contract and a compiler for that <br/>\n&gt; than no one would bother with JUnit and TDD.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That somehow contradicts the existence of EiffelUnit, doesn&#39;t it? See<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?DesignByContractVsProgrammerTests\">http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?DesignByContractVsProgrammerTests</a><br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, there are implementations of DBC for Java - and TDDers using it are<br/>\nreporting that DBC and Junit are rather complementing.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards, Ilja</div>",
