But then if we are accepting that testing<br/>\n&gt; &gt; public/friendly/protected methods adecuately test these methods, why not<br/>\n&gt;go<br/>\n&gt; &gt; one step beyond and say that black box testing is all we need? It seems to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; me that testing private methods is as useful and valid as testing<br/>\n&gt; &gt; non-private ones, just at a different level of granularity.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;snip<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;     yes, you may test private methods. But that is not what actually is<br/>\n&gt;intended by unit testing. The idea is to write tests for the unit and<br/>\n&gt;thereby to specify what this unit is capable of. The idea of unit testing is<br/>\n&gt;not testing per se. The cool thing is that you finish writing your unit,<br/>\n&gt;when your tests pass, which cuts down time in testing and implementation.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Which is why HttpUnit does black-box testing<br/>\nor<br/>\nTerminology, shmerminology<br/>\n<br/>\n:)<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, I do agree with you - methods labelled private shouldn&#39;t really <br/>\nneed to be tested - although after a serious refactoring you may end up <br/>\nloads of little methods that shouldn&#39;t be protected, nor package-protected, <br/>\nbut private... and testing some of them might be a nice idea.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have to say it&#39;s not something I&#39;ve ever worried about greatly - as was <br/>\npreviously said, testing the methods that use the private methods should <br/>\ncover it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJim<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\n<br/>\n                           *   Jim Cheesman   *<br/>\n             Trabajo: <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jchees@...\">jchees@...</a> - (34)(91) 724 9200 x 2360<br/>\n         On one hand, I&#39;m <br/>\nindecisive, but on the other, I&#39;m not.</div>",
