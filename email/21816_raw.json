We are calling this feature Rules\n(replacing the earlier name Interceptors).  You can download a\nsnapshot of this release from\nhttp://github.com/KentBeck/junit/downloads.  We are planning no new\nfeature for this version, and once the tagged bugs are resolved\n(http://github.com/KentBeck/junit/issues/labels/4.7), we will issue an\nofficial release candidate, but early feedback is very, very welcome.\n\nTechnical goodies follow.  Thanks,\n\n   David Saff\n\nThere are already rules you&#39;re probably familiar with from way back in\nJUnit 4.0:\n\n- The fundamental rule of JUnit: a test method is executed on a new\ninstance of its declaring class.  It passes if and only if it\ncompletes without throwing an exception.\n- The Before rule: a @Test method is preceded by all @Before methods\nin the same class.\n- The After rule: a @Test method is followed by all @After methods in\nthe same class.\n- The timeout= rule: if a @Test annotation has a timeout= property, it\nfails if it does not complete in under the given number of\nmilliseconds\n- The expected= rule: if a @Test annotation has an expected= property,\nit passes if it throws an exception of the given class name, and fails\notherwise.\n\nStarting with 4.7, you can add additional rules to methods in a class\nby declaring public fields in the class annotated with @Rule.  For\nexample, here&#39;s a test that uses the TemporaryFolder rule (&quot;All files\ncreated in the temporary folder during the test are deleted after the\ntest completes.&quot;):\n\n  public static class HasTempFolder {\n    @Rule\n    public TemporaryFolder folder= new TemporaryFolder();\n\n    @Test\n    public void testUsingTempFolder() throws IOException {\n      File createdFile= folder.newFile(&quot;myfile.txt&quot;);\n      File createdFolder= folder.newFolder(&quot;subfolder&quot;);\n      // ...\n    }\n  }\n\nWe&#39;re including implementations of the following Rules:\n- TemporaryFolder: delete temp files after test completion\n- ExternalResource: reliably set up and tear down an arbitrary external resource\n- ErrorCollector: collect multiple assertion failures per test method,\nand report all at the end\n- Verifier: turn a passing test to failing if an arbitrary condition\nis not met (all expected mock-object calls made, no ERROR lines in the\nlogs)\n- TestWatchman: Perform an additional task before and after each test\n(a custom log, for example)\n- TestName: remember the name of each test method, and make it\navailable during the test execution.\n- Timeout: like the timeout= rule, but applies to all methods in a\nclass, and can take a run-time value.\n- ExpectedException: like the expected= rule, but can check exception\nmessages, and other arbitrary assertions.\n\nFor more on using these rules, please see the release notes:\n\nhttp://github.com/dsaff/junit/blob/99a84a542f2ac532a8425fa0a77884902b1c01b0/doc/ReleaseNotes4.7.txt\n\nIn addition, you can implement your own Rules by implementing the\nMethodRule interface.  Here&#39;s a Rule that marks all tests as passing,\nas long as I&#39;m the one running them:\n\npublic class DavidsAlwaysRight implements MethodRule {\n\tpublic Statement apply(Statement base, FrameworkMethod method, Object target) {\n\t\tif (&quot;saff&quot;.equals(System.getenv(&quot;USER&quot;)))\n\t\t\treturn alwaysSuccess();\n\t\telse\n\t\t\treturn base;\n\t}\n\n\tprivate Statement alwaysSuccess() {\n\t\treturn new Statement() {\n\t\t\t@Override\n\t\t\tpublic void evaluate() throws Throwable {\n\t\t\t\t// do nothing: always success!\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t};\n\t}\n}\n\n",
