I agree lets not have<br/>\nthe &quot;don&#39;t system test with jUnit discussion&quot;. To me it seems that it would<br/>\nbe great if you could find a way to replicate enough of the data you don&#39;t<br/>\nown to be able to run your tests but I bet you wanted that like a million<br/>\ntimes yourself and since you&#39;ve been living with that for 3 years I bet<br/>\nmocking it out is not an option either, tough one :S<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout situation 2 I have been in the situation myself many times and<br/>\nalthough I always feel I missed some baby-step I should have taken or that I<br/>\nshould have checked something in before I started on this big thingy... I<br/>\nguess checing in with ignore is better than not checking in as long as you<br/>\ndon&#39;t ruin someone elses day... One concern I have is that you say that you<br/>\nwrite seeral tests and they are failing why not one at the time, is it like<br/>\na TODO list? is that why you feel safe to check them in?<br/>\n<br/>\n/Joakim<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 6/8/06, Brett L.

We<br/>\n&gt; can have a side discussion on the merits of that, but it&#39;s a fact. We have<br/>\n&gt; right now around 60 developers working across 10 projects. All 10 projects<br/>\n&gt; share a common architecture and supporting components. I&#39;d guess we have<br/>\n&gt; around 7000 unit tests across the 10 projects. Our coverage is a bit lacking<br/>\n&gt; but I know it&#39;s helped.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Here are 2 situations where we&#39;d use this:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Situation 1:<br/>\n&gt; Some of our tests acquire information from external systems we do not have<br/>\n&gt; control over. Those systems sometimes go through maintenance for a day or<br/>\n&gt; two or sometimes those systems clear out all of the test data and repopulate<br/>\n&gt; (I hate that we cannot own a part of the test data, but it&#39;s been a<br/>\n&gt; political issue for 3 years). When this happens, we need to update tests. It<br/>\n&gt; usually takes a 1 to 3 days to do that - often the information the test uses<br/>\n&gt; is externalized, we still have to find appropriate replacement keys. So we<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t actually update the test, we update the data driven part of the tests.<br/>\n&gt; While that happens, other development would lose out on CI or we&#39;d have to<br/>\n&gt; disable those tests. It&#39;d be nice to just put a 3-day delay on them. Then<br/>\n&gt; they&#39;d start running again automatically. So I guess the ignore is until a<br/>\n&gt; date and after that the test continues to run.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Situation 2:<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m working on something in the trunk. I want to write tests and check in<br/>\n&gt; my work. I could work in a branch, check in all I want and then make sure to<br/>\n&gt; merge that branch back into the trunk. However, if I do that, I have to keep<br/>\n&gt; the branch up to date with the trunk and vice versa - merging in both<br/>\n&gt; directions. This is a pain. So I&#39;d rather just write several tests. Put on<br/>\n&gt; the ignore, check them in. Then take out the ignore while I continue my<br/>\n&gt; development (better yet, maybe I could set some environment variable when<br/>\n&gt; executing tests to ignore the ignore!-).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We have a utility class called TimeBomb (we&#39;re still using JUnit 3.8.1).<br/>\n&gt; When we want to disable a test, we put a time bomb in the test. That test<br/>\n&gt; will eventually start to ACTIVELY fail in the near future.
