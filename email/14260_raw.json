I do have a \n&gt; few questions:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. If there are multiple @Before annotated methods in a class, are any \n&gt; guarantees made about what order they are invoked in? Same question for \n&gt; @After, @BeforeClass, and @AfterClass.\n\nShort answer is: no. JUnit is known for the fact that you cannot order the way your methods will be \ninvoked.\n\nTestNG is offering a logical ordering through dependency definitions (dependsOnGroups and \ndependsOnMethods that can be used on both configuration methods (JUnit name for them is @Before, \n@After, etc) and for test methods.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; 2. Is there any way to control the order in which tests are run? Or is \n&gt; that pretty much still up to the test runner like in JUnit 3?\n&gt; \n\nsame as above.\n\n&gt; 3. Is there any equivalent to the suite() method in JUnit 3? i.e. how do \n&gt; I bundle up several different test classes so they can be run as a group?\n&gt; \n\ndon&#39;t know. i would like to find out.\n\n&gt; 4. Java 5 is obviously required to build JUnit 4. Can it nonetheless run \n&gt; in Java 1.4? or is Java 5 pretty much required for anything that uses \n&gt; JUnit 4?\n&gt; \n\nIt cannot run on any JDK prior to 1.5 because it is based only on annotations. You can take a look \nat TestNG which instead is able to run in both 1.5 and prior 1.5\n\n&gt; 5. The GUI test runners don&#39;t appear to be in Version4 CVS. Will they \n&gt; return at some point?\n&gt; \n\nafaik no.\n\n&gt; 6. Why are Assert.failSame, Assert.failNotSame, Assert.failNotEquals(), \n&gt; and Assert.format now public?\n&gt; \n&gt; Any light anyone can shed on these questions would be appreciated. Thanks!\n&gt; \ni can see why failSame, failNotSame and failNotEquals can be public. You may use them. Not sure \nabout format.\n\ncheers,\n:alex |.::the_mindstorm::.|\n\n",
