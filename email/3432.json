    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-323743480\">All in all, JUnit has a wonderfully simple and effective user <br/>\ninterface.  There is , however, one behavior that I find troublesome.  This <br/>\nis the absence of a detailed stack trace when one runs only a single test <br/>\ncase (the second &quot;Run&quot; button).  Instead one only receives pass/fail <br/>\ninformation in the status bar (I&#39;m using the Swing UI).<br/>\n<br/>\nI often find myself in the case where one test of several has failed.  I <br/>\nmake the fix, and then want to test it again.  If I want detailed reporting <br/>\nI have to run the entire suite.  Some of my tests require time-consuming <br/>\nset-up operations, and when this is the case the overhead excessive.  Of <br/>\ncourse, at some point one needs run the complete suite, but when iterating <br/>\nbetween coding and testing it would be nice to have the full functionality <br/>\navailable for running a single test case.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone else have an opinion?<br/>\n<br/>\np.s. Forgive me if this issue has come up before, but I couldn&#39;t find it <br/>\nthe archives.  Also, one might argue that this is more of a development <br/>\nissue, but since it relates to the user interface, I&#39;ll go ahead and post <br/>\nit here.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDavid Olivier<br/>\nNaval Research Laboratory<br/>\nDigital Mapping, Charting & Geodesy Analysis Program<br/>\nCode 7440.2</div>",
