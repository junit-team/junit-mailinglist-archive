The throws Exception allows any failure during setUp to\nbe\n&gt; reported as a test Error (rather than Failure) by JUnit.\n&gt; \n&gt; Similarly, I often allow individiual tests to propagate Exception\nback\n&gt; to JUnit and let it report the Error. As a style issue, I sometimes\n&gt; catch semi-expected, but incorrect, Exception instances and cause\nthem\n&gt; to be reported as a Failure. That gets the Failure (test failed) vs.\n&gt; Error (something went wrong in the test that might be environmental\n&gt; rather than broken software) reporting by JUnit to be correct.\n\nRob,\n\nI do this myself, and have some classes to support it. I&#39;m posting\nthem as patches to junit this evening (once sourceforege is back up).\nYou can get them from lyophilizer.sourceforge.net, inside toolkit.jar.\n\nDave\n\n\n\n",
