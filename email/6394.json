Part of the reason<br/>\n&gt; for this is that if one test fails, you can re-run it during your<br/>\n&gt; debugging to see if you&#39;ve made progress fixing the problem.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If your tests aren&#39;t independent, you&#39;ll have to have some way of<br/>\n&gt; documenting which test&#39;s side effect allows your other test(s) to be<br/>\n&gt; run.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; As you point out, though, there&#39;s clearly a cost involved in making all<br/>\n&gt; your tests independent, and use the &#39;setup() and teardown()&#39; methods.<br/>\n&gt; If this cost is prohibitive, you may want to consider changing those<br/>\n&gt; tests that are currently separate, interrelated tests to be one<br/>\n&gt; independent test.  (I&#39;d to this by renaming your current interrelated<br/>\n&gt; test methods to be private helper methods, and have a larger &#39;test&#39;<br/>\n&gt; method call them in the order you want).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This is the approach I&#39;ve been taking, and its simplified things a<br/>\n&gt; great deal both in my own process, and when people use tests I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; written.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -Kevin Klinemeier </span></blockquote></div>",
