I&#39;ll use the<br/>\nmailing list for discussions, then respond at Stack Overflow.<br/>\nNow, in you response you write &quot;This isn&#39;t easy, and is discouraged,<br/>\nbecause JUnit doesn&#39;t encourage dependent tests.&quot;<br/>\nI&#39;m not quite sure what that means :-). Is is possible, or not? Looking<br/>\nat the source code, it might just look impossible, but maybe someone<br/>\nknows something I don&#39;t?<br/>\n<br/>\n    * If I may, could I ask you to clarify your question into either<br/>\n&quot;Cannot be done&quot; or &quot;Yes. It&#39;s discouraged, you do it by...&quot;?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd of course, from there on it gets messy :-)<br/>\nI know that JUnit doesn&#39;t encourage dependent test, and if our IDE of<br/>\nchoice had better support for Testng (who doesn&#39;t have this particular<br/>\nsentiment), we&#39;d just go down that route. But it doesn&#39;t, and now JUnit<br/>\ndoes support ordering, so we&#39;re trying to adapt to that.<br/>\nWith JUnit 4.11, we&#39;ve got a way. If we find a way to create our own<br/>\nMethodSorter (which I hope for), we&#39;re good. If JUnit should provide its<br/>\nown mechanism (which I might dream of, but not hope for), it would be<br/>\neven better. Until then, method names are it, and now we&#39;ve got methods<br/>\nnamed &quot;test01_insert&quot; and &quot;test02_copy&quot;. It&#39;s not ideal, and I&#39;m a bit<br/>\nsad that the test framework insists so hard to not support us in our<br/>\nusage pattern, but I think that ship has sailed.<br/>\nEirik<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, Matthew Farwell &lt;matthew@...&gt; wrote:&gt; Hi,&gt;<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;ve just answered your question on Stack Overflow&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13723125/create-my-own-methodsorter-f&#92;\">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13723125/create-my-own-methodsorter-f&#92;</a><br/>\nor-junits-fixmethodorder&gt; &gt; 2012/12/5 Eirik Lygre &lt;eirik.lygre@...&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\nI&#39;m looking at creating my own MethodSorter.
