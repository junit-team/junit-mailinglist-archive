I believe Joseph\nPelrine, possibly in this lecture\nhttp://oopsla.acm.org/ap/tutorials/tut66.html, mentioned several groups\nusing XP who thought they were doing a fine job of writing tests, only to\nfind on running their tests under a code coverage profiler (SilverMark&#39;s\nTest Mentor with code coverage profiling turned on), that they had missed a\nnumber of important functional variations/methods. The way I look at it, we\ntest because we admit we are fallible. Any tool or technique that, when used\nproperly, can help guard against that fallibility when we write our tests\nmust be a good thing.\n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nMike Silverstein, Lead Architect\tvoice:  (919) 858-8300 x29\nSilverMark, Inc.\t\t\tfax:    (919) 858-8308\n5511 Capital Center Drive\t\tmobile: (919) 669-5906\nSuite 510, Raleigh, NC 27606\t\ttoll free: (888) 588-0668\nhttp://www.silvermark.com\t\tmsilverstein@...\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Steve Freeman [mailto:steve@...]\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, April 24, 2001 7:32 PM\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: Re: [junit] Is coverage important? RE: Test Coverage Analysis\n&gt; To ol For Junit\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; RE: [junit] RE: Test Coverage Analysis Tool For JunitIf you&#39;re\n&gt; really writing code test-first you should find that you hit\n&gt; 98-99% coverage without breaking into a sweat. A couple of\n&gt; projects ago we hit this number the first time we ran a coverage\n&gt; tool 3 months into the project. The remaining fraction was missed\n&gt; exception handling and admin code.\n&gt;\n&gt; Steve\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; From: Houston, Greg (ISSAtlanta)\n&gt; To: &#39;junit@yahoogroups.com&#39;\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, April 24, 2001 9:56 PM\n&gt; Subject: RE: [junit] Is coverage important? RE: Test Coverage\n&gt; Analysis To ol For Junit\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Is coverage really that important?  The directive is to &quot;Test\n&gt; everything that could possibly break&quot;, not &quot;Test everything&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; Unit Tests give you great benefits in productivity and quality.\n&gt; I have worked on XP teams that measured both quality and\n&gt; productivity.  Unit Testing and XP does improve both!  However,\n&gt; there comes a point where more Unit Tests only marginally\n&gt; increases quality while not increasing productivity (even\n&gt; negatively impacting productivity).  Developers should question\n&gt; the value of creating more Unit Tests.  If you are not careful,\n&gt; you can get into a &quot;Test everything&quot; mode and kill productivity.\n&gt;\n&gt; Since Coverage metrics can lead the team to focus on &quot;Test\n&gt; Everything&quot;, it isn&#39;t a great measurement.  Instead, focus on\n&gt; &quot;things that could break&quot; and you will continue to gain both\n&gt; increased productivity and quality.   Only use Coverage tools to\n&gt; reveal something that could break.  Using coverage as a metric is\n&gt; a poor practice.  I suggest using quality metrics instead (i.e.\n&gt; number of Unit Tests and number of passing Functional Tests)\n&gt;\n&gt; - Greg Houston\n&gt; www.ISS.net\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
