I see it all the time. More specifically, I see people \nacting as though they do /not/ have permission to remove dead code. &quot;If \nit ain&#39;t broke, don&#39;t fix it&quot; and &quot;Don&#39;t touch it; it might break&quot;\n\n, can I use a factory here?,\n&gt; can I draw a UML-diagram on the whiteboard?, can I save it in\n&gt; documentation?, can I call a designmeeting?&quot; so why is unit-testing\n&gt; different?\n\nAnything that a project manager in particular might perceive as /extra/ \ntime is different. That includes refactoring, testing (we have a whole \ndepartment for that), design meetings, and so on. Of course, it depends \non what activities that project manager participated in himself when he \nwrote code.\n\n&gt; I think, if you manage to convince your team /first/ then management is as\n&gt; good as convinced when the results start showing.\n\n...but in the meantime, when the team goes through the chaos period, \nmanagement has plenty of time and opportunity to step and say, &quot;See? I \ntold you this stuff was extra effort. Why are you doing this? Stop \nwasting our money.&quot;\n\n&gt; I think by example is the best way to go, start with your self and influence\n&gt; those around you.\n&gt; \n&gt; /if/ you are convinced about the benefits of unittesting then /not/ doing\n&gt; unittesting would be unprofessional since you choose not to do it.\n&gt; So start doing it and infect the others. Don&#39;t have managment inject the\n&gt; virus into an unwilling team by placing demands on testcoverage etc.\n&gt; That will rebound in my experience.\n&gt; \n&gt; So, what do you think? Should we tell the story to our fellow developers\n&gt; instead of management?\n\nI don&#39;t understand why you would frame the question as &quot;instead of&quot;. Why \nnot &quot;in addition to&quot;? I think my manager deserve to know what I&#39;m doing.\n-- \nJ. B.
