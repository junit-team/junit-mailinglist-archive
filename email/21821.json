Did you still need me to create this bug?  If so, where do I need to submit this?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy solution I believe was to remove the timeout instead of doing each.get(2000, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);  I changed the source locally to each.get(); and the exception disappeared.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not certain this this is the right solution as I&#39;m not completely familiar with the framework.  You may want a timeout feature but my feeling is that it should somehow be configurable.  I would feel more comfortable if you or someone more experienced with this framework can make the fix.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease let me know if 4.7 has this fix.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nMike<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, David Saff &lt;david@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Wow.

Is there a significant reason for this versus get() without any timeout? In conducting test without JUnit test cases, I&#39;m finding this timeout feature creates timeout exceptions whereas running JUnit without the timeout allows my test to run successfully. Can anyone explain why this timeout is needed?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
