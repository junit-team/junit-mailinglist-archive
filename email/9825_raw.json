I think you were right before, in the general sense:\n&gt; &gt; Java deals with objects except for the primitive types.\n&gt;\n&gt; Ha ha, reading my own words I noticed another equivocation.  I guess\n&gt; this is just a slippery area. :-)\n&gt;\n&gt; To be precise I should have said:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Classes are always dealt programmatically in Java via an\n&gt; &gt; instance of the java.lang.Class class . . .\n\nThis is getting better.  Now I can see that you are saying that\nclasses are dealt with using an object, and therefore they _are_\nthat object.  Interesting.\n\nMay I submit that classes are dealt with using references, which are\nthemselves neither objects nor classes?  Oooo, this is tricky.\n\nPart of the murkiness here is due to my peculiar experience: I know that\nin reality Java at the JVM level is not a fully object-oriented language.\nCertainly that Java has no difficulty in distinguishing classes from\ninstances of classes (and certainly it delights in gotos and other things\nabominable to the OOPL community ;-)\n\n--\nJim Dixon  jdd@...   tel +44 117 982 0786  mobile +44 797 373 7881\n\n\n",
