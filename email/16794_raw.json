I have trouble with this because if\n&gt; Agitar can make observation=\r\ns then humans could write tests.\n\n\nYes, and for that reason, I don&#39;t think =\r\nAgitar will make a code base &quot;more\nTDD-able&quot; if that code base doesn&#39;t have=\r\n this quality in the first place.\n\nActually I disagree with the use of the =\r\nterm &#39;many&#39; and &#39;sometimes&#39;.\n&gt; It is always possible to write tests first. =\r\n The question is whether\n&gt; it is always practical.\n\n\nFair point, and I agre=\r\ne.  If the cost of doing TDD is more expensive than\ndoing &quot;regular&quot; testing=\r\n, it doesn&#39;t make sense to pick TDD (assuming that\nthe final product will h=\r\nave the same quality either way).\n\nSome of the situations I have encountere=\r\nd in the past and the present where\nTDD is not a practical choice are GUI o=\r\nr mobile developments (something I do\na lot these days).  I also work fairl=\r\ny regularly with very large code bases\nthat have grown organically over sev=\r\neral years, and again, practicing TDD at\nthis level would cost a lot more t=\r\nhan doing things traditionally.\n\nOf course, I make it a point in these circ=\r\numstances to try and improve the\nsituation as I go along, but again, it&#39;s n=\r\not always obvious to choose\nbetween a new feature and a cosmetic refactorin=\r\ng that might improve your\ncode base down the line.\n\nThis is why I like to w=\r\nork on open-source projects on the side:  it feels\nlike a breath of fresh a=\r\nir where your imagination and your principles can be\nlaw :-)\n\n-- \nC=E9dric\n=\r\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
