In this case, Test A is &quot;less than&quot; Test B. You might want =\r\nto run Test B first as a result.\n\nI&#39;ve seen two reasons for test ordering:\n=\r\n  * Optimization--getting the whole suite to run more quickly by not runnin=\r\ng tests that are guaranteed to fail\n  * Precise feedback--getting the most =\r\nspecific test failure possible and not be overwhelmed by the failure of a w=\r\nhole bunch of dependent tests\n\nI assume that only a few tests will fail on =\r\nany given run (I&#39;ve measured that failure counts follow a power law distrib=\r\nution). Because of this I prefer the JUnit Max-style optimization through t=\r\nest ordering and ignore the precision problem.\n\nRegards,\n\nKent\n\nOn Dec 30, =\r\n2009, at 12:11 PM, Charlie Poole wrote:\n\n&gt; Hi Kent, \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; It seems to me =\r\nthat a coverage tool like Clover could \n&gt; &gt; discover this information dynam=\r\nically with[out] the user having to \n&gt; &gt; specify more meta-information abou=\r\nt tests that could be wrong \n&gt; &gt; and would need maintenance. Isn&#39;t removing=\r\n tedium why we have \n&gt; &gt; computers in the first place?\n&gt; \n&gt; As far as I kno=\r\nw, coverage tools deal well with direct dependencies\n&gt; but not with logical=\r\n (interpretive) dependency.\n&gt; \n&gt; For example, if we have\n&gt; \n&gt; Test A --&gt; SU=\r\nT A --&gt; SUT B\n&gt; Test B --&gt; SUT B\n&gt; \n&gt; Even in this simple case, coverage an=\r\nalysis won&#39;t tell us anything \n&gt; about the relationship between A and B, al=\r\nthough we could make some\n&gt; deductions by examining the results.\n&gt; \n&gt; If th=\r\nere were some way to tell the framework &quot;Test A depends\n&gt; on functionality,=\r\n which is tested directly by B&quot; then I can\n&gt; imagine several good outcomes:=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) The test result output could be made much clearer - by\n&gt; emphasizi=\r\nng the B result when both tests had failed. Some\n&gt; approaches I can think i=\r\nnclude subordinating the A result \n&gt; to that of B, highlighting B, not show=\r\ning A at all and\n&gt; marking A as inconclusive.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2) Users would be discou=\r\nraged from seeking annotations that\n&gt; provide for direct ordering of tests =\r\nor the actual &quot;hard&quot;\n&gt; dependencies.\n&gt; \n&gt; 3) Less important, but as an opti=\r\nmization, the framework\n&gt; could suppress running of A if B had already fail=\r\ned.\n&gt; \n&gt; Charlie\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Kent\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; On Dec 29, 2009, at 2:28 PM, Pigneri,=\r\n Rocco wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Charlie,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;As a framework author, I ca=\r\nn see that allowing the user to specify \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;ordering is a simpler imple=\r\nmentation. But I think it&#39;s more \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;interesting to imagine the user sp=\r\necifying the nature of the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;dependencies and allowing the framework =\r\nto figure out a strategy.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I am very much with you on this one.=\r\n In my experience, \n&gt; &gt; there have been a lot of times when functions under=\r\n test \n&gt; &gt; within the same class depend upon each other, and it would \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nhave been great to have the test harness know that \n&gt; &gt; information. When I=\r\n was refactoring code for a new framework \n&gt; &gt; package, I would have loved =\r\nto have the UI to display \n&gt; &gt; non-dependent tests first as it would have s=\r\nhown me very \n&gt; &gt; clearly the source of the problem.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Specifyin=\r\ng only the relationships in code and leaving the \n&gt; &gt; display strategy to t=\r\nhe test harness would allow more \n&gt; &gt; flexible display and execution of the=\r\nse tests based upon the \n&gt; &gt; user&#39;s goals rather than upon the dependencies=\r\n themselves. I \n&gt; &gt; could imagine myself asking the UI only to display the =\r\nleast \n&gt; &gt; dependent functions&#39; errors and to hide all other errors for \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; quick debugging on sweeping optimizations. I could also want \n&gt; &gt; to see =\r\nthe dependent tests in a tree in case I am changing a \n&gt; &gt; single class and=\r\n want to understand the effects of what I am \n&gt; &gt; touching. I could also wa=\r\nnt to see all tests in a single list \n&gt; &gt; with the least dependent at the t=\r\nop and the most dependent on \n&gt; &gt; the bottom when running regression tests.=\r\n As you can see, the \n&gt; &gt; chosen view depends more upon what I am doing tha=\r\nn upon the \n&gt; &gt; test dependencies themselves.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Finally, being a=\r\nble to list dependencies between test \n&gt; &gt; classes in addition to test case=\r\ns would also JUnit to report \n&gt; &gt; which components of the system depend upo=\r\nn each other. This \n&gt; &gt; simple extension would greatly increase the power o=\r\nf the \n&gt; &gt; dependency models for larger systems (particularly regression te=\r\nsts).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thank you,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Rocco\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: junit@y=\r\nahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] \n&gt; &gt; On Behalf \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Of Char=\r\nlie Poole\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sent: Thursday, December 24, 2009 12:09 AM\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To: junit@=\r\nyahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: RE: [junit] Order of execution for tests\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi C=E9dric,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; On another list, I identified the s=\r\name variations of dependency \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but with the variation that for cas=\r\ne 1. We might run B \n&gt; &gt; anyway but \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; could highlight the error in=\r\n A in some way. That \n&gt; &gt; approach doesn&#39;t \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; require ordering the =\r\ntests in any particular way, which \n&gt; &gt; has some advantages.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It s=\r\ntill promotes developer efficiency while not worrying about \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; exec=\r\nution efficiency.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, we call these &quot;soft depend=\r\nencies&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If &quot;b&quot; has a hard dependency on &quot;a&quot; and &quot;a&quot; fails,=\r\n &quot;a&quot; will be \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; marked &quot;FAILED&quot; and b &quot;SKIPPED&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If &quot;=\r\nb&quot; has a soft dependency on &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot; will still run \n&gt; &gt; even if &quot;a&quot; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; fails but a warning could be displayed in the log.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; This is =\r\nan implementation-based view of the tests: i.e. they will \n&gt; &gt; &gt; either be =\r\nrun or not run.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The distinction I was trying to make - and I t=\r\nhink David as \n&gt; &gt; well - is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; based on the cause and nature of the de=\r\npendency.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; For the sake of argument, I&#39;ll try to redefine what you&#39;re =\r\ncalling \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hard and Soft along those lines.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hard: Test A d=\r\noes something (sets state) upon which B depends.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; For example, A may w=\r\nrite to a data store and B might try to \n&gt; &gt; read the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; information ba=\r\nck. Or A might create a complex object and B \n&gt; &gt; might try \n&gt; &gt; &gt; to call =\r\na method on that object. If we allow this sort of \n&gt; &gt; thing, then \n&gt; &gt; &gt; t=\r\nhere is no choice but to run A first and it makes sense to \n&gt; &gt; not run B \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; at all if A fails. However, I would not want a unit test \n&gt; &gt; framewo=\r\nrk to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; allow it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Soft: Test A tests some functionality u=\r\npon which some other \n&gt; &gt; &gt; functionality, tested by B, depends. Therefore,=\r\n if test A \n&gt; &gt; fails, Test \n&gt; &gt; &gt; B will either fail as well or be inconcl=\r\nusive, so nothing \n&gt; &gt; further can \n&gt; &gt; &gt; be learned from test B. In this c=\r\nase, a testing framework could \n&gt; &gt; &gt; respond in a number of ways to the de=\r\npendency:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 1) Run the tests in order, skipping B if A fails.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 2) =\r\nRun the tests in an arbitrary order, but skip B if A already ran \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and=\r\n failed.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 3) Run the tests in an arbitrary order, not skipping any of =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; them but \n&gt; &gt; &gt; organize reporting in such a way that a failure of A t=\r\nakes \n&gt; &gt; precedence \n&gt; &gt; &gt; over a failure of B.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; As a framewor=\r\nk author, I can see that allowing the user to specify \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ordering is a =\r\nsimpler implementation. But I think it&#39;s more \n&gt; &gt; &gt; interesting to imagine=\r\n the user specifying the nature of the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; dependencies and allowing the=\r\n framework to figure out a strategy.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Charlie\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ev=\r\nery time we have discussed this potential feature for \n&gt; &gt; TestNG, the \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; discussion ended up being non conclusive on the real interest and \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; the existing ability to mark certain methods as \n&gt; &gt; &quot;alwaysRun&quot; alrea=\r\ndy \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fills a big part of this scenario, so I always ended up \n&gt; &gt; pu=\r\nnting on \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it, but I&#39;d be happy to hear if someone can come up with =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; a good use \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; case for soft dependencies...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; ***C=E9dric\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of =\r\nthis message have been removed]\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -----------=\r\n-------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yahoo!
