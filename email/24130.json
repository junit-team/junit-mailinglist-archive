Although it can consume a fair amount of bandwidth, disk space, and<br/>\nwaiting time to pull down the full project for editing, these days I find<br/>\nthat the sum of those costs is less than the cost of my time trying to<br/>\nfinagle a specialized one-off project configuration to exclude some of the<br/>\ndependencies.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs this something you regularly find possible with vi and bash?<br/>\n<br/>\n   David<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Tue, Nov 27, 2012 at 2:11 PM, Fenn &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:fenn@...\">fenn@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; **<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; hi folks,<br/>\n&gt; I am a old command-line loving unix geek, but I want to get trendy and<br/>\n&gt; learn at least one IDE. Up until now vi+BASH has been my IDE of<br/>\n&gt; choice. I also already program in about two dozen languages.<br/>\n&gt; To try out my sea legs I want to compare and contract Eclipse,<br/>\n&gt; Netbeans, and IntelliJ IDEA against the following use case:<br/>\n&gt; I need to grock some java code in an existing SVN repository. I want<br/>\n&gt; to pull down one existing java file, write some junit tests, but not<br/>\n&gt; pull down the entire giant project it is attached to. I may need some<br/>\n&gt; moch objects too just to get it to compile, and to make the junit<br/>\n&gt; tests work.<br/>\n&gt; Most of the how-to and intro stuff I can find on these IDEs starts<br/>\n&gt; with &quot;so you make your FIRST project, then pull down some menus, and<br/>\n&gt; the wonderful IDE helps you type in your FIRST java program, then if<br/>\n&gt; you really want to you can save the entire project in CVS!&quot; This is<br/>\n&gt; hardly EVER the scenario I run into. It is more likely I need to jump<br/>\n&gt; into the middle of thousands or millions of existing files and learn<br/>\n&gt; to swim without breaking anything, maybe even fix a bug or add a<br/>\n&gt; feature.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Can anyone give me some tips on the &quot;best&quot; way to do this with his or<br/>\n&gt; her favorite IDE and some selection of plugins?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Brian Fennell<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>",
