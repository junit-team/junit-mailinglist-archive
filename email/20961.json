One of the problems is that<br/>\neach of the runners out there (Eclipse, IntelliJ, Ant, Maven) has their own<br/>\nmechanism to run tests and report results. They don&#39;t generally go through<br/>\nJUnitCore, so we don&#39;t have a hook to add our own logging.<br/>\n <br/>\nYou&#39;ll have to hack something up if you want it now. Your custom runner idea<br/>\nwould work but might be fragile. Another possibility is to put together<br/>\nminimal plug-ins for Eclipse and IntelliJ (Eclipse, anyway, offers an<br/>\nextension point for tracking test runs) and a task for your build system to<br/>\ndeposit reports in some central location. This would be more work than the<br/>\nrunner, but would leave you free to use custom runners for other purposes.<br/>\n <br/>\nThe bigger issue is how to offer a test runner API that all the UIs would be<br/>\nsatisfied using and would offer universal extension points. I&#39;m tempted to<br/>\ncall a workshop for all the potential consumers of such an interface and see<br/>\nhow much we could get done in a week.<br/>\n <br/>\nRegards,<br/>\n <br/>\nKent Beck<br/>\nThree Rivers Institute<br/>\n<br/>\n  _____  <br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>] On Behalf Of<br/>\nuly562000<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, October 08, 2008 9:22 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [junit] Adding a listener without using core?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nContext: I am writing code that monitors the frequency, timing, and<br/>\nresults of tests, and the code needs must run from eclipse, intellij,<br/>\netc, relatively invisibly to the user.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as I can tell, the only way to add a listener is to do it<br/>\nthrough the JUnitCore class. Unfortunately, I can&#39;t use the standard<br/>\nformula of running from main().<br/>\n<br/>\nIs there a way to add a listener from elsewhere in the dynamic object<br/>\ntree?<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a deliciously crude hack: Use RunsWith and a custom runner,<br/>\nthen change the invokeMethod statement so that I can gather the info I<br/>\nneed. It would be so much nicer if I could just add a listener, tho,<br/>\nbecause my hack would require me to extract all the info, which in<br/>\nfact a listener already gets all nicely packaged.<br/>\n<br/>\nIdeas?<br/>\nHill<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
