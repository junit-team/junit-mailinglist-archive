    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1588909575\">We&#39;ve used a Virtual Frame Buffer (VFB) in the past to get around this<br/>\nsort of problem. A VFB renders to main memory instead of to a graphics<br/>\ncard and basically gives you an easy way to simulate an X server for<br/>\ntesting purposes. XFree86 includes a VFB server and most UNIX operating<br/>\nsystems (e.g. AIX) seem to include a VFB facility somewhere.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Fri, 19 Oct 2001, Chester Kustarz 2 wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Hello,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am using junit to test some AWT based UI classes that are used in an applet.<br/>\n&gt; Under Windows, everything works just fine. When I move over to unix, things<br/>\n&gt; are ok so long as I am running a X-Display Server. If I don&#39;t then strange<br/>\n&gt; classloading exceptions start being thrown. All of my non-gui unit tests<br/>\n&gt; still run fine of course.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This would be ok except that I run a daily build every night from cron<br/>\n&gt; that does a checkout, compile, and unit test. This unit tests for the GUI<br/>\n&gt; classes fail because there is no X-Display attached. My current solutions<br/>\n&gt; are:<br/>\n&gt; \t1. Only run GUI tests on windows (works, but lame)<br/>\n&gt; \t2. Create a &quot;fake&quot; X-Display on unix so the GUI tests can run<br/>\n&gt; \t   (I have no idea how to do this)<br/>\n&gt; \t3. Something else I didn&#39;t think of<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Has anybody else run into this sort of thing? If so, how did you approach<br/>\n&gt; a soltion?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Also of note, the GUI unit tests do not actually display anything. They<br/>\n&gt; create, manipulate, add/remove AWT components but never actually write<br/>\n&gt; anything to the Display (and therefore don&#39;t read from the Display<br/>\n&gt; so I don&#39;t need any features like java.awt.Robot or anything).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nEric Vought<br/>\nChief Technical Officer - QLUE Consulting, Inc.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:evought@...\">evought@...</a> toll-free: 888-771-3538  RTP area: 919-816-9901 </span></blockquote></div>",
