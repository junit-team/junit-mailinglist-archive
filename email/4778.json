These tests lean more towards being functional tests and <br/>\n&gt; rely on multiple failures being handled correctly. There have been <br/>\n&gt; several opinions on this list in support of multiple failures for <br/>\n&gt; functional tests. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I like multiple failures when I&#39;m writing functional tests, too. <br/>\nThat&#39;s a different problem than what is solved by JUnit.<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; What I would like to know is the reason TestCase inherits from <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Assert <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; rather than delegates to it. If it delegated, we could subclass <br/>\n&gt; TestCase to handle multiple failures and still use Assert for DbC.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>History, in part. Assert and TestCase were once a single class. Then <br/>\nwe noticed that assert* and fail* didn&#39;t depend on any instance <br/>\nstate, so we could make them into their own class. By making them <br/>\nstatic we could make them easily accessible outside test cases <br/>\nwithout any cost within.<br/>\n<br/>\nCan you write up the behavior you&#39;d like to see as a test case? <br/>\nPerhaps it is possible to satisfy all constraints.<br/>\n<br/>\nKent</div>",
