Out goes a<br/>\n&gt; request, then if no money comes in out go a series of reminders.<br/>\nWhen the<br/>\n&gt; money comes in it has to be matched to the original request. If the<br/>\namount<br/>\n&gt; is wrong, someone needs to figure out how to reconcile the<br/>\nsituation. The<br/>\n&gt; business logic in such situations can be incredibly complicated,<br/>\nprimarily<br/>\n&gt; because of the wide range of scenarios that happen in real life.<br/>\nPart of the<br/>\n&gt; challenge is automating as much processing as possible, but balance<br/>\nthis by<br/>\n&gt; asking for manual assistance any time the business or the<br/>\nrelationship with<br/>\n&gt; the customer might be put at risk.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; &quot;Stability&quot; means how stable the API is that is being tested. An<br/>\ninterface<br/>\n&gt; that changes daily (not just accretion, but actual changes) probably<br/>\n&gt; shouldn&#39;t have automated tests--they are just a pain.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; &quot;Reliability&quot; means how likely the programmer is to make a mistake while<br/>\n&gt; programming. Code that is dead simple doesn&#39;t benefit much from<br/>\ntests, while<br/>\n&gt; writing code with lots of logic and interactions can be helped by tests.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Regards,<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Kent Beck<br/>\n&gt; Three Rivers Institute<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   _____  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>] On Behalf Of<br/>\n&gt; toalexsmail<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, September 23, 2008 12:28 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: [junit] Re: Where to test?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hi, Kent!<br/>\n&gt; Your example with Chart API is good. However, your example with<br/>\n&gt; payment processing is completely nightmare for me. I didn&#39;t understand<br/>\n&gt; what does the application, what client thought and what what problem<br/>\n&gt; you strike with. I also didn&#39;t understand your Stability and<br/>\n&gt; Reliability aspect. I guess this is because I didn&#39;t understand your<br/>\n&gt; payment processing example. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --- In junit@yahoogroups. &lt;mailto:junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt; com, &quot;kentb&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;kentb@&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; All,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Last week on succeeding days I encountered two situations, one where<br/>\n&gt; &gt; system-level tests were valuable and unit tests would have been<br/>\n&gt; useless and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; one where the reverse was true. Since simply the level of the tests<br/>\n&gt; is not<br/>\n&gt; &gt; sufficient to decide where to test, I thought a bit more about how I<br/>\n&gt; should<br/>\n&gt; &gt; decide where to test. I came to three criteria:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; * The cost of writing and running the test<br/>\n&gt; &gt; * The stability of the interface the test is, errr..., testing<br/>\n&gt; &gt; * The reliability of the code satisfying the test<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I wrote this up in a little paper:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; www.threeriversinstitute.org/WhereToTest.html.
