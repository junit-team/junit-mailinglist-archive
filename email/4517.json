If you want to keep your test classes <br/>\ncompletely separate from the classes tested, then you&#39;ll only be testing <br/>\nthe public interface (and you need to feel certain all your private <br/>\nmethods work when they can only be tested indirectly via the public <br/>\ninterface). If you want to test private methods directly, you must run <br/>\nyour tests as inner classes.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy do you think tests &quot;obscure&quot; the code base, though? If you use an <br/>\ninner class, just put it at the very bottom of the source file, and <br/>\nprogrammers should be able to just ignore it. If you use a consistent <br/>\nnaming scheme, programmers can also ignore test methods in whatever IDE <br/>\nyou&#39;re using. Alternately, you could put the tests in separate classes <br/>\nin the same package, so you can test package-local methods.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, i don&#39;t like the idea of putting unit tests in a separate <br/>\npackage, for two reasons - first, the tests would only have access to <br/>\npublic methods, not package or private methods. This makes test-first <br/>\ncoding harder, as the private methods can only be observed indirectly. <br/>\nAnd second, it makes it too easy to ignore the test suite, &quot;just this <br/>\none time&quot;, which leads to untested code. But this is very much my own <br/>\nopinion on how things should be done.<br/>\n-- <br/>\n<br/>\nDavid Stagner<br/>\n<br/>\nNational Marrow Donor Program<br/>\n3001 Broadway Street NE<br/>\nBroadway Ridge Suite 500<br/>\nMinneapolis, MN  55413<br/>\n<br/>\nEmail: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dstagner@...\">dstagner@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!
