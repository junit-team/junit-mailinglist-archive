But I don&#39;t believe that 100% <br/>\ncoverage is important.  My experience has been<br/>\nthat you get about 30% coverage by doing almost<br/>\nany testing at all.  That is almost a freebee.<br/>\nGoing from 30% to 60% coverage is a huge win<br/>\nin terms of finding bugs, and is absolutely the<br/>\nsecond kind of testing you should do.  Getting<br/>\ncoverage numbers up from 60% to 80%-90% is <br/>\nvaluable too, but you need to juggle this value<br/>\nagainst other valuable forms of testing.<br/>\n(Load testing, for example.)  So you may want<br/>\nto do load testing after your coverage numbers<br/>\nare at 60%, but before you push them to 80%.<br/>\nMoving above 80%-90% coverage takes a lot of<br/>\nwork, and may not be cost effective.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think going from 30% to 60% testing coverage<br/>\nis the second kind of testing you should do.<br/>\nThe first kind is what I call &quot;user first<br/>\nexperience testing&quot;.  You can&#39;t really do this<br/>\nwith junit (unfortunately).  Basically this is<br/>\ntaking someone who has never used the product<br/>\nbefore, and watching them find/install/learn/use<br/>\nthe product for the first time.  That is the <br/>\nmost valuable form of testing, because it is<br/>\nabsolutely the first thing all customers will<br/>\ndo with you product.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoshua Levy<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
