If I am running tests on the desktop<br/>\nI usually want to stop on the first failure, fix it and move on to the<br/>\nnext one.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we are running a large set of automated tests for a build of an<br/>\nentire system that has code that spans multiple developers, it may be<br/>\npreferable to complete the entire test with a report of multiple errors<br/>\nthat the developers can scurry off with and recreate on their own, one<br/>\nerror at a time. On the other hand it some times works out better to run<br/>\nthe build tests and stop on the first error, with developers taking<br/>\nturns in the &#39;hot seat&#39; to fix their problem and start the build tests<br/>\nagain. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt really depends on which approach is most efficient for the team,<br/>\ngiven the application under test and the length of time it takes to run<br/>\nthe complete set of tests. <br/>\n<br/>\n-----------------------------<br/>\nMike Silverstein<br/>\nSilverMark, Inc.<br/>\nThe Object Testing Company<br/>\nwww.javatesting.com<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\nOutgoing mail is certified Virus Free.<br/>\nChecked by AVG anti-virus system (http://www.grisoft.com).<br/>\nVersion: 6.0.541 / Virus Database: 335 - Release Date: 11/14/2003</div>",
