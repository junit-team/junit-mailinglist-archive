Oh -<br/>\n&gt;&gt; I&#39;m not writing much new code.  Most of the unit tests are for code<br/>\n&gt;&gt; that already exists for which I&#39;m fixing bugs.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Good luck with that. I strongly recommend you also try to test-drive a<br/>\n&gt; bunch of code, because that will teach you the goal for refactoring the<br/>\n&gt; legacy stuff. If you don&#39;t know where you&#39;re going, how do you know you<br/>\n&gt; got there?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>J.B., I&#39;m probably being block-headed but I don&#39;t quite get what you<br/>\nmean.  Can you say a little more about that?<br/>\n<br/>\nthanks!<br/>\n<br/>\nChris</div>",
