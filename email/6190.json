The problem <br/>\n&gt; is my Visual Source Safe files that are left in every <br/>\n&gt; directory, and always named the same. Is it possible to to <br/>\n&gt; get Eclipse to ignore duplicate files?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t use VSS so I don&#39;t know what files you mean, but I do wonder why<br/>\ntheir part of the project.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; \tAlso, when you specify multiple input directories like <br/>\n&gt; this, doesn&#39;t bunch all of your class files from the various <br/>\n&gt; directory structures together? I tend to like to keep my <br/>\n&gt; class files in the same directories as their respective java <br/>\n&gt; files, but that&#39;s just me...<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My philosophy is that, when adopting a new language, you should adopt the<br/>\ncommon conventions with that language.  When I did C and assembler, I kept<br/>\nthe object files in the same directory as the source.  With java, that&#39;s not<br/>\nthe normal convention.  I quickly found that many tools, including some of<br/>\nSun&#39;s, did not handle things gracefully with that convention once the source<br/>\noccupied more than one directory.  Therefore I always set an output<br/>\ndirectory for the class files.<br/>\n<br/>\nI realize that neither of these answers help you do what you&#39;re trying to<br/>\ndo.  They only raise questions about what your trying to do.  I&#39;m sorry I<br/>\ndon&#39;t have any better help.<br/>\n<br/>\n - George</div>",
