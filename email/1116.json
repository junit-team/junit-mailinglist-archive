This gets a little more tricky<br/>\n&gt; when the results data contains time-sensitive fields (i.e. date fields).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Anyway, I just wanted to know whether anyone had come up with a simpler<br/>\n&gt; and/or better solution.<br/>\n <br/>\n </span></blockquote>What I do for this sort of thing (not databases, mind you) is to<br/>\nuse the output from toString() as the test.  If that isn&#39;t suitable,<br/>\nI&#39;ll make a method that suits the test better.   This method can<br/>\nreplace things like time-sensitive fields with fixed values so that<br/>\ntests don&#39;t break.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy tests send up being simple assertEquals against two strings,<br/>\none coming from a static constant, the other from the result object.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wrote a little tool in perl that reads an input file and writes a<br/>\njava statement that reproduces the file as a string.  I&#39;ve used this<br/>\nto take captured results and convert them to reference data for use in<br/>\nUnit tests.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJoi Ellis                    Software Engineer<br/>\nAravox Technologies          <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:joi@...\">joi@...</a>, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:gyles19@...\">gyles19@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\nNo matter what we think of Linux versus FreeBSD, etc., the one thing I<br/>\nreally like about Linux is that it has Microsoft worried.
