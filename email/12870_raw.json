Now we are developing one prototype.According to the client, we have to generate  unit test result reports using ANT scripts.\n         But the code generated by our tool contains lot of private methods.And also the main functionality and the logic is included in these private methods. Even the  public methods are taking objects as parameters. \n        Plz keep the above mentioned and give me any suggestions how can we test the methods that are taking objects as parameters using Junit ?\n \nthanks&regards\nsuneel\n \n \n\n\t\t\n---------------------------------\nDo you Yahoo!?\n Yahoo!
