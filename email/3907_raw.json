Actually write\nthe simplest thing that make your code compile.\n6) compile. Now it should compile! :)\n7) run the tests, they should fail!\n8) fix the unit to make your tests run\n9) run you tests, they should run now!\n10) you are done!\n\nDuring the day, i&#39;m working for a contract that needs\nto add unit testing (and mockobjects) to an existing\nlibrary and i meet the same problems that you have....\nI have to rewrite some things to  make the ctor\nsimpler, but without unit testing how do i know that i\nbroke anything ?.... Adding unit testing to something\n(class or library) is a very risky process that&#39;s why\nit should not be done this way.\n\nI used to write my class before my unit test, till   i\ndecided  to try to write my test first (as everybody\nsays in the XP community)... it completly change my\nlife (aka my way to code! :))\n\nHope it helps\n\nJerome.\n\n\n\n\n\n--- Thomas Saxtoft &lt;ts@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hi\n&gt; \n&gt; I have some really heavy constructors in some\n&gt; classes. What is the best\n&gt; way to test constructors in generel?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thomas Saxtoft\n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nGreat stuff seeking new owners in Yahoo!
