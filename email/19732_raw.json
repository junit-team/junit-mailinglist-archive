I don&#39;t think you need to go over\n&gt; board here though, I don&#39;t need really fined grained flexibility here.\n&gt; If you want that you are better off looking at what Clover 2 or Agitar\n&gt; dashboard do by bringing other measures of risk into the picture.\n\nPaul, all,\n\nI&#39;ve been mulling over the right interface for this kind of\nfunctionality.  One thing that would really help is if people who\nwould really like to see categories in JUnit could chime in with their\n80/20 point.  I have a feeling that there&#39;s probably a really simple\ninterface that would do 80% of what people want, and a really\ncomplicated one that would do the other 20%.\n\nFor example, Paul, what&#39;s the difference between &quot;arbitrary groups&quot;\nand &quot;really fine-grained flexibility&quot; in your post above?
