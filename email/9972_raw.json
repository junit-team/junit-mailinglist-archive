You&#39;ll be able to extend the abstract class and provide all getters and setters and setup the data you need. There will be API for finders, ejbSelects, etc. So you would not even need the database to test it. The goal here is to focus on testing the business logic, not the container-generated SQL. \n\nI have not seen the official statistics but I suspect that the usage of CMP is on the rise. It is supported by all major vendors ( can&#39;t say the same about JDO ) and for many project/organizations that pay big bucks for their app server licenses it is all that matter. So in many cases it&#39;s not the choice of CMP vs. Hibernate vs. JDO but CMP vs. roll your own. Naturally, CMP wins in this case. \n\n\nAlexander\n\nhttp://www.mockejb.org\nEJBs made easy\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Stirling, Scott \n  To: junit@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Thursday, November 20, 2003 4:41 PM\n  Subject: RE: [junit] Testing EJBs\n\n\n  &gt; Alexander Ananiev wrote:\n  &gt; \n  &gt; There is no reason why CMP entity beans can&#39;t run outside of the \n  &gt; container. \n\n  In EJB 2.0, CMPs are abstract classes implemented by the app server.  How would you test these in any meaningful way?  Even the SQL is generated in most cases.  Who uses CMP anyway? :-)\n\n  Scott Stirling\n  Workscape, Inc.\n\n  ***********************************************************************\n  This message is intended only for the use of the intended recipient and\n  may contain information that is PRIVILEGED and/or CONFIDENTIAL.
