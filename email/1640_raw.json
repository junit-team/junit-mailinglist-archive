(I&#39;m sure someone has.)   What I\n&gt; what to do is generate a report that shows some stats on how many classes\n&gt; have test cases and how many methods in the class under test have\n&gt; corresponding test methods.  I have tried it a few different ways: \n&gt; \n&gt; 1. Just scanning through the source folder, picking up the java files and\n&gt; then checking if a ?Test.java file exists in a corresponding unit test\n&gt; folder.  \n&gt; \n&gt; This approach works well if I only cared about the file coverage, but I now\n&gt; want info on the method coverage.  Enter method 2.  \n&gt; \n&gt; 2. Use a tool that will parse through the java source and tell me all the\n&gt; methods. I used javadoc for this, but the problem with it is that I can only\n&gt; sort through one source structure at a time, and javadoc is not so nice to\n&gt; call programmatically (it shuts down your app after it runs once).  \n&gt; \n&gt; If anyone has suggestions on a better was to get info on the methods in a\n&gt; class, and other information like is the class an interface, I would love to\n&gt; hear it.  Or better yet, if anyone has seen or built a tool similar to what\n&gt; I&#39;m doing I would also love to hear about it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; \n&gt; John\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\nAlthough I haven&#39;t tried it myself, JesTer claims to find code that is \nnot covered by tests.\n\nJesTer is available at:\n\n   http://www.xpdeveloper.com/cgi-bin/wiki.cgi?JesTer\n\nMike\n\n-- \nMike Clark\nClarkware Consulting, Inc.\nCustom Software Architecture, Design,\nDevelopment, and Performance Consulting\nhttp://www.clarkware.com\n\n\n",
