One<br/>\nof the comp sci courses has a nice case study of JUnit and design<br/>\npatterns:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ocw.mit.edu/6/6.170/f01/pdf/lecture-17.pdf\">http://ocw.mit.edu/6/6.170/f01/pdf/lecture-17.pdf</a><br/>\n<br/>\nMy only comment on the internals of JUnit is that the<br/>\ndynamic classloader is beat.  It needs to be reworked<br/>\nto remove the excluded.properties hack and prevent<br/>\nLinkageErrors and other nastiness that catches users<br/>\nby surprise.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nScott Stirling<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Manuel Amago [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mamago@...\">mamago@...</a>] <br/>\n </span></blockquote>[snip] <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; And I suspect that in that remark lies the crux of it.  The <br/>\n&gt; common topics that appear when discussing the complexity of <br/>\n&gt; JUnit are Suites and Tests, where this is just a typical <br/>\n&gt; instantiation of the Composite pattern.  The TestResult is a <br/>\n&gt; collecting parameter, and so on.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am one of those people who puts JUnit forward as an example <br/>\n&gt; to be followed, and am, so far, unswayed from that position.  <br/>\n&gt; My views are based on the code for JUnit 3.7, but I can only <br/>\n&gt; imagine that it has gotten better, and not worse in the <br/>\n&gt; latest release.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; As is usually the case when using patterns in code, to the <br/>\n&gt; non-initiated any such code may look very complex indeed, and <br/>\n&gt; the relationships between the different classes unfathomable. <br/>\n&gt;  The benefits for those who do recognise the patterns, <br/>\n&gt; however, is great. </span></blockquote></div>",
