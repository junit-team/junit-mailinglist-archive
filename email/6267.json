It&#39;s an organizational exercise that lends <br/>\nitself to the way I run tests.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI know of many ways to search for and run all tests in the system.  When <br/>\nI&#39;ve needed to do that, and for some reason I don&#39;t have an AllTests <br/>\nsuite already built, I use the Ant batchtest.  I can&#39;t say I&#39;ve pulled <br/>\nthat lever as a safeguard against forgetting to add tests to a suite <br/>\nthough.  Alas, it&#39;s not because I have a good memory.  Rather, when <br/>\nbuilding things test-first I generally notice those errors of omission <br/>\nearly.      <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;If there were a nice graphical<br/>\n&gt;tool to make it easy, would that help? <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Perhaps.  Eclipse has a wizard for creating a test suite, allowing you <br/>\nto pick which test classes to include from a list of tests it <br/>\nautomagically finds.  I haven&#39;t used it much, but think I might try it <br/>\nfor a while.  I can always fall back to writing the suites by hand.    <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Is it worth your while to build it?<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I couldn&#39;t justify building it given my current needs.  That&#39;s not to <br/>\nsay if it were built I wouldn&#39;t use it, but it&#39;s not a tool I reach for.<br/>\n<br/>\nMIke<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nMike Clark<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clarkware.com\">http://clarkware.com</a> <br/>\n(720) 851-2014</div>",
