Server starts, then clients each start <br/>\nand interact with the server and make assertions on the response from <br/>\nserver.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI know about Ant with parallel task or batch job.  I know about <br/>\nActiveTestSuite and JUnitPref but they seems to run tests in different <br/>\nthreads but same JVM.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d like to do this from ONE TestCase since that seems like a nicer <br/>\nsolution than Ant parallel task.  e.g my TestClientServer  would spawn <br/>\na server in a different VM and also spawn as many clients as I want <br/>\neach in its own VM and then once all client(s) test methods are done, <br/>\nthe TestClientServer tears down.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIs there a way to do this.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nthanks</div>",
