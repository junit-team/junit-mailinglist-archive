It made a big difference for\n&gt; many users. With 4.9, I=\r\n want to try something new: after posting the\n&gt; jars on github, I&#39;ll also t=\r\nry to immediately upload them to maven\n&gt; central. I&#39;m asking for help autom=\r\nating that process from people who\n&gt; have more familiarity with the concept=\r\ns. You&#39;re right that the\n&gt; discussion doesn&#39;t necessarily make sense undern=\r\neath that issue any\n&gt; more.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; It may finally be time for me to ju=\r\nst take over running the script\n&gt; &gt;&gt; that makes the magic happen, since thi=\r\ns seems to be a major\n&gt; obstacle\n&gt; &gt;&gt; for many people trying to get new fea=\r\ntures and bug fixes from\n&gt; JUnit.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Can I ask again for help from the ma=\r\nven-initiated?  Best thing\n&gt; would\n&gt; &gt;&gt; be a pull request with a shell scri=\r\npt that I can run on release,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; without needing to understand too much a=\r\nbout what it does.  Thanks,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Reading the cover letter of\n&gt; https://g=\r\nithub.com/KentBeck/junit/pull/203\n&gt; &gt; makes it sound as if all necessary sc=\r\nripting work has already been\n&gt; done.\n&gt; &gt; (Someone would then take the outp=\r\nut of the script and upload it\n&gt; through\n&gt; &gt; the oss.sonatype.org web inter=\r\nface)\n&gt; \n&gt; Yep, I think we&#39;re almost there.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Max.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; \n\n\n\n",
