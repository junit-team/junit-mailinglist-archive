Indeed starting with\n&gt; java 5 features in unit tests would be a good way to practice them\n&gt; without risking all on the production code.\n&gt;\n&gt; - Neil\n&gt;\n\n\nI did this when developing some stuff for MHP which is only guaranteed to\nsupport some very old JDKs. I think it was 1.1 or 1.2. I set the ant script\nto build the production code with target=&quot;1.2&quot; or such. Wanted to try out\nJDK5 features and JUnit4. Worked fine for me, but I can see it might be\ndifficult in corporate environments. I was in a situation where I was able\nto try things out so its a bit different.\n\n-Teemu\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
