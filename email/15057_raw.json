AbstractCollection or\nAbstractList would be better. They would allow you to count the elements\nwithout iterating through them and (as you say) AbstractList would all you\nrandom access to parameters.\n\nI&#39;m not concerned with named sets of parameters yet. I&#39;d like to collect\nmore concrete experience with parameterized tests before making them more\ncomplicated. My attitude is that they are an experimental feature for the\nmoment.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nKent Beck\nThree Rivers Institute\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On \n&gt; Behalf Of Eugene Kuleshov\n&gt; Sent: Monday, October 03, 2005 9:15 PM\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: Re: [junit] Proposed parameterized test syntax for JUnit 4\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;It might be better for the @Parameters method to return an\n&gt; &gt;Iterator, allowing the lazy creation of substantial data structures,\n&gt; &gt;however.\n&gt; &gt;  @Parameters static Iterator&lt;Object[]&gt; data() ...\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;   Iterator won&#39;t allow to jump directly to the specific test. \n&gt; It would \n&gt; be useful for IDE runners if user would like to restart only specific \n&gt; test case (this scenario us currently not supported in \n&gt; Eclipse&#39;s JUnit \n&gt; runner).\n\nAgreed. AbstractCollection or AbstractList might be better.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;  Second limitation is that user don&#39;t have will have to \n&gt; &gt;&gt;declaratively \n&gt; &gt;&gt;specify test data sets without writing custom @Parameters \n&gt; &gt;&gt;method and use \n&gt; &gt;&gt;some system property to differentiate between tests. Perhaps \n&gt; &gt;&gt;you can add \n&gt; &gt;&gt;some &quot;name&quot; property to Parameters annotation, so test runner \n&gt; &gt;&gt;can match \n&gt; &gt;&gt;this name with declared test data. Such name property would \n&gt; &gt;&gt;also allow \n&gt; &gt;&gt;to have multiple @Parameters methods and match them with \n&gt; &gt;&gt;@Test methods \n&gt; &gt;&gt;if you&#39;ll have same name there too. The last would allow to \n&gt; &gt;&gt;have several \n&gt; &gt;&gt;test methods with different kinds of test parameters \n&gt; without creating \n&gt; &gt;&gt;separate test classes (so you&#39;ll have single test class for \n&gt; &gt;&gt;class under \n&gt; &gt;&gt;testing).\n&gt; &gt;&gt;    \n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;I don&#39;t understand this objection. Can you write an example \n&gt; of what you\n&gt; &gt;would like to see?\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;   Ok. I may have several data sets (e.g. small one for smoke \n&gt; testing and \n&gt; a really huge one for complete regression testing) and I want \n&gt; to choose \n&gt; between them from the runner. For instance:\n&gt; \n&gt; @Parameters(name=&quot;smoke&quot;) public static Object[] data() {\n&gt;   return new int[][] {{0, 0}, {1, 1}};\n&gt; }\n&gt; \n&gt; @Parameters(name=&quot;full&quot;) public static Object[] data() {\n&gt;   // load data from external file or generate permutations\n&gt;   return data;\n&gt; }\n&gt; \n&gt;   Then you&#39;ll specify test type &quot;smoke&quot; or &quot;full&quot; on a runner and it \n&gt; will choose an appropriate set of the test data.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;  The last thing I&#39;d like to mention is that current \n&gt; &gt;&gt;@Parameters methods \n&gt; &gt;&gt;won&#39;t scale to large data sets (the same limitation also exists in \n&gt; &gt;&gt;TestNG). I&#39;ve seen JUnit3 suite() methods that produced \n&gt; thousands of \n&gt; &gt;&gt;test permutations and that required lots of memory memory \n&gt; &gt;&gt;when running \n&gt; &gt;&gt;tests. So, It think that it would make sense to introduce an \n&gt; &gt;&gt;interface \n&gt; &gt;&gt;similar to JDBC ResultSet, so test runner can create iterate \n&gt; &gt;&gt;trough test \n&gt; &gt;&gt;data without loading it completely into memory and also have \n&gt; &gt;&gt;option to \n&gt; &gt;&gt;get number of tests as well as jump to Nth test. You can also \n&gt; &gt;&gt;provide an \n&gt; &gt;&gt;adapter that will take Object[][] and provide all that \n&gt; &gt;&gt;functionality for \n&gt; &gt;&gt;users who don&#39;t want to create test data dynamically.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;    \n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Would the Iterator version satisfy the need to handle large \n&gt; data sets?\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;   The limitation of the iterator is that it does not provide a random \n&gt; access. This would make difficult to rerun only selected test \n&gt; case (e.g. \n&gt; failed one)\n&gt; \n&gt;   regards,\n&gt;   Eugene\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
