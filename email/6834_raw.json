But even just doing the setup on that object is still more code\nthan simply not testing it.\n\nI don&#39;t feel I&#39;ll ever get any payback from that test; that is to say, I\ndon&#39;t think it would ever fail. Thus, I don&#39;t write the test. If I ever\nstart getting bitten by bugs in that sort of code, I&#39;ll realize that\nmy prediction in this type of case is sometimes wrong, and I&#39;ll start\nwriting those tests.\n\n(Only tests that ever fail at some point pay back their investment; the\ntests that never fail never catch any bugs, and are thus a waste of time\nand money. It&#39;s just our lack of perfect knowledge about what&#39;s going\nto fail in the future that forces us to waste time and money. XP&#39;s unit\ntesting strategy, as I see it, tries to maximize the overall return on\nthe test investment.)\n\n&gt; Another idea, borrowed from Kent Beck&#39;s latest book on TDD, is SelfShunt,\n&gt; where you have the TestCase itself be a kind of mock object, implementing\n&gt; the interface of whatever class your class under test expects to interact\n&gt; with.\n\nI&#39;ve done that. I&#39;ve also just created anonymous objects on the fly.\nBoth are good ideas, though orthogonal to the discussion above of\nwhether or not one should test something in the first place.\n\n&gt; &quot;I would predict that the strategy listed above, while good intentioned, on\n&gt; a project of any size would wind up with lots of extra code throughout added\n&gt; just for testability.\n\nIt&#39;s not lots of extra code. I added, in my example, two extra lines of\ncode: a method declaration and a method call. Another line was extracted\nfrom the other method, and so existed anyway. (I&#39;m not counting the lone\nclosing brace or the extra whitespace lines as lines of code.)\n\nI think that you would probably have added the same amount of code to\nthe test case just to set up the mock connection factory, not to mention\nintroducing another object into the system rather than just an extra\nmethod, making things more complex rather than less. IMHO, of course.\n\n&gt; Testability is an aspectual concern, not really a part of an object being\n&gt; modeled.\n\nI disagree. Maybe it comes from seeing engineers design buildings and\nsimilar structures: it turns out that you design them not only so that\nthey fulfill their intended function after you&#39;re done building them,\nbut also so that they have good &quot;buildability.&quot; They&#39;ll add in stuff\nthat has no relevance to the final function simply to make it faster,\ncheaper or easier to build. This was a pretty stunning concept to me\nwhen I first found out about it, because it was something I&#39;d never\nconsidered before.\n\nSo now, always, testability is high on my list of things I consider when\nI design any system. I usually am expected to provide some way of showing,\non a continuous basis, that the system will do what&#39;s expected of it, so\nit&#39;s really almost a final function of the system in the same way that\nthe behaviour the client is looking for is a final function of it.\n\ncjs\n-- \nCurt Sampson  &lt;cjs@...&gt;   +81 90 7737 2974   http://www.netbsd.org\n    Don&#39;t you know, in this new Dark Age, we&#39;re all light.  --XTC\n\n",
