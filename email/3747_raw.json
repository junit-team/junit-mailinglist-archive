Basically its my job to navigate many of the potential \n&gt;problems.  Anyhow the problem I had when beginning with junit was I found \n&gt;that a lot of the documentaion had holes in it.  So I&#39;ve attached here a \n&gt;document which describes how to write your first junit test (it assumes \n&gt;junit is already installed).  Maybe you will find it useful, and any \n&gt;feedback would be appreciated, Nic.\n\n\nPoints:\n* What coding conventions do you use at your company? The class name \n&quot;adder&quot; doesn&#39;t fit with any I know of. (Likewise adderTest)\n* I&#39;d add a constructor to adder, if only for clarity and to avoid confusion.\n* Add setUp, tearDown to the example test - I know you&#39;re striving for \nclarity here, but I don&#39;t think they&#39;re so complicated as to confuse \nthings, and they are essential.\n* I assume you&#39;ll later explain suites etc. Good idea for leaving them out.\n\n\nNice simple test, though. An explicit example with a bug in it might be a \ngood idea.\n\nJim\n\n\n\n--\n\n                           *   Jim Cheesman   *\n             Trabajo: \njchees@... - (34)(91) 724 9200 x 2360\n               If a pig loses its \nvoice is it disgruntled?\n\n\n\n",
