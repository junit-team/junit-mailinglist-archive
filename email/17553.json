That&#39;s the thing with which I don&#39;t quite agree. Let me check the <br/>\nthread to be sure...<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;pause /&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt turns out I was wrong, so let me double back.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wonder about the notion of TDD being a minimum professional standard, <br/>\nonly because it&#39;s about process, and not results. I would agree with low <br/>\ndefect-rate, well-designed, easily-maintained code being a minimum <br/>\nprofessional standard, and TDD being an excellent way to achieve that. <br/>\nIt is my preferred way to achieve that. I am not prepared, however, to <br/>\nrequire it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope that clarifies the matter.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
