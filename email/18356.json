I had attended a<br/>\n&gt; presentation by Robert &quot;Uncle Bob&quot; Martin on Test Driven<br/>\n&gt; development. I think the exact example was a program to keep track<br/>\n&gt; of a bowling game score. Presenting the Big view object model and<br/>\n&gt; one done through incremental, test driven development, the later was<br/>\n&gt; much simpler. It only required the creation of objects needed to<br/>\n&gt; solve the problem rather then the apparent objects and their<br/>\n&gt; behaviour.<br/>\n <br/>\n </span></blockquote> I have no doubt that TDD works great on such simple problems and that it <br/>\ncan<br/>\n even lead to a reasonable design. Then again, the problem space is so <br/>\nsmall<br/>\n that you can argue that no design will really be wrong anyway...<br/>\n <br/>\n Now consider a more realistic example, such as an application that is<br/>\n dealing with five database tables, each with four to ten columns, each of<br/>\n which needs to be mapped to Java objects in a sensible way (i.e. not<br/>\n necessarily mapping the tables and the objects one-to-one) and should <br/>\nalso<br/>\n include business methods and objects to make it easier to perform<br/>\n domain-specific operations.<br/>\n <br/>\n Using TDD to drive such a design is guaranteed to lead to an architecture<br/>\n that will be focused on solving micro-problems and that will totally miss<br/>\n the big picture. You are much better off spending a few minutes with a<br/>\n piece of paper or a white board to design your classes and your object<br/>\n diagram.<br/>\n <br/>\n If you want to use TDD to implement this model after that, fine, but I<br/>\n really dispute the idea that TDD should drive the design in the general<br/>\n case, because TDD simply never gives you the big picture.<br/>\n <br/>\n Makes sense?<br/>\n <br/>\n -- <br/>\n Cédric<br/>\n http://testng. &lt;http://testng.org&gt; org<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have been successfully using TDD on a large project for the last 23 <br/>\nweeks - Large as in 10s of Database Schemas  each containing (5-15 tables, <br/>\n10s of Stored Procs, Grants, Synonyms, etc), 100s of classes, 1000s of <br/>\nFitnesse tests. etc... <br/>\n<br/>\nIts doable - like anything, it takes a deciplined, dedicated and <br/>\nthoughtful team.<br/>\n<br/>\nIts not the technique, its the team at the end of the day.<br/>\n<br/>\nAndrew<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
