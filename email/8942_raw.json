Just &#39;cos it isn&#39;t proven,\ndoesn&#39;t make it not right. Why not accept good fortune occasionally?\n\n\t&gt; I write code, I test my code, I debug my code when tests fail\n\t&gt; by trying to analyse the output. I was hoping for it to be\n\t&gt; easier to analyse, w/o a lot of manual effort, but I don&#39;t\n\t&gt; have an itch big enough to attempt to write such a tool --\n\t&gt; especially when it&#39;d be cheap/clean to do it in the\n\t&gt; framework.\n\n&gt;\tSo you are actually concerned about who will be writing the code to make\n&gt;\tit work?\n\nI have open source projects I help out with, I think the bigger test is the\ncommunity of folk you work with. If I am this out of synch with you all it\nisn&#39;t a good start. There are many reason why software projects fail, and I\ndon&#39;t need to start one that appears so unwelcomed by the development team\nfor the product (that I like/use so much) that I was hoping to assist  w/\n&quot;my little epiphany&quot;.\n\n\t&gt; Also, much as I could craft some sort of add on\n\t&gt; (perhaps leverage my own sub-class from TestCase) I think it\n\t&gt; needs too much of what is in the framework in order to work\n\t&gt; well, and I don&#39;t fancy re-writing the thing.\n\n&gt;\tI don&#39;t think you&#39;d need to rewrite anything.\n\nBut I do, and if I am writing it that matters more. Few people here have\neven accepted the need for the concept, and other than &quot;go write you own\ncollectors&quot; not offered help, so why would I waste time on the\nimplementation?\n\n\t&gt; I use eclipse, I use ant -- I like the integration into those\n\t&gt; tools more than I like my idea. If I can&#39;t get you to\n\t&gt; contemplate the concept, then I probably have little chance\n\t&gt; of persuading them. If they don&#39;t use it, I won&#39;t benefit. Another\n\t&gt; reason not to start.\n\n\tYou wouldn&#39;t need to persuade anyone. Both Eclipse and Ant are open\n\tsource and have a quite mature plugin concept.\n\nYes, I know, I&#39;ve written for both. I&#39;m hardly going to try to replicate all\nthe work for both plugins just to try to get this point over.\n\n\t&gt; This was my first topic on this mailing list, and much as you\n\t&gt; were pretty measured/polite (at least at the start) I don&#39;t\n\t&gt; think I&#39;ll be back for more. Open Source is (IMHO) about open\n\t&gt; minded discussion of ideas, and I don&#39;t think I found that\n\t&gt; here. No worries, have fun w/ what you do.\n\n&gt;\tIt is also about contribution. I think we would all be pleased to see\n&gt;\tyou write your tool and happy to help you where we can. If it proves to\n&gt;\tbe valuable to many people, the best way to distribute it could be\n&gt;\treconsidered.\n\nSorry, I&#39;ve heard that too many times before. Sure, it is a filter of who\nwants to put skin in the game, but it can also be used as an easy barrier.\nYes, I know it is &quot;part of OSS the process -- the trial by code production&quot;,\nbut it doesn&#39;t make it always right & I am not sure it is right here.\n\nIf the community of developers/users on a project isn&#39;t open to accepting a\ncore change [and I feel that is the default reaction here -- right or wrong]\nthen it doesn&#39;t making it a welcoming environment to want to invest to much\neffort. As such, what could be done as an internal change gets relegated to\na large external development. Sorry, as I&#39;ve stated before -- I wanted to\nclean up some ugly reporting mess, not re-write a testing tool.\n\n&gt;\tNo hard feelings,\n\nGlad you feel that way.\n\nregards\n\nAdam\n\n\n\n",
