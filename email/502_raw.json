Properties are associated with tests \n&gt;using the same &quot;pluggable&quot; pattern currently used to create TestCases. \n&gt; That is, the run method is found dynamically based on the name of the \n&gt;TestCase and so are the properties meant to be used as a filter. \n&gt;Properties can be associated with all the tests in the TestCase and/or \n&gt;the individual test methods.  These are combined and then checked \n&gt;against the filter. \n\nSounds like a very interesting idea. Is it possible to use something other \nthan a property string? The same type of functionality could be achieved \nusing interfaces, though not at a method level. Typos make Strings a \nliability.
