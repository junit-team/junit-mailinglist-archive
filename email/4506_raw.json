Some shells don&#39;t handle\n&gt;&gt; negative return codes correctly, turning them into 0 (meaning normal\n&gt;&gt; termination, which seems like the wrong way to truncate, but what do\n&gt;&gt; I know). Would anyone object to this change? Who out there uses the\n&gt;&gt; exit codes?\n&gt;\n&gt; We use the exit code in our project during an automated daily\n&gt; build/verification process. We assume 0 means success, non-0 otherwise.\n&gt; Personally I wish the errors and failures were rolled into just\n&gt; 1 category (a bug is a bug).\n&gt;\n&gt; If you are curious, the log gets emailed out to the team with a subject\n&gt; that mentions (sucess) or (errors) depending on if everything was ok.\n&gt; Basically ksh/cron type stuff, which uses the exit codes to detect\n&gt; errors. Since it gets emailed out every night, it detects lapses in\n&gt; judgement at most 24 hours after they happen and alerts everybody.\n&gt; Mostly the integration type tests fail though (which are not implemented\n&gt; with junit) because of database issues, or the build fails because\n&gt; permissions in CVS are wrong... stuff like that. So then you can look\n&gt; at the attachements (log files, junit textui output) to figure out what\n&gt; went wrong when the subject says &quot;... (errors) ...&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; We use ksh, perl, tcsh and bash across several unix flavors (sgi and\n&gt; solaris, mainly) and cygwin under windows.\n&gt;\n&gt; I hope that helps you. Let me know if you require further details.\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt; Chester Kustarz 2\n&gt; http://www.monkey.org/~chester\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
