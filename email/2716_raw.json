I then pass the Properties object\n&gt; to the methods that need them.  This really helped as I could\n&gt; then create the Properties object as I needed in the tests\n&gt; (with missing properties) and see how my program responded.\n&gt; \n&gt; Not to mention, it also helped when I changed the load property\n&gt; method to use the classpath rather than the file system for\n&gt; loading.  Only had to change code in one place.\n&gt; \n\nYes, I just changed my program yesterday to obtain the property file and\ncreate a Properties object and then load. Once that was done, I then\npassed\nthe Properties object to each of the routines I had that parsed the\nproperties. For testing, I just created a Properties object and then\nused\nthe setProperty() call, as Valdimir suggested.\n\nIt works very well. The only thing I saw different was that in a\nproperty\nfile, I could have a line like &quot;NAME = &#92;tVALUE&quot; and it would process\nthat\ncorrectly (without the tab), whereas I get a different result, if I do a \nsetProperty(&quot;NAME&quot;, &quot;&#92;tVALUE&quot;); so I can&#39;t really test those types of\nsyntactical things. Not a big deal though, as I could have one real\nproperty\nfile and use that to test those cases, if need be.\n\nI was just surprised that Java didn&#39;t have a way to do the equivalent of\nStringBufferInputStream for the Properties.load() call (like accepting a\nStrngReader). I found it very handy to be able to feed the load either a\nFileInputStream or a StringbufferInputStream, as needed.\n\n\nPCM (Paul Michali)\n\nCarrier Voice Gateway Business Unit (CVGBU)\nCisco Systems, Inc.\n250 Apollo Drive\nChelmsford, MA 01824\n\nPhone : (800) 572-6771 x 45817  (978) 244-5817 [direct]\nPaging: (800) 365-4578 [voice]  pcm@...
