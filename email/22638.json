MethodRule allows you to do things<br/>\n&gt; based on the specific test name, and intercept and even replace the<br/>\n&gt; running of a test. Consider ExpectedException. You really could not<br/>\n&gt; do anything like that in a @Before or @After method. You would have<br/>\n&gt; to do it inside your test and use an execute around pattern to handle<br/>\n&gt; the exception.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Your point concerning ExpectedException is valid, but arguing that<br/>\nmethod rules are even more useful than class rules does not say anything<br/>\nabout class rules being unuseful.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; For your use case it is a drop more boilerplate than a rule, but all<br/>\n&gt; you would do is define a @Before method in a common superclass or in<br/>\n&gt; your @Before call a class that encapsulates the functionality. Yes<br/>\n&gt; you have to wrap the call in a method rather than defining a field,<br/>\n&gt; but Java is kind of verbose already.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>&quot;Java is verbose already&quot; is not a good reason to make things even more<br/>\nunnecessarily verbose.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou say I should write:<br/>\n<br/>\n    public static MyThing myThing =<br/>\n        new MyThing(MyEnclosingTestClass.class);<br/>\n<br/>\n    @BeforeClass public static void beforeClass() {<br/>\n        myThing.begin();<br/>\n    }<br/>\n<br/>\n    @AfterClass public static void afterClass() {<br/>\n        myThing.end();<br/>\n    }<br/>\n<br/>\nI want to write:<br/>\n<br/>\n    @Rule public static MyThing myThing = new MyThing();<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, I think the second is self-evidently greatly advantageous.<br/>\n<br/>\n * Much less boilerplate in each test using the common code.<br/>\n * Don&#39;t need to repeat yourself nearly as much.<br/>\n * No risk of forgetting the teardown.<br/>\n<br/>\nMax.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
