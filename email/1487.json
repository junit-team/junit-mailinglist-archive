Dave is right, JFCUnit is not <br/>\n100% the same as having a person use the keyboard and mouse.  <br/>\nInstead, JFCUnit tries to get reasonably close and make the test code <br/>\neasy to develop and maintain.  Hopefully this will make it easier for <br/>\nteams to write GUI tests and therefore test more than they could in <br/>\nthe past.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe JFCUnit could have an option to use Robot for creating the <br/>\nevents.  Why don&#39;t you add it as a feature request?<br/>\n<br/>\n- Greg<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In junit@y..., Robert Sartin &lt;sartin@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --- David Herron &lt;davidh@7...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I just downloaded and looked at their code.
