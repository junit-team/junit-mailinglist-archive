The test thread then waits<br/>\nfor the receiving thread to notify it when the packets are received.<br/>\nThe test thread then gets the packets from the receiving thread.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I want to only start the receiving thread once per testcase and not<br/>\nonce per test. Otherwise  I have multiple receiving threads trying to<br/>\nbind to the same socket. I also have difficulty stopping the receiving<br/>\nthread in tearDown because it is i/o blocked and even if I interrupt<br/>\nit, it does not terminate before the next test starts.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance<br/>\nMike</div>",
