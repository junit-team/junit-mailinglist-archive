Is the expectation that the error message should give all <br/>\n&gt;the information necessary to identify the bug?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Or is it expected that the developer have knowledege of (or discover) <br/>\n&gt;what the test is doing? or run the test in debug mode? or other?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>In my experience, it depends. Some defects are easy to diagnose. Some are instances of user error.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have Programmer Test coverage and QA still finds defects, then the programmers aren&#39;t using QA&#39;s tests, and they probably should. QA is automating the tests, right? (I hope so.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf QA raises a defect, I ask the finder to work with me to reproduce it. I then isolate the cause, write the appropriate missing Programmer Tests, fix the problem and off we go.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;We are testing methods that take xml Strings as parameters and return <br/>\n&gt;xml. It would be nice to see what was passed in and what was returned <br/>\n&gt;if anything .. even when something like a NullPointerException is <br/>\n&gt;failing the test. Also we are running the tests in different <br/>\n&gt;environments so a developer may not see the same error if they run <br/>\n&gt;the test in the development environment.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is not really a testing consideration. It&#39;s a logging consideration, and logging is important in enterprise-scale applications where it is usually impossible to run your tests at the client site. I would log information at the key handoff points between components. Within a component, there should be tests. Presumably you only need to know that XML strings are coming into a component because you fear that they are not what the target component expects. Consider using XML schema here to avoid the prob lem.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Is a separate logging mechanism the answer?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It is, by the sound of it.</div>",
