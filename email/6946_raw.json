The test object\ncreated during setup turned out to be reused for\nsubsequent tests in the test case, which caused problems\narising from old state, until I figured it out.\n\nNow, for performance, it only makes sense that a fixture\nwould be reused for each test in a test case class. So I&#39;m\nnot suggesting that the implementation is wrong.\n\nBut I read the docs at the main site, and I&#39;ve been following\nthese threads for quite a while, and still I had a dead-wrong\nimpression of what&#39;s going on.\n\nFor example, in the FAQ, q2 &quot;How do I use a text fixture?&quot;\nsays:\n   &quot;Each test runs in its own test fixture to isolate tests from the\n   changes made by other tests. Because the tests are isolated,\n   they can be run in any order.... The JUnit framework\n   automatically invokes the setUp() method before each test is\n   run and the tearDown() method after each test is run.&quot;\n\nNow for &quot;test&quot;, I was reading &quot;test *method*&quot;. As in testX(),\ntestY(). But my recent epiphany suggests that I should have\nbeen reading it as &quot;test *case*&quot;, as in &quot;test-case class&quot;. And\nsince the example shows a single test case class, with multiple\ntest methods in it, it was easy to make that assumption.\n\nNote:\nIn general, I&#39;m not much fond of the name, &quot;TestCase&quot;, because\nto me that represents a single test. Since a TestCase class can\nactually have multiple test methods, the name &quot;TestFixture&quot; is\nprobably more appropriate. But be that as it may...\n\nIt appears to me that the word &quot;test&quot; is badly overloaded in the\ndocs, meaning at various times, test method, test case, and\npotentially even test suite.\n\nThe best way to eliminate confusion that I can see is to do a\nglobal search on &quot;test &quot;, and replace with one of the hyphenated\nwords &quot;test-method&quot;, &quot;test-case&quot;, or &quot;test-suite&quot;, as appropriate.\n\n\n\n",
