Technical=\r\nly I\nhaven&#39;t done anything that can&#39;t already be done with ScalaTest and my=\r\n hopes\nare that rather than spawning off a new framework, the good ideas ar=\r\ne\nadopted in other frameworks and the bad ones die with this one. Right now=\r\n\nI&#39;m primarily interested in running tests and poking around in the results=\r\n\nrather than easing the testwriting itself. I&#39;m also curious where I can go=\r\n\nwith JUnit as a primary foundation, basically conforming to rather than ju=\r\nst\ninterfacing with JUnit. Mostly for fun. I decided to make it all public =\r\nin\ncase it would be interesting to anyone else and for reference when blogg=\r\ning\netc.\nHow I &quot;solved&quot; pending and pendingUntilFixed was to use an Assumpt=\r\nionFailed\nexception since it is the closest thing to an ignored exception i=\r\nn JUnit.\nSince the existing runners don&#39;t treat the assumption-errors as ig=\r\nnored I\nsimply output &quot;pending &lt;reason&gt;&quot; messages on the console when being=\r\n run. It\nwould be better to have the tests marked as ignored in eclipse but=\r\n works as\na workaround.\nQuite early I got an idea about some primary goals =\r\nwhen running from the\nREPL and the most important one was:\n\nminimize typing=\r\n - completion is not always available in the REPL (from\neclipse, intellij a=\r\nnd to my surprise even emacs (though there must be some\nway to pass the tab=\r\n along down to the repl?))\n\nExamples of where this has led me:\n * Only one =\r\nimport\n * short package name even if it violates javas recommendations\n * p=\r\nackage object with shortcuts to common stuff and a few implicits\n\nI really =\r\nwanted scala tests easy executing of tests from the REPL. The\nJUnitCore app=\r\nroach is less elegant IMO and it seems like a System.exit in\nthe the cores =\r\nmain shuts down the REPL. That could be worked around of\ncourse by instatia=\r\ntion JUnitCore and passing the classes to run. A problem\nhere from a scala =\r\nperspective is that Java&#39;s way to get a Class instance\n&lt;ClassName&gt;.class ro=\r\nlls off my fingers a bit more naturally than scalas\nclassOf[ClassName] (hab=\r\nit I guess). Long story short, I much prefer\nscalatests way and I think it&#39;=\r\ns not strange that a language with a REPL\ninspires more thought in this dep=\r\nartment. My solution here was dynamic\nmixins (or static if one prefers). So=\r\n with a simple &quot;with Basics&quot; you can\nrun any JUnit compatible test from the=\r\n REPL.\n\nNow came the issue with customizing the output. I decided to put th=\r\nat\noutside the TestCase completely. It feels like a runtime decision. This =\r\nis\nwhen &quot;run&quot; changed to really mean &quot;select&quot; (but the method on interactio=\r\nn is\nstill called run). Basically, the run method just returns a list of\nCa=\r\nllable[Result]-instances and the BriefReport calls the one by one and\nprint=\r\ns out the result. This way, the running and the reporting is nicely\nseparat=\r\ned and which testing style you choose has no bearing on the output\nyou see.=\r\n The brief method could be paired with a verbose method if one\nwishes more =\r\nverbose output.\n\nNow came the color/no color issue. Color feels like an asp=\r\nect of reporting.\nThis might be a case of golden hammer but to represent th=\r\nis aspect as a\nstackable trait felt quite nice. Especially when creating in=\r\nstances of a\nreport: new Brief with Color. One could easily imagine expandi=\r\nng in this\ndirection: new Brief with Color with Summary with SourceDump wit=\r\nh\nStackTraceFiltering with LongRunningTestTopList ExecutionTimeStatistics .=\r\n..\n\nThe only problem (ok there are several probably by the obvious problem\n=\r\nanyway) is keeping the default as elegant as ScalaTest&#39;s spec.execute hence=\r\n\nthe package object in the poju4s package that allows me to write brief(spe=\r\nc)\ninstead.\n\nIf I want to run just a few tests that can be done like this (=\r\nhere I assume\nI have already renamed the run-method to select):\nbrief(spec.=\r\nselect(&#39;example1, &#39;example2))\n\nThe fun part comes when I add glob:\n\nbiref(g=\r\nlob(&quot;package/*/*Spec&quot;)) or with an implicit:\nbrief(&quot;package/*/*Spec&quot;).\n\nI a=\r\ngree that named parameters also makes sense, or a combination:\nspec.execute=\r\n(color=3DFunkyScheme, options=3DList[StackTraceFiltering,\nSourceDump, Execu=\r\ntionTimeStatistics])\n\nI also tought about some sort of parameter dsl:\n\nspec=\r\n.select(&#39;example1, &#39;example2) &gt;&gt;: StackTraceFiltering &gt;&gt;: Color &gt;&gt;:\nSourceD=\r\nump &gt;&gt;: StdOut\n(not sure that would work or that I would like it but... as =\r\nlong as we&#39;re\ntossing up ideas)\n\nAs you say, when something fails what one =\r\nreally wants to see is which tests\nfailed. That is a missing part from my o=\r\nutput, just effectively managed to\nclear those pesky succeeding tests out o=\r\nf the way while still mantaining\nsome feedback that they were actually run.=\r\n I intend to address that as you\nsuggested, list the failing pending and ig=\r\nnored tests in the summary. I also\nintend to let the run return some sort o=\r\nf Gist or Summary object that allows\none to poke around a bit more in the r=\r\nesult (after all it is a REPL so why\nshouldn&#39;t one be able to interact with=\r\n the result?). Examples of what one\ncould do &quot;post&quot;-running is to dump capt=\r\nured std-out, stacktraces,\nexecutiontimes etc, list all the names of all te=\r\nsts of a given status or\nwhat have you. I think the best is to leave the in=\r\nformation sort of naked\nand then scalas excellent collection API can do it&#39;=\r\ns magic of filtering,\ngrouping and mapping to the users desire. Why not con=\r\nveniently allow rerun\njust failed tests in this way?\n\nThere is really no re=\r\nason why these things need to be isolated to just\nJUnit, in fact it feels l=\r\nike my original idea is much less interesting then\nto actually explore runn=\r\ning and reporting from the REPL in general. For now\nit is convenient to foc=\r\nus on just one framework but perhaps in the future\nthe good parts can be di=\r\nstilled into a more framework agnostic run/report\nframework or the most sen=\r\nsible thing is to just leave the ideas out there\nwith a liberal license so =\r\nthat the ones that work can be adopted by\nframework-vendors as they please.=\r\n.. I&#39;m not sure what is best yet but the\nlicense is chosen to not be an iss=\r\nue for this to happen :).\n\nLong story short: one import seems to be a good =\r\nidea, separating running and\nreporting seems to be a good idea, and there s=\r\neems to be some room for\ninnovating when running tests from the REPL...\n\nTh=\r\nanks for listening to my ramblings! It&#39;s so much fun to play with these\nthi=\r\nngs without the worries of actually maintaining it for years and years :)\n\n=\r\n\n-----------------------------------------------------\nJoakim Ohlrogge\nAgic=\r\nal AB\nV=E4sterl=E5nggatan 79, 2 tr\n111 29 Stockholm, SWEDEN\n\nMobile: +46-70=\r\n8-754004\nBlog: johlrogge.wordpress.com\nE-mail: joakim.ohlrogge@...\n\n\n=\r\nOn Sat, Mar 12, 2011 at 1:25 AM, Bill Venners &lt;bill@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; H=\r\ni Joakim,\n&gt;\n&gt; On Fri, Mar 11, 2011 at 3:18 PM, Joakim Ohlrogge &lt;\n&gt; joakim.o=\r\nhlrogge@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; If anything useful comes out of it it =\r\ncan be contributed for sure.\n&gt;&gt; I&#39;ve chosen a quite liberal license (Beerwa=\r\nre :)) in case someone else\n&gt;&gt; feels inspired to borrow/steal or contribute=\r\n.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I&#39;m a bit inspired. I&#39;m sure you&#39;re aware that there&#39;s a lot of stu=\r\nff in\n&gt; ScalaTest to make writing JUnit tests in Scala more productive. And=\r\n perhaps\n&gt; you&#39;re aware you can run ScalaTest tests in the Scala interprete=\r\nr by\n&gt; invoking execute on them. So for example given this test:\n&gt;\n&gt; import=\r\n org.scalatest.junit.JUnitSuite\n&gt; import scala.collection.mutable.ListBuffe=\r\nr\n&gt; import _root_.org.junit.Test\n&gt; import _root_.org.junit.Before\n&gt;\n&gt; class=\r\n HowSuite extends JUnitSuite {\n&gt;\n&gt;   var sb: StringBuilder =3D _\n&gt;   var lb=\r\n: ListBuffer[String] =3D _\n&gt;\n&gt;   @Before def initialize() {\n&gt;     sb =3D ne=\r\nw StringBuilder(&quot;ScalaTest is &quot;)\n&gt;     lb =3D new ListBuffer[String]\n&gt;   }\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;   @Test def verifyEasy() {\n&gt;     sb.append(&quot;easy!&quot;)\n&gt;     assert(sb.toS=\r\ntring =3D=3D=3D &quot;ScalaTest is easy!&quot;)\n&gt;     assert(lb.isEmpty)\n&gt;     lb +=\r\n=3D &quot;sweet&quot;\n&gt;   }\n&gt;\n&gt;   @Test def verifyFun() {\n&gt;     sb.append(&quot;fun!&quot;)\n&gt;  =\r\n   assert(sb.toString =3D=3D=3D &quot;ScalaTest is fun!&quot;)\n&gt;     assert(lb.isEmpt=\r\ny)\n&gt;   }\n&gt; }\n&gt;\n&gt; You could run it in the interpreter like this (both ScalaT=\r\nest and JUnit\n&gt; need to be on the classpath):\n&gt;\n&gt; user-64-9-237-191:scalate=\r\nst-1.3 bv$ scala -cp\n&gt; scalatest-1.3.jar:junit-4.4.jar\n&gt; Welcome to Scala v=\r\nersion 2.8.0.final (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM,\n&gt; Java 1.6.0_22).\n&gt; =\r\nType in expressions to have them evaluated.\n&gt; Type :help for more informati=\r\non.\n&gt;\n&gt; scala&gt; :load HowSuite.scala\n&gt; Loading HowSuite.scala...\n&gt; import or=\r\ng.scalatest.junit.JUnitSuite\n&gt; import scala.collection.mutable.ListBuffer\n&gt;=\r\n import _root_.org.junit.Test\n&gt; import _root_.org.junit.Before\n&gt; defined cl=\r\nass HowSuite\n&gt;\n&gt; scala&gt; (new HowSuite).execute()\n&gt; Test Starting - line5$ob=\r\nject$$iw$$iw$HowSuite: verifyEasy\n&gt; Test Succeeded - line5$object$$iw$$iw$H=\r\nowSuite: verifyEasy\n&gt; Test Starting - line5$object$$iw$$iw$HowSuite: verify=\r\nFun\n&gt; Test Succeeded - line5$object$$iw$$iw$HowSuite: verifyFun\n&gt;\n&gt; Just cr=\r\neate a new instance and call execute on it and it will run. (This is\n&gt; a JU=\r\nnit 4 test class, so JUnit can run it jut fine. In this case you&#39;re\n&gt; askin=\r\ng ScalaTest to run it, though what ScalaTest does is turn around and\n&gt; ask =\r\nJUnit to run it, capturing and displaying the results.) If you want to\n&gt; ru=\r\nn just one of those tests you can specify it by name:\n&gt;\n&gt; scala&gt; (new HowSu=\r\nite).execute(&quot;verifyFun&quot;)\n&gt; Test Starting - line5$object$$iw$$iw$HowSuite: =\r\nverifyFun\n&gt; Test Succeeded - line5$object$$iw$$iw$HowSuite: verifyFun\n&gt;\n&gt; A=\r\nnd you can pass in config map of configuration information to execute if\n&gt; =\r\nyou want.\n&gt;\n&gt; It works, but it is ugly. The output has two problems. One is=\r\n that because\n&gt; I loaded the class with :load into the interpreter, instead=\r\n of compiling it,\n&gt; I get very long names for the class name with lots of d=\r\nollar signs. So one\n&gt; enhancement would be to drop everything to the left o=\r\nf the first dollar\n&gt; sign. I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;m doing that somewhere else in=\r\n ScalaTest, so I could\n&gt; do it here.\n&gt;\n&gt; The other annoyance is you get inf=\r\no on both TestStarting and TestSucceeded,\n&gt; two lines of info for each test=\r\n. What I originally did was only format the\n&gt; output of BDD style test trai=\r\nts, because BDD was in part about output that\n&gt; looks like a spec, and TDD =\r\nwas not. But I&#39;ve gotten clear feedback that\n&gt; people using the non-BDD tra=\r\nits would like pretty output too, so I&#39;ve\n&gt; already decided to change that.=\r\n So it should soon look something like:\n&gt;\n&gt; scala&gt; (new HowSuite).execute()=\r\n\n&gt; HowSuite\n&gt; - verifyEasy\n&gt; - verifyFun\n&gt;\n&gt; Another thing I did originally=\r\n was not show color when you use execute(),\n&gt; because I wasn&#39;t sure how to =\r\nlet people turn color off, and I felt it was\n&gt; worse to force color on peop=\r\nle whose terminals didn&#39;t support it than the\n&gt; other way around. But peopl=\r\ne really like color. It is pretty and makes it\n&gt; more readable. So what I&#39;d=\r\n like to do is figure out some way to let people\n&gt; configure color, full st=\r\nack traces, and durations when using execute. Now\n&gt; that Scala has default =\r\nparams, that&#39;s probably the right way to do it. So\n&gt; color would be the def=\r\nault, and to turn it off you&#39;d say:\n&gt;\n&gt; scala&gt; (new HowSuite).execute(color=\r\n =3D false)\n&gt;\n&gt; And lastly, your dots idea is interesting. Whenever I run w=\r\nith a standard\n&gt; out reporter, I get lots and lots and lots of green test n=\r\names that passed.\n&gt; And what I really care about is the ones that failed. S=\r\no I think it may make\n&gt; sense to add one more option to the standard out/er=\r\nr and file reporters that\n&gt; just shows one dot for each passed test. And th=\r\nen that could possibly be the\n&gt; default for execute, maybe.\n&gt;\n&gt; And lastly =\r\nlastly, maybe execute should show a summary line at the end,\n&gt; like the run=\r\nner does.\n&gt;\n&gt; As far as getting JUnit to do something like pending and pend=\r\ningUntilFixed,\n&gt; that will be tough until JUnit can treat some kind of exce=\r\nption specially.\n&gt; Be nice to have a TestIgnoredException that gets reporte=\r\nd as an ignored test\n&gt; in JUnit someday.\n&gt;\n&gt; Bill\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;  Lets see where it g=\r\noes. Right now it&#39;s mostly for fun.\n&gt;&gt; /J\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; ---------------------------=\r\n--------------------------\n&gt;&gt; Joakim Ohlrogge\n&gt;&gt; Agical AB\n&gt;&gt; V=E4sterl=E5n=\r\nggatan 79, 2 tr\n&gt;&gt; 111 29 Stockholm, SWEDEN\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Mobile: +46-708-754004\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; Blog: johlrogge.wordpress.com\n&gt;&gt; E-mail: joakim.ohlrogge@...\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; On Fri, Mar 11, 2011 at 8:13 PM, David Saff &lt;david@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\nJoakim,\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Not silly at all.

I feel that the scala tools are la=\r\ncking in...\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; inderstanding of the TDD/BDD approach (which is just a=\r\n feeling).\n&gt;&gt; Long\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; story short, I want to do something like scalaT=\r\nests\n&gt;&gt; pendingUntliFixed\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; which basically makrs a failing test as =\r\nignored until it stops\n&gt;&gt; failing\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; where pendingUntilFixed will sta=\r\nrt failing the test saying that\n&gt;&gt; &quot;test\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; was marked as pending but=\r\n did not throw an exception&quot;  (so that you\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; will not accidentally l=\r\neave pendingUntilFixed in for code tests that\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; work.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; I realized that this is very easy to do in JUnit from scala.\n&gt;&gt; Somethi=\r\nng\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; like this:\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;  def pendingUntilFixed(body: =3D&gt; =\r\nUnit) =3D {\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;    (try {\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;      body\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;      false\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt;    }\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;    catch {\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;      case e:Throwable =3D&gt; true\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt;    }) match {\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;      case false =3D&gt; error(&quot;Test was marked as p=\r\nending but did not\n&gt;&gt; fail&quot;)\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;      case true =3D&gt; ()\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;    }\n=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;  }\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;  @Test\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;  def someFailingTest =3D pend=\r\ningUntilFixed {\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;    assertThat(true, is(false))\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;  }\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;  @Test\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;  def someFixedTest =3D pendingUntilFixed {\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt;    assertThat(true, is(true))\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;  }\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Th=\r\ne problem is that pending tests are marked as succeding when they\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\nfail. It would be cool if I could somehow mark them as Ignored\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; ins=\r\ntead. Is there some exception I could throe that would accomplish\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\nthis? I sort of thought that AssmptionError would be logical to be\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n displayed as ignored instead of succeeding hence the title.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; Ideas?\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; -----------------------------------------------------\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Joakim Ohlrogge\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Agical AB\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; V=E4sterl=E5nggatan 79,=\r\n 2 tr\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; 111 29 Stockholm, SWEDEN\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Mobile: &lt;%2B46-70=\r\n8-754004&gt;+46-708-754004\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Blog: johlrogge.wordpress.com\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; E-m=\r\nail: joakim.ohlrogge@...\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; -----------------=\r\n-------------------\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
