JUnit is\ngreat as\n&gt; a standalone, complete unit test framework.  It&#39;s also useful as an\n&gt; assertion and test driver library.\n&gt; \n&gt; We use JUnit at Macromedia for plain old unit testing, but we also\nhave a\n&gt; homegrown automated functional test framework that uses JUnit (via\nAnt)\n&gt; for assertion, test driver, and reporting capabilities.\n&gt; \n&gt; Scott Stirling\n&gt; JRun QA\n&gt; Macromedia\n&gt; \n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Chris Eppstein\n&gt; To: &#39;junit@yahoogroups.com&#39;\n&gt; Sent: 1/21/2002 10:48 AM\n&gt; Subject: RE: [junit] Junit support for non-standard distributed\napplicatio\n&gt; ns\n&gt; \n&gt; Guillaume,\n&gt; \n&gt; \tI&#39;m wondering if you could be clever and just run all the tests\n&gt; on\n&gt; the same machine by putting the client and the server on the same\n&gt; machine\n&gt; (within the same vm even). Remember that the point of JUnit is not to\n&gt; functionally test the software. It is to unit test it. Try to break\ndown\n&gt; your code into small testable pieces. By testing each piece you will\n&gt; have\n&gt; greater control and more confidence that it will work once you put it\n&gt; together. It may not even be necessary to run the client and server at\n&gt; the\n&gt; same time if you take this approach; the test case could act as the\n&gt; server\n&gt; for testing the client and vice-versa. These are just a few thoughts\n--\n&gt; the\n&gt; details of your particular program may prevent such an approach. But\nif\n&gt; you\n&gt; are testing your code from the very beginning you shouldn&#39;t have too\n&gt; much\n&gt; trouble doing it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Chris\n&gt; \n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: guillaume_berche [mailto:guillaume.berche@...]\n&gt; Sent: Monday, January 21, 2002 8:49 AM\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: [junit] Junit support for non-standard distributed\napplications\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Hello,\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m working on a Java layer implementing various communication\n&gt; infrastructrure betwen processes based on raw TCP and UDP. I would\n&gt; like to test it using Junit. However, this requires me to write a\n&gt; test case which is distributed among many processes which act as\n&gt; client/servers.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve looked into jakarta&#39;s cactus, and Junit EE but I understand they\n&gt; would support only distributed applications based on standard\n&gt; communication protocols (namely HTTP and an EJB contained)\n&gt; \n&gt; Is there an extension to Junit that would support testing of non-\n&gt; standard distributed applications?\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve started designing an RMI-based version of the junit interfaces\n&gt; where a testcase could spawn one or more &quot;distributed test cases&quot;\n&gt; running on remote hosts and that would report their status through\n&gt; the originating test&#39;s TestListener. I&#39;m basically remotizing the\n&gt; junit interfaces.\n&gt; \n&gt; I wonder if such extension would already exist and if I could reuse\n&gt; it rather than redoing this from scratch.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks for your help,\n&gt; \n&gt; Guillaume.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
