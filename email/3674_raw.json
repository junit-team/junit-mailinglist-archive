I know that&#39;s been the\ncase with me. I tend to spend test effort where I am likely to find the\nmost bugs with the least work. The common practice seems to be to refactor\nas much of the logic out of the GUI as possible, automate just enough of\nthe GUI test for sanity checking, then manually walk through it as part of\na functional test process. It&#39;s *not* entirely satisfactory, but does\n(mostly) work.\n\nOn Thu, 27 Dec 2001, Lee Chalupa wrote:\n\n&gt; Thanks for your time Berin.  I do appreciate it.\n&gt;\n&gt; My first assumption is that most programmers use jOptionPane frequently in the GUIs they write.\n&gt;\n&gt; My second assumption is that these programmers use Junit to test their GUIs including jOptionPane.\n&gt;\n&gt; Before I go deeper into the details of jOptionPane, I wonder if these are valid assumptions?\n&gt;\n&gt; If they are valid assumptions, I am curious.  Why are my questions about this common approach unanswered or at least\n&gt; off the beaten trail?  The response I have received leads me to believe that this path is less traveled which leads me to\n&gt; believe that I should be using another coding technique/approach that is more common.\n&gt;\n&gt; Can you help me understand this broader issue?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks again.\n&gt;\n&gt; lee\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; 12/27/01 11:17:07 AM, Berin Loritsch &lt;bloritsch@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   lchalupa wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   &gt;  Messages\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; Messages Help\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; Reply\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; | Forward\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; | View Source\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; | Unwrap Lines\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; | Delete\n&gt; &gt;   &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   &gt;  Message 3643 of 3658  |\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; Previous\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; |\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; Next\n&gt; &gt;   &gt;  [\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; Up Thread\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; ]\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; Message Index  Msg #\n&gt; &gt;   &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; From:\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; At the request of a group member....\n&gt; &gt;   &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; &quot;lchalupa&quot; &lt;lchalupa@s...&gt;\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; Date:  Wed Dec 26, 2001  1:16\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; pm\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; Subject:  Am I headed in the right direction here?\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; New to Junit.\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; Please give advice on my approach to testing a gui.\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; In the gui, my target method displays an instance of jOptionPane class\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; to confirm a selection the user has just made. In my junit test\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; method, I want to be able to select and close the button on\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; jOptionPane after it has been displayed.\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; I am not sure how to do this. I have done this on dialogs that I have\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; created myself by looking up the button and using doClick(). Seems to\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; work just fine.\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; So, do I use the same approach on jOptionPane? I assume I would look\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; up the identifier of the button in the source and refer to it in the\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; test method? Or am I missing a more direct approach to the problem?\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; In short, I am not sure how to test a jOption Pane using Junit.\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; Am I on the right track?\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; Thanks.\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; lee\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   So what were the results of trying the help from the previous message?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   --\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   &quot;They that give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety\n&gt; &gt;     deserve neither liberty nor safety.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;                    - Benjamin Franklin\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;                 Yahoo!
