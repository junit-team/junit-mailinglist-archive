The DAO impls go in their own\nproject (project/module/jar). Then, you write unit tests for the DAO impls\nin the dao impl project. That way, you only &quot;need&quot; the database when running\nunit tests for the DAOs, you use a mocking tool to mockup the DAO interfaces\nin your application project. At that point, you can write your service layer\nunit tests. You then mock-up the service layer interfaces and start writing\nstruts action unit tests.\n\nIf you write service layer unit tests that depend on a real database, then\nyou&#39;ve not written unit tests, you&#39;ve written integration tests. The same\ngoes for struts action tests that depend on a real service layer.\n\nThe pragmatist in me says write your DOA impl unit tests to run against the\ndatabase. Then write your service unit tests with a dependency on you\ndatabase (just recognize that these are integration tests). Skip the struts\naction unit tests. There should be NO business logic in a struts action and\nreally little other logic other than mapping and service calls.\n\nWhen you write your DAO impl unit tests, you need to make sure that you\ncircumvent the DAO layer for test setup and verification. If you use the DAO\nimplementations to setup and verify, then you are testing stuff, but you\ncannot define what you are testing.\n\n--dlm\n\nOn Tue, Dec 2, 2008 at 4:46 PM, Kenan Azam &lt;azam.kenan@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt;   Hi there,\n&gt; I am a developer working on a web application which utilizes Struts as the\n&gt; controller and Spring to do dependency injection at the Data Access Objects\n&gt; layer.\n&gt; I want to introduce unit tests in the application.\n&gt;\n&gt; The current design of the application is as follows\n&gt;\n&gt; JavaScript/Jsps/ ----&gt; Struts Action Forms and Struts Action Classes --&gt;\n&gt; Service Class usually has most of the logic ---&gt; DAO objects (automatically\n&gt; generated by ibatis a hibernate like framework)---&gt; Sql Maps --&gt; Database\n&gt;\n&gt; I am currently writing test cases for the Service Class which involves a\n&gt; lot\n&gt; of database transactions.
