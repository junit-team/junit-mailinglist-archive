Not again!&quot;\n\t\n\tHaving tags like that would promote the idea that you test\nmethods. \n\tEven that you have test-methods that test production-methods and\n\ttest-classes that test production-classes.\n\t\n\tYou don&#39;t want to test methods, you want to test behaviour\n(which, of\n\tcourse, is done by calling methods).\n\t\n\tThat&#39;s not the way to use JUnit.  TestCase subclasses are for\n\tpackagine a test fixture and the tests that run in the context\nof that\n\tfixture, not for collecting tests that test a spcecific class.\n\t\n\tThat may not be what you meant, but that&#39;s what it sounded like.\n\t\n\tDave\n\t\n\t\n\t\nYahoo!
