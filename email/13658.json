Then you can put the <br/>\n&gt; reparse<br/>\n&gt; of your file in setUp(), which -- as someone said earlier -- makes the<br/>\n&gt; intent obvious.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Let me stress this point further.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In JUnit, you have four ways to initialize / tear down your test, and <br/>\n&gt; they<br/>\n&gt; are *all* equivalent:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; - At the beginning and end of each test method<br/>\n&gt; - In setUp()/tearDown()<br/>\n&gt; - In the constructor<br/>\n&gt; - At the field declaration level<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I find that confusing as hell, so I *strongly* recommend to use<br/>\n&gt; setUp/tearDown at the exclusion of everything else.  Again, the idea <br/>\n&gt; is to<br/>\n&gt; make the intent obvious.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Actually, each of these methods is *not* equivalent, although they all <br/>\nhave the same &quot;scope&quot; with respect to a given test (i.e. they affect a <br/>\nsingle test method).  Those non-intuitive differences add to the <br/>\nargument that only one method should be used and the others excluded.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNotably:<br/>\n<br/>\n   setUp/tearDown: preferred, since exceptions are handled and <br/>\npropagated as test results; also separates setup/cleanup from the <br/>\nactual tests<br/>\n<br/>\n   within test method: makes the test method cluttered and more complex <br/>\nif you properly handle cleanup within the test method<br/>\n<br/>\n   constructor/field declaration: no teardown whatsoever; whether or not <br/>\nfields get GC&#39;d depends on your test runner (the JUnit runners won&#39;t <br/>\never release your tests, and therefore your fields remain uncollected). <br/>\n  note also that between this method and setup/teardown there is a big <br/>\ndifference between *when* the setup takes place; setup/teardown doesn&#39;t <br/>\ntake effect until the test is actually run, while constructor/field <br/>\ndeclaration happens as soon as the test object is created.</div>",
