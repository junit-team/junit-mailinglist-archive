I see it all the time. More specifically, I see people<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  acting as though they do /not/ have permission to remove dead code. &quot;If<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  it ain&#39;t broke, don&#39;t fix it&quot; and &quot;Don&#39;t touch it; it might break&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If I think some code needs to be removed I remove it, if I think some<br/>\n&gt; code needs to be added I add it, if I think some code needs to be<br/>\n&gt; changed I change it. If I feel uncertain I ask someone for more<br/>\n&gt; information/dig for more information before I descide what to do.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Ideally, every developer would do that, but we all know that doesn&#39;t<br/>\nhappen very often.<br/>\n<br/>\n*snip*<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;  Anything that a project manager in particular might perceive as /extra/<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  time is different. That includes refactoring, testing (we have a whole<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  department for that), design meetings, and so on. Of course, it depends<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  on what activities that project manager participated in himself when he<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  wrote code.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yes, I&#39;m aware of that and talking about things is usually not<br/>\n&gt; preceived as extra time since talking is free and coding costs<br/>\n&gt; money... Writing documents also costs less money then coding right? :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In my experience people are less interested in /how/ you work as long<br/>\n&gt; as you deliver. Working stuff is in general more apreachiated than<br/>\n&gt; broken stuff (but that is unfortunately not always the case since<br/>\n&gt; fixing broken stuff in the last minute can make you a hero).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I want to work where you work. You see, many large American<br/>\ncorporations have coding standards and technology standards and to<br/>\nviolate them is a fast track to being unemployed. (And, yes, I have<br/>\nreceived many such emails from management, reminding me of such<br/>\nthings. At my previous employer, we even had to sign paperwork once a<br/>\nyear saying that we understood the company guidelines.) I say all that<br/>\nto explain that most of us CAN&#39;T just do whatever we want. That&#39;s why<br/>\nsome places don&#39;t even have JUnit; their management hasn&#39;t approved it<br/>\nyet. It&#39;s also why so many on this list don&#39;t use JUnit 4.x, their<br/>\ncompanies haven&#39;t even approved Java 5 yet, so JUnit 4.x is out of the<br/>\nquestion.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; TDD is a way of delviering things, so what keeps an individual from<br/>\n&gt; doing it? I seldom see any eyebrows raised when developers write<br/>\n&gt; main(String[] args) methods to test their code and I never saw any of<br/>\n&gt; those developers ask management for permission to do that...<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You don&#39;t need permission for main() methods, but you do need<br/>\npermission for JUnit.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; I think, if you manage to convince your team /first/ then management is as<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; good as convinced when the results start showing.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  ...but in the meantime, when the team goes through the chaos period,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  management has plenty of time and opportunity to step and say, &quot;See? I<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  told you this stuff was extra effort. Why are you doing this? Stop<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  wasting our money.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; That is true. My idea was basically that by setting a good example it<br/>\n&gt; may rub off on others and that you can evolve gently into TDD without<br/>\n&gt; chaos... That contradicts my experience from reality but I want it to<br/>\n&gt; be true...<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Amen. It&#39;s a pleasant dream.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;  &gt; I think by example is the best way to go, start with your self and influence<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; those around you.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; /if/ you are convinced about the benefits of unittesting then /not/ doing<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; unittesting would be unprofessional since you choose not to do it.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; So start doing it and infect the others. Don&#39;t have managment inject the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; virus into an unwilling team by placing demands on testcoverage etc.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; That will rebound in my experience.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; So, what do you think? Should we tell the story to our fellow developers<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; instead of management?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  I don&#39;t understand why you would frame the question as &quot;instead of&quot;. Why<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  not &quot;in addition to&quot;? I think my manager deserve to know what I&#39;m doing.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Good point, I wanted to shift the image. Maybe I should have said<br/>\n&gt; should we tell the story to the developers /and/ management I still<br/>\n&gt; think that the biggest challenge is convincing developers. If all<br/>\n&gt; developers showed conviction that TDD is the better way to go the<br/>\n&gt; descision would be easy for management. Generally it is not like that<br/>\n&gt; and management is faced with convincing their developers that TDD<br/>\n&gt; rocks /if/ they descide to go that way and implement TDD.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I still maintain that the biggest problem is that &quot;you get what you<br/>\nreward&quot;. Management reward fast development, so they get fast<br/>\ndevelopment, together with all of the bugs and problems that accompany<br/>\nit. Support is a matter of throwing the code over the internal wall<br/>\nand letting a different group pull out their hair trying to keep it<br/>\nworking. Under this philosophy, anything that isn&#39;t writing shipping<br/>\ncode is waste. Tests don&#39;t ship, so they&#39;re waste. Let the suckers in<br/>\nsupport write tests if they think that&#39;ll help.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I also think that management has a right to know what I am doing. In<br/>\n&gt; addition to that I am not sure that management is interested in every<br/>\n&gt; detail about how I&#39;m doing it as long as I deliver satisfactory<br/>\n&gt; results. When we set out on crusades to convince management on the<br/>\n&gt; benefits of TDD maybe we are making too big a deal out of it? Is there<br/>\n&gt; anyway we can start out small and evolve to where we want to go?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Delivering good systems and explaining that they have tests does help.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I was on a company when I was able to convince management to let me<br/>\n&gt; run a TDD-pilot. Since that went well demands on unittests for all<br/>\n&gt; projects followed shortly after. The request from the projects came<br/>\n&gt; backsoon after that on some metrics that would show that the demand<br/>\n&gt; had been met. The reply came after some time that 70% test coverage<br/>\n&gt; was the demand.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Cool! too bad I didn&#39;t get that having unit-tests is pretty worthless<br/>\n&gt; if the authors don&#39;t know why they are writing them (if only reason<br/>\n&gt; developers are writing them is to reach the magic number of 70%<br/>\n&gt; testcoverage). Some homework remained to be done...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Summary: I don&#39;t know whats best. Sure, convince management.don&#39;t hide<br/>\n&gt; stuff (that was not what I meant) but /don&#39;t forget to get your fellow<br/>\n&gt; developers on the train/. If they are on the train convincing<br/>\n&gt; management is easier. If they are not I don&#39;t know if you have a<br/>\n&gt; case...<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Most corporate developers have been beaten down by years of &quot;get &#39;r<br/>\ndone&quot; dive in and start coding pushes from management. Is it any<br/>\nwonder that they don&#39;t want anything to do with something that, at<br/>\nbest, will be viewed with suspicion by management?<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry for sounding cynical, but I&#39;ve worked at too many corporations<br/>\nand I&#39;ve seen too many Dilbertesque PHBs complaining about the time<br/>\ntaken for testing.<br/>\n<br/>\nSimon<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nsimonpeter.org | simonpeter.com | techbook.info</div>",
