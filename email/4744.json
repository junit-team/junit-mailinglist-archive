(Let&#39;s restrict the responses to all the &#39;nays&#39; rather <br/>\nthan the &#39;yays.&#39;)  I&#39;ve only used asserts through JUnit&#39;s TestCase.<br/>\n<br/>\n-shane<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Monday, April 22, 2002, at 06:02  PM, dvydra2 wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; We had to change all methods in Assert class from static to instance<br/>\n&gt; for functional testing, the same approach as JFunc.
