In this dir I put the excluded.properties.<br/>\nI added c:&#92;XYZ to my classpath.<br/>\nand then I added the junit.jar<br/>\nIt still did not work.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo then I decided to replace the excluded.prop in the jar with a new <br/>\none, so I extracted the whole junit.jar, but could not find the <br/>\nexcluded.prop file anywhere<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat am I doing wrong?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In junit@y..., Mike Clark &lt;mike@c...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; parul_49 wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;I have another question, <br/>\n&gt; &gt;I read on the FAQ&#39;s site for Junit, saying that if you get a <br/>\nlinkage <br/>\n&gt; &gt;error, change the excluded.properties file, to include other <br/>\n&gt; &gt;packages, and place that in ur classpath before the junit.jar.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Yes, in the same package structure as it is in the junit.jar file, <br/>\n&gt; specifically:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;     /junit/runner/excluded.properties<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;What I have done is that I modified the excluded.properties and <br/>\n&gt; &gt;added/replaced it in the junit.jar and mounted it.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Is that the same thing, or will it not work?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If by &quot;mounted&quot; you mean added it to the classpath used by NetBeans <br/>\nor <br/>\n&gt; whatever, then I suppose so.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I tried using the swingui, but it gives me all kinds of <br/>\nexceptions. I <br/>\n&gt; &gt;know my tests run thru&#39; the textui, but it gives a <br/>\nclassCastException <br/>\n&gt; &gt;and a null ptr exception.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;would anyone know why?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I suspect your changed excluded.properties file isn&#39;t in play.  <br/>\nPerhaps <br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s not in the correct package.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Also I am using net Beans, so when u say that put it in your <br/>\n&gt; &gt;classpath before the junit.jar does that mean mount it before you <br/>\n&gt; &gt;mount the junit.jar.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It means the classpath order defines your fully-qualified <br/>\n&gt; excluded.properties file before the default one.  If &quot;mounting&quot; <br/>\ngets you <br/>\n&gt; there, then so be it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Mike </span></blockquote></div>",
