Yes, I know it is supposed to be a unit test framework... ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Thu, 2008-07-17 at 08:58 -0700, Hans Schwaebli wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Hi Kent,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; specifying dependencies is a little extra work, I agree. But it has<br/>\n&gt; advantages.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Consecutive tests which depend on failed tests, are not executed,<br/>\n&gt; which speeds up the tests. It also increases the information value.<br/>\n&gt; People are not confused with dozens or even hundreds of failed tests<br/>\n&gt; when just one or two tests really failed on which most other tests<br/>\n&gt; depend. I know of situations where there are dozenzs of failed tests<br/>\n&gt; (or more) reported by CruiseControl, and noone looks into them until<br/>\n&gt; one week before release date. This happens. It makes developers afraid<br/>\n&gt; to look into the apparent mess. If there would be just one or two<br/>\n&gt; failed tests, they would look into it more likely, and sooner.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The heuristic strategy would not really solve the problem. since it is<br/>\n&gt; not equivalent to the dependency specification. It would still run all<br/>\n&gt; tests, but the likelyhood that the first run tests are the cause for<br/>\n&gt; all the errors would not be very high I think, whereas you could trust<br/>\n&gt; the dependencies very much if they are set correctly.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Dependencies are a frequent topic. We have it in OSGI, in issue<br/>\n&gt; tracking software, in project management software, in requirement<br/>\n&gt; specifications and in test specifications. Why not support it in JUnit<br/>\n&gt; tests too?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Well, this is just some quick thoughts about it. This issue alone will<br/>\n&gt; certainly not draw people to other test frameworks, but it would<br/>\n&gt; improve JUnit I think. Noone would be forced to use that feature, but<br/>\n&gt; I think it would be good, if one could use it with JUnit, even in an<br/>\n&gt; coarse way (for example if the dependency &quot;testApplicationServerRuns&quot;<br/>\n&gt; passed).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Bye,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hans<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --- On Thu, 7/17/08, Kent Beck &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kentb@...\">kentb@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; From: Kent Beck &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kentb@...\">kentb@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: [junit] Does JUnit 4 now support dependencies?<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Date: Thursday, July 17, 2008, 9:28 AM<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hans,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I agree that test dependencies are a good idea.

I would<br/>\n&gt; rather<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; put the same time into improving the design of the software so the<br/>\n&gt; tests can<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; run fast.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I wonder if it would be possible to infer dependencies from historical<br/>\n&gt; data,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; though.
