Spend enough time with it, and it doesn&#39;t feel completely<br/>\nforeign, but it&#39;s not really Java.  The main driver for this is that a test<br/>\nis a named block, and reflectively-retrieved methods have, until now, been<br/>\nby far the cheapest syntactic way to create a named block.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith lambdas, you can now enable an even cheaper named-block syntax:<br/>\n<br/>\ntest(&quot;Here&#39;s my test name&quot;, () -&gt; {<br/>\n  assertTheRightThings();<br/>\n});<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, rather than having to enable all kinds of weird annotation-driven<br/>\nextension schemes, extensions can be built in the natural Java way, through<br/>\nfunction composition and inheritance.  Create a paramTest function, and<br/>\nyou&#39;ve got parameterized tests:<br/>\n<br/>\nparamTest(&quot;Name&quot;, computeParameters(), (param1, param2) -&gt; {<br/>\n   assertTheRightThing(param1, param2);<br/>\n}<br/>\n<br/>\nPush further, and the line between assertions and tests begins to look a<br/>\nlittle fuzzy.  I&#39;m not sure what lies beyond that particular quantum limit,<br/>\nthough.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nFYI, note that QUnit is a JavaScript test framework that does take this<br/>\napproach (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://qunitjs.com/cookbook/)\">http://qunitjs.com/cookbook/)</a>.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn general, the first few test frameworks that get released for a language<br/>\noften include at least one whose chief advantage is its familiarity for<br/>\nXUnit users*; later, many users often settle into a framework that fits the<br/>\ngrain of the language better.  Since I&#39;ve never been able to figure out<br/>\nwhat the grain of JavaScript is, I can&#39;t say which frameworks are in which<br/>\ncamp.<br/>\n<br/>\n   David Saff<br/>\n<br/>\n*  (the most extreme example being .NET: NUnit&#39;s first release was a<br/>\nmethod-name-for-method-name clone of JUnit (3.7?), down to methods designed<br/>\nto detect if the test was running on the quirky VisualAge VM, which had no<br/>\n.NET equivalent)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Thu, Jan 10, 2013 at 12:05 PM, Kevin Cooney &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kcooney@...\">kcooney@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; **<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On Jan 10, 2013 8:21 AM, &quot;tibord47&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tibord47@...\">tibord47@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hi Jens,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I have to only agree.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The time is getting still shorter for Java 8 release, and thus missing it<br/>\n&gt; would mean that JUnit as a nice framework will be too old.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Too old? Really?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I think we have some time. There was some delay between TestNG being<br/>\n&gt; released and the release of JUnit 4.0, but JUnit 4 still got adopted.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Also agree with David that watching the steps of other new frameworks is<br/>\n&gt; important as well.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I was thinking about that. JavaScript is a functional language, but all of<br/>\n&gt; the JS test frameworks that I am aware of use JUnit-like syntax for<br/>\n&gt; defining test cases (JsUnit defines test functions at global scope,<br/>\n&gt; JsTestDriver uses methods on a class). If functional programming could<br/>\n&gt; change the paradigm for defining tests, you would think it would have<br/>\n&gt; happened in JavaScript.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Am I missing something?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sure, you could use functional programming to write more powerful<br/>\n&gt; assertions, but that could be done in an assertion framework.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The places I see where functional programming could help are Theories<br/>\n&gt; and parametrised tests. I think we could do that in JUnit4 with at most a<br/>\n&gt; new core Runner.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sure, there are many parts of the implementation of JUnit 4 that I would<br/>\n&gt; love to change, but building a new Java test framework from scratch would<br/>\n&gt; be a large effort. One often-forgotten piece is all the tooling (IDE<br/>\n&gt; integration, build tool integration, etc).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; - Kevin<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The modularity, as somebody mentioned, has to be also considered, but<br/>\n&gt; without knowing the outcome it is quite difficult.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; So perhaps template tests under new languages without having a framework<br/>\n&gt; should be written first to see what wants to be reached.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Features and goals from other projects should be considered.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; BR, Tibor<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;jens_schauder&quot; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; It looks like Closure will finally find their way into Java. With this<br/>\n&gt; feature many nice ways to do thing become possible. Therefore I am<br/>\n&gt; wondering if other people agree that it might be time for a JUnit5 putting<br/>\n&gt; this new feature to good use.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; A source for inspiration for me in this regard are the FunSuite of<br/>\n&gt; ScalaTest <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.scalatest.org/getting_started_with_fun_suite\">http://www.scalatest.org/getting_started_with_fun_suite</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; There a test definition is a method call (instead of a method<br/>\n&gt; definition in JUnit) that registers a test for execution. It looks roughly<br/>\n&gt; like this:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; class MyTestClass{<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; test(&quot;The test name&quot;){<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; // the actual test goes here<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; }<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; }<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; With this approach things like Rules become extremly trivial, since all<br/>\n&gt; you have to do is wrap the code block (i.e. closure) in a new new code<br/>\n&gt; block.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Also parameterized test become fairly easy, because you would just put<br/>\n&gt; the call to test in a loop.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; What do you think? Is this an interesting direction for JUnit to go?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; kind regards<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Jens<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>",
