However, I am getting problems running test suites as \n&gt; the order of execution does not appear to be constant. \n&gt; Tests are written in this order : \n&gt; testGetVehicle() \n&gt; testAddVehicle() \n&gt; testSaveVehicle() \n&gt; testDeleteVehicle() \n&gt; \n&gt; Overall flow is to retrieve an entity, modify it, then delete it. \n&gt; \n&gt; Tests appear to be executed in this order : \n&gt; testDeleteVehicle() \n&gt; testGetVehicle() \n&gt; testAddVehicle() \n&gt; testSaveVehicle() \n&gt; \n&gt; By running out of order the testDeleteVehicle() method cant \n&gt; find the modified entity, and fails its test. \n&gt; \n&gt; Using JBuilder 6, is this related to most recent changes and \n&gt; compilation ? JUnitEE itself appears to be working fine. Any \n&gt; pointers of where to look ? \n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks \n&gt; \n&gt; Scott \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ----------\n&gt; Get a free, personalised email address at http://another.com\n&gt; TXT ALRT!
