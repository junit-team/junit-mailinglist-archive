Sorry if this is stupid=\r\n question.\n&gt; \n&gt; I need to write a test case that tests a class whose behavi=\r\nor depends on\n&gt; a System property.  The class reads the System property at =\r\nclass initialization\n&gt; time.  I&#39;d like to have multiple test cases, each of=\r\n which sets a different\n&gt; value for the System property, so each of the tes=\r\nts needs to be run in a\n&gt; separate JVM or possibly a separate ClassLoader.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; Is there a simple way to (e.g.) annotate my test case to cause JUnit t=\r\no\n&gt; handle this for me?\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m invoking JUnit as part of a maven build.  =\r\nNote that I don&#39;t want to\n&gt; run *all* of my JUnit tests in a single separat=\r\ne JVM, I want to run\n&gt; certain test cases each in their own separate JVM (o=\r\nr ClassLoader).\n&gt; \n&gt; If I have to start a new JVM or create a new ClassLoad=\r\ner myself, what&#39;s\n&gt; the best way to initialize the CLASSPATH and find the c=\r\nlass to be tested\n&gt; from within a JUnit test case running under maven?\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n Thanks.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n",
