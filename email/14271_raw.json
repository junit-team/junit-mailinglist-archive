From my point of view this \n&gt;&gt; is definitely a very good reason to have it.\n&gt; \n&gt; OK. I can see that, but I think that&#39;s a very bad idea. A JUnit \n&gt; assertion test failure is not at all the same thing as a Java language \n&gt; assert failure. \n\nNot very sure they are so different in nature. According to the definition:\n\n[quote]\nAn assertion is a statement in the JavaTM programming language that enables you to test your \nassumptions about your program.\n[/quote]\n\nThis is exactly what your tests are doing: test assumptions about your program.\n\nThey are two different things and they should be\n&gt; distinguishable. Failure to do that might cause unexpected problems with \n&gt; various tools that interpret an AssertionError as meaning one thing when \n&gt; JUnit makes it mean something different.\n&gt; \n\nsorry i have to disagree.\n\n:alex |.::the_mindstorm::.|\n\n",
