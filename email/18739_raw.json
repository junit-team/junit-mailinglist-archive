Gunderson &lt;jgunders@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Kevin:\n&gt;         I think these are good ideas, although if I was deluged with 5000 test\n&gt; cases that I then had to validate manually, I&#39;d probably not use it.\n\nOur posts crossed in the ether but I hope it was clear that I agree\nwith you. We, at Agitar, have put a lot of effort into the\nverification scenario but we have not neglected the verification\nscenario either. We are tackling it on a number of fronts.\n\nOne approach is similar to the approach you suggested where you seed\nthe test generator with some known-to-be-correct cases. The problem\nwith this approach is that, in the limit, it becomes easier to write\nthe test manually than to prod the machine into finding the right\ncase.  If the machine can take these suggestions and riff on them to\nfind &#39;cases like them&#39; it becomes more interesting though.\n\nAnother approach is one that David Saff describes in his &quot;The Practice\nof Theories&quot; (http://www.tiny.cc/HttFz) paper in which the human\nproposes hypotheses and the test generator finds examples that confirm\nthe hypothesis or that prove it to be false.\n\nYet another approach - my favorite - is to have the machine generate\nlots of examples of input-output sets and make it easy for a human\nreader to review them and spot inconsistencies. Finding smart ways of\nfiltering down all the possible examples and smart ways of presenting\nthem to the user are the two main challenges in this approach.\n\nMeanwhile, we think there is value in pure regression testing too.\n\nKevin\n\nhttp://www.junitfactory.com\nYou send us code. We send you tests. For free.\n\n",
