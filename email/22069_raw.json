I understand that had I done this pr=\r\nogrammatically, I could have attached a RunListener, implementing the testR=\r\nunFinished(Result) method.\n&gt;\n&gt; Is there any way to achieve a similar effect=\r\n within the JUnit runner in Eclipse?\n&gt;\n&gt; Rationale: I have actual unit test=\r\ns, then bigger tests, then full-fledged &quot;integration tests&quot; or whatever one=\r\n call them, where I take up my entire application-local server thingy and p=\r\nrocess a bunch of items, letting JUnit check after the dust settles whether=\r\n the items was processed correctly. However, the internals are multi thread=\r\ned, and also, this being a Swing app, lots of Runnables are sent over to th=\r\ne EDT. This is all good.\n&gt;\n&gt; However, I&#39;ve sometimes seen that a thread cra=\r\nshes (uncaught exception), without this being noticed by any of the tests r=\r\nunning (I&#39;ve e.g. seen a ConcurrentModificationException take down the EDT,=\r\n without having a clue as to why I got that - and the next event posted jus=\r\nt brings up a new EDT, so I get a green bar, but with an uncaught error). W=\r\nhat I&#39;d want to achieve, is to install an uncaught exception handler, and t=\r\nhen, as a final step to ALL permutations of tests (e.g. both for a single u=\r\nnit test, and also for the project-wide test run), run a test that checks w=\r\nhether any thread-killing exception was caught by the handler, and if so, f=\r\nails the run. (I&#39;d throw the exception that was caught, and in any case als=\r\no log-dump any and all such exceptions).\n&gt;\n&gt; (As a very similar question, I=\r\n&#39;d also like to have a &quot;before any tests&quot; thing, like the RunListener.testR=\r\nunStarted(Description) method, where I could set up logging. Now I do that =\r\nby letting ALL tests have a static block that calls a specific static metho=\r\nd which has a static boolean that tells whether the log system already is s=\r\net up. This also works just nicely, but is a hassle nevertheless. However, =\r\nit is not possible, as I see it, to solve the above question in the same ma=\r\nnner.)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
