I have a set of classes\n&gt; whose values are set \n&gt; from a file by a Reader object. Now I want to test\n&gt; whether these \n&gt; values are set correctly. I can use preset values\n&gt; for testing \n&gt; purpose. But due to the large number and complexity\n&gt; of these classes \n&gt; it would be very difficult and cumbersome to create\n&gt; objects with \n&gt; these preset values manually for testing against the\n&gt; ones created by \n&gt; the Reader.\n&gt; \n&gt; I am thinking of creating a helper class for each of\n&gt; the above \n&gt; classes. I will pass it the object to compare, and\n&gt; it will compare \n&gt; the object&#39;s data against pre-defined values that\n&gt; will be stored in \n&gt; the helper classes. I will need to extend junit&#39;s\n&gt; Assert class for \n&gt; these helper class, since they will assert if there\n&gt; is a data \n&gt; mismatch. So my question is,  is it okay to extend\n&gt; Assert in my own \n&gt; classes ? Has anyone faced this problem before, and\n&gt; if so how did you \n&gt; solve this ? Any help will be appreciated.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; - krishnan\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nSend FREE Valentine eCards with Yahoo!
