The annual maintenance and support is <br/>\ntargeted at companies who want/need more/faster support.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith the &quot;basic maintenance and support&quot;, you still have access to the <br/>\nsupport forums,  and the  EAP (Early Access Program). It is still <br/>\nrunning, and has already produced 2 bugfixes releases, that work with <br/>\nthe standard licenses.<br/>\nIt should also give you access to next EAP (for the next version), that, <br/>\nI think, should start in about 2 months.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheer up : they are not going the JBuilder way.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlain Ravet</div>",
