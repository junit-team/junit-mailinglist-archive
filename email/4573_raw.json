How van above can be\nimplemented By using Junit. \n3) When i have to get input from the konsole,  where i\ncan write the coding whether in source code or in\njunit framework because i write thecoding to get input\nin source code then i again have to repeat the same\ncoding in the framwork becaust to compare the value\n[iam little bit  confused here]  \n3) I do a Junit framework Now i connected that to\nsourc code, the result of sourc code can be obtained\nbut how can i compare with that using assert ? that is\nwhether i have to write another source code in the\nframwork and compare the result with the source code\nresult. In examples like fibinnaci iam able ot chack\nonly for null and i cannot chack for assert equals\nbecause it cannot ale to give the relut value becuse\nit is dynamically displaying, how can i do i need the\nreply \nThank u\nC.A.mans \n \n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
