Where I work, we are =\r\ndoing lots of hiring this year.  Every development engineer candidate that =\r\ncomes in gets to do at least two programming problems on the board.  For on=\r\ne of the problems, the question is something like, &quot;Write a function in any=\r\n language you want (except Perl) to do XXX.&quot;  And then once they have that,=\r\n we ask them to tell us how they&#39;d unit test what they just wrote.\n\nIt&#39;s a =\r\nrare individual that says, &quot;Damn, now I realize I should have written the u=\r\nnit test FIRST!&quot;  And out of probably 100 candidates in the past few years =\r\nof this approach, not a single candidate has ever actually written a JUnit/=\r\nNUnit/whatever test case first.  But I hold out hope that person will somed=\r\nay grace our interview room.\n\n\nCheers,\nTodd.\n \n\n-----Original Message-----\n=\r\nFrom: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of Mik=\r\ne Forsberg\nSent: Monday, May 03, 2010 10:24 AM\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSu=\r\nbject: Re: [junit] When it matters most, don&#39;t forget your tests.\n\nThank yo=\r\nu to all those that responded.\n\nI agree that if a candidate spends all thei=\r\nr time on the simple error cases\nthen they don&#39;t understand TDD.\n\nI think a=\r\n pair programming environment would be ideal for an interview.\nMaybe actual=\r\nly have the candidate solve an actual problem you&#39;re solving.\nThis may soun=\r\nd like it may take a lot of time, but I&#39;d rather be part of a\nteam that can=\r\n spend 1-2 hours writing code in an interview, then waste that\ntime on soft=\r\n silks.  If the candidate complains that it&#39;s not their\nIDE/editor of choic=\r\ne, that should send up a flag. Granted this is my ideal\nenvironment.\n\nWhat =\r\nabout a 2 stage interview? One where they write the tests for a already\nexi=\r\nsting piece of code (maybe to increase the codes functionality), then\nanoth=\r\ner where they try and write code to get the tests to pass.  Granted\nthis is=\r\n not testing if they actually use TDD, but it would show if they have\nthe s=\r\nkill.  Maybe forcing the iteration process of test -&gt; functionality -&gt;\ntest=\r\n -&gt; functionality will show if they have the skill.\n\nI think spending some =\r\ntime, 2-3 hours with a machine, later in the interview\nprocess, say after a=\r\n phone screen, maybe second round of face to face, might\npay dividends in t=\r\nhe quality of people on a team.  Then again it might\ndepend on how skilled =\r\nyou need this individual to be.\n\nThanks for the input,\n\nBig Mike\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt;\n\n\n[=\r\nNon-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n-------------------=\r\n-----------------\n\nYahoo!
