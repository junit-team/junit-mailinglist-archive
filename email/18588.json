I understand that TDD is <br/>\na design activity , however what I wish to tackle is the test-first <br/>\nconcept of TDD. I realise that there are many phases to TDD, but it <br/>\nseems what people have problems with is the idea of writing the <br/>\ntests before writing the code. With that in mind, I figured if i <br/>\ncould help autogenerate some basic testing codes to get them off on <br/>\na start, they could get the hang of it and probably improve on the <br/>\ntests generated later.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nErm does that make sense?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMost other tools out there requires additional installation etc, <br/>\nwhich is why I hope to build on JUnit&#39;s core code itself to generate <br/>\nthe additional test cases. In such a way, the user probably won&#39;t <br/>\nneed any additional application, just an updated version of the <br/>\nJUnit jar file for eclipse plugin or whatever?<br/>\n<br/>\nI am kinda new at this and would appreciate any help or suggestions<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks a bunch,<br/>\nJimm<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Andrew McDonagh&quot; &lt;andrewmcdonagh@...&gt; <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; On 12/27/06, chet hendrickson &lt;lists@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hello Jimm,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I can imagine some benefit from generating some asserts as part <br/>\n </span></blockquote>of the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; second or third pass of test creation.

It does not sound like TDD.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; And there&#39;s nothing wrong with that - JUnit is a tool that makes no<br/>\n&gt; assumptions on what design process we use.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Indeed, there are already several tools out there that can<br/>\n&gt; autogenerate JUnit tests for code, and still others that &#39;play&#39; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>with<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; the byte code to see if your unit tests are actually any good at<br/>\n&gt; testing.
