The parameterized tests are a bit more of a pain to set up;\nbut they provide a little more control over how things get matched up.\nOf course, theories allow for much more robust data sets by combining\nall the data points in every way.  This can provide an order of\nmagnitude more tests automatically, but care has to be taken.  For\nexample, the number of actual tests run is D^P where D is the number of\ndata points and P is the number of parameters on any given theory.  This\ncan generate a lot of tests quickly, and the &quot;runDiscretely&quot; option I\nhacked together for theories would definitely not be a preferable.\n\nI now know that assumptions are filtering devices for theories, so it\ndoes not mark the test as failed.  Essentially, the reason that an\nassumption is marked as passing for the theory is that the assumption\nsuccessfully filtered out that data combination.  I get that now, but I\nprobably will use that feature very sparingly.\n\nThe question I have is what problem was the reason parameterized tests\nsupposed to solve, and how is that different than the problem that\ntheories are supposed to solve?\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
