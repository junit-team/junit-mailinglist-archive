They&#39;re great and thanks for help, that rea=\r\nlly\nresolved most of my questions I had in mind about crap4j.\n\nJust in case=\r\n if you&#39;re still on a look out for a &#39;Screen recording\nSoftware&#39;, I know a =\r\nopen source tool which is a really good one. you\ncan try it yourself...\n\nht=\r\ntp://sourceforge.net/projects/camstudio/\n\nThanks and Regards.\nkumar.\n\n--- I=\r\nn junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;albsavoia&quot; &lt;albsavoia@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In juni=\r\nt@yahoogroups.com, &quot;edu_kumar&quot; &lt;sarat.beesa@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I tried downlo=\r\nading it on my eclipse workspace couple of days back and\n&gt; &gt; had a trail ru=\r\nn against Commons Collection API. It did showed a\n&gt; &gt; beautiful report with=\r\n all the metrics in place, but I couldn&#39;t figure\n&gt; &gt; out what they actually=\r\n meant. Is there a documentation available on\n&gt; &gt; how to understand these m=\r\netrics ? I tried pondering around in your web\n&gt; &gt; site but ended up finding=\r\n some blog posts rather than any\n&gt; &gt; documentation....  \n&gt; \n&gt; Hi Edu,\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nI posted a 6 minute video on YouTube that shows the basic usage of\nCrap4J.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; The video quality is rather crappy (how appropriate) but hopefully the=\r\n\n&gt; basic idea comes across:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) Run Crap4J.\n&gt; 2) See which method are c=\r\nonsidered CRAPpy (due to an bad combination\n&gt; of complexity and lack of tes=\r\nts).\n&gt; 3) Cut the CRAP in those methods by a) adding tests or b) refactorin=\r\ng\n&gt; overly complex methods.\n&gt; \n&gt; I am exploring options for higher-resoluti=\r\non video, but in the\n&gt; meantime you might want to check out this first atte=\r\nmpt.\n&gt; \n&gt; Here&#39;s the link to the YouTube video:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://youtube.com/wat=\r\nch?v=3DbV6IhUh0IH4\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; \n&gt; Alberto\n&gt;\n\n\n\n",
