But the building operation is under teh control of another team. So i jut want to test it locally on my local projects.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the best way is to use ant task. Is there more sample pages on the internet i can inspect. The reason of my question was : I am unfamiliar with ant. But I think it is the right time to learn it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have also said that we are using SOA architecture. So it makes unit testing harder for me. Because i was unable to get the coverage with emma. Years years ago an underlying architecture was build and we are still using it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs an example: We have method like listBankElemnts() and is registred as BANK_LIST_ELEMENTS service.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the underlying mechanism calls listBankElements method when ve call BANK_LIST_ELEMENTS with a refernce call mechanism. So emma can not cover listBankElemnts method. And this causes a very very low coverage. Is there a possibility that we can also not get the list of metods within our html report that were called by the SOA service names?<br/>\n<br/>\nYours.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n�brahim DEM�R<br/>\njdbc_tr group moderator<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ibrahimdemir.wordpress.com\">http://ibrahimdemir.wordpress.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?
