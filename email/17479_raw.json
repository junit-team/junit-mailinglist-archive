Please suggest that your GUI developer take a deep breath\n&gt; and think relaxing thoughts. You could also suggest that they try\n&gt; chanting &quot;google is my friend&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Point: Does JUnit have a GUI Development IDE?. With Drag and Drop\n&gt; &gt; features?.\n&gt;\n&gt; No.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; That&#39;s why I said I am plying with netBeans and/or Java Studio 8. By the\n&gt; &gt; way Java Studio 8 is built on netBeans. netBeans do have the Graphical\n&gt; &gt; Drag and Drop Features to Build the GUIs Soon, than by laying out the\n&gt; &gt; interface by hand.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I will be glad if he can tell me how to do this in Junit (point above).\n&gt; &gt; I can then forget netBeans or anything else.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; -Kumar&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Joel Altman\n&gt; &gt; Shuttle Training Aircraft Project\n&gt;\n&gt; Your GUI developer needs a different tool than JUnit for their GUI\n&gt; testing. I don&#39;t write GUI&#39;s, so I can&#39;t help in any way other than\n&gt; suggesting that the good folks at google may be of help.\n\n\nI do write GUI and don&#39;t understand the question your developer is asking.\nHe seems to be confusing GUI builders with testing. Has he he written a\nsimple unit test for some non GUI dialog?\n\nOn the subject of Unit testing the GUI are we talking about a web based app\n(try Fitnesse (sp?) or some other acceptance testing mechanism) or a rich\nclient application (in which case start reading Micheal Feathers &quot;The Humble\nDialog&quot;).\n\nCheers\nMark\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
