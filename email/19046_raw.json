I&#39;m having to give a presentation of JUnit in\n=\r\nmore than a week. The focus is the new features in version 4.\nNevertheless,=\r\n I think I will want to have 1 - 3 beginning slides\nbriefly introducing the=\r\n tool which consist of the following information:\n\n- General Introduction.\n=\r\n- Historical, current and (possibly) future development.\n\nCould anyone poin=\r\nt me some source for the second point? (how, when, on\nwhat circumstance the=\r\n tool originated? How has it evolved so far?\nWhat&#39;s the current state? What=\r\n&#39;s the big roadmap picture? Its plan for\nfuture development? Which future d=\r\nirection would it take? What are the\nmost critical features that will proba=\r\nbly be added (or needed) in the\nnext release?...). Answers to such question=\r\ns would be highly appreciated.\n\nThanks,\nDavid.\n\n\n",
