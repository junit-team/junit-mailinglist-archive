You know that only one of them failed (maybe a setUp or another\ntest=\r\n) and all the other ones are failing in cascade.\n\nAnd you also know that yo=\r\nu probably only need to fix *1* test to come back\nto &quot;101 SUCCESSES&quot;.\n\nNow,=\r\n wouldn&#39;t it be nice if the testing framework told you exactly *which*\ntest=\r\n you should look at first?\n\n&gt; 100 failures, and when I look at the stack tr=\r\nace it&#39;s \n&gt; immediately clear where the problem actually is.\n\nYou shouldn&#39;t=\r\n have to look at a stack trace, the testing framework should\ntell you right=\r\n away which of the 101 FAILURES is the &quot;real&quot; one.\n\n&gt; &gt; Compare this to &quot;1 =\r\nFAILURE, 100 SKIPS&quot;.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Now, *that* is a much more acurate view of wha=\r\nt really happened.\n&gt; \n&gt; As I said, setUp and test method are one in my view=\r\n of a test results.\n&gt; But that may be due to I&#39;m used to JUnit&#39;s way of han=\r\ndling this.\n\nThat&#39;s also my impression.  Just trying to shake out your perc=\r\neption :-)\n\n&gt; So, assuming I don&#39;t check in code with non-green tests, why =\r\n\n&gt; is it important to distinguish between skipped and failed tests?\n&gt; Doesn=\r\n&#39;t a skip turn the bar red?\n\nWith TestNG, they are yellow :-)\n\nIt&#39;s importa=\r\nnt to distinguish between SKIPPED and FAILED because it gives\nyou a list of=\r\n tests to look at in the right order.  TestNG lists them as\nfollows:\n\n- Fai=\r\nled tests (red)\n- Skipped tests (yellow)\n- Passed tests (green)\n\nStar fixin=\r\ng the failed tests and when you are done, it&#39;s quite likely that\nthe skippe=\r\nd tests will pass and you&#39;ll be done.\n\n-- \nC=E9dric\nhttp://beust.com/testng=\r\n\n\n\n\n",
