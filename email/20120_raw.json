JUnit 4.4 does include method annotations\n&gt; in the Description, whic=\r\nh should help one of your frustrations.\n\nI&#39;ll take a look at the annotation=\r\n. Thanks for the pointer.\nUnfortunately, I&#39;m stuck with JUnit 4.3.1.\n\n&gt; Wer=\r\ne you using the default JUnit that ships with Eclipse (currently\n4.3.1)?\n\nY=\r\nep, I&#39;m using JUnit 4.3.1 that comes with Eclipse.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; It sounds like you=\r\n also wanted to allow users to register a listener\n&gt; regardless of how the =\r\ntests were run, which TestNG does with a\n&gt; command-line parameter, and JUni=\r\nt currently does not support.  This\n&gt; sounds like a valuable feature--is a =\r\ncommand-line parameter the ideal\n&gt; way to do it?\n\nA command-line parameter =\r\nwould be very helpful. I&#39;m currently limited\nby Eclipse&#39;s JUnit plug-in (Te=\r\nstNG Eclipse plug-in allows me to\nspecify listeners.) It would be nice to s=\r\nomehow register a listener\nprogramatically (not sure if this is a good idea=\r\n.)\n\n&gt; \n&gt; The default runners for JUnit classes should be out of &quot;internal&quot;\n=\r\n&gt; status soon.  \n\nThat would be really nice and helpful.\n\n&gt; We focused firs=\r\nt on making it possible to run any\n&gt; conceivable set of tests from JUnit, e=\r\nspecially crazy stuff (such as\n&gt; Ruby tests: http://johlrogge.wordpress.com=\r\n/2007/09/08/hybrid-theory/).\n&gt;  A major focus of 4.5 is making it easier to=\r\n make finer-grained\n&gt; extensions to JUnit&#39;s built-in runners, without touch=\r\ning internals.\n&gt; \n&gt; One more favor--can you explain how FEST currently was =\r\ncapturing\n&gt; screenshots from JUnit, and why that didn&#39;t work when running t=\r\nests\n&gt; from Eclipse?\n\nCurrently, we are taking screenshots (using AWT Robot=\r\n) by extending\nAnt&#39;s JUnit report task. We started to extend JUnit itself b=\r\necause a\nuser (of FEST) needed to take screenshots when a test executed ins=\r\nide\nEclipse fails. I&#39;m not saying that extending JUnit didn&#39;t work, it was\n=\r\njust frustrating. I made uncomfortable to depend on internal APIs and\ndepre=\r\ncaded code.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks again,\n&gt; \n&gt;    David Saff\n&gt; \n&gt; On Nov 19, 2007 12:=\r\n52 PM, Alex Ruiz &lt;alruiz15@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Greetings,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; This past wee=\r\nkend I tried to extend JUnit 4 and it was a very\n&gt; &gt; frustrating experience=\r\n.
