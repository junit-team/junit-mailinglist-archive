If you think of\nit as &quot;of course I don&#39;t mean _all_ my tests--that almost always takes\ntoo long: run only the ones that are interesting right now&quot;, which can\nalso be valid for non-unit tests, this will feel more like a hack.\n\nIn Christian&#39;s case, I can imagine:\n\n@Test public void onlineStuffHappens() {\n   assumeTrue(online());\n   doOnlineStuff();\n}\n\nI like this, because it seems to make clear that my test is only valid\nin certain situations, whereas an annotation might mean a validity\ncondition, or a simple categorization--the intent is not as clear.\n\nThere&#39;s also the possibility of:\n\nassumeTrue(weHaveLotsOfTime());\n\nassumeThat(&quot;database&quot;, isRunnableCategory());\n\nIn these cases, however, the assumption metaphor feels more like a\nhack--we&#39;re not saying that the test would fail if we\ndidntHaveLotsOfTime, just that we don&#39;t want it to run.  In that case,\nyou could imagine wrapping it in a descriptive method name:\n\nonlyRunIf(weHaveLotsOfTime());\n\nOr something like that.\n\n   David Saff\n\nOn 7/3/07, Christian Nelson &lt;cnelson@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; I have a feeling I&#39;m about to bring up a much discussed topic,\n&gt; however, I wasn&#39;t able to find any related topics by searching this\n&gt; mailing list.  My apologies in advance if this has been hashed out before.\n&gt;\n&gt; While generally thinking that its not a great idea, I occasionally\n&gt; come into a situation where I genuinely need to partition my tests\n&gt; into more than one group or partition or suite.  The latest example is\n&gt; with a client who has many unit style tests as well as a number of\n&gt; tests which require specific network connectivity only available from\n&gt; a subset of machines (the outgoing requests must come from a specific\n&gt; ip address).  We call these the &quot;online tests&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; We want to be able to group our tests into two groups, &quot;unit tests&quot;\n&gt; and &quot;online tests&quot;.  In some case we want to run only &quot;unit tests&quot; or\n&gt; only &quot;online tests&quot;, and in other cases we want to run both (or all).\n&gt;\n&gt; I understand that this functionality is available using JUnit 4&#39;s\n&gt; @RunWith(Suite.class) and @SuiteClasses(TestClass1.class, ...).\n&gt; However, manually adding test classes to a suite is clunky because the\n&gt; list of  test classes becomes huge.  It&#39;s also error prone; it&#39;s easy\n&gt; for developers to write a test but forget to add it to @SuiteClass.\n&gt; Lastly, test runners will run test in suites multiple times when told\n&gt; to &quot;run all tests&quot;.  That&#39;s hardly the desired behavior.\n&gt;\n&gt; What I really would like to see is the concept of suite (or group in\n&gt; TestNG terms) be promoted to a first class citizen.  Honestly, I think\n&gt;  I would prefer it to be at the test class level (unlike TestNG which\n&gt; is at the test method level), since the mechanism should be used for\n&gt; high-level organization IMHO.\n&gt;\n&gt; Is there any chance something like this might make its way into JUnit?\n&gt; What can I do to help?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Christian\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
