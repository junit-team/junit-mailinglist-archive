On the<br/>\nother hand, elaborating structure can also illuminate the darkness and<br/>\nfocus attention on where to make things fast.<br/>\n<br/>\nI myself wouldn&#39;t avoid defining a method to make things clear. I might<br/>\nthen wind it back in /if and when/ a performance measurement showed it was<br/>\nnecessary.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy experience is that a huge percentage of the tight code we write just<br/>\nbecause it&#39;s more efficient is wasted effort. My practice is to write clear<br/>\ncode, and then optimize it where it needs it, reducing clarity if I must.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The August 2003 issue of the Communications of the ACM focuses on program<br/>\n&gt; compaction and has a lead article &quot;Extracting Library-based Java<br/>\n&gt; Applications&quot;.  This concerns software developed by IBM researchers to<br/>\n&gt; reduce the size of Java code.  One of their tools minimizes the length of<br/>\n&gt; names where possible (it&#39;s not possible where a name is part of a<br/>\n&gt; published interface).  Using this and other techniques they typically<br/>\n&gt; shrink Java code by well over 50% for a small one-time cost in terms of<br/>\n&gt; computer cycles (it takes about 4 minutes to process 3.8 MB of code on an<br/>\n&gt; 800 MHz PC).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I can see how some Java systems might increase the size of the code by<br/>\nincluding non-public names, but it seems somewhat of a bug to do so as a<br/>\nmatter of course.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf short names were really valuable, I might write with readable names and<br/>\nthen precompile the software down to short names. We once did that with a<br/>\nwhole operating system, although our purpose was obfuscation, not<br/>\nefficiency.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; There is a reasonably reliable relationship between code size and<br/>\n&gt; speed.  Less than half as many bytes typically means software that<br/>\n&gt; runs more than twice as fast.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is news to me, and I can think of counterexamples, such as unrolling<br/>\nloops, or hard-coding table lookups, which typically increases both size<br/>\nand speed. Have you some references regarding the speed/size relationship<br/>\nand how it varies?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; There seems to be some disagreement, far less specific, around how<br/>\n&gt;&gt; many that might be.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; I suspect that there&#39;s some sharing and learning that might help<br/>\n&gt;&gt; someone learn something. One way to do that would be to present a<br/>\n&gt;&gt; little code that one thinks is down to minimum comments, and see what<br/>\n&gt;&gt; others can do with it to make it need fewer.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Sure, but bear in mind the cost of using long names and an expanded<br/>\n&gt; class hierarchy to replace comments.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m not saying it should be forbidden.  I do it myself all the time.<br/>\n&gt; But nothing is black and white; there are always tradeoffs.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes. I suspect that I think the tradeoffs favor clear code more than you<br/>\ndo, but that could be because I don&#39;t work on the same kind of code.<br/>\nConceivably, I might have a few different tricks.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; However, if you are suggesting that documentation should always and in all<br/>\n&gt; ways be minimal, I have to disagree outright.  Someone using software<br/>\n&gt; should not have to refer to the code to understand how it works.  On the<br/>\n&gt; contrary: there are strong arguments for never looking beyond the<br/>\n&gt; Javadocs.  If that sort of documentation is missing or is unreliable, the<br/>\n&gt; cost of using software soars.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Javadocs to understand HOW it works? I wouldn&#39;t think so. What it does, how<br/>\nto use it, yes. But how?<br/>\n<br/>\nIn any case, unless you mean we should produce more documentation than we<br/>\nneed, I think we must agree on &quot;minimal&quot; but perhaps not on just what<br/>\n&quot;minimal&quot; means.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Is this relevant to testing?  Yes it is.  Where code is underdocumented,<br/>\n&gt; the poor guy who inherits it often must resort to exploratory testing,<br/>\n&gt; to understand what the code actually does.  This is extremely expensive,<br/>\n&gt; a waste of programmer time.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes. And when code is well-tested, the tests serve as compilable,<br/>\nexecutable commentary. They can&#39;t replace all comments, but they can do a<br/>\nbetter job than other comments. Or so it seems to me ...<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards,<br/>\n<br/>\nRon Jeffries<br/>\nwww.XProgramming.com<br/>\nA firkin is 9 imperial gallons, or 40.905 liters, or<br/>\n81.81 half-liter cans, allowing for 5.8 cans per day over two weeks.<br/>\nTherefore, a firkin per fortnight is a six-pack per day.</div>",
