I always drive. The difference\n&gt;  &gt; is that I write tests to try out my design decisions as I go. Did you\n&gt;  &gt; expect it to be any different?\n&gt; \n&gt; That&#39;s reasonable, Joe, and also how I do it, but I was commenting on this\n&gt; quote:\n&gt; \n&gt; I think, when doing TDD the main benefit is not to find bugs it is to guide\n&gt; your design.\n&gt; \n&gt; ... which strikes me as questionable.\n&gt; \n&gt; I would also point out that the term &quot;Test-Driven Design&quot; strongly seems to\n&gt; imply that your tests drive your design. Which is what I was objecting\n&gt; against, and also why I much prefer calling it &quot;Test-Driven Development&quot;\n&gt; (and I still think that it&#39;s something you should do whenever you can but\n&gt; you certainly don&#39;t need to do it 100% of the time to obtain well-tested\n&gt; code).\n\nI /do/ believe that I benefit more from TDD as a design activity than \nTDD as a testing activity. The tests are a pleasant side-effect of being \nable to evaluate my microdesign as I write tests to drive it.\n\nFor macrodesign, of course, I use CRC cards as well as talking to \npeople. I find that I used to do not enough of that, and I do more of it \nnow.\n\nTake care.\n-- \nJ. B.
