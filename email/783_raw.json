(I use this class to run all the unit\n&gt;tests in my project). This is rather annoying, and I read somewhere that\n&gt;there is a tool for automatically creating test suites, rather than\n&gt;maintaining a class like this by hand. As I remember, it was a case of\n&gt;pointing this tool at your classpath and it would go away and find all your\n&gt;test classes and create a suite for them. Does such a tool exist? Can anyone\n&gt;tell me where I can get it?
