    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1109686496\">Mike, this is such a great topic you&#39;ve stumbled on.  Where I work, we are doing lots of hiring this year.  Every development engineer candidate that comes in gets to do at least two programming problems on the board.  For one of the problems, the question is something like, &quot;Write a function in any language you want (except Perl) to do XXX.&quot;  And then once they have that, we ask them to tell us how they&#39;d unit test what they just wrote.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a rare individual that says, &quot;Damn, now I realize I should have written the unit test FIRST!&quot;  And out of probably 100 candidates in the past few years of this approach, not a single candidate has ever actually written a JUnit/NUnit/whatever test case first.  But I hold out hope that person will someday grace our interview room.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\nTodd.<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>] On Behalf Of Mike Forsberg<br/>\nSent: Monday, May 03, 2010 10:24 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [junit] When it matters most, don&#39;t forget your tests.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you to all those that responded.<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree that if a candidate spends all their time on the simple error cases<br/>\nthen they don&#39;t understand TDD.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think a pair programming environment would be ideal for an interview.<br/>\nMaybe actually have the candidate solve an actual problem you&#39;re solving.<br/>\nThis may sound like it may take a lot of time, but I&#39;d rather be part of a<br/>\nteam that can spend 1-2 hours writing code in an interview, then waste that<br/>\ntime on soft silks.  If the candidate complains that it&#39;s not their<br/>\nIDE/editor of choice, that should send up a flag. Granted this is my ideal<br/>\nenvironment.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat about a 2 stage interview? One where they write the tests for a already<br/>\nexisting piece of code (maybe to increase the codes functionality), then<br/>\nanother where they try and write code to get the tests to pass.  Granted<br/>\nthis is not testing if they actually use TDD, but it would show if they have<br/>\nthe skill.  Maybe forcing the iteration process of test -&gt; functionality -&gt;<br/>\ntest -&gt; functionality will show if they have the skill.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think spending some time, 2-3 hours with a machine, later in the interview<br/>\nprocess, say after a phone screen, maybe second round of face to face, might<br/>\npay dividends in the quality of people on a team.  Then again it might<br/>\ndepend on how skilled you need this individual to be.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the input,<br/>\n<br/>\nBig Mike<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!
