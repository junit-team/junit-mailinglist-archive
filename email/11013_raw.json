While I agree with a lot of the\n&gt; JUnit philosophy, I  have one major concern with it.  Perhaps there\n&gt; are articles out there that address this, but I can&#39;t find any of\n&gt; them.\n&gt; \n&gt; As I look into JUnit, it seems that each class either has to do one\n&gt; of the following:\n&gt; \n&gt;       extend TestCase\n&gt;       implement Test. \n&gt;       extend some other class that implements Test. \n&gt; \n&gt; As we all know, Java doesn&#39;t support multiple inheritance.  You can\n&gt; only extend TestCase or you business class, but not both.  If you\n&gt; want to use JUnit with a derived class, it seems you have to\n&gt; implement a lot of methods from the TestCase interface -- which\n&gt; isn&#39;t practical.\n&gt; \n&gt; What are some of the ways people use JUnit to test classes that are\n&gt; derived classes?   Are there splinter projects that address this\n&gt; deficiency?  Or is JUnit a poor fit for derived classes?\n\nPut simply, what you propose to do goes entirely against JUnit&#39;s \nphilosophy, as well as the more general testing philosophies of the \nxUnit family of testing frameworks. Tests are tests and production code \nis production code.\n\nWhy do you want a production class also to be a test? I think it&#39;s \ngenerally a very bad idea.\n\nThis brings up something I am struggling with: in C#/NUnit, we can \ndeclare a test without extending TestCase (even if we frequently extend \nAssert, anyway). Is there some great benefit to this over the way we do \nit in JUnit, SUnit, RubyUnit, PyUnit, ...?\n-- \nJ. B.
