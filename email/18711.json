But, in the spirit of our mythical <br/>\nprogrammer who writes her code and then presses the &#39;Generate Tests&#39; <br/>\nbutton; it would not be unlikely for the entire package to have 5000 <br/>\ntests generated. This is great - we want lots of tests - provided we <br/>\ndon&#39;t have to go through all the passing tests to see which are <br/>\ncorrectly testing invalid code. Clearly she is going to do incremental <br/>\nbuild and test, but all those tests have to be looked at eventually. <br/>\nThat is why I proposed the guidance to tell the test generator &#39;I don&#39;t <br/>\ncare what I actually wrote, this is what the code is supposed to do.&#39; <br/>\nWith the inclusion of that kind of guidance, the 100% testing with zero <br/>\n(programmer) effort may be possible.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt; This fits well with the notion that testing is about<br/>\n &gt; good design.<br/>\n &gt;<br/>\n &gt; Good design is easy to validate by the developer.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>On an academic note, are you sure that &quot;good design is easy to <br/>\nvalidate&quot;?  I&#39;ve certainly been in some animated discussions in which it <br/>\nwas hard to reach agreement :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nJim<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJames P.
