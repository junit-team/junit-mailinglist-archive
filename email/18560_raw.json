The point here is building an entire set of test framework for testing this server would require tremendeous efforts and time. Which even if I achieve would not be that worthy as\n&gt;\n&gt; 1. It would always have static lines around it.\n&gt; 2. Productive result Vs. Man hour consumed would be very less.\n&gt;\n&gt; So can you suggest me any other way to nail down the problem.\n\nWhat about stubbing out the JNI interface? Instead of testing a system\nthat makes JNI calls, test a system where the JNI-invoking layer is\nreplaced with some kind of a mock object. Would that be a more\nfeasible approach?\n\nLasse\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n___________________________________________________________ \nNow you can scan emails quickly with a reading pane. Get the new Yahoo!
