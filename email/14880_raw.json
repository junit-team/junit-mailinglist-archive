I&#39;d prefer to be able to write a &quot;text output stream&quot; without\n&gt; &gt; having to jump through hoops to separate one line from the next\n&gt; &gt; in my text strings. Similarly I&#39;d like to be able to read &quot;lines&quot;\n&gt; &gt; from a &quot;text file&quot; without having to dither about how those lines\n&gt; &gt; are separated.\n&gt;\n&gt; You can in fact do that. Use XML, or use some other library that\n&gt; recognizes &#92;r, &#92;n, and &#92;r&#92;n as legal line breaks. BufferedReader does this.\n\nNice hack. \n\nIt occurs to me that I have no idea what Java does when it reads\nfrom files which are not just bytestreams (ie, are record-structured). \nOh well, another TODO for my copious free time.\n\n&gt; However, you are incorrect in believing that automatically using some\n&gt; &quot;platform default&quot; will give you what you want.\n\nFortunately, I don&#39;t have such a belief, despite my reckless optimism.\n\n&gt; It won&#39;t. Files and data\n&gt; are not to tied to platforms. In 2005 anything that is tied to platforms\n&gt; is guaranteed to fail. (OK, maybe not anything, but most things.) Just\n&gt; because your code is running on Windows does not guarantee that the line\n&gt; breaks in every file you read will be &#92;r&#92;n. Just because you&#39;re not on\n&gt; Windows doesn&#39;t mean they won&#39;t be.\n\nIt&#39;s easy enough to cope with line boundaries when reading (modulo\nconcerns about fancy file formats that the OS may have). The\noriginal niggle was what to do about them when /writing/, if one\nwants to generate text output in the local preferred convention\nand to have literal strings with line-separators in them. \n\n-- \nChris &quot;electric hedgehog&quot; Dollin\nThe software engineer&#39;s song: &quot;who knows where the time goes&quot;.\n\n\n",
