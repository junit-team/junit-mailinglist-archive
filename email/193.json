Has anyone<br/>\nseen this? Do I have something setup wrong?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve also seen this for rename class. I did one rename of a class and<br/>\nit worked, but when I tried this on the second class it was dimmed<br/>\nout. I tried reloading the UML and creating a new UML dwg. I<br/>\ntried rebuilding the app, but I still cannot do this operation.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m using JBuilder4, JDK 1.3, and JRefactory 2.5.38.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf there is another list that is more appropriate for this message,<br/>\nplease<br/>\nsend me a note and I repost elsewhere.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPCM (Paul Michali)<br/>\n<br/>\nCarrier Voice Gateway Business Unit (CVGBU)<br/>\nCisco Systems, Inc.<br/>\n250 Apollo Drive<br/>\nChelmsford, MA 01824<br/>\n<br/>\nPhone : (800) 572-6771 x 45817  (978) 244-5817 [direct]<br/>\nPaging: (800) 365-4578 [voice]  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pcm@...\">pcm@...</a> [email page]</div>",
