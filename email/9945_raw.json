As long as it is Java, it can run in any JVM. One of the future releases of MockEJB will provide the ability to write mock implementation class for CMP beans (the one that container generates) and implement mock finders and getters/setters. \nThe bigger problem, however, is the dependency on the database. Relational databases are not very conducive to the TDD spirit as they can&#39;t be modularized very easily. It does not make sense to go into great length to get rid of the dependency on the container just to run into the same problem with the database. Of course, one way is not to use the database and &quot;mock&quot; all data in the code, but that does not always work on the complex data structures or may require a lot of effort.\n\n\nAlexander\nhttp://www.mockejb.org\nEJBs made easy\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: J.
