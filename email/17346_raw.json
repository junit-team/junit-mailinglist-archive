We plan to revamp those classes for an \nupcoming 4.x release, and, for that reason, have discouraged clients \nfrom depending on the current implementation.\n\nYours is a good use case to drive this API--could you post a feature \nrequest at SourceForge, so we can track it better?  Thanks,\n\n    David Saff\n\nMichael Schechter wrote:\n&gt; I am looking to add the following functionality to my tests:\n&gt; - When provided a list of method names on the command line, only those\n&gt; methods in the invoked class will be executed.\n&gt;\n&gt; I need this implementation at the test class level. This was pretty\n&gt; straightforward with JUnit 3.8.1 - just create new instances of the\n&gt; derived TestCase with the method name as the argument, and add them to\n&gt; the suite.\n&gt;\n&gt; I am having a lot of difficulty trying to replicate this\n&gt; functionality. The filter logic appears to be a one-shot exclusion\n&gt; filter (everything not matching is dropped), and I can&#39;t seem to find\n&gt; any documentation that would address this.\n&gt;\n&gt; As Mr. Rainsberger and others have suggested, I have searched the web\n&gt; for an appropriate tutorial. I have found a number of good basic\n&gt; tutorials (including some references in this group), and a couple with\n&gt; some advanced content. I cannot seem to find one with the detail to\n&gt; unlock the tools and capabilities that I am positive are available\n&gt; within the new JUnit framework. \n&gt;\n&gt; I am also convinced that no one is as capable as the authors in\n&gt; documenting the features of the framework, and I am having trouble\n&gt; find Javadoc for some of the classes and APIs in the JUnit 4.1 tree.\n&gt; There is a fairly good chance that I am looking in the wrong place.\n&gt;\n&gt; If anyone has any suggestions or guidance on these issues, it would be\n&gt; greatly appreciated.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks in advance!\n&gt;\n&gt; Michael Schechter\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo!
