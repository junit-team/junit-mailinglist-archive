The =\r\nproblem I see is the lack of automated and repeatable testing as it is prov=\r\nided by unit test frameworks like JUnit and TestNG.  If I ask in interviews=\r\n about testing there is very seldom someone who does not know about JUnit. =\r\n But there is a surprisingly high percentage of companies that actually do =\r\nnot require the developer to write repeatable tests.  And that amazes me al=\r\nl the time.\r\n\r\n=20\r\n\r\nIf you test your code, why don=E2=80=99t you want to make it repeatable?\r\n\r\n=20\r\n\r\nAndreas\r\n\r\n=20\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\n\r\nFrom: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of C=\r\n=C3=A9dric Beust ?=20\r\nSent: Wednesday, August 02, 2006 8:23 PM\r\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\r\nSubject: Re: [junit] Re: Are you really using JUnit during your developmen=\r\nt?\r\n\r\n=20\r\n\r\nOn 8/2/06, Michael Feathers &lt;mfeathers@... &lt;mailto:mfeathers%40=\r\nmindspring.com&gt; &gt; wrote:\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; C=C3=A9dric Beust =E2=99=94 wrote:\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; &gt;\r\n&gt; &gt;You seem to imply that there are only two kinds of code:\r\n&gt; &gt;\r\n&gt; &gt; - Code that is tested and works\r\n&gt; &gt; - Code that is not tested and doesn&#39;t work\r\n&gt; &gt;\r\n&gt; &gt;There is actually something in the middle: it&#39;s called &quot;Code that is no=\r\nt\r\n&gt; &gt;tested but that works&quot;.\r\n&gt; &gt;\r\n&gt; &gt;\r\n&gt; How do you know? ;-)\r\n\r\nBecause a lot of software companies are still in business and I know for a\r\nfact they don&#39;t do a lot of testing :-)\r\n\r\n--=20\r\nC=C3=A9dric\r\nhttp://testng.org &lt;http://testng.org&gt;=20\r\n\r\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\r\n\r\n=20\r\n\r\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n\n\n",
