This could mean forgetting to add a test case when a new java file is\n&gt; added, forgetting to add a test method when a new method was added, etc...\n&gt; \n&gt; Does anyone know of any utilities that can check for test coverage. This\n&gt; could be a simple as an Ant task or maybe a more complicated plug-in for\n&gt; JUnit or even a stand alone utility. Any ideas? I&#39;d like to not re-invent\n&gt; the wheel if something like this exists already.\n\nIf your test class naming conventions mirror your class naming \nconventions *strictly* (ie, Foo has TestFoo, Bar has TestBar, etc, and \nFoo.bar() has TestFoo.test_bar(), etc), you can probably write some \nsimple unix shell scripts to look for clases and methods which are \nmissing tests.  &#39;find . -name *.java | xargs grep foo&#39; is a profoundly \nuseful tool.  As are sort and uniq and sed and the whole maze of little \nUnix shell utilities.  If you aren&#39;t familiar with these tools, now&#39;s \nyour chance to learn! (and if you&#39;re stuck with Windows, install CygWin, \nwhich gives you much of the command-line power of Unix).\n\n-- \n\nDavid Stagner\n\nNational Marrow Donor Program\n3001 Broadway Street NE\nBroadway Ridge Suite 500\nMinneapolis, MN  55413\n\nEmail: dstagner@...\n\n\n\n",
