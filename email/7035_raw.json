Currently\n&gt; some of these tests fail with the\n&gt;     [junit] Problem creating\n&gt; javax.swing.plaf.metal.MetalLookAndFeel with method\n&gt; getMenuTextFont and args { : java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException\n&gt; error and some of them I have &quot;fixed&quot; to catch that error and not fail.\n&gt;\n&gt; I like neither of these solutions. I would like to catch the error and\n&gt; throw an &quot;inconclusive&quot;-error to the JUnit framework because conceptually\n&gt; these tests have neither passed, nor found any problem.\n\nWhoa -- what you have described is the essence of the distinction between an\nerror and a failure.  An error is a test that does not pass because of an\nunexpected problem, like a screwed up environment.  I think your errors are\nlegit and you shouldn&#39;t treat them as failures.  They&#39;re legit because they\nsignal a problem with the test harness environment.\n\n&gt; The alterative solution would be to just have two set of tests, one that\n&gt; are runnable without the window system and one that is not and run them\n&gt; both when a window system is available and just the one of them when it\n&gt; is not but this is a lot more complicated since we then risk to forget\n&gt; running some of the tests some of the times.\n\nWhat if you solve the environment problem by either using JDK 1.4, which\nsupports AWT in a windowless environment (may require a runtime setting --\nsee the JDK docs), or install Xvfb (X virtual frame buffer) to emulate a\nrunning X server?  You may have Xvfb installed already.  If not, it can\neasily be found via Google.\n\nScott Stirling\n\n\n\n",
