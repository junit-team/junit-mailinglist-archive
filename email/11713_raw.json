These private methods only keep adding to the\n&gt; arraylist which is finally returned by the public method. I need to\n&gt; write a JUNIT for this class specifically the private methods of this\n&gt; class. Since these methods are void, how do I write JUNIT test cases\n&gt; for them???\n\nYou have two problems:\n\n1. The methods you want to test return no value.\n2. The methods you want to test are not public.\n\nI write about both problems in _JUnit Recipes_, which you can find \nonline at www.manning.com/rainsberger\n\nIf you prefer to work it out more for yourself, then try using JUnitX to \nsolve problem #2. As for problem #1, your method needs to have some kind \nof visible side effect--something you can determine by passing an object \nin to the method (or the object that contains it). If you can identify \nthat, then you can make assertions on that.\n\nTake care.\n-- \nJ. B.
