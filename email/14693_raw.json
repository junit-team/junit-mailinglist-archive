I fear that it would be a \n&gt;redevelopment as we\n&gt;have to write TestCase classes for all the existing classes( Units ).Is  \n&gt;redevelopment\n&gt;of the application with the test driven development approach would be \n&gt;the best solution or\n&gt;we can implement the JUnit test cases for already exsisting application \n&gt;?
