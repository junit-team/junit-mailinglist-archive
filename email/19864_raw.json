I understand =\r\n\nyou are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; currently doing this as an exercise, so it&#39;s healthy to take=\r\n \nit to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; extremes and do everything by the book in order to learn, \nbu=\r\nt in your\n&gt; &gt; &gt; real work, use your judgment and decide for yourself when \n=\r\nyou are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; indeed writing too much code, in which case it&#39;s probably \nsa=\r\nfer to go\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the usual route (get your code to work, then write tests fo=\r\nr \nit).\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The downside of TDD is that you can end up writing a lo=\r\nt of \ntests for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; business code that you quickly throw away and rewrite=\r\n, so \nthe amount\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of churn can be quite high.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I disagree=\r\n. When I&#39;ve found something difficult to write test \nfirst\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve always =\r\ndone a spike, then delete the code and rewrote it \ntest\n&gt; &gt; first. I&#39;ve alw=\r\nays found the result to be a lot more cleaner,\n&gt; &gt; especially since I wind =\r\nup cleaning up the code anyway when I \nused to\n&gt; &gt; write tests around them.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;d rather have my business code tested rather than not test it \nu=\r\nnder\n&gt; &gt; the assumption it will one day be thrown away. ;)\n&gt; \n&gt; Well, I nev=\r\ner suggested not writing tests, I was just saying that\n&gt; sometimes, it&#39;s ok=\r\nay to write your tests once you&#39;re done with the\n&gt; business code.\n&gt; \n&gt; Here=\r\n is a scenario I&#39;ve seen happen fairly often:\n&gt; \n&gt; Write test1\n&gt; Write code=\r\n1\n&gt; Write test2\n&gt; Write code2\n&gt; \n&gt; Then a refactoring comes to mind and you=\r\n realize you don&#39;t need \ncode1\n&gt; and code2 any more, so you write code3, an=\r\nd suddenly, you find\n&gt; yourself having to refactor (or throw away) both tes=\r\nt1 and test2.\n&gt; \n&gt; I was simply suggesting that sometimes, the following fl=\r\now works \nbetter:\n&gt; \n&gt; Write code1\n&gt; Write code2\n&gt; &lt;realize a refactoring i=\r\ns possible&gt;\n&gt; Refactor code1/code2 into code3\n&gt; &lt;happy with the result, now=\r\n we write the test&gt;\n&gt; Write test3\n&gt; \n&gt; Net result: two less tests to write.=\r\n\n\nSometimes that sequence ends there and sometimes it becomes:\n\nWrite code1=\r\n\nWrite code2\n&lt;realize a refactoring is possible&gt;\nRefactor code1/code2 into =\r\ncode3\n&lt;happy with the result, now we write the test&gt;\nWrite test3\nShit.
