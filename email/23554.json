It seems that since NB has built-in JUnit support (i.e. Run File), I<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t need to have an associated Main class under the Test Packages.<br/>\n&gt; True or false?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>True. Nearly every testing and building tool out there finds all tests <br/>\nautomatically.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 2. If I do decide to use a Main class as my test harness for my JUnit<br/>\n&gt; classes, I assume I have to declare an instance of the test class. True<br/>\n&gt; or false?<br/>\n &gt;<br/>\n&gt; 3. Furthermore, if I were to instantiate the test class and run it under<br/>\n&gt; my Main, wouldn&#39;t I basically have to make a call to each test* method<br/>\n&gt; explicitly? It seems like &quot;Run File&quot; does that for me.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>In the main method you would use <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://junit.sourceforge.net/javadoc/org/junit/runner/JUnitCore.html\">http://junit.sourceforge.net/javadoc/org/junit/runner/JUnitCore.html</a> and <br/>\ngive it a list of all test classes (or suites which contain the test <br/>\nclasses). JUnit will create the test class instances itself (actually <br/>\nonce per test method) and call the test methods.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 4. I was able to just do &quot;Run File&quot; on AngleTest.java and it ran for me<br/>\n&gt; in a split screen window at the bottom of NB. Kind of cool - gives me<br/>\n&gt; pass/fail and TTE (time to execute) stats. I noticed, however, that<br/>\n&gt; everything failed because JUnit by default puts in some boilerplate<br/>\n&gt; lines of code:<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It&#39;s NetBeans (or whichever tool you used) that generates the <br/>\nboilerplate, not JUnit.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 5. Am I supposed to go ahead and customize the values and/or code in the<br/>\n&gt; auto-generated test methods to test what I want? What&#39;s the better<br/>\n&gt; approach: Add more code for more test cases inside the method, or keep<br/>\n&gt; changing the existing code and re-running it until I&#39;m satisfied with<br/>\n&gt; the test results?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The best approach would be to write all tests manually. That way you can <br/>\nwrite meaningful tests which describe the features of the system. See <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blog.orfjackal.net/2010/02/three-styles-of-naming-tests.html\">http://blog.orfjackal.net/2010/02/three-styles-of-naming-tests.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 6. If I deliberately set the result and expResult to be two different<br/>\n&gt; things and also remove the call to fail(), will assertEquals() take care<br/>\n&gt; of raising a flag saying, &quot;Hey dummy, your results didn&#39;t match!&quot;?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Try it. (The answer should be yes.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 7. What happens if I set a value for the angle in degrees and make a<br/>\n&gt; call to something like setDegrees(value)? How can that even fail anyway<br/>\n&gt; (i.e. what&#39;s the point of having the test method)?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It won&#39;t fail. There is no point in testing things such as trivial <br/>\nsetters/getters (and language features such as the `new` operator). <br/>\nThose will be tested indirectly when you write tests for features which <br/>\nuse them. Write tests for (all) things which could possibly fail.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 8. If I just remove the auto-generated calls to fail() as the comment<br/>\n&gt; suggests, then how am I going to know if my test is failing or not?<br/>\n&gt; Essentially what I&#39;m seeing is that I can rig the test however I want,<br/>\n&gt; which is not entirely what I&#39;d like to happen.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>To find out whether a test works, modify the production code so that it <br/>\nhas a bug in the feature which is being tested by the test. Good tests <br/>\nfail: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.agitar.com/downloads/TheWayOfTestivus.pdf\">http://www.agitar.com/downloads/TheWayOfTestivus.pdf</a><br/>\n<br/>\nAn even better way is to write the tests before the production code. <br/>\nFirst the test will fail because the system doesn&#39;t yet do the thing <br/>\nwhich is specified by the test. Write code until the test passes. Remove <br/>\nduplication and fix bad names <br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.jbrains.ca/permalink/the-four-elements-of-simple-design)\">http://www.jbrains.ca/permalink/the-four-elements-of-simple-design)</a>. <br/>\nRepeat.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is a tutorial to get started: <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/orfjackal/tdd-tetris-tutorial\">https://github.com/orfjackal/tdd-tetris-tutorial</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; P.S.
