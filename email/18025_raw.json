That will\nhelps us verify that correct JMS APIs are called] . Refactor message\nprocessing logic into a seperate class  and test it as a POJO\n\nIntegration Testing  : Using Cactus, Original JMS implementation to Test\nfor right messages  at the right queue.\n\nIs this approach Right? Am I missing something here? What are the other\nthings I should look for in Testing a Message Driven Application?\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n\n\n",
