B. Rainsberger&quot; &lt;jbr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; I have found that I don&#39;t want interfaces when I work with Ruby or\n&gt;&gt; Smalltalk: I like the idea that handling methods has nothing to do\n&gt;&gt; with type.\n&gt;\n&gt;Having learned my OO skills in Java, the idea of a weakly-typed OO\n&gt;language (as I understand Smalltalk to be) doesn&#39;t make sense.  \n\nIf we call it &quot;optimistically typed&quot;, would that help your mental\nmodel? The idea is that the system assumes that the programmer will\nonly send messages to objects that understand them, and raise an\nexception when that doesn&#39;t happen.\n\nI find it unlikely that I intentionally send a message to an object\nthat doesn&#39;t understand it. That only seems to happen when I try to use\nthird-party libraries that I don&#39;t understand yet, and that&#39;s why I\nwrite Learning Tests. (See the testdrivendevelopment list for details.)\n\n&gt;As in I\n&gt;don&#39;t understand what that would mean, or how it could work at all.\nDo\n&gt;you know of some helpful material, perhaps targeted at &quot;Java\ndevelopers\n&gt;wanting perspective&quot;, or correct me if I&#39;m mistaken?\n\nI don&#39;t. Instead, I simply went to the Squeak Smalltalk home page,\ndownloaded Squeak and played around with it. Try Googling &quot;Smalltalk\nfor Java programmers&quot;.\n\nTake care.\n\nJ. B.
