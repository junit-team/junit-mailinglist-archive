Could you do a little asking around?\n\nI have spoken with Kent and we have talked about what would be in the \nnext release of JUnit. I have 3.8.2 right now, and I don&#39;t know whether \nit&#39;s been released to the public -- the most visible change is better \nhighlighting of the differences between unequal strings. :)\n\nExpected: ab[c]def, but was: ab[dr]def\n\nThe difference is in the brackets.\n\nOpening the kimono, Kent invited me to be involved in JUnit 3.8.x and \nJUnit 4.0, then asked me to do some code review for him, and I haven&#39;t \ndone it, mostly due to low motivation. For this reason I&#39;m not too hard \non them for keeping things under wraps: if I were really so intent on \nbeing involved, then I would do what they ask me to do, but since I \ndidn&#39;t, I don&#39;t complain. :)\n\n&gt; Failing that, perhaps this group could decide what it really wanted\n&gt; and then make the changes and release a 3.8.2? I mean, it&#39;s not like\n&gt; we don&#39;t have some of the finest testing brains on the planet around\n&gt; here (self _not_ included), not to mention some very strong opinions\n&gt; (ok, I&#39;m in this category). Just a wild Friday afternoon kind of\n&gt; thought.\n\nI strongly believe that even some of the best minds in this community \ndon&#39;t share the core philosophy of maintaining a small, closed \nframework. For that reason, I&#39;m not too keen on &quot;opening it up&quot;. I don&#39;t \nreally trust myself with that, except for the fact that I&#39;ve never \nactually asked for an addition to JUnit. I just think more people need \nto use the JUnit-addons test runner. That would satisfy quite a few of \nthem. :)\n-- \nJ. B.
