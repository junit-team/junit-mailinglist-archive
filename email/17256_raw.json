As\nmentioned in the JUnit Pocket Guide, writing runners is a surprising rare\nbut useful technique. A simple way to do this is to pass your own TestResult\nas a parameter to you test suite:\n \n...Test suite= ...\nTestResult result= new TestResult() {\n  protected void run(final TestCase test) {\n    // do whatever you want to do here\n  }\n};\nsuite.run(result);\nreturn result;\n \nI hope this helps.\n \nCheers,\n \nKent Beck\nThree Rivers Institute\n\n\n  _____  \n\nFrom: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of\nStephen Smith\nSent: Monday, July 31, 2006 10:32 AM\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: Re: [junit] Re: Filtering by method in JUnit 3.8-style tests\n\n\n\nSetting aside JUnit 4.x temporarily, is there any way using the JUnit \n3.8.x API I can filter out particular test methods based upon a set of \ncriteria, without resorting to implementing a suite() method on each \nindividual TestCase?\n\nThanks,\n\nSteve.\n--\nStephen Smith, MEng (Wales).\nhttp://www.stephen- &lt;http://www.stephen-smith.co.uk/&gt; smith.co.uk/\n\nMichael Schechter wrote:\n&gt; That&#39;s odd - it works just fine for me. However, trying to filter on\n&gt; more than one method doesn&#39;t seem to be intuitively obvious, and\n&gt; nothing really seems to work.\n&gt; \n&gt; The code I use to get one test to run is as follows (it&#39;s from the\n&gt; test class&#39;s main() method):\n&gt; JUnitCore core = new JUnitCore();\n&gt; Request testRequest = Request.method(aTestClass, someArguments[0]);\n&gt; core.run(testRequest);\n&gt; \n&gt; I have no idea how to extend this model to being able to specify\n&gt; multiple methods, however.\n&gt; \n&gt; In addition, I really hope that someone starts documenting all of the\n&gt; nifty new features in JUnit 4.x - the current level is somewhat\n&gt; (frustratingly) incomplete. The basic features have been covered by a\n&gt; number of writers - the more complex, such as this issue, still seem\n&gt; to be missing.\n&gt; \n&gt; I think JUnit has the potential to become even more popular with a\n&gt; clearer examination of the framework on which it is built. There seems\n&gt; to be a great deal of power and flexibility available - it&#39;s just\n&gt; really unclear as to how to get at it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks in advance!\n&gt; \n&gt; Michael Schechter\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In junit@yahoogroups. &lt;mailto:junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt; com, David Saff\n&lt;saff@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; Shannon,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; You are right--this doesn&#39;t currently work in JUnit 4.1.

I create and run the test like this:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Request r = Request.method(OldStyleTestCase.class, &quot;testSomeMethod&quot;);\n&gt;&gt;&gt; jcore.run(r);\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; The outcome is that all test methods are run, not just the one test\n&gt;&gt;&gt; method I specified. I also tried using a custom filter, but the filter\n&gt;&gt;&gt; never gets called because the runner for this class is\n&gt;&gt;&gt; org.junit.internal.runners.OldTestClassRunner which does not implement\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Filter.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Do I need to write my own runner to get this to work? Is there another\n&gt;&gt;&gt; work around?\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks for any help.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; /Shannon\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
