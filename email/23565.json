Typically, assertions performed from outside the context of the main test thread are meaningless since any failures/exceptions that occur go unnoticed by the main test thread. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe solution involves setting up some shared state where failures are reported back to the main thread, then thrown, so that tests either pass or fail as expected. To make this a bit easier I created a simple JUnit extension, called ConcurrentUnit, which I wanted to share with the group: <br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/jhalterman/concurrentunit\">https://github.com/jhalterman/concurrentunit</a> <br/>\n<br/>\nFeedback is welcome and I hope that this is of some use to other JUnit users. <br/>\n<br/>\nCheers, <br/>\nJonathan</div>",
