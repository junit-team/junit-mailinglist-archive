Particularly in the area of visibility.. many developers assume \n&gt;&gt;that no written agreement can be sufficient if something is made \n&gt;&gt;public.  I think that the issue is that we are not used to thinking \n&gt;&gt;about agreements beyond the code and we&#39;re not used to holding people to \n&gt;&gt;them.\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;An agreement might work. I&#39;ve never seen anyone try one. Instead what \n&gt;I&#39;ve seen is the developers issue pronouncements from on high about how \n&gt;users must use their software and APIs, and then be appalled when users \n&gt;ignore them. Actually sitting down and invoking the users in the design, \n&gt;and getting their explicit buy-in would be an interesting exercise. Hmm, \n&gt;you know I have seen that and I have even done that, but only with a \n&gt;small subset of the user base. For a project with a large user base, I \n&gt;don&#39;t think you could ever expect meaningful discussion and agreement \n&gt;with each individual user.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nWell, there&#39;s the Eclipse process and that seems to be working.  If a \nnew version of Eclipse comes out and your plugin breaks because you \nignored the rules of engagement, it&#39;s your responsibility, and that \nhappens.  The thing that Eclipse did do, however, is build a community \nwith enough large successes to keep the project viable despite the \nsmaller failures.\n\n&gt;Now I&#39;m not objecting to pronouncements, mind you. I&#39;m a very \n&gt;patriarchical designer in my own APIs, and I make lots of pronouncements \n&gt;from on high. However I don&#39;t delude myself that the users have somehow \n&gt;agreed to this. That&#39;s why I enforce the pronouncements in code.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nAnd it&#39;s that sort of patriarchical design that I feel is pretty much \ninappropriate these days.  None of us are omniscient.  And, in fact, \nmany of of us didn&#39;t see that people might want to write tests for code \nthat uses our APIs eventually, for instance. \n\nI&#39;m sympathetic to patriarchical design because I know that it is fun.  \nDesign is all about constraints, and one of the cool things about \nsoftware is that in much of our work we don&#39;t have terribly tight \nconstraints on the form of our solutions.  If we did, the industry&#39;s \ncode might look better.  The cool thing about API design is that it is \nan area which offers or seems to offer tight constraints: &quot;you have to \nget the API exactly right the first time or else!&quot;  It&#39;s a rush when we \nget that all right, but I think it&#39;s important to distinguish between \nwhat a problem really requires and our desire to solve hard problems.\n\nMichael Feathers\nwww.objectmentor.com\n\n",
