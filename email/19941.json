E.G. I have a few Fortune Cookies that are stored in an array of <br/>\n&gt; Strings. I&#39;ve written some code that returns them randomly. <br/>\n&gt; What is the best method for testing? i.e. should I be using Mocks?<br/>\n&gt; If anybody has any good examples or relevant web sites please let me <br/>\n&gt; know.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sam,<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen faced with a question like this, I always ask, &quot;What are you trying <br/>\nto test?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAre you trying to test your randomness algorithm or trying to test that <br/>\nyou can return a fortune given an index and that index happens to be random.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy best advice is to split the problem in half. Don&#39;t try to test <br/>\nreturning a random fortune. Test that, given a sequence of fortunes, you <br/>\ncan return the next one when asked. In your test system, you can set up <br/>\na known sequence of fortunes, and in your real system, you can set up a <br/>\nrandom sequence. Hide the sequence generation behind an interface and <br/>\nyou can mock it for tests, and use real randomness in production.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope this makes sense :) If not, ask away again.<br/>\n<br/>\nbab<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nBrian Button\t\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:brian.button@...\">brian.button@...</a><br/>\nVP Engineering\t\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.asolutions.com\">http://www.asolutions.com</a><br/>\nAsynchrony Solutions\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://oneagilecoder.asolutions.com\">http://oneagilecoder.asolutions.com</a><br/>\nSt. Louis, MO\t\t636.399.3146<br/>\n<br/>\nExtreme Programming in St Louis - <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/xpstl\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/xpstl</a></div>",
