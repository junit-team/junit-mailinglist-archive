In this case it was because the underlying<br/>\nlistener didn&#39;t have any test code for it.<br/>\n3) Implement (2) and check the fix (1).<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve chosen this because my current fault *didn&#39;t* have any test code for<br/>\n(2) and when added - I only got a green bar!?  So closer inspection of (1) I<br/>\nnoted that I was actually wrapping a number of DocumentListeners to get the<br/>\neffect I desired - unfortunately I was add them in the wrong order.  So<br/>\nwhilst (1) on its own would have worked, I like (2) as well because the<br/>\nlistener can be used in a number of different ways and (1) only tests a<br/>\nspecific usage.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you<br/>\n<br/>\nJonathan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 07 June 2004 15:00, I wrote: <br/>\n&gt; A while ago I started looking at using one of the frameworks available for<br/>\n&gt; testing UI code <br/>\n&lt;snip/&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Now I come to the validation process and I have received a number of <br/>\n&gt; bugs to fix (no big deal) but my question is how much should I drive <br/>\n&gt; my bug fixing? Normally (prior to abbot) I&#39;d dig about my code to locate <br/>\n&gt; the appropriate code, create a test case (or cases) to highlight the bug <br/>\n&gt; and drive the fix appropriately.  Now I have a UI fault that is easy to <br/>\n&gt; reproduce - and I&#39;ve created a test case using abbot to highlight the<br/>\nfault, <br/>\n&gt; and can now dig through the code and fix it... but... this fault (as with <br/>\n&gt; a couple of other UI faults) resolves down to a failing implementation of <br/>\n&gt; some DocumentListener logic.  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So should I (would you) keep TDD the fix via the high level UI test case, <br/>\n&gt; or drill down and write &quot;lower&quot; level test cases for the DocumentListener<br/>\n&gt; implementation. </span></blockquote></div>",
