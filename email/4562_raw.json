Many\n&gt;interesting points and suggestions have been raised over this issue,\n&gt;however, they belong to a Testing&Design discussion, not a Unit Testing\n&gt;discussion.\n\nI&#39;m not sure how you can separate the two discussions. Could you tell me how \nUnit Testing can be discussed without discussing its impact on design?\n\n&gt;In the light of Unit Testing, if people want to unit test private\n&gt;methods, so be it.\n&lt;snip /&gt;\n\nNobody is saying, &quot;Thou shalt not test private methods.&quot; But bear in mind \nthat JUnit was not built for that purpose. Not only that, its creators feel \n(well Kent, anyway; I don&#39;t know how Erich feels) that one of the strengths \nof JUnit is that when the tests become painful to write, there is a tendency \nfor the design to have an organic weakness that prevents the testing. As \nKent says in this case, it&#39;s an opportunity to learn about your design.\n\nIf you are going to say, &quot;Take your testing/design discussions elsewhere,&quot; I \ncould easily reply with, &quot;Take your testing-private-methods discussion \nelsewhere -- JUnit doesn&#39;t do it.&quot; Of course, that is NOT what I am doing. I \nwould prefer to have both discussions than neither.\n\nThere are other test frameworks that provide support, or will provide \nsupport, for testing private methods. JUnit does not. I hope it never does. \nThat&#39;s a personal opinion. If it did, then I would be tempted to use it and \nall of a sudden design is tougher than it needs to be, because one of my \nfavorite tools no longer forces me to think.\n\n&gt;The JUnit documentation could point out some of the\n&gt;issues and uses of Unit Tests and how they help with the overall design\n&gt;of a system (they may already do so, but its been a while since I last\n&gt;looked), but the tool is for Unit Testing, and as such, should allow\n&gt;people to use it as they will, so long as they know what they are up to.\n\nIt&#39;s all in how you define &quot;unit&quot;. To me, it&#39;s the exported methods of a \nclass or interface. Kent and Erich may define it differently. Clearly, you \ndefine it differently. Over the last few years the emphasis appears always \nto have been on testing observable behavior -- you can look it up. By \ndefinition, private methods do not provide directly observable behavior, and \nare therefore out of JUnit&#39;s scope.\n\nYou folks can test private methods until your brain pops out, but just don&#39;t \nexpect JUnit to do it out of the box. It was never designed for that. It was \nnever designed for that *on purpose*. I don&#39;t know why that is such a big \ndeal. You don&#39;t like it, that&#39;s cool. Use something else, but don&#39;t mess up \nJUnit.\n\nJ. B.
