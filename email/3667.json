I feel part of the cost of <br/>\nmembership of any group is to listen and participate even if it is to only read other people&#39;s questions and thoughts.<br/>\nIf you don&#39;t feel like helping me, that is your decision and I respect that.  What I would ask of you is to limit<br/>\nthe frivolous chatter in this group that seems to fill my inbox including your pompous lectures that imply that you are <br/>\nsome kind of royalty so that replies that have useful content can get their due attention.<br/>\n<br/>\nlee<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n12/27/01 12:54:47 PM, &quot;J.

Well, we seem to have time<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; to respond to trivial subjects and partake<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; in what is nothing short of mental masturbation and ignore substantive<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; questions that require some effort.<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; I think I have read about 30 messages about getters and setters that<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; sounds more like a pissing contest.  And then there is the chatter<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; about one piece of spam.  How many worthless messages did this &quot;spam&quot;<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; generate?
