Adams schrieb:\n\n&gt; In other words, take some\n&gt; data that I&#39;m expecting, and put it in the DB, rather than actually\n&gt; &quot;generate&quot; the data. That way, I don&#39;t need the nightly job to be part\n&gt; of the testing cycle.\n\nWhen doing tests with parts of my software that need an underlying\ndatabase, I&#39;m always using HSQLDB that gets connected instead of\nthe real database being in use. That way you can fill in exactly\nwhat you want without the problem that e.g. a parallel running test\nis interfering.\n\n&gt; Then, all the tests could run independently, and not rely on each other,\n&gt; but I could also run them in order manually, to verify that the system\n&gt; actually works as a whole.\n\nThese are different types of tests and should exist in parallel.\nThe first gives you immediate feedback if you change something at\none specific part. The latter gives you feedback if the current\nchange has broken something somewhere else. Both are necessray.\nThe difference is that the single test should run very fast, allowing\nyou the check your changes over and over again to realize as soon\nas possible in the process that you broke something. The whole\ntest run can take longer.\n\nMy single tests always take only up to a couple of seconds (with\nfew exceptions) while the complete test including coverage-calculation\ntakes about one hour (without coverage 20 minutes).\n\n&gt; Then, I could actually have an &quot;OrderedTest&quot;\n&gt; that instantiates all my TestCase classes, and calls them in order. That\n&gt; in itself would then be it&#39;s own separate test.\n\nPersonally I don&#39;t like these kind of test-classes because I always\nforget to add a newly created one (but that be different from you,\nso this might be a practicable way).\n\n&gt; Does that sound like a good idea?\n\nIt&#39;s nothing I&#39;d do, but I don&#39;t have a system that is that much\n&quot;integrated&quot; that I need to do these kind of tests. So don&#39;t ask\nme about that. If it works for you, it&#39;s fine.\n\n&gt;&gt; If you abstracted the layer between your applicaiton and the messaging\n&gt;&gt; system you can simply define a mock that answers the requests for you.\n&gt;&gt; That way you don&#39;t need to setup anything in advance. I&#39;m doing this\n&gt;&gt; here e.g. for testing the parts of our software doing OFTP by ISDN.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes, that would be possible, but also a whole heck of a lot of extra\n&gt; work. It would probably double the code, perhaps even more. I was trying\n&gt; to keep my part of the application simple. :D\n\nDoesn&#39;t sound good, maybe you overestimate things a bit. I can\nrecommend reading the book &quot;Working effectively with legacy code&quot;\nby Michael C. Feathers. There are a couple of hints how to get\nthat kind of code you&#39;re talking about under test.\n\n&gt; Also, by doing this, I am still circumventing the testing that actually\n&gt; tests to see if the system actually works. And, I don&#39;t want to do that,\n&gt; as I want to be sure the system actually works, and not just my code.\n\nIf you make sure that your code works (and keeps working after\ndoing changes) you can track down problems occuring in the whole\nsystem much easier than without.\n\n&gt; I\n&gt; could do these little abstractions (with a factory, that has test and\n&gt; production configurations), and that would test my code, but it would\n&gt; not test that my code works with the other system, as I would end up\n&gt; having a &quot;fake&quot; layer, pretending to be their system, but never actually\n&gt; verifying.\n\nI had good results by using anonymous inner classes:\n\npublic void testSomething(){\n   final int[] channels = new int[]{2};\n   MyISDNHardware driver = new MyISDNHardware(){\n      public int getNumberOfBChannels(){\n          return channels[0];\n      }\n   }\n   // perform the tests that check if the behavior in dependence\n   // of the number of B-channels is correct\n}\n\nThat&#39;s one of the reasons I don&#39;t like singletons. It effectively\nprevents you from doing things like these.\n\n&gt;&gt; For this I see Ant or Maven a better fitting tool than JUnit. There\n&gt;&gt; you have dependencies and all the things you need for data-transfer,\n&gt;&gt; emailing, etc.\n&gt; \n&gt; I am using Maven, but maven isn&#39;t a testing tool. However, it does\n&gt; support JUnit.\n\nOf course it&#39;s not but you can use it to set up things and call\nthe Junit-tests in dependence of that.\n\n\nRegards, Lothar\n\n\n",
