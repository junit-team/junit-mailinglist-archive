Even in Sun&#39;s libraries, there are public classes\n&gt;&gt; and methods in com.sun packages, which per convention aren&#39;t\n&gt;&gt; *published*. If you use them, you do so at your own peril.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; And guess what? People use them, even though they aren&#39;t supposed to.\n\nAnd guess what? They might do so for good reasons, while being aware of the\nfact that what they do is rather fragile.\n\nI even access a private field in a thirdparty class once in a year, using\nreflection. I always do that because it&#39;s the best option available.\n\n&gt; Hell, I even wrote a book whose primary focus\n&gt; was on documenting, explaining, and teaching people to use the sun\n&gt; classes! \n\nYou hopefully warned them that they shouldn&#39;t blame Sun for not supporting\nthe API in the next version of the library.\n\n&gt; If gentlemen&#39;s agreements were sufficient to enforce constraints on\n&gt; usage, we never would have had to invent access protection in the\n&gt; first place.\n\nGuess what, Smalltakers live very well with &quot;private&quot; being not more than a\ncomment, for decades now.\n\n&gt; public == published in Java. I certainly wish it were\n&gt; otherwise, but sadly that&#39;s not the case.\n\nWith your reasoning it seems to me that even private == published in Java,\nbecause private doesn&#39;t hold me from accessing a member, if I really want\nto. Might just be me, though.\n\nCheers, Ilja\n\n\n",
