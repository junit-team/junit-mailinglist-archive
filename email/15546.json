We use Mock objects, so that helps,...but we don&#39;t use them everywhere.  We also utilize &quot;TestAll&quot; tests, so that helps get you to a scope somewhere between one and all.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe don&#39;t run into this often,...but it does happen, and I have asked myself &quot;Isn&#39;t there an easier way to find all the tests that might be affected by my change?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n-------------- Original message -------------- <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, didoss@c... wrote:<br/>\n&gt; My problem is usually along the lines of: I make changes to classA, <br/>\n&gt; which is used in classB, which is used in classC, which is tested by<br/>\n&gt; testC.  So, I have modified testA, which directly tests classA, but <br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t realize that I have broken something in testC.  My solution is<br/>\n&gt; that we run nightlybuilds, and I check the errors/failures the next <br/>\n&gt; morning to see if my code changes could have caused any of them.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It would be nice to be a little more proactive, though,...being able<br/>\n&gt; to (easily) find all the tests that are ultimately affected by my <br/>\n&gt; code change (iterating through the workspace references until I <br/>\n&gt; terminate at all classes that start with &quot;Test&quot;, or that are in my <br/>\n&gt; test branch).  I know that I can do this manually through Eclipse, <br/>\n&gt; but it is not fun - and therefore doesn&#39;t get done.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow long does it take to run all your tests? That would be the obvious<br/>\nfirst answer, I&#39;d suggest.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, if you try to make your tests only test a single unit, that<br/>\nhelps a lot - and using mock objects helps there (I use EasyMock<br/>\nmyself). It certainly doesn&#39;t solve the problem 100%, but it&#39;s a good<br/>\nstart.<br/>\n<br/>\nJon<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSPONSORED LINKS Basic programming language C programming language Computer programming languages <br/>\nThe c programming language C programming language List of programming languages <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYAHOO!
