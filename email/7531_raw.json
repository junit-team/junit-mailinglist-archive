That&#39;s just ridiculous. That is what is immature.\n\nIf you show a lack of maturity, it becomes infectious. That&#39;s human nature.\n\nIt&#39;s not about emotional involvement; it&#39;s about people making claims they have no business making that make us look bad. I just don&#39;t see why we should accept that.\n\nTake care.\n\n\nSo said Thali, Nilesh on 4/3/2003 --------------------\nOkay, can we desist from this immature mudslinging? I have no\nemotional ties to JUnit and TDD although I use it as far as possible\nto write better code - but if there&#39;s a complementary paradigm that\ncan help the code be better, I&#39;d like to hear about it; There are\nsome people who are constructively debating with &quot;javainsel&quot; and I&#39;d\nlike to hear that, without this kind of inane background noise.\nIf this does turn out to be an April fool&#39;s joke, I&#39;ve been truly had.\nbut DbC and JTest sound interesting to me.\nregards,\nNilesh\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Jason Rogers [mailto:jacaetevha@...]\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, April 03, 2003 8:49 AM\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: Re: [junit] JUnit considered problematic\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Okay, after continuing to read the list -- perhaps I was \n&gt; wrong.
