It may need a bit of tinkering - I&#39;m not very good in maven and ant.<br/>\n - Code injection via AspectJ could work well. Place a cutpoint on the method looping over the test again and again and measure the time before and after.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\n Georg<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;jfuerth&quot; &lt;jfuerth@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi everyone,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve created a custom Runner meant to help with performance and scalability testing. It lets you create tests like this:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; @RunWith(PerfRunner.class)<br/>\n&gt; public class MultiThreadUsageExampleTest {<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   @Test<br/>\n&gt;   public void demonstrationTest(<br/>\n&gt;       @Varying(from=1, to=10) int threadCount,<br/>\n&gt;       @Varying(from=100000, to=1000000, step=100000) int entryCount) {<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;       // code here that relies on threadCount and entryCount<br/>\n&gt;   }<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; }<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In the above example, my runner calls demonstrationTest() 100 times, with parameter values (1, 100000), (2, 100000), ... (1, 200000), ... (10, 1000000).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What I want to do now is produce charts of how long each call took. There are a lot of approaches, but I don&#39;t know which is &quot;right.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 1. Register a TestListener and write my own reports to disk from it (but is there a generic way to register listeners?)<br/>\n&gt; 2. Create my own main program that runs the test suite, and have it create the report when the suite is done (maybe this is the only way to register a TestListener anyhow?)<br/>\n&gt; 3. Transform the XML output of the ant junit task (but then it&#39;s bound to Ant)<br/>\n&gt; 4. Transform the XML output of the maven-surefure-plugin (but then it&#39;s bound to Maven)<br/>\n&gt; 5. Write performance results to disk directly from my TestRunner (should work in any environment, but feels like a dirty approach)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Other ideas are welcome too, of course. My test runner is open source and published on GitHub; I want a solution that can work for everyone. So I think ideas 3 and 4 are out.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Has anyone else thought about getting data from custom test runners into human-readable reports?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -Jonathan<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
