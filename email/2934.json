Of course,<br/>\nyou might have made a batch script to run all of your tests.<br/>\nBut JUnit already has those features(ie. TestSuites)! Why make<br/>\nsomething that&#39;s already available? The next good part is that<br/>\nall of this is easily done.<br/>\n<br/>\ncf. <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/unittests.html\">http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/unittests.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; For example if i want to write a testcase for an EJB i<br/>\n&gt; have to write a lookup initialisation function in <br/>\n&gt; setUp() method....and write a test case function for<br/>\n&gt; each test behaviour...right?<br/>\n&gt; This i can accomoplish using plain java class which<br/>\n&gt; can execute different user defined function!!!!<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You have to write a lookup initialisation sequence in your<br/>\noriginal test class also, wrong? I don&#39;t see why writing a<br/>\nsetUp() method would be a pain in the neck. All you have to<br/>\ndo is split your testing method into 3 pieces. (By this I<br/>\nmean setUp(), testXxx() and tearDown().)<br/>\n<br/>\nLet&#39;s say you wanted to test two methods in a certain class.<br/>\nAnd those methods shouldn&#39;t be called with the same instance.<br/>\nOf course, you can instance it twice, but if you do this in<br/>\nyour setUp(), you don&#39;t have to worry about those things.<br/>\nOn the contrary, if you want to test one method after the<br/>\nother has been executed, all you have to do is put them on<br/>\nthe same testing method.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck!<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nShinobu Kawai &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:skawai@...\">skawai@...</a>&gt;</div>",
