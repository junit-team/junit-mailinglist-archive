It&#39;s first use was for things like the &quot;run failed\ntests first&quot; functionality in Eclipse, but there are other meanings of\n&quot;specifying the order of tests&quot; that it doesn&#39;t handle.  Can you\ndescribe a little more about what you&#39;re trying to do?  Thanks,\n\n   David Saff\n\nOn 11/28/06, fedevela &lt;fvela@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hello,\n&gt;\n&gt; I decided to go with JUnit 4 instead of TestNG.\n&gt;\n&gt; However i do need to specify the order of the tests. Is this what the\n&gt; sorter and sortable classes are for?\n&gt;\n&gt; How do i get a handle on the order of the tests and/or on the\n&gt; comparison  of each tests?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thank you.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
