Hard to cure, but p=\r\nerfectly understandable :-)\n\nTo all, if you expect developers to use TDD in=\r\n their work, it makes perfect sense to ask them to demonstrate it in an int=\r\nerview. There are a wide range of TDD skills (working on TDD screencasts at=\r\n the moment continually reminds both how much I know and how very much I do=\r\nn&#39;t). If you are pressed for time, you might be able to get some good infor=\r\nmation by asking them to list the tests they would write for a given proble=\r\nm instead of actually coding.\n\nRegards,\n\nKent\n\nOn May 1, 2010, at 12:54 PM,=\r\n Dennis Lloyd Jr wrote:\n\n&gt; Hi Mike,\n&gt; I think it&#39;s interesting that under t=\r\nhe &quot;heat&quot; of an interview, TDD\n&gt; practices get dumped. The same seems to ha=\r\nppen to many developers under the\n&gt; heat of a challenging deadline. When I =\r\ninterviewed candidates in the past, I\n&gt; pay close attention to if they ment=\r\nion TDD or automated unit testing. If\n&gt; they don&#39;t mention it themselves, I=\r\n ask. That is because I believe it is one\n&gt; of most important (perhaps THE =\r\nmost important) development skills. I also\n&gt; ask a lot of questions regardi=\r\nng test case identification.\n&gt; \n&gt; It has been a long time since I was on an=\r\n interview which asked me to write\n&gt; code. However, the last interview I wa=\r\ns on, I was presented with a code\n&gt; sample and asked what was wrong with it=\r\n. It was a single function, spanning\n&gt; three printed pages, with a &quot;bug&quot; so=\r\nmewhere in it. I told the interviewer\n&gt; that the problem was there were no =\r\nunit tests, and the code was not clearly\n&gt; written - after fixing those two=\r\n things, the bug should be obvious.\n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s easy to forget these things d=\r\nuring an interview. Developer interviews\n&gt; that I have seen tend to focus o=\r\nn specific developer experiences, such as\n&gt; familiarity with specific langu=\r\nages or technologies, or knowledge of a\n&gt; certain domain. It is easy for th=\r\ne interviewer and candidate to get lost in\n&gt; these details and forget good =\r\npractices. I think this focus is generally a\n&gt; mistake. I think the focus s=\r\nhould be on demonstrating experience with good\n&gt; development practices, goo=\r\nd design, testing, well-written code, along with a\n&gt; desire to learn and gr=\r\now as a developer on a team.\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; Dennis\n&gt; \n&gt; On Sat, May 1, 2010=\r\n at 9:17 AM, Mike Forsberg &lt;bigmike.f@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; This=\r\n may be better in a blog post, which I will hopefully get to...\n&gt; &gt; but I&#39;d=\r\n like to pose two questions to the group first. Let&#39;s call it\n&gt; &gt; research.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve just completed a set of interviews and looking back on the co=\r\nding\n&gt; &gt; questions.

Would you ever\n&gt; &gt; suggest/remind a candidate of TDD style in his/=\r\nher code?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Second question, why on earth does a candidate, like myse=\r\nlf, forget to\n&gt; &gt; write tests and incrementally improve their code? Do this=\r\n show a lack\n&gt; &gt; of software development maturity?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; As a community r=\r\neminder, and to myself.... don&#39;t forget TDD style on\n&gt; &gt; interviews.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n[Non=\r\n-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
