I downloaded a copy of junit from an article on www.javaworld.com\n&gt; by Michael Nygard and Traci Karsjens entitled &quot;Test infect your\n&gt; Enterprise Java Beans&quot;. I&#39;ve tried going through the procedure for\n&gt; getting the test example working, but to no avail - the code compiles,\n&gt; packages and deploys fine, but when I enter the test suite class file\n&gt; name in the first servlet form and then hit enter, I get an internal\n&gt; server error, with a\n&gt; NoClassDefFoundError being thrown for class junit.framework.TestCase.\n&gt; Following the stack trace indicates that it gets thrown by the servlet\n&gt; when it&#39;s trying to load the test suite class: -\n&gt; \n&gt; package junit.servletui;\n&gt; ....\n&gt; public class TestRunner extends HttpServlet {\n&gt; ....\n&gt;   protected Test createTestSuite(...) {\n&gt;     ...\n&gt;     try {\n&gt;       testClass = Class.forName(classUnderTest); // Error here.\n&gt;     }...}...}\n&gt; \n&gt; Class.forName can find classUnderTest, but not TestCase, which it\n&gt; extends.\n&gt; \n&gt; The web application all seems to be packaged fine -\n&gt; junit.framework.TestCase is present in the .WAR file in WEB-INF/classes,\n&gt; the servlet engine just doesn&#39;t seem to be able to see it. \n&gt; \n&gt; I realise that this is possibly more of a question about web application\n&gt; deployment than junit itself, but any pointers would be appreciated.\n&gt; \n&gt; Jim Downing\n&gt; \n&gt; jimdowning@...\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
