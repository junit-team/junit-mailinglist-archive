But it&#39;s suffering to<br/>\nwrite JUnit cases. Because:<br/>\n1. I need to know the correct result from the other way around and sometimes<br/>\nit&#39;s hard to find another way. <br/>\n2. Database and JSP pages are difficult to JUnit test.<br/>\n3. Mock objects brings more than double efforts during the whole develop<br/>\nprocess.<br/>\n4. Exception situation is not so easy to make as JUnit claims.<br/>\n<br/>\n3 friends in 3 different companies (small size and middle size company)<br/>\ncomplain JUnit as:<br/>\n1. They planned JUnit testing firstly and they cannot keep it going. TIME<br/>\nreason?<br/>\n2. It consumes a lot of time but hard to find big problems. JUnit does find<br/>\nsmall problems as we expected.<br/>\n3. JUnit testing is not effcient enough.<br/>\n4. Best JUnit tester is the senior software developer. But senior guys hate<br/>\nto write test cases.<br/>\n5. For small company, it&#39;s really hard to choose between JUnit+develop and<br/>\ndevelop+functional testing.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs there anyone who is successful in deploying JUnit during develop as:<br/>\nJUnit + code + JUnit + code + System Testing? <br/>\n-- <br/>\nView this message in context: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nabble.com/Are-you-really-using-JUnit-during-your-development--tf2039307.html#a5612073\">http://www.nabble.com/Are-you-really-using-JUnit-during-your-development--tf2039307.html#a5612073</a><br/>\nSent from the JUnit - User forum at Nabble.com.</div>",
