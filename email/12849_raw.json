Those classes frequently have states\nor take actions that are difficult to test (sniffing packets, throwing\nexceptions).\n\nIn order to avoid this problem, you use a class that appears to your\nunit under test as though it is the tool it usually calls, but under\nthe covers you&#39;ve stripped out its functionality and replaced it with\nsomething you can test with.\n\nLet me assume that in your example, you pass in some kind of\nnetwork-access object in your constructor, which is then used by\nvarious methods.  You need to test what your code does when that\nnetwork object reports that it cannot contact any network at all. \nThis is a very difficult situation to simulate with the actual code.\n\nYou create (or if you&#39;re lucky, download) a class that subclasses your\nnetwork access object.  That class may be called\n&quot;AlwaysFailingMockNetworkAccessObject&quot;.  It is bone-stupid, and is in\nactuality not a network access object at all.  The only thing it does\nis fail when its access methods are called.\n\nSo in your test, you construct your class with this\nAlwaysFailingMockNetworkAccessObject, and then make your assertions\nabout your class&#39; behavior.\n\nAnother test might use a PlaybackMockNetworkAccessObject (another\nclass I made up).  This object might not contact a network at all, but\naccept in its constructor a set of data to return as though it came\nfrom a network.  Using this, you can write a set of assertions based\non a set of data.\n\nOne common first reaction to the Mock Objects approach is that &quot;It\ndoesn&#39;t *really* test the system&quot; since it doesn&#39;t involve some major\ncomponent.  This is when Unit Testers reply, &quot;It tests everything I&#39;m\nconcerned about -- I don&#39;t need to test the Network Access\nimplementation, it isn&#39;t my problem.&quot;  You&#39;ll also be doing an\nintegration test before you release.  This, however, is a unit test,\nand the Mock Objects approach helps you test just your unit.\n\nMake sense?  I think Mock Objects are fun.\n\n-Kevin Klinemeier\n\nOn Fri, 11 Feb 2005 09:18:16 +0200, Pico Geyer &lt;picog@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks you all for your replies.\n&gt; \n&gt; My first question has definitely been well answered, I&#39;ll experiment\n&gt; with the different methods of testing these private fields.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now on to the second question:\n&gt; \n&gt; Much of the programming that I do is network related. This includes\n&gt; passing messages from server to client and even implementing some\n&gt; firewall capabilities.\n&gt; \n&gt; Lets take the firewall api provided my Microsoft as an example:\n&gt; http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/rras/rr\n&gt; as/packet_filtering_functions.asp\n&gt; &lt;http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/rras/r\n&gt; ras/packet_filtering_functions.asp&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; If I implement a simple firewall application that say blocks all\n&gt; outgoing http traffic. It would be nice to apply the advantages of JUnit\n&gt; to this code also.\n&gt; \n&gt; Is this possible?\n&gt; \n&gt; If MockObjects are the answer, could somebody please give me a reference\n&gt; to some introductory material regarding this.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve done some reading on MockObjects but find all the material hard to\n&gt; understand and I&#39;m still failing to see how I&#39;m going to apply\n&gt; MockObjects to test my network methods.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks again.\n&gt; \n&gt; Pico\n\n",
