The class design<br/>\nsimply hasn&#39;t calmed down enough to move the classes out of &quot;internal&quot;<br/>\nand start making iron-clad promises to future extenders.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, if you&#39;re willing to be flexible, it&#39;s not that bad--the<br/>\nfinal published interface is likely to be very similar to what&#39;s in<br/>\nJUnit 4.4.  You want to extend JUnit4ClassRunner, and probably<br/>\noverride:<br/>\n<br/>\n- getTestMethods: to pick up @Integration methods as well as @Test methods<br/>\n- validate: so that a class with only @Integration methods doesn&#39;t get<br/>\nmarked as malformed<br/>\n- wrapMethod: to change method running behavior.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn wrapMethod, you&#39;ll want to conditionally return a subclass of<br/>\nTestMethod, with your behavior inserted.  It may be sufficient to<br/>\noverride TestMethod.isIgnored, based on your description.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo bump the discussion up a level, the support for assumptions in<br/>\nJUnit 4.4 was supposed to handle situations very similar to what<br/>\nyou&#39;re describing:<br/>\n<br/>\n@Test public void integrationWorks() {<br/>\n   assumeTrue(runningIntegrationTests());<br/>\n   // rest of test<br/>\n}<br/>\n<br/>\nThis test will stop at the first line unless runningIntegrationTests<br/>\nreturns true.  If this facility doesn&#39;t handle your need, please let<br/>\nus know, so that we can improve it in future releases.  Thanks,<br/>\n<br/>\n   David<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 8/14/07, Scott Zou &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:zou0s1@...\">zou0s1@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Hi,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; All I want to do is this: I want to mark some of my test methods with my<br/>\n&gt; own annotation (e.g. @integration) instead of @test.  Then when this test<br/>\n&gt; case runs, these methods will check something like an environment<br/>\n&gt; variable to determine whether it should run (like @test) or do nothing (like<br/>\n&gt; @ignore).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I figure I have to derive my own test runners to do this (@runWith<br/>\n&gt; (myTest.class)).  However, since JUnit4ClassRunner is internal and it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; not documented, where can I find instructions/documents on what and how<br/>\n&gt; to derive from it?  Or is there a better way to achieve what we need here?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
