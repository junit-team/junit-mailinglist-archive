But it doesn&#39;t look like I can use inheirit from Suite or Parent=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; Runner for example because they both are looking for a class.\n&gt;\n&gt; You =\r\ncan actually give pass Suite a null for the parent class, and then\n&gt; a list=\r\n of subclasses.\n\nRight, but given below then the subclasses have to be know=\r\nn at\ndiscovery time, right? Or can we simply have the class *name* at that\n=\r\ntime? IOTW, appropos below, do all classes also have to be loaded at\ndiscov=\r\nery time, or are we simply building an arbitrary tree for which\nthe actual =\r\ntest classes can be loaded and instantiated at runtime?\n\n&gt; &gt; But the trick\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; of course is that needs to be deferred until test run-time.\n&gt;\n&gt; Does th=\r\ne test discovery step _need_ to happen inside a test computation? Why?\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nI have a feeling we have a mismatch of assumptions.\n\nYes, or expectations. =\r\nMy dilemma is that it doesn&#39;t make sense for me\nto go through trying to put=\r\n this kind of harness together without\nknowing wether it is possible, but i=\r\nt&#39;s a lot to expect that someone\nwho would actually know wether it was poss=\r\nible would want to take the\ntime to understand what I&#39;m trying to do. :D So=\r\n the short answer is\nyes, I need or really really want this and I&#39;ve though=\r\nt it through\nquite a bit. The long answer...\n\nIn a way JUnit&#39;s raison d&#39;=EA=\r\ntre is the philosophy that one should\nspecify *a priori* and statically wha=\r\nt is expected and then check that\nthat indeed happens, right? So a lot of t=\r\nhe architecture quite\nunderstandably carries that simplifying assumption. B=\r\nUt.. it begins to\nget more confused as we add leverage through model-driven=\r\n / generative\ntechniques. I&#39;m working at a bit of a meta-level here -- ther=\r\ne are\ntests that ensure things like wether the classes are actually\ngenerat=\r\ned correctly and doing so with an arbitrary set of targets; but\nwe are *als=\r\no* actually generating the test code that exercises that\ntarget code. There=\r\n is an aspect to the code-gen process that gets\nswitched on and adds test a=\r\nnnotations, potentially in-line asserts and\nso on either by specializing th=\r\ne target code generated classes or by\ncreating proxies. I want the discover=\r\ny of test methods so that we\nensure coverage for newly generated model beha=\r\nviors and to ease\nmaintenance.\n\nNow, the only other way that I can think of=\r\n to do this is as a\ntwo-phased process. I might end up doing it this way ev=\r\nentually; I\ncould generate a list of class names and method names in a test=\r\n suite\ngeneration step and then actually run the tests in a follow on JUnit=\r\n\nprocess. So the answer to my question above is probably the real make\nor b=\r\nreak.\n\nNow that still isn&#39;t ideal but it would be workable. Setting up the\n=\r\nbuild for that would not be trivial but in principal its doable. But\nthat w=\r\nould still mean that in the test discovery step for the actual\ntests I will=\r\n *not* have access to the *actual* test classes or methods\nand it is suspec=\r\nt because it relies on inspection to make sure that\nthe generated list of m=\r\nethods and the actual methods actually match\nup. OTOH, in the original case=\r\n we are making assumptions that the\ngenerated tests actually are generated =\r\nat all so there will always be\na bit of a need for inspection there as well=\r\n. Interesting\nphilosophical issue I suppose.\n\n(BTW, Currently my setup work=\r\ns but because it al happens within a\nsingle Eclipse JUnit plugin test (and =\r\nthere is no simple way to chain\nthem) it ends up being a wicked boot-strapp=\r\ning problem; I have to load\nan older version of the tests that did work in =\r\norder to launch the\nplugin that will support building the new one&#39;s. So eve=\r\nrything works\ngreat until you have a test failure and then you have to manu=\r\nally\nrebuild the test environment.)\n\n",
