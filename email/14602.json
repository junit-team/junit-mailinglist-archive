Could you have several Fixture classes, one<br/>\n </span></blockquote>hierarchy per<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; interface hierarchy, and construct the appropriate fixtures in setUp()?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What I&#39;m already doing is creating a TestCases (or a hierarchy where<br/>\nappropriate) for each interface. These test cases are used directly as<br/>\nbase classes when I&#39;m testing a class implementing only one interface.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy problem is using delegation when I have to combine several of these<br/>\ntest cases. I understand what delegation is, and I know how to use it<br/>\nwith simple objects. But then again, JUnit fixtures still seem really<br/>\nmysterious to me :-).<br/>\n <br/>\nI can probably start with getting my head around Mikhail Shnayderman&#39;s<br/>\nanswer (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/junit/message/14534)\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/junit/message/14534)</a> and yours<br/>\nof course.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m going to &quot;do my homework&quot; now and try to come up with something as<br/>\neasy to use/understand as I can. I&#39;ll come back for advice on my solution.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the meantime, I have found a workaround thanks to Joe Rainsberger&#39;s<br/>\nanswer (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/junit/message/14535)\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/junit/message/14535)</a> and Jason<br/>\nTibbetts&#39; (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/junit/message/14549)\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/junit/message/14549)</a> bonus tip.<br/>\n<br/>\nI posted an answer to the latter containing a working code sample<br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/junit/message/14558)\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/junit/message/14558)</a>. However, after<br/>\ntrying it &quot;on the field&quot;, I chose to stick with Joe&#39;s simpler solution<br/>\nin order not to end up with possibly large test classes containing<br/>\nseveral &quot;interface-specific&quot; internal classes. <br/>\n<br/>\nModern IDE&#39;s make it easy to navigate in such files, but I tend to<br/>\nlike my files short and to avoid internal classes.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo be honest I had never thought about studying the internals of JUnit<br/>\nbefore I faced this problem. You guys made it so easy to write tests<br/>\nwithout knowing anything about how JUnit was implemented that I<br/>\nthought I would never have to :-) (damn I&#39;m lazy!).<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again for taking the time to answer my question and thank you<br/>\nand Erich Gamma for JUnit and your contributions to evolution of<br/>\nsoftware development!<br/>\n<br/>\nDimitri</div>",
