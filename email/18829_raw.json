Yes I&#39;ve been there and downloaded the zip and\n&gt; I just tried it again to check if I didn&#39;t oversee something. But in\n&gt; the zip file I find only the sources for examples and general tests\n&gt; for junit, but I do not find the sources of the Junit framework\n&gt; itself (like AssertEqual.java, TestRunner.java etc.)\n&gt;\n&gt; On the same homepage, I&#39;ve also &#39;cvs browsed&#39; the repository for\n&gt; sources. I can select sticky tags, but the names appearing have no\n&gt; link to anything 3.8.1...\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks for your help\n&gt;\n&gt; Markus\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;David Saff&quot; &lt;saff@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Markus,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Have you tried going to\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=15278\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; and clicking on &quot;Show older releases&quot;?

But they only contained the\n&gt; classes of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the library plus some sources to test, but I need the sources of\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; framework itself. I browsed the cvs source repository, however I\n&gt; saw\n&gt; &gt; &gt; some tags and branches and a set of other selection mainly for\n&gt; 4.0,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; but I did not find any hint how to get the 3.8.1. sources\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Would anybody know the precise cvs repository and password - or\n&gt; else\n&gt; &gt; &gt; send me sources to mbjava@...?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks a lot for help\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Markus\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yahoo!
