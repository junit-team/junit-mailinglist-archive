I haven&#39;t tried it out on any production\ncode, only simple classes, so I can&#39;t say yet if there&#39;s a win in using\nit over regular Java unit tests. The biggest downside is probably losing\nIDE refactoring support.\n\n \n\nIt seems like the Exception thing is an actual JRuby problem, but since\nit&#39;s a pretty extreme edge case I&#39;m sure those guys have more urgent\nthings to solve. A Java helper class that the rspec mocks can call to\ntrigger Exceptions may be a workaround, so you don&#39;t have to go through\nRuby&#39;s &quot;raise&quot; method.\n\n/ Per\n\n \n\n________________________________\n\nFrom: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of\nJoakim Ohlrogge\nSent: Monday, September 10, 2007 10:51 AM\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: [junit] [OT] Testing java with ruby\n\nWhen I had that done I just started thinking &quot;hey, why not test-drive\njava-code as well&quot;\nand that&#39;s about as far as I have come in that line of thoughts.\nWhat is your experience with testing java-code from RSpec? (you seem to\nhave\nthought\nsome more about it than me)\n\nI can see that some problems can emerge like the one you had with the\nexception-class thingy...\nIs it possible to just raise a Java exception (without rspec). In that\ncase\nI guess you could work around\nthe problem by specifying your own action for throwing java-exceptions.\nIf\nthe problem lies deeper\nwithing JRuby so that you can&#39;t even raise Java exceptions it becomes\nmore\ndifficult :)\n\n\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
