When I first started writing tests I had no \nclue what I was doing so my tests were messy and probably exceeded this \nlimit.  You only get really effective at writing tests after writing \nseveral thousand and I noticed the more I wrote, the less number of \nassertions I tended to use per test.\n\nAt the same time I am not going to disrespect tests that have numerous \nasserts.  I&#39;ll admit, 95% of my tests fall below the 3 assert level but \nthe remaining 5% probably soar well past it.  Why?  I do acceptance \ntesting in my Unit tests.  For everyone who just read that and cringed, \nhard cheese.  I&#39;m convinced the only reason people try to keep \nacceptance tests and unit tests separate is because they fear acceptance \ntesting will be too difficult to accomplish at a Unit test level.  Well \nit is not and if you choose an appropriate architecture (The Humble \nDialog for instance) you are well on your way.  What do you think \nFinesse is doing?  Its an acceptance testing tool with a Unit testing \nengine.  Try using Finesse if your architecture is whacked, I dare you!\n\nChappell, Simon P wrote:\n\n&gt;I had not previously realised that this was a hotly debated subject, but I can think of at least one example of a test that should have at least two assertion in it: the equals() method.\n&gt;\n&gt;According to the Java API, an .equals() method must be symmetric, so for a.equals(b) to be true, then b.equals(a) must also be true. This seems like something that would justify two asserts within a test.\n&gt;\n&gt;Also, what about edge-conditions? If a method has a number of interesting edge-conditions, then do each of those go in separate tests?\n&gt;\n&gt;Simon\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;-----Original Message-----\n&gt;&gt;From: Kris Henderson [mailto:khenderson@...]\n&gt;&gt;Sent: Thursday, November 20, 2003 1:17 PM\n&gt;&gt;To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;&gt;Subject: RE: [junit] Testing philosophy question\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;-----Original Message-----\n&gt;&gt;&gt;From: Chappell, Simon P [mailto:simon.chappell@...] \n&gt;&gt;&gt;Sent: Thursday, November 20, 2003 9:56 AM\n&gt;&gt;&gt;To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Subject: RE: [junit] Testing philosophy question\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;And, by one assertion, I hope you don&#39;t mean a maximum of one \n&gt;&gt;&gt;physical &quot;assertEquals&quot;!?\n&gt;&gt;&gt;      \n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;I think that&#39;s exactly what he means.  When I first started writing\n&gt;&gt;Junit tests I had many assertions in my test methods.  Lately, as I\n&gt;&gt;learn more about TDD, I&#39;ve been trying to limit my unit tests to only\n&gt;&gt;one assertion per test method.  I find that by having only one \n&gt;&gt;assertion\n&gt;&gt;per test method it keeps my tests much more focused and easier to\n&gt;&gt;understand.  Once I get more than 2 or 3 assertions in a test method I\n&gt;&gt;start to look at how I can split that one test up into 2 or more tests.\n&gt;&gt;Give it a try, you might find that you like it.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Kris\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;------------------------ Yahoo!
