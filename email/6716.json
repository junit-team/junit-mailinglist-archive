I can see how you&#39;d think that if you<br/>\nview/practice software development as an engineering activity.  I<br/>\ndon&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s also not very agile.  <br/>\n<br/>\n- Do TDD<br/>\n- Come up with a list of tests that nail down the behaviour you need<br/>\nto implement. <br/>\n- Write each test, then the code to pass it... one test at a time.<br/>\n- run a coverage tool against the running of your test suite to find<br/>\nholes in your test coverage.<br/>\n- fill in those holes as desired (do you really need to test<br/>\ntoString().. maybe.. maybe not)<br/>\n- run Jester to see if you have some sloppy tests (or redundant code)<br/>\n- fix as required.<br/>\n<br/>\nBetter to do it & measure the results than to try & figure it all out<br/>\nahead of time.<br/>\n<br/>\nDave</div>",
