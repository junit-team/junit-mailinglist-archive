B. Rainsberger [mailto:jbrains@...]\n&gt;\n&gt; Guys, when it gets to the point where you&#39;re arguing over\n&gt; definitions, stop. Definitions are arbitrary. You agree on the\n&gt; concepts. Relax.\n\nThe Java language only exists by virtue of its definition in the official\nlanguage specification.  Java&#39;s not very arbitrary.  I think it was\nappropriate to refer (and defer) to the spec.\n\nFor the inner vs. nested distinction though, I think it&#39;s an unfortunate and\ntoo subtle choice of words in the spec.  The distinction is exactly the sort\nof nit-picky thing that the Sun Java Programmer Certification exam looks for\nunderstanding of.\n\nFor the original question, I think the major reason for avoiding the nested\nstatic class on any significant size project is practicality (concrete\nseparation of concerns), e.g.:\n\n- Developers and QA may both be writing unit level tests, depending how the\nwork effort is partitioned (I&#39;ve worked on some medium sized projects where\nthis was the case).  In which case, you want the tests and classes under\ntest maintained in separate files, possibly separate packages (either for\naccess reasons or management or code ownership reasons), and possibly\nseparate directories and/or codebases.\n\n- Keeping tests in the same file as the class under test makes the file size\nlarger and more difficult to navigate, edit and maintain.\n\nMike Clark, Eric Vought and other had some other very good reasons along\nsimilar lines.\n\nScott Stirling\n\n\n\n",
