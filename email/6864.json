    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1660868018\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt; If your method does nothing to delegate to someone else, then testing<br/>\n&gt; your method is the same as testing the method to which the<br/>\n&gt; implementation delegates; therefore, test the delegate, and not the<br/>\n&gt; current method. The only thing that can break is an invalid (null)<br/>\n&gt; reference, and you&#39;ve probably testing for that somewhere else.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I followed that path until I was bitten some day: When delegating more than<br/>\none method - eg in a wrapper - I often code the delegation methods by typing<br/>\nin the first method, copying this method as often as needed and then renaming<br/>\nmethod names and delegation calls. Doing that without tests - and without a<br/>\npair coder - I introduced two nasty bugs... This becomes even more of an<br/>\nissue when the interface of both delegate and delegee grows, I let the IDE create<br/>\nthe method stub and evetually forget to fill in the method body. <br/>\n<br/>\nHas someone detected a fool-proof (Johannes-proof) way of writing delegation<br/>\ncode to prevent that kind of error? I guess delegation should part of the<br/>\nlanguage spec the same way implementation inheritance is. For instance, Ruby<br/>\ndoes that in a nice way.<br/>\n<br/>\nJohannes<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n+++ GMX - Mail, Messaging & more  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.gmx.net\">http://www.gmx.net</a> +++<br/>\nNEU: Mit GMX ins Internet.
