I&#39;m working on an\n    &gt;&gt; application, and I&#39;d like to avoid reinventing the wheel if\n    &gt;&gt; possible :)\n\n    Robert&gt; The lack of reflection makes it hard for a true port. I&#39;ve\n    Robert&gt; seen a couple of JUnit-like test tools that just didn&#39;t\n    Robert&gt; motivate me enough to use them. We use JUnit on a desktop\n    Robert&gt; for our unit tests and then verify we can build with\n    Robert&gt; bootclasspath set for a MIDP environment. That covers\n    Robert&gt; everything except the UI.\n\nI found the same thing that you did. We tried to run it as is, then we\ntried to take bits and pieces of it as they existed, and we ran into\nNoSuchClass errors everywhere :) And they mostly dealt with reflection\nstuff.\n\nThe ability to write our code according to JUnit and J2SE and then\njust build as you said would be great. I&#39;m just a novice at this J2ME\nMIDP stuff, but my pair partner is pretty experienced. He seems to\nbelieve that we&#39;ll have a problem following a model like this for the\nconnection and socket stuff, since the API is different. Have you\nencountered this?\n\nbab\n\n-- \nBrian Button            bbutton@...\nSenior Consultant       Object Mentor, Inc\nSt. Louis, MO\t\thttp://www.objectmentor.com\n\nExtreme Programming in St. Louis - http://groups.yahoo.com/group/xpstl\n\n",
