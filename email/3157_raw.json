My situation is the following:\n&gt;\n&gt; 1. My test method throws an exception.  This exception indicates the real\n&gt; problem.\n&gt; 2. My tearDown method throws an exception.  This exception is caused by an\n&gt; invalid state because my test method did not run all way through.\n&gt;\n&gt; This is a problem because of #2.  The way the JUnit framework is written,\n&gt; any exception coming out of tearDown will mask any exception coming out of\na\n&gt; test method.\n\nAs Kent would say, this sounds like an opportunity to improve your design.\nIs there something you can do about tearDown() so that it doesn&#39;t throw an\nexception whenever the test fails? Any code that tears down fixture should\nreally only fail if there&#39;s a low-level problem you can&#39;t control (network\ntransport, database connection, that kind of thing). Maybe you&#39;re doing too\nmuch to set up and tear down your test fixture.\n\nJBR.\n\n",
