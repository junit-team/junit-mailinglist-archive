Assume\nalso that I can&#39;t replicate the servlet environment  so I&#39;m using Mock\nObjects ( http://mockobjects.sourceforge.net ) to keep the testing\nlight. \n\nIf my service() method looks like this:\n\nservice() {\n\n  doSomething()\n  doAnotherThing()\n  doSomethingElse() \n}\n\neach of which require the setting of a significantly different state (\nor MockObjects inside MockObjects, which I&#39;ve read breaks the\nfundamental philosophy of unit testing and mock objects )\n\nwould it suffice to test doSomething(), doAnotherThing(),\ndoSomethingElse() or would good practice dictate that I test service()\nsince that&#39;s the method that will be involved in the integration of my\ncode with the rest of the system?\n\nI guess my underlying questions are:\n\nWhat are some guidelines for a &quot;unit&quot; ?\nIs the assumption of tested units enough to warrant passing on the\ncomposite methods that call those units?\n\nThanks for any help,\n\nAadi\n\n\n\n",
