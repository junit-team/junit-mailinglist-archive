One of the ideas is<br/>\n&gt; to find a general way to run suites faster by running tests in parallel. To<br/>\n&gt; find effective parallelization strategies, we need data on test run times.<br/>\n&gt; Rather than build big infrastructure to do this (which would undoubtedly be<br/>\n&gt; cool), I&#39;d like to start with the simplest thing that could possibly work.<br/>\n&gt; So:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If you have a long-running test suite and<br/>\n&gt; You run it using Ant and<br/>\n&gt; You can use the XML formattter (&quot;&lt;formatter type=&quot;xml&quot;/&gt;&quot;) and<br/>\n&gt; You don&#39;t mind sharing your test names with me confidentially<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Would you please zip your reports and email them to me. If they&#39;re too big<br/>\n&gt; for email, please let me know and we&#39;ll figure out a backup plan. I&#39;d<br/>\n&gt; appreciate any context you can provide--how long the suite has been in<br/>\n&gt; development, the experience level of the developers, whatever else you think<br/>\n&gt; we might need to know.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The first data set I looked at was from DevCreek--&gt;90M test runs from<br/>\n&gt; production coding representing more than 50 person-years of development. To<br/>\n&gt; my surprise, the test runs exhibit a power law distribution (way lots of<br/>\n&gt; fast tests, a few very long running tests, plot a histogram log-log and you<br/>\n&gt; get a straight line). I have no idea what this means, but it brings to mind<br/>\n&gt; the Asimov quote, &quot;The most exciting phrase to hear in science, the one that<br/>\n&gt; heralds new discoveries, is not &#39;Eureka!&#39; (I found it!) but &#39;That&#39;s funny<br/>\n&gt; ...&#39;&quot; I&#39;ve found many power law distributions in the static and dynamic<br/>\n&gt; structure of code, but the mechanisms influencing test run times seem to be<br/>\n&gt; completely different than those influencing code structure.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anyway, I&#39;d love to validate those findings. The Ant XML format seems like a<br/>\n&gt; good place to start. Alternatively, you could send me one or more files with<br/>\n&gt; test run times one per line.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Questions and comments appreciated.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yours in science,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Kent Beck<br/>\n&gt; Three Rivers Institute<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
