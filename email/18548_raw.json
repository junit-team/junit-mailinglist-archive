Once you figure out how to do them, you \nshould be able to write lots of them , quickly too.\n\nWe could just give you some simple examples, but I tend to find it better \nto show you how to unit test one of your classes that depend on corba or \nsome other system, by using one of your real classes. So, please post \n(just one) class and we&#39;ll knock up a unit test for it.\n\nRegards\n\nAndrew\n\n&quot;avinash anand&quot; &lt;avinash_anand@ yahoo.co. uk&gt; \nSent by: junit@yahoogroups. com\n15-Dec-2006 09:04\nPlease respond to junit@yahoogroups. com\n\nTo\njunit@yahoogroups. com\ncc\n\nSubject\n[junit] Test a remote server\n\nHi Group\nGreetings to all. These days I am writting test suit for a CORBA CRM. Let \nme first introduce the system.\n\nThere is a central ORB server and many other servers which talk to each \nother through vesp. ORB being the central one. Entire code base is in C++. \nI have to test a new server introduced in the system which is written in \nJava. This new server talks to the rest through JNI. As a matter of Fact \nnone of the servers can run independently, they neccesirily have to log \ninto the central kit and report to the the central ORB server. After \nvalidation stuff the server starts working.\n\nEven this new Java based server uses an executable file to work \n(Jloader.exe written in c++)\n\nThis .exe loads various .dll files in the system and in its main method \ncalls the compiled .class files. This is the way how system functions.\n\nMy problem is that when I will write a JUnit test case in IDE (eclipse) \nwhich would operate on the actual code which has 99% dependency and cannot \nbe tested isolated. Is there any way to test this server code while it is \nworking under the live system and the test suite running in the eclipse \nIDE.\n\nHELP !!!\n\nThanks\nAvinash\n\n____________ _________ _________ _________ _________ _________ _ \nNow you can scan emails quickly with a reading pane.
