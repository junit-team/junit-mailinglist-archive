In 4.3, we introduced some run-time math magic to make up for\nthe lack of type-expansion once we had removed most of the primitive\ntype assertEquals methods.  Thus, it became the case, somewhat\naccidentally, that this would pass:\n\nassertEquals(new Integer(1), new Long(1));  // A\n\nHowever, it simultaneously became the case that this would also pass:\n\nassertEquals(new BigDecimal(&quot;1.0&quot;), new BigDecimal(&quot;1.1&quot;));  // B\n\nLine B should certainly fail.  The simplest thing to do is to remove\nour math magic, introduce assertEquals(long, long), etc, and let\nnumerical classes define their own equality.  This means that line A\nwill now fail, since that&#39;s how Integer.equals() is defined.  This is\na small behavior change, but a &quot;regression&quot; of sorts.\n\nIf anyone believes this is a damaging decision, please let me know.\n\n   David Saff\n\n",
