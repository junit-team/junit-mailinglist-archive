IIRC these all rely on<br/>\n&gt; j.a.R to put UI events on the native queue (which is why they provide<br/>\n&gt; real, not mock, testing of Java GUIs), but they relieve the user of<br/>\n&gt; the need to find widget co-ordinates @ runtime, as well as other<br/>\n&gt; useful high-level semantics. (Note that &quot;Abbot&quot; is short for &quot;A Better<br/>\n&gt; &#39;Bot&quot; :-) Don&#39;t play with j.a.R, start writing testcases!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
