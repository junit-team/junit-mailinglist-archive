    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-224938679\">I got my copy on Friday and I have to say that &quot;JUnit Recipes&quot; is an awesome<br/>\nbook! (I even stopped reading Dan Brown&#39;s Da Vinci Code for a while :-). I love<br/>\nthe way that each recipe is presented. It is very clear and concise. There are<br/>\nloads of good ideas and techniques in each recipe. Even something as simple as<br/>\ntesting getters/setters provides important information and discussion from<br/>\nvarious angles. It is very good to see different opinions of the industry about<br/>\nthe treated subjects laid out properly and objectively. I can&#39;t wait to find<br/>\nsome time to read more...<br/>\n<br/>\nJ.B. Thanks for such a valuable resource. &quot;JUnit Recipes&quot; certainly has its<br/>\nplace at the top of my library, next to GoF&#39;s Design Patterns and Bloch&#39;s<br/>\nEffective Java.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards,<br/>\n<br/>\n - Yagiz Erkan -</div>",
