Schuchert &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:schuchert@...\">schuchert@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; A unit test should test one thing. Let&#39;s say you WANT to get multiple<br/>\n&gt; results. What&#39;s the UI for that? And besides the UI, what&#39;s even the point?<br/>\n&gt; We&#39;re trying to write tests in a way that requires nearly 0 human<br/>\n&gt; interaction. If you can get multiple results from a test, it seems you&#39;d<br/>\n&gt; need a person to process those results rather than the computer. It goes<br/>\n&gt; counter to AUTOMATION and moves towards more human intervention.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not sure why wanting multiple results leads to needing human<br/>\nintervention...  Can you expand on that?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe original example was later answered well by someone else. Make<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; testOrder() three tests instead of one. You get the results you want, though<br/>\n&gt; you do have to write a few more lines of code.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The problem with this approach is not just that it leads to an explosion of<br/>\ntest methods, it&#39;s that it decouples code that you obviously want to keep<br/>\ntogether.  First you break these three tests in three different methods and<br/>\nnext thing you know, these three methods become scattered in the class and<br/>\nyou completely forget they are testing things that are closely related.  And<br/>\nmost likely, if you change one of these methods, you need to hunt down these<br/>\nother methods to modify them too.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not saying that it&#39;s a bad thing to do, just that sometimes, there are<br/>\ngood reasons for wanting these multiple asserts together in the same method.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; // Note, in the original test this assert would have failed. It should<br/>\n&gt; have been written<br/>\n&gt; // in a way that would not fail but still assert what should happen<br/>\n&gt; public void testFailure_DoesNotMatch() {<br/>\n&gt;    assertNotEqual( 44, Largest.largest( new int[] {8,9,7}));<br/>\n&gt; }<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And so on... The name of the test states the intent of the test. I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; have to read the code to figure out the intention of what is being tested.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sure, but you can get the same result with strings, which are even more<br/>\nreadable:<br/>\n<br/>\nassert 44 != Larget.largest(new int[] { 8, 9, 7}) : &quot;The largest item should<br/>\nnot be 44&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;snip&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAgree with the rest of your message.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nCédric<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://testng.org\">http://testng.org</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
