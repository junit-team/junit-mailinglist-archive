If I have N hours of<br/>\ndevelopment/testing left before I have to switch to my<br/>\nnext task or risk causing scheduling problems, I would<br/>\nuse a code coverage tool with drill-down report<br/>\ncapabilities to highlight which areas of the codebase<br/>\nneed most attention.<br/>\n<br/>\nTesting absolutely everything is not feasible (or even<br/>\nuseful) in practice. By comparison, knowing how best<br/>\nto partition your remaining on-task time to get the<br/>\nbest mileage out of your test is valuable.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot particularly novel, I suppose, but different from<br/>\nthe traditional approach of merely validating code<br/>\ncoverage (usually when it&#39;s too late to do the right<br/>\nthing about it).<br/>\n<br/>\nUsing a static analysis or a code coverage tool to<br/>\ndirect you towards product areas that need attention<br/>\nand doing it in a team environment has become possible<br/>\nonly recently, with the advent of tools that are:<br/>\n<br/>\n- free, so software licensing for large teams is a<br/>\nnon-issue<br/>\n- fast, so that rapid &quot;code some, test some&quot; iterative<br/>\nwork remains rapid<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a modest way, EMMA tries to be one such tool.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\nVlad.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
