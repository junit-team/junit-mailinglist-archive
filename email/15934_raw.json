Meanwhile, I&#39;d \n&gt; like to talk with you about Java 3D. I&#39;m trying to make a little \n&gt; exploration in sensorial capacity, but how to test it? Do I need to \n&gt; make a Java 3D application inside the test or is there a more elegant \n&gt; solution?\nYou&#39;ll have to fill me in on what you mean by &quot;sensorial capacity&quot;.  I \nhave some experience with Java3D.  The approach that worked the best is \nsimilar to what UI people call &quot;Humble Dialog&quot;: try to keep the actual \nrendering isolated to a very thin layer on top of a rich model.  This \nway, you can test the colors, positions, and relationships of objects \nwithout even referencing the Java3D API.  You may be able to get the \nrendering layer so thin that you can trust it after manual inspection \nand user testing, or you may need to use some other acceptance testing \ntechnique.  Good luck,\n\n    David Saff\n\n",
