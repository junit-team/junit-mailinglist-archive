Sure, I could<br/>\n&gt; extend TestCase to periodically call a function in its TestResult<br/>\n&gt; (oops, it has no reference to it!), which would then propogate to the<br/>\n&gt; TestListener, and then somehow output the data. But...no. That was SO<br/>\n&gt; much more work than it seemed like it should have been. Too many<br/>\n&gt; private elements, too much reflection.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; But it seems like a useful feature. Perhaps one that others might have<br/>\n&gt; explored in the past. Has anyone looked at this? Is there an extension<br/>\n&gt; out there that implements it?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>JUnit was written to support test-first programming.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen writing code test-first, tests cannot be that slow.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow you know why JUnit makes no room for such a feature.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can easily build your own test runner with that feature built in.
