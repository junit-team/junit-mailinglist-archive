It&#39;s changing something in a different layer, in this case a<br/>\n    particular display component. This means you have to re-implement<br/>\n    this solution again every time you use a new display component,<br/>\n    which certainly violates the &quot;once and only once&quot; principle.<br/>\n<br/>\n    2. It seems to me that it&#39;s placing the responsibility for this in<br/>\n    the wrong place. (See point 1 above.)<br/>\n<br/>\n    3. Your solution runs tests for which I do not want the output.<br/>\n    Why generate unless information and throw it away? That&#39;s not very<br/>\n    intention revealing coding. And as well, it will use computing<br/>\n    resources that need not be used.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not trying to imply that you&#39;re too lazy to solve the problem. First<br/>\nof all, it&#39;s a hard problem. Second, it&#39;s not all that interesting to<br/>\nyou (since it doesn&#39;t cause you much pain), so why would I expect you<br/>\nto spend much time on it? Third, I don&#39;t consider that there&#39;s anything<br/>\nwrong with using a kludge if that happens to be the best solution to the<br/>\nproblem for a given situation. I kludge things all the time because the<br/>\ndownside of the kludge is less than the cost to &quot;do it right.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\ncjs<br/>\n-- <br/>\nCurt Sampson  &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cjs@...\">cjs@...</a>&gt;   +81 90 7737 2974   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.NetBSD.org\">http://www.NetBSD.org</a><br/>\n    Don&#39;t you know, in this new Dark Age, we&#39;re all light.  --XTC</div>",
