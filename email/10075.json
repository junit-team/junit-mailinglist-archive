I&#39;m searching for that &quot;aha!&quot;<br/>\n&gt; nugget that may be lurking in the IDE -- I guess a way for the IDE to<br/>\n&gt; allow easy browsing of the test classes but telling it to not compile<br/>\n&gt; them with the prod classes.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>So you want to build the two source trees separately (to different <br/>\ntarget directories, let&#39;s say), but within one project?

You need to ask IDE experts, and not JUnit experts. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
