I think The \n&gt; TestSuite just accept *.class file, since CORBA IDL is \nspecification, \n&gt; how can I use Junit to test IDL? Someone help me out!\n\nYou must be very careful to define what it means to test an interface \ndefinition (I and D from IDL).  Generally, specifications are \nreviewed; implementations are tested.  There are no semantic \nexpressions in IDL.\n\nI personally see little point to interface testing if there will be a \nsingle implementation.  So, I will assume you are in a situation where \nthere are multiple objects implementing the interfaces in question.\n\nThe only added complexity in this situation, as compared to non-CORBA \nunit testing, is getting ahold of the object to test.  I think \nsomebody already described connecting to the service to get named \nobjects.\n\nActually, because of CORBA, you have more options at your disposal.  \nConsider a test service that manages references to objects you are \ntesting.  This gives you a central place to find things.  Particularly \nuseful for unnamed objects.\n\nI particularly like the later solution because it removes knowledge \nabout the implementation under test from the test suite.  To test a \nnew implementation, change the reference in your managing service and \nrerun the suite.\n\n\n",
