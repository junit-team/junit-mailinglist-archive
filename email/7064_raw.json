If that&#39;s correct, then I don&#39;t think you really want to extend.\nInclude method B in your base class, and using the static suite method,\nreturn a suite of the methods you want to run, for now.  I think that will\naccomplish what you&#39;re looking for, unless there was some other reason for\nyou to want to extend the base test case.  It&#39;s unclear why you&#39;re doing\nthat.\n\n-Larry\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Alok Daipuria [mailto:alok.daipuria@...]\nSent: Tuesday, February 25, 2003 12:43 PM\nTo: &#39;junit@yahoogroups.com&#39;\nSubject: [junit] suppressing test cases from base class in an extended\nclass\n\n\nI have an existing test case class which I extended to add few more test\ncases. When I run the extended test case, it runs the test cases from the\nbase class as well. Is there a flag or something which I can use to suppress\nrunning test cases present in the base class.\n   Here&#39;s an example of the scenario :\n          \n            class A extends TestCase\n            {\n                public testA() {}\n            }\n \n            class B extends A\n            {\n                public testB() {}\n            }\n \n  When I execute class B, it runs both testA() and testB(), which I want to\navoid for now. I need to extend to be able to use the setup/teardown done by\nA.\n \n-alok\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\njunit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n \n\nYour use of Yahoo!
