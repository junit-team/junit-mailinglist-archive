The Transaction had\nCommit/Rollback methods which contained application specific handling\n(like resetting local state in event of a database rollback) as well as\nperforming the real commit/rollback . By substituting a special purpose\nTransaction object I could simulate nested transactions or\ndummy out the commits for testing purposes.\n\nOn Fri, 31 Aug 2001, Richard Dallaway wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt; A while ago I had an email conversation with Bruce Vinchon regarding\n&gt; database testing. I said I&#39;d mention something we discussed on this mailing\n&gt; list so here goes (and apologies to Bruce if I&#39;ve misrepresented his thoughts).\n&gt;\n&gt; Bruce mentioned using the &quot;auto commit off&quot; trick to make database testing\n&gt; easier.   I.e., you do something like turn auto commit off during setUp()\n&gt; and do an rollback/abort in tearDown(), so you can write to a test database\n&gt; and not have to worry about cleaning it up. Something like that.\n&gt;\n&gt; I replied talking about the problems when you have methods which are\n&gt; themselves transactions (i.e., methods which\n&gt; start transactions, write to various tables, then commit).  How can you use\n&gt; the &quot;auto commit off&quot; trick in those situations?\n&gt;\n&gt; Bruce suggested that you may be able to get something to work with nested\n&gt; transactions, perhaps using a transaction service such as JTA/JTS.  Sounds\n&gt; good to me, but I haven&#39;t had the opportunity to investigate this idea or\n&gt; the Java Transaction APIs.\n&gt;\n&gt; Can anyone comment on this approach?\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards\n&gt; Richard\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
