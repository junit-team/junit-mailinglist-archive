Incidentally I have a \n&quot;real world&quot; experiment here in case anyone is\ninterested:\n\nhttps://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=173226\n\nIt&#39;s an Ecore2EcoreProcessor with an\nEcore2EcoreProcessorHelper\n\nthat has all public methods. \n\nThis made it easy to test the solution, and hopefully\njust as easy to understand it for others.\n\nSome of the methods could have easily been private,\nbut having them in the Helper make them a natural\ntarget for a Utility library when someone sees the\ncase for it, making the code base smaller, more\nmanagable, and useful.\n\nThis way Helper classes can be scanned by other\ndevelopers looking for an approach when they see that\nthe helper Target (The MainClass) does something that\nthey are interested in.\n\nCheers,\n- Ole\n\n--- David Saff &lt;saff@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; Ole,\n&gt; \n&gt; It has been proposed in the past--I can&#39;t seem to\n&gt; find it on Google,\n&gt; but I have a memory of Ron Jeffries quoting someone\n&gt; else who had done\n&gt; a small experiment of making all methods public and\n&gt; still having a\n&gt; sensible API, and had liked the results.\n&gt; \n&gt; I myself am not tempted to go to this extreme. \n&gt; Private methods\n&gt; generally mean that I have several abstraction\n&gt; layers living within\n&gt; the same class.  I&#39;m not bothered by this in\n&gt; principle, until I find\n&gt; the &quot;hidden&quot; abstraction layer troublesome or\n&gt; interesting enough that\n&gt; I&#39;m tempted to test it directly, in which case I\n&gt; take the time to\n&gt; think about the name and interface of that hidden\n&gt; abstraction layer,\n&gt; and expose it as a class.\n&gt; \n&gt;    David Saff\n&gt; \n&gt; On 2/12/07, Ole Ersoy &lt;ole_ersoy@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Hi Guys,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Would it be a good idea to always use all public\n&gt; &gt; methods...?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; In the context of a convention where there is a\n&gt; &gt; &quot;MainClass&quot; and a &quot;MainClassHelper&quot; that has\n&gt; public\n&gt; &gt; methods used to help the MainClass.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Users of MainClassHelper (The collaborator should\n&gt; &gt; really be MainClass only) know that this class\n&gt; exists\n&gt; &gt; mainly for the purpose of helping MainClass, and\n&gt; all\n&gt; &gt; the methods are public, so that they can be easily\n&gt; &gt; unit tested.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Otherwise they would be private or protected\n&gt; members\n&gt; &gt; of MainClass.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; So MainClassHelper can really be thought of as a\n&gt; &gt; utility library that is specific to MainClass...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Anyone know if there are security risks to this,\n&gt; &gt; beside API risks?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks,\n&gt; &gt; - Ole\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n____________________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; Don&#39;t get soaked.
