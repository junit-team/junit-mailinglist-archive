If you get the code to break, how <br/>\nare you going to repeat it? And then how are you going to know if you&#39;ve <br/>\nfixed the bug?<br/>\n<br/>\nMuch better to throw *every* possibility at the code, rather than just a <br/>\nrandom selection. You&#39;d be surprised at the number of bugs this <br/>\nuncovers. I&#39;ve discovered quite a few bugs in the JDK itself by <br/>\nexhaustively testing some things Sun never bothered to do more than <br/>\nsample testing on. I just found another one this morning. There are 32 <br/>\ncharacters in the ISO-8859-7 encoding that Java 1.5 can&#39;t correctly <br/>\nencode. (This one&#39;s a regression. It worked in 1.4.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the problem space is so large that you really can&#39;t test every <br/>\npossibility, then write a program to generate random samples and *log* <br/>\nany that fail so you can add them to the test suite. That way you can <br/>\nrun the few failing tests repeatedly until (and after) they&#39;ve been <br/>\nfixed. However the actual generation of the random samples should be <br/>\nseparated from your unit test suite.  Random generation of test data is <br/>\nantithetical to test driven development. Test driven development <br/>\nrequires reproducible tests.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nElliotte Rusty Harold  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:elharo@...\">elharo@...</a><br/>\nXML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/\">http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim\">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim</a></div>",
