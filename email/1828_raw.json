I don&#39;t do code for &quot;consumers&quot; style end-users.\nMore like a system that is put into production at some point, not an app\ninstalled on a desktop. Having a special hook in the app to enable running\nunit tests on production hardware & software setup might prove valuable when\nyou suspect a problem with a JVM for example.\n\n I totally agree with what Michael expressed below. In my case, I currently\nwork for an IT departement that wants to maintain the code on it&#39;s own after\nthe project (so &quot;source code is provided&quot;). They are buying code, and we\ngive them tests as an added bonus. As for bandwith & storage, I think it is\na moot point. How much for a 20 Gig theses days? If the code is not an\napplet, I don&#39;t see why it would generate bandwith loss more than me\ndownloading mp3s  ;)\n\nmathieu\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: Michael Silverstein\n\nDefinitely if source code is provided, including test cases make sense. I\nthink we all agree now that within the context of end-user application\ndeployment, it doesn&#39;t make sense to include test cases, except for special\ndiagnostic circumstances. If a product deliverable includes source code, or\nis a framework that provides a set of Java APIs, then a set of test cases is\ninvaluable for documenting and validating product usage.\n\n\n",
