You<br/>\nare opening it up to that plus the contribution of<br/>\nmore tests by an independent source.  Of course you<br/>\nare right, that is the way to go.  I just didn&#39;t group<br/>\nthese outside tests under the &quot;TDD&quot; umbrella.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think J. B. makes a good distinction by not calling<br/>\nthem all &quot;unit tests&quot; but &quot;programmer tests&quot; and<br/>\n&quot;integration tests&quot;.  Again, this comes down to<br/>\nsemantics, and I can see independent testers<br/>\ncontributing to either type of test, though typically<br/>\nan organization defines their job as doing<br/>\nacceptance/integration tests.  But, you are probably<br/>\nright that they can and should contribute at the<br/>\nprogrammer tests level as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and I know your pain on management that is not<br/>\nreceptive to XP (or agile of any sort).  That is why I<br/>\ndo TDD; it is the one thing I can do independent of<br/>\nall other things.  I think coworkers notice, and see<br/>\nthe value of TDD as well, to some degree.  Maybe<br/>\nmanagement will some day too, and get curious as to<br/>\nother potential agile methods.<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Lauren Bish wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; That is all true - but I didn&#39;t say that a dedicated<br/>\n&gt; unit tester&#39;s purpose<br/>\n&gt; was to replace TDD - what I said was that the<br/>\n&gt; dedicated unit tester helped<br/>\n&gt; in getting more and better tests earlier. A<br/>\n&gt; dedicated unit tester also helps<br/>\n&gt; introduce the concept and value of unit and early<br/>\n&gt; testing to teams,<br/>\n&gt; management, companies and developers. This helps get<br/>\n&gt; your foot in the door.<br/>\n&gt; You have to remember that there are a lot of<br/>\n&gt; companies out there that don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; practice XP or even halfway decent practices, and<br/>\n&gt; you can&#39;t make them<br/>\n&gt; swallow XP or TDD all in one gulp. The purpose of<br/>\n&gt; any good practice is to<br/>\n&gt; improve the quality of software, but you can&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; accomplish that in one fell<br/>\n&gt; swoop.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
