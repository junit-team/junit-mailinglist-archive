That being said the flavor of the day is definitely Squeak,<br/>\nan open source implementation of the Smalltalk-80 system (www.squeak.org<br/>\n-- a minimal front-end to the community).  As far as IDEs go, Smalltalk<br/>\nwas and continues to be the leader for many reasons, but since this<br/>\nisn&#39;t a Smalltalk list, I will leave it there to whet your appetite.  By<br/>\nthe way, in case you didn&#39;t know, JUnit is the Java equivalent of the<br/>\noriginal XUnit testing framework by Kent Beck called SUnit (Smalltalk<br/>\nUnit), and Squeak is fully up-to-date with the latest and greatest on<br/>\nthat front as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n=jason<br/>\n[:question | ^One] <br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Adelbert Groebbens [mailto:adelbert.groebbens@...] <br/>\nSent: Monday, December 16, 2002 5:10 PM<br/>\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com<br/>\nSubject: RE: [junit] OT: OO Newcomer<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is a list of books and resources I&#39;ve found very inspirational<br/>\n(the numbers indicate an ordening in terms of phases).<br/>\n<br/>\nJava seems to me one of the most suitable languages for concentrating on<br/>\nlearning OO.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnit testing and refactoring are also very advisable techniques to use<br/>\nand<br/>\nknow about as soon as possible.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Furthermore, using ANT and a nice IDE like IntelliJ IDEA should settle<br/>\nyou<br/>\nfor a pleasant OO cruise.)<br/>\n<br/>\n(*) is probably one of the best introductions to OO<br/>\n<br/>\n  a.. book: Design Patterns, (GoF) (2)<br/>\n  b.. book: Craig Larman, &quot;Applying UML and Patterns&quot; (2) (*)<br/>\n  c..

[mailto:mamago@...]<br/>\n  Sent: vrijdag 13 december 2002 16:53<br/>\n  To: junit@yahoogroups.com<br/>\n  Subject: [junit] OT: OO Newcomer<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  OFF TOPIC<br/>\n  Disclaimer:  see below<br/>\n<br/>\n  Bringing a newbie into OO<br/>\n  =========================<br/>\n<br/>\n  I would like to ask the people on this list for recommendations of the<br/>\nbest<br/>\n  literature to bring an OO newbie up to speed.<br/>\n<br/>\n  The programming language in question is Java, which means that there<br/>\nis a<br/>\n  splendid wealth of online material for someone to learn the language.<br/>\nThe<br/>\n  important thing, however, is to instill the notion of OO purity, which<br/>\nis<br/>\n  harder, perhaps, than just teaching the language.<br/>\n<br/>\n  For example: the GoF patterns book is a must, but I think it is not a<br/>\ntext<br/>\n  that you can give to someone until they have a grounding in OO<br/>\ntechniques.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Your thoughts?<br/>\n<br/>\n  Manuel Amago.<br/>\n<br/>\n  -----------------------------------------------<br/>\n  DISCLAIMER<br/>\n  I know this group is not for this type of question, which is why I<br/>\n  explicitly labelled this thread as OT (Off Topic).  I hope you will<br/>\nforgive<br/>\n  my impertinence.  ;)<br/>\n  But, I greatly value the opinions of the people on this list, and I<br/>\ntrust<br/>\n  your opinion on this particular issue.<br/>\n<br/>\n  --------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n  mail2web - Check your email from the web at<br/>\n  http://mail2web.com/ .<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n  junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Your use of Yahoo!
