Tests\nshouldn&#39;t have side effects.  If you find yourself doing the same thing\nin many tests (like inserting &#39;RecordIWillLookForInAMoment&#39;), move that\nto a helper method.\n\nThe thing that I decided that really cleaned things up for me is that\nwithin a unit test, its ok if the helper methods *also* contain tests.\n\nMore clearly, its bad if a testXXX method has some side effect, but if\na helper method doSomeAction has a &#39;side effect&#39; of testing some\nconditions, that&#39;s not a bad thing.\n\n$.02\n\nKevin\n&gt; If writing the suite method yourself doesn&#39;t sound like a good\n&gt; option,\n&gt; you could just move this into one testXXX() and do the two inserts\n&gt; and check in the test that the second fails, then clean up the\n&gt; inserted record in tearDown().\n\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nNew DSL Internet Access from SBC & Yahoo!\nhttp://sbc.yahoo.com\n\n\n",
