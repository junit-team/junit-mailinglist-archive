Some people have done significant work. JXUnit \n&lt;br&gt;\nwent so far as forking, and Vladimir Bossicard is obviously getting \n&lt;br&gt;\nfrustrated (not that I blame him).&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n1. Erich and I are doing this on really limited resources, and nobody\n&lt;br&gt;\nhas ever said, &quot;How can I help?&quot; except Erik Meade. Coming to\nus with &lt;br&gt;\nan offer to make some problem go away is much more likely to get a &lt;br&gt;\npositive response than, &quot;Here&#39;s some code. Integrate it.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n2. JUnit as a political gesture celebrates the ability of programmers\n&lt;br&gt;\nto test their own software. The code and tests must be held to a &lt;br&gt;\nhigher standard, to demonstrate the techniques necessary to uphold &lt;br&gt;\nour end of the bargain.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n3. We are new to the open source culture, and we are certain to make\n&lt;br&gt;\nsome mistakes. When we do, we need feedback.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n4. We don&#39;t get to program much, and when we do it is generally in a\n&lt;br&gt;\nvery constrainted situation where we have to make lots of &lt;br&gt;\ncompromises. Our greatest joy in JUnit is a project where we can &lt;br&gt;\nengineer at the limits of our ability.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nOur long-term goal is to shift primary responsibility for the further\n&lt;br&gt;\ndevelopment of JUnit to the community, while retaining the technical\n&lt;br&gt;\nexcellence exhibited by junit.framework, extending that level of &lt;br&gt;\nrefinement to the rest of the codebase, and maintaining our ability \n&lt;br&gt;\nto get together for a couple of days and add cool features.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nImmediately, expect any submissions that don&#39;t come with extensive &lt;br&gt;\ntest cases to be unceremoniously bounced. Offers of help with grunge\n&lt;br&gt;\nwork will be gratefully accepted.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nKent&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:&lt;br&gt;\njunit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com&lt;br&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nYour use of Yahoo!
