I\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; would like to\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; test successful downloading and launching of the apps from\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; the server\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; via WebStart, I guess I am looking for WebStartUnit...\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; I think you are /writing/ WebStartUnit... although not\n&gt;  &gt; necessarily.\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; Use me as a virtual pair. Describe how you would test\n&gt;  &gt; this manually.\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; --\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; J.B.,\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; What I would ideally like is a means to specify from a unit\n&gt;  &gt; test the\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; URL of a WebStart app. to launch, then get back some indication of\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; whether it launched OK, or some error codes if something\n&gt;  &gt; went wrong.\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; Currently we have to test this manually by clicking on each\n&gt;  &gt; app&#39;s link\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; on the WebStart page and verifying the app. is downloaded\n&gt;  &gt; and launched\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; successfully.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; What criteria do you use to determine whether the application is\n&gt;  &gt; downloaded and launched successfully? I assume that you look at a web\n&gt;  &gt; page and judge &quot;pass&quot; or &quot;fail&quot;. Can you put that information in an\n&gt;  &gt; HTMLUnit test? (You mentioned HTTPUnit. If you&#39;re not using HTMLUnit,\n&gt;  &gt; start.)\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; I don&#39;t understand WebStart, so you&#39;ll have to explain to me\n&gt;  &gt; how I would\n&gt;  &gt; know that a WebStart-served application ran correctly.\n&gt;  &gt; --\n&gt; J.B.,\n&gt; \n&gt; For some info on WebStart see http://java.sun.com/products/javawebstart/\n&gt; It&#39;s basically a mechanism for downloading Java apps (e.g. Swing apps)\n&gt; by\n&gt; clicking on a link on a webpage.  The WebStart software on the client\n&gt; machine\n&gt; then fetches the jars (if not previously cached) and runs the program\n&gt; locally\n&gt; on the client machine.  Think of it like applets &quot;Next Generation&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; To verify our app&#39;s are running correctly after a build/deploy cycle,\n&gt; we need to click the link on a webpage for each app, observe WebStart\n&gt; download each app. without error and observe each (Swing) app. start\n&gt; correctly (e.g. show it&#39;s initial login screen).\n&gt; \n&gt; Thus there&#39;s not much to test on the HTTP side of things apart from\n&gt; ensuring each link is valid...\n\nWell, off the top of my head there are two approaches.\n\n1. Use Microsoft&#39;s ScriptIt or whatever is appropriate for your \nplatform. This is software that allows you to monitor OS-level windows, \nclick widgets on them and verify the contents of windows. It may help.\n\n2. Find out what mechanism is launching the WebStart application locally \nand see whether there is a Java interface to it through something like \nRMI. If there is, then your test goes like this:\n\nuse HTTPConnection to click the link\nconnect to the WebStart server\nsleep for some reasonable amount of time\nverify that the WebStart server is running/has launched the desired app\n\nDoes any of that help? Does anyone have a more brute approach?\n-- \nJ. B.
