Assuming\nthat the parser only parses. If the pars=\r\ner does more than parse then\nmaybe it could be a good idea to look into how=\r\n to test the actual\nparsing in isolation. I&#39;d say you would want to /be abl=\r\ne/ to do this\nin any case even if you choose to test end to end. Perhaps te=\r\nsting a\nsmall subset of the 120 combinations end to end and the rest with t=\r\nhe\nparser alone?\n\nIn your case the parameterized runner would maybe be a be=\r\ntter fit, I\nhave no experience with that one but I read others complain abo=\r\nut only\nbeing presented with the index that failed and not the actual data.=\r\n\nThe theory runner gives you the data combination that failed which may\nmak=\r\ne it a good choice to acomplish what you want to do even if it is\n&quot;abusing&quot;=\r\n theories a little.\n\n\n\nOn Thu, Mar 20, 2008 at 11:25 PM, techstuff1971 &lt;tec=\r\nhstuff1971@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt;\n&gt;  I am new to JUNIT and a=\r\nlthough I&#39;ve read all of the docs (save the\n&gt;  javadoc) it&#39;s not entirely c=\r\nlear to me how to proceed or even if JUNIT\n&gt;  is appropriate for my needs. =\r\nI will explain the situation and was\n&gt;  hoping that maybe someone could poi=\r\nnt me in the right direction.\n&gt;\n&gt;  I have written a SQL parser which parses=\r\n a SQL query and builds an\n&gt;  object model representation of same which it =\r\nreturns as the result of\n&gt;  a parse. The object model has the ability to pr=\r\nint itself and so long\n&gt;  as the parser works correctly what it prints will=\r\n be very close to the\n&gt;  input query. A single test case then consists of p=\r\narsing a query,\n&gt;  calling printMe( ) on the resultant tree and comparing i=\r\nt&#39;s output to\n&gt;  what was expected, which again, is very similar to but not=\r\n identical\n&gt;  to the original query.\n&gt;\n&gt;  So, first a general question: I k=\r\nnow that his is closer to end to end\n&gt;  testing than it is to the sort of f=\r\nine grained class level tests JUNIT\n&gt;  is designed for. Is JUNIT even appro=\r\npriate? Assuming the answer is\n&gt;  yes, I&#39;ll continue.\n&gt;\n&gt;  The pseudo code =\r\nfor a single test case would look like this:\n&gt;\n&gt;  String orgnlQry =3D &quot;Sele=\r\nct * from MyTable.MyColumn&quot;;\n&gt;  String expectedQry =3D &quot;Select * from MyCol=\r\numn&quot;;\n&gt;  Parser myParser =3D new Parser( );\n&gt;  // A bunch of code to constr=\r\nuct Parser and connect to data store\n&gt;  myParser.parse(orgnlQry);\n&gt;  SQLTre=\r\ne tree =3D myParser.getTree( );\n&gt;  String outQry =3D tree.printMe( );\n&gt;  as=\r\nsertEquals(outQry, expectedQry);\n&gt;\n&gt;  I&#39;d like all of my test cases to use =\r\nthe same parser instance so that\n&gt;  I only have to initialize it once. The =\r\nonly variables for each test\n&gt;  than are the orgnl/expectedQry pairs of whi=\r\nch I&#39;ve got about 120.\n&gt;\n&gt;  I&#39;m able to get a single test case running but =\r\nI can&#39;t figure out how\n&gt;  to eliminate duplicate code. I&#39;m also no sure how=\r\n to organize the\n&gt;  tests. Shold there really be 120 different test methods=\r\n or is there\n&gt;  some way to call the same test method 120 times with differ=\r\nent input\n&gt;  strings?\n&gt;\n&gt;  Thanks in advance for any suggestions anyone can=\r\n provide.\n&gt;\n&gt;  -ts1971\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n\n\n\n-- \n---------------------------------------=\r\n--------------\nJoakim Ohlrogge\nAgical AB\nV=E4sterl=E5nggatan 79, 2 tr\n111 2=\r\n9 Stockholm, SWEDEN\n\nMobile: +46-708-754004\nBlog: johlrogge.wordpress.com\nE=\r\n-mail: joakim.ohlrogge@...\n\n",
