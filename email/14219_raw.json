For those who prefer browsing a website instead\nof reading plain text, visit: http://www.xpday.info\n\nIf you are looking for an opportunity to learn more about Extreme\nProgramming without having to spend an entire week at a large\ninternational XP conference, XP Day DC fits the bill.  XP Day is a\none-day event with activities for anyone interested in Extreme\nProgramming, whether you&#39;re:\n\n* An executive wondering how XP can improve the contribution your\nsoftware organization makes to the bottom line.\n* A manager looking for ways to increase your team&#39;s effectiveness.\n* A skeptic, hoping to challenge the most experienced and outspoken XP\npractitioners.\n* A programmer itching to experience a real XP project room.\n* An experienced practitioner, hoping to share ideas with other\nexperienced practitioners.\n\nFor those of you who missed out on Agile 2005, this would be an\nexcellent opportunity to meet, attend tutorial sessions and even work\nwith some of the XP community&#39;s most notable practitioners.\n\nXP Day events are interactive!\n\n- Tutorials\n\nWe are fortunate to have respected leaders of the XP community\nproviding world-class instruction in the fundamentals of XP.\n\n* Bill Wake, keynote.\n* J. B. Rainsberger will provide an introduction to XP.\n* Jeff Nielsen will show you an XP approach to communicating\nrequirements.\n\n- Open Space\n\nYou can collaborate intensively with both local and invited advanced\npractitioners on issues that challenge you most. If the tutorials\ndon&#39;t cover it, you can work through your burning questions in Open\nSpace.\n\n- Panel Discussion\n\nWe are pleased to invite clients of Digital Focus to share their\nstories about How XP Has Changed Our Lives. To get a head start on\nyour company&#39;s transition to XP, or to find out more about the\nbenefits and pitfalls of adopting XP practices, ask those who have\nexperienced it!\n\n- Project Room\n\nIf you&#39;re looking to dive in and immerse yourself in XP, join the XP\nProject Room, where you&#39;ll have the opportunity to work on project\nwith respected experts. Not sure what&#39;s going on? No problem! Join the\nproject any time and someone will bring you up to speed quickly, just\nlike on a real XP project!\n\nIf you&#39;re looking for more information, visit our website:\nhttp://www.xpday.info\n\nIf you have any questions with regards to this event, please don&#39;t\nhesitate to contact me at the email address listed above.\n\nHope to see you all there!\n\nNiraj.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
