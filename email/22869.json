    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-101620058\">I would like to add something here, regarding the Maven repo push:<br/>\n- if you publish your versions of junit as SNAPSHOTS (such as 4.8.1-SNAPSHOT) (which I think you don&#39;t want), then yes, the users will get auto-updated and perhaps their tests might start failing in the morning, after such an update.<br/>\n- however, if you publish your versions as non-snapshot versions (such as 4.8.1), then the users will NOT be auto-updated. They have to manually select to use the new version that has just appeared in the repo, and this way if their tests start failing, they will know that they can either fix them to work with the new version of junit, or revert to the previous version.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am considering of taking up on this task with pushing junit to the public Maven repo, but I have to first learn what is exactly the process for this (perhaps signing up at Apache as contributor, or smt).<br/>\n<br/>\nBogdan<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, David Saff &lt;david@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On Tue, Aug 17, 2010 at 6:28 PM, pniederw &lt;pniederw@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve noticed that JUnit includes an (outdated) version of Hamcrest.

We guessed that of people who used the hamcrest features<br/>\n&gt; bundled with JUnit, there were more that would be hurt by a version<br/>\n&gt; change than would be helped by it, so we&#39;ve stayed here.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Why is there no junit-dep anymore, i.e. how are we supposed to use JUnit with Hamcrest 1.2?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; junit-dep has been up on github for every release.  Whoever has been<br/>\n&gt; putting JUnit up on maven, I take it, hasn&#39;t been also putting up<br/>\n&gt; junit-dep?  I&#39;m sorry to say that I&#39;m very aware that a lot of people<br/>\n&gt; are indebted to the anonymous time-donor who&#39;d been keeping the maven<br/>\n&gt; repos up-to-date until several months ago.  I&#39;ve been reluctant to<br/>\n&gt; accept full responsibility for feeding a repository I neither use nor<br/>\n&gt; fully understand until some point where I was sure I could quickly<br/>\n&gt; respond to millions of users who got their junit jars auto-updated in<br/>\n&gt; a way that broke all their tests.  This might be overly cautious of<br/>\n&gt; me.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;    David Saff<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Cheers,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Peter<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
