If that<br/>\n&gt; fails, then all your database dependant tests fail, you know that<br/>\n&gt; the connection could not be established due to the DB connection<br/>\n&gt; test.  The fact that the other tests fail as a side effect is<br/>\n&gt; somewhat irrelevant.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The other suggestion I saw about doing asserts in setup could be<br/>\n&gt; used, too.  Or, something I currently do (an idea blatantly stolen<br/>\n&gt; from my co-workers), if testing some pre-existing condition is to<br/>\n&gt; simply notate:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; assertEquals(&quot;Test setup: This should be zero initially&quot;, 0,<br/>\n&gt; someClass.Value());<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Then if a &#39;test setup&#39; assert is thrown, you know that there was<br/>\n&gt; something wrong before you even made it to the asserts you were<br/>\n&gt; really testing.  Very useful, simple, and doesn&#39;t require some grand<br/>\n&gt; mechanism.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>When you write three of those, you have duplication in the failure <br/>\nmessage.
