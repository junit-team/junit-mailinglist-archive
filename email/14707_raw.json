If you \n&gt; &gt; implement me, you&#39;d better pass my Contract Tests, or you don&#39;t really \n&gt; &gt; implement me. If the above example were really important, there&#39;d be a \n&gt; test.\n&gt; \n&gt; That&#39;s a good idea, and if I&#39;d ever seen it done in practice I might be \n&gt; more willing to accept it. In fact,. I have never once seen an interface \n&gt; based API that came with a set of tests implementations were required to \n&gt; pass. This includes major APIs shipped by organizations like JavaSoft \n&gt; and the W3C, not just internal corporate work and open source hacking.\n&gt; \n&gt; Of course, I&#39;ve never looked at your codebase. Given that you do this, I \n&gt; suspect your code is likely more robust and reliable than what i see out \n&gt; there, which doesn&#39;t really surprise me. It&#39;s long been known that a \n&gt; small percentage of programmers are vastly more productive than most \n&gt; programmers are. I suspect the programmers who hang out on mailing \n&gt; lists, attend conferences, write and read articles, and so forth tend to \n&gt; be in the more productive group. However, these are not the majority of \n&gt; working developers, and realistic API design has to work for the \n&gt; majority of client programmers, not just the top 10%.\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; Elliotte Rusty Harold elharo@...\n&gt; XML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!\n&gt; http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/\n&gt; http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim\n&gt;  \n&gt;  ------------------------------\n&gt; \n\nThat&#39;s pretty much the practical application of the Liskov Substitution \nPrinciple that I have in mind when I&#39;m developing.
