Long story short, the GUI harness helps in building\n&gt; test suites. Part of this harness is allowing the user to add new\n&gt; testcases in a graphical tree, define the class name, and the methods\n&gt; of the class. All of this is embeddable within existing applications,\n&gt; such as a Swing GUI app to allow a developer to quickly assemble and\n&gt; execute individual tests without having to drop to the command line.\n&gt; All of this works presently. My one BIG problem is trying to get the\n&gt; test results from the test cases that are ran, so that I can embed\n&gt; something similar to the &lt;junitreport&gt; task that ant has. After a\n&gt; single test, or a group of tests run, I want my harness to show the\n&gt; output.\n&gt; \n&gt; My initial thought was that I did not have to execute a junit TestCase\n&gt; through the junit run(TestResult) method. Basically, I was hoping I\n&gt; could somehow get the assertXxx() output directly. \n\nEssentially you are looking at writing your own test runner. You can\nlook at numerous examples of this - look at how ant implements the\njunit task, look at the open source project JUnitEE or the\nJUnitServlet included with HttpUnit - all are examples of custom test\nrunners which can produce their results as xml.\n\n",
