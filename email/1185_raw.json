There is lot of dependencies between the\nclasses.\n\nIn one place it is creating objects. How to write test case to verify\nthat created object is wrong or right?\n\nIn run time they are writing data into database, passing to various\nobjects. We need to write test cases for all these. Creating objects and\nso on. Is it worth writing test cases for this sort of scenario?  I am\nthinking that doing black box testing is better than writing JUnit test\ncases.\n\nregards,\nBhavani.\n\n\n\n",
