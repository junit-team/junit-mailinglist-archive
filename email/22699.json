From the<br/>\n&gt; design perspective, why have a whole Runner just for filtering by<br/>\n&gt; category?  There are other things you can filter on.  And, there were<br/>\n&gt; some definitely hackish parts of the implementation.  And, it turns<br/>\n&gt; out, there were bugs in Categories, (such as<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://github.com/KentBeck/junit/issues#issue/74)\">http://github.com/KentBeck/junit/issues#issue/74)</a> that were very hard<br/>\n&gt; to elegantly fix with the current design.  And, (sorry, maven<br/>\n&gt; hopefuls), but we were anxious to get back into the meat of the code.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So, the first 4.9 snapshot is up today, with a new way of specifying<br/>\n&gt; suites, called SuiteBuilder.  SuiteBuilder allows for flexible<br/>\n&gt; specification of where to find the classes containing tests, and how<br/>\n&gt; to filter the resulting runners.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This suite class lists the explicit test classes to consider running,<br/>\n&gt; and then filters it down to only those tests or classes annotated with<br/>\n&gt; `@Category(Yes.class)`:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \t@RunWith(SuiteBuilder.class)<br/>\n&gt; \tpublic static class OnlyYes {<br/>\n&gt; \t\t@Classes<br/>\n&gt; \t\tpublic Listed classes= new Listed(Yes1.class, Yes2.class, No1.class);<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \t\t@RunnerFilter<br/>\n&gt; \t\tpublic CategoryFilter filter= CategoryFilter.include(Yes.class);<br/>\n&gt; \t}<br/>\n&gt; \t<br/>\n&gt; We hope to soon include other implementations for the @Classes<br/>\n&gt; annotation, including a classpath-searching test gatherer.  Other<br/>\n&gt; implementations for @RunnerFilter also make sense (if you look close,<br/>\n&gt; you&#39;ll see that RunnerFilter implementations can also re-order<br/>\n&gt; runners, as well as selecting them).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Please have fun, and let us know how it works for you.  Thanks,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;    David Saff<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
