I&#39;m still tweaking the mappings so it could be the problem\nis there\n\n[zip]\n\n&gt; So you are storing test data in a database? Interesting. How many \n&gt; records? Do you really need to test every record? or just a \n&gt; representative set of records? What if there are 1000 records that all \n&gt; test the same essential code path?\n\nI am testing the migration of _data_ from one database to another. Maybe\nI wasn&#39;t clear on that point.\nFor example, I want to check that customers in the new schema are still related to\nthe same orders as in the old schema. \n\nI want to check every record for several reasons:\n-once the test is written, it&#39;s the same to apply it to all records or\nto selected records (hibernate iteration)\n-I already have found a minor problem occuring with 3 records out of\n85000\n-I want to be sure the data transposition is really as expected :-)\n\n\nMy question about the organisation of the tests is that I feel like all\ntests are first added to the suite, and are run only after all tests\nhave been added. Am I wrong on that? If it runs as I said, adding all\n10^6 tests to test the whole database could be the reason of an out of\nmemory problem (all objects to be tested would be in memory, which means\nthe whole db would be loaded in memory). It&#39;s just a guess, just trying\nto understand (I could be completely wrong actually ;-)\n\nRaph\n\n\n\n",
