So I cer=\r\ntainly see the point about the interaction issue.\n\nMy preference is still f=\r\nor the one Suite class because I just see it as a natural way to build a su=\r\nite, but I don&#39;t know that I have a specific argument in favor of it.\n\n--- =\r\nIn junit@yahoogroups.com, David Saff &lt;david@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; That&#39;s good fee=\r\ndback.  While I agree that one runner with two\n&gt; mechanisms sounds simpler =\r\nthan two runners with one mechanism each, I\n&gt; also think that when you have=\r\n two mechanisms, you have to address\n&gt; their interaction, which can lead to=\r\n user confusion.  Did you log a\n&gt; feature request?

I suppose it could be called a DynamicSuite, or SuiteMethodRunner. =\r\nI&#39;m just not sure that it adds anything.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Certainly from the user pe=\r\nrspective I would see it as more intuitive to have one @RunWith(Suite.class=\r\n) annotation with some variations on how to set up the suite rather than ha=\r\nve two different runners and have to understand which one to use when.\n&gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; --- In junit@yahoogroups.com, David Saff &lt;david@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Sorr=\r\ny for the long delay in response.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; This is a good idea, I think. =\r\n=A0I wonder if it needs to be in the same\n&gt; &gt;&gt; runner as Suite, or could it=\r\n be a different Runner?\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =A0 =A0David Saff\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; On Wed, Feb 2=\r\n5, 2009 at 10:34 AM, yme0987654321 &lt;yme0987654321@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I have th=\r\ne following challenge, with a proposed solution. If there is\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; interes=\r\nt, I would be happy to contribute a patch to the JUnit project\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; to ad=\r\ndress it. On the other hand, if there is a way to solve this\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; problem=\r\n differently in JUnit already, please let me know.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Ant and ID=\r\nEA (the IDE from Intellij) don&#39;t agree on how to gather\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; classes for =\r\ntest. IDEA inspects the actual class for things that\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; extend TestCase=\r\n or have a JUnit annotation on the class (or have a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; static suite met=\r\nhod) and executes the test. Ant gathers tests via\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; class names. To us=\r\ne the Ant method with JUnit outside of Ant, you can\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; use JUnitCore, a=\r\nnd just pass it an array of classes gathered in the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Ant form. Howeve=\r\nr IDEA doesn&#39;t report those results in its typical\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; fashion. It uses =\r\nits own custom runner to gather and run these tests.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; The only=\r\n option I see in the JUnit current code is to make a custom\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; runner t=\r\nhat knows how to extract a Class[] array and pass it on to the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; stand=\r\nard runner, and then use the RunWith tag to annotate an arbitrary\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; cl=\r\nass to get IDEA to think that it is running a test suite. I haven&#39;t\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\nactually done this to see if IDEA has any issues, but it seems like it\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; should work.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; My proposal is to add an annotation to the Su=\r\nite class called\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; SuiteMethod that would annotate a method that retur=\r\nns a Class[] array.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; The Suite would then be built from the two annot=\r\nations,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Suite.SuiteClasses plus any methods on the class (we could e=\r\nnforce\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; that they be public, static, take no parameters and return a =\r\nClass[]\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; array) that are annotated with Suite.SuiteMethod and build t=\r\nhe Suite\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; as a combination of all of the Arrays returned.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; What do you think?\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
