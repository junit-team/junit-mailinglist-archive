How can you prove to your project lead that your \nexisting test bed is exhaustive?  \n\nI, personally, would like this myself, not as a measure of correctness,\nbut as reassurance that I at least exercized everything at least once.\nIf I leave something untested, it will stand out in the metric as untested.\nIt may also point to unused/deprecated code which is a nuke candidate.\n\nI agree with your lead. ;)\n\nI haven&#39;t taken the time to glance at this more than briefly, but I\ncertainly don&#39;t consider conditional writes a useful solution.  I&#39;d go\nthe JProbe or profiler route using a JVM which supports it.\n\nHeck, look at Runtime.traceMethodCalls().  Find a JVM which does it,\nturn it on inside your test harness, and parse the logs afterwards.\n\n-- \nJoi Ellis                    Software Engineer\nAravox Technologies          joi@..., gyles19@...\n\nNo matter what we think of Linux versus FreeBSD, etc., the one thing I\nreally like about Linux is that it has Microsoft worried.
