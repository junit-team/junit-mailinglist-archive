I think it has several \n&gt; advantages:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. It makes it similar to TestCase\n&gt; 2. It makes it easier for QA engineers, who may not feel \ncomfortable \n&gt; with a decorator like TestSetup (no offense meant to QA engineers \nwho \n&gt; do)\n&gt; 3. Sometimes you need to access the suite in the composite after \nit \n&gt; was wrapped in TestSetup.\n\nThe first design principle of xUnit (good or bad) is independence of \ntests. TestSetup is a step away from that, which I regret. The need \nfor shared setup is IME always a design problem. Solving it by \nwriting tests differently is the first step on a slippery slope to \nmaking the tests less valuable to programmers.\n\nKent\n\n\n",
