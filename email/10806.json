Any shared variable you<br/>\n&gt; want your tests to<br/>\n&gt; access should usually go into the setUp() method. <br/>\n&gt; In your case it<br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t look like it&#39;s affecting your test, but for<br/>\n&gt; future reference<br/>\n&gt; this habit could cause errors that are very<br/>\n&gt; difficult to track down --<br/>\n&gt; eg. static variables in a test.  (If you want more<br/>\n&gt; info. on this let me<br/>\n&gt; know and I will start a new thread.)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; my assertion is failing <br/>\n&gt; &gt; when the method testRegisterDuplicatedUser() is<br/>\n&gt; executed. Can <br/>\n&gt; &gt; somebody tell me why?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You will need to be more specific.  Where is the<br/>\n&gt; failure?  Is it on the<br/>\n&gt; first assertion of that method or the second?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; This is my first post to this forum. Is this the<br/>\n&gt; right forum to ask <br/>\n&gt; &gt; such questions? <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This is the place.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -- <br/>\n&gt; Jason Rogers<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;Where there is no vision, the people perish...&quot;<br/>\n&gt; Bible, Proverbs 29:18<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
