This way one can:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Use an alternative third-party annotation, such as javax.annotation.concurrent.ThreadSafe from libraries like com.google.code.findbugs:jsr305:1.3.9 and com.google.code.findbugs:annotations:2.0.1.<br/>\n2. Define a private annotation, without adding _any_ additional dependency.<br/>\n<br/>\nI use javax.annotation.concurrent.ThreadSafe quite a lot in my own code, so (1) is quite important from my perspective. There are precedents for this approach: IIRC, Eclipse does something like this for variations on @Nullable and @Nonnull, whereas (again, IIRC) Findbugs handles two instances of @SuppressWarnings.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\nStephan<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, Kevin Cooney  wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hello, everyone<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Short version: we are thinking of adding an optional dependency from JUnit<br/>\n&gt; to jcip-annotations and are soliciting feedback.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; A few people have noticed that when you use ParallelComputer, you got poor<br/>\n&gt; performance because calls to registered RunListeners are synchronized. We<br/>\n&gt; would like to fix this in the next release of JUnit.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In order to prevent affecting existing users, we are proposing having an<br/>\n&gt; annotation that can be added to RunListener implementations that can safely<br/>\n&gt; be called concurrently from multiple threads. If a RunListener passed to a<br/>\n&gt; RunNotifier is not annotated with this annotation, JUnit will wrap it with<br/>\n&gt; a decorator that does synchronization.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We would appreciate feedback on this new annotation.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We have two options:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; a. Create our own annotation for this<br/>\n&gt; b. Use ThreadSafe (<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://grepcode.com/file/repo1.maven.org/maven2/net.jcip/jcip-annotations/1.0/net/jcip/annotations/ThreadSafe.java\">http://grepcode.com/file/repo1.maven.org/maven2/net.jcip/jcip-annotations/1.0/net/jcip/annotations/ThreadSafe.java</a><br/>\n&gt; )<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The advantages to option b are:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 1. It&#39;s a well-known annotation<br/>\n&gt; 2. Users that use JUnit can add this annotation to their thread-safe<br/>\n&gt; RunListener implementations today and get the benefits &quot;for free&quot; later.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Note we can do this without requiring that all users of JUnit have the<br/>\n&gt; jcip-annotations jar in their classpath as of JDK 1.5.0_06 (see<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3567413/why-doesnt-a-missing-annotation-cause-a-classnotfoundexception-at-runtime)\">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3567413/why-doesnt-a-missing-annotation-cause-a-classnotfoundexception-at-runtime)</a>.<br/>\n&gt; If jcip-annotations is not on the classpath then all RunListener<br/>\n&gt; implementations will be treated as not thread-safe.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; As a specific example, the Maven Surefire plugin would use this dependency<br/>\n&gt; and include jcip-annotations.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Currently, JUnit only depends on one third-party library (Hamcrest). This<br/>\n&gt; has caused us some pain in the past when the Hamcrest code changed in ways<br/>\n&gt; that broke existing users of JUnit. We believe this will not be an issue<br/>\n&gt; with jcip-annotations because the JAR only contains annotations, not any<br/>\n&gt; code.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; One possible concern would be with other open source libraries that provide<br/>\n&gt; RunListener implementations (they would need to add jcip-annotations to<br/>\n&gt; their compile-time classpath if they have thread-safe annotations, and<br/>\n&gt; document this to their users).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thoughts?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -- Kevin<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
