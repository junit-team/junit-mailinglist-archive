B. Rainsberger &lt;jbr@...&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; If I test your implementation rather than just checking the SQL\n&gt;&gt; string, then I have to run that [taking a lot of time] OR I simply\n&gt;&gt; don&#39;t run those tests. (If I knew ahead of time what would break,\nthen\n&gt;&gt; I wouldn&#39;t want to run all the tests all the time, but I don&#39;t, so I\n&gt;&gt; do.)\n&gt;\n&gt;I read this as you suggesting that you want to run all the tests and\n&gt;have reasonable coverage, but you don&#39;t want to run the SQL code. That\n&gt;makes no sense to me; if you&#39;re not running the SQL code, you&#39;re not\n&gt;testing it.\n\nYou&#39;re right. I&#39;m not testing that the SQL code is correct because:\n\n(1) Continually testing it is expensive, and\n(2) I tested it at least once, and\n(3) Re-testing it only finds bugs in either the environment or the\nunderlying database management system\n\nRemember that part of the point of these tests is to enable me to make\nchanges and see the consequences of those things. That way I am\naggressive and make changes without fear of unknowingly breaking some\npart of the system.\n\nIf I don&#39;t change the DBMS nor the operating environment, then the SQL\nstatements, once correct, cannot break. They become a &quot;golden master&quot;\nagainst which I can continue to compare as needed.\n\nBetter would be to have some in-memory SQL syntax/semantics checker\nthat worked against my database schema, simulated the statements and\nensured that they continue to make sense. Failing that, I choose to\naccept the risk that my SQL statements suddenly stop working, even if I\ndon&#39;t change them.\n\nBut like I said, if I move all the SQL statements into one place, I can\neasily write a simple test to verify those statements against the\ndatabase. I can run that test less frequently, thus avoiding the\noverhead of running them all the time.\n\n&gt;Proving that the SQL code compares to some arbitrary string\n&gt;is not at all the same thing as saying that, when executed, it does\nthe\n&gt;right thing in the context of the application, and the surrounding\nJava\n&gt;code that uses the result of that SQL statement does the right thing.\n\nBut once I verify that the SQL statements are correct, if I don&#39;t\nchange them, they never stop working. (My assumptions are listed\nabove.)\n\n&gt;In other words, it sounds like you&#39;re not testing the entire\napplication\n&gt;at all. You&#39;re just hoping the SQL will work, rather than proving it\nby\n&gt;actually executing it and verifying the results.\n\nNo, I think I either misspoke or you misread. See the above.\n\n&gt;(And as I said, the tests do not take nearly as long as you&#39;ve\n&gt;suggested, if you set things up properly. There are lots of tricks,\nsuch\n&gt;as using very small sets of sample data for the unit tests, that help\n&gt;keep things moving quickly.)\n\nI agree; however, now my tests depend on the database. I don&#39;t want my\nPTs to depend on such an expensive resource. My CTs or some mid-level\nintegration tests, perhaps; but not my PTs. That&#39;s not the role they\nplay.\n\nI hope that the above make my position clearer.\n\n\nJ. B.
