I liked Bob Martin&#39;s analogy of double entry<br/>\n&gt; bookkeeping, and this may be part of the confusion. As far as I know, it<br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t matter whether the credit is put into the books first, or the<br/>\n&gt; debit is done first. The value of the practice is that both entries have<br/>\n&gt; to be done, and both must match. We do some test first, and some test<br/>\n&gt; second, but everything gets tested.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;snip&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This back and forth approach seems natural, it reduced context switching<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; in the design/implement domain, and seems to work well.

But TDD is not only (not even mostly)<br/>\nabout testedness. It is also about design.<br/>\n<br/>\nA TDD&#39;d design is typically more testable than the code-first design because<br/>\nit was written with the test in mind.<br/>\n<br/>\nKevin<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
