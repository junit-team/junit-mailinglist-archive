RE: Test Coverage Analysis\n&gt; To ol For Junit\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; From: &lt;carlos.manzanares@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; I think what we are all afraid is of Steve&#39;s statement: &quot;If \n&gt; you&#39;re really\n&gt; &gt; writing code test-first you should find that you hit 98-99% \n&gt; coverage without\n&gt; &gt; breaking into a sweat.&quot; I have never liked imposed coverage \n&gt; percentages\n&gt; &gt; because not all the applications can be covered in the same \n&gt; way (some\n&gt; &gt; applications are very easy to be covered and some others \n&gt; are impossible),\n&gt; &gt; and because usually the developers start to trick with the \n&gt; tests just to get\n&gt; &gt; that percentages (and usually that tricks are not very \n&gt; &quot;quality-oriented&quot;\n&gt; &gt; and at the end they are a waste of time)\n&gt; \n&gt; I think we&#39;ve misunderstood something here. I was not \n&gt; proposing full coverage as a requirement or anything like \n&gt; that. My point was that one of the effects of writing code \n&gt; test-first (where you shouldn&#39;t write code without a test to \n&gt; drive it) is that you get full coverage &quot;for free&quot;. Just run \n&gt; the tool from time to time to look for occasional slip-ups \n&gt; and stop worrying about it.\n&gt; We all know that coverage, in itself, does not prove that \n&gt; you&#39;ve executed every possible path, just as unit tests do \n&gt; not _prove_ that your code has no errors, but it gets you a \n&gt; lot of the way there.\n&gt; \n&gt; Steve\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
