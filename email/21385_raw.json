Selenium seems to be\n&gt; nice, since it allows someone without much (or none at all)\n&gt; programming experience, as our Product Owner to create those tests\n&gt; with Firefox Selenium IDE plug-in.\n&gt;\n&gt; But time has come to integrate those tests to other JUnit tests, so\n&gt; these can be run on CI server.\n&gt;\n&gt; Is there any know-how or link which could help. I already visited\n&gt; mavenium (http://mavenium.sourceforge.net/index.html) and\n&gt; maven2-selenium plug-in\n&gt; site(http://mojo.codehaus.org/selenium-maven-plugin/index.html), but\n&gt; documentation is not quite clear, or at least I couldn&#39;t run my tests.\n&gt;\n&gt; As I understood, selenium-rc should run automatically if defined in\n&gt; pom.xml and then Selenium JUnit tests should run fine. What about\n&gt; jetty? Is it run implicitly, or some server should be run? If not\n&gt; automatically, should it be run manually? In this case CI doesn&#39;t make\n&gt; sense, since you have to deploy application to some other server.\n&gt;\n&gt; Huh...too many questions, I guess. I would be happy to have at least\n&gt; some answers.\n\n\nIn general, we much prefer Selenium Core to Selenium RC (which we had used\nfor a while).  You can write all your Selenium Core tests in JUnit and\nthey&#39;ll run in the browsers.  We even run our Se Core tests in parallel for\nmaximum speed.\n\nWe started an eLearning album called Mastering Selenium, yet we aren&#39;t very\nfar along on it.  When it gets more mature, you could check it out, if you\nlike.   Just ping me about it.\n\n-- \nbest regards,\njk\n\nIndustrial Logic, Inc.\nJoshua Kerievsky\nFounder, Extreme Programmer & Coach\nhttp://industriallogic.com\n866-540-8336 (toll free)\n510-540-8336 (phone)\nBerkeley, California\n\nLearn Code Smells, Refactoring and TDD at\nhttp://industriallogic.com/elearning\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
