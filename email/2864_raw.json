What was involved?\n\nI don&#39;t think that it was done and I was wondering if an internationalized JUnit can add much value.  A nice to have but certainly not a top priority.\n\nIt could be interesting to know if people find it difficult to use JUnit because of the language.  To evangelize, you sometimes have to speak the language of your listeners :-)\n\nIf the internationalization is decided I can provide a French translation.\n\n-Vladimir\n\n\n\n",
