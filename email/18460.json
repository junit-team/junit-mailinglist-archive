You can just<br/>\n&gt; use reflection to pick up all of the methods on a test case class that<br/>\n&gt; accept and return void and treat them as tests.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>True, that.  I&#39;ve invited Steve to contribute a custom runner for<br/>\nJUnit 4 that does just that.  There&#39;s two specific problems with the<br/>\nsuggestion:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) JUnit 4 allows test cases to inherit from domain classes, sometimes<br/>\na useful trick when migrating legacy code, which would break using<br/>\nthis scheme.<br/>\n2) We would then need to annotate classes, or packages, or something,<br/>\nto indicate which classes should be used as tests, to allow nifty test<br/>\nrunners like ant or Eclipse to work their automagic.<br/>\n<br/>\nNeither of these is a death knell to the idea.  But I&#39;m still afraid<br/>\nof introducing &quot;punning&quot; like this by default.  As an example, Ruby&#39;s<br/>\ntest::unit, by default, automatically picks up any loaded subclass of<br/>\nTestCase (wouldn&#39;t _that_ be lovely) and runs it.  But doing so makes<br/>\nthe Abstract Test Case pattern unusable.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo far, this is mostly justification of conservatism, so I&#39;m open to<br/>\nfurther opinionating.<br/>\n<br/>\n   David Saff</div>",
