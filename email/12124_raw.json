I agree with you \nthat it depends on the degree of oupling between methods. Also, I \nthink that the number of unit test cases will determine the effort \nrequired. \n\nHowever, can I come up with an estimate by making some assumptions. \nFor eg: the number of parameters required for each method to invoke. \n\nAt the granular level i.e per test case per method, is it possible to \ncome up with lines of code (LOC) for JUnit code. If so what are the \nparameters on which the LOC for a particular test case depends on. \nThis muct include teh mock classes also. \n\nAny help is appreciated. \n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;J.

There is no \n&gt; published generic methodology (like COCOMO) for estimating the \neffort of \n&gt; adding tests that I&#39;m aware of.\n&gt; \n&gt; The best I can suggest is to conduct some experiments. See how much \nof \n&gt; the system you can test in a week. This will give you a rough idea, \nat \n&gt; any rate. Even then, it is possible that you&#39;ll find a refactoring \nin \n&gt; week three that makes the rest of the system much, much easier to \ntest. \n&gt; That is more likely than the reverse -- in other words, the cost of \n&gt; testing a system tends to go down as you cover more of the system \nwith \n&gt; tests. (This is a slight simplification, but it&#39;s true enough for \nyou at \n&gt; this moment.)\n&gt; -- \n&gt; J. B.
