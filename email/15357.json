David, why do you think using constraints<br/>\n&gt; &gt; is heavy weight?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Constraint in JMock has two abstract methods: eval and describeTo.<br/>\n&gt; Describe is really cool, because it allows, basically for free, error<br/>\n&gt; messages like:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; junit.framework.AssertionFailedError:<br/>\n&gt; Expected: not (eq(&lt;a bad sentence&gt;) or a string containing &quot;a bad word&quot;)<br/>\n&gt; but got : This is a bad word<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On the other hand, it can double the amount of work for each<br/>\n&gt; implementing class. I&#39;m still split on whether this is worth it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This is actually a lot different than saying &quot;Constraints are heavy<br/>\n&gt; weight&quot;. It may be the same thing as saying &quot;it&#39;s not yet quite clear<br/>\n&gt; what the perfect definition of assertThat is&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Do you mean that constraints &#39;double the amount of work for each<br/>\nimplementing class&#39; because you have to implement two methods instead of<br/>\none? If so, I don&#39;t think that this is much of a problem since you won&#39;t<br/>\nwrite new constraints too often - their power comes from their ability to be<br/>\ncombined after all.</div>",
