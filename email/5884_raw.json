After \n  searching thru documentation, this news group and other sources, some \n  issues still remain that I hope some of you can help answer.\n\n      1. We have a need to put some trace messages in the tests so as \n  to know the progress of the test itself because each test can be \n  fairly timeconsuming. Is there a way to have these capture this \n  output for an individual test in the GUI-based TestRunner? I see only \n  thing that is captured for each test on the UI are the assertion \n  failures. \n\n      2. I see that JUnitReport is used quite extensively with Ant. \n  From what I learnt reading, it helps output TestResult in XML format \n  and then one can translate it using XSLT. Know how one can use that \n  without having to use Ant? Any resources on Net would be helpful.\n\n     3. I see JUnit is great for nesting sub-suites within a suite and \n  thereby creating a tree of suites. But when it comes to test results, \n  is there a way to get a breakup of which sub-suite had how many \n  failures from TestResult?\n\n\n  Thanks in advance,\n  Vern\n\n     \n\n\n\n  To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n  junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n\n\n  Your use of Yahoo!
