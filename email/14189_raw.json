Does \n&gt; anyone have more\n&gt; &gt; information?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I couldn&#39;t find any specific information but the second link on this \n&gt; page sounds like a candidate.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; BTW this test ....\n&gt; \n&gt; public void testZeroMoniesAreEqualRegardlessOfCurrency() {\n&gt;    Money zeroDollars = new Money(0, &quot;USD&quot;);\n&gt;    Money zeroFrancs = new Money(0, &quot;CHF&quot;);\n&gt; \t\t\n&gt;    assertEquals(zeroDollars, zeroFrancs);\n&gt;    assertEquals(zeroDollars.hashCode(), zeroFrancs.hashCode());\n&gt; }\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ... would increase the coverage of the equals method and \n&gt; fails because \n&gt; equals() special cases zero but hashCode() does not.\n&gt; \n&gt; I found this bug with my company&#39;s tool ;-)\n&gt; \n&gt; Kevin\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo!
