Let&#39;s call it\nresearch.\n\nI&#39;ve just completed a set of interviews and looking back on the coding\nquestions.  I realized that I never followed my test first mantra that\nI perform at home.\n\nFirst question, to those giving the interview... Would you ever\nsuggest/remind a candidate of TDD style in his/her code?\n\nSecond question, why on earth does a candidate, like myself, forget to\nwrite tests and incrementally improve their code?  Do this show a lack\nof software development maturity?\n\nAs a community reminder, and to myself.... don&#39;t forget TDD style on interviews.\n\n",
