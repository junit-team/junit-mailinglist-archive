Seemed like a \n&gt; good idea at while Old Nick was explaining them, but now \n&gt; the bill is coming due and the benefits are not worth the \n&gt; cost. That&#39;s just our opinion, but there you have it.\n&gt; \nHmmm, so if the code is self-describing, how do I know whether it \nmight throw an unchecked exception? Comments will go out of sync, and \nthe more components I bolt together, the more I have to chase through \nthe details of the logic to see if I&#39;ve covered everything. \nIntegrating other people&#39;s libraries that use a different exception \nconvention can be a pig.\n\nAs always with Java, they took a useful idea and didn&#39;t quite finish \nit. In the Modula world, they had a much easier syntax for catching \nmultiple possible exceptions and a FATAL pragma for ignoring a given \nexception type within a compilation scope. Small change, but it made \na difference. They also had well-organised libraries so you didn&#39;t \nhave to specify all the exceptions in the world.\n\nIf we must have static typing, then let the compiler do the work -- \nand let&#39;s have the tools take advantage of it. Static typing may be a \npain, but it does give you code completion. Similarly, there&#39;s no \nreason that an IDE cannot assist with the management of declared \nexceptions.\n\nSteve\n\n\n\n",
