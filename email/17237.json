I think the Stream abstraction is really elegant and<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; much prefer to work with it than directly with files.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  No reason we can&#39;t have both.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>While that is true I don&#39;t feel constrained having only one.<br/>\nI see very limited additional value of a method like that. But hey,<br/>\nthat is just me, I would certainly not suffer if it was there unless I<br/>\nwas in a project where someone used it in a place where<br/>\nStreams/Readers would be a better choice, which in my book is the<br/>\nmajority of situations.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Also, why do I have to write that loop every time? How often have you<br/>\n&gt;  wanted to read only one line from that BufferedReader? Where the hell is<br/>\n&gt;  BufferedReader.readLines() that returns an array or List of lines?!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I have never (as far as I remember) wanted to read just one line from<br/>\nthe reader but I typically process them one at the time so I might<br/>\naswell do that /while/ reading from the stream rather than read all<br/>\nlines from the stream into memory and /then/ loop through the strings<br/>\nto process them one at the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course sometimes I don&#39;t care about lines at all...<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  &gt; Of course, that is just one mans opinion that may change after working<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; with Ruby,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  That&#39;s always possible.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Indeed<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers!<br/>\n/Joakim Ohlrogge</div>",
