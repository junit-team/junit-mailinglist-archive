A separate directory tree with a root note of test, \n&gt; the package\n&gt; &gt; structure of\n&gt; &gt;       which reflects that of the codebase; keep the tests completely\n&gt; &gt; isolated from\n&gt; &gt;       production code, the downside being that if I refactor code\n&gt; &gt; around packages,\n&gt; &gt;       I have to remember to move tests as well; also, removes my\n&gt; &gt; ability to test\n&gt; &gt;       private and protected methods..\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Just to clarify, classes within the same package can access each\n&gt; other&#39;s protected methods.  So, the limitation will only be on testing\n&gt; private methods with this approach.  Personally, I use this approach.\n&gt; \n&gt; Mike\n&gt; \n&gt; =====\n&gt; Mike Clark\n&gt; Clarkware Consulting, Inc.\n&gt; Custom Software Architecture, Design, \n&gt; Development, and Performance Consulting\n&gt; http://www.clarkware.com\n&gt; \n&gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; Get personalized email addresses from Yahoo!
