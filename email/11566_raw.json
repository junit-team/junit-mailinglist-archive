Seems whenever \nsomeone complains about some peculiarity of TestSuite, that suddenly \nit&#39;s in the same category as the runners.\n\nWhat constitutes the &quot;framework&quot;?  Just the Test interface (that would \nprobably be the absolute minimum)? I keep getting the impression here \nthat anything anyone is unhappy with is &quot;not really part of the \nframework, you should write your own if you don&#39;t like it&quot;, as opposed \nto a positive definition which states what is part of the framework, \nwhy, and why it needs to never be changed.\n\n  I hate hearing the implication &quot;the code never changes so it must be \nreally good code&quot;.   The only thing that unchanging code implies is \nthat no one has changed it.\n\n\n",
