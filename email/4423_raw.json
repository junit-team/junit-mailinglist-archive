I got tied up really bad with the project I am working on.\n\nAnyhow, I finally got the problem fixed. Initially I had some \nproblems with it because I am using ANT, but I figured out WHY I was \nhaving the problem and resolved it. Here&#39;s what I did:\n\n1) Installed ANT and configured accordingly (remember to install the \n   option tasks jar as well).\n2) Installed JUnit.\n   2.1) Copied junit.jar to $ANT_HOME/lib so that &lt;junit&gt; optional\n        task would work.\n   2.2) Copied junit.jar to $APP_HOME/lib, which is where I store all\n        of my 3rd party jars, that way JUnit would work with forked\n        processes from ANT.\n   2.3) Extracted the file excluded.properties from junit.jar into \n        $APP_HOME/lib and added entries for org.w3c.dom.* and \n        org.xml.sax.*\n3) Updated my ANT scripts to make sure that my &lt;junit&gt; task had \n   fork=&quot;yes&quot; in its attributes.\n4) Updated my ANT scripts so that the &lt;classpath&gt; referenced by my \n   &lt;junit&gt; task included $APP_HOME/lib/excluded.properties before \n   anything else.\n\nI like this approach because it means I can leave the original \njunit.jar intact and I can add new elements to the file without \nhaving to constantly update the JAR file. \n\nThe gotcha I was running into was with the fork=&quot;yes&quot; attribute on \nthe &lt;junit&gt; task. I think this may have been caused by ANT having \nalready loaded the XML bits so running JUnit in the same JVM instance \nmay have been problematic. Before I added that attribute I could \noutput the excluded property&#39;s contents and would see the entries for \norg.w3c.dom.* and org.xml.sax.*, but I kept getting the same error... \nNow that I&#39;ve added that attribute the only exceptions I&#39;m getting \nare from my own code.... which means.... I&#39;m back to the grind... :)\n\nThanks,\n\nSam W.\n\n\n--- In junit@y..., &quot;numbsafari&quot; &lt;numbsafari@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Another idea would be to update the FAQ so that this particular \n&gt; problem could be more readily associated with the FAQ that provides \n&gt; the answer.\n&gt; \n&gt; Right now the title is: &quot;I get a ClassNotFoundException when I use \n&gt; the LoadingTestRunner&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; The title should be: &quot;Why do I am I having problems with Third \nParty \n&gt; JAR files (ClassNotFoundException/LinkageError)?&quot; Or something \n&gt; similar. Neither qingfenglin or myself received a \n&gt; ClassNotFoundException, we received LinkageError&#39;s....\n&gt; \n&gt; Actually, I don&#39;t mean to be a critic, but the documentation for \n&gt; J/Unit really sucks. I know, I know... if I don&#39;t like it I should \ndo \n&gt; better... Well, I&#39;ve only been using J/Unit for a couple of days \nnow \n&gt; so I&#39;m not prepared yet to write docs. As I get more involved with \nit \n&gt; I definately plan on putting together a couple of HOWTO&#39;s.. until \n&gt; then, I&#39;d just like to say that the docs are horrible. Great \nproduct \n&gt; (from what I&#39;ve seen so far), horrible documentation.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sam W.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In junit@y..., Scott Stirling &lt;sstirling@m...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Holy FAQ, Batman!  Think we should fix this bug?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If the JUnit maintainers added org.xml.sax.* and org.w3c.dom.* to \n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; default excluded.properties this question would be asked a lot \n&gt; less, and\n&gt; &gt; users wouldn&#39;t have to point out the FAQ/archives.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Seriously, that&#39;s the problem.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Vladimir?  Others?  Has anyone thought of ways to fix this via \n&gt; refactoring?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I have one idea:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1. Make JUnit use a different repository source for its \n&gt; TestCaseClasLoader,\n&gt; &gt; much like the way that most app servers allow dynamic reloading \nof \n&gt; JSPs and\n&gt; &gt; Servlets into a custom classloader by _not_ having the custom \n&gt; classloader\n&gt; &gt; use the system classpath.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Scott Stirling\n&gt; &gt; JRun QA\n&gt; &gt; Macromedia\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: qingfenglin@y... [mailto:qingfenglin@y...]\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I was trying to use Junit to test a simple XML program as \n&gt; following:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n=================================================================\n&gt; &gt; &gt; public void testNewInstance() throws Exception{\n&gt; &gt; &gt;        DocumentBuilderFactory dbf = \n&gt; DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ();\n&gt; &gt; &gt;        DocumentBuilder db = dbf.newDocumentBuilder();\n&gt; &gt; &gt;        Document doc = db.newDocument();\n&gt; &gt; &gt;        doc.createElement(&quot;test&quot;);\n&gt; &gt; &gt;    }\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ==============================================================\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; If I used the Text interface to run the use case, the test is \nOK, \n&gt; but \n&gt; &gt; &gt; if I use GUI interface, I got the exception as following:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; java.lang.LinkageError: Class org/w3c/dom/Document violates \n&gt; Loader \n&gt; &gt; &gt; constraint\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ..\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ..\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ..\n&gt; &gt; &gt; at junit.runner.TestCaseLoader.loadClass\n(TestCaseClassLoader.java \n&gt; 104)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ..\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Is that consider as a bug of JUnit?\n\n\n",
