Typically, strong chess players \n&gt; are quite capable of sizing up most situations and acting \n&gt; accordingly.\n\n&quot;Sizing up situations&quot; isn&#39;t exactly it. If they have to &quot;size it up&quot;, then it&#39;s not a configuration they are use to which is what I mean. My point was that a game of chess is also a finite state machine--there are innumerable configurations that you cannot get to in a real game of chess. An expert chess player doesn&#39;t have to &quot;size up&quot; a game in progress because they&#39;ve been there before already many times.\n\nI&#39;m thinking similarly that TDD is an FSM as suggested. Similarly, there are innumerable configurations that you cannot get to with TDD.\n\nUnderstanding--expertise--within a finite state machine allows a person within that machine to know what to next automatically when presented with code that is inside that FSM.\n\nThis could be a significant argument that TDD code is significantly more maintainable (outside of other obvious reasons) because any expert in the TDD FSM would be able to immediately pick up where someone else left without missing a beat.\n\nThis applies to expertise in general... have to do some more thinking about this.\n\nJoel Shellman\n\n\n\n",
