And, I wouldn&#39;t think you&#39;d average more than three tests per method\nto be tested. \n\n\tSo, given your example, to have a test class with 500 tests, the\nclass being tested would have to have nearly 200 methods, which seems like\nan awful lot for a single class! I could see how having perhaps 100 tests in\na test class would be possible, but that would be to test a rather sizable\nclass. Also, chances are the code for the entire test class would be smaller\nthan the code for the class being tested, which would make it a bit more\nmanagable.\n\n\tSo, I&#39;d say if you&#39;ve got that many test methods floating about, you\nmay want to think about breaking up your classes somewhat. However, there&#39;s\nnothing that says you can&#39;t create multiple test classes to test a single\nclass, then come up with some way to divvy up your tests (all null tests go\nin one class, etc.). \n\n\t-tim\n\n\tp.s. I don&#39;t see how the example you provided really helps matters.\nYes, you&#39;ve managed to reduce the number of methods, but not the overall\nsize of the test code.\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Parag Shetye [mailto:parag@...]\nSent: Tuesday, August 21, 2001 1:04 AM\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: [junit] A Growing Problem\n\n\nA Growing Problem\n\nThe typical way of handling test cases in JUnit is to create a class\nwith methods beginning with &quot;test&quot;. For example, we could create the\nmethods testNullAccount() and testEmptyAccount() to handle cases where\nthe account object is null and empty, respectively. This approach is\nsatisfactory for a few test cases, but what if the number of test cases\ngrows to 50 or even 500? It seems that there is always another test case\nI should test for. Having this many methods becomes unmanageable. The\nsituation gets ugly.\n\nYou might work around this limitation by placing all test cases and\nassert statements sequentially inside a single method. This approach\nsuffers from two limitations. The first limitation is the need to\nreplicate the test code for every test case. Even if you have only two\nor three lines of code per test case, the size of the method will\nmushroom and become hard to maintain (and read). See example below (\nTaken from JavaPro ) -\n\npublic void testCreateBatchLabelNoInnerClass() {\n\n   try {\n      BatchLabel aBatchLabel = new BatchLabel(\n         &quot;20010530&quot;,  &quot;A13&quot;,  &quot;1&quot; );\n      assert ( aBatchLabel.getBatchLabel().equals(\n         &quot;A13-1 EXP. 05/01&quot; ) ) ;\n   } catch (Exception e) {\n      assert ( &quot;Exception:&quot; + e, false );\n   }\n\n   try {\n      BatchLabel aBatchLabel = new BatchLabel(\n         &quot;20010530&quot;,  &quot;A13&quot;,  &quot;&quot; );\n      assert ( aBatchLabel.getBatchLabel().equals(\n         &quot;A13 EXP. 05/01&quot; ) ) ;\n   } catch (Exception e) {\n      assert ( &quot;Exception:&quot; + e, false );\n   }\n\n   try {\n      BatchLabel aBatchLabel = new BatchLabel(\n         &quot;20011231&quot;,  &quot;A13&quot;,  &quot;1&quot; );\n      assert ( aBatchLabel.getBatchLabel().equals(\n         &quot;A13-1 EXP. 12/01&quot; ) ) ;\n   } catch (Exception e) {\n      assert ( &quot;Exception:&quot; + e, false );\n   }\n\n   try {\n      BatchLabel aBatchLabel = new BatchLabel(\n         &quot;20010101&quot;,  &quot;A13&quot;,  &quot;1&quot; );\n      assert ( aBatchLabel.getBatchLabel().equals(\n         &quot;A13-1 EXP. 01/01&quot; ) ) ;\n   } catch (Exception e) {\n      assert ( &quot;Exception:&quot; + e, false );\n   }\n\n   try {\n      BatchLabel aBatchLabel = new BatchLabel(\n         &quot;20010101&quot;,  &quot;A123&quot;, &quot;99&quot; );\n      assert ( aBatchLabel.getBatchLabel().equals(\n         &quot;A123-99 EXP. 01/01&quot; ) ) ;\n   } catch (Exception e) {\n      assert ( &quot;Exception:&quot; + e, false );\n   }\n\n   try {\n      BatchLabel aBatchLabel = new BatchLabel(\n         &quot;2001530&quot;,   &quot;A999&quot;, &quot;&quot; );\n   } catch (Exception e) {\n      assert( &quot;Wrong Exception thrown: &quot; + e,\n         e.getClass().equals(\n         BadDateException.class )) ;\n   }\n\n   try {\n      BatchLabel aBatchLabel = new BatchLabel(\n         &quot;20010530&quot;,   &quot;913&quot;, &quot;1&quot; );\n   } catch (Exception e) {\n      assert( &quot;Wrong Exception thrown: &quot; + e,\n         e.getClass().equals(\n         BadLotException.class )) ;\n   }\n\n   // etc\n\n}\n\nThe second limitation is that JUnit will stop the testing after the\nfirst failure-the remaining test cases won&#39;t be executed.\n\nWhat can be the solution on these two limitations?\n\n\n--\n_______________________________________________________________\nParag Shetye\nQA - Savvion Inc.\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\njunit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n \n\nYour use of Yahoo!
