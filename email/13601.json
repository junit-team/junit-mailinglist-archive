The differences in behaviour between Oracle <br/>\nand HSQLDB would make the tests somewhat worthless...<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I would do instead is aim at having a core number of integration tests <br/>\nwhich test a well-defined facade over the database, along with lots of unit <br/>\ntests which use an in-memory version of the facade.
