It seems to me that you <br/>\n&gt; can do this <br/>\n&gt; &gt; kind of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; validation in a @BeforeClass in JUnit 4. Would that solve <br/>\n&gt; your problem?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Not so easily in this case.  This is a validation that is run <br/>\n&gt; before any <br/>\n&gt; other test in the AllTests suite, if it fails no other test <br/>\n&gt; is run.  You <br/>\n&gt; get a single failure, fix the web.xml file and then run <br/>\n&gt; again.  In order <br/>\n&gt; to get this same behavior in JUnit4 I would have to duplicate the <br/>\n&gt; @BeforeClass and @AfterClass annotations into every TestCase.  <br/>\n&gt; Annotations in this sense are really starting to sound like <br/>\n&gt; Advices in <br/>\n&gt; the AOP world.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Similarly, we have functional tests that use a type of <br/>\n&gt; validation like <br/>\n&gt; the one I mentioned before that connect to a third party <br/>\n&gt; WebService and <br/>\n&gt; grab its WSDL (Salesforce.com).  The validation checks the <br/>\n&gt; WSDL in the <br/>\n&gt; service against the WSDL we have saved locally.  If they <br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t match we <br/>\n&gt; know that we need to regenerate classes from the WSDL.  Since the <br/>\n&gt; objects we are currently working with are now &quot;out of date&quot; <br/>\n&gt; running the <br/>\n&gt; tests don&#39;t make too much sense, so we throw a failure and <br/>\n&gt; refuse to run <br/>\n&gt; any other tests.  The developer at that point copies the new WSDL to <br/>\n&gt; his/her local directory, regenerates classes, and runs tests again.  <br/>\n&gt; This is especially important at check-in time so that we know <br/>\n&gt; that the <br/>\n&gt; HEAD of our CVS branch is generally in line with the WebService -- <br/>\n&gt; allowing us to make a build out of HEAD at any time.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; As I said earlier the @BeforeClass and @AfterClass are too limited in <br/>\n&gt; their scope to allow for such validations.  Please correct me <br/>\n&gt; if I am wrong.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -- <br/>\n&gt; Jason Rogers<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I,<br/>\n&gt; but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in <br/>\n&gt; the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved <br/>\n&gt; me, and gave himself for me.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;     Galatians 2:20<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
