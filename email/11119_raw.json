I do see the need for\nsetUp, especially if you need to construct (horror) interlinked mock\nobjects.  But why bother &#39;nulling&#39; out your locals? They&#39;ll be GC&#39;ed anyway,\nright?\n \n \nThanks\n--DP\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: J. B.

I think it&#39;s your solution.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; One thing: I have never needed to override runBare(). Can you\n&gt;  &gt; explain\n&gt;  &gt; why you need to do it?\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Thanks.\n&gt;  &gt; --\n&gt;  &gt; J. B. Rainsberger,\n&gt;  &gt; Diaspar Software Services\n&gt;  &gt; http://www.diasparsoftware.com &lt;http://www.diasparsoftware.com&gt;  :: +1\n416 791-8603\n&gt;  &gt; Let&#39;s write software that people understand\n&gt; \n&gt; I override runBare() because if a test fails and if an exception\n&gt; occurs in the tearDown() method, then the test failure meassage is\n&gt; swallowed by JUnit and the exception message is shown of the tearDown\n&gt; () method instead. So I override runBare(). Now the JUnit result\n&gt; shows the test failure message. The exception in tearDown() is\n&gt; printed to the console. That was a question I asked half a year ago\n&gt; here and someone told me to override runBare() for this requirement.\n\nMakes sense, although I make it a goal to refactor in the direction of \nnot needing tearDown() at all, let alone having it possibly fail.\n\n&gt; But back to my original question and to your answer. I didn&#39;t test\n&gt; your solution yet, but it seems to work from the first sight.\n&gt; \n&gt; I think this is what you mean:\n&gt; \n&gt; public static void main(String[] args) {\n&gt;   TestSuite testSuite = new TestSuite();\n&gt;   testSuite.add(new MyTest(&quot;someTest&quot;));\n&gt;   // MyTestSetup subclasses TestSetup\n&gt;   TestDecorator testSetup = new MyTestSetup(testSuite);\n&gt;   junit.textui.TestRunner.run(testSetup);\n&gt; }\n&gt; \n&gt; But we run our JUnit tests in Eclipse. Eclipse has an own nice\n&gt; graphical JUnit view (written by Erich Gamma) to display the\n&gt; results. Now the problem with your solution seems to be this: How\n&gt; can I teach Eclipse to run the TestDecorator?\n\nCreate a custom suite() method with the code above, but returning testSetup.\n\nclass MyTest {\n     public static Test suite() {\n         // your code here\n     }\n}\n\n&gt; It would be no problem if I would start a main method. But that\n&gt; doesn&#39;t work for the Eclipse JUnit view, or am I wrong? Is there\n&gt; a way to use your solution for the Eclipse JUnit view?\n\nI think so.\n\n&gt; Thanks in advance!\n\nDon&#39;t thank me until it works. :)\n-- \nJ. B.
