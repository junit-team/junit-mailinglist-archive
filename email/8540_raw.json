I just don&#39;t think that it&#39;s necessarily any clearer: it&#39;s\njust all in one file rather than in three.\n\n\n\n \n\nYour points are good, but they seem to boil down to having several\ndifferent classes with good names and all will be right with the world.\nWhile that may be true, the problem I have is more at the package scope.\nWhen looking at a directory, how do you know where to start looking? The\nreason I like the inner classes is that you can set up a test suite of\nsorts in an obviously named class. With those inner classes, you can\nstill have several test files that support that main one, but if you are\nentering a directory to investigate someone else&#39;s testing strategy,\nthen having a well-defined starting point is a great help. Don&#39;t get me\nwrong, you can still use several different files, so long as they are\nreferenced from within an obviously named one. Using your Bag examples,\nI would say that the BagTest should refer to the other two, and possibly\na third that actually has the run-of-the-mill type tests. That way, when\nentering a directory with tests for 20 or more classes (look at\njava.util for example), I could find BagTest.java quickly and from there\ndiscover the other test classes that are directly applicable.\n\n \n\nGranted, this is all beginning to sound like the student teaching the\nteacher, but while I lack some JUnit experience, the software\nengineering experience is there. One of the hardest things about\napproaching a body of source code (production or test) is figuring out\nwhere to start. To that end, it seems having a single, well-named\nstarting point makes great strides.\n\n \n\nJosh\n\n \n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
