I am fine till that part as I am able to call the <br/>\nappropriate test case entered by the user and am able to display the <br/>\nresults on the browser.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I also need is that, is there a way to determine and print what <br/>\ntest case methods are being run.  As in case of the swingui <br/>\n(junit.swingui.TestRunner) we have the progress bar indicator that <br/>\ntells us how many test cases are run, the failures and errors and the <br/>\nstack trace.  Right now I am able to get all the results but once all <br/>\nthe test cases have finished running, till then the page displayed to <br/>\nthe user is blank.  Is there anyway to dynamically show which method <br/>\nin the test case is running and whether its a failure or error or <br/>\nsuccess.  Please let me know.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nSri</div>",
