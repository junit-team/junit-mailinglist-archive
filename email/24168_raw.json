Assertions (and mocks) have especially\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; contorted themselves in ways that they might finally now be able to\n&gt; r=\r\nelax.\n&gt;\n&gt; Yes, assertions could probably get much benefit from lambdas.\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n I support the idea of having assertions as a separate library which is\n&gt; d=\r\necoupled from the testing framework (the same way as Hamcrest,\n&gt; FEST-Asser=\r\nt and probably others). The testing framework would then focus\n&gt; fully on t=\r\nhe test execution model (e.g. test isolation, execution order,\n&gt; rules and =\r\nother metaprogramming).\n&gt;\n&gt; There is wide variablity in how assertions can =\r\nbe done (especially in\n&gt; different languages). I don&#39;t have strong opinions=\r\n about what an assert\n&gt; should be like, and seems that there are as many ki=\r\nnds of asserts as\n&gt; there are testing frameworks.\n&gt;\n&gt; There is less variabl=\r\nity in testing frameworks&#39; execution model, but\n&gt; those differences are oft=\r\nen at a more fundamental level (e.g. test\n&gt; isolation vs. shared state). I =\r\nand others hold strong opinions about them.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thus I would like to be abl=\r\ne to mix and match the frameworks and\n&gt; assertions separately, sometimes ev=\r\nen using multiple assertion libraries\n&gt; in the same test.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; - The fac=\r\nt that a Description is both the immutable single name of a test\n&gt; &gt; node, =\r\nand a mutable builder for the test structure, and then later an\n&gt; &gt; immutab=\r\nle reference for the test structure, is exasperating.\n&gt; &gt; - The reliance on=\r\n reflectively-discovered constructors for extensibility\n&gt; &gt; causes some awk=\r\nwardness.\n&gt; &gt; - The IDE-centric idea that one should be enable to enumerate=\r\n all tests\n&gt; &gt; before any is run places some binding constraints, and shoul=\r\nd be at most\n&gt; &gt; optional in a world in which tests are often run by daemon=\r\ns many more\n&gt; times\n&gt; &gt; a day than by humans.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ve noticed those as wel=\r\nl. I&#39;ve already addressed each of those in Jumi:\n&gt;\n&gt; - A testing framework =\r\nmust assign a unique immutable TestId for each\n&gt; test in a test class, whic=\r\nh is then used to send events of when the test\n&gt; was started, finished, fai=\r\nled etc. The TestId implies a tree structure\n&gt; of tests (to be used in test=\r\n result reports). Everything is expressed as\n&gt; immutable events (Jumi relie=\r\ns heavily on Event Sourcing). See details at\n&gt; http://jumi.fi/api/jumi-api/=\r\nfi/jumi/api/drivers/SuiteNotifier.html\n&gt;\n&gt; - The fi.jumi.api.drivers.Driver=\r\n which corresponds\n&gt; org.junit.runner.Runner requires a zero-argument const=\r\nructor. The test\n&gt; class et al is passed as method argument to\n&gt; http://jum=\r\ni.fi/api/jumi-api/fi/jumi/api/drivers/Driver.html#findTests\n&gt;\n&gt; - Jumi star=\r\nts executing tests as soon as possible, at both the suite and\n&gt; test class =\r\nlevels. At suite level, test class execution starts\n&gt; asynchronously before=\r\n all test classes are discovered (i.e. before Jumi\n&gt; has finished traversin=\r\ng the directories containing test classes). At\n&gt; test class level, more tes=\r\nts can be found during test execution (for\n&gt; example Specsy requires this) =\r\nand the new test executions can be started\n&gt; asynchronously in parallel (de=\r\npending on the testing framework and\n&gt; whether the user has disabled parall=\r\nelism for that test class or the\n&gt; whole suite).\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; - There are as man=\r\ny perfect models of test status possibilities as there\n&gt; &gt; are developers. =\r\nPassed/Failed? Passed/Failed/Skipped?\n&gt; &gt; Passed/Failed/Ignored, etc. The c=\r\nurrent design bakes one required system\n&gt; &gt; pretty deep into the internals,=\r\n unnecessarily.\n&gt;\n&gt; That&#39;s been on my mind for a long time, but I haven&#39;t y=\r\net figured out a\n&gt; good way to support all the variations, so I&#39;m deferring=\r\n the decision. I\n&gt; would love to hear your ideas.\n&gt;\n&gt; A very flexible way w=\r\nould be to allow tagging tests with arbitrary\n&gt; keywords, but then the prob=\r\nlem will be that how each of those keywords\n&gt; should affect the user interf=\r\nace. There would have to be at least some\n&gt; keywords with specific meaning,=\r\n which brings us back to the original\n&gt; question of which states to support=\r\n.\n&gt;\n&gt; To get started we could list all the variations in use today and the =\r\nuse\n&gt; cases for using each of them (e.g. it&#39;s an acceptance tests for a\n&gt; f=\r\neature which has not yet been implemented). I&#39;m hoping there to be 5 or\n&gt; l=\r\ness different reasons that are served by test statuses.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Now, should=\r\n the framework to which I&#39;d contribute time to fix these\n&gt; &gt; problems be ca=\r\nlled JUnit 5, or something entirely different? That&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; another kettle of=\r\n fish, with some interesting options to consider. Looks\n&gt; &gt; like we have at=\r\n least 9 months to consider them at length.\n&gt;\n&gt; 9 months, like giving birth=\r\n to a baby. I suppose the names of quite many\n&gt; people have been pondered f=\r\nor that long. :)\n&gt;\n&gt; JUnit&#39;s name is well known, so it&#39;s a marketing bonus.=\r\n On the other\n&gt; hand, the software industry moves quickly and good technolo=\r\ngy can get\n&gt; popular regardless of its name.\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt; Esko Luontola\n&gt; www.o=\r\nrfjackal.net\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed=\r\n]\n\n\n",
