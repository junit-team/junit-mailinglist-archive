If you don&#39;t<br/>\nhave all the tests passing, and you can&#39;t get them to pass in a<br/>\nrelatively short timeframe, then you might want to ask yourself what the<br/>\nvalue of having the failing tests is.<br/>\n<br/>\n(I&#39;ve been on a team where some of the tests stayed broken for many<br/>\nweeks. I don&#39;t know why we kept those tests; it&#39;s not as though they<br/>\nadded any confidence that the system worked properly.  At least, they<br/>\ndidn&#39;t provide me with any of that sort of confidence; they mostly<br/>\nprovided me with confidence that the tests weren&#39;t an accurate<br/>\nreflection of the state of the system.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf all the tests pass, the only value to compare from one run to the<br/>\nnext is &quot;how many tests are there&quot; -- and that&#39;s not something that you<br/>\nreally need a stylesheet to manage.<br/>\n<br/>\nDid that answer help at all?<br/>\n <br/>\n-- <br/>\nBrett Neumeier &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:random@...\">random@...</a>&gt;</div>",
