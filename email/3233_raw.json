But, if it&#39;s a code base for which they will\nnever see the source, why ship the tests?  Just so they can\nhave the pleasure of running them?  (Yes, I am being\nsomewhat facetious :)\n\n-jason\n\n--- Michael Finney &lt;mfinney@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Ship it all.  No separate package.

[mailto:lewold@...]\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, November 08, 2001 2:21 AM\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: [junit] Separate Package for Test Cases or not ?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; According this topic I found two different views: \n&gt; -) In the sourceforge FAQ they propose to use a separate\n&gt; test package\n&gt; for the unit tests. \n&gt; -) In various documents linked on the JUnit homepage\n&gt; (e.g. JUnit bets\n&gt; practices) they propose to keep the unit tests in the\n&gt; package of the\n&gt; classes to be tested. \n&gt; \n&gt; Personally I like the separate package more, as I don&#39;t\n&gt; want to ship\n&gt; the unit tests with the project. At no costs I want to\n&gt; manually\n&gt; exclude the test classes during shipment. Addiditonally I\n&gt; simply find\n&gt; this approach more structured - in our last project we\n&gt; had for each\n&gt; package a .test package. \n&gt; The separate package however has the main drawback for me\n&gt; that I cant\n&gt; test package private methods. This forces me to make more\n&gt; methods\n&gt; public than I want just for testing purposes. \n&gt; \n&gt; What are your experiences and preferences in this area ? \n&gt; \n&gt; Chris Lewold \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
