We are in the business <br/>\nof making loans and have a non-trivial number of rules and mitigants <br/>\nfor credit checking. If we had an extensive series of unit tests to <br/>\ncheck that we applied our current rules correctly (which we don&#39;t) <br/>\nand we stuck a rules engine in the mix - is there a way I could <br/>\nleverage those mythical unit tests to compare the results of my <br/>\ncurrent code against the rules-based results ? Is there a way I could <br/>\nmeasure the impact of a rules change by comparing the unit tests <br/>\nresults of the before and after versions of the rules ?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\nRob Rambusch</div>",
