So, instead of failing\nbecause the library has bad code, your test now fails if the library has\n*good* code.  Then, you should have another test which tests *your* code\nand makes sure that you prevent the bug from happening.\n\nThen, when the library is updated and the bug corrected, the library test\nwill now fail because the bug will be gone.  At that time, you should\nremove the library test, and refactor your code so that the extra code is\ngone.\n\nHope that helps,\nFrancois Beausoleil\n\nOn Fri, 06 Dec 2002 01:22:44 -0800 (PST), &quot;Vladimir R. Bossicard&quot;\n&lt;vbossica@...&gt; said:\n&gt; &gt; This has to do with understanding the role of programmer tests as\n&gt; &gt; opposed to customer tests. I have some fuzzy ideas in this direction,\n&gt; &gt; but nothing to make a paper possible yet. The bottom line is\n&gt; &gt; understanding the importance of blazing fast programmer tests and of\n&gt; &gt; separating PTs from CTs.\n&gt; \n&gt; What I did for Xindice (XML Database) is to separate the tests (unit,\n&gt; integration and stress).  The unit tests run all the time but the\n&gt; integration\n&gt; tests run less often.\n&gt; \n&gt; The problem is that Xindice provides several drivers (xml-rpc and embed)\n&gt; to\n&gt; access the database.  To test the xml-rpc driver, you have to generate\n&gt; the\n&gt; xindice.war file, copy it into your Tomcat&#39;s (e.g.) webapps directory and\n&gt; reload it.  If you do this each time you make a tiny modification it&#39;s\n&gt; quite\n&gt; painful (and not everyone has a Tomcat server running).  So it was\n&gt; natural to\n&gt; separate the tests according to their complexity.\n&gt; \n&gt; if you&#39;re interested, you can browse the code\n&gt; &lt;http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/xml-xindice/java/tests/&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Another question: how would you handle a test that is supposed to pass\n&gt; but that\n&gt;  currently fails because of a problem you can&#39;t fix?  &quot;All the tests must\n&gt;  pass\n&gt; all the time&quot; is fine if you have control over the entire code, but what\n&gt; if one\n&gt; of the libraries you use has a bug?  While other are fixing the library,\n&gt; your\n&gt; tests are still broken but it&#39;s still ok to commit new code (because no\n&gt; other\n&gt; new test fail)...\n&gt; \n&gt; How can you handle the situation?  Removing the failing test (altering\n&gt; its name\n&gt; for example) is IMO not so clean if you don&#39;t have a mechanism to\n&gt; automatically\n&gt; spot them.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Vladimir\n&gt; \n&gt; --\n&gt; Vladimir R.
