    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-658215743\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt;So said javainsel on 4/1/2003 --------------------<br/>\n&gt;Sorry, I know very little about both of them until now.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Then don&#39;t say things like &quot;JUnit considered problematic&quot;. I would prefer that you know what you&#39;re writing about before you draw such a strong conclusion.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;But it seems to me that I don&#39;t need necessarily JUnit test cases or <br/>\n&gt;suites if I use the new assert statement in the code I write.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>True.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Of course it is better to have JUnit tests, but it has many side <br/>\n&gt;effects in my eyes. Using assert statements would be a compromise.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Writing Programmer Tests (forget JUnit for now) has many positive side effects, true. No need to compromise.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I think I could use assert statements at the beginning of a method <br/>\n&gt;and at the end, checking preconditions and postconditions.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Certainly you may.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;By marking them somehow as preconditions and postconditions it should <br/>\n&gt;theoretically be possible to automate generation of JUnit <br/>\n&gt;tests/suites, including test data. The test data can be created <br/>\n&gt;automatically by a tool which obeys the preconditions for that <br/>\n&gt;purpose.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>JTest does this. Most Test-Driven programmers I have spoken with do not find it valuable, including me. There must be a reason we agree that generating this kinds of boundary tests are not valuable compared to the kinds of tests we prefer to write.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Hint: writing tests is a design activity.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;It seems that with JUnit I can only test methods which return a <br/>\n&gt;value.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>So utterly false I can&#39;t overstate the fact.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Using JUnit will change the code one would normally create: <br/>\n&gt;Because of JUnit you need to overwrite equals(), toString() and are <br/>\n&gt;not allowed to use void return type if you want to test that method.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Even more false than the previous statement.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Using the assert statement instead I can also test classes which <br/>\n&gt;return no value.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>We do this with JUnit every day.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Besides all this problems whis JUnit is another one: Successful <br/>\n&gt;JUnits tests are no guarantee that there are no bugs in the code I <br/>\n&gt;read. This has to do with data chains. But I didn&#39;t understand this.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You are now being ridiculous. No testing ever proves anything; therefore we should all go home and drink tea. This absurd argument is the last vestige of the desperate.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt this point I must ask you to go away, read several books on testing, then come back and stop talking nonsense.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJ.
