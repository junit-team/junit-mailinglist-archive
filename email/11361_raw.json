My Company developes a\n&gt;  Web Service that receives XML queries.\n&gt;  Some of the queries are very similar.\n&gt;  There are lots of &#39;health&#39; objects on the server.\n&gt;  And more than 10 commands &quot;getlist&quot; which\n&gt;  return XML containing list of these objects.\n&gt;  e.g. &quot;glucose_getlist&quot;, &quot;bloodpresure_getlist&quot;,\n&gt;  &quot;bloodsugar_getlist&quot; etc.\n&gt;  There are also filters for these &quot;getlist&quot; queries\n&gt;  - &quot;newerthan&quot;, &quot;last&quot;, &quot;device_manifacture&quot; etc.\n&gt; \n&gt;  I wanted to simplify testing these commands, so\n&gt;  I made one &quot;BasicGetListTest&quot; which receives the\n&gt;  name of the object and test for the common\n&gt;  functionality - send a common request and receives\n&gt;  all available objects with this name on the server .\n&gt;  I want to use the result from  this common test in\n&gt;  the other methods with the filters to understand if\n&gt;  &quot;getlist&quot; with  filter returns all/less/more objects.\n&gt; \n&gt;  Now I there is the problem. I want to run &quot;testCommon&quot;\n&gt;  first which is in the &quot;BasicGetListTest&quot; but when I\n&gt;  subclass it with &quot;GlucoseGetListTest&quot; it is always\n&gt;  executed last. I read some of the postings in this\n&gt;  newsgroup, but it seems that such kind of requirement\n&gt;  point a desing flaw and I should somehow rearrange my\n&gt;  Unit Test Structure to made the tests indepentdant. I&#39;m\n&gt;  stuck with it. On one hand I want to use inheritance to\n&gt;  save code, on the other hand I cannot.\n&gt;  I do not want to use TestSuit also, because this way I\n&gt;  will have to write like 15-20 different similar TestSuits\n&gt;  (one for each action with only a couple of characters\n&gt;   different in the java code).\n&gt; \n&gt;  Do you ,guys, have any fresh ideas how to do this ?\n&gt; \n&gt;  have a nice day and thanks a lot,\n&gt;    Kaloyan\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
