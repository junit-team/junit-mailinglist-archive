The question is wether it&#39;s *a good idea*. And I\ndon&#39;t think there is a definite, all-embracing answer to that question.\n\n&gt; It is will documented and it works to use java reflection.\n\nAnd it&#39;s more complex than using public methods. Even more importantly,\nhaving to do it is a code smell, in my experience.\n\n&gt; The developers in the project I am currently working changed their\n&gt; private methods to public just to UNIT test their code.\n\nWhat happened as a consequence?\n\n&gt; It is\n&gt; currently very important to test the private methods as it accounts\n&gt; for over 60% of the functionality and logic. I have found that\n&gt; enables me to test bottom up and I have more confidence when coding\n&gt; and when I need to refactor.\n\nI have found that methods that are complex enough to warrant explicite\ntesting want to live in classes where they are naturally public.\n\nCheers, Ilja\n\n\n",
