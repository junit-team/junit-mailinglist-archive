So you would have 100% test passes, which is\nincorrect against the actual expected results against the requirements.\n\n \n\nSome argue that false impressions are worse than no impression at all.

Gunderson &lt;jgunders@gamma-\n&lt;mailto:jgunders%40gamma-two.com&gt; two.com&gt; wrote:\n&gt; I think it is more difficult than that. Regardless of how well one\n&gt; program can reason about the behavior of another, it requires that the\n&gt; program reason about the intent of the original programmer. The\n&gt; automated tests _may_ be able to assess that the code is doing what it\n&gt; it written to do, but how can it determine that it wasn&#39;t written to do\n&gt; the right thing?\n&gt;\n\nThere are lots of reasons why one might want to have tests. Off the\ntop of my head,\n\n- to drive the design\n- to document the design\n- to demonstrate correctness\n- to provide a safety net when changing unfamiliar code\n\nThis latter case, which Michael Feathers talks a great deal about in\nWELC, is probably one of the most common reasons that people want\nautomated tests.\n\nPutting it another way,\n\nif I change this line of code, what other behavior will change will\nchange as a result\n\nWe ask ourselves this question every time we maintain unfamiliar code\nin an unfamiliar system without tests. The most conscientious\ndevelopers write tests before changing that line of code. Most don&#39;t.\n\nThis is such a common activity in software development that a program\nthat could characterize the behavior of another program and report\nwhen the behavior has changed would be useful wouldn&#39;t it?\n\nAs to JB&#39;s observation about whether it&#39;s possible to generate such\ntests for non-trivial programs - it&#39;s still early days for JUnit\nFactory but I think you&#39;d be surprised by what&#39;s already possible.\n\nKevin\n\nwww.junitfactory.com\nYou send us code. We send you tests. For free.\n\n \n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
