Looking at the code now, it looks like a much easier\n&gt; feature, perhaps for early 4.8.\n&gt;\n&gt; Question: would you rather see the tests as ignored, or not see them at all?\n&gt;   \n\nI&#39;m glad to hear you folks are aiming to support this use case!\n\nI could see people wanting both behaviors. In my case, I don&#39;t want to \nsee them at all.\n\nThe problem I&#39;m trying to address is that this project recently added a \ndatabase to the mix, so  a small number of tests have increased AllTests \nrunning time by 20x. Developers now run the tests a lot less. I want to \ngive them a single FastTests target to run that gets everything except  \nones I&#39;ve marked as slow.\n\nOn previous projects, I&#39;ve also tagged tests that depend on particular \nshared resources, like some common app server or database, or an \nexternal, not-always-reliable test server. For those, I&#39;d lean more \ntoward being able to ignore them, as turning them off would be temporary.\n\nWilliam\n\n",
