The smiley really doesn&#39;t change much.\n\nIt seems obvious to me that J.B. *very much* cares about good testing -\nand about your concerns, even if he disagrees; else he wouldn&#39;t discuss\nthe issues at such length with you. I also think that the whole xJunit\ncommunity has done very much for the better regarding unit testing - it\ndoesn&#39;t deserve such comments.\n\nBut perhaps I am overreacting because I strongly feel as part of the\ncommunity you attacked with above sentence. I also don&#39;t understand at\nall how it connects to J.B.&#39;s suggestion (which I think probably isn&#39;t\ntotally misguided). Would you like to elaborate?\n\nRegards, Ilja\n\n\n",
