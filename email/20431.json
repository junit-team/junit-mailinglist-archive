I see that you have created Feature<br/>\nRequests on Sourceforge, but I can&#39;t see any associated patch. I think<br/>\nthat might be a good place to start.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my experience, very few open source projects grant write access to<br/>\nthe version control system willy-nilly. Instead, people create<br/>\nrelationships with the existing development team by submitting<br/>\npatches, having a discussion with the dev team about improvements /<br/>\nwhy the patch was rejected and so on, until eventually the contributor<br/>\nmay be deemed worthy of becoming a fully-fledged committer on the<br/>\nproject. I would imagine JUnit has a similar tradition, although of<br/>\ncourse any of the existing development team are free to point out any<br/>\nmisconception I have here.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\n<br/>\nJames</div>",
