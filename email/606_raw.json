We are looking for existing tests that are written for the JUnit\nframework that we can incorporate into our own internal regression tests, to\nensure that Test Mentor runs them correctly when executing JUnit tests.\nWe&#39;ve already tested with the samples that came with JUnit and a few others\nand are looking for more.\n\nWould anyone be willing to share some JUnit based tests (and the classes\nthat they test), or point to some public domain tests, so we can ensure Test\nMentor works correctly with JUnit under all circumstances?\n\nAs an aside, if anyone is interested in trying out Test Mentor � Java\nEdition with their own existing JUnit-based tests, they can sign up for the\nprerelease at:\nhttp://www.silvermark.com/evaluators/5.3junit_releaseinfo.html.\n\nTest Mentor - Java edition is a commercial Java component testing tool.\nSkimming recent appends to this group, I noticed that Test Mentor supports\nthe following topics that were recently mentioned:\n\n - Transparently testing private methods\n - Saving detailed test execution results to a file (XML).\n - Driving tests from data files\n - Parameterized tests\n - User interface for selecting and running individual tests within a suite\n\nOther immediate benefits of running your JUnit tests under Test Mentor\ninclude:\n - Automatic method coverage metrics\n - Detailed assertion results reporting and fine-grained timing metrics\n - Automatic object interaction diagramming (to see which objects are\ninteracting as a result of a test)\n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nMike Silverstein, Lead Architect\tvoice:  (919) 858-8300 x29\nSilverMark, Inc.\t\t\tfax:    (919) 858-8308\n5511 Capital Center Drive\t\tmobile: (919) 669-5906\nSuite 510, Raleigh, NC 27606\t\ttoll free: (888) 588-0668\nhttp://www.silvermark.com\t\tmsilverstein@...\n\n\n",
