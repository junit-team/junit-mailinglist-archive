It might be necessary to write explicit tests of private methods in\nsuch a way as to invoke this code.\n\nSo, if you are like me, and advocate a parallel and separate test\narchitecture (ala McGregor et. al.) for test classes, how has JUnitX worked\nfor you?\n\nThanks,\nLauren\n\n=====\nLooking for an experienced Java/C++ Software Engineer?\nSee: http://developerdude.mystarband.net/resume.html\n\n\n",
