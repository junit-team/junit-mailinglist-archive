I wrote my test class, and i saw that the side effects\n&gt; occured as i planned.\n&gt; \n&gt; I create a new method, without return, that basically verifies some\n&gt; conditions, and so it call the other methods (already tested) in\n&gt; acordance with these conditions.\n&gt; \n&gt; So, my doubt is the following one:\n&gt; \n&gt; How i make the test of this new method without remaking the test\n&gt; already done?\n\nThis is exactly what happens in a design with too much coupling between \nobjects: when you test the &quot;invoking&quot; method, you find you have to do as \nmuch work (and more) as you did to test the &quot;invoked&quot; method.\n\nThe simplest solution is to break this dependency with an interface \nbetween the invoking method and the invoked method. This way you can \nsubstitute in your tests a simpler version of the invoked method that \ndoesn&#39;t make you re-test something you already tested.\n\nFor more information, look at _JUnit Recipes_, chapter 2 and the book \n_Working Effectively with Legacy Code_.\n-- \nJ.
