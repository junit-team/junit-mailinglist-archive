Here are some\ncomm=\r\nents on the experience.\n\nI extended BlockJUnit4ClassRunner and override the=\r\n invoke(...) method\nto verify the mock objects after the test has run, but =\r\nbefore tear-down.\n\nThis way reduces the amount of code in the custom runner=\r\n.  I also\ndidn&#39;t have to duplicate existing functionality because the invok=\r\ne\nmethod let me hook in at the right point.\n\nHowever, I still had to use cl=\r\nasses in the org.junit.internal package,\nwhich feels wrong.  Have I missed =\r\nthe right way of doing this?\n\nOther niggles...\n\n- The classes are compiled =\r\nfor Java 6 only, but only seem to need\nlanguage features from 5 and above. =\r\n Can the release be compiled for\nJava 5?\n\n- The JUnit 4.4 classes have been=\r\n deprecated *and* moved to another\npackage, which breaks any code that used=\r\n them.  There&#39;s no point in\ndoing both.  Either break backward compatabilit=\r\ny or keep backward\ncompatability and deprecate the classes.  I&#39;d prefer the=\r\n latter, since\nit will allow me to do a jMock with new features supporting =\r\nboth JUnit\n4.4 and 4.5 and then release a version that brings support forwa=\r\nrd to\n4.5 onwards.\n\nCheers,\n    --Nat.\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Nat =\r\nPryce&quot; &lt;nat.pryce@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; JUnit 4.5 breaks jMock 2 because the Test=\r\nMethod class has been moved\n&gt; to a different package.\n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s our fault f=\r\nor subclassing JUnit4ClassRunner, but it would be nice\n&gt; if JUnit4ClassRunn=\r\ner did not change at all in this release.\n&gt; \n&gt; --Nat\n&gt; \n&gt; 2008/6/16 Kent Be=\r\nck &lt;kentb@...&gt;:\n&gt; &gt; All,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Following our discussions last week, we ha=\r\nve incorporated the old\n&gt; &gt; JUnit4ClassRunner into 4.5. (The new runner is =\r\ncalled\nBlockJUnit4ClassRunner\n&gt; &gt; because it is organized as a &quot;block&quot; of &quot;=\r\nstatements&quot; instead of nested\n&gt; &gt; procedures). Those of you who have writte=\r\nn custom runners, we&#39;d\nappreciate\n&gt; &gt; it if you could try out the release c=\r\nandidate to make sure it\nsupports your\n&gt; &gt; existing runners.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Next u=\r\np, release notes and then out the door!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Whew!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Kent Beck\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Three Rivers Institute\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n",
