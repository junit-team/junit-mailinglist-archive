(In <br/>\nother words, I didn&#39;t have an experienced person standing by me on day 1 <br/>\nsaying, &quot;Do it this way.&quot;) If class A only cares about one or two pieces of <br/>\ninformation normally managed by class B, then A does not need to depend on <br/>\nB. The application ought perhaps to give to A the parts of B it needs.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis makes me wonder whether the OP is truly trying to unit test with JUnit, <br/>\nor do integration testing. What do you say, OP?<br/>\n<br/>\nJBR.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n----- Original message -----<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt; You&#39;ve made this suggestion a few times recently, and I was hoping<br/>\n </span></blockquote>you would<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt; elaborate on it.

Every time we wrote the<br/>\ndata for a unit test we had to look up the historical figures, or<br/>\ntake out the existing rates temporarily. You know the drill.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe solution was not to make plugging special exchange rates easier,<br/>\nit was to limit visibility of exchange rates to only those objects<br/>\nthat really needed them, and passing exchange rates into them either<br/>\nas method parameters or constructor parameters. This enabled a bunch<br/>\nof other design simplifications that we wouldn&#39;t have seen if we<br/>\nhadn&#39;t forced ourselves to make test writing easier.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m wondering if the OP&#39;s problem isn&#39;t similar. Reading a properties<br/>\nfile is expensive, so we only want to do it once for a bunch of<br/>\ntests. Well, what if you explicitly passed the properties you need to<br/>\nthe methods that need them?<br/>\n<br/>\nKent<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp\">http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp</a></div>",
