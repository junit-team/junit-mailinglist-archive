What&#39;s that? &quot;Match the pattern&quot; is programmer speak.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ah, but both of you are missing the real point. The user should not \n&gt; have been able to input an invalid social security number. The only \n&gt; case where this could happen is when the user is inputting data from \n&gt; a text file. In a properly designed GUI, the user should have been \n&gt; presented with 3 fields that only accept numeric digits. The first \n&gt; field accepts 3 digits, the 2nd 2 digits, and the last field 4 \n&gt; digits. And focus should have been move automatically between the \n&gt; fields.\n\nThis is veering off topic, but I don&#39;t mind, because at least it&#39;s good \nconversation.\n\nAs a user, I don&#39;t like this UI design. Specifically, when I make a \nkeying error, I usually have to use Shift+Tab to go back to input field \n#1 and correct the data there. Perhaps Novice users (think Dreyfus \nModel) benefit from such a constrained UI, but it works against me. The \none I&#39;m especially annoyed with is drop-down lists for month/year \n(credit card expiry date) or worse, month/day/year. I much prefer a text \nfield and a calendar widget. (Why isn&#39;t there are month/year widget?!)\n\nSo while this UI design can avoid certain input errors, I don&#39;t like to \nuse it. Which is worse: bad UI or bad error messages? I&#39;m not sure.\n\n&lt;snip /&gt;\n\n&gt; Since unit tests are for programmers, they should catch expected \n&gt; exceptions and let all others through to be displayed by the Unit \n&gt; Test runner.\n\nThis guideline has certainly served me well.\n-- \nJ.
