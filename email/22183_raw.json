Pretty much\n&gt; like aspects work. This way you could enrich the=\r\n test-run by declaratively\n&gt; hooking into the execution. Having global rule=\r\ns you could for instance,\n&gt; given a match-criteria selects points in the ru=\r\nn to hook into.\n&gt;\n&gt; How about &quot;declaratively enhance&quot; as a meaning?\n&gt;\n&gt; Wha=\r\ntever implementation you choose I have the following wishes based on\n&gt; work=\r\ning with bumblebee and trying to do these kind of global enhancements:\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n* That I do not /have to/ run the tests via a specific suite to have my\n&gt; g=\r\nlobal rules applied. The reason is that it&#39;s sometimes desirable to run\n&gt; o=\r\nnly one test and it would be nice if that test is enhanced in the same way\n=\r\n&gt; it would be if run via the suite.\n&gt;\n&gt; * That I would not have to add anym=\r\nore information than can be found on the\n&gt; class path. The reason is that n=\r\needing specific configuration such as system\n&gt; properties or environment va=\r\nriables would make my tests harder to run.\n&gt;\n&gt; I have often wanted to make =\r\nthis kind of global rules and I think that\n&gt; having the possibility would o=\r\npen up for a host of new ways to creatively\n&gt; enhance JUnit. Tools such as =\r\nbumblebee being one =A0 of many things that would\n&gt; be simple to do given s=\r\nuch a feature. I hooked into a suite to capture\n&gt; System.out for bumblebee =\r\ndocumentation and it works well given that I run\n&gt; via that suite. If I don=\r\n&#39;t run via that suite I have experienced hard to\n&gt; debug problems.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --=\r\n---------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Joakim Ohlrogge\n&gt; Agi=\r\ncal AB\n&gt; V=E4sterl=E5nggatan 79, 2 tr\n&gt; 111 29 Stockholm, SWEDEN\n&gt;\n&gt; Mobile=\r\n: +46-708-754004\n&gt; Blog: johlrogge.wordpress.com\n&gt; E-mail: joakim.ohlrogge@=\r\nagical.se\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; On Sat, Dec 5, 2009 at 7:43 PM, Kent Beck &lt;kentb@earthlink.=\r\nnet&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; All,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I understand global rules operationally not den=\r\notationally.

To have the rule working in several tests,\n=\r\n&gt;&gt; you have to place the Rule in each test.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; However, I am sea=\r\nrching for a way to activate a Rule for all the tests\n&gt;&gt; that are executed,=\r\n without needing to add the rule to each test. Perhaps by\n&gt;&gt; specifying a J=\r\nava property parameter when running the tests (I could also\n&gt;&gt; set this as =\r\na global Java option, therefore being used upon each execution\n&gt;&gt; of the JV=\r\nM).\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Do you know if this is possible?\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; The reason=\r\n why I need this, is: I am making the plans and gathering the\n&gt;&gt; ideas for =\r\ncreating a simple Swing application that will display the results\n&gt;&gt; of the=\r\n executed tests (just like the JUnit view in Eclipse/Idea/Netbeans,\n&gt;&gt; but =\r\nperhaps with more details, and also available for anyone, not just IDE\n&gt;&gt; u=\r\nsers). Currently I developed a small agent rule, that you can place in your=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; test, and it will report to the console the status of your tests (the S=\r\nwing\n&gt;&gt; console runs remotely).\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; This is ok, but it means that=\r\n you will have to add this rule to each\n&gt;&gt; and every test that you have. It=\r\n also means that will not be an easy task to\n&gt;&gt; disable this rule, if you d=\r\non&#39;t want it anymore.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Therefore a possibility to enable Rules=\r\n globally for all tests I think\n&gt;&gt; is the best solution for my case, and al=\r\nso a good tool to have for various\n&gt;&gt; other tasks.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; What do yo=\r\nu think? Also, what do you think about the Swing console\n&gt;&gt; idea?\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Cheers,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Bogdan\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; --------------------=\r\n----------------\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Yahoo!
