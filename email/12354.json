I&#39;m reading J. B.<br/>\n&gt; Rainsberger&#39;s excellent &quot;JUnit Recipes&quot; book and this led me to check<br/>\n&gt; out mock objects.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;d like to use mock objects to simulate the behavior of these<br/>\n&gt; collaborating objects (until I can refactor the design of course!). <br/>\n&gt; Virtualmock seems like a great tool to do this, and the source<br/>\n&gt; example in the distribution (iutest/test/functional/SampleTest.java)<br/>\n&gt; makes sense to me.  I&#39;ve never done this AOP-style of development<br/>\n&gt; though, so while the code seems to make sense, the logic of how to<br/>\n&gt; modify my ant script and test process is a mystery to me.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not big into AOP yet, either. When I have done AOP-based work in <br/>\nEclipse, I have had to turn off automatic builds, which is a <br/>\n/substantial/ hurdle for me. I&#39;d like to see a recent article on AOP <br/>\nwith Eclipse with the latest versions of the various tools.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 1. Is virtualmock still in development?  I didn&#39;t notice any updates<br/>\n&gt; for about 10 months on the Sourceforge project, and Googling for info<br/>\n&gt; on virtualmock returned very little (no mailing list discussions,<br/>\n&gt; etc.?).  The included version of AspectWerkz seems to be out of date<br/>\n&gt; as well (0.9 included, but now 2.0 is available.)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Where&#39;s Chad? Chad? What&#39;s up, dude?<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;snip /&gt;<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 3. Does jMock with CGLib provide the functionality to intercept calls<br/>\n&gt; to concrete objects instantiated by the object under test? (As<br/>\n&gt; virtualmock appears to do)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I believe so, and in that case, you should give it a try. I&#39;m just an <br/>\nold fart who insists everything be an interface, so I don&#39;t have much <br/>\nexperience using jMock and CGLib. If there&#39;s ever a second edition of <br/>\nRecipes, I&#39;ll include it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I really like virtualmock&#39;s ability to use your compiler&#39;s code<br/>\n&gt; completion and compile-time method invocation validation, though this<br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t have to be my main selling point.  If jMock with CGLib can<br/>\n&gt; provide the same sort of functionality (see my point #3) then I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; happy to try it out as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think it&#39;s worth a shot.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care, and good luck.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ.
