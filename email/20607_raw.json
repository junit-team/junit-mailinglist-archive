The line here is very fuzzy \nbetween wh=\r\nat is an actual unit test and what is an integration test \nand I am trying =\r\nto make that much more clearer.\n\nI want to have a bunch of test cases which=\r\n purely test classes in \nisolation and test that their behaivour is as expe=\r\ncted from an API \nstandpoint, but I also want another set of tests which wi=\r\nll test the \nactual functional and integration of things like making sure t=\r\nhe \nintegration with Spring and Hibernate is actually working and as I \nexp=\r\nect.\n\nHas anyone done this kind of seperation here before. I am just \nlooki=\r\nng for any methodologies for seperation of these tests in \nregards to packa=\r\nging, and running them etc. I run my tests from \nmaven and it would be good=\r\n to run the two sets of tests seprately \nfrom each other.\n\nMany Thanks.\n\nCh=\r\nris\n\n\n",
