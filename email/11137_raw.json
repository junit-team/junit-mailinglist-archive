In this case it was because the underlying\nlistener didn&#39;t have any test code for it.\n3) Implement (2) and check the fix (1).\n\nI&#39;ve chosen this because my current fault *didn&#39;t* have any test code for\n(2) and when added - I only got a green bar!?  So closer inspection of (1) I\nnoted that I was actually wrapping a number of DocumentListeners to get the\neffect I desired - unfortunately I was add them in the wrong order.  So\nwhilst (1) on its own would have worked, I like (2) as well because the\nlistener can be used in a number of different ways and (1) only tests a\nspecific usage.\n\nThank you\n\nJonathan\n\n\nOn 07 June 2004 15:00, I wrote: \n&gt; A while ago I started looking at using one of the frameworks available for\n&gt; testing UI code \n&lt;snip/&gt;\n\n&gt; Now I come to the validation process and I have received a number of \n&gt; bugs to fix (no big deal) but my question is how much should I drive \n&gt; my bug fixing? Normally (prior to abbot) I&#39;d dig about my code to locate \n&gt; the appropriate code, create a test case (or cases) to highlight the bug \n&gt; and drive the fix appropriately.  Now I have a UI fault that is easy to \n&gt; reproduce - and I&#39;ve created a test case using abbot to highlight the\nfault, \n&gt; and can now dig through the code and fix it... but... this fault (as with \n&gt; a couple of other UI faults) resolves down to a failing implementation of \n&gt; some DocumentListener logic.  \n&gt;\n&gt; So should I (would you) keep TDD the fix via the high level UI test case, \n&gt; or drill down and write &quot;lower&quot; level test cases for the DocumentListener\n&gt; implementation.  \n\n",
