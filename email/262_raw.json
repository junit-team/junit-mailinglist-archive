But the problem is, all the threads are\nacting on the same actual TestCase instances.  Meaning that my test case\n&quot;firmament&quot; becomes pretty much useless--an object I initialize in setUp()\nmight have been mucked with by another thread by the time I use it!\n\nIt has other side effects too.  For example, suppose I have a TestListener\nthat records every test executed and the word &quot;PASS&quot; or &quot;FAIL&quot;.  Since JUnit\noffers no callback method when a test passes (apparently it goes against\ntheir philosophy), the only way to do this I&#39;ve found is to set a &quot;failed&quot;\nflag in addError() and addFailure() and check that flag in endTest().  But\nif you use ActiveTestSuite, I&#39;m sure you can figure out what can go wrong.\n\nSo, anyone know how ActiveTestSuite was intended to be used?  Documentation\nis very slight.\n\nThanks!\nKevin\n\n\n",
