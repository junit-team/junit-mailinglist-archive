This feels extremely heavy..</font></p>\n\n<p><font SIZE=\"2\">Is there a recommended approach that someone had good results with?</font>\n<br><font SIZE=\"2\">Im thinking in the lines of having all the test cases in a separate WAR or EAR, and maybee incorporate log4j to simplify the testing.</font></p>\n\n<p><font SIZE=\"2\">But using printing to log4j as a result source would give the production code a unwanted overhead as well as be a very ugly way of conduct.</font></p>\n\n<p><font SIZE=\"2\">Please, if you&#39;ve got a good design for JUnit testing in the J2EE environment, share it with me.</font>\n</p>\n\n<p><font SIZE=\"2\">WR</font>\n</p>\n\n \n</html></div>",
