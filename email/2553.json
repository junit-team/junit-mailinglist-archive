What&#39;s the diff?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;I&#39;d like a way to make<br/>\n&gt;&gt;the test fail for every parameter that is missing and consider each of the<br/>\n&gt;&gt;iterations as one test.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Silly question: why? Does it matter whether one, two or ten parameters are<br/>\n&gt; not handled correctly? I think it matters more whether they are all<br/>\n&gt; handled correctly, or not.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It does but the fact that one parameter fails may have nothing to do with<br/>\nthe fact that another fails since validation may be occuring in different<br/>\nparts of the code. By failing once per invalid parameter, you are<br/>\nimmediately pointed to the proper place to debug. And if the test lists all<br/>\nthe parameters that failed, a developer could possibly see a pattern, which<br/>\nalso helps in debugging.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Also, who cares how many tests there are? Do you? Your manager? I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; want to get into the discussion again about counting tests, but I have<br/>\n&gt; never really cared how many tests I have, as long as I&#39;m happy with the<br/>\n&gt; quality of the tests.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No, counting tests wasn&#39;t the motive behind my question.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Since JUnit counts test methods by default, you&#39;d need one method per<br/>\n&gt; parameter. Do you really think that&#39;s a useful thing to do? I don&#39;t.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No, that&#39;s why I asked if there was a better method than what I&#39;m doing now:<br/>\nI have a StringBuffer to which I add all the parameters that failed and then<br/>\nuse the StringBuffer in fail().<br/>\n<br/>\nL<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nLaurent Duperval &lt;mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lduperval@...\">lduperval@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy do we drive on parkways and park on driveways?</div>",
