Let me describe the<br/>\nscenario.<br/>\n<br/>\nI built a small software component -- about 20 classes. This component<br/>\nhad three objects that required persistence. In that organization, the<br/>\ndatabase schema was centrally controlled by a &quot;Database Group&quot;. They<br/>\ndid not necessarily have total control over the database schema, but<br/>\nthey executed all changes to the database schema. Not wanting to<br/>\ninflict incremental development on a group that didn&#39;t have the<br/>\nbandwidth to accommodate me, I built my component with no persistence,<br/>\ngot the data model &quot;right&quot;, then prepared the database schema for<br/>\nsubmission to the database group. My goal was to make them happy by not<br/>\nmaking changes on them. They hate that.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome of my tests involved checking the unique keys on the database<br/>\ntables by trying to create persistent objects with various combinations<br/>\nof values for unique keys and expecting &quot;duplicate key&quot; errors at the<br/>\nright times. Some people might have seen those tests as testing the<br/>\ndatabase management system&#39;s implementation of unique keys, but I saw<br/>\nit as testing whether the database group got my tables right.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs it turned out, they didn&#39;t. They messed up one of my unique key<br/>\nconstraint specifications because they were importing my<br/>\nexpertly-crafted DDL into ERWIN, then using ERWIN to spit DDL out<br/>\nagain. I felt that they were slaves to their tools, but I wasn&#39;t about<br/>\nto tell them that. In the end, I was happy I wrote those tests.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, had I been in control of my own DDL, I might not have written<br/>\nthose tests; however, since I designed my component to abstract away<br/>\npersistence, I wrote those tests to ensure that my in-memory<br/>\nimplementation of the persistent objects worked correctly. It needed to<br/>\nreject the same kinds of duplicates that the database would.<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps this gives you some more information to use to judge whether<br/>\nyou&#39;re testing the right thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nJ.
