I would bet that the marginal number of bugs found by\n&quot;complete&quot; per-method tests over a more sensible per-feature approach,\nboth now and forever in the future, is very close to zero. At least\nthat&#39;s my impression based on my own experiences.\n\nMore is not always better.\n\nI would be very curious to know if anyone can report on actual\n(measured, quantitative) experiences that either support or refute\nthis.\n\n - Alan Bram\n   alan@...\nJ.
