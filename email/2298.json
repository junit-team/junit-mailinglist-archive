It has <br/>\nbeen renamed Cactus, donated to the Apache Software Foundation and <br/>\nhas begun a new existence there. It is now a fully functional unit <br/>\ntesting framework for server side java code. URL: <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/cactus\">http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/cactus</a><br/>\n<br/>\n* Cactus has chosen an in-container approach to unit testing, meaning <br/>\nthat your unit tests (JUnit like) are executed within your servlet <br/>\nengine. The other approach, as mentionned by Robert is to use Mock <br/>\nObjects. To understand the in and out of In-Container vs Mock Objects <br/>\nI would suggest you read <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/cactus/mockobjects.html\">http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/cactus/mockobjects.html</a> which is an <br/>\nunbiased (I think !) comparison of both approaches.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave fun !<br/>\n-Vincent Massol<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In junit@y..., Paul Hodgetts &lt;prh@z...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n[snip]<br/>\n&gt; I was looking at, IIRC, J2EEUnit which seems to have mocks for the <br/>\nHTTP<br/>\n&gt; request and session as part of its framework.  But I didn&#39;t get <br/>\nvery far<br/>\n&gt; with it at the time.  Easy Mock sounds cool, I&#39;ll have to take a <br/>\nlook.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Anyone have any experiences with J2EEUnit, or with otherwise <br/>\nsimulating<br/>\n&gt; HTTP sessions and responses?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n[snip] </span></blockquote></div>",
