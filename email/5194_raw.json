Feel free to pitch in to make it better.\n\n----\n\nQ: What&#39;s the difference between a failure and an error?\n\nA:\n\nAssertions are used to check for the possibility of failures, therefore \nfailures are anticipated.  In the following example, the \nIndexOutOfBoundsException is expected and checked with an assertion.  If \nthe expected exception is not raised, then a failure is produced.  \n\n    public void testExceptionExpected() {\n      try {\n      \n        new ArrayList(10).get( 11 );\n        fail(&quot;Should have thrown IndexOutOfBoundsException&quot; );\n      \n      } catch (IndexOutOfBoundsException success) {}\n    }\n\nErrors are unanticipated problems resulting in uncaught exceptions being \npropagated from a test method.  In the following example, the \nIndexOutOfBoundsException is not expected. The JUnit framework produces \nan error if the IndexOutOfBoundsException, or any other unchecked \nexception, is raised.  \n\n    public void testExceptionUnexpected() throws IndexOutOfBoundsException {\n\n      new ArrayList( 10 ).get( 11 );\n\n    }\n\nBoth failures and errors will cause the test to fail.  However, it is \nuseful to differentiate between failures and errors because the \ndebugging process is slightly different.  \n\nIn the first example, the use of fail() will not generate a complete \nstack trace including the method that raised the exception.  In this \ncase that&#39;s sufficient since we anticipate that the exception will be \nraised.  If it&#39;s not raised, then it&#39;s a problem with the test itself.  \n\nIn the second example,  the JUnit framework catches the exception and \ngenerates an error with a complete stack trace for the exception.  Since \nwe don&#39;t expect this exception to be raised, a complete stack trace is \nuseful in debugging why it was raised.\n\n----\n\nThoughts?\n\nMike\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
