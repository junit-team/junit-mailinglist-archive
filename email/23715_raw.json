The current implementation of Parameterized\n=\r\nis a dead end, for several reasons.  I have plans for a completely\ndifferen=\r\nt, much more flexible approach to the needs that Parameterized\nsatisfies, b=\r\nut it will likely be months before these see the light of\nday.  In the mean=\r\ntime, have you seen JUnitParams?\n(http://code.google.com/p/junitparams/)  I=\r\nt&#39;s the best of several\nreplacement schemes that I&#39;ve seen so far.\n\n   Davi=\r\nd\n\nOn Wed, Sep 28, 2011 at 6:25 PM, bwmplusuniquifier\n&lt;brian@...=\r\nm&gt; wrote:\n&gt; This has probably come up before. =A0Please forgive me for I fa=\r\niled to find an answer.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m using @RunWith(Parameterized.class) and wan=\r\nt to have test names other than foo[int]. foo[int] isn&#39;t very helpful e.g. =\r\nin Jenkins logs.\n&gt;\n&gt; Is there a way for the test to specify the name it sho=\r\nuld be known by?\n&gt;\n&gt; For now, I&#39;ve taken the Parameterized source code and =\r\nmodified it so that if the test class has a getTestName() method the runner=\r\n will call that to get the test name. =A0This is currently working and I&#39;d =\r\nbe happy to share.\n&gt;\n&gt; However, I did have to bodge things more than I like=\r\n to get it to work. =A0If I do the straightforward change, then the framewo=\r\nrk asks for the test name from the runner before the test object is created=\r\n. =A0I&#39;m currently dealing with this by creating the test object when the t=\r\nest runner is created, i.e. in the constructor of the test runner and keepi=\r\nng it around for the lifetime of the test runner. =A0This works - but may v=\r\niolate some design assumptions I don&#39;t know about and means that any except=\r\nion that can be thrown creating a test object can cause an initialization e=\r\nxception.\n&gt;\n&gt; I think this is useful functionality - I know of others who h=\r\nave also wanted something like this. =A0There are suggestions on StackOverf=\r\nlow for example to use the first parameter of a parameterset as the test na=\r\nme. =A0I think letting the test specify a getTestName method and defaulting=\r\n to the current mechanism if there isn&#39;t one is better as its more backward=\r\n compatible and gives the test developer more control.\n&gt;\n&gt; So:\n&gt;\n&gt; =A0o is =\r\nthere an existing or planned way to support naming individual parameterized=\r\n tests?\n&gt;\n&gt; =A0o are you interested in the approach/code I&#39;m trying?\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n=A0o if so, what would be the best way to integrate into the existing frame=\r\nwork so that the test object is created before the test name is requested?\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; bwm\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
