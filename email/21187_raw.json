The tests in the base run\nfor=\r\n all implementations, and the concrete classes add whatever other\ntests the=\r\ny need for implementation corner cases or unrelated functions.\n\nThe crux of=\r\n the problem is that the base tests need a way to\ninstantiate the class und=\r\ner test without knowing what class that is.\nTo do this, the base test class=\r\n relied on an abstract factory method\nimplemented in each concrete test cla=\r\nss according to the target\nimplementation.\n\nBecause we were using JUnit 3.8=\r\n, We faced one other wrinkle.  We had\nto avoid naming the base class like a=\r\n test case or JUnit would choke\ntrying to instantiate and run it directly.\n=\r\n\nAs I said, the technique was naive, but it basically worked, and it\ngot pa=\r\nst the gatekeeper responsible for keeping our use of 3rd party\npackages und=\r\ner control.  Since then, I have seen that GroboUtils\nclaims to support this=\r\n, so you might want to check that out at:\n\nhttp://groboutils.sourceforge.ne=\r\nt/testing-junit/art_hierarchy.html\n\nI&#39;d love to hear about experience with =\r\nthat or other more elegant and\nrobust approaches.\n\nBest,\nLance\n\n--- In juni=\r\nt@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Mike Hill&quot; &lt;mike@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; John...\n&gt;\n&gt; You know, =\r\nthis is a good question, and I&#39;d like to hear other\nresponses, too.\n&gt;\n&gt; For=\r\n me, testing &#39;up-the-tree&#39; has never seemed like the right thing\nto do.\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n That doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t sometimes wind up with a hierarchy of test\n&gt; cla=\r\nsses, e.g. FlintstonesTestBase ancestors FredTest and WilmaTest.\n&gt; But I us=\r\nually &#39;discover&#39; this rather than set out to do it.\n&gt;\n&gt; For me, the need fo=\r\nr a sub-class is the need for differentiation.\n&gt; That is, Fred and Wilma bo=\r\nth support the Flintstones interface, but\n&gt; they do it in different ways.  =\r\nWhen I microtest, I use what we call\n&gt; &#39;gray-box&#39; testing.  That is, the te=\r\nst takes advantage of, though not\n&gt; necessarily declaring, the inside infor=\r\nmation that its author has\n&gt; about the class being tested.  FredTest and Wi=\r\nlmaTest *will* probably\n&gt; share some code, hence FlintstonesTestBase, but t=\r\nhey don&#39;t restrict\n&gt; their view to only public api&#39;s of the Flintstones int=\r\nerface.\n&gt;\n&gt; Does that make any sense at all, or should I try a change of me=\r\nds?\n&gt; Hill\n&gt;\n&gt; Wanna learn TDD?
