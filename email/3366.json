When you want to run T with profiling you run Tp. When you want<br/>\n&gt; to run T without it you just run T. This is very similar to the way<br/>\n&gt; JUnitPerf works.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The question you have to ask yourself is where you want to add <br/>\ncomplexity.  If you want the user to do the work -&gt; 2nd proposition, <br/>\notherwise the 1st is IMHO better.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like to separate &quot;writing tests&quot; from &quot;running tests&quot; so IMO profiling <br/>\nis simply another way to run your tests -&gt; 1st proposition.<br/>\n<br/>\nFurthermore, the work of profiling is done by your runner (with Tp or T <br/>\n+ special runner) in every case so keep things as simple as possible for <br/>\nthe user and do all the work -&gt; 1st proposition.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Vladimir<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nVladimir Bossicard<br/>\nwww.bossicard.com</div>",
