I think that your questions are <br/>\njustified given the available info. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; You appear to be using the TestCase object to create test cases <br/>\n </span></blockquote>that<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; will be executed by something else. This is not what JUnit was <br/>\n </span></blockquote>designed<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; for, so I am confused why you are doing things this way.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The testcases are still able to run in the JUnit testrunner. I <br/>\ndidn&#39;t change anything of that. It just plugs in new assertStuff() <br/>\nmethods necessary for our testcases, like the assertion that some <br/>\naudit-log record has been written, or that some errorcode has been <br/>\nset after three times a time-out at a menu. But that&#39;s getting too <br/>\ndeep. (The testcases are run using ant, though).<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Why are you writing XML tags at all?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The asserts, dial commands, and other checks, and some of the <br/>\nfunctional loggings are written to one single logfile for the <br/>\ntestcases to be debugged. So the xml-file will look after <br/>\ntransformation with a stylesheet to something like this:<br/>\n<br/>\n    dial 1234567890<br/>\n    assert that the status connected has been reached within 5 <br/>\nseconds<br/>\n        phone has remote ringing<br/>\n        phone has connected<br/>\n    assert that voicesegment WELKOM.wav is played within 5 seconds<br/>\n        audit record 21004 has been written<br/>\n        config parameter OPENINGHOURS_OPEN is 09:00<br/>\n        config parameter OPENINGHOURS_CLOSE is 21:00<br/>\n        voicesegment WELKOM.wav is played<br/>\n    waiting for OTHERCHOICES.wav to be played within 1 seconds<br/>\n        voicesegment MAINMENU.wav is played<br/>\n        voicesegment CHOICE1.wav is played<br/>\n        failed test &#39;menu choice 1&#39;: OTHERCHOICES.wav was not played <br/>\nwithin 1 seconds, last voicesegment played is CHOICE1.wav<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Reading more, you appear to be doing logging in the test case. Why <br/>\n </span></blockquote>are<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; you not doing this logging in something like a test runner?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The logging is done in the asserts, so that we can track which tests <br/>\nhave succeeded, and how the flow of the program has passed. This way <br/>\nwe don&#39;t have to have the source of the testcase directly available <br/>\nwhen we are looking at the test reports. Because my project manager<br/>\n(!) is also defining and debugging the tests he has written (he <br/>\nsometimes makes mistakes, just as the hardcore programmers do), the <br/>\nlog has to be readable for mere mortals. Hence the XML -&gt; html.<br/>\n<br/>\nFurthermore, the environment is asynchronous in nature: the test <br/>\napplication and the IVR application run in different threads, <br/>\npossibly in different JVM&#39;s, or even machines. Therefore all the <br/>\nassert&#39;s have a time-out. Therefore the logging is essential for <br/>\nseeing the timing aspects: sometimes the time-out is set too small <br/>\nfor the application to perform it&#39;s actions. Then it is very handy <br/>\nto have the log displaying when the time-out occurred and where the <br/>\napplication was.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this eleviates some of your concerns :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nWith regards,<br/>\n<br/>\nMartijn Dashorst</div>",
