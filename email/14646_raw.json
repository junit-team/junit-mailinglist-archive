How would you feel about making &quot;private&quot; just a\n&gt; suggestion? i.e. why not allow anyone to invoke any private method from\n&gt; any class they want to? Of course, they would know when doing this that\n&gt; they were doing something skanky. Would you be happy with such a\n&gt; language? \n\nYes. (So happy, in fact, that I&#39;m one of the designers of such a\nlanguage.) The meaning of the &quot;private&quot; modifier on an identifier\nis &quot;use this at your own risk; we reserve the right to remove, rename,\nchange the semantics of, or otherwise screw you over if you do so&quot;.\n\nWe&#39;d expect an IDE for this language to allow tighter controls to\nbe put on its use, of course; and &quot;private&quot; is just a special, built-in,\ncase of visibility facets, of which you can have as many as you\nchoose.\n\n-- \nChris &quot;electric hedgehog&quot; Dollin\nAlmost all predictions about life in 2015 are wrong in some fundamental \nrespect.\n\n\n",
