It&#39;s<br/>\nunderstandable that your needs would differ and you would need to &quot;bend&quot;<br/>\njunit to make this work. Here at Terraspring, we have also made considerable<br/>\nenhancements in order to use it for integration testing. But we have<br/>\nseparated out our unit tests from our integration tests because they often<br/>\nhave different needs.<br/>\n<br/>\nchris<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Berin Loritsch [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bloritsch@...\">bloritsch@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, October 02, 2001 12:28 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [junit] Tangled design (Re: Test framework improvement)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe thing to reiterate is that we are testing Components that live in a<br/>\nspecific environment, and we must make sure they play nice in that<br/>\nenvironment.<br/>\nThis makes sure that changes to the environment don&#39;t break the Components,<br/>\nand vice versa.  You can&#39;t test that with dummy stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot all our testcases use this heavy process--Only the testcases that test<br/>\nComponents.  We have a lot of helper classes that we test<br/>\nindividually--without<br/>\nthe extra bulk.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometime during the test cycle we need to perform the environment tests, so<br/>\nI would rather do it with JUnit than with a production system ;).</div>",
