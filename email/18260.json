I said that<br/>\n/TDD/ /guides/ my design. TDD != tests and guide != drive.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  I would also point out that the term &quot;Test-Driven Design&quot; strongly seems to<br/>\n&gt;  imply that your tests drive your design.  Which is what I was objecting<br/>\n&gt;  against.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Did I write test driven design? I dont think so. But then again I do<br/>\nthink that TDD is more about design than testing so maybe it /is/ a<br/>\ngood term. I&#39;ll have to think about that.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;, and also why I much prefer calling it &quot;Test-Driven Development&quot;<br/>\n&gt;  (and I still think that it&#39;s something you should do whenever you can but<br/>\n&gt;  you certainly don&#39;t need to do it 100% of the time to obtain well-tested<br/>\n&gt;  code).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Whenever I can is certainly most if not all of the time. Sometimes I<br/>\ndon&#39;t know how to do it and then I do something else or try harder<br/>\nuntil I do. I guess sometimes it is slower and sometimes it is faster,<br/>\nI&#39;m just not a very good judge of when it is faster or not and I get<br/>\nsurprised sometimes that things that seem easy are not and the other<br/>\nway around. But the goal is not only to have well tested code is it?</div>",
