    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-112388267\">To revive this thread a bit, the assumptions feature in JUnit 4.4<br/>\nprovides an interesting way to handle some of these grouping issues.<br/>\nIt depends a bit on your mental model--if you think of categorization<br/>\nas a way to say &quot;run all of my tests _except_ the ones that will take<br/>\ntoo long or fail erroneously&quot;, this might look right.  If you think of<br/>\nit as &quot;of course I don&#39;t mean _all_ my tests--that almost always takes<br/>\ntoo long: run only the ones that are interesting right now&quot;, which can<br/>\nalso be valid for non-unit tests, this will feel more like a hack.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Christian&#39;s case, I can imagine:<br/>\n<br/>\n@Test public void onlineStuffHappens() {<br/>\n   assumeTrue(online());<br/>\n   doOnlineStuff();<br/>\n}<br/>\n<br/>\nI like this, because it seems to make clear that my test is only valid<br/>\nin certain situations, whereas an annotation might mean a validity<br/>\ncondition, or a simple categorization--the intent is not as clear.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s also the possibility of:<br/>\n<br/>\nassumeTrue(weHaveLotsOfTime());<br/>\n<br/>\nassumeThat(&quot;database&quot;, isRunnableCategory());<br/>\n<br/>\nIn these cases, however, the assumption metaphor feels more like a<br/>\nhack--we&#39;re not saying that the test would fail if we<br/>\ndidntHaveLotsOfTime, just that we don&#39;t want it to run.  In that case,<br/>\nyou could imagine wrapping it in a descriptive method name:<br/>\n<br/>\nonlyRunIf(weHaveLotsOfTime());<br/>\n<br/>\nOr something like that.<br/>\n<br/>\n   David Saff<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 7/3/07, Christian Nelson &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cnelson@...\">cnelson@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; I have a feeling I&#39;m about to bring up a much discussed topic,<br/>\n&gt; however, I wasn&#39;t able to find any related topics by searching this<br/>\n&gt; mailing list.  My apologies in advance if this has been hashed out before.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; While generally thinking that its not a great idea, I occasionally<br/>\n&gt; come into a situation where I genuinely need to partition my tests<br/>\n&gt; into more than one group or partition or suite.  The latest example is<br/>\n&gt; with a client who has many unit style tests as well as a number of<br/>\n&gt; tests which require specific network connectivity only available from<br/>\n&gt; a subset of machines (the outgoing requests must come from a specific<br/>\n&gt; ip address).  We call these the &quot;online tests&quot;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We want to be able to group our tests into two groups, &quot;unit tests&quot;<br/>\n&gt; and &quot;online tests&quot;.  In some case we want to run only &quot;unit tests&quot; or<br/>\n&gt; only &quot;online tests&quot;, and in other cases we want to run both (or all).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I understand that this functionality is available using JUnit 4&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; @RunWith(Suite.class) and @SuiteClasses(TestClass1.class, ...).<br/>\n&gt; However, manually adding test classes to a suite is clunky because the<br/>\n&gt; list of  test classes becomes huge.  It&#39;s also error prone; it&#39;s easy<br/>\n&gt; for developers to write a test but forget to add it to @SuiteClass.<br/>\n&gt; Lastly, test runners will run test in suites multiple times when told<br/>\n&gt; to &quot;run all tests&quot;.  That&#39;s hardly the desired behavior.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What I really would like to see is the concept of suite (or group in<br/>\n&gt; TestNG terms) be promoted to a first class citizen.  Honestly, I think<br/>\n&gt;  I would prefer it to be at the test class level (unlike TestNG which<br/>\n&gt; is at the test method level), since the mechanism should be used for<br/>\n&gt; high-level organization IMHO.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Is there any chance something like this might make its way into JUnit?<br/>\n&gt; What can I do to help?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks,<br/>\n&gt; Christian<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
