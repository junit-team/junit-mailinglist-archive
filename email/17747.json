I&#39;ll write my own unit tests, you  <br/>\nconcentrate on yours.  It is not your job to debug my code.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, maybe you are building a framework and are trying to be kind to  <br/>\nthe callers of that framework by giving them expressive and  <br/>\ndiagnostically interesting error messages.  That&#39;s fine, and if I  <br/>\nwere a caller I would be grateful.  I would also be grateful to see  <br/>\nyour unit tests since they would tell me how to call your framework  <br/>\nand what to expect from it, and how NOT to get your expressive and  <br/>\ndiagnostically interesting error messages.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n----<br/>\nRobert C.
