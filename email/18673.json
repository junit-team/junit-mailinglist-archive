HooohHahhh!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Jimm in order for this to work the way it says it<br/>\n&gt; works it has to parse source and store it in some<br/>\n&gt; model.  Then analyze it...looks like using rule sets.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m sure you could use the same model and rule sets<br/>\n&gt; to generate tests (Just shooting from the hip.  I&#39;d have to look at it a<br/>\n&gt; little more<br/>\n&gt; to see whether I could come up with a concrete example. )<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://pmd.sourceforge.net/\">http://pmd.sourceforge.net/</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks for letting me us Joakim.  Can&#39;t wait to<br/>\n&gt; to hook it up to my maven projects.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Cheers,<br/>\n&gt; - Ole<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Joakim Ohlrogge wrote:<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; As a matter of fact...it would be nice to have<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; something that enumerates the branches and generates a<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; report on which methods has a number of branches over<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; a certain limit...for code refactoring and maintenance<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; purposes.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Hi Ole,<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; I have not read the whole thread yet so if this has already been<br/>\n&gt;&gt; suggested I&#39;m sorry.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; PMD actually reports methods with a cyclomatic complexity that is<br/>\n&gt;&gt; larger than 10. If I&#39;m not mistaken that is what you&#39;re looking for.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; I find this helpful to find targets to refactor in legacy code. When<br/>\n&gt;&gt; TDD:ing the PLP (my abbreviation for path of least pain) keeps the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; cyclomatic complexity down (Like Jeff Langr suggested earlier in the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; threat).<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Cheers!<br/>\n&gt;&gt; /J<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
