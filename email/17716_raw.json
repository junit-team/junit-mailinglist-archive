I suspect\n&gt;  &gt; you&#39;re not an asshole, so I imagine you mean something else. I would\n&gt;  &gt; appreciate you clarifying this position. Is it necessarily the case,\n&gt;  &gt; then, that &quot;the sort of programmers who... hang out on lists like this\n&gt;  &gt; one&quot; don&#39;t know what we&#39;re talking about, because I kinda think I do and\n&gt;  &gt; I kinda think I&#39;ve proven that.\n&gt; \n&gt; You do know what you&#39;re talking about, and you are practitioners, as am\n&gt; I. However you&#39;re making the classic mistake of assuming that everyone\n&gt; else is just like you, and that what works for you works for them. \n\nThanks. I wanted to be sure that was the case before I moved much \nfurther forward. I appreciate the clarification.\n\n&gt; This\n&gt; is a *HUGE* and unrecognized fallacy that underlies a lot more than\n&gt; programming methodologies. For instance, it&#39;s largely responsible for\n&gt; the failure of modern elementary and secondary education, which works\n&gt; for maybe 5% of children. However that&#39;s those 5% that go onto become\n&gt; teachers and principles and propagate the same techniques to future\n&gt; generations, while ignoring the failure of 95% of their students.\n\nI think I understand exactly where you&#39;re coming from here.\n\n&gt; The simple fact is that people learn and think differently. No one\n&gt; technique works for everyone, but some techniques do work for more\n&gt; people. We tend to self-select into groups that think similarly and\n&gt; learn similarly to ourselves. The people who like interfaces are a\n&gt; self-selected group of programmers who think at a very high degree of\n&gt; abstraction, even for programmers (already a self-selected and abstract\n&gt; bunch). This doesn&#39;t mean they don&#39;t produce quality software. It does\n&gt; mean that you can&#39;t expect what works for them to work for all or even\n&gt; most developers.\n\nThank you, Elliotte, for making that clearer.\n-- \nJ. B.
