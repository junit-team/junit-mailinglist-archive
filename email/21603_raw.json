An arbitra=\r\nry number of implementations may inject into the suite, and the full suite =\r\nis independently run for each implementation.\n\nUSE-CASE:\n\nI recently wrote =\r\nan interface that mimics a Table, a 2-dimensional array. I anticipated havi=\r\nng a couple implementations of this table, and wanted each to be compliant =\r\nwith the tests written for my interface.\nCurrently, I have to write tests f=\r\nor each implementation. Instead, I wanted to be able to write one test-suit=\r\ne that fully defines the interface, and simply say &quot;Test using these Table =\r\nimplementations.&quot;\nFurthermore, I imagine that if I ever distribute my inter=\r\nface, third-parties may choose to implement their own Tables. They would ei=\r\nther have to write their own tests, or simply trust that they didn&#39;t make a=\r\nny mistakes. Instead, they can simply inject their implementations into my =\r\ntest suite, in the exact same way I&#39;m doing now.\n\nEXAMPLE:\n\nAs a quick exam=\r\nple, you could have the following test suite:\n\n// ListTest.java (imports om=\r\nitted for brevity)\n\n// NoopRunner does nothing. This was the easiest way to=\r\n use familiar syntax while not having to explicitly omit this class every t=\r\nime I want to test.\n@RunWith(NoopRunner.class)\npublic class ListTest {\n  @I=\r\nnjected\n  public List&lt;String&gt; list;\n\n  @Test\n  public testList() {\n    list=\r\n.add(&quot;A&quot;);\n    assertThat(list.size(), is(1));\n  }\n\n}\n\n// ArrayListTest.jav=\r\na (imports omitted for brevity)\n\n@RunWith(InjectingRunner.class)\n@InjectTes=\r\nt(injectedValue=3DArrayList.class, testClass=3D ListTest.class)\npublic clas=\r\ns ArrayListTest {\n    // Do nothing; this is sufficient to create our test.=\r\n\n}\n\n\n// LinkedListTest.java (imports omitted for brevity)\n\n@RunWith(Injecti=\r\nngRunner.class)\n@InjectTest(injectedValue=3DLinkedList.class, testClass=3DL=\r\nistTest.class)\npublic class LinkedListTest {\n    // Do nothing; this is suf=\r\nficient to create our test.\n}\n\nAnd that&#39;s it. It&#39;s pretty experimental righ=\r\nt now, and only does rudimentary validation, but it works, and generates se=\r\nnsible output -- in Eclipse, ArrayListTest appears to own the methods actua=\r\nlly in ListTest.\n\nHOW TO USE:\n\nIt&#39;s very easy to retrofit an existing test =\r\nsuite to use this new injection runner; it boils down to removing the line =\r\nin the @Before method and adding the annotations. Once that&#39;s complete, you=\r\nr test framework can be generic to any subclass of that variable.\n\nDETAILS:=\r\n\n\nInternally, InjectingRunner is rather simple. It extends Runner and creat=\r\nes a BlockJUnit4Runner for the referenced test-suite. That underlying class=\r\n handles finding the tests in the class, and running them.\nInjection is don=\r\ne by override withBefores, and just adding another Statement before any @Be=\r\nfore&#39;s run. Since it&#39;s just using the standard stuff in the standard Runner=\r\n, everything works as normal (You can use @Before, @BeforeClass, and everyt=\r\nhing else you&#39;d use in a normal test-suite).\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS:\n\nI was wonder=\r\ning if there was any interest in the source for this, or if I&#39;ve foolishly =\r\nreimplemented something already in JUnit. This has some similiarities to th=\r\ne Theories runner, but that was too different to work well with this.\n\n- Aa=\r\nron Faanes\n\n\n",
