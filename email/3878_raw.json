I would appreciate your \nindulgence.\n\nShould a test case return a success or failure on a method when it throws an \nexception. Specifically, I have a method that loads environment variables \nfrom a source file. If the file is not found, the method throws a \nFileNotFoundException. Now the test case has a try/catch block to trap the \nexception but should I fail the test if caught.\n\nCurrently, my thinking is the test case passes because the method did in \nfact function correctly. The code is written to throw an error. However, \nreading the articles on the subject I am confused. Should the test case \nre-throw the exception? Report a failure? Report a success but output a \nmessage the test case was inconclusive?\n\nThanks.\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp.\n\n\n",
