I know<br/>\n&gt;the file system works, but does the application have the correct logic to<br/>\n&gt;walk the directories and select the right files.  Some of the unit tests<br/>\n&gt;were robustness tests, driving the need for a number of different files<br/>\n&gt;(still checking program logic).  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>OK. Let me see whether I understand.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou have already tested your logic using a mock or in-memory file system *or* you have verified that your logic chooses the correct file system locations without worrying about whether you integrate correctly with the file system.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow you want to be sure that you actually work with the file system, because there are I/O and interprocess issues that could break your application even in the presence of defect-free logic. Usually these are timing issues where the Java code executes too quickly and changes on the file system lag behind.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs that the situation?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I needed to create a known set of files and directories to test one of the<br/>\n&gt;methods.  There were a number of tests.  I agree, there is no technical<br/>\n&gt;reason to not create/destory the file/directories each time, other than I<br/>\n&gt;sometimes work on an older computer that is slow.  The time to<br/>\n&gt;create/destory an interesting set of directories and files takes time on<br/>\n&gt;the slow machine and I like to run the tests after each change to the<br/>\n&gt;code.  (I have gotten used to a fast desktop machine which may be driving<br/>\n&gt;my behavior...) <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I agree. This is why I write as few tests as possible that use the real file system. I limit them to Customer Tests which have to work end-to-end, anyhow, in order to be useful. For Programmer Tests, though, I avoid the file system altogether except to verify that I remember how to use the file system.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Could some of the test cases be integration tests, of course.  This is a<br/>\n&gt;small home project with one developer and I have used Junit to test both<br/>\n&gt;methods and the application since Junit solves all my testing needs for<br/>\n&gt;this application. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Absolutely.<br/>\n<br/>\nOK. I was just checking. My goal is to help people make maximal progress without worrying about these kinds of issues. It looks like you&#39;ve already handled that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI still don&#39;t understand the sense in which JUnit doesn&#39;t support one-time setup, though. It clearly does.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJ. B.
