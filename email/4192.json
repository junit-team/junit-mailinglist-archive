It it<br/>\nbased on top of JUnit and it will help you for unit testing Servlets,<br/>\nEJBs, Taglibs, Filters (MDBs not yet but coming soon ;-)). It won&#39;t help<br/>\nyou more than pure JUnit for XML processing though.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou may also want to have a look at Mock Objects (see<br/>\nhttp://www.mockobjects.com).<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck,<br/>\n-Vincent<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: mschnayd [mailto:mschnayd@...]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: 22 February 2002 20:36<br/>\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com<br/>\n&gt; Subject: [junit] Please Help, Need Guidance<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hello Guys,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am an architect for a small software company.  We have been<br/>\n&gt; developing our product for about two years now, and have been trying<br/>\n&gt; to be pretty good about the developmental practices.  We have coding<br/>\n&gt; standards, good architecture and frameworks in place, and allot of<br/>\n&gt; tallented developers. What we don&#39;t have is a solid suite of unit<br/>\n&gt; tests.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What happened is at the beginning of the project management was<br/>\n&gt; onboard with the schedule that we demanded that included time for<br/>\n&gt; building the unit tests.  For about 6 month now that is no longer a<br/>\n&gt; case.  We have not written unit tests for the past 6 month.  The<br/>\n&gt; tests that have been written are long out of sync. with the codebase,<br/>\n&gt; to the point where everyone has them excluded from compilation.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I really would like us to get back on track and developer a better<br/>\n&gt; quality product; alos, god knows our QA need some help.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Anyway, to keep a long story short, what I am looking for is for best<br/>\n&gt; practices and guidlines on developintg unit tests for various types<br/>\n&gt; of classes (Regular classes, Servlets, EJBs, MDBs, XML processing).<br/>\n&gt; Is there a framework that somebody has developed on top of the JUnit.<br/>\n&gt; If not, I would be glad to build one, assuming it will not require<br/>\n&gt; too much time.  Being a great fan of reuse, I would rather use an<br/>\n&gt; already created testing framework.  JUnit is great, but it is very<br/>\n&gt; simple and does not have guidance on testing Data Access code, ...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If any of you can give me a list of books, articles, code samples,<br/>\n&gt; references to other web-sites; I will greatly appreciate it.<br/>\n&gt; I am realy glad that people like Erich Gamma and Kent Beck are out<br/>\n&gt; there to help the rest of us get our acts together; however, there is<br/>\n&gt; still some much more that could be done to make life easier for<br/>\n&gt; fast-pased development teams like the one I am working for.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Regards, Mikhail Shnayderman.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
