E.G. I have a few Fortune Cookies that are stored in =\r\nan array of \n&gt; Strings. I&#39;ve written some code that returns them randomly. =\r\n\n&gt; What is the best method for testing? i.e. should I be using Mocks?\n&gt; If =\r\nanybody has any good examples or relevant web sites please let me \n&gt; know.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; Your help is greatly appreciated.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sam.\n&gt;\n\nTesting random (or more=\r\n generally, non-deterministic) behavior is an\ninteresting question, and one=\r\n I like to ask during interviews.  We\ncould talk for hours about it, but I =\r\nhave a feeling you are looking\nfor a practical answer.\n\nIf you can seed the=\r\n random number generator (you probably should), you\ncan easily test the fol=\r\nlowing:\n\n- Two sequences with the same seed produce the same fortune cookie=\r\ns in\nthe same order.\n\n- Two sequences with different seeds produce differen=\r\nt sequences of\nfortune cookies.\n\nYou should also test for invariant propert=\r\nies (i.e. things that should\nalways happen or never happen). For example, r=\r\nequest a fortune cookie\na large number of times and make sure that it alway=\r\ns returns a &quot;valid&quot;\nstring.  You can define a valid string as a non-null, n=\r\non-empty string\nor, even better, every string you return should be in the s=\r\net of\nfortune cookies strings you are using.  The latter implies that the\ns=\r\net of fortune cookies strings should not include null or empty\nstrings - wh=\r\nich sounds like a good property of a fortune cookie\ngenerator (unless you h=\r\nave a nihilistic view of life) and something\nelse that you should test.\n\nTh=\r\nere are many other very interesting techniques for testing\nrandomness, but =\r\nI think they might be overkill for a fortune cookie\ngenerator. But if you a=\r\nre interested in learning more about this type\nof testing, I wrote a chapte=\r\nr on testing for the O&#39;Reilly book\n&quot;Beautiful Code&quot; which covers some of th=\r\nese ideas. Here&#39;s a link to it:\n\nhttp://junitfactory.com/articles/beautiful=\r\n-code/BeautifulTests.pdf\n\nI hope this helps,\n\nAlberto\n\n--\n\nJUnit Factory - =\r\nJUnit test amplification and generation.\nExhaustive tests without exhausted=\r\n developers.
