Whether th=\r\ne tests are simple (one assertion per test) or  \n&gt; complex is an\n&gt; orthogon=\r\nal issue.\n&gt;\nI understand what the original poster wants, and I believe the =\r\nissues  \nare related. I thought I made that clear in my message.\n&gt; This fea=\r\nture request has come up a few times on the TestNG mailing- \n&gt; list as\n&gt; we=\r\nll, and I have sometimes felt this need occasionally myself.\n&gt;\nI understand=\r\n that. I have also felt this need in the past. When I  \nobserved that I cou=\r\nld solve many of the same problems by writing  \nsmaller, more focused tests=\r\n, not only did I stop wanting to log  \nassertions, but my designs improved =\r\nand I delivered more solid  \nfeatures sooner. I believe that if JUnit logge=\r\nd its assertions, then  \nthat would have robbed me of this experience.\n&gt; Th=\r\nink of it as another granularity level of insight inside your  \n&gt; tests: if=\r\n\n&gt; you want the big picture, you look at the HTML reports. If you want  \n&gt; =\r\nthe\n&gt; fine picture, you look at the source. And if you want something in- \n=\r\n&gt; between\n&gt; (&quot;are we making sure the collection is the right size?&quot;), you c=\r\nould  \n&gt; use this\n&gt; hypothetical assert log without the source noise.\n&gt;\nIf =\r\nthe collection needs to be the right size, and if getting that  \nwrong is m=\r\nore than microscopically likely, then I write a test for it.  \nThat&#39;s what =\r\nI do and that&#39;s what I recommend others do.\n\nTake care.\n----\nJ.
