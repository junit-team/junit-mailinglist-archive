It appears that many<br/>\n&gt; &gt;people think there are &quot;magic formulas&quot; for working with JUnit.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;As a result, they ask silly questions like, &quot;How do I test an<br/>\n&gt; &gt;EJB with JUnit????&quot; The people who know the answer get so<br/>\n&gt; &gt;tired of writing, &quot;Search this list. Try it. What are you<br/>\n&gt; &gt;having trouble testing?&quot; that they simply stop responding.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;As a result, questions are not being answered.<br/>\n&gt;................<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I don&#39;t agree with these opinions. I think there has been<br/>\n&gt;very good questions and answers (discussions) here. Of course<br/>\n&gt;it is good if the answers can already be found in a FAQ<br/>\n&gt;but remember that the FAQ is something that is maintained<br/>\n&gt;usually by one person as on a list like this you can have several<br/>\n&gt;views. Take as an example the answers yesterday of why you should use<br/>\n&gt;JUnit. I am sure you can find data on this already somewhere else.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>A FAQ, though, may have provided a short answer to this question - and <br/>\nperhaps that would be sufficient for the poster. (And if not, he could <br/>\nalways ask a question ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m fully in favour of anything that cuts down on list volume - if this <br/>\nwere the only list to which I&#39;m subscribed, it wouldn&#39;t matter... but what <br/>\nwith this one, ant-users, tomcat-users, ...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;JUnit is a new thing for many people and this list must also be<br/>\n&gt;available to new users and not only to those who have already<br/>\n&gt;got an answer to all questions.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You&#39;re 100% right - but so many of the questions here are so basic that <br/>\nthey show that the person has done *no* research whatsoever - kind of like <br/>\nthe questions you get on usenet that are so obviously the questioner&#39;s <br/>\nhomework. New users&#39; questions are of course welcome - but as has been <br/>\npointed out, it&#39;s only polite to try and find the answer first.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJim<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\n<br/>\n                           *   Jim Cheesman   *<br/>\n             Trabajo: <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jchees@...\">jchees@...</a> - (34)(91) 724 9200 x 2360<br/>\n           Cooperation can only be <br/>\nreached if we work together.</div>",
