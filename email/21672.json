It seems the only thing it gains is that the parameter to the matcher is the right type for the comparison, but the actual underlying matches method does not look at the generic, so if it wasn&#39;t the right type and generics were not used, the assert would just fail? I&#39;m I reading that right?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;yme0987654321&quot; &lt;yme0987654321@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; hasEntry is part of the Hamcrest library.

It does get deep, and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; in some cases, compiler-dependent, if I remember correctly.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; However, we did find that in some cases, the signature of the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; _Matcher_ could be improved.  What&#39;s the signature of hasEntry?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; This is also pushing me to keep on my &quot;Dotmesh&quot; project, which would allow this:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; assertThat(result.entrySet()).contains(entry(&quot;Key&quot;, Date.class));<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; [if the &quot;entry&quot; factory convenience method were written]<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Thanks,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;    David Saff<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
