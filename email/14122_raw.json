It seems to me that you \n&gt; can do this \n&gt; &gt; kind of\n&gt; &gt; validation in a @BeforeClass in JUnit 4. Would that solve \n&gt; your problem?\n&gt; \n&gt; Not so easily in this case.  This is a validation that is run \n&gt; before any \n&gt; other test in the AllTests suite, if it fails no other test \n&gt; is run.  You \n&gt; get a single failure, fix the web.xml file and then run \n&gt; again.  In order \n&gt; to get this same behavior in JUnit4 I would have to duplicate the \n&gt; @BeforeClass and @AfterClass annotations into every TestCase.  \n&gt; Annotations in this sense are really starting to sound like \n&gt; Advices in \n&gt; the AOP world.\n&gt; \n&gt; Similarly, we have functional tests that use a type of \n&gt; validation like \n&gt; the one I mentioned before that connect to a third party \n&gt; WebService and \n&gt; grab its WSDL (Salesforce.com).  The validation checks the \n&gt; WSDL in the \n&gt; service against the WSDL we have saved locally.  If they \n&gt; don&#39;t match we \n&gt; know that we need to regenerate classes from the WSDL.  Since the \n&gt; objects we are currently working with are now &quot;out of date&quot; \n&gt; running the \n&gt; tests don&#39;t make too much sense, so we throw a failure and \n&gt; refuse to run \n&gt; any other tests.  The developer at that point copies the new WSDL to \n&gt; his/her local directory, regenerates classes, and runs tests again.  \n&gt; This is especially important at check-in time so that we know \n&gt; that the \n&gt; HEAD of our CVS branch is generally in line with the WebService -- \n&gt; allowing us to make a build out of HEAD at any time.\n&gt; \n&gt; As I said earlier the @BeforeClass and @AfterClass are too limited in \n&gt; their scope to allow for such validations.  Please correct me \n&gt; if I am wrong.\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; Jason Rogers\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I,\n&gt; but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in \n&gt; the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved \n&gt; me, and gave himself for me.&quot;\n&gt;     Galatians 2:20\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo!
