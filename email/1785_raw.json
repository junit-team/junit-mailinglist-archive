What we do is simply\nput the test classes with the code, in the same package & the same project.\nWe use different project & packages for special test classes (AllTests,\netc..).\n\nI didn&#39;t found any real problem with having the test go with the production\ncode. Actually I like it. You can never lose track of the tests, and you can\nrun them in (pre-)production if you want, just to ensure that production env\n(soft&hardware) behaves like dev.\n\nBecause we have a naming convention where every test class name begins with\n&quot;Test&quot;, it&#39;s also pretty easy to manipulate them when exporting.\nWhy hide the tests? I&#39;m proud of them! :) And I want them to be seen right\naside the class they test, so it gives a visual clue that they need to\nfollow the evolution of the class. Anyway.... :)\n\nmathieu\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: tsmets@...\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSent: Thursday, July 05, 2001 4:49 AM\nSubject: [junit] Usage of JUnit with VAfJ\n\nHas someone an opinion on where to place the JUnit tests in Visual Age for\nJava so they don&#39;t go away with the production code ?\n   _ New project(s) ?\n   _ New packages(s) ?\n\nor  simply specific names & removed them with a script ?\n\nTx,\n\nthomas,\n\n\n",
