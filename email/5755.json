As a developer, I usually have much <br/>\n&gt;control over the<br/>\n&gt;way my code is used. It is only the published interface I don&#39;t have<br/>\n&gt;&quot;full control&quot; over - I would agree that for that (hopefully rather<br/>\n&gt;small interface) your definition of robustness applies.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Agreed. If you send junk parameters to your internal private methods then nothing I can say is going to help you! ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; Actually, I&#39;m sure that contingency is addressed by the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; automotive industry. Now bringing fire near any body of<br/>\n&gt;&gt; petrol is bad, but there are ways to reduce the likelihood of<br/>\n&gt;&gt; a bad thing. Baffles in the tube leading to the petrol tank<br/>\n&gt;&gt; are an example of trying to provide hardware guard conditions.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Afaik they don&#39;t guard against putting nitroglycerin into the petrol<br/>\n&gt;tank... ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No, but they do what they can against casual attacks. In the same way that no one can stop a professional car thief from taking any car that they decide to take, yet most of us still lock our cars. Why? Because it deters most of the casual attempts.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; The project that I am winding up<br/>\n&gt;&gt; now is not life threatening, but because of volume, it does<br/>\n&gt;&gt; need to be very fast and very accurate or the CEO will be<br/>\n&gt;&gt; asking why it is failing to process about 2000 shipments an<br/>\n&gt;&gt; hour! (Not a conversation that I ever want to have!) I still<br/>\n&gt;&gt; think that it&#39;s appropriate to &quot;harden&quot; our code to handle<br/>\n&gt;&gt; the unexpected.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Aren&#39;t the goals of fast code, robust code (against misuse) and fast<br/>\n&gt;development rather competing?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not sure that I would describe it as competing, rather as challenging. We have succeeded, so I think that I have some standing to comment on this matter. (Our business sponsor actually smiles when she attends our demos! :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nGoing back to your earlier point of providing guard conditions for only the public API, that is exactly what we did. We even went so far as to create a real API for our system (callled API.java) to separate the web based front end from the back end business logic. Every call went through the API. All our method signatures were very specific data passing objects and we tested for nulls and invalid arguments as soon as possible so that the back end of the system was given the cleanest possible data. We achieved speed by pre-caching (and validating the data at pre-cache time).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; This is the concept of &quot;graceful degredation&quot;. A web browser<br/>\n&gt;&gt; is a very good example of this .... a lot of web pages have<br/>\n&gt;&gt; awful HTML and yet most of them display acceptably, because<br/>\n&gt;&gt; the browser takes what it&#39;s given and does the best it can<br/>\n&gt;&gt; with it. A browser cannot throw an exception, but it can try<br/>\n&gt;&gt; to render what it&#39;s given. All software should do the best it<br/>\n&gt;&gt; can with what it&#39;s given or when possible reject unacceptable inputs.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Yes, it probably is a good idea to make the external interface rather<br/>\n&gt;robust. But I think that the balance changes for internal communication<br/>\n&gt;of the system.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Again, I completely agree.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Regards, Ilja<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Simon<br/>\n<br/>\n-----------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nSimon P.
