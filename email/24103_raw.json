That site has been\n&gt; operated and maintained by 8thlight.com for several years, and by Object\n&gt; Mentor before that.  But it recently had a rather nasty failure, and it&#39;s\n&gt; not clear when the content that had been hosted only there will come back.\n&gt;\n&gt; Rather than spend a lot of effort recreating the old situation, I&#39;d like to\n&gt; move us to a new situation, in which the team that develops JUnit is the\n&gt; same one that develops the primary information sources about JUnit.  Along\n&gt; those lines, I&#39;d like to get the github pages for JUnit ready to be a good\n&gt; new home for junit.org.  These pages are hosted at\n&gt; http://kentbeck.github.com/junit.  They&#39;re currently pretty sad, but they\n&gt; can be edited by opening pull requests against\n&gt; https://github.com/KentBeck/junit/tree/gh-pages.  Ideally, it would be a\n&gt; visually clean single page, with a short description of what JUnit is, and\n&gt; links to downloads, javadoc, mailing list, and the wiki (\n&gt; http://github.com/kentbeck/junit/wiki), which is itself incomplete, but\n&gt; getting better day by day as a source of user documentation.\n&gt;\n&gt; If anyone feels like rolling up their sleeves and give this a try, it would\n&gt; be a great step forward.  I&#39;m out of the office all next week, but am happy\n&gt; to move quickly getting the pieces in place upon my return.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks, all,\n&gt;\n&gt;    David Saff\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
