Where have \n&gt; &gt; you been working?! :)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; This is the documented and required behavior of all Throwable objects in \n&gt; Java 1.4 and later. I&#39;m just trying to duplicate that in Java 1.3 and \n&gt; earlier.If you consult the source code for java.lang.Throwable you&#39;ll \n&gt; see something similar. I told you this was tricky. :-)\n&gt; \n&gt; By the way one place where exception objects do get assigned to \n&gt; variables is in a SAX parser, where an exception would need to be passed \n&gt; to an ErrorHandler, which then has the choice of whether to throw the \n&gt; exception or not.\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; Elliotte Rusty Harold elharo@...\n&gt; XML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!\n&gt; http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/\n&gt; http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim\n&gt;  \n&gt; \nI haven&#39;t really thought this one through or written any Learning Tests, but \nconsidering only checked Exceptions for now, is there any reason you haven&#39;t \ngot a base class that extends Exception and provides all 1.3 and earlier and \n1.4 and later exception chaining that you might need?
