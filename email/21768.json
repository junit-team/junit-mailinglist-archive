This is because our automated build uses it; if I was able to get parallel test-methods it&#39;d cut the run-time of our long-running builds to about a third. If I could get classes too I&#39;d probably aim for world-record swamping of our 16-core build server ;) Reducing wall-clock execution time of all our builds is a priority concern.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor our daily work we use IntelliJ idea v8, and while certainly &quot;nice to have&quot; the value of parallel tests in the development environment is less glaringly obvious. <br/>\n<br/>\nI was looking around in the git-snapshot of junit-4.7 code, trying to determine how/if I could do this. It seems to me like there&#39;s two basic approaches as to how to achieve this:<br/>\n<br/>\nTo get parallelization for classes you need to mess around with the runner. I&#39;m not totally familiar/comfortable with how this would be done. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor parallel methods it seems like one *should* be able to specify a &quot;Computer&quot; on the &quot;@RunWith&quot; annotation; it even seems like a logical configuration point for this information. <br/>\n<br/>\nI know this may be slightly off-topic, but I feel several &quot;tensions&quot; in the code-base around the &quot;Computer&quot;. Is this still largely work in progress?<br/>\n<br/>\nKristian<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, David Saff &lt;david@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Kristian,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 1) Can you use the 4.7 snapshot?<br/>\n&gt; 2) Are you trying to parallelize methods within a class, classes<br/>\n&gt; within a suite, or both?<br/>\n&gt; 3) What are you using to run the tests?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;    David Saff<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On Thu, Jun 18, 2009 at 6:07 AM, krosenvold&lt;kristian@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Using a RunnerBuilder and a Computer, the JUNIT 4.7 Request class creates the Runner object.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I am currently using @RunWith(SpringJUnit4ClassRunner.class) (from spring 3.0 rc) and I&#39;m trying to shoehorn parallel running into this regime, but it seems to me like these two designs are now fairly orthogonal.
