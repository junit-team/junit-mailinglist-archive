Has anyone\nseen this? Do I have something setup wrong?\n\nI&#39;ve also seen this for rename class. I did one rename of a class and\nit worked, but when I tried this on the second class it was dimmed\nout. I tried reloading the UML and creating a new UML dwg. I\ntried rebuilding the app, but I still cannot do this operation.\n\nI&#39;m using JBuilder4, JDK 1.3, and JRefactory 2.5.38.\n\nIf there is another list that is more appropriate for this message,\nplease\nsend me a note and I repost elsewhere.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n\nPCM (Paul Michali)\n\nCarrier Voice Gateway Business Unit (CVGBU)\nCisco Systems, Inc.\n250 Apollo Drive\nChelmsford, MA 01824\n\nPhone : (800) 572-6771 x 45817  (978) 244-5817 [direct]\nPaging: (800) 365-4578 [voice]  pcm@...
