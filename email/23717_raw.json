It fixes a bug in packaging that\naffected maven users who use up-to-date versions of hamcrest.  Thanks\nto the efforts of a full cast of contributors, it also contains a\ncouple dozen new features and bugfixes.\n\nThe github model is working well as a way of maintaining JUnit as a\ncommunity.  If you&#39;ve been waiting to jump in and fix that bug, now\nmay be the time.\n\nAs usual, you can download directly from\nhttps://github.com/KentBeck/junit/downloads.  In addition, the jars\nshould already be up at Maven Central, assuming I&#39;ve done it right\nthis time.\n\nRelease notes are at\nhttps://github.com/KentBeck/junit/blob/4.10/doc/ReleaseNotes4.10.txt,\nand copied below.\n\nThanks all, and keep it green,\n\n   David Saff\n\n\n\n## Summary of Changes in version 4.10 ##\n\nThanks to a full cast of contributors of bug fixes and new features.\n\nA full summary of commits between 4.9 and 4.10 is on\n[github](https://github.com/KentBeck/junit/compare/r4.9...4.10)\n\n### junit-dep has correct contents ###\n\njunit-dep-4.9.jar incorrectly contained hamcrest classes, which could\nlead to version conflicts in projects that depend on hamcrest\ndirectly.  This is fixed in 4.10 [@dsaff, closing gh-309]\n\n### RuleChain ###\n\nThe RuleChain rule allows ordering of TestRules:\n\n    public static class UseRuleChain {\n    \t@Rule\n    \tpublic TestRule chain= RuleChain\n    \t                       .outerRule(new LoggingRule(&quot;outer rule&quot;)\n    \t                       .around(new LoggingRule(&quot;middle rule&quot;)\n    \t                       .around(new LoggingRule(&quot;inner rule&quot;);\n\n    \t@Test\n    \tpublic void example() {\n    \t\tassertTrue(true);\n    \t}\n    }\n\nwrites the log\n\n    starting outer rule\n    starting middle rule\n    starting inner rule\n    finished inner rule\n    finished middle rule\n    finished outer rule\n\n### TemporaryFolder ###\n\n- `TemporaryFolder#newFolder(String... folderNames)` creates\nrecursively deep temporary folders\n  [@rodolfoliviero, closing gh-283]\n- `TemporaryFolder#newFile()` creates a randomly named new file, and\n`#newFolder()` creates a randomly named new folder\n  [@Daniel Rothmaler, closing gh-299]\n\n### Theories ###\n\nThe `Theories` runner does not anticipate theory parameters that have generic\ntypes, as reported by github#64.  Fixing this won&#39;t happen until `Theories` is\nmoved to junit-contrib. In anticipation of this, 4.9.1 adds some of the\nnecessary machinery to the runner classes, and deprecates a method that only\nthe `Theories` runner uses, `FrameworkMethod`#producesType().\nThe Common Public License that JUnit is released under is now included\nin the source repository.\n\nThanks to `@pholser` for identifying a potential resolution for github#64\nand initiating work on it.\n\n### Bug fixes ###\n\n- Built-in Rules implementations\n  - TemporaryFolder should not create files in the current working\ndirectory if applying the rule fails\n    [@orfjackal, fixing gh-278]\n  - TestWatcher and TestWatchman should not call failed for\nAssumptionViolatedExceptions\n    [@stefanbirkner, fixing gh-296]\n- Javadoc bugs\n  - Assert documentation [@stefanbirkner, fixing gh-134]\n  - ClassRule [@stefanbirkner, fixing gh-254]\n  - Parameterized  [@stefanbirkner, fixing gh-89]\n  - Parameterized, again [@orfjackal, fixing gh-285]\n- Miscellaneous\n  - Useless code in RunAfters [@stefanbirkner, fixing gh-289]\n  - Parameterized test classes should be able to have `@Category` annotations\n    [@dsaff, fixing gh-291]\n  - Error count should be initialized in\njunit.tests.framework.TestListenerTest [@stefanbirkner, fixing gh-225]\n  - AssertionFailedError constructor shouldn&#39;t call super with null\nmessage [@stefanbirkner, fixing gh-318]\n  - Clearer error message for non-static inner test classes\n[@stefanbirkner, fixing gh-42]\n\n### Minor changes ###\n\n- Description, Result and Failure are Serializable [@ephox-rob, closing gh-101]\n- FailOnTimeout is reusable, allowing for retrying Rules\n[@stefanbirkner, closing gh-265]\n- New `ErrorCollector.checkThat` overload, that allows you to specify\na reason [@drothmaler, closing gh-300]\n\n",
