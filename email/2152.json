Eventually I will add the no-asserts warning to my versions of CppUnit and JUnit.</font></p>\n\n<p><font SIZE=\"2\">Does the current JUnit have a tree view of test-cases within test-suites within other test-suites? If it did, then the lowest-level view of a single test-case could display the assert count, or perhaps turn some color if there were no asserts.</font></p>\n\n<p><font SIZE=\"2\">Did the code that someone wrote to look for TestCase subclasses in specified directory hierarchies or jar files, and automatically run them, get put into JUnit or made public?</font></p>\n\n \n</html></div>",
