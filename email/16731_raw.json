We\nare now looking at Agitator and trying to determine if, and how, it\nfits into our current practices.  I was wondering how others have\ndecided to use Agitator (or not use it).  Some of the issues we are\nstruggling with:\n\n1.  Agitator looks like it can eliminate the need to write most JUnit\ntests (except true persistence testing).  The downside is that we\nwould be left with only Agitator config files that contain our\nbusiness logic assertions.  This seems like a big leap to take, given\nthat if Agitar goes away, we have no JUnit.\n\n2.  Agitator mocks and factories look easy to create, but look like\nthey are only useful in the context of Agitator.  I couldn&#39;t use them\nfor other purposes (e.g. Fitnesse, JUnit).\n\n3.  Having my business logic tests in JUnit means they are in an\nunderstood format and things such as inputs and expected results are\nclearly visible and grouped with each test.  My impression of\nAgitator is that this wouldn&#39;t be as clear.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYahoo! Groups Links\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
