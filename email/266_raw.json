RH 6.2&#39;s default glibcs should be okay with Sun and IBM.\n&gt; If you&#39;ve upgraded them to match RH7.0&#39;s glibcs, you need to rip that out\n&gt; and reinstall good ones: RH7&#39;s glibcs are broken.  Either put 6.2&#39;s back\nin,\n&gt; or download the most recent glibcs for RH7.0.  There have been at least 3\n&gt; different upgrades for those since 7.0 came out.\n&gt;\n&gt; X11 version.
