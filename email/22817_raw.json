I was waiting to see =\r\nif someone else jumped in on this because I don&#39;t have any experience with =\r\nEJBs.\n\nThe behavior you report is certainly not how JUnit is supposed to wo=\r\nrk. @BeforeClass methods are (I thought) guaranteed to be called before any=\r\n tests in that class are called. Is it possible for you to put logging call=\r\ns in the test itself as well to verify that this invariant is not holding?\n=\r\n\nAs far running all the tests in the same context, I&#39;m afraid I can&#39;t help =\r\nwith that.\n\nRegards,\n\nKent\n\nOn Jul 22, 2010, at 4:20 PM, offlineman78 wrote=\r\n:\n\n&gt; I am having a problem where the JUnit 4 runner isn&#39;t waiting for the @=\r\nBeforeClass method to finish before running some of the tests contained wit=\r\nhin the class. I am running the tests via a webservice which calls an EJB w=\r\nhich calls JUnitCore.run(Class[])(I have also tried JUnitCore.run(Runner)).=\r\n I put a log statement at the end of the BeforeClass method and added a lis=\r\ntener to the core to log when a test starts to figure this out. Also, is th=\r\nere a way to guarentee that all the tests in a class run in the same contex=\r\nt because we are having problems with the current approach that we are gett=\r\ning EJB cross-pollution between the tests.\n&gt; \n&gt; Any help is greatly appreci=\r\nated.\n&gt; \n&gt; Matt\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been remov=\r\ned]\n\n\n",
