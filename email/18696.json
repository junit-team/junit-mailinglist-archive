    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-313252878\">Kevin:<br/>\n\tI think these are good ideas, although if I was deluged with 5000 test <br/>\ncases that I then had to validate manually, I&#39;d probably not use it. <br/>\nThis still doesn&#39;t address the issue I raised. The system would not <br/>\nproduce the test case:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt; a = new Point(0, 0);<br/>\n &gt; b = new Point(3, 4);<br/>\n &gt; assertEquals(5, a.distanceTo(b));<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>instead (since, in my example I coded the wrong distance function) it <br/>\nwould produce:<br/>\n<br/>\nassertEquals(7, a.distance(b));<br/>\n<br/>\nand the test would pass.  So I would have to manually check every <br/>\npassing test case to make sure that it was valid. Bummer.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would need be able to add something like:<br/>\n<br/>\n//** Test Point(0,0), Point(3,4), 5.0 **//<br/>\n<br/>\nas a guide to the test generator as to what was expected. Then, in <br/>\naddition to all the other valuable verification tests of corner cases, <br/>\netc.; it could generate the validation test.  In our lexicon, <br/>\nverification tests demonstrate that whatever the software is doing, it <br/>\nis doing correctly. Validation tests confirm that the software is doing <br/>\nthe correct thing.  Using both, we confirm that it is both doing the <br/>\nright thing, and doing it correctly.  Automated test generation is <br/>\nexcellent for verification, the question becomes how to we generate <br/>\nvalidation tests as well, without overloading the programmer.<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps, at this point, it is sufficient to automate the verification <br/>\ntests, and leave the validation up to the developer. Possibly, with a <br/>\nstructured requirements document, we could extract data for validation, <br/>\nand automate that as well?<br/>\n<br/>\nJust rambling,<br/>\nJim<br/>\n<br/>\nKevin Lawrence wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On 1/9/07, James P.

For<br/>\n&gt; simple cases, like your distance between two points example, the tool<br/>\n&gt; could show some examples like<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; a = new Point(0, 0);<br/>\n&gt; b = new Point(3, 4);<br/>\n&gt; assertEquals(5, a.distanceTo(b));<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; and have the developer review the cases it generates. This would get<br/>\n&gt; tedious quite quickly for methods with complex arguments though.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Kevin<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; www.junitfactory.com<br/>\n&gt; You send us code.
