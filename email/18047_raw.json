Let me be sure \nI&#39;m understanding you.  Are you saying one of these two things, or a \nthird thing entirely?\n\n1) Teams need only test that the whole system meets client requirements, \nnot the behavior of any individual class.\n2) Teams need only write all of their tests during a first-pass \n&quot;requirements&quot; phase, and not during development.\n\nThanks,\n\n    David\n\nj_cumps wrote:\n&gt; &lt;controversial&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m still not convinced of the economics of unit testing at the \n&gt; lowest level.\n&gt; I&#39;ve been lurking this list for quite some time, attended online and \n&gt; offline seminars, listened to to Agile, XP and TDD talks, ...\n&gt;\n&gt; And apply it at work.\n&gt;\n&gt; I am convinced that TDD is a right approach.\n&gt; I see big value in the agile methods.\n&gt; But to my feeling unit testing can be done at the requirements level.\n&gt;\n&gt; That&#39;s why I am thinking about testdriving this approach:\n&gt;\n&gt; 1: Write unit tests only to test the requirements.\n&gt; 2: Write the code that implements these requirements, until tests \n&gt; pass.\n&gt; 3: Run the unit tests together with a code coverage tool\n&gt; 4: delete all executable lines of code not covered by the unit test\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;/controversial&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards, Jan\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo!
