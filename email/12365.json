    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1955449518\">Thank you. You are correct and in fact I did write my<br/>\nown test runner. After a little more playing (after I<br/>\nsent the previous email) I figured it out. My problem<br/>\nwas this... I am dynamically creating the classes with<br/>\nmy own custom loader. The primary reason is partly<br/>\nwhat the junit faq/docs say about its own custom<br/>\nloader use being a problem, and that is, my testcase<br/>\nclasses and 3rd party libraries are not on the<br/>\napplication classpath. Because of this, I need a way<br/>\nto add various URL locations to my custom loader, such<br/>\nas the compiled classes output of testcases and<br/>\nlocations of any 3rd party libraries the tests may<br/>\nuse, such as jfcUnit, httpUnit, and junit. Junit is on<br/>\nour main application classpath, but the others are<br/>\nnot.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy harness actually runs embedded in the application<br/>\nbeing tested (at least for the UI side), so that you<br/>\ncan run an individual testcase right from the UI. This<br/>\nis especially helpful for developers who write unit<br/>\ntests and/or GUI automation tests that want to test<br/>\ntheir functional area as they work. Having to drop<br/>\ndown and run ant and try to specify a specific test to<br/>\nrun is a pain in the arse, especially when you have<br/>\nhundreds or thousands of them over a period of time.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo because my classes are loaded dynamicaly AND the<br/>\nselected method to execute is also dynamic, I was<br/>\nhaving trouble using junit to get the result set of<br/>\nthe test run. I want to get something similar to the<br/>\njunit output that in ant you can generate xml/html<br/>\nfrom and see a nice web report.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe solution, as I found out was<br/>\nTestSuite.createTest(Class clazz, String<br/>\nmethodNameToExecute);<br/>\n<br/>\nVery nice they already had that in place. So after a<br/>\ncouple hours, I was able to get a TestResult back and<br/>\npurposely fail some tests and see that in the test<br/>\nresult. I am quite the happy camper this weekend. I<br/>\nthought it was going to take me a long time to get all<br/>\nthis working.<br/>\n<br/>\nOriginally my harness was not based on anything, not<br/>\neven junit. But I figured I want the least common<br/>\ndenominator, JUnit in this case, so that I Can atleast<br/>\nutilize existing unit tests that our developers have<br/>\nalready done, as well as allow for the UI automation<br/>\ntestcases and a little later httpUnit automation<br/>\ntesting as well, all runnable from the one harness in<br/>\nan easy to use GUI. While tests run the harness will<br/>\nupdate the status of each testcase (or possibly wait<br/>\nuntil they are all done to reduce hindering test run<br/>\nperformance).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Russell Gold &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:russgold@...\">russgold@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; On Sat, 20 Nov 2004 01:09:12 -0000,<br/>\n&gt; supreme_java_guru_1<br/>\n&gt; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:supreme_java_guru_1@...\">supreme_java_guru_1@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hi all,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I am working on a GUI test harness that will run<br/>\n&gt; GUI tests, unit tests<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and http tests. Long story short, the GUI harness<br/>\n&gt; helps in building<br/>\n&gt; &gt; test suites. Part of this harness is allowing the<br/>\n&gt; user to add new<br/>\n&gt; &gt; testcases in a graphical tree, define the class<br/>\n&gt; name, and the methods<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of the class. All of this is embeddable within<br/>\n&gt; existing applications,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; such as a Swing GUI app to allow a developer to<br/>\n&gt; quickly assemble and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; execute individual tests without having to drop to<br/>\n&gt; the command line.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; All of this works presently. My one BIG problem is<br/>\n&gt; trying to get the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; test results from the test cases that are ran, so<br/>\n&gt; that I can embed<br/>\n&gt; &gt; something similar to the &lt;junitreport&gt; task that<br/>\n&gt; ant has. After a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; single test, or a group of tests run, I want my<br/>\n&gt; harness to show the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; output.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; My initial thought was that I did not have to<br/>\n&gt; execute a junit TestCase<br/>\n&gt; &gt; through the junit run(TestResult) method.<br/>\n&gt; Basically, I was hoping I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; could somehow get the assertXxx() output directly.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Essentially you are looking at writing your own test<br/>\n&gt; runner. You can<br/>\n&gt; look at numerous examples of this - look at how ant<br/>\n&gt; implements the<br/>\n&gt; junit task, look at the open source project JUnitEE<br/>\n&gt; or the<br/>\n&gt; JUnitServlet included with HttpUnit - all are<br/>\n&gt; examples of custom test<br/>\n&gt; runners which can produce their results as xml.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________ <br/>\nDo you Yahoo!? <br/>\nThe all-new My Yahoo! - Get yours free! <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://my.yahoo.com\">http://my.yahoo.com</a></div>",
