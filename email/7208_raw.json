Similarly, once B1, B2, and B3 have\npassed, a failure in A has to be in the A code, rather than\nsomewhere under A in the calling hierarchy.\n\nWhen a test of A fails, the input conditions for the failure\nare given. The first breakpoint I set is usually at the \nassertion that failed, to see what the results were and to\nexamine values.\n\nOften, that information is sufficient to reveal the bug.\nSometimes, I need to examine A&#39;s state, so I rerun\nthe test and visit A to find out. I now *should* have\nenough information to see the problem -- but only because \nthe bug is necessarily limited to A, and does not lie any \nlower in the calling hierarchy.\n\nAnything beyond a cursory examination of the object&#39;s\nstate, however, is a significant indicator.\n\nIf the method is too complex, or its underlying parts are \ninsufficiently tested, or both, I find myself tracing the\ncode to follow the logic -- and that symptom pretty clearly\nindicates that the code needs more refactoring and/or more\ntesting.\n\n\nErik Hanson wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;steven.hale@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Does junit make debuggers obsolete? Are there situations where junit in\n&gt; &gt; partnership with logging isn&#39;t sufficient?\n&gt; \n&gt; In my experience, unit testing makes logging obsolete and makes the debugger\n&gt; much more powerful.\n&gt; \n&gt; When I have a problem that I can&#39;t figure out by looking at the code, I just\n&gt; set a breakpoint in a test, run the test, and examine the variables. Logging\n&gt; forces you to guess ahead of time what you&#39;re going to want to see, but\n&gt; debugging lets you choose what you w ant to see at runtime.\n&gt; \n&gt; I find that much easier than putting in logging statements, wading through\n&gt; logging output, and then removing the logging statements. It also saves me\n&gt; from reading the output from the logging statements that others on the team\n&gt; have accidentally left in.\n&gt; \n&gt; Erik Hanson\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
