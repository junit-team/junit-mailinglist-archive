I<br/>\n&gt; actually did have an equals() method in SimpleMsg,  but when I<br/>\n&gt; looked more closely, I realised that the argument should have<br/>\n&gt; been of type Object rather than of type &#39;SimpleMsg&#39;.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>&lt;/james&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nright...the reason you don&#39;t want to write equals(YourClass) is that<br/>\nif you stuff an instance of YourClass in, say, a collection, then<br/>\ngo searching for it, it won&#39;t be equals(YourClass) called by the<br/>\ncollection class to report equality, but equals(Object).  if you<br/>\ndon&#39;t define equals(Object), then the version supplied by Object<br/>\nitself is invoked, and that&#39;s usually not what you mean.<br/>\n<br/>\ncheers,<br/>\np</div>",
