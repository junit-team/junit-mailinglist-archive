That way I could put th=\r\ne test code into the same packages, but use Ant to strip it out of the fina=\r\nl build. I do the same with the documentation that I generate. We use Javad=\r\nocs to generate internal documentation only, ant runs the javadoc but doesn=\r\n&#39;t include that into the released jar.\n\tOur drive to remove the code was tw=\r\no-fold. (1) To keep the jar as small as possible because we are sometimes p=\r\nushing this code over 33.6k lines to rather out of the way places. (2) Word=\r\n from the mountain was that test code and javadocs are considered internal =\r\ncode only and could not be included in the final customer jars.\n\n\nChip\n----=\r\n-\n&quot;I&#39;m sure looters don&#39;t call it looting.
