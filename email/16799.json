In my<br/>\nexperience, it&#39;s much easier to add tests to code that has been designed for<br/>\ntestability.  Take one developer that used TDD to deliver a project, and one<br/>\nthat added tests afterwards and pass the results to a talented QA engineer.<br/>\nI would bet that the QA person is much more productive adding tests to the<br/>\nfirst system.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers!<br/>\nCarl<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://genomescampaigns.blogspot.com\">http://genomescampaigns.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
