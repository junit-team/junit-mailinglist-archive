In other \n&gt;words, I don&#39;t want to deploy the bean and it&#39;s home/remote/local \n&gt;interfaces. Not yet anyway. I wanted to first test the underlying \n&gt;code. Once that is working, then I&#39;ll test the remote invocation of \n&gt;this code.\n&gt;\n&gt;To do this I would have to instantiate the bean&#39;s class in some way, \n&gt;but as there is no contructor in an EJB (this is a stateless session \n&gt;bean, by the way). How could I go about doing this *without* having \n&gt;to add a temporary constructor just for the purposes of unit testing?\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\nI generally use stateless session beans as a gateway to some other \nobject (POJO) which I can test outside of the EJB container.  In other \nwords, the stateless session bean merely delegates to another object \nwhich does have a constructor.\n\nMike\n\n-- \nMike Clark\nhttp://clarkware.com\n(720) 851-2014\n\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
