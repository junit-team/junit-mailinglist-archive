I have to\n&gt; admit, I haven&#39;t used one in years, because floating-point arithmetic\n&gt; irks me.\n\nI&#39;m not the OP ( Anna Skawinska )\nand I generally don&#39;t do &quot;me too&quot; posts, but\nJB is on to a critical question. In general, Djkstra was wrong,\nit should have been &quot;float considered harmful&quot; for 99% of\nprogrammers and programs. Use of floating point\narithmetic is to be avoided because it is a bug farm.\n\nIt is criminal to use floating point when you want to represent\nmoney, and in many other cases, fixed point is vastly\nsuperior. Clearly some subfields need it, engineering calculations,\nFFT, DSP, etc. But I&#39;ve been a professional developer\nfor over 30 years, and I&#39;ve only had two cases (each for only\na few months each) where using floating point was\nthe correct answer.\n\nProper numerical analysis and algorithms for floating point\nnumbers is an art, and there are many non-obvious problems.\nRapid/Extreme programming is not well suited to\nfloating point work (and double and even quad precision don&#39;t\naddress the fundamental problems.)\n\nIf you have a choice, don&#39;t use float.\n\n-- \nPat Farrell\nhttp://www.pfarrell.com/\n\n\n",
