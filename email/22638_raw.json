MethodRule allows you to do things\n&gt; based on the specific test name, and intercept and even replace the\n&gt; running of a test. Consider ExpectedException. You really could not\n&gt; do anything like that in a @Before or @After method. You would have\n&gt; to do it inside your test and use an execute around pattern to handle\n&gt; the exception.\n\nYour point concerning ExpectedException is valid, but arguing that\nmethod rules are even more useful than class rules does not say anything\nabout class rules being unuseful.\n\n&gt; For your use case it is a drop more boilerplate than a rule, but all\n&gt; you would do is define a @Before method in a common superclass or in\n&gt; your @Before call a class that encapsulates the functionality. Yes\n&gt; you have to wrap the call in a method rather than defining a field,\n&gt; but Java is kind of verbose already.\n\n&quot;Java is verbose already&quot; is not a good reason to make things even more\nunnecessarily verbose.\n\nYou say I should write:\n\n    public static MyThing myThing =\n        new MyThing(MyEnclosingTestClass.class);\n\n    @BeforeClass public static void beforeClass() {\n        myThing.begin();\n    }\n\n    @AfterClass public static void afterClass() {\n        myThing.end();\n    }\n\nI want to write:\n\n    @Rule public static MyThing myThing = new MyThing();\n\nPersonally, I think the second is self-evidently greatly advantageous.\n\n * Much less boilerplate in each test using the common code.\n * Don&#39;t need to repeat yourself nearly as much.\n * No risk of forgetting the teardown.\n\nMax.\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
