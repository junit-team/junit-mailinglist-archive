Here are my reasons:\n\n1) It makes the whole process of=\r\n writing test cases more complicated. Also, the writing test cases is now c=\r\noupled with writing test data. A tester cannot work exclusively on writing =\r\ntest data without concerning  himself from the test cases. This leads to co=\r\nupling. We should allow the user to write test data separately from the tes=\r\nt case.\n\n2) We, as developers, get only a fraction of the time to write tes=\r\nt cases, and therefore the less time we have to spend on writing and execut=\r\ning the test cases, the better.\n\n3) There is a problem of maintenance here.=\r\n I personally believe that, the less you make a user depend on your framewo=\r\nrk, the better it is. Junit&#39;s @Test is actually a classic example of how ea=\r\nsy it is to get up and running without the user thinking about any external=\r\n dependencies. The user doesn&#39;t have to follow a nice learning curve and kn=\r\now the APIs. That&#39;s where annotations are so powerful. \n\n4) In your above g=\r\nist as well(just like the previous one), a user has to provide annotation a=\r\nt the method level, which, as I pointed out before, can and ideally should =\r\nbe avoided. The user should be able to say(in terms of writing test cases) =\r\nsomething like : &quot;Here is my test data which contains data for each test me=\r\nthod I have in my test class. Now run all the methods that are Tests and pa=\r\nss the right parameters to them.&quot;\n\nWell, that&#39;s where atleast my money lies=\r\n and that&#39;s what I have tried to capture in EasyTest.\n\nAgain, it is a philo=\r\nsophical discussion which can have a lot of rights and wrongs. Whenever I d=\r\nesign any software, my philosophy always is: &quot;Think about what the users wo=\r\nuld be required to learn/code about my software, in order to get up and run=\r\nning with my system.&quot; The less the user needs to learn and depend on an ext=\r\nernal system, the better and faster the development. Obviously, there are s=\r\nituations where certain things cannot be avoided, and then we make informed=\r\n decisions. :)\n\nCheers!\nAnuj\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, Matthew Farwell=\r\n &lt;matthew@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; One thing that you can&#39;t do is stack runners, so =\r\nyou can&#39;t use Enclosed in\n&gt; conjunction with other runners. I&#39;m sure there =\r\nwas an issue to allow\n&gt; multiple runners for a test class, but I can&#39;t find=\r\n it now. I think this is\n&gt; an avenue to explore anyway.\n&gt; \n&gt; My motivation =\r\nhere is to group all my tests for one class together in one\n&gt; test class, i=\r\nt&#39;s true. Instead of having one FooTest, I&#39;ve got FooTest,\n&gt; FooBarTest, Fo=\r\noBazTest.\n&gt; \n&gt; If you don&#39;t like names of methods (which I can understand),=\r\n what if we had\n&gt; a class name which was instantiated (like the dataProvide=\r\nrClass in my\n&gt; example), which had to implement an interface? This require =\r\na local static\n&gt; class for each test, which would be acceptable. Bit more b=\r\noilerplate, but\n&gt; never mind.\n&gt; \n&gt; Using this gist: https://gist.github.com=\r\n/3471426, and imagining that the\n&gt; names are not fixed, and that the method=\r\n of running isn&#39;t decided (but I\n&gt; would prefer to use Parameterized).\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n Matthew Farwell.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2012/8/28 David Saff &lt;saff@...&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m glad this=\r\n discussion is going on.  I don&#39;t have a comprehensive opinion\n&gt; &gt; yet, but=\r\n did want to tip my hand on one bias, in case it guides future\n&gt; &gt; conversa=\r\ntion.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m not likely to be very keen on adding any features to JUni=\r\nt core whose\n&gt; &gt; primary motivation is to reduce the number of classes in a=\r\n suite.  If a\n&gt; &gt; user wants to do two different things, but have them acce=\r\nssible in the file\n&gt; &gt; system in one place, the Enclosed runner is always a=\r\nvailable:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; @RunWith(Enclosed.class)\n&gt; &gt; public class FooTest {\n&gt; &gt;  =\r\n public static class Thing1 { ... }\n&gt; &gt;   public static class Thing2 { ... =\r\n}\n&gt; &gt; }\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; IMHO, classes are how Java groups methods and data that bel=\r\nong together.\n&gt; &gt;  I&#39;m reluctant to introduce new ways of grouping (such as=\r\n annotations on\n&gt; &gt; methods that contain the names of other methods) if equ=\r\nivalent class-based\n&gt; &gt; techniques will work.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;    David Saff\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; On Tue, Aug 28, 2012 at 10:23 AM, Anuj &lt;anujkumar1516@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; **\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Het Matthew,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I think my previous mai=\r\nl got lost as I cannot see it being delivered to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the group even after=\r\n 3 hours.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; So here is my response once again:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 1) Parameter=\r\nized runner does not work in a way that I was talking about\n&gt; &gt; &gt; DataLoade=\r\nr below. It has the drawback that if you provide a single set of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; test=\r\n data for multiple methods, it will pass all the test data to all the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n methods. Have a look at this blog post for more clarification of the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n Parameterized Runner and its drawback:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; http://www.kumaranuj.com/=\r\n2012/08/junits-parameterized-runner-and-data.html\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 2) I feel a n=\r\new runner would be a better approach although I do not know\n&gt; &gt; &gt; what all =\r\nfeature set will this runner support.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 3) I feel it is easier an=\r\nd also simpler if we get rid of the whole idea\n&gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; providing metho=\r\nd names. I say this because in real world scenario, no two\n&gt; &gt; &gt; test metho=\r\nds will have exactly the same set of test data. Thus the name\n&gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nthe method should suffice instead of asking the user to explicitly\n&gt; &gt; spec=\r\nify\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the method name in the annotation. But thats just my approach.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I feel this requires more input from the community.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; C=\r\nheers!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Anuj\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In junit@yahoogroups.com, Matthew F=\r\narwell &lt;matthew@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sorry for any misunderstanding, I =\r\nagree that there are parts which need\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be clarified.

I was caught up in a lot of other stuff.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I s=\r\naw the proposal for @DataProvider and it looks a good start, but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; IMHO=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it might not turn out to be a great one. Here are some reasons w=\r\nhy I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; feel\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; such apprehension:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1)The anno=\r\ntation currently is applied per method, which means that if\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there=\r\n is a single class providing the input test data for 10 test\n&gt; &gt; &gt; methods,=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the user has to apply the annotation over each test method. This=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; seems\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; undesirable as it promotes duplicacy within the test c=\r\nlass. Moreover,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; running each test method would mean extra process=\r\ning, which can be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; avoided\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; by making the annotation support =\r\nElementType.TYPE as well. I have a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; similar\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; annotation(@Data=\r\nLoader)in my test framework, EasyTest that supports\n&gt; &gt; &gt; such a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nbehavior.(\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; https://github.com/anujgandharv/easytest/blo=\r\nb/master/src/main/java/org/easytest/annotation/DataLoader.java\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; )\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you have a single set of data which applies =\r\nto all of the test\n&gt; &gt; &gt; methods,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then you can use the current impl=\r\nementation of Parameterized. My point\n&gt; &gt; &gt; was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that I wish to have=\r\n two methods which have separate sets of data, so\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; therefore I have =\r\nto specify the DataProvider multiple times. Unless of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; course, you&#39;r=\r\ne suggesting that if we specify @DataProvider at class\n&gt; &gt; &gt; level,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n it has the same effect as the current Parameterized? I wouldn&#39;t object\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2)It is not clear from the disc=\r\nussion which JUnit Runner will support\n&gt; &gt; &gt; this\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; annotation: Par=\r\nameterized or Theories or there would be a new Runner.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I =\r\nwas planning to modify Parameterized, but a new runner would be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; acc=\r\neptable.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3)It would be nice if we give some sen=\r\nse of direction to the user\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; regarding the structure of DataProvid=\r\nerClass and the method it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; supports.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So, something like :\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Class&lt;? extends Provider&gt; dataProviderClass() default\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; EmptyProvider.class;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Again, forcing people to use an=\r\n interface for the external classes\n&gt; &gt; was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; my\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; first thought.=\r\n However, since we&#39;re specifying the name of the method\n&gt; &gt; in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; our =\r\nDataProvider (if dataProviderClass is not specified), why not be\n&gt; &gt; able\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; to specify it in the dataProviderClass? The main difference would be=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the method would need to be static in our class, whereas =\r\nin the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dataProviderClass it could be non-static.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3)=\r\nI somehow get the feeling(and it could be simply me and if that is\n&gt; &gt; the\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; case, please ignore me) that the aspect of performing Data Driven=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Testing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; should be given more time, and proper thought shou=\r\nld be put in around\n&gt; &gt; &gt; its\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; design and the way it will be made =\r\navailable to the end users. I feel\n&gt; &gt; &gt; we\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; should not rush into =\r\ndeveloping a feature focusing a single use\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; case/requirement, rath=\r\ner we should try to first gather and understand\n&gt; &gt; &gt; all\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the asp=\r\nects of Data Driven Testing and then develop that requirement\n&gt; &gt; &gt; as a\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; whole rather than in pieces.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m not rush=\r\ning, that&#39;s why I&#39;m asking the question on the junit\n&gt; &gt; mailing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; li=\r\nst :-) However, I think this is a generalization of the current usage\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Parameterized, and this would be useful, to me at least.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Matthew.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I wo=\r\nuld be much more beneficial to the community as a whole.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Anuj\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In junit@yahoogr=\r\noups.com, Matthew Farwell &lt;matthew@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hello,\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sorry this took so long to get back to you, but I w=\r\nas trying to get\n&gt; &gt; &gt; my\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thoughts together.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I don&#39;t believe that the suggestion below fits in with the current\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; JUnit\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; philospohy, so doesn&#39;t belong in the junit core libra=\r\nry.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Specifically, I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; don&#39;t think CSV/Excel/XML parsing bel=\r\nongs in JUnit, so I agree with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; your\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; decision to write it =\r\nas an extension rather than as part of junit\n&gt; &gt; &gt; core.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; However, I do believe that we can add stuff to JUnit core in order\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; allow\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; people to do this sort of thing more easil=\r\ny, and maybe help you\n&gt; &gt; with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; your\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; code as well.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I often have the following problem: I&#39;ve got a class Foo i=\r\nn which\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; testing multiple methods (foo#addInts & foo#add=\r\nStrings). So I\n&gt; &gt; create\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; single class to test the two.=\r\n But if either of these methods are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; better\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tested using p=\r\narameterized, then I can&#39;t do it because I have to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; define\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; t=\r\nhe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; constructor. So, what I would propose is to have a @DataProv=\r\nider\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; annotation\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; which specifies a method to call whic=\r\nh returns a collection of data\n&gt; &gt; &gt; for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this particular method=\r\n.
