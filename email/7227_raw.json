I don&#39;t think\nthey do.  So, if you want your API to support it, then add\nisResultSetClosed() and isPreparedStatementClosed() to your class --\ndepending on your need you could just check a simple state variable that\nsays whether they are closed (setting that when you close them) or you\ncould do some magic on the instance variables that programmatically\ndetermines whether they are closed (I think that&#39;s overkill).\n\nIs this something you need only for the test?  If so, I don&#39;t think that\nit is necessary.  Just depend on the 3rd party API and trust it until\nsuch time that you have a valid reason not to trust it.  If/When that\ncomes to be, write a test case that demonstrates the problem, then\ndesign a solution (like invalidate the PS or RS).\n\n=jason\n[:question | ^One] \n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: wxcodemaster [mailto:wxcodemaster@...] \nSent: Friday, March 14, 2003 1:23 AM\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: [junit] please help - was connection closed?\n\n\ni have a method within factory class A that does\nrs.close()    (ResultSet)\nstmt.close()   (PreparedStatement)\n\nin my junit test class i want to check\nthat after execution of this method\nrs and stmt are really closed.\n\nis there an easy way to do this?
