The find | xargs perl<br/>\nregex approach is as safe as any mechanism that doesn&#39;t provide visual<br/>\nconfirmation of every edit, and it&#39;s far faster if the number of files<br/>\nis substantial.  Of course, the same thing could be done on a<br/>\nfile-by-file basis in emacs, vi, or any other real programmer&#39;s editor. <br/>\nBut i&#39;ll bet even fewer programmers are using professional-grade editors<br/>\nthan are using version control.  At best, they use whatever<br/>\npoint-and-drool junk is included with their IDE.  At worst, they use<br/>\nNotepad.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry about that little rant.  I guess i&#39;m just bitter at the sorry<br/>\nstate of affairs in my industry, and the widespread ignorance of basic<br/>\ntools and programming techniques like version control, decent editors,<br/>\nand regular expressions (not to mention unit testing!).  Far too often,<br/>\ni see programmers trying to press a nail into a board with their bare<br/>\nhands, and complaining that their hand hurts.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; And congratulations on writing the first entry ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Maybe if i&#39;m feeling ambitious i&#39;ll write a few more.  :}<br/>\n-- <br/>\n<br/>\nDavid Stagner<br/>\n<br/>\nNational Marrow Donor Program<br/>\n3001 Broadway Street NE<br/>\nBroadway Ridge Suite 500<br/>\nMinneapolis, MN  55413<br/>\n<br/>\nEmail: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dstagner@...\">dstagner@...</a></div>",
