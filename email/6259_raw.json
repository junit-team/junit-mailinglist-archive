We have a=\r\n lot of business logic in our database\n&gt; and it makes testing difficult bec=\r\nause mocking the database would require\n&gt; re-implementing the logic in Java=\r\n.\n\nUnfortunately, I don&#39;t have control over this. For the most part\nwe don&#39;=\r\nt have much business logic in the DB, but I&#39;m not empowered\nto change any o=\r\nf this if I wanted to.\n\n&gt; We coded up a TestSuite that finds all the tests =\r\nin the project (which is\n&gt; pretty fast because they all start with &quot;_&quot; so w=\r\ne don&#39;t have to use\n&gt; &quot;instanceof&quot; to figure out if they are tests or not) =\r\nand executes them.\n&gt; \n&gt; We also threw in some fun options like only running=\r\n tests in certain\n&gt; packages and running the tests in order of their execut=\r\nion speed (we have\n&gt; some really slow tests, which I know is bad, but there=\r\n&#39;s not too much we\n&gt; can do about it).\n&gt; \n&gt; It can also run just those test=\r\ns that have been compiled in the last 10\n&gt; minutes plus tests for any class=\r\nes that have been compiled in the last 10\n&gt; minutes. (So if you modify meth=\r\nod A.foo() and class B calls A.foo(), then\n&gt; _ATest and _BTest will be exec=\r\nuted.) This is to get around the problem of\n&gt; our test suite being really s=\r\nlow, which is something that I want to fix\n&gt; but cannot (for non-technical =\r\nreasons).\n\nWOW!!! That sounds much better than the other utilities I&#39;ve bee=\r\nn\nable to find for this, and certainly more feature-rich than I&#39;d have\ntime=\r\n to write myself. Any chance that the TestSuite you write would\nbe availabl=\r\ne?\n\nAnyway, thanks for the feedback!\n\n-- Michael Chermside\n\n\n",
