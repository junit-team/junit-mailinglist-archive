It&#39;s quite useful for debugging purposes when some tests break on a specific node.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe rely on some deprecated code in order to do that, like BlockJUnit4ClassRunner.withBefores. So we were wondering if we can reimplement it with rules. It seems that the only way would be to retrofit every base test class and isolated test case class with the necessary rules. Is that correct? Or have some sort of global rules been implemented that apply for all tests?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks a lo<br/>\nGiuliano</div>",
