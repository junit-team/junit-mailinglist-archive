The tool would stop as soon as it\nreach the ceiling and suggest that the method be\nbroken down further.\n\nCheers,\nOle\n\n\n\n--- &quot;James P. Gunderson&quot; &lt;jgunders@...&gt;\nwrote:\n\n&gt; Kevin:\n&gt; \tI think these are good ideas, although if I was\n&gt; deluged with 5000 test \n&gt; cases that I then had to validate manually, I&#39;d\n&gt; probably not use it. \n&gt; This still doesn&#39;t address the issue I raised. The\n&gt; system would not \n&gt; produce the test case:\n&gt;  &gt; a = new Point(0, 0);\n&gt;  &gt; b = new Point(3, 4);\n&gt;  &gt; assertEquals(5, a.distanceTo(b));\n&gt; \n&gt; instead (since, in my example I coded the wrong\n&gt; distance function) it \n&gt; would produce:\n&gt; \n&gt; assertEquals(7, a.distance(b));\n&gt; \n&gt; and the test would pass.  So I would have to\n&gt; manually check every \n&gt; passing test case to make sure that it was valid.\n&gt; Bummer.\n&gt; \n&gt; I would need be able to add something like:\n&gt; \n&gt; //** Test Point(0,0), Point(3,4), 5.0 **//\n&gt; \n&gt; as a guide to the test generator as to what was\n&gt; expected. Then, in \n&gt; addition to all the other valuable verification\n&gt; tests of corner cases, \n&gt; etc.; it could generate the validation test.  In our\n&gt; lexicon, \n&gt; verification tests demonstrate that whatever the\n&gt; software is doing, it \n&gt; is doing correctly. Validation tests confirm that\n&gt; the software is doing \n&gt; the correct thing.  Using both, we confirm that it\n&gt; is both doing the \n&gt; right thing, and doing it correctly.  Automated test\n&gt; generation is \n&gt; excellent for verification, the question becomes how\n&gt; to we generate \n&gt; validation tests as well, without overloading the\n&gt; programmer.\n&gt; \n&gt; Perhaps, at this point, it is sufficient to automate\n&gt; the verification \n&gt; tests, and leave the validation up to the developer.\n&gt; Possibly, with a \n&gt; structured requirements document, we could extract\n&gt; data for validation, \n&gt; and automate that as well?\n&gt; \n&gt; Just rambling,\n&gt; Jim\n&gt; \n&gt; Kevin Lawrence wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; On 1/9/07, James P.

For\n&gt; &gt; simple cases, like your distance between two\n&gt; points example, the tool\n&gt; &gt; could show some examples like\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; a = new Point(0, 0);\n&gt; &gt; b = new Point(3, 4);\n&gt; &gt; assertEquals(5, a.distanceTo(b));\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; and have the developer review the cases it\n&gt; generates. This would get\n&gt; &gt; tedious quite quickly for methods with complex\n&gt; arguments though.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Kevin\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; www.junitfactory.com\n&gt; &gt; You send us code.
