I&#39;d be leery of a class that generates HTML and sorts. If the<br/>\n&gt;&gt;sort is an another class, it can be public and far easier to test.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;    <br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;ve always wondered why most developers are highly offended by making  <br/>\n&gt;things more public for purposes of testing, yet they have no problem  <br/>\n&gt;consistently and willingly violating cohesion. I suspect that it&#39;s the  <br/>\n&gt;same reason most developers worry about performance more than good  <br/>\n&gt;design: it&#39;s easier to quantify.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think that lack of protection is just easier to see.  Lack of cohesion <br/>\nrequires trained eyes.  I have to admit that every time I teach the <br/>\n&#39;Single Responsibility Principle&#39; I feel a little odd.  It&#39;s not like <br/>\nyou can use a check list which tells you whether you&#39;re violating it or <br/>\nnot, you just have to show people enough examples for them to &#39;get it.&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt reminds me of the Supreme Court of the US.  There was a time when <br/>\nobscenity cases were all the rage.  Producers of movies, pictures, and <br/>\nstories were prosecuted all the way up to the Supreme Court on obscenity <br/>\ngrounds, and the Court was unable to articulate a definition of <br/>\nobscenity which drew a line between pornography and free speech.  Some <br/>\nSaturdays the Justices would get together to view the films in evidence <br/>\nand make their decision.  Justice Potter Stewart said (paraphrasing) &quot;I <br/>\nmay not be able to define obscenity, but I know it when I see it.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMichael Feathers<br/>\nwww.objectmentor.com</div>",
