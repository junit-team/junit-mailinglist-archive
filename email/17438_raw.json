The intent would be much clearer,\n&gt;  &gt;&gt; &gt; wouldn&#39;t it?\n&gt;  &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;&gt;\n&gt;  &gt;&gt; Maybe. What do people think? For me, @BeforeClass and @AfterClass\n&gt;  &gt;&gt; already mean &quot;before everything coming from _this_ class&quot;, and &quot;after\n&gt;  &gt;&gt; everything coming from _this_ class&quot;, whether that&#39;s all the methods on\n&gt;  &gt;&gt; a test class, or all the classes referenced from a Suite class. This\n&gt;  &gt;&gt; means that @BeforeClass has a consistent meaning on both suite classes\n&gt;  &gt;&gt; and test classes. If suite classes have BeforeSuite, and test classes\n&gt;  &gt;&gt; have BeforeClass, then what does BeforeClass mean on a suite class? What\n&gt;  &gt;&gt; does BeforeSuite mean on a test class? It seems that fewer concepts is\n&gt;  &gt;&gt; better.\n&gt;  &gt;&gt;\n&gt;  &gt;&gt; Thoughts from frequent JUnit users?\n&gt;  &gt;&gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Would it completely suck to implement this as @BeforeSuite, rather than\n&gt;  &gt; @BeforeClass, and let @BeforeClass be an alias for @BeforeSuite? This\n&gt;  &gt; way, people will tend to use @BeforeClass with the default suite (all\n&gt;  &gt; tests in this class).\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Perhaps the Suite concept in JUnit 4 deserves to figure more prominently.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ll be honest--I think I have internal definitions of what &quot;class&quot; and\n&gt; &quot;suite&quot; are that are preventing me from grasping what is probably an\n&gt; excellent suggestion. Could you write up some code examples?\n\nThis ain&#39;t code, but maybe it&#39;ll help. Bear in mind I&#39;m handcuffed by my \nbias towards JUnit 3.\n\n@BeforeClass makes a set up method run before running all the tests in \nthat test case class (any class with at least one @Test in it).\n\n@BeforeSuite would make a set up method run before running all the tests \nin an arbitrary JUnit 3-style test suite, which might be composed of \ntests from multiple classes.\n\nI know you have that @RunWith annotation or something, where you specify \na list of test case classes to run. Perhaps a @BeforeSuite method in the \nclass that defines that annotation would cause the set up method to run \nbefore all the tests in that suite, rather than before each of the \nsuites collected from each of the test case classes.\n\nDid that help you understand what I have in mind?\n-- \nJ.
