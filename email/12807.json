I&#39;m new to unit testing so please bear with me. I have a<br/>\nmethod that contains a lot of try and catch statements:<br/>\n<br/>\ntry{<br/>\n\tstatement1<br/>\n\tstatement2<br/>\n}<br/>\ncatch(ExceptionType1 e1){<br/>\n\tSystem.err.println(&quot;The following exception occurred &quot; +<br/>\ne1.toString());<br/>\n}<br/>\n<br/>\nI know that this is not a very good way of handling exceptions but I&#39;m<br/>\nstruggling to find a better way. Another alternative is to use a logger<br/>\nsuch as log4j, but this does not help much. The problem is how do I test<br/>\nif the method is not working properly, as the exception was caught and<br/>\nwon&#39;t be visible to JUnit.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe most obvious solution would be to let the method throw all<br/>\nexceptions that are generated. The problem is that there are 5 or 6<br/>\ndifferent types of exceptions that this method can generate and this<br/>\nseems to make my code very messy.<br/>\n<br/>\nCould anyone please tell me what is the proper approach to this, or<br/>\nrefer me to any relevant reading.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance.<br/>\nPico</div>",
