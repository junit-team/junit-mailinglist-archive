If \nyou select a TestSuite (or, actually, anything that is not a TestCase \nsubclass) the Run button is disabled.\n\nThe reason behind that -- I think -- is that for every test to be \natomic, it need to be reloaded before running. It&#39;s easy to reload a \nTestCase subclass. It would be harder to reload a TestSuite or an \nobject implementing the Test interface.\n\nWhat I&#39;m proposing is to implement a &quot;junit.framework.Reloadable&quot; \ninterface to allow tests that aren&#39;t subclasses of the &quot;TestCase&quot; \nclass to be reloaded and rerun from the Swing GUI. That interface \nwould only have one method:\n\npublic Test reload();\n\nOr maybe the java.lang.Cloneable interface could be used.\n\nAnyway, I will implement those changes locally because it&#39;s a feature \nI really need. If you think it could be a good thing to include in \nJUnit, let me know and I&#39;ll send you the source code.\n\n\nAlexandre\n\n\n\n",
