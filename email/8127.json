This runner <br/>\nshould extract the tests either from jar file package or file system <br/>\nclass in a transparent way unlike two separate classes as in <br/>\nJUNIT-ADD-on i.e DirectorySuiteBuilder  and ArchiveSuiteBuilder..<br/>\n<br/>\nBy doing this, i would be eliminating all the TestXYZPackageSuite class <br/>\nwhich has suite method. This suite method creates a Test out all the <br/>\npackage classes and includes  suites of sub packages.<br/>\n<br/>\nI tried write some thing on my own using JUNIT-Addon&#39;s but looks like <br/>\nDirectorySuiteBuilder expects the directory in a similar lines of class <br/>\npath, i.e if there is java class in <br/>\n/home/classes/com/sun/rewriter/util/Parser.class then i need to give <br/>\ndirectory name as /home/classes and not <br/>\n/home/classes/com/sun/rewriter/util/.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would still believe that this could be achieved by doing some <br/>\nmodifications to DirectorySuiteBuilder, but i would be glad it this <br/>\nfeature gets into JUNIT-Add-ons as this could do away Suite class which <br/>\nare needed (as good practice) for every package.<br/>\n<br/>\nVladimir R. Bossicard could please help..I have also attached code which <br/>\nwas written using you API in JUNIT-Add-ons, could please see what i am <br/>\nmissing...<br/>\n<br/>\nThanking you in advance..<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards,<br/>\nNagendra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
