B. Rainsberger&quot; &lt;jbrains762@...&gt;\r\n\r\n&gt;Presumably if I tested the assumptions correctly in both cases, then I\n&gt;wouldn&#39;t have to test my code in both of its configurations (since\n&gt;from its point of view it&#39;s not really doing anything different in the\n&gt;two different cases).\n[...]\n\nYou have to assume that third-party software works when you integrate with \nit. You have to assume that Java works. You have to assume that anyone you \ndidn&#39;t write yourself works, otherwise you&#39;re testing someone else&#39;s code, \nand that is testing you shouldn&#39;t have to do.\n\nBut their stuff has bugs. I posted an example of a bug in IBM&#39;s EJB \nimplementation on Wiki. They have an Enumeration that isn&#39;t really an \nEnumeration. I only found this out during unit tests. It happens.\n\nSo what can you do?\n\nFortunately, XP has a solution: quick releases and acceptance tests force \nyou to integrate early and often so that you can expose these bugs in \nthird-party software earlier. The good news is that, through unit testing, \nyou can find these third-party bugs more easily. I would not be the least \nbit surprised if I were the first person ever to find this bug in IBM&#39;s EJB \nimplementation. After all, who would bother calling &quot;nextElement()&quot; when \n&quot;hasMoreElements()&quot; returns false? My acceptance test did, because I wanted \nto avoid subtle bugs, so I looked under every rock.\n\nBut at least I found the bug early in my integration with the library, \nreported it, and perhaps they&#39;ll fix it. What acceptance testing did was \nmake the bug show up now, rather than six months from now at an Australian \ncustomer&#39;s site. That would be a hefty travel bill.\n\nSo for unit testing, you have to assume that libraries work, otherwise you \ncan&#39;t truly unit test. But make sure you have the appropriate \nintegration/acceptance tests; otherwise, you&#39;ll not find bugs in those \nlibraries soon enough.\n\nJBR.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp\n\n\n",
