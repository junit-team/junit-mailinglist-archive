E.G. I have a few Fortun=\r\ne Cookies that are stored in an \narray of \n&gt; &gt; Strings. I&#39;ve written some c=\r\node that returns them randomly. \n&gt; &gt; What is the best method for testing? i=\r\n.e. should I be using Mocks?\n&gt; &gt; If anybody has any good examples or releva=\r\nnt web sites please let \nme \n&gt; &gt; know.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sam,\n&gt; \n&gt; When faced with a que=\r\nstion like this, I always ask, &quot;What are you \ntrying \n&gt; to test?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Are =\r\nyou trying to test your randomness algorithm or trying to test \nthat \n&gt; you=\r\n can return a fortune given an index and that index happens to \nbe random.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; My best advice is to split the problem in half. Don&#39;t try to test \n&gt; r=\r\neturning a random fortune. Test that, given a sequence of \nfortunes, you \n&gt;=\r\n can return the next one when asked. In your test system, you can \nset up \n=\r\n&gt; a known sequence of fortunes, and in your real system, you can set \nup a =\r\n\n&gt; random sequence. Hide the sequence generation behind an interface \nand \n=\r\n&gt; you can mock it for tests, and use real randomness in production.\n&gt; \n&gt; I =\r\nhope this makes sense :) If not, ask away again.\n&gt; \n&gt; bab\n\nThanks Brian,\n\nI=\r\n&#39;ve posted a response to all which explains what I&#39;m trying to do \nmore cle=\r\narly. \nYour response does make sense however. I&#39;ll have a think about it an=\r\nd \ntry to come up with the best way of implementing a solution. \n\nCheers,\n\n=\r\nSam.\n\n\n",
