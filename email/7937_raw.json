(Page 153)\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. The first two solutions I understand. But how can mock objects \n&gt; ease or bypass the problem of testing private methods?\n\nMock objects enable you to test a unit from the inside. This can make the\nneed to test private features vanish. Testing private features makes a test\nmore fragile, but so does the use of mock objects.\n\n&gt; 2. I understand this to this point. But then he writes that the \n&gt; counting of branches is impossible if dynamic class loading is \n&gt; allowed. Why is it impossible then?\n\nBecause you don&#39;t know all implementors of a polymorphic method at compile\ntime. There can be any number of implementations unknown to the original\ndeveloper of the client class.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Another thing I don&#39;t understand is the a solution to the problem \n&gt; with the Square class which extends the Rectangle class.\n&gt; \n&gt; The problem arises if a method &quot;stretchX(int factor)&quot; is added to \n&gt; the Rectangle class. Then you can override it in the Square class \n&gt; (so that Y is stretched too with the factor). But then a Square \n&gt; instance cannot be used everywhere where a Rectangle instance is can \n&gt; be used.\n\nRight. This violates the LSP and thereby destroys the well-fromedness of the\nclass hierarchy.\n\n&gt; He has three solution for this: reversing the extends relationship, \n&gt; extracting a common super class and introducing a value semantics \n&gt; (&quot;Wertesemantik&quot;).\n&gt; \n&gt; 3. How does a solution look like with value semantics? I&#39;m not sure \n&gt; if I translated the word correctly.\n\n&quot;Value semantics&quot; in this context means that any method which is supposed to\nchange the state of the object, eg. stretch the side of a rectangle, does\nnot change the original object but returns a new object which has a different\ninternal state than the original object. Transforming an object with changing\nstate into a value object (which is *identified* by its internal state) often\nrequires you to change method names. And sometimes it just does not make\nsense.\n\nJohannes\n\n-- \n+++ GMX - Mail, Messaging & more  http://www.gmx.net +++\nBitte l�cheln! Fotogalerie online mit GMX ohne eigene Homepage!\n\n\n",
