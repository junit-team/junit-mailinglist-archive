Large systems are just larger collections of objects, so not much <br/>\nis different.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for compilers, your message seems to claim that building a compiler <br/>\nincrementally is not possible, or perhaps just not feasible. The way to <br/>\nbuild a compiler incrementally -- assuming you do not use any existing <br/>\ntools like parser generators -- is to pick one language feature and <br/>\nsupport it, then another, then another until you support the entire <br/>\nlanguage.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother approach is to start by implementing an interpreter, work to <br/>\nsupport the entire language, then use the interpreter as a test <br/>\nenvironment to write the corresponding compiler. That&#39;s just an idea <br/>\nthat comes off the top of my head and I have no idea whether it&#39;s feasible.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour question, it seems to me, is about incremental development and not <br/>\nTDD and not JUnit. Is that accurate? I only mention that because it&#39;s <br/>\neasier to answer a question once I understand the question.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
