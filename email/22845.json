We use TeamCity to run the tests, which does a great job of informing developers and non-developers alike, at it is very easy to trigger a build, and it will support pre-commit test running, but your DBAs would have to use eclipse to relate to their source control system (IDEA, or Visual Studio).<br/>\n<br/>\nFor it to work, of course, you have to update some test database. For that, I recommend dbDeploy. You can put that together into the build to modify a defined database that is made for these pre-test commits.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd although it doesn&#39;t seem you need it, we use DBUnit to set the database into a known state before the tests run.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;binarymonk01&quot; &lt;binarymonk01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hey all,<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m having a hard time searching for the right terms to describe what I am looking for, so posting a question here --<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Environment:<br/>\n&gt; Java 5/6, mixed windows/linux environment (for use-case, assume all Windows desktops), Eclipse IDE for java developers, mix of junit 3.8/4.0 tests, and a LOT of already existing junit tests that include regression/database testing.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Scenario:<br/>\n&gt; Junit tests already exist and do integration testing to the database backend, including direct SQL queries, hibernate/JPA queries, and stored procedure calls (MS SQL).  People who are non-java/non-junit are going to make changes to the database and stored procedures (for many different projects).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Question:<br/>\n&gt; Is there an easy way for a non-java/non-junit person to, basically, one-click run unit tests to see if changes they made will cause issues to the existing regression/unit tests?  The ease-of-access and results is the key/critical part, as otherwise they will just keep asking development staff to run them and ask for feedback.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks for any tips/ideas/tooling!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -dhartford<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
