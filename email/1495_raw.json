Thanks.\n\n    &gt; -----Original Message-----\n    &gt; From: Mathieu Gervais [mailto:egoine_@...]\n    &gt; Sent: Monday, June 11, 2001 9:22 AM\n    &gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n    &gt; Subject: Re: [junit] Why bother?\n    &gt; \n    &gt; \n    &gt; &gt;To further David&#39;s point... my experience is that most \n    &gt; main()&#39;s test for\n    &gt; best-case scenarios.  They don&#39;t fully test the class.\n    &gt; \n    &gt; But they could. Junit does not ensure all scenarios are \n    &gt; covered, and tests\n    &gt; written in main methods can be better than tests written \n    &gt; with Junit.\n    &gt; The original poster wanted to know how to convince people \n    &gt; to use junit, but\n    &gt; those people seem to :\n    &gt; 1)already write unit tests\n    &gt; 2) &quot;get it&quot;\n    &gt; \n    &gt; So, my opinion is that your use the junit framework to:\n    &gt; \n    &gt; A-have a standard way of writing and *running* tests. If \n    &gt; each developer has\n    &gt; it&#39;s own little main class, how does one know how to \n    &gt; invoke it, where it is,\n    &gt; how to check for ouput. Of course, they can all be \n    &gt; written the same way,\n    &gt; stored at the same place, and all return a exit code to indicate\n    &gt; success/failure let&#39;s say. But why bother to establish \n    &gt; such standards when\n    &gt; using junit gives you all that by default (there is test \n    &gt; collectors written\n    &gt; for junit).  With junit, I feel it&#39;s easier for someone \n    &gt; to say : &quot;I want to\n    &gt; run all the unit tests of our project before checking-in&quot; \n    &gt; like XP mandates.\n    &gt; Thus, your coworkers gain the ability to easily run the \n    &gt; tests of the other\n    &gt; workers.\n    &gt; \n    &gt; B-It helps automating the process, towards a true \n    &gt; &quot;continuous integration&quot;.\n    &gt; Ant has already defined tasks for Junit.\n    &gt; \n    &gt; C-Some stuff often used when testing is in the junit \n    &gt; framework. It saves you\n    &gt; time to not have to write your own assert, etc..\n    &gt; \n    &gt; D-Extension packages : we are starting to see a lot of \n    &gt; extensions to junit,\n    &gt; integration with IDE, etc. These are nice to have and \n    &gt; altought they\n    &gt; certainly could be used without junit, it&#39;s even simpler with it.\n    &gt; \n    &gt; E-Gaining some experience with a tool that is more and \n    &gt; more becoming the\n    &gt; standard for writing unit test in java is a good \n    &gt; opportunity. Your coworkers\n    &gt; should at least try it.\n    &gt; \n    &gt; But why do YOU want them to use junit? What is your gain?\n    &gt; \n    &gt; If they already have a nice working setup, maybe there is \n    &gt; not point in\n    &gt; switching...\n    &gt; \n    &gt; mathieu\n    &gt; \n    &gt; ----- Original Message -----\n    &gt; From: Jason Rogers\n    &gt; To: &#39;junit@yahoogroups.com&#39;\n    &gt; Sent: Monday, June 11, 2001 8:58 AM\n    &gt; Subject: RE: [junit] Why bother?\n    &gt; \n    &gt; \n    &gt; \n    &gt;     &gt; 2) My experience is that most people will write a main\n    &gt;     &gt; that does NOT\n    &gt;     &gt; automatically say, &quot;yes, I passed all my tests&quot;.
