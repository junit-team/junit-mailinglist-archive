When you mentioned the suite thing, it seemed intuitive. I&#39;d say keep it as it. It certainly makes sense in both situations and it&#39;s clear.<br/>\n <br/>\nAs for @BeforeSuite/@AfterSuite being more intuitive, I don&#39;t agree. It&#39;s more to remember.<br/>\n <br/>\nIf a class has a suite method, @BeforeClass happens before that, right? If a class just has a bunch of @Test, then it runs before all of them. What is not intuitive about that?<br/>\n <br/>\nAnd if you have both, then what would happen if you had both @BeforeClass and @BeforeSuite? I guess @BeforeSuite would happen before @BeforeClass? But that doesn&#39;t seem to make sense since Class is a bigger &quot;container&quot; of stuff than &quot;suite&quot; so now we get unexpected or hard to justify results.<br/>\n <br/>\nNo, I think one set of annotations is wholly adequate, intuitive and simple.<br/>\n <br/>\nBrett<br/>\n <br/>\nTutorials and Articles<br/>\n     <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://schuchert.wikispaces.com/\">http://schuchert.wikispaces.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n----- Original Message ----<br/>\nFrom: David Saff &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:saff@...\">saff@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Friday, August 11, 2006 1:25:21 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [junit] JUnit 4 with bea 9.2 workshop<br/>\n<br/>\nCédric Beust ♔ wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; On 8/11/06, David Saff &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:saff@...\">saff@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; There are indeed several ways to achieve this with JUnit, but why not simply<br/>\n&gt; add @BeforeSuite and @AfterSuite?

For me, @BeforeClass and @AfterClass <br/>\nalready mean &quot;before everything coming from _this_ class&quot;, and &quot;after <br/>\neverything coming from _this_ class&quot;, whether that&#39;s all the methods on <br/>\na test class, or all the classes referenced from a Suite class. This <br/>\nmeans that @BeforeClass has a consistent meaning on both suite classes <br/>\nand test classes. If suite classes have BeforeSuite, and test classes <br/>\nhave BeforeClass, then what does BeforeClass mean on a suite class? What <br/>\ndoes BeforeSuite mean on a test class? It seems that fewer concepts is <br/>\nbetter.<br/>\n<br/>\nThoughts from frequent JUnit users?<br/>\n<br/>\nDavid<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
