This would make end-to-end  \n&gt; tests\n&gt; &gt; all the less valuable.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ve found the opposite. Many times I&#39;ve seen teams do &quot;TDD&quot; but only\n&gt; write unit tests. They had integration problems that were only\n&gt; brought under control when they started writing end-to-end tests.\n&gt;\nDid those teams reach the point where end-to-end tests took more than  \novernight to run? When that happens, I see teams starting to cherry- \npick their end-to-end tests, writing only the easy ones that are  \nlikely already to pass, and that&#39;s the point at which integration  \ndefects leak in by the ton.\n----\nJ.
