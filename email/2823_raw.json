If this happens the way it says in the\ndocumentation, &quot;assert&quot; will become a reserved keyword in the Java language.\nHere is the Sun page detailing the new assertion facility:\nhttp://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/docs/guide/lang/assert.html\nNote that it seems this is already in the beta of JDK 1.4.  \n\nThe document also details ways of turning off assertions, including the fact\nthat you must use a special setting at compile time in order\nfor assertions to work at all:\nhttp://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/docs/guide/lang/assert.html#compiling\n\nThe question is whether not using this compile-time setting frees up the\n&quot;assert&quot; keyword for use as a method name.  My fear is that it\ndoes not.  \n\nThis could definitely cramp our style, to put it mildly.  Anyone know any\nmore about this issue?\n\nThanks,\nNoah Green\n\n\n\nNoah Green\nSoftware Engineering Manager\nThinAirApps, Inc.\n(212) 343-5032\nnoah.green@...\n\nThis message and any appended documentation is intended only for the use of\nthe intended recipient(s) and is proprietary and confidential to\nThinAirApps, Inc. and may not be disclosed to third parties without the\nprior written permission of ThinAirApps, Inc.
