If it turns out to be the wron=\r\ng thing\nto do, I&#39;d have to break code to take it out. I always deprecate an=\r\nd leave\nit in for a good long while, but even that&#39;s ultimately a code brea=\r\nk, just a\nnicer way to do it.\n\nI did always have in mind I&#39;d like to suppor=\r\nt use cases of doing things in\nthe interpreter, but am not sure yet how peo=\r\nple actually use it. I tend to\nflesh out working code one bit at a time, wi=\r\nth little &quot;tests&quot; I guess you\ncould call them. But they aren&#39;t formal tests=\r\n. After I get it working I put\nit into the source and then write a more for=\r\nmal test for it.\n\nWhat I&#39;ll do initially is format the output of TDD traits=\r\n, enable color by\ndefault when using execute(), provide a way to turn color=\r\n off when using\nexecute(), and add a summary at the end. That I&#39;m sure abou=\r\nt.\n\nBill\n\nOn Sat, Mar 12, 2011 at 5:07 AM, Joakim Ohlrogge &lt;joakim.ohlrogge=\r\n@...\n&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; Hi Bill,\n&gt;\n&gt; Glad my poking around with this was so=\r\nmewhat inspiring. Technically I\n&gt; haven&#39;t done anything that can&#39;t already =\r\nbe done with ScalaTest and my hopes\n&gt; are that rather than spawning off a n=\r\new framework, the good ideas are\n&gt; adopted in other frameworks and the bad =\r\nones die with this one. Right now\n&gt; I&#39;m primarily interested in running tes=\r\nts and poking around in the results\n&gt; rather than easing the testwriting it=\r\nself. I&#39;m also curious where I can go\n&gt; with JUnit as a primary foundation,=\r\n basically conforming to rather than just\n&gt; interfacing with JUnit. Mostly =\r\nfor fun. I decided to make it all public in\n&gt; case it would be interesting =\r\nto anyone else and for reference when blogging\n&gt; etc.\n&gt; How I &quot;solved&quot; pend=\r\ning and pendingUntilFixed was to use an AssumptionFailed\n&gt; exception since =\r\nit is the closest thing to an ignored exception in JUnit.\n&gt; Since the exist=\r\ning runners don&#39;t treat the assumption-errors as ignored I\n&gt; simply output =\r\n&quot;pending &lt;reason&gt;&quot; messages on the console when being run. It\n&gt; would be be=\r\ntter to have the tests marked as ignored in eclipse but works as\n&gt; a workar=\r\nound.\n&gt; Quite early I got an idea about some primary goals when running fro=\r\nm the\n&gt; REPL and the most important one was:\n&gt;\n&gt; minimize typing - completi=\r\non is not always available in the REPL (from\n&gt; eclipse, intellij and to my =\r\nsurprise even emacs (though there must be some\n&gt; way to pass the tab along =\r\ndown to the repl?))\n&gt;\n&gt; Examples of where this has led me:\n&gt;  * Only one im=\r\nport\n&gt;  * short package name even if it violates javas recommendations\n&gt;  *=\r\n package object with shortcuts to common stuff and a few implicits\n&gt;\n&gt; I re=\r\nally wanted scala tests easy executing of tests from the REPL. The\n&gt; JUnitC=\r\nore approach is less elegant IMO and it seems like a System.exit in\n&gt; the t=\r\nhe cores main shuts down the REPL. That could be worked around of\n&gt; course =\r\nby instatiation JUnitCore and passing the classes to run. A problem\n&gt; here =\r\nfrom a scala perspective is that Java&#39;s way to get a Class instance\n&gt; &lt;Clas=\r\nsName&gt;.class rolls off my fingers a bit more naturally than scalas\n&gt; classO=\r\nf[ClassName] (habit I guess). Long story short, I much prefer\n&gt; scalatests =\r\nway and I think it&#39;s not strange that a language with a REPL\n&gt; inspires mor=\r\ne thought in this department. My solution here was dynamic\n&gt; mixins (or sta=\r\ntic if one prefers). So with a simple &quot;with Basics&quot; you can\n&gt; run any JUnit=\r\n compatible test from the REPL.\n&gt;\n&gt; Now came the issue with customizing the=\r\n output. I decided to put that\n&gt; outside the TestCase completely. It feels =\r\nlike a runtime decision. This is\n&gt; when &quot;run&quot; changed to really mean &quot;selec=\r\nt&quot; (but the method on interaction is\n&gt; still called run). Basically, the ru=\r\nn method just returns a list of\n&gt; Callable[Result]-instances and the BriefR=\r\neport calls the one by one and\n&gt; prints out the result. This way, the runni=\r\nng and the reporting is nicely\n&gt; separated and which testing style you choo=\r\nse has no bearing on the output\n&gt; you see. The brief method could be paired=\r\n with a verbose method if one\n&gt; wishes more verbose output.\n&gt;\n&gt; Now came th=\r\ne color/no color issue. Color feels like an aspect of reporting.\n&gt; This mig=\r\nht be a case of golden hammer but to represent this aspect as a\n&gt; stackable=\r\n trait felt quite nice. Especially when creating instances of a\n&gt; report: n=\r\new Brief with Color. One could easily imagine expanding in this\n&gt; direction=\r\n: new Brief with Color with Summary with SourceDump with\n&gt; StackTraceFilter=\r\ning with LongRunningTestTopList ExecutionTimeStatistics ...\n&gt;\n&gt; The only pr=\r\noblem (ok there are several probably by the obvious problem\n&gt; anyway) is ke=\r\neping the default as elegant as ScalaTest&#39;s spec.execute hence\n&gt; the packag=\r\ne object in the poju4s package that allows me to write brief(spec)\n&gt; instea=\r\nd.\n&gt;\n&gt; If I want to run just a few tests that can be done like this (here I=\r\n assume\n&gt; I have already renamed the run-method to select):\n&gt; brief(spec.se=\r\nlect(&#39;example1, &#39;example2))\n&gt;\n&gt; The fun part comes when I add glob:\n&gt;\n&gt; bir=\r\nef(glob(&quot;package/*/*Spec&quot;)) or with an implicit:\n&gt; brief(&quot;package/*/*Spec&quot;)=\r\n.\n&gt;\n&gt; I agree that named parameters also makes sense, or a combination:\n&gt; s=\r\npec.execute(color=3DFunkyScheme, options=3DList[StackTraceFiltering,\n&gt; Sour=\r\nceDump, ExecutionTimeStatistics])\n&gt;\n&gt; I also tought about some sort of para=\r\nmeter dsl:\n&gt;\n&gt; spec.select(&#39;example1, &#39;example2) &gt;&gt;: StackTraceFiltering &gt;&gt;=\r\n: Color &gt;&gt;:\n&gt; SourceDump &gt;&gt;: StdOut\n&gt; (not sure that would work or that I w=\r\nould like it but... as long as we&#39;re\n&gt; tossing up ideas)\n&gt;\n&gt; As you say, wh=\r\nen something fails what one really wants to see is which\n&gt; tests failed. Th=\r\nat is a missing part from my output, just effectively\n&gt; managed to clear th=\r\nose pesky succeeding tests out of the way while still\n&gt; mantaining some fee=\r\ndback that they were actually run. I intend to address\n&gt; that as you sugges=\r\nted, list the failing pending and ignored tests in the\n&gt; summary. I also in=\r\ntend to let the run return some sort of Gist or Summary\n&gt; object that allow=\r\ns one to poke around a bit more in the result (after all it\n&gt; is a REPL so =\r\nwhy shouldn&#39;t one be able to interact with the result?).\n&gt; Examples of what=\r\n one could do &quot;post&quot;-running is to dump captured std-out,\n&gt; stacktraces, ex=\r\necutiontimes etc, list all the names of all tests of a given\n&gt; status or wh=\r\nat have you. I think the best is to leave the information sort\n&gt; of naked a=\r\nnd then scalas excellent collection API can do it&#39;s magic of\n&gt; filtering, g=\r\nrouping and mapping to the users desire. Why not conveniently\n&gt; allow rerun=\r\n just failed tests in this way?\n&gt;\n&gt; There is really no reason why these thi=\r\nngs need to be isolated to just\n&gt; JUnit, in fact it feels like my original =\r\nidea is much less interesting then\n&gt; to actually explore running and report=\r\ning from the REPL in general. For now\n&gt; it is convenient to focus on just o=\r\nne framework but perhaps in the future\n&gt; the good parts can be distilled in=\r\nto a more framework agnostic run/report\n&gt; framework or the most sensible th=\r\ning is to just leave the ideas out there\n&gt; with a liberal license so that t=\r\nhe ones that work can be adopted by\n&gt; framework-vendors as they please... I=\r\n&#39;m not sure what is best yet but the\n&gt; license is chosen to not be an issue=\r\n for this to happen :).\n&gt;\n&gt; Long story short: one import seems to be a good=\r\n idea, separating running\n&gt; and reporting seems to be a good idea, and ther=\r\ne seems to be some room for\n&gt; innovating when running tests from the REPL..=\r\n.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks for listening to my ramblings! It&#39;s so much fun to play with t=\r\nhese\n&gt; things without the worries of actually maintaining it for years and =\r\nyears :)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; -----------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Joak=\r\nim Ohlrogge\n&gt; Agical AB\n&gt; V=E4sterl=E5nggatan 79, 2 tr\n&gt; 111 29 Stockholm, =\r\nSWEDEN\n&gt;\n&gt; Mobile: +46-708-754004\n&gt; Blog: johlrogge.wordpress.com\n&gt; E-mail:=\r\n joakim.ohlrogge@...\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; On Sat, Mar 12, 2011 at 1:25 AM, Bill Venn=\r\ners &lt;bill@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Hi Joakim,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; On Fri, Mar 11, 2011 at =\r\n3:18 PM, Joakim Ohlrogge &lt;\n&gt;&gt; joakim.ohlrogge@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; If anything useful comes out of it it can be contributed for sure.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; =\r\nI&#39;ve chosen a quite liberal license (Beerware :)) in case someone else\n&gt;&gt;&gt; =\r\nfeels inspired to borrow/steal or contribute.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; I&#39;m a bit inspired. I=\r\n&#39;m sure you&#39;re aware that there&#39;s a lot of stuff in\n&gt;&gt; ScalaTest to make wr=\r\niting JUnit tests in Scala more productive. And perhaps\n&gt;&gt; you&#39;re aware you=\r\n can run ScalaTest tests in the Scala interpreter by\n&gt;&gt; invoking execute on=\r\n them. So for example given this test:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; import org.scalatest.junit.JUn=\r\nitSuite\n&gt;&gt; import scala.collection.mutable.ListBuffer\n&gt;&gt; import _root_.org.=\r\njunit.Test\n&gt;&gt; import _root_.org.junit.Before\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; class HowSuite extends J=\r\nUnitSuite {\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;   var sb: StringBuilder =3D _\n&gt;&gt;   var lb: ListBuffer[Str=\r\ning] =3D _\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;   @Before def initialize() {\n&gt;&gt;     sb =3D new StringBuild=\r\ner(&quot;ScalaTest is &quot;)\n&gt;&gt;     lb =3D new ListBuffer[String]\n&gt;&gt;   }\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;   @Te=\r\nst def verifyEasy() {\n&gt;&gt;     sb.append(&quot;easy!&quot;)\n&gt;&gt;     assert(sb.toString =\r\n=3D=3D=3D &quot;ScalaTest is easy!&quot;)\n&gt;&gt;     assert(lb.isEmpty)\n&gt;&gt;     lb +=3D &quot;s=\r\nweet&quot;\n&gt;&gt;   }\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;   @Test def verifyFun() {\n&gt;&gt;     sb.append(&quot;fun!&quot;)\n&gt;&gt;   =\r\n  assert(sb.toString =3D=3D=3D &quot;ScalaTest is fun!&quot;)\n&gt;&gt;     assert(lb.isEmpt=\r\ny)\n&gt;&gt;   }\n&gt;&gt; }\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; You could run it in the interpreter like this (both Sc=\r\nalaTest and JUnit\n&gt;&gt; need to be on the classpath):\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; user-64-9-237-191:=\r\nscalatest-1.3 bv$ scala -cp\n&gt;&gt; scalatest-1.3.jar:junit-4.4.jar\n&gt;&gt; Welcome t=\r\no Scala version 2.8.0.final (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM,\n&gt;&gt; Java 1.6=\r\n.0_22).\n&gt;&gt; Type in expressions to have them evaluated.\n&gt;&gt; Type :help for mo=\r\nre information.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; scala&gt; :load HowSuite.scala\n&gt;&gt; Loading HowSuite.scala=\r\n...\n&gt;&gt; import org.scalatest.junit.JUnitSuite\n&gt;&gt; import scala.collection.mut=\r\nable.ListBuffer\n&gt;&gt; import _root_.org.junit.Test\n&gt;&gt; import _root_.org.junit.=\r\nBefore\n&gt;&gt; defined class HowSuite\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; scala&gt; (new HowSuite).execute()\n&gt;&gt; T=\r\nest Starting - line5$object$$iw$$iw$HowSuite: verifyEasy\n&gt;&gt; Test Succeeded =\r\n- line5$object$$iw$$iw$HowSuite: verifyEasy\n&gt;&gt; Test Starting - line5$object=\r\n$$iw$$iw$HowSuite: verifyFun\n&gt;&gt; Test Succeeded - line5$object$$iw$$iw$HowSu=\r\nite: verifyFun\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Just create a new instance and call execute on it and =\r\nit will run. (This\n&gt;&gt; is a JUnit 4 test class, so JUnit can run it jut fine=\r\n. In this case you&#39;re\n&gt;&gt; asking ScalaTest to run it, though what ScalaTest =\r\ndoes is turn around and\n&gt;&gt; ask JUnit to run it, capturing and displaying th=\r\ne results.) If you want to\n&gt;&gt; run just one of those tests you can specify i=\r\nt by name:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; scala&gt; (new HowSuite).execute(&quot;verifyFun&quot;)\n&gt;&gt; Test Startin=\r\ng - line5$object$$iw$$iw$HowSuite: verifyFun\n&gt;&gt; Test Succeeded - line5$obje=\r\nct$$iw$$iw$HowSuite: verifyFun\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; And you can pass in config map of conf=\r\niguration information to execute if\n&gt;&gt; you want.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; It works, but it is =\r\nugly. The output has two problems. One is that because\n&gt;&gt; I loaded the clas=\r\ns with :load into the interpreter, instead of compiling it,\n&gt;&gt; I get very l=\r\nong names for the class name with lots of dollar signs. So one\n&gt;&gt; enhanceme=\r\nnt would be to drop everything to the left of the first dollar\n&gt;&gt; sign. I&#39;m=\r\n pretty sure I&#39;m doing that somewhere else in ScalaTest, so I could\n&gt;&gt; do i=\r\nt here.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The other annoyance is you get info on both TestStarting and\n=\r\n&gt;&gt; TestSucceeded, two lines of info for each test. What I originally did wa=\r\ns\n&gt;&gt; only format the output of BDD style test traits, because BDD was in pa=\r\nrt\n&gt;&gt; about output that looks like a spec, and TDD was not. But I&#39;ve gotten=\r\n clear\n&gt;&gt; feedback that people using the non-BDD traits would like pretty o=\r\nutput too,\n&gt;&gt; so I&#39;ve already decided to change that. So it should soon loo=\r\nk something\n&gt;&gt; like:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; scala&gt; (new HowSuite).execute()\n&gt;&gt; HowSuite\n&gt;&gt; -=\r\n verifyEasy\n&gt;&gt; - verifyFun\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Another thing I did originally was not sho=\r\nw color when you use execute(),\n&gt;&gt; because I wasn&#39;t sure how to let people =\r\nturn color off, and I felt it was\n&gt;&gt; worse to force color on people whose t=\r\nerminals didn&#39;t support it than the\n&gt;&gt; other way around. But people really =\r\nlike color. It is pretty and makes it\n&gt;&gt; more readable. So what I&#39;d like to=\r\n do is figure out some way to let people\n&gt;&gt; configure color, full stack tra=\r\nces, and durations when using execute. Now\n&gt;&gt; that Scala has default params=\r\n, that&#39;s probably the right way to do it. So\n&gt;&gt; color would be the default,=\r\n and to turn it off you&#39;d say:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; scala&gt; (new HowSuite).execute(color =\r\n=3D false)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; And lastly, your dots idea is interesting. Whenever I run =\r\nwith a standard\n&gt;&gt; out reporter, I get lots and lots and lots of green test=\r\n names that passed.\n&gt;&gt; And what I really care about is the ones that failed=\r\n. So I think it may make\n&gt;&gt; sense to add one more option to the standard ou=\r\nt/err and file reporters that\n&gt;&gt; just shows one dot for each passed test. A=\r\nnd then that could possibly be the\n&gt;&gt; default for execute, maybe.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; And=\r\n lastly lastly, maybe execute should show a summary line at the end,\n&gt;&gt; lik=\r\ne the runner does.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; As far as getting JUnit to do something like pendi=\r\nng and\n&gt;&gt; pendingUntilFixed, that will be tough until JUnit can treat some =\r\nkind of\n&gt;&gt; exception specially. Be nice to have a TestIgnoredException that=\r\n gets\n&gt;&gt; reported as an ignored test in JUnit someday.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Bill\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;  L=\r\nets see where it goes.

If you&#39;d like\n&gt;&gt;&gt; to\n&gt;&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; contribute any of it to a future junit.contrib project, let us know.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;   David Saff\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; On Fri, Mar 11, 2011 at 1:54 PM, Joakim Oh=\r\nlrogge &lt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; joakim.ohlrogge@...\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Thanks f=\r\nor the update (and the welcome back).\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Yes, it seems like ther=\r\ne is a bit of a problem that eclipse has gone a\n&gt;&gt;&gt; bit\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; stale.
