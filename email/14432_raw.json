However, there *seems* to be an assumption in this thread\n&gt; &gt; that multilpe asserts per test are somehow related to each other, such\n&gt; &gt; that if one fails and I fix it then the other possibly failing asserts\n&gt; &gt; would be fixed at the same time.  That is not always, and perhaps\n&gt; &gt; generally, not the case.\n&gt;\n&gt; I believe it is, if the test is focused on a small bit of functionality.\n\nIt is focused on a small bit of functionality and the asserts are not \nrelated to each other.  The functionality is the application of a \nCreditMemo to an existing sale, for which there may or may not be \nrelated sales (eg. a purchased recurring sale, a recurring sale in \nnegotiation, one or more &quot;upsales&quot;, etc.).\n\n&gt; Is it necessary (or even desirable) to test both these things in the same\n&gt; test?  Could you perhaps do one test to show applying the CreditMemo to a\n&gt; Sale does the right thing, and a second to show applying it to a\n&gt; RecurringSale is correct?  If these two actions happen in different \n&gt; classes,\n&gt; why would you need to test them at the same time?\n\nBut, that was the point.  Applying it to the sale has a cascade effect \non its related sales.  You could do a separate test for each thing but I \ntend to hate the duplication even more!  In the contrived example (based \non reality) there should be no need to directly apply the CreditMemo for \nan originatingSale to one of its related sales.  It happens behind the \nscenes.  The test is testing that the direct effect on the originating \nsale takes place as well as the behind-the-scenes effect on its related \nsales.\n\nMind you, also, that I am not truly advocating multiple failures per \ntest... I am playing &quot;devil&#39;s advocate&quot; in order to shine some light on \nwhat seems to be forgotten territory.\n\n-- \nJason Rogers\n\n&quot;I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I,\nbut Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in \nthe flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved \nme, and gave himself for me.&quot;\n    Galatians 2:20\n\n\n",
