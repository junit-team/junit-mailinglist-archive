I read the paper you\n&gt; advised & drew some conclusion on my app design.Could you tell me if\n&gt; I&#39;m right or not ? Problem statement :  The Data class allows to\n&gt; access Data in a formatted file (similar to DBF).  Change request is\n&gt; to enable multiclient simultaneous access. Solution 1 :  Singelton is\n&gt; right but throws too much code dependencies in the system which  as a\n&gt; direct consequence of making unit testing rather painfull when there\n&gt; is  some (more) change requests.   singelton has something fundamently\n&gt; wrong :    class do not need to know how they are used.    Access to\n&gt; single instance should be made via a ToolBox returning    instances of\n&gt; the class as requested. Solution 2 :    Client code should be told to\n&gt; access the class via an external Factory.    Problem is not yet\n&gt; perfectly solved. I cannot formalize yet the next step in the logic,\n&gt; but I more or less consider it as making a move from a Factory to a\n&gt; method factory. I probably need a few more days to grasp the internals\n&gt; of that. I also wonder why the code talks straight to the instance\n&gt; rather that to interfaces.Though slightly slower, that would be to me\n&gt; the ultimate abstraction in the system more than the method\n&gt; factory. Do you agree with that ?\n\nHi Thomas,\n\nSorry, I think I missed the question in all of that.  Did J.B.&#39;s recent\npost help answer this?
