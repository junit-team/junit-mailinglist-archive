Actually, i have been reviewed some of the<br/>\ncode my team wrote. Since no one really thought about testability, it<br/>\nis very difficult to ADD testing code unless we can do big<br/>\nrefactorying, which is impossible for our case. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;  One best use of JUNIT I have found is that the major test can be<br/>\nrun during the start-up of the application, which is a nice feature,<br/>\nand it reduces lot of surprises.<br/>\n&gt;  Well, this is all I am say about JUNIT, in my view, I think JUNIT<br/>\ndefinitly has long term benefits.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n[Frank] This is a point I&#39;ve never thought of. Thanks for sharing. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers, <br/>\n- Frank </span></blockquote></div>",
