I am, however, using\n&gt; documentation asserts (in t=\r\nhe comments) that actually shows up in the\n&gt; JUnit report in Eclipse, so I =\r\nget pretty good feedback. One way of\n&gt; putting it is that I&#39;m test-driving =\r\nthe documentation while I&#39;m\n&gt; documentation-driving the tests... :-)\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;=\r\nm still not sure exactly the best place to use Bumblebee (or\n&gt; Protest), bu=\r\nt I know that for API-documentation it will definitely be\n&gt; a good thing.\n&gt;=\r\n With TDDoc I experimented with Abbot tests (&quot;GUI-clicking&quot;) where I\n&gt; comp=\r\nlemented the comments with images by pulling bitmaps from the\n&gt; Swing frame=\r\ns, and then generating JavaHelp files (using docbook), and\n&gt; it actually wo=\r\nrked (with a few minor flaws). It should be possible to\n&gt; do the same thing=\r\n with Bumblebee. I don&#39;t want to start a new thread\n&gt; on whether GUI-clicki=\r\nng is a good way to test your application (I\n&gt; generally think it is not), =\r\nbut with automatically generated JavaHelp\n&gt; in the equation the balance mig=\r\nht change a bit for some people.\n&gt;\n&gt; Cheers\n&gt; Daniel, still wanting more fe=\r\nedback\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; On Nov 12, 2007 10:18 PM, Nat Pryce &lt;nat.pryce@...&gt; wr=\r\note:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Very interesting! I like the idea of gener=\r\nating useful documentation from\n&gt; &gt;  test code. I wrote a tool & test frame=\r\nwork with similar goals for Python\n&gt; &gt;  called Protest (http://xspecs.sf.ne=\r\nt/protest.html).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  One interesting effect I found when using Protest=\r\n is that the generated\n&gt; &gt;  documentation was enough of a different perspec=\r\ntive on the test code that\n&gt; &gt;  just skim-reading it gave really fast feedb=\r\nack on whether the tests acted\n&gt; &gt; as\n&gt; &gt;  a clear description of the teste=\r\nd code&#39;s behaviour.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  --Nat\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  On 11/11/2007, Daniel B=\r\nrolund &lt;daniel.brolund@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; Hi all,\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; I wou=\r\nld really appreciate some feedback on a small framework I&#39;m\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; writing =\r\nfor JUnit 4.4.\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; I call it Bumblebee, and the purpose of it is =\r\nto use comments and the\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; structures in the test-suites/cases/methods =\r\nto create &quot;human-readable&quot;\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; documentation. It is especially well suit=\r\ned for writing snippet-heavy\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; documentation.\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; In short, =\r\nBumblebee gets events from the execution of the tests\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; (suites/classe=\r\ns/methods) and then parses the classes and methods for\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; specific comm=\r\nents to include.\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; By default it adds the de-camelcased names o=\r\nf the suites/cases/methods\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; as headings (a la agile dox), and the con=\r\ntained comments becomes the\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; paragraphs.\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; The comments a=\r\nre actually handled as Ruby-strings that get executed in\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; a Bumblebee=\r\n execution context before being added to the output. The\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; execution c=\r\nontext is\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; a kind of DSL for including code-snippets and other things=\r\n needed, and\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; one of the core ideas of Bumblebee is that you should b=\r\ne able to\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; extend that functionality easily.\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; More detai=\r\nled information about Bumblebee can be found at:\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; http://www.a=\r\ngical.com/bumblebee/bumblebee_doc.html\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; which is of course gen=\r\nerated with Bumblebee. :-)\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; The concept of Bumblebee is the sa=\r\nme as for TDDoc, which me and Joakim\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; Ohlrogge wrote some time ago as=\r\n an add-on for RMock. Unfortunately,\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; TDDoc became a bit of a dead-en=\r\nd technically, and Joakim and I thought\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; it would be a good idea to s=\r\ntart fresh. I happened to have the time at\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; the time and I started it=\r\n up. So, if you like Bumblebee, give half of\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; your credits to Joakim!=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; This is an early release, and I will be very happy for any f=\r\needback I\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; can get to improve it.\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; Cheers\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; Daniel =\r\nBrolund\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; __________________________\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; Daniel Brolund\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; Agical AB\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; V=E4sterl=E5nggatan 79, 2 tr\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; 111 29 Stock=\r\nholm, SWEDEN\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; web: www.agical.com\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; mob: +46-708-754002\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;  &gt; mail: daniel.brolund@... &lt;daniel.brolund%40agical.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; =\r\nblog: danielbrolund.wordpress.com\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; priv: daniel.brolund@... &lt;da=\r\nniel.brolund%40gmail.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  [Non-text portions of this=\r\n message have been removed]\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt; __________________________=\r\n\n&gt; Daniel.Brolund@...\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
