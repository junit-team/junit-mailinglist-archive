The class design\nsimply hasn&#39;t calmed down enough to move the classes out of &quot;internal&quot;\nand start making iron-clad promises to future extenders.\n\nThat said, if you&#39;re willing to be flexible, it&#39;s not that bad--the\nfinal published interface is likely to be very similar to what&#39;s in\nJUnit 4.4.  You want to extend JUnit4ClassRunner, and probably\noverride:\n\n- getTestMethods: to pick up @Integration methods as well as @Test methods\n- validate: so that a class with only @Integration methods doesn&#39;t get\nmarked as malformed\n- wrapMethod: to change method running behavior.\n\nIn wrapMethod, you&#39;ll want to conditionally return a subclass of\nTestMethod, with your behavior inserted.  It may be sufficient to\noverride TestMethod.isIgnored, based on your description.\n\nTo bump the discussion up a level, the support for assumptions in\nJUnit 4.4 was supposed to handle situations very similar to what\nyou&#39;re describing:\n\n@Test public void integrationWorks() {\n   assumeTrue(runningIntegrationTests());\n   // rest of test\n}\n\nThis test will stop at the first line unless runningIntegrationTests\nreturns true.  If this facility doesn&#39;t handle your need, please let\nus know, so that we can improve it in future releases.  Thanks,\n\n   David\n\nOn 8/14/07, Scott Zou &lt;zou0s1@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt;\n&gt; All I want to do is this: I want to mark some of my test methods with my\n&gt; own annotation (e.g. @integration) instead of @test.  Then when this test\n&gt; case runs, these methods will check something like an environment\n&gt; variable to determine whether it should run (like @test) or do nothing (like\n&gt; @ignore).\n&gt;\n&gt; I figure I have to derive my own test runners to do this (@runWith\n&gt; (myTest.class)).  However, since JUnit4ClassRunner is internal and it&#39;s\n&gt; not documented, where can I find instructions/documents on what and how\n&gt; to derive from it?  Or is there a better way to achieve what we need here?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks!\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo! Groups Links\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n",
