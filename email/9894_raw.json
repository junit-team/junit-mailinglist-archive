So, to spell this out for my benefit,\n\nThe value of refactoring is as my method has been simplified from its\nearlier form - there will be two test cases (exception handling aside) for\nbigMethod(). One for condition == true and one for condition == false. The\nsetup for the mock objects I need to execute someCode(),\ntruePart()/falsePart() and moreCode() is also simplified as all I care about\nis the fact that these methods will be called as expected (what they\nactually do will be covered by other test cases).\n\nTime to go put this into practice....\n\nRgds,\nKevin.\n  -----Original Message-----\n  From: Mikhail Shnayderman [mailto:mschnayd@...]\n  Sent: Friday, November 14, 2003 16:54\n  To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n  Subject: RE: [junit] how many tests on a method - all possible scenarios\nor just enough?\n\n\n\n  I think that you surely will.\n  Since the logic of the Big method is reasonably\n  involved, in order to be sure that the behaviour\n  of the method is appropriate you have to exzcersice\n  various poath&#39;s through the method.\n\n  Just imagine that someone other than you maintains\n  bigMethod and for some unknown reason reverses the\n  meaning of the codition or rewrites the method as\n\n  &gt; bigMethod:\n  &gt;      someCode\n  &gt;      if (!condition)\n  &gt;          truePart\n  &gt;      else\n  &gt;          falsePart\n  &gt;      end\n  &gt;      moreCode\n  &gt; end\n\n  - Mikhail\n\n  --- Kevin O&#39;Sullivan &lt;kosullivan@...&gt; wrote:\n  &gt; bigMethod:\n  &gt;      someCode\n  &gt;      if (condition)\n  &gt;          truePart\n  &gt;      else\n  &gt;          falsePart\n  &gt;      end\n  &gt;      moreCode\n  &gt; end\n  &gt;\n  &gt; OK - so I have test cases for my new methods\n  &gt; someCode(), truePart(),\n  &gt; falsePart() and moreCode(). Seeing as bigMethod()\n  &gt; does nothing else apart\n  &gt; from call these methods I would not need to have\n  &gt; test cases for it -\n  &gt; correct?\n  &gt;\n  &gt; -----Original Message-----\n  &gt; From: J. B. Rainsberger [mailto:jbrains@...]\n  &gt; Sent: Friday, November 14, 2003 13:45\n  &gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n  &gt; Subject: Re: [junit] how many tests on a method -\n  &gt; all possible scenarios or\n  &gt; just enough?\n  &gt;\n  &gt;\n  &gt; Kevin O&#39;Sullivan wrote:\n  &gt;\n  &gt; &gt;  &gt; To me, one of the benefits of tests is that\n  &gt; they help me to spot design\n  &gt; &gt;  &gt; problems early. Whenever I find it difficult to\n  &gt; write a test for a\n  &gt; &gt; method,\n  &gt; &gt; I\n  &gt; &gt;  &gt; ask myself whether it&#39;s the method&#39;s fault.\n  &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt;     As a newbie to junit I&#39;m still trying to\n  &gt; understand how to judge if\n  &gt; when\n  &gt; &gt; its &#39;difficult&#39; to write a test for a method. My\n  &gt; question was sparked\n  &gt; &gt; because I was in what I would call a laborous\n  &gt; position - multiple code\n  &gt; paths\n  &gt; &gt; so multiple test cases. I had 30 test cases for\n  &gt; one method, amounting to\n  &gt; 300\n  &gt; &gt; lines of code. Is this tedious or difficult. In\n  &gt; JUnit world, does tedious\n  &gt; ==\n  &gt; &gt; difficult?\n  &gt;\n  &gt; I think &quot;tedious == difficult&quot; answers false, so\n  &gt; tedium is not as strong\n  &gt; a warning signal as difficulty; however it /is/ a\n  &gt; warning signal.\n  &gt;\n  &gt; If you want to learn how to make those judgments,\n  &gt; then I believe you\n  &gt; have to practice. Presumably your method is\n  &gt; structured like this.\n  &gt;\n  &gt; bigMethod:\n  &gt;      someCode\n  &gt;      if (condition)\n  &gt;          truePart\n  &gt;      else\n  &gt;          falsePart\n  &gt;      end\n  &gt;      moreCode\n  &gt; end\n  &gt;\n  &gt; In other words, let&#39;s say there&#39;s a top-level &quot;if&quot;\n  &gt; statement.\n  &gt;\n  &gt; So make bigMethod look exactly like the above.\n  &gt; Extract everything else\n  &gt; into methods. Now, can you test someCode, truePart,\n  &gt; falsePart and\n  &gt; moreCode on their own? If not, apply the same\n  &gt; refactoring again, and\n  &gt; again, and again... eventually you&#39;ll see how you\n  &gt; could fix the testing\n  &gt; tedium with refactoring.\n  &gt;\n  &gt; If your testing tedium is due to wanting to run the\n  &gt; same test with 100\n  &gt; different sets of data, you need better tests\n  &gt; (Parameterized Test Case).\n  &gt; If your testing tedium is due to high cyclomatic\n  &gt; complexity, you need\n  &gt; better production code (refactor, extract method,\n  &gt; move method, and so on).\n  &gt;\n  &gt; Take care.\n  &gt; --\n  &gt; J.
