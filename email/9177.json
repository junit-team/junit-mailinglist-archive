My experience with<br/>\napplying XP practices (particularly automatation and very agressive<br/>\nrefactoring) is that the grunt work tends to disappear. I&#39;ve seen<br/>\nsituations where you end up with a few smart guys doing all the work,<br/>\nand a few &quot;grunts&quot; sitting around that can&#39;t do anything, because they<br/>\ndon&#39;t have the technical sophistication to do anything but duplicate<br/>\ncode that&#39;s already in the system, making more work, not less, for the<br/>\nsenior folks.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my current project, we don&#39;t even have any dedicated QA people; the<br/>\nprogrammers themselves are responsible for doing all of the QA. We ended<br/>\nup with a very heavily automated solution, one we never could have had<br/>\nwithout QA staff who were programmers to the point that they could<br/>\nchange our software internals to make it more testable.<br/>\n<br/>\ncjs<br/>\n-- <br/>\nCurt Sampson  &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cjs@...\">cjs@...</a>&gt;   +81 90 7737 2974   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.NetBSD.org\">http://www.NetBSD.org</a><br/>\n    Don&#39;t you know, in this new Dark Age, we&#39;re all light.  --XTC</div>",
