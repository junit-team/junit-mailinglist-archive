There is no need to<br/>\nsay &quot;abstract&quot; twice in the class definition.  The class defines a concept (<br/>\ne.g. &quot;Thingy&quot;).  The class can be named after the concept only, because the<br/>\nJava language has a built-in feature for marking classes as abstract.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Nat<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 29/12/2007, jmdevins &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:josh@...\">josh@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Normally I like to test my abstract classes separately from any<br/>\n&gt; concrete implementations I might have. I might have something like this:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; public abstract AbstractThingy {<br/>\n&gt; // some concrete methods in here that need testing<br/>\n&gt; ...<br/>\n&gt; }<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Based on this, I would name my test class: AbstractThingyTest<br/>\n&gt; (although it&#39;s not abstract itself).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; When I run JUnit in Eclipse, everything is fine and dandy. Running it<br/>\n&gt; from within Maven however seems to make this test not run. So I tried<br/>\n&gt; renaming the test to simply: ThingyTest. When I run this, it does in<br/>\n&gt; fact run.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anyone else encountered something similar? I suspect it&#39;s a bug and it<br/>\n&gt; should be looking for the keyword &quot;abstract&quot; instead of any file or<br/>\n&gt; class with the word &quot;Abstract&quot; in it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thoughts?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Josh<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>",
