Seems to me like some IDE test runners particularly \nlike the Composite pattern -- so they can show the package tree of \nthe tests.\n\nCould the Composite structure be used to simplify the &quot;run one test&quot; \nscenario?  If each run is a suite with a collection of tests, then \nrunning them would be a depth-first visitation of the nodes:\n 1. Run the &quot;run once before all tests&quot; method of the suite.\n 2. Run all the tests of the suite.\n 3. Run the &quot;run once after all tests&quot; method.\nEach test would also have its &quot;before and after&quot; calls -- setUp and \ntearDown.  To run one test, navigate up to the root, then run \nevery &quot;start&quot; method.  Then run the test.  Then run every tearDown \nmethod, back up to the root.\n\n* Embrace Composite *\n\n;-&gt;\n\n\n\n",
