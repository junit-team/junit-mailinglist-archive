Using assert statements would be a compromise.\n\nI think I could use assert statements at the beginning of a method \nand at the end, checking preconditions and postconditions.\n\nBy marking them somehow as preconditions and postconditions it should \ntheoretically be possible to automate generation of JUnit \ntests/suites, including test data. The test data can be created \nautomatically by a tool which obeys the preconditions for that \npurpose. Java Modelling Language seems to do exactly this. But I \nthink it is not adopted widely.\n\nIt seems that with JUnit I can only test methods which return a \nvalue. Using JUnit will change the code one would normally create: \nBecause of JUnit you need to overwrite equals(), toString() and are \nnot allowed to use void return type if you want to test that method.\n\nUsing the assert statement instead I can also test classes which \nreturn no value.\n\nBesides all this problems whis JUnit is another one: Successful \nJUnits tests are no guarantee that there are no bugs in the code I \nread. This has to do with data chains. But I didn&#39;t understand this.\n\nAnd I read that it is extremely time consuming to create test cases \nfor all possible cases.\n\nThe good thing about using assert statements would also be, that the \ntest is included in the method. So no extra coding of classes would \nbe requiered as with using JUnit. Everything is in one place, user \nfriendly.\n\nUsing assert statements will not force the developer to use a special \ndeveloping practice like testdriven development. He is free to \ndevelop in his own style.\n\nThe synchronisation between test cases and methods to be tested would \nis time consuming. And what happens if you change a method so that \npreconditions or postconditions will become different? Will you \nremember to change the JUnit to fit these changes? Or will you \nsometimes forget? Error detecting is then twice as hard, since it can \noriginate in the test class or in the class to be tested. Thats a \npoint where assert statements are better in my eyes compared to JUnit.\n\nSo what do you think about my assumptions? I can be wrong because I&#39;m \ninexperienced with both of them.\n\nMaybe I write complete nonsense. So please correct me if necessary. \nThe side effects of pure JUnit programming seem very large to me.\n\n\n\n",
