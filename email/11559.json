Say whatever you want about the quality of the work, <br/>\nwhoever spends a year writing on a topic is almost certainly serious <br/>\nabout it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; You might be serious and use your own test runner.<br/>\n&gt; This does not preclude your also using the basic test<br/>\n&gt; runners.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t see at all how this follows from the preceding. The claim is <br/>\nthat if I am serious, then I have my own test runner, but I don&#39;t have <br/>\nmy own test runner, so that implies that I am not serious. That is my <br/>\nobjection. I&#39;m quite serious.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The fact that there is apparent need for better test<br/>\n&gt; runners, that basic runners are not used by all IDEs<br/>\n&gt; or ANT makes my question legitimate, I think.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Oh yes, just not the claim that &quot;all serious people have their own test <br/>\nrunners.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; JUnit is the de facto standard, but it&#39;s the TestCase<br/>\n&gt; interface, not anything else. Or am I mistaken?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The framework is what&#39;s standard, and not the test runners. Correct.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
