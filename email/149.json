    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1072982140\">I too have been assigned to write unit tests for abstract classes.  Here is <br/>\nhow I approached for a few differenct cases:<br/>\n<br/>\n1)Class declared abstract but with no abstract methods.  As an inner class to <br/>\nmy testing class, I made a concrete extension the abstract super class which <br/>\nI use for testing purposes.  For example in AbstractFooTest, I created an <br/>\ninner class, AbstractFooExtension, which extends AbstractFoo.<br/>\n<br/>\n2)Class with abstract methods on which the concrete methods have no <br/>\ndependencies.  Same as 1) but stub in the abstract methods.  In other words, <br/>\nif the abstract methods can&#39;t impact state or are not called by the concrete <br/>\nmethods, then I am free to test concrete methods.<br/>\n<br/>\n3)Class with abstract methods on which the concrete methods do have <br/>\ndependencies.  Use Kevin&#39;s methodology.<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@egroups.com\">junit@egroups.com</a> wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; You might try simply mimicking the class hierarchy in your test <br/>\n&gt; classes.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; For example, to test an abstract &quot;AbstractNavigator&quot; class, write <br/>\n&gt; an &quot;AbstractNavigatorTest&quot; class--also abstract.  You can write all <br/>\n&gt; the test cases here that should apply to any type of navigator.  And <br/>\n&gt; add an abstract method to it such as:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;     public asbstract AbstractNavigator newTestInstance();<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Now, to test one of the concrete implementations (which I assume you <br/>\n&gt; plan to do! :-)), just write a test class as a subclass of <br/>\n&gt; AbstractNavigatorTest--mirroring the inheritance hierarchy. <br/>\n&gt; Implement <br/>\n&gt; that method you declared and you&#39;re pretty much good to go!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Does that help?  I have an example which tests java.util.Set (an <br/>\n&gt; interface) in this way--just ask and I will send it to you!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Kevin<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@egroups.com\">junit@egroups.com</a>, Coralee Allaby &lt;cvallaby@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve been using JUnit to test my Java classes for a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; few weeks now.  I&#39;ve reached a problem that others<br/>\n&gt; &gt; have encountered as well.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Here&#39;s the problem:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve been asked, by my team leader, to write what&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; called an AbstractNavigator.  It doesn&#39;t matter what a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Navigator is, the important point is that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; AbstractNavigator is an abstract class. This abstract<br/>\n&gt; &gt; class has a couple subclasses already (MDINavigator<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and TabbedPaneNavigator), and more will be written in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the future.  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; We want to create unit tests (using JUnit, let&#39;s say<br/>\n&gt; &gt; AbstractUnitTest) which will apply to any<br/>\n&gt; &gt; AbstractNavigator.  Herein lies the problem.  I can&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; actually test the AbstractNavigator because I can&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;have a(n)&quot; AbstractNavigator since it&#39;s abstract. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Therefore, I need to test a subclass of the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; AbstractNavigator, but currently, the only way I see<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of doing that (making the AbstractUnitTest &quot;have a&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; MDINavigator) restricts the abstractedness of the unit<br/>\n&gt; &gt; tests.  The AbstractUnitTest could not be used without<br/>\n&gt; &gt; recompiling, a step to be avoided.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Another method we&#39;ve thought of is to add a method<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;getNavigator&quot; to the AbstractUnitTest which is called<br/>\n&gt; &gt; from the TestCase setUp() method.  This getNavigator<br/>\n&gt; &gt; method would only be implemented by subclassing the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; AbstractUnitTest class and would then return the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; specific type of AbstractNavigator to be tested (i.e.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; MDINavigator).  The problem with this solution is that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the method of TestCase which returns the TestSuite is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; static and therefore cannot be overridden...where to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; go from here?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; If anyone can give us any more information about this<br/>\n&gt; &gt; kind of abstract unit testing, we would greatly<br/>\n&gt; &gt; appreciate it.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Thanks,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; CJ<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; __________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
