You can also search the\narchives of the Extreme Programming list\n&lt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/extremeprogramming&gt;  There are many threads\nthere dedicated to the topic of testing programs that use any external\nsupport mechanism (database being the most common, but you could apply it to\nRMI, CORBA, JNI, etc.).\n\nThe best advice I can give at a high level is architect to the use of Mock\nObjects.  If your design cannot support that now, it is probably not a\n_very_ flexible design.  Flexibility is good, in most cases :)\n\n\n",
