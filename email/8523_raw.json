However, during a recent peer review of the\ncode, we discovered an inconsistency between the contract of one of the\nmethods in java.io.InputStream and my implementation of that same method\nin the specialized subclass.\n\n \n\nProblem:\n\nI would like to have a set of functional tests (black-box style) that\nenforce the behaviors of the super class, java.io.InputStream. Then use\nthat same set of tests to ensure that the basic contracts for each of\nthe classes I write follow that contract (i.e. pass those generic\ntests). Does anyone have a suggestion for doing this? While this\nspecific example pertains to java.io.InputStream the same scenario may\noccur with any class hierarchy.\n\n \n\nEnvironment:\n\nI use Ant to compile and run my tests, so ideally any solution will be\ncompatible with the &lt;batchtest&gt; mechanism or otherwise allow for the\ndynamic (read, &quot;automatic&quot;) addition of new tests.\n\n ----- End -----\n\n \n\nOk, the pointer was for an abstract test class. I can see the\napplicability for a simple inheritance problem as the one I posted was.\nHowever, there is a situation where that solution does not seem to work.\nEnforcing interfaces&#39; contracts - I cannot use the same model to enforce\nthree different interface&#39;s contracts (since there is no multiple\ninheritance). Also, only some objects implement the equals method. These\nI have a standard set of tests to ensure that null and a few other\nscenarios are handled correctly (as well as the hashcode / equals\nrelationship). I would like to have these standard tests available for\ndifferent objects without having to rewrite them all the time.\n\n \n\nAny further suggestions?\n\n \n\nJosh  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
