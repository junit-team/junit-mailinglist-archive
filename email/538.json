Writing<br/>\ntests to illustrate reported bugs sounds like an excellent approach.  I am<br/>\nworking on a decent sized system that does not have any tests so choosing<br/>\ntest areas was a question of mine as well.<br/>\n\tI have a second problem with testing this system.  How do you test a<br/>\ntightly coupled system?  One answer is to use tests to drive better design.<br/>\nHowever, it would take too long and be too risky to redesign major parts of<br/>\nthe system.  So, while the design takes time to improve, do you have any<br/>\nsuggestions for how to test a very coupled system that requires setting up<br/>\nseveral things before the class being tested will function properly?  i.e.<br/>\nWhat are some good strategies that will help locate bugs and improve<br/>\ndevelopment speed without shutting down development?</div>",
