This seems like<br/>\n&gt; simplest and most elegant solution to me.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The problem though is when a test fails, you don&#39;t get any<br/>\n&gt; informartion about what field(s) that actually differed between the<br/>\n&gt; two objects. You could also implement a toString() method, but for<br/>\n&gt; large classes it&#39;s still quite hard see in the test output where the<br/>\n&gt; mismatch is.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Because of this I usually write a series assertEquals(a.getFoo(),<br/>\n&gt; b.getFoo()) statements in my test case instead, event though I would<br/>\n&gt; prefer the equals() way of doing it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Does anyone have a neat solution to using the equals() method in tests<br/>\n&gt; and still get good output from the tests when something fails?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There&#39;s something in Jakarta Commons BeanUtils like &quot;describe&quot; where you <br/>\ncan take a JavaBean and get its contents as a Map. This would make it <br/>\neasier, I think, to find the part of the object that&#39;s different. You <br/>\ncould write your own custom assertion that checks the Maps key by key to <br/>\ngive you a better error message.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn general, I usually resort to pasting the toString() output into a <br/>\ntext editor and scan the strings carefully, lining them up first on two <br/>\nconsecutive lines. Not great, but considering I don&#39;t have to do it very <br/>\noften, it&#39;s not a big problem. If I have to do it often, then I usually <br/>\nhave a bigger problem to solve. :)<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
