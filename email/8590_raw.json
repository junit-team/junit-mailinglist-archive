By default it prints at the begining of \neach test case a dot: &quot;.&quot; and if there is any fail or error the \nletter &quot;F&quot; or &quot;E&quot; respectively. \n\n.E...F.F.F..\n\nSo you don&#39;t have more information about the trace of the execution \nof the test. I would like to get the following output more or less:\ntest1 ... OK\ntest2 ... F\ntest3 ... E\ntest4 ... OK\n.\n.\n.\n\nI guess there is a way to do that, but it is not so much documented. \nProbably to extends the class ResultPrinter that implements the \nTestListener interface, but I don&#39;t see how to get dynamically the \nname of the test case (that is the name of the test method of the \ntesting class).\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nDavid\n\n\n",
