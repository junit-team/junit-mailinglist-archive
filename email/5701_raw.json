I may be taking the lazy way out, but I trust the \nApache people to write working software.\n\nThanks anyway.\n\n--- In junit@y..., philipborlin@d... wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; I have been thinking about this a lot lately since we have some \nmessy\n&gt; threading code in our gui.  Our main problems are locking down \nobjects\n&gt; while state transitions are occuring.  We wrote some pretty basic \nthread\n&gt; tools based on ones in various books and then wrote unit tests for \nthem.\n&gt; It turns out that the unit tests were extremely tricky but I \nhaven&#39;t found\n&gt; an easier way to test mulithreaded behavior.\n&gt; \n&gt; Below I have attached a read/write lock implementation and the \naccompanying\n&gt; unit test.  The unit test uses a conditional event and so I have \nincluded\n&gt; that also.  I have stripped out all the code and just left the \nsignatures\n&gt; and comments from the ReadWriteLock and ConditionalEvent since I \ndon&#39;t\n&gt; think my employer wants me publishing its code, but I have left the \nentire\n&gt; test intact.\n&gt; \n&gt; I could not get to javaranch so I could not get to your original \npost, but\n&gt; if you want to send some code (even if it is privately), I would be \nwilling\n&gt; to take a look.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Phil\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; (See attached file: ReadWriteLockTest.java)(See attached file:\n&gt; ReadWriteLock.java)(See attached file: ConditionalEvent.java)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;                                                                     \n                  \n&gt;                     &quot;weitzman_d&quot;                                    \n                  \n&gt;                     &lt;weitzman_d@y        To:     \njunit@y...                \n&gt;                     ahoo.com&gt;            \ncc:                                          \n&gt;                                          Subject:     [junit] Unit \ntesting            \n&gt;                     08/29/2002           multithreaded network \ncode                   \n&gt;                     03:05 \nPM                                                          \n&gt;                     \nPlease                                                            \n&gt;                     respond \nto                                                        \n&gt;                     \njunit                                                             \n&gt;                                                                     \n                  \n&gt;                                                                     \n                  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve asked this question at javaranch.com, so I&#39;ll just provide an\n&gt; brief description here and point to the original question for anyone\n&gt; who wants to give it a shot (just reply on this list though).\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m writing the beginnings of a multithreaded server, and I had to\n&gt; insert a lot of calls to Thread.sleep() in my unit testing code for\n&gt; it to pass.  Is there some good way to test multithreaded code that\n&gt; doesn&#39;t invole just waiting a few milliseconds and hoping that a \ntask\n&gt; finished?  I imagine that a better solution might involve calls to\n&gt; join() but tie the unit test closely to the particular \nimplementation.\n&gt; \n&gt; Anyway, here&#39;s the original question with my current, unsatisfactory\n&gt; test (although it doesn&#39;t have much of the code being tested - I\n&gt; didn&#39;t want to clutter the post.  I should add some.):\n&gt; \n&gt; http://saloon.javaranch.com/cgi-bin/ubb/ultimatebb.cgi?\n&gt; ubb=get_topic&f=9&t=001390\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@y...\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
