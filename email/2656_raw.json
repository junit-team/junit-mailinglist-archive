I&#39;m looking at doing frequent\nbuilds (e.g. nightly builds) and am not sure how to get all the\npieces to work together.\n\nHere&#39;s what I (think I) know so far...\n\nThe development platform is Windows NT 4.0 SP 6.\n\nI have an Java application, Ant, and JUnit. I can, via Ant, build\nand run the JUnit tests that I have created.\n\nI just grabbed a copy of CVS and placed all the files under CVS.\n\nI downloaded TomCat and installed Tomcat and can start it up.\n\nI downloaded CruiseControl, JCVS, and jcvslet.\n\n\nHere&#39;s where I&#39;m stuck and could use pointers to some info/docs\non this stuff.\n\nA) How to setup CVS to allow other developers to access/change the\n   code (server mode)? I D/Led JCVS client code, but I&#39;m not sure\n   what I need to do, to get a CVS server going. Do I run the\n   jcvslet? If so how? I&#39;d like to understand how to setup to use\n   CVS in a multi-developer environment (I used to other tools).\n\nB) It sounds like to automate the build I need to run CruiseControl.\n   Part of the setup for CruiseControl says to install a servlet\n   engine (TomCat). I have done that, but I don&#39;t know how to configure\n   TomCat (type 1,2 or 3 mode). Also I don&#39;t know how to install the\n   WAR file like they are saying. I guess I don&#39;t have a grasp yet on\n   all this servlet stuff (any book suggestions?).\n\nC) I&#39;d like to get to the point where it checks to see if files have\n   been altered (checked in) and will automatically check out the\n   latest code and build it, run the tests, and e-mail me the results.\n   It sounds like CruiseCOntrol will do all this. Is that correct? Do\n   I have to run CVS in server (versus local) mode to do all this?\n\n\nWow! There sure is alot to all this. If you have any insights, know of\nweb pages or docs, or newsgroups where this has been hashed out\nalready, I sure would appreciate any info you can provide.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n \nPCM (Paul Michali)\n\nCarrier Voice Gateway Business Unit (CVGBU)\nCisco Systems, Inc.\n250 Apollo Drive\nChelmsford, MA 01824\n\nPhone : (800) 572-6771 x 45817  (978) 244-5817 [direct]\nPaging: (800) 365-4578 [voice]  pcm@...
