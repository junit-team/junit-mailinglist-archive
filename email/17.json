I think that one could do it by examining<br/>\n&gt;&gt; the classpath (available via System.getProperty()) for .class files and<br/>\n&gt;&gt; using reflection to determine whether they were TestCases, but I haven&#39;t yet<br/>\n&gt;&gt; tried it.  Anybody have anything that does this?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I will support that in some of the next JUnitX versions although there<br/>\n&gt; is a<br/>\n&gt; drawback. If somebody manually removes a test from a suite() method<br/>\n&gt; because<br/>\n&gt; it is broken and no longer maintained for some reason, it would be<br/>\n&gt; collected<br/>\n&gt; by an automated search.<br/>\n&gt; Using a special marker interface might be a rough solution, but there is<br/>\n&gt; more<br/>\n&gt; to it than just working around Java´s restrictions in traversing the<br/>\n&gt; tree<br/>\n&gt; of avail classes.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I suppose that&#39;s true.  On the other hand, traversal might be a nice first<br/>\ncut.<br/>\n<br/>\nEach package could have a &quot;restrictions.txt&quot; file or something similar that<br/>\nlisted cases not to run.  Another idea might be to enhance the TestRunner to<br/>\nallow you to disable certain found tests, especially if not running a given<br/>\ntest were a temporary thing.  In my development, this would probably be OK,<br/>\nsince I might remove or otherwise disable more permanently a test that I<br/>\nwasn&#39;t maintaining at the moment.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the test finder looked for a suite() method in each TestCase class before<br/>\nusing its methods via reflection, one could disable an entire TestCase by<br/>\nsimply returning an empty TestSuite from that method.  (I&#39;m not sure if the<br/>\n&quot;new TestSuite(SomeTest.class)&quot; already looks for suite methods or not.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother issue might be use of native code in some tests: our team has<br/>\n&quot;AllTests&quot; and &quot;ReallyAllTests&quot; to exclude some classes that we haven&#39;t been<br/>\nable to make work well under the loading runner.  (For the curious: we get a<br/>\nsecurity exception of some kind.  We might be able to work around this,<br/>\nespecially with Java 2, but haven&#39;t yet with 1.1.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI might play around with some of this using JUnit 3.2 if possible, but I&#39;m<br/>\nnot sure that I&#39;ll find time.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the way, what are some of the forces that led you to start JUnitX?  I<br/>\nhaven&#39;t had a chance to really play with it, but might -- it looks like it<br/>\ncould have some nice stuff.  (I&#39;m not sure whether I&#39;d use the major<br/>\nfunctionality of access to restricted classes and members or not, though.)<br/>\nDoes it work with JDK 1.1?<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\nBen Schroeder<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:schroeder@...\">schroeder@...</a></div>",
