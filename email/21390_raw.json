Are there any large\n&gt; projects that use it? Good places to get started on it?\n\nWhen you say adopting Confluence, do you mean adopting it as a\nplatform on which you build your own application?\n\nI haven&#39;t developed anything on top of Confluence myself but I have\nseen a multi-module Maven project with one of the modules being a\nskeleton for a Confluence plugin (generated with Atlassian&#39;s tools, I\nbelieve). That skeleton had a bunch of automated tests itself so even\nif they took ages to run (can&#39;t remember exactly but it was several\nminutes) at least the existence of automated tests suggests that it&#39;s\nnot the worst platform to build on.\n\nOf course, this is just an educated guess so... Grain of salt.\n\nLasse\n\n-- \nLasse Koskela\n* Author of &quot;Test Driven&quot; (Manning Publications, 2007) *\n* Reaktor Innovations * http://www.ri.fi/en *\n\n",
