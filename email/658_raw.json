I define the filenames into a String array so the test are always correctly run (more or less looping according to the array size).\n&gt; The trouble is that as soon as one of the test on the files fails looping is either stopped or I don&#39;t get any feed back in the JUnit window.\n&gt; \nThere was a thread with a similar theme a few weeks ago.  I think its \nconclusion was that you should extend TestCase to accept a single filename\nand run a single test object per filename.  Create a suite object\nwhich accepts the String Array and loops creating tests instead \nof the Test looping within itself.\n\n-- \nJoi Ellis                    Software Engineer\nAravox Technologies          joi@..., gyles19@...\n\nNo matter what we think of Linux versus FreeBSD, etc., the one thing I\nreally like about Linux is that it has Microsoft worried.
