I attempt to write\n&gt; standalone (decoupled) classes, I attempt to make them have well structed\n&gt; &quot;APIs&quot; but at the end of the day, if A uses B (however implemented, and\n&gt; however used -- aggregation, subclassing, command/messaging paradigms,\n&gt; whatever) *for whatever reason* then surely for A to work, B ought work? If\n&gt; B fail a test then it has broken the contracts the tests assert, so it&#39;s\n&gt; behaviours must be deemed unknown. I B is unknown, I could argue (a user\n&gt; choice, on a per case basis) that it isn&#39;t worth knowing what the outcome of\n&gt; A&#39;s results test are. If they pass, then perhaps those tests don&#39;t cover\n&gt; enough. If they fail, isn&#39;t quite likely because B failed and what A relied\n&gt; upon is bogus?\n\nI think what everyone&#39;s trying to tell you is that this issue of\ndependencies in your tests is a code smell, and though you may be used\nto doing it this way, there MIGHT be a healthy way to decouple your code\nso that this issue doesn&#39;t persist.\n\n\n&gt; &gt;\tMaybe the direct dependency on the collection object is the problem in the\n&gt; &gt;\tfirst place. You could take your problem with many test cases failing at\n&gt; once\n&gt; &gt;\tas a strong hint to remove this direct dependency. If your collection\n&gt; object,\n&gt; &gt;\thowever, is so low level that a direct dependency does not hurt then it\n&gt; &gt;\tshould be very very stable; the probability that it fails in a fundamental\n&gt; way,\n&gt; &gt;\twhich makes lots of other tests fail too, is very low.\n&gt; \n&gt; There might be gold in that statement. You are saying that failures can\n&gt; propagate (as I say) but that as you go up the stack the chance for\n&gt; catastrophic failure ought not be there. I wonder if the result I am looking\n&gt; for is better suited in the case of catastrophic failure, not just &quot;some\n&gt; obscure failure&quot;. That is possible.\n&gt; \n&gt; With this observation, maybe what I am asking for is too fuzzy. I think that\n&gt; code uses code (however you structure it) and much as there ought not be\n&gt; dependency on internal, if code breaks is &quot;API agreement&quot; then anything that\n&gt; uses that API is in doubt, and not worth testing. Trouble is, I&#39;d not want\n&gt; to do this on a &quot;method by method&quot; or &quot;test by test&quot; basics, so I was\n&gt; proposing doing it on TestCases. At this level, I can see how it is not fine\n&gt; grained enough, and perhaps too fuzzy.\n\nOK Here I can talk about this.   \n\nIn my code, if an object I&#39;m working on wants to offer behavior to\nothers, he first gets an Interface and then I create an interface for\npeople he works with.  Next I implement those two interfaces.  In order\nto test each Implementation, I run a MockObject of the interface not\nbeing tested.  MockObjects don&#39;t fail and don&#39;t need to be tested.  Each\nobject can be tested in isolation from the other.  I don&#39;t have to worry\nabout some other class failing, and thus making my test on The other\nclass suspect. (Psst... Use EasyMock)\n\nMy biggest pet peeve in my current job, is a Monster Singleton that&#39;s\nreferred to by static reference EVERYWHERE IN OUR GUI!!!!\n\nCan&#39;t test anything, because that singleton is so tightly coupled with\nall of the code, and he takes a lot, including a Tomcat server address\n(working) in order to do even the slightest thing.  So, my major task at\nmy work is to slowly but surely reduce the dependencies on this monster,\nas I go.  I do it very slowly and by forcing people to work through an\ninterface instead of directly through him.  I&#39;m still plugging away at\nit.   I shall overcome!\n\nCheers,\n\n-- \nDavid Boyer &lt;mangr3n@...&gt;\n\n\n\n",
