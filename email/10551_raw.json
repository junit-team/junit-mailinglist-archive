Earlier today a\ndeveloper noticed a UI bug where by a selected row within one of my reports\nwas not maintaining its selection state whilst processing events.  After\ninvestigation I wrote a number of unit tests to highlight the fault and as a\nresult fix the bug.  However on testing in a live environment I noticed my\napplication still exhibited the same erroneous behaviour, this I have\ntracked down to an error condition within the server - in certain\ncircumstances the server sends an additional erroneous event to the client.\nThe client *must* assume each event received is both valid and correct, and\nacts accordingly, unfortunately what the user sees is the same visual bug.  \n\nWhilst investigating this I wrote a further test that demonstrates that the\nclient will always fail given a particular series of events.  I like this\ntest because it documents that there is a problem within our system - which\nis useful when QA/support come over some time in the future to query the\nbehaviour the failing test reminds me where the problem is and what needs to\nbe done to fix it.  However being pragmatic I can see the server guys not\nfixing this for some time (in fact as we move towards a major release of the\nserver on a different branch it is a moot point as to whether it will ever\nbe fixed on this branch).  All of this means that I probably now have a\nred-bar test for the rest of this branch&#39;s life - and this doesn&#39;t sit well\nwith me.\n\nSo I am asking whether anyone else has had a similar experience and what\nthey did to resolve it?  The only thing I can think of at the moement is to\ngenerate a couple of suites - one with all my tests in it, the other with\nall but my failing test.  I don&#39;t like that really because I like the simple\nclick and go approach that Eclipse gives me so I would still always get a\nred-bar, and secondly who says I&#39;d ever remember to run this special suite?\n\nPeoples thoughts most welcome.\n\nJonathan\n\n\n\n--\nJonathan Oddy\nSERVICEPower Business Solutions Ltd\nPetersgate House - St Petersgate - Stockport - SK1 1HE - ENGLAND\nTel: +44 (0)161 476 2277\nEmail: j.oddy@... &lt;mailto:j.oddy@...&gt;\n\n\n",
