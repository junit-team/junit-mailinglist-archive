I think that when I was in school \nthere was this unspoken assumption that, well, to write code you have to \nbe smart and if you&#39;re smart you&#39;ll be able to keep the whole system in \nyour head anyway -- using tests as change detectors would be seen as a \nsign of weakness. I guess it doesn&#39;t help either that it took a while to \nmake rapid builds possible also. We had to get past batch processing, etc.\n\nAnyway, I hope that the encapsulation balance changes. I&#39;ve been doing a \nlot thinking on it recently and I&#39;ll be presenting a session called &#39;API \nDesign As If Unit Testing Mattered&#39; at SDWest and SPA2007. It&#39;s really \nall about the fact that it&#39;s obvious that most commercial API designers \nhaven&#39;t thought about how to make it possible to write unit tests for \ncode that uses their APIs. I&#39;m going to show some glaring examples in \nJava, C++, and C#, and talk about some alternatives.\n\nMichael Feathers\nwww.objectmentor.com\n\nCédric Beust ♔ wrote:\n\n&gt;&gt;The emphasis on testing has only received more visibility in the past\n&gt;&gt;five years, and some of its principles are indeed at odds with some of\n&gt;&gt;the OO knowledge that has been pervading the software industry for two\n&gt;&gt;decades now.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;After being told repeatedly that encapsulation was paramount to\n&gt;&gt;software quality, it&#39;s not always easy to let this go in favor of\n&gt;&gt;another technique, but I think the message is getting through and that\n&gt;&gt;more and more developers are becoming more aware of the pros and cons\n&gt;&gt;between &quot;extreme OO&quot; and &quot;pragmatic testing&quot;.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;In hindsight, I am absolutely shocked that all the teachers I had in\n&gt;&gt;school 20+ years ago that I had so much respect for had absolutely no\n&gt;&gt;inclination (and sometimes only contempt) for testing...\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n\n\n\n\n",
