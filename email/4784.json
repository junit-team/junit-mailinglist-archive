But JUnit <br/>\nencourages refactoring for testing.  Often times it removes any hard <br/>\ncoded assumptions and you&#39;ll end up designing your code better.<br/>\n<br/>\nProcedures that do work may be tricky, especially if you can&#39;t change <br/>\nthe code your testing (see the hard coded assumptions problem presenting <br/>\nitself?).  If can change the code though, you *should* manipulate it to <br/>\nallow you to test the state of the object in some manner.  Believe me, <br/>\nyour code will be better for it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 2) How will you test procedures that are composed of several<br/>\n&gt; functions?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>(Leaving this for someone else to answer.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 3) Can JUnit ever replace stepping thru with a debugger?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My question is can it ever replace all my print statements?</div>",
