The first one stuffs a row into the database based on a set\nof supplied values.  The second one slurps up a database row based on the\nsupplied key values.  The third instantiates the object based on a SQL\nresult set.  The latter 2 constructors speak up when an underlying data\nelement is missing (i.e., missing from the result set).  When you know the\nkey values for a particular row, use the 2nd constructor.  When you know\nsome but not all of the key values, or have an ad-hoc SQL query, use the 3rd\nconstructor.\n\nAny class can issue a SQL query that returns one or more rows.  Using a\ncombination of these 3 constructors,  we can run just about any arbitrary\nSQL query from anywhere (including our tests) and convert the results into\nthe objects that our business logic understands.  Call\nassertIsNotNull(Object) on the newly constructed object to verify that the\ndatabase has your data.\n\nAdmittedly, managing constructors in the JDBC layer is a coding policy and\nnot a testing technique, but it achieves the same result.  Further, it\npushes some responsibility for testability onto the developers and makes our\ntest cases easier to write (since you can assume the existence of a given\nset of constructors with a known format and function).  Test authors simply\nlearn the database keys and the JDBC layer becomes intuitive.\n\nCheers,\n\n_chas_\n\n&gt; From: &quot;Jason Trip&quot; &lt;jason_trip@...&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Friday, March 30, 2001 11:23 AM\n&gt; Subject: [junit] an assert for testing a ResultSet\n&gt;\n\n&gt; I have a lot of tests that need to assert that data was inserted in our\n&gt; database.  Does anyone have a better way than to get a ResultSet and loop\n&gt; through with a bunch of assert statements?\n&gt;\n&gt; I thought it might be cool to have an assert that lets you pass a\nresultset,\n&gt; a number of expected records, and a two-dimensional array of expected\nvalues\n&gt; (if it could handle the data types correctly)...any other thoughts?\n\n\n",
