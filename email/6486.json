    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1381426712\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt; From: J. B. Rainsberger [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jbr@...\">jbr@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; So said  Michael Silverstein  on  2002-12-17 --------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;That said, it would be nice if Smalltalk supported<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Interfaces, which I find extremely useful but is not yet <br/>\n&gt; supported in<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Smalltalk, to my knowledge.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Smalltalk supports interfaces, in a way; although it supports<br/>\n&gt; abstract classes even better.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Push a method up to a superclass and, in the superclass, have<br/>\n&gt; the method answer &quot;SubclassResponsibility&quot; or whatever the <br/>\n&gt; exact method name is.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I really don&#39;t see how it can be said that standard Smalltalk supports<br/>\nanything like an Interface. I like Interfaces because they are the<br/>\npurest form of abstraction I&#39;ve found. Interfaces are completely<br/>\nagnostic about implementation to the point that they make no assumptions<br/>\nabout which type they are to be applied to. <br/>\n<br/>\nTo tie this into JUnit, any class can implement the Test interface and<br/>\nautomatically be considered a test. Of course JUnit stumbles insofar as<br/>\ncollecting suites (see the static suite() method and my earlier comments<br/>\nabout that), but that&#39;s mainly because of its departure from the use of<br/>\nits own Test interface to define an API for test collection.<br/>\n<br/>\nUsing &#39;^self subclassResponsibility&#39; is a sort of stopgap mechanism for<br/>\nindicating abstraction, but appears in my opinion to be weaker than<br/>\nbeing able to use an &#39;abstract&#39; modifier. Plus using abstract classes<br/>\nand methods falls short of interfaces because you are still tied to a<br/>\nparticular hierarchy. Not that this mechanism is bad but it limits your<br/>\nflexibility to a degree.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I have found that I don&#39;t want interfaces when I work with Ruby or<br/>\n&gt; Smalltalk: I like the idea that handling methods has nothing<br/>\n&gt; to do with type.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know what this statement means. Can you elaborate?<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom the above, it may appear that I am contradicting my earlier<br/>\ncontention that Smalltalk is a better OO language, but believe me I am<br/>\nnot. Lack of support for interfaces is a nit compared to some of the<br/>\nhorrors I&#39;ve seen in the Java language. For a taste, try to exploit<br/>\nclass side (static) polymorphism.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Mike<br/>\n<br/>\nSilverMark, Inc.<br/>\nThe Object Testing Company<br/>\nwww.javatesting.com</div>",
