With a complete history of pass/fail patterns, a core<br/>\n&gt;&gt; runner could notice that test B never passes when test A fails, and<br/>\n&gt;&gt; that test A is failing today, and thus, mark B as &quot;Skipped (98%<br/>\n&gt;&gt; confidence of no new information after testA failed)&quot;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; This seems like a real win over manual dependency annotation, and I&#39;d<br/>\n&gt;&gt; be delighted to take a look at it if there were enough users (usual<br/>\n&gt;&gt; rules--create a github issue, and vote, vote, vote)<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This doesn&#39;t seem very optimal since the knowledge can only be gained when<br/>\n&gt; tests fail, which won&#39;t be the case most of the time.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Again, why leave this up to what seems like a difficult and unpredictable<br/>\n&gt; heuristic when it&#39;s so easy for users to explicitly state their dependencies<br/>\n&gt; in annotations?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What I&#39;m hearing is that in your experience, most projects have test<br/>\nfailures that are rare.  I&#39;m also hearing that your instinct is that<br/>\nhuman annotation of dependencies is a win.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m surprised.  I expected to hear either &quot;adding and maintaining<br/>\ndependency annotations is worth my time because I&#39;d otherwise lose so<br/>\nmuch of my time to diagnosing confusing frequent failures&quot;, or<br/>\n&quot;Frankly, my tests don&#39;t fail enough of the time for any kind of<br/>\ndependency solution to make much impact&quot;.  Can you explain further?<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a separate issue, I also hear that you&#39;re guessing my stated<br/>\nheuristic would be hard to write and unpredictable.  My instincts are<br/>\nthe opposite in both cases, so we&#39;d probably have to prototype and get<br/>\nsome data to answer the question.<br/>\n<br/>\n   David Saff<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; ***Cédric<br/>\n&gt; *<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
