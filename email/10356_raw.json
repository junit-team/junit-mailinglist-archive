We keep test code in separate c=\r\nodebases because it just seems tidier when you&#39;re looking at things in an I=\r\nDE like Eclipse, and because the dependency design for test code is looser =\r\nthan what we enforce for non-test code.  Whether or not we ship tests or wa=\r\nnt tests to have package access to CUTs is irrelevant, really.  The first p=\r\nroblem can be solved with build scripts and naming conventions and the seco=\r\nnd problem can be solved by package definition regardless of codebase collo=\r\ncation.\n\nI have a separate codebase for:\n- each jar that needs to be produc=\r\ned\n- license-dependent 3rdparty worflow\n- corresponding test code for each =\r\nnon-test codebase\n- two jars outside the scope of our authentication provid=\r\ner\n\nThe primary drivers for the organization are:\n1. JAAS authentication (r=\r\nequires separate codebase)\n2. runtime classloader scope isolation: system c=\r\nlasspath, EAR root or WAR (we have 2 WARs)\n3. test vs. non-test (we only bo=\r\nther to distinguish test codebases to the level of system and non-system)\n4=\r\n. a key third party dependency isolated and enforced in the structure and b=\r\nuild because it produces jars that licensed specially and installed dependi=\r\nng on marketing bundle.\n\nTake together 1, 2, and 4 and the overarching driv=\r\ner comes down to classloaders and runtime dependencies.  Mapping codebases =\r\nto jars makes it easy to use things like Ant 1.6&#39;s &lt;macrodef&gt; to do compile=\r\n, jar, dist, etc.\n\nbuild.xml\n+ bin\n+ deployment\n+ docs\n+ lib\n  +-- 3rdparty=\r\n\n  +-- Workscape\n+ resorces\n+ src\n  +-- java\n      +-- boot\n      +-- ejb\n =\r\n     +-- ra\n      +-- system\n      +-- systest\n      +-- test\n      +-- use=\r\nr\n      +-- viewer\n      +-- web\n  +-- metadata\n      +-- struts\n      +-- =\r\nweb\n      +-- ra\n+ test-data \n\nGenerated EJB code is generated into the ejb=\r\n codebase and removed in &quot;clean&quot; based on a unique tag output only in gener=\r\nated files.\n\nAll build output goes into a build dir completely outside this=\r\n structure, after which the built jars are distributed into the lib dir for=\r\n internal use or building and installer.  Apps are all in another project, =\r\nwhere each app is a sort of plugin in its own mini project (not shown).  By=\r\n &quot;app&quot; I mean a module of Web app functionality -- apps are all merged into=\r\n one EAR/WAR after installation.\n\nScott Stirling\nWorkscape\n\n***************=\r\n********************************************************\nThis message is in=\r\ntended only for the use of the intended recipient and\nmay contain informati=\r\non that is PRIVILEGED and/or CONFIDENTIAL.
