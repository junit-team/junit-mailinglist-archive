Not only the unit <br/>\ntesting that JUnit can help on, but GUI testing, button clicking and all <br/>\nsorts of ugly stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The bottom line is that most projects are<br/>\n&gt; too big, and especially most &quot;midsize enterprise application&quot;s are too<br/>\n&gt; big, by which I mean that they&#39;re much more often than not treated as<br/>\n&gt; big blobs of stuff, rather than side-by-side, loosely coupled modules<br/>\n&gt; that work when you put them together.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m biased towards &quot;Better, Faster, Lighter Java&quot;<br/>\nas a philosophy, but I&#39;m not sure it is practical.<br/>\nSome applications are just big, slow, and ugly.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that a fair number of magic numbers and parameters would be <br/>\neasier to edit, check, and use if they were written in Java code. <br/>\nSingleton or not. Its not like editing big XML files is something you <br/>\nshould do in Notepad.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust IMHO, of course.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nPat Farrell<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.pfarrell.com/\">http://www.pfarrell.com/</a></div>",
