Why? Perhaps that&#39;s something you want to test!<br/>\n<br/>\nI can immediately imagine running one Java process before running your <br/>\ntests that retrieve the system property, writes it to file, then your <br/>\ntests read from that file. This would help all 10 JVMs use the same <br/>\nvalue for that property. The first Java process could even generate a <br/>\nscript that would run your tests with the system property value fixed.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
