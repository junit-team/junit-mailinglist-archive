If you need to change this to \nanother List implementation, then you have fewer changes to make.\n\n(2) Your tests are simple: populate the database with data, write News beans \nthat represent that data, assert that getAllNews() answers the same Set (or \nList, if you care about order within the collection) of News beans. Do this \nwith as many different datasets as you need to be confident that your method \nworks.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Also Can anyone pls throw light on ways & depth of Testing that\n&gt; \n&gt; could be applied on\n&gt; \n&gt; web application consisting of Classes,EJBs,Servlets etc..\n\nSearch the web. This kind of information is not easily found in books, yet. (If \nit is and I&#39;m wrong, someone please say so.)\n\n&gt; Is there any site which illustrates Real-time Testing with Junit\n&gt; \n&gt; apart from addTwoNumbers.etc...stuff ??\n\nDid you mean &quot;real time&quot; in the sense of hard constraints on response times, or \nsimply &quot;not trivial&quot;? My answer is the same: search the web, try things out and \nask specific questions on this list. Most of the time, it&#39;s easier than you \nthink.\n\nAlso try http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?JavaUnitBestPractices and start reading as many \nlinks as you can.\n\nGood luck.\n\nJ. B.
