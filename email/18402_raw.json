Thanks.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; You&#39;re welcome, and thank you for noting it. I know it&#39;s a knotty\n&gt;  &gt; problem to solve. I can&#39;t claim to know better, but I know what I don&#39;t\n&gt;  &gt; like, and I don&#39;t like this (quite). Of course, I&#39;m not exactly in\n&gt;  &gt; Agitar&#39;s market for this product right now, so my opinion is largely\n&gt;  &gt; theoretical in nature at present.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hi J.B.,\n&gt; \n&gt; As Agitar&#39;s co-founder and CTO, I always hesitate to jump into product\n&gt; discussions in this forum; but in this case it might be useful to\n&gt; clarify some things. Especially since the discussion seems to be\n&gt; quite civilized so far :-).\n\nI expect it to remain that way. I like your product, at least what I&#39;ve \nbeen able to use of it so far, and the Agitar folks I&#39;ve worked with \nhave been excellent. You even hired someone recently I&#39;d worked with at \nanother of my clients, and he&#39;s excellent, so your hiring practices are \nsound. :)\n\n&gt;  &gt;so my opinion is largely\n&gt;  &gt;theoretical in nature at present.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you for recognizing that, but I can see how (based on the brief\n&gt; description of our pricing model) you would reach your conclusions -\n&gt; so we have to fix that and be clearer.\n&gt; \n&gt; In practice, the number of classes on which the license is based is\n&gt; measured more in orders or magnitudes than an very precise class\n&gt; count.\n\nI suspected as much, but in any such scheme, eventually I will &quot;run out \nof classes&quot;, even if that number is 10,000 or 100,000. It will happen \nless frequently, sure, but the limit is nevertheless still there.\n\n&gt; Many of our licenses are actually enterprise-wide and for an\n&gt; unlimited number of users or classes. \n\nI suspected as much, but I can only imagine where the price-point is for \nthe &quot;all access pass&quot; for AgitarOne. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s suitably high for the \nvery high value you provide.\n\n&gt; In all cases, there is ample\n&gt; head-room for adding new classes and refactoring big-old-nasty\n&gt; classes. As a matter of fact, one of the top uses for our JUnit\n&gt; generation is to help create a safety net for working with legacy\n&gt; code; and class/method refactoring is one of the things that we\n&gt; recommend. You can see me giving a demo of exactly that type of\n&gt; refactoring (at the method level) at:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.agitar.com/solutions/products/agitarone_demos.html \n&gt; &lt;http://www.agitar.com/solutions/products/agitarone_demos.html&gt;\n\nI have no doubt as to the effectiveness of your product. I even support \nit as an indispensable tool for rescuing legacy codebases. I wish more \npeople would use it that way, than see it as a replacement for writing \ntests (in general).\n\n&gt; (It&#39;s the first of the four mini-demos on that page ... No making fun\n&gt; of my accent please, and NO we did not hire Borat to do the voice over\n&gt; :-)).\n&gt; \n&gt; Every pricing scheme has advantages and disadvantages. Most of us\n&gt; want to move away from per-seat licensing. I believe that a\n&gt; server-based solution with an unlimited number of classes (or with a\n&gt; very generous over-allotment for growth and refactoring) is a step in\n&gt; the right direction, but we are open to exploring other suggestions\n&gt; (like the one you already made).\n\nAs I wrote, I don&#39;t know of a better solution; I just know I don&#39;t like \na limit on the number of classes. There has to be a better way, but in \nthe meantime, AgitarOne&#39;s value mostly exceeds this annoyance. I suppose \nit would matter much more to me if I had a licence for up to 10,000 \nclasses, had 9,997 classes in my system and no more money to give you. \nSince I&#39;m not in that situation, I can&#39;t say much more. It might be a \ncase of &quot;Funny, it has never come up.&quot;\n\nTake care, Alberto.\n-- \nJ. B.
