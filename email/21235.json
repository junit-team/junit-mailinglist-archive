I <br/>\n&gt; think you could also make an argument that it would be better <br/>\n&gt; if the behavior was different.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In my view, the behavior is in fact an artifact of an <br/>\n&gt; implementation detail - namely that asserts indicate failures <br/>\n&gt; by throwing an exception. It could be made the case that <br/>\n&gt; JUnit &quot;should&quot; report those failing asserts as failing <br/>\n&gt; asserts, not as unexpected exceptions.<br/>\n&gt; Basically, the current behavior masks the true test failure.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Coincidentally, I&#39;ve been dealing with the same philosophical<br/>\nissue in NUnit because I&#39;m experimenting with a non-exception<br/>\napproach to reporting failures. When I changed how failures<br/>\nwere reported, some of my own tests naturally broke.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems to me that an assertThrows construct would solve the<br/>\nproblem entirely - converting an unexpected exception into a<br/>\nfailure case.<br/>\n<br/>\nCharlie</div>",
