Would that work? Isn&#39;t that how JUnitPerf works?\n\n\nYes.  However, my note was saying that the framework-extension approach may not \n(easily) work in some cases.  For example, if your fixture-setup in your \nTestCases took much longer, relatively, than the actual execution time of the \nClass Under Test.  This could cause (relatively) slight variances in the \nfixture-setup times to obscure (relatively) large variances in the excution time \nof your Class Under Test.\n\nIn this case, wrapping the performance metrics around the entire test method \ninvocation may not be good enough.  You may need to wrap your performance \nmetrics at a much finer granularity - such as directly around the invocation to \nthe Class Under Test.\n\nThis is most likely possible with a Plain Java approach, but I think it would be \nkind of tricky, and most likely involve reflection and the requirement to wrap \nall calls to your Classes Under Test to pass them through the metrics-gathering \ncode.\n\nAOP could provide a more elegant solution to this problem.  Each testcase could \ndefine it&#39;s Class Under Test in an instance variable.  The Aspect could then \nautomatically detect and wrap all these calls with the metrics-gathering code. \nIn this case, there is no need to remember to wrap every call to the Class Under \nTest, or to deal with the clutter and obscurity that would add.  Just a simple \ninstance method and some code in a single aspect.\n\nOf course, if you have all your fixtures perfectly refactored, and only have One \n  Assertion Per Test with no fixure code in the test method, that could change \neverything.  Not everyone has that situation, though ;)\n\nThanks,\nChad\n\n\n\n",
