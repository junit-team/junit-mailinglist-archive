Do you expect renumeration \nfrom commercial vendors, or is it an issue of respect? I&#39;ve released \nseveral open source products, none as cool as your :), and I am faced \nwith the same dilemma.\n\nRegards,\nDavid\n\n--- In junit@y..., Mike Clark &lt;mike@c...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Dave Astels wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;On Wed, 2002-10-02 at 16:25, Michael Silverstein wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;    We have a product called &#39;Enhanced JUnit&#39; (hence my interest \nin JUnit\n&gt; &gt;    extensibility issues) that (among other things) will disburse \nJUnit tests\n&gt; &gt;    across threads, VMs, and CPUs for concurrent execution.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;http://www.silvermark.com/Product/enhancedjunit/\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Not to start a flame war... but why don&#39;t you follow Beck&Gamma&#39;s\n&gt; &gt;example and give it to the JUnit community as so many others have \ndone\n&gt; &gt;with their extensions?\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s not my intent to add kindling, but this brings up a broader \nissue.\n&gt; \n&gt; You may find it interesting that Enhanced JUnit distributes \nJUnitPerf. \n&gt;  I sure did when I learned about it... when the product first hit \nthe \n&gt; streets.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Now don&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;m all about free enterprise.  There&#39;s no \ndoubt \n&gt; Enhanced JUnit adds its own bells and whistles over and above the \nopen \n&gt; source goodies it includes.  Indeed, distributing tests across \nseparate \n&gt; VMs is unique.  But Dave&#39;s use of the word &quot;community&quot; above struck \na \n&gt; chord with me.  \n&gt; \n&gt; As a member of this community, and the open source community in \ngeneral, \n&gt; it got me to thinking about the licenses I use for the stuff I \nbuild. \n&gt;  Anything I craft in the future may just be licensed such that \n&gt; commercial redistribution rights are only available by writing me. \n&gt;  Non-commercial redistribution, and its use in the development of \n&gt; non-commercial products, will be freely granted.  In other words, \nif I \n&gt; contribute to this community in good faith, commercial vendors have \nto \n&gt; ask before leveraging my wares.  \n&gt; \n&gt; I guess I expected that type of communication would happen \nnaturally \n&gt; inside of a community.  It won&#39;t be the first time I&#39;ve been naive, \nnor \n&gt; the last.
