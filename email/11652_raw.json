As you point out, this format works well for assertEquals() although we tend to use a lot of assertTrue.\n\nBy standardizing our testcase format, and specifying a defined expected result, and loading the actual, this also allows us to reduce many of the asserts to\n\nassertEquals(&quot;E: &quot; + expected + &quot; G: &quot; + actual, expected, actual);\n\nof course the same test could be \n\nassertTrue(&quot;E: &quot; + expected + &quot; G: &quot; + actual, expected == actual);\nor \nassertTrue(&quot;E: &quot; + expected + &quot; G: &quot; + actual, expected.equals(actual));\n\ndepending on the data type.\n\nSince we don&#39;t have to think much about the format it allows us to build the tests fairly quickly.\n\n\nLike any attempt to have a regular format, it can lead to inefficiencies. But we generally feel that the tradeoff is worth it. It also makes it much easier to bring someone new up to speed - they can worry less about the syntax of the failure message and more about the content.\n\n\nLike I said, we are pretty un-sophisticated, but it seems to work for us.\n\n\nJim\n\n\n\nJ.
