If you just change the JVM version, and let generics\nwarni=\r\nngs stand, are you concerned there would be behavior changes?\nI&#39;d be a litt=\r\nle surprised, but I can&#39;t say that I&#39;ve watched a large\nJava project go thr=\r\nough that transition, so I don&#39;t know.\n\n   David Saff\n\nOn Wed, Oct 6, 2010 =\r\nat 10:53 PM, rejohnsoca &lt;regan.v.johnson@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; I&#39;ve recently =\r\nbecome responsible for a piece of software, that runs under java 1.4.2. =A0=\r\nit has NO unit tests.\n&gt; I want to move it to Java 6, but the CTO of my comp=\r\nany is thinking that we should write a unit test suite first, so that we ca=\r\nn make sure the upgrade doesn&#39;t break anything.\n&gt;\n&gt; That&#39;s a nice idea, and=\r\n I&#39;m fully behind writing some unit tests. =A0I&#39;m not sure that the plan is=\r\n very practical, as I&#39;d really like to start with a recent version of JUnit=\r\n -like 4.8, and I can&#39;t use it with java 1.4.2\n&gt;\n&gt; We do have a reasonable =\r\nsuite of integration tests (which are NOT unit tests), to ensure that the u=\r\npgrade goes well.\n&gt;\n&gt; I was considering, rather than writing unit tests for=\r\n java 1.4.2, and JUnit 3.8 and then potentially rewriting all of them to ru=\r\nn under JUnit 4.8 after the upgrade, it would be better to upgrade the JVM =\r\nfirst, rely on integration tests, and then write unit tests from scratch fo=\r\nr JUnit 4.8.\n&gt;\n&gt; What do other people do if they are in a similar situation=\r\n?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
