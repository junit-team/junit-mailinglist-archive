The easiest way I have found\nto integrate any tool is to follow these steps:\n\n1. fully import the source/binaries\n2. create the tool directory and the default.ini for your tool\n3. import the Tools API into your workspace\n4. place any resource files you need into the tool directory (i.e. the gifs\nfor the awtui or swingui)\n5. include the project that has your tool in the workspace classpath\n(actually, its associated &#39;project_resources&#39; folder)\n6. include the Tools API project in your workspace classpath\n7. compute the classpath for the class that launches your tool\n\nThis allows you to not have to export class files to that tool directory\nevery time you make a change to the tool.\n\nAbout not finding the suite() method... that is a different story.  Some\nthings to look at:\n1. is your suite method public?\n2. does your suite method have no argument?\n3. if #1 and #2 hold true, get the source into VAJ and include a\nprintStackTrace() in the catch block that prints out &quot;Could not invoke the\nsuite() method&quot; and see what&#39;s going on.\n\n    &gt; Another problem I am having is that in spite of the fact \n    &gt; that I imported the source jar, when I double click\n    &gt; on a class VA tells me that it has been imported from a \n    &gt; class file. Also as a result I can not single step through\n    &gt; the code.\n\nThis is boggling.  Is it possible that you had a previous version of JUnit\nin the workspace that was class files?  This can cause a collision in VAJ,\neven though it isn&#39;t supposed to.  Are you sure you chose src.jar to import\nfrom?  If these things are not the case, then I would blow away the project\n(purge the packages from the RepositoryExplorer) and try again.\n\n-Jason\n\n\n",
