I had attended a \npresen=\r\ntation by Robert &quot;Uncle Bob&quot; Martin on Test Driven \ndevelopment. I think th=\r\ne exact example was a program to keep track \nof a bowling game score. Prese=\r\nnting the Big view object model and \none done through incremental, test dri=\r\nven development, the later was \nmuch simpler. It only required the creation=\r\n of objects needed to \nsolve the problem rather then the apparent objects a=\r\nnd their \nbehaviour.\n\nDavid\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;C=C3=A9dric Beu=\r\nst =E2=99&quot; &quot; &lt;cbeust@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; On 10/27/06, Joakim Ohlrogge &lt;joakim.=\r\nohlrogge@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I think, when doing TDD the main benefit i=\r\ns not to find bugs it \nis to\n&gt; &gt; guide\n&gt; &gt; your design.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Really?\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; The main reason why I write tests is to make sure that no \nregressions wi=\r\nll\n&gt; happen.
