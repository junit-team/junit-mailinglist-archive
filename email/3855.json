Rather, I&#39;m working <br/>\non a distributed system in which processes often alternatively play <br/>\nthe role of client and servers. My goal is to perform functionnal <br/>\ntest of the component which provides support for communication among <br/>\nprocesses. <br/>\n<br/>\nMore precisely, I need to exercise the network problems that can <br/>\noccur (which happen to behave differently based on which operating <br/>\nsystem the component is running on, albeit the program is written in <br/>\nJava), the potential threading problems (such as contention, <br/>\ndeadlocks and other safety problems).<br/>\n<br/>\nAs such, I believe the approach of mock objects is not so beneficial <br/>\nin my case, because it would require much effort to simulate complex <br/>\nexternal behaviors while still not exercizing some conditions that I <br/>\nencounter in a production environment.<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree I&#39;m trying to use JUnit for functional tests rather than unit <br/>\ntests for which it was designed. The reason I&#39;m currently doing this <br/>\nis that the Junit execution environment is convenient and well <br/>\nintegrated into our Java-base development process: Junit is <br/>\nintegrated into ANT and cruisecontrol, the two tools supporting <br/>\nautomatic build environment including automatic test execution, <br/>\ncollection of logs, analysis of test results and notification of test <br/>\nfailures.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes anyone know an alternative to the Junit framework (i.e. a better <br/>\napproach) to support automated functional tests that include more <br/>\nthan one process (and possibly more than one computer). The goal <br/>\nstill being to run these tests &quot;continuously&quot; and to reduce manual <br/>\ntasks to a minimum in order to detect introduced bugs as soon as <br/>\npossible? <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\nGuillaume.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In junit@y..., Mike Clark &lt;mike@c...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Conventional wisdom says to use mock objects to simulate the <br/>\nnetwork.
