Rainsberger) and Project=\r\nSuccess are\nproud to present our 3rd installment of the XP Day North Americ=\r\na\nseries, XP Day Montreal 2006. XP Day is a one day extreme programming\ncon=\r\nference to be held in Montreal, Quebec September 23, 2006.  For\nmore inform=\r\nation see below, but for those who prefer browsing a\nwebsite instead of rea=\r\nding plain text, visit: xpday.info\n\nIf you are looking for an opportunity t=\r\no learn more about Extreme\nProgramming without having to spend an entire we=\r\nek at a large\ninternational XP conference, XP Day Montreal fits the bill.  =\r\nXP Day is\na one-day event with activities for anyone interested in Extreme\n=\r\nProgramming, whether you&#39;re:\n\n* An executive wondering how to improve your =\r\nsoftware development\nteam&#39;s ROI.\n* A manager looking for ways to increase y=\r\nour team&#39;s effectiveness.\n* A skeptic, hoping to challenge some of the most=\r\n experienced and\noutspoken XP practitioners.\n* A programmer itching to expe=\r\nrience a real XP project room.\n* An experienced practitioner, hoping to exc=\r\nhange ideas or experiences\nwith other practitioners.\n\nFor those of you who =\r\nmissed out on Agile 2006, this would be an\nexcellent opportunity to meet, a=\r\nttend tutorial sessions and even work\nwith some of the XP community&#39;s most =\r\nnotable practitioners, for a\nfraction of the cost.\n\nXP Day events are inter=\r\nactive!\n\n- Tutorials\nWe are fortunate to have respected leaders of the XP c=\r\nommunity\nproviding world-class instruction and discussion on the fundamenta=\r\nls of\nXP.\n\n* Laurent Bossavit, keynote and recipient of the 2006 Gordon Pas=\r\nk\naward for contributions to the agile community. Laurent&#39;s keynote\naddress=\r\n is entitled &quot;They do things differently there&quot; wherein we will\nspeak of cu=\r\nltural gaps, ways to bridge them, and why that is relevant\nto the software =\r\nindustry.\n\n* Michael Feathers will also provide a tutorial entitled &quot;API de=\r\nsign\nas if testing mattered&quot; to show why the days of monolithic\napplication=\r\ns are over.\n\n* J.B. Rainsberger, recipient of the 2005 Gordon Pask Award, w=\r\nill\nprovide an &quot;Introduction to XP&quot; tutorial.\n\n- Open Space\nYou can collabo=\r\nrate intensively with both local and invited advanced\npractitioners on issu=\r\nes that challenge you most. If the tutorials\ndon&#39;t cover it, you can work t=\r\nhrough your burning questions in Open\nSpace.\n\n- Panel Discussion\nWe are ple=\r\nased to offer a panel discussion entitled &quot;Your customer is\nmore important =\r\nthan you think&quot;. Laurent, Michael, JB, Francois\nBeauregard and Dave Rooney =\r\nwill discuss why an involved customer is\ncritical to the success of your so=\r\nftware projects.\n\n- Project Room\nIf you&#39;re looking to dive in and immerse y=\r\nourself in XP, join the XP\nProject Room, where you&#39;ll have the opportunity =\r\nto work on project\nwith respected experts. Not sure what&#39;s going on? No pro=\r\nblem! Join the\nproject any time and someone will bring you up to speed quic=\r\nkly, just\nlike on a real XP project!\n\n- Cost\nXP Day is only $249 CND. Our c=\r\nonference cost includes a morning\nbreakfast and a hot Indian buffet for lun=\r\nch.  For those with more\ndomestic appetites, sandwiches will also be on han=\r\nd. Coffee & Soft\nDrinks will also be available throughout the day.\n\nIf you&#39;=\r\nre looking for more information, visit our website: xpday.info\n\nIf you have=\r\n any questions with regards to this event, please don&#39;t\nhesitate to contact=\r\n me at the email address listed above.\nHope to see you all there!\n\nNiraj Kh=\r\nanna\nXP Day Montreal.\n\n\n\n\n",
