Actually I started by running them \nin a single JVM but this introduced side-effects because my team&#39;s \nIPC components were not designed to be used this way...\n\n&gt; Remember that the point of JUnit is not to\n&gt; functionally test the software. It is to unit test it. Try to break \ndown\n&gt; your code into small testable pieces. By testing each piece you \nwill have\n&gt; greater control and more confidence that it will work once you put \nit\n&gt; together. It may not even be necessary to run the client and server \nat the\n&gt; same time if you take this approach; the test case could act as the \nserver\n&gt; for testing the client and vice-versa. These are just a few \nthoughts -- the\n&gt; details of your particular program may prevent such an approach. \nBut if you\n&gt; are testing your code from the very beginning you shouldn&#39;t have \ntoo much\n&gt; trouble doing it.\n\nI agree I&#39;m trying to use JUnit for functional tests rather than unit \ntests for which it was designed. This piece of code is some existing \ncode that needs to be tested and was not designed from the start with \ntestability in mind. Consequently, it&#39;s not so easy to break it into \nsmall parts for tests without investing a fair amount of time.\n\nThe reason I&#39;m trying to use Junit for functional tests is that the \nJunit execution environment is convenient and well integrated into \nour Java-base development process: Junit is integrated into ANT and \ncruisecontrol, the two tools supporting automatic build environment \nincluding automatic test execution, collection of logs, analysis of \ntest results and notification of test failures.\n\nDo you know an alternative to the Junit framework (i.e. a better \napproach) to support automated functional tests that include more \nthan one process (and possibly more than one computer). The goal \nstill being to run these tests &quot;continuously&quot; and to reduce manual \ntasks to a minimum in order to detect introduced bugs as soon as \npossible? \n\nThanks,\n\nGuillaume.\n\n\n\n",
