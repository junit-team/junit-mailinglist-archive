I have been using junit successfully for several weeks, but \nhave only been able to run tests which I locate directly below junit \nitself. I&#39;m tired of relocating packages to the junit hierarchy to \ntest them, and I&#39;m sure I should be able to run tests on any package \nanywhere if I have my system path and classpath set up correctly. \nJust haven&#39;t gotten it right yet...\n\nI have read all the junit.org documentation and articles about \norganizing test cases into suites, etc., but have not seen anything \nthat specifically explains how to run TestRunner against packages \nlocated elsewhere on the drive.\n\nCan someone please tell me what I&#39;m doing wrong in terms of setup:\n\nI have various Java projects stored as d:&#92;projects&#92;projname and am \nattempting J2EE format, so for any particular project named ABC the \nsource is located at\n d:&#92;projects&#92;projABC&#92;source&#92;java&#92;com&#92;companyname&#92;ABC&#92; \nwith subfolders as needed below that.\n\nMy corresponding junit tests are in a parallel structure at \nd:&#92;projects&#92;projABC&#92;tests&#92;java&#92;com&#92;companyname&#92;ABC&#92; \n\nThe class files for the source are located at\n d:&#92;abc_webapp&#92;web-inf&#92;classes&#92;com&#92;companyname&#92;ABC&#92;\n\nThe class files for my junit test files are located in the same place \nas the test files themselves.\n\nIn each test class, the package statement says \n package com.companyname.abc;\n\nand the import statements are whatever is needed from java/javax plus \nwhatever is needed from the project source plus \n import junit.framework.*;\n\nI develop on an NT machine. I&#39;ve got classpath pointing to \n d:&#92;projects&#92;projABC&#92;source&#92;java (although this seems unnecessary) \nand\n d:&#92;projects&#92;projABC&#92;tests&#92;java \nand\n d:&#92;abc_webapp&#92;web-inf&#92;classes\nand\n d:&#92;junit3_7 (although this seems unnecessary)\nand\n d:&#92;junit3_7&#92;junit.jar\n\nI&#39;ve got path pointing to \n d:&#92;projects&#92;projABC&#92;tests&#92;java\nand\n d:&#92;junit3_7\nand\n d:&#92;junit3_7&#92;junit.jar (although this seems unnecessary)\n\nIn a command prompt window, I cannot run the junit TestRunner from \nanyplace other than down in the junit3_7 folder, so I drop down \nthere. Then I can run all of the Junit TestRunner variations, but \nwhen I try to reference a test class located elsewhere on the hard \ndrive using com.companyname.abc.SomeTest I get a &quot;class not found&quot; \nerror.\n\nHopefully I&#39;m just missing the boat on something simple. Thanks for \nyour help.\n\n- DJ\n\nP.S. - Also, any further advice about how to better organize test \nfiles in relation to project files would be welcome. Putting them in \na structure parallel to the source code made sense to me, but might \nnot be the best.\n\n\n\n",
