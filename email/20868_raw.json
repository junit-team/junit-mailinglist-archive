The tests work\nfine in 4.4 and have the errors with 4=\r\n.5.  The developer that owns it\nis looking into it.\n\nThe test class using j=\r\nmockit was like the following code.  This is not\nthe original code, but it =\r\nhas the important elements.\nDisclaimer - The code organization is a bit wei=\r\nrd.  E.g. there is no\nreason for a mock class to also extend the same class=\r\n.  This was\nwritten by someone else.  I&#39;ve since cleaned it up a bit.\n\n/** =\r\nThe class to be tested. */\npublic class RealClass\n{\n   public List someMeth=\r\nod(Set input) {\n       // do something\n   }\n}\n\n\n/** The test class. */\npubl=\r\nic class SomeTest\n{\n    // for some reason they had both an instance of\n   =\r\n // the mocked class and one of the real class\n    private static MockClass=\r\n mockObj;\n    private static RealClass realObj;\n\n    // the data to be retu=\r\nrned by the mocked method\n    private static List someData;\n\n    @BeforeCla=\r\nss\n    private static void classSetup() {\n        Mockit.setUpMocks(MockCla=\r\nss.class);\n    }\n\n    @AfterClass\n    public static void classTearDown() {\n=\r\n        Mockit.restoreAllOriginalDefinitions();\n    }\n\n    public class Moc=\r\nkClass extends RealClass\n    {\n        @Override\n        public List someMe=\r\nthod(Set input) {\n            return someData;\n        }\n    }\n\n    // here=\r\n is the problem\n    // they use an instance of the real class and call some=\r\nMethod\n    // the method is mocked and setup above\n    // in 4.4 it would c=\r\nall RealClass.someMethod()\n    // in 4.5 it would call MockClass.someMethod=\r\n()\n    @Test\n    public void test1() {\n        Set input =3D ...;\n        L=\r\nist list =3D realClass.someMethod(input);\n        assertNotNull(list);\n    =\r\n    // and so on...\n    }\n}\n\n\n--- Patrick\n\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, S=\r\nteve Freeman &lt;smgfreeman@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Which mock framework, if any, are =\r\nyou using?

In =\r\none case I found that a class\n&gt; &gt; that had one method mocked was using the =\r\nreal method in 4.4 (which\n&gt; &gt; seems wrong) and was using the mocked method =\r\nin 4.5 (which seems  \n&gt; &gt; right).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; That is, it seems as if a bug was=\r\n fixed from 4.4 to 4.5.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I fixed that one test of ours and now I am =\r\nlooking at a few others for\n&gt; &gt; similar situations.
