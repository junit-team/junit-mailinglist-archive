A unit test might \nlook\n&gt; something like:\n&gt; \n&gt;     /**\n&gt;      * Verify accessor method(s) of mutable business object.\n&gt;      */\n&gt;     public void testMutableBusinessObject() {\n&gt; \n&gt;         ExampleBO exampleBO = new ExampleBO();\n&gt; \n&gt;         assertTrue(TestUtil.verifyAccessorMethodsForMutable\n(exampleBO));\n&gt;     }\n&gt; \n&gt; ... and TestUtil.verifyAccessorMethodsForMutable() would use \nreflection to\n&gt; &quot;discover&quot; all matching getters/setters and verify that setters \nreturn the\n&gt; &quot;same&quot; object (or primitive value) as passed to the corresponding \nsetter.\n&gt; The class would instantiate objects (or assign primitive values) \nfor\n&gt; testing.\n&gt; \n&gt; It would also be nice to have an immutable version that verified \nobjects\n&gt; were &quot;equal&quot; but not the &quot;same&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; _Marvin\n\n\n\n\n",
