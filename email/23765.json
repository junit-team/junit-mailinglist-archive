You had to already see that this is not short time to accept a new design.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I submit something, then only Kent and David are announced. I would expect that much more developers are announced as well, or even the entire group. This may speed up.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat are you suggesting to speed up the acceptance?</div>",
