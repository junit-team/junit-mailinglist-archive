My a=\r\npologies in advance if this has been hashed out before.\n\nWhile generally th=\r\ninking that its not a great idea, I occasionally\ncome into a situation wher=\r\ne I genuinely need to partition my tests\ninto more than one group or partit=\r\nion or suite.  The latest example is\nwith a client who has many unit style =\r\ntests as well as a number of\ntests which require specific network connectiv=\r\nity only available from\na subset of machines (the outgoing requests must co=\r\nme from a specific\nip address).  We call these the &quot;online tests&quot;.\n\nWe want=\r\n to be able to group our tests into two groups, &quot;unit tests&quot;\nand &quot;online te=\r\nsts&quot;.  In some case we want to run only &quot;unit tests&quot; or\nonly &quot;online tests&quot;=\r\n, and in other cases we want to run both (or all).\n\nI understand that this =\r\nfunctionality is available using JUnit 4&#39;s\n@RunWith(Suite.class) and @Suite=\r\nClasses(TestClass1.class, ...). \nHowever, manually adding test classes to a=\r\n suite is clunky because the\nlist of  test classes becomes huge.  It&#39;s also=\r\n error prone; it&#39;s easy\nfor developers to write a test but forget to add it=\r\n to @SuiteClass. \nLastly, test runners will run test in suites multiple tim=\r\nes when told\nto &quot;run all tests&quot;.  That&#39;s hardly the desired behavior.\n\nWhat=\r\n I really would like to see is the concept of suite (or group in\nTestNG ter=\r\nms) be promoted to a first class citizen.  Honestly, I think\n I would prefe=\r\nr it to be at the test class level (unlike TestNG which\nis at the test meth=\r\nod level), since the mechanism should be used for\nhigh-level organization I=\r\nMHO.\n\nIs there any chance something like this might make its way into JUnit=\r\n?\nWhat can I do to help?\n\nThanks,\nChristian\n\n\n",
