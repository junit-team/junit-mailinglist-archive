B. Rainsbergerwrote:\n&gt; Do I understand correctly?\n\nNot completely, but that is just because you have to deal with the \ninformation I give to you :-). I think that your questions are \njustified given the available info. \n\n&gt; You appear to be using the TestCase object to create test cases \nthat\n&gt; will be executed by something else. This is not what JUnit was \ndesigned\n&gt; for, so I am confused why you are doing things this way.\n\nThe testcases are still able to run in the JUnit testrunner. I \ndidn&#39;t change anything of that. It just plugs in new assertStuff() \nmethods necessary for our testcases, like the assertion that some \naudit-log record has been written, or that some errorcode has been \nset after three times a time-out at a menu. But that&#39;s getting too \ndeep. (The testcases are run using ant, though).\n \n&gt; Why are you writing XML tags at all?\n\nThe asserts, dial commands, and other checks, and some of the \nfunctional loggings are written to one single logfile for the \ntestcases to be debugged. So the xml-file will look after \ntransformation with a stylesheet to something like this:\n\n    dial 1234567890\n    assert that the status connected has been reached within 5 \nseconds\n        phone has remote ringing\n        phone has connected\n    assert that voicesegment WELKOM.wav is played within 5 seconds\n        audit record 21004 has been written\n        config parameter OPENINGHOURS_OPEN is 09:00\n        config parameter OPENINGHOURS_CLOSE is 21:00\n        voicesegment WELKOM.wav is played\n    waiting for OTHERCHOICES.wav to be played within 1 seconds\n        voicesegment MAINMENU.wav is played\n        voicesegment CHOICE1.wav is played\n        failed test &#39;menu choice 1&#39;: OTHERCHOICES.wav was not played \nwithin 1 seconds, last voicesegment played is CHOICE1.wav\n\n&gt; Reading more, you appear to be doing logging in the test case. Why \nare\n&gt; you not doing this logging in something like a test runner?\n\nThe logging is done in the asserts, so that we can track which tests \nhave succeeded, and how the flow of the program has passed. This way \nwe don&#39;t have to have the source of the testcase directly available \nwhen we are looking at the test reports. Because my project manager\n(!) is also defining and debugging the tests he has written (he \nsometimes makes mistakes, just as the hardcore programmers do), the \nlog has to be readable for mere mortals. Hence the XML -&gt; html.\n\nFurthermore, the environment is asynchronous in nature: the test \napplication and the IVR application run in different threads, \npossibly in different JVM&#39;s, or even machines. Therefore all the \nassert&#39;s have a time-out. Therefore the logging is essential for \nseeing the timing aspects: sometimes the time-out is set too small \nfor the application to perform it&#39;s actions. Then it is very handy \nto have the log displaying when the time-out occurred and where the \napplication was.\n\nHope this eleviates some of your concerns :-)\n\nWith regards,\n\nMartijn Dashorst\n\n\n",
