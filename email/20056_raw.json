Thanks for taking the first\n&gt; steps.\n\nHi Joel, =\r\nthank you for taking the time to try Crap4j and for having\nthe courage to p=\r\nresent it to your colleagues despite its provocative\nname :-).\n\nWe fully ex=\r\npect the metric and the formula to change and evolve as\npeople use it and g=\r\nain experience with it. As you recognized, this is\njust the first step.\n\n&gt; =\r\nOne question which I&#39;ve heard multiple times is, &quot;Now what?&quot; I think\n&gt; it w=\r\nould be great if the web site had content (even if wiki-mediated)\n&gt; describ=\r\ning common patterns / code structures which cause a high\n&gt; C.R.A.P. index a=\r\nnd suggestions for corrective action. Many of my\n&gt; co-workers don&#39;t spend t=\r\nheir days thinking about cyclomatic complexity\n&gt; and don&#39;t want to start by=\r\n reading up on graph theory. Ergo a few\n&gt; &quot;case study&quot; examples would be he=\r\nlpful, showing before-and-after code\n&gt; where C.R.A.P. index drops and the r=\r\nesulting code is clearly more\n&gt; maintainable.\n\nThank you for taking us to t=\r\nask on this one. Once I get done with my\nofficial responsibilities at work =\r\nthis week, I&#39;ll take some time to\nwrite an FAQ for the tool.  In the meanti=\r\nme, I think that explaining\ncyclomatic complexity as &quot;too may ifs or loops&quot;=\r\n in a single method\nmight do the job.\n\n&gt; Finally, I&#39;d really like to be abl=\r\ne to get more information on how the\n&gt; testing measurement is derived (and =\r\nthe resulting side-effects). In\n&gt; one project with lots of unit tests, incl=\r\nuding some which persisted\n&gt; results to disk, the output directories were l=\r\neft in a state I did not\n&gt; expect/understand. \n\nThe only &#39;side effect&#39; shou=\r\nld be a directory/subdirectory containing\ncode coverage and complexity data=\r\n + the files for the report\n(including an index.html).  You should be able =\r\nto remove them anytime\nfrom Eclipse.\n\n&gt;Knowing some of the basics here woul=\r\nd be helpful to\n&gt; someone who wants to take effective action as a result of=\r\n the\n&gt;reported index.\n\nWe are planning a quick web demo to show how to inst=\r\nall and run\nCrap4j, how to analyze the results and how to improve then.  I =\r\nplan to\nhave it before Thanksgiving.\n\n&gt; Again, thanks for your work on the =\r\ntool. I hope to see more from it.\n\nThanks again for your for the feedback.\n=\r\n\nAlberto\n\n\n\n\n",
