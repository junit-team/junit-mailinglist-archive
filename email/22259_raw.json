Isn&#39;t removing tedium =\r\nwhy we have\n&gt;&gt; computers in the first place?\n&gt;\n&gt; As far as I know, coverage=\r\n tools deal well with direct dependencies\n&gt; but not with logical (interpret=\r\nive) dependency.\n&gt;\n&gt; For example, if we have\n&gt;\n&gt; =A0Test A --&gt; SUT A --&gt; SU=\r\nT B\n&gt; =A0Test B --&gt; SUT B\n&gt;\n&gt; Even in this simple case, coverage analysis w=\r\non&#39;t tell us anything\n&gt; about the relationship between A and B, although we=\r\n could make some\n&gt; deductions by examining the results.\n&gt;\n&gt; If there were s=\r\nome way to tell the framework &quot;Test A depends\n&gt; on functionality, which is =\r\ntested directly by B&quot; then I can\n&gt; imagine several good outcomes:\n&gt;\n&gt; 1) Th=\r\ne test result output could be made much clearer - by\n&gt; emphasizing the B re=\r\nsult when both tests had failed. Some\n&gt; approaches I can think include subo=\r\nrdinating the A result\n&gt; to that of B, highlighting B, not showing A at all=\r\n and\n&gt; marking A as inconclusive.\n&gt;\n&gt; 2) Users would be discouraged from se=\r\neking annotations that\n&gt; provide for direct ordering of tests or the actual=\r\n &quot;hard&quot;\n&gt; dependencies.\n&gt;\n&gt; 3) Less important, but as an optimization, the =\r\nframework\n&gt; could suppress running of A if B had already failed.\n&gt;\n&gt; Charli=\r\ne\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Kent\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; On Dec 29, 2009, at 2:28 PM, Pigneri, Rocco wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; Charlie,\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;As a framework author, I can see that allowing the us=\r\ner to specify\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;ordering is a simpler implementation. But I think it&#39;s =\r\nmore\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;interesting to imagine the user specifying the nature of the\n&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;dependencies and allowing the framework to figure out a strategy.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; I am very much with you on this one. In my experience,\n&gt;&gt; there have be=\r\nen a lot of times when functions under test\n&gt;&gt; within the same class depend=\r\n upon each other, and it would\n&gt;&gt; have been great to have the test harness =\r\nknow that\n&gt;&gt; information. When I was refactoring code for a new framework\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; package, I would have loved to have the UI to display\n&gt;&gt; non-dependent te=\r\nsts first as it would have shown me very\n&gt;&gt; clearly the source of the probl=\r\nem.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Specifying only the relationships in code and leaving the\n&gt;&gt; =\r\ndisplay strategy to the test harness would allow more\n&gt;&gt; flexible display a=\r\nnd execution of these tests based upon the\n&gt;&gt; user&#39;s goals rather than upon=\r\n the dependencies themselves. I\n&gt;&gt; could imagine myself asking the UI only =\r\nto display the least\n&gt;&gt; dependent functions&#39; errors and to hide all other e=\r\nrrors for\n&gt;&gt; quick debugging on sweeping optimizations. I could also want\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; to see the dependent tests in a tree in case I am changing a\n&gt;&gt; single cl=\r\nass and want to understand the effects of what I am\n&gt;&gt; touching. I could al=\r\nso want to see all tests in a single list\n&gt;&gt; with the least dependent at th=\r\ne top and the most dependent on\n&gt;&gt; the bottom when running regression tests=\r\n. As you can see, the\n&gt;&gt; chosen view depends more upon what I am doing than=\r\n upon the\n&gt;&gt; test dependencies themselves.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Finally, being able to=\r\n list dependencies between test\n&gt;&gt; classes in addition to test cases would =\r\nalso JUnit to report\n&gt;&gt; which components of the system depend upon each oth=\r\ner. This\n&gt;&gt; simple extension would greatly increase the power of the\n&gt;&gt; dep=\r\nendency models for larger systems (particularly regression tests).\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; Thank you,\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Rocco\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; From: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:=\r\njunit@yahoogroups.com]\n&gt;&gt; On Behalf\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Of Charlie Poole\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Sent: Thursd=\r\nay, December 24, 2009 12:09 AM\n&gt;&gt; &gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Subject:=\r\n RE: [junit] Order of execution for tests\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Hi C=E9dric,\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; On another list, I identified the same variations of dependency\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; but with the variation that for case 1. We might run B\n&gt;&gt; anyway but\n&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; could highlight the error in A in some way. That\n&gt;&gt; approach doesn&#39;t\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; require ordering the tests in any particular way, which\n&gt;&gt; has some=\r\n advantages.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It still promotes developer efficiency while not worr=\r\nying about\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; execution efficiency.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, we ca=\r\nll these &quot;soft dependencies&quot;.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; If &quot;b&quot; has a hard dependency on=\r\n &quot;a&quot; and &quot;a&quot; fails, &quot;a&quot; will be\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; marked &quot;FAILED&quot; and b &quot;SKIPPED&quot;.\n&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; If &quot;b&quot; has a soft dependency on &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot; will still run\n&gt;&gt; even =\r\nif &quot;a&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; fails but a warning could be displayed in the log.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\nThis is an implementation-based view of the tests: i.e. they will\n&gt;&gt; &gt; eith=\r\ner be run or not run.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; The distinction I was trying to make - and =\r\nI think David as\n&gt;&gt; well - is\n&gt;&gt; &gt; based on the cause and nature of the dep=\r\nendency.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; For the sake of argument, I&#39;ll try to redefine what you&#39;re ca=\r\nlling\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Hard and Soft along those lines.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Hard: Test A does som=\r\nething (sets state) upon which B depends.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; For example, A may write to =\r\na data store and B might try to\n&gt;&gt; read the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; information back. Or A mig=\r\nht create a complex object and B\n&gt;&gt; might try\n&gt;&gt; &gt; to call a method on that=\r\n object. If we allow this sort of\n&gt;&gt; thing, then\n&gt;&gt; &gt; there is no choice bu=\r\nt to run A first and it makes sense to\n&gt;&gt; not run B\n&gt;&gt; &gt; at all if A fails.=\r\n However, I would not want a unit test\n&gt;&gt; framework to\n&gt;&gt; &gt; allow it.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Soft: Test A tests some functionality upon which some other\n&gt;&gt; &gt; funct=\r\nionality, tested by B, depends. Therefore, if test A\n&gt;&gt; fails, Test\n&gt;&gt; &gt; B =\r\nwill either fail as well or be inconclusive, so nothing\n&gt;&gt; further can\n&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n be learned from test B. In this case, a testing framework could\n&gt;&gt; &gt; respo=\r\nnd in a number of ways to the dependency:\n&gt;&gt; &gt; 1) Run the tests in order, s=\r\nkipping B if A fails.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; 2) Run the tests in an arbitrary order, but skip=\r\n B if A already ran\n&gt;&gt; &gt; and failed.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; 3) Run the tests in an arbitrary =\r\norder, not skipping any of\n&gt;&gt; them but\n&gt;&gt; &gt; organize reporting in such a wa=\r\ny that a failure of A takes\n&gt;&gt; precedence\n&gt;&gt; &gt; over a failure of B.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; As a framework author, I can see that allowing the user to specify\n&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\nordering is a simpler implementation. But I think it&#39;s more\n&gt;&gt; &gt; interestin=\r\ng to imagine the user specifying the nature of the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; dependencies and al=\r\nlowing the framework to figure out a strategy.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Charlie\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Every time we have discussed this potential feature for\n&gt;&gt; TestNG, the\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; discussion ended up being non conclusive on the real interest and\n&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; the existing ability to mark certain methods as\n&gt;&gt; &quot;alwaysRun&quot; already\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fills a big part of this scenario, so I always ended up\n&gt;&gt; punting on=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; it, but I&#39;d be happy to hear if someone can come up with\n&gt;&gt; a good =\r\nuse\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; case for soft dependencies...\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; --\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; ***C=E9dri=\r\nc\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; *\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have bee=\r\nn removed]\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; ------------------------------------=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Yahoo!
