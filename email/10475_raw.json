It seems some binary objects have been checked\nin as text -- so GIF&#39;s are damaged in the documentation, and the\npowerpoint tutorial is unreadable.  I&#39;m excited about using these\ntools for unit testing the gui elements of my project -- so I&#39;m\ninterested in the results of your own investigations.\n\n     Harold Shinsato\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, Timothy Wall &lt;twall@o...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Do you want to functional/acceptance-test your application, test the \n&gt; GUI, or test your application through your GUI (if the latter, I doubt \n&gt; too many people will want to help you down that path)?\n&gt; \n&gt; The toolkits you mentioned are all free, so why don&#39;t you invest a \n&gt; little time and determine which works best for you?\n&gt; \n&gt; On Feb 2, 2004, at 11:05 AM, Patricia Watt wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hi,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve been asked to find a capture/playback GUI testing tool to use \n&gt; &gt; initially on one of our products that is a stand-alone workbench type \n&gt; &gt; application that does a lot of database operations and has a\ncanvas to \n&gt; &gt; allow users to add and manipulate data.  Ideally we&#39;d be able to run \n&gt; &gt; the tests as JUnit tests and initiate them from our Ant build files.  \n&gt; &gt; Unfortunately no standard JUnit tests were written for the\napplication \n&gt; &gt; yet.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve been checking out the frameworks/modules listed on junit.org \n&gt; &gt; under Extensions/GUI Tools (Jacareto, Abbot, Marathon, etc.).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m wondering if people have any experience with these tools (or any \n&gt; &gt; others) and if they can recommend one for the type of application\nthat \n&gt; &gt; we&#39;ll be testing.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks in advance for any help.\n&gt; &gt; Tricia Watt\n\n\n\n",
