We were running<br/>\nthrough JBuilder with its J2ME environment set up to let us run there there.<br/>\nThe turnaround time for tests was sufficiently short that we were able to<br/>\nrun our tests very often like this.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only thing that didn&#39;t work for us was the concept of a suite of suites.<br/>\nWe had several different tests suites defined, but we couldn&#39;t get J2MEUnit<br/>\nto run all of the tests. It would only run those tests that were in the<br/>\nfirst suite that it found.<br/>\n<br/>\nbab<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Jeremy Thornton&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jeremy@...\">jeremy@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, March 04, 2002 3:10 AM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [junit] J2me Unit<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve got it running, let me know of any specific queries or sticking<br/>\npoints,<br/>\n&gt; What I have found is that because it runs as a midlet (i.e. on a real<br/>\ndevice<br/>\n&gt; or an emulator) I don&#39;t find it very useful for running frequent tests.<br/>\n&gt; I have a hunch that compiling a CLDC/MIDP environment on my normal<br/>\n&gt; development machine would provide a more useful framework for running<br/>\ntests<br/>\n&gt; than running j2meUnit under the sun wireless toolkit.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anybody else had much success with j2me testing ?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; J.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: don_quixada [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:xanthus@...\">xanthus@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: 01 March 2002 18:31<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: [junit] J2me Unit<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Has anyone been able to get J2meUnit working and testing midlets?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If so, please offer your advice!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; thanks,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; dq<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
