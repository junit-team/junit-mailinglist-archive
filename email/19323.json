(Also: What does it mean to author them? Do you<br/>\nmean write?)<br/>\n&lt;mdt&gt; Is there a recommendation for a better term (than &quot;hard-coded&quot;) to<br/>\ndescribe unit tests only useful in a single context?  (ex. non-generalizable<br/>\ntest, explicit-method test)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe text has been revised including parenthetical notation:<br/>\nWriting hard-coded (single context) tests leads to ... blah blah<br/>\n&lt;/mdt&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy is the volume of test code a challenge?<br/>\n&lt;mdt&gt; Ahh ... this question has significant significance.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n3,000 mm of seasonal rainfall would create havoc for a Kansas (USA) farmer,<br/>\nyet the same volume works well for the rice-growing regions of Maharashtra<br/>\n(India).  So, is 3,000 mm of rain a &quot;problem&quot;???<br/>\n<br/>\nMy personal usage (pattern) of the &quot;J2EE Core Patterns&quot; begins with problem<br/>\nperception; if a circumstance is perceived as a problem - the pattern is a<br/>\nproposed solution.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy observation is that folks concerned about the &quot;volume&quot; of test code are<br/>\ntranslating the observation into &quot;complexity&quot;, &quot;cost&quot;, &quot;management<br/>\nchallenge&quot; or perhaps general &quot;fear uncertainty and doubt&quot; (FUD) that this<br/>\nTest Driven Development stuff is somehow just another veiled strategy for IT<br/>\nto &quot;stick-it&quot; to the business community (remember Y2K -or- Client-Server<br/>\nComputing  -or- EJB 1.0?).<br/>\n&lt;/mdt&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\nSame for effort -- why do you relate the effort on test code to the effort <br/>\non production code? Effort on test code pays back in less defects and <br/>\nclearer design and other things. Would you also complain about spending <br/>\nmore effort on e.g. design or documentation than on production code?<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;mdt&gt; Actually, I do complain when documentation effort exceeds product<br/>\neffort; it is a Project Management &quot;smell&quot; that priorities are misaligned. <br/>\nDocumentation exists to expedite getting code in production - it should be<br/>\n&quot;just enough&quot; to add velocity to the process.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe TDD community needs to remain vigilant against zealots among us that<br/>\nforget the practice exists for &quot;expediting&quot; (good design, defect<br/>\nidentification etc. etc.) ... not as an end to itself.  AMT addresses those<br/>\nthat perceive the TDD exercise is creating more &quot;effort&quot; than return on<br/>\ninvestment.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf one is content with current TDD practices and determines additional<br/>\noptimization provides limited value - there is no need to pursue AMT. <br/>\n&lt;/mdt&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is the complexity in launching unit tests?<br/>\n&lt;mdt&gt; Good catch!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe text now reads:<br/>\nYou want to lower the complexity threshold so developers self-select to<br/>\nauthor unit tests.<br/>\n&lt;/mdt&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat are patterned objects?<br/>\n&lt;mdt&gt;Objects that follow a pattern - not merely the language syntax.  Is<br/>\nthere a better way to express this?  (examples = Business Objects,<br/>\nApplication Service Objects, Front Controller Objects etc.)<br/>\n&lt;/mdt&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat are unique test maintenance points?<br/>\n&lt;mdt&gt;Does this work better?<br/>\n<br/>\n* Increases method reuse within the test code base.<br/>\n&lt;/mdt&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy is it a good thing if the &quot;need for a shared understanding of <br/>\npatterned object implementation definitions&quot; (whatever that is) is <br/>\nincreased?<br/>\n&lt;mdt&gt; The &quot;J2EE Core Patterns&quot; format lists &#39;Side Effect&#39; as neither good or<br/>\nbad ... actually, this is a &quot;caution&quot; for those using AMT the first time.<br/>\n<br/>\nText changed to:<br/>\n* Increases the need for a consistent and detailed understanding of pattern<br/>\ndefinitions among team members.<br/>\n&lt;/mdt&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSure one can reflectively gather all setters and getters and call them.<br/>\nHowever, what is really gained from that?<br/>\n&lt;mdt&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://gtcgroup.com/util/TestUtil.By.Example.html\">http://gtcgroup.com/util/TestUtil.By.Example.html</a> &lt;/mdt&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I cannot imagine how this should work for anything serious.<br/>\n&lt;mdt&gt;  This is a real dilemma for me in explaining AMT.  I use the<br/>\ngetter/setter firing as an example since most folks understand the JavaBean<br/>\nspecification.  At Ford Motor Company, one of our higher-order AMT base test<br/>\ncase methods  enabled firing all CRUD operations against a DAO with a single<br/>\nline of test code.  The generalized test code managed transactions, verified<br/>\nif the record existed, created Business Objects as required,<br/>\ncreated/committed a new record, modified and then deleted the record etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe I&#39;m being lazy and not articulating the full potential of AMT by using<br/>\nonly the TestUtil reference implementation as an example?  The AMT work done<br/>\nat Ford is *not* public; however, the SOAj project will have additional<br/>\nexamples and higher order AMT - by the August timeframe.    <br/>\n&lt;/amt&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nLast but not least I don&#39;t see why you call this a pattern. It does not <br/>\nseem to share a lot with patterns as described by Gamma et al -- your AMT <br/>\ndoes not even involve code, besides naming conventions?<br/>\n&lt;mdt&gt;It appears the Wikipedia definition speaks to the notion that a &quot;set of<br/>\nrules&quot; can be enough to constitute a &quot;pattern&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern</a><br/>\n&lt;/mdt&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry, I don&#39;t see how this &quot;pattern&quot; is useful at all.<br/>\n&lt;mdt&gt; Appreciate the candor ... sounds like I need to keep working toward<br/>\narticulating a compelling case for individuals to give it a try before<br/>\nmaking a final determination.&lt;/mdt&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\nRobert<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nView this message in context: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nabble.com/Automated-Method-Testing-%28AMT%29-Pattern-tf3669566.html#a10321160\">http://www.nabble.com/Automated-Method-Testing-%28AMT%29-Pattern-tf3669566.html#a10321160</a><br/>\nSent from the JUnit - User mailing list archive at Nabble.com. </span></blockquote></div>",
