So it<br/>\n&gt; might be more something like acceptance tests. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What are you writing the tests for? Do you want to check wether the system <br/>\nworks or do you want to be able to refactor without fear of breaking <br/>\nthings?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d usually write tests for such a system on-demand. Only when a <br/>\ncode-change is needed or a bug found will I write a test. Large-scale <br/>\ntest-writing &quot;because we should&quot; is not worth it IMHO.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Since we still have to exactly figure out what we want to test, I<br/>\n&gt; would appreciate some information about whether or not JUnit is the<br/>\n&gt; right choice in general (alternatives?) and some advices for my &quot;test<br/>\n&gt; last&quot; approach. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve been using JUnit in a similar situation (I maintain/extend a <br/>\nframework that was built without any UnitTests) and I&#39;ve successfully used <br/>\nJUnit for not-quite-unit Tests. Other tools have been suggested <br/>\n(Fit/Fitnesse come to my mind) but I&#39;ve not seen anything yet that makes <br/>\nit worth to convert the 150+ Tests that exist.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Thanks in advance,<br/>\n&gt; Thomas<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
