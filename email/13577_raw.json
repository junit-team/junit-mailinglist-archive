This \ncourse will be taught in a variety of formats and lengths ranging from \n90-minute seminar to one or two day hands on tutorial to a traditional \nuniversity setting. Obviously how much I can cover and how deep I can go \nwill vary depending on format, length, and audience level.\n\nI&#39;m wondering if anyone has any good ideas for examples to use in this \ncourse? Ideally I&#39;d like something that&#39;s simple enough to do in a day, \nbut still gives attendees a feeling that they&#39;ve developed something \nreal. I could possibly do something involving the Mandelbrot set or \ncellular automata. However, I&#39;d prefer something a little less \nmathematical if possible.\n\nI&#39;d like it to have a GUI component, but at the same time I&#39;d like that \nto show up fairly late in the application, and for the application to \nstill make sense if there&#39;s not time to cover testing GUIs.\n\nIt should be possible to develop this program on a laptop not connected \nto the Internet. i.e. no databases access, network communications, web \nservices, the U.S. tax code, and so forth.\n\nStudents will have a wide variety of backgrounds so I want to avoid any \nspecial knowledge of subjects like XML processing, financial \nderivatives, quantum physics, and so forth. I should be able to cover \nthe background necessary to start writing the program in 10 minutes or \nless.\n\nAny ideas?\n\n-- \nElliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nXML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim\n\n\n\nYahoo!
