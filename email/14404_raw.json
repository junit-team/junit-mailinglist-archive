I was thinking of modifying XMLJunitResultFormatter to do the job, since the generation of XML files is done using it. I will try out the option that you have suggested.\n-Suganya \n \n\n\nJames Abley &lt;james.abley@...&gt; wrote:\nOn 19/08/05, suganya s &lt;sugu_subramanian2581@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt;  Hi,\n&gt; \n&gt; The JUnit reports that I have been able to generate so\n&gt; far contain all test methods of testcases added on to\n&gt; the TestSuite displayed on the same page. i. e, Say If\n&gt; test1A(), test2A() methods belong to testcase A and\n&gt; test1B() and test2B() methods belong to testcase B.\n&gt; Now if I add testcases A and B to SampleTestSuite,\n&gt; then when I click on the link to SampleTestSuite, it\n&gt; displays test1A(), test2A(), test1B() and test2B(). Is\n&gt; there a way that I can get JUnit reports such that\n&gt; when I click on SampleTestSuite, I get the Link to\n&gt; testcases A and B, which in turn leads me to the\n&gt; results of test methods belonging to the corresponding\n&gt; testcases.\n&gt; \n&gt; This way I can easily partition the results of\n&gt; different testcases added onto a given testsuite.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Suganya Subramanian\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ____________________________________________________\n&gt; \n\nThough not stated, I&#39;m guessing you&#39;re using the ANT junit and junitreport \ntasks. This has been discussed previously on the ant-user list.\n\nhttp://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=ant-user&m=110294136915617&w=2\n\nThe short answer is that it isn&#39;t supported. The longer answer is that you \ncan roll your own version, but you might need to patch junit to do it.\n\nA sample patch to get you started is\nhere&lt;http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1114925&group_id=15278&atid=315278&gt;.\nIt was sufficient for my purposes at the time, but I eventually figured out \na way to do it using vanilla junit 3.8.1 and using a more complex TestRunner \nin my ANT task.\n\nI unfortunately can&#39;t include the ANT task - it&#39;s proprietary to my company \nfor the foreseeable time, but it was pretty straightforward to create a new \ntask and a custom formatter. From what I remember, the nasty part was the \nXSLT to produce the html from the new hierarchical result xml.\n\nFeel free to contact me off the list if you have any specific questions \nabout how to proceed further.\n\nJames\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n---------------------------------\nYAHOO!
