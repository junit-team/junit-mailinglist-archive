Some questions spring to mind:\n&gt;\n&gt;When should each be done?\n&gt;What you are trying to achieve with each?\n&gt;What asumptions you can make with each?\n&gt;\n&gt;Thanks\n&gt;\n&gt;-----Original Message-----\n&gt;From: nsparis [mailto:nathan_paris@...]\n&gt;Sent: 13 November 2002 15:56\n&gt;To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;Subject: [junit] Re: Best approach for Unit testing asynch responses?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;You are referring to what I am doing as an &quot;integration&quot; test.  Do \n&gt;you think this is no longer a unit test when I start making sure that \n&gt;the messenger is respondeing correctly when something is added?  \n&gt;\n&gt;Should the unit test only make sure that the addMessage() method is \n&gt;working (I.e. it received the message), and the integration test \n&gt;should then make sure that when a certain message is added it \n&gt;recieves the correct response message via the listener?\n&gt;\n&gt;Thanks\n&gt;\n&gt;--- In junit@y..., &quot;Michael Rettig&quot; &lt;mrettig@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt;&gt; From: Mike Clark &lt;mike@c...&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;I have already implemented this with JUnit by making the \n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;TestMessenger TestCase a MessengerLister.  After I add a message \n&gt;I \n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;sleep until a response is supplied. I then wake up (or time out \n&gt;for \n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;failure) and test if this is the correct response to assert if \n&gt;the \n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;test failed or passed. \n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; \n&gt;&gt; &gt; Sounds like a reasonable integration test.  That&#39;s generally the \n&gt;&gt; &gt; approach I take when faced with testing asynchronous messaging \n&gt;end-to-end.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; \n&gt;&gt; &gt; Mike\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Also, you can look at mocking your messenger layer. Whenever, I&#39;ve \n&gt;done asynch testing, I found a way to make the testing synchronouse \n&gt;using a mock layer. This was ideal for simulating odd messaging \n&gt;behavior that could not be easily replicated asynchronously.  \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Mike Rettig\n&gt;&gt; -- \n&gt;&gt; __________________________________________________________\n&gt;&gt; Sign-up for your own FREE Personalized E-mail at Mail.com\n&gt;&gt; http://www.mail.com/?sr=signup\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Single & ready to mingle? lavalife.com:  Where singles click.
