If you really want to know the answer, look at<br/>\nthe source or trace through test execution with a debugger. There&#39;s not<br/>\nvery much code there so it wouldn&#39;t take more than 30 minutes to have<br/>\nintimate knowledge of the whole thing.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It seems that if a value is returned from a <br/>\n&gt; testXXXXX method, it is not included. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Is there a hard reason why? (ie would it break junit to allow test <br/>\n&gt; methods which return values <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>One reason not to do that is that supporting (utility, etc.) methods<br/>\nmight be interpreted as test methods. You&#39;d have to make sure they never<br/>\nstart with &#39;test&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; or is it just a convention to make the <br/>\n&gt; introspection easier?)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Probably. The originators might have thought of some other reason as<br/>\nwell.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; I would like to write test methods that I can reuse outside of junit, <br/>\n&gt; where I would want to inspect the result of the test. Right now I&#39;m <br/>\n&gt; faced with writing the methods twice.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Write those methods as you&#39;d like to and then just &#39;publish&#39; them for<br/>\nJUnit&#39;s consumption with JUnit style test methods that just wrapper/call<br/>\nthem.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----------------------------<br/>\nMike Silverstein<br/>\nSilverMark, Inc.<br/>\nThe Object Testing Company<br/>\nwww.javatesting.com<br/>\n**********************************<br/>\n* Providers of &quot;Test Mentor&quot;     *<br/>\n* and &quot;Enhanced JUnit&quot; Java      *<br/>\n* component testing tools        *<br/>\n**********************************<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\nOutgoing mail is certified Virus Free.<br/>\nChecked by AVG anti-virus system (http://www.grisoft.com).<br/>\nVersion: 6.0.489 / Virus Database: 288 - Release Date: 6/10/2003</div>",
