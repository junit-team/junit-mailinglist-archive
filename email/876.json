The test writer could somehow specify a &quot;level&quot; for each <br/>\n&gt; test (basic, mid, complex). That could be totally optionnal and thus not <br/>\n&gt; change the current API. That would be *just a hint* from the test writer to <br/>\n&gt; the person running the tests saying &quot;hey, look there first&quot;.<br/>\n <br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve been relying upon the undocumented behavior in JUnit&#39;s reflection support.<br/>\nReflection seems to return methods based on their order within the class file,<br/>\nand JUnit&#39;s Result stores failures in a vector.  Vector&#39;s elements() method<br/>\nis documented as returning the contents in vector order.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, basically, I write my tests in order, simplest first, most complex last,<br/>\nand it comes out in the right order if I use have JUnit use reflection to<br/>\nidentify the test methods.<br/>\n<br/>\nNaturally, if Kent or Erich change the Result class, I&#39;m hosed.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you wanted to do this &quot;right&quot;, you could extend TestRunner and replace<br/>\nprintFailures() with a version which sorts the enumeration based on whatever<br/>\ncriteria you like.  Method name comes to mind as something easy to use.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Personnally I&#39;m not even sure it&#39;s worth it, but I wanted to share that idea <br/>\n&gt; with people on the list.<br/>\n <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Oh, I think it&#39;s worth it.  The last time I brought it up I got flamed. :p<br/>\nI hope you fare better than I did.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJoi Ellis                    Software Engineer<br/>\nAravox Technologies          <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:joi@...\">joi@...</a>, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:gyles19@...\">gyles19@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\nNo matter what we think of Linux versus FreeBSD, etc., the one thing I<br/>\nreally like about Linux is that it has Microsoft worried.
