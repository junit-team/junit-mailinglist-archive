Are these all hand-coded?  Are these organizations \nattempting to achieve (and report) near-100% code coverage?\n\nOrganizations that *do not* attempt testing these methods: How do\nthey report their code coverage? For instance, do they &quot;back-out&quot;\nthe amount of code represented by getters/setters and then report the\npercentage of remaining code covered? Or - do they lower the goal to\nsomething considerably less than 100%?\n\nIs anyone actually striving for (and reporting metrics toward) near-\n100% code coverage?\n\n_Marvin\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, Elliotte Harold &lt;elharo@m...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; y153446 wrote:\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m interested in best practices around automated unit testing \nof \n&gt; &gt; getters and setters for organizations striving for near-100% \ncode \n&gt; &gt; coverage.\n&gt; &gt; Is anyone actually striving for near-100% code coverage?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Yes. Getters and setters are easy to test. Test them! You&#39;ll be \n&gt; surprised how many bugs you&#39;ll find in methods that are supposedly \ntoo \n&gt; simple to fail.\n&gt; \n&gt; There are a few cases where you really can&#39;t test stuff. In \nparticular \n&gt; Sometimes you just have to have unreachable code. For instance, I \n&gt; sometimes find myself implementing an interface such as \n&gt; java.util.Iterator in a private inner class. My private \nimplementation \n&gt; may never call remove() but I still need to implement that method \nanyway \n&gt; to fulfill the contract of Iterator. Normally I just make the \nmethod \n&gt; throw an exception, in case I&#39;m wrong and something does call it. \n&gt; However, there&#39;s just no way to reach it to test it (nor is there \nany \n&gt; need to do so since this code will never run.) But aside from a \nfew \n&gt; weird cases like that, all code should be tested or deleted.\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; Elliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@m...\n&gt; XML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!\n&gt; http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/\n&gt; \nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nos\nim\n\n\n\n\n\n",
