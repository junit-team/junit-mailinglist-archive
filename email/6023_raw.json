I wrote an own test \n&gt; &gt;for  each of internal functions by using MockObjects (if needed) \nbut \n&gt; &gt;should I test buildReport function? It seems to me I&#39;m just not \nable \n&gt; &gt;to.\n&gt; \n&gt; Certainly, test it. One question: where does &#39;reader&#39; come from? Is \nit\n&gt; a parameter to the constructor? If so, then you can easily mock all\n&gt; those objects.\n\nThat&#39;s the core of my question. A reader is being initialized from \ninside the function. I think that whichever decoupling of \ncomponent/classes/functions I do still at a some point one of \nfunctions has to call the decoupled parts. In the production code I \ncan&#39;t use mocks that deduces that there are functions which can&#39;t be \ntested (at least on UnitTest level). \nIn my example buildReport knows how to create and init the reader and \nit only has connecting logic (how, when and which functions to call). \nI&#39;ve tested each of them already.\n&gt; \n&gt; A question for you: how would you test it?\nI&#39;m afraid I didn&#39;t get the answer. I test with help of mocks other \nfunctions accepting other my clsses as parameters. \n\nRR\n&gt; \n&gt; J. B.
