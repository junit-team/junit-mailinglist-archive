To get a reference =\r\nto RunNotifier, you&#39;ll\n&gt; need to bypass JUnitCore and get straight to the R=\r\nunner in your custom\n&gt; main.  Take a look at JUnitCore.run(Runner) and let =\r\nme know if that&#39;s\n&gt; helpful.\n&gt; \n&gt; I assume your extension kept a persistent=\r\n list of failed tests\n&gt; somehow.  If so, you can use that in a Filter, comp=\r\naring the names of\n&gt; the failed tests to each method to decide which to run=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sounds like interesting work--let me know how it goes.

I s=\r\naw a thread here that\n&gt; &gt; showed a usage of RunNotifier.pleaseStop(), but I=\r\n couldn&#39;t find a way\n&gt; &gt; to get a RunNotifier outside of a runner.\n&gt; &gt; Is t=\r\nhere a way?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Also, it has a nice feature of resuming the last failed=\r\n test. How can\n&gt; &gt; this be done in JUnit4?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks a lot,\n&gt; &gt; Av=\r\niv.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
