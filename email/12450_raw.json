Using Spring for tests may require a different\ncontext for unit tests, perhaps.  But there&#39;s nothing wrong with manually\nsetting up your class using the new operator.  The risk is in the\nduplication (in your tests, are you setting it up exactly as Spring will?).\nI&#39;d probably start with using new, and if things start to get complex, then\nfigure out how to use Spring (which isn&#39;t that hard I believe).\n\n-Larry \n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Yagiz Erkan [mailto:yagizerkan@...] \nSent: Friday, December 10, 2004 11:50 AM\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: [junit] Testing object instantiated by Spring\n\n\nHi all,\n\nI&#39;m testing a class that Spring creates an instance for me at runtime\n(and my code is using it through the interface type) therefore I never\ndo &quot;new MyClass()&quot; in the production code. In the programmer tests,\nwould you use the same method of creating the concrete class or would\nyou call new MyClass() to keep it simple?\n\nThanks,\n\n- Yagiz Erkan -\nhttp://yagiz.blogspot.com\nhttp://www.erkans.com\n\n\n\n \nYahoo!
