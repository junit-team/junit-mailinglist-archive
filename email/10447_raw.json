I&#39;ve already written some \nHTTPUnit tests for the new system, but I&#39;d like to have both run as \nJUnit tests to take advantage of the great reporting, then tie \nthings together with ANT.\n\nI&#39;d like to have a single test method, for example testGeneric_driver\n() that calls out to the generic_driver.  Then it can call the same \nmethod mutliple times only switching the parameters (including the \ntestcase name.)\n\nCurrently, I can get the following results...\n\nName\t\t\tStatus\t\tType\t\tTime\ntestGeneric_driver() \tsuccess\ntestGeneric_driver() \tsuccess\ntestGeneric_driver() \tsuccess\ntestGeneric_driver() \tsuccess\ntestGeneric_driver() \tsuccess\n\n\nI know all the tests have run, but I&#39;d like to change the name \ndynamically...\n\nName\t\t\tStatus\t\tType\t\tTime\ncreateCustomer1.rpc \tsuccess\ncreateCustomer2.rpc \tsuccess\ncreateCustomer3.rpc\tsuccess\ncreateOrder1-1.tran \tsuccess\ncreateOrder1-1.tran \tsuccess\n\nWithin the testcase, is it possible to change the name?\n\nPublic void test testGeneric_driver() throws exception {\n\t//change name\n\n\t// call out to the other test framework\n\n\t// handle Success, Error, or Failure as appropriate based on \nthe return code\n}\n\n\nI don&#39;t want to create thousands of test methods to call out to the \nold system, but I would like to leverage the reporting in the JUnit \nframework and leverage JUnit and HTTPUnit for the newer development.\n\nHas anyone run into a similar scenario?  Any thoughts on the best \nway to change the name dynamically.\n\nThanks,\nOscar\n\n\n\n",
