Deserialization? or<br/>\n </span></blockquote>using<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  &gt;  &gt; the deserialized object? Both?<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; <br/>\n&gt;  &gt; The later (is that the right answer?) <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; If you&#39;re testing both, then test them separately. It looks like your <br/>\n&gt; deserialization headaches are affecting your ability to test using the <br/>\n&gt; deserialized object. Stop. Write some tests for<br/>\n </span></blockquote>serialization/deserialization. <br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps my post was confusing.  I *have* a seperate set of<br/>\nserialisation/deserialisation tests that have nothing to do with the tests I<br/>\nmentioned in my original post.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Write some tests for using the object. <br/>\n&gt; For the &quot;using the object&quot; tests, just create the objects in memory and <br/>\n&gt; use them, rather than deseralizing them.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think this is what I am/was doing.  However (almost) all of these &quot;data<br/>\ntype&quot; objects are only &quot;constructed&quot; through the deserialisation process -<br/>\nthey don&#39;t have constructors with 20+ arguments (may be they should, or may<br/>\nbe these data objects should be refactored into smaller classes...).  So<br/>\nwhen I come to use them during testing (because the method under test uses<br/>\nthem) I have a decision to make - should I (1) fake; (2) use the<br/>\ndeserialisation process to construct a &quot;real&quot; object; or (3) add a<br/>\nconstructor that takes 20+ parameters and construct my in memory object that<br/>\nway.  So far, depending on the nature of the test I&#39;ve been doing (1) and<br/>\n(2).  It&#39;s just that recently (probably because I am lazy I don&#39;t know) I&#39;ve<br/>\nnoticed that I&#39;ve been using (2) a whole lot more.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  &gt; I have a number of deserialisation tests for those classes being<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; deserialised - so that&#39;s not what I am testing here.  I am simply using<br/>\n </span></blockquote>the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  &gt; fact that I &quot;know&quot; I have a &quot;working&quot; deserialisation process on some<br/>\n </span></blockquote>class<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  &gt; &quot;A&quot; to speed up my test creation process.  It is much easier to<br/>\n </span></blockquote>data-scrape<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  &gt; an objects serialised form from a log file and use an object<br/>\n </span></blockquote>constructed<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  &gt; from that within my test than to fake it.  <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;  Why not just create the object in memory? Why deserialize one?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Because, currently (as intimated in my previous comment) I don&#39;t have the<br/>\nability to create the object in memory as the object(s) in question only<br/>\nhave default constructors and no setters (they&#39;re immutable).  Currently the<br/>\nonly way to get a *useful* in memory object is to either (1) fake it, or (2)<br/>\nuse the object&#39;s built in deserialisation code.  The main advantage of (2)<br/>\nis it gives me a bonefide object to use with no externally built assumptions<br/>\n(other than the data from which it was &quot;constructed&quot; (deserialised) - but<br/>\nthen I&#39;d have that same problem with my 20+ argument constructor).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo my original question rephrased was: I want to depend on as little as<br/>\npossible and when I do I&#39;d prefer, where practical, to depend on &quot;real&quot;<br/>\nobjects rather than fakes, however as most of my data objects follow the<br/>\n&quot;deserialised construction idiom&quot; (I might just have made that term up) I<br/>\nwas querying whether there might be a better way of achieving this.</div>",
