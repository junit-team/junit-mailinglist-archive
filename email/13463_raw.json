If I run this test by itself,\n&gt; it&#39;s ok.\n&gt; \n&gt; I also have a class suite called AgentsTestSuite which contains the\n&gt; HouseholdTest.  If I run this test, I get errors on one or two of the\n&gt; methods; i.e rerunning the test over and over again sometimes gives\n&gt; one error and sometimes two (always on the same methods).  If I use\n&gt; Rerun failed tests - Failures first, the test is ok in all\n&gt; circumstances.\n&gt; \n&gt; AgentsTestSuite is inside another suite called ModelTest.  Running\n&gt; this throws up errors on the same methods as above, plus another in a\n&gt; different test suite (which again is ok by itself). Rerunning failed\n&gt; tests first clears one of the methods in the HouseholdTest but that&#39;s\n&gt; it.\n&gt; \n&gt; What is going on here?  I&#39;ve spent quite a while debugging it but\n&gt; can&#39;t seem to figure out where the snag is.  Has anyone else\n&gt; encountered something like this?\n\nI imagine your HouseholdTest tests use some external resource (file \nsystem, database, something). If so, then something else in your \nAgentsTestSuite is putting that external resource in a state that your \nHouseholdTest tests doesn&#39;t expect. Clean that up, if you can.\n\nIf that&#39;s not it, then I would need more specifics to get any further.\n-- \nJ. B.
