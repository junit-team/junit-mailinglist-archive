That&#39;s an important first step.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou did have a working test harness at one point, right?  How about <br/>\nstarting by fixing that?  Make whatever changes are needed to the <br/>\ncode/tests to get the existing tests to run again.  And as a matter of <br/>\npolicy, require all NEW code to have unit tests.  This won&#39;t cure the <br/>\ndisease, but it will at least stop it from getting any worse.  Then <br/>\nstart adding tests for every *bug* you find, or have already found but <br/>\nhaven&#39;t fixed yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou won&#39;t have complete coverage this way, and may never get there, but <br/>\nat least you&#39;ll be carrying forward good practices.  And if you can <br/>\ndemonstrate to management that your development is now severely slowed <br/>\nby bugs due to a lack of testing, you may be able to convince them.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n<br/>\nDavid Stagner<br/>\n<br/>\nNational Marrow Donor Program<br/>\n3001 Broadway Street NE<br/>\nBroadway Ridge Suite 500<br/>\nMinneapolis, MN  55413<br/>\n<br/>\nEmail: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dstagner@...\">dstagner@...</a></div>",
