It&#39;s worse for use, since we have\na support package named &quot;assert&quot; which all of our packages depend on, so\nwe can&#39;t just deprecate a single method.\n\nIt always amazes me when folks go through the trouble to create a nice,\nobject oriented language with hierarchical namespaces and can&#39;t figure\nout how to add a feature without modifying the syntax.\n&lt;/rant&gt;\n\nOK, I feel a little better.\n\nOn Wed, 3 Oct 2001, Green, Noah wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Preliminary research by me and co-workers indicates that Sun is adding an\n&gt; assertion facility to JDK 1.4.  If this happens the way it says in the\n&gt; documentation, &quot;assert&quot; will become a reserved keyword in the Java language.\n&gt; Here is the Sun page detailing the new assertion facility:\n&gt; http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/docs/guide/lang/assert.html\n&gt; Note that it seems this is already in the beta of JDK 1.4.\n&gt;\n&gt; The document also details ways of turning off assertions, including the fact\n&gt; that you must use a special setting at compile time in order\n&gt; for assertions to work at all:\n&gt; http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/docs/guide/lang/assert.html#compiling\n&gt;\n&gt; The question is whether not using this compile-time setting frees up the\n&gt; &quot;assert&quot; keyword for use as a method name.  My fear is that it\n&gt; does not.\n&gt;\n&gt; This could definitely cramp our style, to put it mildly.  Anyone know any\n&gt; more about this issue?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Noah Green\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Noah Green\n&gt; Software Engineering Manager\n&gt; ThinAirApps, Inc.\n&gt; (212) 343-5032\n&gt; noah.green@...\n&gt;\n&gt; This message and any appended documentation is intended only for the use of\n&gt; the intended recipient(s) and is proprietary and confidential to\n&gt; ThinAirApps, Inc. and may not be disclosed to third parties without the\n&gt; prior written permission of ThinAirApps, Inc.
