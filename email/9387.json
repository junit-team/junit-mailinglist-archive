I can see why the System.out.println() is<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; redundant here, since the assertEquals will provide the actual<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; length of the vector on failure. But generally, when and where<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; are diagnostic messages in tests appropriate? Do you have a problem<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; with System.out.println() or diagnostic messages in tests in general?<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; System.out.println got lost, assertXYZ don&#39;t.  If an assert message<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; doesn&#39;t give you enough information to debug your code, then maybe the<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; assert is not doing enough.  A least that&#39;s what I think.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What about <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://apricot.sourceforge.net/\">http://apricot.sourceforge.net/</a> ?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>RIP.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;snip /&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; My own preference is to use log4j events in tests so I can<br/>\n&gt; monitor what is going on, which is especially useful when a test<br/>\n&gt; fails. I accept that System.out is rather primitive, but if your<br/>\n&gt; test runner is able to capture the output to this stream and<br/>\n&gt; present it with the test, then it doesn&#39;t have to get lost.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If a test fails, then you are making an assumption that does not hold <br/>\ntrue, either about the test or the production code you are testing. Add <br/>\nmore assertions.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;m interested in this stuff because I&#39;m interested in the process<br/>\n&gt; different programmers choose to adopt when using JUnit. For example,<br/>\n&gt; when you write a failing test you can often get it to pass once you<br/>\n&gt; implement the functionality. Sometimes, however, the test still fails<br/>\n&gt; unexpectedly. That&#39;s why tests are so useful, they tell you you&#39;ve made<br/>\n&gt; a mistake immediately. Programmers who don&#39;t write tests would assume<br/>\n&gt; at the point of implementation that they hadn&#39;t made a mistake and<br/>\n&gt; continue with the next task.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; How do people fix such a failing test? What information do you use to<br/>\n&gt; diagnose and fix it? Or is it always the time to reach for your<br/>\n&gt; debugger?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If I cannot pass a test right away, I throw away my production code and <br/>\ntry again. If I&#39;m wrong twice in a row, I might throw the test away and <br/>\ntry to write it again. Typically (according to my experience) that&#39;s <br/>\nfaster than doing all this diagnostic stuff.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
