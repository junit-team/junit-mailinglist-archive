I do it on a regular basis ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nA runner that creates a suite from a set of names should be straightforward given you can compute the number of tests beforehand, eg. because the class can already be loaded or you know the names of test methods per class from some other source.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou might want to look at org.junit.runners.Suite for an example.<br/>\n<br/>\nJohannes<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, Miles Parker &lt;milesparker@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks Johannes,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s pretty straightforward in its own way. I need to execute an arbitrary<br/>\n&gt; set of test methods (using @test annotations) against a known -- but not yet<br/>\n&gt; existent at JUnit launch time -- set of classes. Those classes are generated<br/>\n&gt; and compiled in a previous test case within same session and then need to be<br/>\n&gt; loaded dynamically. Ideally, I would present the name of classes as Strings;<br/>\n&gt; I understand that JUnit has a way to do this dynamically for method names<br/>\n&gt; but I can&#39;t find a similar feature for class names -- everything I&#39;ve tried<br/>\n&gt; ends up forcing me to have an explicit compiled reference at test harness<br/>\n&gt; launch time.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; And of course I&#39;d really like not to have to write my own runner<br/>\n&gt; implementation. ;) In TestNG I can do this with factories but our build<br/>\n&gt; environment currently only supports JUnit.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Miles </span></blockquote></div>",
