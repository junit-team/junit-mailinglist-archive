I try to spend <br/>\nless time worrying about whether I fit global definitions of &quot;bad&quot; or <br/>\n&quot;worthless&quot;, and more time trying to get better. I think:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) There are people who would have more fun and write better software if <br/>\nthey did more developer testing. Encouraging everyone to try it is a <br/>\ngood thing. I like a Martin Fowler quote: &quot;Often when you come across <br/>\nsomething new it can be a good idea to overuse it in order to find out <br/>\nit&#39;s boundaries. This is a quite reasonable learning strategy.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n2) There are people who would have more fun and write better software if <br/>\nthey did less developer testing. Most of these people, I&#39;ll guess, have <br/>\ndeveloper testing forced on them from above. However, if there are <br/>\npeople on the list who used to be happy, gung-ho developer testers, and <br/>\nnow have seen that they were wrong, I&#39;d love to hear their stories.<br/>\n<br/>\nDavid Saff</div>",
