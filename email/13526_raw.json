B. Rainsberger\n\n&gt; I have never used TestNG; however, based on what I h=\r\nave seen, \n&gt; read and what Cedric has told me, I would use TestNG mostly \n&gt;=\r\n to add tests to Legacy Code (any code I&#39;m afraid to change) \n\nI think Test=\r\nNG&#39;s scope is broader than that.\n\nMy understanding of &quot;unit testing&quot; is tha=\r\nt it is supposed to exercise one\nclass.  Exactly one. You test the internal=\r\n, public and private methods, make\nsure it&#39;s healthy and that you didn&#39;t br=\r\neak anything at the most fundamental\nlevel.\n\nAnything including logic that =\r\ninvolves more than one class is no longer\nconsidered unit testing.  It can =\r\nbe called integration, acceptance,\nfunctional, etc...  but it&#39;s no longer u=\r\nnit testing.\n\nReal code relies on dependencies all the time:\n\n- A certain o=\r\nbject can only be created if a previous object has been created\nbefore.\n- T=\r\nhis method can only be invoked if such field has been initialized.\n- etc...=\r\n\n\nIt makes a lot of sense to me that my tests should reflect this complexit=\r\ny\nso they can run my real code.\n\nI am a firm believer that tests should be =\r\nas close as possible to production\ncode.  I don&#39;t know about you, but:\n\n- I=\r\n am nervous when I run my tests on Postgresql and the production site\nruns =\r\non Oracle.\n\n- I feel ever worse when my tests are using mocks, because not =\r\nonly are\nmocks non trivial to write (and they require you to maintain a par=\r\nallel line\nof code), they can give you a deadly sense of security.  And the=\r\nn one day,\nyour mock tests run fine but the production code breaks, and you=\r\n enter a\nworld of pain.  Trust me, it&#39;s not pretty.\n\nWith all that in mind,=\r\n it makes sense to have a testing framework that takes\ndependencies into ac=\r\ncount and makes it as easy as possible for you to:\n\n- Identify which test *=\r\nreally* broke (compare &quot;1 SUCESS 25 FAILED&quot; to &quot;1\nSUCCESS 1 FAILED and 23 S=\r\nKIPS&quot;).\n- Allow you to rerun the failed tests easily, including all the dep=\r\nendencies\nif any\n\nThese are the main features that TestNG offers (and many =\r\nmore of course\n:-)).\n\n-- \nC=E9dric\nhttp://beust.com/weblog\n \n\n\n",
