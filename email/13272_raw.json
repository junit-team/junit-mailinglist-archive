This seems like\nsimplest and most elegant solution to me.\n\nThe problem though is when a test fails, you don&#39;t get any\ninformartion about what field(s) that actually differed between the\ntwo objects. You could also implement a toString() method, but for\nlarge classes it&#39;s still quite hard see in the test output where the\nmismatch is.\n\nBecause of this I usually write a series assertEquals(a.getFoo(),\nb.getFoo()) statements in my test case instead, event though I would\nprefer the equals() way of doing it. \n\nDoes anyone have a neat solution to using the equals() method in tests\nand still get good output from the tests when something fails? \n\nRegards, Mattias\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
