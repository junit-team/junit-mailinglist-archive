So our\n&gt; customers sometimes don&#39;t want us to use an open source tool like\n&gt; junit because it isn&#39;t formally validated, e.g., doesn&#39;t have written\n&gt; requirements, traceable to design, traceable to unit and system tests,\n&gt; with the output of the tests captured.  Any suggestions for how to\n&gt; address this other than telling them that junit is so extensively used\n&gt; it must work, e.g., is there a suite of junit acceptance tests or even\n&gt; unit tests that we can run to prove that it works according to its\n&gt; specs?\n\nThis is an interesting question that you raise and while I don&#39;t have\nan answer, I do have a question.\n\nIf there was a suite of JUnit unit tests, written in JUnit, wouldn&#39;t\nthat be too recursive to be acceptable? The JUnit tests say that JUnit\nis working ... well, no kidding Sherlock! :-)\n\nSimon\n\n-- \nwww.simonpeter.org\n\n",
