I then ran into the test case that confirms that action.  Comin=\r\ng from the aspect that I want to have confidence that my code and tests are=\r\n functioning properly, I honestly think that is the wrong action.\n\nIf an as=\r\nsumption is violated then it should be either a failure or at best ignored.=\r\n  To say the test passes because something failed is like saying you don&#39;t =\r\nhave a cavity because the dentist doesn&#39;t have the right tool.  You don&#39;t k=\r\nnow one way or the other, and the test won&#39;t be able to run properly when t=\r\nhe assumption is violated.\n\nIt&#39;s partly that reason that I don&#39;t use assump=\r\ntions to begin with.  If there needs to be a certain precondition to the te=\r\nst passing, I will add those assertions before I perform the action that ne=\r\neds to be tested.  To me, it is a failure if the test could not be set up p=\r\nroperly.\n\nIf you want something a little softer, then I recommend that a fa=\r\niled assumption is equivalent to the @Ignore annotation.  You&#39;ll see in the=\r\n summary that X number of tests were run, Y number of tests ignored, and Z =\r\nnumber of tests failed.  Although, for ignored tests I&#39;d like to see what t=\r\nhe reason was (failed assumption or manually ignored through the attribute)=\r\n.\n\nMaking a test pass because of a failed assumption gives you a false sens=\r\ne of security about your code.  What is happening is that the test just was=\r\nn&#39;t run, and there may be a legitimate problem hiding.  To me that is the m=\r\nost dangerous part of that solution.  I&#39;d rather get the bad news straight =\r\nthan trust faulty information.\n\nAm I making sense?\n\n\n",
