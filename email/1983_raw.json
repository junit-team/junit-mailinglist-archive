For example, if we&#39;re talking \n    &gt; about an ordering\n    &gt; system, a specified product might exist in a number of \n    &gt; states, onhand and\n    &gt; not committed, on hand but committed, on order (imminent \n    &gt; arrival), on order\n    &gt; (protracted arrival), out of stock at the supplier (undetermined\n    &gt; availability) or perhaps even never available again.  A \n    &gt; customer wanting to\n    &gt; order that product might have patterned responses for \n    &gt; each of these states.\n    &gt; If the task at hand is to develop a system that will \n    &gt; automate the response\n    &gt; to a customer placing an order for this item, each \n    &gt; possible state and\n    &gt; outcome combination constitutes a unit.  Each test case \n    &gt; contributing its\n    &gt; behavioral rules to the design.\n\nI don&#39;t know, Jason.  It seems to me that unit is, for all intensive\npurposes, the class to be tested.  If all of these scenarios are present in\nthat one class, then they can be tested at the &quot;unit&quot; level.  If the\nscenarios are a combination of objects and their interactions, I think the\ntest raises to the &quot;acceptance&quot; level.  The thing I take issue with is your\nuse of the term &#39;scenarios&#39;, because it conjures up ATs in my mind, but that\nmay just be me.\n\nIt all comes down to what is the best way to write unit tests.  Right?\nThat&#39;s a heated discussion from which I have learned to stay away (for the\nmost part).  Everyone has their style and most are very adamant about it.\nThere are some general principles that we can all agree upon, but once that\nis done, the proofs are more or less stylistic.\n\nSome general principles can be found at\n&lt;http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-12-2000/jw-1221-junit-2.html&gt;.  I\ndon&#39;t agree with the all of the things listed there, but most of it sounds\ngood and right to me.\n\n-Jason\n\n\n",
