    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-812722025\">Thanks to Pete McInstry&#39;s help, I was able to figure out that I had<br/>\njndi.properties file on the cp that was referring to a JBOSS initial<br/>\ncontext factory.  I changed it to Weblogic and got past this one.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, now I&#39;m getting the following:<br/>\n<br/>\njavax.naming.CommunicationException [Root exception is<br/>\njava.net.ConnectException: t3://localhost:7001: Destinati<br/>\non unreachable; nested exception is:<br/>\n        java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused: connect; No<br/>\navailable router to destination]<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is the exception that I got when using ant to compile and run the<br/>\njunit test.  I started running the test from a dos prompt calling<br/>\njava, because that was how I got the ExampleServerTestCase to run. <br/>\nBut I eventually got back to this error (I guess because the other<br/>\ncode that I call is running outside the app server.)<br/>\n<br/>\nHow can I get around this?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;scohan2005&quot; &lt;scohan@g...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; I am trying to integrate ServerTestCase with pre-existing junit <br/>\n&gt; tests.  Right now, I&#39;m just trying to test back end server DAO code - <br/>\n&gt; not ejbs.  The back end code works - i&#39;m just trying to get the tests <br/>\n&gt; converted to ServerTestCases.   We&#39;ve just moved to WebLogic 7.1.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Within my test case, call it MyTestCase (that extends ServerTestCase<br/>\n&gt; ()), I have a main that instantiates MyTestCase passing <br/>\n&gt; in &quot;MyTestCase&quot;.  Before calling the method I want to test, I have to <br/>\n&gt; call a login class to set up some initial data that is required in my <br/>\n&gt; test method (i.e, login credential data).  This login class connects <br/>\n&gt; to an oracle db to get the initial data.  Before doing so, the login  <br/>\n&gt; class attempts to instantiate an InitialContext (to get a <br/>\n&gt; connection), however, &#39;new InitialContext()&#39; throws the following:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; javax.naming.NoInitialContextException: Cannot instantiate class: <br/>\n&gt; org.jnp.interfaces.NamingContextFactory [Root<br/>\n&gt; exception is java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: <br/>\n&gt; org.jnp.interfaces.NamingContextFactory]  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The login code works when called from our Struts front end, but <br/>\n&gt; throws the above exception when called from MyTestCase.  What am I <br/>\n&gt; missing as far as the InitialContext goes?  It seems that <br/>\n&gt; ServerTestCase has successfully set up its InitialConext prior to me <br/>\n&gt; calling this other class.  Shouldn&#39;t the Context then be available <br/>\n&gt; for subsequent InitialConext calls?  Obviously, this is fuzzy to me.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks. </span></blockquote></div>",
