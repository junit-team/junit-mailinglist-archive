Many people<br/>\nfind this encourages designs that have many other useful properties.<br/>\nSo, I think that few people would see using a concrete class&#39;s<br/>\nconstructor with some values set to null to have the same advantages<br/>\nas a mock object.  Myself, I find that if I&#39;m regularly using null in<br/>\nmy tests, it means I have one class doing more than one thing, and I<br/>\nlook to split it up.  Good luck,<br/>\n<br/>\n   David Saff<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Mon, Sep 27, 2010 at 5:13 AM, Konrad Reiche &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:home@...\">home@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;  Hey everyone,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have sent some questions regarding how to test methods using whole<br/>\n&gt; OR-mapped classes in a bundle. I got some very useful tips. However, I<br/>\n&gt; looked again at the mock up proposal.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My ORM classes provide a constructor which assigns every class field a<br/>\n&gt; variable. So I came to the point to use: new<br/>\n&gt; Course(2,5,0,null,null,null,null,roomList); This means I set every value<br/>\n&gt; I will not need for my test case to null.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Is this also a way to create mock up objects? Because implementing real<br/>\n&gt; mock ups with a factory method and replacing its content like its<br/>\n&gt; proposed in a paper from IBM, seems a bit overloaded if I can use the<br/>\n&gt; constructor only.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Am I on the right path?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Best regards,<br/>\n&gt; Konrad Reiche<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
