It matters when one fails.\n&gt; \n&gt; Let&#39;s say that testB uses functions that are tested in testA.\n\nLet&#39;s instead say that TestB collaborates with lightweight objects that \nprovide predictable results according to the behavior we expect of A.\n\n&gt; During development, I&#39;ll be coding testA first. When that\n&gt; passes, I&#39;ll move to testB.\n&gt; \n&gt; But tests take time. And as the number of tests grows, it\n&gt; takes longer and longer to get to the last test on the list.\n\nHow long is long? How many tests? What&#39;s your test throughput 100/s? \n200/s? Less?\n\n&gt; So testing in reverse order speeds things up during development.\n&gt; (Or simply running the last test, rather than all of them.)\n&gt; \n&gt; But when running the full suite of tests, it&#39;s helpful to\n&gt; run them in the original order -- because sometimes a regression\n&gt; causes a test to fail which was passing earlier, and it&#39;s\n&gt; good to discover such violated assumptions.\n&gt; \n&gt; So there&#39;s a tension between wanting to speed things up\n&gt; and wanting to verify that previously valid assumptions\n&gt; still hold.\n&gt; \n&gt; The only way I can see to satisfy both goals is to allow\n&gt; tests to run either from first to last, or from last to\n&gt; first.\n\nAnother option is to execute only the current suite while working on the \nbehavior under test, then execute the full suite when you think you have \nthe behavior under test working.\n\n&gt; Any other ideas?\n\nYes. Write faster tests. I usually get up to about 1500 before I start \nto notice a break in my rhythm. If I notice a break in my rhythm before \nI hit 1500 tests, then I fix the tests.\n-- \nJ. B.
