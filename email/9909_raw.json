All you\n&gt;  &gt; need are two more events, and since you can fix that in one place....\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; It&#39;s entirely possible that JUnit-addons Test Runner already does this.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Understand, I&#39;m not trying to squash your enthusiasm for AOP. You just\n&gt;  &gt; have that Golden Hammer look in your eye....\n&gt; \n&gt; Yep, this does work fine, if you don&#39;t have any fixture-setup code in your\n&gt; testcase itself.  However, many people haven&#39;t refactored all fixture \n&gt; code into\n&gt; setUp() and tearDown().  If this is the case, there could be some \n&gt; time-consuming\n&gt; fixture code in the test methods themselves.  This would mean that checking\n&gt; times after setUp() and before tearDown() would still be counting the \n&gt; fixture\n&gt; execution time in with the Class Under Test execution time.\n\nI understand... that&#39;s the fault of the programmer not using JUnit as \nexpected. If the programmer wants JUnit to report accurate times, the \nprogrammer ought to put setup code in setUp(). :)\n\n&gt; Having a listener is another viable Plain Java approach, but you would \n&gt; still\n&gt; have to manually fire the listener before and after you actual \n&gt; invocation of the\n&gt; class under test.  This is the type of non-refactorable duplication that \n&gt; AOP solves.\n\nI see... that would be nice: using AOP to instrument an event source \nwithout hardcoding when the events occur. That is neat. (I haven&#39;t \nlearned much about the practical use of AOP, as you might be able to tell.)\n\n&gt; I&#39;m not advocating AOP in all cases, in fact I think you should try hard \n&gt; to find\n&gt; a Plain Java solution that works before resorting to AOP.  I&#39;m just \n&gt; trying to\n&gt; illustrate that it could be useful in a specific scenario:  Monitoring \n&gt; execution\n&gt; time of the class under test if 1) you have fixture setup code in your test\n&gt; methods and 2) the execution time of that fixture setup code could \n&gt; obscure the\n&gt; actual execution time of the Class Under Test.\n\nI can see the general use of AOP for generating events on behalf of an \nevent source. Good idea.\n\n&gt; Most likely this isn&#39;t the situation of the original poster, so it doesn&#39;t\n&gt; matter.  We can drop this thread before people start complaining :).\n\nLet them complain. This list is such low traffic that OT stuff is not a \nproblem here. :)\n-- \nJ. B.
