It doesn&#39;t mean that it =\r\nworks.\n\nJust like having 100% coverage doesn&#39;t mean that my code works.\n\nDe=\r\nveloper tests are biased, they only cover a part of the story.  Customer\nus=\r\nage is, of course, biased as well, but it&#39;s a yardstick that&#39;s just as\nvali=\r\nd.\n\n The only way to do that is to write tests,\n\n\nYes. Well, that&#39;s one way=\r\n to prove it, there are more.\n\nand to write them *before* you write the cod=\r\ne.\n\n\nNo.\n\nWhy is test written first better than test written after?\n\nWritin=\r\ng tests after the fact is far\n&gt; less effective because the code was almost =\r\ncertainly not written to\n&gt; be testable.\n\n\nWhy?  If someone like you write t=\r\nhe code, you&#39;re going to design it to be\ntestable, aren&#39;t you?  You will be=\r\n using well-known principles such as\ninterfaces, dependency injection, avoi=\r\nding statics, methods with too many\nparameters, decoupling your classes, et=\r\nc...\n\nIt can be argued that writing test firsts can be detrimental to your\n=\r\nvelocity because it introduces churn:  you don&#39;t know yet what your final\nc=\r\node will look like, and before you reach something you&#39;re comfortable with,=\r\n\nyou might have to rewrite it two or three times.  And every time, you will=\r\n\nhave to modify these tests as well.  TDD can be a big waste of time.\n\nHere=\r\n is why.\n\nWith test first, you have something like:  Test v1, Code v1, Test=\r\n v2, Code\nv2, Test v3, Code v3.  Check in.\n\nIf you postpone your testing a =\r\nbit, you have:  Code v1, Code v2, Code v3,\nTest v3, Commit.\n\nThe latter app=\r\nroach will get you to your goal much faster.\n\nAgain, I&#39;m not saying that TD=\r\nD is bad, just that it comes at a price and\nthat this price needs to be eva=\r\nluated before *every* single project or task\nthat you undertake.\n\n-- \nC=C3=\r\n=A9dric\nhttp://testng.org\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been re=\r\nmoved]\n\n\n",
