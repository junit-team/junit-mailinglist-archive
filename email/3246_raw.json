By looking at their test code and\ncomparing it to your code (which maybe isn&#39;t working), you can get an idea\nwhere you or the vendor are making unwarranted assumptions.\n\nOn Mon, 12 Nov 2001, David Stagner wrote:\n\n&gt; &quot;Rogers, Jason&quot; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;David Stagner&quot; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; Unit tests document API usage very well, for starters.  And they\n&gt; &gt; suggest\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; where any bugs encountered might be, even by their absence (a\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; problematic condition may not be tested, and a set of tests could\n&gt; &gt; rule\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; out a bunch of possible causes for a bug).\n&gt; &gt;   &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; This seems like a pretty weak argument to me.  They only document the\n&gt; &gt; set of\n&gt; &gt; the API that the authors chose to test, and they only test to the\n&gt; &gt; authors&#39;\n&gt; &gt; degrees of comfortability.  Truth be known, just because JUnit is in use\n&gt; &gt; does\n&gt; &gt; not mean that the code is being tested thoroughly.  Right?  You may be\n&gt; &gt; right\n&gt; &gt; that it could show you what isn&#39;t tested, but not necessarily why.  And\n&gt; &gt; it only\n&gt; &gt; gives you a clue as to what is not tested and what is.  There may not be\n&gt; &gt; a one\n&gt; &gt; to one mapping of the public API to the tests.\n&gt;\n&gt; Granted.  I was assuming that the set of unit tests theoretically\n&gt; provided by our imaginary vendor (has anyone ever seen a non-open source\n&gt; vendor do this?) would be reasonably thorough, complete, and\n&gt; representative.  If the unit tests don&#39;t exercise all the documented\n&gt; methods and boundaries of the API, they&#39;re incomplete anyway.  The hard\n&gt; part comes with testing coupling, interaction, and state changes between\n&gt; components, where the non-trivial bugs often lurk.\n&gt;\n&gt; On a more philosophical level, i&#39;d suggest that most unit testing is\n&gt; either very useful, or mostly useless, depending on the confidence of\n&gt; the programmer in the testing process.  Cowardly testing is a sign of a\n&gt; lack of confidence in the code.  Once a programmer gets in the habit of\n&gt; serious unit testing, the programmer will almost always be more\n&gt; confident in the code - and thus more likely to test thoroughly.  Good\n&gt; unit testing is a self-reinforcing feedback loop.  And if i were given a\n&gt; set of unit tests from a vendor that clearly did not thoroughly test the\n&gt; public interface of the software, i would immediately distrust the\n&gt; software in question.\n&gt;\n\n-- \nEric Vought\nChief Technical Officer - QLUE Consulting, Inc.\n\nevought@... toll-free: 888-771-3538  RTP area: 919-816-9901\n\n\n",
