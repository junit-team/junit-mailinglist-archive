    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-951288434\">Hi Jean <br/>\n<br/>\nI was pondering your first issue: <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 1. I need to know the correct result from the other way around and <br/>\n </span></blockquote>sometimes it&#39;s hard to find another way. <br/>\n<br/>\nI am not quite sure if I fully understand what you mean. Are you <br/>\nsaying, to write good test, you need two different &quot;approaches&quot; to <br/>\nsolve the problem under test? Like in the following, trivial <br/>\nexample: <br/>\n<br/>\n public int multiply(int a, int b) {<br/>\n  return a * b;<br/>\n }<br/>\n<br/>\n public void testMultiply() {<br/>\n  // test the expected result, &quot;the other way round&quot;<br/>\n  assertEquals(5 + 5, x.multiply(5, 2);<br/>\n }<br/>\n<br/>\nI can see that this can get quite hard for non-trivial problems. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf this is what you meant, I think I have good news: In believe this <br/>\nrigorous approach to unit testing is not necessary. It&#39;s perferctly <br/>\naccaptable to just write the test as: <br/>\n<br/>\n  assertEquals(5 * 2, x.multiply(5, 2);<br/>\n<br/>\nThe point of automated unit testing is not to prove algorithmic <br/>\ncorrectness but just to check real behavior against expected <br/>\nbehavior. In my opinion, the main benefit of _automated_ unit <br/>\ntesting is to be able to re-run the tests after implementation <br/>\nchanges. And, after implementation changes, you cannot be sure <br/>\nif &quot;the other way round&quot; is still another way or if it has actually <br/>\nbecome &quot;the way&quot;. So don&#39;t bother in the first place, and save a lot <br/>\nof time and pain. <br/>\n<br/>\nAgain: For me, automated unit tests are primarily like an insurance <br/>\nagainst quality degradation when I change code. They are less <br/>\nimportant to prove correctness of the initial version of the code I <br/>\nwrite. I tend to spend more time changeing existing code than <br/>\nwriting new code, so that&#39;s fine for me. <br/>\n<br/>\nBottom line is, forget about the &quot;other way round&quot; issue. ;-) <br/>\n<br/>\nHasko</div>",
