However whenever I run my SpringFramework test harness for \nController which uses Hibernate I get pages of logging.  It doesn&#39;t \nappear to be using my log4j.properties that I have in my classpath.  \nIs there a default one that is overriding mine, or is there something \nspecial to determine which it is using?  I have tried everything to \nmake this work, am I missing something obvious?  The Unit tests pick \nup all my other property files for use by the objects in the test, \nbut the logging is very verbose.\n\nexample:  [very truncated]\n\n...\n\n\n   [junit] - Creating shared instance of singleton \nbean &#39;localeResolver&#39;\n   [junit] - Creating shared instance of singleton \nbean &#39;themeResolver&#39;\n   [junit] - Creating shared instance of singleton bean &#39;viewResolver&#39;\n   [junit] - Creating shared instance of singleton \nbean &#39;exceptionResolver&#39;\n   [junit] - Creating shared instance of singleton \nbean &#39;hibernateTransactionManager&#39;\n   [junit] - Using DataSource \n[org.apache.commons.dbcp.BasicDataSource@3dd246] of Hibernate \nSessionFactory for HibernateTransactionM\n   [junit] - Creating shared instance of singleton bean &#39;orderDao&#39;\n\n...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
