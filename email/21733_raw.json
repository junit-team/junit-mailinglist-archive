After all of these test cases, I need =\r\nto verify that a particular condition is true.  My understanding is that te=\r\narDown should not be used to assert anything, because, among other reasons,=\r\n if your test case had an assertion failure, it would/could be masked by an=\r\n assertion failure in tearDown.  However, aside from manually adding calls =\r\nat the end of each and every one of my tests (which is obviously redundant =\r\nand error prone and as such unacceptable), how can I assert something after=\r\n each test is run?\n\nThanks\n\n\n\n",
