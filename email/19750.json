The<br/>\nmajority of the hamcrest matchers are in hamcrest-library, which can<br/>\nbe downloaded separately.  So, to get all of JUnit and all of<br/>\nHamcrest, without overlaps, you would download junit-x.x.jar, and<br/>\nhamcrest-library-x.x.jar.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are downsides to this arrangement.  My initial guess is that the<br/>\nnumber of people who will find themselves with classpath problems<br/>\nbecause they&#39;re using an incompatible version of hamcrest-all will be<br/>\nless than the number who would have found themselves with classpath<br/>\nproblems because they don&#39;t have hamcrest, or couldn&#39;t figure out<br/>\nwhich junit jar to download.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, experience has a way of proving me wrong.  We&#39;ll see.<br/>\n<br/>\n   David Saff<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 7/29/07, Mauro Talevi &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mauro.talevi@...\">mauro.talevi@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; David,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; David Saff wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; - To allow compatibility with a wide variety of possible matchers,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   we have decided to include the classes from hamcrest-core,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   from the [Hamcrest][] project.

Any reason you did not consider to do the same?  The compatibility motivation you cite<br/>\n&gt;   is not clear.  It is exactly for compatibility reasons that jars should be kept separate.  If a<br/>\n&gt; user wants to upgrade to a different version of hamcrest, it will conflict with the classes bundled.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Alternatively, you could provide a *separate* jar (eg junit-all.jar) which bundles with the<br/>\n&gt; dependencies, but keeping junit.jar without dependendencies bundled.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks and regards,<br/>\n&gt; Mauro<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; This SF.net email is sponsored by: Splunk Inc.<br/>\n&gt; Still grepping through log files to find problems?
