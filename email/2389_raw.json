B. Rainsberger&quot; &lt;jbrains762@...&gt;\r\n\r\n&gt; I am doing this because I wnat to share data between each test method (for\nexample my first method\n&gt; tests that I can create an EJB object, the next is that I can read it, the\nthird that I can update\n&gt; it and the last that I can delete it).\n[...]\n\nI&#39;ve been where you are, and for the same reason. Don&#39;t do it.\n\nHere is my testing pattern for EJBs.\n\nIn setUp(), begin a transaction. Perhaps create some data used by many/all\ntest method.\nIn each test method, create the necessary data and perform the tests. Factor\nout creation of data if you can.\nIn tearDown(), rollback the transaction. This way, my test data doesn&#39;t stay\nin the database.\n\n&gt; I am sharing a primary key (which is generated at run time from a database\nsequence) which I have no\n&gt; way of knowing the value of between one test run and the next.\n\nYou should be able to write code in a way that that doesn&#39;t matter. For\nexample, for each ejbCreate() method, write an alternate version that\naccepts a primary key rather than generates it. Test that method, since you\ncan easily pass in the primary key you want. Test all your creation\nscenarios using that method. Write a single test to verify that you can use\nthe generated keys correctly. This should be enough.\n\nAt the very least, create the data for each test. Put it in a separate\nmethod, possibly called by setUp(). It&#39;s easy and it works.\n\nJBR.\n\n",
