B. Rainsberger&quot; &lt;jbrains@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Consider the template code:\n&gt; \n&gt; public boolean equals(Object other) {\n&gt;     if (other != null && getClass() == other.getClass()) {\n&gt;         MyClass that = (MyClass) other;\n&gt;         // compare fields or whatever you like\n&gt;     }\n&gt;     else {\n&gt;         return false;\n&gt;     }\n&gt; }\n&gt; \n&gt; I claim that this implementation of equals fully supports the\n&gt; contract of Object#equals, including the subclass/superclass case. If\n&gt; you think that is false, then please show us a test consistent with\n&gt; the contract of Object#equals that this implementation does not pass.\n\nOkay, the equals method in the java.util.Set interface, and the two\nimplementations HashSet and TreeSet.\n\nAccording to the Set interface definition of equals, two Sets are equal\nif they have the same size, and all the contents of one are contained\nin the other.\n\nYour approach would return false in the case where you have two sets\nfull of the same object, but one is the HashSet implementation and the\nother is the TreeSet implementations.\n\nGranted, you said Object.equals (with transitivity, etc), but what\nwe&#39;ve been talking about is equals implementations as relates to\nsubclasses.  My point is, the instanceof approach also fufills the\nObject.equals contract, without breaking *this* case.\n\nThis leads into a discussion of when you should allow subclass\nequality, and when to deny it, which I&#39;d find interesting, but is\nprobably too far offtopic for this list.\n\n-Kevin\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nThe New Yahoo!
