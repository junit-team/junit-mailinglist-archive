This was based on some last minute ideas we had and chose to<br/>\n&gt;document shortly before release. We then had the choice of either providing<br/>\n&gt;a link to JUnitPerf or providing the distribution itself. It seemed like it<br/>\n&gt;would be more convenient for our customers to actually provide the JUnitPerf<br/>\n&gt;distribution itself, and it was fairly small so we chose to do that.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;This decision was made at the last minute when we were putting together our<br/>\n&gt;own distribution. Had the thought occurred to us earlier we might have<br/>\n&gt;contacted you first, but it didn&#39;t and we didn&#39;t and for that I apologize.<br/>\n&gt;Had I had any inkling that it would have caused you or anyone else the<br/>\n&gt;slightest mental distress, I would have done everything in my power to<br/>\n&gt;prevent that. Again, I didn&#39;t get any indication that you were at all<br/>\n&gt;disappointed in our correspondence last July but it might have been there<br/>\n&gt;and I just didn&#39;t pick up on it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;In the next release, we will take out the JUnitPerf distribution and just<br/>\n&gt;provide a link to your web site. That will also settle the question of<br/>\n&gt;whether our customers have access to the very latest JUnitPerf code, which<br/>\n&gt;solves a problem for me.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Fair enough.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for clarifying your intentions!<br/>\n<br/>\nMike<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nMike Clark<br/>\nClarkware Consulting Inc.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.clarkware.com\">http://www.clarkware.com</a></div>",
