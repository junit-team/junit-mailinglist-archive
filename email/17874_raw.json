Anyway, th=\r\nis was my mistake, and one that I didn&#39;t want to \nleave uncorrected.\n\nSo, h=\r\nere are links to two past discussion threads that dealt with the \nSystem.ex=\r\nit(n) topic:\n\nhttp://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/junit/message/8737\n\nhttp:/=\r\n/tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/junit/message/1830\n\nThanks to those who have r=\r\nesponded to this post.  Each one has made me \nthink and hopefully improve. =\r\n Also, your collective voice should help \nme nudge the developer towards a =\r\nbetter design :-).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
