After spending time on building mock objects, controllers and \nsetting up environment, I am just more than happy to spend one more \nminute to test those setters and getters.  It really puts my mind on \nease knowing that I have a good test coverage instead of reminding \nmyself every time &quot;You don&#39;t have test for the setters and getters \nbecause they are too simple to test&quot;.\n\nAnd yes, I did make mistake once on a setter and the test code caught \nit.  (In case you wonder, I mistyped the name of the field variable and \nthe code insight found another one for me. :)  )\n\nShane\n\n-- \nDisclaimer:  I join all the news groups out of my own interest.

I leave it as an exercise to the reader to imagine how that \n&gt;could happen. HINT: It happened to me. :)\n&gt;\n&gt;My suggestions:\n&gt;\n&gt;1. Use the immutable object idiom. (No setX() methods. If you need a new \n&gt;value, make a new object.)\n&gt;2. Write a simple test to ensure that what you pass to the constructor is \n&gt;what the getX() methods answer.\n&gt;\n&gt;Do this until you start writing perfect code all the time. :)\n&gt;\n&gt;JBR.\n&gt;\n&gt;----- Begin original message -----\n&gt;How about a class that can&#39;t possibly break?  Say a class with only setters\n&gt;and getters?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;_________________________________________________________________\n&gt;Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt;junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;Your use of Yahoo!
