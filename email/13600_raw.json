Are these all hand-coded?\n\nOrganizations that do *not* attempt testing these methods:  How do \nthey report their code coverage?  For instance, do they &quot;back-out&quot;\nthe \namount of code represented by getters/setters and then report the \npercentage of remaining code covered?  Or - do they lower the goal to \nsomething considerably less than 100%?\n\nIs anyone actually striving for near-100% code coverage?\n\n_Marvin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
