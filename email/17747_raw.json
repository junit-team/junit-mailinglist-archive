They do nothing about verifying that *your* code is not\n&gt; violating my preconditions.\n\nWhy do you worry about me?  I&#39;ll write my own unit tests, you  \nconcentrate on yours.  It is not your job to debug my code.\n\nNow, maybe you are building a framework and are trying to be kind to  \nthe callers of that framework by giving them expressive and  \ndiagnostically interesting error messages.  That&#39;s fine, and if I  \nwere a caller I would be grateful.  I would also be grateful to see  \nyour unit tests since they would tell me how to call your framework  \nand what to expect from it, and how NOT to get your expressive and  \ndiagnostically interesting error messages.\n\n\n----\nRobert C.
