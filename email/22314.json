I can see your argument, I was indeed trying to avoid the nasty doALotOfWorkToMakeABigThing in a test that just wanted to add assertions to a previous test, but where adding them to the base test would just have overwhelmed it.<br/>\n<br/>\nNothing that can&#39;t be solved (and made just that little bit too opaque) with another layer of indirection...<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<br/>\n<br/>\nDuncan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, David Saff &lt;david@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Duncan,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On Fri, Jan 22, 2010 at 1:17 PM, dmcg123 &lt;duncan@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; After over 10 years of using JUnit, it has only just struck me that test methods must return void, but why?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I can imagine a value in _allowing_ certain classes to override the<br/>\n&gt; validation behavior, but not as much value in loosening the class<br/>\n&gt; validation by default.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; For me, imagine someone writes this as their first JUnit test:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; @Test public boolean threeIsPrime() {<br/>\n&gt;   PrimeAnalyzer a = new PrimeAnalyzer();<br/>\n&gt;   return a.isPrime(3);<br/>\n&gt; }<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This test is likely to not do what its author intended.  Pushing this<br/>\n&gt; author to understand how JUnit works a little better provides value,<br/>\n&gt; and I haven&#39;t yet seen a proposal for loosening return value<br/>\n&gt; restrictions that provides more value.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; As an example:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve just come across an example where a particular test did a lot of work, and I wanted to piggy-back on its final state by calling the method from another test.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It seems to me that this pattern would solve this desire, at the cost<br/>\n&gt; of just one additional extracted method:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; private BigThing doALotOfWorkToMakeABigThing() { ... }<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; @Test public void basicBigThing() {<br/>\n&gt;   assertEquals(Size.BIG, doALotOfWorkToMakeABigThing().size());<br/>\n&gt; }<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; @Test public void shrink() {<br/>\n&gt;   BigThing thing = doALotOfWorkToMakeABigThing();<br/>\n&gt;   thing.shrink();<br/>\n&gt;   assertEquals(Size.SMALL, thing.size());<br/>\n&gt; }<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Is there any fundamental reason for not allowing me to return values? It might even be an opportunity to write an annotation expressing constraints about the value returned.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What would be the advantage of writing assertions as annotations<br/>\n&gt; rather than plain old Java?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;    David Saff<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Cheers<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Duncan McGregor<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
