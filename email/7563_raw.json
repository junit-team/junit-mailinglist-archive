Now if my TestSampleCase is invoked by an external servlet, (I have handled the running of a test suite, by iterating through the tests). Things work fine.\n\nHowever, if I need to pass some parameter to the constructor of TestSuite() , say the request and response objects. In that case, I do not know how to test the suite. \n\nI have to do something like this\n\nTestSampleCase tsc = new TestSampleCase(request, response);\nnew TestSuite().addTest(tsc); \n\nI want to run all the 25 test methods without passing them as parameters. How do I go about this. \n\nPFA, the files for your perusal.\n\nwarm regards\nSridhar Visvanath\n***********************************************************\nI don&#39;t say what u wanna hear, I say the truth\n***********************************************************\n\n &lt;&lt;sample.zip&gt;&gt; \n\n  ----------\n\nThis e-mail and any files transmitted with it are for the sole use of the intended recipient(s) and may contain confidential and privileged information.\nIf you are not the intended recipient, please contact the sender by reply e-mail and destroy all copies of the original message. \nAny unauthorised review, use, disclosure, dissemination, forwarding, printing or copying of this email or any action taken in reliance on this e-mail is strictly \nprohibited and may be unlawful.\n\n\t\tVisit us at http://www.cognizant.com\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n",
