I&#39;m a<br/>\n&gt; student and I&#39;m doing a research about how JUnit could be used in my<br/>\n&gt; company to improve the efficiency of software development. What my<br/>\n&gt; bosses, not knowing a lot about JUnit, only having heard of it, first<br/>\n&gt; wanted to have was a piece of software which tests an existing<br/>\n&gt; application on a technical level. (like &quot;one Button tests all&quot;)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It is impossible to write software that tests other software. I don&#39;t <br/>\nknow the proof, but then, I don&#39;t need to be convinced. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  &gt;From what I know now, JUnit is a framework for the developer to<br/>\n&gt; improve the quality of the application and to avoid failures in the<br/>\n&gt; code which might otherwise be overseen. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That sounds about right.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Now here&#39;s my question: does<br/>\n&gt; it make sense to take an existing application and try to write test<br/>\n&gt; cases/suites for it?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Does it make sense? Absolutely. Why not have more confidence in the <br/>\ncorrectness of your software?<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes it make sense for /this/ company, in /these/ market conditions, <br/>\n/now/? That depends. Like anything else, the company needs to decide how <br/>\nto spend its money, and testing existing software may or may not be high <br/>\nenough on the priority list.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe need to test existing software is, in my opinion, a function of the <br/>\nneed to change it. Changing software without tests is expensive because <br/>\nit&#39;s slow going (programmers are afraid to make the changes) and prone <br/>\nto error (programmers are right to be afraid). It is much easier and <br/>\nsafer to change software when, after each change, I can run a suite of <br/>\ntests that can tell me about the impact of my change. Since we spend <br/>\nmost of our time changing existing software, it is common to want/need <br/>\nto test existing software.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt; The application is a rather abstract one<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Applications can&#39;t be abstract. Frameworks are abstract, and <br/>\napplications are concrete.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; ...it&#39;s a<br/>\n&gt; middleware component (API) between one big and several smaller<br/>\n&gt; applications, it consist of several EJBs with basically lots of get-<br/>\n&gt; Methods, using JAX-RPC SOAP and RMI.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Whether it&#39;s middleware or not, you must be able to define &quot;working&quot; or <br/>\n&quot;not working&quot; for various parts of the components. If you can do that, <br/>\nthen you can write tests.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I doubt it makes sense, but I don&#39;t have a lot of experience about<br/>\n&gt; what JUnit is capable of and how the code would have to be refactored.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Why don&#39;t you think it makes sense? What are three reasons you wouldn&#39;t <br/>\nwrite tests for this code?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I guess it would make more sense telling the developers why and how<br/>\n&gt; to use JUnit in order to improve things in FUTURE developments and to<br/>\n&gt; stick with the old code without JUnit. What do you think?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is a common strategy: add tests to existing code /only/ when you <br/>\nneed to change the existing code. This helps us spend only the money we <br/>\nknow we need to spend on testing existing code. Often, this minimizes <br/>\nthe cost of maintaining the existing code.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; PS: Sorry I can&#39;t give you more information about the application I<br/>\n&gt; was talking about, I&#39;m still in the process of understanding how it<br/>\n&gt; works and I&#39;m not a Java-pro (yet:-).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Understood.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ.
