It didn&#39;t take long to get to the organizational dysfunction in play.\n&gt;\n\nHard to say it is dysfunction. In term of income, it is definitely\nfunctional, this is a company earn a lot and probably everyone know\nthe name.\n\n&gt;  Not necessarily: the more modularized the system, the less complex the\n&gt;  configuration would be. I&#39;m willing to bit there&#39;s at least one piece of\n&gt;  configuration information you have to specify in XML that either never\n&gt;  changes or you&#39;d never want to change, but you have to put it there\n&gt;  because something else in the same class needs to be configurable.\n&gt;  That&#39;s a sign of the layering problem I have in mind.\n&gt;\nThere are 2 examples I come to my mind immediately.\n1) We have a factory that hold the reference of all repositories in a\nmap. That map is configurable with difference implementation:\n\n\t&lt;bean id=&quot;concurrentHashMap&quot;\n\t\tclass=&quot;java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap&quot; singleton=&quot;false&quot; /&gt;\n\n2) All data access object ( map DB column names to getter and setter\nonly, no single logic, i.e.\nhttp://martinfowler.com/bliki/AnemicDomainModel.html ) , have\ninterfaces and inject by spring.\n\nI cannot think of any other implmentation for the above 2 cases,\nprobably better layering will help, but above is definitely\nover-engineering in my point of view.\n\n&gt;  Aha! Another organizational dysfunction. They&#39;re everywhere! :)\n&gt;\n\nWell.... we have to follow the policy :-/\n\n&gt;  I would want to learn more about the two organizational problems you\n&gt;  described to me first. Why are you being ordered to do something that\n&gt;  you strongly believe is a bad idea? Why does your team have to create\n&gt;  holes in the design to get around testing? What you describe is a\n&gt;  classic case of trying to solve people problems by changing code. It\n&gt;  doesn&#39;t work for long. :)\n&gt;\n&gt;  I sympathize with your position. It&#39;s not easy.\n&gt;\n\nActually may be my tone is too strong, people are nice and the order\nis just a stronger tone of recommendation from my supervior. I just\njoin this company and now I start to build up some creditability and\nprobably I can affect some design decision later.\n\n&gt;  I don&#39;t know whether it&#39;s so off-topic: introducing JUnit into an\n&gt;  organization tends to get people asking more interesting questions. I\n&gt;  see it over and over again.\n&gt;\n\nActually there are some junit tests that created before but now most\nof the are commented out like\n\npublic void testXXX() {\n/**\n....\n....\n*/\n}\n\nBecause they are already not compilable and no one bother to fix it.\nIt is a long way to persuade developer to write and maintain\nunit-test. :-/\n\n&gt;  Back to your comment, of course it&#39;s the case: DI containers are no more\n&gt;  magic than any other code. It&#39;s also false, though, that DI containers\n&gt;  force you to have 100 XML configuration files. I just wanted to be sure\n&gt;  both sides were represented in the discussion.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Good luck... I mean that.\n\nYes, I need luck ;-)\n\n",
