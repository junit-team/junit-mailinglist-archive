I use Ant Junit\n&gt; tasks to execute and create the HTML reports.\n&gt; The problem I have is that if I have the HTML produced doesn&#39;t reflect\n&gt; the nested TestSuite structure I used.\n&gt; For example if I have 3 layer a, B & C with each an appropriate Test\n&gt; Suite I&#39;d want teh top-level HTML to show the results of TestSuite A\n&gt; which consolidates the results from B & C. Essentially some similiar\n&gt; to the tree structure that the Swing JUnit runner produced in the tree\n&gt; panel.\n&gt; At the moment all the TestCases are expanded into a single page in the\n&gt; HTML under the main top-level TestSuite and with a total of over 700\n&gt; tests it is difficult to use.\n\n\nHi Barry,\n\nThis has been discussed\nhere&lt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/junit/message/14389&gt;.\nI&#39;m not sure how much help that will be for your particular case.\n\nThat&#39;s the third time that I&#39;ve seen this come up, and JUnit 4 is still in\ngestation, so I&#39;d like to take this opportunity to ask anyone involved with\ndeveloping it on their thoughts on this problem. I do prefix this with the\ncaveat that I haven&#39;t yet looked at JUnit4 or Java5 beyond reading Elliotte\nRusty Harold&#39;s developerworks article, so please be gentle with me.\n\nMy solution essentially involved adding startSuite and endSuite method\nsignatures to TestListener and then modifying TestResult to accept Observers\nthat implemented this new interface and report when the particular lifecycle\nevents occured. The implementation was just a first draft and could\ndoubtless be made more robust - my tests were just enough to get it up and\nrunning.\n\nI&#39;m aware of Kent&#39;s stated intent that JUnit should be the intersection of\ntest tool functionality rather than the union (somewhat paraphrased!), but\nI&#39;d be interested in hearing everyone&#39;s views about where this functionality\nshould live. Presumably the logic to maintain a hierarchy of TestSuites must\nbe reimplemented by all tool vendors interested in displaying a tree of the\nresults, rather than a core part of JUnit. Is that the right place for it?\nAs a counter argument, I can see that if a vendor implemented a\nmultithreaded TestRunner for running TestSuites concurrently, then\nmaintaining a hierarchy might be a little interesting using my simplistic\nimplementation.\n\nJames\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
