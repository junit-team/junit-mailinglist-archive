It happens; been<br/>\nthere and done that myself. I think the biggest issue was with folks<br/>\nwho signup on the mailing list and ask &quot;What is JUnit?&quot; Now, that&#39;s a<br/>\nvalid question, but I think the thought was to provide a list for that<br/>\nkind of question, so that it didn&#39;t disturb the flow of the &quot;How do<br/>\nI?&quot; questions.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy thought is that if we carefully point these folks at the available<br/>\ndocumentation on junit.org and suggest reviewing ESR&#39;s Smart Question<br/>\nessay, that they&#39;ll either give up when they see that some personal<br/>\neffort is involved or they&#39;ll appreciate the help and start becoming<br/>\nproductive members of the JUnit community.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also agree with J.B.&#39;s point, that some of these people are the<br/>\nexperts of a couple of years from now. You know, Mike Clark isn&#39;t<br/>\ngetting any younger, so we need to find and train his replacement as<br/>\nsoon as possible! ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nSimon<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nwww.simonpeter.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 9/21/05, Lis &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lisfolks@...\">lisfolks@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; I signed up for this list - after finding it in a web search - a<br/>\n&gt; couple of days ago.  I had no idea I&#39;d receive a FAQ after signing<br/>\n&gt; up.  Therefore, if I&#39;d had a question to ask at that time, I probably<br/>\n&gt; would&#39;ve asked it without thinking about it.  If I weren&#39;t familiar<br/>\n&gt; with Yahoo! Groups, I probably wouldn&#39;t have thought to check the<br/>\n&gt; message archives beforehand, either.  I&#39;m glad it happened to work<br/>\n&gt; out that I didn&#39;t end up being one of the people this thread is<br/>\n&gt; about!  What a welcome it would&#39;ve been!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks for providing the list, anyway, &#39;cause it looks interesting so<br/>\n&gt; far.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -- LeAnne<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On Sep 21, 2005, at 5:00 PM, Simon Chappell wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I can tell you that when I switched to using my gmail address for this<br/>\n&gt; &gt; mailing list (after deciding to discontinue using my employers email<br/>\n&gt; &gt; address for mailing lists), that I *did* receive a copy of the FAQ.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Simon<br/>\n&gt; &gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
