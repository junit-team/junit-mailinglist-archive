This one sounds like too much effort, especially since File is<br/>\n&gt; not an interface. Also this approach only tests the system style failure<br/>\n&gt; and not the jvm failure.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It&#39;s not easy to provide a sensible stub for the File class since File is<br/>\nonly an encapsulation of the file name. You have to write stub streams as<br/>\nwell which do the real input/output stuff. My suggestion would be to<br/>\nintroduce an interface which covers only your special requirements, e.g.<br/>\n<br/>\npublic interface MyFile {<br/>\n    PrintWriter getWriter();<br/>\n    BufferedReader getReader();<br/>\n    boolean exists();<br/>\n}<br/>\n<br/>\nThat way you can easily introduce a mock implementation which provides you<br/>\nwith the mock writer and reader instances.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, it might not be worth the effort.<br/>\n<br/>\nJohannes</div>",
