The problem is that it should NOT be \nlooking in =\r\nprogram files. I have a j2sdk1.4.2_06 directory on my \nroot C: drive and th=\r\nat is what I am referencing in my JAVA_HOME. I \neven went to what should be=\r\n an unnecessart step to add the tools.jar \nfor this directory to my CLASSPA=\r\nTH property. I am not using 1.5 yet \nsince it has not been approved by the =\r\norganization that I work for.\n\nWhy when I specifically am pointing to this =\r\ndirectory on JAVA_HOME \nand the CLASSPATH is it deciding to look in jre1.5.=\r\n0_06&#92;lib down \nunder Program Files. It is obviously totally ignoring these =\r\n\nproperties and going on its own hunting expedition. The question is, \nhow =\r\ncan I get it to stop?\n\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Wayne Fay&quot; &lt;waynefay=\r\n@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Might be related to the space in &quot;Program Files&quot;?
