    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-974395564\">Hi,<br/>\n   <br/>\n  My experience in a quarter-century-plus of software development and testing, most recently solely testing, is that a laissez-faire approach to the subject is what has continued the troubles that software has always had regarding quality. I&#39;m not saying wage Holy War and convert the masses, but I think it&#39;s worth discussing!<br/>\n   <br/>\n  I am on this list for two reasons. One, I am getting back into Java development, and want to employ junit properly. Two, I have worked with Java developers as a tester, and have suffered the consequences of their lack of interest in junit. Yes, I have a view on the matter. But what I want to discover, from both sides of the aisle, so to speak, is the eternal question - what makes testing worthwhile to people?<br/>\n   <br/>\n  I am, oddly enough, a human factors guy as well. I bugged Kent Beck about how people could keep up the intensity of the XP model, and he had a great answer - the &quot;Flow&quot; concept put forth by Czikszentmihalyi, which is something that many successful people in many different fields are familiar with. I&#39;m looking for something similar in the matter of testing.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  So what I&#39;m looking for in these discussions, is how can we avoid the problem of avoidable bugs making it too far downstream, or in other words, producing the code that we *intend* to produce. We can test bugs out, code review might help, reuse of tested code helps, and so forth. When I am a programmer, I get my joy out of coding - how can I keep in the &quot;flow&quot;, and yet have some faith that I am doing what I need to for the cause of quality, and producing my intended result?<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Now if that isn&#39;t a theological contemplation, I don&#39;t know what is!<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Dave<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;J.

One option you have <br/>\nis to start a thread and ask the questions you want answered. You can <br/>\nalso ignore the threads you don&#39;t want to read.
