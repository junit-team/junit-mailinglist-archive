If all &quot;complicated&quot;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;would be like that we can get 200% test coverage...<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;   You came to the right conclusion that SQLException is an<br/>\n&gt;&gt;unrecoverable one and should be wrapped into a runtime exception. You<br/>\n&gt;&gt;even have slight improvement there with a common exception handler.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;There is only one step left before template pattern, so you can have<br/>\n&gt;&gt;exactly one place where that exception handler would be used. Take a<br/>\n&gt;&gt;look at JDBC packages in a Spring framework and either copy its design<br/>\n&gt;&gt;or use as is.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;   Pretty much the same pattern can be applied to other common API&#39;s and<br/>\n&gt;&gt;many already in a very same Spring framework, so you won&#39;t have to<br/>\n&gt;&gt;invent the wheel.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;   As I said, there are really good ways to make code more testable.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;    <br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I agree that we can improve things with the Template pattern, but I&#39;d<br/>\n&gt;need a template for JDBC, for JMS, ... for every different 3rd-party<br/>\n&gt;product I use. Even if I do that, I still need to test-drive the<br/>\n&gt;template, or hide the template behind an interface so I can test-drive<br/>\n&gt;the code that uses it. I suppose it is achievable, but I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;worth the effort.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  Oh. It very well worth it and as I mentioned already there are <br/>\nframeworks for this, so others don&#39;t have to reimplement this stuff <br/>\nagain and again.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;If Java made the syntax for anonymous code blocks nicer, then I suppose <br/>\n&gt;this wouldn&#39;t be a problem. What I find is that when I try to use the <br/>\n&gt;Template pattern on projects, most of the people around me don&#39;t like it <br/>\n&gt;or don&#39;t understand it, even though it&#39;s quite natural to me.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  In many cases you don&#39;t even need bloks. Here is code for Spring API:<br/>\n<br/>\n  JdbcTemplate jt = new JdbcTemplate(dataSource);<br/>\n  jt.execute(&quot;create table mytable (id integer, name varchar(100))&quot;);<br/>\n  int count = jt.queryForInt(&quot;select count(*) from mytable&quot;);<br/>\n  List rows = jt.queryForList(&quot;select * from mytable&quot;);<br/>\n  etc...<br/>\n<br/>\n  regards,<br/>\n  Eugene<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
