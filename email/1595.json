That&#39;s the open-source way: everybody is able to<br/>\n&gt; pick what he needs.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>But many valid user resquests wait days, weeks, months to be<br/>\nimplemented.  If patches are processed more quickly, you can keep a real<br/>\ncvs tree and you be able to make a nighly (or weekly) build of JUnit. <br/>\nYou have then the last modifications if you want them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have the impression that _many_ people (including myself) are _really_<br/>\nwilling to contribute to the project but when you don&#39;t see any response<br/>\nfrom the code owners you&#39;re a little bit disappointed.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 2C<br/>\n<br/>\n-Vladimir</div>",
