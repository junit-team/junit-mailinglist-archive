I ensure that the old code is not <br/>\n&gt;broken and at the same time I test the new modifications also.<br/>\n&gt;Kindly correct if I am wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No, sorry, you are right. I should have started brain before writing. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Even JUnit is described as a Regession Testing framework and I had <br/>\n&gt;some posts earlier in this group which confirmed that.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Both are regression tests, but JUnis is a unit test (white box), while your<br/>\ndescription indicates functional tests (black box). I know tools like<br/>\nMercury LoadRunner quite good enough to know their value, but they have a<br/>\ndifferent approach. Each testing method has its own place, JUnit is used by<br/>\nprogrammers ensuring that they implement the necessary &quot;software contract&quot;<br/>\nand ensures that this contract is not suddenly broken, while recording the<br/>\noutput of an application and comparing different runs is a much higher<br/>\ntesting level.<br/>\n<br/>\nGreetings,<br/>\nJorg</div>",
