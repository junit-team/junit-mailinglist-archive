By this I use it on several\npages without problem except on the first screen.  I can not get it to\nfind the table with the specific id.  I have even gone back through\nthe prior releases to see when my issue would have surfaced.  I found\nthat the problem is with 1.4.6 and forward.  I have run the html\nthrough several html validators and they don&#39;t have any major issues,\njust missing 4.01 attributes that are not required.\n\nI&#39;m at a loss for what to do next, any ideas on what to look for or\ncould someone provide another pair of eyes to look at the code?\n\nAny help is greatly appreciated.\nThanks Jeff\n\n\n\n\n",
