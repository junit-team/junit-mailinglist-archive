Refactoring should be very easy.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I&#39;m starting to learn and play with AspectJ, I&#39;d try that (but would not bet money on this being a good idea). This would allow to intercept calls to System.out.print() and alike, and tweak it print the argument(s) of the print()-statement augmented with the class to which the calling method belongs.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, kristian@... wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sorry, I was doing just what I sometimes dislike of our own users ;)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The real problem I want to solve is associating console output from a running thread to a given test-case (for parallel runs). We have this fairly well covered already and we manage to capture everything that happens within a given test-case for that test-case.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The real problem is that the RunListener API does not demarcate test-classes properly, so I am unable to distinguish console output happening in @AfterClass of one test with @BeforeClass on the test-class on the same thread.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This problem has been in the corner of my eye for quite some time and I&#39;ve been trying to find a decent angle to solve it from.

It works for simple cases but with customized<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Runner-classes and new JUnit-features (e.g. the introduction of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; JUnit-Rules) the result is usually bad and it discourages the IDE users<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (i.e. the developers) from taking full advantage of JUnit!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; However, Maven (versions 2.0-2.2) and its Surefire-plugin has handled the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; JUnit-integration wonderfully, as far as I know, so your post worries me a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; little. What is it that you want to accomplish by moving away from the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; successful(!) &quot;Junitcore+RunListener based approach&quot;?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Henrik<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, kristian@ wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I maintain the junit provider for maven-surefire, and I&#39;m looking into<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; transitioning from a Junitcore+RunListener based approach to an approach<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; based on something like BlockJUnit4ClassRunner.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Unfortunately I cannot subclass the BlockJUnit4ClassRunner since the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; client code itself may need to do that, so I&#39;d somehow need to put &quot;my&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Runner in front of the client-supplied one, maybe something proxy like.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Anyone have any tips on this, maybe some existing code that does this ?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Kristian<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
