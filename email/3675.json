I know that&#39;s been the<br/>\n&gt; case with me. I tend to spend test effort where I am likely to find the<br/>\n&gt; most bugs with the least work. The common practice seems to be to refactor<br/>\n&gt; as much of the logic out of the GUI as possible, automate just enough of<br/>\n&gt; the GUI test for sanity checking, then manually walk through it as part of<br/>\n&gt; a functional test process. It&#39;s *not* entirely satisfactory, but does<br/>\n&gt; (mostly) work.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Perhaps there might be an offshoot of JUnit that can automate GUI testing,<br/>\nbut in that case, you need a simple scripting language--with the real work<br/>\ndone under the hood.  It&#39;s kind of like testing a webapp, you have to have<br/>\nan external program test the critical sections by script--it is inneficient<br/>\nto do it with direct Java code.<br/>\n<br/>\nI find that JUnit style testing works best for tests in the microcosm of<br/>\nindividual classes or components.  Scripting language based testing works<br/>\nbest for tests in the macrocosm of a running system.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, again we have to differentiate between *unit* tests and *integration*<br/>\ntests.  Anything with a GUI (webapp or swing app) should be considered<br/>\nintegration testing.  JUnit is not suited for integration testing--although<br/>\nit can be extended in some ways to allow for a certain level of integration<br/>\ntesting (I did this with Avalon component testing framework).<br/>\n<br/>\nThat solution does not necessarily scale well, because sometimes you have<br/>\nto test what happens when there is interaction between optional components<br/>\nand if the tested component fails gracefully if a required component is<br/>\nnot available.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy advice: JUnit for unit tests, and some other tool for integration tests.<br/>\n<br/>\nBoth are necessary, and they catch different classes of bugs.  While JUnit<br/>\nworks well for a one size fits all unit test, it is rare to find an integration<br/>\ntest framework that fits all situations.  That is because the environment<br/>\nis different for each type of system.  For example, Webapps have a very different<br/>\nenvironment than Swing based apps, and both environments are very different<br/>\nfrom testing a server.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; On Thu, 27 Dec 2001, Lee Chalupa wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt;Thanks for your time Berin.
