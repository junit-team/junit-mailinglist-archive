Since<br/>\n   a modern software application often interacts with a diverse<br/>\n   execution environment in a complicated and unpredictable manner,<br/>\n   there is a clear need for approaches that test an application, an<br/>\n   application&#39;s execution environment, and the interaction between<br/>\n   the software application and its environment. In light of these<br/>\n   trends, the overall theme of WISEST 2007 is:<br/>\n   <br/>\n      Improving software testing by integrating execution environments <br/>\n<br/>\n   The workshop will focus on the testing and analysis of a program<br/>\n   and an execution environment that contains a wide variety of<br/>\n   additional hardware and software factors.  The goals of WISEST 2007<br/>\n   are to:<br/>\n<br/>\n       - articulate the fundamental research questions associated<br/>\n       with testing software applications and their execution<br/>\n       environments <br/>\n<br/>\n       - support the description and evaluation of innovative<br/>\n       &quot;environment aware&quot; approaches to software testing<br/>\n<br/>\n-----------------<br/>\n  Call for Papers<br/>\n-----------------<br/>\n<br/>\n   WISEST 2007 solicits experience, tool, and research papers that<br/>\n   explore software testing and analysis techniques that explicitly<br/>\n   integrate an application&#39;s execution environment. It is suggested,<br/>\n   although not strictly required, that papers discuss environment<br/>\n   aware approaches to testing and analysis that are related to:<br/>\n<br/>\n   \t   adequacy criteria, test suite execution, test coverage<br/>\n   \t   monitoring, automated test data generation, regression<br/>\n   \t   testing, debugging, automated fault localization, and<br/>\n   \t   performance evaluation.<br/>\n<br/>\n   The testing approach should focus on a system environment that<br/>\n   includes, but is not limited to, factors such as the:<br/>\n<br/>\n\t   operating system, computer architecture, database, file<br/>\n           system, graphical user interface, wireless sensor network,<br/>\n           distributed system middleware, and virtual machine.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----------------<br/>\n  Types of Papers<br/>\n-----------------<br/>\n<br/>\n    - Experience reports should provide practical insights into how to<br/>\n      use existing approaches to perform testing and analysis in an<br/>\n      environment aware fashion.<br/>\n<br/>\n    - Tool papers must focus on the design, implementation, and<br/>\n      evaluation of environment aware software testing and analysis<br/>\n      tools.<br/>\n<br/>\n    - Original research papers will explore novel testing techniques<br/>\n      that are explicitly designed to incorporate a software system&#39;s<br/>\n      execution environment.<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------<br/>\n  Paper Evaluation<br/>\n------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n   All papers will undergo a rigorous review by at least three members<br/>\n   of the Program Committee. All submitted papers will be evaluated<br/>\n   according to (i) relevance to the workshop themes and goals and<br/>\n   (ii) clarity and organization. Experience reports will be evaluated<br/>\n   with respect to the significance and generality of the described<br/>\n   testing experience. Research and tool papers will be judged by the<br/>\n   technical merit, novelty, and evaluation of the described technique<br/>\n   or tool. The results described in the submitted paper must be<br/>\n   unpublished and should not be under review at other workshops,<br/>\n   conferences, or journals.<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------<br/>\n  Paper Formatting<br/>\n------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n   Papers should be formatted using the ACM SIG templates. Including<br/>\n   all references and figures, a paper must not exceed the six page<br/>\n   limit. Authors should submit a PDF version of their paper using the<br/>\n   CyberChairPro affiliated with the ISSTA 2007 conference. More<br/>\n   details about paper submission will be provided on the WISEST Web<br/>\n   site.<br/>\n<br/>\n----------------------<br/>\n  Workshop Proceedings<br/>\n----------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n   The WISEST 2007 proceedings will be published in a printed volume<br/>\n   that will be given to participants at the workshop. The complete<br/>\n   proceedings will also be available for download in the ACM Digital<br/>\n   Library and the titles of the accepted papers will be listed in the<br/>\n   print edition of Software Engineering Notes.  The presentations for<br/>\n   all of the accepted papers will also be provided on the WISEST Web<br/>\n   site.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----------------<br/>\n  Important Dates<br/>\n-----------------<br/>\n<br/>\n   April 20, 2007: \tPaper Submission Deadline <br/>\n   May 25, 2007: \tAuthor Notification<br/>\n   June 15, 2007: \tCamera Ready Copy<br/>\n   July 9, 2007: \tWISEST 2007 Workshop<br/>\n   July 10-12, 2007: \tISSTA 2007 Conference<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------<br/>\n  Workshop Co-Chairs<br/>\n--------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n   Mary Lou Soffa (University of Virginia) \t\t<br/>\n   Gregory M.
