I&#39;ll take a shot at the first one:\n\nOn 12/13/06, lightbulb432 &lt;veerukrishnan@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; What is the point of these mock object tools? I first read about mock\n&gt; objects in a book on JUnit that had an example using straight JUnit to\n&gt; create the mock object and test it. What do these tools do that is special\n&gt; that you can&#39;t do yourself - I haven&#39;t been able to figure out by their\n&gt; websites, perhaps somebody could explain it in simple terms?\n\nLike most useful frameworks, the mock object frameworks earn their\nplace by automating repetitive tasks.  There are several examples I\ncould give, but one is being able to easily specify the behavior of\njust one method in an interface.  For example Bundle is an interface\ntype with 22 methods in the Eclipse runtime API.  If I want to test a\nmethod that takes a bundle b, but only depends on the result of\nb.getSymbolicName(), using just Java, I have to create 21 stub methods\nI care nothing about.  Even though my IDE can create them for me,\nthere&#39;s a big loss in the clarity of the test.  If, instead, I can\njust write (JMock 1):\n\nmockBundle.stubs().method(&quot;getSymbolicName&quot;).will(returnValue(&quot;bundle.id&quot;));\n\nThen I&#39;ve managed the same intent with one line of code.\n\nAs a side note, I think that this is even clearer:\n\nassumeThat(mockBundle.getSymbolicName(), eq(&quot;bundle.id&quot;));\n\nThis is something I&#39;ve built in to a custom runner for JUnit,\ndescribed in part here:\n\nhttp://shareandenjoy.saff.net/2006/12/new-paper-practice-of-theories.html\n\nUntil you find that intuitively, or from experience, this reduction in\neffort is worth the cost of installing and using such a mock\nframework, choosing a package and understanding its documentation is\nprobably not a high priority.  I know very good developers who do not\nuse mock frameworks--I&#39;d start out that way, and then return to the\nframeworks once you&#39;ve written a dozen or so mocks by hand.\n\nHope this helps,\n\n   David Saff\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Basically, what all am I getting from one of these tools that I couldn&#39;t\n&gt; from just doing it myself? (I realize there are benefits, I just don&#39;t know\n&gt; - in beginner terms - what they are.)\n&gt;\n&gt; Also, looking at the tutorials on rMock (and jMock, and easyMock which has\n&gt; this issue but to a lesser degree), I realized that they are extremely\n&gt; sparse. Just a little more than a page is apparently enough to teach people,\n&gt; but not me! Are people who are new to mock objects really supposed to\n&gt; understand it from their minimal Getting Started sections? Or is it just me?\n&gt; What&#39;s the best way for me to learn something like rMock?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Lasse Koskela wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi &quot;veerukrishnan&quot;,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; On 12/13/06, lightbulb432 &lt;veerukrishnan@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;  I&#39;m new to JUnit, and am wondering about using mock objects with JUnit.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I wa\n&gt; &gt;&gt;  looking at www.mockobjects.com, and on the right side of the page it\n&gt; &gt;&gt; lists\n&gt; &gt;&gt;  &quot;implementations&quot;, and for Java it says jMock, EasyMock, and rMock.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;  What does it mean by implementations? What standard or specification are\n&gt; &gt;&gt;  they implementing, if any?\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;  Or are they really very different things that only use the &quot;concept&quot; of\n&gt; &gt;&gt; mock\n&gt; &gt;&gt;  objects, but implement it very differently?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; EasyMock, jMock and rMock are not implementations of any standard or\n&gt; &gt; specification. They&#39;re implementations of the mock object pattern\n&gt; &gt; where you define &quot;expectations&quot; (expected interaction, method calls in\n&gt; &gt; Java) for a smart test double, which can then afterwards verify\n&gt; &gt; whether those expectations were met.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; On 12/13/06, lightbulb432 &lt;veerukrishnan@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;  Any advice for a beginner as to which of those three implementations to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; look\n&gt; &gt;&gt;  at (any difference in functionality, robustness, or any other\n&gt; &gt;&gt; criteria?).\n&gt; &gt;&gt;  Looking at their websites I couldn&#39;t really tell what the main\n&gt; &gt;&gt; differences\n&gt; &gt;&gt;  are.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve been personally using EasyMock for a long time. The reason for me\n&gt; &gt; having used EasyMock has really been just that I disliked the\n&gt; &gt; string-based approach of jMock (which doesn&#39;t work with automated\n&gt; &gt; refactoring tools too well, not to mention modern IDE&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; auto-completion features) and rMock has just recently appeared on the\n&gt; &gt; market.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Functionally all of the above frameworks are almost identical so if\n&gt; &gt; you don&#39;t have any bias towards a specific library, I&#39;d recommend\n&gt; &gt; trying each of them out by writing a small set of tests with each\n&gt; &gt; alternative. For jMock, however, be sure to use the 2.0 branch from\n&gt; &gt; their Subversion repository as the API will change completely. They&#39;re\n&gt; &gt; dumping the string-based expectation setting API in the upcoming 2.0\n&gt; &gt; release (which Nat Pryce promised would be out real soon...).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Lasse\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt; View this message in context: http://www.nabble.com/Using-mock-objects-tf2812332.html#a7860038\n&gt; Sent from the JUnit - User mailing list archive at Nabble.com.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
