There will be some problems with publicly available 3rd-party runners but the most serious consequences (for end-users) will probably show up where they have some customized in-house runner ...public class Somebodies_Inhouse_Runner extends JUnit4ClassRunner {&nbsp; public Someones_Inhourse_Runner(Class&lt;?&gt; testClass) {super(testClass);}}... and a common test super-class ...@ RunWith(Somebodies_Inhouse_Runner.class)public abstract TestSuperClass { /* Common test-utils go here! */ }... both of which class-files are available on the test class-path (perhaps in a separate jar-file).A test that extends TestSuperClass ...public class BrokenTest extends TestSuperClass {&nbsp; @ Test&nbsp; public void myTestMethod() {}}... will compile and run as expected with JUnit-4.11. With 4.12-beta-1 it will still compile (without warnings!) but the test-run will result in this error message:&quot;Type [unknown] not present&quot;(I have verified this scenario with JDK-7)My opinion on this:Keeping JUnit4ClassRunner - and finalize its deprecation by having its constructor throw an understandable error-message - would leave the JUnit community with a maintenance burden that is insignificant compared to the burden of finding out the meaning of &quot;Type [unknown] not present&quot;!BR /Henrik Kaipe</div>",
