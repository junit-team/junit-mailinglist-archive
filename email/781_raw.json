(I use this class to run all the unit\n&gt; tests in my project). This is rather annoying, and I read somewhere that\n&gt; there is a tool for automatically creating test suites, rather than\n&gt; maintaining a class like this by hand. As I remember, it was a case of\n&gt; pointing this tool at your classpath and it would go away and find all your\n&gt; test classes and create a suite for them. Does such a tool exist? Can anyone\n&gt; tell me where I can get it? I had a look around junit.org but I couldn&#39;t see\n&gt; anything like it.\n\nIt was an article in JavaWorld, &quot;JUnit Best Practices&quot; and it had source\nattached to it for bp.TestAll which recurses through a class structure on\ndisk and runs every test class it encounters.  There was a thread here\na few weeks ago, I think, where I helped someone get it running.  It&#39;s\nquite particular about the classpath.\n\nHowever, it appears JavaWorld&#39;s website has moved the article, the link I\nhave for it is broken today. :(\n\nI have the original source zip, if you can&#39;t find it on JavaWorld&#39;s website,\nemail me privately and I&#39;ll send it to you.  I don&#39;t have the original\narticle in electronic format, though.\n\nFor what it&#39;s worth, I don&#39;t have the update problem any longer since I\nstarted using the uTest OpenTool with JBuilder.  Whenver I create a new\napplication class and hit &#39;Syncronize&#39; it creates the test class stub\nand updates the AllTests.java file automatically.  It&#39;s sweet.\n\n-- \nJoi Ellis                    Software Engineer\nAravox Technologies          joi@..., gyles19@...\n\nNo matter what we think of Linux versus FreeBSD, etc., the one thing I\nreally like about Linux is that it has Microsoft worried.  Anything\nthat kicks a monopoly in the pants has got to be good for something.\n           - Chris Johnson\n\n\n",
