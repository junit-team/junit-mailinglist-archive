I said I&#39;d mention something we discussed on this mailing \nlist so here goes (and apologies to Bruce if I&#39;ve misrepresented his thoughts).\n\nBruce mentioned using the &quot;auto commit off&quot; trick to make database testing \neasier.   I.e., you do something like turn auto commit off during setUp() \nand do an rollback/abort in tearDown(), so you can write to a test database \nand not have to worry about cleaning it up. Something like that.\n\nI replied talking about the problems when you have methods which are \nthemselves transactions (i.e., methods which\nstart transactions, write to various tables, then commit).  How can you use \nthe &quot;auto commit off&quot; trick in those situations?\n\nBruce suggested that you may be able to get something to work with nested \ntransactions, perhaps using a transaction service such as JTA/JTS.  Sounds \ngood to me, but I haven&#39;t had the opportunity to investigate this idea or \nthe Java Transaction APIs.\n\nCan anyone comment on this approach?\n\nRegards\nRichard\n\n\n",
