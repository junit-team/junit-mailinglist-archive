It&#39;s the way JUnit is designed\nto be used.  I&#39;ve seen Kent make the same point.\n\n&gt; &gt;Oh, but it&#39;s my approach that was attacked with a groundless claim.  \n&gt; &gt;Sorry for wondering why.\n\nWondering is good.  Research with an open mind is better.\n\nI try to make a habit of making bold, confrontational statements.  It\nchallenges people (you obviously took it as a challenge), get&#39;s their\nattentions, and stirs up discussion.  These are all good things IMO. \nMy intention is not to attack, just to startle.\n\nHowever, I do believe what I expounded is the best way to do it.  The\n*best* way, not the *only* way.  In fact I don&#39;t always do it the way\nI described, but I try to.  Just like I strive to have only a single\nassertion per test (sometimes to the extent of extracting a complex\ntest into a local assert method).  Again, I didn&#39;t come up with these\nideas, I just see the truth & value in them.\n\n&gt; It may be that Dave was describing a general-purpose, \n&gt; one-size-fits-all approach that could be optimized in your specific \n&gt; case. If you ask him civilly, I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll respond. If you feel he\n&gt; was being uncivil towards you, then be the bigger man and tell him \n&gt; so, civilly. I missed his part of the exchange, so I can&#39;t say.\n\nI don&#39;t think I was being uncivil.  Just putting forth what I think is\nthe *best* way to do it.  The *best* isn&#39;t always doable... but like\nthe simplest thing, you should alwasy at least consider it.\n\n&gt; If you write code first, then &quot;likely&quot; add tests, why is that TDD? I\n&gt; don&#39;t think it is.\n\nNo.  To be doing TDD you don&#39;t write code without a failing test that\nrequires it in order to pass.   THAT is TDD.\n\nKent&#39;s book does a fabulous job of showing you *What TDD is*. \nEveryone should buy it & read it repeatedly until the binding falls apart.\n\n*ahem* You should also buy my book when it comes out.  It&#39;s goal is to\nshow you *how to do TDD in Java*.  Hopefull it will have a lay-flat\nbinding so you can easily have it open next to your keyoard.\n\nDave\n\n\n",
