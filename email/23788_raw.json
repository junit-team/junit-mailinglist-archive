We have this fairly well cov=\r\nered already and we manage to capture everything that happens within a give=\r\nn test-case for that test-case.\n\nThe real problem is that the RunListener A=\r\nPI does not demarcate test-classes properly, so I am unable to distinguish =\r\nconsole output happening in @AfterClass of one test with @BeforeClass on th=\r\ne test-class on the same thread.\n\nThis problem has been in the corner of my=\r\n eye for quite some time and I&#39;ve been trying to find a decent angle to sol=\r\nve it from. I promise not to do anything that is frowned upon, which is why=\r\n I asked ;)\n\nKristian\n\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, Matthew Farwell &lt;matt=\r\nhew@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Kristian,\n&gt; \n&gt; In reading your original mail, I was als=\r\no confused as to what you wanted to\n&gt; achieve.

It works for sim=\r\nple cases but with customized\n&gt; &gt; Runner-classes and new JUnit-features (e.=\r\ng. the introduction of\n&gt; &gt; JUnit-Rules) the result is usually bad and it di=\r\nscourages the IDE users\n&gt; &gt; (i.e. the developers) from taking full advantag=\r\ne of JUnit!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; However, Maven (versions 2.0-2.2) and its Surefire-plug=\r\nin has handled the\n&gt; &gt; JUnit-integration wonderfully, as far as I know, so =\r\nyour post worries me a\n&gt; &gt; little. What is it that you want to accomplish b=\r\ny moving away from the\n&gt; &gt; successful(!) &quot;Junitcore+RunListener based appro=\r\nach&quot;?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Henrik\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In junit@yahoogroups.com, kristian@ wr=\r\note:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I maintain the junit provider for maven-su=\r\nrefire, and I&#39;m looking into\n&gt; &gt; transitioning from a Junitcore+RunListener=\r\n based approach to an approach\n&gt; &gt; based on something like BlockJUnit4Class=\r\nRunner.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Unfortunately I cannot subclass the BlockJUnit4ClassRun=\r\nner since the\n&gt; &gt; client code itself may need to do that, so I&#39;d somehow ne=\r\ned to put &quot;my&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Runner in front of the client-supplied one, maybe some=\r\nthing proxy like.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Anyone have any tips on this, maybe some exis=\r\nting code that does this ?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Kristian\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n\n\n\n",
