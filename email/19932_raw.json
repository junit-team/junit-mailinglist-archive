And so my basic p=\r\nlan is to write some JUnit test cases\nthat will interact with our product t=\r\nhrough this Java API, just as a\ncustomer would.  But I don&#39;t want to have a=\r\nny of our product source code\nchecked out to do this.  Instead, I want my J=\r\nUnit test case&#39;s setUp() to\nfind the appropriate JAR file on a remote syste=\r\nm, fetch it locally, and\nthen start running tests against it.  That way, wh=\r\nenever the JAR file on\nthe remote system (our system-under-test) changes, I=\r\n know I&#39;ll be\ntesting the latest API code.\n\nI&#39;ve got all the tools at hand =\r\nto find and fetch the JAR file, but I&#39;m\nnot sure what my approach should be=\r\n to load the JAR at runtime AFTER my\ntest (and thus the JVM it&#39;s running in=\r\n) has already started.  Any advice\nfor me?\n\n\nTodd.\n----\nTodd Bradley - Poly=\r\ncom, Inc.\nReadiVideo QA Lead\n\n",
