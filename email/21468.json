    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-200029522\">As per the other replies I would suggest that you want to &quot;mirror&quot; your<br/>\nsource directories with test directories. That is, don&#39;t mix production<br/>\ncode and test code in the same directories. Just let your production<br/>\ncode package structure induce a test code directory structure. Now you<br/>\ncan use your IDE to launch tests at the approporate level by choosing<br/>\nthe appropriate directory.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you find you need greater control than that, I&#39;ve found a utility<br/>\ncalled ClasspathSuite<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.johanneslink.net/projects/cpsuite.html\">http://www.johanneslink.net/projects/cpsuite.html</a>&gt;   handy for running<br/>\ndifferent sets of tests in Eclipse (especially if you want to run tests<br/>\nacross more than one Eclipse project). I can choose which tests to run<br/>\nbased on test class naming conventions.<br/>\n<br/>\nBelow is the body of the class that I use to run my project&#39;s unit tests<br/>\nbut not my project&#39;s integration tests:<br/>\n<br/>\n@RunWith(ClasspathSuite.class)<br/>\n@SuiteTypes({ JUNIT38_TEST_CLASSES, TEST_CLASSES })<br/>\n@ClassnameFilters({&quot;.*(Behaviou?r|Spec|Test)&quot;, &quot;!.*IntegrationTest&quot;})<br/>\n<br/>\npublic class AllUnitTests {}<br/>\n<br/>\nNext I make a launch target in Eclipse that runs AllUnitTests as a JUnit<br/>\nTest.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs you might guess from the ClassnameFilters above, a project history<br/>\nthat includes a mixture of folks from Canada and from the States<br/>\nexperimenting with BDD, requires me to use the regular expression<br/>\n`Behaviou?r` to match a few of the project&#39;s unit tests. Sigh.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck,<br/>\nAlistair<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;David Parks&quot; &lt;davidparks21@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi there, I&#39;m new at JUnit, and just want to start using it with a new<br/>\nproject.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m trying to figure out the best way to easily expand on a set of<br/>\ntest classes.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It seems like I should configure a TestSuite of some sort. But I&#39;m not<br/>\nsure if I should use the DirectoryBuilder, or if I should manually<br/>\nmaintain a class that launches my tests, or use annotations.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It looks like there is a way to simply annotate the classes I want to<br/>\nrun and then to be able to kick off various test suites. But the docs<br/>\ndon&#39;t have many examples of this. And it seems like there are many ways<br/>\nto do the same thing.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The cookbook just mentions using<br/>\nJUnitCore.runClasses(TestClass1.class, ...), but that doesn&#39;t seem very<br/>\nextendable.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m just looking for a simple best practice. I&#39;d like to not have to<br/>\nupdate a main() method each time I want to add a new test class. I&#39;d<br/>\nlike to simply kick off one or another suite of test classes from my IDE<br/>\nin most cases and get a nicely printed result printed to the console.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks!<br/>\n&gt; David<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>",
