He <br/>\n&gt; states &quot;that a test suite that covers one implementation of a <br/>\n&gt; specification does not necessarily cover a different <br/>\n&gt; implementation of the same specification&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I interpret &quot;not necessarily&quot; as &quot;there&#39;s no such thing in <br/>\n&gt; the general case&quot;. One short example which is hopefully <br/>\n&gt; obvious enough this time. Consider a function for sorting an <br/>\n&gt; array of String objects:<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[Snipping a bunch of stuff]<br/>\n<br/>\nIn reality, you *can* have the best of both worlds.  The<br/>\nissue at hand is that a general test case excercises all the<br/>\ncontracts that the public interface has.  A contract is a<br/>\nguarantee that the class must satisfy.<br/>\n<br/>\nI start my tests at the general case.  If someone reports<br/>\na bug to me where a particular implementation goofs up<br/>\ninternally, I add a testcase that reproduces the problem.<br/>\nI am careful to make sure that the testcase does not<br/>\nintroduce additional &quot;undocumented&quot; contracts to how the<br/>\nclass is used.  In practice, it&#39;s not that hard.  A bug is<br/>\nwhen the class fails to live up to its contracts anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I am done, I have the benefit of the general testcase<br/>\nplus the new regression test that is added due to the bug.<br/>\nThe regression test has the added benefit of ensuring the<br/>\nparticular circumstance that caused the bug in the first<br/>\nimplementation doesn&#39;t creep back in.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf what you are talking about is different than what I just<br/>\ndescribed, perhaps it is because we&#39;re not speaking the same<br/>\nlanguage?</div>",
