Also, I&#39;m aware of junitejb, which again seems geared\ntowards testing through a session bean interface.  \n\nIn many ways, I think the issues i&#39;m facing are those discussed often\non this list regarding testing of database code.\n\nI have a set of entity beans (CMP2.0) with a Stateless Session Bean\nfacade, and a business delegate (plain old java object) fronting the\nstateless session bean.  I&#39;d like to call all my tests through my\nbusiness delegate, as the Entity Bean is largely code-generated by\nthe container anyway, and the functionality I&#39;m really interested\nin testing is my invoking of the methods with value objects.\n\nHowever, since i have no guarantee of the order my tests are run in,\nI need to cleardown the persisted entities between each test; I&#39;ve\nwritten a DBTestCase in the past that performs a cleardown of tables\nin the setUp() method, and allows each test to insert rows, modify\nrows, delete rows, etc, and assert on entries existing in the\ndatabase.\n\nWhat strategies have people successfully employed for testing\nbusiness/workflow methods of a stateless session bean that has\nCMP entity beans at the back-end ?\n\nThanks,\n\nSteven\n\n",
