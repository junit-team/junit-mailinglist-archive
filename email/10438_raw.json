You do not\nneed test.jar in your classpath. The problem I had was where JUnit was\ninstalled. If the directory path to the JUnit directory has a space in\nit (&quot;C:&#92;Documents and Settings&quot; in his case; &quot;C:&#92;Program Files&quot; in my\ncase), the class locator has a problem with the space. He suggested it\nmight be because it converts it to the hex %20 representation. This\ndoes not seem to cause a problem for the JAR files located through the\nclasspath, only those loaded explicitly. I moved my install directory\nfor JUnit to C:&#92;JavaDev&#92;JUnit, changed my classpath for the junit.jar,\nand it ran fine.\n\nThis should probably be in the FAQ as it seems a lot of people hit it\nunder Windows, especially as Sun&#39;s default install for their Java\ndirectory is under Program Files.\n\nI have not moved it to my Sun box to test it there yet.\n\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;rikard_land&quot; &lt;riceland@s...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; I get the same error during installation test \n&gt; (&quot;ClassNotFoundException&quot; in test &quot;testJarClassLoading&quot;). The \n&gt; file &quot;test.jar&quot; (with path) is included in classpath, as well as \n&gt; current directory. I use Java SDK 1.4.2.03.\n&gt; \n&gt; JUnit seems to run fine apart from this, but I suppose I will have \n&gt; problems as soon as I start fiddling with jar files... \n&gt; \n&gt; Did you ever solve it?  \n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Rikard\n\n\n\n",
