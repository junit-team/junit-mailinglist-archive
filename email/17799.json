However, as the system starts  <br/>\nto get complicated those simple constructors sometimes become  <br/>\ncomplications because of the need to have mocks for unit tests. Later  <br/>\nthey become even greater complications because of the need to break  <br/>\nor invert dependencies between modules.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis does not mean that you should avoid all simple constructors.   <br/>\nThat would be silly and pointless.  What it does mean is that all  <br/>\nprogrammers should be adept at the various techniques for quickly  <br/>\nconverting from simple constructors to simple polymorphic  <br/>\nconstructors.  It also means that all programmers should understand  <br/>\nthe issues of intermodule dependencies and how to manage them (which  <br/>\nis what OO is really all about).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n----<br/>\nRobert C.
