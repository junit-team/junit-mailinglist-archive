I do not have any experience but would love<br/>\nto hear if anyone else has.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Thu, 03 Mar 2005 14:26:16 -0000, Coolspot714 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Coolspot714@...\">Coolspot714@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hi everybody,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I was wondering if any of you are actually using JUnit + something <br/>\n&gt; for perfomance testing. I see the advantage of being able to reuse <br/>\n&gt; the existing unit-tests for performance testing without having to <br/>\n&gt; write the testcases again (maybe even in a different (scripting)<br/>\n&gt; language). But I&#39;m sure one has to bear in mind that the unit tests <br/>\n&gt; are to be used for performance testing as well, especially regarding <br/>\n&gt; granularity and test-data. I also fear that JUnit tests ususally tend <br/>\n&gt; to not represent user-behavior, which is supposed to be simulated <br/>\n&gt; during load-tests. But I&#39;m pretty sure than can be achieved with <br/>\n&gt; appropriate scheduling. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So do you have any experience about how JUnit + JUnitPerf/+The <br/>\n&gt; Grinder/... competes against &quot;pure&quot; load-test tools like Mercury&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; LoadRunner, Rational Robot, OpenSTA, The Grinder(without JUnit) etc.?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The reason why I&#39;m asking is because our developers start to use <br/>\n&gt; JUnit (I made them buy your book J.B. ;-) from now on (some already <br/>\n&gt; have used it) and I&#39;m dealing with developing performance/loadtesting <br/>\n&gt; processes. Most of our applications run as EJBs on Bea WLS 8.1 with <br/>\n&gt; oracle DBs. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks in advance,<br/>\n&gt; Thomas<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
