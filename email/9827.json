I would like to be able make this suite <br/>\nportable.  In other words, I&#39;d like be able to run it in an IDE, or to run it <br/>\nfrom Ant/Maven, and want to be able to run it even if the project is installed <br/>\nin a different directory on a different machine.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince DirectorySuiteBuilder wants to have an path or File to start recursing on, <br/>\nI&#39;m not sure how to do this.<br/>\n<br/>\nI could probably make the user define MYPROJECT_HOME and hardcode the root of my <br/>\nproject, then write some code to look this up and base the DirectorySuiteBuilder <br/>\npath on this.  However, I&#39;d like to avoid that if I could.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes anyone have a good solution to this problem?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nChad</div>",
