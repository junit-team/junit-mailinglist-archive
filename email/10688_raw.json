But what advantage does having three\nentities, rather than just two, give you? Well, I suppose that you\ncan have a bunch of test cases sharing common setup/teardown code,\nbut I&#39;m not sure that you need this to be something separate than a\nTestSuite, since a TestSuite uses the composite pattern anyway, and so\ncan aggregate instances of itself.\n\nJust as a data point, here are Robert V. Binder&#39;s definitions of some of\nthese terms, from the glossary of _Testing Object-Oriented Systems_:\n\n    test. (1) An activity in which a system or a component is executed\n\tunder specified conditions, the results are observed or recorded,\n\tand an evaluation is made of some aspect of the system or component.\n\t... (3) A set of one or more test cases. (4) A set of one or more\n\ttest procedures. (5) A set of one or more test cases and procedures\n\t[IEEE 610]\n\n    test case.  A set of inputs, execution conditions, and expected\n\tresults developed for a particular objective. A representation or\n\timplementation that defines a pretest state of the IUT and its\n\tenvironment, test inputs or conditions, and the exepcted result.\n\n    test suite.  (1) A related collection of test cases. A collection\n        of test case sequences that serve a particular testing goal for\n        a particular version of an IUT. A whole-part relationship exists\n        among test cases. ...\n\n(IEEE 610 is the _ANSI/IEEE standard 610.12-1990: glossary of software\nengineering terminology._)\n\nSo according to this terminology, I&#39;d use\n\n    TestSuite (1) ---&gt; (n) TestCase\n\nor perhaps, if I found a good reason to\n\n    Test (1) ---&gt; (n) TestSuite (1) ---&gt; (n) TestCase\n\nThe current terminology actually caused me several years of confusion,\nthough I understand it now.\n\nAnyway, I&#39;ve gotten used to other things, such as consistently refering\nto developer tests as the &quot;unit tests,&quot; even though any major XP project\nI&#39;ve worked on has had quite a few developer tests that were not unit\ntests and--though fewer--unit tests that were not developer tests. So\nI suppose I&#39;ll eventually get used to this, too. Still, it would be\nnice if this followed what appears to me to be fairly standard testing\nterminology. (Sorry, I&#39;m not an expert on testing, so I may be wrong\nabout this.)\n\ncjs\n-- \nCurt Sampson  &lt;cjs@...&gt;   +81 90 7737 2974   http://www.NetBSD.org\n    Don&#39;t you know, in this new Dark Age, we&#39;re all light.  --XTC\n\n",
