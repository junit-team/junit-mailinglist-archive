They also point to an observation I&#39;ve made about \nabstract classes, explaining why I prefer not to use them.\n\nEvery abstract class consists of two parts: the abstract part and the \nconcrete part. The concrete part consists of all the fields and methods \nwith implementations (bodies). The abstract part consists of all the \ndeclarations of abstract methods.\n\nI recommend splitting (most) abstract classes into a concrete class and \nan interface. Test the interface using the recipe you cited. Test the \nconcrete class with interaction-style tests faking and mocking the \ninterface, as needed.\n\nThe concrete class will probably take an instance of the interface \nthrough its constructor.\n\nI know you probably can&#39;t change the design of the code you&#39;re testing, \nbut if you can, consider giving this technique a go.\n\nTake care.\n----\nThis is the first time I can see value in the test case class not \nextending a JUnit framework class. We could use the Self-Shunt pattern \nwhere the test case class provides implementations for the abstract \nmethods, extending the abstract class. There would probably be one class \nper different way to fake the abstract methods. This corresponds pretty \nwell to different test case classes for different fixtures, in general. \nIf I had a good, concrete example for this, I could write an article.\n-- \nJ. B.
