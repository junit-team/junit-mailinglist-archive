If they can do that, then what use are the comments?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>When do I find documentation usefull:<br/>\nOften a programmer switches from one to another business domain. If he doesn&#39;t understand a business domain, it can be quite hard for him to understand the intent. I find documentation on business domain and the way it was abstracted into code usefull. Documenting the business is not really a programmer&#39;s job, but you will often find a situation where such documentation is non existent. <br/>\nAlso, documentation on larger scale solutions, architecture, patterns can also be usefull to communicate the intent, because it is much more difficult to understand and get &quot;the bigger picture&quot; from code.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards,<br/>\n<br/>\nDanijel</div>",
