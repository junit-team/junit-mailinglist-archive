The<br/>\n&gt;  response to Crap4J was so positive that we decided to go further and<br/>\n&gt;  created a dedicated website crap4j.org &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.crap4j.org\">http://www.crap4j.org</a>&gt; .<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  We&#39;ve had hundreds of downloads since we launched the site,  along with<br/>\n&gt;  many requests for Ant support and support for IDEs other than Eclipse.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  We just added Ant support in 1.1.4, and we are planning to support other<br/>\n&gt;  IDEs like NetBeans and IntelliJ (BTW, if you are interested in<br/>\n&gt;  contribute to plug-in development please let us know).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  If you have a chance, please try Crap4J on your project and let us know<br/>\n&gt;  what you think.  We are interested in getting this group&#39;s feedback on<br/>\n&gt;  Crap4j and suggestions for improving and extending it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  The home page is: www.crap4j.org &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.crap4j.org\">http://www.crap4j.org</a>&gt; ; from there<br/>\n&gt;  you can navigate to the download page.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  If you have any problems installing it or running it, feel free to ask<br/>\n&gt;  for help on the forum or file a bug report or feature request.<br/>\n&gt;  &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://trac.crap4j.org/\">http://trac.crap4j.org/</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Thanks,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Alberto<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;                    <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJason Rogers<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live;<br/>\nyet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life<br/>\nwhich I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of<br/>\nthe Son of God, who loved me, and gave<br/>\nhimself for me.&quot;<br/>\n    Galatians 2:20 </span></blockquote></div>",
