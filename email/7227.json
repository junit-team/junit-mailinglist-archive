I don&#39;t think<br/>\nthey do.  So, if you want your API to support it, then add<br/>\nisResultSetClosed() and isPreparedStatementClosed() to your class --<br/>\ndepending on your need you could just check a simple state variable that<br/>\nsays whether they are closed (setting that when you close them) or you<br/>\ncould do some magic on the instance variables that programmatically<br/>\ndetermines whether they are closed (I think that&#39;s overkill).<br/>\n<br/>\nIs this something you need only for the test?  If so, I don&#39;t think that<br/>\nit is necessary.  Just depend on the 3rd party API and trust it until<br/>\nsuch time that you have a valid reason not to trust it.  If/When that<br/>\ncomes to be, write a test case that demonstrates the problem, then<br/>\ndesign a solution (like invalidate the PS or RS).<br/>\n<br/>\n=jason<br/>\n[:question | ^One] <br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: wxcodemaster [mailto:wxcodemaster@...] <br/>\nSent: Friday, March 14, 2003 1:23 AM<br/>\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com<br/>\nSubject: [junit] please help - was connection closed?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\ni have a method within factory class A that does<br/>\nrs.close()    (ResultSet)<br/>\nstmt.close()   (PreparedStatement)<br/>\n<br/>\nin my junit test class i want to check<br/>\nthat after execution of this method<br/>\nrs and stmt are really closed.<br/>\n<br/>\nis there an easy way to do this?
