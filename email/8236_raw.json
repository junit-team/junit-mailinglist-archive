This is a way to run a single test with a\nsingle test method multiple times with different arguments being passed to the\ntest method for each iteration.\n\nI assume that if I looked at the formater output from a test like this I would\nsee the same test name / test method name repeated once for each iteration.\n\nWhile I have seen the API javadoc on the setName() method, I do not understand\nit, nor do I know if it would affect the formatter output.  I would _really_\nlike to read in the name  I want for a test along with the test data (in the\none-time test suite setup() I think), and have a way to dynamically set the\nmethod name (or test name), so I would see a useful list of tests in the\nformatter output.  I _could_ print the testname read in with the argumens to\nSysout, but that is so scruffy, and the versions of junit (3.8.1) and ant\n(1.5.3) I use, do not seem to display the sysout output in the junitreport html\npages.\n\n\nAny hints or suggestions welcome!\n-- \nTom Porter                                       txporter@...\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&quot;On two occasions I have been asked [by members of Parliament], \n&#39;Pray, Mr. Babbage, if you put into the machine wrong figures, will \nthe right answers come out?&#39;  I am not able rightly to apprehend the \nkind of confusion of ideas that could provoke such a question.&quot;\n\n\n\n",
