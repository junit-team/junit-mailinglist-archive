If your issue is simply that <br/>\n&gt;you want to guarantee the ordering of your test cases, you can cheat by <br/>\n&gt;having white box knowledge of the implementation of junit. If you don&#39;t <br/>\n&gt;use the reflection method of adding tests (i.e. - explicitly adding the <br/>\n&gt;test) you know that the tests will execute in the same order in which they <br/>\n&gt;were added. Note that JUnit does not advertise any contract in this area <br/>\n&gt;and the underlying implementation of test case execution could change at <br/>\n&gt;any release.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>i am new to testing an junit, but it it seems that you would like the unit <br/>\ntests for each class to be run before any tests that involve combinations <br/>\nof a class or involve a package at a higher level. if you get a bunch of <br/>\nerrors in your utility package, you probably want to bail and reporting <br/>\nthese in a bottom up manner will make it easier to see where the problem <br/>\nstarts.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;...<br/>\n&gt;Functional testing of API&#39;s have many of the same design and usage <br/>\n&gt;patterns of any functional test tool out on the market. Keep in mind that <br/>\n&gt;if tests have dependencies - you will effectively be blocked from <br/>\n&gt;executing dependent tests when you encounter a failure. This has a bad <br/>\n&gt;smell, weather you are doing functional, unit - or using a commercial tool <br/>\n&gt;like Silk or LoadRunner. That being said, sometimes it does make sense to <br/>\n&gt;couple test cases, or a series of test cases - but you need to understand <br/>\n&gt;the tradeoffs before doing this.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>i agree about the bad smell, but i am looking at using junit, cactus, <br/>\nhttpunit etc. to test some web apps. it seems that there are at least 3 <br/>\nlevels of tests from unit tests on each class to a functional test of a web <br/>\napp. and the associated dependencies. does anyon know how people have <br/>\nstructured their tests in such cases?<br/>\n<br/>\nthanks<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">    ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt;   From: erikstunkat<br/>\n&gt;   To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;   Sent: Friday, April 19, 2002 7:25 AM<br/>\n&gt;   Subject: [junit] Re: junit tests and functional/ integration tests<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;...  We have junit tests and java property files.
