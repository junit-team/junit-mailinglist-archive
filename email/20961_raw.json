One of the problems is that\neach of the runners out there (Eclipse, IntelliJ, Ant, Maven) has their own\nmechanism to run tests and report results. They don&#39;t generally go through\nJUnitCore, so we don&#39;t have a hook to add our own logging.\n \nYou&#39;ll have to hack something up if you want it now. Your custom runner idea\nwould work but might be fragile. Another possibility is to put together\nminimal plug-ins for Eclipse and IntelliJ (Eclipse, anyway, offers an\nextension point for tracking test runs) and a task for your build system to\ndeposit reports in some central location. This would be more work than the\nrunner, but would leave you free to use custom runners for other purposes.\n \nThe bigger issue is how to offer a test runner API that all the UIs would be\nsatisfied using and would offer universal extension points. I&#39;m tempted to\ncall a workshop for all the potential consumers of such an interface and see\nhow much we could get done in a week.\n \nRegards,\n \nKent Beck\nThree Rivers Institute\n\n  _____  \n\nFrom: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of\nuly562000\nSent: Wednesday, October 08, 2008 9:22 AM\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: [junit] Adding a listener without using core?\n\n\n\nContext: I am writing code that monitors the frequency, timing, and\nresults of tests, and the code needs must run from eclipse, intellij,\netc, relatively invisibly to the user.\n\nAs far as I can tell, the only way to add a listener is to do it\nthrough the JUnitCore class. Unfortunately, I can&#39;t use the standard\nformula of running from main().\n\nIs there a way to add a listener from elsewhere in the dynamic object\ntree?\n\nI have a deliciously crude hack: Use RunsWith and a custom runner,\nthen change the invokeMethod statement so that I can gather the info I\nneed. It would be so much nicer if I could just add a listener, tho,\nbecause my hack would require me to extract all the info, which in\nfact a listener already gets all nicely packaged.\n\nIdeas?\nHill\n\n\n\n \n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
