I want to make that decision in my test<br/>\n&gt;class and not in the class that runs the suite.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What if your TestCase class directly extended TestSetup? I&#39;ve never tried it, but I wonder whether that would add the feature you need. I know there are some compile issues to work out, but that&#39;s why I&#39;m just &quot;Throwing it out there&quot; as an idea. I make no warrant that it could work. :) [If I needed it to work for myself, I would figure it out.]<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I think one time setup/teardown is appropriate when<br/>\n&gt;you have a static set of data and you are testing<br/>\n&gt;methods that read and write that data in a set way. <br/>\n&gt;For my application, I&#39;m testing database mappings and<br/>\n&gt;a thesarus used in converting individual values.  The<br/>\n&gt;source data only needs to be loaded once, not for<br/>\n&gt;every test.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Question: what might you get wrong in the database mappings? Maybe there&#39;s a better way to do this that avoids the problem of one-time setup/teardown.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;In fact, the more I think about it, I would probably<br/>\n&gt;end up using one time setup/teardown a lot more than<br/>\n&gt;the standard setup/teardown mechanism and it has<br/>\n&gt;nothing to do with how I&#39;ve factored my application. <br/>\n&gt;So, having either an overloaded setUp/tearDown,<br/>\n&gt;separate set of methods, or a tag interface to allow<br/>\n&gt;one time setup/teardown makes a lot of sense to me.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>So build it. If it&#39;s really good, contribute it to JUnit-addons.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJ. B.
