Note that I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; don&#39;t agree with a lot of it.\n&gt;\n&gt; To clarify my sentence above, the last word &quot;it&quot; equates to things\n&gt; written on the site about exploratory testing, as well as a lot of\n&gt; negatives about test automation.\n\nFunny, you know I am in general agreement with all he&#39;s saying about GUI\ntest automation, and how it&#39;s not much use. His problem is that he&#39;s\ntesting in the wrong place. He wants to test if the printer driver gets\nthe margins correct, and he ends up testing the entire GUI, too. He&#39;s\na victim of the &quot;separate the testers and the programmers&quot; method of\ndevelopment.\n\nIf you replace ten difficult GUI tests with one difficult GUI test\nand ten easier tests at a lower level, suddenly you find your test\nautomation has become much easier.\n\ncjs\n-- \nCurt Sampson  &lt;cjs@...&gt;   +81 90 7737 2974   http://www.NetBSD.org\n    Don&#39;t you know, in this new Dark Age, we&#39;re all light.  --XTC\n\n",
