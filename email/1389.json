Nor can you generate things like network-delay & <br/>\nsimulataneous hits in a fashion loadrunner does.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo guys there who are doing serious web-testing (blackbox) , try <br/>\nloadrunner, its pricey but worth the moolah! & efforts.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;what am i doing talking off loadrunner on a junit - mailing list&gt;&gt;<br/>\nWell i thought there were many people asking here about blackbox <br/>\ntesting and decided to draw their attention to this nice tool.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo offense meant to rest of the juniteers.<br/>\n<br/>\nregards<br/>\nkrishna<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In junit@y..., Jalam Singh Bhati &lt;jalams@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Hi,<br/>\n&gt;   You can test Java (or J2EE) application using Jtest </span></blockquote></div>",
