In many<br/>\n&gt; cases, teams find the most value in simulating these kinds of UI<br/>\n&gt; interactions in their automated tests: when the notification is clicked, it<br/>\n&gt; generates some kind of call back into the app.  Your automated test simply<br/>\n&gt; verifies that the call out to the notification manager is made, and then<br/>\n&gt; explicitly triggers the call back into the app.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It is true that this kind of test will not catch, for example, if you&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; made a wrong assumption about the notification manager API, and are calling<br/>\n&gt; it in a way that looks good in the test, but doesn&#39;t actually create an<br/>\n&gt; on-screen notification.  Many teams find that occasionally manually testing<br/>\n&gt; the app/UI integration is cheap and sufficient to catch these kinds of<br/>\n&gt; errors.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Good luck,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;    David Saff<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On Tue, May 22, 2012 at 8:27 AM, akshay.mnit11 &lt;akshay.mnit11@...&gt;wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; **<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I am writing testing framework to test an application.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; This application receives IM(audio/video) and then notifies the user<br/>\n&gt; &gt; through notification bar.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; i need an automation to click on notification item.
