My understanding is that tearDown should not be used to assert anything, because, among other reasons, if your test case had an assertion failure, it would/could be masked by an assertion failure in tearDown.  However, aside from manually adding calls at the end of each and every one of my tests (which is obviously redundant and error prone and as such unacceptable), how can I assert something after each test is run?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks</div>",
