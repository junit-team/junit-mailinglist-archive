Most of my &quot;concrete&quot; classes implement more\nthan one of these i=\r\nnterfaces.\n\nNow, I was hoping to find a way to refactor my tests so that ea=\r\nch\ninterface has its own abstract TestCase. Then, if multiple inheritance\nw=\r\nas allowed in Java, I could simply implement each classes concrete\nclasse&#39;s=\r\n TestCase by inheriting from all the appropriate &quot;interface\nTestCases&quot;.\n\nTh=\r\nis would allow me to inherit all the general purpose fixtures and\nsimply ad=\r\nd some new fixtures targeted for the concrete classe&#39;s\nspecific behavior. I=\r\nn a way, I simply want to enforce the &quot;Liskov\nSubstitution Principle&quot; as si=\r\nmply as possible...\n\nI know multiple inheritance isn&#39;t allowed in Java and =\r\nshould be\navoided anyway but I&#39;d like to find a simple way to keep the gene=\r\nral\nidea of &quot;interface specific super TestCases&quot; and apply it to classes\nim=\r\nplementing several of these interfaces.\n\nIs the general idea a good one ? I=\r\nf it is, what is  the best way to achieve it ?\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nD.\n\n\n\n\n",
