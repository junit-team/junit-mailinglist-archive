If you test your public _and_ protected methods, you&#39;re <br/>\nsimply &quot;overtesting&quot; your class (writing more tests than strictly <br/>\nnecessary).  It&#39;s up to you to decide if you need these tests.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like the idea of letting the user decide if he/she wants to test the <br/>\nprotected methods or not.  Sometimes it&#39;s useful, sometimes it&#39;s not, <br/>\nbut as I don&#39;t know anything about your classes, I prefer not to impose <br/>\nsuch rules.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt; If your public methods work, doesn&#39;t that imply that the <br/>\n </span></blockquote>private/protected<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; methods also work?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It depends how well these tests cover you class&#39;s code.  Your test <br/>\nmethods may not cover 100% of the code and your class will still work <br/>\nfine.  If anther class extends this class and calls your <br/>\nprivate/protected methods with other arguments (and exercise code you <br/>\nhaven&#39;t tested), your class _may_ not work properly anymore.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can find arguments for not testing public methods and for testing <br/>\nthem.  The goal is to find bugs as early as possible (and not to write <br/>\ntests).  If you&#39;re confident that you write clean code by only testing <br/>\nthe public methods, fine.  Other developers prefer to test public and <br/>\nprotected methods.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a matter of confidence<br/>\n<br/>\n-Vladimir<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nVladimir Bossicard<br/>\nwww.bossicard.com</div>",
