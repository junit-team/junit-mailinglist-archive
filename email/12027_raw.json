I&#39;m in the\nunfortunate situation of having to write tests for an existing\napplication(I haven&#39;t been involved in the development). \n\nI found tons of information about test-driven development and\ntest-first, but hardly anything about writing tests after the\napplication has been developed. Any experiences? \n\nIt still isn&#39;t determined yet on which level the tests should take\nplace. &quot;Real unit-tests&quot; (&quot;test everything that could possibly break&quot;)\nwould be too much work for the given time(~6 weeks), I guess. So it\nmight be more something like acceptance tests. \n\nThe SUT is a middleware-API running on an application server, using\nwebservices and RMI to get and set customer data from several remote\ndatabases (lots of getters for about 10mio customers). =&gt; no user\ninterface/gui etc. \n\nSince we still have to exactly figure out what we want to test, I\nwould appreciate some information about whether or not JUnit is the\nright choice in general (alternatives?) and some advices for my &quot;test\nlast&quot; approach. \n\nThanks in advance,\nThomas\n\n\n\n",
