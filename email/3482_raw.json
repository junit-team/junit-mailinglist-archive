Save the sample background and result. Repeat the request\n&gt; in a test and verify the request still builds the sample. Classic\n&gt; regression testing. Anytime you break the test, by changing how the\n&gt; graphics are created, you are forced to reverify. \n&gt; \n\nThanks for the suggestion.  We were already thinking along these lines but \nit seemed a bit kludgy.  But now that we can call it &quot;regression testing&quot; we \nwill feel comfortable enough to use this approach! \n\nThanks again,\nTodd Chaffee\n\n",
