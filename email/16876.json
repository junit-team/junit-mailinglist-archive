I<br/>\nwrote a test class. I am using a suite such as<br/>\n<br/>\n    public static junit.framework.Test suite() {<br/>\n        return new JUnit4TestAdapter(TestSynonymEngine.class);<br/>\n    }<br/>\n<br/>\nI am running my tests from an Ant 1.6.2. In my ant script I have a<br/>\ntarget with a &lt;junit&gt; task that ultimately uses a &lt;batchtest&gt; to run<br/>\nmy tests. The tests run and pass or fail appropriately, but, where I<br/>\nshould have the name of the tests that were run I instead get<br/>\n<br/>\n    [junit] Testcase: unknown took 2.109 sec                         <br/>\n                                                  <br/>\n    [junit] Testcase: unknown took 0.156 sec                         <br/>\n                                                  <br/>\n    [junit] Testcase: unknown took 0.11 sec                          <br/>\n                                                  <br/>\n    [junit] Testcase: unknown took 0.204 sec                         <br/>\n                                                  <br/>\n    [junit] Testcase: unknown took 0.093 sec                         <br/>\n                                                  <br/>\n<br/>\nand my &lt;junitreport&gt; output similarly shows the names of the tests as<br/>\n&quot;unknown&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was my understanding that the whole purpose of the<br/>\nJUnit4TestAdapter was &quot;so that the new JUnit 4 tests can be run with<br/>\nthe old runners&quot;. So am I seeing a bug in JUnit4TestAdapter or what?<br/>\nDid I miss some configuration option or documentation detail or FAQ?<br/>\nIf so, please point me in the right direction.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would like to move to JUnit4 as I really like the enhancements but<br/>\nnot knowing the name of the failing test is a deal breaker and I don&#39;t<br/>\nhave any interest in using alpha-Ant code on my production builds. The<br/>\noutput of &lt;junitreport&gt; is critical for our build process, so...<br/>\n<br/>\nKevin</div>",
