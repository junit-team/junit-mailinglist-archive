Perhaps if this<br/>\n&gt; discussion were face to face that would have helped us all.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Having been on both sides of the debating table with JB, both agreeing<br/>\nwith and disagreeing with, I would just like to say that JB has always<br/>\nbeen one to conduct himself with the highest level of manners and<br/>\nintegrity, both on this list and in other venues.<br/>\n<br/>\nJB&#39;s specific question that appears to have triggered your concern<br/>\nlooks perfectly reasonable to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease accept my apologies, but I had not been closely following this<br/>\nconversation because logging within unit tests seems unnecessary. I<br/>\nget a report when I run the tests using Ant, and as long as they all<br/>\npass, and have been updated as necessary, it shouldn&#39;t matter. But as<br/>\na moderator on this list, your comment caught my eye when approving<br/>\nit.<br/>\n<br/>\nPart of the challenge of email communication is that we get none of<br/>\nthe spontaneity of face to face discussions and none of the<br/>\nside-channel meta-communications (gestures, facial expressions,<br/>\nlaughter etc etc), so please take extra care to allow for this known<br/>\ndrawback. I have never had the opportunity to meet JB in person, but<br/>\nhe and I have managed to have some excellent conversations over the<br/>\nyears both where I agreed and dis-agreed. One disagreement was so<br/>\nstrong, that he quoted me in his book as the opposite side for one of<br/>\nhis essays in the appendixes. Seems more than fair to me! :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nSimon<br/>\n(One of the JUnit list moderators)<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nsimonpeter.org | simonpeter.com | newlife-upc.org | wisconsindistrictnews.org</div>",
