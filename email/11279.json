Of course, there will always be feature<br/>\ndifferences between source code instrumentation-based<br/>\n(Clover), bytecode instrumentation-based (EMMA), and<br/>\nJVMPI-based tools (many other commercial tools). <br/>\n<br/>\nNo, EMMA has not been integrated into Maven (yet),<br/>\nalthough this has been much requested as soon as it<br/>\nwas published outside of Trilogy. This feature will be<br/>\nimplemented in near future (another developer is<br/>\njoining the project soon specifically to address this<br/>\narea) but I don&#39;t think this is a gate for starting to<br/>\nuse EMMA now.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nNew and Improved Yahoo!
