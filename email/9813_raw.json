He appeared to be claiming that it came from the JUnit\n&gt; &gt; Web site.  I was investigating the claim.\n&gt;\n&gt; AH.  As J.B. already said.. you could have asked for clarification.\n\nI did.  In the simplest sort of way.  I said either (a) he was quoting\nthe JUnit Web site accurately, in which case they were contradicting\nthemselves, or (b) he was correcting them, in which case it would seem\nreasonable, on the JUnit list, to accept the definitions on the JUnit\nWeb site.  Then I probed around to see if I could figure out what he\nwas citing, and quoted the results of my probes.\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Page 74-78, &quot;Test-Driven Development: A Practical Guide&quot;.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hmmmm.  Doesn&#39;t appear to be the JUnit Web site ...\n&gt;\n&gt; I may be dating myself but I still put more more faith in\n&gt; peer-reviewed published-by-reputable-publishers books that anything on\n&gt; the web.\n\nBut this discussion is on the JUnit list, about unit programming in Java,\nand specifically about the definition of &quot;fixture&quot; in the JUnit context,\nwhere the definition was to given by me to someone using JUnit for the\nfirst time, brief advice given in reply to a request for advice, in what\nI would hope would be seen as a helpful manner.\n\n&gt; &gt; Each new fixture ** is created in an instance of that subclass, used\n&gt; &gt; once, then discarded.&quot; **\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hoist with your own petard, I would say ;-)\n&gt;\n&gt; Why?  If we wish to discuss terminology.. then.. exactly what the\n&gt; *&^%#%@% does that mean?  Very rude images come to mind.\n\nShakespeare.  Sappers would carry explosives up to a wall, possibly via a\ntunnel.  Sometimes the petard, the charge, would go off prematurely, in\nwhich case the sapper was hoist (raised up, blown up) by his own petard.\nFrequently used in reference to one who has disproved his own case.\n\nI put stars (*) under the word &quot;in&quot; in your quotation, emphasizing the\nfact that the fixture is _in_ the instance of the subclass.  That is, the\nfixture, the set of objects under test, is IN (or linked to) the instance\nof the subclass.  There you have three distinct entities -- fixture,\ninstance, class -- by your own account.\n\nYour email client may have moved the stars, obscuring my meaning.\n\nI have recently spent an unfortunate amount of time working with Java\nclasses at the bytecode level.  I know quite well that the fixtures in\nquestion are in no sense &quot;in&quot; the class or instance of the class.\nInstead there are pointers (references) from the instance to the objects\nthat make up the fixture.\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then recall that an object is an INSTANCE of a class.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Well... not always... in the common-place OO languages, sure.  But\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sometimes it&#39;s a copy of a prototype.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; My friend\n&gt;\n&gt; There you go making assumptions again :)\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; this is the JUnit list.  We are talking about Java classes.\n&gt;\n&gt; Ah.. but you didn&#39;t say &quot;**In Java** an object is an instance of a class&quot;\n\nI repeat, this discussion has been from the start about Java and it is\ncertainly on the JUnit list.  It simply confuses issues to ramble off\ninto other spheres, especially where the claim is that judgements made\nin those other worlds must prevail over what is common sense here.\n\n&gt; &gt; You may disparage Java as a commonplace OO language.  That&#39;s your\n&gt; &gt; right.\n&gt;\n&gt; Actually, it just really sucks as programming languages go... but so\n&gt; do most of the currently mainstream ones.\n\nWell, it beats FORTRAN.\n\nAlthough I expect that on vector machines, FORTRAN beats the pants off\nJava or pretty much any other language in performance.\n\n&gt; &gt; In Java\n&gt;\n&gt; Java is not the whole enchilada, my friend.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; a class is a very well-specified thing, and it not the same\n&gt; &gt; thing as a instance.\n&gt;\n&gt; Unfortunately true.&#92;\n\nAgreed.  :-)\n\n&gt; &gt; You really ought to know this.\n&gt;\n&gt; Oh.. I really do.  But I try not to constrain my thinking by the\n&gt; limitations of a single language.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; I think that that we could use our time more productively than this.\n&gt;\n&gt; Discussion = unproductive?  Not in my world.  Discussion-&gt;learning.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; I have been trying to decide whether unit testing is really\n&gt; &gt; applicable in multi-threaded applications, for example, and\n&gt; &gt; wondering how JUnit could be extended to be useful in this area.\n&gt;\n&gt; You can;t conslusively test for correctness in a concurrent system..\n&gt; at least I ready that somewhere not too long ago.. but it might have\n&gt; been online.\n\nIt is exceedingly difficult to test for _correctness_ in any program.\n20,000 line proofs of 20 line programs come to mind.\n\nHowever, I find it soothing to write JUnit tests about Java programs;\nit helps clarify my thinking and helps me feel more confident that\nprograms are correct.  But there doesn&#39;t seem to be any natural\nway to extend JUnit&#39;s set of assertions to make them useful in a\nmultithreaded context.  Everything that I have seen so far starts by\ngetting rid of the multithreadedness.  There is a fairly well-known\nMultiThreadedTestCase, for example, that says something like &quot;first you\nget all the threads to stop ...&quot;\n\nThe question is whether you can make meaningful assertions about a\nmulti-threaded context without stopping the threads.  I suppose that\nyou might begin by trying to define a\n\n\tpublic class ThreadedTestCase extends TestCase, Thread\n\nand then a set of assertions that are natural in this context, perhaps\nsomething like\n\n\tassertNotSimultaneouslyActive(p1, p2, event1, event2)\n\nmeaning that threads p1 and p2 were at no time simultaneously active\nbetween event1 and event2.  The trick is to define a useful set of\nassertions.  JUnit is popular in part because its set of assertions\nabout single-threaded things is well-chosen (and in part because it\ndoes so much housekeeping for you).\n\nI have looked at quite a few large open source programs recently.\nUsually they don&#39;t test their multi-threaded bits at all, and often the\ncode looks seriously in need of testing; it looks very buggy, in fact.\nBut there are no tools out there to do the testing with.\n\n--\nJim Dixon  jdd@...   tel +44 117 982 0786  mobile +44 797 373 7881\n\n\n",
