Are you worried that you are<br/>\n&gt;  building test suites incorrectly or that the test runners are broken? <br/>\n&gt; Or<br/>\n&gt;  is it something else?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There are all sorts of reasons that things might not get executed. For <br/>\none thing, I am not using the TestRunner functionality. It is not, <br/>\nactually, a requirement when using junit.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, also, if I am going to set up something that is going to run <br/>\nautomatically for some period of time, then I will carefully check to <br/>\nconfirm that it is doing exactly what I think it is doing, at least <br/>\nonce.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems easy enough to add a method in junit that takes an <br/>\nOutputStream and writes verbose output to that stream.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is sort of on general principals. If you are writing a framework, <br/>\nthere needs to be a way to run the framework for maximum transparency, <br/>\nas well as a way to run them most efficiently.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  &gt; I have implemented a trivial over-ride of assertTrue(message,<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; condition) that checks a flag and, if debugging, calls the super and<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; than logs &quot;PASS: &quot;+message.<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; But it seems that one should be able to call all the assert methods <br/>\n&gt; in<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; a verbose mode and get the output.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Nope. You&#39;re the first person I&#39;ve seen on this list who wanted this<br/>\n&gt;  feature.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; Is there a reason this rather simple extension is not in the junit<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; classes?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Yep.
