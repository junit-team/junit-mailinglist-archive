JUnit won&#39;t have an opportunity to catch\nthis.\n\nThere was a rather lengthy discussion about Assertions\nand JUnit in the extremeprogramming group and about\nhow to test Assertions, or whether Assertions are unit\ntests that should be written in JUnit.\n\nSorry if this has already been posted.\n\nAs for catching the Error within JUnit, I&#39;m not sure\nhow you would do this, or if you would want to.\n\nCheers,\n\nTom\n\n\n--- Nathan Paris &lt;nathan.paris@...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt; That isn&#39;t the problem.  The exception IS being\n&gt; thrown, but JUnit isn&#39;t\n&gt; catching it so it is killing JUnit.  \n&gt;  \n&gt; Theodore I will look into what you are suggesting. \n&gt; I actually have\n&gt; already found a work around, but I am know more\n&gt; interested in\n&gt; understanding what was causing the problem for\n&gt; further use.  \n&gt;  \n&gt; Thanks\n&gt;  \n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Eric Heikkila [mailto:ericheikkila@...] \n&gt; Sent: Monday, March 18, 2002 8:14 PM\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: Re: [junit] Re: Get AssertionFailedError\n&gt; when assert from\n&gt; another thread.\n&gt;  \n&gt; hmmm...there is information about that in the FAQ\n&gt; from\n&gt; the www.junit.org website.  Usually when I&#39;m testing\n&gt; that an exception is supposed to be thrown, I&#39;ll do\n&gt; something like:\n&gt; \n&gt; public void testExceptionThrown() {\n&gt;    try {\n&gt;       MyClass.methodThatThrows();\n&gt;       fail(&quot;Should have thrown MyClassException&quot;);\n&gt;    } catch (MyClassException myClassException) {\n&gt;    }\n&gt; }\n&gt; \n&gt; The website mentions that, and also an exception\n&gt; test\n&gt; case, but I haven&#39;t used that yet.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Eric\n&gt; \n&gt; --- nsparis &lt;nathan.paris@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Let me make it clearer...The exception is thrown,\n&gt; &gt; which is what is \n&gt; &gt; suppose to happen, but instead of being printed\n&gt; out\n&gt; &gt; in JUnit it \n&gt; &gt; crashes JUnit.  I.e. JUnit isnt automatically\n&gt; &gt; catching it and \n&gt; &gt; flagging it as an error for the test case.  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; What do I need to change so that JUnit catches the\n&gt; &gt; exception and \n&gt; &gt; reports it as an error?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In junit@y..., &quot;nsparis&quot; &lt;nathan.paris@l...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; In one of my tests I start a thread that will\n&gt; call\n&gt; &gt; update() when it \n&gt; &gt; &gt; is done.  In the Update I check the results.  \n&gt; If\n&gt; &gt; an \n&gt; &gt; &gt; assert it called because something isnt correct,\n&gt; I\n&gt; &gt; get the \n&gt; &gt; Exception:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; junit.framework.AssertionFailedError: &quot;Message I\n&gt; &gt; had in the assert \n&gt; &gt; &gt; stmt.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Is there something different I need to do when I\n&gt; &gt; am running threads \n&gt; &gt; &gt; in my tests?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; Yahoo!
