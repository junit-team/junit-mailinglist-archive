In the past, although<br/>\n&gt; under-documented, the policy has been that the order in which test<br/>\n&gt; methods within a test class are run is undefined. In practice, it has<br/>\n&gt; been left to the JDK implementation, which has usually ended up<br/>\n&gt; meaning the tests are run in bytecode order, and almost always been a<br/>\n&gt; stable ordering.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; JDK 7 (and, I believe, upcoming releases of JDK 6) changes this, by<br/>\n&gt; having the methods returned from reflective queries in essentially<br/>\n&gt; random order.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It will always be my belief that proper use of JUnit results in test<br/>\n&gt; methods whose passing or failure does not depend on ordering. That<br/>\n&gt; said, it can be very frustrating to have a test break because the JDK<br/>\n&gt; selected a particular random ordering, and then have little or no tool<br/>\n&gt; support in recreating the order that triggers the failure.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So, accepting this patch will mean that the ordering of methods will<br/>\n&gt; no longer change from run to run, even if you change or upgrade JDKs.<br/>\n&gt; Unfortunately, it may change the ordering once--if we put this change<br/>\n&gt; into 4.11, say, then teams using current versions of JDK 6 that<br/>\n&gt; upgrade from 4.10 to 4.11 may find their tests now running in a<br/>\n&gt; different stable ordering than before. I think this is a small price<br/>\n&gt; as a one-time cost.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; More disconcerting to me would be if I started seeing test cases with<br/>\n&gt; method names like aaaRunMeFirst.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thoughts?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; David Saff<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nsimonpeter.org | simonpeter.com | newlife-upc.org<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>",
