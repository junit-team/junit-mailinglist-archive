It has also supplied us with a family of unit testing frameworks\nto assist with this task. Unit testing, however, takes effort and skill to\ndo well, especially for applications such as distributed systems.\n\nUnit testing code is at the core of developing high-quality software, but\nis not widely understood in practice, and is too important to defer to the\nend of a project. It serves a very different purpose when used as part of\nTest-Driven Development, rather than a practice for reducing errors in\nexisting code. We&#39;re still discovering new techniques and practices, and\nfind there&#39;s lots of scope for discussion and dissension.\n\nThis workshop is one of a series concerned with bringing together and\nsharing experience between people who have experience of unit testing of\nsoftware, particularly for Test-Driven Development.\n\nThe workshop will serve not only as a meeting point to exchange ideas about\nunit testing, but also as a &quot;matchmaking&quot; event between people with testing\nquestions/problems and people with solutions. In this sense, the workshop\nwill focus highly on the social interaction component. We would like to use\nvarious   games and techniques to keep the atmosphere light and easy-going,\nand to avoid inhibiting participants who would otherwise be shy about\nsharing their problems and fears.\n\nParticipants are requested to submit a short position paper (2-3 pages)\ndetailing their experience with unit testing, and illustrating what they&#39;ve\ndone to expand the boundaries of unit testing. Typical examples would\ninclude extensions to the xUnit testing framework, automating tests etc.\nThe organizers will accept position statements based on originality,\nrelevance and suitability for discussion.\n\nPlease mail your submissions (preferably in PDF) to Joseph Pelrine\n(jpelrine@...) by August 26.\n\n--\nJoseph Pelrine\nMetaProg GmbH\nEmail: jpelrine@...\nWeb:   http://www.metaprog.com\n\n&quot;If you don&#39;t live on the edge, you&#39;re taking up too much space&quot; -\nDoug Robinson\n\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
