If I try to\nmake one Junit test for one of our existing classes, I end up either (a)\nputting a lot of code in the setup() method that gets used by only some of\nthe test methods or (b) not using the setup() and teardown() at all since\nthe data setup is completely different for each method to test. Plus there\nis other problems with not being familiar with the class and the large\namounts of database setup that has to occur.\n\nIs the intention of each Junit test to test one CLASS?  And if so, should\neach method in a Junit class correspond to a test of one public method in\nthe class it is testing?  I think this is the case, but our existing code\ndoes not lend itself easily to this.  So I take it that (a.) all classes\nshould be designed so that they can be unit tested with ONE testcase (b.)\nwhere all the code in the setup() and teardown() are useful for each of the\ntest methods in the class and (c.) there should be ONE test method\ncorresponding to each public method in the class being tested?\n\nAssuming the above is true, how would I test the following:  If I have one\ntest method for the constructor, and one test method for each of the methods\nthat act on that constructed object, the setup() and teardown() code becomes\nreally ugly because I need to setup data (requires A LOT of database setup)\nfor the constructor and I need to use the constructor method itself for the\nsetup() to test the other methods.\n...I think the answer is that I should not test that constructor in that\nunit test, and instead I should have a completely different unit test for\nthe creation of the object (it would be a unit test of a Factory object)?\n\n\nIs there ever a VALID case when a one-to-one correspondence of\nclass-to-unit-test should not make sense?  Can you ever make a properly\ndesigned class that would require 4 or 5 completely different unit tests?\nIf so, these 4 or 5 tests sound like functional tests rather than &#39;unit&#39;\ntests, and does this tell me that my class wasn&#39;t defined correctly in the\nfirst place, and that I need to &#39;refactor&#39; it?\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: ghouston@...

This happens because the classes were\noriginally developed without Unit Testing in mind.  For a class to be\neasy to test, it needs to follow good Object Oriented Design\npractices where the class is well encapsulated and has little\ncoupling with other classes.\n\n[Note:  I&#39;ve also seen Unit Testing improve the design.  Making the\nclasses testable makes for better encapsulation and lower coupling]\n\nPutting Unit Tests on existing code can get very ugly.  Some classes\nmay not be worth Unit Testing until they are first refactored into\nsomething more easily tested.  This refactoring is beneficial but\ncostly.  You will have to make the cost-benefit determination to see\nif you should Unit Test the difficult code, refactor it, defer it.\n\n\n\n\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\njunit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n\n\nYour use of Yahoo!
