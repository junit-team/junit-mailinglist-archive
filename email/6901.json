I can&#39;t do<br/>\npaper lists as I usually lose or damage them  somehow, and my mental list<br/>\ncan easily become lost ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nI do realise though that this means I do have to mentally block out the red<br/>\ntests/suites that are just those  not implemented, from those that are<br/>\nfailing.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe JUnit could be enhanced to have Amber tests for these situations?<br/>\n<br/>\nGreen: Test passes<br/>\nAmber: Test fails as it isn&#39;t implemented<br/>\nRed:   test fails<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do people think?<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Ilja Preuss [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:preuss@...\">preuss@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: 07 February 2003 14:03<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:testdrivendevelopment@yahoogroups.com\">testdrivendevelopment@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: AW: [TDD] Re: Test-first in less iterative organizations<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRon Jeffries wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; However, unlike some other practitioners, I almost never write down any<br/>\n&gt; notes about tests I want to remember for possible implementation.<br/>\n&gt; I have no<br/>\n&gt; physical scratchpad, and generally do not perceive myself to be working<br/>\n&gt; through some list. Surely there is some of that but my perception is much<br/>\n&gt; more that once one test is done, the next becomes obvious.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s possible that I have more of a list in my head than I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; aware of. It&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; also possible that with a century of experience and a highly intuitive and<br/>\n&gt; interrupt-driven style of thinking, things just &quot;come&quot; to me. Still, I<br/>\n&gt; perceive nothing very &quot;scratchpad&quot; about the way I think, and I use no<br/>\n&gt; physical forward-looking list at all.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That aligns with my experience - I typically have some rough ideas about<br/>\nwhat I probably will need to test, but I don&#39;t write them down. It&#39;s mainly<br/>\nthe state of the production code which motivates my next test, not a<br/>\npredetermined list.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have the suspicion that this is very individual; there is a programmer I<br/>\nmuch like to pair with because of her very different way of thinking -<br/>\npossibly having a test list written down could smooth pairing sessions here.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards, Ilja<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:testdrivendevelopment-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">testdrivendevelopment-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!
