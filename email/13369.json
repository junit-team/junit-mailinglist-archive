And - I&#39;ve<br/>\nordered JUnit Recipes from Amazon.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving just started with JUnit and with the idea of writing tests for<br/>\nall of my code, I must say that I&#39;m delighted with the results.  Oh -<br/>\nI&#39;m not writing much new code.  Most of the unit tests are for code<br/>\nthat already exists for which I&#39;m fixing bugs.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere isn&#39;t much support for tests on my team because we tend to be in<br/>\nfire-fighting mode all the time. So, of course, we&#39;ll right good tests<br/>\n&quot;later&quot;.  However, the tests have helped me much more than I would<br/>\nhave expected with:<br/>\n<br/>\n* developing a faster, deeper understanding of the code I&#39;m working with<br/>\n<br/>\n* improving the design of existing code (so that I can actually test something!)<br/>\n<br/>\n* giving me the confidence to make changes and knowing that I&#39;m not<br/>\nbreaking related code<br/>\n<br/>\n* thinking more deeply about what I&#39;m doing<br/>\n<br/>\nI really can&#39;t imagine going back to not writing tests.  Now the thing<br/>\nI need to do next is figure out how to build support for running a<br/>\nsuite of tests as part of our build process and getting our other<br/>\ndevelopers to create and run tests, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you all again -<br/>\n<br/>\nChris<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 4/26/05, Jason Rogers &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jacaetevha@...\">jacaetevha@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On Tuesday 26 April 2005 17:40, in a message called Re: [junit] a test<br/>\n&gt; pattern ?, Adam Wildavsky wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; J.
