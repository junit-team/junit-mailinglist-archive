Ideally I&#39;d like to do \ndeep measurements that follow a complete object graph. For example, you \nmight measure that the total memory used by a list and all its members \nwere less than 100K. However, even being able to reliably measure the \nshallow memory usage of an object without following an object graph \nmight be useful.\n\nIt seems to me that the issue here is not so much writing the test as it \nis measuring the memory. i.e. one would really need to hook into the \nvirtual machine at a fairly deep level. Java doesn&#39;t seem to expose this \ninformation at a high level. I&#39;ve looked at the various profiler APIs, \nbut they seem to assume you&#39;re writing your code in C, not Java.\n\nAny ideas?\n\n-- \nElliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nXML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim\n\n",
