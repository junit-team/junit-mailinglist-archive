But\n&gt; I do think that I as a programmer should be willing to make changes in\n&gt; production code for the sake of testability.\n\nEngineering (at least for chip design) has the concept of testability,\nand electronic designs definitely have features (e.g., extra inputs and\noutputs) that are there only to make things testable.  There&#39;s also the\nconcepts of controllability and observability.\n\nOf course, in software, we could always(?) use debuggers and emulators \nto get controllability and observability, but sometimes changes to \nenhance testability are reasonable.\n\n\nDaniel\n\n\n",
