Not <br/>\nto mention all the interop, system , RAS and performance test that needs <br/>\nto be done in addition to the basic feature test.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can never possibly test all of them. Otherwise, you will never <br/>\ndeliver any product. If you able to do it, then I&#39;ve to assume that the <br/>\nproduct consists of only 1 to 10 classes and not more than 5-10 public <br/>\nmethods, and even for that the # of tests to cover all combination is huge.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, the reality is that there will always be some code, which is run in <br/>\nsome combination, which has not been tested. It is the job of the <br/>\nproduct Dev and QA architect, and leads to judiciously choose the right <br/>\nset of tests which provide maximum coverage (note, I don&#39;t mean code <br/>\ncoverage, as high code coverage can give a false sense of security).<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t believe in extremes like &quot;No tests&quot; or &quot;tests every possible <br/>\ncombination&quot;. There is a middle ground which practical people realize <br/>\nand strive to achieve.<br/>\n<br/>\npeace,<br/>\n<br/>\n--Vishal<br/>\n<br/>\nJ. B.

Or, that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; is only a theoretical existence, since you can&#39;t know such code <br/>\n&gt; exists,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; until you test it, even if only by using it.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; You can, because if it doesn&#39;t work, your users will let you know.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My point: that means you&#39;re forcing your users to test it, rather than<br/>\n&gt; testing it yourself.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; It&#39;s a fairly common occurrence, in my experience, and the reason <br/>\n&gt; behind<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; comments earlier: if other circumstances warrant it, it&#39;s okay <br/>\n&gt; to write<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; code, ship it and write the tests later.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If it doesn&#39;t have to work, that&#39;s fine.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; It does, otherwise the company will shut down.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I can swing a dead cat and hit 10 companies that make money on software<br/>\n&gt; that doesn&#39;t work.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To avoid this conversation looping endlessly, let me summarize my view:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; * Not all software in use works<br/>\n&gt; * There are many users that somewhat successfully use software that<br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t work<br/>\n&gt; * There are many companies that stay in business in spite of the fact<br/>\n&gt; that the software they produce doesn&#39;t work<br/>\n&gt; * Over several decades, we as an industry have trained users to be<br/>\n&gt; satisfied with shit software, so when they get decent software (that is,<br/>\n&gt; not tested, but works fairly well), they are delighted<br/>\n&gt; * I think this state of affairs is holding us back from really doing<br/>\n&gt; Good Work with software<br/>\n&gt; * A well-run business that produced great software could kill,<br/>\n&gt; especially after Mr Gates exits from Microsoft (I couldn&#39;t resist that<br/>\n&gt; last bit)<br/>\n&gt; * Therefore, I do my part by trying to produce great software, instead<br/>\n&gt; of software that isn&#39;t quite shit; I try to surround myself with people<br/>\n&gt; who can build a well-run business<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I hope that does it.<br/>\n&gt; -- <br/>\n&gt; J.
