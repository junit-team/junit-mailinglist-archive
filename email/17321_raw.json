TDD\n&gt; can be a big waste of time.\n&gt;\n&gt; Here is why.\n&gt;\n&gt; With test first, you have something like: Test v1, Code v1, Test v2,\n&gt; Code v2, Test v3, Code v3.  Check in.\n&gt;\n&gt; If you postpone your testing a bit, you have: Code v1, Code v2, Code\n&gt; v3, Test v3, Commit.\n&gt;\n&gt; The latter approach will get you to your goal much faster.\n\nTaken to the next level, this is the kind of reasoning that leads to\nphase-based SW dev. schedules rather than iterative ones.  On paper,\nit looks like it will be more efficient to write a bunch of code and\nthen test/integrate it at once, rather than do acceptance testing and\nintegration iteration-by-iteration or story-by-story.  On paper, it\nlooks like lots of re-work to test & integrate the code every day\nrather than once every couple of weeks/months after features are\n&quot;stable.&quot;  (It also looks more efficient to do the requirements work\nall at once, to save the requirements people time.)\n\nA phase-based, batch approach only turns out to be more efficient if\n\n  * The tasks to be done are fairly well understood & somewhat\n    repetitive\n\n  * The dominant cost of the work /is/ in the repetitive labor\n\nThis doesn&#39;t seem to hold true with programming, for me at least.  I\nusually find that the dominant cost is in the thinking, learning, and\ncommunication, rather than in the typing.  All that stuff that looks\nlike re-work on paper is actually speeding up my ability to think,\nlearn, and communicate.\n\n\n-- \nJeff Nielsen\nDigital Focus\nwww.digitalfocus.com\n\n\n",
