The reason is t=\r\nhat it&#39;s\nvery inconvenient to have to set run parameters if you just want t=\r\no rerun a\nsingle test (in eclipse that&#39;s a run configuration rather than ju=\r\nst\nrightclicking on a test in the runner). If JUnit instead would look for =\r\na\nstandard property-file or similar (like junit-rules.properties in the roo=\r\nt\nof your class-path and merge all found resources found like\ngetClass().ge=\r\ntClassLoader().getResources(&quot;/junit-rules.properties&quot;) then it\nwould just w=\r\nork with no external configuration like launch parameters or\nscript paramet=\r\ners.\n\nWith VM-parameters I don&#39;t see that the feature would be useful for a=\r\nnything\nthat influences the testrun, just for collecting information about =\r\nthe run.\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------\nJoakim Ohl=\r\nrogge\nAgical AB\nV=E4sterl=E5nggatan 79, 2 tr\n111 29 Stockholm, SWEDEN\n\nMobi=\r\nle: +46-708-754004\nBlog: johlrogge.wordpress.com\nE-mail: joakim.ohlrogge@ag=\r\nical.se\n\n\nOn Sat, Dec 5, 2009 at 8:46 PM, Bogdan &lt;\nbogdan.mocanu.notificati=\r\nons@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi guys,\n&gt;\n&gt; thank you very much for your resp=\r\nonses.\n&gt;\n&gt; I didn&#39;t know about the RunListener, so I will definitely take a=\r\n look at\n&gt; it, and come back with an answer regarding it.\n&gt;\n&gt; What I was th=\r\ninking about the global rules is to be able to configure\n&gt; something like g=\r\nlobal rules, that are specified as a startup parameter (read\n&gt; Java option)=\r\n when starting the test (in the project at my office, we have\n&gt; like 750 te=\r\nsts, and therefore would work just nice to configure this option\n&gt; just for=\r\n my env; probably the RunListener will work just like that, so as I\n&gt; said,=\r\n I will read about this).\n&gt;\n&gt; I was thinking about something like this:\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n java\n&gt; -Djunit.globalRules=3Dcom.test.myrules.SomeNiceRule,com.test.myrule=\r\ns.SomeNiceRule2\n&gt; ..........\n&gt;\n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; Bogdan\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In junit@yahoog=\r\nroups.com &lt;junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt;, &quot;Bogdan&quot;\n&gt; &lt;bogdan.mocanu.notification=\r\ns@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi everyone,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; as we have it currently, we can =\r\nplace a Rule in a test, and that rule\n&gt; will be activated for that test. To=\r\n have the rule working in several tests,\n&gt; you have to place the Rule in ea=\r\nch test.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; However, I am searching for a way to activate a Rule for a=\r\nll the tests\n&gt; that are executed, without needing to add the rule to each t=\r\nest. Perhaps by\n&gt; specifying a Java property parameter when running the tes=\r\nts (I could also\n&gt; set this as a global Java option, therefore being used u=\r\npon each execution\n&gt; of the JVM).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Do you know if this is possible?\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The reason why I need this, is: I am making the plans and gathering=\r\n the\n&gt; ideas for creating a simple Swing application that will display the =\r\nresults\n&gt; of the executed tests (just like the JUnit view in Eclipse/Idea/N=\r\netbeans,\n&gt; but perhaps with more details, and also available for anyone, no=\r\nt just IDE\n&gt; users). Currently I developed a small agent rule, that you can=\r\n place in your\n&gt; test, and it will report to the console the status of your=\r\n tests (the Swing\n&gt; console runs remotely).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; This is ok, but it mean=\r\ns that you will have to add this rule to each and\n&gt; every test that you hav=\r\ne. It also means that will not be an easy task to\n&gt; disable this rule, if y=\r\nou don&#39;t want it anymore.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Therefore a possibility to enable Rules g=\r\nlobally for all tests I think is\n&gt; the best solution for my case, and also =\r\na good tool to have for various\n&gt; other tasks.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; What do you think? A=\r\nlso, what do you think about the Swing console idea?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Cheers,\n&gt; &gt; Bo=\r\ngdan\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
