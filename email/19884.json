Maybe we are doing things differently.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  One thing that is underemphasized in all of this, though, is TDD&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;  effect on design. When you write tests after the fact it&#39;s easier to end<br/>\n&gt;  up with classes that are rather monolithic.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>True, but I&#39;ve also seen quite a few examples where TDD-written<br/>\nclasses led to micro-design that forced a lot of refactoring to be<br/>\nmade later as the complexity of the software grows.  In particular,<br/>\nthe idea to &quot;do the simplest thing that can possibly work&quot; can be<br/>\ndangerous, because sometimes, you just know where your code is going<br/>\nand it&#39;s safe to start doing things that might not necessarily be the<br/>\nsimplest thing at the moment but that will save you time in the near<br/>\nfuture.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving said that, it&#39;s not very fair to tell you (Michael) about this,<br/>\nbecause you&#39;re actually one of the few people who have tried to tackle<br/>\nthe hard problem (showing refactoring on real legacy code instead of<br/>\nadvocating TDD on a simple container class).<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nCédric<br/>\nAuthor &quot;Next Generation Testing in Java&quot; (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tinyurl.com/yvyxa3)\">http://tinyurl.com/yvyxa3)</a></div>",
