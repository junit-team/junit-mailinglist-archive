A precondition for us is that we do\n&gt; not want to override/extend any internal classes of JUnit. We would like\n&gt; to do it the &quot;official&quot; way. Sadly I could not find any documentaion on\n&gt; this topic. The only documentation I found was the Javadoc for Sorter\n&gt; and Filter.\n&gt; My question is whether there is any best practice for this kind of\n&gt; functionality. When I previously asked a similar question on this list I\n&gt; got the hint that TestNG does exactly what we need. However TestNG is no\n&gt; option for us and we want to or have to use JUnit.\n&gt; In the meantime I developed a testsuite that runs with an extended\n&gt; Version of Parameterized.class and supports the usage of Filter and\n&gt; Sorter based on the current the current parameter value. I tried to only\n&gt; use official non-internal APIs of JUnit. I am eager to know whether I\n&gt; have the same understanding of how to extend JUnit than the other people\n&gt; on the list..\n&gt;\n&gt; You can find Eclipse projects with my experimental testsuite here:\n&gt; http://sourceforge.net/tracker/download.php?group_id=15278&atid=115278&f&#92;\n&gt; ile_id=283395&aid=2008607\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;http://sourceforge.net/tracker/download.php?group_id=15278&atid=115278&&#92;\n&gt; file_id=283395&aid=2008607%20&gt;\n&gt; Best Regards,\n&gt; Robin de Silva Jayasinghe\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n",
