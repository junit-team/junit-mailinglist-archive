Our new lawyers seem to be concerned about the JUnit<br/>\n&gt; license. True, JUnit&#39;s use of Common Public License is unique and sort of<br/>\n&gt; archaic. I don&#39;t know about any other (important) project using this license<br/>\n&gt; anymore.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Right now we are holding our release and getting ready to remove JUnit from<br/>\n&gt; our standard installation. Silly, I know, JUnit is necessary part of any<br/>\n&gt; serious Java development, but there is not much we can do. Except to ask:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Don&#39;t you want to relicense JUnit to some more commonly used license? EPL<br/>\n&gt; would be fine. At least I have not heard any complain about EPL from our new<br/>\n&gt; lawyers yet. Dual licensing to CPL & EPL probably too.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks for reading my post and sorry for bothering. It just make me sad to<br/>\n&gt; see our software being crippled due to artificial licensing constraints.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On behalf of about 800000 active users of NetBeans IDE,<br/>\n&gt; Jaroslav Tulach<br/>\n&gt; NetBeans Platform Architect<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>",
