Two of my books have information that might be helpful to<br/>\nyou. &quot;Test-Driven Development: By Example&quot; shows an example of writing a<br/>\ntesting framework. &quot;JUnit Pocket Guide&quot; talks about the patterns of using a<br/>\ntesting framework like JUnit. It seems to me that the biggest problem in<br/>\nimplementing such a tool is deciding what subset of features you are going<br/>\nto focus on. Both testing frameworks and coverage tools can contain many<br/>\nmore features than you are likely to get implemented in half a year. I would<br/>\nwrite a little tool that combines minimal testing and coverage features,<br/>\nmake sure it works on itself (you are studying computer science after all),<br/>\nand then add features one at a time.<br/>\n<br/>\nSincerely yours,<br/>\n<br/>\nKent Beck<br/>\nThree Rivers Institute<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>] On <br/>\n&gt; Behalf Of ahmed fouad<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, August 30, 2005 1:31 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: [junit] help please<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In the name of ALLAH<br/>\n&gt; I am a student in the final year of computer and informatio <br/>\n&gt; system and  I have a graduation project about implementing a <br/>\n&gt; unit testing tool with code coverage features, the unit <br/>\n&gt; testing tool will be like JUnit testing tool.<br/>\n&gt; please any one can help me in this topic send me <br/>\n&gt; is this a good idea to be implemented?<br/>\n&gt; what knowledge(tools or technology)should we learn to carry <br/>\n&gt; out this project?<br/>\n&gt; what are the problems to implement this project?<br/>\n&gt; Note:we are 5 members and work with JAVA.<br/>\n&gt; please reply me soon and also send your comments about any <br/>\n&gt; questions that I have not asked. </span></blockquote></div>",
