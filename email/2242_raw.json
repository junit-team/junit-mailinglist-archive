B. Rainsberger&quot; &lt;jbrains762@...&gt;\r\n\r\n&gt; &gt;I disagree. Wouldn&#39;t method validate(DataObject) have to either return a\n&gt; &gt;boolean or perform the assertion itself?\n&gt;\n&gt;Not at all. The method is designed as &quot;validate this thing, if ok, let it\n&gt;pass, if not throw a ValidationException).\n\nCertainly a fine design. I don&#39;t know why I didn&#39;t think of that at the \ntime, but...\n\n&gt; &gt;Of course, I assume that you prefer not to have an unsuccessful \n&gt;validation\n&gt; &gt;register as an error.\n&gt;\n&gt;Why not? Your code below lacks the stack trace for debugging (A\n&gt;fail(Throwable) would probably be usefull here). Letting the error go all\n&gt;the way up to the junit framework let me write even simpler tests.\n\nAgreed; however, I find it nice to go on the assumption that a failure means \nmy code is broken and an error means my test is broken. I wonder if not many \npeople find this useful or if I&#39;m overstating how useful it can be.\n\n&gt;Yes, a validation error will\n&gt;show as an error and not a failure in the runner. I personnaly don&#39;t make\n&gt;any difference between those 2. The unit test passed or it busted. If it&#39;s\n&gt;an error, it just indicates to me that an exception was thrown (other than\n&gt;AssertionFailedError) from the test method.\n\nIf that works for you, then certainly you&#39;re in good shape. You are doing \nsomething simple, and until there&#39;s a reason to become more complex, why \nbother? That&#39;s the attitude. :)\n\n&gt;I guess we just have a slightly different way of writing tests. Writing\n&gt;compact tests look like obsfucation to some people while putting lot of\n&gt;details can look like... obsfucation to some other.  :)\n\nAs long as the test communicates, it doesn&#39;t really matter how it \ncommunicates. Of course, it must communicate *well*.\n\nJBR.\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp\n\n\n",
