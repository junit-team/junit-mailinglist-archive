Can I assume that  <br/>\n&gt; junit 4 runners will have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; this behaviour, allowing me to use the constructor instead of  <br/>\n&gt; @Before, allowing fields to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; be final, etc?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yes, this is designed behavior (as is, in your second message,  <br/>\n&gt; releasing<br/>\n&gt; each test object for potential garbage collection after the test<br/>\n&gt; completes). You can trust the runners that ship with JUnit 4 to<br/>\n&gt; preserve it. If you invoke a custom runner, you&#39;re currently at the<br/>\n&gt; mercy of that runner&#39;s writer.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In my own code, I use constructors in JUnit 4 tests, unless I&#39;m doing<br/>\n&gt; something that I want to be visually matched with a particular @After.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Excellent, thank you.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt wasn&#39;t something that I had seen mentioned in the JUnit 4 write- <br/>\nups, and for our suite of 700-odd tests, many of which are functional  <br/>\ntests which fire up the GUI, talk to the database, play media with  <br/>\nQuickTime etc, it should increase stability significantly.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust waiting now for a decent ant task...;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nDuncan</div>",
