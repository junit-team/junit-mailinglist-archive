This sounds like a <br/>\njob for Fit/Fitnesse.<br/>\n<br/>\nwww.fitnesse.org<br/>\n<br/>\nChaudhary, Harsh wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi all,<br/>\n&gt; I am writing tests for a project and I need help on something. I will<br/>\n&gt; try to be as brief as possible.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have about 100 excel spreadsheets that I am accessing via POI. These<br/>\n&gt; basically form the input to my system. Then I take this input and run it<br/>\n&gt; against a component to get some rates. The aim of my test is to compare<br/>\n&gt; the output coming from the rate engine to the output generated by<br/>\n&gt; formulas on each Excel workbook.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If I run tests on all 100 workbooks at once, it takes a long time. And<br/>\n&gt; it takes longer to identify which workbooks have errors on them and why.<br/>\n&gt; So, I would like to selectively run tests on some workbooks only at a<br/>\n&gt; time. One way to do this is to write a Base Test Class which contains<br/>\n&gt; all the test methods and 100 Test classes (each corresponding to one<br/>\n&gt; workbook) which extend this class. Then these 100 classes are added to a<br/>\n&gt; suite and I can then run each test class independently.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The problem is writing the 100 classes. Also, its hard to go on creating<br/>\n&gt; more classes if we need to test more workbooks.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My question is, is there a way to programatically run tests on a<br/>\n&gt; workbook by passing in the name of the workbook. So that, for example, I<br/>\n&gt; can pass in the name of the Workbook and test would run for only that<br/>\n&gt; workbook.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I did some research and it seems like a concept of a Plugggable Selector<br/>\n&gt; might do the trick for me. Its available at:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://junit.sourceforge.net/doc/cookstour/cookstour.htm\">http://junit.sourceforge.net/doc/cookstour/cookstour.htm</a> <br/>\n&gt; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://junit.sourceforge.net/doc/cookstour/cookstour.htm\">http://junit.sourceforge.net/doc/cookstour/cookstour.htm</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But I don&#39;t know this for sure. Has anyone done this before or have any<br/>\n&gt; idea how to do it?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks,<br/>\n&gt; Harsh.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
