B.&#39;s points above.  However, at some\n&gt; points in the past I have been obligated to use class\n&gt; libraries that write to System.out, and which I cannot\n&gt; change.  So, to test code that uses these libraries, I&#39;ve\n&gt; found that I get a lot of mileage out of creating a little\n&gt; &quot;ConsoleTester&quot; helper class, which appears below.  The basic\n&gt; idea is, in my unit test I create a ConsoleTester, then\n&gt; exercise the code I want to test, then get the output that\n&gt; was written to System.out from the ConsoleTester and make assertions\n&gt; about it. \n&gt; \n&gt; Again, please do not misunderstand:  I don&#39;t like this\n&gt; approach.  In my own code, I do not write to System.out, and\n&gt; I recommend that others avoid doing so as well.\n\nWe once had the requirement that there is *no* output on the console\n(but there was). We used a similar approach to write a failing test and\nthen replaced all System.out&#39;s with logging until the test passed...\n\nRegards, Ilja\n\n\n",
