    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1187642823\">Just to clarify: the tool I was creating checks files/directories.  I know the file system works, but does the application have the correct logic to walk the directories and select the right files.  Some of the unit tests were robustness tests, driving the need for a number of different files (still checking program logic).  \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nI needed to create a known set of files and directories to test one of the methods.  There were a number of tests.  I agree, there is no technical reason to not create/destory the file/directories each time, other than I sometimes work on an older computer that is slow.  The time to create/destory an interesting set of directories and files takes time on the slow machine and I like to run the tests after each change to the code.  (I have gotten used to a fast desktop machine which may be driving my behavior...)\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nCould some of the test cases be integration tests, of course.  This is a small home project with one developer and I have used Junit to test both methods and the application since Junit solves all my testing needs for this application.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\njeb\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">  --- On Sat 05/31, J.

I want a know set of directories and files (and&lt;br&gt;&gt;for a backup tool the dates).  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why test that the file system works? Just verify that you generate the appropriate file and directory paths. The file system works.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;I don&#39;t see the value in setup/teardown for&lt;br&gt;&gt;each unit test.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;...then you&#39;re not doing TDD or Programmer Tests. That&#39;s not an accusation, but rather an observation. Programmer Tests should be fast, independent and focus on logic rather than data. You&#39;re probably doing integration tests with data sources and front end applications, in which case you&#39;d like to do setup and teardown less often.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;I would like junit to support a onetime setup/teardown for some types of&lt;br&gt;&gt;tools, although it is possible I would get lazy and use in when I&lt;br&gt;&gt;shouldn&#39;t. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;JUnit supports one-time setup/teardown with TestSetup.
