Excess complexity\n\nThey make receiving a message more complex, it&#39;s true.  They make  \nsending a message much simpler.  Or rather, they add more lines of  \ncode on the receiving side; but they eliminate dependencies on the  \nsending side.  The benefit of those eliminated dependencies is very  \npowerful.\n\n&gt; 2. No precondition, postcondition, or class invariant validation\n\nI think unit tests are a better way to ensure this kind of  \nvalidation.  However, if you must have them in line, then put them in  \nthe derived classes where they belong.\n\n&gt; 3. Cannot add new methods to an existing interface in a later version\n&gt; without breaking all existing code\n\nInterface Segregation Principle.\n\nElliotte, I think there&#39;s a Ruby programmer inside you trying to get  \nout.  There are no interfaces in Ruby, but all classes act as though  \nthey had them.  Senders have no dependency on receivers.\n\n\n\n----\nRobert C.
