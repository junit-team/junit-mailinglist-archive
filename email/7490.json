And it can <br/>\nprovide many more benefits than JUnit and TDD can offer.<br/>\n<br/>\nLook at that example.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t/*<br/>\n\t * precondition:  dividers[n] != 0<br/>\n\t * postcondition: result[n] == denominator/dividers[n]<br/>\n\t */<br/>\n\tint[] divide(int denominator, int[] dividers) {<br/>\n\t  int[] divisions = new int[dividers.length];<br/>\n\t  <br/>\n\t  for (int i = 0; i &lt; dividers.length; i++) {<br/>\n\t\tint divider = dividers[i];<br/>\n\t\tdivisions[i] = denominator / divider;<br/>\n\t  }<br/>\n\t  return divisions;<br/>\n\t}<br/>\n<br/>\nInvariants would not be used here since invariants apply to the class <br/>\nand not to methods. They can be used for interactions or dependencies <br/>\nbetween methods.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt should be very easy to modify the java compiler to check whether <br/>\nthe implementation obeys the preconditions and postconditions and <br/>\ninvariants. If not, then either the implementation is buggy or the <br/>\ncontract.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs an alternative you can use Design by Contract to automatically <br/>\ncreate test cases (including test data).<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever you use Design by Contract: You save a lot of time compared <br/>\nto JUnit and TDD. And you aren&#39;t driven to use TDD. You are free. <br/>\nBesides this you have a very nice documentation (Contracts), much <br/>\nmore helpful than the JUnit test &quot;documentation&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nThink about it.</div>",
