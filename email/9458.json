If you&#39;re stuffing the event queue, there&#39;s not much you <br/>\ncan do unless JFCUnit has some built-in delays or is slow in and of <br/>\nitself (doubtful).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe bottom line is that eventually, you will have more tests than you <br/>\nhave time, so you&#39;ll need to reorganize them in a sensible way so they <br/>\nare grouped around related code/functionality.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Monday, September 22, 2003, at 01:52 AM, cpac_22 wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m currently using jfcunit (and learning as I go), I&#39;ve got a set of<br/>\n&gt; test cases that working 100% but it takes 6 minutes to run them,<br/>\n&gt; because the mouse is moving slow.
