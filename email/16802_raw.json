As part of that our goal is to never release code that is \nuntested, and we use the available tools to try to accomplish that goal.\n\nI have been reading this thread with interest, and am a little confused \nover the argument.  I liked Bob Martin&#39;s analogy of double entry \nbookkeeping, and this may be part of the confusion. As far as I know, it \ndoesn&#39;t matter whether the credit is put into the books first, or the \ndebit is done first. The value of the practice is that both entries have \nto be done, and both must match. We do some test first, and some test \nsecond, but everything gets tested.\n\nIn fact our model is a back and forth approach. We write a few tests \nbased on a use case, and they fail. We write the code to support those \ntests, and (in the process) write support code to make the test driven \ncode compile and pass it&#39;s tests. Then we write the tests for the \nsupport code, and the tests for the next use case, this leads to writing \nboth the code to pass the tests, and some underlying code, which calls \nfor a few more test cases. These latter tests are driven by the need to \ntest corner conditions in the support code which may not be exercised by \na specific instance of the use-case driven code.\n\nThis back and forth approach seems natural, it reduced context switching \nin the design/implement domain, and seems to work well.  What am I missing?\n\nJim\n\nRobert Martin wrote:\n&gt; On Jun 1, 2006, at 4:35 AM, junit@yahoogroups.com wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; I agree.  TDD is a powerful tool, but not as much as &quot;simple  \n&gt;&gt; testing&quot;.  If a\n&gt;&gt; developer prefers to write code first and tests then, that&#39;s  \n&gt;&gt; perfectly fine\n&gt;&gt; with me.\n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s not fine with me.  In the end, if a developer can show me that s/ \n&gt; he&#39;s got very high test coverage, then I&#39;d accept the effort.  But  \n&gt; I&#39;d also strongly suggest that they write their tests first next time  \n&gt; to see if they don&#39;t find that they get done quicker and with a  \n&gt; better design.\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; The important point here is that this developer needs to agree\n&gt;&gt; that writing tests is part of her job.  At least to a certain extent.\n&gt; \n&gt; I disagree that there is a limited responsibility.  A developer  \n&gt; should not release code that they haven&#39;t tested.  They should not  \n&gt; release a line of code that they have not tested.  Every line, every  \n&gt; statement, every condition should be tested before the developer  \n&gt; releases the code.  It seems to me that&#39;s a minimum professional  \n&gt; standard.  Releasing code that you have not thoroughly tested is,  \n&gt; simply, unprofessional.\n&gt; \n\n",
