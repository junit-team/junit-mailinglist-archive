One of the key<br/>\nreasons is that if you&#39;re using a full featured IDE (JBuilder, Eclipse,<br/>\n...), the IDE will offer your package methods to coders as possible<br/>\nmethods. I think this is one of the problems that people mean when they<br/>\ntalk about &#39;polluting&#39; an interface.<br/>\n<br/>\nComments are an unreliable way of preventing this. Comments get out of<br/>\ndate and ignored too often. <br/>\n<br/>\nDoesn&#39;t changing the methods from public -&gt; private after they&#39;ve passed<br/>\nthe tests means that you&#39;re no longer directly testing the methods on a<br/>\nregular basis? It does, at least, preserve test driven coding. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m mostly relying on my test suite of public methods to confirm the<br/>\nworking of private methods. And not happy about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Fri, 13 Dec 2002 15:16:19 -0000 &quot;Dave Astels &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dave@...\">dave@...</a>&gt;&quot;<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dave@...\">dave@...</a>&gt; writes:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, Henry Stapp &lt;hstapp@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hi All,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; The &#39;how to test private methods&#39; question<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Ah yes... that one.  A particularly tricky one it seems.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Leaving out the backdoor reflection approach for the moment<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Yes, please.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; 1) &quot;pollute&quot; the interface by making methods public that should <br/>\n&gt; be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; private.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;Pollute&quot; is a stong word.  Just because a method is public doesn&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; mean it has to be part of the published interface.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My view is that parts of a class that are part of the &quot;public <br/>\n&gt; interface&quot; and, as such, meant for general use (and that you have <br/>\n&gt; committed to supporting long term) should be defined in some other <br/>\n&gt; way that simple the visibility modifier of the method (in this <br/>\n&gt; case).  I would use JavaDoc comments (and fairly detailed ones at <br/>\n&gt; that) for things that are part of the public interface, and <br/>\n&gt; (typically) no comments for everything else.  Then creating JavaDoc <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; gives you a document that defines the public interface.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Some argue that this is the correct thing to do, but generally <br/>\n&gt; accepted<br/>\n&gt; &gt; principles of good design seem to require making your public <br/>\n&gt; interface as<br/>\n&gt; &gt; minimal as possible.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Yes.  So, to go further than the above... and on reflection a better <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; way, define the &quot;public interface&quot; by making it a Java interface <br/>\n&gt; that <br/>\n&gt; your class implements.  Then make the interface documented and <br/>\n&gt; available.  Clients must write to the interface, implementation <br/>\n&gt; details are irrelavant to them, as they should be.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; 2) Only test the public interface, perhaps giving up detailed<br/>\n&gt; &gt; testing of internal logic.<br/>\n&gt; [...]<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Somehow to me (as an admitted TDD newbie), it just seemed better <br/>\n&gt; to <br/>\n&gt; &gt; be able to bang on these internal methods directly, rather than <br/>\n&gt; &gt;relying on the public methods to access them. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; f you are practicing TDD, you should not be &quot;giving up detailed <br/>\n&gt; testing of internal logic.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; With TDD you define what you need in terms of external behavior, <br/>\n&gt; write a test for it, them implement it.  Finally you clean up by <br/>\n&gt; refactoring.  So as far as your tests are concerned everything that <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; the class has to do IS public.  When I add a new method in reponse <br/>\n&gt; to <br/>\n&gt; a test, it&#39;s public.  When I refactor and extract methods, I make <br/>\n&gt; them private.  That&#39;s the only way I make methods private.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; 3) Make more classes... change the private methods into public<br/>\n&gt; &gt; methods of new simple classes. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; That&#39;s a another approach, but I would only do that of the <br/>\n&gt; functionallity was needed somewhere else.  And, I&#39;d most likely also <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; extract an interface from the new class, and have clients work <br/>\n&gt; against the interface only.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; 4) Make the methods &#39;protected&#39;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I only do this in response to the need of a subclass to have access <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; to somethign that was originally private.. and I try to avoid it as <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; much as possible.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; have your Test class inherit from your<br/>\n&gt; &gt; class under test.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Gawk!  Ack!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;d love to hear the group&#39;s thoughts...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Well, I can&#39;t speak for the group.. but these are my thoughts.  <br/>\n&gt; (Made <br/>\n&gt; them myself).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Dave<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
