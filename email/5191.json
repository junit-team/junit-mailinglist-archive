If it ain&#39;t <br/>\nthe right exception, then the production code is barfing. Barfing is an <br/>\nerror -- different from, say, answering 10 instead of 8.<br/>\n<br/>\n(For those interested in arguing about checked exceptions, first please read <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?CheckedExceptionsAreOfDubiousValue.)\">http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?CheckedExceptionsAreOfDubiousValue.)</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; [...]  any other<br/>\n&gt; &quot;unanticipated&quot; exception would then be an error.  but in practice,<br/>\n&gt; it probably doesn&#39;t matter whether the throwing of the wrong<br/>\n&gt; &quot;advertised&quot; exception should signal failure or error.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Indeed. It may be impossible to tell, or at least too much work to tell, <br/>\nwhether the problem was within or outside of your control. Better to hedge <br/>\nyour bets unless you have a good reason to do otherwise. Cheaper, you know.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; i was trying to use the exception example as a starting point for<br/>\n&gt; discussion about whether failure/error distinctions in junit are<br/>\n&gt; meaningful to anyone.  my experience has been that they are not--<br/>\n&gt; in either case, failure or error, you&#39;re led in the direction of a<br/>\n&gt; solution.  what do you all think?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It depends on the context. When the code I&#39;m testing does not throw its own <br/>\nexceptions, then an error is almost always either a bug in the test or a non-<br/>\nrecoverable problem. When the code I&#39;m testing throws its own exceptions, <br/>\nthen an error could be a bunch of different things. I suppose that, in a <br/>\nnarrow context, errors are useful, but I don&#39;t really distinguish. The nice <br/>\nthing about errors, though, is that they prompt me to look beyond my code and <br/>\nmy test for the problem. Maybe the disk is full. Maybe the network is down. <br/>\nMaybe there&#39;s an eclipse of the sun. An error often makes me think harder <br/>\nabout where the problem might be. That&#39;s usually good.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; this, too, the failure/error distinction and whether it matters, may<br/>\n&gt; be a good FAQ item too?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Mike?<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJ.
