I would expect it to be something more than a way of avoiding that kind of boilerplate.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs an example of the kind of thing I think a class rule would enable, is that it might allow the rule to dynamically pass values to the test class&#39;s constructor based on some dynamic criteria (say a souped up version of Parameterized) or perhaps change the runner that will run the tests, or dynamically disable certain tests (say based on the OS the test is running on). Something that is not possible with an @BeforeClass or @AfterClass annotation.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut that is just my imagination. I&#39;m curious if there are real use cases like that.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, Max Bowsher &lt;maxb@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On 23/04/10 16:39, yme0987654321 wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I really don&#39;t think that is true. MethodRule allows you to do things<br/>\n&gt; &gt; based on the specific test name, and intercept and even replace the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; running of a test. Consider ExpectedException. You really could not<br/>\n&gt; &gt; do anything like that in a @Before or @After method. You would have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to do it inside your test and use an execute around pattern to handle<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the exception.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Your point concerning ExpectedException is valid, but arguing that<br/>\n&gt; method rules are even more useful than class rules does not say anything<br/>\n&gt; about class rules being unuseful.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; For your use case it is a drop more boilerplate than a rule, but all<br/>\n&gt; &gt; you would do is define a @Before method in a common superclass or in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; your @Before call a class that encapsulates the functionality. Yes<br/>\n&gt; &gt; you have to wrap the call in a method rather than defining a field,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; but Java is kind of verbose already.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;Java is verbose already&quot; is not a good reason to make things even more<br/>\n&gt; unnecessarily verbose.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You say I should write:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;     public static MyThing myThing =<br/>\n&gt;         new MyThing(MyEnclosingTestClass.class);<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;     @BeforeClass public static void beforeClass() {<br/>\n&gt;         myThing.begin();<br/>\n&gt;     }<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;     @AfterClass public static void afterClass() {<br/>\n&gt;         myThing.end();<br/>\n&gt;     }<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I want to write:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;     @Rule public static MyThing myThing = new MyThing();<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Personally, I think the second is self-evidently greatly advantageous.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  * Much less boilerplate in each test using the common code.<br/>\n&gt;  * Don&#39;t need to repeat yourself nearly as much.<br/>\n&gt;  * No risk of forgetting the teardown.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Max.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
