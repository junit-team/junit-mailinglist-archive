(The implication is that the solution isn&#39;t really a <br/>\nsolution at all, and the further implication is that I&#39;m just too lazy <br/>\nto solve the problem. I don&#39;t like that.) You stated your problem as &quot;I <br/>\nwant it to be obvious that test 125 failed so that I can ignore the <br/>\nother failures.&quot; You did not state as a requirement that those other <br/>\ntests ought not to execute. What I suggest is a full-blown solution to <br/>\nyour problem as stated. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; However, what about those of us who work with the command-line testrunner?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Build your own test runner that listens for that failure and alerts you <br/>\nspecially somehow. I think that suggestion puts me in the &quot;A&quot; category. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce you have other, more complicated dependencies to deal with, add <br/>\nsome kind of rules engine to the test runner that allows you to collect <br/>\n&quot;key results&quot; -- that is, the list of results you check first before <br/>\nlooking at the rest. Something like that.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
