(example <br/>\nsharing a connection for all the tests). <br/>\n<br/>\nI am currently using static initializers (and some lazy initializing) <br/>\ninstead of TestSetUp.<br/>\nThere are two reasons for this. <br/>\n<br/>\n- one reason is that I have some setup code that needs to run for all <br/>\ntests, this happens in the static initializer of a base TestCase <br/>\nclass. The static initializers of the subclasses run setup code for <br/>\nthe suite. <br/>\n<br/>\n- the other reason is that I want to be able to run individual <br/>\nTestCases as well as the suites and suites of suites.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem is that now I need tearDown functionality .. so am <br/>\nlooking at TestSetUp again. - but don&#39;t want to sacrifice the ability <br/>\nto run an individual test case (particularly for testing my test <br/>\ncode).<br/>\n<br/>\n- any suggestions? <br/>\n<br/>\nI realize that the tests should be independent. and they are as much <br/>\nas possible. but I am also trying to be practical, I am testing ejbs <br/>\nand database operations.<br/>\n<br/>\nmaybe I should be looking at Cactus? or other .. but need a solution <br/>\nin the meantime.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJennifer</div>",
