If TestNG could do it, I \ndon&#39;t see why JUnit team should not do it. Simply follow what TestNG has \ndone -&gt; http://testng.org/doc/documentation-main.html#jdk-14.\n\nThis will really help teams which for a long time will be forced to use 1.4.\n\nIs there an existing bug for this where we can vote for this feature \naddition?\n\n--Vishal\n\nMark Levison wrote:\n\n&gt;Kent (and other JUnit 4 developers) � has any consideration been given to\n&gt;support Java 1.4 with JUnit 4.xx. The use of annotations � could be replaced\n&gt;with doc comments. Unfortunately some of us work in corporate environments\n&gt;where use of Java 1.5 will take at least another couple of years (we only\n&gt;just dropped support for Java 1.3). Can you for see support for Java 1.4 are\n&gt;must we look to TestNG to fulfill our needs?\n&gt;Thanks\n&gt;Mark Levison\n&gt;----------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;Blog: http://www.notesfromatooluser.com/\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;Yahoo!
