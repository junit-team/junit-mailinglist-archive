Additionally (to the &quot;bad day&quot; effect), you might want to rephrase the RTFF, into something a little more tame, but still to the point that we all have bad days.\n\nFinally, I would question the use of &quot;SPECIFIC question&quot; at the end,...maybe just stick with  &quot;If you still haven&#39;t found what you are looking for, please feel free to send your question/query to junit@yahoogroups.com.&quot;  Very often, we have lively/interesting/entertaining discussions that aren&#39;t really formed around a &quot;SPECIFIC question&quot;.  We might end up restricting things too much.\n\n\nmy two cents,\nDianne\n\n-------------- Original message -------------- \nWhat do you think?\n------\nWelcome to the JUnit Yahoo! group.\n\nWe know you want to ask your question NOW, but if you read on, you can\nprobably get your answer FASTER.\n\nPlease check out these resources:\n\nJUnit FAQ                    http://tinyurl.com/a98ah\nTutorials                    http://tinyurl.com/a5h4z\nAsking a question            http://tinyurl.com/anel\nTo unsubscribe               e-mail junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n\nWe continue to have SPAM problems, so your first few e-mails will be\nmoderated.
