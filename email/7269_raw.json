I figured this out\nbecause I setup some a caching object and it seems to get wiped out\nafter every test case class.  I was hoping to not have to go to the\ndatabase and load all of the data every time I run each test case.   I\nattempted to not fork, however, it&#39;s causing all kinds of issues from\nnot forking.  I gave up on that for the moment and then tried putting\nall of my test cases into a suite and just run the suite.  That works,\nhowever, when I do that the html report just has one class and every\nmethod.  I would like to have all test case class run in one JVM and\nhave the test report spit out a TEST*.xml file per class that is run.\n  So my question is what is the easiest solution to this problem?  I&#39;m\nnot if I should take the time to figure out the problems with the\nforking or just write a different XML report formatter or something\ncompletely different.  Thanks. \n\n\n",
