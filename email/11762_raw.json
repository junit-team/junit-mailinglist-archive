When the \n&gt; day comes that weaving aspects is a seamless part of the Eclipse \n&gt; experience, I&#39;ll look into it more.\n\nLast time I looked at it, maybe 6 months ago, ajdt (the Eclipse\nAspectJ-Plugin) came with an incremental aspect weaver which worked\ninvisibly during an automatic build.\n\nJohannes\n\n\n",
