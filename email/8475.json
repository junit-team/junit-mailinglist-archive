    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-148356298\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt;So said areider on 2003-06-24 --------------------<br/>\n&gt;I spend my day (in vaj/wsad) writing small test snippets in a <br/>\n&gt;workspace which answer a result which I open in an inspector. For <br/>\n&gt;these tests, success is measured by what I see in the inspector. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The whole point of JUnit is automate those tests so that you do not have to physically look at the result to verify it. You code what you expect in the test and the test runner tells you whether the results match your expectations. This is in perfect alignment with the purpose of JUnit.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;But <br/>\n&gt;storing these tests in junit has independent value. For one, success <br/>\n&gt;can also defined as &#39;no exception thrown&#39;, which is what <br/>\n&gt;junit would test. (The exception might be an unanticipated error, or <br/>\n&gt;a runtime exception I deliberately throw in the test). The other is <br/>\n&gt;simply the value of &#39;cataloging&#39; and sharing these tests rather than <br/>\n&gt;having them ad hoc in a development workspace. True, I dont *have* to <br/>\n&gt;use junit for that but it fits (except for the return value issue I <br/>\n&gt;am raising).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There are many reasons to write tests this way. I suggest reading the available literature, especially Kent Beck&#39;s Test-Driven Development by Example, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.xprogramming.com\">http://www.xprogramming.com</a> and <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.junit.org\">http://www.junit.org</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Obviously I can wrapper my test methods in a junit method but it is a <br/>\n&gt;waste of time. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If JUnit wastes your time, then don&#39;t use it. If you think JUnit is beneficial, then you have to change your approach to work with JUnit. If you want to do something slightly different than JUnit, then you have to find that or build it yourself.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think those are your options.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Also thanks to Mike for the tip about looking at the code, great <br/>\n&gt;idea. But I dont have any source for junit.jar in the junit3.8.1.zip <br/>\n&gt;file I downloaded from junit.org (also sourceforge), else I&#39;d have <br/>\n&gt;fixed this myself. Where do I find the source distro?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>src.jar<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJ. B.
