They don&#39;t fully test the class.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut they could. Junit does not ensure all scenarios are covered, and tests<br/>\nwritten in main methods can be better than tests written with Junit.<br/>\nThe original poster wanted to know how to convince people to use junit, but<br/>\nthose people seem to :<br/>\n1)already write unit tests<br/>\n2) &quot;get it&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, my opinion is that your use the junit framework to:<br/>\n<br/>\nA-have a standard way of writing and *running* tests. If each developer has<br/>\nit&#39;s own little main class, how does one know how to invoke it, where it is,<br/>\nhow to check for ouput. Of course, they can all be written the same way,<br/>\nstored at the same place, and all return a exit code to indicate<br/>\nsuccess/failure let&#39;s say. But why bother to establish such standards when<br/>\nusing junit gives you all that by default (there is test collectors written<br/>\nfor junit).  With junit, I feel it&#39;s easier for someone to say : &quot;I want to<br/>\nrun all the unit tests of our project before checking-in&quot; like XP mandates.<br/>\nThus, your coworkers gain the ability to easily run the tests of the other<br/>\nworkers.<br/>\n<br/>\nB-It helps automating the process, towards a true &quot;continuous integration&quot;.<br/>\nAnt has already defined tasks for Junit.<br/>\n<br/>\nC-Some stuff often used when testing is in the junit framework. It saves you<br/>\ntime to not have to write your own assert, etc..<br/>\n<br/>\nD-Extension packages : we are starting to see a lot of extensions to junit,<br/>\nintegration with IDE, etc. These are nice to have and altought they<br/>\ncertainly could be used without junit, it&#39;s even simpler with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nE-Gaining some experience with a tool that is more and more becoming the<br/>\nstandard for writing unit test in java is a good opportunity. Your coworkers<br/>\nshould at least try it.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut why do YOU want them to use junit? What is your gain?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf they already have a nice working setup, maybe there is not point in<br/>\nswitching...<br/>\n<br/>\nmathieu<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Jason Rogers<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSent: Monday, June 11, 2001 8:58 AM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [junit] Why bother?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    &gt; 2) My experience is that most people will write a main<br/>\n    &gt; that does NOT<br/>\n    &gt; automatically say, &quot;yes, I passed all my tests&quot;.
