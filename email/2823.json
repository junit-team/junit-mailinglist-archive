    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-981635546\">Preliminary research by me and co-workers indicates that Sun is adding an<br/>\nassertion facility to JDK 1.4.  If this happens the way it says in the<br/>\ndocumentation, &quot;assert&quot; will become a reserved keyword in the Java language.<br/>\nHere is the Sun page detailing the new assertion facility:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/docs/guide/lang/assert.html\">http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/docs/guide/lang/assert.html</a><br/>\nNote that it seems this is already in the beta of JDK 1.4.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe document also details ways of turning off assertions, including the fact<br/>\nthat you must use a special setting at compile time in order<br/>\nfor assertions to work at all:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/docs/guide/lang/assert.html#compiling\">http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/docs/guide/lang/assert.html#compiling</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThe question is whether not using this compile-time setting frees up the<br/>\n&quot;assert&quot; keyword for use as a method name.  My fear is that it<br/>\ndoes not.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis could definitely cramp our style, to put it mildly.  Anyone know any<br/>\nmore about this issue?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nNoah Green<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNoah Green<br/>\nSoftware Engineering Manager<br/>\nThinAirApps, Inc.<br/>\n(212) 343-5032<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:noah.green@...\">noah.green@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThis message and any appended documentation is intended only for the use of<br/>\nthe intended recipient(s) and is proprietary and confidential to<br/>\nThinAirApps, Inc. and may not be disclosed to third parties without the<br/>\nprior written permission of ThinAirApps, Inc.
