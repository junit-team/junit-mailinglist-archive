If those &quot;whims&quot;\nare an expression of good design, then you *should* be prepared to\nmodify production code to fit it into the framework. In the OPs\ncase, they don&#39;t *have* to change their production code to fit into\nJUnit; they just have to ensure that each test runs through all the\nappropriate state-dependencies. \n\n&gt; (note that this claim is different from &quot;write your\n&gt; production code to make it as easy to test as possible&quot;).\n\nAnother claim is &quot;using a test framework may reveal design\nissues in your production code that you may want to fix.&quot;\n\n-- \nChris &quot;electric hedgehog&quot; Dollin\nIt&#39;s called *extreme* programming, not *stupid* programming.\n\n\n",
