A friend said try not to use\nFiles as puts a dependency on the files system.\n \nSo started putting the contents of small files as constants of a String\nvariable.  However for bigger files/non-test files like Excel think need to\nactually pull in a file.\n \nSo my question was how and where do people generally put there data files.\nI know we can read them via getSystemResourceAsStream() etc.  Just trying to\nsee how generally done, e.g. our tests placed in same file, are properties\nplace din a properties file with each test etc.\n \nCurrently run my tests though Inteli J.\n \nGenerally at work the main developers just have a file named test.properties\nin each test folder and they read the parameters from there, but on\nreflection think that gives a dependency on the file system for properties,\nwhich should probably be in the test.  For data files it makes sense,\nalthough I also like the idea of having a data folder for this.\n \nAnyone got an example of a JUnit testcase which uses files?  Just would like\nto see it done elsewhere, as think not totally done correct where I\nwork.....\n \nThanks,\nDarren\n \n\n  _____  \n\nFrom: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of\nBradley, Todd\nSent: 06 April 2007 18:17\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: RE: [junit] Paramter/Data test files?\n\n\n\n&gt; Spoke to a friend who said you should not have properties in \n&gt; a properties file as gives dependence on files for test cases \n&gt; (makes good sense).\n\nYou&#39;ve got to inject your dependencies somehow. We use Java properties\nto do that (for the purposes of test) where I work.\n\n&gt; Are there any classes (out of the box I am not aware of) for \n&gt; reading properties files in the current test case and other \n&gt; files like Excel?\n\nFor the first part, why don&#39;t you just load the properties file into the\nJVM and then get the properties through the regular old Java System\nobject?\n\nFor the second part, maybe I don&#39;t understand the question, but to read\nExcel files into a Java test case, I think POI-HSSF is the way to go\n(http://jakarta. &lt;http://jakarta.apache.org/poi/hssf/index.html&gt;\napache.org/poi/hssf/index.html). But you already\nmentioned POI, so maybe you already know that...\n\nTodd.\n\n\n \n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
