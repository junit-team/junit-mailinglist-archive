(which is on topic.)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The usual suggestions for rewriting the code are offered, such as using <br/>\n&gt; a factory class to allocate/create objects, and always always just <br/>\n&gt; returning the one and only.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I haven&#39;t seen that suggestion all too often. And I agree that it&#39;s not <br/>\na big advantage over a true Singleton (if I understand you correctly). <br/>\nThere still is a small improvement, though: the class itself isn&#39;t <br/>\ncoupled any longer to its singletoness, so it becomes easier to reuse.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, I typically prefer the Just Create One pattern: <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.SingletonVsJustCreateOne\">http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.SingletonVsJustCreateOne</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; p.s. any hints of forums/lists where this topic could be explored would <br/>\n&gt; be greatly appreciated. I&#39;ve found lots of places where rookies can ask <br/>\n&gt; how to use a HashMap, and lots where folks argue about JSRs, but I&#39;m <br/>\n&gt; really looking for somewhere where professional, experienced Java <br/>\n&gt; developers can get answers to hard questions.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I highly recommend JavaRanch.com. Although it&#39;s originally targeted at <br/>\ngreenhorns, we also have a lot of veterans discussing advanced topics <br/>\nthere, especially in the OO forum where your question would be most <br/>\nwelcome: <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://saloon.javaranch.com/cgi-bin/ubb/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=forum&f=9\">http://saloon.javaranch.com/cgi-bin/ubb/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=forum&f=9</a><br/>\n<br/>\n(In fact you might want to do a search first, because we discuss the <br/>\nSingleton pattern quite regularly...)<br/>\n<br/>\nDisclaimer: I&#39;m a Sheriff (Administrator) at JavaRanch, so I&#39;m hardly <br/>\nobjective.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers, Ilja</div>",
