I would like to use it for 100% but<br/>\n&gt; I consistently find automated testing of certain types of functionality<br/>\n&gt; particular difficult to accomplish.  My work is in digital mapping, and I<br/>\n&gt; find complex operations on large data sets problematic.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Let me give a specific example:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am currently implementing functionality to warp satellite images from one<br/>\n&gt; mapping projection to another.  The image is distorted according to a<br/>\n&gt; complex formula.  On a low level, I can test that for a given input my<br/>\n&gt; implementation of the formula provides the result I expect, but on a higher<br/>\n&gt; level I haven&#39;t been able to automate verification of that the final image<br/>\n&gt; is correct.  I have only been able to superimpose the result on a<br/>\n&gt; background map I know is correct and eyeball the results.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I would be curious to hear feedback from more experienced JUnit users on<br/>\n&gt; approaches to testing this type necessarily complex behavior.   I know that<br/>\n&gt; Mock Objects are used to simplify the testing of certain types of otherwise<br/>\n&gt; problematic scenarios, but I have no first hand experience with them and<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t clearly see their applicability in a case like this.  Have others<br/>\n&gt; found that there are certain areas where, in practice, they simply don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; apply JUnit as the ratio of effort to develop the test compared to benefit<br/>\n&gt; gained by the test is too high (certainly the issue of testing GUIs has<br/>\n&gt; received plenty of attention on this list)?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I dislike leaving gaps in my tests, particularly in coverage for the most<br/>\n&gt; difficult functionality, as these are the areas most likely to contain bugs.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; David Olivier<br/>\n&gt; Naval Research Laboratory<br/>\n&gt; Digital Mapping, Charting & Geodesy Analysis Program<br/>\n&gt; Code 7440.2<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
