Cactus uses JUnit. You run Cactus tests using any standard JUnit\ntest runner (the text one, the gui one, ...). JUnit is client side. We\ndecided to use Junit because it is the standard and already has a mechanism\nfor displaying and gathering the test results. JUnitEE provides a servlet\ntest runner (tell me if I&#39;m wrong) that would let you see the result of your\ntest in a browser. Cactus is doing the same but in addition it is sending\nback the results to the JUnit client so that the results can be displayed\nthere. This is nice because you can use any existing junit test runner and\nit will work transparently. You can use the junit Ant task for example with\nno modification. The idea of is to be able to do regression testing (which\nis the main goal of JUnit !). That is to be able to rerun the tests and know\nautomatically if it fails.\n\n- A Cactus TestCase *is* a JUnit TestCase (it inherits from it). However, it\naugments it by adding 2 new methods (optional) : beginXXX() and endXXX() in\naddition to the standard testXXX(). See the cactus doc for details\n\n- Cactus let you unit test the following : Servlets, JSP, taglibs, filters\nand EJB, in a consistent way.\n\n+ much more ... ;-)\n\n-Vincent\nhttp://jakarta.apache.org/cactus\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;kaakaila@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;junit@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Thursday, October 11, 2001 7:09 AM\nSubject: [junit] Re: how to test session beans\n\n\n&gt; hi!\n&gt;\n&gt; I have made some excercises both with cactus and with junitee at\n&gt; http://sourceforge.net/projects/junitee/\n&gt;\n&gt; As I can see after my short experiences\n&gt; Both Cactus and JunitEE can be used to test session beans!\n&gt;\n&gt; 1)\n&gt; +Cactus can test also jsp objects such as request, session etc\n&gt; +Cactus seems to have a very strong project working on it.\n&gt; -Cactus needs to be installed both on server and client which makes\n&gt; it a bit more difficult to use.\n&gt; -Cactus testcases are not standard JUnit Testcases\n&gt;\n&gt; 2)\n&gt; +JunitEE is located in the J2EE server and you access it using\n&gt; browser\n&gt; +JunitEE uses standard JUnit testcases\n&gt; -JunitEE cannot test jsp-objects like request, session etc\n&gt; -JunitEE is a small project (e.g. me). But it is simple too.\n&gt;\n&gt; Please correct me if I&#39;m wrong somewhere!\n&gt;\n&gt; JunitEE project has been very quiet but I like it!\n&gt; I like Cactus too and have difficulties in deciding\n&gt; what I want to use!\n&gt;\n&gt; Kaarle Kaila\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; gopala krishnan T wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; hello\n&gt; &gt; &gt; i would like to know, how to test session beans, i mean is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; there any process or procedure for testing session beans,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; an early reply is appreciated.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; gopal krishnan\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; ..........\n&gt; &gt; Hi ,\n&gt; &gt; I founded a framework for named Cactus testing EJB&#39;s , Servlets ,\n&gt; &gt; Tag-Libs , Filters , ...\n&gt; &gt; It&#39;s a subproject from Jakarta , and it&#39;s based on JUnit\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; http://jakarta.apache.org/cactus\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
