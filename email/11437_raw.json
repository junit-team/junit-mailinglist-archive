But the problem is finding that one important failure in the list\n&gt; &gt; of 250 failures that you got from your test run.\n&gt;\n&gt; If the database connection fails that often, perhaps it is necessary to\n&gt; solve that particular problem.\n\nIt doesn&#39;t fail that often, which makes it even worse, because you&#39;ve\nforgotten what caused the error last time.\n\nBut let&#39;s put this back in perspective. Here&#39;s the situation:\n\n    1. I have a test that I know, if it fails, many other tests will\n    produce invalid results.\n\n    2. In most cases, if I fix only this test, all the other tests will\n    then pass, too.\n\n    3. It may well be possible, us being programmers and all, to explain\n    this to the computer, so that we as humans do not have to do the\n    tedious work of searching through a lot of errors for the one\n    &quot;important&quot; one.\n\nSo which of these two is the correct conclusion?\n\n    A. We should try to find a simple way of explaining this to the\n    computer, so that we as humans save time and effort.\n\n    B. We should forget about improving the current system, and continue\n    to do a tedious search through the manual list, justifying this by\n    coming up with various excuses as to how other things should be\n    fixed.\n\nI suppose this really divides us up into three sorts of people. Those\nwho can find a solution to A, those who can&#39;t and are thus forced to\ncontinue with B, and those who do not want to find a solution to A. I\ncan tell you right now, I&#39;m B at the moment, but I have hope at some\npoint of getting to to A. I invite the rest of you to consider which\nof these types of person you are.\n\ncjs\n-- \nCurt Sampson  &lt;cjs@...&gt;   +81 90 7737 2974   http://www.NetBSD.org\n    Don&#39;t you know, in this new Dark Age, we&#39;re all light.  --XTC\n\n",
