And t=\r\nhen setUp() is run immediately before each test\n&gt; &gt;  method is executed.  T=\r\nhat&#39;s with JUnit 3.8.  I can&#39;t speak for version\n&gt; 4\n&gt; &gt;  as we haven&#39;t swi=\r\ntched yet.\n&gt;\n&gt; Yes, but this doesn&#39;t answer Adrian&#39;s original question... (=\r\nwhich I&#39;ve\n&gt; always found hard to answer as well).\n\n\nPeople who have been o=\r\nn the list a while have seen some good answers to that\nquestion, but I&#39;m ha=\r\nppy to take another swipe at it.  JUnit is built on the\nassumption that you=\r\nr tests are cheap to initialize and run.\n\n1) If your tests are cheap to ini=\r\ntialize and run, then running each test\nmethod on a distinct instance of a =\r\nclass gives the added benefit of ensuring\nthat tests are independent.  I ha=\r\nve several times had functional tests pass\nwhen they should have failed, be=\r\ncause I&#39;ve forgotten to delete a file\ncreated in one test before another te=\r\nst runs.  I&#39;m glad that JUnit doesn&#39;t\nadd in the potential confusion of sta=\r\nte changed in one test affecting the\nnext test.\n\n2a) If your tests are not =\r\ncheap to initialize and run and you&#39;re calling\nthem unit tests, it&#39;s worth =\r\ntaking a look at whether there&#39;s a way to test\nwhat the unit under test doe=\r\ns without expensive persistent state.  Often,\nthis thinking results in valu=\r\nable design insights.\n\n2b) If your tests are not cheap to initialize and ru=\r\nn because they&#39;re\nactually integration tests, acceptance tests, or end-to-e=\r\nnd system tests,\nthen you might want state to persist, trading off safety f=\r\nor performance.\nIn JUnit 3.8, you can use TestSetup for this state, and in =\r\nJUnit 4, you can\nuse @BeforeClass with statics, or you can search Google fo=\r\nr &quot;JUnit\nOneInstance.class&quot;, which will give you a solution allowing you to=\r\n only\ninstantiate your test class once.\n\nThen again, I am in the camp of pe=\r\nople who think that maintaining\n&gt; immutable state in tests is not only harm=\r\nless, it&#39;s actually very\n&gt; useful.  Which is why TestNG will not reinstanti=\r\nate your test classes\n&gt; like JUnit does.\n\n\nIf I couldn&#39;t get my design deco=\r\nupled enough to run my unit tests without\nexpensive state, I might also tra=\r\nde off safety for performance the way\nTestNG does.  With a reasonable objec=\r\nt-oriented language, it seems that\nnever happens for me.\n\n   David Saff\n\n\n[=\r\nNon-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
