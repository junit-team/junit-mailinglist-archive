He has been\ndoing some macroscopic integration testing with the latest\nCVS of a large number of projects including every Apache\nproject and quite a few outside Apache.  He has built an\nautomated notification system when changes to the code base\naffect other projects.  For instance, JUnit is used in a\nnumber of Apache projects, and a recent change forces all\nthe current projects testing to break.  Their test cases\nwon&#39;t compile.  I highly recommend allowing him to add\nthis mailing list (junit@yahoogroups.com) to the list of\nautomatic notifications.\n\nBasically what will happen is that if JUnit fails to compile,\ndue to changes in dependencies of other projects changing,\nthen GUMP will notify you of that change.  Also, when a change\nyou committed breaks other projects, you will be notified.\n\nThe whole reason for this is so that the preferred method of\ndeprecating old APIs is enforced, and changes to the API are\nnot concidered lightly.\n\nKeep in mind this is not a full functionality testing, it is\na build test suite that invokes any unit tests if the project\nhas them.\n\n",
