IMHO, \nthat&#39;s the\n&gt; &gt;most important reason to use asserts.\n&gt; \n&gt; Are you saying you prefer to use the assert or the \nIllegalArgumentException\n&gt; in this case ?\n&gt; In the example I would prefer the Exception, to enforce my \npreconditions.\n&gt; Asserts allow the method to be executed with a negative parameter, \nmaybe\n&gt; resulting in some fictitious value being returned without \ndetection. \n&gt; \n&gt; I see more relevance in asserting assumptions being made about the \ninternal\n&gt; state of an object, (but then you are probably not writing unit \ntests, if\n&gt; you need to do that...).\n&gt; \n&gt; Using JUnit, I do not yet see the usefulness/necessity of the assert\n&gt; statement. Maybe I&#39;m just missing something ?\n\nNo I do not think you are missing anything.  This is what prompted me \nto ask this question in the first place.  When would one use an \nexception vs an &#39;assert&#39;.\n\nif (n&lt;0)\n throw new IllegalArgumentException();\n\nand\n\nassert n &lt; 0\n\nare to me the same thing.  The differences are the following:\n\nthe assert:\n- is more elegant\n- is more useful at development time (as an AssertionError is \ngenerated versus an exception)\n- is more severe then the exception (since its an error)\n- can not be ignored (exception can be ignored via emtpy try catch \nblock)\n- may lead to clear code (I cant prove this yet.. just a hunch)\n\nthe exception:\n- is more standard\n- is more explicit (IllegalArgument tells me the exact problem)\n- better communicated in docs (javadoc picks it up, hopefully this \nwill change for assertions one day)\n\nBut at the end of the day they the look the same to me - just \ndifferent in implementation.\n\nJonathan\n\n\n\n\n",
