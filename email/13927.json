It would be very powerful. I&#39;m having trouble<br/>\n&gt;&gt; understanding what you would use it for beyond what you can do with<br/>\n&gt;&gt; @Before/@After and @BeforeClass and @AfterClass, though. Do you have an<br/>\n&gt;&gt; example?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Kent,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s not so much that I think it couldn&#39;t be done with the existing <br/>\n&gt; annotations, as that it would be more elegant if a decorator annotation was <br/>\n&gt; directly available.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; An example that I&#39;ve got right at hand is a decorator I used to set up the <br/>\n&gt; JNDI space with mock objects, so that the code-under-test had access to <br/>\n&gt; expected resources. I used a decorator, rather than a base class, because I <br/>\n&gt; needed this to be available across several different test hierarchies, some <br/>\n&gt; of which already extended from different sub-class of TestCase. An <br/>\n&gt; alternative would have been to use a duplicated setUp() method. But this <br/>\n&gt; was ugly duplication... Another good example would be for using IoC <br/>\n&gt; techniques on the test itself.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; With the @Before/@After annotations, I could do something similar. But it <br/>\n&gt; would still be duplication that would be annoying. With an annotation <br/>\n&gt; decorator I&#39;d be able to reduce that duplication to a single declaration of <br/>\n&gt; intent.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; More generally, however, I&#39;d like a way to extend JUnit without fighting <br/>\n&gt; it. There are some powerful techniques in JUnit 3.8 that I wouldn&#39;t want to <br/>\n&gt; lose, for example - one such is the ability to programatically create test <br/>\n&gt; cases (see <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://twasink.net/blog/archives/2003/10/junit_and_datad.html\">http://twasink.net/blog/archives/2003/10/junit_and_datad.html</a> <br/>\n&gt; for more on this - or Chapter 4.8 of JB Rainsberger&#39;s &quot;JUnit Recipes&quot;). In <br/>\n&gt; JUnit 4, there appears to be no way to do the same thing; I&#39;d be forced to <br/>\n&gt; have a single test, which read the data file iteratively - needless to say, <br/>\n&gt; this wouldn&#39;t give me the same level of granularity in reports.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In fact, in order to get the same level of flexibility in JUnit 4 as is in <br/>\n&gt; JUnit 3, you&#39;d need at the very least to give an equivalent of the suite() <br/>\n&gt; method - currently, there is no way to change the way that test instances <br/>\n&gt; are obtained. Perhaps a test class could define a TestFactory annotation, <br/>\n&gt; which would default to the TestInstropector?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; (Actually, for the ultimate in flexibility, you&#39;d need to provide a way to <br/>\n&gt; change the runner strategy, too - but that&#39;s probably overkill)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Ultimately, what I would like to be able to do is have equivalents of <br/>\n&gt; popular JUnit extensions, such as DBUnit, ServletUnit, and JUnitPerf, which <br/>\n&gt; are configured using annotations rather than base classes. The annotations <br/>\n&gt; currently in JUnit 4 wouldn&#39;t allow this.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; (Cedric, if you&#39;re reading this... every one of these points applies to <br/>\n&gt; TestNG as well)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I am not sure which ones are not _already_ available ;-). I will pass again through it to check.<br/>\n<br/>\n:alex |.::the_mindstorm::.|</div>",
