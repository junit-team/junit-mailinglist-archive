Something along these <br/>\n&gt; lines: [...]<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Functional testing:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Several options are available based on what your testing environment<br/>\n&gt; 1), 2), 3) [...]<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>For unit testing you would probably want your tests to exercise very<br/>\nspecific parts of the code, and therefore, you want the least<br/>\ninteraction possible with outside objects (see example below).  Patterns<br/>\nlike self-shunt and Mock objects are well suited to this type of testing<br/>\n(search archives for more info).<br/>\n<br/>\nWith functional testing you want to exercise specific test<br/>\ncases/scenarios, within a specific environment.  Setting up a known<br/>\ndirectory structure with jars and checking the results would be a valid<br/>\nfunctional test.<br/>\n<br/>\nLEAST INTERACTION EXAMPLE:<br/>\nToday I ran into a problem reading in files on a Solaris OS.  The<br/>\napplication was running fine on windows, but as soon as it was moved to<br/>\nthe Solaris platform, some records were getting corrupted.  The data we<br/>\nwere processing was a set of Spanish addresses, and contained extended<br/>\ncharacters.  We tracked the problem down to character mapping conversion<br/>\nproblems.  The lesson learnt is:  the problem came from environment<br/>\nsettings.  The actual application worked fine, given the appropriate<br/>\ninput (i.e. Mocking up the InputStream).  The problem came with the<br/>\nenvironment settings.<br/>\n<br/>\nHTH,<br/>\n<br/>\nManuel Amago.<br/>\nmailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mamago@...\">mamago@...</a></div>",
