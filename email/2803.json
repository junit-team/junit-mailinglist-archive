Every time we wrote the <br/>\ndata for a unit test we had to look up the historical figures, or <br/>\ntake out the existing rates temporarily. You know the drill.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe solution was not to make plugging special exchange rates easier, <br/>\nit was to limit visibility of exchange rates to only those objects <br/>\nthat really needed them, and passing exchange rates into them either <br/>\nas method parameters or constructor parameters. This enabled a bunch <br/>\nof other design simplifications that we wouldn&#39;t have seen if we <br/>\nhadn&#39;t forced ourselves to make test writing easier.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m wondering if the OP&#39;s problem isn&#39;t similar. Reading a properties <br/>\nfile is expensive, so we only want to do it once for a bunch of <br/>\ntests. Well, what if you explicitly passed the properties you need to <br/>\nthe methods that need them? <br/>\n<br/>\nKent</div>",
