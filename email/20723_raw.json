Suppose I have 200 test met=\r\nhod in\n50 classes. In this class every test method should be somethiing lik=\r\ne\nthis:\n\n@Test \npublic void launchMissiles() {\n   assumeTrue(A1.canLogin())=\r\n;\n   assumeTrue(A1.canSomethingElse());\n...\n   assumeTrue(A50.canSomethingC=\r\nompletelyDifferent());\n\n    launchMissiles();\n    assertFalse(enemyBase().e=\r\nxists());\n}\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;David Saff&quot; &lt;david@...&gt; wrote:\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; Hans,\n&gt; \n&gt; There is a way of getting very close to what you want in JUn=\r\nit 4.4 and\n&gt; beyond, with assumptions:\n&gt; \n&gt; private boolean canLogin() {\n&gt; =\r\n  // return true if login works\n&gt; }\n&gt; \n&gt; @Test public void login() {\n&gt;    a=\r\nssertTrue(canLogin());\n&gt; }\n&gt; \n&gt; @Test public void launchMissiles() {\n&gt;    a=\r\nssumeTrue(canLogin());\n&gt;    launchMissiles();\n&gt;    assertFalse(enemyBase().=\r\nexists());\n&gt; }\n&gt; \n&gt; This is more general than test dependencies, because it=\r\n allows tests\n&gt; to depend on conditions that are not really tested (for exa=\r\nmple, you\n&gt; might have tests that assume you&#39;re running on Windows).  Will =\r\nthat\n&gt; work for you?\n&gt; \n&gt;    David Saff\n&gt; \n&gt; On Thu, Jul 17, 2008 at 11:58 =\r\nAM, Hans Schwaebli\n&gt; &lt;hans_schwaebli@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Hi Kent,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; speci=\r\nfying dependencies is a little extra work, I agree. But it has\n&gt; &gt; advantag=\r\nes.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Consecutive tests which depend on failed tests, are not execute=\r\nd,\nwhich\n&gt; &gt; speeds up the tests. It also increases the information value.\n=\r\nPeople are not\n&gt; &gt; confused with dozens or even hundreds of failed tests wh=\r\nen just\none or two\n&gt; &gt; tests really failed on which most other tests depend=\r\n. I know of\nsituations\n&gt; &gt; where there are dozenzs of failed tests (or more=\r\n) reported by\nCruiseControl,\n&gt; &gt; and noone looks into them until one week b=\r\nefore release date. This\nhappens.\n&gt; &gt; It makes developers afraid to look in=\r\nto the apparent mess. If\nthere would be\n&gt; &gt; just one or two failed tests, t=\r\nhey would look into it more likely, and\n&gt; &gt; sooner.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The heuristic s=\r\ntrategy would not really solve the problem. since\nit is not\n&gt; &gt; equivalent =\r\nto the dependency specification. It would still run all\ntests,\n&gt; &gt; but the =\r\nlikelyhood that the first run tests are the cause for all\nthe errors\n&gt; &gt; wo=\r\nuld not be very high I think, whereas you could trust the\ndependencies\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nvery much if they are set correctly.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Dependencies are a frequent to=\r\npic. We have it in OSGI, in issue\ntracking\n&gt; &gt; software, in project managem=\r\nent software, in requirement\nspecifications and\n&gt; &gt; in test specifications.=\r\n Why not support it in JUnit tests too?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Well, this is just some qui=\r\nck thoughts about it. This issue alone will\n&gt; &gt; certainly not draw people t=\r\no other test frameworks, but it would\nimprove\n&gt; &gt; JUnit I think. Noone woul=\r\nd be forced to use that feature, but I\nthink it\n&gt; &gt; would be good, if one c=\r\nould use it with JUnit, even in an coarse\nway (for\n&gt; &gt; example if the depen=\r\ndency &quot;testApplicationServerRuns&quot; passed).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Bye,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hans\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; --- On Thu, 7/17/08, Kent Beck &lt;kentb@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; From: Kent Beck &lt;ke=\r\nntb@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Subject: RE: [junit] Does JUnit 4 now support dependencies?\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; Date: Thursday, July 17, 2008, 9:28 AM\n&gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Hans,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I agree that test dependencies are a good idea.
