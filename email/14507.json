Imagine that you have class with one point of <br/>\n&gt; entry<br/>\n&gt; for the client i.e. one public method. You can&#39;t change the access <br/>\n&gt; modifier<br/>\n&gt; of your method just to test it. Wrapping your private method in a public<br/>\n&gt; method is just the same as changing the access modifier. It is will<br/>\n&gt; documented and it works to use java reflection.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The developers in the project I am currently working changed their <br/>\n&gt; private<br/>\n&gt; methods to public just to UNIT test their code. It is currently very<br/>\n&gt; important to test the private methods as it accounts for over 60% of the<br/>\n&gt; functionality and logic. I have found that enables me to test bottom <br/>\n&gt; up and<br/>\n&gt; I have more confidence when coding and when I need to refactor.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have posted the SecureClassAccess.java in the &quot;files&quot; section of <br/>\n&gt; group for<br/>\n&gt; anyone that does want to us it to test their private methods.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The issue is that when it is hard to test something without tricks (like <br/>\nreflective access) it usually means that there is a design with better <br/>\ncohesion out there to discover.  I&#39;d say that if 60% of your logic is in <br/>\nprivate methods, then chances are very high that this is true for that code.<br/>\n<br/>\nMichael Feathers<br/>\nwww.objectmentor.com</div>",
