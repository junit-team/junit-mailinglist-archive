They have to manually<br/>\n&gt; select to use the new version that has just appeared in the repo, and this<br/>\n&gt; way if their tests start failing, they will know that they can either fix<br/>\n&gt; them to work with the new version of junit, or revert to the previous<br/>\n&gt; version.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Interesting.  I was under the impression that it was possible to<br/>\n&gt; simply depend on the _latest_ version of a package--indeed, that the<br/>\n&gt; ability to get upgraded versions automatically was one of the<br/>\n&gt; benefits/risks of maven.  Perhaps I&#39;ve just learned something new.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It is possible, but not very common and not recommended in general, for<br/>\nprecisely that reason. Once you have a code base of a reasonable size, it&#39;s<br/>\nmuch safer to depend on explicit version numbers and only bump manually when<br/>\nthe need arises.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nCédric<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
