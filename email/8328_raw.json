B. Rainsberger&quot;\n&lt;jbrains@...&gt; said:\n&gt; You could also try reading the question. :) :) :)  That looks\n&gt; suspiciously like using a get method.\n\nWell deserved...  I will answer less hastily in the future.\n \n&gt; To the OP, there are a number of ways to answer that question, depending\n&gt; on the actual design under test. If you can give us some information on\n&gt; what the &#39;void&#39; method does, we may have a suggestion for you.\n\nI think JB&#39;s point of knowing what the void method is supposed to do is a\ngood one.  You don&#39;t have to give code, you could give psuedo-code.  In\nturn the answers you receive would probably be much better suited to you.\n\nThe general Observer/Observable pattern that JB referred to is good. \nHowever, that may introduce unnecessary overhead.  Every void method must\nhave some side effect on the system, otherwise it does nothing.  In\ngeneral, you should test for the side effect.  Though I gave an answer\nwith a getter, the point remains the same.\n\nTesting a logger is a good example.  Most likely the interface into the\nlogger is comprised of void methods (eg. debug(Object), info(Object),\ntrace(Object), etc.).  However, that logger must log out to something. \nIf you design it well enough you should be able to attach an arbitrary\nstream to the logger and check the stream for the contents you think\nshould be logged.\n\nFor a code example of testing void methods, you could also look at the\nlast several issues of Software Development magazine where Bob Martin is\ncontinuing a series on Test Driven Development.  As I recall, there are\nsome void methods in the server they are writing that are being tested\nwithout getters... but I could be wrong. :)\n\n=jason\n--\n\n=jason\n[:question | ^One]\n\n",
