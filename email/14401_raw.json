This allows us to see in a \nsimple test run, which values don&#39;t work with the code under test.\n\nI&#39;d either have separate named tests or use the Parameterized Test Case \npattern.\n\n&gt;Cheers, Ilja\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\nCheers\n\nAndrew\n\n\n-- \nNo virus found in this outgoing message.\nChecked by AVG Anti-Virus.\nVersion: 7.0.338 / Virus Database: 267.10.14/79 - Release Date: 22/08/2005\n\n\n",
