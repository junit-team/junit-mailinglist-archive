In my opinion, this isn&#39;t something that can break.  Instead I would test \n&gt;the super class implementation.  On that same note, why do you even have \n&gt;these methods here?  Are you opening up the access level (from default or \n&gt;protected to public)?\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\nAs someone who practises TDD  I would have written the test first, then \nimplemented the derived class.  Then possibly refactored the derive \nclass to call the base class method, then further refactored the derived \nclass to remove the overridden method, seeing as it now does nothing.\n\nHowever, after all of this, I&#39;m still testing the public interface of \nthe derived class.\n\nThen if the derived class is refactored again to do something additional \nto the super class, our existing test will let know if anything is \nbroken. Also, if we refactor the super class because of some need of \nanother derived class, we know whether we have broken any derived \nclasses assumptions of how the super class works.\n\n\n\n",
