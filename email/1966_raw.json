Right now we only have 8 functional\n&gt; test methods, but 170 assertions.  When we add to a functional\n&gt; test we don&#39;t create a new test method, we add some more\n&gt; assertions to an already existing test.  It would be harder to\n&gt; see progress if we tracked test cases.\n\nI&#39;d like to argue against this.  Having many assertions per test\nmakes it more difficult to see where the problem is.  With\nsimple, well name tests it is often enough to see the name and\nknow exactly where to look in your code.  With long complicated\ntests, you&#39;ll probably have to read the *test* again before you\neven start looking in the code.  I also often write several\nrelated tests that build on each other -- if the first fails I\nexpect the others in the group to fail too.  If only the first\nfails, it is a hint that there may be a problem with that test.\n\nI just don&#39;t see a good reason to count asserts.  There&#39;s no\nmagic ratio of asserts to tests that is better than another.  As\nfor impressing the boss with bigger numbers, that&#39;s not a good\nreason to incorporate it into the framework :-).\n\n-- Andrew\n\n",
