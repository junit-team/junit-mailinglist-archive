There is an example in the FAQ but I couldn&#39;t \nfind\n&gt; &gt; out, how to get it running.\n&gt; \n&gt; The rationale of the system is that each test must be independent\n&gt; of others.  That&#39;s why setUp() and tearDown() are called for each\n&gt; single test case. Why do you want to setUp and tearDown your text\n&gt; fixture only once?\n&gt; \n&gt; Anyway, if you really want to do this you can do either of these\n&gt; two ugly things:\n&gt; \n&gt; - Write your own testSetUp() method as the first test method in the\n&gt; class and testTearDown() as the last test method in the class.\n&gt; Pretty ugly, but it should work. I didn&#39;t try it myself, so I&#39;m not\n&gt; 100% sure it will.\n\nif i&#39;m not mistaken, you should never depend on test methods in a\nclass being executed in any particular order.  so you could never\nguarantee that a testSetUp() method would be called first, nor a\ntestTearDown() method called last (short of altering the framework).\n\ntry writing a subclass of TestSetup, whose setUp() and tearDown()\nperform setup/teardown of test fixture once for the Test object the\nTestSetup decorates.  e.g.:\n\npublic class DatabaseSetup extends TestSetup\n{\n  public DatabaseSetup(Test test)\n  {\n    super(test);\n  }\n\n  protected void setUp() throws Exception\n  {\n    // create tables, add rows, etc.\n  }\n\n  protected void tearDown() throws Exception\n  {\n    // drop tables\n  }\n}\n\nthen use your TestSetup in a test class&#39;s suite() method:\n\npublic class MyTest extends TestCase\n{\n  public static Test suite()\n  {\n    return new DatabaseSetup(new TestSuite(MyTest.class));\n  }\n}\n\nor, if it&#39;s test fixture like objects that your test class need to\naccess directly, make them attributes of the test class, and\ninitialize them in the test class&#39;s constructor rather than in\nsetUp().\n\n--p\n\n\n",
