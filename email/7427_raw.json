I&#39;m finding it difficult to get started so I don&#39;t really have \n&gt;a convincing argument for it other than &quot;I&#39;ve read that it is a great \n&gt;thing&quot; :), obviously if I can make it work for me it would help.   It&#39;s \n&gt;good to hear that others have had the same issues and have gotten past \n&gt;them.   The examples make it look so simple and easy...\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\nThey say that to successfully give up a habit, you have to replace it \nwith something else.  How much time do others in your company spend in \nthe debugger or otherwise trying to find the source of bugs?  How much \ntime is spent designing software in a medium other than code that turns \nout to be difficult (or awkward) to implement in code?\n\nMike\n\n-- \nMike Clark\nhttp://clarkware.com\n(303) 589-3812\n\n\n\n\n",
