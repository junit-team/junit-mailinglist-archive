It&#39;s a simple enough thing (I\n&gt;think) that it should not be impossible to do.\n&gt;\nI have studied the pluggability in JUnit and developped a first \nprototype.  What I have done is creating a basic runner that separates \nTextRunner and UIRunner from the JUnit core business.  My experience is \nthat it requires some changes but it is absolutely feasible.\n\nIf you are familiar with the internal JUnit business, here is how it works:\n- the CoreRunner registeres itself as a TestListener to the TestResult \n(in fact there is now only one TestListener)\n- Plug-in modules register themselves as CoreListener to the CoreRunner\n- TestListener&#39;s events are passed to the plug-ins via the CoreListener \ninterface\n- new events (like when the runner starts/stops running the tests) are \nalso passed via the CoreListener interface\n\nNow for the &quot;count-assert&quot; mechanism: I don&#39;t think that adding a \nplug-in is the way to go.  The easiest way is to declare a static \nvariable in the Assert class.  This variable is accessible by the \nCoreRunner and adding methods to handle this variable in the CoreRunner \nobject is not a problem.\n\n-Vladimir\n\n\n",
