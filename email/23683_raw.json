However, I&#39;m still curious to know.=\r\n..\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I think we&#39;re ready to cut a 4.10 beta 1 release from head, incl=\r\nuding\n&gt; &gt; a raft of bug fixes, most notably the fix in the contents of juni=\r\nt-dep\n&gt; &gt; as released to maven.  Of those of you who plan on being beta-tes=\r\nters:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 1) Is there anyone who plans to download the jar directly fro=\r\nm github\n&gt; &gt; for testing?\n&gt; &gt; 2) Is there anyone who plans to set the junit=\r\n version in their pom to\n&gt; &gt; 4.10-SNAPSHOT, and add https://oss.sonatype.or=\r\ng/content/groups/public\n&gt; &gt; as a snapshot repository, in order to test thro=\r\nugh maven?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m happy to support both beta-release paths if it turns=\r\n out people\n&gt; &gt; are using both.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   David Saff\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ----------=\r\n--------------------------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
