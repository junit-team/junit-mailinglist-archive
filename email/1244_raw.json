No one likes the new test browser,\nspecifically the lack of a tree makes it hard to find the test we want.  It\nseems you can plug in your own Test Browsers so is there a way to get the\nold 3.2 version back, but still use the 3.6 version of JUnit?\n\n-tv\n\n***********************************************************************************\nThis message contains information from Silicon Valley Bank which may be confidential and privileged.
