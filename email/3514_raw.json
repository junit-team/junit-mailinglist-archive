In order to\n&gt; allow for the correct comparison of objects in the distributed\n&gt; environment, the decision was made to override the .equals() method\n&gt; in BaseBusinessObject to compare the primary keys of two objects. \n&gt; This allows us, for example, to remove a business object from a\n&gt; Vector because the Vector&#39;s remove() method internally calls\n&gt; the .equals() method.  We obviously can&#39;t compare the objects in the\n&gt; Vector by reference, the default .equals() behavior, because they may\n&gt; be distributed objects and thus wouldn&#39;t have the same reference.\n\nMore to the point, for &quot;business objects&quot;, reference equality is almost \nnever the right &quot;equals&quot; behavior. If I have two Money objects and they \nboth represent CHF 50, then they are interchangeable, aren&#39;t they?\n\nBy the way, not Vector... List. :)\n\n&gt;\n&gt; The problem lies in the fact that we want to be able to\n&gt; override .equals() in derived business objects to compare their\n&gt; attributes by value.  This is of course the way that assertEquals()\n&gt; works in the junit framework.  If we override the .equals() method,\n&gt; then there are implications for methods on collections, such as remove\n&gt; () on a Vector. \n&gt;\n&gt; There are many articles that explain how to write unit tests with the\n&gt; assumption that the .equals() method can be overridden, but there\n&gt; doesn&#39;t seem to be any documentation on how to test an application\n&gt; that uses distributed objects in which you can&#39;t override .equals(). \n&gt; It seems that this would be a very common problem, but I can&#39;t seem\n&gt; to find anything on it.\n\nI&#39;m not sure I understand the problem. Can you show us a test case where \nusing equals() as you have defined it makes a test case difficult to write?\n\nIf you really need to test whether two objects are the same -- that is, \nthe same physical block of memory -- you can also use assertSame().\n\nWe override equals() everywhere to make testing easier! As an example, \nif I have a web service that prepares a Response to return to a browser, \nI can build up an &quot;expectedResponse&quot; object with all the output I&#39;m \nlooking for, then my assertion is simply:\n\n    assertEquals(expectedResponse, actualResponse)\n\nand I don&#39;t have to check the various parts of the response one by \none... that&#39;s the beauty of equals(), I thought.\n\nJBR.\n\n\n",
