Make sure each line\n&gt; executes as you expect it to.  You can find many errors by following this\n&gt; simple practice.&quot;\n\nI don&#39;t think Steve McConnell is right here, but of course that&#39;s just my\nopinion.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I find his advice useful.  It is especially helpful in a debugger like VAJ\n&gt; as you can easily force code into error traps that are almost impossible to\n&gt; induce during testing (like a database going down during a query, or the\n&gt; network failing after you wrote to a socket, or a remote host failing after\n&gt; you connected).\n&gt;\n\nSounds like a useful feature in the debugger.  However, without having\nrepeatable jUnit tests, you&#39;ll not be getting maximum productivity over the life\nof the system.  Having to use a debugger each time you make modifications,\ninstead of having a test suite that tests things like a database going down, or\na network going down.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Donald Holliday\n&gt;\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Matthew Pope [mailto:mpope@...]\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, November 15, 2001 2:58 PM\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: Re: [junit] Anyone know of a decent debugger?\n&gt;\n&gt; For the sake of discussing software engineering, I&#39;d like to point out that\n&gt; it\n&gt; is often less productive to use a debugger. Consider that using\n&gt; org.log4j.Category as a class var in your program, then: (assuming you have\n&gt; a\n&gt; Debug class with a booleans SHALLOW, MEDIUM, DEEP )\n&gt;\n&gt; if( Debug.SHALLOW )\n&gt;     Log_.debug( &quot;got to just after xxx, someVar=&quot;+someVar )\n&gt;\n&gt; Here is a sample out put using Log_.info(..) in a debug run (actually a\n&gt; jUnit\n&gt; test case.)\n&gt;\n&gt; 0 [main] INFO com.popetools.util.Debug  -\n&gt; util.debug.static.OpenAppender(..):\n&gt; log opened successfully.\n&gt; .370 [main] INFO com.popetools.unittest.PersistenceManagerExceptionTest  -\n&gt; testCurrTransWhileClosed passed.\n&gt;\n&gt; The first field indicates the millis that elapsed since the start of\n&gt; execution, and the 3rd field indicates the class emitting the output, and\n&gt; the\n&gt; rest of the line is the emitted information.\n&gt;\n&gt; After you&#39;ve debugged the code, you replace the SHALLOW with MEDIUM, or DEEP\n&gt; considering on the level of detail output it produces.\n&gt;\n&gt; This way, the poor sod who makes a change to your code later, and needs to\n&gt; debug it, already has the important debug state-check points indicated.\n&gt; He/she simply has to replace the MEDIUM with SHALLOW, turn on Debug.SHALLOW,\n&gt; and presto, they can debug your code with minimal effort.\n&gt;\n&gt; In the long haul, such schemes save time and effort.  Using a debugger\n&gt; should\n&gt; be the last thing you do to debug a module.  It takes a lot of time.\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Matthew\n&gt;\n&gt; Carolyn MacLeod/OTT/OTI wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Try Eclipse.\n&gt; &gt; http://www.eclipse.org/\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Carolyn\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Russ Baker &lt;rbaker@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; 11/15/2001 03:10 PM\n&gt; &gt; Please respond to junit\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;         To:     &quot;&#39;junit@yahoogroups.com&#39;&quot; &lt;junit@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt;         cc:\n&gt; &gt;         Subject:        [junit] Anyone know of a decent debugger?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hello,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I have been stuck using jBuilder to debug my code.  Well, after fighting\n&gt; &gt; with the IDE for months now, I have come to the conclusion that, for lack\n&gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; better verbiage, jBuilder&#39;s (4.0) debugger is flaky.  The debugger\n&gt; &gt; constantly goes into code that it shouldn&#39;t, and actually forces me to go\n&gt; &gt; back to using the old System.out method of debugging, how wasteful!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Does anyone know of a decent debugger?  I am currently using the jdk1.3.1.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks in advance,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Russ Baker\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; &gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
