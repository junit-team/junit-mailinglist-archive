    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-643222919\">This is constructive criticism. Please accept it that way. There are several issues with your code, in addition to answering your original question.<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Your comments are useless and actually dangerous. I say this with love. Stop writing silly comments when the code says exactly what it does already.<br/>\n<br/>\nEXAMPLE:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;     // This member variable will hold account balance<br/>\n&gt;     public int balance;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The following is already clear enough.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;     public int balance;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You may ask why this matters. Here is why. In your code you have:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;public class Interest extends Account {<br/>\n&gt;     <br/>\n&gt;     // This member variable will hold account balance<br/>\n&gt;     private int interest_rate;<br/>\n&gt;     private int acumulated_interest;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>THAT COMMENT IS WRONG!<br/>\n<br/>\nYou have just demonstrated the reason why unnecessary comments are not just unnecessary, they are DANGEROUS: your comment and code do not match. Three months from now, which one should you trust? At a minimum, you need to read the code to find out.<br/>\n<br/>\nStop doing this immediately. You will find life much nicer.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Use better names.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;JU&quot; means nothing to anyone, except maybe yourself. I renamed the test case classes to &quot;AccountTest&quot; and &quot;InterestTest&quot;, because THAT IS WHAT THEY ARE!<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Don&#39;t leave empty tests.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou have an empty test in AccountTest. That test LOOKS like it passes, but only because there is nothing to fail. I replaced it with &quot;fail(&quot;Not yet implemented.&quot;)&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n4. One of your tests doesn&#39;t make sense.<br/>\n<br/>\ndeposit() answers the new balance, but withdraw() answers the amount withdrawn. Why have this strange behavior?<br/>\n<br/>\n    public void testwithdraw2() {<br/>\n        assertEquals(myAccount.withdraw(4000), 4000);<br/>\n    } //End of method<br/>\n<br/>\nI changed this test to read<br/>\n<br/>\n    public void testwithdraw2() {<br/>\n        assertEquals(myAccount.withdraw(4000), 6000);<br/>\n    }<br/>\n<br/>\nbecause this behavior makes much more sense, compared with the behavior of deposit().<br/>\n<br/>\nI ran AccountTest. Of the three tests that you implemented, two passed, so I fixed withdraw() to behave the same way as deposit().<br/>\n<br/>\nI then ran InterestTest. Of the five tests that you implemented, they all pass.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince you got the inheritance stuff right, what&#39;s the problem?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;So said balakrishnan sengodan on 4/13/2003 --------------------<br/>\n&gt;Did any one test inheritance successfully, will you<br/>\n&gt;please send me the classes under the test and the<br/>\n&gt;associated testing classes. <br/>\n </span></blockquote>&lt;snip /&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nJ.
