I&#39;ve&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\n&gt;never written one before, and I have nothing here to try this on.&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The problem is the callback may execute in a different Thread than the<br/>\ntestIt method. That means if the callback calls assert(&lt;some false<br/>\nexpression) or fail(), the Error gets thrown, but not caught by the<br/>\nJUnit framework (because it is thrown on the stack of a different<br/>\nThread). Having the callback be within the TestCase is not enough to<br/>\nsolve this, it is not a class problem it is a stack/thread problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe way we wound up dealing with it for our aynchronous callbacks is by<br/>\ncreating way to configure our code to make the callbacks in the same<br/>\nthread under certain circumstances. By happy coincidence this same<br/>\nmechanism is also used to handle many of the differences between our<br/>\nvarious platforms. We run most of our tests against the non-threaded<br/>\n&quot;Test&quot; platform and only run a few threading-specific tests in the more<br/>\ncomplicated environments. Those tests have been much harder to write<br/>\nand I would love good suggestions. Most of them have testFoo method<br/>\nthat end something like this (from memory, probably with typos):<br/>\n<br/>\n  // Wait for asynchronous operations to complete, fail if they don&#39;t<br/>\n  try {<br/>\n    asynchObject.wait(ASYNC_TIMEOUT);<br/>\n  }<br/>\n  catch (InterruptedException e) {<br/>\n    fail(&quot;Aynchronous operations did not complete in time&quot;);<br/>\n  }<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards,<br/>\n<br/>\nRob<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet email at your own domain with Yahoo!
