Some of them have been helpful (ie. the <br/>\none that pointed me to jboss, cactus), althought most of &#39;em aren&#39;t. <br/>\nI&#39;ve decided to go to a bookstore and pickup a book on EJB. I <br/>\nfigured if i get familiar with EJB, it might be easier to understand <br/>\nthe testing itself. <br/>\nBefore, I was looking for a quick solution, by trying to look for <br/>\nhands on tutorial which explains about EJB as well as the testing <br/>\nitself. I guess there&#39;s no such thing out there. most of the <br/>\ntutorial on the testing is assuming that you are already familiar <br/>\nwith EJB. I got frustated after spending so many hours, and not <br/>\nbeing able to get anything useful out of google, and decided to post <br/>\na message here to see if the experts here can offer some guide.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, I must say this. I am really disappointed at some of the <br/>\nreplies out there which really don&#39;t address the real question. I am <br/>\nasking for some pointers on where to start looking if i were to <br/>\nlearn ejb and junit, and the replies that i got are totally <br/>\nirrelevant and unnecessary. <br/>\nI am sure that most of you that hang around here must be <br/>\nprofessional developer with years of programming experience, but the <br/>\nway you guys address a simple question is really out of context.<br/>\nA beginner asked for a hint or two cuz he wants to learn, and <br/>\ninstead of giving some hints, many of you are questioning his <br/>\nbackground, and some even are implying that maybe he&#39;s totally out <br/>\nof place, and should not be doing this; which does&#39;t answer the <br/>\nquestion at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I am just expressing myself, and I hope that I don&#39;t offend, <br/>\nor tick off anyone. I totally appreciate the time you guys took to <br/>\nreply to my message.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Andrew Forward&quot; &lt;milkforlife@h...&gt; <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Scott Stirling said:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;JUnit is suitable for unit testing EJBs if you don&#39;t even know <br/>\n </span></blockquote>how to<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &quot;pack&quot;<br/>\n&gt; a jar file? &quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Just a side concept about that packaging of jar files.
