I suspect your question is too general to answer. \nHave you done some research?\nI know there are articles and faq&#39;s available on testing, so start \nthere. I am sorry I can&#39;t point you to a specific article on testing a \nserver (maybe someone else can).\nIf you want to learn how to use junit for testing have a look at \nhttp://www.junit.org/index.htm.\nHave a browse around the junit-site, read articles and start testing.\n\nIf you really don&#39;t know how to go about testing, buy a book.\nThe TDD-book is good start: &quot;Test Driven Development: A Practical Guide&quot; \nby David Astels.\nYou can find it on amazon. This link leads to information from it&#39;s \nhome-site (source code for instance):\nhttp://www.adaptionsoft.com/tddapg.html\n\nAnd then, if you have a specific problem while testing, people can (and \nprobably will) help.\n\nGuus.\n\n-- \nA.J.
