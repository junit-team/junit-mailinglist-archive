A particularly tricky one it seems.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Leaving out the backdoor reflection approach for the moment<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, please.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 1) &quot;pollute&quot; the interface by making methods public that should be<br/>\n&gt; private.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>&quot;Pollute&quot; is a stong word.  Just because a method is public doesn&#39;t <br/>\nmean it has to be part of the published interface.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy view is that parts of a class that are part of the &quot;public <br/>\ninterface&quot; and, as such, meant for general use (and that you have <br/>\ncommitted to supporting long term) should be defined in some other <br/>\nway that simple the visibility modifier of the method (in this <br/>\ncase).  I would use JavaDoc comments (and fairly detailed ones at <br/>\nthat) for things that are part of the public interface, and <br/>\n(typically) no comments for everything else.  Then creating JavaDoc <br/>\ngives you a document that defines the public interface.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Some argue that this is the correct thing to do, but generally <br/>\n </span></blockquote>accepted<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; principles of good design seem to require making your public <br/>\n </span></blockquote>interface as<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; minimal as possible.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes.  So, to go further than the above... and on reflection a better <br/>\nway, define the &quot;public interface&quot; by making it a Java interface that <br/>\nyour class implements.  Then make the interface documented and <br/>\navailable.  Clients must write to the interface, implementation <br/>\ndetails are irrelavant to them, as they should be.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 2) Only test the public interface, perhaps giving up detailed<br/>\n&gt; testing of internal logic.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[...]<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Somehow to me (as an admitted TDD newbie), it just seemed better to <br/>\n&gt; be able to bang on these internal methods directly, rather than <br/>\n&gt;relying on the public methods to access them. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If you are practicing TDD, you should not be &quot;giving up detailed <br/>\ntesting of internal logic.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWith TDD you define what you need in terms of external behavior, <br/>\nwrite a test for it, them implement it.  Finally you clean up by <br/>\nrefactoring.  So as far as your tests are concerned everything that <br/>\nthe class has to do IS public.  When I add a new method in reponse to <br/>\na test, it&#39;s public.  When I refactor and extract methods, I make <br/>\nthem private.  That&#39;s the only way I make methods private.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 3) Make more classes... change the private methods into public<br/>\n&gt; methods of new simple classes. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s a another approach, but I would only do that of the <br/>\nfunctionallity was needed somewhere else.  And, I&#39;d most likely also <br/>\nextract an interface from the new class, and have clients work <br/>\nagainst the interface only.<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 4) Make the methods &#39;protected&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I only do this in response to the need of a subclass to have access <br/>\nto somethign that was originally private.. and I try to avoid it as <br/>\nmuch as possible.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; have your Test class inherit from your<br/>\n&gt; class under test.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Gawk!  Ack!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;d love to hear the group&#39;s thoughts...<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, I can&#39;t speak for the group.. but these are my thoughts.  (Made <br/>\nthem myself).<br/>\n<br/>\nDave</div>",
