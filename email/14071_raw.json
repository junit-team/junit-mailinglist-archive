Would you consider adding something like this in\nJUnit 4 so it is there if someone like me needs it someday? I&#39;d need to\nget this working now with 3.8.1 but would still be nice to have it in the\nfuture supported by the framework more directly.\n\n I thought about modifying the TestCase tearDown method to call my\n&quot;listener&quot; code but then I realized not all tests might do the\nsuper.tearDown call if they override the method. As I haven&#39;t written all\nthe tests I want to collect data for I can&#39;t control that. So I am\nthinking of just modifying the TestResult class that collects the results\nand adding my listener there as it supports TestListeners. Does anyone\nsee problems with that? This would mean I take the junit source, add my\ncode and build the jar to use with the projects I want to collect data\nfor.\n\nThanks,\n\n-Teemu\n\nOn Thu, 23 Jun 2005, Kent Beck wrote:\n\n&gt; Teemu,\n&gt;\n&gt; You are correct that there is no generic way to add TestListeners.

For this purpose I wish to add a piece of code to be\n&gt; &gt; called after\n&gt; &gt; each test has been run. I noticed that TestResult has a possibility to\n&gt; &gt; add such a piece of code through TestListener.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; However, adding the listener requires that I have access to the\n&gt; &gt; TestResult objects created. And these in turn are created in the\n&gt; &gt; TestRunner instances. And if I run my tests from an IDE or Ant, the\n&gt; &gt; runner used is out of my control.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I am thinking I could just modify the TestResult to always add my\n&gt; &gt; listener in its constructor or something similar (maybe a static\n&gt; &gt; listener..). But I am not sure if this is the best solution.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; So I guess my questions are:\n&gt; &gt;  -Did I understand the code correctly?\n&gt; &gt;  -Is there a way for me to easily add such a listener,\n&gt; &gt; hopefully without\n&gt; &gt;   messing too much with the JUnit sources?\n&gt; &gt;  -Can anyone think of reasons why modifying TestResult to contain my\n&gt; &gt; listener would not work? Are there some cases or environments\n&gt; &gt; that modify\n&gt; &gt; the execution so they dont use the standard TestResult? For\n&gt; &gt; example Ant,\n&gt; &gt; etc..\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks for your trouble,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; -Teemu\n\n",
