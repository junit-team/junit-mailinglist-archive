I&#39;m editing some fields to be sent later to a server and the connection\ngoes down. Ok the mediator can do the great part of the job but what if my\ncurrent form should let me save the data into a file in order to retrieve\nthem later? That kind of knowledge lies inside the form (it&#39;s its own\nresponsibility, above all!) while the constraints come from the outer world.\n\nHi,\nLuca Sfarzo\nTRSNeapolis\nTel:+390815272842\n\n\n\n\n-----Messaggio originale-----\nDa: Bob Koss [mailto:koss@...]\nInviato: martedi 11 giugno 2002 15.37\nA: junit@yahoogroups.com\nOggetto: Re: [junit] gui testing\n\n\nOn 6/11/02 7:28 AM, &quot;Michael Silverstein&quot; &lt;msilverstein@...&gt;\nwrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Bob Koss [mailto:koss@...] wrote:\n&gt;&gt; But if we use Mediator to decouple the gui controls, we may as\n&gt;&gt; well delegate\n&gt;&gt; everything to the Mediator and leave the gui stupid. The Mediator can be\n&gt;&gt; unit tested just like any other class, and doesn&#39;t need the gui since all\n&gt;&gt; communication is done through interfaces.\n&gt;\n&gt; That notwithstanding, you still need to test the connection between the\n&gt; mediator and your GUI. There&#39;s still plenty of room for error there.\n\n\nI&#39;m trying to understand your concern. I can test that the Mediator send the\nright message with the right parameters at the right time. The code in the\ngui (let&#39;s say a Dialog box just to be concrete) that responds to this\nmessage is one or two lines of code which IMO, can&#39;t break.\n\nCan you show me in a few lines of code where there is room for error between\nthe Mediator and the gui/dialog/whatever?\n\n\n--\nRobert Koss, Ph.D.     | Training, Mentoring, Contract Development\nSenior Consultant      | Object Oriented Design, C++, Java\nwww.objectmentor.com   | Extreme Programming\n\n\n\n\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\njunit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n\n\nYour use of Yahoo!
