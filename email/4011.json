You then <br/>\ninsert the data you will test.  Your data is not time dependant anymore. <br/>\nRemember that you are &quot;unit&quot; testing your application (i.e. testing that <br/>\nit does what it should do) and that your database can be in a <br/>\nnon-dynamic state.<br/>\n<br/>\nDatabase dependent: normally inserting data into a database if pretty <br/>\nsimple but it&#39;s true that if you plan to support Sybase, Oracle and <br/>\nmySQL, you may have to write 3 different scripts to populate your 3 <br/>\ndifferent databases.  But it must be done only once.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;     There is a line of thought that all you need to do is make sure your SQL<br/>\n&gt;     is valid. beyond that you&#39;re testing your database, not your method...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It also depends what you mean with a &quot;valid SQL statement&quot;.  Having a <br/>\nvalid SQL statement and having a SQL statement that does what it has to <br/>\ndo are two different things (or you never makes any mistake writing a <br/>\ncomplex SQL statement...).<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have an object that can be saved, updated and retrieved from a <br/>\ndatabase, a nice way to test your SQL statement and your database is to:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. create an object with valid data<br/>\n2. store the object into the database<br/>\n3. retrieve from the database into another object<br/>\n4. compare that these two objects are equal<br/>\n<br/>\nYou haven&#39;t directly test your database, but how your objects are <br/>\nsaved/modified/retrieved from the database.  It will be easier to find <br/>\nproblems when the database model changes.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Vladimir<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nVladimir Bossicard<br/>\nwww.bossicard.com</div>",
