I have a number of tests to run that certain conditions\n&gt; are met in the execution of a components. I don&#39;t want to write a test\n&gt; per test condition because I don&#39;t know how many will be needed and I\n&gt; don&#39;t want to rewrite the tests for each added (or removed condition). I\n&gt; guess this resembles most closely an array contents test however I don&#39;t\n&gt; know how many elements are present and the array equality argument\n&gt; doesn&#39;t apply:\n&gt;\n&gt; The problem ofcourse is that if I loop through n conditions in a test,\n&gt; the first one that fails will complete that test method but I want to\n&gt; report multiple failures. The overall failure of the collection of\n&gt; conditions is not a fine grained enough a report.\n&gt;\n&gt; Any ideas, pointers?\n&gt;\n&gt; thanks\n&gt;\n&gt; chanoch\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; -------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; The information transmitted is intended only for the person or entity to\n&gt; which it is addressed and may contain confidential and/or privileged\n&gt; material.

To write a test, you simply\n&gt; extend TestCase, add your &quot;public void testYYY()&quot; methods.  You can then\n&gt; run this test case with anyone of the several TestRunners.  You can also\n&gt; look at J.B.&#39;s excellent starter guide at\n&gt; www.diasparsoftware.com/articles/JUnit/jUnitStarterGuide.html.\n&gt;\n&gt; =jason\n&gt;\n&gt; On Tue, 2002-08-13 at 20:11, Mert Nuhoglu wrote: Hello,\n&gt;\n&gt; I am a beginner to the JUnit framework. I didn&#39;t understand an issue\n&gt; about the theory of JUnit.\n&gt;\n&gt; The test methods defined in a TestCase class are supposed to override\n&gt; the runTest method. How do they do that?\n&gt;\n&gt; Let me explain what I understood. There are two ways:\n&gt;\n&gt; 1. According to the Adapter pattern with anonymous inner classes, each\n&gt; test method is a subclass of the TestCase class.\n&gt;\n&gt; Quotation 1 (from A Cook&#39;s Tour):\n&gt; TestCase test= new MoneyTest(&quot;testMoneyEquals &quot;) {\n&gt;     protected void runTest() { testMoneyEquals(); }\n&gt; };\n&gt;\n&gt; Here runTest method is explicitly overridden. But where is this code\n&gt; segment written? Inside the static suite method?\n&gt;\n&gt; 2. According to the Pluggable Selector pattern, runTest method of\n&gt; TestCase class of the JUnit framework handles everything. Right?\n&gt;\n&gt; Quotation 2 (from A Cook&#39;s Tour):\n&gt; protected void runTest() throws Throwable {\n&gt;     Method runMethod= null;\n&gt;     try {\n&gt;         runMethod= getClass().getMethod(fName, new Class[0]);\n&gt;     } catch (NoSuchMethodException e) {\n&gt;         assert(&quot;Method &#92;&quot;&quot;+fName+&quot;&#92;&quot; not found&quot;, false);\n&gt;     }\n&gt;     try {\n&gt;         runMethod.invoke(this, new Class[0]);\n&gt;     }\n&gt;     // catch InvocationTargetException and IllegalAccessException\n&gt; }\n&gt;\n&gt; As far as I understood, runTest method reads somehow the name of the\n&gt; test methods and invokes them.\n&gt;\n&gt; I would appreciate for your explanations...\n&gt;\n&gt; Best Regards.\n&gt; Mert Nuhoglu\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
