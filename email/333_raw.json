That is to say there are combinations of\nkey-strokes/data/low-level hardware/OS states that will cause our software\nto do something it&#39;s not supposed to do.  That&#39;s why (as Alan said) we need\na proper error handling strategy: to handle the unanticipated.  \n\nIf you&#39;re writing a piece of code to read a file that&#39;s supposed to be there\nand it&#39;s not there, then throwing an exception is appropriate and that\nexception needs to be dealt with by your error handler.\n\nWhereas if you can make an assertion about something e.g. \n\tassertNotNull(someArgument);\nthen you have anticipated it and therefore can handle it within your code\ne.g.\n\tif (someArgument == null) {\n\t\tdisplayMessage(&quot;You must enter a value&quot;); // or whatever\n\t}\nSo you don&#39;t need the assertion in your live code AND there&#39;s no bug if the\nuser doesn&#39;t enter a value.   \n\nregards, APC\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Ilja Preu?

Wow!\n\nWell, I don&#39;t have as much confidence in my code, so I would want to handle\npossible assertion-exceptions.\n\nciao, Ilja\n\n-----Ursprungliche Nachricht-----\nVon: Alan Francis [mailto:alan@...]\nGesendet: Donnerstag, 25.

They&#39;ll\nhave failed during testing and you&#39;ll have fixed it.  What you want\nin production code is a decent error-handling strategy (which IMO PbC\nis not).\n\nAsserts for preconditions (and junit UTs for postconditions) are\na &quot;testing strategy&quot;, not an &quot;error-handiling strategy&quot;.\n\n\nAlan\n\n\n\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\njunit-unsubscribe@egroups.com\n\n\n\n\n\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\njunit-unsubscribe@egroups.com\n\n\n\n",
