Without the possibility =\r\nof learning new\nthings from the execution of the tests, I can imagine chang=\r\ning the way\nI&#39;d apply a test-driven mindset.   (I&#39;ve yet to give or receive=\r\n an\ninterview that actually used a computer.)\n\n2) For a while, I would give=\r\n interviews where I&#39;d describe a set of\nrequirements for a system design, a=\r\nnd then ask the candidate to write\na test for a core component in the syste=\r\nm, without implementing it\nfirst.  I found that only a few absolute superst=\r\nars could make\nheadway--interestingly, these were split about 50/50 between=\r\n those who\nhad at least tried TDD, and just incredibly intelligent  people =\r\nable\nto get their heads around a problem no matter how it was presented.\n\n3=\r\n) On the other hand, I&#39;ve noticed that applicants who end up writing\nbuggy =\r\nimplementations in interviews often do so because they stop with\na solution=\r\n that works on a single example, and have a hard time\nthinking of ways it c=\r\nould break on other types of input.  I&#39;d like to\nthink that every professio=\r\nnal developer finds ways to get continuously\nbetter at figuring out what&#39;s =\r\nwrong with with the code she just wrote:\nTDD does that for me.\n\n   David Sa=\r\nff\n\nOn Sat, May 1, 2010 at 8:17 AM, Mike Forsberg &lt;bigmike.f@...&gt; wro=\r\nte:\n&gt; This may be better in a blog post, which I will hopefully get to...\n&gt;=\r\n but I&#39;d like to pose two questions to the group first. =A0Let&#39;s call it\n&gt; =\r\nresearch.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ve just completed a set of interviews and looking back on t=\r\nhe coding\n&gt; questions. =A0I realized that I never followed my test first ma=\r\nntra that\n&gt; I perform at home.\n&gt;\n&gt; First question, to those giving the inte=\r\nrview... Would you ever\n&gt; suggest/remind a candidate of TDD style in his/he=\r\nr code?\n&gt;\n&gt; Second question, why on earth does a candidate, like myself, fo=\r\nrget to\n&gt; write tests and incrementally improve their code? =A0Do this show=\r\n a lack\n&gt; of software development maturity?\n&gt;\n&gt; As a community reminder, an=\r\nd to myself.... don&#39;t forget TDD style on interviews.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ---------------=\r\n---------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
