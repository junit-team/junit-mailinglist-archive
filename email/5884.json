After <br/>\n  searching thru documentation, this news group and other sources, some <br/>\n  issues still remain that I hope some of you can help answer.<br/>\n<br/>\n      1. We have a need to put some trace messages in the tests so as <br/>\n  to know the progress of the test itself because each test can be <br/>\n  fairly timeconsuming. Is there a way to have these capture this <br/>\n  output for an individual test in the GUI-based TestRunner? I see only <br/>\n  thing that is captured for each test on the UI are the assertion <br/>\n  failures. <br/>\n<br/>\n      2. I see that JUnitReport is used quite extensively with Ant. <br/>\n  From what I learnt reading, it helps output TestResult in XML format <br/>\n  and then one can translate it using XSLT. Know how one can use that <br/>\n  without having to use Ant? Any resources on Net would be helpful.<br/>\n<br/>\n     3. I see JUnit is great for nesting sub-suites within a suite and <br/>\n  thereby creating a tree of suites. But when it comes to test results, <br/>\n  is there a way to get a breakup of which sub-suite had how many <br/>\n  failures from TestResult?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Thanks in advance,<br/>\n  Vern<br/>\n<br/>\n     <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Your use of Yahoo!
