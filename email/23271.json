This is clearly nothing compared to the JUnit user community what <br/>\nclearly demonstrate for me that it is not the appropriate way to <br/>\nevaluate an improvement (I&#39;m quite sure that I could quickly motivate <br/>\nfar more than 17 users to vote for one issue but it would be biased).<br/>\n<br/>\nCurrently you &quot;are&quot; JUnit therefore I&#39;d like to know from *you* what <br/>\n*you* think of these suggestions.

That<br/>\n&gt; way, we could start with the most popular ideas, and iterate on clean<br/>\n&gt; patches for those, once you could be sure that the effort wouldn&#39;t be<br/>\n&gt; wasted.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I hope that addresses your concerns.
