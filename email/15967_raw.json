For\n&gt; example, if I have a junit test like junit&#39;s one that actually\n&gt; executes junit inside the test, it will screw up. Also, because of the\n&gt; timeout behavior, we&#39;ll introduce stuff from java.util.concurrent\n&gt; into the trace, which means we have to figure out *exactly* which\n&gt; methods there need excluding. In general, this is fragile. JUnit can\n&gt; easily get a stack trace from the method that calls user-code. This\n&gt; would at least allow a tool to find out exactly what frames needed to\n&gt; be killed.\n\nI&#39;ll look at it a bit more.  The concern is that the same issues that \nmake this difficult and fragile for runner clients would make it \ndifficult for us to get right in JUnit.\n\n    David Saff\n\n",
