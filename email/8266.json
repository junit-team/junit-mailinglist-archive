Separates Exceptional behaviour test code. Throwing exception <br/>\n </span></blockquote>can <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;be slower compared to normal workflow. Failure on exception class <br/>\n </span></blockquote>can <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;be classified as exceptable for code shipment, while normal test <br/>\n&gt; &gt;failure has to be a showstoper.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; we cannot solve in time to ship the product, but failure to handle <br/>\n&gt; an exception must not automatically be considered less important<br/>\n&gt; than correctly handling the &quot;happy paths&quot;.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Of course, it is better to consider them equaly important.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;2. Fails if wrong exception class thrown or nothing was thrown.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; That&#39;s not always enough: does the exception object thrown contain <br/>\n&gt; adequate information to describe the exception?<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If it is not enough, then it is normal path and should be tested as <br/>\npart of normal TestCase. If you have one line code within each test <br/>\nmethod you would worry less from where exception was thrown.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Exception tests in particular are more of a design tool than a<br/>\n&gt; testing tool: writing good exception tests leads to better<br/>\n&gt; exception classes, which leads to higher serviceability and<br/>\n&gt; maintainability, <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Still test cases code should be written, until design tools can <br/>\nautogenerate them. Most code for exceptional test cases is in setUp() <br/>\nmethod to prepare objects in state, which can lead to an exception. <br/>\nThen single method call on an object we test should throw expected <br/>\nexception. Test methods can be organized to call exception causing <br/>\nmethods.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; People who do not practise TDD probably think exception tests are a<br/>\n&gt; waste of time and they wouldn&#39;t be far off. Exception tests show <br/>\n&gt; their value most in the context of TDD.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I have not practised complete TDD project, and I think exception <br/>\ntests are very important. Even I prefer to have them organized in a <br/>\nseparate test case classes.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;3. Typical exception cause is wrong method parameters or <br/>\n&gt; &gt;preconditions. So it takes a lot of tests to be written to create <br/>\n&gt; &gt;different exceptional conditions.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Wrong method parameters or failed preconditions indicate a bug<br/>\n&gt; elsewhere, and not a bug in the method trying to receive those<br/>\n&gt; parameters. It usually indicates that the caller is not adequately<br/>\n&gt; tested. &quot;Defensive programming&quot; is truly paranoid programming and<br/>\n&gt; should be avoided.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Defensive programming is an extreme. But often it worth to reject <br/>\ninvalid paraters immediately, rather than let them slip futher in <br/>\nstack. I am using same approach as java.util.Vector class from Sun&#39;s <br/>\nJDK 1.4 source. It has very good examples of parameter checks and <br/>\ndocumentation.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf parameter is not an ANY value for it&#39;s type, then there is an <br/>\nexceptional path and it should be tested. For example if an object of <br/>\nsome class is used as a parameter we need to consider a case of null <br/>\nreference. Some method can take null as a normal value, others will <br/>\nhave NullPointerException, which should be included in javadoc. Third <br/>\ntype of methods may throw another type of exception including <br/>\njava.lang.IllegalArgumentException</div>",
