As such, I&#39;m presented with a fairly unique opportunity to\n&gt;establish some standard practices for unit testing.\n&gt;\n&gt;A few things are obvious. Yes, writing unit tests for all new code\n&gt;should be STRONGLY ENCOURAGED. Yes, the JUnit framework is what we\n&gt;will use for launching our tests. \n&gt;\n&gt;Some are less obvious, but I&#39;m still clear on what to do. For instance,\n&gt;writing tests that include the database are often QUITE difficult. Not\n&gt;everyone has a copy of Oracle; we can&#39;t just erase tables willy-nilly\n&gt;to set up for each test; etc. So I will use mock objects (hopefully\n&gt;starting from those at www.mockobjects.com) to simulate the connection,\n&gt;and other &quot;external&quot; data sources/sinks.\n&gt;\n&gt;And there are a few questions on which I&#39;d like to hear input from\n&gt;some with more experience so I can start out using &quot;Best Practices&quot;\n&gt;instead of having to learn from my OWN experience.\n&gt;\n&gt;QUESTION 1:\n&gt;   Where do my JUnit unit tests go?\n&gt;   \n&gt;   I see 3 likely answers... (a) make each an inner class of the\n&gt;   class being tested, (b) for every class &quot;Foo&quot; have a class called \n&gt;   &quot;TestFoo&quot; in the same package, or (c) have a separate (but parallel\n&gt;   hierarchy of classes... SOURCE/com/pkg/Foo.java is tested by \n&gt;   TEST/com/pkg/TestFoo.java.\n&gt;\n&gt;   I lean towards (c) because it makes it easy to build the &quot;real&quot; code\n&gt;   and the &quot;test&quot; code separately, and omit the &quot;test&quot; code from\n&gt;   production deployment. Are there other significant issues here?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;QUESTION 2:\n&gt;   How do I automatically build the suite of all tests?\n&gt;\n&gt;   For each class, I can have several methods called &quot;testXxx()&quot; and\n&gt;   can collect them into a suite to run at once. I can collect the\n&gt;   suites together into larger suites, eventually coalescing into a\n&gt;   suite called &quot;RunAllTests&quot; which does just that. But this requires\n&gt;   me to write each of these suites, and to remember to include each\n&gt;   and every test class. I&#39;d rather if &quot;RunAllTests&quot; just magically\n&gt;   found all of the tests... that way I couldn&#39;t forget to include\n&gt;   one and wind up with some tests that never get run just because I\n&gt;   forgot a line in a suite. How do I create this &quot;magical&quot; \n&gt;   RunAllTests?\n&gt;\n&gt;   Stray thought... if there&#39;s no simple solution in straight java,\n&gt;   I wonder if ant can help me to achieve RunAllTests as an ant\n&gt;   target?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;QUESTION 3:\n&gt;   How do I &quot;turn on&quot; my mock objects when tests are running?\n&gt;\n&gt;   The most straightforward use of mock objects is to pass them\n&gt;   directly to the code being tested. However, (despite the fact that\n&gt;   this is a bit broader than simply &quot;unit&quot; testing), I plan to have\n&gt;   a lot of tests that exercise an entire sub-system at once. For\n&gt;   example, I might create the input file, run the command, and then\n&gt;   test the output file. But if this &quot;command&quot; opens a connection to\n&gt;   a database (or other system), then I&#39;d like to return a mock\n&gt;   ResultSet instead of a real one. So the code that obtains a DB\n&gt;   connection has to look at some global setting to see if we&#39;re in\n&gt;   &quot;test mode&quot; or &quot;real life&quot;. What is a good way to achieve this --\n&gt;   is it something I&#39;ll have to write for myself?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll have more questions also, but this email is QUITE long\n&gt;enough as is. Thanks in advance for any feedback, suggestions, or\n&gt;pointers to other forums/FAQs for this kind of stuff.\n&gt;\n&gt;-- Michael Chermside\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt;junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;Your use of Yahoo!
