To me, there&#39;s no such thing as &quot;only for testing.&quot;\n&gt; This implies that testing is not important, when actually it is\n&gt; all-important.\n\n  I don&#39;t agree about matter of taste. I&#39;m convinced that one should not\n  try to increase visibility or add helper methods to ease testing. \n  And we should try as we might to avoid such tricks.\n\n  Recently I had to rework a bunch of my tests when some previously tested\n  methods become private. And after such refactoring I revealed that\n  my tests become more clean and understandable. \n\n&gt; \n&gt; If you read between the lines of my original reply, though, the deeper\n&gt; question is, &quot;Why a singleton?&quot; :)\n\n  Sorry, I wasn&#39;t clever enough to read between lines :). But\n  this is quite another thing - we should keep design testable\n  and here I completely agree with you. Singletons are not very\n  suitable for testing.\n\n  With kind regards,\n  KIR\n\n-- \nKirill Maximov aka KIR\nkir@... | http://www.maxkir.com/\nSt.Petersburg, Russia\n\n",
