You get more bang for your buck testing closer to code\n2. regression !!!! try doing all these tests manually , exactly like you did them before\n3. Extensibility, JUnit has been adopted by mostly all open source tools\n4. maybe use DBUnit, (like Kamlesh suggested)\n\nI totally agree with Joel Neely, since he already said all the above, already. but since you asked my personal opinion....\n\nHope this helps.\n\nBut, since your application is database bound, HOW are you going to use JUnit to verify what is in the database? unless you use dbunit, or API&#39;s like XQuery and XPath\n\nI recomended Xpath and Xquery, since this will give your testers a huge leap in tecnology, which they can use in the future. but it is your decision.\n\nThanks,\n-Kamal.\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: sateeshkumar.soundarapandian@... \n  To: junit@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Wednesday, March 26, 2008 9:01 AM\n  Subject: RE: [junit] Applicability - Where not to Use JUnit\n\n\n  Hi Kamal,\n\n  We are now not in the timeline of using other tools like\n  XPath, XQuery.

Even if we try with JUnit, the time taken for test case \n  preparation is almost equal to the time taken to implement the \n  functionality. Pls instruct me.\n\n  with regards,\n  Sateesh \n\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n   \n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
