I think my process is good because I\n&gt; don&#39;t need to consider whether an interface I&#39;m developing now will\nbe\n&gt; workable in the future; I just need to get it to work with what I\n&gt; need now--a much simpler and faster job--and leave it at that. \n\nI think we need to define terms a little.  Interface in this context is\na little overloaded.  I took it to mean the conceptual boundary between\nany part of my system that talks to any other part.  And with that\ndefinition, I&#39;d agree with your statements (I do the same).\n\nHmm.  Now I was prepared to say that if you&#39;re talking about an\nInterface as an API to a set of developers that are outside your group,\nthen frequent change may be a bad thing.  However, that situation just\nmakes those one of your customers, I&#39;d say.\n\nWhich means that the *real* question would be:  How do you prioritize\nrequests from several different customers.  That&#39;s a more\nstraightforward question, I think.  Or at least it sounds a lot like\nsomeone else&#39;s problem.  :P\n\n(sorry for all the handwaving there...)\n\nKevin\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
