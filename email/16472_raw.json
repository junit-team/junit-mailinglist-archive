With JMock, it does not work, you\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; have to rely on text completion features.\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; With EasyMock, it works like a charm.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; I do admit that this is a shortcoming, but I don&#39;t find that annoying\n&gt;  &gt; when I use jMock. In fact, in an odd way, if I find I really\n&gt;  &gt; want code completion when defining fakes or expectations, then perhaps\n&gt; my\n&gt;  &gt; interface is too complex. :)\n&gt; \n&gt; This raises an issue which I don&#39;t *think* I&#39;ve seen mentioned here.\n&gt; \n&gt; I find that there&#39;s a bit of a benefit when writing test code with\n&gt; EasyMock (either version) in that after typing in what I want to be\n&gt; called before it exists, I can then ask Eclipse to generate all the\n&gt; methods for me, in both the interface and the class. The tests really do\n&gt; drive the code - it&#39;s only when a test requires a method to be present\n&gt; that it gets put in the interface, because I don&#39;t end up writing the\n&gt; interface declarations by hand in the first place. (Of course, I add\n&gt; documentation and might change the parameter names later, but that&#39;s a\n&gt; different matter.)\n&gt; \n&gt; Just a small benefit, but I thought I&#39;d mention it...\n&gt; \n&gt; Jon (a very happy EasyMock user)\n\nIt&#39;s the other side of the coin: either you prefer generating the \nmethod, but have to pay for /having/ to generate it, or you prefer not \nto have to generate it, but have to pay for having to type it by hand. I \nthink it&#39;s strictly a personal taste thing: the price is the same.\n-- \nJ. B.
