The \nnotion seems to be that each method in a class, or perhaps each public method, \nshould have a unit test.</font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">I think this is wrong. I think, as J.B. said, that \nin such a case you should concentrate on testing features, not simply \nmethods.</font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">I would say that for new code, where you&#39;re writing \ntests along with your production code, it might make sense to try for a test per \n(public) method. But that&#39;s because in this case you have the benefit of \nthinking about the testing at the time you&#39;re writing the code. I think you&#39;re \nmore likely to design your code in such a way as to have this make more sense. \n(The &quot;testing influences design&quot; notion.)</font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">The problem I see with mindlessly (or even \nmindfully) writing a test for each method, just to satisfy someone&#39;s idea that \ncode coverage is good, is that you&#39;re likely to (1) invest a lot of (or even a \nlittle) time; and (2) generate a lot of test code (which will have to be \nmaintained, don&#39;t forget), for what will turn out to be little or no benefit. I \nwould bet that the marginal number of bugs found by &quot;complete&quot; per-method tests \nover a more sensible per-feature approach, both now and forever in the future, \nis very close to zero. At least that&#39;s my impression based on my own \nexperiences.</font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">More is not always better.</font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">I would be very curious to know if anyone can \nreport on actual (measured, quantitative) experiences that either support or \nrefute this.</font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">&nbsp;- Alan Bram</font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">&nbsp;&nbsp; \nalan@...</font></div></html></div>",
