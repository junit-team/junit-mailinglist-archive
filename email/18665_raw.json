HooohHahhh!\n\nTrue doesn&#39;t generate tests, actually has nothing to do with tests,\njust statically analyzes the code.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;  Jimm in order for this to work the way it says it\n&gt;  works it has to parse source and store it in some\n&gt;  model.  Then analyze it...looks like using rule sets.\n&gt;\nYes it does, it creates an AST and the rules can be written in java,\nor xpath if the rules are simple enough. I actually learned xpath with\nPMD and it works great :) Used it to find errorprone\nexception-handling for CMP:s in our codebase and guess what... I did\nfind some bugs.\n\n&gt;  I&#39;m sure you could use the same model and rule sets\n&gt;  to generate tests (Just shooting from the hip.  I&#39;d have to look at it a\n&gt;  little more\n&gt;  to see whether I could come up with a concrete example. )\n&gt;\n\nPossibly, the parser is already in place so why not start in that end.\nYou may also want to check out javaCC and jjTreeif you want to parse\nJava.. it comes with a java 1.5 grammar in the examples. But maybe\nwhat Jimm wants to do can be expressed even with annotations?\n(I&#39;ve opened the parser can of worms enough times to have some respect\nfor that topic)\n\n&gt;  http://pmd.sourceforge.net/\n&gt;\n&gt;  Thanks for letting me us Joakim.  Can&#39;t wait to\n&gt;  to hook it up to my maven projects.\n&gt;\n\nAnd don&#39;t forget to try the eclipse plugin aswell :)\nI hope that PMD will be as helpful to you as you seem to think it will\nbe. Good luck!\n\n",
