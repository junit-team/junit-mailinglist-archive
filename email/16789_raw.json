But we never used that=\r\n term.\n\nThe most effective and common form of automation is one in which th=\r\ne\nmachine (or computer) and the human each perform the tasks that they\ndo b=\r\nest or more effectively.\n\nUnless it&#39;s misused, automation is a good thing -=\r\n a VERY good thing.\n\nThe first benefit of automation is that it frees human=\r\n beings from\nperforming aspects of a given task that don&#39;t require their\nin=\r\ntelligence, creativity, and insight and allows them to focus on the\naspects=\r\n that do.\n\nA second benefit of automation is that it allows you to do thing=\r\ns that\n would be impossible or impractical to do manually and allows human\n=\r\nbeings to reach well beyond what they could do on their own.  Some\npeople c=\r\nall this IA (Intelligence Amplification).\n\nWe designed Agitator to automate=\r\n the aspects of testing that would\nbenefit from automation and, VERY intent=\r\nionally, did NOT automate the\nparts that REQUIRE human intelligence, creati=\r\nvity, and understanding\nto have any meaning (e.g. the creation of test asse=\r\nrtions).\n\nDifferent people prefer different levels of automation for differ=\r\nent\ntasks (e.g. my mother still likes to make home-made fettuccine without\n=\r\na pasta maker - mixing them and cutting them by hand.  Enjoying the\nprocess=\r\n and liking the fact that each strand is a little different.\nTakes ~2hrs th=\r\nough. Other use a Cuisinart and a pasta machine.  Others\nbuy them at Safewa=\r\ny :-)).\n\nWhen it comes to testing, including test creation, my belief and\ne=\r\nxperience is that the *right* *level* of automation is not only\nacceptable =\r\nand desirable, but necessary.\n\nAlberto\n\n\n\n\n",
