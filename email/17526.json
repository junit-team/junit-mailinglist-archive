According to M. Feathers&#39; &quot;Working effectively<br/>\n&gt; &gt; with legacy code&quot; unit tests don&#39;t access databases or communicate via<br/>\n&gt; &gt; a nreal network connection. I do know that his book&#39;s focus is not on<br/>\n&gt; &gt; JUnit, but I do think that he has a point there. So: without a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; database and a network connection, when it is really necessary to free<br/>\n&gt; &gt; up resources with tearDown()? Isn&#39;t garbage collecting enough?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Here&#39;s an example for you.<br/>\n<br/>\nI run unit tests on custom UI components, some of which require a visible<br/>\nwindow.  The OS has a limited number of these, so my tests running successfully<br/>\ndepends on timely disposal of these windows.  Some tests, in fact, depend on a<br/>\ncertain window configuration, so if a previous test leaves stuff behind, it can<br/>\ninterfere with subsequent tests.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s another example:<br/>\nThe JUnit 3 test runners create all test cases before running, and keep<br/>\nreferences to them in memory after running.  Anything kept as field references<br/>\nin a test class will not be GC&#39;d until the test runner releases the test class<br/>\nreference (which is never).</div>",
