What if a entity name or a attribute name changes? Then the<br/>\n&gt; XML dataset file would not work anymore for DbUnit unless it is<br/>\n&gt; updated. Much maintainance work and prone to errors.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Besides this, if we create data with our ORM, it can be assured, that<br/>\n&gt; the created data is valid because we have validation rules for each<br/>\n&gt; entity. If someone writes test data for DbUnit in that XML file, then<br/>\n&gt; no validation is done when the data is created.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; For cleaning up the database we use a so called<br/>\n&gt; &quot;EntityGarbageCollector&quot; (EGC). As soon as we create an entity, we put<br/>\n&gt; it in the EGC. In the tearDown method the garbage is diposed, e.g. the<br/>\n&gt; entities are deleted in a generic way by the EGC.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am not defending our solution at all cost. Here are many JUnit<br/>\n&gt; experts and I would be happy to read your opinion on this topic. So<br/>\n&gt; does DbUnit make sense when using an Object/Relational Mapper?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What are you trying to test?<br/>\n<br/>\n1. The client code that invokes your ORM layer.<br/>\n2. The mappings between your entities and the database.<br/>\n3. Your implementation of the ORM layer. (Did you build it?)<br/>\n4. Something else entirely?<br/>\n<br/>\nI am also a fan of putting test data directly in the test, so I&#39;d be <br/>\ninclined to use the ORM to set up test data on a test-by-test basis for <br/>\ncase #1 and #2, but not case #3. For case #3, my answer is long and <br/>\ncomplex and I prefer not to type it unless that&#39;s what you mean. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf it&#39;s case #4, then tell us more.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
