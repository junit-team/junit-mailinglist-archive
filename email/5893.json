We have a need to put some trace messages in the tests so <br/>\nas <br/>\n&gt;   to know the progress of the test itself because each test can be <br/>\n&gt;   fairly timeconsuming. Is there a way to have these capture this <br/>\n&gt;   output for an individual test in the GUI-based TestRunner? I see <br/>\nonly <br/>\n&gt;   thing that is captured for each test on the UI are the assertion <br/>\n&gt;   failures. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;       2. I see that JUnitReport is used quite extensively with Ant. <br/>\n&gt;   From what I learnt reading, it helps output TestResult in XML <br/>\nformat <br/>\n&gt;   and then one can translate it using XSLT. Know how one can use <br/>\nthat <br/>\n&gt;   without having to use Ant? Any resources on Net would be helpful.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;      3. I see JUnit is great for nesting sub-suites within a suite <br/>\nand <br/>\n&gt;   thereby creating a tree of suites. But when it comes to test <br/>\nresults, <br/>\n&gt;   is there a way to get a breakup of which sub-suite had how many <br/>\n&gt;   failures from TestResult?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Thanks in advance,<br/>\n&gt;   Vern<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;      <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n&gt;   junit-unsubscribe@y...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Your use of Yahoo!
