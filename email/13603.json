Getters and setters are easy to test. Test them! You&#39;ll be <br/>\nsurprised how many bugs you&#39;ll find in methods that are supposedly too <br/>\nsimple to fail.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are a few cases where you really can&#39;t test stuff. In particular <br/>\nSometimes you just have to have unreachable code. For instance, I <br/>\nsometimes find myself implementing an interface such as <br/>\njava.util.Iterator in a private inner class. My private implementation <br/>\nmay never call remove() but I still need to implement that method anyway <br/>\nto fulfill the contract of Iterator. Normally I just make the method <br/>\nthrow an exception, in case I&#39;m wrong and something does call it. <br/>\nHowever, there&#39;s just no way to reach it to test it (nor is there any <br/>\nneed to do so since this code will never run.) But aside from a few <br/>\nweird cases like that, all code should be tested or deleted.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nElliotte Rusty Harold  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:elharo@...\">elharo@...</a><br/>\nXML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/\">http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim\">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim</a></div>",
