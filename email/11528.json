Folks have been using this approach for quite some <br/>\ntime.  I have used it for years, and still do in the cases where a mock <br/>\nlibrary is too heavy-weight.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  I find, though, that when I try to run the sample code in listings 5<br/>\n&gt;  and 6 through JUnit, I get a null pointer exception.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Where?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  So now I&#39;m wondering two things:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  1- Does anyone see why this code wouldn&#39;t work?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Not at first glance.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  2- Does this approach to Mock classes add unnecessary complexity?<br/>\n&gt;  Perhaps I&#39;d just be better off using a regular ol&#39; derived class<br/>\n&gt;  instead of an anonymous inner class.  The catch is that the regular<br/>\n&gt;  ol&#39; derived class would need to be passed into the class being tested<br/>\n&gt;  as a constructor parameter instead of being contained completely by<br/>\n&gt;  the class being tested.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>As I implied before, this doesn&#39;t neccessarily add complexity.  In fact, I <br/>\noften use it to avoid the complexity of a mock framework.  YMMV.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing to watch out for is duplication.  If you find yourself creating the <br/>\nsame types of support classes as nested classes over and over again it&#39;s a <br/>\nsign that you need to pull that support class out into a top-level (as the <br/>\narticle suggests with MockTransaction).<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJason Rogers<br/>\n117 N.
