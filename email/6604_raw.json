I realize that \n  &gt;  there may be \n  &gt;  &gt; times when you absolutely need the visual inspection \n  &gt;  (though I can&#39;t \n  &gt;  &gt; think of one off the bat), nevertheless, this seems like \n  &gt;  a subtle form \n  &gt;  &gt; of test dependencies or spaghetti code, or some other \n  &gt;  code-smell.  \n  &gt;  &gt; Sorry if that sounds harsh -- I am certainly not trying to be \n  &gt;  &gt; judgemental, just reflective.\n  &gt;  &gt;\n  &gt;  &gt; =jason\n  &gt;  &gt; [:question | ^One]\n  &gt;  &gt;\n  &gt;  &gt; -----Original Message-----\n  &gt;  &gt; From: Kendall Collett [mailto:przkiie02@...]\n  &gt;  &gt; Sent: Friday, January 03, 2003 12:41 PM\n  &gt;  &gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n  &gt;  &gt; Subject: Re: [junit] Re: Conditional tearDown()\n  &gt;  &gt;\n  &gt;  &gt; I could use a conditional clean-up in tearDown, for \n  &gt;  exactly the same \n  &gt;  &gt; reason as Brian.\n  &gt;  &gt;\n  &gt;  &gt; When I first ran into this issue; I didn&#39;t think of \n  &gt;  trying to make the\n  &gt;  &gt; tearDown() clean-up conditional.  Instead, I adopted a \n  &gt;  convention of \n  &gt;  &gt; having my setUp()s perform the clean-up for the next \n  &gt;  test.  In other \n  &gt;  &gt; words, for a given test I do a pre-clean instead of a \n  &gt;  post-clean.
