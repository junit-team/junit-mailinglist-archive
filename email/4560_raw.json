I&#39;m sure that, if well presented, the JUnit team would\n&gt; be willing to evaluate your solution and add it to a future release (is\n&gt; this true guys?).\n&gt; \n&gt; I believe that, if people want to test private methods (and this is an\n&gt; issue that crops up frequently), they should be allowed to do so (if\n&gt; such functionality is readilly available).\n\nBut as i pointed out way back when this began, JUnit can *already* test \nprivate methods using existing features of Java access control. Just \ncode your JUnit test class as an inner class of the class being tested. \nBut some programmers object to this method, because it embeds the unit \ntests in the code when they want the unit tests in a separate package \naltogether. That&#39;s not a JUnit problem, that&#39;s a configuration \nmanagement problem, imho. The smell is in the tension between the \ndesired source code layout and the access rules of the language. I don&#39;t \nsee how JUnit is responsible for this smell, or a JUnit-based solution \n(like, say, hacking it to use reflection in order to break access \ncontrol) that doesn&#39;t bring along serious code smells of its own.\n\nI think we all agree that there&#39;s a smell here. We&#39;re just disagreeing \nabout how to handle the smell.  I&#39;ll admit, using inner classes for unit \ntesting smells, too. I don&#39;t think it smells nearly as bad as breaking \naccess control, but that&#39;s just my opinion.\n\nI rather liked JB Rainsberger&#39;s idea that the need to test a private \nmethod directly suggests refactoring it into a collaborating class. I&#39;m \nnot sure it&#39;s universally applicable, but i do prefer looking for smells \nin my code rather than my tools.\n-- \n\nDavid Stagner\n\nNational Marrow Donor Program\n3001 Broadway Street NE\nBroadway Ridge Suite 500\nMinneapolis, MN  55413\n\nEmail: dstagner@...\n\n\n\n",
