Our requirement is to run unit tests from within<br/>\n&gt; Eclipse and using Maven.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The experience was rather disappointing.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The support for categories in Eclipse is completely missing. Maven plugin<br/>\n&gt; did not work out of the box as the wrong test executor was instantiated.<br/>\n&gt; Once this was fixed, we found that the category class must be available in<br/>\n&gt; the class path of all projects, else the plugin fails with a<br/>\n&gt; ClassNotFoundException.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Why are categories not plain strings as in TestNG? This would prevent<br/>\n&gt; class not found exceptions and in addition removes the requirement to have<br/>\n&gt; a dependency on the single module containing the categories. If you like<br/>\n&gt; you can still use String constants to be &quot;name safe&quot;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Evaluating TestNG as an alternative lead to the following results:<br/>\n&gt; - Good support in the Eclipse Plugin and Maven<br/>\n&gt; -- Groups (= categories) are found by the Eclipse plugin<br/>\n&gt; - TestNG does not create a new instance per test. As a consequence all<br/>\n&gt; fields must be set in @BeforeMethod. Using a normal constructor causes<br/>\n&gt; unexpected results.<br/>\n&gt; - @BeforeMethod is not executed, if a group is specified. There is a<br/>\n&gt; @BeforeGroup annotation which makes the whole thing much more complex.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Best Regards<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sebastian<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>",
