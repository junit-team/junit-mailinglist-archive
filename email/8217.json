The solution was to have a<br/>\nclasspath that looked like:<br/>\n$JUNIT_HOME:$JUNIT_HOME/junit.jar<br/>\nwhich was embarrassingly obvious once I stopped to think about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, the problem in Redhat 8 existed for an apparently different<br/>\nreason.  The local Linux expert believes that there is an error in<br/>\nthe C library called.  This error showed up in jdb, so it may be<br/>\na problem for the developer list.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  I too have a<br/>\n&gt; classpath problem that I cannot figure out.  I am running builds<br/>\n </span></blockquote>with ant<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; and have a junit target.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[snip]<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Does the line &quot;[junit] Running test.myco.tsr.AllTests&quot; mean that it<br/>\n </span></blockquote>found<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; my test cases?  The error indicates the opposite.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know, but I will try setting up a similar ant project and<br/>\nI will try to reproduce the behavior.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs it possible that it found one of the classes needed for AllTests<br/>\nbut could not find the others?  I suspect that&#39;s what&#39;s happening.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is interesting to note that even with the wrong path, in <br/>\nRedhat 9, I got something similar to your case -- I could get the<br/>\nswingui to run, but it could not find some or all of the test<br/>\nclasses needed.<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe your problem is similar to that Redhat problem.  I will<br/>\ntry to use ant to produce more definite data.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Is your setup bombing because it can&#39;t find junit.jar or your test<br/>\n&gt; class(es)?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I believe the first bomb was because it didn&#39;t have both of the<br/>\nelements it needed.  In Redhat 9 it works if given<br/>\n$JUNIT_HOME:$JUNIT_HOME/junit.jar<br/>\n<br/>\nwhereas if memory serves, in Redhat 8 it didn&#39;t even work with<br/>\nthat classpath -- it bombed on a line of code where Java tried to<br/>\ncall a system-level command and failed.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first element $JUNIT_HOME is what allows it to find the test<br/>\nclasses.  I suspect that might be what is missing in your case.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt first glance, this kind of classpath seems inefficient to me.<br/>\nHowever, it may be that the designers liked it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI will keep you posted as I learn more.</div>",
