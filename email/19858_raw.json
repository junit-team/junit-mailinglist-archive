In doubt, just ask, and the\n&gt; original poster did just that.\n\nIf you want to learn TDD, it actually is quite sound advice to always do \nTDD. And TDD, after all, *is* about mini steps. In fact I would argue \nthat when learning TDD, you should take smaller steps than an \nexperienced developer would take, just to get a feeling for how small \nthey *can* be, and what it really feels like.\n\nWhen you&#39;ve experienced that for a while, you are in a quite good \nposition to decide for yourself.\n\n&gt; Not having a lot of experience in an area also means you&#39;re not quite\n&gt; sure who to listen to, so at the end of the day, you sometimes do have\n&gt; to listen to your instinct...\n\nWhen I&#39;m new to something, I typically *don&#39;t* give a lot of attention \nto my instincts - because I know that they might very well be dead \nwrong. What I give attention to is to what people say that are good at \nwhat I&#39;m trying to learn.\n\nCheers, Ilja\n\n",
