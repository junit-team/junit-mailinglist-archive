In my <br/>\n    &gt; opinion, this has a bad<br/>\n    &gt; smell, but ... well, I am interested of your opinion as I <br/>\n    &gt; am not to sure if<br/>\n    &gt; I am right.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Actually, I thought it was a *neat* idea, if needed.  He points out to<br/>\nplaces where the need for this might be apparent, you decide on the need.<br/>\nRecorder is just a special case of a listener.  You don&#39;t have to implement<br/>\nit the way Eric did, I think his implementation is a case of DTSTTCPW for<br/>\nhis article.  More than likely, if you wanted some kind of Recorder like<br/>\nthis you would have an update method on the observed classes that would<br/>\ncause the observer(s) to update itself.  If you wanted to get specific<br/>\ninformation about the class that is updating (like the method name), you<br/>\ncould use the second parameter of the update method from the Observer<br/>\ninterface.  Or if you have need of that param for something else, use double<br/>\ndispatching to call back on the observable.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn short, it&#39;s a bad smell if you don&#39;t need it (either through his<br/>\nimplementation or through your own).  <br/>\n<br/>\n-Jason</div>",
