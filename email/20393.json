That is, if for example one thing you need to parse is a<br/>\n&gt; color specification, extract that logic into a ColorParser. That makes<br/>\n&gt; it both easier to test in isolation, easier to read and maintain and<br/>\n&gt; more reusable.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Does that help?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Cheers, Ilja<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; sunburned.surveyor wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m still rather new to JUnit (although I&#39;ve purchased at least two<br/>\n&gt; &gt; (2) JUnit books)and I&#39;m finally getting around to actually using unit<br/>\n&gt; &gt; tests for my code.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve ran into a puzzling situation, and I&#39;m looking for suggestions<br/>\n&gt; &gt; on how to [1] properly test code using JUnit or [2] refactor my code<br/>\n&gt; &gt; so that it can be tested.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The class in question parses a fairly complex text file and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; constructs a single Java object from it. There is a single public<br/>\n&gt; &gt; parse method that returns an instance of this object. Inside this<br/>\n&gt; &gt; public parse method several private helper methods are called.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Basically the job of the public method is to call the private helper<br/>\n&gt; &gt; methods in the correct sequence, based on the contents of the file<br/>\n&gt; &gt; being parsed.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Here is my question: I want to verify that the logic in parts of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; these private helper methods does what I intend. Although I know a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; failure of any of these &quot;logic parts&quot; in a private helper method<br/>\n&gt; &gt; would be reflected in a failure of the public method. However, I want<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to pinpoint which of the &quot;logic parts&quot; failing.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Have I left the realm of unit testing and moved on to some type of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; functional testing? Do I need to refactor these &quot;logic parts&quot; into<br/>\n&gt; &gt; their own private methods, and then use a framework like JUnitX to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; test these private methods? Do I write some beanshell scripts that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; test this logic instead?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Thanks for any suggestions on how to proceed. I know this problem is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; due to my lack of experience with software testing, and is not a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; problem with JUnit.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The Sunburned Surveyor<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
