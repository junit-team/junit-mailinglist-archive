The simple way is to have a key on the exception for a resource <br/>\nbundle, which lets you look up a message pattern, which you then use to <br/>\ncreate an error message with the data in the exception. (There are, of <br/>\ncourse, other ways to do this, and not all exceptions should result in <br/>\nerror messages being presented to huamns, anyway)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you use this approach, it is important to ensure in your tests that you <br/>\nconstruct Exceptions with sufficent information.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobert.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n                &quot;Software is too expensive to build cheaply&quot;<br/>\nRobert Watkins         <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://twasink.net/\">http://twasink.net/</a>          <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:robertdw@...\">robertdw@...</a></div>",
