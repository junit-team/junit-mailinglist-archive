And I also often prefer interfaces over =\r\nabstract classes. But I do not always use interfaces. Interfaces and abstra=\r\nct classes both have their place. It&#39;s hard to find simple rules to decide =\r\nwhat to use where.\n\nI personally don&#39;t see having TestRule as an abstract c=\r\nlass causing a burdon for competent developers. Since TestRule has only one=\r\n method, it&#39;s very easy to use delegation to share code. You could have you=\r\nr Rule have many methods that delegate to another object, or your Rule coul=\r\nd have a single accessor to get the delegate, or you could create the Rule =\r\nby calling a method on another object.\n\nIn any case, what we could use is d=\r\nata. Can someone give concrete cases were making TestRule an abstract class=\r\n has caused problems? Let&#39;s get them out now, before 4.9 releases.\n\n-- Kevi=\r\nn\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, Malte Finsterwalder &lt;malte@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n I would rather use an interface and not an abstract class.\n&gt; \n&gt; My reasoni=\r\nng:\n&gt; I see the tradeoff between:\n&gt; Give the most power and flexibility to =\r\nthe competent programmer that\n&gt; knows what he is doing: Interface\n&gt; Prevent=\r\n stupid misuse errors: Abstract class.\n&gt; \n&gt; I would always prefer the first=\r\n solution, so I would like the\n&gt; interface version much better.\n&gt; Prevent t=\r\nhe stupid misuse through good documentation.
