If your issue is simply that \n&gt;you want to guarantee the ordering of your test cases, you can cheat by \n&gt;having white box knowledge of the implementation of junit. If you don&#39;t \n&gt;use the reflection method of adding tests (i.e. - explicitly adding the \n&gt;test) you know that the tests will execute in the same order in which they \n&gt;were added. Note that JUnit does not advertise any contract in this area \n&gt;and the underlying implementation of test case execution could change at \n&gt;any release.\n\ni am new to testing an junit, but it it seems that you would like the unit \ntests for each class to be run before any tests that involve combinations \nof a class or involve a package at a higher level. if you get a bunch of \nerrors in your utility package, you probably want to bail and reporting \nthese in a bottom up manner will make it easier to see where the problem \nstarts.\n\n&gt;...\n&gt;Functional testing of API&#39;s have many of the same design and usage \n&gt;patterns of any functional test tool out on the market. Keep in mind that \n&gt;if tests have dependencies - you will effectively be blocked from \n&gt;executing dependent tests when you encounter a failure. This has a bad \n&gt;smell, weather you are doing functional, unit - or using a commercial tool \n&gt;like Silk or LoadRunner. That being said, sometimes it does make sense to \n&gt;couple test cases, or a series of test cases - but you need to understand \n&gt;the tradeoffs before doing this.\n\ni agree about the bad smell, but i am looking at using junit, cactus, \nhttpunit etc. to test some web apps. it seems that there are at least 3 \nlevels of tests from unit tests on each class to a functional test of a web \napp. and the associated dependencies. does anyon know how people have \nstructured their tests in such cases?\n\nthanks\n\n   ----- Original Message -----\n&gt;   From: erikstunkat\n&gt;   To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;   Sent: Friday, April 19, 2002 7:25 AM\n&gt;   Subject: [junit] Re: junit tests and functional/ integration tests\n&gt;\n&gt;...  We have junit tests and java property files.
