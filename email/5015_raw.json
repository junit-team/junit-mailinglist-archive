On their secon=\r\nd\nassignment, I had them write tests for the class they\nimplemented in thei=\r\nr first assignment. (Yes, I know, that&#39;s not\ntest first...)  On the second =\r\nassigment, I ran their unit tests\nagainst my implementation of the first as=\r\nsignment&#39;s class.  I\nused the text user interface as this made batching up =\r\nthe tests\neasier.  However, on inspection of the student&#39;s code, I had\nseve=\r\nral students whose tests passed, but they didn&#39;t actually call\nassert*() or=\r\n fail().  For example:\n\npublic class MP0Test extends TestCase {\n  ...\n  pub=\r\nlic void testGetValue() {\n      MP0class mp0 =3D readConfig();\n       mp0.g=\r\netValue() =3D=3D 42;\n  }\n}\n\nDoes anyone think JUnit should give  some kind =\r\nof warning\nwhen no assert* or fail is called in a test* method?\n\nJoel Jones=\r\n\njones@...\n\n\n\n\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\njuni=\r\nt-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n\n\nYour use of Yahoo!
