Now I want to test whether these <br/>\nvalues are set correctly. I can use preset values for testing <br/>\npurpose. But due to the large number and complexity of these classes <br/>\nit would be very difficult and cumbersome to create objects with <br/>\nthese preset values manually for testing against the ones created by <br/>\nthe Reader.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am thinking of creating a helper class for each of the above <br/>\nclasses. I will pass it the object to compare, and it will compare <br/>\nthe object&#39;s data against pre-defined values that will be stored in <br/>\nthe helper classes. I will need to extend junit&#39;s Assert class for <br/>\nthese helper class, since they will assert if there is a data <br/>\nmismatch. So my question is,  is it okay to extend Assert in my own <br/>\nclasses ? Has anyone faced this problem before, and if so how did you <br/>\nsolve this ? Any help will be appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n- krishnan</div>",
