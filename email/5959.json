I want <br/>\nto walk through the tree recursively and check the URL at each node. <br/>\nIf one of the URLs are corrupted I want to throw a failure or an <br/>\nerror and proceed with checking.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I don&#39;t want to have is to fill a Map or something like that, <br/>\nwhere I collect corrupted URLs, while I don&#39;t throw a failure each <br/>\ntime i foun a bad URL, but printing the corruptedLinksList after <br/>\nTestTermination.<br/>\nInsted of this, I would like to generate a TestCase for each URL in <br/>\nthe tree dynamicaly at runtime and run this TestCase at each URL-node <br/>\nof the tree. <br/>\nIs this possible? Is there any example, how to do this? Does anyone <br/>\nhave any better idea?<br/>\n<br/>\nHave a nice and peacefull day!<br/>\n<br/>\n    Wolfgang</div>",
