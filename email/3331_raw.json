The way the DE as you call it\n&gt; sends messages is a function of how it is configured and I\n&gt; have tests for the &quot;local&quot; version that just uses Java calls.\n&gt; \n&gt; I think what I am doing is moving into a system type test...\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks for the reference to Mock etc. I am a little unsure about\n&gt; these as we are using JUnit for unit and system/integration\n&gt; testing (differentiating these clearly) and I can (hopefully)\n&gt; have my unit tests not need mock objects and make sure the system\n&gt; tests cover this. Thoughts? We will be using HttpUnit and/or\n&gt; Cactus for the system tests. We define system tests to be ones\n&gt; the require the application to be deployed in a container\n&gt; and running...\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Alan.\n&gt; \n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Manu [mailto:mamago@...]\n&gt; Sent: 21 November 2001 19:08\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: RE: [junit] Using JUnit or Cactus for testing JMS\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I have not used JMS, therefore I can only guess...\n&gt; \n&gt; What you want to test is the &#39;Decision Engine&#39; (DE), right? Then, why\n&gt; don&#39;t you test the DE?\n&gt; \n&gt; Approach:\n&gt; Write a couple of tests that use known &#39;Reject&#39; and &#39;Accept&#39; messages.\n&gt; If\n&gt; a test case allows a &#39;Reject&#39; message through (no need to use the whole\n&gt; JMS system, just put the pre-constructed message through the appropriate\n&gt; procedure call), the test has failed. The opposite is also true: if\n&gt; an\n&gt; &#39;Accept&#39; message is rejected, the test fails.\n&gt; \n&gt; You could also test the &#39;Destination (To) Engine&#39; (TE). Create a couple\n&gt; of messages for some known destinations, and check that the chosen\n&gt; destination for the given message has been chosen. Otherwise, the test\n&gt; fails.\n&gt; \n&gt; (If the DE and TE are combined into one method, try combining the test\n&gt; cases: known recepient/&#39;Reject&#39;/&#39;Accept&#39; pair. Otherwise, look into\n&gt; separating both procedures, although this may not be practical.)\n&gt; \n&gt; In creating these tests, it might help to know about Mock Objects,\n&gt; or\n&gt; other alternatives (Object Mother, etc.). See the NG archives for\n&gt; pointers.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Manuel Amago.\n&gt; mailto:mamago@...\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; &gt; From: Alan Pearlman Spencer [mailto:aspencer@...]\n&gt; &gt; Sent: 21 November 2001 10:20\n&gt; &gt; To: Cactus Users List; junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [junit] Using JUnit or Cactus for testing JMS\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi All,\n&gt; &gt; I was wondering if you could help me with something...\n&gt; &gt; I am trying to write Unit/System tests...\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
