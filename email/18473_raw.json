The primary win is that the thing you&#39;re \n&gt; trying to assert is separated from the act of asserting, so \n&gt; that you can write:\n\nYes, I&#39;ve been experimenting with the use of Constraints in Asserts\nin a different environment - my NUnitLite project - and I see\nthat there are two reasons to do it.\n\n1) Putting the thing you want to assert into a separate object\nenables all kinds of reuse and extensibility and makes the \ncode within the framework much simpler and clearer.\n\n2) The &quot;literate&quot; aspect is that the end user can write much\nmore readable asserts. That part is a matter of taste, however,\nand it&#39;s very easy to build more a traditional interface on top\nof constraints - the reverse is harder, I found.\n\nHere&#39;s one of my favorite NUnitLite-style tests... It&#39;s C#,\nof course, but trivial to implement in Java too...\n\n   Assert.That( arrayOfDoubles, Is.All.GreaterThan( 0.0 ) );\n\nCharlie\n\nCharlie\n\n\n\n",
