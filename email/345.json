This feels <br/>\nextremely<br/>\n&gt; heavy..<br/>\n&gt; Is there a recommended approach that someone had good results with?<br/>\n&gt; Im thinking in the lines of having all the test cases in a separate <br/>\nWAR or<br/>\n&gt; EAR, and maybee incorporate log4j to simplify the testing.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; But using printing to log4j as a result source would give the <br/>\nproduction<br/>\n&gt; code a unwanted overhead as well as be a very ugly way of conduct.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Please, if you&#39;ve got a good design for JUnit testing in the J2EE<br/>\n&gt; environment, share it with me.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; WR </span></blockquote></div>",
