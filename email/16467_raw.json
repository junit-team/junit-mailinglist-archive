The general idea is that a failure is typically a problem with \nyour production code, whereas an error could be a problem with your \ntest, the environment, or a serious problem with your production code.\n\nIn general, unless I know exactly what caused the error (for example, \nbecause I just wrote the test), I run the tests again. If the error \npersists, I look for configuration problems.\n\nThe better you practise TDD, the less important the difference becomes.\n\nI hope that helps.\n-- \nJ. B.
