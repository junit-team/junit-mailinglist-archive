B. Rainsberger&quot; &lt;jbrains@r...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt; cypherfox wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; How the heck do people mock things like database\n&gt; &gt; access classes, mail servers, arbitrary web requests,\n&gt; &gt; etc., without writing a huge amount of logic?\n&gt; \n&gt; Surprisingly easily. You might just need some good examples. See\n_JUnit \n&gt; Recipes_, part 2, for details.\n\nHeh...  Plug, plug, plug.  No argument, I&#39;ll probably read it, I&#39;m\nenough of a JUnit fan for that.  I&#39;ve read several other books and\nnone seems to clearly define how a mock object is supposed to\nbehave, or how complex you&#39;re supposed to make them.\n\n&gt; &gt; What am I missing?\n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s tough to say. Without looking at a specific example, I can&#39;t\nsay \n&gt; much more. Can you get concrete about a mock you wrote that\nexploded out \n&gt; of control? Can we see code?\n\nSure, the most recent example of this to me, was this class:\n  http://www.vixen.com/code/JournalHash.java\nimplementing\n  http://www.vixen.com/code/JournalDataStore.java\n\n(All the JavaDoc is in the interface, which is why I put that\nthere also, mildly sanitized so my company name isn&#39;t\nout there.)\n\nOne of the things that isn&#39;t even in there, is the concept of\n&#39;get most recent &#39;n&#39; entries&#39;, because that would require me\nto walk backwards through the TreeMap, or add a *third*\nrepresentation of the same data, as a linked list or something.\n\nI found it frustrating to have to do this much work for what\nwas really just a testing class.  It DID let me put off doing\nthe JDBC code until later, however.  Thankfully it was a\n&#39;generic&#39; enough interface that the code didn&#39;t change\nnoticably when doing the actual DB storage code.\n\n--  Morgan Schweers\n\n\n",
