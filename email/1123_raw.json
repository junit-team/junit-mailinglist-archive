I&#39;m building on a Unix machine, which means that the\njava ui has to connect to an X server somewhere. If it doesn&#39;t, then\nall the gui-related tests fail, since they can&#39;t open their windows.\n\nHas anybody solved this problem before? The best answers I can come up\nwith are to either separate out the gui tests that require a window to\nbe opened (anything dealing with geometry it seems), or replace the\nvisible windows with in-memory windows and see if that helps. \n\nAny suggestions are welcome...\n\nbab\n\n-- \nBrian Button            bbutton@...\nSenior Consultant       Object Mentor, Inc\nSt. Louis, MO\t\thttp://www.objectmentor.com\n\n\n",
