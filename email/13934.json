It&#39;s mostly just that I like to have a really clear <br/>\ndistinction between public (and protected) interfaces and non-public <br/>\ninterfaces in my libraries. Public interfaces can be counted on and <br/>\nrelied on, won&#39;t change without a deprecation cycle, must be documented <br/>\nin JavaDoc, and so forth. Non-public methods/classes don&#39;t need to be.<br/>\n<br/>\nMostly it just offends my sense of programming aesthetics to have all <br/>\nthese public classes and interfaces that aren&#39;t really part of the <br/>\npublished interfaces. Practically it means I have to do extra work to <br/>\nmake sure they don&#39;t show up in JavaDoc; don&#39;t get tested as public by <br/>\nstatic code checking tools, and the like. Bottom line: test classes are <br/>\nfor the developers; not the public. I think most developers pretty much <br/>\nknow they can&#39;t count on the interface to any test case. However, I&#39;d <br/>\nstill like to enforce that if I could.<br/>\n<br/>\nGoing forward in Java 1.6/1.7, I expect this to be a bigger issue. It <br/>\nshould soon become possible for subpackages to see the package protected <br/>\nparts of their super packages. Once that happens, there&#39;ll be much less <br/>\ntendency to make everything public and to distinguish between public and <br/>\npublished interfaces. The less we have to put in public the better.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nElliotte Rusty Harold  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:elharo@...\">elharo@...</a><br/>\nXML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/\">http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim\">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim</a></div>",
