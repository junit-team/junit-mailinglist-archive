BUT in some cases this solution can be a desirable one. Therefore I think this solution, along with others (see below) should be provided.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy current need for global rules is:<br/>\n- I am developing a Swing console, called TestUI, that will allow you to visually see the results of your tests, the tests that failed and those that succeeded. You will also be able to specify a path to watch for Surefire reports, therefore combining analytical functions with report functions (the report functions are those for which I need global rules).<br/>\n<br/>\n@David: I took a look at RunListener, and indeed it solves my problem (just like a TestWatchman-derived rule would), except that it is very inconvenient to use. For example, at work I have 110 modules, and a total number of 800 unit tests. I would like to globally hook up my TestUIAgentRule, to report to my TestUI console each test that is executed.<br/>\n<br/>\nI execute the tests from Eclipse or from Maven, during build sessions. Therefore I cannot use RunListener or a Rule for this. I need some global mechanism to enable a Rule for all the executed tests.<br/>\n<br/>\nExcept for JVM params, here is another idea: having a junit properties/XML configuration file. It has been suggested on this message group that junit should have a configuration file, and I am PRO this solution.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn such a config file (available soomewhere in the classpath, like the log4j.properties), we could specifiy:<br/>\n- which tests to execute/exclude/ignore<br/>\n- global rules<br/>\n- test suites to run/exclude<br/>\n- categories to run/exclude<br/>\n<br/>\nThis could also solve this problem: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/junit/message/22184.\">http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/junit/message/22184.</a> The request here (read the first post in the thread) asks for a GUI where unit tests could be disabled, like light bulbs (PS: my TestUI console will be able to do this, sometime in the <br/>\nfuture releases).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do you think of this?<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\nBogdan<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, Joakim Ohlrogge &lt;joakim.ohlrogge@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi Bogdan,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I can see where you&#39;re coming from with system properties to solve this.<br/>\n&gt; I would much rather have some way of solving this where you would not have<br/>\n&gt; to rely on a property being set at the JVM-level. The reason is that it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; very inconvenient to have to set run parameters if you just want to rerun a<br/>\n&gt; single test (in eclipse that&#39;s a run configuration rather than just<br/>\n&gt; rightclicking on a test in the runner). If JUnit instead would look for a<br/>\n&gt; standard property-file or similar (like junit-rules.properties in the root<br/>\n&gt; of your class-path and merge all found resources found like<br/>\n&gt; getClass().getClassLoader().getResources(&quot;/junit-rules.properties&quot;) then it<br/>\n&gt; would just work with no external configuration like launch parameters or<br/>\n&gt; script parameters.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; With VM-parameters I don&#39;t see that the feature would be useful for anything<br/>\n&gt; that influences the testrun, just for collecting information about the run.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -----------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Joakim Ohlrogge<br/>\n&gt; Agical AB<br/>\n&gt; Västerlånggatan 79, 2 tr<br/>\n&gt; 111 29 Stockholm, SWEDEN<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Mobile: +46-708-754004<br/>\n&gt; Blog: johlrogge.wordpress.com<br/>\n&gt; E-mail: joakim.ohlrogge@...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On Sat, Dec 5, 2009 at 8:46 PM, Bogdan &lt;<br/>\n&gt; bogdan.mocanu.notifications@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hi guys,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; thank you very much for your responses.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I didn&#39;t know about the RunListener, so I will definitely take a look at<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it, and come back with an answer regarding it.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; What I was thinking about the global rules is to be able to configure<br/>\n&gt; &gt; something like global rules, that are specified as a startup parameter (read<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Java option) when starting the test (in the project at my office, we have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; like 750 tests, and therefore would work just nice to configure this option<br/>\n&gt; &gt; just for my env; probably the RunListener will work just like that, so as I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; said, I will read about this).<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I was thinking about something like this:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; java<br/>\n&gt; &gt; -Djunit.globalRules=com.test.myrules.SomeNiceRule,com.test.myrules.SomeNiceRule2<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ..........<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Cheers,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Bogdan<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a> &lt;junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt;, &quot;Bogdan&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &lt;bogdan.mocanu.notifications@&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi everyone,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; as we have it currently, we can place a Rule in a test, and that rule<br/>\n&gt; &gt; will be activated for that test. To have the rule working in several tests,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; you have to place the Rule in each test.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; However, I am searching for a way to activate a Rule for all the tests<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that are executed, without needing to add the rule to each test. Perhaps by<br/>\n&gt; &gt; specifying a Java property parameter when running the tests (I could also<br/>\n&gt; &gt; set this as a global Java option, therefore being used upon each execution<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of the JVM).<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Do you know if this is possible?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The reason why I need this, is: I am making the plans and gathering the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ideas for creating a simple Swing application that will display the results<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of the executed tests (just like the JUnit view in Eclipse/Idea/Netbeans,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; but perhaps with more details, and also available for anyone, not just IDE<br/>\n&gt; &gt; users). Currently I developed a small agent rule, that you can place in your<br/>\n&gt; &gt; test, and it will report to the console the status of your tests (the Swing<br/>\n&gt; &gt; console runs remotely).<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; This is ok, but it means that you will have to add this rule to each and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; every test that you have. It also means that will not be an easy task to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; disable this rule, if you don&#39;t want it anymore.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Therefore a possibility to enable Rules globally for all tests I think is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the best solution for my case, and also a good tool to have for various<br/>\n&gt; &gt; other tasks.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; What do you think? Also, what do you think about the Swing console idea?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Cheers,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Bogdan<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  <br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
