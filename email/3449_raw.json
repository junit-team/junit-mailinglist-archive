This profile prevents it from loading classes from\narbitrary locations. This behavior was a design choice on Sun&#39;s part- the\nextension loader is intended to support the requirements of your run of\nthe mill executable jars, not the unusual needs of junit.\n\nThe swingui and awtui work fine because they create their own classloader\nand it is the same whether or not they are loaded via jre/lib/ext. The\ncustom classloader, however, has a number of known bugs in it which cause\npeople problems from time to time. Some folks use the textui specifically\nto avoid these problems.\n\nIt&#39;s probably a better idea to put junit in your classpath. If you are\ncompiling on several different systems which require different classpaths,\nI can give you some hints on how to do this cleanly with ANT.\n\nOn Wed, 5 Dec 2001, Daniel Le Berre wrote:\n\n&gt; Hi guys,\n&gt;\n&gt; When I put the junit.jar in the jre/lib/ext directory to get\n&gt; junit without changing all the users classpath, the\n&gt; junit.textui.TestRunner does not find my classes.\n&gt;\n&gt; However, both swingui and awtui TestRunners are working fine.\n&gt;\n&gt; If I put the junit.jar in my classpath, everything works fine.\n&gt;\n&gt; I do believe than the problem comes from the use of the default\n&gt; class loader in testui.TestRunner: when I use the extension\n&gt; mechanism, only the core classes and the ones in the extension\n&gt; directory can be found by the default class loader.\n&gt;\n&gt; Would it be possible to use the custom class loader also for textui\n&gt; to solve the problem?\n&gt;\n&gt; \tDaniel\n&gt;\n\n-- \nEric Vought\nChief Technical Officer - QLUE Consulting, Inc.\n\nevought@... toll-free: 888-771-3538  RTP area: 919-816-9901\n\n\n",
