But then if we are accepting that testing<br/>\n&gt; public/friendly/protected methods adecuately test these methods, why not<br/>\n </span></blockquote>go<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; one step beyond and say that black box testing is all we need? It seems to<br/>\n&gt; me that testing private methods is as useful and valid as testing<br/>\n&gt; non-private ones, just at a different level of granularity.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>snip<br/>\n<br/>\n    yes, you may test private methods. But that is not what actually is<br/>\nintended by unit testing. The idea is to write tests for the unit and<br/>\nthereby to specify what this unit is capable of. The idea of unit testing is<br/>\nnot testing per se. The cool thing is that you finish writing your unit,<br/>\nwhen your tests pass, which cuts down time in testing and implementation.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Later unit testing (the TestAll called when integrating) helps us<br/>\nfinding out misbehaving units after refactoring or other code changes.<br/>\n<br/>\n    I know that this aproach is not based on mathematical abductions but on<br/>\nexperience. Thus I don&#39;t want to make a religion out of it, but just do it<br/>\nas good habbit.<br/>\nAnd I don&#39;t believe that there is a proof, that testing is more and more<br/>\nefficiant, the more granular you test. Well, you could test every line of<br/>\ncode.<br/>\n<br/>\nToyin</div>",
