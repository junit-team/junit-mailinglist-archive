I can dig into it myself if no one has done so, but am \n&gt; hoping that someone has already done this and can help me save some \n&gt; time and effort (that really needs to go toward building and \ntesting \n&gt; my code... :-)\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; \n&gt; Jim\n\nHi Jim,\nAny success in getting JUnit to run as an addin with JDeveloper9i?\nCheers,\nEddie\n\n\n\n",
