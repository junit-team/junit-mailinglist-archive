What I was trying to do was before testing a \ncase or cases which has a few steps transaction, so for parts of the \ntransaction I was putting asserts although JUnit will fail it when it \nfirst finds it but the drawback is it don&#39;t tell which one so what I \ndid was I changed to throw the AssertFailureException(&quot;Message&quot;) and \nI got the desired results.\n\nThanks everyone.\nPrabhat\n\n\n\n",
