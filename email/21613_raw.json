It does  sound a little scary -- at some point you get into &quot;why  \nnot roll my own&quot; territory, which is a dangerous way to be thinking!\n\nI remember know that I did look at using Runner before but it wasn&#39;t  \nclear how to get back into the core functionality once I&#39;d implemented  \nmy own. I was looking at BlockJUnit4ClassRunner which sounds like its  \nnot what I want. Its still looking pretty complex to me even after  \nlooking at the SuiteRunner code but maybe I&#39;m just having a slow brain  \nday. But it doesn&#39;t look like I can use inheirit from Suite or Parent  \nRunner for example because they both are looking for a class.\n\n\n&quot;A runner that creates a suite from a set of names should be  \nstraightforward given you can compute the number of tests beforehand,  \neg. because the class can already be loaded or you know the names of  \ntest methods per class from some other source.&quot;\n\nI think one question is the key make or break though -- does JUnit  \nexpect to traverse the entire test tree before running any tests? The  \nreason I ask is because the above is not quite true -- I don&#39;t  \nactually know the names of the test methods at runtime, or at lest I&#39;d  \nlike to obtain them from the generated classes. To simplify down to  \nbrass tasks, what I basically need to do is use JUnit exactly the same  \nway, except to substitute just one set of nodes in the test traversal  \ntree -- for class discovery to load the classes by name. But the trick  \nof course is that needs to be deferred until test run-time.\n\nthanks,\n\nMiles\n\n\nOn May 14, 2009, at 6:10 AM, David Saff wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Miles,\n&gt;\n&gt; I think that we ran into a real expectation mismatch when we called\n&gt; one of the key extension classes in JUnit 4 &quot;Runner&quot;. &quot;Write your own\n&gt; Runner&quot; makes it sound as if you&#39;re being asked to rewrite something\n&gt; like Eclipse&#39;s entire launching infrastructure, when, in truth, it&#39;s\n&gt; probably on the same level of complexity as a TestNG factory.\n&gt;\n&gt; That said, you do need to have committed to the names and total number\n&gt; of tests you&#39;re going to run before any test case is run. Do the\n&gt; classes have to be generated in a test case, or can a pre-running step\n&gt; compute them all, and a test case can assert that they are all there?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt;\n&gt; David Saff\n&gt;\n&gt; On Wed, May 13, 2009 at 12:26 PM, Miles Parker  \n&gt; &lt;milesparker@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Thanks Johannes,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; It&#39;s pretty straightforward in its own way. I need to execute an  \n&gt; arbitrary\n&gt; &gt; set of test methods (using @test annotations) against a known --  \n&gt; but not yet\n&gt; &gt; existent at JUnit launch time -- set of classes. Those classes are  \n&gt; generated\n&gt; &gt; and compiled in a previous test case within same session and then  \n&gt; need to be\n&gt; &gt; loaded dynamically. Ideally, I would present the name of classes  \n&gt; as Strings;\n&gt; &gt; I understand that JUnit has a way to do this dynamically for  \n&gt; method names\n&gt; &gt; but I can&#39;t find a similar feature for class names -- everything  \n&gt; I&#39;ve tried\n&gt; &gt; ends up forcing me to have an explicit compiled reference at test  \n&gt; harness\n&gt; &gt; launch time.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; And of course I&#39;d really like not to have to write my own runner\n&gt; &gt; implementation. ;) In TestNG I can do this with factories but our  \n&gt; build\n&gt; &gt; environment currently only supports JUnit.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Miles\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; On Wed, May 13, 2009 at 4:23 AM, Johannes Link  \n&gt; &lt;jl@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I guess your own runner implementation to use with @RunWith could  \n&gt; do the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; trick.

For\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; example, my use case is launching some tests from an Eclipse  \n&gt; plugin\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; test for code-generated classes.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; This situation is actually more difficult under JUnit4 because of\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; reliance on annotations. I can&#39;t find a path that doesn&#39;t require\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; class names to exist at compile time.
