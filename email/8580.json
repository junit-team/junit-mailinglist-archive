If he doesn&#39;t understand a business domain, it can be <br/>\n&gt; quite hard for him to understand the intent. I find <br/>\n&gt; documentation on business domain and the way it was <br/>\n&gt; abstracted into code usefull.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Good point.  I work at an HRMS/HR Portal provider company.  Domain knowledge even across apps within the same overall business domain (e.g., benefits enrollment vs. compensation planning, or business rules relevant to filling out a w4 online vs. adding a dependent) can be spread across quite a breadth of knowledge.<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Also, documentation on larger scale solutions, architecture, <br/>\n&gt; patterns can also be usefull to communicate the intent, <br/>\n&gt; because it is much more difficult to understand and get &quot;the <br/>\n&gt; bigger picture&quot; from code.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, especially if you don&#39;t name things with the names of the patterns they implement.  That is, putting on your design pattern hunter hat is more of a pain than if someone documents (in names or in comments) that a class is some kind of Registry or Observer or ServiceLocator, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nScott Stirling<br/>\nWorkscape, Inc.</div>",
