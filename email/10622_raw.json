It is integrated with Eclipse to use JUnit.\n\nOn the upside I see that there is the knowledge that at least some \nunit testing is being done to all code. Most of the developers here \ndo not test.\n\nOn the downside (my personal opinion), test-writing first or at least \nat the same time as coding is much more effective than test-writing \nafter the fact. Code written without testing in mind is not very \ntestable. I don&#39;t see how JTest can help there although the code \nstandards module would seem to help.\n\n\nFor those who don&#39;t know, Parasoft&#39;s JTest is a tool to automatically \ngenerate tests for your code. It does a number of other things also.\n\nThanks!\n\n\n\n",
