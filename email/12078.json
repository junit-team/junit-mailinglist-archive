How do I JUnit and,<br/>\n&gt; especially, TDD this?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not familiar with the framework, but it appears that you&#39;re <br/>\nimplementating a class that will be invoked by the Doclet framework.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow fortunately, RootDoc is an interface, so we ought to be able to mock <br/>\nit, or provide a simple implementation of it, to pass in to the method <br/>\nstart(), which I /assume/ you&#39;re trying to test-drive.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would start with a few learning tests to discover what a RootDoc looks <br/>\nlike for a real-life set of Javadocs. Then I would use that information <br/>\nto understand how to simulate the methods of RootDoc. That would give me <br/>\nenough information to start test-driving start().<br/>\n<br/>\nI know this isn&#39;t particularly satisfying, but it&#39;s what I would do if I <br/>\nwere you. At least you have a pair partner to work with!<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
