With JMock, it does not work, you<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; have to rely on text completion features.<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; With EasyMock, it works like a charm.<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; I do admit that this is a shortcoming, but I don&#39;t find that annoying<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; when I use jMock. In fact, in an odd way, if I find I really<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; want code completion when defining fakes or expectations, then perhaps<br/>\n&gt; my<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; interface is too complex. :)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This raises an issue which I don&#39;t *think* I&#39;ve seen mentioned here.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I find that there&#39;s a bit of a benefit when writing test code with<br/>\n&gt; EasyMock (either version) in that after typing in what I want to be<br/>\n&gt; called before it exists, I can then ask Eclipse to generate all the<br/>\n&gt; methods for me, in both the interface and the class. The tests really do<br/>\n&gt; drive the code - it&#39;s only when a test requires a method to be present<br/>\n&gt; that it gets put in the interface, because I don&#39;t end up writing the<br/>\n&gt; interface declarations by hand in the first place. (Of course, I add<br/>\n&gt; documentation and might change the parameter names later, but that&#39;s a<br/>\n&gt; different matter.)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Just a small benefit, but I thought I&#39;d mention it...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Jon (a very happy EasyMock user)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It&#39;s the other side of the coin: either you prefer generating the <br/>\nmethod, but have to pay for /having/ to generate it, or you prefer not <br/>\nto have to generate it, but have to pay for having to type it by hand. I <br/>\nthink it&#39;s strictly a personal taste thing: the price is the same.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
