So far I have used Ant<br/>\n&gt; &gt;to write test-scipts (based on the command line interface for my <br/>\n&gt; &gt;application). Of course, these test are not really unit tests, but <br/>\n&gt; &gt;application tests. Nevertheless, they are very useful.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;My question is therefore, does anybody have any ideas about <br/>\n&gt; &gt;converting already existing Ant based tests to JUnit?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Basically, I am using some Ant functionality to copy directories <br/>\n&gt; &gt;files, call javac, and define some properties. I wouldn&#39;t like to <br/>\n&gt; &gt;rewrite all the scripts in Java, but calling Ant from JUnit turns <br/>\n </span></blockquote>out <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;to be a bit ackward as well.
