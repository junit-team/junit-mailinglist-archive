It is a bit expensive at\nabout �5000 per license per machine though!! In\naddition if you build your code using ANT you could\nconfigure it to look for test cases that relate to\nyour code so long as you name your tests in a standard\nway.\n\ncheers\n\nDavid\n  \n--- John Stetic &lt;johns@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Thanks for all the suggestions.  We are looking at\n&gt; some commercial code\n&gt; coverage tools - and I&#39;ll definitely check into the\n&gt; open source options now\n&gt; - but that&#39;s not really what I&#39;m trying to\n&gt; accomplish.  (I was wondering if\n&gt; using the term code coverage might confuse the\n&gt; issue).  I want to do a\n&gt; static analyst of the code to check which classes\n&gt; and methods have tests.\n&gt; Think of it as Lint for Junit - Jint perhaps :-)\n&gt; \n&gt; John \n&gt; \n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Michael Silverstein\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Sent: 6/25/01 9:05 PM\n&gt; Subject: RE: [junit] Test coverage metrics reporting\n&gt; tool\n&gt; \n&gt; With Test Mentor (which among other things discovers\n&gt; and runs JUnit\n&gt; tests)\n&gt; we use the JPDA http://java.sun.com/products/jpda/\n&gt; to dynamically\n&gt; monitor\n&gt; method entry events during test execution.

(I&#39;m\n&gt; sure someone\n&gt; &gt; has.)   What I\n&gt; &gt; what to do is generate a report that shows some\n&gt; stats on how many\n&gt; classes\n&gt; &gt; have test cases and how many methods in the class\n&gt; under test have\n&gt; &gt; corresponding test methods.  I have tried it a few\n&gt; different ways:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 1. Just scanning through the source folder,\n&gt; picking up the java files\n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; then checking if a ?Test.java file exists in a\n&gt; corresponding unit test\n&gt; &gt; folder.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; This approach works well if I only cared about the\n&gt; file coverage,\n&gt; &gt; but I now\n&gt; &gt; want info on the method coverage.  Enter method 2.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 2. Use a tool that will parse through the java\n&gt; source and tell me all\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; methods. I used javadoc for this, but the problem\n&gt; with it is that\n&gt; &gt; I can only\n&gt; &gt; sort through one source structure at a time, and\n&gt; javadoc is not so\n&gt; nice to\n&gt; &gt; call programmatically (it shuts down your app\n&gt; after it runs once).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If anyone has suggestions on a better was to get\n&gt; info on the methods\n&gt; in a\n&gt; &gt; class, and other information like is the class an\n&gt; interface, I\n&gt; &gt; would love to\n&gt; &gt; hear it.  Or better yet, if anyone has seen or\n&gt; built a tool\n&gt; &gt; similar to what\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m doing I would also love to hear about it.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; John\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; &gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
