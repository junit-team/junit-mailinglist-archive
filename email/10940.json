Just as there is no substitute<br/>\nfor actually testing the model and control, there is no substitute for<br/>\nactually testing the view itself, with actual UI events. Anything less<br/>\nis merely speculative, at best second-best.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I have previously stated (e.g.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/junit/message/10457\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/junit/message/10457</a><br/>\n<br/>\n) it was at one time legitimate to say &quot;I can&#39;t xUnit my UI, so I will<br/>\ntry to do the best I can,&quot; i.e. create a thin UI well-separated from<br/>\nits model and control. But it was *never* legitimate to make a virtue<br/>\nof necessity, to say (as you do) that &quot;separation is the solution.&quot;<br/>\nNow that you *can* drive your UIs from JUnit, and therefore you can<br/>\n*fully* test your UIs, your claim is illegitimate, and moreover<br/>\nencourages the &quot;anti-test-infection.&quot;</div>",
