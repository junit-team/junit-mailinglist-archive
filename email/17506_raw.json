Over the last 7 years I have\n&gt; come to the following conclusions:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. There are no instances in which TDD is impossible.\n&gt; 2. There are no instances in which TDD is not advantageous.\n&gt; 3. The impediments to TDD are human, not technical.\n&gt; 4. The alternative to TDD is code that is not repeatably testable.\n&gt; \n&gt; Therefore I consider TDD to be a minimum professional standard.\n&gt; Developers who do not use TDD fall below that standard.\n\nI can&#39;t quite agree with that, but I would be thrilled to wake up one \nmorning to find out that it&#39;s true. If that became /the/ minimum \nprofessional standard (whatever that would mean), I wouldn&#39;t complain.\n-- \nJ. B.
