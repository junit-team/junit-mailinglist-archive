( Here I mean commercial project rather than\n&gt; open-source project. )\n\n\nI think if Junit is used from the beginning it makes it go faster.\n\nDuring development bugs have a harder time creeping in because the tests\nprotect the existing behavior.\n\nWith a test framework in place, when new bugs are found, the tests are\naugmented to cover that case and you can can worry less about that bugs\ncoming back.\n\nWell tested code makes integration faster because the tests are working\nexamples of how to use the API of a class.\n\nQ/A should go faster because the underlying code has less bugs.\n\nI&#39;ll speculate it makes production bug fixes alot faster and safer, but the\nprojects I&#39;ve had to maintain have not had unit test coverage with\nJunit (which sucks).\n\n\n* One intersting point I found is that after Junit-based testing is\n&gt; introduced, programmers tend to use IDE debugger much less than\n&gt; before.  This would save lots of time. Is that true ?\n\n\nThis isn&#39;t true for me. I use the Junit tests within my IDE to exercise the\nclass I&#39;m writing. running them from ant outside of the IDE is the safety\nnet.\n\n\n\n* How can I convince managers and programmers that JUnit-based is\n&gt; really possible for commercial software development ? Any differnece\n&gt; from open-source projects ?\n\n\nLead by example. Start using it. Learn to use Junit to write code faster\nthan anyone else on the team -- and with fewer bugs.  Your boss will be\ncoming to you.\n\n- Dan\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n\n",
