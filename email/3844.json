Other<br/>\nresearch projects have prevented me from becoming more involved with Joshua<br/>\ndevelopment. Anyone interested in collaborating on the development of a new<br/>\nversion of Joshua over the summer?<br/>\n<br/>\nIn light of all this: it appears like Joshua is really not going to be <br/>\nbeneficial to the point in question.  Joshua is used if you want to distribute<br/>\nthe execution of test suites.  It is not particularly suited if you want to <br/>\nactually test a distributed application.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I am testing complicated distributed systems, I sometimes move away from <br/>\na test automation framework.  Instead, I configure my distributed services to <br/>\nprovide logging information (a la log4j or some other tool), and then conduct <br/>\ndifferent types of manual tests.  Or, I might use a test automation tool to <br/>\nexecute a series of test sequences and then investigate the logs manually.  I <br/>\nhave found that the usage of fault-injection on a distributed system often <br/>\nhelps me to understand system behavior in off-nominal situations.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you believe some of the contributors on the Jini-Users mailing list, they<br/>\nthink that they do not need to test their applications if they use Jini (grin).<br/>\nI would point you to the links, but the online archive appears to be down:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://archives.java.sun.com/cgi-bin/wa?A0=jini-users&D=1\">http://archives.java.sun.com/cgi-bin/wa?A0=jini-users&D=1</a><br/>\n<br/>\ngreg<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nGregory M.
