Indeed, it appears that\nthe ConsoleAppender in log4j saves a reference to System.out.  Since\nthe log4j configuration happens before the JUnit task redirects the\nSystem.out stream, the log messages are lost.\n\nOne potential work-arounds for this is writing a custom version of\nConsoleAppender that does not cache the value of System.out.  A second\nwork-around suggested was configuring the appender programatically\nafter start up.\n\nIn addition, I went to log a bug with log4j and discovered that the\nissue was already logged.  I added a note to that bug to detail the\neffect it had on the combination of JUnit, ANT and log4j.  This bug\nhad had no activity since being posted, so if this issue effects you\nas well, you may want to post a note to the bug or to the log4j-dev\nlist to let people know it is a priority.\n\nResources:\n\nThread on ant-user list:\nhttp://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=ant-user&m=111178627603846&w=2\n\nLog4j bug:\nhttp://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=31056\n\nThanks to everybody who had suggestions!\n\nRay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
