It is defined like<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; class xmlInfo{<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; //<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; //<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; }.<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; When I try running the test, it gives me error that I cannot<br/>\n&gt; access<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; the class. I think something is related to packge protection.. I<br/>\n&gt; was<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; wondering if this problem could be solved too..<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; Yes. Make the class public.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hey..<br/>\n&gt; Thanks a lot.. I appreciate the help. I am not the developer of the<br/>\n&gt; xmlInfo.. I am just the tester of the entire application and the<br/>\n&gt; developers have made that it in such a way that no one can access<br/>\n&gt; it. So, I think the only way that can be tested is if i put my<br/>\n&gt; testclass is the samepackage with xmlinfo.. Is that right?.. I<br/>\n&gt; cannot make the class xmlInfo public. It is out of my reach..<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The usual assumption is that you&#39;re testing code you can change, so the <br/>\nusual advice will be to change to code to make it easier to test.<br/>\n<br/>\nAsk the developers what their concern is about client code being able to <br/>\naccess their classes. Maybe they have nothing to worry about. Beyond <br/>\nthat, they ought to consider using Interface Segregation instead of the <br/>\ndreaded visibility keywords.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the class is package-visible, then placing the tests in the same <br/>\npackage -- even if in a different source tree -- will do. It&#39;s not my <br/>\nfavorite solution, but it will do.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
