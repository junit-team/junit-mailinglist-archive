I don&#39;t object to new \n&gt;package-private classes and methods as part of refactoring, or in \n&gt;initial design. But we do need to be really clear about distinguishing \n&gt;between public and package-private. I don&#39;t think you&#39;ve always been as \n&gt;clear as you think. For instance, here&#39;s a quote from the first message \n&gt;I found from you still in my Inbox:\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nIf I haven&#39;t been clear in individual messages, then I apologise. \nHowever, I&#39;ve stated a number of times in this thread that I start with \nextracted classes as package-private. I also start with non-extracted \nclasses as package-private.\n\nHowever, I don&#39;t see any reason not to make them public, and I do so the \ninstant I have a driver - classes outside of that package desiring the \nfunctionality. The need to have a clean API for client developers is \northogonal to what classes I make truly public, as it&#39;s solved in other \nmeans (packaging and documentation, mostly).\n\nIt is also clear that you don&#39;t agree. Very well. Shall we end this \ndiscussion?\n\nRobert.\n\n-- \n               &quot;Software is too expensive to build cheaply&quot;\nRobert Watkins         http://twasink.net/          robertdw@...\n\n\n",
