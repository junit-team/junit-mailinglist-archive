It has a rotten core.&quot; It kinda goes\n&gt; back to Bertrand Russell... If I know fruit is bad, then the\n&gt; fact that apple succeeds doesn&#39;t make it a healthy apple, it is\n&gt; unknown. \n&gt; \n&gt; Still, I don&#39;t think the idea has a chance of a fair hearing.\n\nPerhaps you would be more successfull in getting a &quot;fair hearing&quot; by\nproviding\n\n- more details on how the problem actually hurts you instead of just\nbeing an academic, presumed one\n- more evidence on actually having tried suggestions of experienced\nJunit users without success\n\nFrom the current discussion it is my perception that you seem to be more\ninterested in proposing your solution instead of solving your problem.\nPerhaps I just don&#39;t understand you. If so I would ask you to change the\nway you speak to me, as I currently don&#39;t know how to change the way I\nlisten.\n\n&gt;       That really is it.  No dependency concept exists, because it is\n&gt;       something to discourage.  Dependencies are a sign that the code\n&gt;       needs more decoupling and more refactoring.\n&gt; \n&gt; Point taken on discouragement, and boy -- yes -- I&#39;ve felt that. ;-)\n&gt; \n&gt; I think test content dependency is wrong, but not what I am\n&gt; saying. Either that, or you decouple yourself from everything\n&gt; you do, a purist goal of no real world value. Code used code, that is\n&gt; a dependency. \n\nMy experience is different. But this is already tackled by other posts.\n\n&gt;       In the example, in Kent&#39;s book he relays the experience of\n&gt;       having a test suite that would run overnight, and sometimes\n&gt;       nothing would break and other times he&#39;d get a printout of many\n&gt;       pages with all of his bugs. It turned out that the large\n&gt;       printout usually meant one test failed and caused cascading\n&gt; failures through the rest of the tests due to       dependencies. \n&gt; \n&gt; This is all about test content dependency -- side effects --\n&gt; and I never meant that.\n\nIs it? How is it different from what you experience/imagine?\n\n&gt; Why get a fruit basket full of errors\n&gt; when fruit is bad? I was actually trying to reduce this mess\n&gt; of an output to &quot;the *possible* root cause -- and if nothing\n&gt; else, a place to start cleaning up&quot;.\n\nYes. You can do this by not letting the basket depend on the\nimplementation of fruit. It&#39;s possible, even valuable to strive for this\ndecoupling.\n\nRegards, Ilja\n\n\n",
