But for instance the jump to method doesn&#39;t work for FlatSpec stuff,<br/>\nand will never work because it&#39;s trying to find a method called xxx where<br/>\nxxx is the first word in the description of the test. Which obviously will<br/>\nnever work. For Scala-IDE we can work around this using aspects, but it<br/>\nwould be nice it this worked nicely.

The next release of<br/>\n&gt; ScalaTest, version 2.0, will include enhancements to support IDE<br/>\n&gt; integration, and before releasing 2.0 we&#39;re going to help do the actual<br/>\n&gt; integration work for Eclipse, IDEA, and NetBeans. That way we can be sure<br/>\n&gt; we have it right before releasing the ScalaTest enhancements. I would like<br/>\n&gt; your feedback on it. I&#39;ll post announcements of preview snapshots on the<br/>\n&gt; scalatest-users mailing list, so please join that if you&#39;d like to give<br/>\n&gt; input.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Bill<br/>\n&gt; ----<br/>\n&gt; Bill Venners<br/>\n&gt; Artima, Inc.<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.artima.com\">http://www.artima.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On Nov 3, 2011, at 5:50 AM, Matthew Farwell &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:matthew@...\">matthew@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hi,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m interested in this, though for slightly different reasons, maybe we<br/>\n&gt; &gt; could exchange ideas on this. I haven&#39;t exactly thought this through in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; detail, but I think my requirements come down to being able to store<br/>\n&gt; &gt; arbitrary information in a Description, a key.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m interesting in testing with Scala, and there are (at least) two<br/>\n&gt; generic<br/>\n&gt; &gt; problems:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 1) Tests which are not linked to a specific method, but are run as<br/>\n&gt; separate<br/>\n&gt; &gt; tests. Scalatest for example allows the following<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; @RunWith(classOf[JUnitRunner])<br/>\n&gt; &gt; class FileSpec extends FlatSpec with ShouldMatchers {<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;A Stack&quot; should &quot;pop values in last-in-first-out order&quot; in {<br/>\n&gt; &gt; }<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it should &quot;throw NoSuchElementException if an empty stack is popped&quot; in {<br/>\n&gt; &gt; }<br/>\n&gt; &gt; }<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; This creates a single method with the two tests within. However, the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; JUnitRunner runs the single method but records the two tests separately.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; This can be seen in Eclipse, see attached scalatest1.png. Now if I double<br/>\n&gt; &gt; click on the test name in the junit view, it tries to find a method of<br/>\n&gt; that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; name, and fails. Obviously, to correct this would require a fix to<br/>\n&gt; Eclipse,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; but if I could store the file & line number instead of the method name, I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; could jump to the appropriate line.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 2) Scala allows spaces and other characters in method names, but these<br/>\n&gt; &gt; names are munged on compilation. For instance, space gets translated to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; $0020.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; class FileTest extends AssertionsForJUnit {<br/>\n&gt; &gt; @Test def `foo bar`() = {<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; }<br/>\n&gt; &gt; }<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Here the jump to in Eclipse works correctly, but the displayed<br/>\n&gt; description<br/>\n&gt; &gt; in Eclipse isn&#39;t nice, see scalatest2.png.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; So in both cases, the string I would like to display (in Eclipse,<br/>\n&gt; surefire<br/>\n&gt; &gt; whatever) doesn&#39;t match the method name, either because there is no<br/>\n&gt; method<br/>\n&gt; &gt; name or because It&#39;s not the same thing. I think that I could work around<br/>\n&gt; &gt; most issues is Eclipse etc if the test runner could add some arbitrary<br/>\n&gt; &gt; information to the description, which it could subsequently use. A string<br/>\n&gt; &gt; would be fine, because I could define the contents of that String, but<br/>\n&gt; &gt; arbitrary data would be even better. String would be simpler for<br/>\n&gt; everyone I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; think.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Please note that I&#39;m just thinking aloud at the minute, and I haven&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; actually done any proof of concepts as yet, but if you have any ideas,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; please feel free to take this to email.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Matthew Farwell.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
