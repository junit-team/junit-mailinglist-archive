JUnit is a framework in which humans \n&gt;&gt;write tests; it is not a tool that writes tests.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Well said.  I&#39;ll go farther and say that even a tool that generates a\n&gt; set of JUnit (or xUnit) stubs to test all (or some selected subset) \n&gt; the methods of a given class is incompatible with the philosophy. \n&gt; JUnit is used to test behaviour.  Behaviours and methods and not 1-1\n&gt; or onto.  A single behavior may encompass functionallity from several\n&gt; methods, and a single method may embody several behaviours.  Hmm..\n&gt; there&#39;s an article in there.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\nThat being said, when I&#39;m trying to add new functionality to legacy code \nthat doesn&#39;t have tests, I&#39;ll gain confidence in any way possible.  If I \ncan easily run a tool that generates some amount of tests, then I&#39;ll use \nthose tests as another anchor point.  That is, I&#39;ll sic the tool on the \nexisting code base, then continually run the tests it generates as I&#39;m \nretrofitting the code.  Better than nothin&#39;.\n\nWhen I&#39;m writing new code for a system built test first, I want to write \nall the tests by hand.  In this case, tools actually impede the way I \nlearn through testing.\n\nMike\n\n-- \nMike Clark\nhttp://clarkware.com\n(303) 589-3812\n\n\n",
