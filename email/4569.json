    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2078611598\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt; I&#39;m not sure how you can separate the two discussions. Could<br/>\n&gt; you tell me how Unit Testing can be discussed without discussing <br/>\n&gt; its impact on design?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I am sorry that I made myself misunderstood in this way.  What I<br/>\nintended to say was: lets make the discussion clear for those who don&#39;t<br/>\nwant to participate in/read the &#39;testing private methods&#39; thread, and<br/>\nmove to a &#39;Testing & Design&#39; thread that brings the issue into better<br/>\nfocus.  I see that my mistake was to omit &#39;private method&#39; when I<br/>\nmentioned separating Design and (private method) Unit testing.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat we could be saying then is:<br/>\n- to those who want to test private methods, use another tool<br/>\n- to those who want to learn about how testing can improve design, keep<br/>\non reading (this thread)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe statements above are not mutually exclusive, and, therefore, can be<br/>\ndone in conjunction.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, we could try to discover how many of this mailing list&#39;s readers<br/>\nwould actually like to be able to test private methods (democracy?).  If<br/>\nwe find this to be a respectable percentage, we could then proceed to<br/>\nfind out whether they know of the benefits testing only public methods<br/>\nhas on design.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; [...] JUnit was not built for that purpose. Not only that, its<br/>\n&gt; creators feel <br/>\n&gt; (well Kent, anyway; I don&#39;t know how Erich feels) that one of <br/>\n&gt; the strengths <br/>\n&gt; of JUnit is that when the tests become painful to write, <br/>\n&gt; there is a tendency <br/>\n&gt; for the design to have an organic weakness that prevents the <br/>\n&gt; testing. As <br/>\n&gt; Kent says in this case, it&#39;s an opportunity to learn about <br/>\n&gt; your design.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I also know about Kent&#39;s position, and how much testing plays a part in<br/>\nhow HE sees development practices should be undertaken (XP, TDD).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; If you are going to say, &quot;Take your testing/design<br/>\n&gt; discussions elsewhere,&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I am *really* sorry if my post could be misconstrued in that manner!<br/>\nOnce again, I believe I mentioned the fact that many an insight has been<br/>\ngained from these discussions.  Keep it up!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It&#39;s all in how you define &quot;unit&quot;. To me, it&#39;s the exported<br/>\n&gt; methods of a <br/>\n&gt; class or interface. Kent and Erich may define it differently. <br/>\n&gt; Clearly, you <br/>\n&gt; define it differently. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I was only voicing my opinion for the testing of private methods being<br/>\nas it is a popular request.  I myself believe in the benefits of testing<br/>\npublic methods only, and therefore have no need for that functionality.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would add that, since testing of private methods is such a popular<br/>\nrequest, JUnit&#39;s position on the matter should be clearly stated in the<br/>\ndocumentation (README, index.html, FAQ, ...), and why (pointer to<br/>\nTesting & Design discussions).  [A quick search on Google revealed that<br/>\nthe only place private methods are mentioned on the junit.org site is<br/>\nwhere JUnitX is mentioned.]<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; You folks can test private methods until your brain pops out,<br/>\n&gt; but just don&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; expect JUnit to do it out of the box. It was never designed <br/>\n&gt; for that. It was <br/>\n&gt; never designed for that *on purpose*. I don&#39;t know why that <br/>\n&gt; is such a big <br/>\n&gt; deal.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And it isn&#39;t!  I am just questioning whether *on purpose* is actually<br/>\nthe reason, or whether it was never envisaged to be used that way.  Once<br/>\nagain, I am just trying to asses how many people would like this<br/>\nfunctionality, and how many would reconsider after reading about how<br/>\nTesting can affect Design.<br/>\n<br/>\nManuel Amago.<br/>\nmailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mamago@...\">mamago@...</a></div>",
