However, the partners\ndo need to be willing; a negative relationship won&#39;t make it easy. In my\nexperience, if they get forced to do it for a few weeks, they&#39;ll gel\neventually and never want to go back. Also, you should remember that pairs\nshould swap regularly; at the very least you would want a different partner\nfor the afternoon session. This also helps to keep doing the negative\nrelationships.\n\nThe junior-senior problem is another issue. Ideally, pair programming is\ndone by peers. However, junior developers can still contribute. What I would\nwatch out for is too much silence. If you&#39;re in a coaching role, you can hop\nin, get some conversation going, and try to get a flow-of-ideas. Failing\nthat, I would try and get the junior partner to drive for a while; this will\nforce the senior programmer to explain his/her ideas, which in turn usually\ngets some feedback (&quot;Why are we doing this?&quot;, etc). Remember again that the\npairs will swap; if they are working on a task for the junior developer,\nwhen they swap out that afternoon (or the next morning), the junior\ndeveloper will need to be able to fill his or her new partner in on the\ntask, so they need to understand it. Make sure the junior developers sign up\nfor tasks, and make sure they swap pairs a lot, and you&#39;ll avoid this\nproblem.\n\nI would suggest checking out some of the Pair Programming links on Ward&#39;s\nWiki (try http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?PairProgramming, for starters)\n\nRobert.\n\n-- \n     &quot;Duct tape is like the Force: it has a light side, a dark side,\n                   and it holds the universe together&quot;\n  Robert Watkins     robertdw@...     robertw@...\n\r\n------_=_NextPart_001_01C0AD11.5597B9B0\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;\n&lt;HEAD&gt;\n&lt;META HTTP-=\r\nEQUIV=3D&quot;Content-Type&quot; CONTENT=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Diso-8859-1&quot;&gt;\n&lt;META N=\r\nAME=3D&quot;Generator&quot; CONTENT=3D&quot;MS Exchange Server version 5.5.2653.12&quot;&gt;\n&lt;TITL=\r\nE&gt;RE: [junit] is pair programming pratical?&lt;/TITLE&gt;\n&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY&gt;\n\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;FON=\r\nT SIZE=3D2&gt;Junit Jason wrote:&lt;/FONT&gt;\n&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=3D2&gt;&gt; Hi guys,&lt;/FONT=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=3D2&gt;&gt; I&#39;m new to XP.
