I think the benefits of a similar approach\nare going to be most obvious when working within a\nteam. Remember, we&#39;re looking to reduce code-ownership\nso we have to write clear, standard code. If\ndevelopers were all off writing their own types of\ntests that got executed in different ways then when i\nwas assigned the task of working on your work units\nnot only would i have to figure out &quot;what&quot; i would\nalso have to spend time on &quot;how&quot;. \n\nSo, even if you dont use JUnit if you&#39;re working in a\ngroup you will need to enforce/recommend some sort of\nstandards around unit testing your code and you&#39;ll\nfind when you do this that there is much similiarity\namong your tests so you may as well abstract that to a\nbase class so that you&#39;re not duplicating\neffort...hey, we&#39;re building a framework...why build\nit? You need it. It exists (JUnit) and the price is\nright (free).\n\nI guess i am saying you dont NEED to use JUnit. You&#39;re\nabsolutely right...you can write your own tests in a\nplain class...but there are many advantages to a\nstructured approach to unit testing and the guys that\ndeveloped JUnit were pretty smart and have thought of\nmost of the components of unit testing for us. So why\nnot take advantage?\n\nPatrick\n\n\n--- venkatesh srinivasan &lt;venky_gct@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hi Folks\n&gt; I am having a basic question..!\n&gt; Why should i go for JUnit testing Framework which i\n&gt; can accompolish in plain java class.?\n&gt; See what ever i am writing inside a test case\n&gt; funtion\n&gt; , i can write it in a plain java class which doesn&#39;t\n&gt; extend TestCase class?\n&gt; \n&gt; For example if i want to write a testcase for an EJB\n&gt; i\n&gt; have to write a lookup initialisation function in \n&gt; setUp() method....and write a test case function for\n&gt; each test behaviour...right?\n&gt; This i can accomoplish using plain java class which\n&gt; can execute different user defined function!!!!\n&gt; \n&gt; Now if anyone you can tell a solid reason/scenario\n&gt; for\n&gt; which i have to use JUnit test framework, i will be\n&gt; very much thankful...and most of the beginners can\n&gt; have a clear understanding...........\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanx and Regards, \n&gt; Venky\n&gt; \n&gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; Make a great connection at Yahoo!
