I&#39;m using \nJProbe Coverage from Sitraka software to get the code coverage \ninformation.\nJPCoverage calls ant which in turn runs my unit tests. I&#39;ve been \ncareful to set &quot;fork=&quot;no&quot; in my junit ant task so that my tests run \nin the same jvm as ant.\nDespite this, and despite the fact that it&#39;s clear my tests are \nexecuting, jpcoverage is still reporting 0% coverage of my code.\nDoes anybody have any experience with this? I&#39;m wondering what I \ncould be doing wrong.\nI realize that there&#39;s also a jpcoverage ant task which would then \nrun JProbe inside my ant project (rather than vice versa); would this \nbe a superior approach? I suspect I would have the same problem.\n\nThanks,\nMT\n\n\n\n",
