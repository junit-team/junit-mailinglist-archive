I think that the HTML (probably added by Yahoo<br/>\ngroups so it could add a graphic advertisement) was just too much for me to<br/>\novercome. I struggled to get control of the &quot;text&quot; I hoped I was<br/>\nediting/formatting but just fought the tool more than I won. I&#39;d try to<br/>\nindent and paragraphs would just bounce all over the place out of my<br/>\ncontrol. So much for &quot;progress&quot;. I&#39;ve zapped this one to be plain text and I<br/>\nwill manually insert the &gt;&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;      This seems to me to be the crucial point. IF you don&#39;t have side<br/>\n </span></blockquote>effects and<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;      IF you have decoupled code then I cannot see where dependencies<br/>\n </span></blockquote>between T(A)<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;      and T(B) make sense. A usually does not depend directly on B but on<br/>\n </span></blockquote>an<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;      abstract interface - B just being an implementation of that<br/>\n </span></blockquote>interface.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been sending mail and for some reason they takes hours (maybe up to a<br/>\nday) to arrive, and I don&#39;t think it is my server (I have our admin check.)<br/>\nSorry, there is an explanation in the mail. ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nYou guys all seem very caught up on decoupling, and I&#39;ll acknowledge I am<br/>\nfar from an OO purist, I have a job to do & I write code. I attempt to write<br/>\nstandalone (decoupled) classes, I attempt to make them have well structed<br/>\n&quot;APIs&quot; but at the end of the day, if A uses B (however implemented, and<br/>\nhowever used -- aggregation, subclassing, command/messaging paradigms,<br/>\nwhatever) *for whatever reason* then surely for A to work, B ought work? If<br/>\nB fail a test then it has broken the contracts the tests assert, so it&#39;s<br/>\nbehaviours must be deemed unknown. I B is unknown, I could argue (a user<br/>\nchoice, on a per case basis) that it isn&#39;t worth knowing what the outcome of<br/>\nA&#39;s results test are. If they pass, then perhaps those tests don&#39;t cover<br/>\nenough. If they fail, isn&#39;t quite likely because B failed and what A relied<br/>\nupon is bogus?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;\tMaybe the direct dependency on the collection object is the problem in the<br/>\n&gt;\tfirst place. You could take your problem with many test cases failing at<br/>\n </span></blockquote>once<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;\tas a strong hint to remove this direct dependency. If your collection<br/>\n </span></blockquote>object,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;\thowever, is so low level that a direct dependency does not hurt then it<br/>\n&gt;\tshould be very very stable; the probability that it fails in a fundamental<br/>\n </span></blockquote>way,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;\twhich makes lots of other tests fail too, is very low.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There might be gold in that statement. You are saying that failures can<br/>\npropagate (as I say) but that as you go up the stack the chance for<br/>\ncatastrophic failure ought not be there. I wonder if the result I am looking<br/>\nfor is better suited in the case of catastrophic failure, not just &quot;some<br/>\nobscure failure&quot;. That is possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith this observation, maybe what I am asking for is too fuzzy. I think that<br/>\ncode uses code (however you structure it) and much as there ought not be<br/>\ndependency on internal, if code breaks is &quot;API agreement&quot; then anything that<br/>\nuses that API is in doubt, and not worth testing. Trouble is, I&#39;d not want<br/>\nto do this on a &quot;method by method&quot; or &quot;test by test&quot; basics, so I was<br/>\nproposing doing it on TestCases. At this level, I can see how it is not fine<br/>\ngrained enough, and perhaps too fuzzy.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW: I use junit to assert behaviours/contracts for the very reason that I<br/>\ncan change anything (at any level) any time. I like a good refactor that<br/>\n(after a while) brings all the tests back to working. I worry t hat the<br/>\nassumption of &quot;low level stability&quot; is counter that. It is likely right, but<br/>\nit oughtn&#39;t be relied upon (IMHO).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;\tYou haven&#39;t convinced me (yet) about two points:<br/>\n&gt;\t- Why is the dependency between tests a FUNDAMENTAL concept and not just<br/>\n&gt;\tyour very personal way to sort out which test cases to run?<br/>\n&gt;\t- Why can&#39;t this concept be implemented without changing the core of<br/>\n </span></blockquote>JUnit?<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think we ever gave these fair hearing because (I feel) we spent all<br/>\nthe time on why the idea was bad. To be frank, I didn&#39;t think anybody was<br/>\nlistening, and since I was struggling to make the base points I saw no<br/>\nreason to try to build on the implementation issue.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the points (one by one) that need to get agreed or dismissed are:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Are test suites (as collections of tests, which have some<br/>\nhierarchical/run order effect) are a &quot;second place&quot; to manage relationship<br/>\nbetween testcases? Since managing in two places is always flawed, are suites<br/>\nflawed? [If I refactor testcases I might forget to refactor the suites, and<br/>\nthat is where errors creep in.]<br/>\n2) Are test suites becoming obsoleted by &quot;brute force collectors&quot;? How would<br/>\nwe know other than a user survey?<br/>\n3) If &quot;suites&quot; have outlived their purpose, why are they the &quot;framework&quot; way<br/>\nto manage run order?<br/>\n4) Does &quot;run order/dependency&quot; (not side-effect dependency) have any<br/>\nvalue -- despite it&#39;s smell?<br/>\n5) Is &quot;run order&quot; something that ought be in the framework, however it is<br/>\nimplemented.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs agree w/ David, in a mail I sent yesterday but haven&#39;t seen list exploded<br/>\nyet, I *may* be right about some of this, but I don&#39;t think dependency will<br/>\nget an open hearing &#39;cos of the stench of side-effect dependency. So be it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;\tBut of course you&#39;re right stati8ng that many of us here are too involved<br/>\n </span></blockquote>in<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;\tJUnit and thus have a hard time giving up on &quot;invariants&quot; we consider to<br/>\n </span></blockquote>be<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;\t&quot;everlasting&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Thanks for that, at least.<br/>\n<br/>\nregards<br/>\n<br/>\nAdam</div>",
