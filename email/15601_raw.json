We have ~6500 tests (questionable level of &quot;unit&quot; versus &quot;higher-than-unit&quot;) that take ~3.5 hours to run (additional time for building, reporting, etc. brings the nightly build up to 4+ hours).\n\n-------------- Original message -------------- \n\nOn Nov 29, 2005, at 7:47 AM, J.

We use Mock objects, so that  \n&gt;&gt; helps,...but we\n&gt;&gt; don&#39;t use them everywhere.  We also utilize &quot;TestAll&quot; tests, so that\n&gt;&gt; helps get you to a scope somewhere between one and all.\n&gt;\n&gt; It takes 4 hours to run all your /programmer/ tests?! I daresay  \n&gt; that is\n&gt; a large problem and needs attention! I could understand all your\n&gt; /customer/ tests taking that long to run, but not your programmer  \n&gt; tests.\n&gt;\n\nIll concur with this.  On my last (Java) project we had 2,100+ unit  \ntests and they never more than a minute or two...\n\n[rest snipped]\n\n--\nDaryl\nself email: ( daryl at: eddl dot: us )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYAHOO!
