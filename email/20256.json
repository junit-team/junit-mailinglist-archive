The container really does<br/>\n*inject* dependencies, bypassing encapsulation, the constructor and<br/>\nall the other language features that exist to help you manage<br/>\ndependencies.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe result of this is that to unit test an session or message-driven<br/>\nbean you have to duplicate the container&#39;s reflectopornographic<br/>\ninjection mechanism.  This is quite a bit of work.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother downside is that you don&#39;t get any indication that you&#39;ve not<br/>\nprovided all the dependencies to an object in a unit-test.  This makes<br/>\ntests brittle.  Simple changes to an object cause a cascade of broken<br/>\ntests. You can&#39;t add dependencies by using the IDEs refactoring<br/>\nfeatures to introduce new constructor parameters.  Instead you have to<br/>\nannotate a field or setter method, and then manually go through<br/>\neverywhere the object is used to check whether all the dependencies<br/>\nhave been set up correctly.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I still find it useful to completely decouple the business logic<br/>\nfrom the J2EE layer.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Nat</div>",
