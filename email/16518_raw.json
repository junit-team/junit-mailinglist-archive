The DatabaseTestCase comes from the DBUnit.jar. I was looking for other approaches. The source is located at agfg.dx.eric.rf.\n  I am working with WSAD 5.1.2. I am trying to reference the mehtods in the source.\n\nkultstatus77 &lt;onlineguy@...&gt; wrote:\n  I&#39;m a little confused about the import of DatabaseTestCase and your\nDBTest class...which one has the application source and which one is\nthe test case? Or is your source in agfg.dx.eric.rf.* (this is what I\nassume)?\n\nBtw, which IDE do you use (if any)? Eclipse for example supports\ndifferent source code folders for the same package.\n\nRegards,\n\nMaik\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;c61keuper&quot; &lt;c61keuper@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I am working with WSAD. I can create testcases within my source path \n&gt; and there is no problem. I was looking not to clutter up the source \n&gt; package so I created another package for the test cases.
