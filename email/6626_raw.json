So for the example you mentioned, you would extend TestCase\nwith your own class, and it would have four test methods in it, each of\nwhich would assert that the expected response is received.  The\ndownside here is that you will most likely end of with very many test\nclasses, and not many actual tests per TestCase.\n\nIf you want to have all of your tests within one class that extends\nTestCase, you have to make a choice.  If one file has four messages,\nyou can consider the verification of each of the four responses a\nseperate test method.  Or you could just make one test method per file\nthat you read in, regardless of how many messages are in it.  If you\nchoose this approach, you&#39;ll just have several assertions in your test\nmethod.\n\n-Brian\n\n--- &quot;bengarbers &lt;garbers@...&gt;&quot; &lt;garbers@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Junit Group,\n&gt; \n&gt;    This is more of a design question.  I was inherited to take over \n&gt; testing a client / server application.  The test cases were all \n&gt; written in xml (a bunch of xml defined messages that the client would\n&gt; \n&gt; send to the server) where a java application would read in each test \n&gt; case from the xml file.  It would then send the xml message to the \n&gt; server and the server would then process that xml messages and send \n&gt; them back another xml message.\n&gt; \n&gt;   I would like to integrate this into Junit&#39;s framework but the \n&gt; problem I am having is that each test case has 4 xml messages that it\n&gt; \n&gt; sends to the server.  I would like to use JUnits TestCase method and \n&gt; read each xml file one by one.  The problem with this is that it \n&gt; would be one method that would be reading each xml message in from \n&gt; the file and then verifying it.  \n&gt;    \n&gt;    After looking at JUnit&#39;s framework they treat each method as a \n&gt; test case within a class that extends TestCase.  My question is how \n&gt; would you design this so that I could treat each file as testcase 1 \n&gt; and each message that gets read in as testcase a, b, c, etc....  I \n&gt; would like to be able to use Junit&#39;s swing TestRunner to run all \n&gt; these xml file test cases then.  Any help would be greatly \n&gt; appreciated.\n&gt; \n&gt; ben\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo! Mail Plus - Powerful. Affordable.
