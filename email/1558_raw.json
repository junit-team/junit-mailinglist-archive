If I had to \n    &gt; unit test\n    &gt; something like the controler, I would rather write own \n    &gt; mock implementations\n    &gt; of greeter and sender to test the controler: By doing so \n    &gt; I will have no\n    &gt; testing code in my production code. Does that seem too \n    &gt; much of an overhead,\n    &gt; or for what other reason is Eric Allen&#39;s approach more promising?\n\nAs I said it all depends on your need.  Eric has offered a potential\nframework in a vacuum devoid of context called an article.  That is what\nwriters do.  The quote at the top is probably what makes this smell bad to\nyou.\n\n&quot;Unit testing with JUnit can be a powerful way to ensure the integrity of\nyour code base, but some of the invariants are trickier to test than others\n-- method-invocation sequence is one of them.&quot;\n\nTake it with a grain of salt.  If you find it is needed to test this way, go\nahead. But as you said, mock objects would *probably* be a better solution.\n\n-Jason\n\n\n",
