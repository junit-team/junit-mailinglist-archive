Our goal is to<br/>\neliminate such tests, but exposure of those tests is required to<br/>\nachieve this goal.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe following (especially the cons since I&#39;m biased and there&#39;s lots<br/>\nabout JUnit I don&#39;t yet understand) will likely be missing items but<br/>\nI&#39;ll try to be fair about them. If there&#39;s anything missing, I&#39;m sure<br/>\npeople will jump in.<br/>\n<br/>\nPro&#39;s:<br/>\n* Simpler code. @Ignore processing would simply be just another<br/>\nfilter. Existing duplicate code to check for @Ignore annotations will<br/>\ndisappear.<br/>\n* Conceptually simpler. @Ignore and Filters aren&#39;t two separate things<br/>\nwith different hard-coded nuances.<br/>\n<br/>\nCon&#39;s:<br/>\n* Slower performance. Since notifications will have to be made, the<br/>\nset of tests to be run can&#39;t be culled down. Such slower performance<br/>\nis theoretical and ought to be measured.<br/>\n<br/>\nPotential alternatives:<br/>\n* Have an option (somewhere) that allows notification for filtered tests.<br/>\n* Have a fireFiltered() method for notifiers. I think this would still<br/>\nrequire changes to AllDefaultPossibilitiesBuilder.runnerForClass()<br/>\nsuch that it returns something similar to IgnoredClassRunner for tests<br/>\nthat are filtered out.<br/>\n<br/>\nNoel</div>",
