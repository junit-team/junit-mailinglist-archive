    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1176141789\">We&#39;re using JUnit to test a evolutionary computation system where many<br/>\n(most?) of the methods are directly or indirectly stochastic (use<br/>\nrandom number generation).<br/>\n<br/>\nWriting unit tests for the deterministic parts of the system is pretty<br/>\nstandard fare, but it&#39;s not obvious how to reasonably test the<br/>\nstochastic parts of the system.  At some level stochastic methods just<br/>\naren&#39;t testable in the same way that deterministic methods are.  If<br/>\nyou&#39;re writing a sorting routine, it should sort.  Period.  End of<br/>\ndiscussion.  If, however, you&#39;re simulating the roll of a six-sided<br/>\ndie, then the best you can hope for is statistically plausible<br/>\nresults, and it&#39;s then essentially impossible to tell the difference<br/>\nbetween a bug and a weird streak of luck in the random number<br/>\ngenerator.  (If your die simulation turns up &#39;3&#39; one hundred times in<br/>\na row it&#39;s _probably_ a bug, but it might just be a _highly_ unlikely<br/>\nevent resulting from your pseudo-random number generator.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the moment we&#39;ve got some hacks where we call methods repeatedly<br/>\n(i.e., it&#39;s _slow_), and assert that the standard deviation of the<br/>\nresults is below some arbitrary bound.  The bound was chosen by trial<br/>\nand error, running the tests over and over and putting the bound at a<br/>\npoint where the tests fail about one time in 10.  This is obviously<br/>\ncheesy in the extreme.<br/>\n<br/>\nPresumably we&#39;re not the first people to have wandered into this tar<br/>\npit, and I was wondering if anyone out there had solutions, pointers,<br/>\nideas, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany thanks,<br/>\n<br/>\n\tNic McPhee<br/>\n\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mcphee@...\">mcphee@...</a><br/>\n\tDivision of Science and Mathematics<br/>\n\tUniversity of Minnesota, Morris</div>",
