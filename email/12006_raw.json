At this moment i have a few things in\n&gt; mind such as\n&gt; 1. How to write logs in the test cases, if there is some sample code,\n&gt; please forward it.\n\nJUnit test cases are just Java classes, so there should be no problem. \nSimply configure logging as normal.\n\n&gt; 2.How to log the result of the assertions we perform in the test methods\n\nYou have to do this yourself. JUnit does not log anything, so you&#39;d need \nto reimplement a few methods on Assert in order to add logging to the \nassertions.\n\n&gt; 3.How to write the logs to a text file or to a database report.any\n&gt; sample code if possible.\n\nThis is a Log4J question, rather than a JUnit question. Someone here \nmight be able to answer, but you&#39;d have more luck on a Log4J mailing list.\n\n_JUnit Recipes_, chapter 7, deals extensively with reporting results. \nScott Stirling did an excellent job with the chapter, so you can also \nlook there.\n\nTake care.\n-- \nJ.
