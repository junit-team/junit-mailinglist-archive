There&#39;s no doubt <br/>\nEnhanced JUnit adds its own bells and whistles over and above the open <br/>\nsource goodies it includes.  Indeed, distributing tests across separate <br/>\nVMs is unique.  But Dave&#39;s use of the word &quot;community&quot; above struck a <br/>\nchord with me.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAs a member of this community, and the open source community in general, <br/>\nit got me to thinking about the licenses I use for the stuff I build. <br/>\n Anything I craft in the future may just be licensed such that <br/>\ncommercial redistribution rights are only available by writing me. <br/>\n Non-commercial redistribution, and its use in the development of <br/>\nnon-commercial products, will be freely granted.  In other words, if I <br/>\ncontribute to this community in good faith, commercial vendors have to <br/>\nask before leveraging my wares.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I expected that type of communication would happen naturally <br/>\ninside of a community.  It won&#39;t be the first time I&#39;ve been naive, nor <br/>\nthe last.
