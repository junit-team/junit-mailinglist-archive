I agree.\n\n&gt;Can you clarify what you meant by your last statement? Why would I put\n&gt;try/catch around an assertion?\n\nI asked that because I was under the impression that you were able to have\nbroken test produce errors and broken &quot;under test&quot; code produce failures.\n\nYou said :\n&gt; [...] I find it nice to go on the assumption that a failure means my code\nis broken and an error means my test is broken [...]\n\nSo I assumed wrongly that you had found a way to somehow insure that. I\nwasn&#39;t able to imagine a way I would do that so I asked.\nFrom your explanations below I see this is only &quot;best effort&quot; to *try* to\nmake broken code not to produce errors.\n\nYou asked :\n&gt;[...] I wonder if not many people find this useful or if I&#39;m overstating\nhow useful it can be.[...]\nPersonnally, I think it&#39;s not worth it.\n\nWithout any effort, I *do* get major problems come up as errors. I also get\nfrom time to time failures comming as errors and vice versa, but I&#39;m sure\nyou also do.\n\nExample:\n\nint methodToTest() {\n   //  broken code uses member wrongly set to null. Throws NPE.\n}\n\nAssume a correct test. If you don&#39;t write ugly try/catch arround your\nassertions like :\n\ntry {\n    assertEquals(4,objectUnderTest.methodToTest())\n} catch (Exception e) {\n    fail(e.toString); // -- note the lack of stacktrace in the UI. It&#39;s\nlost. We probably need fail(String s,Throwable t).\n}\n\nyou will get an error, instead of a failure.\n\nI&#39;m personnally satisfied with always letting the framework catch\nexceptions. (Except expected ones, of course)\n\n&gt; [...]Specifically, I generally put stronger &quot;not null&quot; preconditions on\nthe test to quickly rule out that the test is broken. [...]\nThis is what I view as &quot;best effort&quot; since you don&#39;t cover everything but\nyou try. Regardless of the issue error vs failure, I think this is probably\ngood.\n\n&gt;[...] Also, it depends when I get the NullPointerException: what did I just\nwrite? the test or code? Usually that tells me. [...]\nThat&#39;s why I don&#39;t do any effort for the error vs failure thing. &quot;Usually\nthat tells me&quot; applies also to me.\n\nI won&#39;t retype here what  David Avraamides said, because he already said\nnicely what I also think.\n\n\nmathieu\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: J.

(Re: re - assert counting)\n\n\n&gt; &gt;Agreed; however, I find it nice to go on the assumption that a failure\n&gt; means\n&gt; &gt;my code is broken and an error means my test is broken. I wonder if not\n&gt; many\n&gt; &gt;people find this useful or if I&#39;m overstating how useful it can be.\n&gt;\n&gt; Interesting comment. What if the tested code throw a NullPointerException?\n&gt; You catch it and fail()? So All your tests contain try ..catch\nstuf...around\n&gt; tested method but not around asserts?\n\nI&#39;m not sure I understand your last comment, so let me try to address your\nquestion.\n\n&quot;What if the tested code throws a NullPointerException?&quot; There are two\npossibilities: I expect the exception or I do not. If I expect the\nexception, then I have a test that runs like this:\n\npublic void testA() {\n    try {\n        doSomething();\n        fail(&quot;How did I get here?!&quot;);\n    }\n    catch (NullPointerException success) {}\n}\n\nWe&#39;ve already talked for a long time about this coding pattern on this\nmailing list, so I state it &quot;without proof&quot; as a best practice.\n\nIf I do not expect the exception, then either my test or my code is broken.\nSince I don&#39;t want to debug, what I generally do is add a bunch of\nassertNotNull() statements into my tests to determine which reference is\nnull. Once I determine which reference is null, it is generally easy to\ndetermine whether the test or the code is broken. Specifically, I generally\nput stronger &quot;not null&quot; preconditions on the test to quickly rule out that\nthe test is broken. Also, it depends when I get the NullPointerException:\nwhat did I just write? the test or code? Usually that tells me.\n\nCan you clarify what you meant by your last statement? Why would I put\ntry/catch around an assertion?\n\nThanks.\n\nJBR.\n\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\njunit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n\n\nYour use of Yahoo!
