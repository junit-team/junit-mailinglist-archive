I would expect it to be something more\n&gt; &gt; than a way of a=\r\nvoiding that kind of boilerplate.\n&gt; \n&gt; I just explained that in my previous=\r\n reply. When the boilerplate that is\n&gt; avoided is so excessive, the syntact=\r\nic sugar itself becomes a valuable\n&gt; feature.\n\nI really don&#39;t perceive that=\r\n as excessive boilerplate. YMMV.\n \n&gt; &gt; As an example of the kind of thing I=\r\n think a class rule would enable,\n&gt; &gt; is that it might allow the rule to dy=\r\nnamically pass values to the\n&gt; &gt; test class&#39;s constructor based on some dyn=\r\namic criteria (say a souped\n&gt; &gt; up version of Parameterized)\n&gt; \n&gt; No. Test =\r\nclass instantiation occurs per-method, not per-class, thus\n&gt; class-level is=\r\n not where it can be changed.\n\nTest instantiation is yes, but I would expec=\r\nt a ClassRule to provide a hook into the instance generation process (altho=\r\nugh for the whole class, not each case at a time).\n\n&gt; &gt; or perhaps change t=\r\nhe runner that will run the tests,\n&gt; \n&gt; No. The Runner is what invokes the =\r\nrules, so rules can&#39;t change the runner.\n\nJust like the ExpectedException r=\r\nule intercepts the Statement and replaces it with its own, a ClassRule can =\r\nintercept the Runner and replace it with its own (possibly).\n\n&gt; &gt; Something=\r\n that is not possible with an @BeforeClass\n&gt; &gt; or @AfterClass annotation.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; The ability to package a common class-level setup/teardown behaviour an=\r\nd\n&gt; re-use it in many places is what rules provide over embedded\n&gt; before/a=\r\nfter methods. That&#39;s very useful by itself, and they don&#39;t have\n&gt; to do any=\r\nthing more to justify their existence.\n\nHmm, I guess we have to agree to di=\r\nsagree on that one.\n\n\n",
