In an ideal world, all libraries would \ndistributed test cases also.  And, yes, it would go far in dealing with \nthe issue I&#39;m talking about, but it doesn&#39;t go far enough.  A while \nback, I blogged something I call The Golden Rule of API Design:\n\nhttp://blogs.objectmentor.com/ArticleS.MichaelFeathers.TheGoldenRuleOfApiDesign\n\nMichael Feathers\n\ndidoss@... wrote:\n\n&gt;Not sure if this is what you are talking about, but it reminds me of something that I was thinking about this morning,...I&#39;m using an API, and I want to test my use of that API - I was thinking that it would have been nice if they had also provided a test harness for the API,...assuming (possibly erroneously) that they have tested their code, then they probably had to write some testing structures of their objects (like structures that set up HttpRequests to include everything that one of their objects needs/expects to work),...wouldn&#39;t it be so much easier for me if they just provided that structure for me, instead of me having to build it up also.\n&gt;\n&gt;Not sure if that gives you an idea,...or is just completely off-track.  :)  It&#39;s early after a late night of coding.  :)\n&gt;\n&gt;-------------- Original message -------------- \n&gt;From: Elliotte Harold &lt;elharo@...&gt; \n&gt;Michael Feathers wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Unfortunately, programmers who want to unit test their code suffer. API \n&gt;&gt;designers rarely think about testability of client code. I see the \n&gt;&gt;effect nearly every week at client sites.\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;What sort of problems do you see? I admit I don;t think much about the \n&gt;testability of client code either, but I&#39;m not sure how that practically \n&gt;impacts anything. Can you elaborate on these problems you&#39;ve seen?\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n\n",
