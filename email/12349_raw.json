I&#39;m reading J. B. \nRainsberger&#39;s excellent &quot;JUnit Recipes&quot; book and this led me to check \nout mock objects.\n\nI&#39;d like to use mock objects to simulate the behavior of these \ncollaborating objects (until I can refactor the design of course!).  \nVirtualmock seems like a great tool to do this, and the source \nexample in the distribution (iutest/test/functional/SampleTest.java) \nmakes sense to me.  I&#39;ve never done this AOP-style of development \nthough, so while the code seems to make sense, the logic of how to \nmodify my ant script and test process is a mystery to me.\n\n1. Is virtualmock still in development?  I didn&#39;t notice any updates \nfor about 10 months on the Sourceforge project, and Googling for info \non virtualmock returned very little (no mailing list discussions, \netc.?).  The included version of AspectWerkz seems to be out of date \nas well (0.9 included, but now 2.0 is available.)\n\n2. Has there been any additional discussion/documentation on adding \nthe virtualmock / AOP process to my project&#39;s ant test build file?  \n\n3. Does jMock with CGLib provide the functionality to intercept calls \nto concrete objects instantiated by the object under test? (As \nvirtualmock appears to do)\n\n\nI really like virtualmock&#39;s ability to use your compiler&#39;s code \ncompletion and compile-time method invocation validation, though this \ndoesn&#39;t have to be my main selling point.  If jMock with CGLib can \nprovide the same sort of functionality (see my point #3) then I&#39;m \nhappy to try it out as well.\n\n\nThanks for your advice,\n\nDan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
