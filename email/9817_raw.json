The salient \npoint is that the instance variables of the TestCase class implement the \nfixture.\n\n&gt; &lt;snip/&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;  &gt;Yes, but the object that contains them is a fixture. And every such\n&gt; \n&gt; Here you say a fixture is an &#39;object&#39;\n\nIt is.\n\n&gt;  &gt; object instantiated from the same class embodies that fixture. As\n&gt; a\n&gt;  &gt; result, the class itself, being a blueprint for those objects,\n&gt; embodies\n&gt;  &gt; that fixture. Therefore, the test case class and the fixture are\n&gt;  &gt; conceptually the same. The test case class is merely an expression\n&gt; of\n&gt;  &gt; the fixture.\n&gt; \n&gt; Here you seem to say that the fixture is a class. \n&gt; assertEquals(class,object);\n&gt; \n&gt; will that fail?\n\nAs I wrote in my comment to Ron, it is common shorthand to say a \ncollection has a property when all the elements in the collection have \nthat property.\n\nI also clarified, I think rather exceedingly:\n\n  * TestCase object &lt;=&gt; fixture\n  * TestCase class &lt;=&gt; fixture definition\n\nWhen all the objects in a class are the same -- because they all have \nthe same state when initialized -- it may be convenient to refer to &quot;the \nclass&quot; as shorthand for &quot;any instance of the class.&quot;\n\n&gt;  &gt; Was it really necessary to write all that? I am not J J Sylvester.\n&gt; I\n&gt;  &gt; have no interest in proving everything I know to you from first\n&gt; principles.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; My apologies to the wider world for starting this absurd thread;\n&gt; I was\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; just trying to be helpful to the enquirer.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; No, you weren&#39;t. Now that you have established a pattern, I feel I\n&gt; have\n&gt;  &gt; solid ground on which to say this. You were being antagonistic, as\n&gt; you\n&gt;  &gt; have often been, by pretending not only to know it all, but that\n&gt;  &gt; everyone else is therefore incorrect. As I am often accused of\n&gt;  &gt; pretending to know it all -- and sometimes guilty of it -- I\n&gt; surely know\n&gt;  &gt; the signs.\n&gt; \n&gt; I am a newbie to this discussion group (obviously) and am just\n&gt; learning Java and JUnit.. and I can tell you that what Jim is saying\n&gt; is what is being taught at University level now.  Before you\n&gt; click &#39;reply&#39; let me state that I fully understand that University\n&gt; and the &#39;real world&#39; are VERY different worlds.  However in defense\n&gt; of Jim, I have several times considered looking for a different\n&gt; group to follow about JUnit because of you J.B.  You may be King of\n&gt; Programmers but your attitude doesn&#39;t fit well in a discussion\n&gt; community.  I am new to Java but not new to the collaborative\n&gt; community of news and discussion groups.  Let&#39;s learn from each\n&gt; other just as I have learned from all of you guys who know way more\n&gt; about this stuff than I ever will.  But keep in mind, stepping on\n&gt; someone else never makes you any taller. \n\nI am not King of Programmers, nor have I ever claimed to be. This is the \nkind of nonsense that I&#39;ve seen far too much of recently, and frankly, \nI&#39;m getting very tired of it -- and yet /I/ am the one with the \nattitude. /You/ are the one presuming to know what I&#39;m thinking, not I you.\n\nI don&#39;t understand this talk about &quot;my attitude&quot; -- and I am being \ndirect and honest. I have managed to and continue to collaborate \nextremely effectively with many (most?) of the members of this group and \nthe other XP/Agile-related groups, so there are few possibilities.\n\n  * I am in a protracted, bad mood and letting it show\n  * You misunderstand my attitude\n\n....I&#39;m sure there are others, but no more come to mind. Do note that I \nam not saying that either of those is more likely than the other. I&#39;m \njust trying to find as many interpretations for what&#39;s going on as \npossible. I have just run dry quickly.\n\nI feel that some people step on me, and you feel that I step on others, \nso I guess it&#39;s all a question of perspective, isn&#39;t it? Perhaps we&#39;re \nall right.\n-- \nJ. B. Rainsberger,\nDiaspar Software Services\nhttp://www.diasparsoftware.com :: +1 416 791-8603\nLet&#39;s write software that people understand\n\n\n",
