The metric, &quot;McCabe&#39;s Cyclomatic Complexity&quot; would be useful for\nthis as it will tell you how many paths are in a method. A tool such as Java\nMetrics can calculate this for you.\n\nFinally, if you haven&#39;t written the code yet, you may want to consider\nbuilding the test cases and the code up in tandem. For example, write a\nsmall test case, and implement just enough code to make it pass. Then write\nanother test case and a small amount of more code and so on. This way, every\nline of code you write will have coverage.\n\nGood luck,\nDennis\n\n\nOn 2/29/08, Kent Beck &lt;kentb@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; _____\n&gt;\n&gt; From: Veera Raghav Reddy [mailto:veerapulagam@...&lt;veerapulagam%40yahoo.com&gt;]\n&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Friday, February 29, 2008 6:06 AM\n&gt; To: kentb@... &lt;kentb%40earthlink.net&gt;\n&gt; Subject: junit@yahoogroups.com &lt;junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Kent,\n&gt;\n&gt; I am working as QA Engineer\n&gt;\n&gt; I have a requirement for API testing where we have many\n&gt; APIs(Approaximately\n&gt; 250),\n&gt; each API method is going to take 3 to 10 parameters.\n&gt;\n&gt; If i have suppose 4 parameters in a method, the possible cases would be\n&gt; Factorial(4)=24.\n&gt; Is it advisable to prepare test scripts for all 24 methods(positive &\n&gt; negative)?.\n&gt;\n&gt; Method 1:Writing test scripts for each case( positive or negative).ie 24\n&gt; cases for a method which takes 4 parameters\n&gt;\n&gt; Method 2:Preparing common script for a method, using parser read\n&gt; parameters\n&gt; from an xml file and pass them to method\n&gt;\n&gt; Method 3:Preparing common script for a method, read parameters from txt\n&gt; file\n&gt; and pass them to method\n&gt;\n&gt; Note:I have the similar requirement in C# also\n&gt;\n&gt; It would be more appreciated if you suggest me the suitable way among the\n&gt; above methods\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks in advance...\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Raghava\n&gt;\n&gt; _____\n&gt;\n&gt; Never miss a thing.
