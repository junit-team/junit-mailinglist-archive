On the other hand it some times works out better to <br/>\n&gt; run<br/>\n&gt; the build tests and stop on the first error, with developers taking<br/>\n&gt; turns in the &#39;hot seat&#39; to fix their problem and start the build tests<br/>\n&gt; again.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Good point.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlong the same lines, I have had occasion to use the same single test <br/>\nmethod technique with an externalize data file, but allowing for <br/>\nmultiple failures to be accumulated.  While looping through the &quot;rows&quot; <br/>\nof data, the test method catches AssertionFailedError and adds it to a <br/>\ncollection of failures.  When the test suite completes, it dumps out <br/>\nany failures that were collected along the way.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike</div>",
