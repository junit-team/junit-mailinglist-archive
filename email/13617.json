We recommend measuring the marginal cost of each new feature <br/>\ninstead. If we keep that low/steady in spite of arbitrarily low code <br/>\ncoverage, we don&#39;t sweat it. If a client sweats it in spite of <br/>\nlow/steady marginal cost of each new feature, I start looking for my <br/>\nnext client. Life&#39;s too short.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe closer to legacy (= almost no code is test-driven) we are, the more <br/>\nI understand code coverage goals. I respect them more /only until/ we <br/>\nget the marginal cost of adding features down to something reasonable <br/>\n(at least mildly projectable). In that case, seeing a steady increase in <br/>\ncode coverage matters more than the speed of approaching an arbitrary <br/>\nstandard.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Is anyone actually striving for near-100% code coverage?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No. I strive for low defect rates and consistent/projectable and low <br/>\nmarginal cost of new features. My clients appear to appreciate this.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
