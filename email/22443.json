If<br/>\nyou are using parameterized tests as a way to supply examples to a<br/>\nuniversal truth, please log a bug about why it was hard to do with<br/>\nTheories.  :-)  Thanks,<br/>\n<br/>\n   David Saff<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Fri, Feb 12, 2010 at 2:12 PM, Loritsch, Berin C.<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:berin.loritsch@...\">berin.loritsch@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; I know I&#39;m a little slow on the uptake, but I&#39;m asking these questions<br/>\n&gt; so that I can formulate how I&#39;m going to mentor my team to make the most<br/>\n&gt; of their testing investment.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; There is a certain amount of overlap between parameterized tests and<br/>\n&gt; theories.  The parameterized tests are a bit more of a pain to set up;<br/>\n&gt; but they provide a little more control over how things get matched up.<br/>\n&gt; Of course, theories allow for much more robust data sets by combining<br/>\n&gt; all the data points in every way.  This can provide an order of<br/>\n&gt; magnitude more tests automatically, but care has to be taken.  For<br/>\n&gt; example, the number of actual tests run is D^P where D is the number of<br/>\n&gt; data points and P is the number of parameters on any given theory.  This<br/>\n&gt; can generate a lot of tests quickly, and the &quot;runDiscretely&quot; option I<br/>\n&gt; hacked together for theories would definitely not be a preferable.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I now know that assumptions are filtering devices for theories, so it<br/>\n&gt; does not mark the test as failed.  Essentially, the reason that an<br/>\n&gt; assumption is marked as passing for the theory is that the assumption<br/>\n&gt; successfully filtered out that data combination.  I get that now, but I<br/>\n&gt; probably will use that feature very sparingly.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The question I have is what problem was the reason parameterized tests<br/>\n&gt; supposed to solve, and how is that different than the problem that<br/>\n&gt; theories are supposed to solve?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
