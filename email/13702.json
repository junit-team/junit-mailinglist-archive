Don&#39;t break the build. Team size really doesn&#39;t enter into <br/>\nit. To some extent this is cultural. if the team culture allows people <br/>\nto check in code that breaks previously working tests, then yes. <br/>\nDebugging will, be tougher, though I fail to see how distinguishing <br/>\nbetween skipped and errored tests will help. Indeed, sometimes it&#39;s not <br/>\neven the first failed test that makes the problem the most obvious. The <br/>\nmore failed tests you have the more and better the opportunities for <br/>\ndebugging. If one failed test does not have an obvious cause, then try <br/>\nthe next one. You&#39;re just throwing away potentially useful information <br/>\nby offering only one failure.<br/>\n<br/>\nFurthermore, in a team larger than one, I find it even more unlikely <br/>\nthat anyone can untangle the web of dependencies accurately enough to <br/>\nfigure out what tests depend on the functionality tested by which other <br/>\ntests.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nElliotte Rusty Harold  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:elharo@...\">elharo@...</a><br/>\nXML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/\">http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim\">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim</a></div>",
