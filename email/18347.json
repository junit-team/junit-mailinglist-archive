I had attended a<br/>\n&gt; presentation by Robert &quot;Uncle Bob&quot; Martin on Test Driven<br/>\n&gt; development. I think the exact example was a program to keep track<br/>\n&gt; of a bowling game score. Presenting the Big view object model and<br/>\n&gt; one done through incremental, test driven development, the later was<br/>\n&gt; much simpler. It only required the creation of objects needed to<br/>\n&gt; solve the problem rather then the apparent objects and their<br/>\n&gt; behaviour.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I have no doubt that TDD works great on such simple problems and that it can<br/>\neven lead to a reasonable design. Then again, the problem space is so small<br/>\nthat you can argue that no design will really be wrong anyway...<br/>\n<br/>\nNow consider a more realistic example, such as an application that is<br/>\ndealing with five database tables, each with four to ten columns, each of<br/>\nwhich needs to be mapped to Java objects in a sensible way (i.e. not<br/>\nnecessarily mapping the tables and the objects one-to-one) and should also<br/>\ninclude business methods and objects to make it easier to perform<br/>\ndomain-specific operations.<br/>\n<br/>\nUsing TDD to drive such a design is guaranteed to lead to an architecture<br/>\nthat will be focused on solving micro-problems and that will totally miss<br/>\nthe big picture. You are much better off spending a few minutes with a<br/>\npiece of paper or a white board to design your classes and your object<br/>\ndiagram.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to use TDD to implement this model after that, fine, but I<br/>\nreally dispute the idea that TDD should drive the design in the general<br/>\ncase, because TDD simply never gives you the big picture.<br/>\n<br/>\nMakes sense?<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nCédric<br/>\nhttp://testng. &lt;http://testng.org&gt; org<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
