Looking at the current javadoc for Suite.SuiteClasses this \nis almost there, and all you should need to do is put @Inherited at the \nbeginning. So something like this is in order:\n\n@Inherited  // &lt;--- add this\n@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)\n@Target(ElementType.TYPE)\npublic static @interface Suite.SuiteClasses{ //rock on...\n\nThanks! And when can we expect a release? :o)\n\nJeff\n\n\nDavid Saff wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Jeff,\n&gt;\n&gt; Got it. So if @RunWith and @... were @Inherited, your\n&gt; problem would be solved?\n&gt;\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Sorry for the response lag,\n&gt;\n&gt; David Saff\n&gt;\n&gt; On Tue, Nov 4, 2008 at 1:20 PM, Jeff &lt;jjg@... \n&gt; &lt;mailto:jjg%40jqhome.net&gt;&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Hi David!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Here. Let us say that I had test classes, Test0, Test1. Each of these\n&gt; &gt; requires a backend to be configured. I&#39;d like to do something like this:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; @RunWith(Suite.class)\n&gt; &gt; @...({Test0.class, Test1.class})\n&gt; &gt; public abstract class MySuite{\n&gt; &gt; abstract public void setBackend(Backend backend);\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; @BeforeClass\n&gt; &gt; public static void doSetup() throws Exception{\n&gt; &gt; //... stuff to get this all pulled together and configure the tests\n&gt; &gt; }\n&gt; &gt; }\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Then all a tester needs to do is extend the class MySuite, implement the\n&gt; &gt; method and s/he gets to run their backend against my tests.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Complicating factors are that java does not allow for annotations to be\n&gt; &gt; inherited unless the @interface is created with the @Inherited\n&gt; &gt; annotation, so attempts to do what is above kick back the message that\n&gt; &gt; there are no tests to run or some such. At least this is my\n&gt; &gt; understanding of java annotations...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The real life example has not just a couple of test classes, but many\n&gt; &gt; more that very rigorously exercise the backend. The kludge is to have\n&gt; &gt; the abstract MySuite class and have the annotations cut and pasted every\n&gt; &gt; time. This is bad since it will make maintainability problematic (we\n&gt; &gt; have lots of different backend configurations people want to test\n&gt; &gt; against). What&#39;s more several people who want to use this really don&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; know that much about jUnit and we&#39;d really like it to be the case they\n&gt; &gt; can write a backend then get good feedback on robustness, failure modes,\n&gt; &gt; you name it.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Is this clearer?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks in Advance!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Jeff\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; David Saff wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Jeff,\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Can you expand on what you mean by &quot;The problem is that making a suite\n&gt; &gt;&gt; using annotations does not really work so well. The annotations are\n&gt; &gt;&gt; not inherited.&quot;? Can you give an example of what you&#39;d like to do?\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; David Saff\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; On Mon, Nov 3, 2008 at 2:54 PM, Jeff &lt;jjg@... \n&gt; &lt;mailto:jjg%40jqhome.net&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &lt;mailto:jjg%40jqhome.net&gt;&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Hi,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I am new to this group, so if there is a FAQ or thread that addresses\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; this, please direct me appropriately.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I wrote a comprehensive set of tests in jUnit that run under \n&gt; Maven. Now,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; these run against a single backend and now several developers in my\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; group would like to use these tests against other backends to \n&gt; test them.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; The most natural way to do this is with the test suite mechanism in\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; jUnit. That is to say, make up a suite that requires merely that the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; backend be set and test away. Or so I thought.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; The different backends are different projects in our group and \n&gt; live in\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; different Maven modules.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; The problem is that making a suite using annotations does not really\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; work so well. The annotations are not inherited. The other solution\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; which is to have the developers make their own suites by \n&gt; annotations is\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; also very clunky and will probably break at some point.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; So here is my question: Is there any way to make a test suite \n&gt; that is a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; harness and can be reused?\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I assume that jUnit 3.8&#39;s method of explicitly creating a suite \n&gt; is going\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; to get deprecated soon, right? So that would be a deadend. Also, are\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; their plans to make annotations inheritable at some point in \n&gt; jUnit? We\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; could maybe live with cutting and pasting for the short term if \n&gt; we knew\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; that this issue would get resolved at some point.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Thanks!\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Jeff\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n\n\n",
