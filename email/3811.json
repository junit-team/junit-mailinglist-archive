However, <br/>\nyou still need to write the tests - it can&#39;t just &quot;test&quot; software <br/>\nwithout knowing anything about it.  And you may also find that your <br/>\nlegacy code is very hard to test.  This is because of design problems <br/>\nwith code that was not written with testing in mind - tight coupling <br/>\nbetween components, and interfaces that are hard to set up and use.  You <br/>\nmay have to make changes in your existing code to make it testable at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nTry writing some JUnit tests for your existing classes and find out just <br/>\nwhat your problems are.  And in the future, use JUnit as an integral <br/>\npart of your coding process, rather than something you do after the code <br/>\nis done!  You&#39;ll work faster and produce *much* better code.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n<br/>\nDavid Stagner<br/>\n<br/>\nNational Marrow Donor Program<br/>\n3001 Broadway Street NE<br/>\nBroadway Ridge Suite 500<br/>\nMinneapolis, MN  55413<br/>\n<br/>\nEmail: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dstagner@...\">dstagner@...</a></div>",
