Today, we kindly ask you to consider supporting JUnit by backing our crowdfunding campaign!<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s why: Keeping JUnit in shape is a major task for those maintaining and evolving the library. As of today, none of the active maintainers are payed by their employer to do this work. Not surprisingly many unresolved issues have piled up and, what’s worse, there is no hope to get JUnit to support and make use of all the features in Java 8 any time soon.<br/>\n<br/>\nTherefore, we have been preparing a crowdfunding campaign that will allow a team of long-time JUnit committers, backed by a few experienced Java developers, to focus on getting JUnit ready for the years—and JDKs—to come.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am happy to announce that the crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo has started today!<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease check out our problem statement, our vision, and how we are going to spend the money:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://igg.me/at/junit-lambda/x/10121031\">http://igg.me/at/junit-lambda/x/10121031</a><br/>\n<br/>\nPlease also consider asking your employer/company/boss to back the campaign. Depending on the contributed amount, we will publish contributors with name or logo on the JUnit website. Take a look at the perks on Indiegogo!<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\n<br/>\nMarc</div>",
