By <br/>\n&gt; using Javassist together with JUnit I managed to add a powerful yet <br/>\n&gt; simple way of doing declarative (from the test-class) mocking of <br/>\n&gt; troublesome classes in the class tree you are about to test. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Read about it here: <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tobyonrails.blogspot.com/2005/09/junitassist-unfolds-catch-\">http://tobyonrails.blogspot.com/2005/09/junitassist-unfolds-catch-</a><br/>\n&gt; 22.html<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You cheated by modifying JUnit ;-) Does it work with the eclipse runner?<br/>\n<br/>\nI was working on something similar, extending JUnit. The big problem is how to insert the custom classloader early enough in each test run.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had created a test decorator to do this that works with 3.8.1 but now I would like to target junit4. I am not sure how to continue as the whole decorator concept will die. With the new architecture there seems to be very little oportunity to extend junit with anything that is not built in.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Neil</div>",
