No real world classloader environment\n&gt; \n&gt; I assert that it is almost a proper testing environment. For many, if\n&gt; not most, JUnit users, the class loading tests work and work better\n&gt; than the alternative because they allow a developer to leave the Swing\n&gt; UI running and rerun an individual test after changing it in the IDE.\n&gt; As the usage of JUnit expans, many people run the Swing UI in what I\n&gt; would consider strange environments. I often wonder why they aren&#39;t\n&gt; just running the textui, but I digress. Since those environment are\n&gt; common, and the loading behavior introduces problems it would probably\n&gt; be best to change the Swing UI to default to noloading. Eliminating the\n&gt; class loading behavior would be a huge disservice to the devlopers who\n&gt; use it daily to increase their feedback by running tests while coding.\n\n&quot;Almost&quot; and &quot;Are&quot; can sometimes be a mile apart.  Defaulting to the\n&quot;-nonloading&quot; option is a step in the right direction.  However, what\nabout this possibility:\n\nThe same classloader is run for all tests.  When the Swing runner is asked\nto re-run a test or group of tests, create a new Classloader for the\nenvironment.\n\nThe important thing here is consistency.  In this situation, we do not\nhave a new ClassLoader for each individual *Test* (which may be simply\nanother method in the same class).  We have a new ClassLoader for each\nindividual *Run*.  This provides the flexibility the users want, AND\nthe stable environment everyone craves.\n\nHave you guys considered that route and run into snags?\n\n-- \n\n&quot;Those who would trade liberty for\n temporary security deserve neither&quot;\n                - Benjamin Franklin\n\n",
