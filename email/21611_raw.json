I\n&gt; &gt; saw some previous discussi=\r\non about such fixtures in JDave.\n&gt; \n&gt; I think there were two different dire=\r\nctions going on here.  It sounds\n&gt; like you want JUnit, when given the oute=\r\nr class, to automatically\n&gt; instantiate the inner classes.  It sounded like=\r\n JDave wanted JUnit,\n&gt; when given the inner class, to automatically consult=\r\n the outer class\n&gt; when instantiating.\n&gt; \n&gt; Am I getting both requests righ=\r\nt?  If not, then we&#39;re getting close to\n&gt; a Rule of Three threshold for reu=\r\nse.  If I am, then I see the same\n&gt; Java idiom having two different &quot;obviou=\r\ns&quot; interpretations to two\n&gt; different classes of user.\n\nDavid, I believe yo=\r\nu&#39;re getting both requests right.  In my case, the inner classes are to be =\r\ninstantiated along with the enclosing class when the enclosing class is run=\r\n, but never instantiated and run on their own.  I ended up accomplishing th=\r\nis via the AllTests runner and suite() methods that adapt the enclosing cla=\r\nss and inner class instances as JUnit 3.8-style Test adapters.  I also want=\r\ned to tie the inner class instances to a specific enclosing class instance,=\r\n because the inner classes use fixture fields from an enclosing instance.\n\n=\r\nIt looks as though the requirement for JDave inner class contexts is that t=\r\nhey be instantiable and runnable on their own, independent of their sibling=\r\n contexts -- and that the requestor would have liked for such contexts to a=\r\ndopt whatever Runner a @RunWith on the enclosing class might have specified=\r\n.\n\nOff the top of my head, I can&#39;t think of a clean way for JUnit to suppor=\r\nt both strategies in the core proper.\n\nI may try satisfying my specific use=\r\n case in another way, perhaps using an as-yet-developed kind of Runner.  Th=\r\ne AllTests way still seems a bit icky, but works for now.\n\nThanks,\nPaul Hol=\r\nser\n\n\n\n",
