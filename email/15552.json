Personally, I wouldn&#39;t care.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; I personally don&#39;t like expecting exceptions in tests because I wish<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to verify the state of the exception, but each to their own...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It seems to be more an exception than a rule, but you can always stick to<br/>\n&gt; the try/catch approach if you really need that.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What &quot;state&quot; do you usually check on your exceptions?  Except for the<br/>\n&gt; message (which is probably not a good idea since you need to plan for<br/>\n&gt; internationalization), there is not much in that object, unless you make<br/>\n&gt; heavy use of your own exceptions (not a very common occurrence in my<br/>\n&gt; experience).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It&#39;s a coding idiom: I want to know what caused the exception, so the<br/>\nstate usually is a set of objects that describe that cause.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, for example: if I&#39;m throwing an IllegalArgumentException, specify<br/>\nwhich argument was illegal. If I&#39;m trying to access a database table<br/>\nthat doesn&#39;t exist, specify which table. If I&#39;m throwing a<br/>\nClassCastException, specify what class I&#39;ve got and what I&#39;m trying to<br/>\ncast it to.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom this state, it&#39;s possible to create messages as needed. However,<br/>\nthe test that verifies the exception is thrown shouldn&#39;t care about<br/>\nthe message - tests on the exception itself can do that part.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and I make heavy use of my own exceptions. The one &quot;exception&quot; to<br/>\nthis rule I have are RuntimeExceptions - I tend to use those for<br/>\n&quot;can&#39;t happen&quot; situations (and regularly get surprised when they do).<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\n               &quot;Software is too expensive to build cheaply&quot;<br/>\nRobert Watkins           <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://twasink.net/\">http://twasink.net/</a>           <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:robertdw@...\">robertdw@...</a></div>",
