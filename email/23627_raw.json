In order:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1)=\r\n acknowledgements.txt is an attempt at a log of everyone outside of\n&gt; the p=\r\nrimary maintainers who has contributed in some way to JUnit.  It\n&gt; was, I b=\r\nelieve, originally intended to serve two purposes: (a) for\n&gt; traceability, =\r\nshould any legal questions arise about the provenance of\n&gt; a piece of code,=\r\n (b) before github, we often ended up massaging (or\n&gt; replacing) patches ou=\r\nrselves before committing them to CVS, and we\n&gt; wanted a way to genuinely t=\r\nhank and remember the original authors.\n&gt; \n&gt; GitHub now helps with both of =\r\nthese issues: since we can discuss pull\n&gt; requests before they&#39;re accepted,=\r\n we can ask contributors to fix minor\n&gt; issues, and github keeps excellent =\r\ntrack of what came from where.  In\n&gt; addition, distributed maintenance of t=\r\nhe acknowledgements.txt file has\n&gt; become a pain, since as a linear documen=\r\nt, there is often a race\n&gt; condition between appended items.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2) I&#39;ve b=\r\neen asking committers to include updates to ReleaseNotes\n&gt; files as part of=\r\n check-ins.  This has some of the same issues as\n&gt; above: it&#39;s no longer st=\r\nrictly necessary given GitHub support, and\n&gt; also leads to race conditions.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; So, my proposal is:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) Drop further appends to acknowedgements.t=\r\nxt\n&gt; 2) Adopt a more formal approach to git commit messages, following\n&gt; al=\r\nong http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html,\n&gt;=\r\n along release notes to be largely auto-generated at release time.\n&gt; \n&gt; Tho=\r\nughts?\n&gt;\n\n\n\n",
