Rainsberger [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jbr@...\">jbr@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt;Sent: Thursday, May 02, 2002 1:41 PM<br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: RE: [junit] Testing getXXX( ) and setXXX( ) methods<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Quoting &quot;Stevens, Timothy J. (LNG-MBC)&quot; <br/>\n&gt;&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:timothy.j.stevens@...\">timothy.j.stevens@...</a>&gt;:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; \tCan&#39;t break!!?? You never make typos and return the <br/>\n&gt;wrong variable<br/>\n&gt;&gt; in a getter, or set the wrong variable in a setter? If so, you&#39;re a<br/>\n&gt;&gt; better<br/>\n&gt;&gt; coder than me :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I hope this was tongue-in-cheek. I don&#39;t think I have *ever* <br/>\n&gt;returned the wrong <br/>\n&gt;variable from a getX() method[1]. In order to make this <br/>\n&gt;mistake, I&#39;d have to be <br/>\n&gt;drunk. As for setting the wrong variable in a setX() method, <br/>\n&gt;see my previous <br/>\n&gt;message. I&#39;ve made that mistake exactly once.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s wonderful. I have made this mistake greater than one times (and I wasn&#39;t drunk! :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Folks, don&#39;t test the getX() and setX() methods; but rather <br/>\n&gt;test that the <br/>\n&gt;constructor stores the appropriate parameter in the <br/>\n&gt;appropriate field. I know <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>But isn&#39;t this what testing the setter and getter is doing?? While I am in the minority here, I am testing my accessors and I am intending to continue testing my accessors. I have no desire to change your behaviour, but there are other people out there who are going to read this and ask themselves whether they are wrong or paranoid to be testing getters and setters. To these people, I say &quot;Test away!&quot; I have found it useful to test everything that I can. You do not find it useful, so don&#39;t test what you are certain cannot break.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I&#39;m about 100 times more likely to write a bug there than in <br/>\n&gt;the getX() or setX<br/>\n&gt;() method itself.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s your personal situation. Some of us still make that mistake.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been programming since I was in my early teens (1980 if I remember correctly) and I still have a couple of mistakes that I make regularly. My most common one is to forget to increment loop counters. Now that&#39;s a dumb mistake and I&#39;m sure that I&#39;m the only person on the list who makes that mistake, but make it I do. Those endless loops always make for lots of fun! :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;[1] Note that I&#39;m ignoring cases where the compiler caught a typo.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Not all languages that junit has been ported to will do that!<br/>\n<br/>\nSimon</div>",
