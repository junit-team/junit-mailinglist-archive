Holly&#39;s point might be made clearer by saying that software \n&gt; quality needs appropriate objective measures whether you are your own \n&gt; customer, whether you have actual customers (or their proxies, as in \n&gt; product management) or whether you are working on some new secret \n&gt; product that takes input partly select, NDA-bound potential customers or \n&gt; partners.  XP&#39;s insistence on frequent interaction with the customer, \n&gt; small incremental releases with feedback rolled back in frequently, is \n&gt; great and works to a certain extent.   Maybe it works better on smaller \n&gt; team projects (&quot;like it says on the box,&quot; as Steve Freeman likes to say).\n\nObjective measures of software quality:\n  * return on investment, including ancillary benefits such as the \nability to capitalize (literally) on more market opportunities\n  * defect reports from outside the development organization\n  * customer/user satisfaction\n\nI&#39;m sure there are more.\n\n&gt; In my experience, the customer (maybe &quot;paying consumer&quot; is less \n&gt; equivocal for what I mean here) has a reasonable expectation that the \n&gt; vendor will quantify, track and ensure good software quality with little \n&gt; or no involvement of the customer, just like there is an implicit \n&gt; expectation to have managers and team leads, build automation, source \n&gt; control and a QA process.  I mean nothing other than the same \n&gt; expectation we have that food at the grocery is not poisoned or rotten.\n\nOf course we have to build software that works -- that&#39;s is a certain \npart of quality and we programmers manage that. We also have to build \nsoftware that solves problems, which is the more important part of \nquality and the customer has to be involved in managing that, otherwise \nwe don&#39;t know what problems to solve.\n\nDon&#39;t forget that we also have a certain expectation that the grocery \nstore also have a wide selection of products. High-quality apples alone \nisn&#39;t enough for the produce section. Gotta have oranges, too.\n\n&gt; Personally, I think there are many ways to quantify &quot;better&quot; software \n&gt; and development and design processes.  Business value is hard to \n&gt; quantify, especially with predictive power.\n\nIt&#39;s essentially impossible, isn&#39;t it? Even the projections are wonky at \nbest. In the end, someone trusts his gut.\n\n&gt; Customer willingness and \n&gt; satisfaction are relative and qualitative.  \n\nAgreed, but cashflow is quantitative. The continuing flow of cash from \nthe paying customer to the programmers is a quantitative measure of the \nquality of products and services the programmers provide. It is \ntherefore a quantitative measure of the quality of their work and by \nextension the software itself. It&#39;s still relative, but everything&#39;s \nrelative.\n\n &gt; I at least think CMM/CMMI\n&gt; has some value, but the bureaucratic weight of it is inhuman, in my \n&gt; little experience with it at a consulting firm a few years back.  There \n&gt; I am in agreement with JB.\n\nI&#39;m sure CMM/CMMI has value to someone somewhere, but not to me now and \nlikely never to me.\n\n&gt; I think the truth must be somewhere in \n&gt; between, but the larger your software engineering organization, the more \n&gt; likely you need something like CMM.  The smaller and better skilled and \n&gt; experienced your team is, the more they will probably benefit from agile \n&gt; methodolgies and practices.  Most places I have seen use some of both, \n&gt; with a lean toward process and documentation simply because so much \n&gt; money is at stake all the time.\n\nI don&#39;t understand why one prefers waste (process definition and \ndocumentation) when money is at stake. I would expect the opposite. Here \nI use the word &quot;waste&quot; is its clinical sense, as the Poppendiecks define it.\n\n-- \nJ. B.
