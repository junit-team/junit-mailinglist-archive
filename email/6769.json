I am in a race with my wife to<br/>\ncomplete an article by Wednesday night, when I return home from lovely<br/>\nLexington MA. I figure this is a good way to prod her into writing one<br/>\nof the many books she&#39;s threatened to write in the past few years.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;An alternative title comes to mind:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    &quot;How to decouple your code from their framework&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is an excellent title. I just may use it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;People tell me that books and articles with &quot;testing&quot; in the title<br/>\n </span></blockquote>don&#39;t <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;sell as well as they&#39;d like.  It&#39;s a shame really, and I hope to help <br/>\n&gt;change that mentality.  One of my tactics in doing so, as you well<br/>\n </span></blockquote>know, <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;is to convince readers that testing is also a design activity.  As<br/>\n </span></blockquote>such, <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I should be able to change any phrase about testing into a phrase<br/>\n </span></blockquote>about <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;design.  It&#39;s something I&#39;ve been practicing, and this title is one <br/>\n&gt;attempt.     <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I have noticed that, even in the words I&#39;ve written so far, that I<br/>\noften write, &quot;... use this stuff to write the test that drives the<br/>\ndesign you need to complete your task.&quot; A bit wordy, but repeated often<br/>\nenough, it may hammer home the very point you&#39;re making.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Now, please write that article!  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I wrote for 30 minutes on the plane and about an hour when I got here.<br/>\nSee: I&#39;m good!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJ.
