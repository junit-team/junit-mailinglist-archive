That&#39;s just our opinion, but \n&gt;there you have it.\n\nRight, but both Errors and RuntimeExceptions are unchecked exceptions (i.e.\ndon&#39;t require a &quot;catch&quot; or &quot;throws&quot; declaration).  The question is, which\none should AssertionFailedException derive from.\n\nFrom the JDK 1.2.2 JavaDocs:\n\n&quot;An Error is a subclass of Throwable that indicates serious problems that a\nreasonable application should not try to catch. Most such errors are\nabnormal conditions. The ThreadDeath error, though a &quot;normal&quot; condition, is\nalso a subclass of Error because most applications should not try to catch it.&quot;\n\n&quot;RuntimeException is the superclass of those exceptions that can be thrown\nduring the normal operation of the Java Virtual Machine.&quot;\n\nJohn Brewer\nJera Design\n\n",
