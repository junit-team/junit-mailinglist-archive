And the test in question is &quot;server-independent&quot;, so \nit&#39;s not that.  Threading is a big issue (there are several in the system), \nbut I don&#39;t think  they&#39;re any running that should affect this test.  Still, \nI&#39;ll look closer at it when I return to work after the holidays.\n\n\nOn Thursday 18 December 2003 22:47, Chad Woolley wrote:\n&gt; Just had another idea on this one.  Sometimes, this situation can be\n&gt; time-dependent.\n&gt;\n&gt; For example, if your test machine is on local time, and your database\n&gt; server is on GMT, and you try to compare dates, you can get an\n&gt; intermittent failure.  This is because there is a window each day where\n&gt; the dates are different.\n&gt;\n&gt; Or, it could be thread-related.  Some rare condition that depends on the\n&gt; underlying OS threading model, that only occurred in certain conditions.\n&gt;\n&gt; Just some ideas.  If you do ever figure it out, please post to the list.\n&gt;   I&#39;d be interested to know what it was.\n&gt;\n&gt; -- Chad\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; David Corbin wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;I&#39;ve got one tests which fails sporadically, and I cannot figure out any\n&gt; &gt;&gt;reason for it to be non-deterministic in MY code.  I&#39;ve added some\n&gt; &gt;&gt;logging statements, but It&#39;s hard to get to fail.\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
