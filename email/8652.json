I need to run a <br/>\nmethod that connect to a RMI registry and gets references to all <br/>\nservices.<br/>\nAs I need to accomplish this once before my tests, I&#39;m satisfied on <br/>\nrunning it on the setUp() method of a TestSetup. When I&#39;m calling the <br/>\ntests, I pass a suite to the TestSetup and everything works fine.<br/>\nThe problem is that I need to specify, through the command-line, if I <br/>\nwant to run a particular test or the whole suite of them. As I&#39;m <br/>\nusing ant, it&#39;s something like this:<br/>\n<br/>\nant ---&gt; runs the whole suite of tests<br/>\nant &lt;nameoftestcase&gt; ---&gt; runs only a particular test case<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause of the precondition, I run into trouble. If I let the <br/>\nprecondition method into the TestSetup method, I lose it when I run a <br/>\nsingle test case. If I put it on each TestCase code (on a superclass <br/>\nfor example) I&#39;ll have a lot of redundancy when I run the suite.<br/>\nI&#39;ve tried also to run the connection with the RMI before running <br/>\njunit, as another Ant task, but it doesn&#39;t work. I don&#39;t know what <br/>\nhappens in this case, but it seems to me that another JVM is issued <br/>\nand the tests can&#39;t access the references created by the connection <br/>\nmethod.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes anyone know what could I possibly do? Maybe another approach?<br/>\nThanks in advance,<br/>\nLeonardo Barros</div>",
