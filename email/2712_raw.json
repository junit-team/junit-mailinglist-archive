I&#39;m stuck.  My program reads a property file and processes the\n &gt; various properties found. To test this, I have some dummy property\n &gt; files that I use and JUnit tests that read those files and check\n &gt; various things.\n &gt;\n &gt; In an effort to &quot;improve&quot; things, I thought that I could, for testing,\n &gt; use a string as the input stream for the properties and then just\n &gt; use strings in the JUnit tests, insead of having a dozen property files.\n &gt;\n &gt; However, I&#39;m stuck trying to figure out how to do this (warning - Java\n &gt; novice)...\n &gt;\n &gt; The Properties.load() call wants an input stream. For the application,\n &gt; I can create a FileInputStream and pass this to the load() call. For\n &gt; testing, I wanted to use StringBufferInputStream, but that class is\n &gt; deprecated. Instead, they say to use StringReader.\n &gt;\n &gt; How can I convert a StringReader object into a InputStream object so\n &gt; that it can be passed to Properties.load()? Is this possible? If not,\n &gt; are there any other ways to do this, other than using a deprecated\n &gt; class?\n &gt;\n &gt; I&#39;d really like to simplify the tests, as there are many properties\n &gt; that I want to check to make sure they are processed correctly.\n &gt;\n &gt; Thanks in advance!\n &gt;\n &gt;\n &gt; PCM (Paul Michali)\n &gt;\n &gt; Carrier Voice Gateway Business Unit (CVGBU)\n &gt; Cisco Systems, Inc.\n &gt; 250 Apollo Drive\n &gt; Chelmsford, MA 01824\n &gt;\n &gt; Phone : (800) 572-6771 x 45817  (978) 244-5817 [direct]\n &gt; Paging: (800) 365-4578 [voice]  pcm@...
