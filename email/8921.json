To the extent I am an &quot;OO<br/>\npurist&quot;, I am one because it helps me write better code faster. As does<br/>\nJunit - among other things by bringing coupling problems to light.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I attempt to write standalone (decoupled)<br/>\n&gt; classes, I attempt to make them have well structed &quot;APIs&quot; but<br/>\n&gt; at the end of the day, if A uses B (however implemented, and<br/>\n&gt; however used -- aggregation, subclassing, command/messaging paradigms,<br/>\n&gt; whatever) *for whatever reason* then surely for A to work, B<br/>\n&gt; ought work?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No. A can use B without even knowing about it! And if it doesn&#39;t know<br/>\nabout B, you can simply replace B with B&#39; for your A-tests.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I don&#39;t think we ever gave these fair hearing because (I<br/>\n&gt; feel) we spent all the time on why the idea was bad. To be<br/>\n&gt; frank, I didn&#39;t think anybody was listening,<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think the more constructive approach might be to question ones own<br/>\nability to explain instead of the others willingness to listen. I might<br/>\nbe wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I think the points (one by one) that need to get agreed or dismissed<br/>\n&gt; are: <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 1) Are test suites (as collections of tests, which have some<br/>\n&gt; hierarchical/run order effect) are a &quot;second place&quot; to manage<br/>\n&gt; relationship between testcases? Since managing in two places<br/>\n&gt; is always flawed, are suites flawed? [If I refactor testcases<br/>\n&gt; I might forget to refactor the suites, and that is where errors creep<br/>\n&gt; in.]<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Please explain wether you are speaking about manually or automatically<br/>\nconstructed suites here (or both?).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 2) Are test suites becoming obsoleted by &quot;brute force<br/>\n&gt; collectors&quot;? How would we know other than a user survey?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It seems to me that the TestSuite class can&#39;t become obsolete by<br/>\ncollectors, as the collectors need to use it. So I don&#39;t understand what<br/>\nyou&#39;d like to do based on that survey.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 3) If &quot;suites&quot; have outlived their purpose, why are they the<br/>\n&gt; &quot;framework&quot; way to manage run order?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>They aren&#39;t. They are the frameworks way to have a hierarchical<br/>\ncollection of tests. I don&#39;t know of any alternative.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 4) Does &quot;run order/dependency&quot; (not side-effect dependency)<br/>\n&gt; have any value -- despite it&#39;s smell?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Of course it does, to some users of the framework. And there are already<br/>\ntools out there providing that value. If they don&#39;t suffice, it would be<br/>\nvery easy to implement your own.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 5) Is &quot;run order&quot; something that ought be in the framework, however<br/>\n&gt; it is implemented. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>&quot;Run order&quot; is something that is in the framework. How to decide about<br/>\nrun order isn&#39;t - and shouldn&#39;t be, IMHO.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; As agree w/ David, in a mail I sent yesterday but haven&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; seen list exploded yet, I *may* be right about some of this,<br/>\n&gt; but I don&#39;t think dependency will get an open hearing &#39;cos of<br/>\n&gt; the stench of side-effect dependency. So be it.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If you think so, perhaps we should stop this discussion?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards, Ilja</div>",
