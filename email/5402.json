Easier to automate most of the steps (run x n, merge,<br/>\n&gt; report).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Last time I got 0% coverage was because I accidentally had a * <br/>\nexclusion<br/>\n&gt; filter.  Check your filters in the Coverage launchpad.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Another benefit to Ant&#39;s jpcoverage is that the exclusion/inclusion<br/>\n&gt; mechanism is a little more &quot;in your face.&quot;  And if you use <br/>\njpcovreport,<br/>\n&gt; you get a much nicer looking report than the JProbe HTML report.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Scott Stirling<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: majortaylor [mailto:majortaylor@y...] <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hi,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m trying to get some code coverage for my junit tests. I&#39;m <br/>\nusing <br/>\n&gt; &gt; JProbe Coverage from Sitraka software to get the code coverage <br/>\n&gt; &gt; information.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; JPCoverage calls ant which in turn runs my unit tests. I&#39;ve been <br/>\n&gt; &gt; careful to set &quot;fork=&quot;no&quot; in my junit ant task so that my tests <br/>\nrun <br/>\n&gt; &gt; in the same jvm as ant.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Despite this, and despite the fact that it&#39;s clear my tests are <br/>\n&gt; &gt; executing, jpcoverage is still reporting 0% coverage of my <br/>\n&gt; &gt; code. Does anybody have any experience with this? I&#39;m <br/>\n&gt; &gt; wondering what I <br/>\n&gt; &gt; could be doing wrong.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I realize that there&#39;s also a jpcoverage ant task which would <br/>\nthen <br/>\n&gt; &gt; run JProbe inside my ant project (rather than vice versa); would <br/>\nthis <br/>\n&gt; &gt; be a superior approach? I suspect I would have the same problem.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Thanks,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; MT </span></blockquote></div>",
