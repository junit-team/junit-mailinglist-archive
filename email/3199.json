    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1763560508\">I have knocked together a patch for JUnit 3.7 which enables you to - in<br/>\neffect - pick up mock objects from your CLASSPATH - i.e. you do not need to<br/>\ndo anything special to get mock objects to be used by the code - it just<br/>\nworks. The patch enables you to specify which mock objects are loaded on a<br/>\nper Test class basis. E.g. if in TestA, you want the code to use a mock &quot;C&quot;<br/>\nimplementation, but in TestB you want to use a real &quot;C&quot; implementation then<br/>\nthis can be achieved with the patch.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis works without having to write your &quot;real&quot; code in any special way -<br/>\ni.e. you don&#39;t have to write the code to support the tests.<br/>\n<br/>\nBelow is a description of how to set up and use the patch to give you a<br/>\nflavour of how it works. If anyone is interested in receiving it, just send<br/>\nme a mail and I&#39;ll send it to you...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPatch instructions:<br/>\n<br/>\nIn your junit3.7 directory replace the existing junit.jar with the patched<br/>\none.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome notes:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) This only works if you have dynamic reloading switched on (which<br/>\nshould be default anyway)<br/>\n2) To use, add the directory where you mock objects are as a -D<br/>\nparameter, i.e.<br/>\n<br/>\njava<br/>\n-Djunit.mockpath=c:&#92;path-to-my-mock-objects junit.swingui.TestRunner<br/>\n<br/>\n3) The mock objects directory should *not* be in your CLASSPATH<br/>\n4) In the directory where you keep your tests create a properties file<br/>\nfor each test, e.g. if you have a class called TestB, then you have a<br/>\nproperties file called TestB.properties. Each line in the file looks like<br/>\nthis:<br/>\n<br/>\nincluded.&lt;n&gt;=&lt;class name&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhere &lt;n&gt; is a unique integer (make sure it is unique or you&#39;ll get<br/>\nstrange results!), and &lt;class name&gt; is the name of a class that you want<br/>\nloaded from the mock objects directory.<br/>\n5) Make sure that you have the directory containing the head of the<br/>\npackage structure that contains your properties file in your CLASSPATH,<br/>\ne.g. if you have a properties file for class mypackage.TestMyClass<br/>\nstored in the following file:<br/>\nc:&#92;javadev&#92;mypackage&#92;TestMyClass.properties<br/>\n<br/>\nThen you should have the following in your CLASSPATH:<br/>\nc:&#92;javadev<br/>\n<br/>\nThats all<br/>\n<br/>\nMatt<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n_____ <br/>\nThis email and any attachments are confidential and are intended only for <br/>\nthe addressee.
