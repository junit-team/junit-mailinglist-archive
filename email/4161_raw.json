Tests do not explain the methods, merely give examples of use.\n2. Tests do show intention of the method, just the implementation (we&#39;re\nback to the &quot;the implementation is not the design argument&quot;).\n\nBecause of these problems I dont rely on them for documentation (if you have\nany resolutions to these, I&#39;d like to hear)\n\nOn a side note, I do use tests to enforce the contract of interfaces, which\nI guess complements the documentation..\n\njoe\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Mike Clark [mailto:mike@...]\n&gt; Sent: 21 February 2002 20:35\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: Re: [junit] Re: JavaDocs\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Shane Duan wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; The method summary, I would say.  This is true especially when I was\n&gt; &gt; studying JDK 1.4 and try to learn the new classes.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Fair enough.  Some of the method-level JavaDoc comments in \n&gt; the JDK are pretty good.  Then again, it&#39;s very heavily used \n&gt; and not subject to a lot of\n&gt; change.\n&gt; \n&gt; In general, I find most method-level JavaDoc to be \n&gt; superfluous at best, and inaccurate at the worst.  It&#39;s easy \n&gt; to forget to update them, so often\n&gt; they lie.  If I have to add a lot of comments to the method \n&gt; to express its intent, then it&#39;s probably doing more than it \n&gt; should or not well named.\n&gt; Tests don&#39;t lie, so I&#39;m inclined to look at any existing \n&gt; tests to determine how a method is really intended to behave. \n&gt;  I typically use JavaDoc\n&gt; simply to look up a method signature, which can easily be \n&gt; kept in synch with the code using an automated build process.\n&gt; \n&gt; Mike\n&gt; --\n&gt; Mike Clark\n&gt; Clarkware Consulting, Inc.\n&gt; http://www.clarkware.com\n&gt; 720.851.2014\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
