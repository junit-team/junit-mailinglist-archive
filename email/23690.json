    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-318323783\">Perhaps of interest is that we (the QA devs where I work) use a custom runner that slightly alters this behavior of Theories: if all of a Theory&#39;s assumptions fail, then we mark the test as skipped (as opposed to failed). This brings the semantics of the assume*() methods in the context of a @Test&#39;s and @Theory&#39;s much closer.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Background: this custom runner is used in a Selenium/WebDriver setup that is meant to test the UI of a system, irrespective of the system&#39;s underlying config/database. As such it is not uncommon that no suitable PotentialAssignments can be found for a given test setup. Yes, I am aware that this kind of test is anything but a unit test, but JUnit serves us very well regardless.)<br/>\n<br/>\nStephan<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, David Saff &lt;david@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So, it would be up to individual runners to figure out how to fit into<br/>\n&gt; the overall scheme.  Right now, the Theories runner doesn&#39;t report up<br/>\n&gt; individual assumption failures.  If every single data point results in<br/>\n&gt; an assumption failure, then the test is marked as failing.  If at<br/>\n&gt; least one data point fails, the test is marked as failing.  If at<br/>\n&gt; least one data point succeeds, and none fail, it&#39;s marked passing.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;     David<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On Mon, Sep 19, 2011 at 4:23 PM, Stephen Connolly<br/>\n&gt; &lt;stephen.alan.connolly@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I think there are a number of issues with this categorization...
