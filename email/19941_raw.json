E.G. I have a few Fortune Cookies that are stored in an array of \n&gt; Strings. I&#39;ve written some code that returns them randomly. \n&gt; What is the best method for testing? i.e. should I be using Mocks?\n&gt; If anybody has any good examples or relevant web sites please let me \n&gt; know.\n\nSam,\n\nWhen faced with a question like this, I always ask, &quot;What are you trying \nto test?&quot;\n\nAre you trying to test your randomness algorithm or trying to test that \nyou can return a fortune given an index and that index happens to be random.\n\nMy best advice is to split the problem in half. Don&#39;t try to test \nreturning a random fortune. Test that, given a sequence of fortunes, you \ncan return the next one when asked. In your test system, you can set up \na known sequence of fortunes, and in your real system, you can set up a \nrandom sequence. Hide the sequence generation behind an interface and \nyou can mock it for tests, and use real randomness in production.\n\nI hope this makes sense :) If not, ask away again.\n\nbab\n\n-- \nBrian Button\t\tbrian.button@...\nVP Engineering\t\thttp://www.asolutions.com\nAsynchrony Solutions\thttp://oneagilecoder.asolutions.com\nSt. Louis, MO\t\t636.399.3146\n\nExtreme Programming in St Louis - http://groups.yahoo.com/group/xpstl\n\n",
