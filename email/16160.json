It looks to me that this is something <br/>\n&gt; that could work in a custom runner--are you interested in seeing if<br/>\nthis <br/>\n&gt; is so?<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe. My time is pretty limited in the coming weeks though. One thing<br/>\nto think about: maybe it&#39;d make sense to have a filteredTrace property<br/>\non the result object (I&#39;m not sure how this actually works, would we<br/>\nneed to clone exceptions).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat use cases are you thinking of for unfiltered stack traces? Are<br/>\nthese cases so common that a system property to toggle the filtering<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t meet everyone&#39;s needs?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe fact that both ant and eclipse (the two main frontends to junit)<br/>\nfilter stack traces *by default* seems to be a sign that the primary<br/>\nuser base wants filtering. However, the filters used today actually<br/>\nlose *real* data because they filter out things like sun&#39;s reflection<br/>\ntechnology, which might be important for a test case that used reflection.<br/>\n <br/>\n&gt; Also, thank you for all of your feedback so far, and please do keep <br/>\n&gt; considering ways we can improve the framework.  The sourceforge project <br/>\n&gt; page has a convenient place for any future patches.  Thanks,<br/>\n<br/>\nOk, thanks. I wasn&#39;t quite sure what the best place was.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Ben </span></blockquote></div>",
