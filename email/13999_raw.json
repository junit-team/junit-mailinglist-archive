However, one of our goals in JUnit 4\n&gt; was to remove the recursive composition of tests. It is\n&gt; difficult to explain and difficult to support properly in\n&gt; test runners. What I need is an example of JUnit 4-style\n&gt; dynamic test case creation.\n\nMan; I&#39;ve been cursing JBuilder for several years for its complete \nlack of &#39;suite&#39; method support!  I can do data-driven tests without \nit, but doing so pretty much destroys the value of Assert methods; I \nmust dump all the failures to System.err, and fail a summary.\n\nExamples:\n\nSay I&#39;m writing a few &quot;sort&quot; routines, to be used in different \ncases.  Let&#39;s start with a simplistic bubble sort.  I write some \ntests and get BubbleSort implemented.  Now I want to write an \nInsertionSort.  First, I&#39;d like to reuse all the existing tests, \nwith an InsertionSort object.  How can I do this when *THE TOOL* has \ncomplete control over what tests get run, meaning that I have *NO \nCONTROL* over it?!?!?\n\nPretty much the same story for testing interfaces:\nI&#39;d like to write a TestCase child class, with all the tests for an \ninterface.  Then for every implementer, I&#39;ll say &quot;run all the tests \nin that TestCase class, but use this data (this implementation) for \ntesting.&quot;  For one thing, this means I&#39;m customizing TestSuite to \npass parameters to the constructors.\n\nThe &quot;suite&quot; method is the escape valve for everything JUnit can&#39;t do \nby itself.  Don&#39;t take it away from us!\n\n\n\n\n",
