Maybe it can be incorporated<br/>\ninto the GUI Runner, or maybe it should be an &quot;independent daemon&quot;.  I&#39;m<br/>\nstill trying to learn the 10 minute-cycle, but I can see a warning that<br/>\nyou haven&#39;t run the test in 8 minutes (giving you 2 minutes) to fix your<br/>\ntest and run it.  Who knows.  Seems like a lot of possible ways to<br/>\nconfigure things.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nDavid Corbin \t\t<br/>\nMach Turtle Technologies, Inc.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.machturtle.com\">http://www.machturtle.com</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dcorbin@...\">dcorbin@...</a></div>",
