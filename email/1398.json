However I think I would be reluctant to <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; change the way my<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; code was implemented just so that I could test it, as some <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; of the other<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; My experience is different. I&#39;ve found that changing my <br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; coding style to make it testable (which doesn&#39;t mean just <br/>\n&gt;&gt; putting in lots of unnecessary accessors) also makes it <br/>\n&gt;&gt; better. The more I apply this to different targets, such as <br/>\n&gt;&gt; shell scripts, the more I&#39;m convinced. <br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Steve<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; I concur.  I&#39;ve found that testable code exhibits certain composable <br/>\n&gt;&gt; properties that foster interface-based design.  For example, the <br/>\n&gt;&gt; assembly of a few simple objects to perform a more complex <br/>\n&gt;&gt; task allows <br/>\n&gt;&gt; any of the objects to be mocked.  In turn, by refactoring designs to <br/>\n&gt;&gt; extract complex static relationships into interface-based <br/>\n&gt;&gt; compositions, <br/>\n&gt;&gt; the design becomes more open to extension, but closed to <br/>\n&gt;&gt; modification. <br/>\n&gt;&gt; So, I&#39;ll up the ante and claim that designs may change as a <br/>\n&gt;&gt; side effect <br/>\n&gt;&gt; of writing tests.  This is the essence of test-first design.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; Mike<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If these are indeed compex relationships then it may well be the case that<br/>\n&gt; refactoring the code is an appropriate course of action. Not all<br/>\n&gt; relationships *are* complex! In my experience it is better to keep the code<br/>\n&gt; simple where ever possible. I might understand what is going on - but my<br/>\n&gt; code maintanence successors may not.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Changing the code to suit your tests could quite easily cause your code to<br/>\n&gt; have a stitled and difficult to read style - especially to less experienced<br/>\n&gt; coders. My goal is always clarity in coding style. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Agreed - simplicity is paramount.  Toward that end, if through testing <br/>\nthe code a simpler design takes form, then all the better.  The point is <br/>\nthat testing may be the catalyst for rethinking the design, and <br/>\nrefactoring the code, to better serve the intended clients.  In other <br/>\nwords, there can be a positive feedback loop between design, coding, and <br/>\ntesting.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike<br/>\n-- <br/>\nMike Clark<br/>\nClarkware Consulting, Inc.<br/>\nCustom Software Architecture, Design,<br/>\nDevelopment, and Performance Consulting<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.clarkware.com\">http://www.clarkware.com</a></div>",
