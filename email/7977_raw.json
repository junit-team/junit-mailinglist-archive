If\n&gt; you think that is false, then please show us a test consistent with\n&gt; the contract of Object#equals that this implementation does not pass.\n\nOkay, java.util HashSets and TreeSets.\n\nAccording to the contract for the Equals method on the Set Interface, a\nSet is equal to another set if they are the same size, and both contain\nthe same objects.\n\nYour implementation would return false in this case if one set were a\nTreeSet and the other were a HashSet, as the class objects aren&#39;t\nequal.  \n\nWe could say that, in Bloch&#39;s original example with points, the real\nproblem is that the ColoredPoint is changing the contract of the equals\nmethod.  And, in fact, this is probably what he means by the &quot;add an\naspect&quot; portion of his statement &quot;There is simply no way to extend an\ninstantiable class and add an aspect while preserving the equals\ncontract.&quot;\n\n-Kevin\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nThe New Yahoo!
