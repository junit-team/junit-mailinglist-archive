You can mark each test class of particular\n  group either using a specific prefix (like GUITest) or use subclassing\n  or similar mechanics. Appropriate test suites can be created \n  automatically, basing on these marks (using either test class names \n  or reflection).\n  Using this approach, you won&#39;t forget to include specific tests\n  in to your test suites.\n\n  Just 2c.\n\n  With kind regards,\n  KIR\n\n-- \nKirill Maximov aka KIR\nkir@... | http://www.maxkir.com/\nSt.Petersburg, Russia\n\n\n",
