That should take care of the situation where \none collection is larger than the other. But, you bring up another \npoint. How can I tell how many times an element appears in a \ncollection, such as a map? If multiple elements hash to the same \nvalue is there a way to tell that their are multiple elements for \nthat hashvalue? The size() method will only tell me how many hash \nvalues there are. Not how many total elements.\n\n--- In junit@y..., &quot;J. B. Rainsberger&quot; &lt;jbr@d...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Thanks for the info. Actually, by the time I read your reply I \nhad \n&gt; &gt; already written something similar to the code you directed me to. \nI \n&gt; &gt; looped through one collection and then determined if each item in \nit \n&gt; &gt; was in the other collection using the &quot;contains&quot; method. Sounds \nlike \n&gt; &gt; JUnit could use another overloaded version of assertEquals.\n&gt; \n&gt; Careful: this only checks &quot;subcollection&quot;. You&#39;d have to do it in \neach \n&gt; direction *and* check size *and* check elements appearing multiple \ntimes, to \n&gt; be sure.\n&gt; \n&gt; --\n&gt; J. B.
