A patient came to him and said &quot;Doc, I have <br/>\nthese recurring headaches.&quot;  His response was &quot;Well, Tylenol works.&quot;  <br/>\nThe patient went off with the doctor&#39;s advice and, sure enough, his <br/>\nheadaches went away for a while.. but eventually the patient had to come <br/>\nback to the doctor for something far worse.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe desire to test private method is not something that you should <br/>\nignore, it&#39;s an indication that something else is wrong.  Using <br/>\nreflection to get at them is kind of like taking Tylenol without asking <br/>\nwhat else could be wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood design is easily testable.  If you can&#39;t write test without special <br/>\ntricks, it&#39;s time to go back to your design and ask: do I really have <br/>\ngood cohesion?  Or, why is my coupling so bad that testing is hard.<br/>\n<br/>\nMichael Feathers<br/>\nwww.objectmentor.com</div>",
