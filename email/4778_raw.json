These tests lean more towards being functional tests and \n&gt; rely on multiple failures being handled correctly. There have been \n&gt; several opinions on this list in support of multiple failures for \n&gt; functional tests. \n\nI like multiple failures when I&#39;m writing functional tests, too. \nThat&#39;s a different problem than what is solved by JUnit.\n \n&gt; What I would like to know is the reason TestCase inherits from \nAssert \n&gt; rather than delegates to it. If it delegated, we could subclass \n&gt; TestCase to handle multiple failures and still use Assert for DbC.\n\nHistory, in part. Assert and TestCase were once a single class. Then \nwe noticed that assert* and fail* didn&#39;t depend on any instance \nstate, so we could make them into their own class. By making them \nstatic we could make them easily accessible outside test cases \nwithout any cost within.\n\nCan you write up the behavior you&#39;d like to see as a test case? \nPerhaps it is possible to satisfy all constraints.\n\nKent\n\n\n",
