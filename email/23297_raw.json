I have mostly been using\nScalaTes=\r\nt and Midje. Today I felt that using JUnit with scala might\nnot be the wors=\r\nt idea. I feel that the scala tools are lacking in...\ninderstanding of the =\r\nTDD/BDD approach (which is just a feeling). Long\nstory short, I want to do =\r\nsomething like scalaTests pendingUntliFixed\nwhich basically makrs a failing=\r\n test as ignored until it stops failing\nwhere pendingUntilFixed will start =\r\nfailing the test saying that &quot;test\nwas marked as pending but did not throw =\r\nan exception&quot;  (so that you\nwill not accidentally leave pendingUntilFixed i=\r\nn for code tests that\nwork.\n\nI realized that this is very easy to do in JUn=\r\nit from scala. Something\nlike this:\n\n  def pendingUntilFixed(body: =3D&gt; Uni=\r\nt) =3D {\n    (try {\n      body\n      false\n    }\n    catch {\n      case e:T=\r\nhrowable =3D&gt; true\n    }) match {\n      case false =3D&gt; error(&quot;Test was mar=\r\nked as pending but did not fail&quot;)\n      case true =3D&gt; ()\n    }\n  }\n\n  @Tes=\r\nt\n  def someFailingTest =3D pendingUntilFixed {\n    assertThat(true, is(fal=\r\nse))\n  }\n\n  @Test\n  def someFixedTest =3D pendingUntilFixed {\n    assertTha=\r\nt(true, is(true))\n  }\n\n\nThe problem is that pending tests are marked as suc=\r\nceding when they\nfail. It would be cool if I could somehow mark them as Ign=\r\nored\ninstead. Is there some exception I could throe that would accomplish\nt=\r\nhis? I sort of thought that AssmptionError would be logical to be\ndisplayed=\r\n as ignored instead of succeeding hence the title.\n\nIdeas?\n----------------=\r\n-------------------------------------\nJoakim Ohlrogge\nAgical AB\nV=E4sterl=\r\n=E5nggatan 79, 2 tr\n111 29 Stockholm, SWEDEN\n\nMobile: +46-708-754004\nBlog: =\r\njohlrogge.wordpress.com\nE-mail: joakim.ohlrogge@...\n\n",
