We separate the test cases in an own package. Is that best <br/>\n&gt;practice?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There is debate on this. I feel that it is best to test classes through a public interface. Others believe that this leads to adding methods &quot;only for testing&quot;. To me, that generally means that a design change is required. I use the restrictions it places on me to improve my design.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;2. When doing this, some methods with default (package) visiblilty <br/>\n&gt;cannot be accessed. But when using the Reflection API, this methods <br/>\n&gt;can be accessed. Is it okay to use the reflection? Or is it bad <br/>\n&gt;style?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I consider it bad style to do so. I only test through public interfaces. If I need to make an interface element &quot;only for testing&quot;, then I look for the necessary design change.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;3. What about testing private methods? It is normally not possible <br/>\n&gt;if the test is in an own class. But again I can use the reflection <br/>\n&gt;to acess private methods. Should I do that? Or should I only test <br/>\n&gt;methods with public access?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If a private method might break, then that method is doing some useful, complex work. If it is so useful and complex, then that work belongs on a different object/class. In that case, the resulting change to the interface makes it public.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t use package-level visibility, even though perhaps I could.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have many private methods in a class, then those private methods are really a smaller class trying to get out of the larger class. This is my experience.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Maybe this question has been asked. But I have problems <br/>\n&gt;understanding the nature of the search results in this forum.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It is healthy to discuss them every so often.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJ. B.
