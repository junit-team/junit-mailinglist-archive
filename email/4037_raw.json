There are, of\ncourse, arguments both for and against both sides.\n\nFor JUnit: any form of testing is better than none (as well as many\nothers).\nAgainst JUnit: test cases are in a different class (even if it is in an\ninner class [*]) than the test subject.\n\nThe only solution that I can see would be to make testing (or assertion)\nan integral part of the language (ala Eiffel).  This would mean that\ntests (assertions) would be an integral part of a method definition.\n\nFor now, I&#39;ll stick with JUnit.\n\n---\n*.-  As I believe was pointed out in a previous post, inner class tests\nmay be just as unlikely to be updated than purpose built test classes\n\nManuel Amago.\nmailto:mamago@...\n\n\n",
