For user tests, it&#39;s essential to have\nall the components in place.  For developer tests, it&#39;s counter-productive:\nI want to understand what my code does independently of what services are\nprovided by third-party containers or servers, and I also want to run\ndeveloper tests often and fast.\n\nI think this is the same thing Vishal is saying below, but I wanted a chance\nto rephrase it a little.  Thanks,\n\n   David Saff\n\nOn 11/2/06, Vishal Vishnoi &lt;vvishnoi@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Use Cactus\n&gt; (http://jakarta.apache.org/cactus/writing/howto_testcase.html).  It&#39;s\n&gt; very easy to package you test and run them on server side. They also\n&gt; have documentation on how to test EJB  or any regular JUnit test in the\n&gt; container.\n&gt;\n&gt; For higher level testing (i.e testing like a customer),  if you need to\n&gt; verify something in container, then verify it in container. Don&#39;t try to\n&gt; run it outside, otherwise the whole purpose of testing is lost.\n&gt;\n&gt; --Vishal\n&gt;\n&gt; lenniedg2000 wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m using Eclipse 3.2, Orion application server, J2EE 5.0, Oracle\n&gt; &gt; database.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve written a jUnit test but it doesn&#39;t run since it doesn&#39;t run\n&gt; &gt; within the application server &quot;container&quot; and so can&#39;t find the\n&gt; &gt; database data-sources that I&#39;ve setup.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; How can I run jUnit unit tests inside an application server &quot;container&quot;?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Kind Regards,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Lennie De Villiers\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; _______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Notice:  This email message, together with any attachments, may contain\n&gt; information  of  BEA Systems,  Inc.,  its subsidiaries  and  affiliated\n&gt; entities,  that may be confidential,  proprietary,  copyrighted  and/or\n&gt; legally privileged, and is intended solely for the use of the individual\n&gt; or entity named in this message.
