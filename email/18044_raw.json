Imagine this test:\n&gt; \n&gt; Ob=\r\nject a =3D someReflectiveCall(&quot;abc&quot;);\n&gt; Object b =3D someOtherReflectiveCal=\r\nl(&quot;cba&quot;);\n&gt; assertEquals(a, b);\n&gt; \n&gt; To me, this asserts that a and b, what=\r\never they are, are equal\naccording \n&gt; to Java&#39;s definition of equal.  This =\r\ninvolves all sorts of weirdness \n&gt; that we might wish weren&#39;t so--if a and =\r\nb are StringBuffers with \n&gt; identical contents, they will not be equal, and=\r\n likewise if they are \n&gt; arrays with identical contents.\n&gt; \n&gt; If I know tha=\r\nt a and b are arrays, then writing\n&gt; \n&gt; assertEquals((Object[])a, (Object[]=\r\n)b);\n&gt; \n&gt; is not very burdensome, and has benefits in documenting the behav=\r\nior of \n&gt; the tested methods.  Does that make sense?\n&gt; \n&gt;     David Saff\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Jason Rogers wrote:\n&gt; &gt; That seems to make sense.  Two arrays will never=\r\n be equal objects\nif they\n&gt; &gt; aren=B9t the same object.  So, it would make =\r\nsense to compare their\ncontents.\n&gt; &gt; I tend to discourage RTTI, but in this=\r\n case I don=B9t think it=B9s a\nbad idea.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; My $0.02...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Jason\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; On 9/27/06 10:09 PM, &quot;putnam_david_t&quot; &lt;davidtputnam@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I see that Junit 4.1 has a new method for comparing arrays.  However=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; in my case the arrays are created via reflection. So the arrays are\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; declared as Object and the Object version of assertEquals does not\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n examine the array elements.  I suggested on the Junit issue tracker\n&gt; &gt;&gt; t=\r\nhat the Object version of assertEquals be ammended to check if the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; two=\r\n Objects are both arrays then act like the array version.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I am po=\r\nsting this here to see what other discussion this might\ngenerate.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n Looking forward to hearing from you.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; David\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
