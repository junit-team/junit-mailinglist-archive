If you read back across the \n  recent history of this -noloading phenom, you&#39;ll see people who are having \n  classloader issues are not confined to the org.w3c class. This beast is \n  popping up all over the place.</font></p>\n  <p><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">2. If someone wanted to masquerade as the poster \n  child for reasons people should avoid free software, you get the job. What is \n  it about some of the free-software folks out there who think that just because \n  they churned out a piece of code and shoved up onto a web page, that their \n  software does not have to be well designed, bug-free and taken just as \n  seriously as a piece of paid-for software?</font></p>\n  <p><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">3. I&#39;m as grateful as the next bloke to Erick and \n  Kent for JUnit. That said, I&#39;m hardly going to mute criticism where I feel \n  that criticism is warranted. Pointing this stuff out is how software gets \n  better. If Erick and Kent are as thin-skinned as you are, and I certainly hope \n  they are not, they&#39;ll take a gentle pointer to a bug trend in the spirit in \n  which it is offered.</font></p>\n  <p><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">4. The point here is not the typical free-software \n  red herring that usually goes something like &quot;how would you have done it \n  better?&quot;. The point is to fix something that is problematic and chronic. I&#39;m \n  sure if you take a deep breath and eat a donut, even you can see the \n  difference</font></p></blockquote></span></blockquote></html> \n</div>",
