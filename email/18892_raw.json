I anticipate\nthere will be a lot of automatic test generation tools\nout there soon, and that these will fit well with code\nstructured that way.\n\nI also find it valuable when someone says &quot;Well we\nhave to leave all that code untested because there&#39;s\nsooooo many private  methods&quot;.\n\nI either have to say &quot;OK - Go to JUnit&#39;s site and find\nthe how to test private methods reflector thingy&quot; or\nuse the Class, ClassHelper pattern.\n\nMy personal feeling is leaving method &quot;Simplicity&quot;\njudgement up to the developer can lead to &quot;Shortcuts&quot;\n:-)\n\nI think it&#39;s easier if an entire team of developers\nagrees to a certain pattern.  That way we know how to\nlook at other people&#39;s code.\n\nThat said I&#39;m also for having untested methods, as\nlong as it is generated code.\n\nSince the code is generated, to me it means that the\npattern that generated the code has already been\ntested, so that everything really is tested,  it&#39;s\njust that the test is tagged to the pattern and the\ncode generation template.\n\nCheers,\n- Ole\n\n\n\n--- Michael Feathers &lt;mfeathers@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Ole,\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t know that there any security risks to that\n&gt; approach.  \n&gt; Ultimately, security is more about who has access to\n&gt; your code rather \n&gt; than anything that you do to protect it; any runtime\n&gt; can be fiddled with. \n&gt; \n&gt; I would hesitate before using something like Class +\n&gt; ClassHelper as an \n&gt; architectural style.  It would be a shame to have to\n&gt; look at two things \n&gt; whenever you used to have to look at one. \n&gt; \n&gt; To me, the better thing is to notice when things are\n&gt; hard to test and \n&gt; then decide whether to break your classes down into\n&gt; pieces where \n&gt; operations can be public and whether, once public,\n&gt; they enable more in \n&gt; your code.  If you want to see an example of this,\n&gt; look at FIT \n&gt; (fit.c2.com).  I don&#39;t recall if it&#39;s that way now,\n&gt; but in the early \n&gt; versions all methods were either public or\n&gt; package-scope.  You have to \n&gt; make some serious tradeoffs when you adopt that\n&gt; style for API code, but \n&gt; in general it&#39;s a reasonable style for application\n&gt; (non-API) code.\n&gt; \n&gt; Michael Feathers\n&gt; www.objectmentor.com\n&gt; \n&gt; Ole Ersoy wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;Hi Guys,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Would it be a good idea to always use all public\n&gt; &gt;methods...?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;In the context of a convention where there is a\n&gt; &gt;&quot;MainClass&quot; and a &quot;MainClassHelper&quot; that has public\n&gt; &gt;methods used to help the MainClass.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Users of MainClassHelper (The collaborator should\n&gt; &gt;really be MainClass only) know that this class\n&gt; exists\n&gt; &gt;mainly for the purpose of helping MainClass, and\n&gt; all\n&gt; &gt;the methods are public, so that they can be easily\n&gt; &gt;unit tested.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Otherwise they would be private or protected\n&gt; members\n&gt; &gt;of MainClass.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;So MainClassHelper can really be thought of as a\n&gt; &gt;utility library that is specific to MainClass...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Anyone know if there are security risks to this,\n&gt; &gt;beside API risks?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Thanks,\n&gt; &gt;- Ole\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;____________________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt;Don&#39;t get soaked.
