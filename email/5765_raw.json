IllegalArgExc) ]\n&gt;&gt; You are correct, but I actually meant tha=\r\nt at runtime,\n&gt;&gt; my code does not know why your code threw an NPE.\n&gt;\n&gt;Jumpi=\r\nng in here on a point I haven&#39;t really understood in all this\n&gt;discussion:\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;I can see that it is at least somewhat useful for the human\n&gt;troubleshoo=\r\nter reading the stack trace to be able to see quickly\n&gt;that the problem is =\r\nan invalid argument, and not a surprising null\n&gt;somewhere in the guts of th=\r\ne method; this may well speed up the\n&gt;troubleshooting, and makes an argumen=\r\nt for throwing IllegalArgExc\n&gt;as a matter of style.\n&gt;\n&gt;But why would the ca=\r\nlling code care?  For example, why would it\n&gt;react differently to an Illega=\r\nlArgExc than to any random\n&gt;RuntimeException?\n\nGood question. I hope that I=\r\n can provide a good answer. The reason why my code would care about the typ=\r\ne of exception raised by the code that I have called is that there are some=\r\n exceptions that are non-terminal and that when received, my code will try =\r\nto do something about it. Let&#39;s try an example:\n\nAn IllegalArgumentExceptio=\r\nn means that I have messed up.\n\nA JDBC Connection exception might mean that=\r\n the database is down, and that if my code is patient and retries in a few =\r\nseconds, then everything may be connected again. (This is not unusual ... I=\r\n have found allowing for a number of retries to be a good thing when workin=\r\ng with both database connections and also messaging systems)\n\nA NullPointer=\r\nException means nothing to anybody&#39;s code. Did I pass a Null value, or did =\r\nthe code that I called mess up or did it call some other code and that mess=\r\ned up? Who knows!?\n\nAnd this is why my code cares about the exception that =\r\ncomes back. I can make programatic decisions based upon the exception that =\r\nis returned, if the exception that is returned is meaningfull.\n\nHope this h=\r\nelps.\n\nSimon\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n----\nSimon P.
