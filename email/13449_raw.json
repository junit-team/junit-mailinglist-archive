My tests are written for that\n&gt; API.  Now this is an API/SPI model.  Hence multiple implementation are\n&gt; made available for the SPI.  So what I wanted to do is to run the same\n&gt; set of tests on the same API but flipping the underlying SPI\n&gt; Implementation.  I wanted my test results to reflect this for\n&gt; different SPI implementation.\n\nWe have a similar situation for part of Jena. There is a Graph \ninterface, and several Graph implementations (one [actually three, \nbut two aren&#39;t part of the public interface) in memory, one in an RDB, \none in BDB JE). Each one should satisfy the Graph tests. So, following\nthe model suggested elsewhere, we have an abstract base class with the \ntests in, with a method getGraph() which supplies the Graph to test, \nand subclasses of the abstract class which override getGraph() to\ndeliver an appropriate implementation. \n\nIt works pretty well.\n\nThe subclasses can also have specialised tests. EG, a Graph is a set\nof (S, P, O) triples. There&#39;s a generalised find(S, P, O) operation,\nwhere S/P/O can be wildcards. Memory graphs have indexes which allow\nqueries to be directed to an index rather than doing a general search.\nA specialised test for GraphMem ensures that the special-cased queries\ndon&#39;t use the default implementation of find(). \n\n-- \nChris &quot;electric hedgehog&quot; Dollin\n&quot;The compiler is free to insert padding because it makes the struct \nlook bigger and scares away predators.&quot; [Keith Thompson, comp.lang.c]\n\n\n",
