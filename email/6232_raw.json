As such, I&#39;m presented with a fairly unique opportunity to\n&gt; &gt;establish some standard practices for unit testing.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;A few things are obvious. Yes, writing unit tests for all new code\n&gt; &gt;should be STRONGLY ENCOURAGED. Yes, the JUnit framework is what we\n&gt; &gt;will use for launching our tests. \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Some are less obvious, but I&#39;m still clear on what to do. For \ninstance,\n&gt; &gt;writing tests that include the database are often QUITE difficult. \nNot\n&gt; &gt;everyone has a copy of Oracle; we can&#39;t just erase tables willy-\nnilly\n&gt; &gt;to set up for each test; etc. So I will use mock objects (hopefully\n&gt; &gt;starting from those at www.mockobjects.com) to simulate the \nconnection,\n&gt; &gt;and other &quot;external&quot; data sources/sinks.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;And there are a few questions on which I&#39;d like to hear input from\n&gt; &gt;some with more experience so I can start out using &quot;Best Practices&quot;\n&gt; &gt;instead of having to learn from my OWN experience.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;QUESTION 1:\n&gt; &gt;   Where do my JUnit unit tests go?\n&gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt;   I see 3 likely answers... (a) make each an inner class of the\n&gt; &gt;   class being tested, (b) for every class &quot;Foo&quot; have a class \ncalled \n&gt; &gt;   &quot;TestFoo&quot; in the same package, or (c) have a separate (but \nparallel\n&gt; &gt;   hierarchy of classes... SOURCE/com/pkg/Foo.java is tested by \n&gt; &gt;   TEST/com/pkg/TestFoo.java.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   I lean towards (c) because it makes it easy to build the &quot;real&quot; \ncode\n&gt; &gt;   and the &quot;test&quot; code separately, and omit the &quot;test&quot; code from\n&gt; &gt;   production deployment. Are there other significant issues here?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;QUESTION 2:\n&gt; &gt;   How do I automatically build the suite of all tests?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   For each class, I can have several methods called &quot;testXxx()&quot; \nand\n&gt; &gt;   can collect them into a suite to run at once. I can collect the\n&gt; &gt;   suites together into larger suites, eventually coalescing into a\n&gt; &gt;   suite called &quot;RunAllTests&quot; which does just that. But this \nrequires\n&gt; &gt;   me to write each of these suites, and to remember to include \neach\n&gt; &gt;   and every test class. I&#39;d rather if &quot;RunAllTests&quot; just magically\n&gt; &gt;   found all of the tests... that way I couldn&#39;t forget to include\n&gt; &gt;   one and wind up with some tests that never get run just because \nI\n&gt; &gt;   forgot a line in a suite. How do I create this &quot;magical&quot; \n&gt; &gt;   RunAllTests?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   Stray thought... if there&#39;s no simple solution in straight java,\n&gt; &gt;   I wonder if ant can help me to achieve RunAllTests as an ant\n&gt; &gt;   target?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;QUESTION 3:\n&gt; &gt;   How do I &quot;turn on&quot; my mock objects when tests are running?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   The most straightforward use of mock objects is to pass them\n&gt; &gt;   directly to the code being tested. However, (despite the fact \nthat\n&gt; &gt;   this is a bit broader than simply &quot;unit&quot; testing), I plan to \nhave\n&gt; &gt;   a lot of tests that exercise an entire sub-system at once. For\n&gt; &gt;   example, I might create the input file, run the command, and \nthen\n&gt; &gt;   test the output file. But if this &quot;command&quot; opens a connection \nto\n&gt; &gt;   a database (or other system), then I&#39;d like to return a mock\n&gt; &gt;   ResultSet instead of a real one. So the code that obtains a DB\n&gt; &gt;   connection has to look at some global setting to see if we&#39;re in\n&gt; &gt;   &quot;test mode&quot; or &quot;real life&quot;. What is a good way to achieve this -\n-\n&gt; &gt;   is it something I&#39;ll have to write for myself?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll have more questions also, but this email is QUITE \nlong\n&gt; &gt;enough as is. Thanks in advance for any feedback, suggestions, or\n&gt; &gt;pointers to other forums/FAQs for this kind of stuff.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;-- Michael Chermside\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; &gt;junit-unsubscribe@y...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Your use of Yahoo!
