(Also: What does it mean to author them? Do you\nmean write?)\n&lt;mdt&gt; Is there a recommendation for a better term (than &quot;hard-coded&quot;) to\ndescribe unit tests only useful in a single context?  (ex. non-generalizable\ntest, explicit-method test)\n\nThe text has been revised including parenthetical notation:\nWriting hard-coded (single context) tests leads to ... blah blah\n&lt;/mdt&gt;\n\nWhy is the volume of test code a challenge?\n&lt;mdt&gt; Ahh ... this question has significant significance.  :-)\n\n3,000 mm of seasonal rainfall would create havoc for a Kansas (USA) farmer,\nyet the same volume works well for the rice-growing regions of Maharashtra\n(India).  So, is 3,000 mm of rain a &quot;problem&quot;???\n\nMy personal usage (pattern) of the &quot;J2EE Core Patterns&quot; begins with problem\nperception; if a circumstance is perceived as a problem - the pattern is a\nproposed solution.\n\nMy observation is that folks concerned about the &quot;volume&quot; of test code are\ntranslating the observation into &quot;complexity&quot;, &quot;cost&quot;, &quot;management\nchallenge&quot; or perhaps general &quot;fear uncertainty and doubt&quot; (FUD) that this\nTest Driven Development stuff is somehow just another veiled strategy for IT\nto &quot;stick-it&quot; to the business community (remember Y2K -or- Client-Server\nComputing  -or- EJB 1.0?).\n&lt;/mdt&gt; \n\nSame for effort -- why do you relate the effort on test code to the effort \non production code? Effort on test code pays back in less defects and \nclearer design and other things. Would you also complain about spending \nmore effort on e.g. design or documentation than on production code?\n\n&lt;mdt&gt; Actually, I do complain when documentation effort exceeds product\neffort; it is a Project Management &quot;smell&quot; that priorities are misaligned. \nDocumentation exists to expedite getting code in production - it should be\n&quot;just enough&quot; to add velocity to the process.\n\nThe TDD community needs to remain vigilant against zealots among us that\nforget the practice exists for &quot;expediting&quot; (good design, defect\nidentification etc. etc.) ... not as an end to itself.  AMT addresses those\nthat perceive the TDD exercise is creating more &quot;effort&quot; than return on\ninvestment.\n\nIf one is content with current TDD practices and determines additional\noptimization provides limited value - there is no need to pursue AMT. \n&lt;/mdt&gt;\n\nWhat is the complexity in launching unit tests?\n&lt;mdt&gt; Good catch!\n\nThe text now reads:\nYou want to lower the complexity threshold so developers self-select to\nauthor unit tests.\n&lt;/mdt&gt;\n\nWhat are patterned objects?\n&lt;mdt&gt;Objects that follow a pattern - not merely the language syntax.  Is\nthere a better way to express this?  (examples = Business Objects,\nApplication Service Objects, Front Controller Objects etc.)\n&lt;/mdt&gt;\n\nWhat are unique test maintenance points?\n&lt;mdt&gt;Does this work better?\n\n* Increases method reuse within the test code base.\n&lt;/mdt&gt;\n\nWhy is it a good thing if the &quot;need for a shared understanding of \npatterned object implementation definitions&quot; (whatever that is) is \nincreased?\n&lt;mdt&gt; The &quot;J2EE Core Patterns&quot; format lists &#39;Side Effect&#39; as neither good or\nbad ... actually, this is a &quot;caution&quot; for those using AMT the first time.\n\nText changed to:\n* Increases the need for a consistent and detailed understanding of pattern\ndefinitions among team members.\n&lt;/mdt&gt;\n\nSure one can reflectively gather all setters and getters and call them.\nHowever, what is really gained from that?\n&lt;mdt&gt; http://gtcgroup.com/util/TestUtil.By.Example.html &lt;/mdt&gt;\n\nAlso, I cannot imagine how this should work for anything serious.\n&lt;mdt&gt;  This is a real dilemma for me in explaining AMT.  I use the\ngetter/setter firing as an example since most folks understand the JavaBean\nspecification.  At Ford Motor Company, one of our higher-order AMT base test\ncase methods  enabled firing all CRUD operations against a DAO with a single\nline of test code.  The generalized test code managed transactions, verified\nif the record existed, created Business Objects as required,\ncreated/committed a new record, modified and then deleted the record etc.\n\nMaybe I&#39;m being lazy and not articulating the full potential of AMT by using\nonly the TestUtil reference implementation as an example?  The AMT work done\nat Ford is *not* public; however, the SOAj project will have additional\nexamples and higher order AMT - by the August timeframe.    \n&lt;/amt&gt;\n\nLast but not least I don&#39;t see why you call this a pattern. It does not \nseem to share a lot with patterns as described by Gamma et al -- your AMT \ndoes not even involve code, besides naming conventions?\n&lt;mdt&gt;It appears the Wikipedia definition speaks to the notion that a &quot;set of\nrules&quot; can be enough to constitute a &quot;pattern&quot;.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern\n&lt;/mdt&gt;\n\nSorry, I don&#39;t see how this &quot;pattern&quot; is useful at all.\n&lt;mdt&gt; Appreciate the candor ... sounds like I need to keep working toward\narticulating a compelling case for individuals to give it a try before\nmaking a final determination.&lt;/mdt&gt;\n\n\nCheers,\nRobert\n\n-- \nView this message in context: http://www.nabble.com/Automated-Method-Testing-%28AMT%29-Pattern-tf3669566.html#a10321160\nSent from the JUnit - User mailing list archive at Nabble.com.\n\n\n",
