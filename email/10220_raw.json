However, I&#39;m seeing that all the examples deal with a single\nset of data and a single test method.\n\nTake your example below.  You pass 4 parameters to the constructor of\nyour test class and then execute testReturnValues for the number of\nfixtures you&#39;ve set up (5 in the example).\n\nNow take my example below.  I have 3 distinct test methods.   Each of\nthe 3 methods requires a different set of parameters.  Based on what\nI&#39;m understanding of the parameterized test case, I would need to\nwrite 3 different constructors for my test class?  Am I correct in this?\n\nObviously my example below is very basic, by most of our classes\nunfortunately has dozens and dozens of methods, each requiring their\nown unique set of data.\n\nIf my question is correct, then to me, the amount of code needed to\nutilize the parameterized test case is just as much, if not more, then\nsimply keeping the code as shown below, but maybe creating a private\nmethod that makes the actual call.\n\n\nclass MyClassTest extends TestCase {\n RealClass realClase;\n\n public MyClassTest(String testCaseName) {\n   super(testCaseName);\n }\n\n public void setUp() throws Exception {\n   realClass = new RealClass();\n   // Do some setup\n }\n\n public testGetStuff() {\n    realClass.getStuff(param1, param2);\n    // Do your asserts, etc.\n }\n\n public testUpdateStuff() {\n    realClass.getStuff(param1, param2, param3);\n    // Do your asserts, etc.\n }\n\n public testDeleteStuff() {\n    realClass.getStuff(param1, param2, param3, param4);\n    // Do your asserts, etc.\n }\n\n- DS\n\n\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;J. B. Rainsberger&quot; &lt;jbrains@r...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Well, folks... I was suitably motivated to write it, at last: a \n&gt; Universal Parameterized Test Suite. This is a suite that allows you to \n&gt; implement the Parameterized Test Case without having to override \n&gt; runTest(). It therefore takes a collection of fixture objects, collects \n&gt; all the test methods in your TestCase class and build the default test \n&gt; suite with each fixture.\n&gt; \n&gt; So if you have a TestCase with five tests and ten different fixtures, \n&gt; you get a suite with 50 tests. Get it?\n&gt; \n&gt; There are some refactorings the JUnit sorely needs to improve the \n&gt; parameterized test suite&#39;s design -- most notably, TestSuite has too \n&gt; many responsiblities: it is both a test suite factory and the test\nsuite \n&gt; itself. If we could extract the factory then ParameterizedTestSuite \n&gt; would be easier to implement and use.\n&gt; \n&gt; How do you use it?\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. Add a constructor to your TestCase class to accept your fixture data \n&gt; from the outside. This replaces setUp().\n&gt; \n&gt; 2. Add the method setFixture() taking an instance of your TestCase as \n&gt; the parameter. Implement it to stash the parameter&#39;s fixture.\n&gt; \n&gt; 3. Override getName() so that you can report the fixture name /and/ the \n&gt; test name. (TestSuite&#39;s schizophrenic design makes this the lesser of \n&gt; two evil duplications.)\n&gt; \n&gt; Now you create a ParameterizedTestSuite like so:\n&gt; \n&gt;      public static Test suite() {\n&gt;          return new ParameterizedTestSuite(\n&gt;              Arrays.asList(\n&gt;                  new Object[] {\n&gt;                      new StringCompareToTest(&quot;Same length&quot;, &quot;abc&quot;, \n&gt; &quot;abd&quot;, &quot;abe&quot;),\n&gt;                      new StringCompareToTest(&quot;Empty string&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;abd&quot;, \n&gt; &quot;abe&quot;),\n&gt;                      new StringCompareToTest(&quot;Different lengths&quot;,\n&quot;abc&quot;, \n&gt; &quot;abcd&quot;, &quot;abcde&quot;),\n&gt;                      new StringCompareToTest(&quot;Spaces&quot;, &quot;abc&quot;, &quot;abc &quot;, \n&gt; &quot;abc  &quot;),\n&gt;                      new StringCompareToTest(&quot;Failing on purpose&quot;, \n&gt; &quot;abc&quot;, &quot;abf&quot;, &quot;abe&quot;)}));\n&gt;      }\n&gt; \n&gt; These are String comparability tests, extending JUnit-addons&#39; \n&gt; ComparabilityTestCase. Each fixture has a name, then its data. Notice \n&gt; that the last fixture is wrong: it expects &quot;abf&quot; to be less than &quot;abe&quot;, \n&gt; but it is not. Here is the failure list.\n&gt; \n&gt; Failing on \n&gt; purpose/testReturnValues(junit.cookbook.addons.test.StringCompareToTest)\n&gt; \n&gt; Notice the fixture name is part of the test name. This is what you get \n&gt; for overriding getName().\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m about to write this up (in JUnit Cookbook) and I will post the \n&gt; corresponding recipes (to the junit-cookbook group only) for review. I \n&gt; will be releasing ParameterizedTestSuite as part of Diasparsoft Toolkit \n&gt; 1.0, whenever /that/ finally happens. :)\n&gt; -- \n&gt; J. B.
