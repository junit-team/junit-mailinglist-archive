We have a lot of business logic in our database<br/>\n&gt; and it makes testing difficult because mocking the database would require<br/>\n&gt; re-implementing the logic in Java.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Unfortunately, I don&#39;t have control over this. For the most part<br/>\nwe don&#39;t have much business logic in the DB, but I&#39;m not empowered<br/>\nto change any of this if I wanted to.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; We coded up a TestSuite that finds all the tests in the project (which is<br/>\n&gt; pretty fast because they all start with &quot;_&quot; so we don&#39;t have to use<br/>\n&gt; &quot;instanceof&quot; to figure out if they are tests or not) and executes them.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We also threw in some fun options like only running tests in certain<br/>\n&gt; packages and running the tests in order of their execution speed (we have<br/>\n&gt; some really slow tests, which I know is bad, but there&#39;s not too much we<br/>\n&gt; can do about it).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It can also run just those tests that have been compiled in the last 10<br/>\n&gt; minutes plus tests for any classes that have been compiled in the last 10<br/>\n&gt; minutes. (So if you modify method A.foo() and class B calls A.foo(), then<br/>\n&gt; _ATest and _BTest will be executed.) This is to get around the problem of<br/>\n&gt; our test suite being really slow, which is something that I want to fix<br/>\n&gt; but cannot (for non-technical reasons).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>WOW!!! That sounds much better than the other utilities I&#39;ve been<br/>\nable to find for this, and certainly more feature-rich than I&#39;d have<br/>\ntime to write myself. Any chance that the TestSuite you write would<br/>\nbe available?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, thanks for the feedback!<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Michael Chermside</div>",
