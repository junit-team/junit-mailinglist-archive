Well, writing\none that exposes it isn&#39;t hard.  How do you expose it with out the test\nhanging?\n\nThe only solution I can see is to use two threads, and set a maximum time\nfor the test to run.  While I&#39;ve done it before, I really hate putting a\ntime-limit specific tests, as every system behaves differently, and they\nbehave differently at different times (it&#39;s that non-deterministic thing\nthat I didn&#39;t understand in college :)\n\nThanks for any input....\n\nDavid Corbin\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp\n\n\n",
