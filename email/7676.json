Specifically, a<br/>\nstatic inner class does not have any reference to an enclosing instance.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe example the book gives is:<br/>\n<br/>\npublic class MyOuter {<br/>\n  public static class MyInner {<br/>\n  }<br/>\n  public static void main(String[] args) {<br/>\n    MyInner aMyInner = new MyOuter.MyInner();<br/>\n  }<br/>\n}<br/>\n<br/>\nAn inner class most definately does NOT need to be bound to an outer class<br/>\nas is proved by the code snippet above.  It is true that a non-static inner<br/>\nclass DOES need to be bound to an enclosing class though.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor less information in a more confused manner see the Java Language<br/>\nSpecification 2nd edition section 8.1.2.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Phil<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n                                                                                                      <br/>\n                      Scott Palmer                                                                    <br/>\n                      &lt;scott.palmer@2con         To:      <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>                       <br/>\n                      nected.org&gt;                cc:                                                  <br/>\n                                                 Subject: [junit] Re: What&#39;s wrong with using inner   <br/>\n                      04/10/03 08:55 AM          classes for tests?                                   <br/>\n                      Please respond to                                                               <br/>\n                      junit                                                                           <br/>\n                                                                                                      <br/>\n                                                                                                      <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI just thought I would point out that (at least according to some)<br/>\nthere is no such thing as a &#39;static inner class&#39;.  An &#39;inner&#39; class<br/>\nMUST be bound to an instance of the outer class, and thus can&#39;t be<br/>\nstatic.  What you are talking about here I think is referred to as a<br/>\n&#39;nested&#39; class.  Which is declared exactly like you would expect a<br/>\n&#39;static inner class&#39; to be declared if that&#39;s what it was called:-).  I<br/>\nremember hearing the term &#39;top level nested class&#39;  I think it was in<br/>\nan article on jRoundup.com.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know, not exactly relevant to the discussion.. I&#39;ll get back to work<br/>\n:-)<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t recall anyone mentioning that if for some reason you need<br/>\naccess to a private member to do your test. E.g. to verify internal<br/>\nstate of your object that is not easily verifiable via public or<br/>\nprotected methods, then a inner class would help.  I&#39;m new to Unit<br/>\nTesting so there is probably something else that is wrong with that<br/>\n:-).  It seems that there are occasionally valid reasons to do that<br/>\nthough.<br/>\n<br/>\nScott<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Wednesday, April 9, 2003, at 04:25 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Are static inner classes actually a member variable...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!
