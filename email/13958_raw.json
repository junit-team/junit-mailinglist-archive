I agree with the desire to reduce the public\nfootprint of systems. Packages inheriting access will help reduce the number\nof program elements that need to be declared public. When the time comes, we\nwill support non-public test classes and methods.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nKent Beck\nThree Rivers Institute \n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On \n&gt; Behalf Of Elliotte Harold\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, June 16, 2005 7:05 PM\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: Re: [junit] JUnit 4 and public classes\n&gt; \n&gt; Kent Beck wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; We don&#39;t plan to make that possible. I would like to know in what\n&gt; &gt; circumstances non-public test classes and methods would be valuable.\n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s not a big deal. It&#39;s mostly just that I like to have a \n&gt; really clear \n&gt; distinction between public (and protected) interfaces and non-public \n&gt; interfaces in my libraries. Public interfaces can be counted on and \n&gt; relied on, won&#39;t change without a deprecation cycle, must be \n&gt; documented \n&gt; in JavaDoc, and so forth. Non-public methods/classes don&#39;t need to be.\n&gt; \n&gt; Mostly it just offends my sense of programming aesthetics to have all \n&gt; these public classes and interfaces that aren&#39;t really part of the \n&gt; published interfaces. Practically it means I have to do extra work to \n&gt; make sure they don&#39;t show up in JavaDoc; don&#39;t get tested as \n&gt; public by \n&gt; static code checking tools, and the like. Bottom line: test \n&gt; classes are \n&gt; for the developers; not the public. I think most developers \n&gt; pretty much \n&gt; know they can&#39;t count on the interface to any test case. However, I&#39;d \n&gt; still like to enforce that if I could.\n&gt; \n&gt; Going forward in Java 1.6/1.7, I expect this to be a bigger issue. It \n&gt; should soon become possible for subpackages to see the \n&gt; package protected \n&gt; parts of their super packages. Once that happens, there&#39;ll be \n&gt; much less \n&gt; tendency to make everything public and to distinguish between \n&gt; public and \n&gt; published interfaces. The less we have to put in public the better.\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; Elliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\n&gt; XML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!\n&gt; http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/\n&gt; http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/\nref=nosim\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo!
