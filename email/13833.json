For example, the JUnit Web page seems to have had few <br/>\nupdates since 2003. And on SourceForge, Erich Gamma and Kent Beck <br/>\nresponded to some GUI-related RFEs with the comment that because most <br/>\nIDEs now handle test running themselves, there&#39;s no point to improving <br/>\nJUnit&#39;s own GUI tools. Non-interface bug reports and RFEs have gone <br/>\nunassigned unless they&#39;re of very high priority (such as ones related to <br/>\nthread safety). Is there simply no real demand for improvements, or has <br/>\nthe SourceForge bug report page been deprecated?</div>",
