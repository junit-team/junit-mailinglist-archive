I recommend you google a paper by Kent Beck with\n&gt; the keywords &quot;smalltalk testing patterns&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt;   &gt;  Does using JUnits provide any extra feature or additional functionality\n&gt;   &gt;  over this way of testing,i.e, declaring main() methods and testing?\n&gt;\n&gt; JUnit provides framework extension points for common testing features,\n&gt; such as setting up objects before each test, resetting objects after\n&gt; each test, and executing the same test with multiple inputs and expected\n&gt; outputs. JUnit also works well with several IDEs which can help you\n&gt; monitor your progress as you write and pass tests.\n\nYou can also easily exclude or include tests using profiles in maven, if \nyou happen to use maven as a build tool.  You would need to write code \nfor this if you did not use JUnit.\n\nI think of JUnit as main() with extra features.  JUnit doesn&#39;t do the \ntesting for you, it just facilitates a more uniform test structure for \nALL tests.\n\n-- \nTrenton D.
