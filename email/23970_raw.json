Tha=\r\nnks for prodding me on this\nfact--I have an idea of how we might be able to=\r\n bootstrap something fairly\nquickly on this.\n\n2) I _hope_ that JUnit&#39;s simp=\r\nlicity hasn&#39;t disappeared.  I may be living in\na filter bubble, but my feel=\r\ning is that the things that should be easy have\nstayed easy.  Much of the m=\r\nore esoteric discussion on this list is around\nmaking some hard things poss=\r\nible.  That is, 99% of JUnit users just use\nJUnit, and don&#39;t participate in=\r\n the &quot;community&quot;, per se.  80% of the\ndiscussion on this list tends to be a=\r\nround the work of the other 1% of\nextenders and developers.\n\nDefinitely cur=\r\nious to hear feedback on this angle.  Thanks,\n\n   David Saff\n\n\nOn Tue, Sep =\r\n4, 2012 at 10:57 AM, Michael Feher &lt;mfeher00@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; **\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nHi,\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m glad someone else spoke up.  Though I&#39;m a very infrequent user =\r\nof\n&gt; JUnit, I must confess that getting the daily emails about the enhanced=\r\n\n&gt; capabilities of JUnit these days has shown a possibly powerful tool that=\r\n&#39;s\n&gt; become a little byzantine for the casual user to be able to work with.=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; One thing I haven&#39;t seen is something that bridges the knowledge gap.\n=\r\n&gt; What I mean is, JUnit&#39;s been around for many years now, but to my\n&gt; knowl=\r\nedge, outside of this group, there&#39;s still only two useful websites\n&gt; and e=\r\nven those (at last check) don&#39;t seem as comprehensive as they could be\n&gt; (c=\r\nomparing it to something like the Java SE API, for example).  So there&#39;s\n&gt; =\r\nall this esoterica being discussed here, and the websites look like they\n&gt; =\r\nhaven&#39;t been updated in years.  There&#39;s a gap there.  I find myself getting=\r\n\n&gt; lost in casually following these discussions thinking, &quot;What if you just=\r\n\n&gt; want to run a test class to unit-test an application class?  What is all=\r\n\n&gt; this fancy stuff going on now and these different strange names and\n&gt; ap=\r\nplications people are using?&quot;  I&#39;ve done enough non-JUnit unit testing to\n&gt;=\r\n know how the tool should be useable for those applications, but I am\n&gt; def=\r\ninitely lost when it comes to TestRunners and all this other stuff I&#39;ve\n&gt; s=\r\neen.\n&gt;\n&gt; This isn&#39;t really a complaint so much as an observation.  Thanks f=\r\nor\n&gt; reading.\n&gt;\n&gt; Mike\n&gt;\n&gt; ________________________________\n&gt; From: Anuj &lt;a=\r\nnujkumar1516@...&gt;\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, Sept=\r\nember 4, 2012 5:03 AM\n&gt; Subject: [junit] Re: Feedback Required | Extending =\r\nJunit to perform Data\n&gt; Driven Testing\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Teemu,\n&gt; I think I shar=\r\ne the feelings with you that JUnits simplicity was its\n&gt; winning edge. A si=\r\nmple @Test annotation with a simple @RunWith did a lot of\n&gt; things for us f=\r\nor a long time. Although in the same breath I would also\n&gt; like to state th=\r\ne fact that the things around us change constantly. IMHO,\n&gt; during the cons=\r\ntant changes, we should be able to hold on to the simple\n&gt; things and build=\r\n on top of that to accommodate the changing requirements.\n&gt; There is a grea=\r\nt need in the IT world currently to do data driven testing\n&gt; such that the =\r\ndata is not coupled with the test. The main benefit it gives\n&gt; is the abili=\r\nty to control data and test separately, which results in less\n&gt; coupling an=\r\nd ultimately better maintenance.\n&gt;\n&gt; EasyTest is trying to achieve exactly =\r\nthat by extending JUnit in a way\n&gt; that its simplicity is conserved(EasyTes=\r\nt works with @Test annotations) and\n&gt; at the same time users have the abili=\r\nty to specify the data outside of\n&gt; their test classes.\n&gt;\n&gt; Do have a look =\r\nat EasyTest and share your thoughts with us. Its always\n&gt; good to get feedb=\r\nack from the people who have experience in the related\n&gt; field. Here&#39;s Easy=\r\nTest for your reference:\n&gt; https://github.com/EaseTech/easytest\n&gt;\n&gt; Cheers!=\r\n\n&gt; Anuj\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In junit@yahoogroups.com, Teemu Kanstr=E9n &lt;tkanstren@...&gt; =\r\nwrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi all,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Maybe I am a bit off topic, but I think JUni=\r\nt used to be really nice when\n&gt; &gt; you looked it up and it was so simple to =\r\nuse and understand. Now you get\n&gt; &gt; these rules, theories, runners, and all=\r\n kinds of strange things. They are\n&gt; &gt; nice for anyone needing to extend JU=\r\nnit to integrate with something\n&gt; &gt; external but I wish the user never need=\r\ns to see the stuff..\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I like the basic use of annotations in JUnit 4=\r\n but I prefer to have any\n&gt; &gt; more complex stuff written in the code and no=\r\nt in the annotations.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Of course, it is nice to have the option and =\r\nsupport those who like a\n&gt; &gt; different type of an approach.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Just sa=\r\nying... :)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Teemu\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this message hav=\r\ne been removed]\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been remove=\r\nd]\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
