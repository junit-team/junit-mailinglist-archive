Then you can override it in the Square class <br/>\n&gt;(so that Y is stretched too with the factor). <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You can, but I wouldn&#39;t. &quot;stretchX&quot; is not a defined operation for a Square. If &quot;stretchX&quot; *also* stretches in the Y direction, then the name is wrong, which really means that such an operation does not exist.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou could add &quot;stretch(factor)&quot; to both -- a method that stretches in both directions at once -- but &quot;stretchX(factor)&quot; can only be added to Rectangle. At that point, a Square is no longer a Rectangle and I would introduce the common base class Quadrilateral for both.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;3. How does a solution look like with value semantics? I&#39;m not sure <br/>\n&gt;if I translated the word correctly.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think of Value Object: an object that represents a value. The key common behavior of value Objects is that equals() is implemented to answer true for objects that represent the same value, rather than the normal &quot;identity by reference&quot; semantics, but I cannot say that that is what Johannes meant.
