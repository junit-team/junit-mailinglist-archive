[...]<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  [...]<br/>\n<br/>\nI was thinking much the same thing, but unless there&#39;s something<br/>\nI&#39;m missing in Ant (certainly possible), this technique is too<br/>\ncumbersome for fine-grained incremental testing.<br/>\n<br/>\nSuppose, for concreteness, that I have a test class FooTests,<br/>\nwhich tests a class Foo.  I want FooTests to run only if either<br/>\nFooTests.java or Foo.java has changed since the last time it was<br/>\nrun, so I write (1) a target which uses &lt;junit&gt; to run FooTests<br/>\nand touches a timestamp file to record when the test was run, and<br/>\n(2) a target which uses &lt;uptodate&gt; to compare the timestamps of<br/>\nthe timestamp file and the sources, setting a property<br/>\nFooTest.do-run-run if the sources have changed.  Target 1 depends<br/>\non target 2 and has attribute if=&#39;FooTest.do-run-run&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll good so far.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe next day, I write some more classes Foo1, Foo2, ..., Foo46,<br/>\nand their tests Foo1Test, Foo2Test, ..., Foo46Test.  (I was on<br/>\nvacation in Minsk the day of that seminar on naming classes<br/>\nmeaningfully.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI want each test to run only if it or its corresponding source<br/>\nfile has changed, so... I add &lt;uptodate&gt; and &lt;junit&gt; targets for<br/>\neach of the forty-six new classes, each pair controlling its<br/>\nbehaviour with a FooNTest.do-run-run property.  That&#39;s ninety-four<br/>\ntargets altogether.<br/>\n<br/>\nEither of the following additions to Ant would make it possible to<br/>\nstate the desired behaviour tersely:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. A version of &lt;fileset&gt; which lets us say &quot;omit from the set<br/>\nthose files which are newer than their corresponding file under<br/>\nthis &lt;mapper&gt;&quot;.  (Properly done, this involves implementing a<br/>\nfairly general algebra on sets of file names.)<br/>\n<br/>\n2. A looping construction, that is, a way to say &quot;for every file x<br/>\nin this &lt;fileset&gt;, execute task y with property z set to &#39;x&#39;&quot;. <br/>\n(In the case at hand, the task would be an &lt;antcall&gt; to the<br/>\n&lt;junit&gt; task.)<br/>\n<br/>\nOn reflection, it seems a bit odd that these kinds of facilities<br/>\naren&#39;t already in Ant.  Am I missing something?<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nSteven Taschuk           |   7&#92; 7&#39;Z {&~         .
