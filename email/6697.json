Rainsberger&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jbr@...\">jbr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m not sure why writing the test before the stub provides more<br/>\n&gt; documentation than writing the stub before the test.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>All this is about &quot;tests documenting the intentions behind the code&quot;.<br/>\nWhat I ment by &quot;documenting aspect&quot; does not depend on which <br/>\ncomes first, but if tests and app are in sync. To keep them in sync<br/>\nis much more easy, if one is the base for generating the other.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe difference (whether or not there is a strong and visible<br/>\nrealation) is, how easy one can understand the intention <br/>\nbehind certain app code. If one organizes tests similar to <br/>\nthe behavioral requirements (instead of following the app <br/>\nstructure), one sure makes a lot of progress during initial<br/>\ndevelopment. Because we are writing object oriented software,<br/>\nbehavior and methods are not very far away from each other.<br/>\n<br/>\nOver time, the application gets refactored. Changes of <br/>\nmethod names or signatures are likely to be the most <br/>\nfrequent ones. But often tests stay as they are as long <br/>\nas the bar is green. The structural differences between <br/>\ntests and application are growing.<br/>\n<br/>\nImagine you want to add some new feature to an application <br/>\nwith this kind of tests in three years from now. You need to <br/>\nmodify some code and maybe you need to use some <br/>\nexisting code too. Then you want to understand, what the <br/>\nintention behind those portions of code was. You want to <br/>\nunderstand the methods you are about to modify/use.<br/>\nYes, you can search the tests for uses of those method.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I want to get an idea, what the method &quot;xyz&quot; is <br/>\nsupposed to do, I prefer to look at &quot;testXyz&quot;. That is what<br/>\nI ment with the &quot;documenting aspect&quot; of tests that follow<br/>\nthe structure of the application.<br/>\n<br/>\nJUnitDoclet allows re-generating, so it&#39;s not much work <br/>\nto keep tests and app in sync.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Also, if you haven&#39;t written the test, then how can you be sure that<br/>\n&gt; the stub:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 1. ...has the proper signature?<br/>\n&gt; 2. ...is named well?<br/>\n&gt; 3. ...should be class- or instance-level?<br/>\n&gt; 4. ...is written on the appropriate object?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>At that point I&#39;m not sure either. But with the skeleton of <br/>\nthe application method in place, one can use the full power <br/>\nof the IDE. I&#39;m using JUnitDoclet together with IDEA.<br/>\n<br/>\n1. (changing signature): IDEA does it. The structure of the <br/>\ntests is not effected, no need to re-run JUnitDoclet.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. (renaming a method): IDEA does much of it, including: <br/>\nreplacing the method name in the comments for JUnitDoclet. <br/>\nRegenerate the tests, and your code is in sync. Nothing else <br/>\nto do. (As far as I know Eclipse does not replace in comments, <br/>\nwhen doing the renaming. But there is help too, see 4.)<br/>\n<br/>\n3. (class- or instance level): The IDE is helping you.<br/>\n<br/>\n4.(appropriate object): Change the application by moving <br/>\nthe method. Again, the IDE is very supportive. You can <br/>\nmodify the test now manually. Or, if you run JUnitDoclet <br/>\nat this point, there would be a new empty test method <br/>\nand some &quot;not related&quot; test content. JUnitDoclet collects <br/>\nthose &quot;not related&quot; lines in a special method and prints <br/>\na warning if this special method is not empty. You can <br/>\nmove the test content now to the new method.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Generally speaking, you don&#39;t really know these things until you write<br/>\n&gt; test code, which is really just sample client code, look at it,<br/>\n&gt; evaluate it and move on. In general, it is when one sees it &quot;in print&quot;<br/>\n&gt; than one really looks at it carefully. Writing the test first<br/>\n&gt; guarantees this, while writing the stub first does not.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I consider the stub to be flexible when implementing the test. <br/>\nThere is not much of a difference, except we are using <br/>\ndifferent supporting features of the IDE.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I don&#39;t use JUnitDoclet, so I can&#39;t comment on how using it changes the<br/>\n&gt; rules of the game. If it&#39;s easy to set up (less than 1 hour), then I<br/>\n&gt; may start using it, just for the experience.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;d be glad to help, if there would be a problem. <br/>\nIf you want to look at JUnitDoclet before you install it:<br/>\n<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.junitdoclet.org/demo.html\">http://www.junitdoclet.org/demo.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I would like you to expand on this: what &quot;documenting aspect&quot; do you<br/>\n&gt; mean? and why does writing the stub first enable this feature and<br/>\n&gt; writing the test first not enable this feature?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I hope, my lines in the beginning of this email clarified, <br/>\nwhat I ment. Sorry, if I wasn&#39;t more precise in former emails.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your time.<br/>\n<br/>\nKind Regards,<br/>\n<br/>\nSteffen Gemkow<br/>\n<br/>\nPS: Some people force _all_ assertions in tests related to <br/>\nspecifc units of code. There are good reasons, to manually <br/>\nwrite _some_ additional TestCases (for example at use case <br/>\nlevel) too.</div>",
