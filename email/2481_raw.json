I&#39;ve used it a bit in IBM VAJ, and\n&gt; really like it so far, but it would be great if I could interact with\n&gt; other users of this software, since alot of aspects of usage are\n&gt; still pretty unclear.  But I cannot seem to find link or button in\n&gt; the SourceForge page for posting to the list from the list archive\n&gt; page, even though the preceeding page clearly says &#39;Choose a list to\n&gt; browse, search, and post messages&#39;.\n&gt;\n&gt; I realize I may very well be missing something very simple that when\n&gt; explained to me will make me feel quite dumb.  On the other hand, I\n&gt; don&#39;t see very many postings in that public user list, so perhaps\n&gt; something there is broken?\n&gt;\n&gt; Is anyone else having similar frustrations, or is it just me?  The\n&gt; EasyMock alternative, I think, requires jdk 1.3, which IBM VAJ does\n&gt; not yet support, so I was hoping to bank on the MockObjects framework\n&gt; to provide much needed help in building my unit-tests.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
