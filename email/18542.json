I&#39;ll take a shot at the first one:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 12/13/06, lightbulb432 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:veerukrishnan@...\">veerukrishnan@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; What is the point of these mock object tools? I first read about mock<br/>\n&gt; objects in a book on JUnit that had an example using straight JUnit to<br/>\n&gt; create the mock object and test it. What do these tools do that is special<br/>\n&gt; that you can&#39;t do yourself - I haven&#39;t been able to figure out by their<br/>\n&gt; websites, perhaps somebody could explain it in simple terms?<br/>\n<br/>\nLike most useful frameworks, the mock object frameworks earn their<br/>\nplace by automating repetitive tasks.  There are several examples I<br/>\ncould give, but one is being able to easily specify the behavior of<br/>\njust one method in an interface.  For example Bundle is an interface<br/>\ntype with 22 methods in the Eclipse runtime API.  If I want to test a<br/>\nmethod that takes a bundle b, but only depends on the result of<br/>\nb.getSymbolicName(), using just Java, I have to create 21 stub methods<br/>\nI care nothing about.  Even though my IDE can create them for me,<br/>\nthere&#39;s a big loss in the clarity of the test.  If, instead, I can<br/>\njust write (JMock 1):<br/>\n<br/>\nmockBundle.stubs().method(&quot;getSymbolicName&quot;).will(returnValue(&quot;bundle.id&quot;));<br/>\n<br/>\nThen I&#39;ve managed the same intent with one line of code.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a side note, I think that this is even clearer:<br/>\n<br/>\nassumeThat(mockBundle.getSymbolicName(), eq(&quot;bundle.id&quot;));<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is something I&#39;ve built in to a custom runner for JUnit,<br/>\ndescribed in part here:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://shareandenjoy.saff.net/2006/12/new-paper-practice-of-theories.html\">http://shareandenjoy.saff.net/2006/12/new-paper-practice-of-theories.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nUntil you find that intuitively, or from experience, this reduction in<br/>\neffort is worth the cost of installing and using such a mock<br/>\nframework, choosing a package and understanding its documentation is<br/>\nprobably not a high priority.  I know very good developers who do not<br/>\nuse mock frameworks--I&#39;d start out that way, and then return to the<br/>\nframeworks once you&#39;ve written a dozen or so mocks by hand.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps,<br/>\n<br/>\n   David Saff<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Basically, what all am I getting from one of these tools that I couldn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; from just doing it myself? (I realize there are benefits, I just don&#39;t know<br/>\n&gt; - in beginner terms - what they are.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Also, looking at the tutorials on rMock (and jMock, and easyMock which has<br/>\n&gt; this issue but to a lesser degree), I realized that they are extremely<br/>\n&gt; sparse. Just a little more than a page is apparently enough to teach people,<br/>\n&gt; but not me! Are people who are new to mock objects really supposed to<br/>\n&gt; understand it from their minimal Getting Started sections? Or is it just me?<br/>\n&gt; What&#39;s the best way for me to learn something like rMock?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Lasse Koskela wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hi &quot;veerukrishnan&quot;,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; On 12/13/06, lightbulb432 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:veerukrishnan@...\">veerukrishnan@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;  I&#39;m new to JUnit, and am wondering about using mock objects with JUnit.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I wa<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;  looking at www.mockobjects.com, and on the right side of the page it<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; lists<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;  &quot;implementations&quot;, and for Java it says jMock, EasyMock, and rMock.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;  What does it mean by implementations?

They&#39;re implementations of the mock object pattern<br/>\n&gt; &gt; where you define &quot;expectations&quot; (expected interaction, method calls in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Java) for a smart test double, which can then afterwards verify<br/>\n&gt; &gt; whether those expectations were met.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; On 12/13/06, lightbulb432 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:veerukrishnan@...\">veerukrishnan@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;  Any advice for a beginner as to which of those three implementations to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; look<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;  at (any difference in functionality, robustness, or any other<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; criteria?).<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;  Looking at their websites I couldn&#39;t really tell what the main<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; differences<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;  are.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve been personally using EasyMock for a long time. The reason for me<br/>\n&gt; &gt; having used EasyMock has really been just that I disliked the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; string-based approach of jMock (which doesn&#39;t work with automated<br/>\n&gt; &gt; refactoring tools too well, not to mention modern IDE&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; auto-completion features) and rMock has just recently appeared on the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; market.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Functionally all of the above frameworks are almost identical so if<br/>\n&gt; &gt; you don&#39;t have any bias towards a specific library, I&#39;d recommend<br/>\n&gt; &gt; trying each of them out by writing a small set of tests with each<br/>\n&gt; &gt; alternative. For jMock, however, be sure to use the 2.0 branch from<br/>\n&gt; &gt; their Subversion repository as the API will change completely. They&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; &gt; dumping the string-based expectation setting API in the upcoming 2.0<br/>\n&gt; &gt; release (which Nat Pryce promised would be out real soon...).<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Lasse<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; View this message in context: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nabble.com/Using-mock-objects-tf2812332.html#a7860038\">http://www.nabble.com/Using-mock-objects-tf2812332.html#a7860038</a><br/>\n&gt; Sent from the JUnit - User mailing list archive at Nabble.com.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
