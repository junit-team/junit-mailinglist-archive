Sometimes I work with streams, sometimes I<br/>\n&gt;  work with File objects and sometimes, I just want the content of the file as<br/>\n&gt;  an array of strings or as one big String.  It&#39;s unfortunate that the latter<br/>\n&gt;  is still not supported in the JDK.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The reason I am asking is that I always seem to prefer a<br/>\nFileStream/Reader/Writer to working directly with a file. I have<br/>\nnoticed that a lot of people seem to have a preference towards working<br/>\nwith files rather than Streams/Readers/Writers.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I would want random acces or something I would opt for working<br/>\ndirectly with files but I can&#39;t recall needing that, I have not<br/>\nwritten storages or such. Another occation when I use file objects is<br/>\nwhen doing file system management, creating listing, renaming, working<br/>\nwith directories etc. But when I read/write data i always use<br/>\nstreams/readers/writers.<br/>\n<br/>\nCould you give an example when you think that reading/writing directly<br/>\nto/from a File is better than a stream.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, when you have your array of Strings or single big string, what<br/>\ndo you typically do with it? I can think of some things but I am<br/>\ncurious.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the reasons I prefer Streams so much is because of the<br/>\nadvantage of being able to direct state to memory rather than disk and<br/>\nvary source/target media (like parser might just aswell get its input<br/>\nfrom a keyboard, socket, file, memory-location, it should not be bound<br/>\nto a file). The first point of directing state to memory is<br/>\nindispensable when testing.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, files imply mutable state of the worst kind. Most of the bugs I<br/>\nfind in my code have to do with mutablestate in one way or another and<br/>\nthus I try to avoid it when possible. That is also why I am a fan of<br/>\ninteractionbased testing.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust tossing some of my reasoning in there to be analysed, questioned<br/>\nand developed.<br/>\n/J</div>",
