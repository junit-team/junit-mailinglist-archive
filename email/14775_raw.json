The way I read it, you will always throw the exception, because you can never get the state where someParam equals 1 and 2.

Does one approach\nlook like\n\nARRANGE\nACT\nASSERT\n\nARRANGE\nACT\nASSERT\n\nwhile the other looks more like\n\nARRANGE\nACT\nASSERT\nACT\nASSERT\n\n?\n\nAnd if so, which one feels best to you?\n\n\nTodd.\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On \n&gt; Behalf Of xll_ll_ll_ll_ll_llx\n&gt; Sent: Sunday, September 11, 2005 1:32 PM\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: [junit] How many aspects a particular test method \n&gt; should test???\n&gt; \n&gt; Hi all,\n&gt; I am really really new with JUnit. Do excuse me if this \n&gt; question is too simple that it irritated you. OK so here is \n&gt; my confusion:\n&gt; \n&gt; The method I want to test is something like this:\n&gt; \n&gt; public void someMethod(int someParam) throws invalidParamException {\n&gt;   if(someParam!=1||someParam!=2) \n&gt;         throw invalidParamException\n&gt;   \n&gt;   someParam++;\n&gt; }\n&gt; \n&gt; Now this method will test someParam passed to it and if it \n&gt; gets stuck in the IF statement will throw exception else \n&gt; update someParam. Now what I wanna know is that the test \n&gt; method that I write to test a method like this should I be \n&gt; writing one test method that tests both whether exception is \n&gt; thrown correctly as well as someParam updated correctly. OR I \n&gt; should be writing one test method that tests for the \n&gt; exception and another that tests whether someParam is being \n&gt; updated appropriately. \n&gt; \n&gt; Please reply soon.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks.\n&gt; \n&gt; Nitesh Maan\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
