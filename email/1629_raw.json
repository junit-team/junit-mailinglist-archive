My development team depends on JUnit.  I&#39;d \nrather have fewer new features that are well designed and developed \nthan many features that are poorly designed and implemented.\n\n- If you are going to transfer control to the community, why \nnot &quot;Community Planning Game&quot;.  That is, implement the XP Planning \nGame where the community is the customer.  The community could \nexpress what they desire (stories) and set priorities.\n\n- Providing hooks for extensions would be great.  Right now, the most \nfrequently use hook is subclassing.  Unfortunately this makes it \ndifficult to use two extensions at once.\n\n- Greg\n\n\n--- In junit@y..., &quot;Johannes Link&quot; &lt;john.link@g...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; 2. JUnit as a political gesture celebrates the ability of \nprogrammers\n&gt; &gt; to test their own software. The code and tests must be held to a\n&gt; &gt; higher standard, to demonstrate the techniques necessary to uphold\n&gt; &gt; our end of the bargain.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;d like to add two aspects:\n&gt; - JUnit should be the stable angle for the very unstable projects \nwe all\n&gt; have to do. Changing too much jeopardizes stableness.\n&gt; - When adding too much non-core functionality one quickly looses \nfocus of\n&gt; the core parts. Very often the extra functionality is not exactly \nwhat I\n&gt; need in a specific situation, so I have to reimplement it anyway. \nIf the\n&gt; unneeded and unwanted part of a tool is prevailing many will move \ntowards\n&gt; starting from scratch with a new (small) framework. That&#39;s why I&#39;d \nrather\n&gt; have JUnit as a core with hooks to plug in additional behaviour \nwhich is\n&gt; available in additional tools.\n&gt; \n&gt; BTW, is the move to version 4 as described in\n&gt; http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?JunitNextRelease\n&gt; an &quot;official&quot; thing, i.e. promoted by Kent and Erich?\n&gt; \n&gt; Johannes\n\n\n",
