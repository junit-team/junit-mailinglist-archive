It&#39;s easy enough to get my<br/>\nprogramms wrong...<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think we can change the default to multi-threaded. This would<br/>\nlead to all kind of trouble. Since tests that can be executed in<br/>\nparallel need to be programmed that way. So it would have to be an<br/>\noption. This requires some thinking, how the two approaches might be<br/>\nmixed.<br/>\nI agree that class level paralellization is probaby a good start.<br/>\nThough I don&#39;t see a real problem with @Before and @After with regard<br/>\nto parallel execution, only with @BeforeClass and @AfterClass setup.<br/>\nThe real problem has more to do with the user supplied code. If I<br/>\nthink about my test suite now, that uses Spring, I don&#39;t know for sure<br/>\nwhat would happen, would I execute all the tests in parallel. I<br/>\nsuspect all kinds of oddeties would occour...<br/>\n<br/>\nGreetings,<br/>\n   Malte</div>",
