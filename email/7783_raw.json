What is the mythical problem that\n&gt;wou=\r\nld get\n&gt;me into trouble? Or is it just some design guideline or best practi=\r\nce that\n&gt;we\n&gt;should follow when it make sense?\n\nTypically the more tests th=\r\nere are that depends on the particular state of a database, the more diffic=\r\nult it is to execute those tests when you need to.\n\nAlso, consider the case=\r\n where you create a certain simple set of test data to satisfy the needs of=\r\n today&#39;s tests. You put that test data into the database and execute your t=\r\nests. Everything is fine. Tomorrow, you write a test that requires addition=\r\nal data. You add the additional data to satisfy the new tests *and* change =\r\nthe expected results for some of the old tests, so you need to change the o=\r\nld tests. If you do this often enough, it will drive you nuts.\n\n&gt;I indeed p=\r\nut the persistence tests into a separate suite. It is not mean\n&gt;to run\n&gt;eve=\r\nrytime it compiles. People need to know it write into the database and\n&gt;thu=\r\ns\n&gt;need to have it properly setup. The create() method itself is fairly\n&gt;st=\r\nraight\n&gt;forward. It&#39;s just a few setString() and executeQuery(). I don&#39;t kn=\r\now if it\n&gt;worth the effort to mock the infrastructure to test these few sta=\r\ntements\n&gt;really\n&gt;got executed. The most interesting part for me is to see t=\r\nhe queries got\n&gt;executed correctly and the fields do match the schema.\n\nThe=\r\n most interesting part for me is to see the query string is correctly gener=\r\nated. I don&#39;t generally feel the need to test that the database vendor corr=\r\nectly implements the JDBC standard. As long as I can generate the SQL query=\r\n correctly and can make business objects from a ResultSet, the rest is up t=\r\no the database vendor, and their code probably works. If it doesn&#39;t, then w=\r\ne&#39;ll find out soon enough.\n\n&gt;P.S. For some reason my mails to this list onl=\r\ny get listed after I sent it\n&gt;for\n&gt;2 days. This make the conversion not ver=\r\ny interactive. Does anyone has this\n&gt;problem?\n\nThis mailing list is moderat=\r\ned. This means that messages need to be approved before they are posted.
