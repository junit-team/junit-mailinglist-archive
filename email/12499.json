    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1942833756\">Yes, I have stopped because I have no other choice.  Let me back up and explain<br/>\nwhy I was trying this approach.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Class:<br/>\nI have a class that represents a table row in a database, lets call it<br/>\nTableRowContainer.  Instead of hardcoding many classes for each table in the<br/>\ndatabase, I have one class that can represent a row in any of them as long as<br/>\nyou pass in a table meta data class that explains what a row in a certain table<br/>\nshould be like.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe Test:<br/>\nSo to test this I write TableRowContainerTest.  It uses a specific meta data<br/>\nclass, fakes some data for it, and then tests the public methods.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Problem:<br/>\nThe only problem is that I don&#39;t think that it is sufficient just to have the<br/>\none hard coded meta data class, I want to test TableRowContainer with all of them.<br/>\n<br/>\nBad Solutions:<br/>\nMy first thought was to make a constructor in TableRowContainerTest that would<br/>\ntake a meta data class.  In a separate class, I iterate through a list of these<br/>\nmeta data classes (which I get by looking through the file system).  I construct<br/>\nan instance of TableRowContainerTest with each piece of meta data, and run the<br/>\ntests on each one.  This doesn&#39;t work for a number of reasons that I have<br/>\npreviously mentioned.<br/>\nIt is not that I am wanting to pass data from one test to the other.  It is that<br/>\nTableRowContainerTest is setup to run it&#39;s tests in the context of a single type<br/>\nof meta data.  I need an outside class to construct an instance of<br/>\nTableRowContainerTest with each meta data class and test it.<br/>\nTableRowContainer is not itself setup to run through all of the meta data<br/>\nclasses mainly because it extends from EqualsHashCodeTest in the JUnit addons as<br/>\na way to test the equals and hashcode for free.  in other words<br/>\nTableRowContainerTest tests a single type of TableRowContainer.  But I have many<br/>\nthat I would like to construct and check.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood Solution:<br/>\nI still don&#39;t see one.<br/>\nI guess that it would be possible to sublcass TableRowContainerTest for each<br/>\ninstance of the meta data that I would otherwise construct an instance around. <br/>\nBut this is a lot of extra classes for no reason other than to get around a<br/>\nlimitation in JUnit.<br/>\nI could also have a static variable that I repeatedly update to the new meta<br/>\ndata, and then run the tests.  But this could get into some tricky threading<br/>\nissues.  But again I am not sure how I would update the variable and run the<br/>\ntests, and get the TestResults to come out appropriately.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs it so wrong to want to instantiate a test with some parameters and<br/>\nautomatically run the tests on it?  I completely feel like I am missing<br/>\nsomething here.  Of course I am new to Unit Testing.  It was trivially easy<br/>\nuntil I came across this problem.  Now it feels like I am fighting with JUnit,<br/>\nand I know that I must not be thinking about this right.  I can&#39;t find any<br/>\ninformation on this type of problem.  Parameterized TestCase is close, but I<br/>\ndon&#39;t want to override runTest().  I want the reflective base functionality to<br/>\nrun all methods named test* automatically, and for the results to show up<br/>\nappropriately.<br/>\n<br/>\nI appreciate the reply.  I could really use some guidance on this if anyone has<br/>\nanything to add.<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nClay<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junityahoo@...\">junityahoo@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; So I write my first TestCase class.  Lets call it MyTestCase.  It works <br/>\n&gt; &gt; great by<br/>\n&gt; &gt; itself.  It fakes some data that it will need, then runs through some <br/>\n&gt; &gt; tests to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; make sure everything works right.  Great!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Now what I want to do is instantiate MyTestCase from another TestCase <br/>\n&gt; &gt; and have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it run through the tests.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Stop!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Don&#39;t do this. If you want to share data between tests, then make that <br/>\n&gt; data globally available from another resource, such as a file, a global <br/>\n&gt; variable, a database, whatever works.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Do /not/ run tests from within other tests. You won&#39;t get the results <br/>\n&gt; you want, anyway.<br/>\n&gt; -- <br/>\n&gt; J. B.
