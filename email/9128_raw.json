Class A is really simple: a constructor with a number of \n&gt; arguments and a host of accessor methods for retrieving this \n&gt; (member) data.\n\nThis sounds like a data class... why does it exist if it has no behaviour?\n\nThis is something that&#39;s been really pissing me off about Java..\ninstitutionalization of crappy design practices.\n\n&gt; here comes the dependency.  Class B contains a number of (two) class\n&gt; A instances.  The raw data is read within readExternal and then used\n&gt; to construct the instances of A.  Class B provides a couple of \n&gt; accessors to retrieve those A instances.\n&gt; \n&gt; Within my unit test for B&#39;s Externalizable implementation is to \n&gt; check that what I pass in on the InputStream results in the B \n&gt; instance I expect.  But B contains two As so I appear to have two \n&gt; points of failure:  A.equals might fail which would result in the \n&gt; tests for both A and B failing.\n\nI don&#39;t see a problem.  You have tests for A.  You have tests for B. \nThe fact that B involves A is a non issue.  If A breaks, it&#39;s tests\nwill fail... and yes, so will B&#39;s.. so what.  If A&#39;s tests fail, that\nindicates that A is broken... don&#39;t worry that B&#39;s tests will fail\nsince A is broken... go fix A.  All the tests should pass again.\n\nDave\n\n\n",
