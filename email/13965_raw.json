I was thinking that suite() would let you do that pretty easily.\n&gt; \n\n\nThere are various ways you could do it. My concern is that however you \ndo it:\n\n1. You may well need to print out more details than can easily fit in an \nassert failure message in order to reproduce the problem.\n\n2. You should probably statically generate the test cases once before \nthe test suite is run rather than every time the test suite is run.\n\nJUnit is designed to run repeatedly. It is designed to let you know when \nyou broke something that was working before. Anything beyond that and \nyou&#39;ll find yourself working against the API rather than with it. That&#39;s \nfine, of course. One tool does not fit all needs. What makes JUnit a \ngood tool for unit testing makes it inappropriate for algorithmically \ngenerating test data.\n\nOne particular code smell I encounter frequently is when JUnit suites \nhave lots (or any) System.out.println() statements. That normally \nindicates someone is trying to get more data out of JUnit tests than \nthey&#39;re really intended to produce. It&#39;s even worse if these statements \nprint when the tests are passing as well as failing. In this case, \nactual failures are likely to get swamped by the usual output and may \nwell not be noticed, especially when running from Ant or the \ntextui.TestRunner so there&#39;s no red bar. Honestly I think the standard \nAnt JUnit task produces too much output already. I only want to see \ntests that failed. I want line of output at most if all tests passed.\n\n-- \nElliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nXML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim\n\n",
