This is only a \nchange in responsibility but has no benefits.\n\nOf course there is also the opportunity to provide a broader range of \ncompatible versions. But this opportunity also means more work for the \nmaintainers and slower adoption by users. JUnit 4.12 uses hamcrest 1.3. \nWhat if JUnit moves on to 4.13, 4.14 and hamcrest releases 2.0 and 2.1 \nrespectively. Will there be a version which is compatible with hamcrest \n2.1 and JUnit 4.13? Will there be a version which is compatible with \nJUnit 4.14 and hamcrest 1.3?\n\nAs a developer who want&#39;s to use JUnit 4.14 - *how do I know which \nhamcrest-junit-integration version to use? What will stop me from using \na wrong version?* For example I might be tempted to update JUnit to 4.14 \nbut forget to update hamcrest-junit-integration. There might be changes \nof the behaviour of JUnit that might cause some of my tests to pass \nalways although they should fail. On the other hand: JUnit 4.14 might be \nbinary incompatible to JUnit 4.12 - where to look for the right version \nof hamcrest-junit-integration?\n\nIf hamcrest moves on to 2.0 - which could be binary incompatible to 1.3 \ndue to the major version change (haven&#39;t checked) - *how long will \nhamcrest 1.3 be supported with latest JUnit versions by \nhamcrest-junit-integration?* I&#39;m asking because we also use JMock which \ndepends on hamcrest as well. If I update to an incompatible 2.0 I need \nalso an update of JMock....\n(( Actually I cannot update JMock without big effort because there was \nan incompatible change from 2.5.1 to 2.6 .... ))\n\nOn the other hand this will slow down speed for adoption of new JUnit \nversions because we have to wait until a new hamcrest-junit-integration \nversion is out or at least someone has built the appropriate version \nwith latest JUnit release and verified unit tests are still passing. It \nwill also increase the effort necessary to try JUnit release candidates \nor snapshots in real projects (because I also have to checkout and build \nthe integration library myself to be sure there is no problem with \nthat... and if there is a problem I need to fix it myself or stop using \nlatest JUnit release candidate).\n\n----\nIMHO decoupling JUnit and hamcrest has more drawbacks than benefits. \nAlthough I see it can be a chance for hamcrest to move on. I don&#39;t think \nJUnit as a project will profit that much. JUnit users might have a \nbroader choice of compatible hamcrest versions but this requires some \neffort (of the maintainers of hamcrest-junit-integration). I think this \nmight only work well for JUnit users if the JUnit team commits to that \nintegration project and is able to push out new releases of the \nhamcrest-junit-integration together with new JUnit releases.\n\n\nRegards,\nStefan\n\n\nAm 07.01.2015 um 08:31 schrieb Stefan Birkner mail@... \n[junit]:\n&gt;\n&gt; FYI: Nat Pryce took a first step for decoupling JUnit and Hamcrest:\n&gt; http://natpryce.com/articles/000806.html\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n\r\n--------------030401060707070102070700\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;\n  &lt;head&gt;\n    &lt;meta content=&quot;text/html; charset=utf-8&quot; http-equiv=&quot;Content-Type&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;/head&gt;\n  &lt;body bgcolor=&quot;#FFFFFF&quot; text=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;\n    Hi,&lt;br&gt;\n    &lt;br&gt;\n    I&#39;m not a developer of junit nor hamcrest and I don&#39;t feel the pain\n    of the tight integration of junit and hamcrest that &quot;prevents both\n    from moving on&quot; but I&#39;m a heavy user of both.&lt;br&gt;\n    I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a good idea to separate the hamcrest integration\n    from junit into it&#39;s own library.&lt;br&gt;\n    &lt;br&gt;\n    At the moment JUnit dictates the hamcrest version to be used but\n    also guarantees compatibility with this version.&lt;br&gt;\n    With the new library hamcrest developers will dictate the junit\n    version that is compatible with a specific hamcrest release.
