Imagine that you have class with one point of entry <br/>\n&gt;for the client i.e. one public method. You can&#39;t change the access modifier <br/>\n&gt;of your method just to test it. Wrapping your private method in a public <br/>\n&gt;method is just the same as changing the access modifier. It is will <br/>\n&gt;documented and it works to use java reflection.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The main issue is that a class with a large number of private methods is <br/>\nprobably doing too much work. A significant amount of that work could be <br/>\npushed off to helper classes. This will often (always, in my experience) <br/>\nresult in a better and simpler design that, _as a side effect_, is more <br/>\ntestable. I also end up with less duplication in the code base.<br/>\n<br/>\nI normally make these helper classes package-private until I can promote <br/>\nthem to more generally used classes; some get this status, but most <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobert.</div>",
