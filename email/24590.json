In my opinion semantic versioning is\n    not only about version numbers but about a clear compatibility\n    policy that will be guaranteed by the authors of the library.<br>\n    <br>\n    As far as I know for JUnit there is no compatibility policy at all -\n    neither formally agreed upon nor informal. On the one hand JUnit 4\n    ships with a JUnit 3 compatibility layer that will not be removed in\n    order to keep &quot;old legacy code bases alive&quot;. On the other hand there\n    have been incompatible changes in JUnit minor versions that forced\n    test-support library developers and excessive JUnit users to adopt.\n    For example the runner structure changed between 4.4 and 4.5 causing\n    projects like spring to develop workarounds and reflection magic to\n    support both versions. From 4.9 to 4.10 test rule implementation was\n    changed (see <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"ygrps-yiv-1644123350moz-txt-link-freetext\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/junit-team/junit/issues/357\">https://github.com/junit-team/junit/issues/357</a>) and\n    there might be more examples I&#39;m not aware of.<br>\n    <br>\n    So why do you maintain classes from a version that had it&#39;s end of\n    life 8 years ago to keep tests running written more than 8 years ago\n    while breaking code that has been developed months or days ago?<br>\n    <br>\n    Personally I did not suffer from the breaking changes in 4.5 nor\n    will I suffer from the planned changes in 4.12 - but the test rule\n    implementation change in 4.10 was a lot of effort for me and some of\n    my collegues (see github issue for details).<br>\n    4.10 was released in 2011 and I had to maintain two versions of our\n    test-support library to support projects using JUnit 4.8 and 4.9 on\n    the one hand and newer or updated projects using JUnit 4.10 and 4.11\n    on the other. Some months ago our last active developed project\n    migrated from JUnit 4.8.2 to JUnit 4.11 and I could finally stop\n    supporting and developing the old branch of the test-support\n    library.<br>\n    <br>\n    <br>\n    To sum up: I&#39;d love to have a compatibility policy for JUnit that\n    every one can rely on. Semantic versioning would be a good choice.<br>\n    <br>\n    Regards,<br>\n    Stefan <br>\n    <br>\n    <br>\n    <div class=\"ygrps-yiv-1644123350moz-cite-prefix\">Am 12.08.2014 um 21:06 schrieb David\n      Saff <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"ygrps-yiv-1644123350moz-txt-link-abbreviated\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:saff@...\">saff@...</a> [junit]:<br>\n    </div>\n    <blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <blockquote\n\n type=\"cite\"> <span style=\"display:none;\"> </span>\n      \n          <div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1644123350ygrp-text\">\n            <div dir=\"ltr\"><span\n style=\"font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:13px;\">Henrik,</span><br>\n              <div><span\n style=\"font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:13px;\"><br>\n                </span></div>\n              <div><span\n style=\"font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:13px;\">Thanks\n                  for the update.  We&#39;re considering a solution very\n                  close to what you recommend below; I&#39;ll report back.</span></div>\n              <div><span\n style=\"font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:13px;\"><br>\n                </span></div>\n              <div><span\n style=\"font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:13px;\"> \n                   David</span></div>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"ygrps-yiv-1644123350gmail_extra\"><br>\n              <br>\n              <div class=\"ygrps-yiv-1644123350gmail_quote\">\n                On Tue, Aug 12, 2014 at 1:53 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:hkaipe@...\">hkaipe@...</a>\n                [junit] <span dir=\"ltr\">&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;</span>\n                wrote:<br>\n                <blockquote class=\"ygrps-yiv-1644123350gmail_quote\" style=\"border-left:1px #ccc solid;\">\n                  <div style=\"background-color:#fff;\">\n                    <span> </span>\n                    <div>\n                      <div>\n                        <div>\n                          <p>Hi DavidI have tried 4.12-beta-1 on a\n                            number of problem scenarios.
