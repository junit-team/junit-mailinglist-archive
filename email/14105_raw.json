I was brainstorming and idea on the drive home from work tonight\nand realized I didn&#39;t know how to test something. This didn&#39;t come as\na major shock, but I think I have an idea for a solution and I would\nlike some devil&#39;s advocates :)\n\nSuppose the following class:\n\npublic class SomeClass {\n   public boolean doSomething(double x, double y) {\n      double a = Math.random();\n      double b = Math.random();\n      return (x+a) &gt; (y+b);\n   }\n}\n\nWriting a test case for this is next to impossible because you do not\nknow the results of the method beforehand. But what if there were an\ninterface:\n\npublic interface DoubleGenerator { public double nextDouble(); }\n\nthat SomeClass depends on.\n\npublic class SomeClass {\n   private DoubleGenerator doubleGenerator;\n   //setter method\n\n   public boolean doSomething(double x, double y) {\n      double a = doubleGenerator.nextDouble();\n      double b = doubleGenerator.nextDouble();\n      return (x+a) &gt; (y+b);\n   }\n}\n\nThe implementation of DoubleGenerator in production code could be a\nwrapper around Math.random() and a testing implementation could allow\nyou to set the sequence of doubles to return.\n\nYou could also use java.util.Random instead of DoubleGenerator and\nsubclass it to allow setting of the sequence, but I don&#39;t like having\nall the extra methods when SomeClass only needs one of them. However,\nhaving the extra methods allows for flexibility later. Opinions?\n\nAlso, is setting a DoubleGenerator with two doubles good practice? For\nnow, doSomething() needs two doubles, but it may need three or four\nlater. Is this &quot;inside knowledge&quot; bad practice when writing tests?\n\nThanks for your opinions.\n\nMichael.\n\n\n\n",
