I was creating a\ncustom URL protocol handler and ran into problems. Ultimately I linked my\nproblems to JUnits custom classloader and I am able to dodge the issue by\nusing the text UI or using -noloading with the GUI.\n\nThe symptom I experienced was a class variable (static variable) that was\nbeing initialised twice. This was frustrating since other constraints required\nthe use of static variables and thread-local storage.\n\nMy best analysis is that my first access to the class was handled by JUnits\nclassloader, but that the second access was handled by the default classloader\nsince it was loaded by code in rt.jar (namely the URL protocol handler\nbootstrap mechanism). Since the second access used the default classloader,\nthe JUnit classloader was not queried to check if the class was already\nloaded. The end result being that my static variable was reset to its default\nvalue.\n\nAfter reading about related bugs I realise that the general issue with the\nclassloader had already been discussed. I would like to know if there is\nactive development with respect to this issue and if it is likely to make it\ninto a pending release?\n\nThanks\nStewart\n\n-- \nStewart Gebbie\n\n\n\n",
