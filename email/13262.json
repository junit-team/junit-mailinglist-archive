If you do it frequently enough<br/>\nyou can refactor those bits out into some common fixtures<br/>\nor utility libraries. E.g. in your example below you could<br/>\nput the code for steps 1 and 2 in a setUp method. This can<br/>\nusually be done without changing the application under test<br/>\nbut can sometimes be slow and may make your tests more fragile,<br/>\ne.g. if the application changes for steps 1 and 2, you might<br/>\nhave to change your test even though you are testing step 3.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith the unit test approach, you set up mock or stub classes.<br/>\nIn your case, you could (as an example) set up a session stub<br/>\nwhich had hard-coded inside it all of the required data as<br/>\nit would be after steps 1 and 2. This may require a little<br/>\nbit of refactoring initially if the original application<br/>\nwasn&#39;t designed with mock/stub objects in mind but the<br/>\ntests will run faster and in general be less fragile.<br/>\nYou can write your own stubs or use jmock, easymock,<br/>\nmockrunner or other equivalent packages.<br/>\n<br/>\nPaul.<br/>\n<br/>\nnoam_eitan wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; hi.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; thanks for your reply.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; let me tell u what I mean by the word &quot;scenario&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; the user is doing the following steps, and I want to check the whole <br/>\n&gt; process :<br/>\n&gt; 1. the user is logging in. the servlet is then check the user/pass, <br/>\n&gt; and save the user profile info in the session.<br/>\n&gt; 2. the user is locating some data, lets say &quot;workers&quot;. he types a <br/>\n&gt; worker name. the servlet is getting the data from the DB, but before <br/>\n&gt; the selecting, it checks that the user, (as saved in the session) has <br/>\n&gt; the authorization to do so. after selecting the &quot;worker/workers&quot;, the <br/>\n&gt; servlet is saving them in the session.<br/>\n&gt; 3. the user is asking to display some data of the &quot;workers&quot;. the <br/>\n&gt; servlet is again checking the authorization to do the action, and the <br/>\n&gt; authorization  to check about those &quot;workers&quot; (all the info is coming <br/>\n&gt; from the session).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; now, if I want to check this scenario, by checking only the last <br/>\n&gt; step, I have to init the user data and the &quot;workers&quot; data in the <br/>\n&gt; session, and then to invoke the last step. what I want to do is to <br/>\n&gt; invoke steps 1,2 and when invoking the last one, all the data will be <br/>\n&gt; in the session.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; how can I do so ?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; thanks.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
