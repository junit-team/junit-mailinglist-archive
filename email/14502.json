The question is wether it&#39;s *a good idea*. And I<br/>\ndon&#39;t think there is a definite, all-embracing answer to that question.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It is will documented and it works to use java reflection.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And it&#39;s more complex than using public methods. Even more importantly,<br/>\nhaving to do it is a code smell, in my experience.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The developers in the project I am currently working changed their<br/>\n&gt; private methods to public just to UNIT test their code.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What happened as a consequence?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It is<br/>\n&gt; currently very important to test the private methods as it accounts<br/>\n&gt; for over 60% of the functionality and logic. I have found that<br/>\n&gt; enables me to test bottom up and I have more confidence when coding<br/>\n&gt; and when I need to refactor.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I have found that methods that are complex enough to warrant explicite<br/>\ntesting want to live in classes where they are naturally public.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers, Ilja</div>",
