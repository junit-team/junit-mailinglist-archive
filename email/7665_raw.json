Typical(/useful) \ntest boundaries in java are usually a single class, a package, a \nsubsystem, etc...\n\nIf your test wants an:\n\texternal view of &quot;something&quot;\n\t\t#1 is strongest (only get to interact w/ public members)\n\t\t#2 workable/convenient, but allows package visibility\n\tinternal view of &quot;something&quot;\n\t\t#3 is typical/easiest\n\nAs for concerns that one path or another is a dead-end... I&#39;ve used all \nthree-- none have killed or otherwise crippled my projects. I&#39;ve \ndeveloped a strong preference for tests with maximum external views, \nbut don&#39;t hesitate to write white-box (#3) tests when something makes \nme nervous.\n\n-- Levi\n\n\nOn Wednesday, April 9, 2003, at 09:33  AM, Sandy McArthur wrote:\n\n&gt; Searching the message archive there seems to be three common places to\n&gt; put your tests.\n&gt;\n&gt; 1) Next to the class you are testing but in the same directory.\n&gt; 2) Next to the class you are testing but in a different directory.\n&gt; 3) In a public static inner class.\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
