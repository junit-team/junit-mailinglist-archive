I was alerted to it by the <br/>\nlatter link:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-02-2002/jw-0215-dbcproxy.html\">http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-02-2002/jw-0215-dbcproxy.html</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.geocities.com/eliassonaand/project-home.html\">http://www.geocities.com/eliassonaand/project-home.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI am not advocating this approach.  I have first heard about DBC during <br/>\nthe &quot;JUnit considered problematic&quot; discussion here.  Personally I like <br/>\nusing JUnit.<br/>\n<br/>\nEither way I thought the article on how DBC could be applied to Java <br/>\nmight help inform our discussion.  The article describes a way of <br/>\ngenerating test cases from pre-conditions, post-conditions and <br/>\ninvariants in the javadoc /** */  comments before each class.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis certainly seems interesting to me.  I certainly wouldn&#39;t use it as <br/>\na replacement for junit, but I would very much like to formalise the <br/>\nrelationship between method description, unit test and class documentation.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems to me that these DBC statements don&#39;t cover the full range of <br/>\npossibilities covered by well-written tests in junit, but what would be <br/>\ninteresting would be to think about how to specify/document the range of <br/>\nunit tests that a method or code segment must pass within the code itself.<br/>\n<br/>\nCHEERS&gt; SAM</div>",
