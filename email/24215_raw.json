JavaScript is a functional language, but all of\n&gt; &gt; the JS test =\r\nframeworks that I am aware of use JUnit-like syntax for\n&gt; &gt; defining test c=\r\nases (JsUnit defines test functions at global scope,\n&gt; &gt; JsTestDriver uses =\r\nmethods on a class). If functional programming could\n&gt; &gt; change the paradig=\r\nm for defining tests, you would think it would have\n&gt; &gt; happened in JavaScr=\r\nipt.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Am I missing something?\n&gt; \n&gt; Whenever I checked with my limit=\r\ned understanding of JavaScript and its ecosystem I was extremely week on th=\r\ne unit testing side of things.\n&gt; \n&gt; Also the JS syntax doesn&#39;t lend itself =\r\nto usage of closures as part of a DSL.\n&gt; \n&gt; To be more specific.
