As has already been suggested your *Helper may want to\nhave different n=\r\names, some may want to be merged, some broken up. And\naccording to my taste=\r\n stop being static and then injected to the class\nyou want to test.\n\nA lot =\r\nof good stuff can be found here:\nhttp://www.objectmentor.com/resources/publ=\r\nishedArticles.html\n(click on by topic  | design)\n\nI would start looking at =\r\nthe single responsibility principle. That is\nin my experience the principle=\r\n that had the biggest impact on my\nunit-testing (together with the depenenc=\r\ny inversion principle).\n\nb) consider making them package-private or default=\r\n if you prefer to\ncall it that (remove the private, protected, public modif=\r\nier\nentirely). This is just above private, these methods are only\naccessibl=\r\ne by other classes in the same package. Not even subclasses\ncan access them=\r\n if they are in a different package (there is a common\nmisunderstanding tha=\r\nt default  less restricted than protected, it&#39;s\nreally the other way around=\r\n.\n\nc) perform securitymanager stunts to acces the actual private methods.\nI=\r\n would consider this a bit paranoid.\n\nI look at both b) and c) as workaroun=\r\nds. Sometimes we need workarounds\nuntil we figure out how everything should=\r\n fit.\n\nOf course, if you are comfortable with the helper style, by all mean=\r\ns\ncontinue with that. From where I&#39;m standing it looks like it is the\ndesig=\r\nn part of TDD that wants to be listened to. I am standing quite\nfar away th=\r\nough so I may be wrong.\n\n/J\n\nOn 2/21/07, Ole Ersoy &lt;ole_ersoy@...&gt; wr=\r\note:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yes - I assumed parts of the &quot;All Methods Public&quot;\n&gt; thre=\r\nad in here.\n&gt;\n&gt; To summarize:\n&gt; By putting methods on a Helper and making t=\r\nhem public\n&gt; I&#39;m simulating being able to turn off\n&gt; private/protected chec=\r\nking on methods in the JVM, so\n&gt; that all methods can be easily tested and =\r\nreceive the\n&gt; benefits of test driven development, while keeping the\n&gt; test=\r\ns tightly linked to the methods they are testing.\n&gt;\n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; - Ole\n&gt;\n&gt; -=\r\n-- C=C3(c)dric Beust =E2=99&quot; &lt;cbeust@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; On 2/20/07, O=\r\nle Ersoy &lt;ole_ersoy@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Or do it in reverse.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Declare private methods on the Class, and have\n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; builder =\r\ncreate the ClassHelper.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m a bit confused where this discussion is=\r\n going.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If my class needs helper methods that it will be the\n&gt; &gt; on=\r\nly one using, I\n&gt; &gt; make them private on that same class (ideally,\n&gt; &gt; stat=\r\nic private if they\n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t modify any state).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Only if these helpe=\r\nr methods can be useful to other\n&gt; &gt; classes would I\n&gt; &gt; consider extractin=\r\ng them in a separate Helper class.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --\n&gt; &gt; C=E9dric\n&gt; &gt; http://testn=\r\ng.org\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; __________________________________________________________\n&gt; =\r\nNever miss an email again!\n&gt; Yahoo!
