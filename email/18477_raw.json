This is what I get for\n&gt; trying to be clever and con=\r\ncise at the same time. [1]\n&gt;\n&gt; assertThat(valueOf(button).isEnabled(), even=\r\ntually(eq(true)));\n&gt;\n&gt; ...only is useful in a multi-threaded situation, in =\r\nwhich the button\n&gt; may not be enabled the first time you check, but if you =\r\nwait a while,\n&gt; it should soon become enabled.  The great thing is that thi=\r\ns idea of\n&gt; repeatedly evaluating an expression, checking against a desired=\r\n\n&gt; result, and then waiting before evaluating again is all encapsulated\n&gt; w=\r\nithin the &quot;valueOf&quot; and &quot;eventually&quot; methods.  Once I figured this\n&gt; out, m=\r\ny asynchronous UI tests actually became readable.\n\n\nOh, ok, so there is a l=\r\not more at work than assertions here, and this is a\nseparate (albeit very i=\r\nnteresting) topic from literate assertions.  I would\ndefinitely hide this k=\r\nind of complexity (such as invokeLater(), join(),\netc...) in utility functi=\r\nons.\n\nFYI, here are a few ways you can test asynchronous code (e.g. UI or J=\r\nMS)\nwith TestNG &lt;http://beust.com/weblog/archives/000236.html&gt;.\n\nThe litera=\r\ncy is actually secondary here, which is why I&#39;m willing to\n&gt; live with and(=\r\ngreaterThan(10), lessThan(20)) when I have to [2].  The\n&gt; primary win is th=\r\nat the thing you&#39;re trying to assert is separated\n&gt; from the act of asserti=\r\nng\n\n\nI&#39;m a bit confused by this, which sounds interesting, but which I can&#39;=\r\nt\nconnect to your following examples:\n\n, so that you can write:\n&gt; assertTha=\r\nt(button, eventually(isEnabled()));  // will become enabled\n&gt; or\n&gt; assertTh=\r\nat(button, isEnabled());  // is now enabled\n&gt; or\n&gt; assertThat(button, not(i=\r\nsEnabled()));  // is disabled\n\n\nIn all these cases, it looks like both the =\r\nassert and the evaluation of the\nassert are executed at the same time, can =\r\nyou clarify?  (maybe by explaining\nwhat eventually() really does?)\n\n-- \nC=\r\n=E9dric\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
