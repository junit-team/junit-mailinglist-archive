My package \n\nAh, an extreme viewpoint. I love those.\n\nI&#39;ve found some value in using TestSuite to structure and order tests,\nbut we have consider replacing that with some sort of finder. I&#39;d love\nto hear positive experiences.\n\nWhen we created the TestSuite classes initially, we ordered the tests\nso that the more &quot;primitive&quot; classes are tested first. That way, if a\ndeveloper manages to break something badly, the first failure tends to\nbe interesting. The ordering was useful for doing some large\nrefactorings; fixing those first failures often fixed the later,\nlarger-grained tests.\n\nWe&#39;ve also got some platform-specific automated tests we are starting\nto write and it&#39;s useful to *not* run those on platforms other than the\nexpected one. For example, we have some code that does testing specific\nto personal Java and we&#39;ll likely be adding some that is specific to\nMIDP. So, if we use an automated test finder, it needs to have a way to\ncategorize tests and selectively include/exclude certain categories.\n\nAn alternative would be to add more CVS modules and use them to\ncategorize tests, but I think that complicates the development/build\nenvironment more than it pays in testability benefit.\n\nRegards,\n\nRob\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nGet personalized email addresses from Yahoo!
