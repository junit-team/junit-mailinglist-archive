If your codebase is dozens of 1000 line files of<br/>\n&gt; function-less spaghetti code maintained by mulitple programmers across<br/>\n&gt; multiple teams in various geographical locations... You (and your<br/>\n&gt; organization) have a lot of work ahead of you before you can push TDD. <br/>\n&gt;...<br/>\n<br/>\nHi Gabriel.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust to be clear, I was not restricting my argument to TDD infection.<br/>\nI believe that the TDD1 gene, let&#39;s call it that, is considerably more<br/>\nrare than the T1 gene. At this point in time I&#39;d be thrilled to see<br/>\nthe majority of developers writing and running unit tests on a regular<br/>\nbasis; whether they write them before, during, or after the code is<br/>\ndone. At this stage of the game test-first is less important than<br/>\nhaving the tests in the first place - gotta walk before you run.<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree that most projects out there consist of 1,000s of classes with<br/>\nno tests.  I love Michael Feathers&#39;s definition: code without tests ==<br/>\nlegacy code.  This definition makes 95%+ of Java code legacy code. <br/>\n&quot;Legacy code, is not just COBOL anymore&quot; :-).<br/>\n<br/>\nSeriously, I can, and do, sympathize that sometimes the task looks<br/>\n&quot;monumental and even prohibitive&quot;. But only if you think that you have<br/>\nto go from zero tests to 1,000s of tests right away.  I don&#39;t know why<br/>\nmany people think in terms of all-or-nothing when it comes to testing.<br/>\nYou have to start somewhere, and something is better than nothing. <br/>\n10,000 Java classes and 1 JUnit test is better than 10,000 Java<br/>\nclasses and 0 JUnit tests.  2 tests are better than 1, and so<br/>\nforth.  And look at the bright side, at least those 2 tests will run<br/>\nquickly.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are stuck in a project like the one you describe, it&#39;s probably<br/>\ncounter-motivating to even look at metrics like<br/>\nnumberOfTests/numberOfClasses, or code coverage: &quot;Hey, we achieved 5%<br/>\ncode coverage. Where&#39;s the Champagne?&quot;.  Instead focus on the absolute<br/>\nnumber of tests (a simple, positive, monotonically growing test metric).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile the &quot;monumental pile of untested spaghetti code&quot; does not help,<br/>\nI believe a lot of people just use that as an excuse to not get<br/>\nstarted. I have seen developers rejecting regular unit testing even in<br/>\ngreenfield projects, so there is something more fundamental at play.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlberto<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.junitfactory.com\">http://www.junitfactory.com</a><br/>\nGenerate JUnit tests.
