Schuchert &lt;schuchert@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;   I&#39;ve been working with a group for the past 3.5 years and we&#39;ve been\n&gt; using JUnit from the beginning. A while back, as the project grew,\n&gt; there were times when we would break tests (or because we had\n&gt; external dependencies that we had to wait and had not yet mocked\n&gt; things out), tests would fail for a few days before we could get to\n&gt; them.\n&gt;\n&gt; This stopped our CI, so we introduced a helper class, TimeBomb. We&#39;d\n&gt; add a call to TimeBomb with a date and the test would stop failing\n&gt; until after the provided date.\n&gt;\n&gt; It was an active way to remind us go back and fix something in a few\n&gt; days.\n&gt;\n&gt; @Ignore has a message. What about adding a date? Ignore until the\n&gt; date, after which the test will fail by throwing a runtime exception?\n&gt;\n&gt; Is that crazy?\n&gt;\n&gt; Brett\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
