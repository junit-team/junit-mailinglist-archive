Starting today, I&#39;m going\nto tr=\r\ny to get back to one-week maximum latency for new code reviews\nand communic=\r\nation around JUnit.  If you&#39;ve gotten stuck in the backlog\nI&#39;ve built up in=\r\n the interim, feel free to re-forward and jump the\nqueue.\n\nAlso, if it feel=\r\ns like it&#39;s taking a long time to get a code review,\nplease feel free to us=\r\ne this list to ask other devs to take a first\nlook: often, the first 80% of=\r\n improvements, especially around naming\nand documentation, can be provided =\r\nby any suitably experienced\ndeveloper.\n\nThanks for your patience and for su=\r\npporting each other within the community.\n\n   David Saff\n\nOn Mon, Oct 31, 2=\r\n011 at 2:51 PM, David Saff &lt;david@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; All,\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ve been ver=\r\ny lucky for several years to had both a family and an\n&gt; employer that have =\r\nleft room for me to contribute to JUnit for free.\n&gt; However, for at least t=\r\nhe next month, two launches are combining to\n&gt; absorb the lion&#39;s share of m=\r\ny time. =A0One is named Micah, and is rather\n&gt; user-friendly most of the ti=\r\nme, but has a somewhat draining\n&gt; maintenance schedule, and sporadic uptime=\r\n. =A0The other doesn&#39;t yet have\n&gt; a last name that we&#39;re sharing, although =\r\nI expect the first name will\n&gt; be &quot;Google&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks for understanding if=\r\n your great questions and valuable patches\n&gt; are responded to with more del=\r\nay over the coming weeks.\n&gt;\n&gt; =A0 David Saff\n\n",
