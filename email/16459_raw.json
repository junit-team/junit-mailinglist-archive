Then we have 2 corresponding=\r\n \nsystem-level &quot;AllTests&quot; classes that encompass all the package-\nlevel &quot;Al=\r\nlTest&quot; classes. Is there an easy and reliabe way to keep \nthese &quot;AllTest&quot; c=\r\nlasses up to date? It&#39;s hard enough to get everyone \nto write tests, but no=\r\nw they also have to remember to update the \nappropriate &quot;AllTests&quot; classes =\r\nany time they create a new test class. \nI hoping there&#39;s a pattern or JUnit=\r\n extension or something that will \nhelp with this. Any advice would be grea=\r\ntly appreciated.\n\nThanks!!!\nGreg Plummer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
