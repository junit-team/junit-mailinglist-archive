At<br/>\nfirst I was baffled as running the tests individually went fine but<br/>\nrunning a lot (hundreds) of tests caused JUnit to run out of memory (the<br/>\nclasses under test used jaxb to read a lot of xml). After digging I<br/>\nfound that I had misunderstood how JUnit works. I thought that after a<br/>\ntest is run, there is no more use for that test object so the reference<br/>\nto it is discarded. This is not so, as I found reading the FAQ entry<br/>\n&quot;When are tests garbage collected?&quot;: <br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://junit.sourceforge.net/doc/faq/faq.htm#tests_18\">http://junit.sourceforge.net/doc/faq/faq.htm#tests_18</a><br/>\n<br/>\n  So, I made tearDown set reference to anything instantiated in setUp to<br/>\nnull and the problem was gone. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n       -Antti-</div>",
