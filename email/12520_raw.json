I&#39;m pretty new to the \n&gt; latter, thus I&#39;m testing my understanding of Quartz just as \n&gt; much as I&#39;m \n&gt; testing my code. In effect, I can&#39;t (yet) build the fixture \n&gt; for my code \n&gt; completely with mocks as I have to ascertain what these mocks are \n&gt; supposed to do first.\n&gt; \n&gt; The complication here is that Quartz uses its own &quot;hidden&quot; \n&gt; thread(s) to \n&gt; fulfill its duties. It is such a thread that effects the \n&gt; change that I \n&gt; need to check for. As I don&#39;t want to test Quartz, of course, I&#39;m \n&gt; content with checking that my scheduled job is executed at \n&gt; all. Thus I \n&gt; schedule it for immediate execution, wait for 2 secs to give Quartz \n&gt; some time before the fixture is torn down again.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now, all this works surprisingly well. Still, I don&#39;t like \n&gt; the part of \n&gt; waiting some arbitrary time.\n&gt; \n&gt; (Thinking break)\n&gt; \n&gt; After getting this far, I remembered that Doug Lea&#39;s \n&gt; concurrency utils \n&gt; have made their way into J2SE 5.0 and there I found just what \n&gt; I needed: \n&gt; java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch\n&gt; \n&gt; Now I have a TestCase that looks in outline like this\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; public class MultiThreadedTest extends TestCase {\n&gt;     private static CountDownLatch latch;\n&gt;     private MyMock mock;\n&gt; \n&gt;     protected void setUp() {\n&gt;         latch = new CountDownLatch(1);\n&gt;         mock = new MyMock();\n&gt;     }\n&gt; \n&gt;     public void testMe() throws Exception {\n&gt;         startSomeWorkInAnotherThread(mock);\n&gt;         latch.await(); // some timeout might be prudent\n&gt;         mock.verify();\n&gt;     }\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;     private static class MyMock implements Whatever {\n&gt;         private boolean wasCalled = false;\n&gt; \n&gt;         public void methodCalledFromOtherThread() {\n&gt;             wasCalled = true;\n&gt;             latch.countDown();\n&gt;         }\n&gt; \n&gt;         public void verify() {\n&gt;             assertTrue(wasCalled);\n&gt;         }\n&gt;     }\n&gt; }\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I appreciate your comments.\n&gt; \n&gt; Michael\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; Michael Schuerig                            This is not a false alarm\n&gt; mailto:michael@...
