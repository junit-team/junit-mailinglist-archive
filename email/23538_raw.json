Rules are intended to be composeable and order-independent. I would need a compelling use case to tighten this constraint.\n\nThis makes total sense to me in general and I would not change it!\n\nBut if I do have a problem that needs a specific order, I think the\ntrick to use a chaining Rule sounds like the best workaround I can\nthink of right now.\nAnd that&#39;s what it is to me: A workaround.\n\nFor example in my current project: We have a &quot;registry&quot; for dependency\nlookup. This needs to be initiated before some other things can\nhappen.\nWe don&#39;t currently have a Rules problem here, but I can imaging, that\nsuch a quirky design can lead to such problems. And then a workaround\nmight be helpful.\n(Yes, this really is a design flaw in the application and we are\nworking on fixing it soon.)\n\nGreetings,\n   Malte\n\n",
