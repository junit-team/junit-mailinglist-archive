It made a big difference for<br/>\nmany users.  With 4.9, I want to try something new: after posting the<br/>\njars on github, I&#39;ll also try to immediately upload them to maven<br/>\ncentral.  I&#39;m asking for help automating that process from people who<br/>\nhave more familiarity with the concepts.  You&#39;re right that the<br/>\ndiscussion doesn&#39;t necessarily make sense underneath that issue any<br/>\nmore.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; It may finally be time for me to just take over running the script<br/>\n&gt;&gt; that makes the magic happen, since this seems to be a major obstacle<br/>\n&gt;&gt; for many people trying to get new features and bug fixes from JUnit.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Can I ask again for help from the maven-initiated?  Best thing would<br/>\n&gt;&gt; be a pull request with a shell script that I can run on release,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; without needing to understand too much about what it does.  Thanks,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Reading the cover letter of <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/KentBeck/junit/pull/203\">https://github.com/KentBeck/junit/pull/203</a><br/>\n&gt; makes it sound as if all necessary scripting work has already been done.<br/>\n&gt; (Someone would then take the output of the script and upload it through<br/>\n&gt; the oss.sonatype.org web interface)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yep, I think we&#39;re almost there.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Max.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
