Primarily I used it to help test drive the implementation of\nvarious listeners required within a couple of dialogs I was writing.  Whilst\nslowing down the unit test process (because it renders a UI and &quot;robots&quot; the\nuser control) it&#39;s worked pretty well for me.  \n\nNow I come to the validation process and I have received a number of bugs to\nfix (no big deal) but my question is how much should I drive my bug fixing?\nNormally (prior to abbot) I&#39;d dig about my code to locate the appropriate\ncode, create a test case (or cases) to highlight the bug and drive the fix\nappropriately.  Now I have a UI fault that is easy to reproduce - and I&#39;ve\ncreated a test case using abbot to highlight the fault, and can now dig\nthrough the code and fix it... but... this fault (as with a couple of other\nUI faults) resolves down to a failing implementation of some\nDocumentListener logic.  \n\nSo should I (would you) keep TDD the fix via the high level UI test case, or\ndrill down and write &quot;lower&quot; level test cases for the DocumentListener\nimplementation.  The former helps solve the current bug, the later also\nfixes the bug but has better coverage of the listener (which could be/is\nreused)?  Or should I duplicate the test to test both the UI working\ncorrectly and the listener being implemented correctly?  I don&#39;t like the\nidea of duplication, and I prefer using non UI tool testing (because of the\nquicker round trip effect), but it seems that I probably do need both tests,\nor am I missing something?\n\n\nAny thoughts/criticisms/insights appreciated.\n\nJonathan\n\n--\nJonathan Oddy\nSERVICEPower Business Solutions Ltd\nPetersgate House - St Petersgate - Stockport - SK1 1HE - ENGLAND\nTel: +44 (0)161 476 2277\nEmail: j.oddy@... &lt;mailto:j.oddy@...&gt;\n\n\n",
