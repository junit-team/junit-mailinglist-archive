In my environment, running each test is very \nexpensive, so I want to get the most out of it as possible.  If the \nassertion failure means the rest of my assertions aren&#39;t run, I&#39;m \nmissing a lot of information.  Initially, I broke them all up into \nseparate tests, but that proved to be clumsy, so I modified the code to \nallow for multiple failures (basically, a failed assertion wouldn&#39;t \nthrow an exception, it would simply be added to the TestResults \nfailures), and writing the tests proved much easier and provided much \nmore information than previously available.\n\n-shane\n\nOn Monday, September 3, 2001, at 12:14  PM, Laurent Duperval wrote:\n\n&gt; On  1 Sep, J.

Tsk, tsk... why aren&#39;t you using Map instead? :)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Uhm... What&#39;s the diff?\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; I&#39;d like a way to make\n&gt;&gt;&gt; the test fail for every parameter that is missing and consider each \n&gt;&gt;&gt; of the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; iterations as one test.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Silly question: why? Does it matter whether one, two or ten parameters \n&gt;&gt; are\n&gt;&gt; not handled correctly? I think it matters more whether they are all\n&gt;&gt; handled correctly, or not.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; It does but the fact that one parameter fails may have nothing to do \n&gt; with\n&gt; the fact that another fails since validation may be occuring in \n&gt; different\n&gt; parts of the code. By failing once per invalid parameter, you are\n&gt; immediately pointed to the proper place to debug. And if the test lists \n&gt; all\n&gt; the parameters that failed, a developer could possibly see a pattern, \n&gt; which\n&gt; also helps in debugging.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Also, who cares how many tests there are? Do you? Your manager? I don&#39;t\n&gt;&gt; want to get into the discussion again about counting tests, but I have\n&gt;&gt; never really cared how many tests I have, as long as I&#39;m happy with the\n&gt;&gt; quality of the tests.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; No, counting tests wasn&#39;t the motive behind my question.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Since JUnit counts test methods by default, you&#39;d need one method per\n&gt;&gt; parameter. Do you really think that&#39;s a useful thing to do? I don&#39;t.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; No, that&#39;s why I asked if there was a better method than what I&#39;m doing \n&gt; now:\n&gt; I have a StringBuffer to which I add all the parameters that failed and \n&gt; then\n&gt; use the StringBuffer in fail().\n&gt;\n&gt; L\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt; Laurent Duperval &lt;mailto:lduperval@...&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Why do we drive on parkways and park on driveways?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
