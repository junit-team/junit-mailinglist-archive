Unfortunately, we tend to use a lot of static\nmethods in our architecture.  Soooo... since you can&#39;t override a\nstatic method,  I can&#39;t figure out how to mock out the dependencies. \nAnyone have a good solution to this problem? The only one I could\nthink of was making stuff non-static.\nDave\ndhanna@...\n\n\n\n\n",
