Any reactions? Time to look for a better platform?\n&gt;\n&gt; [Yahoo&#39;s useless response deleted]\n\nIn my experience, Yahoo employees don&#39;t actually read the email you send them.\nThey just come up with some random guess as to what you are mailing about.\nWith one or two exceptions, every reponse I&#39;ve gotten from them shows that\nthey had no idea what I was writing about.\n\nAnyway, on to spam. I run the xp-jobs group. It got hit hard with spam (not\ntoo long after Windows XP came out... hmm...). The xp-jobs list has one or two\nposts a month, so having a few spams a day means a horrible signal-to-noise\nratio.\n\nI restricted posting to members only, but that didn&#39;t help. So now what I do\nis manually approve new members only if they reply correctly to the welcome\nmessage that gets sent when they try to sign up. There is no more spam, but it\nrequires a couple minutes a day of manual work.\n\n\nErik\n\n\n\n",
