The important aspect (to me) for the majority of tests\nis not the connection, but getting a number of messages into and back\nfrom the remote system.  I am in the position of being able to predict\nwhat response the remote system should give for a particular request.\nI feel the connection establishment and management can (and should?)\nbe tested separately.\n\nWhat I can&#39;t see is where to put the &#39;common&#39; object and how to\nreference it from a test level.  I feel like I am missing the obvious,\nand probably it&#39;s java rather than JUnit related!\n\nThe FAQ holds some guidance, and I have attempted to add some code to\nillustrate my non-conception...\n\nimport junit.framework.*;\nimport junit.extensions.TestSetup;\n\npublic class AllTestsOneTimeSetup {\n\n    Connection c = null;\n\n    public static Test suite() {\n\n        TestSuite suite = new TestSuite();\n\n        suite.addTest(SomeTest.suite());\n        suite.addTest(AnotherTest.suite());\n\n        TestSetup wrapper = new TestSetup(suite) {\n\n            protected void setUp() {\n                oneTimeSetUp();\n            }\n\n            protected void tearDown() {\n                oneTimeTearDown();\n            }\n        };\n\n        return wrapper;\n    }\n\n    public static void oneTimeSetUp() {\n        // one-time initialization code\n\n        c = new Connection(&quot;remoteIP&quot;);\n        c.open();\n    }\n\n    public static void oneTimeTearDown() {\n        // one-time cleanup code\n        c.close();\n    }\n}\n\nWithin SomeTest and AnotherTest I hope to use c.send(msg), but do not\nknow how to qualify or resolve c within SomeTest.\n\n--Mark\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
