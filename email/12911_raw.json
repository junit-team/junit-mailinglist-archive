Most of the\ndocumentation about mock objec=\r\nts says: &quot;don&#39;t mock 3rd party code&quot;, but\nif I don&#39;t, then how am I expecte=\r\nd to test my code that uses these 3rd\nparty libraries.\n\nIn particular I fou=\r\nnd this statement from\nhttp://www.mockobjects.com/DynaMock.html:\n&quot;We have f=\r\nound that mocking third party classes (and interfaces) over\nwhich we have n=\r\no control causes problems in the long run. It is better\nto define an interf=\r\naces for your objects in terms of concepts in your\napplication, and then im=\r\nplement them as wafer-thin adapters to the third\nparty libraries. That has =\r\ntwo benefits: (a) your objects are easier to\nunderstand, and (b) your appli=\r\ncation is not polluted with references to\nthird party packages that might h=\r\nave to be replaced for non-technical\nreasons. You do not need to have full =\r\ncontrol over the entire codebase\nto follow this approach.&quot;\n\nI don&#39;t really =\r\nunderstand what is meant by this. I&#39;ll return to the\nexample that I&#39;ve been=\r\n struggling with, one of my classes takes a\nNetworkInterface object as a pa=\r\nrameter to the constructor. Now in order\nfor me to test that all is well in=\r\n the constructor I need to mock\nNetworkInterface.\n\nIf somebody could please=\r\n give me an example of what to do. If possible\nplease use a class that take=\r\ns NetorkInterface as an argument to the\nconstructor as an example, as I&#39;m s=\r\ntruggling to understand this.\n\nBtw I would post this on the easyMock mailin=\r\ng list, but I&#39;m having\nproblems joining this list.\n\nThanks in Advance\nPico\n=\r\n\n\n",
