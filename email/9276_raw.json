However I am still not convinced how\n&gt;&gt;would one apply these in large systems.  In particular, in compilers and \n&gt;&gt;related topics.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; How to apply them to large systems is something that&#39;s well-worn by this \n&gt; point. Large systems are just larger collections of objects, so not much \n&gt; is different.\n&gt; \n&gt; As for compilers, your message seems to claim that building a compiler \n&gt; incrementally is not possible, or perhaps just not feasible. The way to \n&gt; build a compiler incrementally -- assuming you do not use any existing \n&gt; tools like parser generators -- is to pick one language feature and \n&gt; support it, then another, then another until you support the entire \n&gt; language.\n&gt; \n&gt; Another approach is to start by implementing an interpreter, work to \n&gt; support the entire language, then use the interpreter as a test \n&gt; environment to write the corresponding compiler. That&#39;s just an idea \n&gt; that comes off the top of my head and I have no idea whether it&#39;s feasible.\n&gt; \n&gt; Your question, it seems to me, is about incremental development and not \n&gt; TDD and not JUnit. Is that accurate? I only mention that because it&#39;s \n&gt; easier to answer a question once I understand the question.\n\nNo, the question is when you have many phases that setup the data on which an analysis works, how do you unit test the \nanalysis efficiently?  It may take a long time to setup the data, hence, the code-test-refactor cycle will prove rather costly.\n\nTo make things simple, consider a report generation application which adds some interesting facts to the report based on the \ndata being reported.  Now the nature of the report per say is dictated by the data, however, the data being generated may \ndepend on relation between various pieces of the data.  In the example, the report generator has a strong coupling with the \ndata generator but this is purely restricted to input data and no more (I am just clearing things in case people start saying \n&quot;reduce the coupling&quot;).  Now the information about input data (call it meta-data) which is also of relevance to report \ngenerator and this is not captured as a programmable software entity. How does one use TDD and/or JUnit in such cases is my \nquestion?\n\nAll examples of JUnit or TDD I have seen are Money and things on those lines which are stand alone classes.  However, things \nchange radically when you move to frameworks.  Referring to my first posting, in my opinion, a compiler is more of a framework \nrather than a single large application.  It is put together from peices and not grown from a single blob.  The Type checker is \ndependent on the AST and the AST is dependent on the Parser Tree which is dependent on parsing and the Parser.  Given this \nchain, how do you unit test each link in the chain?\n\nI hope I am making sense.  If not then may be someone can present a plausible solution to the above problem or something \nsimilar?  I would really appreciate it as I want to use TDD and JUnit, but somehow I cannot see a way to make it fit into my \nwork/application model.\n\nwaiting for reply,\n\n  - Venkatesh\n\n\n\n",
