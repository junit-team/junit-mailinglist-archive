It would seem you=\r\n gain the same power by allowing any Class&lt;?&gt;. The advantage of doing this =\r\nis it would allow real classes within the project to act as Categories, so =\r\nthat if, for example, I am testing a DAO framework, I can categorize indivi=\r\ndual tests with the specific DAO subclass they are targeting, and then run =\r\na category based on the DAO supertype. Much nicer than just calling it all =\r\nSlowTests. In practice that won&#39;t happen often if a custom interface is req=\r\nuired because it will introduce a dependency on a JUnit type in the product=\r\nion code.\n\nHuh.  The first time through, I thought &quot;that&#39;s ridiculous&quot;.  Th=\r\ne\nsecond time, I wondered if there&#39;s not something to this...\n\nTotally musi=\r\nng out loud, but you could rename the annotation as\nTestOf, so that you&#39;d h=\r\nave\n\n@TestOf(CustomStreamingPlatform.class)\n\nHmm...\n\n&gt; I&#39;m also curious if =\r\nyou considered using an annotation as the category? That is having the cate=\r\ngory take a Class&lt;?&gt; that represents an annotation? You could support meta-=\r\nannotations to allow a hierarchy of categories as well as supporting any su=\r\nbclasses or implementations of types so annotated. Coding for that would be=\r\n nasty business, but it wouldn&#39;t be complicated from a client point of view=\r\n, and would allow the same flexibility of inheritance without the dependenc=\r\ny on a JUnit type.\n\nI wanted to stay away from meta-annotations unless the =\r\nreasons were\n_really_ compelling.\n\n&gt; I would prefer just an arbitrary Class=\r\n&lt;?&gt;, though. Inheritance is well understood by any Java programmer (unlike =\r\nmeta-annotations) and opens up a synergy between the category hierarchy and=\r\n the code hierarchy.\n\nCan I get another vote on this extension idea?\n\n   Da=\r\nvid\n\n",
