Timothy is correct, this is a difficult problem, and the best<br/>\nway may in fact be to isolate the classes appropriately if possible.<br/>\nOne of the things I was hoping to check was packaging errors, where a<br/>\nclass that the client needs is only loaded from the client jars even<br/>\nthough the server jars have them as well. I had hoped this was a<br/>\ncommon problem that others had solved (and might be in your book), but<br/>\napparently not.</div>",
