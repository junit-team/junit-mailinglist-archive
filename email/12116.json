There is no <br/>\npublished generic methodology (like COCOMO) for estimating the effort of <br/>\nadding tests that I&#39;m aware of.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe best I can suggest is to conduct some experiments. See how much of <br/>\nthe system you can test in a week. This will give you a rough idea, at <br/>\nany rate. Even then, it is possible that you&#39;ll find a refactoring in <br/>\nweek three that makes the rest of the system much, much easier to test. <br/>\nThat is more likely than the reverse -- in other words, the cost of <br/>\ntesting a system tends to go down as you cover more of the system with <br/>\ntests. (This is a slight simplification, but it&#39;s true enough for you at <br/>\nthis moment.)<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
