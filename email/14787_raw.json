Well as Rob said it that is the danger of using code to\nillustrate your point (seeking help in my case :-)) \n\nI guess I should have rather written that method somewhat like :\n\npublic int someEarlierParam;\npublic void someMethod(int someParam) throws invalidParamException{\n   if(someParam!=1||someParam!=2)\n       throw invalidParamException\n\n   someParam++;\n   someEarlierParam += someParam;\n}\n\nAs I take it from the replies, each different task carried out by a\nmethod should be tested by a different test method ?? But I attempted\none test method to take care of several different tasks of a\nparticular method and found it working ok. I deliberately failed it\nfor one task at a time, and JUnit reported me precisely for which of\nthe task (I mean which of my assert&#39;s) the test method is failing. \nIf same thing can be accomplished both ways (writing separate test\nmethods as well as by writing a single one) then what is the advantage\nof writing separate ones ???\n\nThanks.\nNitesh Maan\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, Rob Biedenharn &lt;Rob_Biedenharn@a...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; At 9/13/2005 04:27 AM, you wrote:\n&gt; &gt;On Sunday 11 September 2005 20:31, xll_ll_ll_ll_ll_llx wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi all,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I am really really new with JUnit. Do excuse me if this question is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; too simple that it irritated you. OK so here is my confusion:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The method I want to test is something like this:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; public void someMethod(int someParam) throws invalidParamException\n&gt; &gt; &gt; {\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   if(someParam!=1||someParam!=2)\n&gt; &gt; &gt;         throw invalidParamException\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   someParam++;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; }\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Now this method will test someParam passed to it and if it gets\nstuck\n&gt; &gt; &gt; in the IF statement will throw exception else update someParam. Now\n&gt; &gt; &gt; what I wanna know is that the test method that I write to test a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; method like this should I be writing one test method that tests both\n&gt; &gt; &gt; whether exception is thrown correctly as well as someParam updated\n&gt; &gt; &gt; correctly. OR\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I should be writing one test method that tests for the exception and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; another that tests whether someParam is being updated appropriately.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;At least two methods.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Note that the update to `someParam` is pointless in the code you\n&gt; &gt;show. `someParam` is a local variable (specifically, an argument)\n&gt; &gt;of primitive type (int); when someMethod exits, someParam evaporates.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;--\n&gt; &gt;Chris &quot;electric hedgehog&quot; Dollin\n&gt; &gt;Logic is rational /re/construction. Life is construction.\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t know why I didn&#39;t see it before (well, yes I do, I wasn&#39;t \n&gt; looking!), but the example method simplifies to:\n&gt; public void someMethod(int someParam) throws invalidParamException {\n&gt;          throw new invalidParamException();\n&gt; }\n&gt; So it&#39;s trivial to test!  (Not to mention just plain trivial, but\nthat&#39;s \n&gt; the danger of trying to illustrate a point with &quot;code&quot;.  I&#39;m sure\nthat if \n&gt; one were to attempt to write a test for some observable behavior in\nplace \n&gt; of the &quot;someParam++;&quot;  (say, a call to some other method), even the \n&gt; original author would discover the problem with the condition as\nwritten.\n&gt; \n&gt; The problem with this type of code and the lack of tests is when\nsomeone \n&gt; changes the condition and the previously unreachable code (but not \n&gt; &quot;unreachable&quot; in a simple, static sense) can then be executed.  I\nknow I&#39;ve \n&gt; been bitten by that bug in the past.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Rob\n&gt; \n&gt; Rob Biedenharn  &lt;Rob_Biedenharn@a...&gt;\n&gt; (C) 513-295-4739\n&gt; (H) 513-677-2172        http://alum.mit.edu/www/rob_biedenharn/\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n\n\n",
