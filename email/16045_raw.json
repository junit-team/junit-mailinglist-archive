Pressure from above (AKA politics) will force people to sign up\nand agree to totally unrealistic schedules. So, quality goes out the door.\nThis is okay because most of the time the accounting looks at cost/schedule\nfor initial development. The accounting often does not track the costs for\nmaintenance. After all, they have to spend money on production support and\nmaintenance anyways.\n\nHiring consultants that bills by the author falls into this category.\n\n\n2) Out sourced for fixed price. Lets just say that the accounting dynamics\nhere are a lot different.\n\n\n&gt;As developers of desktop GUI applications\n&gt;(Swing/Eclipse SWT/WinForms .NET) - its a bit more difficult\n&gt;to test some of our code\n\nI realize that the following question does not belong in the JUnit mailing\nlist. However, request the favor of a quick indulgence. Would you be willing\nto share some url&#39;s that talk about testing Swing apps ?\n\n\n\n\n  -----Original Message-----\n  From: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com]On Behalf Of\nMark Levison\n  Sent: Thursday, February 09, 2006 8:40 PM\n  To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n  Subject: Re: [junit] Is Junit-based testing REALLY possible for commercial\nsoftware development ?\n\n\n  On 2/9/06, frank zou &lt;frankz1998@...&gt; wrote:\n  &gt;\n  &gt;\n  &gt; Hi all,\n  &gt;\n  &gt; After lots of reading and trying, I think I understand the following\n  &gt; benefits that Junit-base testing can give us:\n  &gt;\n  &gt; * more robust system\n  &gt; * clean / good design\n  &gt; * less regression bugs\n  &gt; * confidence to do refactorying, especially at the later phase of the\n  &gt; project.\n  &gt; * and lots more...\n  &gt;\n  &gt; These are really good things, for open-source projects where there is\n  &gt; no deadline pressure and resource could almost be thought as\n  &gt; un-limitted. However, for commercial software development, is this\n  &gt; still possible ?\n\n\n  Definitely - my team has been doing it for 5+ years, over several projects\n  spanning several languages. Our products while not bug free have fewer\nthan\n  many I&#39;ve known along the way. As developers of desktop GUI applications\n  (Swing/Eclipse SWT/WinForms .NET) - its a bit more difficult to test some\nof\n  our code - but none the less our overall test coverage has been around\n65%.\n  In the end I think it takes us less time not more to develop our products\n  writing tests. That said a few members of the team still need proding to\n  write their test cases.\n\n  * One intersting point I found is that after Junit-based testing is\n  &gt; introduced, programmers tend to use IDE debugger much less than\n  &gt; before.  This would save lots of time. Is that true ?\n\n\n  Yes very true - in fact when bugs show up in our GUI code I usually try to\n  write a test case to replicate them. When I have to debug its much faster\nto\n  debug from a test case than clicking around in the GUI.\n\n  * Some guys say JUnit is good for biz / util code testing. But for web\n  &gt; application development, where HTML/javascript would be root cause of\n  &gt; lots of bugs, Junit is not so powerful. Any comments ?\n\n\n  Lots of people do this sort of testing FIT (http://fit.c2.com/) or\nsimiliar\n  frameworks. I don&#39;t know much about it since I&#39;ve never done javascript.\n\n  * How can I convince managers and programmers that JUnit-based is\n  &gt; really possible for commercial software development ? Any differnece\n  &gt; from open-source projects ?\n\n\n  Show them the number of replies on this list? Also start writing tests in\n  you&#39;re own corner of the world. Integrate them into your build. Give a\nshort\n  live demo at lunch. Bring you&#39;re co-workers in for some pair programming,\n  .....\n\n\n  Cheers\n  Mark Levison\n  ----------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Blog: http://dotnetjunkies.com/WebLog/mlevison/\n\n\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n  SPONSORED LINKS Basic programming language  C programming language\nComputer programming languages\n        The c programming language  C programming language  List of\nprogramming languages\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n--\n  YAHOO!
