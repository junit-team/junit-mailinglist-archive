And a T3 manager is not going to provide an environment where\n&gt;  the T2 (the ones that require some time and encouragement) can become\n&gt;  test infected.   And this might explain why developer testing is still\n&gt;  practiced by a minority of developers in a minority of organizations.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Feedback?\n&gt;\n\nWhat I have seen more is that these developers become &quot;architects&quot;\nwhom design systems in such a manner that it makes it extremely\ndifficult for the T1 developer to begin developer testing.  The T1\ndeveloper is not allowed to refactor the &quot;architecture&quot; to aid testing\nand so to implement testing is actually very hard work and you end up\nbeing the only one who cares.  It&#39;s very frustrating.\n\nCheers\nShane\n\n",
