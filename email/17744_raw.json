Excess complexity\n&gt; \n&gt; They make receiving a message more complex, it&#39;s true.  They make  \n&gt; sending a message much simpler.  Or rather, they add more lines of  \n&gt; code on the receiving side; but they eliminate dependencies on the  \n&gt; sending side.  The benefit of those eliminated dependencies is very  \n&gt; powerful.\n&gt; \n\nI&#39;m not sure I believe the second part. In practice, replacing a \nconcrete-class based solution with an interface-based solution expands \nthe complexity for the caller. What used to require a single class now \ntypically requires three: a factory to create the factory, the factory \nitself, and the interface you&#39;re actually trying to create. I&#39;m not sure \nyou really need all that, but you need at least two pieces where you \npreviously needed one, and in practice three is what we usually seem to \nend up with. (Think of DocumentBuilderFactory, DocumentBuilder, and \nDocument in JAXP/DOM for example). And of course there are still \nconcrete classes for each of these. We&#39;ve turned what could have been \none concrete class (Document) into six separate pieces! What could have \nbeen this:\n\nDocument doc = new Document();\n\nis now this:\n\nDocumentBuilderFactory factory = DocumentBuilderFactory.getInstance();\nDocumentBuilder builder = factory.newDocumentBuilder();\nDocument doc = builder.newDocument();\n\nI fail to see how that&#39;s simpler.\n\n-- \n﻿Elliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nJava I/O 2nd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeaulait.org/books/javaio2/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596527500/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/\n\n",
