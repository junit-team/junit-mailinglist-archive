The GetOpt package contains an object<br/>\noriented mechanism for parsing arbitrarily complex types out of<br/>\ncommand-line options. It can and has also been applied to strings in<br/>\nproperties files.  Its main advantage is that it factors out and packages<br/>\ncommon parsing operations and syntax checking as well as putting all of<br/>\nthe error checking up front so that your application can just assume that<br/>\nthe runtime configuration is valid. The individual option type classes<br/>\n(integers, flags, strings, lists, etc) can be tested in isolation and<br/>\ntesting the application classes is correspondingly simplified.<br/>\n<br/>\nFeel free to use the framework if it appeals, or simply use it as an<br/>\nexample. Also feel free to ask me questions about the design, intent, or<br/>\nfuture directions of the package.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Tue, 18 Sep 2001, Paul Michali wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Vladimir Bossicard wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;In an effort to &quot;improve&quot; things, I thought that I could, for testing,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;use a string as the input stream for the properties and then just<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;use strings in the JUnit tests, insead of having a dozen property files.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The question is: what do you want to test?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 1) the loading of the properties files?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 2) the processing of the properties?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;I&#39;d really like to simplify the tests, as there are many properties<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;that I want to check to make sure they are processed correctly.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have properties like these:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; skip.empty.msgs = SLOW, DELAY<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; filter1.1 = some text to filter out for path #1<br/>\n&gt; filter1.2 = another filter on path 1<br/>\n&gt; filter2.1 = a filter for another path<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In the first property, I&#39;m parsing out the strings (SLOW and DELAY). In<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; rest of the properties, I&#39;m looking first to see if they exist and then<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; collecting all the entries for each path and putting them into a List of<br/>\n&gt; String. There are others, but this is the gist of what I&#39;m dealing with.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I think the answer is 2...  What I would do is simply create a Propertie<br/>\n&gt; &gt; object and fill it with values.  You will easily test your methods<br/>\n&gt; &gt; without having dozen of files everywhere.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Interesting idea. You&#39;re saying to create a Properties object and then<br/>\n&gt; &quot;set&quot; the values as I want and to then process them. That would do some<br/>\n&gt; of the testing. However, I also need to make sure some mandatory<br/>\n&gt; Properties<br/>\n&gt; are there and have values assigned as well.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; PCM (Paul Michali)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Carrier Voice Gateway Business Unit (CVGBU)<br/>\n&gt; Cisco Systems, Inc.<br/>\n&gt; 250 Apollo Drive<br/>\n&gt; Chelmsford, MA 01824<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Phone : (800) 572-6771 x 45817  (978) 244-5817 [direct]<br/>\n&gt; Paging: (800) 365-4578 [voice]  pcm@...
