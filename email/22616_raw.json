This=\r\n enables the tests to become more valuable by executing in parallel, sortin=\r\ng by likelihood of failure, and creating false negative results less often =\r\njust because someone changed the order of declaration in a file. So the sho=\r\nrt answer is that no, JUnit doesn&#39;t support the kind of ordering you are ta=\r\nlking about. I&#39;m sure you could make it work, but you&#39;d be going against th=\r\ne grain of the design.\n\nIn my experience the best way to express sequence i=\r\ns with adjacent lines of code:\n\ncreateOrder();\nsubmitOrder();\n\nUnderneath I=\r\n could implement these with Command objects or whatever was most appropriat=\r\ne.\n\nRegards,\n\nKent\n\n\nOn Apr 15, 2010, at 6:05 AM, yvesd.public wrote:\n\n&gt; He=\r\nllo dear JUnit community.\n&gt; \n&gt; My name is Yves Dessertine and I am new to J=\r\nUnit.
