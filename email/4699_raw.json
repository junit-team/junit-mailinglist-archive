My explanation was like this:\n\nJUnit itself is not so important(forgive me if I&#39;m arrogant here);it\nis the test-first development style and adhering to the style that\nmatters. Today you can write executable and automated test cases to\nenfoce the style, and using JUnit is one solution.If there&#39;s widely-accepted\none, why not use it instead of writing your own with non-overlookable\ntime( and cost).\n\n\nMight be a pointless, though hope this helps.\nRegards,\nShunsuke Masuda\n\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;arathi.bhaskar@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;junit@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Wednesday, April 17, 2002 8:38 PM\nSubject: [junit] Junit&#39;s Importance\n\n\n&gt; Hi\n&gt;\n&gt; I am familiar with Junit for a month or two month. I have also started to\n&gt; look into Cactus project for servlet testing. I am one of the very few\n&gt; people in the organization to know about this & want to share Junit&#39;s\n&gt; features & advantages with others & convince them of its use. I have\ntested\n&gt; some Java programs with Junit. I gave a presentation to my managar, to see\n&gt; if we can pilot the use of Junit in some project.\n&gt;\n&gt; Can someone tell me the real advantages of using Junit over the\n&gt; individual&#39;s own Unit testing of the Java Code written by him. I have been\n&gt; reading the articles posted on Junit homepage. Where can I find more\n&gt; articles giving the advantages of Junit.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks & Regards\n&gt; Arathi\n&gt;\n&gt; -----------------------Disclaimer------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; The views of the author may not necessarily reflect those\n&gt; of the Company.
