    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1211561361\">On 2/13/07, Michael Feathers &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mfeathers@...\">mfeathers@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;Doesn&#39;t this implicitly imply that unit testing is optional, since you can<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;achieve the same goal with functional tests?<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;Functional tests are here for the user&#39;s comfort, unit tests are here for<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;the programmer&#39;s comfort.  Sure, my coverage can tell me that a certain part<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;of my application is tested indirectly, but if I don&#39;t have unit tests for<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;them, locating the bug will be harder for me since there will be multiple<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;suspects for the location of the bug.<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;Consider the following example:  I have to display a sorted list in a web<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;page, and I only have a functional test that verifies that the HTML is<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;correct.  My coverage confirms that my ordering logic is run during the<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;tests.  In this situation, the ordering logic is private and not directly<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;tested.<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;A user reports that the list is not sorted correctly, and now I find myself<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;with at least two possible locations to investigate:  the HTML generation<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;and the sorting logic.<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;If I had written a test for the private sorting logic, I would know right<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;away where the bug is.<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  True enough, but there&#39;s no particular reason why the logic has to be<br/>\n&gt;  private. I&#39;d be leery of a class that generates HTML and sorts. If the<br/>\n&gt;  sort is an another class, it can be public and far easier to test.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sure, but that&#39;s a different side to the story.  I was just responding<br/>\nto Bob&#39;s point, which was basically saying &quot;as long as I have coverage<br/>\nto indicate that my code is run, I can skip a few unit tests&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s true from a functional standpoint, but as I pointed, you, as a<br/>\nprogrammer, do lose some comfort when you replace unit testing with<br/>\ncode coverage, since finding bugs will be made more difficult.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nCédric<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://testng.org\">http://testng.org</a></div>",
