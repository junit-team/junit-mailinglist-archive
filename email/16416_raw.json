So you have to direct Ant to that \nfile. E.g.\n\n      ant -lib /usr/local/java/junit3.8.1/junit.jar test\n\nThe &#39;junit.jar&#39; is also bundled with NetBeans so you can also use it:\n\n      ant -lib /apps/NetBeans-5.0/ide6/modules/ext/junit-3.8.1.jar\n\nIn the next version of NetBeans, following NB 5.5, it should be possible \nto run a test without the -lib ... switch thanks to an improvement of \nthe junit.jar library.\n\n\nAs for generating report files, there is no direct support for this in \nNetBeans. The output generated by the test is put the to NetBeans output \nwindow so you can copy it from there - no need to run the tests from a \ncommand line.\n\nTo get a nice report, you can modify you project&#39;s build.xml file as \ndescribed in John C.&#39;s blog: \nhttp://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/johnc?entry=give_your_junit_test_results\n\nMarian\n\n\nPat Farrell wrote:\n&gt; I&#39;ve had great luck with NB 5.0 and junit on my project.\n&gt; But the output goes to the &#39;statistics&#39; window\n&gt; and that can&#39;t be cut and pasted using normal X conventions.\n&gt; (I&#39;m running it on a Mandrivia 2006 box with JRE 5.0)\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;d really love to be able to pipe the output of the\n&gt; statistics page so I can send the great results off\n&gt; the my pointy haired bosses.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve connected to my project&#39;s main directory, where the\n&gt; build.xml is (and above the nbproject directories)\n&gt; \n&gt; ant test\n&gt; and nearly anything else I can try gets a long message\n&gt; from ant\n&gt; \n&gt; starting out with\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; BUILD FAILED\n&gt; /home/pfarrell/aframe/sandbox/src/server/AFrameLib/nbproject/build-impl.xml:459:\n&gt; The following error occurred while executing this line:\n&gt; /home/pfarrell/aframe/sandbox/src/server/AFrameLib/nbproject/build-impl.xml:140:\n&gt; Could not create task or type of type: junit.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ant could not find the task or a class this task relies upon.\n&gt; \n&gt; This is common and has a number of causes; the usual\n&gt; solutions are to read the manual pages then download and\n&gt; install needed JAR files, or fix the build file:\n&gt;  - You have misspelt &#39;junit&#39;.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [snip]\n&gt; \n&gt; Any clues?\n&gt; \n&gt; thanks\n&gt; Pat\n\n\n\n\n",
