But we can think of three good reasons why this is undesirable: <br/>\n    <br/>\n   It is necessary to set up all the client JNDI properties in the test cases, making it a pain to run against several different test servers.   <br/>\n   If your production clients are servlets running inside the app server, your tests could be affected by being run in a different execution environment.   <br/>\n   It is not possible to unit test your non-EJB web-application components. <br/>\n  thank u<br/>\n  swetha<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;J.
