I recently tried to get JBuilder 5 working with the new Java 1.4<br/>\nbeta2 (to no avail - but that&#39;s another problem) so switched all the<br/>\nsettings back to Java 1.3. However since I did this I now find that the<br/>\n&#39;reload classes before each run&#39; on junit does not work!<br/>\n<br/>\nHas anyone experienced a similar problem?</div>",
