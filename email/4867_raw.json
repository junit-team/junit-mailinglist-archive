By looking at it\n&gt; I\n&gt; assume...\n\nWell, yes. I&#39;m assuming that I wrote both the tests and the production code to \npass it. This point was merely stating the obvious.\n\n&gt; &gt; * Are sufficiently implementation-independent to support easier\n&gt; refactoring\n&gt; \n&gt; When your tests only use the public interfaces they usually don&#39;t\n&gt; break\n&gt; during refactoring. They might become redundant, i.e. worthless, when\n&gt; you\n&gt; test a special case which is no special case in the new refactored\n&gt; implementation any more.\n\nRedundant is *not* worthless in this case! If you refactor again, later, the \nredundant tests may no longer be redundant. That was the thrust of this second \npoint: it&#39;s not enough to cover the current implementation, one must try to \ncover the problem with one&#39;s tests. The idea is to have a set of tests that \nwould indicate whether any reasonable implementation of the feature would work. \nI&#39;m not saying that this is easy.\n\n&gt; &gt; * Run quickly, are small, easy to read...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I realize that these are competing forces, so the challenge is\n&gt; striking\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; right balance. I find my life difficult when my tests get in the way\n&gt; of my\n&gt; &gt; refactorings... tests that have intimate knowledge of the\n&gt; implementation\n&gt; tend\n&gt; &gt; to be refactoring-resistant. I tend away from them if I can.\n&gt; \n&gt; That&#39;s a very [g]ood heuristic for deciding if it&#39;s worth writing a test\n&gt; or\n&gt; not: asking if the test will probably stay around with the next\n&gt; functionality or not. This is my biggest concern I have with doing\n&gt; endo-testing using mock objects.\n&gt; \n&gt; Where do you think our views still differ?\n\nI&#39;m not sure they do, and I wasn&#39;t necessarily trying to get into a long \ndiscussion of white box v. black box. JUnit allows both, and anyway, one man&#39;s \nblack box is another man&#39;s white box.\n\nJ. B.
