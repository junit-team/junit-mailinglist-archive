It was\nreally strange because the tests from other modules were running but these\nweren&#39;t (and they all shared the same dependencies).\n\nThe root of the problem was that the test classes were named something other\nthan the standard, so instead of having MyClassTest.java, they were named\nMyClassTester.java (I didn&#39;t create them). Once I changed them to the\nformer, they all ran like they were supposed to.\n\nHowever, I do think this might be a bug in the maven-surefire-plugin code.\nWhen using annotations, it shouldn&#39;t matter what the class is named,\nsurefire should be able to &quot;introspect&quot; all methods that are annotated with\n@Test.\n\nI guess I could also try to modify the pom to find &#39;**/*Tester.java&#39; classes\nfor testing, but I try to avoid explicitly setting things as much as I can.\n\nRegards,\n-- \nView this message in context: http://old.nabble.com/maven2-with-Junit-4-ignores-%40Test-annotations-tp17548499p26125017.html\nSent from the JUnit - User mailing list archive at Nabble.com.\n\n\n",
