Would you share<br/>\nsome successful strategy by which you accomplished in doing that?<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you,<br/>\nLuca Sfarzo<br/>\nTRSNeapolis<br/>\nTel:+390815272842<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Messaggio originale-----<br/>\nDa: Timothy Wall [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:twall@...\">twall@...</a>]<br/>\nInviato: martedi 11 giugno 2002 16.12<br/>\nA: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nOggetto: Re: R: [junit] gui testing<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOr try this (a real-world case):<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m editing a field in my form, and something happens asynchronously<br/>\nsuch that the action of editing a field in the form is no longer valid.<br/>\nThere are several options of what to do at the interface level (with<br/>\nvarying degrees of UI acceptableness and programmatic complexity), but<br/>\nyour mediator knows nothing of the editor, nor of how it relates to the<br/>\nform, or of any other transient objects that may be introduced (dialogs,<br/>\nswapped-out panes) in order to rectify the situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe programmatic easy-to-test solution may not be the one required for<br/>\nusability of the UI.<br/>\n<br/>\n...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!
