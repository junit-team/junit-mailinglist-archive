After\ncalling the setter, make your assertions about the exceptions, error\ncodes, or whatever it is you&#39;re returning if the validation fails. \nYou may have known that part already.\n\nSo how do you test the objects created when validation passes?  You&#39;ve\ngot black-box and white-box approaches.  I prefer black-box as a first\ntry, but that&#39;s mostly because I write the tests first, so the code is\nreally more of an empty box :P\n\nTo do this black-box-style, look to the other access points to your\nclass.  You mention that the private collection is full of\nInternetAddress objects.  Does your class communicate these to a mail\nbroker object?  Can you pass in a mock implementation of that object\nthat records what it&#39;s been told?  Here&#39;s a pseudocode example:\n\nMockCommunicationsBroker broker = new MockCommunicationsBroker();\nMailSender mailSender = new MailSender(broker); //class under test --\ngiven the mock broker\n\nCollection goodValues = getGoodValues();//however you get your test data\nmailSender.setRecipients(goodValues);\nmailSender.send();  //presumably interacts with the broker\n\nCollection generatedRecipients = broker.getRecipients();\nassertEquals(&quot;Wrong recipients&quot;,expectedValues,generatedRecipients); \n//hand converted expected values that match the input to the setter\n\nA white-box approach would be to make your private collection\nprotected or use reflection and a lax security profile to &quot;reach\ninside&quot; and access them directly.  Not as useful for refactoring, and\na little less &quot;pure&quot;, but easier to implement.\n\n-Kevin\n\nOn Wed, 26 Jan 2005 14:39:00 -0500, Soaring Eagle\n&lt;comfortable.numb@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; Hello,\n&gt; \n&gt; Please bear with me if this is an old oft answered question.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have a void method which takes in a java.util.Collection parameter -\n&gt; filled with Strings, performs some validations and sets a private\n&gt; member that is also a collection - filled with\n&gt; javax.mail.InternetAddress.
