The reason I am going\nto all of this trouble to point out your various posts is to make it clear to\nyou that you can search the archives as well.  There is a wealth of knowledge\nthere!  Asking a question is never &quot;bad&quot; per se, it&#39;s just that it would be\nmore considerate of you to search the archives (and even the Wiki --\nhttp://c2.com/cgi/wiki?JavaUnit) first, rather than reposting the same old\nquestions to the list every time.\n\nI hope you aren&#39;t offended by this, but rather that you take the opportunity to\nlearn how to more effectively use the list.  You can also read about how to ask\nquestions the smart way at http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html\n\n=jason\n\n************************************\n\nHi\n\nMy name is Bhanu prakash. i have follwing clarifications.\n\n1) why actuall teardown() method is required.\n\n2) when i call tearDown() method it is making objects as null. though\ni am not making the objects as null. what is the reason.\n\n3) how to write a log file if any of them have the code to make the log\nfile please forword to me.\n\nregards Bhanu\n\n----\n\nhello\nmy name is bhanu. i have following clarifications\n1) is their any tool for unit testing other than junit. which is free\n2) is their any tool which can be used system testing\nregarads\nBhanu\n\n----\n\nhi friends\n\ni have not able to do the following task which are as follows.\n\n1) how to catch errors in junit. what i mean is how to create a log file.\nif any body have the code please mail to me its urgent.\n2) how to check the private methods in java. for example i have a\nprivate int a()\n{}\nprivate int b()\n{}\npublic void c ()\n{\na();\nb();\n}\nhow to write a test case.\n\n3) are their any web testing tools which are free,\n4) are their any testing tools for integrating test, stress testing in\nfact system testing\nregards\nBhanu\n--\nBhanu Prakash\n\n----\n\nhi friends\njust i have a small things to ask\n1) how to test private methods\n2) how to catch test result and store in the file. please if any body\nhave the program please send me as attachment.\n3) how to test the methods with return the arraylist and object\n\n=====\n-----------------------------------------\n             Keep it simple...\n(1 Corinthians 2:2, Galatians 2:20, 6:14)\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTry FREE Yahoo!
