If so I&#39;d agree that&#39;s brain-damaged. You\n&gt; should be able to change these parts of the class.\n\nNo; rather they do it by assuming that all methods might be invoked by \nbrain-dead clients who haphazardly pass invalid data around to each \nother. In APIs I publish in class libraries, I worry about that; but in \ncode used by other code my team writes, I am less worried. As I often \nsay -- which I steal from others -- if I pass me null, the invoker is \nprobably broken, and not the invoked.\n&gt; \n&gt; However, if the problem id that they&#39;re tying you too much to the public\n&gt; parts of a class, then I suspect that&#39;s an indication that too much of\n&gt; the class is public.\n\nIndeed... I prefer to use interface/implementation separation over \npublic/private separation. Funny thing: the more interface-rich my \ndesigns are, the less concern there is over too much of a class being \npublic, because collaborators rely on each other mostly through \nnarrowing interfaces.\n-- \nJ.
