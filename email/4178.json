I don&#39;t think so.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What do you think is the right way?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>throw an IllegalArgumentException when your method receives an argument <br/>\nthat is illegal (or you can also exit the method, but this won&#39;t give <br/>\nmuch information to the calling method).<br/>\n<br/>\nSome words about the assert keyword in JDK1.4:<br/>\n<br/>\nUnit testing is good but having unit tested your program is not a proof <br/>\nthat there is no bug in your program.  And having a 100% coverage is not <br/>\na proof, just a sign that you have to use another testing strategy to <br/>\nfind other bugs.<br/>\n<br/>\nEvery test strategy has its limits, so does unit testing.  Typically in <br/>\nunit testing, _you_ set the object to a particular state and then apply <br/>\nthe method you test.  But what happens if your object is not in that <br/>\nparticular state before the method is called?  How many times did you <br/>\nfind bugs that were discovered only because the system was in a <br/>\nparticular state?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you use the assert keyword to ensure that your system is in a valid <br/>\nstate, you will be able (hopefully) to detect bugs that are not due to <br/>\nthe object&#39;s method but to the object&#39;s state.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Vladimir<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nVladimir Bossicard<br/>\nwww.bossicard.com</div>",
