It would be very powerful. I&#39;m having trouble\n&gt;&gt; understanding what you would use it for beyond what you can do with\n&gt;&gt; @Before/@After and @BeforeClass and @AfterClass, though. Do you have an\n&gt;&gt; example?\n&gt; \n&gt; Kent,\n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s not so much that I think it couldn&#39;t be done with the existing \n&gt; annotations, as that it would be more elegant if a decorator annotation was \n&gt; directly available.\n&gt; \n&gt; An example that I&#39;ve got right at hand is a decorator I used to set up the \n&gt; JNDI space with mock objects, so that the code-under-test had access to \n&gt; expected resources. I used a decorator, rather than a base class, because I \n&gt; needed this to be available across several different test hierarchies, some \n&gt; of which already extended from different sub-class of TestCase. An \n&gt; alternative would have been to use a duplicated setUp() method. But this \n&gt; was ugly duplication... Another good example would be for using IoC \n&gt; techniques on the test itself.\n&gt; \n&gt; With the @Before/@After annotations, I could do something similar. But it \n&gt; would still be duplication that would be annoying. With an annotation \n&gt; decorator I&#39;d be able to reduce that duplication to a single declaration of \n&gt; intent.\n&gt; \n&gt; More generally, however, I&#39;d like a way to extend JUnit without fighting \n&gt; it. There are some powerful techniques in JUnit 3.8 that I wouldn&#39;t want to \n&gt; lose, for example - one such is the ability to programatically create test \n&gt; cases (see http://twasink.net/blog/archives/2003/10/junit_and_datad.html \n&gt; for more on this - or Chapter 4.8 of JB Rainsberger&#39;s &quot;JUnit Recipes&quot;). In \n&gt; JUnit 4, there appears to be no way to do the same thing; I&#39;d be forced to \n&gt; have a single test, which read the data file iteratively - needless to say, \n&gt; this wouldn&#39;t give me the same level of granularity in reports.\n&gt; \n&gt; In fact, in order to get the same level of flexibility in JUnit 4 as is in \n&gt; JUnit 3, you&#39;d need at the very least to give an equivalent of the suite() \n&gt; method - currently, there is no way to change the way that test instances \n&gt; are obtained. Perhaps a test class could define a TestFactory annotation, \n&gt; which would default to the TestInstropector?\n&gt; \n&gt; (Actually, for the ultimate in flexibility, you&#39;d need to provide a way to \n&gt; change the runner strategy, too - but that&#39;s probably overkill)\n&gt; \n&gt; Ultimately, what I would like to be able to do is have equivalents of \n&gt; popular JUnit extensions, such as DBUnit, ServletUnit, and JUnitPerf, which \n&gt; are configured using annotations rather than base classes. The annotations \n&gt; currently in JUnit 4 wouldn&#39;t allow this.\n&gt; \n&gt; (Cedric, if you&#39;re reading this... every one of these points applies to \n&gt; TestNG as well)\n&gt; \n\nI am not sure which ones are not _already_ available ;-). I will pass again through it to check.\n\n:alex |.::the_mindstorm::.|\n\n",
