My personal opinion is that it is a\n&gt;matter of choosing the right tool for the task at hand, sometimes mock\n&gt;objects will be better, other times Cactus should get the nod (particularly\n&gt;for testing against multiple app servers in a running environment - which\n&gt;is more functional testing than unit testing anyway).\n&gt;\n&gt;Robert\n&gt;\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n",
