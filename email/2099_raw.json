A test fails or it passes.  Period.\n\nIf you want more, JUnit is probably not the framework to use.  The framework\nis not meant to give warm fuzzy feelings (interpretation of green bar),\npains in the gut (interpretation of red bar), or minor headaches (amber\nbar?).  It is meant to tell you whether or not the code works the way you\nthink it should.  It&#39;s a SIMPLE framework for developers and testers, not a\nbogus-meet-all-levels-of-satisfaction-and-feel-goods reporting tool.\n\nSorry for the outburst of frustration.\n-Jason\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: dror2@... [mailto:dror2@...]\nSent: Wednesday, July 25, 2001 7:04 AM\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: RE: [junit] Reporting more then 1 failed assertion per test\n\n\n\nWhat I think is brought up here is a request for &quot;warning&quot; or\n&quot;soft-assertion&quot; level, which is lower than Failure or Error. \nwarn() should have the interface of assert(), except that it does not throw\nan exception, merely count it. It might still create a Throwable object\n(without throwing it), just to have  a stack-trace handy. \n\n\n\n\nVladimir Bossicard &lt;vladimir@...&gt; \n24/07/2001 23:56 \nPlease respond to junit \n        \n        To:        junit@yahoogroups.com \n        cc:         \n        Subject:        RE: [junit] Reporting more then 1 failed assertion\nper test\n\n\n\n&gt; I think it would be useful in certain cases, sort of\n&gt; like &quot;make -k&quot; (keep going if an error is found).\n\nThis is not possible with JUnit because JUnit throws an exception when an\nassertion is not &quot;true&quot;.  When an exception is thrown, &quot;the normal flow of\nthe program is interrupted and that the runtime environment attempts to find\nan exception handler--a block of code that can handle a particular type of\nerror.&quot; (Java Tutorial)  So the next assertion is not executed.\n\nTo &quot;correct&quot; that, you have to change the framework (record the errors and\nthrow an exception at the end of the test method).  But I really don&#39;t think\nthat this will solve problems:\n\n   assertTrue(obj != null);\n  assertTrue(obj.status() == 3);\n\nif obj is null and you evaluate the next assert, the &quot;NullPointerException&quot;\ndoesn&#39;t help much.\n\n-Vladimir\n\n\n\n\n\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\njunit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n\n\nYour use of Yahoo!
