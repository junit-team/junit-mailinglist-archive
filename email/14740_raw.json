We&#39;re discussing the code _you_ can write, which _you_ \n&gt; can control - if you want to have a runtime and API jar, only you are \n&gt; stopping you.\n\nPure pragmatism. Solutions based on language features are more likely to \nbe adopted than solutions based on extra-language design decisions. \nAgain, if extra-language conventions were enough, we wouldn&#39;t have \nneeded Java or C++. You can write object oriented code in C. You just \ncan&#39;t enforce it.\n\nApparently some people on this list believe they do want a language \nwithout access protection. It would be interesting to explore such a \nlanguage, and if practice proved it useful, they might even convince me. \nHowever, that would be a new language. not Java. Access protection is a \nfairly fundamental part of Java. You&#39;ll have more success working with \nthe language than against it.\n\n-- \n﻿Elliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nXML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim\n\n",
