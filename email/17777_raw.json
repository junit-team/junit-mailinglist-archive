We were talking about it the other week while we were \nworking together. I haven&#39;t had a chance to try it yet, but I think that \nthe notion of embedding a language inside annotations is very interesting.\n\nMichael\n\nRay V wrote:\n\n&gt;I wonder what you guys think of Contract4J:\n&gt;http://www.contract4j.org/contract4j\n&gt;\n&gt;It combines an annotation based design by contract\n&gt;approach with the &quot;fail fast&quot; philosophy, and can be\n&gt;turned off (like assertions) when it&#39;s time to deploy.\n&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;It seems very complimentary to unit testing, and would\n&gt;help in doing less defensive programming.  I&#39;ve been\n&gt;curious about this tool for a while, but have yet to\n&gt;use it myself on a real project.\n&gt;\n&gt;--- Cédric Beust ♔  &lt;cbeust@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;On 9/4/06, Elliotte Harold &lt;elharo@...&gt;\n&gt;&gt;wrote:\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Yes, I do have a copy. I suspect you&#39;re referring\n&gt;&gt;&gt;      \n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;to p. 343-344. However\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;you have to remember that Meyer is writing about a\n&gt;&gt;&gt;      \n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;language in which\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;preconditions can be specified *and enforced*\n&gt;&gt;&gt;      \n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;outside the body of the\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;method. Since Java, unlike Eiffel, does not\n&gt;&gt;&gt;      \n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;provide extra-method\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;preconditions it is therefore necessary to place\n&gt;&gt;&gt;      \n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;the verification code\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;in the method body. It&#39;s not ideal, but Java is\n&gt;&gt;&gt;      \n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;not an ideal language.\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Furthermore, for most cases, Meyer recommends\n&gt;&gt;&gt;      \n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;precondition verification\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;by default. See pp. 394-398\n&gt;&gt;&gt;      \n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;I am really not convinced that Meyer&#39;s approach, and\n&gt;&gt;Design by Contract in\n&gt;&gt;general, is really relevant to the real world.  I\n&gt;&gt;blogged about it a few\n&gt;&gt;years ago here\n&gt;&gt;&lt;http://www.jroller.com/page/cbeust/20021213&gt;, and\n&gt;&gt;my\n&gt;&gt;conclusion was that preconditions, post-conditions\n&gt;&gt;and invariants were\n&gt;&gt;usually either one of these:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;   - Super simple, and better put in an assert.\n&gt;&gt;   - Super complex, and better left to testing.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;I also noticed that most of the methods that I write\n&gt;&gt;simply don&#39;t have any\n&gt;&gt;invariant that can be easily expressed, so I have\n&gt;&gt;yet to see a convincing\n&gt;&gt;example of Design by Contract on a project of more\n&gt;&gt;than a few thousands of\n&gt;&gt;lines...  (incidentally, most of the Eiffel code\n&gt;&gt;that I worked with and read\n&gt;&gt;was pretty bad and wouldn&#39;t pass today&#39;s standards).\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;-- \n&gt;&gt;C�dric\n&gt;&gt;http://testng.org\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;[Non-text portions of this message have been\n&gt;&gt;removed]\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;__________________________________________________\n&gt;Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt;Tired of spam?
