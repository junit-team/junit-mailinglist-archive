Because many of the methodologies <br/>\n&gt; &gt; suggested for <br/>\n&gt; &gt; unit testing aren&#39;t applicable to this sort of testing.  Have <br/>\n&gt; &gt; the xUnit <br/>\n&gt; &gt; people, or anyone else for that matter, addressed this problem<br/>\n&gt; space?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hi,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am currently co-writing a practitioners report submission for the<br/>\n&gt; XP2002<br/>\n&gt; conference about our[*] experiences with acceptance testing. We&#39;ve got<br/>\n&gt; a<br/>\n&gt; testing framework that&#39;s not based on JUnit at all, and we think it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; working very well.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We force the application to operate in batch mode while we acceptance<br/>\n&gt; test<br/>\n&gt; it, provide input from file/standard input redirects, and collect all<br/>\n&gt; output<br/>\n&gt; as text files. We then have the full power of unix text processing<br/>\n&gt; commands<br/>\n&gt; (ie diff) to analyse and compare the output to previous runs. Basically,<br/>\n&gt; if<br/>\n&gt; the output is different, the test fails.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>&lt;snip /&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy last recommendation to IBM&#39;s e-commerce organization, before I left, was to <br/>\nimplement something similar for their system. They have been struggling with <br/>\nautomating test cases because they have focussed on automating tests through <br/>\nthe browser interface, when usually they want to test the application&#39;s <br/>\nbusiness behavior. I didn&#39;t think about distributing the test execution at the <br/>\ntime, so that&#39;s quite neat.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough not everyone agrees that test-oriented design tends to lead to better <br/>\ndesign overall, I think that refactoring a system to allow this text-based, <br/>\nbatch operation has a strong chance of resulting in a more highly change-<br/>\nresistant design.<br/>\n<br/>\nJ.
