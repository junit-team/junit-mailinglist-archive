However, the design of\nJUnit has made it extremely simple to use for the other two types of\ntesting I referred to.  That being said, I don&#39;t believe this request\nshould be embodied in JUnit-proper.  Let it be an add-on feature.  I\nwould even argue to remove TestSetup once people get used to using\nVladimir&#39;s Add-Ons project in SourceForge (or sooner, since most folks\nwon&#39;t embrace change without some force to move them from their current\npath -- the 2nd law of thermodynamics I believe).\n \n=jason\n[:question | ^One]\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: kentlbeck [mailto:kentbeck@...] \nSent: Monday, September 23, 2002 2:20 PM\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: [junit] Re: Adding setUp() and tearDown() to TestSuite\n\n\n--- In junit@y..., &quot;David Vydra&quot; &lt;yahoogroups@v...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; I would like to get the group&#39;s opinion about adding setUp() and \n&gt; tearDown() methods to the TestSuite class. I think it has several \n&gt; advantages:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. It makes it similar to TestCase\n&gt; 2. It makes it easier for QA engineers, who may not feel \ncomfortable \n&gt; with a decorator like TestSetup (no offense meant to QA engineers \nwho \n&gt; do)\n&gt; 3. Sometimes you need to access the suite in the composite after \nit \n&gt; was wrapped in TestSetup.\n\nThe first design principle of xUnit (good or bad) is independence of \ntests. TestSetup is a step away from that, which I regret. The need \nfor shared setup is IME always a design problem. Solving it by \nwriting tests differently is the first step on a slippery slope to \nmaking the tests less valuable to programmers.\n\nKent\n\n\n\nYahoo!
