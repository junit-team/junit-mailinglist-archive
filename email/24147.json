Is is possible, or not? Looking<br/>\n&gt; at the source code, it might just look impossible, but maybe someone<br/>\n&gt; knows something I don&#39;t?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It is possible, but you might need to write your own Runner.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had a pull request a while back that allowed you to designate groups of<br/>\nmethods that must &quot;happen before&quot; other methods but would not dictate the<br/>\nsequence within that graph, but then we lost interest it pursuing that line<br/>\nof testing.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;     * If I may, could I ask you to clarify your question into either<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Cannot be done&quot; or &quot;Yes. It&#39;s discouraged, you do it by...&quot;?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And of course, from there on it gets messy :-)<br/>\n&gt; I know that JUnit doesn&#39;t encourage dependent test, and if our IDE of<br/>\n&gt; choice had better support for Testng (who doesn&#39;t have this particular<br/>\n&gt; sentiment),<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>JUnit sees itself as purely for Unit tests.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnit tests by their very nature are supposed to be fast, so if your test<br/>\nrequires setup from a previous test... just invoke the previous test as<br/>\nyour first step in your &quot;dependent&quot; test, so you&#39;ll have something like<br/>\n<br/>\npublic class FooTest {<br/>\n<br/>\n  private Foo instance = new Foo();<br/>\n<br/>\n  @Test<br/>\n  public void something() throws Exception {<br/>\n    ...<br/>\n    assertThat(instance, is(inWonderfulState()));<br/>\n  }<br/>\n<br/>\n  @Test<br/>\n  public void whenInWonderfulStateWidgetsAreBevelled() throws Exception {<br/>\n    something();<br/>\n    instance.addWidget(new Widget());<br/>\n    assertThat(instance.getWidgets(), ... );<br/>\n  }<br/>\n<br/>\n  @Test<br/>\n  public void bevelledWidgetsOfAWonderfulFooAre5mm() throws Exception {<br/>\n    whenInWonderfulStateWidgetsAreBevelled();<br/>\n    ...<br/>\n  }<br/>\n<br/>\n  ...<br/>\n}<br/>\n<br/>\nIt doesn&#39;t matter what order the above tests are run, and dependencies are<br/>\nclearly called out. OK, so the something() method gets invoked 3 times, but<br/>\nthese are Unit tests, so it doesn&#39;t matter, and you have clean setup of the<br/>\nfresh Foo instance created for each run.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, by the way, true JUnit style is *one* assert per test method... ok<br/>\nnobody does that all the time... though when I have done it it has proved<br/>\nreally useful.<br/>\n<br/>\nTestNG cares about more than just Unit tests... when you hit more<br/>\nheavyweight tests, then you need to care about test sequencing as you<br/>\nreally want to try and keep the number of asserts per method down so that<br/>\nyou get a fine grained view of test failures.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I have wanted to see in JUnit is a way to mark smoke tests for<br/>\nfeatures. If the smoke test fails then all the tests that cover that<br/>\nfeature would be skipped.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe danger of such support is that it would be tempting to abuse for<br/>\nsequencing tests ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n-Stephen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; we&#39;d just go down that route. But it doesn&#39;t, and now JUnit<br/>\n&gt; does support ordering, so we&#39;re trying to adapt to that.<br/>\n&gt; With JUnit 4.11, we&#39;ve got a way. If we find a way to create our own<br/>\n&gt; MethodSorter (which I hope for), we&#39;re good. If JUnit should provide its<br/>\n&gt; own mechanism (which I might dream of, but not hope for), it would be<br/>\n&gt; even better. Until then, method names are it, and now we&#39;ve got methods<br/>\n&gt; named &quot;test01_insert&quot; and &quot;test02_copy&quot;. It&#39;s not ideal, and I&#39;m a bit<br/>\n&gt; sad that the test framework insists so hard to not support us in our<br/>\n&gt; usage pattern, but I think that ship has sailed.<br/>\n&gt; Eirik<br/>\n&gt; --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, Matthew Farwell &lt;matthew@...&gt; wrote:&gt; Hi,&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve just answered your question on Stack Overflow&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13723125/create-my-own-methodsorter-f&#92;\">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13723125/create-my-own-methodsorter-f&#92;</a><br/>\n&gt; or-junits-fixmethodorder&gt; &gt; 2012/12/5 Eirik Lygre &lt;eirik.lygre@...&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m looking at creating my own MethodSorter.
