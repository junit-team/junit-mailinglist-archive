If the client is a remote object, then the server will \nencounter a RemoteException as soon as it tries to use something from \nthe clients remote interface*.\n\nIf the client is _not_ a remote object, then RMI provides pass by value \nsemantics. In other words, the server jvm gets its own copy of the \nclient object & the life-cycle of the original client object is \nunimportant.\n\nRMI supports/manages distributed GC. If both sides no longer reference \nan object, then that object is eligble for GC. Moreover, distributed GC \nrules == local GC rules. The only caveat I experienced in the \ndistributed scenario is that the naming service holds a reference to my \nserver object indefinitely. In most cases, this is probably a benefit. \n(ie. you don&#39;t want your remote object/server GC&#39;d when clients are \nexpecting to use it.)\n\n-- Levi\n\n\n* In my experiments toString(), equals(), and hashcode() are always \ncallable. These messages are serviced by the Client_Stub & don&#39;t lead \nto remote communication.\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
