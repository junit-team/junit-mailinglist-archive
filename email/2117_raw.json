If the Comparator argument is null the\n&gt; compareTo() on the elements is called.\n&gt;\n&gt; I am not sure what use an assertGreaterThan( Collection, Collection)\n&gt; makes much sense.   In mathematics it&#39;s not possible to say one vector\n&gt; is greater than another, unless they are projected onto a given axis.\n&gt; This is not really possible on your average collection of objects.\n&gt;\n&gt; I think the only two useful cases are...\n&gt;\n&gt; assertEquals(Collection, Collection);\n&gt; assertEquals(Collection, Collection, Comparator );\n&gt;\n&gt; Passing in a null Comparator to the second method would behave like when\n&gt; passing a Comparator to a sorted set, equals() method (or compareTo())\n&gt; would be called on the elements.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Dave\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Jason Rogers [mailto:jason.rogers@...]\n&gt; Sent: 25 July 2001 19:29\n&gt; To: &#39;junit@yahoogroups.com&#39;\n&gt; Subject: RE: [junit] Reporting more then 1 failed assertion per test\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; You are right.  And as I recall, we have tested for that case in our\n&gt; code as\n&gt; well.  How would the framework know when to use a comparator or not?\n&gt; Have\n&gt; something like the following?  Seems quirky... but this is what working\n&gt; on 4\n&gt; hours of sleep can do :)\n&gt;\n&gt; assertEquals(expectedCollection, actualCollection)\n&gt; assertComparesGreaterThanZero(expectedCollection, actualCollection)\n&gt; assertComparesLessThanZero(expectedCollection, actualCollection)\n&gt; assertComparesZero(expectedCollection, actualCollection)\n&gt;\n&gt; -Jason\n&gt;\n&gt;     &gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt;     &gt; From: Vladimir Bossicard [mailto:vladimir@...]\n&gt;     &gt; Sent: Wednesday, July 25, 2001 12:36 PM\n&gt;     &gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;     &gt; Subject: Re: [junit] Reporting more then 1 failed\n&gt;     &gt; assertion per test\n&gt;     &gt;\n&gt;     &gt;\n&gt;     &gt; &gt;\n&gt;     &gt; &gt;\n&gt;     &gt; &gt;How would this complete list help you any more than the\n&gt;     &gt; simple fact that the\n&gt;     &gt; &gt;arrays were not of the same length?  Given that I\n&gt;     &gt; expected them to contain\n&gt;     &gt; &gt;the same number of elements, the most valuable\n&gt;     &gt; information to me would be\n&gt;     &gt; &gt;that they were of different lengths, not which elements\n&gt;     &gt; were/were not\n&gt;     &gt; &gt;present.\n&gt;     &gt; &gt;\n&gt;     &gt; I partially don&#39;t agree.  I think that comparing vectors\n&gt;     &gt; should tell you\n&gt;     &gt; if the elements are equals.  If your testing a sort\n&gt;     &gt; algorythm, you want\n&gt;     &gt; to know if elements of the result vector are in the right\n&gt;     &gt; position.\n&gt;     &gt;  This request (assertEquals do array properly) has been\n&gt;     &gt; expressed by\n&gt;     &gt; many people and I think that it should be included in JUnit.\n&gt;     &gt;\n&gt;     &gt; But I&#39;m against the &quot;soft warning&quot; idea.  Don&#39;t see the\n&gt;     &gt; added value there.\n&gt;     &gt;\n&gt;     &gt; -Vladimir\n&gt;     &gt;\n&gt;     &gt;\n&gt;     &gt;\n&gt;     &gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
