But, with a little intention-revealing refactoring, I can convey \nthat after you *agitate SimpleMath.class you should get 100% coverage. I \nget the added bonus that most of the extracted methods and classes end \nup in a test harness that is re-usable.\n\n\nI have found that this technique is rarely necessary for unit tests \nbecause the tests are so short anyway. But for higher level tests where \nthere is typically a lot of re-use it is very valuable.\n\nKevin\n\n* &#39;agitate&#39; is what our product does - so even if /you/ don&#39;t know what \nthat means (yet) our upper-management does.\n\n\nvalerie_abelin wrote:\n\n&gt;&gt;I&#39;m not sure how to do that. Typically, the name of the test is enough \n&gt;&gt;to describe what each test means. Why is that not the case for you?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;d like to share the result of my unit testing with upper\n&gt; management-type people.  testInsertTooLargeValue() doesn&#39;t mean much\n&gt; to them.  I&#39;d like a prose description like:  &quot;In this test, we try\n&gt; inserting a value into the table that is too large.  Depending on such\n&gt; and such, this should occur.  Or if not, then this should occur.  In\n&gt; either case, the code finally handlings this use case in blah blah\n&gt; blah manner.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo!
