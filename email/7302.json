    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1607352888\">Hi,<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I&#39;ve been using JUnitDoclet to generate test shells for some existing <br/>\ncode, and I think I&#39;ve finally picked up the point that the setUp and <br/>\ntearDown methods along with the test constructor are all called for each <br/>\nindividual test method in the test class.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can see the logic behind this is that each test should be conducted <br/>\nstandalone so to speak. I can see from the FAQ <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://junit.sourceforge.net/doc/faq/faq.htm#organize_3\">http://junit.sourceforge.net/doc/faq/faq.htm#organize_3</a> that there is a <br/>\nway to write code such that setUp or tearDown methods are called only <br/>\nonce, but that this is not encouraged.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy situation is that I was just adding logging support to my classes, <br/>\nand that the classes are set up so that each time a class is created it <br/>\nis handed a unique id.  As a consequence if I have 7 test methods in my <br/>\nclass, the logging system gets initialized 7 times (since the init() <br/>\nmethod is in setUp) and 7 objects with 7 different object ids get <br/>\ncreated, one for each test method.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can see that conceivably there might be interactions such that the <br/>\nmultiple re-initializations help make the tests more robust, but I&#39;m not <br/>\nsure quite what they are.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo my question is, does initialization of a logging system count as <br/>\nsomething that deserves a unique setUp method?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if I want to conduct a series of tests on one object with a <br/>\nparticular id, should I try and create the object in a unique setUp <br/>\nmethod, or should I create single test methods that test a series of <br/>\noperations on a particular object?<br/>\n<br/>\nI am guessing that really I should have multiple test methods, to test <br/>\neach operation and then other tests to test series of combined <br/>\noperations.  I am then concerned about whether these more complex tests <br/>\nshould be in the same test class or in a different one.  Perhaps unit <br/>\ntesting should only ever test a single method at a time, and the desire <br/>\nto test a series of them at once suggests there should be another <br/>\nmethod, or object that can encapsulate the complex operation, and then <br/>\nthis can be tested in another class?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance.<br/>\n<br/>\nCHEERS&gt; SAM</div>",
