If I don&#39;t I <br/>\ncan&#39;t isolate the data from the runtime source.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not saying your larger suite of tests wouldn&#39;t contain tests which <br/>\nrun the two components together, again with mocked data starting the <br/>\nchain.  But I would definitely not be working on the Listener by using <br/>\nthe combined test, I would simply work on the Listener in isolation and <br/>\nmock the expected data, till I was done.  If the higher level test <br/>\ndemonstrated some flaw in my code, I would go back to the Listener and <br/>\nit&#39;s unique tests.  There I would Mock this new known bug producing data <br/>\nand prove the bug (in a test), and fix it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a bug shows up at this higher level of interaction, I believe that I <br/>\nhave failed to express some fact contractual obligation or expectation <br/>\nof one of the lower level classes.<br/>\n<br/>\nThoughts?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\nDavid B.</div>",
