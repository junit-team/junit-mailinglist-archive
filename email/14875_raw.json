Which ones? That&#39;s certainly not standard behavior, and it&#39;s not\n&gt; true of System.out, which is the stream at issue here.\n\nIt&#39;s always puzzled me why Java got this wrong (yes, I think &quot;wrong&quot;\nis the appropriate term) when even C got it right. It means, for\nexample, that various strings cannot be constants.\n\n&gt; In general code should not be written to depend on the system line\n&gt; separator. That worked well when programs and data spent their entire\n&gt; lives on one computer, or perhaps a few computers all running the same\n&gt; OS. In the world of the Internet and Java, that&#39;s no longer true.\n&gt; Programs should explicitly specify the line separator character(s) they\n&gt; write or read. Their output should not vary from one platform to the next.\n\nWell, that&#39;s an interesting choice. I might even make it, under enough\npressure.\n\nWouldn&#39;t it be good enough to provide a wrapper class for one&#39;s\noutput streams, which did the translation (or not) as required?\n\n-- \nChris &quot;as graphite to diamond&quot; Dollin\nThe software engineer&#39;s song: &quot;who knows where the time goes&quot;.\n\n\n",
