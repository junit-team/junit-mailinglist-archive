Kapfhammer&quot; &lt;gkapfham@...&gt;\r\n\r\n[Joshua Announcement]\n\nI am currently working on a research project that focues on the distributed\nexecution of regression test suites.  I am using Jini and JavaSpaces to \nimplement a tuplespace-based approach to distributed computing.  You can find\nout more about the Joshua project at:\n\nhttp://cs.allegheny.edu/~gkapfham/research/joshua/index.html\n\nFurthermore, I have written a paper that will be presented at the 18th \nInternational Conference and Exposition on Testing Computer Software \n(TCS 2001).  The paper is entitled &quot;Automatically and Transparently \nDistributing the Execution of Regression Test Suites.&quot;  You can obtain access \nto this paper at:\n\nhttp://cs.allegheny.edu/~gkapfham/research/publish/index.html\n\nAn implementation of Joshua that integrates into JUnit 3.6 is currently\nbeing developed.  My hope is that I will be able to finish this version in \nthe next month and then provide it for download at:\n\nhttp://developer.jini.org/exchange/projects/joshua/\n\n[You will have to register on jini.org to download the source code due to the\ncurrent SCSL that governs Jini technology.  I am hoping to post the source\ncode on my own web site as well, pending approval.]\n\n[Calling All Large Test Suites]\n\nI would like to conduct an empirical analysis of Joshua&#39;s mechanism for \ndistributing the execution of regression test suites.  As of right now, I can\nuse Joshua&#39;s own regression test suite and the test suites of other Java \nprograms that I or my students have written.  However, these will not\nbe of the appropriate scale for my empirical analysis. Is anyone involved in \nthe development of a large, Java-based software system that uses JUnit to \nperform their testing?  I would especially be interested in using and \nanalyzing the source code and tests for any Java-based open-source projects.  \nCan you please point me in the direction of project(s) that would be willing\nto contribute their code and JUnit tests?\n\ngreg\n\n-- \nGregory M.
