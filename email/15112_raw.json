I&#39;m having\n&gt; t=\r\nrouble following all the JUnit 4 parameterized discussions simply\n&gt; because=\r\n I don&#39;t feel comfortable with Java 5 annotations and generics\n&gt; yet. I jus=\r\nt haven&#39;t worked enough with these java 5 features that they\n&gt; come to me n=\r\naturally. By contrast, I can read this and see exactly what\n&gt; it&#39;s doing. G=\r\nood.\n&gt;\n&gt; On the minus side, I think this might be too simple. It seems to r=\r\nequire\n&gt; all the test parameters to be initialized up front. If the paramet=\r\ners or\n&gt; their initialization code is large or expensive, this could be a\n&gt;=\r\n problem. I would prefer the parameters to be lazily initialized before\n&gt; e=\r\nach test and torn down after each test. This could be done if this\n&gt; method=\r\n returned an Iterator rather than a static array. Any reason it\n&gt; wasn&#39;t do=\r\nne this way?\n\n\nFor simplicity.\n\nBut I understand the need for lazy initiali=\r\nzations, and it&#39;s also a feature\nthat has been requested for the creation o=\r\nf test classes themselves, which\nTestNG doesn&#39;t support either (just like J=\r\nUnit, TestNG creates all the test\nclasses upfront and then invoke the test =\r\nmethods on them, which doesn&#39;t work\nwell in the cases you outlined).\n\nFor t=\r\nhat reason, I have indeed been considering an iterator factory for test\ncla=\r\nsses as well, which I proposed a few months ago in this thread:\n\nhttp://for=\r\nums.opensymphony.com/thread.jspa?threadID=3D1685&tstart=3D60\n\nI reproduced =\r\nthe proposal below so you don&#39;t have to read the entire thread.\n\nI am still=\r\n thinking of implementing it at some point, along with Data\nProvider iterat=\r\nors, but it does require some re-design in our code base and\nthe demand has=\r\nn&#39;t been too strong so far (you&#39;re not the first one to\nrequest it, though)=\r\n.\n\n--\nC=C3=A9dric\n\nOkay, I think I see where you are getting at. You want c=\r\nontinuation\nfactories :-)\n\nYou are correct that right now, it&#39;s a two-step =\r\nprocess:\n\n- All the factories are invoked and create all the test instances=\r\n\n- TestNG runs on all the created instances\n\nwhich is potentially a problem=\r\n if these instances consume a lot of\nresources.\n\nYour factory iterator sugg=\r\nestion makes sense to me.\n\nWe could have a new kind of factory that returns=\r\n an iterator:\n\n@Factory\npublic Iterator createTests() { ... }\n\nand TestNG w=\r\nould basically do the following:\n\nIterator it =3D factory.createTests();\nwh=\r\nile (it.hasNext()) {\nObject testInstance =3D it.next();\ninvoke TestNG on th=\r\nis testInstance\n}\n\nThen it&#39;s up to you to make sure that your test instance=\r\ns are only created\nwhen needed.\n\nHow does this sound?\n\n--\nC=C3=A9dric\nhttp:=\r\n//beust.com/weblog\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n=\r\n\n\n",
