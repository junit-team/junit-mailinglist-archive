I noticed following piece of codes, which I am not quite \nsure \n&gt; &gt; why it is written in such way. I hope some one can help me to \n&gt; explain \n&gt; &gt; it. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   So the TestRunner.java Run() ... cals TestSuite.java &#39;s Run() \n&gt; which \n&gt; &gt; in turns calls TestResult&#39;s method. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;    Notice that Run() does not directly call\n&gt; &gt;     test.RunBare() but instead, using anynomous class\n&gt; &gt; and defined a protect() method in the class. And using  \nrunProtected\n&gt; &gt; () method to invoked this method .\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \t\tProtectable p= new Protectable() {\n&gt; &gt; \t\t\tpublic void protect() throws Throwable {\n&gt; &gt; \t\t\t\ttest.runBare();\n&gt; &gt; \t\t\t}\n&gt; &gt; \t\t};\n&gt; &gt; \t\trunProtected(test, p);\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   My question is why this written in such way ? Why not call \n&gt; &gt; test.RunBare() directly ? \n&gt; \n&gt; This was necessary to factor out commonality between TestCase and \n&gt; TestSetup.\n&gt; \n&gt; Kent\n\n\n\n",
