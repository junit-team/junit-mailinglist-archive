But unit testing seems be<br/>\n&gt;aimed at public interface testing, which my newly refactored methods do not<br/>\n&gt;come under this description.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I have done the following and been happy with it. Add a method (or even a class) that contains the raw business logic that your Action performs<br/>\n<br/>\n* This method accepts as parameters any object that it might collaborate with.<br/>\n<br/>\n* This method builds up ActionMessages (of all kinds) into a collection.<br/>\n<br/>\n* This method accepts a Map parameter that represents the objects it wants to place on the Struts response<br/>\n<br/>\nI test-drive this code. The code in my Action is almost foolproof:<br/>\n<br/>\n* Create an ActionMessages and/or ActionErrors object.<br/>\n* Dump the &quot;response objects&quot; into the request as attributes.<br/>\n* Perform any required JNDI lookups to find the collaborating objects<br/>\n<br/>\nOver time, I can extract these responsibilities into a template method and build a mini-framework for integrating my raw business logic.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know whether this is what you&#39;re doing, or close to it, but I have used it with success.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sorry if this is terse: I&#39;ll need to write it out in full for the book and don&#39;t have the energy to write it out in full now. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nFeel free to ask specific questions on this, though. We can work through the code.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care.<br/>\n<br/>\nJ. B.
