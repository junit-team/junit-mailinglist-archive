Assume<br/>\nalso that I can&#39;t replicate the servlet environment  so I&#39;m using Mock<br/>\nObjects ( <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mockobjects.sourceforge.net\">http://mockobjects.sourceforge.net</a> ) to keep the testing<br/>\nlight. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf my service() method looks like this:<br/>\n<br/>\nservice() {<br/>\n<br/>\n  doSomething()<br/>\n  doAnotherThing()<br/>\n  doSomethingElse() <br/>\n}<br/>\n<br/>\neach of which require the setting of a significantly different state (<br/>\nor MockObjects inside MockObjects, which I&#39;ve read breaks the<br/>\nfundamental philosophy of unit testing and mock objects )<br/>\n<br/>\nwould it suffice to test doSomething(), doAnotherThing(),<br/>\ndoSomethingElse() or would good practice dictate that I test service()<br/>\nsince that&#39;s the method that will be involved in the integration of my<br/>\ncode with the rest of the system?<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess my underlying questions are:<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat are some guidelines for a &quot;unit&quot; ?<br/>\nIs the assumption of tested units enough to warrant passing on the<br/>\ncomposite methods that call those units?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for any help,<br/>\n<br/>\nAadi</div>",
