I\n&gt; actually did have an equals() method in SimpleMsg,  but when I\n&gt; looked more closely, I realised that the argument should have\n&gt; been of type Object rather than of type &#39;SimpleMsg&#39;.\n&lt;/james&gt;\n\nright...the reason you don&#39;t want to write equals(YourClass) is that\nif you stuff an instance of YourClass in, say, a collection, then\ngo searching for it, it won&#39;t be equals(YourClass) called by the\ncollection class to report equality, but equals(Object).  if you\ndon&#39;t define equals(Object), then the version supplied by Object\nitself is invoked, and that&#39;s usually not what you mean.\n\ncheers,\np\n\n\n\n",
