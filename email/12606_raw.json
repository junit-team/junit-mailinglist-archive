Of course, this isn&#39;t always possible and sometimes not\n&gt; even desirable in a test.\n\nRight, and if the code in question were particularly long, or ugly in\nsome other fashion, I&#39;d agree.  Taken alone your kind of comments can\nsound suspiciously like &quot;my code is self-documenting&quot;.  And it isn&#39;t.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Sometimes it is though. I find that when I have a lot of page long\n&gt; tests, there is a lot of duplication between the tests - which hurts\n&gt; maintainability and readability. EXTRACT METHOD can help with both.\n&gt; \n&gt; I am imagining something like this :\n&gt; \n&gt; public void testMultipleCustomerPurchaseOrderEntriesForOneSalesOrderLine()\n&gt; {\n&gt;    createSalesOrderLine(...);\n&gt;    addCustomerPurchaseOrder( .... X );\n&gt;    addCustomerPurchaseOrder( .... Y );\n&gt;    assertSomethingAboutOrders( ...expected ...);\n&gt; }\n&gt;\n&gt; Any chance we can see the test ?\n\nYou&#39;ve described pretty much what it does.  There is other set-up that\nis done in this test that isn&#39;t done in the other tests in order to\ncreate the many purchase order situation, and there are more\nassertions because it checks a larger (about fifteen) set of data\ngoing in and out.  Most of that is done by helper methods, but you\nhave to record the values, so there&#39;s a lot of things like:\n\nString customerPO = &quot;somenumber&quot;;\nString housebillNumber = &quot;someHawb&quot;;\nString somethingElseToBeCheckedLater = &quot;somevalue&quot;;\n\nand their accompanying assert clauses.  Yes, I could do these in a\nseparate test, an interesting refactor and something we&#39;d likely do in\na code review, but not something I did the first time, and not the\nsource of the complexity that required the comment.\n\nI&#39;d share the test, but it uses client-specific data.  Some of it I\ncould change, but some values and paradigms are expected by the rest\nof the system (client codes, account nubmers, etc).\n\nIn general, what I wanted to say was that while Mike&#39;s right that most\nof the time the method name is sufficient, sometimes the case is\nenough of a corner that you both need and want a short description of\nwhat the heck is going on.  Not shipping any javadoc is turning that\n&#39;sometimes&#39; into &#39;never&#39;.\n\n-Kevin\n\n",
