A Wiki or similar is not a bad\nidea by itself, however. We could balance toward a short static fact which\ndescribes critical resources and refers immediately to a dynamic system.\nThis would raise the chances of the FAQ remaining up to date.\n\nOn 16 Oct 2001, Vladimir Bossicard wrote:\n\n&gt; &gt; Here&#39;s my proposal for a list of topics; I can already see various items\n&gt; &gt; that I can&#39;t answer (I don&#39;t do extreme programming, I don&#39;t use an ide...)\n&gt;\n&gt; The FAQ is an excellent idea but instead of having a static email, why do not set up a wiki project?\n&gt;\n&gt; The challenge will be to keep this reference up-to-date and make this project last longer than a few weeks...\n&gt;\n&gt; -Vladimir\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
