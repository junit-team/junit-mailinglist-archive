One<br/>\n&gt; side effect of doing that is it gives me an extra layer of context (a<br/>\n&gt; namespace) on top of the test method name.  So, given my limited<br/>\n&gt; knowledge of your problem domain, I might have a test case like this:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;    public class OneSalesOrderLineTest extends TestCase {<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;      public void setUp() {<br/>\n&gt;        // fixture for one sales order line<br/>\n&gt;      }<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;      public void testCreateMultipleCustomerPurchaseOrderEntries() {<br/>\n&gt;      }<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;      public void testSomethingElseAboutOneSalesOrderLine() {<br/>\n&gt;      }<br/>\n&gt;    }<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Close, except I don&#39;t make the mistake you&#39;ve (purposefully) made<br/>\nhere, including the &#39;multiple&#39; test with the &#39;oneLineItem&#39; test.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy test class in this case is called something like<br/>\n&quot;SpecificClientMappingSupportTest&quot; where &#39;SpecificClient&#39; is the name<br/>\nof one of our clients who has a bit of byzantine business logic that<br/>\nmust be supported by our system.  The tests all rely on fixtures that<br/>\nconfigure the system to understand that it&#39;s reading data for this<br/>\nclient, and that create inputs that resemble those that would come<br/>\nfrom other parts of the system for this client.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, like you, I&#39;m reading the tests in this class, and I know I&#39;m in<br/>\nthe context of the StarbucksMapperSupport (Starbucks is not the real<br/>\nname, just a name I can see from my window).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; This particular example is partly about readability (you could infer a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; lot of the information, possibly, from the method name) and part about<br/>\n&gt; &gt; disambiguity.  There are other tests involving CustomerPurchaseOrders<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and Sales Order Lines that are similar.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Does using a separate test case help with the ambiguity?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not sure what you mean here.  I&#39;m trying to disambiguate this<br/>\ntestcase with another testCase that is named similarly:<br/>\n<br/>\ntestMultipleCustomerPurchaseOrderEntriesForManySalesOrderLinesWithDuplicates();<br/>\n<br/>\nThat test too has commentary describing the situation.  That one has a<br/>\nbug# as well, apparently I did it wrong at one point in time.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Most of the time, these comments are written before the test.  I guess<br/>\n&gt; &gt; you could say I practice document-first test development.  I write a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; sentence or two about what the test is going to do (or just a method<br/>\n&gt; &gt; name if it suffices -- you&#39;re right that it often does) then I write<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the test.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I often use that technique, as well.  By writing out prose, I find<br/>\n&gt; words that I&#39;d like to use in the test method name.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>True, and most often I do the same thing.  But there are cases where I<br/>\nfelt that the prose held more information than the method name I came<br/>\nup with.  I&#39;d already written the prose, so I left it to guide me in<br/>\nthe implementation, and describe the situation to the maintainers.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Ultimately, why wouldn&#39;t you want to write actual sentences?  I like<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Java a lot, but English was my first language.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m not saying you should never write sentences.  However, if I can<br/>\n&gt; convey the same meaning in a method name, I&#39;ll do that instead of<br/>\n&gt; maintaining two separate pieces of information (the sentence and the<br/>\n&gt; method name).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think folks are overstating my intentions a bit:  I&#39;m *not* saying<br/>\nthat *all* tests need javadoc documentation, I&#39;m not even saying that<br/>\nmost of them do.  The only point I&#39;m making is that occasionally you<br/>\nneed it, and not shipping the javadoc (the original question) makes<br/>\nthat occasional-but-important information unavailable to whoever is<br/>\nusing the unit tests.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Kevin Klinemeier</div>",
