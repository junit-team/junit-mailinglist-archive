The assertions\n&gt;&gt;that break tell you what the behavioral change was.  If nothing\n&gt;&gt;breaks, perhaps that says the test coverage is not sufficient,\n&gt;&gt;or the rule change had no practical effect.Paul:\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Thank you for your comprehensive answer. Let&#39;s presume I&#39;ve reached\n&gt;the stage where I have successfully implemented the rules engine along\n&gt;with a full suite of unit tests. Would I be violating any canons by\n&gt;having JUnit output its results in some text-like form to enable quick\n&gt;comparisons between result sets of different rules changes ? Is there\n&gt;a more elegant way to accomplish this ? I&#39;m essentially trying to come\n&gt;up with a quick way to tell the user &quot;When you change Rule # 5 that\n&gt;way, loans 1, 4 and 7 fail but 2,3 and 89 now pass.&quot;.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nJUnit (like other xUnits) is meant to test whether your code behaves \ncorrectly with respect to the requirements. It seems like you want to \nuse JUnit to &#39;experiment&#39; with your rules. If you have a set of loans \nthat should be accepted and a set of loans that should not be accepted, \nyou could write tests for these (perhaps parameterized tests to make \nthings easier, so you only need to write two tests) and experiment as \nyou like. You can also write a custom TestListener that reports test \nsuccess and failure in a result file, that also reads the file(s) with \nthe rules and writes them to the same result file, so you later have an \noverview which rule set performed how (make sure you write to a new file \neach time, so you can compare, or append at the of the file). In this \ncase you would also need a custom TestRunner, to write the rules to the \nresult file when the testsuite starts.\n\n-- \n  Mark Van Peteghem\n  http://www.q-mentum.com -- easier and more powerful unit testing\n\n\n",
