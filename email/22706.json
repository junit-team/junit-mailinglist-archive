I started searching for best practices and found that people were asking that question all the way back in 2001!  Kind of intimidating!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, what I am looking for is not &quot;best practices&quot;, per se, but a real world example.  And from that I mean an example that starts from an idea in someone&#39;s head and evolves all the way through application completion and testing coverage.  For example, I am thinking of an auto insurance type of application that has certain requirements, say 10, and how the tests are derived from the requirements and the code gets derived from the tests.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe have many developers that are new to Test Driven Development, and to simply come out with best practices and ask them to get on board will never work.  However, if we can take a real world example, from start to finish, and show how the tests did drive the code and how refactoring became so much simpler as a result, that would be a great start into changing the mentality of some of our developers (myself included ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nAny suggestions?<br/>\nThank you,<br/>\nRegards,<br/>\nElaine</div>",
