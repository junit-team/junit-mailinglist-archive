Here is an overview of the packages and classes as they stand now.\n\nPackages in JUnit 4:\n* org.junit -- published classes related to writing tests\n  * runner -- published classes related to running tests\n    * runner.extensions -- examples of new Runners\n    * runner.internal -- implementation details of running tests\n  * samples -- sample tests\n  * tests -- the tests for JUnit\n\nPublished classes in JUnit 4:\n* org.junit\n  * Before -- annotation for methods to be run before each test method\n  * BeforeClass -- annotation for methods to be run before all tests in a\nclass\n  * After -- annotation for methods to be run after each test method\n  * AfterClass -- annotation for methods to be run after all tests in a\nclass\n  * Ignore -- annotation for test methods that are temporarily not to be run\n  * Test -- annotation for methods that are to be run as tests\n  * Assert -- assertion methods, expected to be used via static import\n\n* org.junit.runner\n  * Failure -- represents a problem while running a test\n  * JUnitCore -- sets up listeners and runs tests (half of the old Runner\nfunctionality is here)\n  * Result -- summary of the results of running tests (this is the other\nhalf of the old Runner functionality)\n  * RunListener -- interface for objects wanting to be updated as tests run\n(was called TestListener)\n  * Runner -- interface for custom ways of running tests (JUnit 4 tests and\npre-JUnit 4 tests are handled automatically) (was called RunnerStrategy)\n  * RunWith -- class annotation directing JUnit 4 to use a customer runner\n(was called Factory)\n\nOther classes in JUnit 4:\n* org.junit.runner.extensions\n  * AllTests -- runner for use in running JUnit 3.x AllTests classes (those\nthat only implement a static Test suite() method)\n  * Parameterized -- runner for use in running experimental parameterized\ntests\n  * Parameters -- annotation used to identify data source for parameterized\ntests\n\nWe would appreciate feedback for this naming scheme. We would also like to\nsee examples of new runners. We have found this a very powerful mechanism.\nWe expect it to be useful for those writing JUnit add-ons.\n\nThe remaining functionality we need to add is a way to specify test suites\nthat is represented in source code and works with automated refactoring\ntools. Once that is in place we will javadoc everything, package it, and\ndeploy.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nKent Beck\nThree Rivers Institute\n\nErich Gamma\nIBM\n\nDavid Saff\nMIT\n\n\n",
