I have never cared about this, \nso I&#39;m surprised when so many other people do care about it. Either \nthey&#39;re missing something simple, or I&#39;m missing something simple.\n\nLet&#39;s say I want to know which tests cover a given production code \nmethod. To do that, I go to the method, then hit Shift+Ctrl+G in \nEclipse, searching the workspace for references to that method. It&#39;s \nusually pretty easy to scan the list of search results and separate the \ntest case classes (which have the word &quot;Test&quot; in them) from the \nproduction code classes (which don&#39;t have the word &quot;Test&quot; in them). This \ntechnique has never posed a serious enough problem for me to want to do \nit a different way.\n\nI have used the same technique with IntelliJ IDEA, so it&#39;s not just an \nEclipse thing.\n\nI can also do the same thing if I want to see which tests use the \n/class/, but I can&#39;t remember the last time I wanted to know that. I \ntypically want to know which tests are using a /method/, not a class.\n\nSo would anyone like to tell us a story of when they needed to search \nfor the tests that cover a given production code class, and how \norganizing their tests their way made that easy? I&#39;d like to learn what \nthe big issues are.\n\nThanks.\n-- \nJ. B.
