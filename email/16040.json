Of course it<br/>\n   will.  Either in time or in programmers.  After all, we are talking about<br/>\n   writing more code, so the number of man.months is going to go up as<br/>\n   well.<br/>\n<br/>\n   The way to solve this problem is to include testing in the planning<br/>\n   and project features and deadlines accordingly, but for having been there as<br/>\n   well, I agree that it&#39;s not always possible.<br/>\n<br/>\n   - Using debuggers less might be a good thing *if* the developers find<br/>\n   bugs faster.  I have seen quite a few TDD enthusiasts choose not to use<br/>\n   debuggers for dogmatic reasons (&quot;because I read it in a book&quot;) and then<br/>\n   spend hours writing tests or even println&#39;s trying to reproduce a mysterious<br/>\n   bug that a breakpoint would have caught in a few minutes.<br/>\n<br/>\n   Again, the solution here is to be pragmatic:  you have two tools at<br/>\n   your disposal (testing and debugger), both with their pros and cons, and<br/>\n   you&#39;d be a fool to choose to use only one.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nCedric<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://testng.org\">http://testng.org</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 2/9/06, frank zou &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:frankz1998@...\">frankz1998@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi all,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; After lots of reading and trying, I think I understand the following<br/>\n&gt; benefits that Junit-base testing can give us:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; * more robust system<br/>\n&gt; * clean / good design<br/>\n&gt; * less regression bugs<br/>\n&gt; * confidence to do refactorying, especially at the later phase of the<br/>\n&gt; project.<br/>\n&gt; * and lots more...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; These are really good things, for open-source projects where there is<br/>\n&gt; no deadline pressure and resource could almost be thought as<br/>\n&gt; un-limitted. However, for commercial software development, is this<br/>\n&gt; still possible ?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Although I knew JUnit and other JUnit-based open-source tools for a<br/>\n&gt; couple of years, my company and team never really enbrace it. The<br/>\n&gt; major reason is Product Managers always want to add cool features to<br/>\n&gt; the system quickly while programmers find the schedule is always too<br/>\n&gt; tight to spend any extra time to write testing.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I know from the mail list and books that we can take lots of advantage<br/>\n&gt; of JUnit-based testing, I myself have no real hands-on experience on<br/>\n&gt; it. So here are my questions:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; * Will Junit-based testing make the project time longer or shorter ?<br/>\n&gt; Any hard statistic data ? ( Here I mean commercial project rather than<br/>\n&gt; open-source project. )<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; * One intersting point I found is that after Junit-based testing is<br/>\n&gt; introduced, programmers tend to use IDE debugger much less than<br/>\n&gt; before.  This would save lots of time. Is that true ?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; * Some guys say JUnit is good for biz / util code testing. But for web<br/>\n&gt; application development, where HTML/javascript would be root cause of<br/>\n&gt; lots of bugs, Junit is not so powerful. Any comments ?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; * How can I convince managers and programmers that JUnit-based is<br/>\n&gt; really possible for commercial software development ? Any differnece<br/>\n&gt; from open-source projects ?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Can some Junit gurus shed some light here ?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks,<br/>\n&gt; - Frank<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
