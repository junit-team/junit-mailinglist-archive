This will be posted now and then; not often<br/>\nenough to be spam, but often enough to keep our newer members aware of how<br/>\nwe conduct business around here.<br/>\n<br/>\nDear members and readers of the JUnit mailing list,<br/>\n<br/>\nAround here, we love testing. Not only do we love testing, we love to<br/>\ndiscuss any and all aspects of testing, often with enthusiasm and passion.<br/>\nThis is good. This is the reason that this mailing list exists. On top of<br/>\nall this, we are very keen to help others understand this strange affliction<br/>\nwe have; medical name &quot;testus infectus&quot;, better known as being test<br/>\ninfected. We love to answer questions and help those new to the joy move<br/>\nfurther down the road towards test enlightenment. In the classic spirit of<br/>\nhospitality, our list is your list, our test cases are your test cases.<br/>\nPlease make yourself at home and enjoy the journey. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, there are some things that we don&#39;t love, so sit tight and listen<br/>\nup.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe don&#39;t love people who haven&#39;t, or won&#39;t, read the JUnit Frequently Asked<br/>\nQuestions (FAQ) document, lovingly maintained by Mike Clark or the &quot;Smart<br/>\nQuestions&quot; document written and maintained by Eric S. Raymond. Here are the<br/>\nlinks, go forth and read ...<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://junit.sourceforge.net/doc/faq/faq.htm\">http://junit.sourceforge.net/doc/faq/faq.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html\">http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nWe don&#39;t love people who think that we&#39;ll do their homework assignments for<br/>\nthem. Back when I was a lad, we didn&#39;t have the Internet and we had to do<br/>\nour own homework assignments without the aid of all the knowledge and<br/>\ninformation that you have available to you today. (And yes, now that you<br/>\nask, I did walk uphill both ways to school through the snow.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWe don&#39;t love people who are incapable of using a search engine, but are yet<br/>\nsomehow capable of signing up onto this mailing list so that they can ask<br/>\nquestions that ten seconds of searching would reveal the answer to. Learn<br/>\nhow to use a search engine. Around here, Google seems quite popular. Here&#39;s<br/>\na link; learn to love it and use it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.google.com/\">http://www.google.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nWe don&#39;t love job postings. We do love having jobs (or at least, we like the<br/>\npay) and we do like to look at job postings, but we like to look at them in<br/>\nmore logical places like job websites. So, please don&#39;t be upset when a<br/>\nmoderator deletes your carefully worded prose describing yet another testing<br/>\njob.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe don&#39;t love thread hijacking. That&#39;s when you start a different subject by<br/>\nreplying to a previous conversation and not even changing the subject line.<br/>\nWe like to discuss a variety of subjects, so please feel free to be inspired<br/>\nto ask side-questions during ongoing conversations. Just do so by starting a<br/>\nfresh thread with a unique subject line.<br/>\n<br/>\nLastly, we don&#39;t love people who whine, moan and generally sound like<br/>\npetulant children after they&#39;ve been told that they have violated one of the<br/>\n&quot;laws of the land&quot; around here. It&#39;s a big old Internet; feel free to take<br/>\nyour questions and/or tantrums somewhere else if you don&#39;t like the way we<br/>\ndo things around here.<br/>\n<br/>\nSimon<br/>\n(One of the JUnit mailing list moderators)<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nsimonpeter.org | simonpeter.com | newlife-upc.org<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
