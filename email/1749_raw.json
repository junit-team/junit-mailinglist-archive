However if all you want to do is spew out\ndebug messages to a text file that&#39;s cool, log4j can handle it without very\nmuch configuring.  actually logging a message requires no more code than\nsystem.out.println().\n\nthe good thing about it is that log4j recognises DEBUG as a logging level so\nthat you can leave your debug messages in your live code and just supress\nthe outputting of the message.  this solves the problem of accidentally\nintroducing bugs when you clean out your system.out.println() calls prior to\ngoing live.  it also means those messages can be re-used the next time you\nwork on that code.\n\nI&#39;m not saying loh4j is perfect, but it is a lot better than re-inventing\nthe wheel.\n\nrgds, APC\n\n \n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Jason Rogers [mailto:jason.rogers@...]\nSent: 03 July 2001 14:34\nTo: &#39;junit@yahoogroups.com&#39;\nSubject: RE: [junit] printing my own debug messages\n\n\nI looked at that some time ago for some simple logging needs we had, and it\nseemed really heavyweight.  Do you disagree?  Do you think it can be scaled\ndown pretty easily?\n\n    &gt; -----Original Message-----\n    &gt; From: Andrew Clarke [mailto:andrew.clarke@...]\n    &gt; Sent: Tuesday, July 03, 2001 9:07 AM\n    &gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n    &gt; Subject: RE: [junit] printing my own debug messages\n    &gt; \n    &gt; \n    &gt; Why not use another great piece of freeware, log4j?   \n    &gt; This can be downloaded\n    &gt; from the Apache site.\n    &gt; \n    &gt; rgds, APC\n    &gt; \n    &gt; -----Original Message-----\n    &gt; From: steinbeck@...

It seems \n    &gt; that this is not the way that I&#39;m supposed to go, since \n    &gt; there seems to \n    &gt; be no option for that. \n    &gt; \n    &gt; Nevertheless, it would be nice to use the test case for debugging \n    &gt; (until it works).\n    &gt; It there an option for that? \n    &gt; \n    &gt; Cheers, \n    &gt; \n    &gt; Chris\n    &gt; \n    &gt; \n    &gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n    &gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n    &gt;  \n    &gt; \n    &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
