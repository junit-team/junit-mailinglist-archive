That&#39;s what class invariants are for. Each public <br/>\n&gt; method is atomic. It is invoked when an object is any legal <br/>\n&gt; state and when the method returns it is always careful to <br/>\n&gt; leave the object in one of the legal states (barring bad <br/>\n&gt; synchronization and complicated multithreaded issues).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s not what I was saying.  I am sure your code won&#39;t crash if the method<br/>\nis called without these prerequisites, it&#39;s just that it won&#39;t be doing<br/>\nanything useful (no-op or throwing an exception), so testing it in these<br/>\nconditions will be useless:  you need to set up these prerequisites before<br/>\nyou invoke the method.<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; However, a situation where public method A must be <br/>\n&gt; invoked before method B is a code smell.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I see code like this every day, and it&#39;s not a code smell to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s just what a program is about:  the logical execution of statements in a<br/>\ncertain order.  Run them in a different order and the program no longer does<br/>\nwhat it&#39;s supposed to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nSeriously, can you take any two method invocations following each other in<br/>\nyour code, swap them, and your code still works?!?<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nCédric<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://beust.com/weblog\">http://beust.com/weblog</a></div>",
