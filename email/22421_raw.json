Classes mode is one per class. Both is, =\r\nwell, both. In my 10+ years as test-infected, I have really never ever had =\r\na use-case where this kind of solution would be appropriate (maybe some kin=\r\nd of really slow database with unlimited cheap connections). With thousands=\r\n of test classes you come to a grinding halt with any of these options.\n\n[D=\r\nF] That&#39;s insane...\n\n&gt;1 more thing, do any of the selenium projects you spe=\r\nak of use the &gt;selenium grid with windows? We are having a hell of a time g=\r\netting &gt;that working too. We have the hub on Ubuntu and windows slaves don&#39;=\r\nt &gt;play nice but Ubuntu slaves work fine. I haven&#39;t found much info on &gt;the=\r\n issues we are seeing nor have a I gotten any responses on the &gt;Selenium ma=\r\niling list. We may just have to skip IE testing for now &gt;and running everyt=\r\nhing on firefox Ubuntu.\n\nWe run all our browser-bots on windows, and the CI=\r\n is bamboo on linux. We do not use grid. Instead we let a single build run =\r\nwith 4 threads towards a single instance of selenium RC (with firefox). Thi=\r\ns has proved to be a nice, stable setup that gives us a lot of punch.\nNow w=\r\ne also partition the entire build into 2, so we have two separate (Windows)=\r\n pizza boxes running RC+ firefox, for a grand total\nof 8 available browsers=\r\n. This allows us to use firefox as the backbone in our selenium-TDD-based d=\r\nevelopment that has allowed us\nvirtually regression free frequent deploymen=\r\nts\n\n[DF] So are you saying that you have 2 windows machines running seleniu=\r\nm RC and you have your test runner that round robins between the two rather=\r\n than using the grid?\nJust out of curiosity, what are you using to kick off=\r\n the tests?\n\nWe run Internet Explorer and Opera on separate boxes. Opera Se=\r\nlenium tests are hard to make stable, but they also work concurrently.\nInte=\r\nrnet Exploder is a strict one-instance per box for any kind of\nstability. I=\r\n know some people use virtualization. We just add boxes.\n\n[DF] When you add=\r\n boxes, each one runs a separate selenium rc server? How do you distribute =\r\nthe tests to them?\n\nThe other projects do much the same, but they all pre-d=\r\nate grid somewhat.\n\nWe&#39;re also planning to try out Chrome once we upgrade t=\r\no Selenium 2.0, we really need something webkit based.\n\nKristian\n\n[Non-text=\r\n portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of th=\r\nis message have been removed]\n\n\n",
