    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1244021657\">JUnit (3.8.1) counts the number of test methods that pass/fail.<br/>\nWith some of the test generation methods, such as JUnitDoclet, empty<br/>\nmethods are generated (a good thing) for each class. But when the<br/>\ntests are run, the generated document shows that all these methods<br/>\npass (questionably good).  This gives a false sense that the code<br/>\nbeing tested is being tested, when it really isn&#39;t because the test<br/>\nbodies are empty.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs there a way to track the number of assertions that pass/fail<br/>\ninstead of the number of methods that are invoked in the test classes?<br/>\n This way the numbers reported (e.g., 122 tests run) would tend to<br/>\nimply better test coverage, or at least more actual tests executing,<br/>\nrather than lots of empty tests running.  (Yes, I know bad tests can<br/>\nbe written that skew the results, but we don&#39;t need to go into that<br/>\nnow.)<br/>\nThis way more the classes for which tests haven&#39;t yet been written,<br/>\nbut the skeleton is up and running, would show up in the report as 0<br/>\ntests run, rather than whatever number of test skeletons have been<br/>\ngenerated<br/>\nand may or may not be empty.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nSteve Kelem</div>",
