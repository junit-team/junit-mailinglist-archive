However, i couldn&#39;t specify all the possible<br/>\n&gt; outputs right?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; so how to do method testing?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Classical testing theory knows the concept of &quot;oracles&quot;, i.e. programs which<br/>\nwill compute the expected output of a test for a given (dynamically)<br/>\ncomputed input. Bob Binder has dedicated a whole chapter of his oo-testing<br/>\nbook to this topic.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, in cases like yours, building an oracle would basically mean to<br/>\nduplicate the algorithm of your trimA() method which is not a reasonable<br/>\nthing to do for a developer testing her own code. Proceed as suggested in<br/>\nanother post: Choose a couple of examples which make you feel comfortable<br/>\nwith your implementation. In most cases testing is the art of finding the<br/>\ncrucial set of examples.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a sense test-driven development is about finding the minimal (or<br/>\nreasonably small) crucial set of examples.<br/>\n<br/>\nJohannes</div>",
