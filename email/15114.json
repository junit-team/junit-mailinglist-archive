So, framework should provide some way to<br/>\n&gt; supply test data lazily.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From other hand if you think of IDE it should be possible to run<br/>\n&gt; just specific test or only selected test cases. o, it seems that there<br/>\n&gt; should be some random-acess API, which iteterator just does not provide.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Also note that one would be interested to know how many test cases<br/>\n&gt; in the given data provider as well as a readable name for each test.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I exchanged a few emails with JB about that, and my take on &quot;data names&quot; is<br/>\nbasically: I don&#39;t see the need.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a test method being fed by a data provider fails, it will clearly say<br/>\nsomething like &quot;Expected 42 but got 41&quot;. From that point, it&#39;s pretty easy<br/>\nto trace which data from the data set caused this error and act on it.<br/>\n<br/>\nActually, I would probably not even care about that myself: I would rerun my<br/>\ntests, put a breakpoint on any assertion thrown and let the IDE show me<br/>\nexactly where and when the test fails. Whether this test method was fed data<br/>\nfrom a DataProvider or from somewhere else is irrelevant to fix the test.<br/>\n<br/>\nPS: Cedric, I thouight we already discussed above points. Did you<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; forgot that or my arguments wasn&#39;t very covincing?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Not at all, Eugene. In my response to Elliotte, I mentioned that he wasn&#39;t<br/>\nthe first one to make this request and I obviously had you in mind :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter thinking about it more, it might actually be completely trivial for<br/>\nTestNG to support lazy data providers. I&#39;ll take a stab at it and I&#39;ll<br/>\nreport here with the results.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nCédric<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
