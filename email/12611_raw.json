So, given my limited\n&gt;&gt; knowledge of your problem domain, I might have a test case like this:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;    public class OneSalesOrderLineTest extends TestCase {\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;      public void setUp() {\n&gt;&gt;        // fixture for one sales order line\n&gt;&gt;      }\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;      public void testCreateMultipleCustomerPurchaseOrderEntries() {\n&gt;&gt;      }\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;      public void testSomethingElseAboutOneSalesOrderLine() {\n&gt;&gt;      }\n&gt;&gt;    }\n&gt;\n&gt; Close, except I don&#39;t make the mistake you&#39;ve (purposefully) made\n&gt; here, including the &#39;multiple&#39; test with the &#39;oneLineItem&#39; test.\n\nThat wasn&#39;t purposeful.  I thought you were trying to test that  \nmultiple customer purchase order entries could be created for one sales  \norder line.  In retrospect, you&#39;re probably testing the inverse of  \nthat.  The example is arbitrary, and I think we&#39;re on the same page  \nhere anyway.\n\n&gt;&gt; Does using a separate test case help with the ambiguity?\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m not sure what you mean here.  I&#39;m trying to disambiguate this\n&gt; testcase with another testCase that is named similarly:\n&gt;\n&gt; testMultipleCustomerPurchaseOrderEntriesForManySalesOrderLinesWithDupli \n&gt; cates();\n\nIf I recall, you also have another test method of this name:\n\n   testMultipleCustomerPurchaseOrderEntriesForOneSalesOrderLine()\n\nBoth of these have a common base name:  \nMultipleCustomerPurchaseOrderEntries.  Often this is trying to tell me  \nthat I&#39;m missing a a test case class, for example,  \nTestMultiplePurchaseOrderEntries.  That class would include tests for  \nmultiple purchase order entries.\n\nOr, to invert it the other way, perhaps I need two different test case  \nclasses: OneSalesOrderLineTest and ManySalesOrderLines.  Each of those  \nclasses would include a test method called  \ntestMultipleCustomerPurchaseOrderEntries(), for example.\n\n\n&gt;&gt; I often use that technique, as well.  By writing out prose, I find\n&gt;&gt; words that I&#39;d like to use in the test method name.\n&gt;\n&gt; True, and most often I do the same thing.  But there are cases where I\n&gt; felt that the prose held more information than the method name I came\n&gt; up with.  I&#39;d already written the prose, so I left it to guide me in\n&gt; the implementation, and describe the situation to the maintainers.\n\nThat sounds reasonable.\n\n&gt; I think folks are overstating my intentions a bit:  I&#39;m *not* saying\n&gt; that *all* tests need javadoc documentation, I&#39;m not even saying that\n&gt; most of them do.  The only point I&#39;m making is that occasionally you\n&gt; need it, and not shipping the javadoc (the original question) makes\n&gt; that occasional-but-important information unavailable to whoever is\n&gt; using the unit tests.\n\nI hear you, and I agree.\n\nIf by &quot;shipping the JavaDoc&quot; you mean not shipping the HTML that the  \n&#39;javadoc&#39; tool produces, then I&#39;m simply saying that the  \noccasional-but-important information is still available in plain text.\n\nWhich leads back to the original question about distributing JavaDoc  \nfor test classes.  I don&#39;t deliver it because my tests generally don&#39;t  \ninclude JavaDoc tags, and in the rare case they did, a maintainer still  \nhas access to the information in the test source.  When I distribute a  \nlibrary, I do include the JavaDoc for its API.  Readers of that  \ninformation seem to me to be a different audience altogether.\n\n---\nMike Clark\nClarkware Consulting, Inc.\nhttp://clarkware.com\n\n\n",
