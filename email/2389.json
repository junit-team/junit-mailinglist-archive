Don&#39;t do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is my testing pattern for EJBs.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn setUp(), begin a transaction. Perhaps create some data used by many/all<br/>\ntest method.<br/>\nIn each test method, create the necessary data and perform the tests. Factor<br/>\nout creation of data if you can.<br/>\nIn tearDown(), rollback the transaction. This way, my test data doesn&#39;t stay<br/>\nin the database.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I am sharing a primary key (which is generated at run time from a database<br/>\n </span></blockquote>sequence) which I have no<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; way of knowing the value of between one test run and the next.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You should be able to write code in a way that that doesn&#39;t matter. For<br/>\nexample, for each ejbCreate() method, write an alternate version that<br/>\naccepts a primary key rather than generates it. Test that method, since you<br/>\ncan easily pass in the primary key you want. Test all your creation<br/>\nscenarios using that method. Write a single test to verify that you can use<br/>\nthe generated keys correctly. This should be enough.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the very least, create the data for each test. Put it in a separate<br/>\nmethod, possibly called by setUp(). It&#39;s easy and it works.<br/>\n<br/>\nJBR.</div>",
