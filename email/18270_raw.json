I tend to look at them more as\nprinciples that I try to follow. I think Kent Beck wrote in his book &quot;Test\ndriven development&quot; that the important thing is not to take teeny tiny steps\nbut to be /able/ to do that.\n\nTDD does not replace communication. Don&#39;t throw out everything you have and\nreplace it with TDD make the transition in a controlled way, remove the\nthings that does not add value from what you curently do, rinse repeat in\ninfinity. (the things that do add value can maybe be made even more\nefficient too)\nYour system doesn&#39;t need to be built from the bottom either, it can be built\nfrom the top or from the middle as the details can be stubbed/mocked as you\ngo.\n\nI like Agile Software development by Robert C Martin since it touches on a\nbit of everthing. Not only tests. Another book on your list?  :)\n\n/J\n\nOn 10/30/06, Tracey Annison &lt;TAnnison@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;   Hiya, Joakim\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks for your reply. Hmmm... there&#39;s maybe a little\n&gt; misinterpretation there, yes... I was assuming that it was the same\n&gt; person writing the code and the tests, NOT two different people.\n&gt; But I&#39;d got the size of the cycle wrong, I think. I&#39;d guessed that\n&gt; you&#39;d write tests for everything a class does, then code the class to\n&gt; suit. But that&#39;s not what you&#39;re saying, is it...\n&gt;\n&gt; In your world, you write a test class that just tries to make an\n&gt; instance of the real class. But it won&#39;t compile, so you make the\n&gt; class and then the test class does compile, and the test works.\n&gt; Then you write a test that tries to run a method, but now the test\n&gt; class won&#39;t compile again because that method doesn&#39;t exist yet. So\n&gt; you write the method, and now the test compiles.\n&gt; Then you add to that test to say what you expect the method to\n&gt; return, and the test fails. So you write the code in the method and\n&gt; now the test passes.\n&gt; And so on, in teeny-tiny steps?\n&gt;\n&gt; Well, I can now see how this can practically be used! And those rules\n&gt; do help to make it clearer. Thank you. And thanks for the FIT\n&gt; pointer, too...\n&gt;\n&gt; But, thinking about it, maybe this cold be a problem to work with,\n&gt; when you&#39;re trying to make a big structure with other developers?\n&gt; Because this builds up from the bottom quite slowly, if I&#39;ve\n&gt; understood it. Doesn&#39;t it take a long while before it&#39;s usable in any\n&gt; way?\n&gt; We&#39;re typically making a whole structure, with DA, DTO, Domain\n&gt; object, MVC layer and SOAP service. One of the benefits of using\n&gt; Interfaces for us, and making whole classes at a time, is that we can\n&gt; code the Interface for the DAO and Domain Object, offering everything\n&gt; we&#39;d need, and use those in the other objects, then fill in the\n&gt; detail in the actual classes. That way, we can work together on one\n&gt; entity. This would be a bit difficult to do if we built it this way,\n&gt; building up bit by bit from the bottom, wouldn&#39;t it?\n&gt;\n&gt; Or maybe I need to think aboutthis some more...\n&gt;\n&gt; Cheers\n&gt; Tracey\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
