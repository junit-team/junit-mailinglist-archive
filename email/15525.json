Another axis which is relevant for us is which area of<br/>\nfunctionality is involved - and that may not always be feasible on a<br/>\npackage/namespace basis. For instance, if all db-schema-sensitive<br/>\ntests are categorised as such, then after making a schema change I can<br/>\nrun all those tests, whether they&#39;re also performance tests or not. In<br/>\nthe situation where running *all* unit tests just isn&#39;t feasible<br/>\nbefore every check-in, being easily able to choose which tests are run<br/>\n(across both NUnit and JUnit, by the way) to verify that nothing&#39;s<br/>\nbeen broken requires more flexibility than a single axis would provide.<br/>\n<br/>\nJon</div>",
