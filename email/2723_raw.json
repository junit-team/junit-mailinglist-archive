The GetOpt package contains an object\noriented mechanism for parsing arbitrarily complex types out of\ncommand-line options. It can and has also been applied to strings in\nproperties files.  Its main advantage is that it factors out and packages\ncommon parsing operations and syntax checking as well as putting all of\nthe error checking up front so that your application can just assume that\nthe runtime configuration is valid. The individual option type classes\n(integers, flags, strings, lists, etc) can be tested in isolation and\ntesting the application classes is correspondingly simplified.\n\nFeel free to use the framework if it appeals, or simply use it as an\nexample. Also feel free to ask me questions about the design, intent, or\nfuture directions of the package.\n\n\nOn Tue, 18 Sep 2001, Paul Michali wrote:\n\n&gt; Vladimir Bossicard wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;In an effort to &quot;improve&quot; things, I thought that I could, for testing,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;use a string as the input stream for the properties and then just\n&gt; &gt; &gt;use strings in the JUnit tests, insead of having a dozen property files.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The question is: what do you want to test?\n&gt; &gt; 1) the loading of the properties files?\n&gt; &gt; 2) the processing of the properties?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;I&#39;d really like to simplify the tests, as there are many properties\n&gt; &gt; &gt;that I want to check to make sure they are processed correctly.\n&gt;\n&gt; I have properties like these:\n&gt;\n&gt; skip.empty.msgs = SLOW, DELAY\n&gt;\n&gt; filter1.1 = some text to filter out for path #1\n&gt; filter1.2 = another filter on path 1\n&gt; filter2.1 = a filter for another path\n&gt;\n&gt; In the first property, I&#39;m parsing out the strings (SLOW and DELAY). In\n&gt; the\n&gt; rest of the properties, I&#39;m looking first to see if they exist and then\n&gt; I&#39;m\n&gt; collecting all the entries for each path and putting them into a List of\n&gt; String. There are others, but this is the gist of what I&#39;m dealing with.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I think the answer is 2...  What I would do is simply create a Propertie\n&gt; &gt; object and fill it with values.  You will easily test your methods\n&gt; &gt; without having dozen of files everywhere.\n&gt;\n&gt; Interesting idea. You&#39;re saying to create a Properties object and then\n&gt; &quot;set&quot; the values as I want and to then process them. That would do some\n&gt; of the testing. However, I also need to make sure some mandatory\n&gt; Properties\n&gt; are there and have values assigned as well.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; PCM (Paul Michali)\n&gt;\n&gt; Carrier Voice Gateway Business Unit (CVGBU)\n&gt; Cisco Systems, Inc.\n&gt; 250 Apollo Drive\n&gt; Chelmsford, MA 01824\n&gt;\n&gt; Phone : (800) 572-6771 x 45817  (978) 244-5817 [direct]\n&gt; Paging: (800) 365-4578 [voice]  pcm@...
