My general take on the matter is that there is no<br/>\n&gt;one answer.  I think the system itself will dictate the best approach. <br/>\n&gt;One thing that I do feel very strongly about is that a plethora or<br/>\n&gt;getters/setters tends to indicate that the object design is faulty.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I disagree. Model objects representing values should be transparent, a la &quot;Naked Objects&quot;. They should let the Model objects containing business logic &quot;do with them what they may&quot;. There is a tendency in OOP to pretend there is behavior where there is no behavior. I think that is a mistake. Some objects in the system are just bags of data. I think public fields should do nicely there. Ward Cunningham has been experimenting with ignoring the prevaling paranoia against public data. I haven&#39;t seen him write anything on it yet, but it&#39;s good to test long-standing &quot;rules&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I<br/>\n&gt;think that goes more for the setters than the getters.  It&#39;s my<br/>\n&gt;contention, and I code this way every day of the week, that an object<br/>\n&gt;should be instantiated in a sane state.  You should not need to &#39;new&#39; an<br/>\n&gt;object and then turn right back around a call 1..N setter methods on it.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Indeed!<br/>\n<br/>\nOne counterexample is an object with 20 fields. Perhaps 20 set methods is clearer, at least in a language like Java with positional parameters. (In Smalltalk it&#39;s exactly the same, so it doesn&#39;t matter.) Should an object have 20 fields? Perhaps not, but some do. It is not clear that breaking that 20-field objects into four 5-field objects is any better.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;snip /&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJ. B.
