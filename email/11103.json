After all tests<br/>\n&gt; of a class have finished I want to perform another thing. Overwriting<br/>\n&gt; tearDown does not work for this requirement, it occurs too often.<br/>\n&gt; When the last test has finished I want to perform something. But it<br/>\n&gt; needs to be within JUnit, not outside of it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So I tried to put this inte XyzTestCase. Its easy to perform<br/>\n&gt; something before every test started. I simply put it into a static<br/>\n&gt; constructor. But how can I perform something after every test has<br/>\n&gt; finished? I tried to overwrite various methods of the upper class<br/>\n&gt; TestCase, but it didn&#39;t help. They were called too frequently or not<br/>\n&gt; at all.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Can you please help me?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Look for junit.extensions.TestSetup.
