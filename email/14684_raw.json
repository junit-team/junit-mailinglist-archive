B. Rainsberger wrote:\n\n&gt; I use Contract Tests (which I used to call Abstract Test Cases, but that \n&gt; old name doesn&#39;t reveal intent) to enforce these restrictions. If you \n&gt; implement me, you&#39;d better pass my Contract Tests, or you don&#39;t really \n&gt; implement me. If the above example were really important, there&#39;d be a test.\n\nThat&#39;s a good idea, and if I&#39;d ever seen it done in practice I might be \nmore willing to accept it. In fact,. I have never once seen an interface \nbased API that came with a set of tests implementations were required to \npass. This includes major APIs shipped by organizations like JavaSoft \nand the W3C, not just internal corporate work and open source hacking.\n\nOf course, I&#39;ve never looked at your codebase. Given that you do this, I \nsuspect your code is likely more robust and reliable than what i see out \nthere, which doesn&#39;t really surprise me. It&#39;s long been known that a \nsmall percentage of programmers are vastly more productive than most \nprogrammers are. I suspect the programmers who hang out on mailing \nlists, attend conferences, write and read articles, and so forth tend to \nbe in the more productive group. However, these are not the majority of \nworking developers, and realistic API design has to work for the \nmajority of client programmers, not just the top 10%.\n\n-- \n﻿Elliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nXML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim\n\n",
