I&#39;ve created MockServerSocket and now my code <br/>\nis able to reliably verify that a socket connection would be accept()<br/>\ned by the ConnectionService at least.  I still can&#39;t think of a way <br/>\nto test that the accept()ed connection is then passed to the <br/>\nConnectionHandler (because of the slight delay after accepting).  I <br/>\nthink  you may have addressed that issue, but I&#39;m not quite sure what <br/>\nyou mean by<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;This could be achieved by creating a wrapper on a socket in the real <br/>\ncode.  this wrapper simply has the responsibility to make connect() <br/>\ncalls to the  ConnectionService whenever a real socket connection is <br/>\nmade.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSince you say &#39;in the real code&#39;, you must not be talking about a <br/>\nMockServerSocket.  Can you expand?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks a lot.  I&#39;ve already improved the test tenfold.<br/>\n<br/>\nDavid Weitzman<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In junit@y..., &quot;Matthew Cooke&quot; &lt;mpcooke3@h...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Hi.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have spent some time thinking about the problems involved with <br/>\ntesting <br/>\n&gt; multithreaded code. As we have had similar problems at work in the <br/>\npast.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The problem is that the monitor-threads model in Java is fairly <br/>\neasy to <br/>\n&gt; understand to start with, but becomes difficult to apply safely in <br/>\nlarge <br/>\n&gt; scale systems. This problem is futher compounded by the fact that <br/>\nunit <br/>\n&gt; testing becomes difficult/impossible, either you test the threaded <br/>\nbehaviour <br/>\n&gt; and have horrible join() sleep() code or you ignore the threading <br/>\naspects. <br/>\n&gt; Even if you unit test everything the threading behaviour of a <br/>\nsystem is <br/>\n&gt; still not captured because the &#39;Unit Tests&#39; test Objects and <br/>\nparellelism is <br/>\n&gt; not contained within objects in the threading model.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am sure if java used the more modern CSP (Communicating <br/>\nSequential <br/>\n&gt; Processes) model then writing junit tests would be much simpler as <br/>\neach bit <br/>\n&gt; of code could be tested outside of a parrallel system. Eg, The <br/>\nparallelism <br/>\n&gt; would not be hidden inside an object or spread across multiple <br/>\nobjects. <br/>\n&gt; Hence Unit testing and Mock CSP Objects could easily be used.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Anyway - I digress.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I think how I would address the problems you are having by testing <br/>\n&gt; separately the socket connection code and the behavoiur you want <br/>\nthe <br/>\n&gt; ConnectionService to have.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This could be achieved by creating a wrapper on a socket in the <br/>\nreal code. <br/>\n&gt; this wrapper simply has the responsibility to make connect() calls <br/>\nto the <br/>\n&gt; ConnectionService whenever a real socket connection is made.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Now the tests on connectionService become non-threaded and non-<br/>\nnetwork <br/>\n&gt; related. calls made to connect should cause the mockFactory to <br/>\ncreate an <br/>\n&gt; object. A call to stopListening should cause the mockSocketWrapper <br/>\nto be <br/>\n&gt; asked to close.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You could still test the &#39;real&#39; behaviour of the socket itself by <br/>\ntesting <br/>\n&gt; the socketWrapper although I wouldn&#39;t bother. I accept that some <br/>\nsimple <br/>\n&gt; wrappers on java libraries don&#39;t need testing becauase hopefully <br/>\nthey are <br/>\n&gt; not buggy ;)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Matt.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;weitzman_d&quot; &lt;weitzman_d@y...&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Reply-To: junit@y...<br/>\n&gt; To: junit@y...<br/>\n&gt; Subject: [junit] Unit testing multithreaded network code<br/>\n&gt; Date: Thu, 29 Aug 2002 21:05:59 -0000<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve asked this question at javaranch.com, so I&#39;ll just provide an<br/>\n&gt; brief description here and point to the original question for anyone<br/>\n&gt; who wants to give it a shot (just reply on this list though).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m writing the beginnings of a multithreaded server, and I had to<br/>\n&gt; insert a lot of calls to Thread.sleep() in my unit testing code for<br/>\n&gt; it to pass.  Is there some good way to test multithreaded code that<br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t invole just waiting a few milliseconds and hoping that a <br/>\ntask<br/>\n&gt; finished?  I imagine that a better solution might involve calls to<br/>\n&gt; join() but tie the unit test closely to the particular <br/>\nimplementation.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Anyway, here&#39;s the original question with my current, unsatisfactory<br/>\n&gt; test (although it doesn&#39;t have much of the code being tested - I<br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t want to clutter the post.  I should add some.):<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://saloon.javaranch.com/cgi-bin/ubb/ultimatebb.cgi?\">http://saloon.javaranch.com/cgi-bin/ubb/ultimatebb.cgi?</a><br/>\n&gt; ubb=get_topic&f=9&t=001390<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Chat with friends online, try MSN Messenger: <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://messenger.msn.com\">http://messenger.msn.com</a> </span></blockquote></div>",
