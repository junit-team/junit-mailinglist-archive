But you could have safely assumed that<br/>\n&gt; anyone asking for use of Junit for web services would necessarily<br/>\n&gt; have common sense of using any of the major search engines. Instead<br/>\n&gt; of sermons on helping me exercise search engine skills, some<br/>\n&gt; concrete info would have been more useful (for example, look at<br/>\n&gt; other responses on this topic).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Oh, you&#39;ve gotta love this. Someone who dumps a quick &quot;please give me<br/>\ninfo about testing web services&quot; email, is now taking me to task about<br/>\nnot making dramatically unlikely assumptions about their level of<br/>\nknowledge.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe vast majority of emails that come through this list of the type<br/>\n&quot;pls u snd me junit info thnx&quot; are from folks who have not used a<br/>\nsearch engine and who are lazy beyond belief. These folks are welcome<br/>\nto receive help when they start following the advice in ESR&#39;s &quot;asking<br/>\nsmart questions&quot;. For the record, I also suggest that you read it. You<br/>\ngave no indication that you had ever touched a search engine. You gave<br/>\nno indication that you knew anything about web services beyond the<br/>\ncorrect spelling of the words. Here&#39;s the link (see, I can be<br/>\nhelpful):<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html\">http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI also noticed quite a large number of useful looking links when I<br/>\ngoogled for &quot;testing web services junit&quot;.
