(I&#39;m also coming from a different language.)\n\nWhat I&#39;m about to descr=\r\nibe could potentially be done continuously, but it is drifting away from Un=\r\nit testing into Integration/Story testing that I would do e.g. every day, o=\r\nr every week.\nSay I have a method that outputs an object of type MyClass.\nI=\r\n have a version of this method in production, and I know it outputs an acce=\r\nptable object.\nWhen I have a release candidate, I would like to calculate t=\r\nhe object with the new code and compare against the object calculated with =\r\nthe production code, ideally according to a user-defined tolerance for floa=\r\nts.\n\nLet&#39;s say I have an integration test which simply calculates the value=\r\n and performs some intrinsic tests on the output.\nI would imagine that with=\r\n some generic, recursive reflection and persistence it would be possible to=\r\n extend JUnit so that I can just add one line to my integration test, so th=\r\nat\n\n1. if the test is run in &quot;integration mode&quot;, that line is ignored\n2. if=\r\n the test is run in &quot;regression_base mode&quot; against production, it persists =\r\nthe output value (expected) somewhere\n3. if the test is run in &quot;regression_=\r\ncompare&quot; mode, it loads back the expected and automatically and generically=\r\n compares it against the actual that I already have in memory at that point=\r\n\n\nand this would work for an arbitrary object of an arbitrary type, without=\r\n requiring the test writer to write anything else. Something like this\n\npub=\r\nlic class MyClassTest extends RegressionTest {\n  @Test\n  public void myInte=\r\ngrationTest() {\n    MyClass myOutput =3D Whatever.StoryTest();\n\n    // This=\r\n is a standard assertion, part of the story test.\n    // It always gets exe=\r\ncuted.\n    assertTrue(&quot;A reasonable amount&quot;, output.GetAmount() &lt; 50);\n\n   =\r\n // This does something different depending on what &quot;mode&quot; the test is runn=\r\ning in.\n    // The last argument is the tolerance for float comparisons\n   =\r\n assertNoRegression(&quot;Regression-testing myOutput&quot;, myObject, 10e-2);\n  }\n}\n=\r\n\nDo you think this can be achieved in Java? Perhaps something has already b=\r\neen done?\n\nThank you\n\n\n",
