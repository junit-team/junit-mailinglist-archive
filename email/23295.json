From a java point of view it is impossible. So how do you<br/>\n&gt; circumvent this problem and how do you make sure your private methods<br/>\n&gt; perform correctly?<br/>\n&gt; Any comment welcome.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve just released a new tool that should solve that problem for you. After several patches =), your java interface is that you can test private methods (i.e. just access it as you would would it have been public) and then behind the scenes at compile-time your &#39;illegal access&#39; is replaced with the equivalent Reflection API calls, i.e. your test will compile and run.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can check it out at www.dp4j.com<br/>\n<br/>\nFeedback is welcome.</div>",
