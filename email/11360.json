    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1008720187\">Hi guys,<br/>\n  Thanks for reading this.<br/>\n  I experience the following problem<br/>\n  with JUnit. My Company developes a <br/>\n  Web Service that receives XML queries.<br/>\n  Some of the queries are very similar.<br/>\n  There are lots of &#39;health&#39; objects on the server.<br/>\n  And more than 10 commands &quot;getlist&quot; which<br/>\n  return XML containing list of these objects.<br/>\n  e.g. &quot;glucose_getlist&quot;, &quot;bloodpresure_getlist&quot;,<br/>\n  &quot;bloodsugar_getlist&quot; etc. <br/>\n  There are also filters for these &quot;getlist&quot; queries<br/>\n  - &quot;newerthan&quot;, &quot;last&quot;, &quot;device_manifacture&quot; etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I wanted to simplify testing these commands, so <br/>\n  I made one &quot;BasicGetListTest&quot; which receives the <br/>\n  name of the object and test for the common <br/>\n  functionality - send a common request and receives <br/>\n  all available objects with this name on the server . <br/>\n  I want to use the result from  this common test in <br/>\n  the other methods with the filters to understand if  <br/>\n  &quot;getlist&quot; with  filter returns all/less/more objects.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Now I there is the problem. I want to run &quot;testCommon&quot;<br/>\n  first which is in the &quot;BasicGetListTest&quot; but when I <br/>\n  subclass it with &quot;GlucoseGetListTest&quot; it is always <br/>\n  executed last. I read some of the postings in this <br/>\n  newsgroup, but it seems that such kind of requirement <br/>\n  point a desing flaw and I should somehow rearrange my <br/>\n  Unit Test Structure to made the tests indepentdant. I&#39;m <br/>\n  stuck with it. On one hand I want to use inheritance to <br/>\n  save code, on the other hand I cannot. <br/>\n  I do not want to use TestSuit also, because this way I<br/>\n  will have to write like 15-20 different similar TestSuits<br/>\n  (one for each action with only a couple of characters <br/>\n   different in the java code).<br/>\n<br/>\n  Do you ,guys, have any fresh ideas how to do this ?<br/>\n<br/>\n  have a nice day and thanks a lot,<br/>\n    Kaloyan</div>",
