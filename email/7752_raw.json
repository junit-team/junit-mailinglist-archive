We should only test a Unit instead of testing the \nunit, the framework, the application server and the database.\n\nWe are a 7 man team with little experience in what we do... We have \nnoone in our team who is an expert.\n\nWhat we do is to use a not finished ERP business framework which \nhides away the technical EJB framework us, the Java developers. This \nframework uses CMP and a Fast Lane Reader. So there are many layers \nbetween the database and the test.\n\nI suggested to use mock objects and Test Driven Development. But the \nsenior programers don&#39;t want it. I listed all the many advantages \nbut couldn&#39;t convince them.\n\n\n",
