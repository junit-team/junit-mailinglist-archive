I don&#39;t do code for &quot;consumers&quot; style end-<br/>\nusers.<br/>\n&gt; More like a system that is put into production at some point, not <br/>\nan app<br/>\n&gt; installed on a desktop. Having a special hook in the app to enable <br/>\nrunning<br/>\n&gt; unit tests on production hardware & software setup might prove <br/>\nvaluable when<br/>\n&gt; you suspect a problem with a JVM for example.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  I totally agree with what Michael expressed below. In my case, I <br/>\ncurrently<br/>\n&gt; work for an IT departement that wants to maintain the code on it&#39;s <br/>\nown after<br/>\n&gt; the project (so &quot;source code is provided&quot;). They are buying code, <br/>\nand we<br/>\n&gt; give them tests as an added bonus. As for bandwith & storage, I <br/>\nthink it is<br/>\n&gt; a moot point. How much for a 20 Gig theses days? If the code is not <br/>\nan<br/>\n&gt; applet, I don&#39;t see why it would generate bandwith loss more than me<br/>\n&gt; downloading mp3s  ;)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; mathieu<br/>\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; From: Michael Silverstein<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Definitely if source code is provided, including test cases make <br/>\nsense. I<br/>\n&gt; think we all agree now that within the context of end-user <br/>\napplication<br/>\n&gt; deployment, it doesn&#39;t make sense to include test cases, except for <br/>\nspecial<br/>\n&gt; diagnostic circumstances. If a product deliverable includes source <br/>\ncode, or<br/>\n&gt; is a framework that provides a set of Java APIs, then a set of test <br/>\ncases is<br/>\n&gt; invaluable for documenting and validating product usage. </span></blockquote></div>",
