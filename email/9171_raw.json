How much value? What is business value? Unless your definition\n&gt; contains definable\n&gt; quantities then your definition is vague and ambiguous.  \n\nFast enough so that my client is willing to keep paying me.* They decide \nhow fast that is based -- one hopes -- on their ROI analysis, which they \nquantify.\n\nEnough value so that my client is willing to keep paying me.....\n\n&gt;Who determines the\n&gt; business value?\n\nThe client. Always.\n\n&gt; Do you go out and get ROI numbers on the projects you do for your customers?\n\nActually yes. I just asked a client to estimate cost savings based on \nsoftware of mine that they used. They quantified it for me.\n\n&gt; Or is business\n&gt; value a feel good thing that you and your customer agree on at the end of\n&gt; the project?\n\nThe client defines business value continuously throughout the project.\n\nTake care.\n\n-----\n* I might factor in how much future business I can expect from \nreferrals, but let us keep the model simple for now.\n\n-- \nJ.
