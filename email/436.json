At least one of the tools I<br/>\nevaluated used source code rewriting and basically did what your tech<br/>\nlead proposed you do manually. Personally, I think you&#39;d be nuts to do<br/>\nit manually. At the very least, grab a Java parser and rewrite it to<br/>\nspit out instrumented Java source.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think any of the tools would detect the situation where an<br/>\nException is not caught in the code and no test caused it to be thrown.<br/>\nThis might happen with either RuntimeException or with a method that<br/>\ndeclares some exceptions in its throw clause and allows them to<br/>\npropagate up. In fact, I&#39;m pretty sure one can&#39;t detect that in the<br/>\ngeneral case.<br/>\n<br/>\ne.g. the code below if never called with null foo, could still result<br/>\nin 100% coverage. The theoretical way to handle this in the coverage<br/>\ntool is to add an edge to the control flow graph for each possible<br/>\nexception, but since RuntimeException and Error aren&#39;t declared in the<br/>\nthrows clause....<br/>\n<br/>\npublic void mightGetNullPointerException(Object foo) {<br/>\n  if (foo.equals(this.myFoo)) {<br/>\n    // ...<br/>\n  }<br/>\n}<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards,<br/>\n<br/>\nRob<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet personalized email addresses from Yahoo!
