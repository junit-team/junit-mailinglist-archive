However some of the postings on this list imply that\n3.4 *does* have the UI components.  Where can I find them?\n\nI&#39;m sorry to keep asking questions, I guess I&#39;ve got my stupid head on\ntoday.  thanks for your time, APC\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Brian Button [mailto:bbutton01@...]\nSent: 10 January 2001 14:12\nTo: junit@egroups.com\nSubject: RE: [junit] JUnit tests raise NoClassDefFoundError with log4j\n\n\nAndrew,\n\nYou don&#39;t say if you are using junit 3.2 or 3.4. If it is 3.2, then the\nproblem is more than likely that that version of the tool doesn&#39;t know how\nto find classes that are in jar files using its custom class loader. There\nare instructions somewhere in the doc directory about how to tell the class\nloader not to try to load these classes, but to defer their loading to the\nsystem class loader.\n\nIf you&#39;re using 3.4, then we need to talk more :)\n\nbab\n\n----\nBrian Button       bbutton@...\nSenior Consultant  Object Mentor, Inc.\nSt. Louis, MO      http://www.objectmentor.com\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: APC [mailto:andrew.clarke@...]\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, January 10, 2001 5:52 AM\n&gt; To: junit@egroups.com\n&gt; Subject: [junit] JUnit tests raise NoClassDefFoundError with log4j\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I am developing a program that uses the open source package log4j as\n&gt; a logging tool.  my Junit tests ran green and clean until I\n&gt; introduced calls to log4j.  the program compiles but when i run the\n&gt; tests they fail with NoClassDefFoundError for the log4j components.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m raising this here because when I created a little class with a\n&gt; main method to call my log() code it runs (sort of, it fails half\n&gt; way thru&#39; with a NullPointerException but I hope to resolve that).\n&gt;\n&gt; So my question is: why doesn&#39;t JUnit like log4j?  Has anybody else\n&gt; experienced something like this?  Do I need to alter my system\n&gt; configuration?  Currently the log4j.jar is resident in my lib&#92;ext\n&gt; directory.\n&gt;\n&gt; tia, APC\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@egroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\njunit-unsubscribe@egroups.com\n\n\n\n",
