I&#39;d do this most often in exception<br/>\n&gt; handling code, where I don&#39;t have strong customer input about the right<br/>\n&gt; thing to do, but still want to have defined behavior.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On the other hand, if adding the exit was because of an explicit<br/>\n&gt; customer request or bug report, I&#39;d probably add a shell script to my<br/>\n&gt; system (&quot;customer&quot;) tests, outside of JUnit, to make sure that I&#39;d<br/>\n&gt; captured the bug and the fix. I haven&#39;t done this for System.exit yet,<br/>\n&gt; but I have for other behavior only observable from the command line.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; David Saff<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s in agreement with what I&#39;m saying. I&#39;m trusting that System.exit(status)<br/>\ndoes what it says on the tin, and I just want to test that it gets called at<br/>\nthe appropriate time. I realise there are occasions when an element of the<br/>\ncore Java classes has a bug in it - Elliotte, I think you&#39;ve talked about<br/>\ncharacterset handling in different versions of Java on one of your cafe<br/>\nsites. I would consider that problem outside the scope of my control, raise<br/>\na bug and look for an alternative way of providing the necessary<br/>\nfunctionality.<br/>\n<br/>\nJames<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
