It may not be easy to extend the framework to get your \nnumbers and still get &quot;close enough&quot; to the actual test execution to get \nmeaningful numbers.\n\nIt might turn out that the test fixture setup is obscuring the actual \nexecution time of the tests.  FOr example, if the fixture setup takes \nmuch longer than the actual execution of the Class Under Test.  This \nwould make it difficult to get meaningful numbers, since the variance in \nthe fixture execution time would obscure the actual test performance \nnumbers.\n\nIn this situation, you could come up with some scheme to wrap the \nmonitoring around the actual call to your Class Under Test, and avoid \nincluding your fixture setup in the monitoring.\n\nAOP could be well suited for this type of task, because otherwise you \nwould have to duplicate this monitoring code (or at least remember to \nduplicate a call to it) in each test method.\n\nThen again, there could be a way to accomplish the same thing with Plain \nOld Java.  Maybe by routing all calls to the Class Under Test through a \nmonitoring method.  This could take the class name, method name, and any \nparams, then use some fancy reflection to invoke the method and gather \nthe elapsed time.\n\n-- Chad\n\nJim Dixon wrote:\n&gt; I haven&#39;t done very careful testing, but I certainly have noticed that\n&gt; the times reported by JUnit vary a great deal.\n&gt; \n&gt; Running one simple set of tests just now gave me results in which 50%\n&gt; differences were common and more than one test took 3x as long from one\n&gt; run to the next.  So, sure, you can use JUnit for this sort of simple\n&gt; performance testing, but you should at least run the tests enough times to\n&gt; build statistical confidence in the results.\n&gt; \n&gt; It didn&#39;t show up in these few runs, but I believe that I have noticed\n&gt; before that the first test reported a much longer than normal time --\n&gt; seconds rather than milliseconds.  So the order in which tests are run\n&gt; might introduce an effect large enough to render the results useless.\n\n\n\n\n",
