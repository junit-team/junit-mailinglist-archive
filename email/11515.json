(I skimmed, as my Smalltalk<br/>\nis null and void.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI did however read the PRIOR flamewar on here about<br/>\nheirarchical tests, which erupted over a similar issue,<br/>\nalthough not clearly dealing with an external stateful<br/>\nsystem.<br/>\n<br/>\nI respectfully disagree, but from your responses to that one,<br/>\nit&#39;s clear that we&#39;re going to disagree on this.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen testing systems, I believe that tests should be clearly<br/>\nseperate, and you should test one piece of functionality at<br/>\na time.<br/>\n<br/>\nI actually implemented the storage system for this project<br/>\nusing test-first, and making each one of those individual<br/>\ntests pass, before moving to the next one.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf it had been one big test, I wouldn&#39;t have been able to<br/>\ndo that.  It would never have passed until the entire<br/>\nsystem, from front to back, worked completely.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn order to make that work, I had to use static variables<br/>\nin the class.  I thought that stunk, at first, but did it in<br/>\norder to make it all work, and be able to test parts of<br/>\nfunctionality as I built the system.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the time came to test multi-threaded, that smell<br/>\nbecame unbearable, and I hoped someone had a solution.<br/>\n<br/>\nI understand now that this is not something the test<br/>\nframework intended to address.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy apologies, I didn&#39;t intend to reignite what is apparently<br/>\na well-worn tread of flame.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe test differently, is all.<br/>\n<br/>\n--  Morgan Schweers<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;J.
