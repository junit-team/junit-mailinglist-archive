The\n&gt; &gt; constructor of each test instance is called just\nbefore @Before.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; So my question - is this a designed behaviour? Can\nI assume that\n&gt; junit 4 runners will have\n&gt; &gt; this behaviour, allowing me to use the constructor\ninstead of\n&gt; @Before, allowing fields to\n&gt; &gt; be final, etc?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yes, this is designed behavior (as is, in your\nsecond message,\n&gt; releasing\n&gt; each test object for potential garbage collection\nafter the test\n&gt; completes). You can trust the runners that ship with\nJUnit 4 to\n&gt; preserve it. If you invoke a custom runner, you&#39;re\ncurrently at the\n&gt; mercy of that runner&#39;s writer.\n&gt;\n&gt; In my own code, I use constructors in JUnit 4 tests,\nunless I&#39;m doing\n&gt; something that I want to be visually matched with a\nparticular @After.\n\nExcellent, thank you.\n\nIt wasn&#39;t something that I had seen mentioned in the\nJUnit 4 write-\nups, and for our suite of 700-odd tests, many of which\nare functional\ntests which fire up the GUI, talk to the database,\nplay media with\nQuickTime etc, it should increase stability\nsignificantly.\n\nJust waiting now for a decent ant task...;-)\n\nDuncan\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\n___________________________________________________________ \nAll New Yahoo!
