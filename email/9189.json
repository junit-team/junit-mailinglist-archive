I&#39;ve seen this too.  I call them &quot;riveters&quot; since I&#39;ve been <br/>\n&gt; reading a book on the design and construction of the Empire State <br/>\n&gt; Building and the analogy seems apt.  The riveters don&#39;t design or do <br/>\n&gt; anything sophisticated -- they just rivet together the beams that you <br/>\n&gt; tell them to.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I find it hard to believe that this works. It just seems like a huge <br/>\nwaste. One talented programmer does the work of five not-so-talented <br/>\nones at 60% of the price (of the five).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  &gt; In my current project, we don&#39;t even have any dedicated QA people; the<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; programmers themselves are responsible for doing all of the<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; QA. We ended up with a very heavily automated solution, one we never<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; could have had without QA staff who were programmers to the point that<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; they could change our software internals to make it more testable.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sounds cool.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hm. Do you mean that you don&#39;t have people who test full time? or you <br/>\ndon&#39;t have people will formal testing experience and/or raw testing skill?<br/>\n<br/>\nGoogle &quot;What is exploratory testing?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ.
