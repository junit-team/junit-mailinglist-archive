b &lt; 200.\n\nSo now we are wondering whether our method works?\n\nBy looking at the constraint for a&b, being that &quot;a&quot;\nis an int, and &quot;b&quot; is a further constrained int, \n\nand the mapping the method performs we know all the\npossible return values.\n\nWe also know all the possible input values.\n\nBut we don&#39;t want to test every single input to\noutput...\n\n101X1, 102X1, ...\n\nSo which ones do we test?\n\nLet&#39;s start with the assuming that were always going\nto pass legal values.\n\nSo we want to test the type constraint on a and b,\nbeing int.\n\nSo lets just assume that on the platform we are\nrunning legal values are \n\n-2222222222222222222 to 2222222222222222222\n\nSo we use these two end of range values.\n\nAnd we test\n\n101 and 199 for b, since that represents b&#39;s set of\nedge points.\n\nSo the combinations we want to test for any\nmathematical operations with these two parameters are:\n\n b              a\n101 X -2222222222222222222\n101 X 2222222222222222222\n199 X -2222222222222222222\n199 X 2222222222222222222\n\nIf X works the way it&#39;s supposed to, then these tests\nshould pass.\n\nAlso, we test\n b              a\n99  X -2222222222222222222\n99  X 2222222222222222222\n201 X -2222222222222222222\n201 X 2222222222222222222\n\nThese should not pass.\n\nThen we assume that all other values are taken care\ndue to the definition of X.\n\nSo were did we get the \n\n99,201,199,101,2222222222222222222,-2222222222222222222\nvalues from.\n\nLets think of a and b as being datatypes.\n\nb is just a new datatype that can only\nhave values between 100 and 200.\n\nSo a DataType is just meta data defining an allowed\nset of values...which is where EMF or Java reflection\ncomes in.  You would use them to analyze the meta data\ndefined for a type.  Then combine that with knowledge\nof operators to generate test cases.\n\nDoes that make more sense?\n\nCheers,\n- Ole\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- David Saff &lt;saff@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; Ole,\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m getting my head around your suggestions.
