Has anyone got any stratagies for unit testing them? Or<br/>\n&gt;possibly, do you think that they shouldn&#39;t be unit tested at all, only<br/>\n&gt;tested at the functional/system testing level.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Not knowing MDBs intimately, I would offer the general suggestion to<br/>\nmove as much of the logic as possible into a plain Java class and test<br/>\nthat class. No need for EJB containers and the like. The MDB then<br/>\nbecomes glue code that may be too simple to break on its own.<br/>\n<br/>\nJ. B.
