Really?\n\nI think we have some time. There was =\r\nsome delay between TestNG being\nreleased and the release of JUnit 4.0, but =\r\nJUnit 4 still got adopted.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Also agree with David that watching the ste=\r\nps of other new frameworks is\nimportant as well.\n\nI was thinking about that=\r\n. JavaScript is a functional language, but all of\nthe JS test frameworks th=\r\nat I am aware of use JUnit-like syntax for\ndefining test cases (JsUnit defi=\r\nnes test functions at global scope,\nJsTestDriver uses methods on a class). =\r\nIf functional programming could\nchange the paradigm for defining tests, you=\r\n would think it would have\nhappened in JavaScript.\n\nAm I missing something?=\r\n\n\nSure, you could use functional programming to write more powerful\nasserti=\r\nons, but that could be done in an assertion framework.\n\nThe places I see wh=\r\nere functional programming could help are Theories\nand parametrised tests. =\r\nI think we could do that in JUnit4 with at most a\nnew core Runner.\n\nSure, t=\r\nhere are many parts of the implementation of JUnit 4 that I would\nlove to c=\r\nhange, but building a new Java test framework from scratch would\nbe a large=\r\n effort. One often-forgotten piece is all the tooling (IDE\nintegration, bui=\r\nld tool integration, etc).\n\n- Kevin\n\n&gt;\n&gt; The modularity, as somebody mentio=\r\nned, has to be also considered, but\nwithout knowing the outcome it is quite=\r\n difficult.\n&gt;\n&gt; So perhaps template tests under new languages without havin=\r\ng a framework\nshould be written first to see what wants to be reached.\n&gt; Fe=\r\natures and goals from other projects should be considered.\n&gt;\n&gt; BR, Tibor\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; --- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;jens_schauder&quot; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; It looks lik=\r\ne Closure will finally find their way into Java. With this\nfeature many nic=\r\ne ways to do thing become possible. Therefore I am\nwondering if other peopl=\r\ne agree that it might be time for a JUnit5 putting\nthis new feature to good=\r\n use.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; A source for inspiration for me in this regard are the FunSui=\r\nte of\nScalaTest http://www.scalatest.org/getting_started_with_fun_suite\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; There a test definition is a method call (instead of a method\ndefiniti=\r\non in JUnit) that registers a test for execution. It looks roughly\nlike thi=\r\ns:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; class MyTestClass{\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; test(&quot;The test name&quot;){\n&gt; &gt; // the=\r\n actual test goes here\n&gt; &gt; }\n&gt; &gt; }\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; With this approach things like R=\r\nules become extremly trivial, since all\nyou have to do is wrap the code blo=\r\nck (i.e. closure) in a new new code\nblock.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Also parameterized test =\r\nbecome fairly easy, because you would just put\nthe call to test in a loop.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; What do you think? Is this an interesting direction for JUnit to go=\r\n?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; kind regards\n&gt; &gt; Jens\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n\n[Non-text portions of this messa=\r\nge have been removed]\n\n\n",
