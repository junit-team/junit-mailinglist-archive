Also Uncle Bob came up with a workaround of creating co=\r\nntexts by using inner static classes and inheritance (this is all the exper=\r\nimental Enclosed runner supports). I felt like this was wrong and also, tha=\r\nt it should be possible to come up with a test runner that supports somethi=\r\nng like the Ruby Specs Contexts.\n\nThe idea was born and I started to work o=\r\nn a hierarchical context runner for JUnit, supporting a structure like the =\r\nfollowing:\n\n@RunWith(HierarchicalContextRunner.class)\npublic class MainTest=\r\n {\n  // ... some constants and helpers ...\n\n  @BeforeClass\n  public static =\r\nvoid runsOnlyOnce_Before_AllTestsInMainTest() throws Exception {...}\n\n  @Af=\r\nterClass\n  public static void runsOnlyOnce_After_AllTestsInMainTest() throw=\r\ns Exception {...}\n\n  @Test\n  public void simpleTestInTheMainContext() throw=\r\ns Exception {...}\n\n  @Test\n  public void anotherTestInTheMainContext() thro=\r\nws Exception {...}\n\n  // ... more tests in the main context ...\n\n  public c=\r\nlass SubContext {\n    @Before\n    public void runs_Before_EachTestWithinSub=\r\nContextAndAllContainingContexts() {...}\n\n    @After\n    public void runs_Af=\r\nter_EachTestWithinSubContextAndAllContainingContexts() {...}\n\n    @Test\n   =\r\n public void simpleTestInTheSubContext() throws Exception {...}\n\n    // ...=\r\n more tests in the sub context ...\n\n    public class SubSubContext1 {\n     =\r\n @Before\n      public void runs_Before_EachTestWithinSubSubContext1AndAllCo=\r\nntainingContexts() {...}\n\n      @After\n      public void runs_After_EachTes=\r\ntWithinSubSubContext1AndAllContainingContexts() {...}\n\n      @Test\n      pu=\r\nblic void simpleTestInTheSubSubContext1() throws Exception {...}\n\n      // =\r\n... more tests in the sub sub context 1 ...\n    }\n\n    public class SubSubC=\r\nontext2 {\n      @Before\n      public void runs_Before_EachTestWithinSubSubC=\r\nontext2AndAllContainingContexts() {...}\n\n      @After\n      public void run=\r\ns_After_EachTestWithinSubSubContext2AndAllContainingContexts() {...}\n\n     =\r\n @Test\n      public void simpleTestInTheSubSubContext2() throws Exception {=\r\n...}\n\n      // ... more tests in the sub sub context 2 ...\n    }\n}\nIn this =\r\nexample one can see, that tests with equal preconditions can be grouped int=\r\no contexts. It doesn&#39;t matter how many contexts you have and it doesn&#39;t mat=\r\nter how deep your context hierarchy grows. The HierarchicalContextRunner su=\r\npports as many contexts as you are required to create to structure your tes=\r\nts well and nicely. (More examples can be found within the samples folder)\n=\r\n\nInstead of using inner static classes, the hierarchical context runner sup=\r\nports member classes to create a context. This has several advantages over =\r\nthe use of static classes:\n\t=95 No inheritance!\n\t=95 Well structured tests\n=\r\n\t=95 The context hierarchy is represented within the outline of your IDE\n\t=\r\n=95 The tests within an inner context have access to all members of a highe=\r\nr level context.\n\t=95 Static inner classes are not scanned for tests (accor=\r\nding to the BlockJUnit4ClassRunner) and can be used to create stubs and hel=\r\npers\nThe tricky parts were to support the creation of the test instance and=\r\n to execute all @Before, @After and @Rule statements along the context hier=\r\narchy for each test.\n\nThe test instance needs to be built top-down, i.e. cr=\r\neate the top level instance, which is required to create the first level in=\r\nstance, which is required to create the second level instance, etc., until =\r\nthe actual test instance can be created. In order to execute all @Before, @=\r\nAfter and @Rule statements defined along the hierarchy of a context another=\r\n extension needs to be placed to scan all classes along the context hierarc=\r\nhy and gather the statements accordingly.\n\nWith these changes in place the =\r\nrunner works great. As it was built upon the BlockJUnit4ClassRunner it also=\r\n supports all features that are supported by this runner. Therefore, no nee=\r\nd to hesitate. Check it out today and give it a try. Feedback is very welco=\r\nmed and appreciated. :)\n\nTo use the runner, simply add the following maven =\r\ndependency to your project or click one of the downloads below:\n&lt;dependency=\r\n&gt;\n  &lt;groupId&gt;de.bechte.junit&lt;/groupId&gt;\n  &lt;artifactId&gt;junit-hierarchicalcont=\r\nextrunner&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n  &lt;version&gt;4.11.1&lt;/version&gt;\n  &lt;scope&gt;test&lt;/scope&gt;\n&lt;/=\r\ndependency&gt;\nOr simply download it from the wiki page where all this stuff i=\r\ns also explained:\nhttps://github.com/bechte/junit-hierarchicalcontextrunner=\r\n/wiki\n\nI really appreciate all kind of feedbacks and hope you give the runn=\r\ner a chance to evaluate your tests. I use it almost for all my tests and gr=\r\noup this into a context whenever they have a common setup. This leads to a =\r\nstyle where your contexts are all your &quot;GIVEN&quot; statements, and the tests ex=\r\npress themselves by &quot;WHEN_THEN&quot;. Very nice. Give it a try, please. :-)\n\nI a=\r\nm looking forward to getting any feedback.\n\nThanks\nbechte\n\n-- \n\nStefan Bech=\r\ntold\n\neCard: http://ecard.bechte.de/\n\nhttp://www.bechte.de, http://twitter.=\r\ncom/bechte \n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
