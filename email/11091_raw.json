One of the concerns that I (and\n&gt; developers) have is that we will end up with thousands of test cases, many\n&gt; of which will involve using substantial amounts of MockObjects to set up\n&gt; test cases and that all this will become too much of an overhead to manage &\n&gt; maintain. Specifically,  that changing code in the future will involve\n&gt; analysis of not only the project code but also the junit test code - an\n&gt; overhead we don&#39;t have today of course.\n\nTests are not overhead; they are the safety net that /enables/ you to \nmake changes confidently. They /save/ you time & effort. Without tests, \nhow do you know that a change you made didn&#39;t break something?\n\nIf a simple change to code results in a tedious change to tests, then \nyou have a design problem that needs to be addressed. It&#39;s tough to be \nmore specific without discussing a specific case. In that case, call in \nan expert.\n\n&gt; Has anyone applied junit on a large scale such as this? I&#39;d love to hear\n&gt; comments about pros & cons and lessons learned etc.\n\nBottom line: do you want it to work or not? If you want it to work, you \nhave to test it. If you can find a better way than JUnit, then do it. :)\n\nSometimes it just requires a lot of work. Big systems require big work \n-- that makes sense to me. The tricky part is distinguishing these two \nsituations:\n\n1. It takes big work because it&#39;s big.\n2. It takes big work because the design sucks in a specific way.\n\nHow do you learn to distinguish them? With experience.\n\nStart slowly, and when you get into trouble, call in the experts. \nInformally you can use the mailing list, and if your company needs a \nlarger level of support, then let me know and we can explore more \ncost-effective means of providing better support.\n\nGood luck!\n-- \nJ.
