But alas, I\nbelieve we are off-topic now.  You are correct in the sense that it\nreduces memory usage, but as a habit (personally) I feel it should be\navoided.  If I must optimize, this is surely a good optimization place. \nFor example:\n\n  BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(file));\n  String line = null;\n  while ( (line = reader.readLine()) != null ) {\n    doSomethingWith(line);\n  }\n\nis _MUCH_ cheaper (in terms of allocation) than:\n\n  BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(file));\n  while ( reader.ready() ) {\n    String line = reader.readLine();    \n    doSomethingWith(line);\n  }\n\n=jason\n\nOn Mon, 2004-04-05 at 15:44, Kathy Van Stone wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Strings are immutable, so I don&#39;t see that this can happen. What am I \n&gt; &gt; missing?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Sounds like you need to read up on references...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;The simple version is that &quot;ABC&quot; may be living at slot A in memory.  You\n&gt; &gt;then set your variable newLoginId to equal that, which is to say that\n&gt; &gt;there is some slot in memory (let&#39;s call it B) that now points to A.\n&gt; &gt;Then you set your dupLoginId variable that lives at slot C in memory and\n&gt; &gt;tell it to point to slot B, which is pointing to slot A which is &quot;ABC&quot;.\n&gt; &gt;Yes, strings are immutable, but that means nothing in this case.  You\n&gt; &gt;have 2 references to the same object in memory.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes, but if that object is guaranteed never to change (which is true of \n&gt; Strings), what is the harm? This is the type of aliasing that is considered \n&gt; beneficial, as it reduces memory usage.\n&gt; \n&gt; Actually by the above model I believe that the dupLoginId points to A not B \n&gt; as &quot;value&quot; of a reference is the memory it points to and = copies \n&gt; values.  To check, run the following code:\n&gt; \n&gt; String a = &quot;abc&quot;;\n&gt; String b = a;\n&gt; a = &quot;cde&quot;;\n&gt; System.out.println(b);\n&gt; \n&gt; It will print &quot;abc&quot;.  (At least it did when I tried it out in bsh).\n&gt; \n&gt; (Also see Item 4 of Effective Java).\n&gt; \n&gt; -Kathy Van Stone\n&gt; kvs@...\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo!
