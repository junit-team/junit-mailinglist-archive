Besides, the original\n&gt; poster was not necessarily talking=\r\n about unit testing.\n&gt;\n&gt; Time and again, I&#39;ve had the need to create tests =\r\nthat depend on each\n&gt; other. It&#39;s not very common (most of my tests are iso=\r\nlated), but when\n&gt; you encounter this problem, you really need a way to spe=\r\ncify that\n&gt; certain tests depend on each other, for two reasons:\n&gt;\n&gt; - You =\r\nare testing logic that has dependencies itself, so it should\n&gt; come as no s=\r\nurprise that the tests that exercise it need dependencies\n&gt; as well.\n&gt;\n&gt; - =\r\nMore accurate reporting. In the case where a test that failed\n&gt; causes doze=\r\nns of others to fail as well, would you rather read &quot;1\n&gt; SUCCESS, 19 FAILUR=\r\nES&quot; or &quot;1 SUCCESS, 1 FAILURE, 18 SKIPS&quot;?\n&gt;\n&gt; The latter error message singl=\r\nes out the test that really failed and\n&gt; also tells you that for now, you c=\r\nan ignore the other 18 tests that\n&gt; were skipped because they didn&#39;t really=\r\n fail: they simply didn&#39;t run.\n&gt;\n&gt; The fact that JUnit doesn&#39;t support depe=\r\nndent testing was one of the\n&gt; reasons why I created TestNG in the first pl=\r\nace, and David, I still\n&gt; have some hope that at some point, JUnit is going=\r\n to go beyond its\n&gt; &quot;unit testing&quot; scope and start addressing other forms o=\r\nf testing as\n&gt; well :-)\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt; Cedric\n&gt; http://testng.org\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n[Non-te=\r\nxt portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
