I ended up making a packeage test case that=\r\n\nran all the rest as well as some of it&#39;s own. I find myself writing a samp=\r\nle\nusage (outside the package) - something a client would do or use as an\ne=\r\nxample or maybe to load test. So I made this guy run the package test and\nt=\r\nhen his own tests. Seems like we will end up with some kind of hierarchy of=\r\n\ntests.\n\nWe make web apps and do some web services, so we will have a few d=\r\nifferent\nkinds of test (cactus, httpunut, ...)\n\nI&#39;m sure that the engineers=\r\n and qa people have been inventing this stuff for\n50 years. Otoh, we may no=\r\nt want to inherit all of that. faqs like\nhttp://www.faqs.org/faqs/software-=\r\neng/testing-faq/ may be some kind of happy\nmedium?\n\nI was wondering kinds o=\r\nf hierarchies and what dependencies between the types\nand levels of testing=\r\n that people who use junit have invented?\n\nAny pointers will be appreciated=\r\n.\n\nThanks\n\n\n\n",
