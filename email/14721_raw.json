Every public class added to a library expands the \n&gt; complexity of the library more than linearly. Usable APIs need to place \n&gt; the needs of the user ahead of the needs of the original developer. \n\nAnd that&#39;s why you distinguish between &quot;public&quot; and &quot;published&quot;, Elliotte.\n\nThis is why you can provide an &quot;API&quot; jar and a &quot;runtime&quot; jar. This is\nwhy you provide a list of packages to JavaDoc. And this is why you\nmake it clear that people deviate from your API to use the\nimplementation-dependent aspects at their own risk.\n\nHeck, as you said later, this is also what package-private is for. As\nI&#39;ve stated earlier, I use a default of package private when I extract\na new &quot;public&quot; class.\n\nRobert.\n\n\n\n",
