We are not verifying Count\nin this test, but rather indexing.  Although I would argue that it is\nnice to have pre-requisites satisfied in the middle of a test, to help\ndirect your attention to the true cause of the issue.\n\nMuch like the snowball effect of the nuclear reactor plant example.  A\ndefect occurs, which in turn causes other defects (which in turn\ncauses more defects, and so on).  From an analysis perspective it is\ndifficult to pin-point the root defect because it is being masks but\nsubsequent ones.  Unlike the above example, where the order of the\ndefects can be used to unravel the issue, in testing order is\nindependent, so the primary defects are not necessarily those that\noccur first.\n\nTo address this, it would interesting to append two additional bits of\ninformation on an assertion.\n\n1) Assumption.AreEqual(3,list.Count,&quot;Check the count, and the add methods&quot;);\n2) Corollory.IsTrue(list.ContainsOnly(typeof(string)));\n\nAn assumption is really a pre-requisite - that if fails, really means\nthat you were not even able to set-up to do the real testing.  Having\nassumptions fail helps to pin-point coupling between components - as\nwell as helps direct your attention was secondary failing tests to the\nprimary ones (aka the failed Assertions).\n\nAn corollary is something you believe to be true, but is not essential\nto your unit test itself.  Corollaries are nice because you indirectly\nadd additional tests for other components of our system without that\nmuch extra overhead.  Failing corollaries may highlight obscure bugs\nin other parts of your system, or they highlight your\nmis-understanding of those other parts (or they highlight a change to\nthe underlying assumptions of those parts).\n\n\n\n\nOn Thu, 8 Jul 2004 10:22:01 +0000, Jason Rogers\n&lt;jacaetevha@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; On Wednesday 07 July 2004 10:49 pm, Curt Sampson wrote:\n&gt; &gt;  On Tue, 6 Jul 2004, hedgi wrote:\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;   Now I there is the problem.

I read some of\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;   the postings in this newsgroup, but it seems that such kind of\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;   requirement point a desing flaw and I should somehow rearrange my\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;   Unit Test Structure to made the tests indepentdant. I&#39;m stuck with\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;   it.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  I&#39;ve been thinking for a while that this is a serious problem in JUnit\n&gt; &gt;  (and most unit testing frameworks), because it&#39;s been such an annoyance\n&gt; &gt;  for so many people. Let&#39;s face it; a lot of groups of tests do have\n&gt; &gt;  known dependencies between tests such that if test A fails, we know that\n&gt; &gt;  the output of tests B, C and D are uninteresting. Yet we end up running\n&gt; &gt;  B, C and D anyway, and then searching through all the error output for\n&gt; &gt;  the failure that we know is the &quot;real&quot; one, ignoring all the others as\n&gt; &gt;  spurious.\n&gt; \n&gt; With all due respect, I believe that is a code smell.  It seems to say to me\n&gt; that there is something not right about the design of the code being tested,\n&gt; or perhaps even more elusive, something is wrong with how the tests are\n&gt; written.  When I find these types of dependencies I inevitably rethink how I\n&gt; have written my tests.  Have I coded in the dependencies or are they really\n&gt; there.  More times than not I have coded in the dependencies -- and therefore\n&gt; I can remove them.  Further, I would argue that I _NEED_ to remove them.\n&gt; Now, maybe I am old-fashioned but I believe tests (at least at the\n&gt; unit/programmer level) ought to be as autonomous as possible.\n&gt; \n&gt; --\n&gt; Jason Rogers\n&gt; 117 N.
