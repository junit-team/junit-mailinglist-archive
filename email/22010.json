ScalaTest is for all<br/>\n&gt; practical purposes a &quot;JUnit add-on&quot; that facilitates using JUnit and<br/>\n&gt; Scala together. The promise is that by writing tests in Scala, you can<br/>\n&gt; reduce the lines of test code you need to maintain by half or more,<br/>\n&gt; and at the same time increase the clarity of that code. That&#39;s the<br/>\n&gt; benefit. The up front cost is you need to learn Scala. But ScalaTest<br/>\n&gt; does let you mix in tests written in Scala with your existing tests<br/>\n&gt; written in Java, so it is easy to dip your toe in before jumping in. I<br/>\n&gt; also think writing tests in Scala is a good way to start learning and<br/>\n&gt; getting experience with Scala, because it is important code, but not<br/>\n&gt; your production code. So it reduces the risk of trying a new language.<br/>\n&gt; And you can certainly write tests in Scala to test production code<br/>\n&gt; written in Java.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; You can get a good overview of ScalaTest&#39;s JUnit integration on this page:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.scalatest.org/getting_started_with_junit\">http://www.scalatest.org/getting_started_with_junit</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; You can see we have good integration with both JUnit 3 and 4 (because<br/>\n&gt; I know many people are still using JUnit 3). One other thing to keep<br/>\n&gt; in mind is that because of the org.junit.runner.Runner class, which we<br/>\n&gt; extend in our org.scalatest.junit.JUnitRunner class, you can pretty<br/>\n&gt; much write tests in any style you want and run them with JUnit. For<br/>\n&gt; example, you could write in a Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) style<br/>\n&gt; and still run the tests with JUnit. So ScalaTest adds BDD to JUnit in<br/>\n&gt; effect, and other styles as well. By annotating with JUnitRunner, you<br/>\n&gt; can use JUnit to run tests written with any of the &quot;Suite&quot; or &quot;Spec&quot;<br/>\n&gt; traits you see here:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.scalatest.org/quick_start\">http://www.scalatest.org/quick_start</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Here&#39;s a list of the ScalaTest/JUnit integration points:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; - AssertionsForJUnit, ShouldMatchersForJUnit, and<br/>\n&gt; MustMatchersForJUnit, which provide concise, readable assertion and<br/>\n&gt; matcher DSLs, ensure that assertion failures are reported as<br/>\n&gt; &quot;failures&quot; not &quot;errors&quot; by JUnit and its ecosystem<br/>\n&gt; - JUnit3Suite extends junit.framework.TestCase as well as<br/>\n&gt; org.scalatest.Suite, which allows you to write traditional TestCase<br/>\n&gt; tests that can be run by either JUnit 3 or ScalaTest<br/>\n&gt; - JUnitSuite extends org.scalatest.Suite, and allows you to write<br/>\n&gt; traditional JUnit 4-style tests (with @Test annotation, etc.) that can<br/>\n&gt; be run by either JUnit 4 or ScalaTest<br/>\n&gt; - JUnitWrapperSuite allows you to run existing JUnit tests written in<br/>\n&gt; Java (or Groovy, etc.) with ScalaTest&#39;s Runner<br/>\n&gt; - JUnitRunner allows you to run any ScalaTest Suite written in any<br/>\n&gt; style (such as BDD) with JUnit<br/>\n&gt; - ScalaTest&#39;s Runner has a -j option that allows you to specify JUnit<br/>\n&gt; tests written in Java (or Groovy, etc.) and have them run alongside<br/>\n&gt; ScalaTest tests (i.e., so you get one uniform report)<br/>\n&gt; - ScalaTest&#39;s Ant task can generate the XML format produced by the<br/>\n&gt; JUnit ant task, which can then be used by JUnitReport ant task,<br/>\n&gt; Hudson, etc., to produce reports.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Let me know if anyone has any questions. I&#39;ll keep an eye on this<br/>\n&gt; list, but you might get a quicker response if you cross-post<br/>\n&gt; JUnit-related ScalaTest questions to the scalatest-users mailing list<br/>\n&gt; as well.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.google.com/group/scalatest-users\">http://groups.google.com/group/scalatest-users</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Bill<br/>\n&gt; ----<br/>\n&gt; Bill Venners<br/>\n&gt; Artima, Inc.<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.artima.com\">http://www.artima.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
