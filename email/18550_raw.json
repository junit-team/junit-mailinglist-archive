I think of Novice rules this way: Novices should follow the \nrules for these reasons:\n\n  * the rule is simple to express\n  * the rule is safe\n  * the rule teaches\n\nOnce you have learned a lot of what the rule teaches, you can progress \nto the next levels with regards to that concept.\n\nIn this case, I find my designs improved when I wrote only one assertion \nper test. Then I noticed the equivalence between one assertion and &#39;n&#39; \nassertions, as long as all the assertions came at the end of the test. \n From that, I progressed to a new rule:\n\n&quot;Only one set of arrange, act, assert sections per test&quot; (Google &quot;Bill \nWake 3 A&#39;s&quot; for more about arrange, act, assert.)\n\nI followed this rule for a while, then I wrote this article:\n\nhttp://articles.jbrains.ca/OneActPerTest.html\n\nSince then, I have progressed to this new rule:\n\n&quot;You&#39;d better have a damn good reason to have more than one &#39;act&#39; \nsection per test.&quot;\n\nThe article helped me articulate one or two &quot;damn good reason&quot;s. \nNowadays, I consider myself an Expert (on the Dreyfus scale, \nspecifically), so I don&#39;t worry about the rules. I notice that I tend to \nhave only one &#39;act&#39; section per test and that I tend to have only one \nassertion per test, and I notice that my designs tend to be better the \nmore I pay attention to those two things, but I no longer consider them \nrules I must follow.\n\nI hope that helps.\n-- \nJ.
