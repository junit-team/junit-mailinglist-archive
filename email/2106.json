Given that I expected them to contain<br/>\n&gt;the same number of elements, the most valuable information to me would be<br/>\n&gt;that they were of different lengths, not which elements were/were not<br/>\n&gt;present.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I partially don&#39;t agree.  I think that comparing vectors should tell you <br/>\nif the elements are equals.  If your testing a sort algorythm, you want <br/>\nto know if elements of the result vector are in the right position. <br/>\n This request (assertEquals do array properly) has been expressed by <br/>\nmany people and I think that it should be included in JUnit.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I&#39;m against the &quot;soft warning&quot; idea.  Don&#39;t see the added value there.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Vladimir</div>",
