That&#39;s by design (and it&#39;s a good design decision).\n\nYou can pus=\r\nh these to a special snapshot repository and then ask your users\nto add thr=\r\nee lines to their pom so that Maven will query that snapshot\nrepository. Th=\r\nat&#39;s a good middle ground solution that I&#39;ve used a few times\nwith TestNG.\n=\r\n\nAs for pushing to a Maven repository, it&#39;s quite straightforward now and y=\r\nou\ncan now do it yourself (you no longer need to file a ticket and have som=\r\neone\nfrom Maven do the push for you). You don&#39;t need to be a member of Apac=\r\nhe\neither. Once you deploy to Nexus, it takes about an hour before it becom=\r\nes\navailable on Maven central.\n\n-- \nC=E9dric\n\n\nOn Tue, Aug 17, 2010 at 11:1=\r\n1 PM, Bogdan &lt;\nbogdan.mocanu.notifications@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; I would lik=\r\ne to add something here, regarding the Maven repo push:\n&gt; - if you publish =\r\nyour versions of junit as SNAPSHOTS (such as\n&gt; 4.8.1-SNAPSHOT) (which I thi=\r\nnk you don&#39;t want), then yes, the users will get\n&gt; auto-updated and perhaps=\r\n their tests might start failing in the morning,\n&gt; after such an update.\n&gt; =\r\n- however, if you publish your versions as non-snapshot versions (such as\n&gt;=\r\n 4.8.1), then the users will NOT be auto-updated. They have to manually\n&gt; s=\r\nelect to use the new version that has just appeared in the repo, and this\n&gt;=\r\n way if their tests start failing, they will know that they can either fix\n=\r\n&gt; them to work with the new version of junit, or revert to the previous\n&gt; v=\r\nersion.\n&gt;\n&gt; I am considering of taking up on this task with pushing junit t=\r\no the public\n&gt; Maven repo, but I have to first learn what is exactly the pr=\r\nocess for this\n&gt; (perhaps signing up at Apache as contributor, or smt).\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n Bogdan\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In junit@yahoogroups.com, David Saff &lt;david@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; On Tue, Aug 17, 2010 at 6:28 PM, pniederw &lt;pniederw@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nI&#39;ve noticed that JUnit includes an (outdated) version of Hamcrest.\n&gt; Will =\r\nfuture JUnit version continue to ship with Hamcrest?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yes, having ma=\r\nde this decision, we&#39;ll stick to it until convinced it&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; doing more har=\r\nm than good.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Do you have plans to update to Hamcrest 1.2 or highe=\r\nr?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Unfortunately, the last time we looked at the typing changes in\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Hamcrest 1.2, we found that we couldn&#39;t automatically upgrade people\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; without changing compiling tests into non-compiling tests, and, if I\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nremember, in a few pathological cases, passing tests into failing\n&gt; &gt; tests=\r\n.
