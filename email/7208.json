Similarly, once B1, B2, and B3 have<br/>\npassed, a failure in A has to be in the A code, rather than<br/>\nsomewhere under A in the calling hierarchy.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen a test of A fails, the input conditions for the failure<br/>\nare given. The first breakpoint I set is usually at the <br/>\nassertion that failed, to see what the results were and to<br/>\nexamine values.<br/>\n<br/>\nOften, that information is sufficient to reveal the bug.<br/>\nSometimes, I need to examine A&#39;s state, so I rerun<br/>\nthe test and visit A to find out. I now *should* have<br/>\nenough information to see the problem -- but only because <br/>\nthe bug is necessarily limited to A, and does not lie any <br/>\nlower in the calling hierarchy.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnything beyond a cursory examination of the object&#39;s<br/>\nstate, however, is a significant indicator.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the method is too complex, or its underlying parts are <br/>\ninsufficiently tested, or both, I find myself tracing the<br/>\ncode to follow the logic -- and that symptom pretty clearly<br/>\nindicates that the code needs more refactoring and/or more<br/>\ntesting.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nErik Hanson wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:steven.hale@...\">steven.hale@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Does junit make debuggers obsolete? Are there situations where junit in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; partnership with logging isn&#39;t sufficient?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In my experience, unit testing makes logging obsolete and makes the debugger<br/>\n&gt; much more powerful.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; When I have a problem that I can&#39;t figure out by looking at the code, I just<br/>\n&gt; set a breakpoint in a test, run the test, and examine the variables. Logging<br/>\n&gt; forces you to guess ahead of time what you&#39;re going to want to see, but<br/>\n&gt; debugging lets you choose what you w ant to see at runtime.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I find that much easier than putting in logging statements, wading through<br/>\n&gt; logging output, and then removing the logging statements. It also saves me<br/>\n&gt; from reading the output from the logging statements that others on the team<br/>\n&gt; have accidentally left in.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Erik Hanson<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
