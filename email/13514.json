    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-561175000\">One thing that has worked well for my team is a particular form of<br/>\ncode review.  This helps developers learn new skills (like test<br/>\ndevelopment), and it gives everyone a chance to see that the<br/>\nrecommended coding practices are actively &#39;encouraged&#39; if not outright<br/>\n&#39;enforced&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\nBelow is my writeup for a process that a friend of mine and I<br/>\ndeveloped after noticing that code reviews for code written in a<br/>\npairing session were quite different than those written alone.  We&#39;ve<br/>\nhad a great deal of success with this approach, as measured by the<br/>\ncontinuation of this process in projects after I&#39;ve left them, its<br/>\n*voluntary* adoption by other groups I&#39;m not involved with, and<br/>\nfinally a noticeable increase in the quality and coherence in our<br/>\ncode.  By quality and coherence, I mean that when I as a team lead (or<br/>\nanother developer) discuss a practice that isn&#39;t recommended, the<br/>\nother devs on the team are able to see why, and we demonstrate what<br/>\nthe recommended approach is.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve used this practice to actually write quite a few tests,<br/>\nidentifying potential problem areas in code review, and writing simple<br/>\ntests for them.  Turning questions like, &quot;does it handle...&quot; into unit<br/>\ntests becomes habit in code review, and finally habitual in the<br/>\ndevelopment process.  And, it&#39;s quite a jackpot when you write a test<br/>\nin code review, and have it uncover a bug.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nCombining Code Review with Paired Programming:  <br/>\nAn approach by Kevin Klinemeier and Charlie Sheppard<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first rule of the Code Review:  You don&#39;t leave the code review<br/>\nwith more work to do.<br/>\nThe second rule of the Code Review:  You don&#39;t leave the code review<br/>\nwith more work to do.<br/>\nThe third rule of the Code Review:  If this is your first time, you<br/>\nhave to ... uh... listen.  We&#39;re not that hardcore.<br/>\n<br/>\nCode reviews can be stressful, frustrating, and/or a waste of time. <br/>\nThis approach attempts to avoid at lot of that by being more like a<br/>\npair programming session (with keyboard and projector) than a review<br/>\nof a bunch of printed-out code.   Take a laptop with your favorite IDE<br/>\nand the latest version of the codebase.  Sit down with a group of 3-5<br/>\ndevelopers and pick a few classes to review.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs you review a piece of code, rather than noting suggestions as tasks<br/>\nfor later (see rule #1), actually make those changes to the codebase. <br/>\nIf they&#39;re too large to be made in a single code review, pare the<br/>\nchange down to what you *can* do, and do that.  At the end, check in<br/>\nyour changes and be done with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis approach tends to be much more interesting for the participants<br/>\nbecause there&#39;s more interaction, and is more productive because you<br/>\ncan see your changes made as you suggest them.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is important to be serious about the no-extra work rule.  This<br/>\nkeeps your developers from thinking, &quot;Ugh, we have to go to an<br/>\nhour-long meeting from which I&#39;ll gain two more tasks to do this week.<br/>\n Screw that, I don&#39;t have time.&quot;  Sacrifice your changes before you<br/>\nsacrifice the no-extra work clause.  Adding extra work in the review<br/>\ncauses the review to be skipped in &#39;crunch time&#39;, and ultimately lost<br/>\nalong the wayside.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn general, when you start or amend your code review process, let your<br/>\ndevelopers know that they should expect that they *will* find changes.<br/>\n Nobody is capable of keeping all the possible considerations in mind<br/>\nwhile they&#39;re writing software.  That&#39;s why we do code reviews, and<br/>\nwhy paired programming is so powerful.  Also, even if your software is<br/>\nvery, very well written, you don&#39;t put several developers in a room<br/>\nand ask, &quot;Hey, what do you think of this piece of code?&quot; and get &quot;No<br/>\nchanges&quot; as a result.  It just doesn&#39;t happen.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe last thing, and this is obvious, but be polite.  There may very<br/>\nwell be a reason the code is the way it is, or even if there isn&#39;t (it<br/>\nreally is that bad), it&#39;s likely the author and the rest of the team<br/>\nalready knows better.  Laugh at yourselves from time to time, and<br/>\noverall stay positive.  Talk more about what can be fixed, rather than<br/>\nproblems left behind.<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 5/13/05, Danijel Arsenovski &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:darsenovski@...\">darsenovski@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Hi,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I had some difficulty in promoting TDD in my team (if you can call it<br/>\n&gt; so, too many short-term body-shopped personnel, with no TDD skills), so<br/>\n&gt; I started investigating some tools that permit generating unit tests &quot;a<br/>\n&gt; posteriori&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Would anyone like to share some experience with this type of tools,<br/>\n&gt; since they integrate better with traditional approach, contrary to<br/>\n&gt; &quot;write test first&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thank you,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Danijel Arsenovski<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
