Sometimes I only have to assert one thing against that functionality,\nbut more often I have to look at many different things to prove that things\nare hunky dory.  (But there is the notion that if you&#39;re asserting against\ntoo many different things, your design may not be optimal.)\n\nSet up context, do the steps representing the functionality being tested,\nthen ensure that it worked by asserting A, B, and C.  Breaking this up into\nthree methods would obscure the intent that executing a single bit of\nfunctionality results in a specific state.\n\n&gt; several small test methods for the method I am testing\n\nDon&#39;t view it as testing methods.  Instead consider that you are testing\nfunctionality.\n\n-Jeff L.\nObject Mentor, Inc.\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Mike Duffy\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSent: 7/26/2001 10:32 AM\nSubject: RE: [junit] Reporting more then 1 failed assertion per test\n\nRegarding the following comment:\n\n&quot;I guess this whole discussion really boils down to what constitutes\na test. I choose to organize my tests so that I generally have one\ntest per tested method, with appropriately many asserts per test. &quot;\n\nI think it is best to keep methods as concise and as focused as\npossible (see Refactoring by Fowler, et al; basically, your code will\nbe more reliable and easier to maintain).  For me, this means writing\nseveral small test methods for the method I am testing, and at most\nhaving one assert per test method and sometimes no asserts at all\n(for example, if you are testing an exception that passes control to\na catch block, there is no need to put assert(true) in the catch\nblock).\n\nI haven&#39;t really followed the recent thread regarding &quot;Why doesn&#39;t\nJUnit count asserts&quot;, but I now understand the position of some\npeople who favor counting asserts.  If you have many asserts in one\ntest method, counting asserts would give you the number of conditions\nyou have tested.  However, I think it would be best to put each\nspecific condition in a seperate test method.  I usually have between\neight and sixteen test methods for each method I am testing.\n\nI use the following naming convention for my test methods to keep\nthings organized:\n\n    test_##_nameOfMethodBeingTested\n\nFor example, the eigth test method for the method isAccountAssigned\nwould be,\n\n    test_07_isAccountAssigned\n\n",
