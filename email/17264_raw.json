I avoided taking that route before since\n&lt;junit=\r\n&gt; and &lt;junitreport&gt; were such an improvement over what I had\noriginally.  H=\r\nowever (I think) I have run up against a limitation of\nthe &lt;junit&gt; task whi=\r\nch makes me revisit this solution.  The &lt;junit&gt;\ntask isn&#39;t working for me b=\r\necause it won&#39;t allow you to control how\nmuch exception stack trace informa=\r\ntion is kept for each failure.  I\nonly want to see the first line or two (t=\r\nhe only really useful info in\nthe exception stack), but I want to limit the=\r\n amount of exceptions\nthat are reported because I appear to be running out =\r\nof memory when I\nrun a full test suite of over 80 tests.  This never happen=\r\ned before I\nstarted using Ant/&lt;junit&gt;/&lt;junitreport&gt;, and my assumption is t=\r\nhat the\nexception stacks for each failure are being kept in memory by the\n&lt;=\r\njunit&gt; task, which is expecting to write all of the info to XML once\nthe su=\r\nite completes.  Unfortunately after so many failures the\nexception stack in=\r\nfo being held in memory is so much that the program\ncrashes with an out-of-=\r\nmemory error.  Is my assumption correct?  Will\nthe TestListener approach he=\r\nlp me?\n\n\n--James\n\n\n\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;J. B. Rainsberger&quot; &lt;jbr=\r\nains@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; james_adams wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I have inherited some code w=\r\nhich runs a suite of JUnit test cases (via\n&gt; &gt; junit.textui.TestRunner.doRu=\r\nn(mySuite)) and outputs the results of the\n&gt; &gt; test case either as &quot;.&quot; for =\r\na success, or &quot;.F&quot; for a failure, followed\n&gt; &gt; by the errors and a summary =\r\nof the run results. So if I have three\n&gt; &gt; test cases in the suite, and the=\r\n first and third test cases succeed,\n&gt; &gt; then the output file looks like &quot;.=\r\n.F.&quot; followed by the errors and a\n&gt; &gt; summary of how many successes/failure=\r\ns. There are about 80 test cases\n&gt; &gt; in the suite I&#39;m working with, and it =\r\nis very time consuming and error\n&gt; &gt; prone to try to figure out which tests=\r\n succeeded and which ones failed\n&gt; &gt; from a long list of dots and dot-F&#39;s. =\r\nWhat I would like instead is to\n&gt; &gt; have the report look something like thi=\r\ns:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; test-01-01: success\n&gt; &gt; test-01-02: failure\n&gt; &gt; test-02-01: suc=\r\ncess\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;errors&gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;summary&gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I have looked at the Jav=\r\naDoc for junit.textui.TestRunner and there is\n&gt; &gt; no way to specify how the=\r\n final report comes out, more specifically no\n&gt; &gt; way to tell it to print t=\r\nhe name of the test case and the result\n&gt; &gt; rather than either &quot;.&quot; for succ=\r\ness or &quot;.F&quot; for failures.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Can anyone advise me how I can modify th=\r\nis behavior? Am I stuck and\n&gt; &gt; just need to write a parser to convert the =\r\n&quot;..F.&quot; to a meaningful\n&gt; &gt; report as to which tests succeeded or failed (as=\r\n in the above\nexample)?\n&gt; \n&gt; You&#39;re not stuck writing a parser. Instead, yo=\r\nu can write a\nTestListener \n&gt; that generates the kind of report you&#39;d like =\r\nto generate. I&#39;ve taken\nthe \n&gt; liberty of sending you (privately) a recipe =\r\nfrom _JUnit Recipes_ on the \n&gt; topic. I have found it easiest to use the JU=\r\nnit-addons test runner and \n&gt; plug in whatever test listeners I want.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nTake care.\n&gt; -- \n&gt; J. B.
