I guess I got involved in the\n&gt;discussion, I thought it was (at times) useful. Since it was my first\n&gt;posting (and heck, I was throttled by moderation) how was I to know that you\n&gt;didn&#39;t want discuss on the list.\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n...\n\n&gt;I&#39;d like to think I&#39;ve been thinking, but hmm ... let me think about that\n&gt;some more ... Yup, I&#39;m pretty sure I was. You judge so harshly yet you admit\n&gt;you deleted much of what was there. Couldn&#39;t you have just kept on deleting\n&gt;and kept this to yourself? No, I guess you want a quiet mailing list. Ok,\n&gt;you win -- I&#39;m done.\n&gt;\nThis is starting to get silly, Adam, you are very thinskinned.  I was \nalso a part of those posts.  I took no offense.  Do you look for slights \nand imagined mortal insults?  I&#39;m new here too, it&#39;s not my list.  It&#39;s \ntheir list.  If you can&#39;t take the criticism, then stop talking about \nleaving and do it.\n\nIf I understand correctly, they would like less traffic, perhaps \ninfrequent simple questions and relatively small discussions of \ninteresting tidbits.  What did occur was a rather boisterous and \nslightly heated discussion between you and JB.   I&#39;ve jumped off lists \nin the past when I kept getting 20 or thirty emails a day from them.  I \nimagine they don&#39;t want to do this.\n\nSo take it under advisement, and don&#39;t be so sensitive!\n\n&gt;-1 -- but hey, I clearly don&#39;t fit here. I thought I was discussing\n&gt;something of small potential with the development team of junit, but I\n&gt;clearly got that all wrong. I guess from that mistaken hypothesis all\n&gt;conclusion is obviously worthless, so I should&#39;ve just given up when I\n&gt;thought about giving up. I learned a lot from these threads, just little of it was about junit & most\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;of it was about this list&#39;s participants.\n&gt;\n&gt;No more noise from me...\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nCry me a river...\n\nWe&#39;ve all learned plenty about you. You had some good ideas, but please \ntoughen up.  We walked into their house.\n\n\n",
