I have also felt this need in the past. When I  <br/>\nobserved that I could solve many of the same problems by writing  <br/>\nsmaller, more focused tests, not only did I stop wanting to log  <br/>\nassertions, but my designs improved and I delivered more solid  <br/>\nfeatures sooner. I believe that if JUnit logged its assertions, then  <br/>\nthat would have robbed me of this experience.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Think of it as another granularity level of insight inside your  <br/>\n&gt; tests: if<br/>\n&gt; you want the big picture, you look at the HTML reports. If you want  <br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; fine picture, you look at the source. And if you want something in- <br/>\n&gt; between<br/>\n&gt; (&quot;are we making sure the collection is the right size?&quot;), you could  <br/>\n&gt; use this<br/>\n&gt; hypothetical assert log without the source noise.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If the collection needs to be the right size, and if getting that  <br/>\nwrong is more than microscopically likely, then I write a test for it.  <br/>\nThat&#39;s what I do and that&#39;s what I recommend others do.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care.<br/>\n----<br/>\nJ.
