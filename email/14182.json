By this I use it on several<br/>\npages without problem except on the first screen.  I can not get it to<br/>\nfind the table with the specific id.  I have even gone back through<br/>\nthe prior releases to see when my issue would have surfaced.  I found<br/>\nthat the problem is with 1.4.6 and forward.  I have run the html<br/>\nthrough several html validators and they don&#39;t have any major issues,<br/>\njust missing 4.01 attributes that are not required.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m at a loss for what to do next, any ideas on what to look for or<br/>\ncould someone provide another pair of eyes to look at the code?<br/>\n<br/>\nAny help is greatly appreciated.<br/>\nThanks Jeff</div>",
