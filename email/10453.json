It&#39;s no big deal.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If you don&#39;t think it&#39;s a big deal, then I can&#39;t convince you otherwise.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  &gt; The whole point (!!) of the protected and private keyword is to shield<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; client code from the inner-workings and details of design.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Indeed.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  &gt; Tests are client code.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; No, they are tests. Sometimes they might act like client code.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s a philosophy difference, and I wouldn&#39;t dare try to change your mind.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  &gt; Why should tests get special access to these inner workings?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So that they can test these inner workings?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Again, philosophy: if those inner working are complex enough to need to <br/>\nbe tested on their own, then they are not &quot;inner workings&quot;. Instead, <br/>\nthey are features that can likely be used in other contexts. In that <br/>\ncase, make &#39;em public parts of some collaborating class. The result is <br/>\nusually a less-highly-coupled and more cohesive design.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
