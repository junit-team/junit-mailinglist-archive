Ideally we should have written the test case _before_ creating\nthe code.  Unfortunately, we didnt and now are trying to backfill.  We\nhave several hundred classes that I have to write test cases for.\n\n  I was just hoping for something that would at least give me a start\n(boundary conditions: null, empty string, MIN_VALUE, MAX_VALUE...). \nThen, I would go back through and fix/add in the other tests.  But at\nleast I would have a first swag at it.\n\nThanks again for all your help\n\nJim\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Michael Silverstein&quot;\n&lt;msilverstein@s...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Chris Dollin wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; If not, how do you explain to the tool what the test cases are? \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Inferring them from already-written code is hard (and runs \n&gt; &gt; the risk of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; capturing subtle incorrect behaviour).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; One thing we&#39;ve done is implement an object interaction recorder that\n&gt; captures interactions (method and constructor invocations) between an\n&gt; arbitrary object under test and objects that call it (actors). We can\n&gt; then generate unit tests that roughly mimic those interactions as a\n&gt; starting point for additional variations. \n&gt; \n&gt; The process is:\n&gt; 1) Start recorder to capture interactions with a specific object\n&gt; 2) Execute one high-level user story, typically from the GUI\n&gt; 3) Stop recorder\n&gt; 4) Generate unit test from recording that mimics interactions between an\n&gt; actor and the object under test\n&gt; \n&gt; This is a good technique if you&#39;ve already got a (somewhat) working\n&gt; application and would like to rapidly add unit tests for a particular\n&gt; class before making changes or additions to it. \n&gt; \n&gt; Anyway, you can read more about this technique at\n&gt; http://www.silvermark.com/Product/enhancedjunit/.\n&gt; \n&gt; I also have an article coming out November in &quot;Software Testing and\n&gt; Quality Engineering&quot; magazine  (www.stqe.com) that describes a technique\n&gt; for using calls to a recording framework within an application to\n&gt; automatically generate semantically meaningful tests, at arbitrary\n&gt; levels of granularity. I can provide more information if anyone has any\n&gt; interest in this sort of thing.\n&gt; \n&gt; -----------------------------\n&gt; Mike Silverstein\n&gt; SilverMark, Inc.\n&gt; The Object Testing Company\n&gt; www.javatesting.com\n&gt; **********************************\n&gt; * Makers of &quot;Test Mentor&quot;        *\n&gt; * and &quot;Enhanced JUnit&quot; Java      *\n&gt; * component testing tools        *\n&gt; **********************************\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; Outgoing mail is certified Virus Free.\n&gt; Checked by AVG anti-virus system (http://www.grisoft.com).\n&gt; Version: 6.0.518 / Virus Database: 316 - Release Date: 9/11/2003\n\n\n",
