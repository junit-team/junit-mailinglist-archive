    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-890666109\">Dear All,<br/>\n<br/>\nA while ago I started looking at using one of the frameworks available for<br/>\ntesting UI code (of a traditional desktop app) and starting using one<br/>\n(abbot).  Primarily I used it to help test drive the implementation of<br/>\nvarious listeners required within a couple of dialogs I was writing.  Whilst<br/>\nslowing down the unit test process (because it renders a UI and &quot;robots&quot; the<br/>\nuser control) it&#39;s worked pretty well for me.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNow I come to the validation process and I have received a number of bugs to<br/>\nfix (no big deal) but my question is how much should I drive my bug fixing?<br/>\nNormally (prior to abbot) I&#39;d dig about my code to locate the appropriate<br/>\ncode, create a test case (or cases) to highlight the bug and drive the fix<br/>\nappropriately.  Now I have a UI fault that is easy to reproduce - and I&#39;ve<br/>\ncreated a test case using abbot to highlight the fault, and can now dig<br/>\nthrough the code and fix it... but... this fault (as with a couple of other<br/>\nUI faults) resolves down to a failing implementation of some<br/>\nDocumentListener logic.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo should I (would you) keep TDD the fix via the high level UI test case, or<br/>\ndrill down and write &quot;lower&quot; level test cases for the DocumentListener<br/>\nimplementation.  The former helps solve the current bug, the later also<br/>\nfixes the bug but has better coverage of the listener (which could be/is<br/>\nreused)?  Or should I duplicate the test to test both the UI working<br/>\ncorrectly and the listener being implemented correctly?  I don&#39;t like the<br/>\nidea of duplication, and I prefer using non UI tool testing (because of the<br/>\nquicker round trip effect), but it seems that I probably do need both tests,<br/>\nor am I missing something?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAny thoughts/criticisms/insights appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\nJonathan<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJonathan Oddy<br/>\nSERVICEPower Business Solutions Ltd<br/>\nPetersgate House - St Petersgate - Stockport - SK1 1HE - ENGLAND<br/>\nTel: +44 (0)161 476 2277<br/>\nEmail: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:j.oddy@...\">j.oddy@...</a> &lt;mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:j.oddy@...\">j.oddy@...</a>&gt;</div>",
