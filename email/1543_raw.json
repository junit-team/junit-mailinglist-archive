But because the\n &gt; doGet(HttpServletRequest, HttpServletResponse) and\n &gt; doPost(HttpServletRequest, HttpServletResponse) methods have no returns,\n &gt; and HttpServletRequest and HttpServletResponse are generated by the\n &gt; system, I could not create JUnit tests for them.  Does anyone have some\n &gt; experience?  Thanks a lot for the help.\n\nYou can use HTTPUnit to run tests against the servlet.  The\nproblem, however, as you point out, is that you only have\nlimited visibility into the servlet, since you can only check\nthe returned HTTP response to the web client.  It&#39;s gets even\nmore fun when you&#39;re trying to test the behavior of session\ntime outs, security and log in checks, etc.\n\nWhat we&#39;ve discussed doing is to make our servlets (and JSPs\nvia tag libraries) very thin layers that take the incoming\nrequests and just delegate to our presentation helper classes.\nIn many cases, we&#39;ll end up just passing the request and\nsession objects along, but we now have a point where we can\ncreate the request or session objects in particular states\n(like expired session), so we can much more easily test the\ninterface&#39;s behavior, plus we can use JUnit.\n\nThis isn&#39;t a silver bullet or anything, because there are\nstill cases where you want to test the actual returned HTML,\nand sometimes HTTPUnit tests are the best way to do that.\nBut it seems like it will make our life a bit easier for some\nother classes of presentation layer testing.\n\nAnyone else try this?\n\n-Paul Hodgetts\n\n\n",
