It cotain=\r\ns a larger chapter about mocking and working \ndistributed systems.\n\nRegardi=\r\nng your SQL queries it might be a trade-off to use a slim in memory-databas=\r\ne to \nvalidate whether your SQL queries are correct. However you might not =\r\nbe able to simulate \nyour production-database since it might interpret your=\r\n SQL slightly different..  \n\nBest Regards,\nRobin\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.=\r\ncom, &quot;serethos_0&quot; &lt;Serethos@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello!\n&gt; \n&gt; I am an quite exper=\r\nienced programmer but new to the philosophy of unit\n&gt; testing. An issue I w=\r\nant to change.\n&gt; I read some articles and took some orientation on Frank We=\r\nstphal&#39;s\n&gt; very good book about that topic. But in practice, I always run i=\r\nnto\n&gt; similar problems, which seem to disturb my view of unit testing. So\n&gt;=\r\n some thought and questions I would like to discuss.\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. Recently I rea=\r\nd that a unit test is no one if you have to touch\n&gt; network, db or filesyst=\r\nem. I understand the point that these accesses\n&gt; really can slow the tests =\r\ndown and usually need extra work of\n&gt; configuration, but how to avoid this?=\r\n\n&gt; An example of my daily work. I have quite a common task: Fetch some\n&gt; xm=\r\nls from an ftp server, parse the content and map it into db and vice\n&gt; vers=\r\na. So the business logic is quite thin. More important is good\n&gt; exception =\r\nhandling and the transport of all data in the right structures. \n&gt; \n&gt; Actua=\r\nlly the slowdown of a real ftp transport and the configuration\n&gt; and inject=\r\nion overhead of the db-connection is a major drawback. But\n&gt; on the other h=\r\nand I see no good way to mock the behaviour of these\n&gt; endpoints. \n&gt; I coul=\r\nd try to mock a database, but how to test, if an sql-statement\n&gt; is correct=\r\n (especially for a wider range of queries)?\n&gt; It also is a very hard work t=\r\no write stubs or mocks, which can answer\n&gt; with all error-states an ftp-ser=\r\nver/network can generate (timeout,\n&gt; access denied, authentication etc) to =\r\ntest the correct error handling\n&gt; of my code.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2. Another question poin=\r\nts to a basic principle of unit testing: the\n&gt; opening of a class in small =\r\nand public methods. I see an advantage in\n&gt; the possibility to inject every=\r\n aspect of a class (manually or e.g.\n&gt; via spring) and the code can benefit=\r\n from a better readability through\n&gt; a chain of self-explanatory method cal=\r\nls.\n&gt; But in some cases I want to hide implementation details from the user=\r\n.\n&gt; Taking my Importer/Exporter example a second time, it is more a cron\n&gt; =\r\nscript than an application: Doing a defined job in a robust and\n&gt; understan=\r\ndable manner but neither designed as a basis for wide\n&gt; enhancements nor fo=\r\nr ultimate flexibility. \n&gt; So there are methods which start the whole work =\r\nof an importer over\n&gt; the whole lifecycle (connect, fetch data, map data et=\r\nc). Methods,\n&gt; which are necessary for getting the object in a usable state=\r\n (e.g.\n&gt; connection established) are hidden away. To ensure that there must=\r\n be\n&gt; the correct state before executing the main task I can lead the user\n=\r\n&gt; with parameterized constructors (e.g. MyImporter(host, port)).\n&gt; To say i=\r\nt more generally I think that it is a common way to restrict\n&gt; the use of c=\r\nlasses which need to be handled in correct order because\n&gt; of their state. =\r\nThis saves a lot of additional exception handling\n&gt; (e.g. executing before =\r\nconnecting). \n&gt; But following this thought it gets very hard to isolate tes=\r\nting units.\n&gt; Even when I separate the tasks within the class to units (con=\r\nnecting,\n&gt; disconnecting etc) they would be not accessible and would need t=\r\no be\n&gt; tested from within.\n&gt; \n&gt; This is only a very simple and not a perfec=\r\nt example but I think my\n&gt; point should be clear. I hope that some of you t=\r\nake some time to read\n&gt; it. I really would appreciate some thoughts!\n&gt;\n\n\n",
