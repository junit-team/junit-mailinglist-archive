By looking at their test code and\ncomp=\r\naring it to your code (which maybe isn&#39;t working), you can get an\nidea\nwher=\r\ne you or the vendor are making unwarranted assumptions.\n\nOn Mon, 12 Nov 200=\r\n1, David Stagner wrote:\n\n&gt; &quot;Rogers, Jason&quot; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;David Stagner&quot; w=\r\nrote:\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; Unit tests document API usage very well, for starters.  And t=\r\nhey\n&gt; &gt; suggest\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; where any bugs encountered might be, even by their =\r\nabsence (a\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; problematic condition may not be tested, and a set of te=\r\nsts\ncould\n&gt; &gt; rule\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; out a bunch of possible causes for a bug).\n&gt; &gt;  =\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; This seems like a pretty weak argument to me.  They only documen=\r\nt\nthe\n&gt; &gt; set of\n&gt; &gt; the API that the authors chose to test, and they only =\r\ntest to the\n&gt; &gt; authors&#39;\n&gt; &gt; degrees of comfortability.  Truth be known, ju=\r\nst because JUnit is in\nuse\n&gt; &gt; does\n&gt; &gt; not mean that the code is being tes=\r\nted thoroughly.  Right?  You may\nbe\n&gt; &gt; right\n&gt; &gt; that it could show you wh=\r\nat isn&#39;t tested, but not necessarily why.\nAnd\n&gt; &gt; it only\n&gt; &gt; gives you a c=\r\nlue as to what is not tested and what is.  There may\nnot be\n&gt; &gt; a one\n&gt; &gt; t=\r\no one mapping of the public API to the tests.\n&gt;\n&gt; Granted.  I was assuming =\r\nthat the set of unit tests theoretically\n&gt; provided by our imaginary vendor=\r\n (has anyone ever seen a non-open\nsource\n&gt; vendor do this?) would be reason=\r\nably thorough, complete, and\n&gt; representative.  If the unit tests don&#39;t exe=\r\nrcise all the documented\n&gt; methods and boundaries of the API, they&#39;re incom=\r\nplete anyway.  The\nhard\n&gt; part comes with testing coupling, interaction, an=\r\nd state changes\nbetween\n&gt; components, where the non-trivial bugs often lurk=\r\n.\n&gt;\n&gt; On a more philosophical level, i&#39;d suggest that most unit testing is\n=\r\n&gt; either very useful, or mostly useless, depending on the confidence of\n&gt; t=\r\nhe programmer in the testing process.  Cowardly testing is a sign of\na\n&gt; la=\r\nck of confidence in the code.  Once a programmer gets in the habit\nof\n&gt; ser=\r\nious unit testing, the programmer will almost always be more\n&gt; confident in=\r\n the code - and thus more likely to test thoroughly.  Good\n&gt; unit testing i=\r\ns a self-reinforcing feedback loop.  And if i were given\na\n&gt; set of unit te=\r\nsts from a vendor that clearly did not thoroughly test\nthe\n&gt; public interfa=\r\nce of the software, i would immediately distrust the\n&gt; software in question=\r\n.\n&gt;\n\n-- \nEric Vought\nChief Technical Officer - QLUE Consulting, Inc.\n\nevoug=\r\nht@... toll-free: 888-771-3538  RTP area: 919-816-9901\n\n\nYahoo!
