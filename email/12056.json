I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; in the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; unfortunate situation of having to write tests for an existing<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; application(I haven&#39;t been involved in the development). ´<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Unfortunate? This is the standard situation in most processes: Test<br/>\n&gt; are<br/>\n&gt; &gt; written after development or in parallel to it. What&#39;s so<br/>\n&gt; unfortunate about<br/>\n&gt; &gt; writing tests?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; As Chris Dollin stated, &quot;unfortunate&quot; refers to writing the test<br/>\n&gt; post-hoc. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Even this is IMO not at all unfortunate. Why should it be? Test-first is<br/>\ngood - but I doubt that this means that you *never* write tests later to<br/>\ncover additional cases. Of course, with test-first you usually have a<br/>\nset of test to start from, which you can copy-paste (or even put into a<br/>\nfine test-case architecture) to extend. But writing from scratch<br/>\nafterwards should be as much fun as test-first - IF (big if) the<br/>\nsoftware is designed for testability. <br/>\nStill, if there are enough public methods around, it should be possible<br/>\nto test &quot;just these&quot; - and either this finds enough bugs for keeping<br/>\ndevelopment busy for some time; or if not, you can talk to the guys<br/>\nthere (who will sit around and fiddle with their thumbs) to refactor to<br/>\nmore testability ...<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; Technically, I do not see why you shouldn&#39;t be able to write unit<br/>\n&gt; tests for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; selected classes with JUnit - if the design is suitable.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Is there infomation somewhere in the net about whether or not a design<br/>\n&gt; is suitable for being tested with JUnit?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I write testcases routinely (well, a few per week :-) ) for a project<br/>\nwhich does only in-system testing. They have so many public methods that<br/>\nJUnit is easy to apply to it (of course, this is NOT AT ALL object<br/>\ntesting ... but I really dont care as long as enough of the system gets<br/>\ntested; and enough bugs are found: A successful test is a test which<br/>\nfinds bugs).<br/>\nSlowly, I also try to write object tests - but this is really low-prio<br/>\nright now (I might show you all a piece of the software and its unit<br/>\ntests in a few weeks and ask for your comments on my way of making it<br/>\nobject-testable - using &quot;Junit Recipes&quot; advice).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It is about functional correctness. I did load tests using &quot;The<br/>\n&gt; Grinder 3&quot; (can be found at sourceforge), which is free. There are a<br/>\n&gt; lot of open source load testing tools, so they are not necessarily<br/>\n&gt; expensive. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Good to know - I&#39;ll tell that the people in our company who told me that<br/>\nthey couldn&#39;t afford load test tools ....<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; * to which level of granularity, e.g.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   - methods of single classes; or of facade classes hiding a<br/>\n&gt; complete<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;system&quot;;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   - single web page clicks, or whole work-flows;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; That is to be determined and I know only we can do that. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; * to which level of quality, e.g.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   - only critical functions (e.g. defined by &quot;draw most bug reports<br/>\n&gt; in the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; last 3 monts&quot;);<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   - everything to some coverage level; then you need to decide on <br/>\n&gt; &gt;   -- the coverage level (&quot;80%&quot; is in &quot;industry standard&quot;; &quot;100%<br/>\n&gt; feasible<br/>\n&gt; &gt; coverage&quot; is the only sensible standard)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I assume the level of quality depends on the level of granularity. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not sure - for me, the two are orthogonal. The latter is more driven<br/>\nby the resources (people and time) you have - you have to stop when<br/>\nmoney&#39;s out ...<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;   -- the type of coverage (code coverage; or some &quot;feature coverage&quot;<br/>\n&gt; - all<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the features down written in some specification or documentation)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Code coverage is not an issue here but &quot;feature coverage&quot; is. Is<br/>\n&gt; &quot;feature coverage&quot; a common term? <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I fear not, after looking on the internet. I&#39;ll check in my few testing<br/>\nbooks what they call it.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards<br/>\nHarald M. Mueller</div>",
