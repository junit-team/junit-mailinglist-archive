I truly believe that the time I spend working on unit tests of my commercial application saves me time on the other end.  I can spend an extra couple of hours writing some tests during my development, in order to save my team quite a bit of effort down the road,...take this scenario,...<br/>\n<br/>\nI spend a couple incremental hours writing tests while I develop my code;<br/>\nWe run a nightly build;<br/>\nOne morning I see that a test has failed;<br/>\nI spend an hour to fix it;<br/>\nIt makes it to QC and our customer without further incident.<br/>\n<br/>\nOR<br/>\n<br/>\nI save a couple hours during development and don&#39;t write tests for my code;<br/>\nThe code gets built and released to our QC department;<br/>\nThey spend a week testing the code, and then find the bug;<br/>\nI spend an hour to fix it;<br/>\nThe code gets built and released to our QC department;<br/>\nThey start over, with the schedule slipped a week.<br/>\n<br/>\nOR<br/>\n<br/>\nSame scenario, except that QC doesn&#39;t catch it - the customer does;<br/>\nwe lose face with the customer;<br/>\nwe repeat the full cycle to release, with the schedule slipped by however long it took to get to the client.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is something that you have to sell to product management,...if you can schedule time for writing tests (and writing before/during development is less time than after the code is written), and schedule time to fix bugs correctly (and write/fix tests to make sure it doesn&#39;t get through again), then you can make your commitments to your clients while providing a quality product that your staff can be proud of.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nmy two cents,<br/>\nDianne<br/>\n<br/>\n-------------- Original message -------------- <br/>\nFrom: &quot;frank zou&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:frankz1998@...\">frankz1998@...</a>&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\nHi all,<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter lots of reading and trying, I think I understand the following<br/>\nbenefits that Junit-base testing can give us:<br/>\n<br/>\n* more robust system<br/>\n* clean / good design <br/>\n* less regression bugs <br/>\n* confidence to do refactorying, especially at the later phase of the<br/>\nproject. <br/>\n* and lots more...<br/>\n<br/>\nThese are really good things, for open-source projects where there is<br/>\nno deadline pressure and resource could almost be thought as<br/>\nun-limitted. However, for commercial software development, is this<br/>\nstill possible ?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough I knew JUnit and other JUnit-based open-source tools for a<br/>\ncouple of years, my company and team never really enbrace it. The<br/>\nmajor reason is Product Managers always want to add cool features to<br/>\nthe system quickly while programmers find the schedule is always too<br/>\ntight to spend any extra time to write testing. <br/>\n<br/>\nI know from the mail list and books that we can take lots of advantage<br/>\nof JUnit-based testing, I myself have no real hands-on experience on<br/>\nit. So here are my questions: <br/>\n<br/>\n* Will Junit-based testing make the project time longer or shorter ?<br/>\nAny hard statistic data ? ( Here I mean commercial project rather than<br/>\nopen-source project. )<br/>\n<br/>\n* One intersting point I found is that after Junit-based testing is<br/>\nintroduced, programmers tend to use IDE debugger much less than<br/>\nbefore.  This would save lots of time. Is that true ?<br/>\n<br/>\n* Some guys say JUnit is good for biz / util code testing. But for web<br/>\napplication development, where HTML/javascript would be root cause of<br/>\nlots of bugs, Junit is not so powerful. Any comments ? <br/>\n<br/>\n* How can I convince managers and programmers that JUnit-based is<br/>\nreally possible for commercial software development ? Any differnece<br/>\nfrom open-source projects ?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCan some Junit gurus shed some light here ?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks, <br/>\n- Frank<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSPONSORED LINKS Basic programming language C programming language Computer programming languages <br/>\nThe c programming language C programming language List of programming languages <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYAHOO!
