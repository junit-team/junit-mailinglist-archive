We get this\ncode as part of web application and hence I couldnt\nchange this.\n\nI am new to XPath expressions. It would be great if I\ncould any sample code that suits my scenario.\n\nThanks in advance,\nSaldin\n\n--- Robert &lt;yahoo@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; --- In junit@yahoogroups.com, saldin samuel\n&gt; &lt;saldin_s@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; It would be great if anyone can tell me how to\n&gt; capture\n&gt; &gt; the image as HtmlImage for the above script which\n&gt; does\n&gt; &gt; not have Id or Name attribute.\n&gt; \n&gt; An XPath expression would probably do it.
