I <br/>\nlooped through one collection and then determined if each item in it <br/>\nwas in the other collection using the &quot;contains&quot; method. Sounds like <br/>\nJUnit could use another overloaded version of assertEquals.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In junit@y..., &quot;J. B. Rainsberger&quot; &lt;jbr@d...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Just do assertEquals on expected and actual collections. The<br/>\n&gt; &gt; collections all have sensible equals methods<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; i.e. if the 2 collections are lists they will be equal if they<br/>\n&gt; &gt; contain the same elements in the same order. If the 2 collections<br/>\n&gt; &gt; are sets they will be equal if they contain the same elements.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The only problem with this otherwise great advice is that comparing <br/>\ntwo lists <br/>\n&gt; for the same elements, although not at the same indices, does not <br/>\nwork.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This has been discussed, I think, to death somewhere on the web. <br/>\nMaybe you <br/>\n&gt; should look at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?JavaUnitBestPractices\">http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?JavaUnitBestPractices</a> and <br/>\nhunt around <br/>\n&gt; for something on comparing arrays or some such. There should be <br/>\nquite a <br/>\n&gt; complete discussion.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The basic idea is this: write your own custom assertion <br/>\n&gt; or &quot;collectionsEquals&quot;, but be careful how to handle the <br/>\ndifferences. <br/>\n&gt; Especially for big collections, you need an easy way to know what <br/>\nthe <br/>\n&gt; differences are between the collections in the case where they are <br/>\nnot equal.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If that resource does not help you, then let us know and we&#39;ll fill <br/>\nin the <br/>\n&gt; blanks. This sounds like another &quot;Tip and Trick&quot; for my site. :)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; J. B.
