That way I am\n&gt; aggressive and make changes without fear of unknowingly breaking some\n&gt; part of the system.\n\nYes, that is the point of my tests, too.\n\n&gt; If I don&#39;t change the DBMS nor the operating environment, then the SQL\n&gt; statements, once correct, cannot break. They become a &quot;golden master&quot;\n&gt; against which I can continue to compare as needed.\n\nWell, true...but how you get away with not changing the SQL for long\nperiods is beyond me. I&#39;ve never done serious develoment on a system\nwith a lot of database code where the database wasn&#39;t changing all the\ntime. But we probably just tend to work on different styles of projects.\n\n&gt; Better would be to have some in-memory SQL syntax/semantics checker\n&gt; that worked against my database schema, simulated the statements and\n&gt; ensured that they continue to make sense.\n\nNo, this to my mind would be a complete waste of time. If you haven&#39;t\nchanged the statements, you don&#39;t need to syntax check them, even, as\nyou pointed out. Just return the data the statement is supposed to return\nand leave it at that.\n\nIf you do change the statements, and you&#39;re not checking them against\nthe database, you&#39;re going to need an *extremely* thorough and accurate\nsimulation of the database software. Given the huge complexity of quirks\nof most RDBMSs, that would be extraordinally expensive and difficult.\nWhy not just use the most accurate simulation, the database itself?\n\n&gt; But like I said, if I move all the SQL statements into one place, I can\n&gt; easily write a simple test to verify those statements against the\n&gt; database. I can run that test less frequently, thus avoiding the\n&gt; overhead of running them all the time.\n\nThere is no need to have all your statements separated from the code that\nuses them in order to test separately. I&#39;m sure you can come up with many\nother ways to turn on and off individual tests.\n\ncjs\n-- \nCurt Sampson  &lt;cjs@...&gt;   +81 90 7737 2974   http://www.netbsd.org\n    Don&#39;t you know, in this new Dark Age, we&#39;re all light.  --XTC\n\n\n",
