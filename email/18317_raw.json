I\nthink you may be more successful with that.\n\nIn general I thik that jUnit is designed with a certain process in\nmind while TestNG is more flexible in that sense. It may very well\nhappen that you find that testNG suits your needs better.\n\nNow that I tried to answer your question I am curious, wouldn&#39;t having\nyour test methods sprinkled all over your code constrain you\nunneccesarily? I&#39;m thinking that you would probably need to provide\ndefault constructors in those classes that contian tests in order to\nbe able to run them for instance.\n\nWouldn&#39;t it  become confusing for someone looking at the code later.\nWouldn&#39;t it be harder to see what has to do with testing and what has\nto do with passing the tests?\n\nDon&#39;t get me wrong, try it by all means, I just saw those potential drawbacks.\nTake care!\n/Joakim Ohlrogge\n\n\nOn 11/8/06, Joseph Shraibman &lt;jks@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; From the faq the pattern everyone else seems to be using is that their\n&gt;  tests are in a seperate java file from their code.  I&#39;d like to\n&gt;  spinkle test methods throughout my code, so the test can be right next\n&gt;  to the code it is testing.  I&#39;d like to create a junit ant task that\n&gt;  just runs on my whole codebase, but not all of my classes will have\n&gt;  test methods and I&#39;ll get an error for each class that doesn&#39;t (and I\n&gt;  don&#39;t want to have to explictily add each class to my build.xml file\n&gt;  when I add a test).  So how do I tell junit that it isn&#39;t an error if\n&gt;  a class does not have a test method?\n&gt;\n&gt;                    \n\n",
