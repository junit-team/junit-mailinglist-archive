So is FEST-Assert. If my tests are small and focused enough, =\r\nI might even roll with native Java assertions. The AssertionError (or, real=\r\nly, any exception that propagates out of a test) represents sort of an impl=\r\nicit contract between test and runner: signal the test as failed if the exc=\r\neption makes it out of the test unhandled. There are lots of ways to satisf=\r\ny that contract; I&#39;m not sure that one based on Hamcrest has to be the answ=\r\ner.\n\nThe time period between JUnit 4.4 and 4.11 was challenging for those d=\r\nevelopers who wanted some of the goodness of Hamcrest &gt; 1.1, what with the =\r\nattendant Maven exclusions, surprising failures, and so forth. It led me to=\r\n wonder whether Assert/Assume ought to be separate from the core of JUnit. =\r\nThen, the putative &quot;junit-assertions&quot; module could depend on Hamcrest if it=\r\n so chose, and &quot;junit-core&quot; (made-up module that doesn&#39;t exist right now) w=\r\nouldn&#39;t have to. Further, developers could choose to use junit-assertions o=\r\nr not; Hamcrest alone (with MatcherAssert.assertThat()) or not; FEST-Assert=\r\n, etc. \n\nI think of AssumptionViolatedException as another implicit contrac=\r\nt between test and runner. Right now, though, unless you want to depend on =\r\na public-but-not-published AssumptionViolatedException class that you need =\r\nHamcrest to use, org.junit.Assume is the only way to satisfy that contract.=\r\n Better would be to have AssumptionViolatedException be part of &quot;junit-core=\r\n&quot;, not depending on Hamcrest, and letting Assume live in &quot;junit-assertions&quot;=\r\n and handle the Hamcrest matching.\n\nI&#39;ll send more under separate cover, ma=\r\nybe as a GitHub issue, as this doesn&#39;t pertain so much to JUnit 4.11 beta 1=\r\n as it does a consideration for the next major version of JUnit. I think it=\r\n&#39;d be interesting to explore segmenting JUnit into a multi-module project w=\r\nith dependencies teased out a bit.\n\nThanks again for your excellent work an=\r\nd stewardship!\n\n--p\n\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, Marc Philipp &lt;mphilipp8=\r\n2@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; From my very personal point-of-view I cannot imagine usin=\r\ng JUnit without\n&gt; Hamcrest anymore.\n&gt; \n&gt; @Paul: What would be the benefit o=\r\nf &quot;breaking the dependency&quot; entirely?\n&gt; \n&gt; @Mirko: Why shouldn&#39;t you be abl=\r\ne to use a different version of Hamcrest?\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards, Marc\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-t=\r\next portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n\n\n\n",
