In my JDBC and HTTP tests, this has made a\n&gt; few tests kind of brittle when the order or number of calls to an\n&gt; accessor method has changed.   The code still works, it also still\n&gt; conforms to the expectations of the interface, it just does things a\n&gt; little differently.\n\nIf that&#39;s so, then set up your dynamic mocks so that order for those \nmethods doesn&#39;t matter. As far as I know, jMock supports this.\n\nAlso, if you&#39;re using a dynamic mock &quot;only&quot; as a fake -- that is, to \nprovide hardcoded data -- then simply don&#39;t verify().\n-- \nJ. B.
