You have a much larger definition of &quot;small bit of functionality&quot; \n&gt; than\n&gt; I do ;-).  That sounds like a big chunk of an application to me.\n\nAs I said, it was a contrived example... probably not the best.  For \nwhat it&#39;s worth, our application doesn&#39;t model things that way.  I was \nusing our business logic in a contrived situation to attempt to make a \npoint.  However, it only derailed into a critique of the code and such \n-- I&#39;ll know better next time.  The point was that asserts may exist \nwithin a context that are related only by the context itself.  They do \nnot affect each other.  For instance, applying a CreditMemo in this case \nwill change the amount of a Sale and possibly its CloseDate and Stage.  \nWhether or not the resulting CloseDate was correct has no affect on \nwhether or not the resulting amounts of the Sale are correct.  \nNevertheless, when applying the CreditMemo to a Sale it makes sense to \nassert for all of these things.\n\n-- \nJason Rogers\n\n&quot;I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I,\nbut Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in \nthe flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved \nme, and gave himself for me.&quot;\n    Galatians 2:20\n\n\n",
