When I&#39;ve found something difficult to write test first\n&gt;  I&#39;ve always d=\r\none a spike, then delete the code and rewrote it test\n&gt;  first. I&#39;ve always=\r\n found the result to be a lot more cleaner,\n&gt;  especially since I wind up c=\r\nleaning up the code anyway when I used to\n&gt;  write tests around them.\n&gt;\n&gt;  =\r\nI&#39;d rather have my business code tested rather than not test it under\n&gt;  th=\r\ne assumption it will one day be thrown away. ;)\n\nWell, I never suggested no=\r\nt writing tests, I was just saying that\nsometimes, it&#39;s okay to write your =\r\ntests once you&#39;re done with the\nbusiness code.\n\nHere is a scenario I&#39;ve see=\r\nn happen fairly often:\n\nWrite test1\nWrite code1\nWrite test2\nWrite code2\n\nTh=\r\nen a refactoring comes to mind and you realize you don&#39;t need code1\nand cod=\r\ne2 any more, so you write code3, and suddenly, you find\nyourself having to =\r\nrefactor (or throw away) both test1 and test2.\n\nI was simply suggesting tha=\r\nt sometimes, the following flow works better:\n\nWrite code1\nWrite code2\n&lt;rea=\r\nlize a refactoring is possible&gt;\nRefactor code1/code2 into code3\n&lt;happy with=\r\n the result, now we write the test&gt;\nWrite test3\n\nNet result:  two less test=\r\ns to write.\n\n-- \nC=E9dric\nAuthor &quot;Next Generation Testing in Java&quot; (http://=\r\ntinyurl.com/yvyxa3)\n\n",
