B. Rainsberger wrote:\n&gt;&gt;I&#39;m writing a test whose purpose is to make sure that a Hashtable contains\n&gt; a\n&gt;&gt;certain set of keys. Basically, the test will make sure that someone\n&gt; filling\n&gt;&gt;out a form on the web provides all the mandatory info\n&gt; \n&gt; Hashtable? Tsk, tsk... why aren&#39;t you using Map instead? :)\n&gt; \n\nUhm... What&#39;s the diff?\n\n&gt;&gt;I&#39;d like a way to make\n&gt;&gt;the test fail for every parameter that is missing and consider each of the\n&gt;&gt;iterations as one test.\n&gt; \n&gt; Silly question: why? Does it matter whether one, two or ten parameters are\n&gt; not handled correctly? I think it matters more whether they are all\n&gt; handled correctly, or not.\n&gt; \n\nIt does but the fact that one parameter fails may have nothing to do with\nthe fact that another fails since validation may be occuring in different\nparts of the code. By failing once per invalid parameter, you are\nimmediately pointed to the proper place to debug. And if the test lists all\nthe parameters that failed, a developer could possibly see a pattern, which\nalso helps in debugging.\n\n&gt; Also, who cares how many tests there are? Do you? Your manager? I don&#39;t\n&gt; want to get into the discussion again about counting tests, but I have\n&gt; never really cared how many tests I have, as long as I&#39;m happy with the\n&gt; quality of the tests.\n&gt; \n\nNo, counting tests wasn&#39;t the motive behind my question.\n\n&gt; Since JUnit counts test methods by default, you&#39;d need one method per\n&gt; parameter. Do you really think that&#39;s a useful thing to do? I don&#39;t.\n&gt; \n\nNo, that&#39;s why I asked if there was a better method than what I&#39;m doing now:\nI have a StringBuffer to which I add all the parameters that failed and then\nuse the StringBuffer in fail().\n\nL\n\n-- \nLaurent Duperval &lt;mailto:lduperval@...&gt;\n\nWhy do we drive on parkways and park on driveways?\n\n\n\n",
