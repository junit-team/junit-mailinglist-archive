However, the\n&gt; outcome surprise me. Assertion success but obj1.equals(=\r\nobj2)\n&gt; return false.\n&gt; \n&gt; What&#39;s going on inside assertEquals() operation?=\r\n Is this what\n&gt; it&#39;s suppose to be?\n\nAs I stated, albeit not very clearly t=\r\nhe first time (Curse you &quot;Rich\nText Editor(Beta)&quot;!), I suspect that the cul=\r\nprit here is that\n&quot;Assert.assertEquals(Object, Object)&quot; is not being called=\r\n at all. This\nis borne out by the fact that a J2SE 1.4 compiler and a JavaS=\r\nE 1.5\ncompiler treat the same call completely differently.\n\nI *SUSPECT* tha=\r\nt the 1.5 compiler is unboxing the Double objects into\nprimitive longs and =\r\nthat the method that is *ACTUALLY* called is\n&quot;Assert.assertEquals(long,long=\r\n)&quot;. This accounts for the behavior since\nthe integer parts of your two numb=\r\ners are the same.\n&quot;Assert.assertEquals(long,long)&quot; yields is successful aft=\r\ner the\nDoubles are converted (truncated) to longs.\n\n-- Roger Glover\n   Obje=\r\nct Partners, Inc.\n\n\n",
