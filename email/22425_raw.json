While I had the equals and reciprocal equals working\nproperly, I was surprised at the unintended hashCode collisions I had in\nmy code.  More importantly I was surprised at how often the @DataPoints\nmethod was called to set up the tests.  It was called no less than 61\ntimes for 60 discrete data points.  That seems a bit excessive to me.\n\nI set up a bunch of data with the assumption that it was set up once,\nand then the contents were copied as needed.  Essentially the expensive\nset up work is done 61 times, accounting for a large portion of the 37\nseconds it takes to run all my tests.  If the @DataPoints method is only\ncalled once, and the values are copied as necessary, then the\nimplementation would be much faster.\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
