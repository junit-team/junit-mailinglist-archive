From the<br/>\ndesign perspective, why have a whole Runner just for filtering by<br/>\ncategory?  There are other things you can filter on.  And, there were<br/>\nsome definitely hackish parts of the implementation.  And, it turns<br/>\nout, there were bugs in Categories, (such as<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://github.com/KentBeck/junit/issues#issue/74)\">http://github.com/KentBeck/junit/issues#issue/74)</a> that were very hard<br/>\nto elegantly fix with the current design.  And, (sorry, maven<br/>\nhopefuls), but we were anxious to get back into the meat of the code.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, the first 4.9 snapshot is up today, with a new way of specifying<br/>\nsuites, called SuiteBuilder.  SuiteBuilder allows for flexible<br/>\nspecification of where to find the classes containing tests, and how<br/>\nto filter the resulting runners.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis suite class lists the explicit test classes to consider running,<br/>\nand then filters it down to only those tests or classes annotated with<br/>\n`@Category(Yes.class)`:<br/>\n<br/>\n\t@RunWith(SuiteBuilder.class)<br/>\n\tpublic static class OnlyYes {<br/>\n\t\t@Classes<br/>\n\t\tpublic Listed classes= new Listed(Yes1.class, Yes2.class, No1.class);<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t@RunnerFilter<br/>\n\t\tpublic CategoryFilter filter= CategoryFilter.include(Yes.class);<br/>\n\t}<br/>\n\t<br/>\nWe hope to soon include other implementations for the @Classes<br/>\nannotation, including a classpath-searching test gatherer.  Other<br/>\nimplementations for @RunnerFilter also make sense (if you look close,<br/>\nyou&#39;ll see that RunnerFilter implementations can also re-order<br/>\nrunners, as well as selecting them).<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease have fun, and let us know how it works for you.  Thanks,<br/>\n<br/>\n   David Saff</div>",
