But here is some advice\nwhich will hopefully help you in resolving it:\n1. Try writing some test cases for the other methods you have written. If\nthese test cases also result in the stack overflow, then they will hopefully\nnarrow down what circumstances the problem occurs under.\n2. Look for places in your code where something is being added to a\ncollection. These are places where not implementing a hashCode or equals\nmethod; or the order of inserts might be important. Write test cases to\nvalidate that these are working as you expect.\n3. Refactor the very long methods into smaller methods while adding tests\nfor them. It is hard to understand and debug methods that have deeply nested\nif/else conditions.\n4. You can try adding System.out.println&#39;s to your code as Stefan suggests.\nI would do this as a last resort. The failing test case is trying to tell\nyou something about the code and the process used to write it.\n5. When you find the fix, report back and let others know about the\nexperience. It&#39;s always good to share :-)\nGood luck!\n-Dennis\n\nOn Thu, Aug 7, 2008 at 8:07 AM, Stefan Schulze &lt;algroth@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt;   Hi Fuguo,\n&gt;\n&gt; I didn&#39;t meant that you have the same problem.
