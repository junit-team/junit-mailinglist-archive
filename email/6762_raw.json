Rainsberger&quot; &lt;jbr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; Kirill!\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; &lt;snip /&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Generally there is one test per use case scenario (different\nflow\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; through the use case). Choosing to write more or fewer tests\nshould\n&gt;&gt; be\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; done thoughtfully.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; In my experience, there are several alternative flows for a\nordinary\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; use case. And I see reasonable to test at least two of them:\nbasic\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; flow and error flow. What do you think?\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Usually there are three kinds of flows:\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; 1. The usual flow\n&gt;&gt; 2. Alternate usual flows\n&gt;&gt; 3. Error flows\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; I use the term &quot;use case scenario&quot; to mean a path through a use case\n&gt;&gt; with many flows. Each &quot;flow&quot; is a use case scenario. I believe that\n&gt;&gt; this is the standard UML term. When I say &quot;use case scenario&quot;, it is\n&gt;&gt; now clear what I mean.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Generally, the goal is to write one Customer Test per use case\n&gt;&gt; scenario. There may even be additional tests, depending on the\nnumber\n&gt;&gt; of different representative data points along the way.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; I prioritize as follows:\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; 1. Usual flow test\n&gt;&gt; 2. Fatal error flow tests\n&gt;&gt; 3. Normal alternative flow tests\n&gt;&gt; 4. Non-fatal error flow tests\n&gt;&gt; 5. Others\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; If there are, for example, 20 scenarios for a use case, then I need\nto\n&gt;&gt; sit down and decide whether the use case is too big.\n&gt;\n&gt;  OK, now I see what you mean. Sorry, actually I&#39;ve read your text not\n\n&gt;  as &quot;test case per user case scenario&quot; but &quot;test case per use case&quot;. \n&gt;  Now, I still suggest having a package per use case and test class\nper\n&gt;  use case scenario.\n\nI suppose we understand each other now. &quot;Each use case scenario is\ncaptured by at least one Customer Test.&quot; I don&#39;t say anything about\nTestCase classes yet.\n\n&gt;  Now about &quot;too big&quot; part. I&#39;m not sure if you can do anything with\nuse \n&gt;  case size itself. You can implement scenarios one-by-one, in order\nyou \n&gt;  suggested, and make each flow a separate story. But all of them \n&gt;  still belong to the same use case! From this point of view, it is\nright \n&gt;  to have Customer test per scenario.\n\nI agree that some use cases are just big, although they may be able to\nbe decomposed into smaller use cases, depending on the details.\n\nAgain, depending on how one defines &quot;scenario&quot;, one may need to write\nmany Customer Tests for one scenario, especially if different input\ndata materially affects the flow. (One could argue that this creates a\ndistinct scenario, and I generally agree, but I have to allow for the\nfact that different people use the same terms differently.)\n\n&lt;snip /&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; - It is easier to get full list of existing functional tests if\nwe\n&gt;&gt; put\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; each test case into a single class. Getting the list is quite\nusual\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; task requested by QA department or customer (or I&#39;m wrong here?)\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Certainly this is a good idea. There must be a way to present the\nlist\n&gt;&gt; of currently-implemented Customer Tests to groups like QA. Dividing\nthe\n&gt;&gt; tests among classes is one way to achieve this. Some kind of xDoclet\n&gt;&gt; thing would be another. (Step in, Mr. Gemkow, to provide some\n&gt;&gt; information here.)\n&gt;\n&gt;  I&#39;ll try to look at it. But, as far as I expect, this tool separates\n&gt;  the test description from code. And I envision the situation when \n&gt;  &quot;copy class&quot; or &quot;copy method&quot; feature will be used without updating\n&gt;  the description. To have incorrect test/class name is quite more\n&gt;  noticable, than having incorrect javadoc and such.\n\nNo, indeed; however, a Customer Test&#39;s name is not a function of the\nstructure of the software; rather it is a function of the words used to\ndescribe the system&#39;s behavior. Consider the case of the original C3\napplication. They used the Bin, Part, Station metaphor and named their\nclasses that way; but it&#39;s still a Payroll application and I can&#39;t\nimagine that the Customer Tests mentioned Bin, Part and Station! Surely\nthe Customer Tests &quot;spoke&quot; the domain language of payroll: cheque,\npayee, employee, deduction, and so on.\n\nIn short, Programmer Test names reflect the design; Customer Test names\nreflect the domain.\n\n&lt;snip /&gt;\n&gt;&gt; If I am in that situation and I cannot find a test fixture to match\nmy\n&gt;&gt; current needs, then I build a new one and let the team refactor it\nas\n&gt;&gt; they come across it. Eventually, someone will feel the pain of not\n&gt;&gt; having the right test fixture and will find the problem.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Good point. But it should be a spirit in the team to fix tests of\n&gt;  another team member as soon as the see duplication in the test code.\n\nThis is part of the definition of the term &quot;team&quot;. Anything else is a\n&quot;group&quot;. :)\n\n&lt;snip /&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; I have to say that your list of points is excellent and should\nbe\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; turned into a short article on the subject.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Thank you very much. Actually, I thought about it and I&#39;ll\npossibly\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; try to write one.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; I am more than willing to edit it, if you need some help.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Thank you for the offer. BTW, is is OK to post draft on the list\n&gt;  for feedback? Possibly someone else will also want to comment.\n\nI don&#39;t mind if they don&#39;t mind.\n\nHave fun with it. I have my own writing to do. :)\n\n\nJ. B.
