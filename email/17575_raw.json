Rainsberger wrote:\n\n&gt; Elliotte, I don&#39;t understand this article.\n&gt; \n&gt; You say that there was a bug in this code:\n&gt; \n&gt;      private void _setType(Type type) {\n&gt;          this.type = type;\n&gt;      }\n&gt; \n&gt; This bug caused a NullPointerException to occur. I don&#39;t see how that&#39;s \n&gt; possible, since &quot;this&quot; cannot be null. \n\nEither you misread or I miswrote the article (or both). The bug was not \nthat a NullPointerException was thrown. The bug was that a \nNullPointerException was *not* thrown when the client passed in null to \nthe public API.\n\nOnce pointed out, it was obviously a bug. XOM doesn&#39;t allow most things \nto be null, and indeed promises they aren&#39;t. Prior to writing the test, \nI devised an incorrect solution to the problem that put the null check \nin the wrong place (the non-public method). Writing the test suddenly \nmade it apparent that my solution was wrong, and that I needed to put \nthe null-check elsewhere (the public method). Had I not written the test \nbefore fixing the bug, I likely would not have noticed this.\n\nTDD isn&#39;t just about testing. It&#39;s also about helping you look at your \nown code from a different angle. Sometimes that helps you see things you \nwouldn&#39;t otherwise notice.\n\n-- \n﻿Elliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nJava I/O 2nd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeaulait.org/books/javaio2/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596527500/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/\n\n",
