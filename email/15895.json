This is exactly <br/>\nwhat we need to make sure that JUnit 4 will meet users&#39; needs.  Just to <br/>\ngive you an idea of what you can expect:<br/>\n<br/>\nBen Maurer wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Ant XML output<br/>\n&gt; --------------<br/>\n&gt; [...]<br/>\n&gt; However, in rc2, it looks like:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;testcase classname=&quot;junit.framework.JUnit4TestAdapterCache$2$1&quot; <br/>\n&gt; name=&quot;unknown&quot; time=&quot;0.018&quot;&gt;&lt;/testcase&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That doesn&#39;t look good, does it?  If my initial guess as to this bug&#39;s <br/>\nsource is correct, this will be easily fixed (back to rc1&#39;s behavior, at <br/>\nleast) soon.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Stack Trace Filtering<br/>\n&gt; ---------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The stack trace from junit messages have always been filed with junit.*<br/>\n&gt; traces. Ant filters these out. However, now there are org.junit things<br/>\n&gt; slipping through. Also, tests with a timeout, have many<br/>\n&gt; java.util.concurrent frames in them. Why leave this kind of filtering up<br/>\n&gt; to each tool? JUnit should filter out the frames it knows are from it.<br/>\n&gt; This would make command line output look nicer. I think NUnit does this.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is tricky.  The JUnit API actually reports the Exception objects to <br/>\nthe tools, which are then responsible for displaying / parsing stack <br/>\ntraces.  I don&#39;t know that there&#39;s anything we could do to make <br/>\npre-JUnit 4 tools automatically filter the org.junit lines, but we might <br/>\nlook at something for the future.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; @Test(expected=) traces<br/>\n&gt; -----------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; When you have an expected exception, and another one gets thrown, the<br/>\n&gt; error trace doesn&#39;t contain the bad exception. You only get:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; java.lang.AssertionError: Unexpected exception, <br/>\n&gt; expected&lt;java.util.NoSuchElementException&gt; but <br/>\n&gt; was&lt;java.lang.NullPointerException&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Having the trace of the bad exception would help TAs debug student code. <br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s a good idea.  We&#39;ll try to have that in the next release.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again--let us know what other issues you see, and good luck with <br/>\nthe class!<br/>\n<br/>\n    David Saff</div>",
