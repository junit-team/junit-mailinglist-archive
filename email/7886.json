Can you imaging trying to use ant to build a VM?<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\n </span></blockquote>In short, because ANT doesn&#39;t have built-in, precompiled and configured <br/>\ndependency rules and flags for things like &quot;cc&quot;, &quot;ld&quot;, and so on.  These are things that <br/>\nare trivially constructed in a shell call or make dependency rules, but rather complex, <br/>\nverbose, and circuitous when wrapped in XML.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, ant *can* do other things besides compile sets of java files for use by javac and <br/>\njar, but it&#39;s not necessarily well-suited to do so.<br/>\nIt is one thing to say ant can do what make can do (after all, you can always write <br/>\nmore Java code, right?).  It is another to actually do it.</div>",
