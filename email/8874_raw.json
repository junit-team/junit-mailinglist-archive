But maybe that&#39;s just my configuration of yahoogroups. I\nhave been trying to sort it out by adding another &#39;&gt;&#39; in lines I suppose you\nquoted.  \n\n&gt;&gt;  Your underlying hypothesis appears to be this:\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;  If class A depends on B, then there exist tests T(A) that test A and\n&gt;&gt; tests T(B) that test B such that T(A) depends on T(B).\n&gt; \n&gt; Actaully, no (although it isn&#39;t something I object to for many use cases).\n&gt; \n&gt; I am merely asking that I can assert that T(A) depends on T(B) [for\n&gt; whatever reason] and I do so in T(A) [somehow] not in some separate\nsuite(A).\n\nThis seems to me to be the crucial point. IF you don&#39;t have side effects and\nIF you have decoupled code then I cannot see where dependencies between T(A)\nand T(B) make sense. A usually does not depend directly on B but on an\nabstract interface - B just being an implementation of that interface.\n\n&gt;&gt;  Get this straight: TEST CASE DEPENDENCY IS EVIL. Test cases should be as\n&gt;&gt; independent as possible. It should be possible to select a number of\ntests\n&gt;&gt; and just run them. JUnit supports that. You can build your TestSuite\n&gt;&gt; however you want. The fact that there aren&#39;t better tools for this\nsurprises me.\n&gt; \n&gt; No, here .... you are wrong. I beleive you mean that test cases ought have\n&gt; no &quot;results&quot; or &quot;side effects&quot; that other test cases depended upon. That\n&gt; is EVIL!!! Agreed, 100%.\n&gt; \n&gt; Run order (call it dependency order or whatever) that is not evil. If my\n&gt; collection object fails, why run the test of things that use it & waste\ntime\n&gt; debugging their failures? Even if by chance they worked, so what, trim\n&gt; down the results a human has to think over.\n\nMaybe the direct dependency on the collection object is the problem in the\nfirst place. You could take your problem with many test cases failing at once\nas a strong hint to remove this direct dependency. If your collection object,\nhowever, is so low level that a direct dependency does not hurt then it\nshould be very very stable; the probability that it fails in a fundamental way,\nwhich makes lots of other tests fail too, is very low. \n\n&gt;&gt;  Well, in general, JUnit doesn&#39;t change much. That&#39;s intentional. That&#39;s\n&gt;&gt; why we have projects like JUnit-addons, GSBase and so on.\n&gt; \n&gt; I agree with the goal, but some things are worth change. Although I&#39;ve\n&gt; followed your arguments (and support them) about keeping frameworks\n&gt; simple/pure & add-ons outside, (respectfully) I don&#39;t beleive you are\nfully opening\n&gt; you mind to that option. Lack of change is not an argument in itself.\n&gt; Sometimes the further you are from something the easier it is to see\nsomething,\n&gt; and I feel you are too close to junit and the goal of keeping it simple to\n&gt; see this does not break that. Thaa said, maybe I&#39;ve just failed to explain\n&gt; it. Want me to start again?\n&gt; \n&gt; Perhaps others have a point of view, I really do think a lot of this comes\n&gt; down to user choice and use cases.\n\nYou haven&#39;t convinced me (yet) about two points:\n- Why is the dependency between tests a FUNDAMENTAL concept and not just\nyour very personal way to sort out which test cases to run?\n- Why can&#39;t this concept be implemented without changing the core of JUnit?\n\nBut of course you&#39;re right stati8ng that many of us here are too involved in\nJUnit and thus have a hard time giving up on &quot;invariants&quot; we consider to be\n&quot;everlasting&quot;.\n\nJohannes\n\n-- \nCOMPUTERBILD 15/03: Premium-e-mail-Dienste im Test\n--------------------------------------------------\n1.
