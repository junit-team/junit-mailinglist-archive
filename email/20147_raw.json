There doesn&#39;t seem to be a way to do what I want, but\nI just thoug=\r\nht I&#39;d check...\n\nI have a large number of test classes and they each need a=\r\n one-time\nstartup and one-time shutdown. So the sequence of events is like =\r\nthis:\n\nTest Class A\n  startup\n    test1\n    test2\n    test3\n  shutdown\nTest=\r\n Class B\n  startup\n    test1\n    test2\n  shutdown\n\nNow, the startup for eac=\r\nh test class is nearly identical except for\none small difference. I want to=\r\n put that one small difference in each\ntest class, but put the startup code=\r\n in a superclass. Like this:\n\nTestsSuperclass\n @BeforeClass\n public static =\r\nvoid startup() {\n   ...do startup stuff, using one piece of info from curre=\r\nntly running\nsubclass\n }\n\nI don&#39;t see any way to get info from the subclass=\r\n into that startup\nmethod. \n\nIf Java allowed static methods to be subclasse=\r\nd, that would solve it.\nBut no. \n\nIf the @BeforeClass methods would run sub=\r\nclass first, then superclass,\nthen in the subclass I could set a static var=\r\niable defined in the\nsuperclass. But no. \n\nIf Junit allowed @BeforeClass to=\r\n be non-static, it would be easy. But no. \n\nAm I missing something? Or am I=\r\n just stuck with putting the startup\ncode in every subclass&#39;s @BeforeClass?=\r\n\n\nThanks,\n\nLee\n\n\n",
