As I <br/>\nrecall, just adding the junit v4 jar made it work in eclipse.  You might <br/>\nckeck Windows-&gt;Preferences-&gt;Java-&gt;JUnit settings and make sure <br/>\neverything is fine.  You should see listings for JUnit 3 AND JUnit 4. <br/>\nMake sure you check &#39;Enable Assertions for JUnit ...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy problem was in running JUnit v4 from Ant.  To do this, I had to <br/>\ninstall Ant 1.7.x and update the ANT_HOME within Eclipse since it comes <br/>\nwith a built in Ant 1.6.x installation.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobert Kuropkat<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S.  You may need to make sure you have all the latest Eclipse updates...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\noferstu wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; *This message was transferred with a trial version of CommuniGate(tm) Pro*<br/>\n&gt; Hello,<br/>\n&gt; The link in JUnit.org website about how to use JUnit and eclipse is <br/>\n&gt; broken.<br/>\n&gt; My attempt to use JUnit with eclipse was to add the JUnit.jre file to <br/>\n&gt; the project in properties, build path.<br/>\n&gt; I added it and still cannot run JUnit4 code.<br/>\n&gt; What else should I do in order that the JUnit4 will work with my <br/>\n&gt; eclipse?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thank you,<br/>\n&gt; Ofer.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
