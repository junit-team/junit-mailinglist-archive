And what a\ngreat book!  If you a reasonably new to the language and =\r\nperhaps design,\nthis book has a lot of information in it.  It sort of remin=\r\nds me (in some\nways) to the content of Robert C. Martin&#39;s Agile Software De=\r\nvelopment book\n(another great read BTW) ... but I think a bit easier to rea=\r\nd.\n\nHTH\nShane\n\nOn 3/8/06, Kamal Ahmed &lt;KAhmed@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; De=\r\nar Todd,\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I am reading the following books, but maybe not as fast as=\r\n you would\n&gt; expect\n&gt; me to.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; 1.      JUnit Recipes, By J.B Raisenbe=\r\nrger\n&gt; 2.      Pragmatic Unit Testing in Java with JUnit, by Andrew Hunt an=\r\nd\n&gt; David\n&gt; Thomas\n&gt; 3.      JUnit in Action, by Vincent Massol\n&gt; 4.      E=\r\nxtreme Programming with Ant, by Niemeyer Poteet.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I would welcome an=\r\ny suggestions, by you as well. My Java experience is\n&gt; only\n&gt; school, and 3=\r\n months at my previous job. So if my questions are at a level\n&gt; lower then =\r\nyou would expect to see,\n&gt;\n&gt; Then please let me know, I&#39;ll look elsewhere. =\r\nAnd I do appreciate your\n&gt; criticism, I will look more into the books first=\r\n before asking any\n&gt; question.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt;\n&gt; -Kamal.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; _____\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; From: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of\n&gt;=\r\n Bradley, Todd\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, March 07, 2006 10:17 AM\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogr=\r\noups.com\n&gt; Subject: RE: [junit] testing switch statements in method\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n C=E9dric Beust wrote:\n&gt; &gt; I think Kamal made it clear that changing the AP=\r\nI was not an\n&gt; &gt; option, so he&#39;s definitely looking for an option to test a=\r\nn\n&gt; &gt; API that he has no control over.  Sad, but fairly common in\n&gt; &gt; my op=\r\ninion.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; It&#39;s already been done, but I&#39;ll repeat it:  Michael\n&gt; &gt; Fea=\r\nther&#39;s book &quot;Testing legacy code&quot; contains some good\n&gt; &gt; advice for these k=\r\ninds of situations\n&gt;\n&gt; I don&#39;t believe we have any evidence that Kamal has\n=\r\n&gt; ever purchased and read any of the testing related\n&gt; books already recomm=\r\nended to him in the past on this\n&gt; list.  So, your recommendation will like=\r\nly fall on\n&gt; deaf ears.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Todd.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; SPONSORED LINKS\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Basic pro=\r\ngramming language\n&gt;\n&gt; C programming language\n&gt;\n&gt; Computer programming langu=\r\nages\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; The c programming language\n&gt;\n&gt; C++ programming language\n&gt;\n&gt; List=\r\n of programming languages\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; _____\n&gt;\n&gt; YAHOO!
