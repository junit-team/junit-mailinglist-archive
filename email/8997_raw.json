Others may \nhave done the same.  Not to mention we&#39;ve had one original thread \nspawn into at least 3 other threads, which have been responsible for \nmost of the traffic.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;d suggest some folks should think more between posts or take a \ndiscussion offline until things are resolved, then come back with a \nsummary.  But this is so unusual for this list (thinking over the \npast few years), it will probably return to normal soon by themselves.\n\nI&#39;d suggest some folks should possibly get an email client able to \ngroup mails by subject and then delete only those threads they aren&#39;t \ninterested in. I do this, and I was interested in the thread you are \nprobably referring to, so I am glad that it was on the list, not in \nprivate email.\n\nBut that&#39;s just me - I am known for my addicition to lengthy \ndiscussions... ;)\n\nNo hard feelings, Ilja\n\n\n",
