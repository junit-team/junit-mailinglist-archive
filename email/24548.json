We need a smart tool to teach the people not to commit not working code and that the single developer who broke a test is responsible to fix it. It is is much easier to let a tool detect the problematic commit instead of letting someone go thru each commit of the last day and after a few hours finally blame the one who caused the problem...</div>",
