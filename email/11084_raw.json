I use ANT to run Jcoverage on my Junit \ntests (bascially copied and pasted the ANT script with a few \nmodifications in the Jcoverage example directory for my project)... \nthe &lt;junit&gt; xml lang/tasks that you use within ANT, is there \nsomewhere where it is defined and can read about it somewhere?\n\nAlso, Jcoverage itself, when u click on an html report and see yellow \nlines... that means the unit tests didnt &#39;go over&#39; those lines of \ncode, hence they were not tested/&#39;covered&#39;?\n\nWhat if my prog in the GUI creates all the Objects by reading in a \nfile/not given with args[]. how can u unit test that? modify code so \nit uses instead a file on command line? or u wouldnt test that as its \nnot a individual &#39;unit&#39;?\n\nThanx,\nArian\n\n\n\n",
