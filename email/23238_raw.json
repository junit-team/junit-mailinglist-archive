Suites gather Tests sui=\r\ntes, but\n&gt;\n&gt; don&#39;t contain tests themselves. @Test methods in a suite don&#39;t=\r\n get\n&gt;\n&gt; executed, since a suite is not a test.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; BeforeClass and Af=\r\nterClass are also static methods and the functionality I need to implement =\r\nis once per instance, not once for all instances.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Here is what I do=\r\nn&#39;t quite understand: Once per instance of what?\n&gt;\n&gt; Do you mean once befor=\r\ne every test-method that is executed and once\n&gt;\n&gt; after every test method t=\r\nhat is executed?\n&gt;\n&gt; Or do you mean once before the suite and once after th=\r\ne suite?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Is there a pattern in JUnit for BeforeSuite and AfterSuit=\r\ne functionality?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; The pattern I know of is: @BeforeClass and @AfterC=\r\nlass in the Suite-class.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; If you want to execute once before every t=\r\nest method and once after\n&gt;\n&gt; every test method, you need @Before-methods a=\r\nnd @After-methods in the\n&gt;\n&gt; tests.
