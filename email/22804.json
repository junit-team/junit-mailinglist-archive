    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1180172724\">According to Java, there is only one main method allowed per class.<br/>\nTraditionally, I use more then one method in a given class.  If I were<br/>\nlimited to only testing one method at a time, then I would miss a great many<br/>\nmethods.  Plus, I have to change the main method to call a different<br/>\nmethod.<br/>\nHowever,<br/>\n- if I were to make a very complex main method, that called all of my<br/>\nmethods...<br/>\n- - I&#39;d have to maintain this complex main method.<br/>\n- - I&#39;d have to add logic to make sure that all my tests execute, even if<br/>\nthe first one threw an exception<br/>\n- if I were to provide arguments to the main method to determine which<br/>\nmethod to test...<br/>\n- -  I&#39;d still have to call Java multiple times to test all my methods.<br/>\n<br/>\n- in both cases<br/>\n- - I&#39;d have to write assertion logic, that displays expected and actual<br/>\nvalues, so I can determine what was wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaking main method&#39;s also corrupts the actual code with methods that are not<br/>\nneeded for execution.  Using separate test classes allows for easy removal<br/>\nof test code from your deployment.  If every class is wired tightly to their<br/>\ntest code, then how do you strip it out without modifying the code base.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your argument is, why use JUnit if it is just another java program that<br/>\nexecutes java code.  I see nothing prohibiting one from writing their own<br/>\ntest harness...  I personally would want to stay away from such an endeavor,<br/>\nbut feel free to try and succeed.  May your time on the project be<br/>\nenjoyable.<br/>\n<br/>\nBig Mike<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Mon, Jul 12, 2010 at 3:27 PM, dk &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dinesh_hem2000@...\">dinesh_hem2000@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Why do we need to use JUnits?<br/>\n&gt; If we have to test any new class, we could create a new class, inside that<br/>\n&gt; class we could declare a main() method and call the function to be tested<br/>\n&gt; with the required arguments.<br/>\n&gt; Does using JUnits provide any extra feature or additional functionality<br/>\n&gt; over this way of testing,i.e, declaring main() methods and testing?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>",
