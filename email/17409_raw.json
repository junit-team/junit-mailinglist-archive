When you ship\nyour cod=\r\ne, you certainly hope there is no bug in it. I was just responding\nto the c=\r\nlaim that &quot;if you don&#39;t TDD your code, you don&#39;t know that it works&quot;\nby say=\r\ning that &quot;there are plenty of ways to know that your code works, and\ntestin=\r\ng is only one of them&quot; (and an imperfect one at that, as somebody\npointed o=\r\nut earlier in this thread).\n\nTest cases are the only reliable indicator of =\r\ncode quality _and_ code\n&gt; reliability, and because they are automated gives=\r\n me far greater\n&gt; confidence in the integrity of the code I write.\n\nAbsolut=\r\nely.\n\nIf I&#39;m asked to review some code and tests, I will sit down and read =\r\nthe\ncode, and asking whether this code was tested using TDD will give me ve=\r\nry\nlittle clue as to its quality.\n\nKent&#39;s argument has always worked for me=\r\n - TDD when you can, think about\n&gt; it when you can&#39;t.\n\nAgreed. I think that=\r\n saying &quot;if you don&#39;t do TDD, you don&#39;t know that your\ncode works&quot; is prepo=\r\nsterous.\n\nIn my opinion, it&#39;s not as important to &quot;test first&quot; as it is to =\r\n&quot;test\nsoon&quot;, which sometimes means &quot;first&quot; and other times means &quot;when you =\r\nthink\nit&#39;s time&quot;.\n\n-- \nC=C3=A9dric\nhttp://testng. org\n\n[Non-text portions o=\r\nf this message have been removed]\n\n\n \n\n[Non-text portions of this message h=\r\nave been removed]\n\n\n\n\n",
