This can happen if you work with a class that is declared final.   <br/>\nMy one advice would be not to actually create a server connection for unit tests. Your tests are supposed to be simple. Try to create Fake server connection and pass them across. <br/>\n<br/>\nUnit testing and refactoring should go hand in hand. If something is stopping you from unit testing, it would be a good time to start throwing away something. There is a problem here too. To ensure your refactoring is right you should have unit tests but then that is the purpose why you started refactoring. This is a chicken and egg problem. So start refactoring in small steps.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are some good articles in developerWorks featuring Unit testing. I have read the reviews of a book called &quot;Working Effectively with Legacy Code&quot;(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Working-Effectively-Legacy-Robert-Martin/dp/0131177052/ref=pd_bxgy_b_img_a)\">http://www.amazon.com/Working-Effectively-Legacy-Robert-Martin/dp/0131177052/ref=pd_bxgy_b_img_a)</a> which seems to be useful. I did not get my hands yet on this book.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would suggest getting some hands on this book and something like this or taking a short training on agile training.<br/>\n<br/>\nregards,<br/>\nSuresh   <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- On Mon, 6/29/09, Bradley, Todd &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:todd.bradley@...\">todd.bradley@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Bradley, Todd &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:todd.bradley@...\">todd.bradley@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: RE: [junit] unit testing clinet server applications?<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nDate: Monday, June 29, 2009, 9:57 AM<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n      Is your application designed in such a way that you can test your code<br/>\n<br/>\nwithout starting another process (for your server)?  I&#39;ve had better<br/>\n<br/>\nluck mocking out server-side code at a slightly higher layer.  In other<br/>\n<br/>\nwords, unless you don&#39;t trust the code that does your wire protocol and<br/>\n<br/>\nTCP/IP communication, include that in the mock.  Then your mock can just<br/>\n<br/>\nbe Java classes wired up at runtime, and you don&#39;t have to have the<br/>\n<br/>\nheadaches with starting and stopping another process.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTodd. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: junit@yahoogroups. com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups. com] On <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Behalf Of angeshwar<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Monday, June 29, 2009 3:19 AM<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups. com<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Subject: [junit] unit testing clinet server applications?<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Hi,<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I have a client server application.
