This is a web-development\n&gt; framework that has testing built in from the very start. Virtually\n&gt; every facet of a rails application is intended to be written using\n&gt; TDD. The point is that the new hyper-productive frameworks are\n&gt; adopting TDD from the get-go.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot disputing this point (as I have only been using Rails now for a week or\ntotal and so far I love the testing capabilities that I have seenl) but I\nwas disappointed that the Pragmatic Series book Agile Web Development with\nRails has no coverage of applying TDD with Rails.\n\nOne could argue that this was not the point of the book, that it is about\nlearning the Rails framework but I just expected to see some mention and\ndemonstration of it by either Dave Thomas of Mike Clark.\n\nPerhaps when I have moved further along I may change my opinion on this :-)\n\nCheers\nShane\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
