I realize that handing the control to CVS about a test being<br/>\nwritten or not (that&#39;s essentially what I was proposing) is a bad<br/>\nidea. Especially the effect on developers can&#39;t be underestimated as<br/>\nit seems. Writing tests should be a help and not a boring task.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout Ant and JUnit: I setup a small example with Ant running JUnit<br/>\ntests and noticed that it&#39;s generally possible to select the tests I&#39;d<br/>\nlike to run via Ant (nothing special about it), the downside being the<br/>\nnecessity to alter the build file every time which is a bad idea. The<br/>\ndefault option is to run all existing tests, of course, but certain<br/>\nsituations demand partial test execution only. Is there a way to do<br/>\nthis without messing without Ant&#39;s build file? I was thinking of<br/>\nsomething similiar like TestNG&#39;s feature of grouping tests by name,<br/>\nbut it should work without Java 5<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards,<br/>\n<br/>\nMaik<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;J.

It assumes that 100% of code needs to be tested. While this <br/>\n&gt; might be a good goal, experience shows that it is not practical. No <br/>\n&gt; machine can judge whether a given test is worth writing; only humans<br/>\ncan <br/>\n&gt; do that.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Also, if people write tests only because some machine tells them to,<br/>\nyou <br/>\n&gt; probably won&#39;t see high quality tests.<br/>\n&gt; -- <br/>\n&gt; J.
