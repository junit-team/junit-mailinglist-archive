Rainsberger&quot; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;If I didn&#39;t spend 80 hours writing these tests, I could spend my time\n&gt; &gt; &gt; writing each test as I need it and the rest of the time writing new\n&gt; &gt; &gt; code. Given what I know about the code, I won&#39;t be any faster writing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; tests whether I write them all at once or as I need them. With that in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mind, what would you like me to do? In the worst case, I need all the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; tests up front and end up writing them now anyway. It looks like you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; win.&quot; How does that sound, everyone?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;I think it&#39;s important to understand the value of test coverage as\n&gt; &gt;perceived by the person requesting those tests.  In other words, if you\n&gt; &gt;had automatically-generated tests for all the code, how might that help\n&gt; &gt;you?\n&gt;\n&gt; Me, personally? Not at all. I have worked with generated code long enough\n&gt; not to trust it. That&#39;s a personal bias that is perhaps unnecessarily\n&gt; difficult for people to get around.\n&gt;\n&gt; One, in general? Automatically-generated tests could help by providing a\n&gt; refactoring safety net before the programmer was able to understand and\n&gt; therefore craft by hand the same tests. It also has the downside of\n&gt; absolving the programmer of the responsibility of understanding what the\n&gt; tests are doing -- this is because generated code is usually very difficult\n&gt; to read -- rendering their communication value quite low.\n&gt;\n&gt; Even if the autogen tests worked, the programmer would still likely want to\n&gt; replace those tests with ones he can understand, over time. Then they would\n&gt; be great. The problem is simple: I can&#39;t trust them enough. :)\n&gt;\n\nYes, that&#39;s my experience, as well.  A safety net I don&#39;t trust is no safety\nnet at all.  I can let a tool generate tests all day long, but in the end I&#39;m\nno more confident to move forward then I was to begin with.  And,\nunfortunately, I&#39;m still ignorant of how the code actually works.\n\nMike\n\n--\nMike Clark\nClarkware Consulting, Inc.\nhttp://www.clarkware.com\n720.851.2014\n\n\n\n",
