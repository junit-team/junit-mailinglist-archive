Do you know how do I setup Xalan and Xerces in classpath XP pro? How those is worked with Junit?\n   \n  and what happens?  \n  I set up the class path with properly and when I runned by type: java junit.swingui.TestRunner; It showed the the GUI but it&#39;s hard to test it because I found message say &quot;no test cases found. Checked that the configured &#39;TestCollector&#39; is supported on this platform&quot;. How do deal with TestCollector in thsi case?
