This\nis not happened becaus=\r\ne programmer forgot to do this check. It is the\nbug. Instead AssertionError=\r\n is thrown by the code itself, because\nprogrammer that writed doSqrt() meth=\r\nod clearly states that his\nprecondition is that argument is valid. We shoul=\r\nd be fails before.\nAssertionError shouldn&#39;t happen.\n--- In junit@yahoogroup=\r\ns.com, &quot;toalexsmail&quot; &lt;toalexsmail@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; In JUnit 3.8 there was di=\r\nfference between assertion error\n&gt; (assertTrue(flag) fails, for example) an=\r\nd exception (unexpected\n&gt; exception thrown). It was indicated as F (failure=\r\ns) and E (exception).\n&gt; Why this was removed from JUnit 4?\n&gt; \n&gt; Moreover, i=\r\nf asserts of JDK 1.4 was used (assert obj!=3Dnull;) both in\n&gt; the tested co=\r\nde and in the tests than, if assertion is enabled,\n&gt; AssertionError was thr=\r\nown that caused to exception. In JUnit 4 it will\n&gt; cause to failure because=\r\n AssertionFailedError now extends\n&gt; AssertionError so from JUnit point of v=\r\niew there is no difference.\n&gt; It is true, that in JUnit 4 there is no diffe=\r\nrence between failures\n&gt; and exception, so it shouldn&#39;t be a problem. But, =\r\nas I see it is.\n&gt; Consider for example following example.\n&gt; \n&gt; public class=\r\n Calculator {\n&gt;  ...\n&gt;  public double sqrt(double a){\n&gt;    //here should be=\r\n check that a&gt;=3D0 that is missing\n&gt;    return doSqrt(a);\n&gt;  }\n&gt; \n&gt;  privat=\r\ne double doSqrt(double a){\n&gt;    //a should be valid at this point\n&gt;    asse=\r\nrt &quot;a should be not negative!&quot; : a&gt;=3D0;\n&gt;    ...\n&gt;   }\n&gt; }\n&gt; \n&gt; public cla=\r\nss CalculatorTest {\n&gt;  // the logger\n&gt;  private static final Log log =3D Lo=\r\ngFactory.getLog(CalculatorTest.class);\n&gt;  private Calculator calc;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n @BeforeClass\n&gt;  public static void oneTimeSetup(){\n&gt; \t// do your one time =\r\nset-up here!\n&gt; \tlog.debug(&quot;Going to check whether asserts are enabled&quot;);\n&gt; =\r\n\tboolean assertsEnabled =3D false;\n&gt; \tassert (assertsEnabled =3D true); // =\r\nIntentional side effect!!!\n&gt; \tif (!assertsEnabled) {\n&gt; \t  throw new Asserti=\r\nonError(&quot;Asserts must be enabled!!!&quot;);\n&gt; \t}\n&gt;   }\n&gt; \n&gt;  @Before\n&gt;  public v=\r\noid setUp() throws Exception {\n&gt;    calc =3D new Calculator(...);\n&gt;  }\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {\n&gt;    Request r =\r\n=3D Request.aClass(clazz);\n&gt;    JUnitCore runner =3D new JUnitCore();\n&gt;    =\r\nRunListener listener=3D new TextListener();\n&gt;    runner.addListener(listene=\r\nr);\n&gt;    runner.run(r);\n&gt;  }\n&gt; \n&gt;  @Test\n&gt;  public void testNegativeInput()=\r\n {\n    try {\n     calc.sqrt(-1);\n     fail(&quot;IllegalArgumenException is expe=\r\ncting&quot;);\n    }\n    catch(IllegalArgumenException e){\n      assert true : &quot;i=\r\nt&#39; ok&quot;;\n    } \n  }\n&gt; \n&gt; assert are used inside the code in order to validat=\r\ne what programmer\n&gt; is think is true in some point of the program. They are=\r\n often used to\n&gt; check preconditions of the private methods. In the above e=\r\nxample,\n&gt; programmer that writed doSqrt() method states that precondition o=\r\nf\n&gt; this method is that he receives valid parameter. So, this JDK 1.4\n&gt; ass=\r\nertion fails has nothing with JUnit 4 assertXXX() fails and it\n&gt; should be =\r\nconsidered as exception, as in case that unexpected\n&gt; exception is thrown.\n=\r\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n",
