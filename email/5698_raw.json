Our main problems are locking down objects\nwhile state transitions are occuring.  We wrote some pretty basic thread\ntools based on ones in various books and then wrote unit tests for them.\nIt turns out that the unit tests were extremely tricky but I haven&#39;t found\nan easier way to test mulithreaded behavior.\n\nBelow I have attached a read/write lock implementation and the accompanying\nunit test.  The unit test uses a conditional event and so I have included\nthat also.  I have stripped out all the code and just left the signatures\nand comments from the ReadWriteLock and ConditionalEvent since I don&#39;t\nthink my employer wants me publishing its code, but I have left the entire\ntest intact.\n\nI could not get to javaranch so I could not get to your original post, but\nif you want to send some code (even if it is privately), I would be willing\nto take a look.\n\n-Phil\n\n\n(See attached file: ReadWriteLockTest.java)(See attached file:\nReadWriteLock.java)(See attached file: ConditionalEvent.java)\n\n\n\n                                                                                      \n                    &quot;weitzman_d&quot;                                                      \n                    &lt;weitzman_d@y        To:     junit@yahoogroups.com                \n                    ahoo.com&gt;            cc:                                          \n                                         Subject:     [junit] Unit testing            \n                    08/29/2002           multithreaded network code                   \n                    03:05 PM                                                          \n                    Please                                                            \n                    respond to                                                        \n                    junit                                                             \n                                                                                      \n                                                                                      \n\n\n\n\nI&#39;ve asked this question at javaranch.com, so I&#39;ll just provide an\nbrief description here and point to the original question for anyone\nwho wants to give it a shot (just reply on this list though).\n\nI&#39;m writing the beginnings of a multithreaded server, and I had to\ninsert a lot of calls to Thread.sleep() in my unit testing code for\nit to pass.  Is there some good way to test multithreaded code that\ndoesn&#39;t invole just waiting a few milliseconds and hoping that a task\nfinished?  I imagine that a better solution might involve calls to\njoin() but tie the unit test closely to the particular implementation.\n\nAnyway, here&#39;s the original question with my current, unsatisfactory\ntest (although it doesn&#39;t have much of the code being tested - I\ndidn&#39;t want to clutter the post.  I should add some.):\n\nhttp://saloon.javaranch.com/cgi-bin/ubb/ultimatebb.cgi?\nubb=get_topic&f=9&t=001390\n\n\n\n\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\njunit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n\n\nYour use of Yahoo!
