I jumped to my guns<br/>\n&gt; too quickly.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Thanks for posting this rectification, Joakim, I appreciate.<br/>\n<br/>\nLook, I&#39;m trying to build a bridge here.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn one hand, we have a small (very small) population of people who&#39;ve put<br/>\ntesting at the forefront of every single engineering task they undertake<br/>\nevery day at the exclusion of anything else.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, we have the &quot;rest of the world&quot;, which is slowly waking<br/>\nup to the values of automated testing but is also dealing with massive code<br/>\nbases that were not only *not* designed for automated testing, but for which<br/>\nautomated testing might simply be impossible to implement (and yes, I can<br/>\ncome up with a few examples that will make the most radical TDD<br/>\npractitioners go very humble).<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t have anything to sell here.  I&#39;m not a consultant, I don&#39;t get paid<br/>\nif you use TestNG or if you do more automated testing.  But I&#39;ve worked on<br/>\nboth sides of the fence:  I love testing, I like TDD to a certain extent,<br/>\nbut I&#39;m also seeing a few flaws and gaps in reality between what I read and<br/>\nthe rest of the industry, and because of that, I feel that I can offer a<br/>\nperspective that both sides can relate to.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen somebody posts on this mailing-list asking for help because they can&#39;t<br/>\nfollow to the letter principles explained in extreme books, I feel as a<br/>\npersonal obligation to tell them &quot;It&#39;s okay, let&#39;s take it one step at a<br/>\ntime&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nSoon, I&#39;ll post a few additional thoughts on where I see limitations (and<br/>\nsometimes flaws) in TDD and code coverage, and I have no doubt that some of<br/>\nyou will choose to interpret that as &quot;Cedric hates TDD&quot; and &quot;Cedric doesn&#39;t<br/>\nbelieve in code coverage&quot; but I hope the rest of you will see beyond that<br/>\nand use these arguments to make educated decisions on when and where to use<br/>\nthe best tool for your job.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause the truth is that there is no silver bullet to write good code, and<br/>\nyou should be very skeptical of anyone who is trying to convince you<br/>\notherwise.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nCédric<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://testng.org\">http://testng.org</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
