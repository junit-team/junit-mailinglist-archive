To test<br/>\n&gt;  one Service (under 2,000 lines of code for 7 methods using 80<br/>\n&gt;  properties) that simply offers a standard set of<br/>\n&gt;  Get/Create/Update/Delete methods on an entity, the tests run over 5<br/>\n&gt;  files to a total length of 30,000 lines! In order to get test<br/>\n&gt;  coverage above 80%, there&#39;s a large amount of test code that simply<br/>\n&gt;  checks that the gets/sets work... which most of the time they can&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;  help but do anyway.<br/>\n&lt;/SNIP&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHi,<br/>\n<br/>\nI have selectively responded to the paragraph I can offer input to;<br/>\nhope thats OK :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nRegarding he getters/setters testing, some believe it is trivial, but<br/>\nI&#39;ve been burned too many times to not do it.  You don&#39;t have to do<br/>\nit... until you do ;-)  To ease the pain - try to implement/utilise<br/>\nTestUtil from<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://gtcgroup.com/util/\">http://gtcgroup.com/util/</a><br/>\nthen one line of code tests your accessors.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other thing that strikes me in this paragraph of your post, was<br/>\nthat these classes/methods are perhaps rather large.  Most TDD methods<br/>\nare short and succint, five to 10 lines.  It appears as if there is a<br/>\nfear of adding methods or classes here, or perhaps that your workplace<br/>\nis not doing TDD, but adding tests after the fact to get code coverage<br/>\nup to pass QA.  In my experince TDD lends itself to nice short<br/>\ntestable methods.  A really good example of this, (short methods), in<br/>\na large system is to look at any smalltalk image, (which I&#39;m guessing<br/>\nyou will be able to browse and and get the gist of the unfamiliar<br/>\ncode) - perhaps Squeak<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.squeak.org\">http://www.squeak.org</a>  - very few of the entire systems methods fall<br/>\ninto the size you describe.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs you have good tests already, heavy refactoring, (Extract Method),<br/>\nbefore changing any code may be the way to ease the load, the amount<br/>\nof code under test, and the amount of setup required.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards,<br/>\nChris </span></blockquote></div>",
