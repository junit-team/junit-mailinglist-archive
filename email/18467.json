Could you elaborate?<br/>\n<br/>\n, and in the end, you&#39;re probably better off simply writing a<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  method assertButtonIsEnabled(enabled) which, in my opinion, is the most<br/>\n&gt;  readable of all.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>How does that scale better?<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the problems with assertXxxx(String message, Object expected,<br/>\nObject actual). Is that it is not obvious where expected and actual<br/>\nshould go. With the precence of a descriptive message and checking<br/>\nstrings for equality it can become even funnier. with<br/>\nassertThat(Object actual, Expression expression) you simply can&#39;t mix<br/>\nthem (unless actual is also an expression).<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve noticed that a lot of people have issues with the asserThat<br/>\nsyntax and I have never been able to quite figure out why.</div>",
