I have looked at HttpUnit which is great for\ntesting the front end. I have looked at Cactus for\ntesting servlets. However I don&#39;t feel I need to test\nthe servlets directly as they are dynamically compiled\nvia the serving of JSP&#39;s. I have been using HttpUnit\nto test the JSP&#39;s. What I do want to do is test the\nEJB&#39;s in the Weblogic EJB container along with any\nclasses that make calls to EJB&#39;s. Obviously to get an\nEJB instance I need to be able to access or be inside\nan EJB container. \n\nOne approach I was thinking is to write some unit\ntests that would be available inside a weblogic\nserver. I could then either run the tests on startup\nof the server or write an admin type jsp to run the\ntests. The results could then be output the weblogic\nconsole or a jsp. \n\nHas anyone had to do something similar before. If so\nany helpfull comments would be most appreciated. In\naddition any code examples would also be a plus.\n\nRegards\n\nDavid  \n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nGet personalized email addresses from Yahoo!
