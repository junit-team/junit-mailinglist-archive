Specifically, it require us to implement a global counter for all te=\r\nsts, the counter record the number of failure, once it exceed this limit nu=\r\nmber, do something.\n\nFor example, we have Test case A, B; each has three te=\r\nsts. The whole test begin with Test A. Assume 2 tests of A failed, the coun=\r\nter is 2; then B begin, 1 test of B failed. Eventually the counter is 3. \n\n=\r\nBut I did some experiments, seem like each test case will be running in a s=\r\neparate JVM process. It is quite tricky to share a counter between two proc=\r\ness. \n\nI look through the API, maybe this requirement can be done with cust=\r\nom runner, though we do want change too much and continue to use Ant - Juni=\r\nt runner. \n\nPlease give me some hints on this issue. Thanks in advance.\n\n--=\r\n\nRegards.\n\nYang\n\n\n",
