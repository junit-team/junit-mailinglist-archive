I have a j2sdk1.4.2_06 directory on my <br/>\nroot C: drive and that is what I am referencing in my JAVA_HOME. I <br/>\neven went to what should be an unnecessart step to add the tools.jar <br/>\nfor this directory to my CLASSPATH property. I am not using 1.5 yet <br/>\nsince it has not been approved by the organization that I work for.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy when I specifically am pointing to this directory on JAVA_HOME <br/>\nand the CLASSPATH is it deciding to look in jre1.5.0_06&#92;lib down <br/>\nunder Program Files. It is obviously totally ignoring these <br/>\nproperties and going on its own hunting expedition. The question is, <br/>\nhow can I get it to stop?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Wayne Fay&quot; &lt;waynefay@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Might be related to the space in &quot;Program Files&quot;?
