Following \nalong at: \nhttp://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/%7Echeckout%7E/jdt-ui-\nhome/plugins/org.eclipse.jdt.junit/index.html\nit looked like I should just have to download and install the \norg.eclipse.pde.junit plugin and I should be able to run plugin tests.\n\nAfter installing that, the Run As-&gt;Junit Workbench is not available. \nThere is a Run As -&gt; Junit Plugin Test, but when ever I point that at \nmy test cases it seems to work for a few seconds then nothing \nhappens. If I look at the debug perspective I do see a new terminated \nJavaw.exe, so it looks like it tried to do something, but I have \nnothing on the console, and the Junit view is blank other then under \nFailure Trace which says &quot;Launching TestRunner&quot;.  There does not seem \nto be anything in the .log file either.\n\nAs a note, if I select the project that contains all the tests, and \ndo a Run As-&gt; Junit Plugin Test, it will find my test cases, but when \nI select the test I want to run, it does the same as above.  If I \njust do a Run as -&gt; Junit Test, then I can at least run simple tests.\n\nAny ideas as to what I may be doing wrong? Any information I missed \nposting that may help solve this?\n\nThanks, \n  -Peter\n\n\n\n",
