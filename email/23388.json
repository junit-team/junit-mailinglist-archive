The good news is that GitHub has<br/>\nreleased Issues 2.0, which, among other things, fixes the sorting<br/>\noptions in the issues display, among other goodies.  The bad news is<br/>\nthat they&#39;ve not only removed the ability to vote on bugs, they&#39;ve<br/>\neliminated the ability to display or sort by existing votes.  As you<br/>\nmay know, I was using votes as a way of prioritizing future<br/>\ndevelopment (and was getting excited about getting to the end of our<br/>\nrecent round of red tape, so we could start closing more of them<br/>\ndown!)<br/>\n<br/>\nI currently have a request in to github to at least let us know what<br/>\nthe final count was.  Moving forward, it seems that the new interface<br/>\ncan sort by comment count.  I&#39;ll probably use that as a proxy for<br/>\ncommunity interest (feel free to make simple &quot;+1&quot; comments if you feel<br/>\nthe need) for the time being, but I&#39;m open to other suggestions.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\n   David Saff</div>",
