These tests lean more towards being functional tests and <br/>\nrely on multiple failures being handled correctly. There have been <br/>\nseveral opinions on this list in support of multiple failures for <br/>\nfunctional tests. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I would like to know is the reason TestCase inherits from Assert <br/>\nrather than delegates to it. If it delegated, we could subclass <br/>\nTestCase to handle multiple failures and still use Assert for DbC.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards,<br/>\n<br/>\nDavid<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In junit@y..., &quot;kentlbeck&quot; &lt;kentbeck@c...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; When I&#39;ve wished for multiple failures to be recorded in my tests, <br/>\nmy <br/>\n&gt; tests were always too big. Splitting up the tests gave me more <br/>\n&gt; satisfactory tests, and pinpointed errors.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If you want multiple failures, it sounds like you want a different <br/>\n&gt; mechanism than fail().<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The advantage of having the methods be static is that you can do <br/>\nDbC <br/>\n&gt; and have pre-/post-condition failures reported like all other JUnit <br/>\n&gt; failures.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Kent </span></blockquote></div>",
