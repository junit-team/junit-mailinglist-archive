I am trying to write JUnit test for JMS,\n&gt; but i have no idea how to start it.If you have any example or anything\n&gt; regarding it, please post it. Please help me.    \n\nThe book _JUnit Recipes_ can offer you some help here. As for your first \ntest, answer two questions:\n\n1. How do you send a message? What has to happen in your application to \nsend a message?\n\n2. How can you tell that the message was successfully processed?\n\nPick one scenario and answer those two questions, then you have your \nfirst test.\n\nGood luck.\n-- \nJ. B.
