(which is on topic.)\n\nThe usual suggestions for rewriting the code are offered, such as using \na factory class to allocate/create objects, and always always just \nreturning the one and only.\n\nSo far, so good. But, the Factory class has to keep a store of \nanti-singletons. And the usual call is something like\n    AntiSingleton anAnti = Factory.createAntiSingleton();\n\nWhich is used statically, and implies that the Factory is a singleton so \nits cache of AntiSingletons can be kept in one and only one store.\n\nI&#39;m not seeing how changing the Singleton class to a class that needs \nthe singleton Factory class has done anything. We&#39;ve still got a \nsingleton, and so all arguments that there is implied coupling, and bad \nkarma for testing still hold.\n\nThanks\nPat\n\np.s. any hints of forums/lists where this topic could be explored would \nbe greatly appreciated. I&#39;ve found lots of places where rookies can ask \nhow to use a HashMap, and lots where folks argue about JSRs, but I&#39;m \nreally looking for somewhere where professional, experienced Java \ndevelopers can get answers to hard questions.\n\n\n-- \nPat Farrell\t\t\tpfarrell@...\nwww.bioinformatx.com\n\n\n",
