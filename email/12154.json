Our <br/>\nproduct has the ability to crawl through source code and provide a <br/>\npowerful search capability that is powered by semantics.  In this <br/>\ncase, we have crawled through several java development frameworks <br/>\n(JUnit, JDK, Struts, Eclipse, NetBeans) and are trying to get some <br/>\nproduct feedback.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are interested, setup is easy.
