I would like to know in what\n&gt; circumstances non-public test classes and methods would be valuable.\n\nIt&#39;s not a big deal. It&#39;s mostly just that I like to have a really clear \ndistinction between public (and protected) interfaces and non-public \ninterfaces in my libraries. Public interfaces can be counted on and \nrelied on, won&#39;t change without a deprecation cycle, must be documented \nin JavaDoc, and so forth. Non-public methods/classes don&#39;t need to be.\n\nMostly it just offends my sense of programming aesthetics to have all \nthese public classes and interfaces that aren&#39;t really part of the \npublished interfaces. Practically it means I have to do extra work to \nmake sure they don&#39;t show up in JavaDoc; don&#39;t get tested as public by \nstatic code checking tools, and the like. Bottom line: test classes are \nfor the developers; not the public. I think most developers pretty much \nknow they can&#39;t count on the interface to any test case. However, I&#39;d \nstill like to enforce that if I could.\n\nGoing forward in Java 1.6/1.7, I expect this to be a bigger issue. It \nshould soon become possible for subpackages to see the package protected \nparts of their super packages. Once that happens, there&#39;ll be much less \ntendency to make everything public and to distinguish between public and \npublished interfaces. The less we have to put in public the better.\n\n-- \nElliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nXML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim\n\n",
