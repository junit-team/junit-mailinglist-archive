I do\n&gt;\n&gt; know that it&#39;s possible to include JUnit tasks in Ant&#39;s build.xml, but\n&gt; I&#39;m looking for a way\n&gt;\n&gt; to make JUnit tests mandatory for every piece of code that&#39;s written\n&gt; and commited to our\n&gt;\n&gt; CVS. Is there a way to control uploads to CVS regarding JUnit?\n&gt;\n&gt; Another info I&#39;d like to have: is there a way to decide dynamically\n&gt; which tests Ant has to\n&gt;\n&gt; run (like running tests only for changed parts of source code, for\n&gt; example)? I do know that\n&gt;\n&gt; it is common to run all the tests all the time, I&#39;d just like to get\n&gt; to know all the\n&gt;\n&gt; possibilities Ant offers when it comes to JUnit.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
