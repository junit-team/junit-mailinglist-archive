Should test scenarios for A or B cover what may <br/>\n&gt; &gt; happen in C ? If so, is it just accepted as a code management <br/>\n&gt; &gt; overhead to ensure that C is properly tested via tests for A or B ?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Was the class in question designed through the application of <br/>\n&gt; TDD?  If so,<br/>\n&gt; what is C doing that is extra to what A and B need, and <br/>\n&gt; therefore covered by<br/>\n&gt; their tests?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I hope you can forgive me the extravagance of quoting myself from last<br/>\n&gt; month:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Test First means that very few of my methods are private, and <br/>\n&gt; I really don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; see this as a bad thing.  (Most of the ones that are private <br/>\n&gt; are there only<br/>\n&gt; because that&#39;s what Eclipses&#39; Extract Method refactoring does).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; NB:  That is not the same as making private methods public for testing<br/>\n&gt; purposes.  That should be avoided at all costs.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Regards,<br/>\n&gt; Shaun.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>---<br/>\nOutgoing mail is certified Virus Free.<br/>\nChecked by AVG anti-virus system (http://www.grisoft.com).<br/>\nVersion: 6.0.533 / Virus Database: 328 - Release Date: 10/31/2003</div>",
