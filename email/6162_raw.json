Do \n&gt;you think this is no longer a unit test when I start making sure that \n&gt;the messenger is respondeing correctly when something is added?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\nThe meaning of &quot;unit&quot; in &quot;unit test&quot; is ambiguous, at best.  Many of my \nunit tests actually test a constellation of objects, not a specific \nobject in isolation. So in that respect, debating whether it&#39;s a unit \ntest or an integration test is splitting hairs.\n\n&gt;Should the unit test only make sure that the addMessage() method is \n&gt;working (I.e. it received the message), and the integration test \n&gt;should then make sure that when a certain message is added it \n&gt;recieves the correct response message via the listener?\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\nMy personal style would be to test the guts of addMessage() without \nhaving to sleep anywhere in the test.  Sleeping takes time and will \nultimately cause my test suite to run slower than I&#39;d like.  So I&#39;d try \nto test the behavior synchronously. If that were difficult, I&#39;d take a \nlesson from the pain and try to rework the design such that it was \npossible. Then I might write a unit/integration test one layer removed \nto get confident about the asynchronous aspects, if I feared it might break.\n\nDo whatever gives you confidence and simply call it a test.\n\nMike\n\n\n",
