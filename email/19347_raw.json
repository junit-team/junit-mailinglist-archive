For example, I find that people who disagree with my\nconvictions\n&gt; call me dogmatic, and I find that to be a cop-out on their part. I\nwould\n&gt; find it easier to take your ideas seriously if you didn&#39;t pose them as\n&gt; being against some nonexistent testing dogma.\n&gt; --\n&gt; J. B. (Joe) Rainsberger :: http://www.jbrains.ca\n&gt; Your guide to software craftsmanship\n&gt; JUnit Recipes: Practical Methods for Programmer Testing\n&gt; 2005 Gordon Pask Award for contribution Agile Software Practice\n&gt;\n\nHi J.B.,\n\nIn my mind, I&#39;ve never associated you with unit testing dogma - quite\nthe contrary.\n\nI chose my words very, VERY, carefully when talking about unit testing\ndogma, and the word is used only in the subtitle and one epigram.  I\nchose the words carefully because I believe that *some* dogma is\nnecessary - one has to have a basic position, some ground on which to\nstand - hence the phrase &quot;LESS unit testing dogma&quot; as opposed to &quot;NO\nunit testing dogma.&quot;\n\nTestivus itself can be seen as dogmatic in a few places.  For example,\n&quot;If you write code write tests&quot;, is not exactly wishy-washy about the\nfact that developers should test.  Here&#39;s the text:\n\n--- Testivus snippet ---\n\nIf you write code, write tests\n====================\n\nThe pupil asked the master programmer:\n\n     &quot;When can I stop writing tests?&quot;\n\nThe master answered:\n\n     &quot;When you stop writing code.&quot;\n\nThe pupil asked:\n\n     &quot;When do I stop writing code?&quot;\n\nThe master answered:\n\n     &quot;When you become a manager.&quot;\n\nThe pupil trembled and asked:\n\n     &quot;When do I become a manager?&quot;\n\nThe master answered:\n\n     &quot;When you stop writing tests.&quot;\n\nThe pupil rushed to write some tests. He left skid marks.\n\nIf the code deserves to be written, it deserves to have tests.\n\n--- end of Testivus snippet ---\n\nThe epigram &quot;Don&#39;t get stuck on unit testing dogma&quot; is aimed as much at\nTestivus as it is to anything else, and the key part of the sentence is\n&quot;Don&#39;t get STUCK&quot;, don&#39;t let blind following of dogma kill your\ncreativity or your flexibility.\n\nI hope this clarifies things somewhat.\n\nAlberto\n\n\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
