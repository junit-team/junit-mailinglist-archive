The first time this happened, I\nneeded to insert the current date and time into a column in a database\ntable. I didn&#39;t need much accuracy, and wanted to save some space in\na multi-million row table, so I was using an MS SQL server date type\nthat was smaller (4 bytes instead of eight, I recall) but accurate only\ndown to several seconds. So at any particular point, if I inserted\nthe current time, the time coming back out of the database would be\ndifferent than what I&#39;d inserted, though always certainly less than a\nminute or so different.\n\nSo what I did was create a separate DateAssertion object that took,\nin the constructor, a parameter saying just how different the two Date\nobjects could be and still be &quot;equal&quot; for my purposes. Then I&#39;d invoke\nthe DateAssertion&#39;s assert() method.\n\nIt seems to me one could just as well make a StringAssertion object that\none could set up with appropriate parameters so that you&#39;d get output,\nwhen an assertion fails, that&#39;s more appropriate for your particular\ncircumstance.\n\nThat led me to start thinking about whether it might not be cleaner and\nsimpler, overall, to completely separate the assertion code from the test\ncases by using separate assertion objects for everything.\n\ncjs\n-- \nCurt Sampson  &lt;cjs@...&gt;   +81 90 7737 2974   http://www.netbsd.org\n    Don&#39;t you know, in this new Dark Age, we&#39;re all light.  --XTC\n\n",
