The class that has the setter\nmethod taking a Collection of string email addresses does have a\ngetter method returning an array of InternetAddresses... looks like i\nmay have to pop open all the cans and actually see whats inside\neach... i was hoping to find something much easier... :-)\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Wed, 26 Jan 2005 16:18:30 -0800, Kevin Klinemeier &lt;zipwow@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Simple, snide answer:  Test your expectations of the results.\n&gt; \n&gt; You mention that the method in question makes some validations.  After\n&gt; calling the setter, make your assertions about the exceptions, error\n&gt; codes, or whatever it is you&#39;re returning if the validation fails. \n&gt; You may have known that part already.\n&gt; \n&gt; So how do you test the objects created when validation passes?  You&#39;ve\n&gt; got black-box and white-box approaches.  I prefer black-box as a first\n&gt; try, but that&#39;s mostly because I write the tests first, so the code is\n&gt; really more of an empty box :P\n&gt; \n&gt; To do this black-box-style, look to the other access points to your\n&gt; class.  You mention that the private collection is full of\n&gt; InternetAddress objects.  Does your class communicate these to a mail\n&gt; broker object?  Can you pass in a mock implementation of that object\n&gt; that records what it&#39;s been told?  Here&#39;s a pseudocode example:\n&gt; \n&gt; MockCommunicationsBroker broker = new MockCommunicationsBroker();\n&gt; MailSender mailSender = new MailSender(broker); //class under test --\n&gt; given the mock broker\n&gt; \n&gt; Collection goodValues = getGoodValues();//however you get your test data\n&gt; mailSender.setRecipients(goodValues);\n&gt; mailSender.send();  //presumably interacts with the broker\n&gt; \n&gt; Collection generatedRecipients = broker.getRecipients();\n&gt; assertEquals(&quot;Wrong recipients&quot;,expectedValues,generatedRecipients); \n&gt; //hand converted expected values that match the input to the setter\n&gt; \n&gt; A white-box approach would be to make your private collection\n&gt; protected or use reflection and a lax security profile to &quot;reach\n&gt; inside&quot; and access them directly.  Not as useful for refactoring, and\n&gt; a little less &quot;pure&quot;, but easier to implement.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Kevin\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Wed, 26 Jan 2005 14:39:00 -0500, Soaring Eagle\n&gt; &lt;comfortable.numb@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hello,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Please bear with me if this is an old oft answered question.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I have a void method which takes in a java.util.Collection parameter -\n&gt; &gt; filled with Strings, performs some validations and sets a private\n&gt; &gt; member that is also a collection - filled with\n&gt; &gt; javax.mail.InternetAddress.
