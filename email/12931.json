For the time being I went<br/>\n&gt; with the simplest thing that works, i.e., stuffing the script file&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; entire contents into Statement#execute().<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>A couple of the things you get from the Ant code that you don&#39;t get from <br/>\npassing the whole thing to Statement.execute() are:<br/>\n<br/>\n- Ability to continue on error, even if one (or more) of the statements <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t execute properly<br/>\n<br/>\n- Ability to have comments in your script starting with &quot;//&quot; or &quot;--&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n- More flexibility with delimiters (EOL or ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n- Good logging to let you know which statements had problems<br/>\n<br/>\n- Control over when the commit happens<br/>\n<br/>\nWith the DDL files we have these things were enough to tip the boat against <br/>\n&quot;rolling our own&quot;.  Rather than writing a wrapper around <br/>\norg.apache.tools.ant.taskdefs.SQLExec, we copied & modified the source (as I <br/>\nindicated in my message yesterday), so that we didn&#39;t have to include a <br/>\nbunch of ant jars in our test classpath.<br/>\n<br/>\nJeff Nielsen<br/>\nDigital Focus</div>",
