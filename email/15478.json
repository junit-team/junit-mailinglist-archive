Though it can be easily reproduced with mocks... but of <br/>\ncourse not for static methods. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n   Using DFA (like it is done in Agitator) allows to have sort of <br/>\nshortcut that reduces number of hardly possible branches.

But for an exception throwing language there is other<br/>\n&gt;&gt; possible &quot;paths&quot; that are triggered by behavior of the called<br/>\n&gt;&gt; code.  Consider:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;&gt; public static void int parse (String s) {<br/>\n&gt;&gt;   return Integer.parseInt(s);<br/>\n&gt;&gt; }<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; Classically this has exactly one code path and gets 100% coverage<br/>\n&gt;&gt; if you pass in &quot;1234&quot; but behaviorally it has two paths because<br/>\n&gt;&gt; parseInt can throw an exception.  So ... you really need &quot;data<br/>\n&gt;&gt; coverage&quot; which is a nebulous concept to measure at best.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; Kent </span></blockquote></div>",
