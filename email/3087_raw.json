I am fine till that part as I am able to call the \n&gt; appropriate test case entered by the user and am able to display the \n&gt; results on the browser.  \n&gt; \n&gt; What I also need is that, is there a way to determine and print what \n&gt; test case methods are being run.  As in case of the swingui \n&gt; (junit.swingui.TestRunner) we have the progress bar indicator that \n&gt; tells us how many test cases are run, the failures and errors and the \n&gt; stack trace.  Right now I am able to get all the results but once all \n&gt; the test cases have finished running, till then the page displayed to \n&gt; the user is blank.  Is there anyway to dynamically show which method \n&gt; in the test case is running and whether its a failure or error or \n&gt; success.  Please let me know.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Sri\n\nSri,\n\nSure this is possible.  But you are limited here by things extraneous to JUnit.\n For instance, the success of the dynamic updating (i.e. the client seeing it\nin realtime) is going to depend on the speed of both the webserver and the\nbrowser.  So, you may never really reach a realtime effect in the browser. \nHowever, I suspect that this will generally be run in a business environment,\nso the speeds of the machines should be sufficient enough to _simulate_\nrealtime.\n\nTo dynamically update a page requires that you have a little more magic than\nnormal going on.  There will of necessity be some software on the client side\nthat will cause the client&#39;s browser to &quot;continuously&quot; reload.  You can feed\npages up to the server until your heart is content, but if the client never\nrequests them, it does no good.  I am not sure whether you can accomplish this\nthrough an applet, having never used them.  It seems to me that you could write\nsome script or a servlet to update every 5 seconds or so, or you could just do\nthis in the HTML (which is not so clean).\n\nAll of that being said, is it really necessary to to have this kind of\ninterface?  What&#39;s the motive?  Are the tests running on a server that you want\nall clients to be able to see?\n\n-jason\n\n=====\nJason Rogers\n[mailto: jacaetev@...]\n------------------------------\nKeep it simple...\n(1 Corinthians 2:2, Galatians 2:20, 6:14)\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nMake a great connection at Yahoo!
