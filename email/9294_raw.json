I don&#39;t have much trouble in\nwriting tests for new code for existing apps, but can&#39;t seem to get my\nhead around test-first from the ground up on a new app.\n\nAs an example, I recently wrote a small utility that views the header\ninfo of an mp3, and renames the file from the information contained\ntherein.  You pass it (on the command line) the name of a directory or\nfile, and a &#39;template&#39; which includes the format of the name it should\ngenerate.  If a file is passed, it renames the file.  If a directory is\npassed, it recursively renames all files in the directory.  An example\nname template would be something like &quot;%b - %n&quot; for &quot;Artist - Track\nTitle&quot;.\n\nI actually got halfway finished with it, then deleted all of my code,\nsince I hadn&#39;t done it test-first, but then couldn&#39;t think how to go\nabout testing it.  I&#39;m using an external lib (jd3lib) for reading mp3\nheader info, and the standard java.io stuff for file manipulation.\nEvery test I can think of would just test external code (reading mpeg\nheader info, file renaming, etc), so I&#39;m somewhat at a loss.  Is there\nanyone out there who&#39;d like to get me started with a couple tests?\n\nThanx much,\nBRiaN\n\n\n\n",
