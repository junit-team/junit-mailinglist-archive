If it&#39;s 1 test, then just write the loop in your test.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hi J.B.,\n&gt; As I mentioned, I have a TestSuite, which is having more than 1\n&gt; TestCases.\n&gt; Thus I can put them in the loop.\n\nI meant a different question. Let me try again.\n\nWhen you repeat your test code n times, do you want JUnit to report the \nentire thing as 1 test or n tests?\n\n&gt;  &gt;Either use RepeatedTestCase (part of JUnit) or build the repeated\ntest\n&gt;  &gt;suite by hand.\n&gt; \n&gt; I am looking at RepeatedTestCase now.\n&gt; Can you put more light on how can I do the same thing with any other\n&gt; way.\n\nThat depends on your answer to my clarified question above. If you want \nthe entire thing to be reported as 1 test, then just put the loop in \nyour test method. If you want the entire thing to be reported as n \ntests, then use RepeatedTestCase.\n\n&gt; I mean if I could modify the TestRunner or some other logic which can\nbe\n&gt; implemented in the TestSuite itself.\n\nEntirely in the TestSuite, just as RepeatedTestCase does.\n-- \nJ.
