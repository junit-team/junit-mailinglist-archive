Here are my experiences:\n\n- have a driving force, e.g. you. Prepare to do legwork, convince people, \nand help them with JUnit\n- get management/QA support. Not just superficial one, but prepare them to \nmake tradeoffs when it comes to hard deadlines and still support you\n- if possible, work ahead towards the hard questions: how can I get a \npersistent data setup? How to clean it up and make tests independent?\n- start small, obviously, and incrementally build up your test base. If \nthere are old tests, work with people to convert them to JUnit tests\n- a big plus of JUnit is that you have single starting point to run all \ntests from, your root AllTests. That is a big selling point.\n- embedd it into the dev process: noone releases anything without having \nrunning tests (of course it doesn&#39;t work fully, but you get the idea)\n- have release engineering provide managers with feedback from daily builds \nand test runs about system quality state\n\nAt Skyva, I got a dedicated QA person to help implement JUnit support, but \nonly after I had gone already an initial mile. Typically, QA is your \nfriend. I hope QA in your place cooperates rather than fights development.\n\nThere is more, but I can&#39;t think of it right now.\n\nGood luck,\nDirk\n\n\n\nAt 04:15 PM 3/16/2001 -0800, Kevin Bourrillion wrote:\n&gt;Hi David,\n&gt;\n&gt;My preference would be to never grind development to a halt.  But, I would \n&gt;be aggressive about writing tests for all new development and all bug \n&gt;fixes.  Once your team is in this habit for a while you&#39;ll be well on your \n&gt;way.  Periodically you might use a code coverage tool to identify gaping \n&gt;holes in your testing and schedule a couple of person-days to plug them \n&gt;up.  Another way to prioritize new test development for old code is to ask \n&gt;yourselves &quot;what are we most concerned will break?&quot; and then test that.\n&gt;\n&gt;You&#39;ll never have a &quot;fully tested product&quot; -- I don&#39;t believe there is \n&gt;such a thing.  There will always be many more tests that could be there, \n&gt;no matter how many you write.

We have a significant code \n&gt;base already and we&#39;re trying to move to JUnit.  What issues did you have \n&gt;when trying this yourself?  Was your testing hierarchy exactly the same as \n&gt;your application package structure?  Did you start only using JUnit with \n&gt;new development or with bugs as well?  Or did you take a month off and \n&gt;have everyone write JUnit tests?  Any help would be greatly appreciated.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;-dmg\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt;junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;Your use of Yahoo!
