Google&#39;s a hotbed of the sort of programmers who like to read \n&gt;and write books about OO theory and language design. But most of the \n&gt;world is not Google.\n&gt;\n&gt;There are certainly widely promulgated recommendations to use \n&gt;interfaces. I&#39;m not sure these recommendations are actually accepted by \n&gt;anyone except the people promulgating them, though. In particular, what \n&gt;I see is a lot of relatively smart people quietly blaming themselves for \n&gt;not understanding the complexity that&#39;s being foisted on them, and \n&gt;thinking they must be stupid for not understanding it. They may use \n&gt;interfaces when forced to do so by the frameworks, but they don&#39;t like \n&gt;it; and they certainly don&#39;t make it the first choice in their own code.\n&gt;\n&gt;Interfaces have their place, but that place has been vastly overdrawn in \n&gt;the Java world. Most classes simply do not need more than one \n&gt;implementation.\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nUnless you&#39;re testing.\n\n\n\n",
