I\n&gt; &gt; haven&#39;t had a chance to really play with it, but might -- it\n&gt; looks like it\n&gt; &gt; could have some nice stuff.  (I&#39;m not sure whether I&#39;d use the major\n&gt; &gt; functionality of access to restricted classes and members or\n&gt; not, though.)\n&gt; &gt; Does it work with JDK 1.1?\n&gt;\n&gt; I started JUnitX after reading the Refactoring-book of Martin Fowler.\n&gt; During my vacation I had real fun refactoring JUnit and afterwards I\n&gt; have been curious how it would be possible to access private methods,\n&gt; classes and attributes across packages. So I had to extend JUnit in\n&gt; many aspects. Also the Swing GUI required more clicks than I liked to\n&gt; access the tree of tests. So I reworked the Swing and Text UIs.\n&gt;\n&gt; Now it is a challenge to submit the changes to JUnit. I hope that JUnit\n&gt; soon gives me the opportunity to give my best changes to it after\n&gt; having somebody reviewing them. So I am sad that it is a branch\n&gt; development. But I will definitely support _all_ JUnit features in\n&gt; the JUnitX versions until everything has been merged sufficiently.\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt;\n&gt; Andreas.\n\nJUnit should have an open source host soon.\n\n--\nErik Meade             emeade@...\nSenior Consultant      Object Mentor, Inc.\nhttp://www.junit.org\n\n\n",
