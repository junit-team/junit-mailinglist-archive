However, for commercial software development, is this\n&gt; still possible ?\n\n\nDefinitely - my team has been doing it for 5+ years, over several projects\nspanning several languages. Our products while not bug free have fewer than\nmany I&#39;ve known along the way. As developers of desktop GUI applications\n(Swing/Eclipse SWT/WinForms .NET) - its a bit more difficult to test some of\nour code - but none the less our overall test coverage has been around 65%.\nIn the end I think it takes us less time not more to develop our products\nwriting tests. That said a few members of the team still need proding to\nwrite their test cases.\n\n* One intersting point I found is that after Junit-based testing is\n&gt; introduced, programmers tend to use IDE debugger much less than\n&gt; before.  This would save lots of time. Is that true ?\n\n\nYes very true - in fact when bugs show up in our GUI code I usually try to\nwrite a test case to replicate them. When I have to debug its much faster to\ndebug from a test case than clicking around in the GUI.\n\n* Some guys say JUnit is good for biz / util code testing. But for web\n&gt; application development, where HTML/javascript would be root cause of\n&gt; lots of bugs, Junit is not so powerful. Any comments ?\n\n\nLots of people do this sort of testing FIT (http://fit.c2.com/) or similiar\nframeworks. I don&#39;t know much about it since I&#39;ve never done javascript.\n\n* How can I convince managers and programmers that JUnit-based is\n&gt; really possible for commercial software development ? Any differnece\n&gt; from open-source projects ?\n\n\nShow them the number of replies on this list? Also start writing tests in\nyou&#39;re own corner of the world. Integrate them into your build. Give a short\nlive demo at lunch. Bring you&#39;re co-workers in for some pair programming,\n.....\n\n\nCheers\nMark Levison\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nBlog: http://dotnetjunkies.com/WebLog/mlevison/\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
