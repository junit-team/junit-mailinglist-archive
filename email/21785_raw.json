You can stub almost anything. If i=\r\nt is not possible to stub classes wrap them. This can happen if you work wi=\r\nth a class that is declared final.=A0  \nMy one advice would be not to actua=\r\nlly create a server connection for unit tests. Your tests are supposed to b=\r\ne simple. Try to create Fake server connection and pass them across. \n\nUnit=\r\n testing and refactoring should go hand in hand. If something is stopping y=\r\nou from unit testing, it would be a good time to start throwing away someth=\r\ning. There is a problem here too. To ensure your refactoring is right you s=\r\nhould have unit tests but then that is the purpose why you started refactor=\r\ning. This is a chicken and egg problem. So start refactoring in small steps=\r\n.=A0 \n\nThere are some good articles in developerWorks featuring Unit testin=\r\ng. I have read the reviews of a book called &quot;Working Effectively with Legac=\r\ny Code&quot;(http://www.amazon.com/Working-Effectively-Legacy-Robert-Martin/dp/0=\r\n131177052/ref=3Dpd_bxgy_b_img_a) which seems to be useful. I did not get my=\r\n hands yet on this book.\n\nI would suggest getting some hands on this book a=\r\nnd something like this or taking a short training on agile training.\n\nregar=\r\nds,\nSuresh =A0 \n\n--- On Mon, 6/29/09, Bradley, Todd &lt;todd.bradley@polycom.c=\r\nom&gt; wrote:\n\nFrom: Bradley, Todd &lt;todd.bradley@...&gt;\nSubject: RE: [ju=\r\nnit] unit testing clinet server applications?\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nDat=\r\ne: Monday, June 29, 2009, 9:57 AM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n            \n            =\r\n\n\n\n      \n      Is your application designed in such a way that you can tes=\r\nt your code\n\nwithout starting another process (for your server)?
