If there can only be one rule, then I could extend external resource except that its apply method is final. I could make a combination rule and get around the problem, it is just starting to get a bit ugly.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;yme0987654321&quot; &lt;yme0987654321@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; That should be doable. I&#39;ll confirm. Probably better than the @Before given that I need inheritance anyway.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In the mean time, I had put an assumeThat on the @Before method, and that worked fine (subclasses call super and redeclare the annotation, so all is well). However, for the @After method, the assumeThat method just makes the test fail. I guess it was somewhat surprising that the teardown is run even if the setup fails an assumeThat assumption, but I can certainly understand that. But why not tollerate an assumeThat in teardown? I agree it is somewhat strange that you already ran the test and still want to assume it away, but I would still think that assume should stop a test at all three levels (@Before, the test and @After). What do you think?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, David Saff &lt;david@&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; That&#39;s right: Rules can affect the processing after @Before and before<br/>\n&gt; &gt; @After.

What happens is that I have a custom runner that suppresses the test (these are slow tests, so they are only run at check-in, not by the developer while developing).<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; However, when I replace that with a Rule, the setup method is still run (looks slow). So I guess the conclusion is that @Rule can&#39;t interrupt or override the setup and teardown process, so if you need to do that you are back to a Runner? (Or making your own setups rule-aware I guess).<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, David Saff &lt;david@&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Yishai,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; I just ran a test, and the Rules in the superclass were picked up.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Can you post a small example?  Thanks,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;    David Saff<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; On Thu, Aug 20, 2009 at 10:21 AM, David Saff&lt;david@&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Yishai,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Sounds like a bug.  Can you file it at github?  Sorry for the oversight,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;   David Saff<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; On Wed, Aug 19, 2009 at 8:26 PM, yme0987654321&lt;yme0987654321@&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I&#39;m looking at the new Rule annotation in JUnit4.
