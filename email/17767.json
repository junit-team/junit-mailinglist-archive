It&#39;s particularly bad when talking <br/>\n&gt;&gt;about error handling and recovery because there is no one right approach <br/>\n&gt;&gt;there.  Some systems have to be up all of the time and fail fast <br/>\n&gt;&gt;wouldn&#39;t fly.  Jim outlines a great strategy in that article for the <br/>\n&gt;&gt;cases where it&#39;s appropriate.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;    <br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;That doesn&#39;t really change anything. If you can&#39;t even afford to throw <br/>\n&gt;an exception, then you certainly can&#39;t afford to allow <br/>\n&gt;precondition-violating arguments, and then let the system do whatever <br/>\n&gt;random thing it happens to do. Precondition verification is more <br/>\n&gt;important in systems that have to be up all the time, not less. Maybe <br/>\n&gt;there are systems in which you silently reject the bad arguments, or log <br/>\n&gt;an error message rather than throwing an exception. However no way <br/>\n&gt;should you let bad data into such a critical system and just throw up <br/>\n&gt;your hands and say you&#39;re not responsible for what happens when a client <br/>\n&gt;violates your precondition.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It changes your approach to design.  You do what you can to actively <br/>\nminimize and eliminate preconditions; you end up patching things up and <br/>\nproducing special case objects.  Actually, it looks less like <br/>\nprecondition checking and more like designing alternative courses. <br/>\n<br/>\nMichael Feathers<br/>\nwww.objectmentor.com</div>",
