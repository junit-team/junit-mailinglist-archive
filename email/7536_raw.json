They are hacks designed to increase performance and work around the obvious limitations and faulty intentions of J2EE.\n&gt;\n&gt;Session facade is not a &quot;pattern&quot; in the sense of &quot;improves design&quot;. It is a hack that gets around the fact that J2EE tries to hide RMI from the programmer. If we didn&#39;t have to worry about remote objects, then how would we design it? I don&#39;t think we&#39;d arrive at these implementation idioms/hacks if it weren&#39;t for working around either remote objects or a persistence mechanism that tries to call &quot;save&quot; for every method call.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\nIMO, it&#39;s a pattern in the sense that it is a common solution to a \nreoccurring problem in distributed computing.  By naming it, we \nestablish a common vocabulary for recognizing and debating the problem. \n Moreover, I believe session facade does improve design.  It decouples \nremote clients from persistent objects, perhaps modeled as entity beans, \nand encapsulates business logic in a cohesive location.  That is, it&#39;s a \nlayering technique to separate concerns and manage dependencies.  \n\nOne person&#39;s pattern is another person&#39;s hack.\n\nMike\n\n-- \nMike Clark\nhttp://clarkware.com\n(303) 589-3812\n\n\n\n\n",
