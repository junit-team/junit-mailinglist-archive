I&#39;ve been\ncurious about this tool for a while, but have yet to\nuse it myself on a real project.\n\n--- Cédric Beust ♔  &lt;cbeust@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; On 9/4/06, Elliotte Harold &lt;elharo@...&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yes, I do have a copy. I suspect you&#39;re referring\n&gt; to p. 343-344. However\n&gt; &gt; you have to remember that Meyer is writing about a\n&gt; language in which\n&gt; &gt; preconditions can be specified *and enforced*\n&gt; outside the body of the\n&gt; &gt; method. Since Java, unlike Eiffel, does not\n&gt; provide extra-method\n&gt; &gt; preconditions it is therefore necessary to place\n&gt; the verification code\n&gt; &gt; in the method body. It&#39;s not ideal, but Java is\n&gt; not an ideal language.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Furthermore, for most cases, Meyer recommends\n&gt; precondition verification\n&gt; &gt; by default. See pp. 394-398\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I am really not convinced that Meyer&#39;s approach, and\n&gt; Design by Contract in\n&gt; general, is really relevant to the real world.  I\n&gt; blogged about it a few\n&gt; years ago here\n&gt; &lt;http://www.jroller.com/page/cbeust/20021213&gt;, and\n&gt; my\n&gt; conclusion was that preconditions, post-conditions\n&gt; and invariants were\n&gt; usually either one of these:\n&gt; \n&gt;    - Super simple, and better put in an assert.\n&gt;    - Super complex, and better left to testing.\n&gt; \n&gt; I also noticed that most of the methods that I write\n&gt; simply don&#39;t have any\n&gt; invariant that can be easily expressed, so I have\n&gt; yet to see a convincing\n&gt; example of Design by Contract on a project of more\n&gt; than a few thousands of\n&gt; lines...  (incidentally, most of the Eiffel code\n&gt; that I worked with and read\n&gt; was pretty bad and wouldn&#39;t pass today&#39;s standards).\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; C�dric\n&gt; http://testng.org\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been\n&gt; removed]\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
