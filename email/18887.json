I think that when I was in school <br/>\nthere was this unspoken assumption that, well, to write code you have to <br/>\nbe smart and if you&#39;re smart you&#39;ll be able to keep the whole system in <br/>\nyour head anyway -- using tests as change detectors would be seen as a <br/>\nsign of weakness. I guess it doesn&#39;t help either that it took a while to <br/>\nmake rapid builds possible also. We had to get past batch processing, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I hope that the encapsulation balance changes. I&#39;ve been doing a <br/>\nlot thinking on it recently and I&#39;ll be presenting a session called &#39;API <br/>\nDesign As If Unit Testing Mattered&#39; at SDWest and SPA2007. It&#39;s really <br/>\nall about the fact that it&#39;s obvious that most commercial API designers <br/>\nhaven&#39;t thought about how to make it possible to write unit tests for <br/>\ncode that uses their APIs. I&#39;m going to show some glaring examples in <br/>\nJava, C++, and C#, and talk about some alternatives.<br/>\n<br/>\nMichael Feathers<br/>\nwww.objectmentor.com<br/>\n<br/>\nCédric Beust ♔ wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;&gt;The emphasis on testing has only received more visibility in the past<br/>\n&gt;&gt;five years, and some of its principles are indeed at odds with some of<br/>\n&gt;&gt;the OO knowledge that has been pervading the software industry for two<br/>\n&gt;&gt;decades now.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;After being told repeatedly that encapsulation was paramount to<br/>\n&gt;&gt;software quality, it&#39;s not always easy to let this go in favor of<br/>\n&gt;&gt;another technique, but I think the message is getting through and that<br/>\n&gt;&gt;more and more developers are becoming more aware of the pros and cons<br/>\n&gt;&gt;between &quot;extreme OO&quot; and &quot;pragmatic testing&quot;.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;In hindsight, I am absolutely shocked that all the teachers I had in<br/>\n&gt;&gt;school 20+ years ago that I had so much respect for had absolutely no<br/>\n&gt;&gt;inclination (and sometimes only contempt) for testing...<br/>\n&gt;&gt;    <br/>\n&gt;&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
