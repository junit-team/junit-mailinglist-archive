    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1818890803\">One possibility is using assertions within your code, not the test. It all<br/>\ndepends on what the code actually does. If you can find a deterministic way<br/>\nto check (inside the loop) that the loop itself has been going on for &quot;too<br/>\nlong&quot;, or that it didn&#39;t meet an expected boundary condition, then you can<br/>\njust assert against that. The next JDK will support assertions, but I wrote<br/>\nmy own simple assertion classes. If an assertion fails, it throws a<br/>\nRuntimeException. Then you can just check for that exception within your<br/>\nunit test.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, asserting continuously might slow down your loop. Also, some<br/>\nmight argue against &quot;polluting the code with the tests&quot;, but I don&#39;t really<br/>\ncare about that - I use assertions everywhere, both as a &quot;permanent test&quot; in<br/>\nproduction code and to better communicate my intentions.<br/>\n<br/>\n    ---------------<br/>\n    Paolo Perrotta<br/>\n    Bologna, Italy</div>",
