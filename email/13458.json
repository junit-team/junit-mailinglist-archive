    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1128293569\">Hi, I was just chatting with Mike Clark about my desire to save<br/>\nhistorical test JUnit results, and to have a way to generate a graph<br/>\nfrom them.  I&#39;m imagining an ant target that would automatically build a<br/>\nbar chart that shows the progress of test results over the course of a<br/>\nproject.  The X axis would be time, maybe in 1 week increments.  The Y<br/>\naxis would be number of tests.  And I&#39;d have a stacked bar for each week<br/>\nto show the total tests executed, broken down into pass/fail/error.<br/>\nThat way, management could look at the chart and see our progress on the<br/>\nproject from the perspective of tests (whether it&#39;s unit tests or system<br/>\ntests that use JUnit) and feel happy.  Later I might even add in code<br/>\ncoverage percentages for even more juicy goodness.<br/>\n<br/>\nHas anyone else put something like this together?  Mike mentioned he&#39;s<br/>\nheard of others who want to build such a results graphing tool, but<br/>\ndidn&#39;t know if anyone&#39;s got one they&#39;re sharing.  So I&#39;m posting here,<br/>\nlooking for pointers.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance,<br/>\nTodd.<br/>\n----<br/>\nTodd Bradley - Polycom - QA Lead, Super Secret Project<br/>\n<br/>\nVisit me at my WebOffice for IM and app sharing:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.polycomweboffice.com/todd.bradley@...\">http://www.polycomweboffice.com/todd.bradley@...</a></div>",
