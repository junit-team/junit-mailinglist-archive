People will always distrust the &quot;the code passes all my\ntests therefore it&#39;s clean&quot; line because they won&#39;t trust me to write\nrigourous tests to find fault with my code.   And of course they&#39;re right:\nnot because I&#39;m untrustworthy, merely sometimes overconfident about my code.\nThat&#39;s why we need QA bods to test our code.\n\nIn your situation maybe you could adapt the XP Pair-programming technique so\nthat you have a developer and a QA-er writing test suites together.  The QA\ngains visibility of the tests, the developer has an objective set of tests\nthat they have to get green.  \n\nAlthough I don&#39;t hold out much hope: I&#39;ve tried to interest people here in\n&quot;Pair programming&quot; and you would have thought I proposing something dirty -\nin fact I would probably have got less of an adverse reaction if I *had*\nproposed something dirty ;P  \n\nStill, it might be worth your while to try.  \n\nI&#39;ve though some more about your problem and logging test failures into\nBugzilla (or whatever) is a non-starter.  Consider: new bug logged every\ntime you run the same test and it fails; you have to associate a test with a\nbug number; once a test passes JUnit has to search the database and update\nthe bug report.\n\nIf you want something that&#39;s more generally usable you might want to\nconsider something like Silvermark&#39;s TestMentor which comes with lots of\ngraphical goodies and reports :) but isn&#39;t free :(\n\nrgds, APC  \n\nA P Clarke \nConsultant\nCMG Admiral UK - Radio Spectrum International\nWyndham House \n189 Marsh Wall\nLondon \nE14 9SH\nTel: +44 (0)20 7211 0603\nFax: +44 (0)20 7211 0364\nMobile:-----------------------\nInternet communications are not secure and therefore CMG UK Ltd does not\naccept legal responsibility for the contents of this message.

There is a fair argument that they don&#39;t need to know, that\nis the beauty...\nThanks for the long response!\nAlan.\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Andrew Clarke [mailto:andrew.clarke@...]\nSent: 19 November 2001 14:12\nTo: &#39;junit@yahoogroups.com&#39;\nSubject: RE: [junit] Integration between JUnit and bug tracker?\n\n\nForgive me, but isn&#39;t this rather contrary to the spirit of JUnit and\nits\nTestInfected/XP approach?  Kent says we&#39;re supposed to cycle through the\ntesting and coding stages a few times until our code has no bugs.  So\nwhat\nis there to track?  same goes for integration: providing we&#39;re\ndeveloping in\nsmall enough chunks, of course.\n\nOr look at it another way: our failed tests are their own bug\ntrackingdevice.\n\nAutomatically populating a bug track database from failed tests would\nonly\nmake sense when the people running the tests aren&#39;t the same people who\nare\ndeveloping the code, for instance users in UAT or a &quot;black box&quot; testing\ncell.  I don&#39;t think JUnit is sufficiently abstract for the former but I\ncan\nsee that the latter could be writing their own JUnit suites (if they\nknow\nJava).  In which case your question is simply a variant on the &quot;How do I\nlog\noutput from JUnit?&quot; question, only instead of writing to a logfile you\nwant\nto insert the results into an error tracking database.  How difficult\nthat\nis depends on the database in question: if it&#39;s something proprietary\nlike\nMerant Tracker I imagine there&#39;ll be a few more problems than if (like\nus)\nyou&#39;re using a homebrew system based on tables sitting in your\ndevelopment\nOracle DB.  The Bugzilla FAQ does say we write to the database using the\nMozilla XML API so it would be possible to do, but I think you&#39;ll be\nlucky\nto find anyone who&#39;s actually done it :P  \n\nrgds, APC \n\nA P Clarke \nConsultant\nCMG Admiral UK - Radio Spectrum International\nWyndham House \n189 Marsh Wall\nLondon \nE14 9SH\nTel: +44 (0)20 7211 0603\nFax: +44 (0)20 7211 0364\nMobile:-----------------------\nInternet communications are not secure and therefore CMG UK Ltd does not\naccept legal responsibility for the contents of this message.
