Is there an assertTrue(String) method?)\n\nYour call to fail(...) says that the method must throw an \nIllegalArgumentException when passed a null pointer.  \n\nThat is _not_ the same as saying that the caller must not pass in\nnull.\n\n\nIn your case, a caller is allowed to use the method to detect null \npointers.  \n\nIn my case, a caller cannot expect any particular behavior.  (Maybe the \nmethod throws IllegalArgumentException.  Maybe it returns a bogus result.\nMaybe it gets stuck in an endless loop.  Maybe it makes something else\nfail 10000 calls later in another method.  Maybe it crashes the VM (via \nJNI).)\n\n\n\n&gt; &gt; You can&#39;t test for any particular behavior from the callee\n&gt; &gt; if the callee&#39;s behavior in the face of a null pointer is \n&gt; &gt; intentially left undefined (e.g., for flexibility in \n&gt; &gt; implementing an interface).)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; The callee is the class being tested, the specifics for different\n&gt; implementations could be implemented\n&gt; in specific TestCases, \n\nWhy test for behavior that is (intentionally) undefined?\n\nConsider a method that is defined to return &quot;an instance of some \nclass implementing interface I.&quot;  In that specification, the\nparticular class is undefined.\n\nIf your implementation currently uses a class C, why test that \nthe returned instance is of class C?  Why constrain yourself from\nreturning an instance of class D, as long as you still return\n&quot;an instance of some class implementing interface I&quot;?\n\nIf you test for class C and treat tests as documentation, then \nthat implies that a caller is allowed to depend on the fact that \nyou return class C.  That is usually _not_ at all what you want.\n\n\n\n&gt; &gt; (How can a test show that a caller is responsible for not\n&gt; &gt; depending on certain current behavior of an implementation\n&gt; &gt; that is not part of the interface contract?)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; It can&#39;t, the caller&#39;s TestCase should do that. And possibly \n\nWhat caller?  That is, no caller necessarily even exists yet. \nSo no, the caller&#39;s test case cannot do that.  \n\n(And how could a test case for a caller detect whether that \ncaller passes a null pointer to the called method?)\n\n\n&gt; the callee&#39;s\n&gt; documentation.\n\nEXACTLY--documentation, not just tests!!!\n\n\n\n&gt; &gt; Because tests, being code, can&#39;t relate code to external concepts.  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; (A specification can say that a function f returns the mathematical\n&gt; &gt; sum of two given integers subject to the limitations of 32-bit\n&gt; &gt; signed binary arithmetic.  How can a test say something like that?)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \ttry{\n&gt; \t    int result = instance.f(Integer.MAX_VALUE, \n&gt; Integer.MAX_VALUE);\n&gt; \t    fail(&quot;f should throw Exception when integer limits \n&gt; are met&quot;);\n&gt; \t}catch(IllegalStateException e){\n&gt; \t    assertTrue(&quot;function f returns the mathematical sum \n&gt; of two given\n&gt; integers subject to the limitations of 32-bit&quot;);\n\nHmm.  I thought you were talking about having the test logic/behavior\ndefine the method behavior.\n\nYou can stick documentation text in the test case code, but I don&#39;t\nthink that changes the fact that it&#39;s human-parsed documentation.\n\n\nI do grant that your example shows that documentation doesn&#39;t have to \nbe in some place separate from the tests. \n\nHey--I have an idea.  You know how Javadoc 1.4 can provide links to \nthe source?  Maybe (ideally, fantasy-land, etc.) it could provide links \nto the test case source too.\n\n\n\nDaniel\n\n\n\n\n",
