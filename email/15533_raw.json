If the system\n&gt; is really that big,=\r\n and test runs take hours, then I would immediately\n&gt; evaluate the benefits=\r\n of splitting that system into loosely coupled\n&gt; parts and evolving them in=\r\n separate source trees.\n\n\nYou can run, but you can&#39;t hide :-)\n\nEventually, =\r\nany software that becomes reasonably complex takes time testing,\nand I don&#39;=\r\nt think there is any way around that.  My experiences range from\nsmall soft=\r\nware (TestNG - 300 tests, less than 10 seconds to run them all) to\nfairly l=\r\narge ones, where functional tests takes anywhere between five and\nten hours=\r\n (yes, 5 and 10).  Using groups in such systems is invaluable.\n\nAlthough I =\r\nhave to say that for such large scale software, the hurdle is\nusually much =\r\nmore the communication between the QA and the engineering teams\nthan it is =\r\nabout test infrastructure, but every bit counts.\n\nMy hunch is that the resu=\r\nlt would be easier to manage and would have much\n&gt; faster tests, on\n&gt; the w=\r\nhole.\n\n\nAgree, that&#39;s why groups called &quot;fast&quot; and &quot;slow&quot; make much more se=\r\nnse than\n&quot;unit&quot; and &quot;functional&quot;, in my opinion.\n\nDo bear in mind how much =\r\nI&#39;m speculating. It&#39;s possible that you&#39;ve\n&gt; already considered all this an=\r\nd rejected it; but I&#39;ve simply never found\n&gt; myself in such a situation, so=\r\n I&#39;m imagining how I would deal with that\n&gt; situation if I found myself in =\r\nit.\n\n\nFair point.  It looks like in this particular case, your experience d=\r\noes not\nmatch mine and Jon&#39;s.\n\n--\nC=E9dric\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this mes=\r\nsage have been removed]\n\n\n",
