But compilation is always\n&gt;&gt; &gt; a lossy process, and the smaller the target instruction set, the more\n&gt;&gt; &gt; information you lose.  The JVM has a small instruction set.  To increment\n&gt;&gt; &gt; a variable, you put a 1 on the stack and say &quot;add&quot;.  Oh my :-(\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Why does that trouble you?\n\n&gt; Is this a real question??\n\nYes.\n\n&gt; It&#39;s just an example.  With a larger instruction set, you can increment\n&gt; variables in place, at a lower cost in terms of code size and run time.\n\n&gt; The main point is that compilation is a lossy process.  When you write\n&gt; i++ it&#39;s succinct but very clear.  The compiler translates this into\n&gt;   push variable\n&gt;   push 1\n&gt;   add\n&gt;   store variable\n&gt; While it&#39;s not impossible, it&#39;s difficult and expensive for a bytecode\n&gt; (re)compiler to sort out what&#39;s going on here and optimize back to the\n&gt; succintness of the original.  The larger the instruction set, the more\n&gt; information preserved in the bytecode, the less difficult and expensive\n&gt; the process is.\n\nOn the contrary, when it comes to the execution of the program, compilation\nis emphatically not a lossy process. If it were, then the program&#39;s\nbehavior would not be what we expect. If it is what we expect, then no\ninformation has been lost.\n\nRon Jeffries\nwww.XProgramming.com\nGet over it.  -- The Eagles\n\n\n",
