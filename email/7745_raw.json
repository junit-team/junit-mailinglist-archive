What you do with those names afterwar=\r\nd is totally up to the individual.\n\nWriting the TestListener is nothing. At=\r\ntaching the TestListener to the TestRunner may take some work. I&#39;ve never a=\r\nctually done it. I would have to look at the code.\n\nI suppose you could hav=\r\ne written your own TestRunner that instantiates the text runner, adds the l=\r\nistener, asks the text runner to run the tests, then processes the results =\r\nfrom your listener. Is this what you did? If not, then what did you do?\n\nTh=\r\nanks.\n\n&gt;So said Katie Gerg on 4/15/2003 --------------------\n&gt;I&#39;m embarrass=\r\ned to post it because I&#39;m really serious when I say I hacked\n&gt;it.  I have t=\r\no get a suite of automated tests done by the end of this week\n&gt;so I did it =\r\nwithout completely understanding junit but I knew what I wanted\n&gt;to get out=\r\n of it.  The tests I need to run are highly specialized (they&#39;re\n&gt;the same =\r\nwith different inputs).\n&gt;\n&gt;I wanted a list of test cases so I know what tes=\r\nt cases I&#39;ve run against a\n&gt;build (hey I&#39;m a qa person, I have to know what=\r\n&#39;s in there not only what\n&gt;failed - esp. from a test coverage perspective).=\r\n  I also wanted it in a\n&gt;format anyone could easily view, so I store the te=\r\nst results in a vector\n&gt;that I dump out in an html format at the end (the l=\r\nocation is hardcoded for\n&gt;now but it&#39;ll eventually come from a property fil=\r\ne).\n&gt;\n&gt;Anyway, I confronted the same issue you had with the listener so I m=\r\nade my\n&gt;own testresult object that the testcase class initializes and the l=\r\nistener\n&gt;grabs it from it.\n&gt;\n&gt;I&#39;ll send it to you but I don&#39;t think it fits=\r\n into the junit way of\n&gt;thinking.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  -----Original Message-----\n&gt;  =\r\nFrom: Jesse Marlin [mailto:jlm@...]\n&gt;  Sent: Tuesday, April 15, 200=\r\n3 03:36 PM\n&gt;  To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;  Subject: RE: [junit] Identify na=\r\nme of the TestCase\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  J.

Upload it to the file section. Get your\n&gt;name in lights.\n&gt;\n&gt;  I agr=\r\nee.  I am having a difficult time finding substantive examples,\n&gt;  and am c=\r\nurrently struggling with TestListener.  I don&#39;t understand\n&gt;  the relations=\r\nhip between a TestResult and a TestCase.  TestResult\n&gt;  actually has the ad=\r\ndListener method which I need, but I am not sure\n&gt;  what to do to get a Tes=\r\ntResult from the context of a TestCase.\n&gt;\n&gt;        Yahoo!
