By <br/>\nGUI do you mean a fat client or will a webapp suffice?  If JUnit and <br/>\nJava are not prerequisites and a thin client is sufficient, doing a <br/>\nshopping cart application in Squeak or VisualWorks with SUnit could <br/>\nprove very easy for the facilitator (something I always go for when <br/>\ndoing workshops) and you could easily morph this into a GUI app by using <br/>\nSeaside (a webapp framework).  You could even pick up some rudimentary <br/>\nideas from the Sushi Online Store sample application.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne tack I take in doing these types of workshops is to concentrate on <br/>\nunit testing skills, not language issues.  I therefore tend to choose a <br/>\nlanguage platform that is unfamiliar to the wider audience.  This helps <br/>\nthe audience to not get caught up in implementation details (eg. coding <br/>\nstyles, method names, etc.) because if it is a language they are <br/>\nunfamiliar with they will tend not to bother about those things.  YMMV<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJason Rogers<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I,<br/>\nbut Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in <br/>\nthe flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved <br/>\nme, and gave himself for me.&quot;<br/>\n    Galatians 2:20</div>",
