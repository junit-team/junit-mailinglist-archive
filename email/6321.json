    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1512830083\">I&#39;m trying to run some JUnit tests on an Apache Axis client. (Axis does web <br/>\nservices, i.e. SOAP.) One of the archives Axis code needs is <br/>\ncommons-logging.jar, which has classes in the package <br/>\norg.apache.commons.logging and subpackages.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy client class&#39; constructor calls the default constructor for an Axis <br/>\nclass, org.apache.axis.client.Service. This causes an exception to crop up:<br/>\njava.lang.ExceptionInInitializerError<br/>\nat org.apache.axis.client.Service.&lt;init&gt;(Service.java:108)<br/>\n...<br/>\nCaused by: org.apache.commons.logging.LogConfigurationException: ... <br/>\norg.apache.commons.logging.impl.Jdk14Logger does not implement Log<br/>\nat <br/>\norg.apache.commons.logging.impl.LogFactoryImpl.newInstance(LogFactoryImpl.java:555) <br/>\n<br/>\n...<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, Jdk14Logger does implement Log; both are in commons-logging.jar. At <br/>\nfirst, I thought this was a simple classloading issue, that somehow an <br/>\ninconsistent version of the class or interface was being picked up. But <br/>\nafter moving common-logging.jar to the head of my classpath list for <br/>\ninvoking JUnit, I still got the error. And anyway, I don&#39;t see Jdk14Logger <br/>\nor Log elsewhere in the classpath.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen I suspected this issue had something to do with JUnit because I saw <br/>\n&quot;Jdk14Logger does not implement Log&quot; had made its way to the Cactus mailing <br/>\nlist. Sure enough, when I run my Axis client directly rather than through <br/>\nJUnit, the exception does not appear.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe funny (weird) thing is, the only difference between the classpath for <br/>\nrunning the client directly and the classpath for running the client <br/>\nthrough my TestCase subclass is the addition of junit.jar. And that doesn&#39;t <br/>\nhave any classes related to commons-logging.</div>",
