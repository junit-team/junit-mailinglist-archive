I&#39;ve implemented fsm&#39;s before, but never\n&gt; characterized a &quot;testable app&quot; as one that effectively *is* one.\n\nI can&#39;t toot my own horn too loudly on this because Boris Beizer had a\nsimilar insight in his book &#39;Software Testing Techniques,&#39; but we arrived at\nit independently.  Finding his discussion of testability in relation to\nFSM&#39;s gave me confidence to say what I thought.\n\nI think the FSM is a fruitful source of ideas about what testability\nentails.  I also think it well-describes the end product of a religiously\ndeveloped TDD application.  That is, everything is clean, tight, purposeful\nand geared toward producing the right output at every step of the way.\n\nSince I&#39;ve begun thinking about this I&#39;ve scoured all the books I have and\ncould find at the local Borders and Barnes & Noble, and have mostly come\nacross pretty shallow treatments of testability in software testing and\nengineering books.  Beizer&#39;s is by far the best example, where he discusses\ntestability in several places with specifics.  Of course Kent Beck&#39;s and\nRobert Martin&#39;s books have a lot of insights and relevance for testability,\nbut the word itself is almost never, if ever, used or analyzed.\n\nI was disappointed to see the new book &#39;Testing Extreme Programming&#39; had a\ncouple of pages of fluff dedicated to the topic of &quot;testability.&quot;\n\n&gt; Note:\n&gt; Here, I find that I need an example to follow the discussion.\n\nI am now working on some examples.  I need them myself to better generalize\nwhat the real principles are and see how apt this FSM idea is.\n\nScott S.\n\n\n\n",
