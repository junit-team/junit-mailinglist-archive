It is defined like\n&gt; &gt; class xmlInfo{\n&gt; &gt; //\n&gt; &gt; //\n&gt; &gt; }.\n&gt; &gt; When I try running the test, it gives me error that I cannot \naccess\n&gt; &gt; the class. I think something is related to packge protection.. I \nwas\n&gt; &gt; wondering if this problem could be solved too..\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes. Make the class public.\n\n\nHey.. \n Thanks a lot.. I appreciate the help. I am not the developer of the \nxmlInfo.. I am just the tester of the entire application and the \ndevelopers have made that it in such a way that no one can access \nit. So, I think the only way that can be tested is if i put my \ntestclass is the samepackage with xmlinfo.. Is that right?.. I \ncannot make the class xmlInfo public. It is out of my reach.. \nThanks,\nAbhishek\n\n\n\n",
