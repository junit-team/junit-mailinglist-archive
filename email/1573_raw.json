I will be using JUnit as a\nframework to do API testing for an API that other developers wrote. I would\nlike to keep test data separate from the test code. I could see this test\ndata being read from an XML file, or quite possibly being retrieved from a\ndatabase via JDBC, or both. \n\nI&#39;m wondering if there has been any discussion on this, or if anyone knows\nof any extensions that have already &quot;invented the wheel&quot; in this area. I&#39;ve\nlooked at JXUnit, but it seems as if the learning curve is a bit too much\nfor me to take it on right now. \n\nThanks, \nBill Laird\n\n\nBTW, if there are any yahoo groups administrators reading this... please\ntake my membership status from &quot;pending&quot; to &quot;approved&quot; in the yahoo\ngroups... thanks. \n\n",
