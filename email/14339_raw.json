How to test it with junit.\n&gt; \n\nWell...  the method is also probably doing other interesting things\nthat you /can/ verify (like changing the state of some other object or\nsome such).\n\nYou may want to look into verifying that a particular state change\nworked out as per your expectations.\n\nSomething else you may want to try is what Martin Fowler refers to as\ninteraction-based testing (depending on how involved the test is).\n\n(Let me find that link... here it is:\nhttp://martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html)\n\nHere you&#39;re not so interested in testing that a certain state has been\nupdated correctly, but more so that the messages passed between\ndifferent objects during an interesting use case have been fired in\nthe right order.\n\nRead the article, there&#39;s a lot more there.  It&#39;s definitely worth\nyour time (as is most of his material  :)).\n\nTake care,\n\n-\nChristian Leskowsky\n\n\n\n\n\n",
