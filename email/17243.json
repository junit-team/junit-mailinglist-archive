The front end should be tested using something<br/>\nappropriate. Depending upon your budget and desire to code, that could<br/>\nbe anything from just using it yourself, to a set of scripts that<br/>\ninteract with the application via HTTP.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; And, ... &lt;&lt; regarding the use of Spring Framework &gt;&gt; is there anyone here<br/>\n&gt; has the experience of doing it???<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is the JUnit mailing list.
