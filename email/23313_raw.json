However, I think the Open/Closed Principle should=\r\n\nguide us here.  TestRule is a distillation of a subset of MethodRule.\nThat=\r\n subset of MethodRule has already had dozens of uses in open\nsource code ac=\r\ncessible to Google Code Search, without need for\nenhancement.  I consider T=\r\nestRule a fairly well-tested API addition.\n\nI&#39;m looking forward to releasin=\r\ng 4.9 with TestRule as currently\nspecified, and then, in the 4.10 cycle, fi=\r\nguring out new extension\npoints that will have a similar bang-for-buck.  Se=\r\ne, for example,\nhttps://github.com/KentBeck/junit/issues/199, which is heav=\r\nily\ninfluenced by some of your feature suggestions.  I&#39;m hoping it will go\n=\r\na long way toward solving the Spring extensibility problem among many\nother=\r\ns.\n\nIt&#39;s been over a year since 4.8.  I don&#39;t intend for 4.9 to spend\nnearl=\r\ny as long as the most recent feature release.\n\n   David Saff\n\nOn Sat, Mar 5=\r\n, 2011 at 3:59 AM, Neale Upstone\n&lt;neale.upstone@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Dav=\r\nid,\n&gt;\n&gt; There is a problem in parking feature requests for 4.9 in that 4.9 =\r\nis a\n&gt; feature release and introduces API changes e.g. TestRule, which are\n=\r\n&gt; subject to debate over API (e.g. the desire from the Spring point of\n&gt; vi=\r\new to have Object target in there to allow us to replace\n&gt; SpringJUnit4Clas=\r\nsRunner with a Rule).\n&gt;\n&gt; If TestRule is released as is in 4.9, then it&#39;s s=\r\netting a very\n&gt; constrained direction which will be difficult to change in =\r\n4.10.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; On 04/03/2011 18:35, David Saff wrote:\n&gt;&gt; All,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Over the=\r\n last week or so, I&#39;ve triaged almost 200 JUnit issues that\n&gt;&gt; have accumul=\r\nated over the last year, closing about 80 truly invalid\n&gt;&gt; issues that were=\r\n fixed, duplicates, or no longer made sense.
