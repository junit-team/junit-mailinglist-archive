He appeared to be claiming that it came from the JUnit \n&gt; Web site.  I was investigating the claim.\n\nAH.  As J.B. already said.. you could have asked for clarification.\n\n\n&gt; &gt; Page 74-78, &quot;Test-Driven Development: A Practical Guide&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hmmmm.  Doesn&#39;t appear to be the JUnit Web site ...\n\nI may be dating myself but I still put more more faith in\npeer-reviewed published-by-reputable-publishers books that anything on\nthe web.\n\n&gt; Each new fixture ** is created in an instance of that subclass, used\n&gt; once, then discarded.&quot; **\n\n&gt; Hoist with your own petard, I would say ;-)\n\nWhy?  If we wish to discuss terminology.. then.. exactly what the\n*&^%#%@% does that mean?  Very rude images come to mind.\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; then recall that an object is an INSTANCE of a class.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Well... not always... in the common-place OO languages, sure.  But\n&gt; &gt; sometimes it&#39;s a copy of a prototype.\n&gt; \n&gt; My friend\n\nThere you go making assumptions again :)\n\n&gt; this is the JUnit list.  We are talking about Java classes.\n\nAh.. but you didn&#39;t say &quot;**In Java** an object is an instance of a class&quot;\n\n&gt; You may disparage Java as a commonplace OO language.  That&#39;s your \n&gt; right.\n\nActually, it just really sucks as programming languages go... but so\ndo most of the currently mainstream ones.\n\n&gt; In Java\n\nJava is not the whole enchilada, my friend.\n\n&gt; a class is a very well-specified thing, and it not the same\n&gt; thing as a instance.\n\nUnfortunately true.&#92;\n\n&gt; You really ought to know this.\n\nOh.. I really do.  But I try not to constrain my thinking by the\nlimitations of a single language.\n\n&gt; I think that that we could use our time more productively than this.\n\nDiscussion = unproductive?  Not in my world.  Discussion-&gt;learning.\n\n&gt; I have been trying to decide whether unit testing is really \n&gt; applicable in multi-threaded applications, for example, and \n&gt; wondering how JUnit could be extended to be useful in this area.  \n\nYou can;t conslusively test for correctness in a concurrent system..\nat least I ready that somewhere not too long ago.. but it might have\nbeen online.\n\nDave\n\n\n\n",
