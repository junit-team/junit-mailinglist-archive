This\n&gt; course will be taught in a variety of formats and lengths ranging from\n&gt; 90-minute seminar to one or two day hands on tutorial to a traditional\n&gt; university setting. Obviously how much I can cover and how deep I can go\n&gt; will vary depending on format, length, and audience level.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m wondering if anyone has any good ideas for examples to use in this\n&gt; course? Ideally I&#39;d like something that&#39;s simple enough to do in a day,\n&gt; but still gives attendees a feeling that they&#39;ve developed something\n&gt; real. I could possibly do something involving the Mandelbrot set or\n&gt; cellular automata. However, I&#39;d prefer something a little less\n&gt; mathematical if possible.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;d like it to have a GUI component, but at the same time I&#39;d like that\n&gt; to show up fairly late in the application, and for the application to\n&gt; still make sense if there&#39;s not time to cover testing GUIs.\n&gt;\n&gt; It should be possible to develop this program on a laptop not connected\n&gt; to the Internet. i.e. no databases access, network communications, web\n&gt; services, the U.S. tax code, and so forth.\n&gt;\n&gt; Students will have a wide variety of backgrounds so I want to avoid any\n&gt; special knowledge of subjects like XML processing, financial\n&gt; derivatives, quantum physics, and so forth. I should be able to cover\n&gt; the background necessary to start writing the program in 10 minutes or\n&gt; less.\n&gt;\n&gt; Any ideas?\n&gt;\n&gt; -- \n&gt; Elliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\n&gt; XML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!\n&gt; http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/\n&gt; http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim\n\n\nHow about Bill Wake&#39;s Spreadsheet idea &lt;http://www.xp123.com/xplor/xp0201/&gt;?\n\n-- \nJason Rogers\n\n&quot;I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I,\nbut Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in \nthe flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved \nme, and gave himself for me.&quot;\n    Galatians 2:20\n\n\n",
