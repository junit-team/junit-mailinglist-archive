Most of the\n&gt; documentation about mock objects says: &quot;don&#39;t mock 3rd party code&quot;, but\n&gt; if I don&#39;t, then how am I expected to test my code that uses these 3rd\n&gt; party libraries.\n&gt; \n&gt; In particular I found this statement from\n&gt; http://www.mockobjects.com/DynaMock.html:\n&gt; &quot;We have found that mocking third party classes (and interfaces) over\n&gt; which we have no control causes problems in the long run. It is better\n&gt; to define an interfaces for your objects in terms of concepts in your\n&gt; application, and then implement them as wafer-thin adapters to the third\n&gt; party libraries. That has two benefits: (a) your objects are easier to\n&gt; understand, and (b) your application is not polluted with references to\n&gt; third party packages that might have to be replaced for non-technical\n&gt; reasons. You do not need to have full control over the entire codebase\n&gt; to follow this approach.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t really understand what is meant by this. I&#39;ll return to the\n&gt; example that I&#39;ve been struggling with, one of my classes takes a\n&gt; NetworkInterface object as a parameter to the constructor. Now in order\n&gt; for me to test that all is well in the constructor I need to mock\n&gt; NetworkInterface.\n&gt; \n&gt; If somebody could please give me an example of what to do. If possible\n&gt; please use a class that takes NetorkInterface as an argument to the\n&gt; constructor as an example, as I&#39;m struggling to understand this.\n&gt; \n&gt; Btw I would post this on the easyMock mailing list, but I&#39;m having\n&gt; problems joining this list.\n\nI call this &quot;Mock one level of abstraction higher&quot;.\n\nExample: When I mock/fake JDBC, I end up with a bunch of tests that make \nthe same checks about connections, statements, and so on.\n\nTHEREFORE,\n\nCreate an interface Repository on which my (current) JDBC client \ndepends, then implement Repository with JdbcRepository that talks JDBC \nto the database. Now:\n\n1. I can test the (former) JDBC client using a fake or mock Repository, \nwhich has domain-oriented methods and is therefore a less verbose and \nmore useful API.\n\n2. I can test the methods in JdbcRepository /outside the context of the \napplication/ with a real database (possibly in memory). If 3 business \nlogic methods use a certain Repository method, I don&#39;t have to test that \nmethod /as part of/ all 3 of those business logic tests -- I only test \nthat Repository method once.\n\nConclusion: Fewer, faster tests. Clear win.\n-- \nJ. B. (Joe) Rainsberger\nDiaspar Software Services\nhttp://www.diasparsoftware.com\nAuthor, JUnit Recipes: Practical Methods for Programmer Testing\n\n",
