Both Eclipse and Ant, for example,\n&gt; already have built in the feature to gather and run all the tests in a\n&gt; package/directory.\n\n1. We don&#39;t use Ant to run tests\n2. reasons we don&#39;t use Eclipse&#39;s built-in functionality:\n  a. Eclipse seemed to skip some tests in the 3.0.x branch (we would \nselect 1 project whose tests would number N, its dependent projects \nwould weigh in at M tests.  So you would expect N + M tests to have been \nrun.  Not so.  It was N + M - X tests.  I don&#39;t know where things were \ngetting lost.  I noticed this because I had a test in which I was \nforcing a failure and it never failed.  Why?  It never ran.)\n  b. using JUnit-Addons we actually are able to be more selective in the \ntypes of tests we run through Eclipse Launchers.  We have launchers for \nUnits only, Units and Database Tests, Functional Tests, and All Tests.  \nThe suite is built on the fly via tests implementing specific interfaces.\n\n-- \nJason Rogers\n\n&quot;I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I,\nbut Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in\nthe flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved\nme, and gave himself for me.&quot;\n    Galatians 2:20\n\n (&#92; /)\n  0 0     www.squeak.org\n  =*= \n\n\n",
