If not, then the <br/>\ndesign could be improved to avoid this problem. The Pragmatic <br/>\nProgrammers call what you describe as &quot;Programming by Coincidence&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I am a firm believer that tests should be as close as possible to production<br/>\n&gt; code.  I don&#39;t know about you, but:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; - I am nervous when I run my tests on Postgresql and the production site<br/>\n&gt; runs on Oracle.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>&lt;snip /&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI am obviously not clear enough in my approach. Let me try to rectify <br/>\nthat here.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a programmer I do not want rely on Collaboration tests to prove the <br/>\ncorrectness of /individual objects/. Instead I want to rely on Isolation <br/>\ntests (with fakes/mocks and interface separation) for that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI only want to use Collaboration tests when I&#39;m worried that I might get <br/>\nthe collaboration among objects wrong, such as what you describe: <br/>\nPostgresql v. Oracle. I could write a body of tests that can do double <br/>\nduty, but I would probably run the tests against HSQLDB more often than <br/>\nI run them against Oracle.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know that /someone/ will want to use Collaboration tests extensively <br/>\n-- testers, customers, whoever -- and I don&#39;t begrudge them that, just <br/>\nas long as they don&#39;t expect me to maintain their tests.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; - I feel ever worse when my tests are using mocks, because not only are<br/>\n&gt; mocks non trivial to write (and they require you to maintain a parallel line<br/>\n&gt; of code), they can give you a deadly sense of security.  And then one day,<br/>\n&gt; your mock tests run fine but the production code breaks, and you enter a<br/>\n&gt; world of pain.  Trust me, it&#39;s not pretty.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Since I don&#39;t have this pain often enough to be serious, I must be doing <br/>\nsomething else -- some kind of compensating practice -- to avoid it. I <br/>\nwish I knew what that was so I could share it with everyone.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; With all that in mind, it makes sense to have a testing framework that takes<br/>\n&gt; dependencies into account and makes it as easy as possible for you to:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; - Identify which test *really* broke (compare &quot;1 SUCESS 25 FAILED&quot; to &quot;1<br/>\n&gt; SUCCESS 1 FAILED and 23 SKIPS&quot;).<br/>\n&gt; - Allow you to rerun the failed tests easily, including all the dependencies<br/>\n&gt; if any<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; These are the main features that TestNG offers (and many more of course<br/>\n&gt; :-)).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I agree that for those people who prefer to stay close to real <br/>\ndependencies, TestNG&#39;s features are great. I find my designs are cleaner <br/>\nwhen I try to move away from hardcoded/real dependencies towards an <br/>\ninterface-rich design.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s what makes the world great: we can get to the same place <br/>\ndifferent ways and not want to kill each other. I wish certain countries <br/>\nwould feel the same way. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
