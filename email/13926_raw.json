It would be very powerful. I&#39;m having trouble\n&gt; understanding what you would use it for beyond what you can do with\n&gt; @Before/@After and @BeforeClass and @AfterClass, though. Do you have an\n&gt; example?\n\nKent,\n\nIt&#39;s not so much that I think it couldn&#39;t be done with the existing \nannotations, as that it would be more elegant if a decorator annotation was \ndirectly available.\n\nAn example that I&#39;ve got right at hand is a decorator I used to set up the \nJNDI space with mock objects, so that the code-under-test had access to \nexpected resources. I used a decorator, rather than a base class, because I \nneeded this to be available across several different test hierarchies, some \nof which already extended from different sub-class of TestCase. An \nalternative would have been to use a duplicated setUp() method. But this \nwas ugly duplication... Another good example would be for using IoC \ntechniques on the test itself.\n\nWith the @Before/@After annotations, I could do something similar. But it \nwould still be duplication that would be annoying. With an annotation \ndecorator I&#39;d be able to reduce that duplication to a single declaration of \nintent.\n\nMore generally, however, I&#39;d like a way to extend JUnit without fighting \nit. There are some powerful techniques in JUnit 3.8 that I wouldn&#39;t want to \nlose, for example - one such is the ability to programatically create test \ncases (see http://twasink.net/blog/archives/2003/10/junit_and_datad.html \nfor more on this - or Chapter 4.8 of JB Rainsberger&#39;s &quot;JUnit Recipes&quot;). In \nJUnit 4, there appears to be no way to do the same thing; I&#39;d be forced to \nhave a single test, which read the data file iteratively - needless to say, \nthis wouldn&#39;t give me the same level of granularity in reports.\n\nIn fact, in order to get the same level of flexibility in JUnit 4 as is in \nJUnit 3, you&#39;d need at the very least to give an equivalent of the suite() \nmethod - currently, there is no way to change the way that test instances \nare obtained. Perhaps a test class could define a TestFactory annotation, \nwhich would default to the TestInstropector?\n\n(Actually, for the ultimate in flexibility, you&#39;d need to provide a way to \nchange the runner strategy, too - but that&#39;s probably overkill)\n\nUltimately, what I would like to be able to do is have equivalents of \npopular JUnit extensions, such as DBUnit, ServletUnit, and JUnitPerf, which \nare configured using annotations rather than base classes. The annotations \ncurrently in JUnit 4 wouldn&#39;t allow this.\n\n(Cedric, if you&#39;re reading this... every one of these points applies to \nTestNG as well)\n\n-- \n                &quot;Software is too expensive to build cheaply&quot;\nRobert Watkins         http://twasink.net/          robertdw@...\n\n",
