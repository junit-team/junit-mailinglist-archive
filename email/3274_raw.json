How do I write test cases for\nevent driven program ?\nFor e.g. I have a class A.\nThis has three functions \n1. public boolean ConnectURL(); \nThis function connects to a particular URL and loads the details onto the\nscreen. If this is successful, it returns true else false. \n2. public void Initialisation();\nThis functions initializes some parameters\n3. public boolean Save(Object obj);\nThis function saves the details on the screen and if successful, it returns\ntrue, else false.\n\n In my test class, I will be writing test methods for all these functions.\n1. Do I need to write a test method for the second function that is just\ndoing some initialization. If so, how will I write that ? \n2. For the first function, I will write a test method as follows\npublic boolean testConnectURl() {\n\tA obj1;\n\tboolean  b = obj1.ConnectURL();\n\t/// How do I write an assert statement after this ?\n}\n\nI have seen the archive of all the messages but I am not clear on how I\nwrite test classes for event driven programs.\n\n\nThanks\n\nSowmya\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tEric Vought [mailto:evought@...] \nSent:\tFriday, November 09, 2001 10:45 PM\nTo:\tjunit@yahoogroups.com\nSubject:\tRe: [junit] Inner Class, Even Driven Classes\n\nThe short answer is that they are usually tested in the same testcase as the\nenclosing class. Where the testcase are complex enough for a sepearte\ntestcase class to make sense, refactoring the inner class to the top level\nwill also typically make sense. For the long answer, I&#39;ll lay out a few\ncases for you and how they are handled in my experience.\nIf the class is a tightly coupled private utility, like an iterator or an\nevent adapter, these are typically tested in the test case for the class.\nIn the case of an event listener, whether the listener is implemented by an\nadapter or the class itself is a minor organizational detail. The important\nquestion is whether the event is dispatched correctly. With iterators, they\ntend to be very minor in functionality and extremely tightly coupled.\nIterators are therefore more of a special reference or psuedopod of the\nclass-under-test than a separate entity and are also tested in the same\ntestcase.\nSometimes, you use an inner class to define an interface that goes along\nwith it, such as defining static inner  classes to represent listeners for\nevents which only that class will generate. The example I have in front of\nme right now is a class called LogListener.MaskChangeListener. LogListener\naccepts logging events from a Logger for dispatch. A particular LogListener,\nhowever, only accepts events of a particular set of priorities (e.g. WARNING\nor above). A Logger wishes to avoid instantiating messages that will never\nbe processed, so it monitors the priority masks of its Listeners. It should\nbe obvious that MaskChangeListener is very specific to LogListener and\ntherefore may as well be a part of it.\nIn these cases, you have a base class or interface which will be implemented\nor extended by some other class. The general practice here is to create a\ntestcase for that base class (using a stub implementation) and then the\ntestcases for actual implementations can inherit your abstract testcase to\nensure that invariants are maintained. With the inner class situation,\nhowever, most of the eventual implementations will themselves be inner\nclasses (adapters) and therefore will not be tested as separate entities.\nFurther, there really aren&#39;t any invariants to be maintained beyond what the\ncompiler will verify for you- namely, that a method exists with that\nsignature in the implementing class. So, in this case, too, there isn&#39;t any\nspecial testing to be done.\nAs your inner class gets more complex- perhaps it is an abstract class with\nsome fields or concrete code- the case for doing a seperate testcase gets\nstronger, but so does the case for refactoring. Even if the inner class\nneeds access to private state which you don&#39;t wish to expose, the dependency\ncan probably be reduced through refactoring to the point where you can use\nsimple listeners and adapters to connect two top-level classes.\nThe borderline case I sometimes run into is an inner class representing a\nsouped up type-safe enumeration. The enumeration has methods to produce or\nparse a human-readable representation of a value and has some special code\nto handle serialization safely. If the enumeration is conceptually coupled\nto the enclosing class, it makes sense to leave it as an inner class.  There\nis *some* significant functionality to test (mostly looking for simple\ntyping errors), which is conceptually different from the functionality of\nthe top-level class and tends to clutter the testcase a little if included.\nI could see a case for breaking this out into multiple testcase if there\nwere a number of similar inner classes in the top-level class. Otherwise, I\nstill tend to keep all the tests in one container.\nOn Fri, 9 Nov 2001 sowmya.srinivasan@... wrote:\n&gt; Hello\n&gt; I have just started using JUnit.\n&gt; I have a few queries.\n&gt;\n&gt; 1.
