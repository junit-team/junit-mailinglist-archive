I can write assertThat(someString, isMyMothersMaidenName()), for example, and it looks no different, stylistically, to assertThat(someString, containsString(&quot;foo&quot;)).  The user can write one small component -- the new matcher -- and seamlessly plug it into anything that accepts a matcher and get all the testing and diagnostic descriptions almost for free.<br/>\n<br/>\nDavid&#39;s suggestion is convenient but cannot be extended. I can&#39;t write assertThat(someString).isMyMothersMaidenName(), for example. I&#39;d like to see some middle-ground between the two.  Maybe a factory function can use reflection to create a matcher that is then passed as a parameter to assertThat.  I think this is how the logicalpractice-collections library works.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Nat</div>",
