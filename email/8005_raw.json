Perhaps I\n&gt; &gt; was not clear when I stated what I was looking for. I want the behavior\n&gt; &gt; that is:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; setUp() -&gt; first test -&gt; tearDown()\n&gt; &gt; setUp() -&gt; next test -&gt; tearDown()\n&gt; &gt; ...\n&gt; &gt; setUp() -&gt; last test -&gt; tearDown()\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; But overriding runTest() produces:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; setUp() -&gt; first test -&gt; next test -&gt; last test -&gt; tearDown()\n&gt; \n&gt; STOOOOOOOOOP!  What you have to do is really simple:\n&gt; \n&gt; - forget everything you know about runTest\n&gt; \n&gt; - write your TestCases the old fashion way:\n&gt; \n&gt;      public void MyTest extends TestCase {\n&gt;          protected void setUp() { /* ... */ }\n&gt;          protected void tearDown() { /* ... */ }\n&gt; \n&gt;          public void testFirst() { /* ... */ }\n&gt;          public void testSecond() { /* ... */ }\n&gt;      }\n\nThanks for the suggestion. Once again, it was so obvious I\ndidn&#39;t see it. Doh!\n\n&gt; keep it simple :-)\n\nI&#39;m all for that!\n\n&gt; &gt; Only calling setUp() once before all testXXX() methods, and\n&gt; &gt; tearDown() once after all testXXX() methods.\n&gt; \n&gt; You don&#39;t have to call anything, the framework does it for you.\n\nThat&#39;s what I meant. Sorry I wasn&#39;t clearer.\n\n&gt; &gt; As far as the name passed to the TestCase not being the test method\n&gt; &gt; name, that does work as in my example, if you override runTest().\n&gt; \n&gt; yes, if you overwrite runTest().  But this is not how JUnit is \n&gt; supposed to work (well AFAIK).\n\nAs previously stated, I am aware it is rarely used this way, but\nthis was a question for understanding, not necessarily practicality.\n\n&gt; &gt; Once again, lest y&#39;all think I&#39;m completely nuts, I wasn&#39;t advocating\n&gt; &gt; this approach, just trying to understand the behavior since it is\n&gt; &gt; both possible and documented in the JUnit files.\n&gt; \n&gt; I see what you mean.  The &quot;problem&quot; is that the documentation \n&gt; presents how the framework was developed (from day one) and it also \n&gt; presents options that IMO make little sense with the finished \n&gt; framework (like overwriting the runTest method) but not when the \n&gt; framework was young and immature.\n\nI guess the historical angle had not occurred to me. That&#39;s an\ninteresting point of view. I will try to &quot;refactor&quot; my thinking\nwith this in mind and see if that changes my mind about how\nstatic invocation works.\n\n&gt; Ok, don&#39;t start flaming me and presenting 10,000 good resons to \n&gt; overwrite runTest, please :-)\n\nNever! You&#39;ve been very insightful.\n\nThanks, Derek\n=====================================\n--- The Gunslinger\nquikdraw@...\n\n\n",
