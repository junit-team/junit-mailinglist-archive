Google&#39;s a hotbed of the sort of programmers who like to read \nand write books about OO theory and language design. But most of the \nworld is not Google.\n\nThere are certainly widely promulgated recommendations to use \ninterfaces. I&#39;m not sure these recommendations are actually accepted by \nanyone except the people promulgating them, though. In particular, what \nI see is a lot of relatively smart people quietly blaming themselves for \nnot understanding the complexity that&#39;s being foisted on them, and \nthinking they must be stupid for not understanding it. They may use \ninterfaces when forced to do so by the frameworks, but they don&#39;t like \nit; and they certainly don&#39;t make it the first choice in their own code.\n\nInterfaces have their place, but that place has been vastly overdrawn in \nthe Java world. Most classes simply do not need more than one \nimplementation.\n\n-- \n﻿Elliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nJava I/O 2nd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeaulait.org/books/javaio2/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596527500/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/\n\n",
