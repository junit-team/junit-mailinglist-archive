It then reports on which\nmethods\nwere hit and which ones weren&#39;t, using reflection to gather a list of\nthe\nmethods that were expected to have been hit.\n\nThe other interesting thing we&#39;ve been doing lately with this method\nentry\ndata is to walk the stack frames on method entry notification to find\nthe\ncalling methods, and then build an object interaction diagram from that.\nBesides displaying the interactions (useful for debugging) we&#39;re also\nusing\nthem to generate more tests for lower level collaborating objects.\n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nMike Silverstein\t\tvoice:  (919) 858-8300 x29\nSilverMark, Inc.\t\t\tThe object testing company\n5511 Capital Center Drive\t\tmobile: (919) 669-5906\nSuite 510, Raleigh, NC 27606\t\ttoll free: (888) 588-0668\nhttp://www.silvermark.com\t\tmsilverstein@...\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: John Stetic [mailto:johns@...]\n&gt; Sent: Monday, June 25, 2001 8:50 PM\n&gt; To: &#39;junit@yahoogroups.com&#39;\n&gt; Subject: [junit] Test coverage metrics reporting tool\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m trying to put together a test coverage metrics reporting\n&gt; tool, and want\n&gt; to know if anyone has tried doing this yet. (I&#39;m sure someone\n&gt; has.)   What I\n&gt; what to do is generate a report that shows some stats on how many\nclasses\n&gt; have test cases and how many methods in the class under test have\n&gt; corresponding test methods.  I have tried it a few different ways:\n&gt;\n&gt; 1. Just scanning through the source folder, picking up the java files\nand\n&gt; then checking if a ?Test.java file exists in a corresponding unit test\n&gt; folder.\n&gt;\n&gt; This approach works well if I only cared about the file coverage,\n&gt; but I now\n&gt; want info on the method coverage.  Enter method 2.\n&gt;\n&gt; 2. Use a tool that will parse through the java source and tell me all\nthe\n&gt; methods. I used javadoc for this, but the problem with it is that\n&gt; I can only\n&gt; sort through one source structure at a time, and javadoc is not so\nnice to\n&gt; call programmatically (it shuts down your app after it runs once).\n&gt;\n&gt; If anyone has suggestions on a better was to get info on the methods\nin a\n&gt; class, and other information like is the class an interface, I\n&gt; would love to\n&gt; hear it.  Or better yet, if anyone has seen or built a tool\n&gt; similar to what\n&gt; I&#39;m doing I would also love to hear about it.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt;\n&gt; John\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
