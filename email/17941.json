At many sites in the US of A, including my current<br/>\nand several previous ones, will often specify that users not be given<br/>\nadministration rights to their workstations and, further, that the<br/>\ndownload and install (in case you get around the lack of admin rights)<br/>\nof any unauthorised software (and they usually get picky down to the<br/>\nversion numbers) is a dismissible offence. This doesn&#39;t make sense,<br/>\napplied to developers, but corporate policies are a very real fact of<br/>\nlife for many of us.
