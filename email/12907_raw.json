I wonder why you&#39;d feel you had to build a test framework \nfor web sites, when so many good ones already exist.\n\n&gt; Currently I&#39;m using JUnit and HttpUnit to create a\n&gt; series of functional tests for each site.  The tests\n&gt; are run from the commandline using ant.  This works\n&gt; great and I want to build on top of this.\n&gt; \n&gt; What I&#39;d like to have is a web application that shows\n&gt; all the available tests, has checkboxes for each test\n&gt; to run. A submit button would run the chosen tests and\n&gt; show the test output in some way.\n\nOh! You want to build a custom test runner! That&#39;s completely different.\n\n&gt; Do I have to create my own test runner class for this?\n&gt; As I say I&#39;m in the initial stages of research. I&#39;d\n&gt; appreciate any advice.  Thanks.\n\nI would search the web. The odds are good that a servlet-based test \nrunner already exists.\n-- \nJ. B.
