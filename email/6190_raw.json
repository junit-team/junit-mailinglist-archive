The problem \n&gt; is my Visual Source Safe files that are left in every \n&gt; directory, and always named the same. Is it possible to to \n&gt; get Eclipse to ignore duplicate files?\n\nI don&#39;t use VSS so I don&#39;t know what files you mean, but I do wonder why\ntheir part of the project.\n\n&gt; \tAlso, when you specify multiple input directories like \n&gt; this, doesn&#39;t bunch all of your class files from the various \n&gt; directory structures together? I tend to like to keep my \n&gt; class files in the same directories as their respective java \n&gt; files, but that&#39;s just me...\n\nMy philosophy is that, when adopting a new language, you should adopt the\ncommon conventions with that language.  When I did C and assembler, I kept\nthe object files in the same directory as the source.  With java, that&#39;s not\nthe normal convention.  I quickly found that many tools, including some of\nSun&#39;s, did not handle things gracefully with that convention once the source\noccupied more than one directory.  Therefore I always set an output\ndirectory for the class files.\n\nI realize that neither of these answers help you do what you&#39;re trying to\ndo.  They only raise questions about what your trying to do.  I&#39;m sorry I\ndon&#39;t have any better help.\n\n - George\n\n",
