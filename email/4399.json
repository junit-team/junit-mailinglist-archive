The \nnotion seems to be that each method in a </font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">&gt;&gt; class, or perhaps each public method, \nshould have a unit test.</font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">&gt;&gt; I think this is wrong. I think, as J.B. \nsaid, that in such a case you should concentrate on testing <br><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; \n </span></blockquote>features, not simply methods.</font></div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>I see too distinct cases here: (1)&nbsp;tools that will generate stubs \n(like JBuilder 6 as I read in this <br>string of notes) and (2) tools that will \nautomatically produce some test cases for you (like JTest,</div>\n<div>which I personally use).</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>1. Let&#39;s start with the first set of tools:</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Starting from scratch or even from automatically generated empty stubs may \nhave some immediate</div>\n<div>effect on a small code base (less than 20.000 lines of code) , as you are \nlikely to have more insight </div>\n<div>on what the code actually does.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>On a larger project, I agree that the initial benefit is reduced, but there \nis a tangible benefit of having</div>\n<div>the initial unit test *structure* in place. On the long run, people adding \nnew features, or even maintaining </div>\n<div>the already existing ones, will have something to build upon instead of \nstumbling everytime&nbsp;with the very</div>\n<div>same request the original author posted in this list.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>2. As for JTest, it will do even something else for you, which is to come \nup (through reflection </div>\n<div>and some other techniques) with a basic set of unit tests that can be \nmanually augmented later </div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div></font><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">&gt;&gt; I would be \nvery curious to know if anyone can report on actual (measured, quantitative) \nexperiences </font></font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">&gt;&gt; that either \nsupport or refute this.</font></font></div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>This is a comparison between no coverage and no structure for automated \nunit test and </div>\n<div>some coverage and a initial foundation for automated unit testing. From \npast experience,</div>\n<div>the first group is working on chaos and doesn&#39;t have any metric to be \ncompared against</div>\n<div>the second group of people. Usually, when you ask these teams how much \nimprovement </div>\n<div>they&#39;ve got from establishing any kind of process you just receive a &quot;it is \nmuch better now&quot; </div>\n<div>response.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Regards,</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Denilson</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\"\n size=\"2\">===========================================<br><a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nastacio@...\">nastacio@...</a><br><a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://nastacio.home.att.net\">http://nastacio.home.att.net</a><br></font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <div>----- Original Message ----- </div>\n<blockquote\n style=\"PADDING-RIGHT:0px;PADDING-LEFT:5px;MARGIN-LEFT:5px;BORDER-LEFT:#000000 2px solid;MARGIN-RIGHT:0px;\">\n  <div\n style=\"BACKGROUND:#e4e4e4;FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>From:</b> \n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"alan@...\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:alan@...\">Alan Bram</a> \n  </div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>To:</b> <a rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"junit@yahoogroups.com\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a> </div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>Sent:</b> Monday, March 18, 2002 1:41 \nPM</div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>Subject:</b> [junit] RE: Is there a tool \n  which generates JUnit-test stubs?</div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font><br></div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">In this discussion, apparently we have been \n  talking about &quot;retrofitting&quot; unit tests for old code that never before had \n  them. The notion seems to be that each method in a class, or perhaps each \n  public method, should have a unit test.</font></div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">I think this is wrong. I think, as J.B. said, \n  that in such a case you should concentrate on testing features, not simply \n  methods.</font></div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">I would say that for new code, where you&#39;re \n  writing tests along with your production code, it might make sense to try for \n  a test per (public) method. But that&#39;s because in this case you have the \n  benefit of thinking about the testing at the time you&#39;re writing the code. I \n  think you&#39;re more likely to design your code in such a way as to have this \n  make more sense. (The &quot;testing influences design&quot; notion.)</font></div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">The problem I see with mindlessly (or even \n  mindfully) writing a test for each method, just to satisfy someone&#39;s idea that \n  code coverage is good, is that you&#39;re likely to (1) invest a lot of (or even a \n  little) time; and (2) generate a lot of test code (which will have to be \n  maintained, don&#39;t forget), for what will turn out to be little or no benefit. \n  I would bet that the marginal number of bugs found by &quot;complete&quot; per-method \n  tests over a more sensible per-feature approach, both now and forever in the \n  future, is very close to zero. At least that&#39;s my impression based on my own \n  experiences.</font></div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">More is not always better.</font></div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">I would be very curious to know if anyone can \n  report on actual (measured, quantitative) experiences that either support or \n  refute this.</font></div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">&nbsp;- Alan Bram</font></div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">&nbsp;&nbsp; \nalan@...</font></div><br><br><tt>To \n  unsubscribe from this group, send an email \n  to:<br>junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com<br></tt><br><br><tt>Your use of \n  Yahoo!
