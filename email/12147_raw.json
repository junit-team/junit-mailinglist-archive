I just want that manager to SAY IT. To me, that&#39;s\n&gt;  &gt; important. I won&#39;t be complicit in an unspoken scheme to go slower,\n&gt;  &gt; because at the end of the day, when we don&#39;t go fast enough, the\n&gt;  &gt; executives will rain on the managers will rain on me. No thanks.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ah, but it&#39;s not the reasonable first level manager who says it. It&#39;s\n&gt; the VP of the organization, who has given up trying to buck the\n&gt; standards officers. And they don&#39;t believe that my procedure will\n&gt; help, but they are certain that the standard they worked so hard to\n&gt; put into place solved a lot of problems for them - and have seen chaos\n&gt; ensue with programmers spitting out chicken heads all over the\n&gt; place...\n&gt; \n&gt; Large organizations tend to lack the immediacy of accountability which\n&gt; facilitates progress.\n\nPresumably I can get the VP&#39;s phone number....\n\n&gt;  &gt; PROGRAMMER: &quot;As long as we&#39;re clear that the corporate standard is more\n&gt;  &gt; important than how productive I can be as a programmer, I&#39;m fine with\n&gt;  &gt; that. By the way, I won&#39;t be working any unpaid overtime this year.\n&gt;  &gt; Sorry about that.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Easier to say when unemployment is low :)\n\nDon&#39;t blame it on the employment rate; blame it on personal financial \nplanning. I left IBM in November 2001, and virtually everyone I tell \nthat asks, &quot;How did you survive?&quot; It&#39;s simple, really: I planned.\n-- \nJ. B.
