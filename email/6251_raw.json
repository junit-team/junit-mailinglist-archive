But others have pointed me toward tools\n&gt;for doing this. \n&gt; * http://tinyurl.com/2uyb\n&gt; * some code from Craig Pardley\n&gt; * use of ant (but I tried this and couldn&#39;t make it work)\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\nJust curious, what happens if initially you get it &quot;wrong&quot;?  Not that I \ncould think of any wrong way, but I&#39;m wondering why you only have one \nchance.  What if you actually came up with a better way than all these \nafter some time using JUnit?\n\n&gt;Interesting. It seems to me like it&#39;d be a much more common\n&gt;solution than that. I&#39;ll go back and look at my designs again\n&gt;and see if I can come up with a different approach that avoids\n&gt;the need for the &quot;dynamic property&quot;. Perhaps I&#39;m missing a\n&gt;good solution.\n&gt;\n\nI should clarify that the factory approach is common, the use of dynamic \nproperties is not, in my experience.  As we&#39;ve seen in other posts, \noften times the test fixture can directly set the implementation on the \nfactory.  Then the factory is set into something else, which is set into \nsomething else, etc.  This is one reason I suggest that testability \nhelps balance out the use of composition and inheritance.  If \ninheritance is overused, then mocking any aspect of the system is \ngenerally difficult.\n\n&gt;Well, I have one suggestion. In response to my question about \n&gt;where to place the tests, nearly everybody responded that a \n&gt;separate source hierarchy was the best place (5 of 6 responders,\n&gt;and the 6th proposed a new solution and said separate hierarchy\n&gt;was his second choice). I think that&#39;s sufficient agreement to\n&gt;make this an acknowledged &quot;best practice&quot;, and if you agree and\n&gt;would like to add it to the FAQ, I&#39;ll volunteer to write up an\n&gt;item on it. Let me know.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\nI&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s a best practice or just a personal aesthetic thing. \n But we could claim it as a best practice.  :-)\n\nHere&#39;s how it&#39;s currently described in the &quot;Organizing Tests&quot; section of \nthe FAQ:\n\n    http://junit.sourceforge.net/doc/faq/faq.htm#organize_1\n\nIf another entry in the &quot;Best Practices&quot; section would help, go for it. \n Thanks!\n\nMike\n\n-- \nMike Clark\nhttp://clarkware.com \n(720) 851-2014\n\n\n\n\n",
