Either one as long as you test.\n\nNo. It&#39;s not a trivial or unimportant difference. testing first is \nradically different than testing last. It is not just about testing. It \nis about developing and understanding the code you;re going to write. It \nis about speeding up the development process.\n\nTest last is the traditional approach, and it doesn&#39;t even have the same \ngoals.\n\n&gt; JUnit or TestNG? Whatever feels most natural to you.\n\nSure.\n\n&gt; Instead of attacking or confronting people who bring other approaches,\n&gt; views, and tools to the table, we should welcome them because we need\n&gt; more people on our side and more/better tools and options to get more\n&gt; people to join the ranks of test-infected developers.\n&gt; \n\nThe sides are not where you think they are. No one here is arguing \nagainst the relevance of QA departments and testing. However test first \ndevelopment is primarily about *development*, not testing. It is a \nprogramming strategy. That strategy depends critically on writing the \nunit tests in sync with the code. It depends critically on applying \nhuman intelligence to the code so the *humans* develop better \nunderstanding of what they want. These are not side issues. They are at \nthe core of test driven development.\n\n-- \n﻿Elliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nJava I/O 2nd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeaulait.org/books/javaio2/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596527500/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/\n\n",
