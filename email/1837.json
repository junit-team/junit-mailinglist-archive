The easiest way I have found<br/>\nto integrate any tool is to follow these steps:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. fully import the source/binaries<br/>\n2. create the tool directory and the default.ini for your tool<br/>\n3. import the Tools API into your workspace<br/>\n4. place any resource files you need into the tool directory (i.e. the gifs<br/>\nfor the awtui or swingui)<br/>\n5. include the project that has your tool in the workspace classpath<br/>\n(actually, its associated &#39;project_resources&#39; folder)<br/>\n6. include the Tools API project in your workspace classpath<br/>\n7. compute the classpath for the class that launches your tool<br/>\n<br/>\nThis allows you to not have to export class files to that tool directory<br/>\nevery time you make a change to the tool.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout not finding the suite() method... that is a different story.  Some<br/>\nthings to look at:<br/>\n1. is your suite method public?<br/>\n2. does your suite method have no argument?<br/>\n3. if #1 and #2 hold true, get the source into VAJ and include a<br/>\nprintStackTrace() in the catch block that prints out &quot;Could not invoke the<br/>\nsuite() method&quot; and see what&#39;s going on.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">     &gt; Another problem I am having is that in spite of the fact <br/>\n    &gt; that I imported the source jar, when I double click<br/>\n    &gt; on a class VA tells me that it has been imported from a <br/>\n    &gt; class file. Also as a result I can not single step through<br/>\n    &gt; the code.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is boggling.  Is it possible that you had a previous version of JUnit<br/>\nin the workspace that was class files?  This can cause a collision in VAJ,<br/>\neven though it isn&#39;t supposed to.  Are you sure you chose src.jar to import<br/>\nfrom?  If these things are not the case, then I would blow away the project<br/>\n(purge the packages from the RepositoryExplorer) and try again.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Jason</div>",
