We choose<br/>\nnot to go with the TIB/Adapter SDK for various<br/>\nreasons.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway we&#39;re busy writing a test suite that publishes<br/>\nmessages and checks that under certain subjects we get<br/>\nspecific messages. Our idea is to automate testing and<br/>\ncheck that at certain points in the process flow we<br/>\nget specific messages. We don&#39;t beleive in the log<br/>\nsolution as doesn&#39;t really check the messages<br/>\nthemselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nInitially we used jUnit and some custom code before we<br/>\nstarted writing appenders for jUnit.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegarding participation to the Raccoon framework we&#39;re<br/>\nbusy melting our stuff with the code from Cedric and<br/>\nwe&#39;re hoping to get all this stuff working together.<br/>\nBasically i&#39;m working on the Raccoon implementation<br/>\nover TIB/Rendezvous whilst Cedric works on the Raccoon<br/>\nimplementation above the TIB/Adapter SDK.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe work isn&#39;t been sent back to the Sourceforge site<br/>\nbecause TIBCO is hassling us, to put things rather<br/>\ncrudely. Raccoon is seen as unfair competition to<br/>\ntheir TIB/Adapter SDK. I beleive that opensource of an<br/>\nadapter SDK will improve TIB applications more than<br/>\nanything else, they don&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re working with Cedric on an offline version and<br/>\nwe&#39;ll see once that&#39;s working how we can put things on<br/>\nthe web site without TIBCO sueing us :o(<br/>\nYou&#39;ll notice for example that the javadoc for the<br/>\nTIB/Adapter SDK that was written by a couple of<br/>\ndeveloppers was removed from the site ...<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the bugs, i think you should inform the Raccoon<br/>\ndevelopers so that they can improve the code :o)<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards,<br/>\n<br/>\nBlue.<br/>\n<br/>\nps: Blue is my first name, Avenger isn&#39;t though ;o)<br/>\nDarkBlueAvenger is my gaming nickname, if you ever<br/>\nfeel play Diablo II online ... you can find me on the<br/>\neuropean servers, occassionaly on the West Coast<br/>\nservers.<br/>\n<br/>\n--- jlhoward_nz &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jlhoward_nz@...\">jlhoward_nz@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Dear dba<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Greetings oh dark and blue.  The project we are<br/>\n&gt; working on involves taking initial code from an<br/>\n&gt; external vendor,  writing tests for it and then<br/>\n&gt; adding<br/>\n&gt; new functions onto it.   We initially investigated<br/>\n&gt; Raccoon and Tibco but found that it was a little<br/>\n&gt; buggy.   We are very keen to continue on the path of<br/>\n&gt; Junit, Tibco etc.  At the moment we have a rather<br/>\n&gt; crude automated testing framework that compares log<br/>\n&gt; files using other technologies such as ant, text<br/>\n&gt; file<br/>\n&gt; comparison utility to test IM workflows.  We are<br/>\n&gt; currently looking at how to test adapters and make<br/>\n&gt; sure they are successful.  Are you contributing the<br/>\n&gt; Racoon code back to the site or not.  Let me know<br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; I can send you some more information.
