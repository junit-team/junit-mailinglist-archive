For example:\n&gt; \tint add(int a, int b){\n&gt; \t\treturn (a+b);\n&gt; \t}\n&gt;\n&gt; \tdouble add(double a, double b) {\n&gt; \t\treturn (a+b);\n&gt; \t}\n&gt;\n&gt; \tfloat add(float a, float b) {\n&gt; \t\treturn (a+b);\n&gt; \t}\n&gt;\n&gt; I need a test called testAdd().  I have to test all of them from this\n&gt; method right?  How I can which one fails?\n\nYour test methods don&#39;t have to mathc your method names. In other words,\nthere is no restriction that testAdd() and only testAdd() tests the method\n&quot;add&quot;. We use the method name as a base and then add additional info to\nit:\n\ntestAddIntInt()\ntestAddDoubleDouble()\n\nTypically, you will have more than one test per method, testing different\nentry conditions:\n\ntestEqualsEmptyInstance()\ntestEqualsWNull()\ntestEqualsWIdentity()\n\netc.\n\n&gt; My next question has to do with testing sub classes.  If I have a\n&gt; framework api with a class, MyBaseClass, and in a project I define\n&gt; MyProjectClass extends MyBaseClass.  Would you want to write tests for\n&gt; methods defined in MyBaseClass?  Is this situation dependant or should\n&gt; you never/always write them?\n\nIf we control the base class, we always write an abstract TestCase when we\nwrite the base class. If it is a third party base class (or interface),\nthen we will often create an appropriate abstract TestCase against their\nbase class, though sometimes we will go back and add it later in a round\nof refactoring. With standard library classes, it is convenient to keep a\nsmall collection of abstract TestCases somewhere that can be reused from\nproject to project (e.g. for Enumeration, Iterator, Collection).\n\nCreating the test case for a 3rd party base class accomplishes two\nthings. You can run the test (possibly with the help of a trivial stub)\nagainst their code to detect bugs, misunderstandings, and behavior\nchanges. You also get a much better indication that the classes you create\nwill interact correctly with their library (or, at least, that you can\ndemonstrate where the fault lies). Implementing this test case can be used\nas a first exploration of a new toolkit/base class to ensure that you\nunderstand both what it is supposed to do and what it actually does\nbefore you build your code around it.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Earl\n&gt; earl.hokens@...\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
