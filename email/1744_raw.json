It seems \n    &gt; that this is not the way that I&#39;m supposed to go, since \n    &gt; there seems to \n    &gt; be no option for that. \n    &gt; \n    &gt; Nevertheless, it would be nice to use the test case for debugging \n    &gt; (until it works).\n    &gt; It there an option for that? \n    &gt; \n    &gt; Cheers, \n    &gt; \n    &gt; Chris\n    &gt; \n    &gt; \n    &gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n    &gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n    &gt;  \n    &gt; \n    &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
