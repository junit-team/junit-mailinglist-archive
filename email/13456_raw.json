If I run this test by itself,\nit&#39;s ok.\n\nI also have a class suite called AgentsTestSuite which contains the\nHouseholdTest.  If I run this test, I get errors on one or two of the\nmethods; i.e rerunning the test over and over again sometimes gives\none error and sometimes two (always on the same methods).  If I use\nRerun failed tests - Failures first, the test is ok in all\ncircumstances.\n\nAgentsTestSuite is inside another suite called ModelTest.  Running\nthis throws up errors on the same methods as above, plus another in a\ndifferent test suite (which again is ok by itself). Rerunning failed\ntests first clears one of the methods in the HouseholdTest but that&#39;s\nit.\n\nWhat is going on here?  I&#39;ve spent quite a while debugging it but\ncan&#39;t seem to figure out where the snag is.  Has anyone else\nencountered something like this?\n\nThanks,\nJames\n\n\n\n\n\n",
