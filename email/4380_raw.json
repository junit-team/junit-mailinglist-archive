Presumably the stack\n&gt; is unwound as an\n&gt; exception handler is hunted for, freeing up stack\n&gt; space.  It is the\n&gt; second stack overflow in the same suite that causes\n&gt; the problem. If the\n&gt; suite only has one error, then that suite can be run\n&gt; multiple times.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; The JVM should never crash though, in the sense of\n&gt; a core dump.  If it\n&gt; &gt; does, it&#39;s likely a JVM bug.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks for the suggestion. This turned out to be\n&gt; correct. The\n&gt; JVM in question is JDK 1.3.1 for Windows.  Turning\n&gt; off compilation\n&gt; (option -Xint) eliminated the problem, as did using\n&gt; jview; JUnit\n&gt; correctly reported both errors under those\n&gt; circumstances.\n&gt; \n&gt; On Thu, 14 Mar 2002, Eric Heikkila wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Kind of sounds like a non-issue.  Fix the stack\n&gt; &gt; overflows. ;)\n&gt; \n&gt; If I didn&#39;t have bugs, I wouldn&#39;t need JUnit. :-)\n&gt; \n&gt; More seriously, using JUnit did reveal the bug; it\n&gt; just did so in the\n&gt; rather abrupt manner of crashing.  I&#39;d prefer to see\n&gt; a red-line and a\n&gt; message.  However, you are right, it is not an issue\n&gt; for me.  At first I\n&gt; thought that the problem might be in the custom\n&gt; implementation of the Test\n&gt; interface that I was using to bridge between JUnit\n&gt; and a test framework I\n&gt; am developing.  Had that been the case, I would have\n&gt; had an issue.  Once I\n&gt; was able to duplicate the problem with a standard\n&gt; TestCase, it was clear\n&gt; that the problem wasn&#39;t in my code, and thus not a\n&gt; problem for me.\n&gt; However the strange behaviour did suggest a bug in\n&gt; JUnit, which might be\n&gt; an issue of interest to those who develop JUnit. \n&gt; But I should have\n&gt; thought of the possibility that it was the JVM at\n&gt; fault.\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; Theodore Norvell\n&gt; \n\n\nPoint taken ;)\n\n-Eric\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
