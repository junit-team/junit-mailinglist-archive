The DB is now well enhenced &\n&gt; contains a flush on close so the deleted records a re definitively removed,\n&gt; etc...\n&gt; Everything has been done in the almost purest JUnit style (must admit many\n&gt; coding followed by testing, but there&#39;s none piping over my schoulder, so\n&gt; ;-) ).\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;d like now to change the accessor of some methods from public to\n&gt; &quot;friendly&quot; or protected for some methods as they are not needed for the\n&gt; caller anymore.\n&gt; My question is twofold :\n&gt;     1�. What are the possibilities ?\n&gt;         Would simply moving the TestCase as inner\n&gt;         class suite the matter.\n&gt;     2�. Am I&#39;m better to make all the TestCases member\n&gt;         of the package of the class to test & make the accessor\n&gt;         protected ?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Tx for advice,\n&gt; \n&gt; Thomas,\n&gt; \n&gt; p.s. :\n&gt; To read with a sens of humour\n&gt; I was wandering if some of the fossiles wagging around this web site could\n&gt; lay down some of their best advices on testing private/protected methods &\n&gt; testing with inner classes.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/junit/message/3542\n&gt; \n&gt; --\n&gt; \n&gt; Thomas SMETS - Certified Java Programmer\n&gt; rue J.
