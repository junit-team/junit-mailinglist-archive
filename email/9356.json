It&#39;s not very general, but here&#39;s what<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve got/done, and a Question:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; * AbstractTestGraph is the class [subclass, eventually, of TestCase] of<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   tests for Graph; subclasses must define getGraph() to return the Graph<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   to be tested.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; * There are three styles of Graph, so each new implementation of Graph at<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   the moment has to generate three new subclasses of AbstractTestGraph,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   one for each style of Graph for getGraph, and suite them up together.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   Ikky.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To avoid this, pass the Graph to the graph test as a constructor. The<br/>\n&gt; graph test stores the graph in a field (as part of the fixture).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The &quot;Ikky&quot; applied to the original code; the revised code I described doesn&#39;t<br/>\nneed to do it, because the class gets passed into the suite-construction,<br/>\nand it replicates the test for each style, extracting the constructor from the<br/>\ngraph class as you suggest.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; What I haven&#39;t solved to my satisfaction is how best to create a<br/>\n&gt; parameterized test case that runs multiple tests with the same<br/>\n&gt; parameters. If I override runTest(), then that runs only one test, which<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t like. I want to know how to do this without re-implementing the<br/>\n&gt; code in JUnit that invokes a test by reflection.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I gave up and re-implemented [a useful fragment of] that code. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; And the Question is, why are TestSuite::isPublicTestMethod and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; TestSuite::isTestMethod *private*? Because even if I wrote a subclass<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of TestSuite, rather than using methods in MetaTestGraph, I wouldn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; be able to re-use them ...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; There was no need to make them non-private until now, I guess. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There wasn&#39;t a need to make them private in the first place, surely.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nChris &quot;electric hedgehog&quot; Dollin<br/>\nC FAQs at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.faqs.org/faqs/by-newsgroup/comp/comp.lang.c.html\">http://www.faqs.org/faqs/by-newsgroup/comp/comp.lang.c.html</a><br/>\nC welcome: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.angelfire.com/ms3/bchambless0/welcome_to_clc.html\">http://www.angelfire.com/ms3/bchambless0/welcome_to_clc.html</a></div>",
