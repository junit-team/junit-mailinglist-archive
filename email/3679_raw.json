I&#39;m \ndoing XP in my new job. You know how they say that XP makes you anxious \nto work in the morning , then tired and satisfied at night? It has done \nthat for me so far. When I get home, I&#39;m tired -- I don&#39;t jump at the \ncomputer like I used to. As a result, I don&#39;t have as much energy to \nanswer questions as I used to. When someone writes a message that I \ninterpret as &quot;Where are you lazy bastards? Answer my question!&quot; I get \nangry most times. I get even more angry now. That is why I responded the \nway I did.\n\nSoon I expect I&#39;ll be back to normal and be able to think long and hard \nabout each of your questions. Until then, I hope that others are able to \npick up the slack.\n\nHmm... now imagine if the top five question-answerers on this list are \nall going through roughly the same thing....\n\nI&#39;m just asking everyone to remember to have respect for the volunteers \nwho answer your questions on this list. I appreciate them all.\n\nJBR.\n\nLee Chalupa wrote:\n\n&gt; I take the time every day to read and think about the posts in this \n&gt; group in the hopes that I\n&gt; can learn and someday help others that have the same questions that I \n&gt; do.  I feel part of the cost of\n&gt; membership of any group is to listen and participate even if it is to \n&gt; only read other people&#39;s questions and thoughts.\n&gt; If you don&#39;t feel like helping me, that is your decision and I respect \n&gt; that.  What I would ask of you is to limit\n&gt; the frivolous chatter in this group that seems to fill my inbox \n&gt; including your pompous lectures that imply that you are\n&gt; some kind of royalty so that replies that have useful content can get \n&gt; their due attention.\n&gt;\n&gt; lee\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; 12/27/01 12:54:47 PM, &quot;J.

We do\n&gt; &gt;   not do your job for you. We help you, perhaps, out of the goodness of\n&gt; &gt;   our hearts, when we have time and when we know the answers. You may\n&gt; &gt;   perhaps allow for the possibility that we are on vacation and not\n&gt; &gt;   sitting by our internet connections, just waiting to answer every \n&gt; one of\n&gt; &gt;   your questions.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   You are forthwith ignored.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   Sorry for the tenor of the response, but I grow tired of people who\n&gt; &gt;   think they own my ass because I contribute to this list.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   JBR.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   lchalupa wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; Would someone please take a look at a posting from me on the JUNIT\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; group a two days ago.\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; It concerns how to test a method that uses jOptionPane.  I got one\n&gt; &gt;   reply.\n&gt; &gt;   &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; In the meantime, what else got a response?  Well, we seem to \n&gt; have time\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; to respond to trivial subjects and partake\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; in what is nothing short of mental masturbation and ignore \n&gt; substantive\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; questions that require some effort.\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; I think I have read about 30 messages about getters and setters that\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; sounds more like a pissing contest.  And then there is the chatter\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; about one piece of spam.  How many worthless messages did this \n&gt; &quot;spam&quot;\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; generate?  Boy we nailed that one didn&#39;t we?\n&gt; &gt;   &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; If you need someone to chat with, get a dog.  I got one, he just\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; doesn&#39;t know java/junit...yet.\n&gt; &gt;   &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; Sorry for the vent but I grow tired of groping in the dark.\n&gt; &gt;   &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; Thanks for your help.\n&gt; &gt;   &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; Lee Chalupa\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   =======================================\n&gt; &gt;   J.
