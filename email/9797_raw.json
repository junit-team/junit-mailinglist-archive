I&#39;ve created a series of tests using\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a fixture which look (in form) like the following:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Jargon Alert: a fixture is what you make assertions about.  Usually\n&gt; &gt; the fixture is created in setUp() and tested in your testA(), testB(),\n&gt; &gt; etc.\n&gt;\n&gt; Ah.. but in proper usage TestCase == fixture... so I have no argument\n&gt; with his use of the word... assuming he&#39;s doing it &quot;right&quot; (i.e. his\n&gt; TestCase is maximally cohesive)\n\nOh.  Proper usage.  From the Fixture section on JUnit Web site:\n\n    http://junit.sourceforge.net/doc/cookbook/cookbook.htm\n\n&quot;Tests need to run against the background of a known set of objects. This\nset of objects is called a test fixture. When you are writing tests you\nwill often find that you spend more time writing the code to set up the\nfixture than you do in actually testing values.&quot;\n...\n&quot;For example, to write several test cases that want to work with different\ncombinations of 12 Swiss Francs, 14 Swiss Francs, and 28 US Dollars, first\ncreate a fixture:\n\npublic class MoneyTest extends TestCase {\n    private Money f12CHF;\n    private Money f14CHF;\n    private Money f28USD;\n\n    protected void setUp() {\n        f12CHF= new Money(12, &quot;CHF&quot;);\n        f14CHF= new Money(14, &quot;CHF&quot;);\n        f28USD= new Money(28, &quot;USD&quot;);\n    }\n}\n\nOnce you have the Fixture in place, you can write as many Test Cases as\nyou&#39;d like.&quot;\n\nThe next section is entitled Test Case.  If you read it, you will see\nthat in this context a test case is an individual method that uses the\nfixture.\n\nIn other words, a TestCase incorporates a fixture, but certainly the two\nare not identical.  You know, just as testing is an essential part of\ntest-driven development, but the two are not the same.\n\nYou may choose to use the term &quot;fixture&quot; for something else.  But in the\nJUnit context, it&#39;s the set of objects that get tested in the test case\nmethods.  Typically these are instantiated and initialized in the setUp()\nmethod.\n\nThe term is also defined in the &quot;setUp&quot; section of\n\thttp://jxcl.sourceforge.net/junit.html\nwith a skeletal example and in the glossary at\n\thttp://jxcl.sourceforge.net/glossary.html\n\n--\nJim Dixon  jdd@...   tel +44 117 982 0786  mobile +44 797 373 7881\n\n\n",
