Create an inner class CarTest that will test this class.\n\n2. in the setUp() method, create a new Car obect and set the\ninternal field to the &quot;test&quot; value. i.e. set the field values \ndirectly.\n\n3. Testing the get method\n\nCall the get method and make sure the &#39;test&#39; value is correctly\nreturned by the get method.\n\n4. Testing the set method\n\nCall the set method with a new value.\nCheck the internal field and verify that the value is the\none specified via set().\n\nI&#39;m interested in opinions/suggestions.\n\nThanks,\n\nRaju\n\n\n\n",
