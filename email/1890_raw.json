No amount of UI, documentation and fancy API can tell you &quot;when&quot;\n&gt;and &quot;why&quot; to test. For that, you need either experience or a coach. I think\n&gt;this mailing list provides the necessary coaching. The XP mailing lists\n&gt;provide even more.\n&gt;\n&gt;J. B.

What follows is my opinion and nothing more.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;JUnit is so simple that there is no need for support of any kind, beyond\n&gt; &gt;this mailing list. I hope that JUnit always stays as simple as it is now,\n&gt; &gt;so that it never needs support.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;That&#39;s the beauty of JUnit: its simplicity.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;I&#39;m inclined to agree... up to a point ;) Using JUnit is a matter of\n&gt;learning a new API - I don&#39;t think that support per se is really needed, at\n&gt;most maybe some classes on how to set up the tests.\n&gt;\n&gt;Why up to a point? Because the api is only the &quot;how&quot; of testing - learning\n&gt;the &quot;when&quot; and &quot;why&quot; is another matter...\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;--\n&gt;\n&gt;                            *   Jim Cheesman   *\n&gt;              Trabajo:\n&gt;jchees@... - (34)(91) 724 9200 x 2360\n&gt;                      Prejudiced\n&gt;people are all alike.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt;junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Your use of Yahoo!
