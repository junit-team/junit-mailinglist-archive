JUnit\nwas not \n&gt; designed to work in this arena, though it does work quite well.\n\nExactly, I&#39;ve come to that same point.  It does work QUITE well,\nin fact, and one tweak to it lets it work perfectly for me, but I\ncan understand it being antithetical to the design.\n\nIn fact, that was what I was first asking, with way too many\nwords: what basic design principle of JUnit am I missing that\nmade it be written in a way that makes what I&#39;m trying to do,\nhard?\n\nI have to admit, I work for a start-up with a very small QA staff (2).\nIn a much larger company, there would be white-box SQA to\nbuild the higher level tests I&#39;m building, but as a small company\ndeveloper, I feel the need to build &#39;programmer tests&#39; that are a\n*lot* more comprehensive in order to make sure the code is\nreally solid before I hand it off.\n\n--  Morgan Schweers\n\n\n",
