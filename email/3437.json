It&#39;s fine but may I ask: do you really need to test your <br/>\nclass with every possibilities?  I don&#39;t think so.  You cannot test <br/>\neverything (imagine if you want to test a drawing program with endless <br/>\npossibilities).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I would do (IMHO):<br/>\n<br/>\n- test the methods OK, NOK and ThrownError with the boundaries and 2/3 <br/>\nvalues (so you know that your class is doing what it should do)<br/>\n- if I really want to test all values of my class, a better way is to <br/>\nstress test it with (not 100% correct for your specifications, but just <br/>\nto give you an idea):<br/>\n<br/>\nfor (int i=-infinite; i&lt;-5; i++) {<br/>\n    try {<br/>\n       if (myClass.f(i) == false)<br/>\n          fail();<br/>\n    } catch (ExpectedException e) {<br/>\n       // fine or not fine, depends on i<br/>\n    } catch (Exception e) {<br/>\n       // not a normal exception<br/>\n       fail();<br/>\n    }<br/>\n}<br/>\n...<br/>\n<br/>\n(so you know that your method is not doing what it should not do)<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause it&#39;s really time consuming you should only do it:<br/>\n-overnight (unless you like to spend time in the cafeteria during the day)<br/>\n- only choose a panel of values to test.<br/>\n<br/>\nI haven&#39;t seen any stress testing extensions, maybe something to implement.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-Vladimir<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nVladimir Bossicard<br/>\nwww.bossicard.com</div>",
