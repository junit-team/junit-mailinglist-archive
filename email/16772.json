I will start not by talking about Agitator, but<br/>\n&gt; about a more general issue: is there a problem with unit testing that<br/>\n&gt; needs solving?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; You write:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; The bottom line is that this is a very interesting product that<br/>\n&gt;&gt; appears to me to be looking for a problem to solve.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I believe that there&#39;s a HUGE and GROWING problem to solve.  My<br/>\n&gt; co-founder (Dr. Roongko Doong, another person who is as passionate<br/>\n&gt; about advancing the state-of-the-art in test automation for 15+<br/>\n&gt; years), started Agitar not because we were looking for something to<br/>\n&gt; do, or make a quick buck (quite the contrary, in 2002 when we started<br/>\n&gt; Agitar I was Senior Director of Software Engineering at Google - if<br/>\n&gt; all I cared about was money I would have stayed put :-)).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Let me be clear.  There was an old joke in the &#39;60s about the Laser  <br/>\nbeing a solution in search of a problem.  I was making an oblique  <br/>\nreference to that old joke, and not a snide remark about  <br/>\ncommercialism.  I think the agitation technology is very cool.  I&#39;m  <br/>\njust wondering what problem it solves.<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree with you that there is a huge and growing problem in software  <br/>\nquality, and that test automation is the solution to that problem.   <br/>\nI&#39;m just perplexed about how Agitar addresses that issue.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; We started<br/>\n&gt; Agitar to solve what I believe is one of the biggest problems in<br/>\n&gt; software development, and one that we are very passionate about:<br/>\n&gt; getting developers to think about and do testing DURING development -<br/>\n&gt; so they can address defects and design problems with maximum<br/>\n&gt; efficiency and minimum impact.  As opposed to the more traditional<br/>\n&gt; &quot;throw the code over the wall to QA&quot; model.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I completely agree that the over-the-wall method is broken.  I think  <br/>\nit&#39;s broken for many reasons.<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Tests are done at the end of the schedule when there&#39;s no time  <br/>\nleft (because all the slack has been eaten up by the developers.)<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Manual tests are very costly, time consuming, and error prone;  <br/>\nespecially when they come at the end and are under schedule pressure.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Tests that come at the end are based on the *current* execution of  <br/>\nthe program rather than on the true requirements.  This is a bizarre  <br/>\nbreak in encapsulation which tends to let the implementation drive  <br/>\nthe requirements.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; My experience at Google, where with others I championed the<br/>\n&gt; introduction of JUnit and the idea of developer testing was very<br/>\n&gt; revealing.  Admittedly, Google is a way off the chart in terms of<br/>\n&gt; programming talent,<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And way off the charts in assisting repressive nations.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; but in the last 4 years I confirmed the very same<br/>\n&gt; findings with 100s of other people and software organizations that<br/>\n&gt; also introduced, or tried to introduce, developer/unit testing:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Here are some of the key things I discovered:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 1) On average, approximately only 30% of developers who are introduced<br/>\n&gt; to xUnit/developer-testing/TDD become test-infected (i.e. the will<br/>\n&gt; continue to do unit testing even if they are not asked to).  The other<br/>\n&gt; 70% will go back to their &quot;old-ways&quot;.  Why is that?  My next points<br/>\n&gt; sheds some light.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 2) Most developer complained that in order to get decent coverage (say<br/>\n&gt; 80-90%) they have to write 3-4 lines of JUnit code for every line of<br/>\n&gt; Java.  They wanted some way to automate the most mundane parts of the<br/>\n&gt; testing effort and retain control of the areas that require human<br/>\n&gt; intelligence, insight, domain-knowledge, and creativity.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 3) Most of the unit tests that actually get written cover only the<br/>\n&gt; normal/&quot;happy&quot; path.  They assume the best of all possible world; that<br/>\n&gt; they would never be passed bad parameters, that all strings would be<br/>\n&gt; nice ASCII code and never exceed some magic length, that all objects<br/>\n&gt; will be well formed and in the state they were expecting, etc.<br/>\n&gt; Needless to say, this is not sufficient for most industrial<br/>\n&gt; applications, especially if they have to survive in hostile<br/>\n&gt; environments where hackers look for every possible deficiency in the<br/>\n&gt; system, or when your colleagues assume that you are going to handle<br/>\n&gt; those null pointers so he does not have to worry about them. On the<br/>\n&gt; other hand, if you want to cover all those contingencies testing<br/>\n&gt; becomes a combinatorial problem and it&#39;s hard for developers to<br/>\n&gt; conceive of and test for everything that should be tested for.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 4) If testing a particular piece of code was too complicated (lots of<br/>\n&gt; dependencies, complicated set-up, lots of things to mock, etc.) the<br/>\n&gt; tests were skipped.  This is human nature. Ideally people would look<br/>\n&gt; at code that&#39;s difficult to test and think re-factoring and (re)design<br/>\n&gt; for testability but most people are not there yet.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 5) Test maintenance was as time consuming as code maintenance.  If<br/>\n&gt; there&#39;s anything that most developers disliked more than writing lots<br/>\n&gt; of test code by hand, was maintaining that code.  One of the most<br/>\n&gt; common unit test maintenance patterns is: delete or comment-out<br/>\n&gt; failing tests.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My solution to all these &quot;problems&quot; is to re-educate the developers  <br/>\nand fire the ones who don&#39;t realize that they can&#39;t release untested  <br/>\ncode.  This seems to me to be a matter of professional ethics.  I  <br/>\nhave no sympathy for whining software developers who don&#39;t want to  <br/>\nwrite tests.  What they are really whining about is that they don&#39;t  <br/>\nwant to be responsible for making their code work.<br/>\n<br/>\nWriting tests first (i.e. true TDD) solves most of the problems  <br/>\nmentioned above except the discipline problem.  Pink slips solve that  <br/>\nproblem.  (I&#39;m dead serious about this.  You don&#39;t test, you don&#39;t  <br/>\nwork. Period.)<br/>\n<br/>\nUsing TDD you can&#39;t write production code unless you write a failing  <br/>\nunit test first.  Thus you will get very high coverage (80-90), and  <br/>\nyou won&#39;t write code that&#39;s hard to test, because you write the tests  <br/>\nfirst.<br/>\n<br/>\nRefactoring solves the test maintenance problem.  Tests are not  <br/>\nsecond class citizens.  They have to be kept to the same standard of  <br/>\ncleanliness and design as production code.  Therefore we refactor  <br/>\nthem to keep them easy to modify.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; So, for someone who believes that developer/unit testing is the right<br/>\n&gt; thing to do - one of the MOST important things to do and do WELL - I<br/>\n&gt; saw a VERY big and VERY definite problem.  Namely: Most developers<br/>\n&gt; want and need help with their testing effort.  Without some help and<br/>\n&gt; automation they will either give up on developer/unit testing or, even<br/>\n&gt; worse because it gives a false sense of security, write some trivial<br/>\n&gt; &quot;happy-path&quot; tests that pass too easily and fail to cover some<br/>\n&gt; critical conditions.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Again, developers who have the attitude that it is OK to give up on  <br/>\ntesting need their attitude readjusted -- and fast!  I have no  <br/>\nproblem with tools to help with this; but the first problem to solve  <br/>\nis the attitude problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, one of my problems with the Agitar tool is that it can&#39;t seem  <br/>\nto see very far into a function.  Therefore the observations it makes  <br/>\nare naive, thus possibly reinforcing the &quot;false sense of security&quot;  <br/>\nyou talked about.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Note that I am not in favor of complete<br/>\n&gt; automation (press a button get some passing tests) unless you need<br/>\n&gt; some quick change detector. I want Agitator to do for software<br/>\n&gt; developers what spreadsheets have done for accountants and business<br/>\n&gt; people: raise the level of abstraction, allow the user to focus on the<br/>\n&gt; important things that require their intelligence and understanding<br/>\n&gt; (e.g. formulae in spreadsheets, test data/assertions in Agitator),<br/>\n&gt; provide a number of other related utilities (e.g. graphs in<br/>\n&gt; spreadsheets, code coverage and code rules and dashboard reports in<br/>\n&gt; Agitator).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I like the code coverage aspects of Agitar.  Some of the graphs and  <br/>\ncharts are very useful.  I have no problems with them at all.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; We could argue whether Agitator helps with some of the problems (I<br/>\n&gt; believe it does since it was designed to address them specifically),<br/>\n&gt; but I don&#39;t think we can argue that there is no problem to be solved<br/>\n&gt; when it comes to developer testing.  Until most developers and<br/>\n&gt; software development organizations practice thorough unit testing on a<br/>\n&gt; consistent basis, we have a problem.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Agreed.  And tool support is important.  Education is even more  <br/>\nimportant.  There is a minimum level of professional ethics involved  <br/>\nhere, and every developer needs to learn it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wear a green wrist band that says &quot;Test First&quot;.  It is a symbol of  <br/>\nmy commitment to this minmium level of professional ethics.  I WILL  <br/>\nTEST MY CODE.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Without JUnit we would not be where we are today.  A 30% test<br/>\n&gt; infection rate is a huge step from what it was before (i.e. ~0%).  But<br/>\n&gt; I refuse believe that we cannot augment and provide developers with<br/>\n&gt; other tools beyond JUnit, and that we are stuck at 30% test infected.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I agree.  And I think JUnit was partially responsible for this.   <br/>\nHowever I also think that the revolution would have happened without  <br/>\nthe tool -- causing the tool to be written anyway.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; There&#39;s work we all have left to do.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; People like you are helping our common cause doing what you do best<br/>\n&gt; and, presumably, like to do best: training, coaching, mentoring,<br/>\n&gt; educating, writing, etc.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Me?  I am a software tool maker.  That&#39;s what I do best, and that&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; what I like to do. That&#39;s the best way I can help the cause.  I<br/>\n&gt; believe that tools are critical to progress, and that the right tools<br/>\n&gt; will enable the right behavior.  Anyone who knows me, or has talked<br/>\n&gt; with me for just a few minutes, knows how passionate I am about<br/>\n&gt; solving this problem (if we agree that there is a problem :-)) and I<br/>\n&gt; also would like to think that in addition to my passion, I bring some<br/>\n&gt; unique experience, skills, and vision to the table.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And I appreciate that!  I think we need more and better tools for  <br/>\nsoftware development.  My problem is that I just don&#39;t know if the  <br/>\nAgitation features of Agitar are really particularly useful.   <br/>\nMoreover I fear a tool that can figure out tests for you may give  <br/>\ndevelopers an excuse not to write their own tests; especially if it  <br/>\nis marketed to managers and developers as a way to reduce unit test  <br/>\nwriting time.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n----<br/>\nRobert C.
