Neither qingfenglin or myself received a <br/>\n&gt; ClassNotFoundException, we received LinkageError&#39;s....<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Good point.  The new FAQ will be more clear on this common problem.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Actually, I don&#39;t mean to be a critic, but the documentation for <br/>\n&gt; J/Unit really sucks. I know, I know... if I don&#39;t like it I should do <br/>\n&gt; better... Well, I&#39;ve only been using J/Unit for a couple of days now <br/>\n&gt; so I&#39;m not prepared yet to write docs. As I get more involved with it <br/>\n&gt; I definately plan on putting together a couple of HOWTO&#39;s.. until <br/>\n&gt; then, I&#39;d just like to say that the docs are horrible. Great product <br/>\n&gt; (from what I&#39;ve seen so far), horrible documentation.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>We&#39;re working on making the FAQ better.  The fact that I&#39;m digging<br/>\nthrough the archives for these nuggets says something.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can help by asking (and answering) questions on this list, and<br/>\nproposing FAQ changes such as you did above.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\n<br/>\nMike</div>",
