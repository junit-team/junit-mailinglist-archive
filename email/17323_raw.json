I don&#39;t =\r\nthink anyone\nneeds to be convinced about this, this is a known fact, one th=\r\nat a lot\nof us believe should change. It is in the conclusions that can be\n=\r\nderived from that where opinions differ. You seem to say that since\nmost so=\r\nftware is not &quot;regularly tested&quot; and most software works great\nyou can abvi=\r\nously do perfectly well without &quot;regular testing&quot;.\n\nMyself and others have =\r\nargued that most software can work better and\nthat our acceptance for error=\r\ns is too high. David Saff also made an\ninteresting comment about all the so=\r\nftware we don&#39;t see, the software\nwe don&#39;t use and the software that is nev=\r\ner released. I think it is\nnatural that popular software used by many works=\r\n great, or it\nwouldn&#39;&#39;t be popular. Popular software can also deferr some t=\r\nesting to\ntheir &quot;beta&quot;-testers and &quot;get away with it&quot;. But that is just a s=\r\nmall\nfraction of all the software written.\n\nI personally think that you are=\r\n way wrong that there is code that is\not tested and works. I think that all=\r\n software out there is tested,\nmeaning some effort has been made to ensure =\r\nthat it works. There are\nhard ways and easy ways to test software. The easy=\r\n way (I think it is\nautomated testing) is the most reliable while the hard =\r\nway requires\nsome guesswork and predictions coupled with manual effort.\n\nI =\r\nfollowed the first link and got a little bit upset by one of your\ntranscrip=\r\ntions of a supposedly rethorical answer:\n\n&quot;One response to the question sug=\r\ngests that there are only two types\nof code: Code that is tested and works =\r\nand code that is not tested and\ndoesn&#39;t work. Cedric&#39;s take on the subject =\r\nis that there are ways of\nknowing that your code is working without actuall=\r\ny testing it. So we\nshould also include a third category: Code that is not =\r\ntested and\nworks.&quot;\n\nThat was your subjective interpretation of what Robert =\r\nC Martin wrote.\nWhen you asked for clarification you asked:\n\n&quot;You seem to i=\r\nmply that there are only two kinds of code:\n\n - Code that is tested and wor=\r\nks\n - Code that is not tested and doesn&#39;t work\n\nThere is actually something=\r\n in the middle: it&#39;s called &quot;Code that\nis not\ntested but that works&quot;.&quot;\n\nTha=\r\nt was the interpretation you used in the blog-entry.\nThe reply came:\n\n&quot;The =\r\ntwo kinds of code are:\n\n- Code you have tested, and you know works to the b=\r\nest of your\nability to determine.\n- Code you have not tested and don&#39;t know=\r\n if it works.\n\nIf you haven&#39;t tested the code, you don&#39;t know that it works=\r\n. If you\nHAVE tested the code then you know that it passes your tests.&quot;\n\n\nW=\r\nhy didn&#39;t you just post the statement as it was written instead of\nyour sub=\r\njective interpretation? Your interpretation sure has more\npunch that the re=\r\nal thing but it is obviously  not what the author\nmeant.\n\nI really admire y=\r\nou taking a stand in this discussion and in this\nforum. A lot of really goo=\r\nd discussion has come out of it and not many\nare so brave as you are to go =\r\nagainst the flow on a board like this.\nBut when you post subjective interpr=\r\netaions like the one above you\nloose credibility, atleast with me. And I th=\r\nink that is a shame\nbecause you obviously have a message that you want to g=\r\net through\nwith. I think your opinions deserves to be listened to and evalu=\r\nated.\n\nI didn&#39;t read the rest of the links or the comments, perhaps somethi=\r\nng\nmore interesting or would have com up there.\n\nJust one mans opinion\n/J\n\n",
