If the developer is\n&gt; experienced, she will produce testable code, whether she uses TDD or not.\n&gt;   \nI&#39;ll agree with the first claim, having produced plenty of testable code \nprior to doing TDD. The more I&#39;ve done TDD--*and* the more I&#39;ve improved \nmy knowledge of what makes a good design--the easier it&#39;s become to \nwrite non-TDD code that was testable.\n\nHowever, the second claim is simply not true. I&#39;ve seen plenty of code \nwritten by &quot;experienced&quot; developers that was not easily testable, even \nthough everyone agreed that it exhibited what they thought was a good \ndesign. That includes some of the non-TDD code I&#39;ve written (even after \nhaving done TDD).\n\nUltimately, there are billions of lines of difficult-to-test code out \nthere, some of it written by extremely experienced programmers. The best \nway to learn how to build testable code--if that&#39;s important to you--is \nto try and write tests for everything. Whether you do that test-first or \ntest-after is up to you (or maybe your team). I find it far easier to do \ntest-first.\n&gt; And as an experienced developer, she will always consider all her options\n&gt; before picking a methodology, which is always more healthy than saying &quot;I do\n&gt; TDD 100% of the time&quot;.\n&gt;   \nMost of the people that believe in TDD try to do it 100% of the time \nbecause they derive a considerable amount of benefit from it (and oddly, \nbecause they enjoy it). As JB mentions, the best tactic for less \nexperienced programmers is to try to do everything TDD. With more \nexperience, perhaps then they could consider backing off of it.\n\nI still try to do it 100%. It&#39;s a goal for me, not an absolute. I derive \na considerable increase in development speed from doing this, so I&#39;m \nbaffled at the continuing claims that it&#39;s &quot;unhealthy&quot; or \n&quot;unprofessional.&quot; It&#39;s also never been at the expense of the customer or \nthe schedule. (It can be, if the developers don&#39;t practice it well, \nsomething I&#39;ve seen in at least one fiasco of a project.) When I back off:\n- I lose some amount of documentation-by-example\n- I don&#39;t always make the best decisions that will allow me to \neffectively test after\n- I lose some ability to easily introduce new functionality in the code\n- I increase my risk level of making a future change that breaks \nsomething elsewhere in the system.\n- I increase the time I spend having to debug the code\n\nBut hey, that&#39;s just me. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s productive to try and \nconvince people that want to continue to make excuses for not doing \nsomething. Programmers need to use their best judgment. For me, I view \ncode that can&#39;t be easily proven to work as ultimately very costly (I \ncould say close to useless, but that would just get people upset).\n\nJeff Langr\n\n-- \nLangr Software Solutions\nhttp://langrsoft.com\nAgile Java: Crafting Code With Test-Driven Development\n\n\n",
