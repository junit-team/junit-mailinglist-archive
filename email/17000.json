What am I missing?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The &quot;too many moving parts&quot; comment was directed at my test code ie I <br/>\nneeded to add too much custom code to the mocks to allow them to talk <br/>\nto each other as required. It is directly attributable to the <br/>\nDocumentum API and the interconnectedness of its many interfaces. It <br/>\nhas nothing to do with the usefulness of jmock etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nMichael Rutherfurd</div>",
