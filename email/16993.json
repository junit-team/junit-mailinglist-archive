I needed<br/>\n&gt; to write some tests around a user belonging to a group.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; I needed at a minimum an implementation of IDfUser and IDfGroup. Due to the<br/>\n&gt; nature of the beast it is most common to get these from the session<br/>\n&gt; (IDfSession). As all of these are interfaces it wasn&#39;t too bad but each of<br/>\n&gt; the interfaces extends others and have several hundred methods each. I<br/>\n&gt; eventually decided that what I was trying to test in this case was<br/>\n&gt; Documentum logic and that I should just trust the framework.<br/>\n&gt;   <br/>\n </span></blockquote>One quick point: a major appeal of JMock, and the other mocking <br/>\nframeworks, as far as I know, is that the number of methods or <br/>\nsuperinterfaces of an interface does not affect the complexity of the <br/>\ntest, just the number of methods used.  However, I also agree that you <br/>\nshouldn&#39;t test the framework, just your own code, as much as possible.  <br/>\nThanks for the clarification,<br/>\n<br/>\n    David Saff</div>",
