Should they be\n&gt; included in production code packages or separated out into their own\n&gt; JUnitTest package?\n\nI write about this extensively in _JUnit Recipes_, chapter 3.\n\n&gt; Also, any JUnit book recommendations?  I saw JUnit.org lists quite a\n&gt; few.  The books are so expensive, so I&#39;m looking to just get one good\n&gt; basic one for now.  \n\nThe e-book version of _JUnit Recipes_ is available now for USD 25 at \nwww.manning.com/rainsberger\n\n &gt; This would include approaches to writing test\n&gt; cases and using things like mock objects.  I notice a new book is\n&gt; coming out soon called JUnit Recipes?  Any advance word on that?  \n\nYes, it is an /excellent/ book. :) (Really, it&#39;s very good. I&#39;m not just \nsaying that because I wrote it.)\n\n&gt; Note\n&gt; that as of now, I&#39;m not using EJB, XML or any goodies like that.  I&#39;m\n&gt; just using the basic java.utils API, though some folks in our group\n&gt; are also using JMS.\n\nSimply skip those parts of _JUnit Recipes_, then come back to them once \nyou need them!\n\nAlso good ones:\n\nJUnit in Action\nTest-Driven Development: By Example\n\nI have been too busy writing a JUnit book to have read the others, so I \ncan&#39;t comment on them. :)\n-- \nJ.
