We&#39;re running our main test suite via the\njunit.textui.TestRunner class.  We&#39;re getting an error &quot;Could not\ninvoke the suite() method.&quot;\n\nOur test class does indeed have a suite() method.  We think this\ntest suite did run at some point prior to some rework to our build\nscript (but we&#39;re not sure).\n\nWe thought it had to be a class path problem, but after staring at\nit for a while, we can&#39;t see any class path problems.\n\nLooking at the source code didn&#39;t help much, since it&#39;s just\ncatching any exception thrown out of the invoke call, we can&#39;t tell\nspecifically what the exception is.\n\nWhat are the typical causes of this error message?  Any and all\nsuggestions greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks in advance,\n-Paul\n\n\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\njunit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n \n\nYour use of Yahoo!
