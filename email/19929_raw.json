B. Rainsberger&quot; &lt;jbrains762@...&gt; \nwrote:\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Under jUnit, I can modify life cicle of the running process in \norder=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; to make tests, why not to let the user to alter also some\n&gt; &gt; configur=\r\nation information for example: classpath (and probably \nit is\n&gt; &gt; possible,=\r\n specifying some class loader mechanism, but I am not an\n&gt; &gt; expert on that=\r\n)\n&gt; \n&gt; Every framework should decide which features are common enough to \nb=\r\nuild \n&gt; into the framework and which features should be implemented \nthroug=\r\nh \n&gt; extensions. No matter which decision the framework makes, someone \nwil=\r\nl \n&gt; think it&#39;s wrong. Since frameworks should be as small as possible, \nit=\r\n \n&gt; makes sense to include only those features we are certain should \nbe th=\r\nere.\n\nIt is true what you say, any way concerning the open-clossed \nprincip=\r\nle the framework (every framework try to acomplish it) should \nbe closed fo=\r\nr modification, but open for extension, as you know for \nsure (also The sel=\r\nfish class article is a good recipe for makeing \ngood frameworks). \n\nI gues=\r\ns jUnit modifies the class loader mechanism. It allows the \nuser to change =\r\nthe start (setup() method) and the end of the process \n(teardown() method).=\r\n Such are the open points on the process. If the \nclass loader mechanism (s=\r\nomething that happen at the begining) is \nmodified, why not to let the user=\r\n to configurate the classpath, \nbecause such modification shouldn&#39;t affect =\r\nthe intention of the test.\n\nA advanced user could expect, following the ope=\r\nn-close principle, to \nallow the user at the begining (open point) to chang=\r\ne the classpath \nthat could affect the whole process of a given testing met=\r\nhod.\n\nThis is my mental process about this problem, that respect the idea \n=\r\nabout what is framework.\n\nThe use of Ant invites to people to go to other f=\r\nramework, for doing \nsomething, that could provide a framework allowing adv=\r\nanced users to \nmodify the class loader mechanism via open-clossed principl=\r\ne in \norder to modify the classpath.\n\nThanks any way for your opinion, it m=\r\nake me think and reflect about \nall this.\n\nDavid\n\n\n\n",
