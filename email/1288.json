It&#39;s an interesting one. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d like to remind that the reason for the name &quot;unit test&quot; is that it<br/>\nrefers to the _scope_ of the components that are being tested, relative to<br/>\nthe entire system.  The term &quot;unit testing&quot; should not imply anything too<br/>\nprescriptive about the strategies employed to test thoroughly at that scope,<br/>\nthough as others have stated, there are guidelines.  In object oriented<br/>\nprogramming the &quot;unit&quot; scope is often a class, but is also often a single<br/>\nmethod or a cluster of closely related classes.  Truly, a program can be<br/>\nbroken into even smaller units - expressions and statements - but everyone<br/>\nagrees this is too granular for testing.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso recall that the test of whether we&#39;ve tested _enough_ should be code<br/>\ncoverage analysis of the component/subsystem/system under test when run<br/>\nagainst our test suite.  If testing all the public and protected methods<br/>\nalso happens to test your private methods and exception handlers thoroughly,<br/>\nthen you&#39;re all set, but you don&#39;t know that unless you have extremely<br/>\nsimple applications, or you are doing coverage analysis.  Anyway, it is<br/>\nunsafe to conclude a priori that public API testing is all that is needed;<br/>\neach situation should determine the tools and strategies used.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have two examples to offer that may help when you&#39;re in a tough situation<br/>\nwhere testing private methods or protected classes.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne is a private field accessor class, the other is a technique.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m attaching the FieldAccessor, which is mainly from Larman and Guthrie&#39;s<br/>\nJava 2 performance and idiom book.  Personally, I have yet to need this<br/>\nclass for anything, but I thought I&#39;d pass it along.  It&#39;s javadoc&#39;ed.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe technique is one that I have found useful at least once, which is to put<br/>\na public static inner class that extends junit.framework.TestCase in the<br/>\nclass under test.  This gives the inner class full access to the outer<br/>\nclass&#39;s private methods and members, while allowing the inner class to be an<br/>\ninstance of a JUnit test case.  I sent an example of this to this list a few<br/>\nweeks ago.  Another handy thing is that when you compile the outer class,<br/>\nthe inner test case is produced in a separate class file which can be safely<br/>\ndeleted when packaging the outer class for production (because the outer<br/>\nclass makes no references to the static inner class).<br/>\n<br/>\nScott Stirling<br/>\nMacromedia<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Jens Andersen<br/>\n<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSent: 5/23/01 4:44 AM<br/>\n<br/>\nSubject: [junit] How to test protected and private methods/ fields?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHi all,<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst of all I have to mention that I&#39;m pretty novice when it comes to<br/>\n<br/>\nuse<br/>\nJUnit for writing unittests. But I have a question which I hope some of<br/>\n<br/>\nyou<br/>\ncan help me with - it&#39;s regarding testing private/protected methods and<br/>\n<br/>\nhow<br/>\nto organize my test package.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst the package. I have read to articles regarding test (&quot;Junit best<br/>\n<br/>\npractices&quot; from JavaWorld and &quot;Incremental development with Ant and<br/>\n<br/>\nJUnit&quot; from developerWorks). In the JBT article Andy Schneider advice you to<br/>\n<br/>\nkeep<br/>\ntests in the same location as the source code. And in the Incremental...<br/>\n<br/>\narticle Malcolm Davis advice you to make a separate package. Which<br/>\n<br/>\napproach is the best to use?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI must admit that I like the idea of making a separate package but then<br/>\n<br/>\nagain - how do I then test private and protected methods? And if I keep<br/>\n<br/>\nthe<br/>\ntests in the same location as the source code - who do I then test<br/>\n<br/>\nprivate methods?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI would very much appreciate if some of you could give me a little<br/>\n<br/>\nexample<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKind regards,<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJ.
