Is this the way to measure\nQuality?...\n\nI would insert my assertions in each test based on class(es)\nresponsibilities. If management wants to know if all the assertions are\ninserted then should possibly review the test manually or if management\nwants to keep an eye on someone then they should develop there own tools to\ndo that. If somebody is not careful enough to put these assertions then he\nis not doing a good job. JUNIT is not for POLICING SUCH things or Junit is\nnot a metric report generator. Its a light-weight framework that you could\nuse it to quickly develop tests and run against your code.\n\nAt the end of the day QUALITY MEANS &quot;HOW MUCH YOU CARE&quot;. You will know HOW\nMUCH YOU CARED when a customer of your product finds a problem or a bug.\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: rainsber@...

My\nfinal words on the subject: if management cares about how many assertions\nthere are, then before long, so will the developers. If you don&#39;t want them\nto care, then you should consider finding a way for management to get the\ninformation they want without counting assertions.\n\nAn interesting discussion. Thanks.\n\nJ.

The developers could care less.  Also, the\ndevelopers didn&#39;t care exactly how many tests were written.  What we wanted\nto know was that we had tested everything that could possibly break.
