Rainsberger &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jbr@...\">jbr@...</a>&gt;&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jbr@...\">jbr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: Digest Number 739<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; A generator could put fail(); in any empty tests very easy.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; But there is a major downside too, especially for regenerating <br/>\n&gt; &gt; tools loke JUnitDoclet. I don&#39;t want to copy/paste half <br/>\n&gt; &gt; a page to this email, please see:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.junitdoclet.org/faq.html#fail_not_default\">http://www.junitdoclet.org/faq.html#fail_not_default</a> <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This is all definitely worth knowing, but my immediate guess is that <br/>\n&gt; the JUnitDoclet user is (re)generating far too many tests at once, <br/>\n&gt; irrespective of whether those tests say fail() or not.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If you mean, that in a non-TDD environment, there are many <br/>\nempty test methods in the beginning, that is true. (The next <br/>\nversion of JUnitDoclet will at least count them and print that<br/>\nnumber as warning.) But as a coach I actually have seen a <br/>\nremarkable thing: <br/>\n<br/>\n  Because it is so easy to write a test _then_ (once there is <br/>\n  a place for it) they get written naturally. Developers know <br/>\n  the importance of tests, the just need help to get started. <br/>\n   <br/>\nA generator is lowering that step, a regenerating tool is helping<br/>\nlater too. (Keeping the structure of the generated tests in <br/>\nsync with the application is very important, I believe. Refactoring <br/>\nis very important too, so the tools should provide help.) <br/>\n<br/>\nAn additional note on generating test skeletons: <br/>\nNot every test can be related to a specific unit of code. In <br/>\nmy experience, often there is a need for some functional <br/>\nTestCases too. This TestCases have to be coded manually.<br/>\n(I just wanted to say that, to prevent some of the usual <br/>\ncomments.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It is important for us to remember our TDD bias. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>BTW: Did you ever consider to generate a test from an empty <br/>\nbut compilable application method? Still the test can be <br/>\n_implemented_ before the tested method does something. <br/>\n <br/>\nRegards,<br/>\n<br/>\nSteffen Gemkow</div>",
