The idea might be totally flawed.<br/>\n<br/>\nGreetings,<br/>\n   Malte<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nyme0987654321 wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; My plan for desktop running was to have a seperate IDEA run<br/>\n&gt; configuration that sets the system parameter, so developers can always<br/>\n&gt; pick which one to run.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Regarding using a custom runner, I&#39;m not sure how your suggestion<br/>\n&gt; differs from what I am doing. I suppose we could start looking at a<br/>\n&gt; custom Request object that returns a runner that is never intended to<br/>\n&gt; be used with the @RunWith annotation, but rather delegates run<br/>\n&gt; building on each class. But I&#39;m not sure that IDEA or ant support a<br/>\n&gt; custom Request object, or how you would get them to use it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, Malte Finsterwalder &lt;malte@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;&gt; yme0987654321 wrote:<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; In answer to your second question, basically the slow tests would run<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; at check in, or during the general build process, whereas the fast<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; test would just be part of the TDD of making sure everything is green.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; For point of comparison, the slow tests are currently 1/2 hour for<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; less than 100, and the fast tests are under 60 seconds, even though<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; there are about 700 of them.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; I understand that reasoning.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; But as you said you want to have several categories:<br/>\n&gt;&gt; DB-Tests, In Container Tests, ...<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Maybe you should create a runner hat can be parameterized to handle all<br/>\n&gt;&gt; these cases?<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; And how do you setup the runtime, so that it does run the tests or does<br/>\n&gt;&gt; not run the tests on a per run basis?<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Setting a system property seams cumbersome to me.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; That&#39;s ok for the server, but sometimes I want to run the slow tests on<br/>\n&gt;&gt; my desktop too, don&#39;t I?<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Maybe we can come up with something better?<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Greetings,<br/>\n&gt;&gt;    Malte<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
