But since we&#39;re already in this territory<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure we moved away from the original topic.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe original poster was basically asking &quot;I don&#39;t like writing tests, I<br/>\ndon&#39;t always to test driven design, is it bad?&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe traditional answer to this question on this mailing-list is &quot;Yes&quot; and &quot;I<br/>\ndo 100% TDD and it works great, what&#39;s wrong with you?&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy experience differs.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t always do TDD and I claim that very few people do.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt doesn&#39;t mean that their software is worthless or that they are bad<br/>\ndevelopers.  As you very insightfully point out, the taste for testing is<br/>\nvery personal.  Some people love it.  Some people hate it.  Most people<br/>\ndon&#39;t feel very strongly either way, but they do have customers, deadlines<br/>\nand inflexible bosses to respond to.  And I think it&#39;s our duty to listen to<br/>\nthem and help them out.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll just repeat what I said in my previous email:  most of the software out<br/>\nthere is 1) not tested and 2) works great.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d like everybody to reflect on that for a while before I send my next<br/>\nmessage...<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nCédric<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://testng.org\">http://testng.org</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>",
