I ended up having to write separate class=\r\nes to get all the tests done.\n\nThanks again,\n\nCheers,\n\njim\n\n\n--- In junit@y=\r\nahoogroups.com, &quot;Bob Runstein&quot; &lt;rrunstein@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In juni=\r\nt@yahoogroups.com, &quot;cant_jim&quot; &lt;jimcant@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; How can I capture t=\r\nhe standard output of test? I need to check that\n&gt; the messages from the cl=\r\nass I&#39;m testing are correct. For example if my\n&gt; class class calls a parser=\r\n that print &quot;invalid input at line xx&quot; when it\n&gt; fails, I want to be able g=\r\no catch that output and compare it to the\n&gt; expected value. If it could be =\r\ndirected to a file on a per-test basis, I\n&gt; could do a diff to check it.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Any suggestions would be appreciated.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Jim Can=\r\nt\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; You can override the default behavior of System.out.println() us=\r\ning\n&gt; System.setOut(PrintStream).  Subclass PrintStream and override the pr=\r\nint\n&gt; methods to log to a file that you can specify.  Even better, add a\n&gt; =\r\nStringBuilder member with setter and getter to the PrintStream and\n&gt; overri=\r\nde the print methods to append to that.  Your test can do\n&gt; assertEquals on=\r\n your expected value and the toString value of the\n&gt; StringBuilder.  Don&#39;t =\r\nforget to reset the PrintStream before each test.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n",
