I don&#39;t think (especially with days delay) there is\nmuch point my trying to argue all points at once, it is too out of synch.\n\n\tI think the points (one by one) that need to get agreed or dismissed are:\n\n\t1) Are test suites (as collections of tests, which have some\n\thierarchical/run order effect) are a &quot;second place&quot; to manage relationship\n\tbetween testcases? Since managing in two places is always flawed, are\nsuites\n\tflawed? [If I refactor testcases I might forget to refactor the suites, and\n\tthat is where errors creep in.]\n\t2) Are test suites becoming obsoleted by &quot;brute force collectors&quot;? How\nwould\n\twe know other than a user survey?\n\t3) If &quot;suites&quot; have outlived their purpose, why are they the &quot;framework&quot;\nway\n\tto manage run order?\n\t4) Does &quot;run order/dependency&quot; (not side-effect dependency) have any\n\tvalue -- despite it&#39;s smell?\n\t5) Is &quot;run order&quot; something that ought be in the framework, however it is\n\timplemented.\n\nregards\n\nAdam\n\n\n",
