The tasks of\ncreate, populate, add, testAllAttributes of all items i=\r\ns very\ntediously.\nI looking for a way for do this with less effort. In the =\r\nInternet I\ncan&#39;t find patterns examples for this kind of problem, honestly =\r\nI\nfound no one example code of test patterns.\n\n(Sorry about the bad English=\r\n and thanks about some help)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
