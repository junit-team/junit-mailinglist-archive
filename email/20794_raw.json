I just want that doYourOneTimeSetu=\r\np() would be run once\n&gt; &gt; for ANY suite that run. doYourOneTimeSetup() will=\r\n startup\n&gt; &gt; microcontainer. Parameters to it doesn&#39;t changdes.\n&gt; \n&gt; Can yo=\r\nu define doYourOneTimeSetup in a superclass of the suites, and\n&gt; have all o=\r\nf your suites inherit from it?\nI don&#39;t actually understand your question. D=\r\no you mean to define some\nBaseEJBTest class with \n\n@BeforeClass\npublic stat=\r\nic void setUpClass();\n?\n\nAll test classes will inherit from this class. In =\r\nthis cases, however,\nBaseEJBTest.setUpClass() will be called for all test c=\r\nlass in the\nsuite. This is actually what I did. There is work-around, namel=\r\ny, to\nuse Bootstrap.getInstance().isStarted() to determine whether this is\n=\r\nfirst call to this method or not. \nPerhaps, you meant to use something like=\r\n this\n&gt; @RunWith(Suite.class)\n&gt; @SuiteClasses(A.class, B.class)\n&gt; public cl=\r\nass MySuite {\n&gt; @BeforeClass public static void doYourOneTimeSetup() {}\n&gt; @=\r\nAfterClass public static void doYourOneTimeTeardown() {}\n&gt; }\n?\nFirst of all=\r\n, until recently I wasn&#39;t aware of this opportunity.\nSecond of all, it is q=\r\nuite verbose and not very flexible.\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Choosing individual methods to ru=\r\nn\n&gt; &gt;&gt; from the command line or Eclipse is fairly simple, but mixing and\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; matching methods from multiple classes takes a fair amount of magic.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; Do you find yourself wanting to do this often? (I usually am either\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\nrunning a whole suite, one class in the suite, or one method).\n&gt; &gt; When I w=\r\nrite some code or fix the bug I usually want to run some\n&gt; &gt; subgroup of th=\r\ne test suite. I should split up my suite to the smaller\n&gt; &gt; one, I know, bu=\r\nt I couldn&#39;t to do it easily and, in fact, architecture\n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t want to d=\r\no it.\n&gt; \n&gt; So the suite that you want to run often involves one method, but=\r\n not\n&gt; all, from class A, and one method, but not all, from class B?  I&#39;m\n&gt;=\r\n sorry to ask the same question again, but I couldn&#39;t parse your answer\n&gt; (=\r\nnot enough coffee yet).\n&gt; \nUsually I want to run 2,3 or 10 method from some=\r\n class A. Typical use\ncase is the following (after I finished to write unit=\r\n test and I want\nto refactor the code&#92;improve the code&#92;find bug in producti=\r\non). \n1. Run all test classes that cover the method to change. Usually it i=\r\ns\n one class (this has a drawback to have huge test classes).\n2. Figure out=\r\n what test method has failed (after I made a change, I am\nnot describing a =\r\nprocess of refactoring in detail here). Usually all\nthese methods belongs t=\r\no one familiar that under normal circumstances\nwill be in different class. =\r\n\n3. Rerun only those methods.\n4. Make a change to test method&#92;method and re=\r\nrun those methods, test\nmethods that failed, one particular test method, ba=\r\nsed on what is best\nfeet in this case. \n\nI hope this helps. \n\n\n",
