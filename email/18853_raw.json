OCL is easier for business\nusers, but we still get the java performance.\n\nThen it&#39;s just a matter of adding more test generation\ntemplates for design validation.\n\nI hope to have a proof of concept soon.  Just need\nanother 48 hours in the day :-)\n\nCheers,\n- Ole\n\n\n\n--- &quot;James P. Gunderson&quot; &lt;jgunders@...&gt;\nwrote:\n\n&gt; All;\n&gt; \n&gt; In our shop, we do not do Test Driven Design (gasp!,\n&gt; Heretic! Burn them! \n&gt; :-). So, separating test and design is all to the\n&gt; good. We have a well \n&gt; established design methodology, and (relatively\n&gt; good) tool support for \n&gt; design.\n&gt; \n&gt; Where I see the biggest lack of support in testing\n&gt; tools is a formal, \n&gt; semi-automated way to generate test stubs for\n&gt; requirements checking. I \n&gt; would love to be able to extract from a structured\n&gt; requirements document \n&gt; and generate a slew of test stubs for those\n&gt; requirements. I just got bit \n&gt; in the butt today, by an untested class invariant:\n&gt; it was specified in \n&gt; the design docs, but never implemented in the test\n&gt; code. (Bad Programmer \n&gt; - no biscuit!)  We&#39;ve been playing around with the\n&gt; notion of a tool to \n&gt; read the structured English requirements, and\n&gt; automatically extract the \n&gt; test stubs, but haven&#39;t had the time to make any\n&gt; real progress.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I agree that there are at least two large\n&gt; stake-holders on the JUnit \n&gt; group, those who do test driven DESIGN, and those\n&gt; who do test driven \n&gt; DEVELOPMENT, and I think that both need to be\n&gt; supported.\n&gt; \n&gt; Jim\n&gt; J. B. Rainsberger wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m beginning to wonder whether we should have\n&gt; separate design and\n&gt; &gt; testing tools. This seems to be a serious source\n&gt; of contention among\n&gt; &gt; programmers: we call it testing, but we mean\n&gt; design, and when we do\n&gt; &gt; design, testing is a secondary consideration, and\n&gt; yet testing is important.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Rather than repackaging TDD and calling it BDD,\n&gt; hoping that Sapir-Whorf\n&gt; &gt; will save us from our own sloppiness, maybe it&#39;s\n&gt; time for separate tools\n&gt; &gt; for design and testing. I have no idea how that\n&gt; would work, but perhaps\n&gt; &gt; it would help us all get along.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; So I&#39;d like a way to separate my design and\n&gt; testing activities when I do\n&gt; &gt; TDD. For example, when I test-drive behavior that\n&gt; doesn&#39;t yet exist, I&#39;m\n&gt; &gt; almost always designing; but when I fill in the\n&gt; holes by adding a test\n&gt; &gt; for a case that should already pass, I&#39;m testing.\n&gt; Perhaps it would be\n&gt; &gt; better to separate those somehow.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Any ideas?\n&gt; &gt; -- \n&gt; &gt; J.
