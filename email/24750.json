In the order which I would try first.<div>Maybe you can address the problem on the infrastracture-level, as Lothar suggested. (Copy the DB etc.)</div><div>Mechanisms like Docker-Container might help here, too!</div><div>You might be able to execute your tests in a transaction, which is then rolled back at the end of the test.<br></div><div>You may be able to just add testdata to the DB and don&#39;t worry about it, since it does not harm other tests.</div><div>You may be able to separate all new testdata from the data that is present, so that you can remove it safely (i.e. IDs in certain ranges etc.)</div><div>And if all else fails, I also reacted a mechanism in a project before, that remembered all the test data created during a test and removed it individually in a teardown, but that&#39;s a lot of work and rather fragile.
