The only difference here is that I am on Win2K<br/>\nplatform.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, there you can find a src.jar in your JUnit directory so even you can<br/>\ncompile the files yourself.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, I would suggest you find out what exactly is wrong, as your<br/>\nsituation seems to be too strange to be a junit problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nShane<br/>\n<br/>\nTim Magnussen wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Hi there. I&#39;m quite new to JUnit and Java but have used the C++<br/>\n&gt; equivalent for some time.<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m using JDK 1.3.1 for Linux.<br/>\n&gt; The junit package is downloaded and installed it on my local filesystem.<br/>\n&gt; Two things:<br/>\n&gt; 1) The junit documentation tells you to include junit.jar in<br/>\n&gt; CLASSPATH, but apparently javac for 1.3.1 is indifferent to CLASSPATH<br/>\n&gt; and I could only make it work by specifying &quot;javac -classpath<br/>\n&gt; ~/blabla/junit.jar&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; 2)The junit.jar file is apparently compiled especially for JDK 1.2.2 -<br/>\n&gt; alas I could not compile with javac. I found out that &quot;oldjavac&quot; and<br/>\n&gt; &quot;oldjava&quot; did work and so I&#39;m using them instead but this seems like a<br/>\n&gt; wrong way to solve things.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I think all these problems could be solved with a junit.jar that is<br/>\n&gt; compiled for 1.3.1 but haven&#39;t been able to find one. Is anyone aware<br/>\n&gt; of a place where one can download this?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks<br/>\n&gt; /Tim<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
