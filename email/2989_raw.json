If \nyou want to see something more than just dots ..........F.....F.... \nlike behaviour - if that is what your question is - I would recommend \nto extend the TestRunner class and use it. Serach through this class \nto see which method you would like to override to get the output the \nway you want. I dont want to give a complete solution and you may use \nyour own judgement to decide what is best suited for you.\n\n- Nilesh\n\n--- In junit@y..., Eric Vought &lt;evought@q...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; You can also add logging to your code. We have a testcase which\n&gt; automatically collects and organizes the log output from the\n&gt; class-under-test. You can just tail the log file or add some\n&gt; code to the GUI testrunner to display it. Apache/Jakarta has a nice\n&gt; logging system. We also have our own package \n(http://qcijutils.qlue.com)\n&gt; whcih includes a LoggerTestCase base class. If you use our package,\n&gt; check out the latest source. LoggerTestCase is not in the last \nbinary jar.\n&gt; \n&gt; On Mon, 15 Oct 2001, Chris Eppstein wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; We send this kind of info to stdout on my project. A better \nabstraction\n&gt; &gt; would be very nice so that which ever runner is used it could be \ndisplayed\n&gt; &gt; as appropriate in that environment.... I know that JsUnit \nprovides this with\n&gt; &gt; a debug() method but I haven&#39;t seen anything like this for JUnit.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Chris\n&gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; &gt; From: Daniel Reynes [mailto:daniel.reynes@t...]\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Monday, October 15, 2001 2:36 AM\n&gt; &gt; To: Junit\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [junit] Writing a text in TestRunner\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hello,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; During my test with TestRunner, I would like to write something \nin the\n&gt; &gt; result panel so that I can see the progression of the tests.\n&gt; &gt; Is there a kind of Assert.. which can do this, without stopping \ntests ?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thank you in advance\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Dan\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; &gt; junit-unsubscribe@y...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
