(I&#39;m also coming from a different language.)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What I&#39;m about to describe could potentially be done continuously, but it is drifting away from Unit testing into Integration/Story testing that I would do e.g. every day, or every week.<br/>\n&gt; Say I have a method that outputs an object of type MyClass.<br/>\n&gt; I have a version of this method in production, and I know it outputs an acceptable object.<br/>\n&gt; When I have a release candidate, I would like to calculate the object with the new code and compare against the object calculated with the production code, ideally according to a user-defined tolerance for floats.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Let&#39;s say I have an integration test which simply calculates the value and performs some intrinsic tests on the output.<br/>\n&gt; I would imagine that with some generic, recursive reflection and persistence it would be possible to extend JUnit so that I can just add one line to my integration test, so that<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 1. if the test is run in &quot;integration mode&quot;, that line is ignored<br/>\n&gt; 2. if the test is run in &quot;regression_base mode&quot; against production, it persists the output value (expected) somewhere<br/>\n&gt; 3. if the test is run in &quot;regression_compare&quot; mode, it loads back the expected and automatically and generically compares it against the actual that I already have in memory at that point<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; and this would work for an arbitrary object of an arbitrary type, without requiring the test writer to write anything else. Something like this<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; public class MyClassTest extends RegressionTest {<br/>\n&gt;   @Test<br/>\n&gt;   public void myIntegrationTest() {<br/>\n&gt;     MyClass myOutput = Whatever.StoryTest();<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;     // This is a standard assertion, part of the story test.<br/>\n&gt;     // It always gets executed.<br/>\n&gt;     assertTrue(&quot;A reasonable amount&quot;, output.GetAmount() &lt; 50);<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;     // This does something different depending on what &quot;mode&quot; the test is running in.<br/>\n&gt;     // The last argument is the tolerance for float comparisons<br/>\n&gt;     assertNoRegression(&quot;Regression-testing myOutput&quot;, myObject, 10e-2);<br/>\n&gt;   }<br/>\n&gt; }<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Do you think this can be achieved in Java? Perhaps something has already been done?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thank you<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
