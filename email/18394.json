[:)]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Second one: If you use XML just as a example and the real &quot;Graph<br/>\n&gt; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory</a>&gt; &quot; objects is of other king,<br/>\n&gt; than I think in parsers - well, let me explain:<br/>\n&gt; You have a &quot;Graph&quot; of objects, this mean that you have one object<br/>\n&gt; connected in other and this object connected in other and so on.<br/>\n&gt; Probably you need access some object in this &quot;Graph&quot;; when is needed<br/>\n&gt; access this object you will have chance to test it . A example is more<br/>\n&gt; explanatory:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Suppose I will access a budget object; a real budget will have a lot of<br/>\n&gt; objects connected to it, this is a &quot;Graph&quot;. Make a test to know if the<br/>\n&gt; root object is correct, check yours attributes and no more. Right now I<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t care about others objects in this &quot;Graph&quot;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Suppose now that I need access some product inside of the list product.<br/>\n&gt; This will use the first code - a kind of service; I know that I have the<br/>\n&gt; correct budget, now I need know if this budget have the correct first<br/>\n&gt; product - now I need access it. I will make a test to know if this<br/>\n&gt; product is correct.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In this explanation I make unitary test step-by-step, walking on the<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Graph&quot; when needed.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I expected that you have understood what I want tell. My paper will be<br/>\n&gt; more clear.
