I was approaching it from a more general\nperspective.  I wasn&#39;t even assuming Java.\n\n&gt; Hmm, in this I guess I&#39;m assuming that this thing&#39;s state is easy to\n&gt; examine after deserializing.\n\nI would think that an assertEquals test should be adequate.  Maybe\neven an assertSame test if there is caching involved.\n\n&gt; If that&#39;s not the case for some reason, then I think you&#39;d also want\n&gt; to think about why that&#39;s the case before just going with examining \n&gt; serialization files.\n\nAgreed.\n\n&gt; &gt; Yes.  Agreed.  But try to avoid using a file to do it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Definitely.  Another poster (was it you, Dave?)\n\nI believe so.\n\n&gt; suggested that String streams are the way to go, and I agree with \n&gt; that.  If you need to share these things between tests, make them \n&gt; fixtures and share them that way.\n\nYes.  But all you can share is the initial state... there should be no\neffects from one test on another.\n\nDave\n\n\n",
