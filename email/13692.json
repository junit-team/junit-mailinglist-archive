I can&#39;t recall any of these people being very confused <br/>\nabout the difference between a failure (one of your assertions failed) and <br/>\nan error (something else went wrong).  Nor can I recall anyone having much <br/>\ndifficulty grasping the concept of setUp() as a place for common code that <br/>\ngets run right before each test method.  You don&#39;t have to like them, but <br/>\nthese are not hard concepts.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, I don&#39;t pretend to know how everyone out there is using JUnit.  But <br/>\nwith XP-style development the only situations I can think of where you would <br/>\nsuddenly get 100 errors OR failures that you needed to parse through are:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Lots of your &quot;unit&quot; tests really depend on some fragile/unreliable <br/>\nexternal resource (bad)<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Many tests are tightly coupled and are exercising the same lines of code <br/>\n(bad)<br/>\n<br/>\n3) Someone made a LOT of edits in between test runs (bad)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe strength of JUnit lies not in its reporting capabilities, but in the <br/>\nease with which you can move seamlessly--almost effortlessly--between <br/>\nwriting tests, writing code, and running tests to check your assumptions and <br/>\nmeasure your progress.<br/>\n<br/>\nJeff Nielsen<br/>\nDigital Focus<br/>\nwww.digitalfocus.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\nFrom: &quot;Cedric Beust&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cbeust@...\">cbeust@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI have always found the difference between ERROR and FAILURE confusing and I<br/>\nbet that except for JUnit experts such as yourself, nobody can really<br/>\nexplain it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAssuming that it&#39;s important to know whether a test failed because of an<br/>\nassert of an unexpected exception (a dubious proposition in the first place<br/>\nsince when a test fails, you are going to check out the stack trace anyway<br/>\nand find out exactly where it failed), it would certainly have been better<br/>\nto name them differently.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;and&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is certainly an improvement over the current JUnit behavior, but I<br/>\nstill find that:<br/>\n<br/>\n101 TESTS, 1 FAILURE, 100 SKIPPED<br/>\n<br/>\nis much clearer... </span></blockquote></div>",
