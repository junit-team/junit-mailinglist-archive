Testing trumps encapsulation\n\nAgreed.\n\n&gt;    However, if I can cover (as measured with a coverage tool) the\n&gt;    private methods by calling public methods, I will do that rather than\n&gt;    test the private methods explicitly.\n\nDoesn&#39;t this implicitly imply that unit testing is optional, since you can\nachieve the same goal with functional tests?\n\nFunctional tests are here for the user&#39;s comfort, unit tests are here for\nthe programmer&#39;s comfort.  Sure, my coverage can tell me that a certain part\nof my application is tested indirectly, but if I don&#39;t have unit tests for\nthem, locating the bug will be harder for me since there will be multiple\nsuspects for the location of the bug.\n\nConsider the following example:  I have to display a sorted list in a web\npage, and I only have a functional test that verifies that the HTML is\ncorrect.  My coverage confirms that my ordering logic is run during the\ntests.  In this situation, the ordering logic is private and not directly\ntested.\n\nA user reports that the list is not sorted correctly, and now I find myself\nwith at least two possible locations to investigate:  the HTML generation\nand the sorting logic.\n\nIf I had written a test for the private sorting logic, I would know right\naway where the bug is.\n\n-- \nCedric\nhttp://testng.org\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
