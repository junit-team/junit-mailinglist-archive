Make these separate tests,<br/>\npossibly in separate TestCase classes.  Change your tests to look for<br/>\n*separate* data so that failures in the deletion test do not conflict<br/>\nwith the insert test.  As an aside, save yourself some trouble and use<br/>\ndata in your Unit Tests that is also different from your Dev or<br/>\nTesting data.  The last thing you want is for records you inserted<br/>\nduring your development to conflict with your automated unit tests.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you find yourself in a situation where you *can&#39;t* refactor them to<br/>\nbe non-interdependant, then reconsider what you&#39;re testing, and see if<br/>\nthe two dependant tests are really one test.  In many insert/delete<br/>\nsituations, I don&#39;t really care that the database changed but that the<br/>\nexpectations of my API hold.  I&#39;ll leave it to the database developers<br/>\nover at MySQL to make sure it does its job successfully.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes that help?<br/>\n<br/>\n-Kevin  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Fri, 25 Feb 2005 12:16:23 -0800 (PST), k m &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:raca200x@...\">raca200x@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hello,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; A colleague and myself are beginning to implement JUnit tests. We are facing a dilemma that I hope you can help us with. How are dependent unit tests handled?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; For example, there are 2 independent methods that must be tested, but to test them and clean-up they become dependent. So, the methods are addRecordToDB() and deleteRecordFromDB(). Additionally, addRecordToDB() will fail if the record already exists in the database.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; To test that addRecordToDB() can add a new record, testAddRecordToDB() must ensure that the record does not already exist, which relies on a deleteRecordFormDB() message in setUp().<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; To test that deleteRecordFromDB() can delete an existing record, testDeleteRecordFromDB() must ensure that the record already exists in the database, which relies on an addRecordToDB() in setUp().<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; To test that addRecordToDB() fails if the record already exists, testAddRecordToDBDuplication() must ensure that either<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; - the record does not already exist, which relies on deleteRecordFromDB() in setUp() and 2 addRecordToDB() messages in the test method OR<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; - the record already exists, which relies on 1 addRecordToDB() message in setup() and 1 addRecordToDB() message in the test Method<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; These same issues also affect the tearDown() method.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Generically stated, should a test method&#39;s setUp() and tearDown() rely on an untested method? If not, how can we avoid it? Is there a way to enforce the sequence of test method runs?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Any advice would be appreciated.
