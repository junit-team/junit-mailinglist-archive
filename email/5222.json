Indeed, it wasn&#39;t as clear as I intended.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s another attempt at that FAQ.  I&#39;ve chosen to test some IO classes <br/>\nthat can possibly throw checked exceptions.  This demonstrates that <br/>\nunexpected checked exceptions are declared in the &#39;throws&#39; clause of the <br/>\ntest method.  It also tries to clarify what happens when unchecked <br/>\nexceptions are raised.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs this clearer?<br/>\n<br/>\n----<br/>\n<br/>\nQ: What&#39;s the difference between a failure and an error?<br/>\n<br/>\nA:<br/>\n<br/>\nAssertions are used to check for the possibility of failures, therefore failures are anticipated.  Errors are unanticipated problems resulting in uncaught exceptions being propagated from a JUnit test method. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the following example, the FileNotFoundException is expected and checked with an assertion.  If the expected exception is not raised, then a failure is produced.  If any other unexpected IOException or unchecked exception (e.g. NullPointerException) is raised, the JUnit framework catches the exception and signals an error. \t<br/>\n<br/>\n    public void testNonexistentFileRead() throws IOException {<br/>\n        try {<br/>\n<br/>\n            File file = new File(&quot;doesNotExist.txt&quot;);<br/>\n            FileReader reader = new FileReader(file);<br/>\n            assertEquals(&#39;a&#39;, (char)reader.read());<br/>\n\t\t\t<br/>\n            fail(&quot;Should have thrown FileNotFoundException&quot;);<br/>\n\t<br/>\n        } catch (FileNotFoundException success) {}<br/>\n    }   <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the following example, an IOException is not expected.  The JUnit framework will signal an error if an IOException (e.g. FileNotFoundException) or any unchecked exception (e.g. NullPointerException) is raised. \t<br/>\n<br/>\n    public void testExistingFileRead() throws IOException {<br/>\n<br/>\n        File file = new File(&quot;exists.txt&quot;);<br/>\n        FileReader reader = new FileReader(file);<br/>\n\t\t\t<br/>\n        assertEquals(&#39;a&#39;, (char)reader.read());<br/>\n    }<br/>\n<br/>\nBoth failures and errors will cause the test to fail.  However, it is useful to differentiate between failures and errors because the debugging process is slightly different.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the first example, the use of fail() will not generate a complete stack trace including the method that raised the exception.  In this case that&#39;s sufficient since we anticipate that the exception will be raised.  If it&#39;s not raised, then it&#39;s a problem with the test itself.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the second example,  the JUnit framework catches the exception and generates an error with a complete stack trace for the exception.  Since we don&#39;t expect this exception to be raised, a complete stack trace is useful in debugging why it was raised.<br/>\n<br/>\n----<br/>\n<br/>\nMike<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
