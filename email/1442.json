The common approach seems to be to <br/>\n    &gt; gather<br/>\n    &gt; &gt; all the tests for a given class in one test class.  <br/>\n    &gt; What about the<br/>\n    &gt; &gt; scenario type of tests?  Organized by use case?  What <br/>\n    &gt; communicates<br/>\n    &gt; &gt; better, especially if we want to use the tests as documentation?<br/>\n    &gt; &gt; <br/>\n    &gt; <br/>\n    &gt; Usually I organize functional tests by subsystem/useCase.<br/>\n    &gt; <br/>\n    &gt; Regards,<br/>\n    &gt; <br/>\n    &gt; David<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think the organization depends on your browsing capabilities (i.e. using<br/>\nan IDE or not, what IDE you are using, etc.) mainly because if it isn&#39;t too<br/>\ncumbersome to break the tests out of production code locations, go ahead and<br/>\ndo it.  I use VAJ for all of my Java development (at home and at work).<br/>\nBecause of VAJ&#39;s extremely easy-to-use browser, I never mix tests with<br/>\nproduction code.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I have com.foobar.parsers.xyz I would have a unit test package that maps<br/>\none-to-one: com.foobar.parsers.xyz.tests.  If there are functional tests to<br/>\ngo with these classes they would be in<br/>\ncom.foobar.parsers.xyz.functionaltests.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have actually split things up a little more where I work for the sake off<br/>\ntime-to-run-tests.  If there are tests that are functional in nature but<br/>\ntake more than 50 - 60 seconds to run we put them in<br/>\ncom.foobar.parsers.xyz.quickfunctionaltests whereas the longer (most likely<br/>\nfull system) tests would be in the aforementioned<br/>\ncom.foobar.parsers.xyz.functionaltests.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Jason</div>",
