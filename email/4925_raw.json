If you&#39;ve heard of it or used\nit, it&#39;s an App Server / EJB Container.   Dynamo&#39;s entire framework is\nbased off this component known as Nucleus, which does a lot of work in\nterms of instantiating classes, setting properties, etc..  It&#39;s also\nvery slow and to test - build - test takes forever if I have to start\nand stop the app-server for every change in the code. \n\nThat&#39;s where MockObjects come in.  Dynamo is a very Java Beans heavy\nframework, that relies a lot on setters and getters.  ( In fact, the\nMockObjects guys at SF have started putting together some Dynamo\nMockObjects. ) I was looking into MockObjects as a way to lessen my\nreliance on the Nucleus namespace so that I could code quickly and\nonly integrate with the Nucleus namespace at the latest possible time.\n\nHowever, I can&#39;t get my head around the fact that in certain cases my\nmock code will need to generate other mock code \n\nHere&#39;s a method from a piece of old code that I wrote before I decided\nto start using JUnit:\n\n    public  Map generateEmptyPreferencesMap( Map m ) throws\nRepositoryException {\n\n\t// get the list of possible preferences\n\tRepositoryView contactMethodView = getPreferencesRepository().getView(\nCONTACT_METHOD_REPOSITORY_ITEM );\n\tRepositoryItem[] contactMethods = contactMethodView.executeQuery(\ncontactMethodView.getQueryBuilder().createUnconstrainedQuery() );\n\t\n\tif ( ( contactMethods != null ) && ( contactMethods.length &gt; 0 ) )  {\n\t    // add each one to the map\n\t    for ( int i = 0 ; i &lt; contactMethods.length ; i++ ) {\n\t\tm.put( contactMethods[i].getPropertyValue(\nCONTACT_METHOD_CODE_PROPERTY_NAME ), new BooleanPlaceHolder() );\n\t    }\n\t}\n     return m;\n    }\n     \n\nThe Repository API is Dynamo&#39;s object-oriented data abstraction api. \nIn this case, I assume I would setPreferencesRepository( new\nMyMockRepository()  )\n\nbut that MockRepository needs to return a MockRepositoryView which in\nturn needs to return a MockQueryBuilder, or so I seem to believe.\n\nIn a sentence:  how would one test this?  \n\nAs before,\nAny and all help is greatly appreciated.\n\nI apologize for any unnecessary lengthiness.\n\nThanks,\n\nAadi\n\n--- In junit@y..., Bob Koss &lt;koss@o...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; It would help if you&#39;d tell us what the problem is instead of presenting\n&gt; your solution of the problem as the problem.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve never needed mocks inside of mocks - it doesn&#39;t even make sense.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n\n",
