With this feature many nice ways to do thing become possible. Therefore I am wondering if other people agree that it might be time for a JUnit5 putting this new feature to good use.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; A source for inspiration for me in this regard are the FunSuite of ScalaTest <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.scalatest.org/getting_started_with_fun_suite\">http://www.scalatest.org/getting_started_with_fun_suite</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; There a test definition is a method call (instead of a method definition in JUnit) that registers a test for execution. It looks roughly like this:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; class MyTestClass{<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;     test(&quot;The test name&quot;){<br/>\n&gt;         // the actual test goes here <br/>\n&gt;     }<br/>\n&gt; }<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; With this approach things like Rules become extremly trivial, since all you have to do is wrap the code block (i.e. closure) in a new new code block. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Also parameterized test become fairly easy, because you would just put the call to test in a loop.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What do you think? Is this an interesting direction for JUnit to go?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; kind regards <br/>\n&gt; Jens<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
