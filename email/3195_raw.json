There is an example in the FAQ but I couldn&#39;t find\n&gt; out, how to get it running.\n\nThe rationale of the system is that each test must be independent of others.\nThat&#39;s why setUp() and tearDown() are called for each single test case. Why\ndo you want to setUp and tearDown your text fixture only once?\n\nAnyway, if you really want to do this you can do either of these two ugly\nthings:\n\n- Write your own testSetUp() method as the first test method in the class\nand testTearDown() as the last test method in the class. Pretty ugly, but it\nshould work. I didn&#39;t try it myself, so I&#39;m not 100% sure it will.\n\n- If tearDown() is not really necessary, you can declare a static test\nfixture and initialize it at the point of definition:\n\npublic class InformationDirectoryTest extends TestCase {\n\n  private static SomeClass obj = new SomeClass();\n\n  &lt;tests&gt;\n}\n\n    ---------------\n    Paolo Perrotta\n    Bologna, Italy\n\n\n\n",
