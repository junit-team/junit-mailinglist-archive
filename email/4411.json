The good think is<br/>\nthat you&#39;re showing the way to go.  The developers will have someting to<br/>\nwork on immediately.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">    &gt; 2. As for JTest, it will do even something else for you, which is to<br/>\n   &gt; come up (through reflection<br/>\n   &gt; and some other techniques) with a basic set of unit tests that can be<br/>\n   &gt; manually augmented later<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I always have problem with tools that generate &quot;tests&quot; for your code.<br/>\nBut as I don&#39;t know JTest, take my comment as general.<br/>\n<br/>\nWriting tests is verifying what the class _must_ do and not what the<br/>\nclass _is_ doing.  Because the tool has normally no way of guessing what<br/>\nthe class must do, it tests its actual behaviour.  To my opinion, these<br/>\n&quot;tests&quot; do not help you to find bugs (in general), but can be seen as a<br/>\n&quot;safety net&quot; (because once generated, they should all pass).  If one of<br/>\nthese tests failes after adding a feature, it tells you that you changed<br/>\nthe behaviour of your application.  It&#39;s up to you then to review the<br/>\n&quot;test&quot; and see if it&#39;s still accurate.  But maybe JTest acts differently.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Vladimir<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nVladimir Bossicard<br/>\nwww.bossicard.com</div>",
