    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1714317837\">If you are bringing unit testing into an existing dev/QA structure, you<br/>\nwant the tests written by the two groups to start to diverge, you want a<br/>\nclear demarcation point between the two roles, and you want good<br/>\ncommunication across that boundary.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe developers write their unit tests. The unit tests are designed to be<br/>\nas simple as possible and have the widest coverage possible. The<br/>\ndevelopers run these tests in their own sandbox. It doesn&#39;t make much<br/>\nsense to automate the reporting of bugs here, since the failures are in<br/>\ncode in the sandbox, not in the repository. When the tests pass in the<br/>\nsandbox, the next step is to update the sandbox from the repository to<br/>\nintegrate any recent changes made by other developers (easy to do using<br/>\nCVS or BitKeeper). Then, if the tests still pass, the changes are<br/>\ncomitted back to the repository.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn most XP groups, there is a periodic integration test on an integration<br/>\nworkstation. This workstation is supposed to have a clean configuration at<br/>\nall times (It may be reimaged frequently). Someone does a clean checkout<br/>\nto this machine and runs the tests to verify that everything is integrating<br/>\ncorrectly in that environment. This is done one or two times a day.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a group with a slightly heavier weight process, the integration may be<br/>\nrun by QA folks. The QA folks use the unit tests to verify a clean build<br/>\nbefore taking the snapshot to their side for further (functional) testing.<br/>\nThis is where it may make sense to enter failures into bug tracking, but<br/>\nfailures should be rare and will always require some immediate<br/>\ninvestigation. I&#39;m not sure that automation will buy one much over just<br/>\nentering the bug report by hand.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is also a good place to run any coverage analysis tools and look for<br/>\ntrouble spots. If the QA group does this, it will probably satisfy their<br/>\ndesire for oversite of the developers&#39; process. Be careful with coverage<br/>\nanalysis, though- use it to identify serious weakpoints but don&#39;t become a<br/>\nslave to metrics. Even the best analysis tools will miss branches which<br/>\nhave been taken in tests but whose results were never verified or will<br/>\nidentify assertions or roadblocks as &quot;uncovered code&quot;. It&#39;s also OK to not<br/>\nhave 100% (branch/statement/expression) coverage all the time. Coverage<br/>\nshould steadily approach 100% over the life of the project as refactoring<br/>\noccurs and tests are added to reproduce reported bugs.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe QA folks then perform their testing, concentrating on the functional<br/>\nside. In some cases, particularly with public APIs, JUnit can be useful to<br/>\nthem as well, but higher level scripting tools tend to be more useful.<br/>\nSomething like Jython or NetRexx can be mixed with JUnit to give<br/>\nthe best of both. I have found that it is best if most of the QA group<br/>\nhas basic scripting skills. There should be one QA toolsmith per group (or<br/>\nshared with at most three small QA groups) who can do the heavyweight<br/>\nprogramming needed to create specialized test tools for the rest of the<br/>\ngroup. Again, though, I&#39;m not sure I see where integration with JUnit will<br/>\nbuy you much. In large projects, I&#39;ve sometimes wanted an analysis tool<br/>\nwhich would check a database and verify that the test suite only reported<br/>\nexpected failures (i.e. those for known, active defects) and all of the<br/>\nexpected failures, but I&#39;ve never wanted anything to report defects for<br/>\nme. There is too much value in a well-written defect report. Check Brian<br/>\nMarrick&#39;s site (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.testing.com/)\">http://www.testing.com/)</a> for good articles on how to<br/>\nimprove defect reports. You would also have to figure out how to avoid the<br/>\nphenomenon of cascading failures- one defect at a sufficiently low level<br/>\ncan cause hundreds of testcase failures. One doesn&#39;t want to bury the<br/>\ndevelopers in hundreds of automated defects. This can be attenuated if<br/>\nyour bug tracking system  is aware of test or component interdependencies,<br/>\nbut it takes a lot of extra work for the small automation gain.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Mon, 19 Nov 2001, Alan Pearlman Spencer wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Thanks,<br/>\n&gt; I agree with the idea about &quot;if you are doing it properly you don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; need this&quot;...<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m trying to migrate a dev/QA team over to the &quot;right&quot; way and I<br/>\n&gt; suppose<br/>\n&gt; the QA team are scared about loosing visibility into the tests (that are<br/>\n&gt; written by the developers).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We will have nightly builds and they will run the tests and I suppose<br/>\n&gt; they want to be able to get some visibility into the fixing of these<br/>\n&gt; problems.

Kent says we&#39;re supposed to cycle through the<br/>\n&gt; testing and coding stages a few times until our code has no bugs.  So<br/>\n&gt; what<br/>\n&gt; is there to track?  same goes for integration: providing we&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; developing in<br/>\n&gt; small enough chunks, of course.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Or look at it another way: our failed tests are their own bug<br/>\n&gt; trackingdevice.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Automatically populating a bug track database from failed tests would<br/>\n&gt; only<br/>\n&gt; make sense when the people running the tests aren&#39;t the same people who<br/>\n&gt; are<br/>\n&gt; developing the code, for instance users in UAT or a &quot;black box&quot; testing<br/>\n&gt; cell.  I don&#39;t think JUnit is sufficiently abstract for the former but I<br/>\n&gt; can<br/>\n&gt; see that the latter could be writing their own JUnit suites (if they<br/>\n&gt; know<br/>\n&gt; Java).  In which case your question is simply a variant on the &quot;How do I<br/>\n&gt; log<br/>\n&gt; output from JUnit?&quot; question, only instead of writing to a logfile you<br/>\n&gt; want<br/>\n&gt; to insert the results into an error tracking database.  How difficult<br/>\n&gt; that<br/>\n&gt; is depends on the database in question: if it&#39;s something proprietary<br/>\n&gt; like<br/>\n&gt; Merant Tracker I imagine there&#39;ll be a few more problems than if (like<br/>\n&gt; us)<br/>\n&gt; you&#39;re using a homebrew system based on tables sitting in your<br/>\n&gt; development<br/>\n&gt; Oracle DB.  The Bugzilla FAQ does say we write to the database using the<br/>\n&gt; Mozilla XML API so it would be possible to do, but I think you&#39;ll be<br/>\n&gt; lucky<br/>\n&gt; to find anyone who&#39;s actually done it :P<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; rgds, APC<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; A P Clarke<br/>\n&gt; Consultant<br/>\n&gt; CMG Admiral UK - Radio Spectrum International<br/>\n&gt; Wyndham House<br/>\n&gt; 189 Marsh Wall<br/>\n&gt; London<br/>\n&gt; E14 9SH<br/>\n&gt; Tel: +44 (0)20 7211 0603<br/>\n&gt; Fax: +44 (0)20 7211 0364<br/>\n&gt; Mobile:-----------------------<br/>\n&gt; Internet communications are not secure and therefore CMG UK Ltd does not<br/>\n&gt; accept legal responsibility for the contents of this message.
