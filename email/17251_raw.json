Its =\r\ncore is an object, say APP, static reference of which\nis kept in the main c=\r\nlass (much like in singleton, but the\nconstructor&#39;s not private; for the ab=\r\nove stated reasons I don&#39;t want\nto discuss this detail).\n\nI&#39;m only a rookie=\r\n in programming as such and might not know things\nthat are second nature to=\r\n you. But having a singleton-like\narchitecture seems to me to contradict th=\r\ne tests separation\nprinciple... Every time I call a static method of my APP=\r\n class, I use\nthe same object... \n\nAnd what&#39;s what started to give me troub=\r\nle recently. It is possible to\ninitialize this APP object, loading GUI modu=\r\nles or not. To be honest,\nusing it without UI is a workaround of mine, whic=\r\nh I implemented to be\nsomewhat closer to unit testing, although my tasks ar=\r\ne actually\nregular regression tests, examining whole big chunks of\nfunction=\r\nality... So in a part of my tests that don&#39;t need the\ngraphical modules, I =\r\nsimply don&#39;t load them. However, I&#39;ve recently\nbeen trying out some other t=\r\nype of tests that operate on a\nfull-fledged application, which needs loadin=\r\ng the UI. And that&#39;s where\nthe problem begins - trying to load those module=\r\ns, having used the\napplication without them in previous tests, is in the ap=\r\nplication, as\nit currently is, impossible (and don&#39;t think that anyone will=\r\n take\ngrumbling of a humble tester into consideration).\n\nSo the question to=\r\n you guys is as follows: should I give up hope that\nmy job has anything to =\r\ndo with unit testing, and allow dosens of funny\nwindows to jump here and fr=\r\no while basic functionality is being\nchecked or rather do you see any other=\r\n possibility to solve my problem\nthat I, humble rookie, overlooked?\n\nGratef=\r\nul for any answer,\n\nAnna\n\n\n\n\n",
