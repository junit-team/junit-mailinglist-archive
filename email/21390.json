Are there any large<br/>\n&gt; projects that use it? Good places to get started on it?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you say adopting Confluence, do you mean adopting it as a<br/>\nplatform on which you build your own application?<br/>\n<br/>\nI haven&#39;t developed anything on top of Confluence myself but I have<br/>\nseen a multi-module Maven project with one of the modules being a<br/>\nskeleton for a Confluence plugin (generated with Atlassian&#39;s tools, I<br/>\nbelieve). That skeleton had a bunch of automated tests itself so even<br/>\nif they took ages to run (can&#39;t remember exactly but it was several<br/>\nminutes) at least the existence of automated tests suggests that it&#39;s<br/>\nnot the worst platform to build on.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, this is just an educated guess so...
