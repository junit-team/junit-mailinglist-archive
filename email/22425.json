While I had the equals and reciprocal equals working<br/>\nproperly, I was surprised at the unintended hashCode collisions I had in<br/>\nmy code.  More importantly I was surprised at how often the @DataPoints<br/>\nmethod was called to set up the tests.  It was called no less than 61<br/>\ntimes for 60 discrete data points.  That seems a bit excessive to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI set up a bunch of data with the assumption that it was set up once,<br/>\nand then the contents were copied as needed.  Essentially the expensive<br/>\nset up work is done 61 times, accounting for a large portion of the 37<br/>\nseconds it takes to run all my tests.  If the @DataPoints method is only<br/>\ncalled once, and the values are copied as necessary, then the<br/>\nimplementation would be much faster.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
