Eventually the event is passed to an EventHandler \nobject.  I&#39;d like to test the process of placing an event on the \nqueue and it being handled so I have a test method that posts the \nevent, I implement my EventHandler interface and in the method that \nthe interface provides I verify the data is what I posted.  The \nproblem I am getting is that even though the assertion is thrown, the \nTest failure is not included in the TestResult object.  In addition I \npass in a PrintStream to the JUNit TestRunner but in this case, the \nerror output appears on System.out not my PrintStream.  My feeling is \nthat what&#39;s happening is that my test method posts the Event, then \nthe flow of excution passes back to the TestRunner with no exceptions \nthrown.  Later the event is caught, and if it fails the exception is \nthrown but by this time the TestResult object has already been \ncreated.  Is there a prescribed way of testing such methods?\n\n\n",
