Remember that TDD is a<br/>\n/design/ activity, not a testing activity.  I am afraid that generated<br/>\nassertions would break the basic cycle feedback of TDD.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am not going to tell you not to do this project, but calling it TDD<br/>\nwould cause me to call into question your understanding of TDD.<br/>\n<br/>\nchet<br/>\n<br/>\nWednesday, December 27, 2006, 3:58:58 PM, you wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; hmm, to be honest, I haven&#39;t had much experience with TDD or JUnit <br/>\n&gt; till I started on my honors project  about a couple of months ago. <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve done much research however and have written a small lab <br/>\n&gt; excercise using TDD.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; As for what makes me think its a good idea, well basically all the <br/>\n&gt; articles I read and the people I&#39;ve spoken to remark on two reasons <br/>\n&gt; why people do not pick up TDD, firstly being the test-first concept <br/>\n&gt; of it is difficult to grasp and secondly that they do not see the <br/>\n&gt; benefits in using it.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Well Junit was designed to allow repeated testing and I figure if it <br/>\n&gt; could be further extended to generate the basic test cases it could <br/>\n&gt; save alot of time and effort on the tester&#39;s part.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I mean from personal experience I thought it was hell of a tedious <br/>\n&gt; to generate all the assert statements usually needed to test a given <br/>\n&gt; unit of code i.e. a method. So I thought why not auto generate some <br/>\n&gt; test cases? I dont mean all of them since testing is creative <br/>\n&gt; work...but surely the basic few?<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Stressed,<br/>\n&gt; Jimm<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>-- <br/>\nBest regards,<br/>\n chet                            mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lists@...\">lists@...</a></div>",
