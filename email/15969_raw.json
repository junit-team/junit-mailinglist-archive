How do you get the adaptors?  Use a Factory.\n\nI get it; I really do. I&#39;d like to frame my original question within the \ncontext of JUnit itself, and not just to bring this back on-topic.[1] A \ncommon way to extract test methods from JUnit (3.x) tests is to use a \nnaming convention with reflection. Assume that we do not have access to \nmetainformation such as annotations. How could we allow people to write \ntests without having to do the kind of double-entry I prefer not to do? \nIn other words, I just want to write a test and JUnit knows it&#39;s a test, \nrather than having to tell it that. How can we do that without \nreflection? If there&#39;s a way, I want to know about it, because I&#39;d be \nmissing something valuable!\n\nWhat I find strange in all this is that I demonstrated doing what JUnit \ndoes in another piece of code, and even people who use JUnit looked at \nme like I was high.[2] Why the double standard? Why does JUnit get to \nuse this pattern and I don&#39;t. It&#39;s just weird, so I&#39;m looking for an \nexplanation by asking the more general question, &quot;What&#39;s so bad about \nPluggable Selector?&quot;\n----\n[1] Personally I don&#39;t care whether it&#39;s off- or on-topic, but some \nreaders might care.\n\n[2] Just say no. Stay in school. All that stuff.\n-- \nJ. B.
