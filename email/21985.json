The txt file has the following columns, delimited by tabs:<br/>\n<br/>\nDate<br/>\nName<br/>\nAge<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThen I have a method called updateFile().  The implementation is below:<br/>\n<br/>\npublic void updateFile() {<br/>\n//open up file for writing, setting the append flag to &#39;true&#39;<br/>\n//write X lines to file<br/>\n//close file<br/>\n}<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not exactly sure how to write a test for this particular method.  I&#39;m thinking I should check the size of the file.  But, that might not be enough since I also would probably have to check and validate the values being put into those columns.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, after I&#39;m done performing the test, the file will have X lines appended to it.  How do I revert back to it&#39;s original state if I have another test that depends on the txt file?<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease help!  Thanks!</div>",
