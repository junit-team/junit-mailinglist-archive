And recently, <br/>\nwhen it happened, I wrote *one* test, using reflection, to test <br/>\n*all* the get and set methods in the whole system.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Rational Rose has a bad habit of deleting method bodies when doing <br/>\nround-trip engineering.  You gotta watch for that.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe XP rule is, &quot;Test everything that could possibly break.&quot;  Could <br/>\na get or set method be written wrong, so as to be broken?  Well... <br/>\nmaybe.  Maybe some tool deletes method bodies.  Maybe its code <br/>\ngeneration defaults to giving you bad method bodies (in some <br/>\ncases).  Maybe the data types won&#39;t always match between get, set <br/>\nand the private field.  When you find these to be issues on your <br/>\nproject, I would certainly encourage you to write tests for them.</div>",
