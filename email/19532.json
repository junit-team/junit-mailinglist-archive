Let&#39;s discuss further here, and<br/>\nthen summarize to the bug posting--I&#39;ve indicated as such to the<br/>\ntracker listing.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust to make sure I&#39;m hearing you right, it sounds like you were using<br/>\na method to run all the tests, without having to enumerate them<br/>\nindividually.  Is that right?  What were you using?  Eclipse?  Ant?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems there&#39;s two concerns you bring up, and JUnit doesn&#39;t handle<br/>\neither natively: Suite construction (find all the tests I might want<br/>\nto run) and suite subdivision (only run the tests I actually want to<br/>\nrun).<br/>\n<br/>\n*** Suite construction ***<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s really important for me that it&#39;s clear how to run all my tests,<br/>\nso I&#39;ve often had to start with an AllTests suite from the very<br/>\nbeginning.  Maintaining those suites can be annoying, so in some of my<br/>\nprojects, I&#39;ve used Johannes Link&#39;s excellent ClasspathSuite:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.johanneslink.net/cpsuite.html\">http://www.johanneslink.net/cpsuite.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThis allows me to run all tests in a package without having to<br/>\nenumerate them.  Eclipse and ant do this &quot;in the UI&quot;, but I prefer<br/>\ndoing it in the suite definition itself, so other developers can run<br/>\nmy tests without matching the UI.<br/>\n<br/>\n*** Suite subdivision<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce we can find all the tests we might want to run, how do we<br/>\nrestrict which are actually run?  There are two out-of-the-box<br/>\nsolutions I know of.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, I accomplish what you discuss through package organization: I<br/>\ncan run test.unit.**, test.online.**, or test.** to get everything.<br/>\nThis doesn&#39;t match every conceivable need, but it does match every<br/>\nneed I&#39;ve had so far.  Would it handle your current situation?<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, JUnitExt claims to add a @Category annotation that does almost<br/>\nexactly what you promise.  Would that handle your situation?  One<br/>\nthought I have is that perhaps we&#39;d want to base groups on class<br/>\nnames, so that automated refactoring can help if we decide to use a<br/>\nmore informative name, and to provide an obvious place to document and<br/>\nextend a category definition.  That is, rather than<br/>\n<br/>\n@Category(&quot;online tests&quot;) public class MyTest {<br/>\n<br/>\nWe could have<br/>\n<br/>\n@Category(OnlineTests.class) public class MyTest {<br/>\n<br/>\nOr even just<br/>\n<br/>\n@OnlineTest public class MyTest {<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, questions for the community:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Should something like ClasspathSuite be incorporated into JUnit?<br/>\n2) Should something like JUnitExt&#39;s categories be incorporated into JUnit?<br/>\n3) If yes to the above, what should the API look like?<br/>\n<br/>\nRemember that we strive to have JUnit be the intersection of all<br/>\nuseful testing frameworks, not their union.  Thanks,<br/>\n<br/>\n   David Saff<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 7/5/07, Christian Nelson &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cnelson@...\">cnelson@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve created a new feature request describing what I think better<br/>\n&gt; suite/group support would look like:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1748683&group_id=15278&atid=365278\">https://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1748683&group_id=15278&atid=365278</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Please chime in and share your thoughts on the subject.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Christian<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Christian Nelson&quot; &lt;cnelson@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I have a feeling I&#39;m about to bring up a much discussed topic,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; however, I wasn&#39;t able to find any related topics by searching this<br/>\n&gt; &gt; mailing list.  My apologies in advance if this has been hashed out<br/>\n&gt; before.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; While generally thinking that its not a great idea, I occasionally<br/>\n&gt; &gt; come into a situation where I genuinely need to partition my tests<br/>\n&gt; &gt; into more than one group or partition or suite.  The latest example is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; with a client who has many unit style tests as well as a number of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; tests which require specific network connectivity only available from<br/>\n&gt; &gt; a subset of machines (the outgoing requests must come from a specific<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ip address).  We call these the &quot;online tests&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; We want to be able to group our tests into two groups, &quot;unit tests&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and &quot;online tests&quot;.  In some case we want to run only &quot;unit tests&quot; or<br/>\n&gt; &gt; only &quot;online tests&quot;, and in other cases we want to run both (or all).<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I understand that this functionality is available using JUnit 4&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; @RunWith(Suite.class) and @SuiteClasses(TestClass1.class, ...).<br/>\n&gt; &gt; However, manually adding test classes to a suite is clunky because the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; list of  test classes becomes huge.  It&#39;s also error prone; it&#39;s easy<br/>\n&gt; &gt; for developers to write a test but forget to add it to @SuiteClass.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Lastly, test runners will run test in suites multiple times when told<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to &quot;run all tests&quot;.  That&#39;s hardly the desired behavior.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; What I really would like to see is the concept of suite (or group in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; TestNG terms) be promoted to a first class citizen.  Honestly, I think<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  I would prefer it to be at the test class level (unlike TestNG which<br/>\n&gt; &gt; is at the test method level), since the mechanism should be used for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; high-level organization IMHO.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Is there any chance something like this might make its way into JUnit?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; What can I do to help?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Thanks,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Christian<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
