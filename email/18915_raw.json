It was a demo of a programming environment called Subtext.\n\nSubtext is really the intersection of a bunch of different ideas, but \nthe key one, at least regarding testing and TDD, is that environments \ncan really give us much more information than they do currently.  In \nSubtext, your program is represented in little graphic elements that are \nsort of like the cells in a spreadsheet.  The cool part is that as you \nmanipulate your program, it is continually working on visible example \nvalues.  They change as you change your code in much the same way that a \nspreadsheet recalculates.\n\nTo me, it seems that this is a really a great idea to pursue.  When we \ndo TDD, one of the benefits is the immediacy of feedback.  We type a \ntest, we press a button and see it fail, we write some code and see it \npass.  With one of these &#39;immediate&#39; environments, you are working on \nexamples the whole time, so it brings feedback to another level.  I \nsuppose that example values could be captured as invariants (tests) as \nyou write your code.\n\nJohn Edwards (the guy behind Subtext) has a set of demos here: \nhttp://subtextual.org/\nHere&#39;s a good one to start with: http://subtextual.org/demo1.html\n\nAt this point, Subtext is science fiction.  It&#39;s demo stage only.  \nJohn&#39;s playing with the ideas and trying to get people interested in \nthem.  But it&#39;s well worth a look.\n\nIn general, I think it would be great to see environments which give us \nmuch more information about our programs.  Another example.. a while ago \nI was talking to Ivan Moore (of Jester fame) and he was saying that he \nhad an idea for a tool that would go through your Java code and \n&#39;privitize&#39; it; that is, make all methods private that could be \nprivate.  In the spirit of the thing he was thinking of calling it \nThatcher :-)  We were talking about it with a few other people who, like \nme, are very annoyed by the fact that private gets in the way when its \nin someone else&#39;s mangled code and you don&#39;t have the opportunity to \npeel it off, and we thought, well, wouldn&#39;t it be nice if your \nenvironment just told you which methods weren&#39;t used elsewhere in the \nsystem?  Sort of, &quot;this one could be private if you wanted it to be.&quot;\n\nTDD has this neat emotional feel..  you work in little transactions with \nthe code.. and you get a lot of feedback.  I think that there are more \nopportunities for that sort of feedback if we make our environments smarter.\n\nMichael Feathers\nwww.objectmentor.com\n\n\n",
