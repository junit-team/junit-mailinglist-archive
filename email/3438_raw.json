If you \n&gt; have specified that warning are deadly, your build will fail otherwise \n&gt; it will only be a message on the log.\n&gt; \n\nshort answer : I think you should use ant for that instead...\n\nLonger :\nThough I C yr point, I believe you should try to work out yr solution \noutside the Unit testing FrameWork !\nTools need to collaborate but do not need especially to be integrate.\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; - support of XML\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Where ?\n&gt;&gt; To do what ?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; 2 idea:\n&gt; - replace the AllTests.java by an XML file. Advantage: no need to \n&gt; recompile if you only want to run a single test case.  You&#39;ll be able to \n&gt;  run a named testsuite or a single testcase\n\nOK,\nI see yr point.\nOne could code that as an extension instead, too ...\nOr as a Code generating class based on XML too.\nI personnally believe the AllTests.java is also a (big) mistake.\nI&#39;m unfortunatelly too lazy to change it :-D\nWhy don&#39;t you deliver a class that does it, simply ?\n\n\n&gt; - standard output in xml.  Only need some filters to transform the \n&gt; result in html, txt...\n\nHey, hey ...\nDon&#39;t go too fast\nbut that is excellent !\n\nI would put it otherwise :\nSTO in an internal format !\nThere is a transformer to XML / HTML / TXT...\nOne remark though Java XML apps are deadly slow on small PC&#39;s\n\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; - services shared between TestCases\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Could you give a Practal example.\n&gt; \n&gt; Database connection.  It&#39;s costly and if you have several tests, \n&gt; connecting to the database for each test is really costly.  The idea is \n&gt; to set up a pool of resources (database, RMI or Corba connection, JNDI) \n&gt; at the beginning of the run and let tests aquire the resource when they \n&gt; need it.\n&gt; \n\nWell there is Pro&#39;s & Con&#39;s to it\nQuickly said I see more Con&#39;s than Pro&#39;s\nBcoze I also run the ALL tests at nights so I don&#39;t give a shit to \nrecreate a JDBConnection every time eventhough it takes ages !\n\n\n&gt; All these modifications cannot be done without altering the framework \n&gt; itself and developing new runners.  Because the JUnit managment won&#39;t \n&gt; ever accept all these idea (I know, I asked), the best way is to start \n&gt; something from scratch.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Vladimir\n\nWell Vladimir,\nIt&#39;s always hard to see your own kids grow up & move away.\nMust be the same for them, he :-D\n\n\nC ya,\n\nThomas,\n\n-- \n\n\nrue J.
