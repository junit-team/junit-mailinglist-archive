I have 3.3.1, and it runs, but I have to<br/>\nchange code in many of my tests to deal with deleted classes and methods<br/>\nI&#39;m using. :/<br/>\n<br/>\nI noticed the error you&#39;re getting, and I don&#39;t see how that can be blamed<br/>\nupon the JVM.  You aren&#39;t getting a JVM core dump or anything, you&#39;re getting<br/>\nJUnit failures.  When I upgraded, I had to diddle with my scripts and <br/>\nIDE settings to change some classpaths.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYou might be running into differences in the reflection API, perhaps?<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJoi Ellis                    Software Engineer<br/>\nAravox Technologies          <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:joi@...\">joi@...</a>, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:gyles19@...\">gyles19@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\nNo matter what we think of Linux versus FreeBSD, etc., the one thing I<br/>\nreally like about Linux is that it has Microsoft worried.
