Nearly every thing I do\n&gt; is run as a servlet, so you have to be thread safe. And all of my\n&gt; systems have assorted daemons and background threads, which implement\n&gt; simple things like WorkingSetCaches or do long things like\n&gt; talking to radios that have to be dispatched asynchronously.\n\nI run into it, but typically on platforms that do the dirty work for me, \nso I don&#39;t have to worry about it. That&#39;s what I meant. As for servlets, \nI don&#39;t typically store writable data in servlet fields, but rather only \nstateless services, so the multiple threads invoking a servlet don&#39;t \nbother me. This is a case where following a few simple rules eliminates \nthe problem, rather than testing them out.\n\n&gt; And the AJAX folks are pushing the multi-threaded model even harder,\n&gt; with many more server clanks, and more chances for the server to get\n&gt; wrapped arround the axel with thread issues.\n\nI have no idea how to test-drive Ajax stuff in Java. I&#39;ve only done it \nin Ruby, and, once again, the multithreadedness doesn&#39;t much come up.\n\nI merely favor eliminating the problem to solving it. I guess I&#39;ve been \nworking in domains that haven&#39;t forced me down the same roads you&#39;ve \nbeen down.\n-- \nJ. B.
