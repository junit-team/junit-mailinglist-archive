I was inherited to take over <br/>\n&gt; testing a client / server application.  The test cases were all <br/>\n&gt; written in xml (a bunch of xml defined messages that the client <br/>\n </span></blockquote>would <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; send to the server) where a java application would read in each <br/>\n </span></blockquote>test <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; case from the xml file.  It would then send the xml message to the <br/>\n&gt; server and the server would then process that xml messages and send <br/>\n&gt; them back another xml message.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   I would like to integrate this into Junit&#39;s framework but the <br/>\n&gt; problem I am having is that each test case has 4 xml messages that <br/>\n </span></blockquote>it <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; sends to the server.  I would like to use JUnits TestCase method <br/>\n </span></blockquote>and <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; read each xml file one by one.  The problem with this is that it <br/>\n&gt; would be one method that would be reading each xml message in from <br/>\n&gt; the file and then verifying it.  <br/>\n&gt;    <br/>\n&gt;    After looking at JUnit&#39;s framework they treat each method as a <br/>\n&gt; test case within a class that extends TestCase.  My question is how <br/>\n&gt; would you design this so that I could treat each file as testcase 1 <br/>\n&gt; and each message that gets read in as testcase a, b, c, etc....  I <br/>\n&gt; would like to be able to use Junit&#39;s swing TestRunner to run all <br/>\n&gt; these xml file test cases then.  Any help would be greatly <br/>\n&gt; appreciated.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ben </span></blockquote></div>",
