However, see\nbelow.\n\n\n* Is it even possible to create a JUnit test on a text-based application\n&gt; which requires user input?  I see no examples of this type of activity in\n&gt; the JUnit documentation...\n\n\n\nAbsolutely.  I&#39;ve done it several times.  The key is to make sure that\nrather than directly reading from System.in everywhere that you want input,\nyou make the input stream (and probably output stream) parameters to your\nclass or method.  Then, in your JUnit test, you can use ByteArrayInputStream\nto queue up &quot;fake&quot; input.\n\n\n* The dashes following the hostname are not part of my output.  Where did\n&gt; they come from?\n\n\n\nI think they are from ant, marking the end of standard output.\n\n\n* Why will the program execute but not wait for user input.  It does this\n&gt; without fail when the program is run from the command line.\n\n\n\nWhich behavior is &quot;this&quot; in the last sentence?\n\nGood luck,\n\n   David Saff\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
