Once that was done, I then<br/>\npassed<br/>\nthe Properties object to each of the routines I had that parsed the<br/>\nproperties. For testing, I just created a Properties object and then<br/>\nused<br/>\nthe setProperty() call, as Valdimir suggested.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt works very well. The only thing I saw different was that in a<br/>\nproperty<br/>\nfile, I could have a line like &quot;NAME = &#92;tVALUE&quot; and it would process<br/>\nthat<br/>\ncorrectly (without the tab), whereas I get a different result, if I do a <br/>\nsetProperty(&quot;NAME&quot;, &quot;&#92;tVALUE&quot;); so I can&#39;t really test those types of<br/>\nsyntactical things. Not a big deal though, as I could have one real<br/>\nproperty<br/>\nfile and use that to test those cases, if need be.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was just surprised that Java didn&#39;t have a way to do the equivalent of<br/>\nStringBufferInputStream for the Properties.load() call (like accepting a<br/>\nStrngReader). I found it very handy to be able to feed the load either a<br/>\nFileInputStream or a StringbufferInputStream, as needed.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPCM (Paul Michali)<br/>\n<br/>\nCarrier Voice Gateway Business Unit (CVGBU)<br/>\nCisco Systems, Inc.<br/>\n250 Apollo Drive<br/>\nChelmsford, MA 01824<br/>\n<br/>\nPhone : (800) 572-6771 x 45817  (978) 244-5817 [direct]<br/>\nPaging: (800) 365-4578 [voice]  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pcm@...\">pcm@...</a> [email page]</div>",
