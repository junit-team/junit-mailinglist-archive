I want<br/>\nthe developer of the test to state this. Maybe they could use a<br/>\nparticular formatted comment, which I could parse and use to augment<br/>\nthe results?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe method I come up with I may have to impose on other groups within<br/>\nthis project, so I don&#39;t want it to be heavy handed, if possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for any suggestions,<br/>\n<br/>\n Nick<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nNick Piper, Developer, LogicaCMG           <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nickpiper.co.uk/\">http://www.nickpiper.co.uk/</a><br/>\nGPG Encrypted mail welcome!                             1024D/3ED8B27F<br/>\nChoose life.
