That&#39;s an important first step.\n\nYou did have a working test harness at one point, right?  How about \nstarting by fixing that?  Make whatever changes are needed to the \ncode/tests to get the existing tests to run again.  And as a matter of \npolicy, require all NEW code to have unit tests.  This won&#39;t cure the \ndisease, but it will at least stop it from getting any worse.  Then \nstart adding tests for every *bug* you find, or have already found but \nhaven&#39;t fixed yet.\n\nYou won&#39;t have complete coverage this way, and may never get there, but \nat least you&#39;ll be carrying forward good practices.  And if you can \ndemonstrate to management that your development is now severely slowed \nby bugs due to a lack of testing, you may be able to convince them.\n\n-- \n\nDavid Stagner\n\nNational Marrow Donor Program\n3001 Broadway Street NE\nBroadway Ridge Suite 500\nMinneapolis, MN  55413\n\nEmail: dstagner@...\n\n\n\n",
