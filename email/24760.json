Must have been some confusion on our side when we analyzed it previously.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Many threads isn&#39;t really the problem, it is just one thread that seems to get any significant CPU time. It rather seems that it is &quot;overflowing&quot; to occupy more than one core, which surprises me a bit considering the application under test is completely single-threaded. Tried to reproduce it by making some dummy code, but that stayed at a load of about &quot;one core&quot;, so I&#39;m confused to say the least.<br/>\n- I played around with the garbage collection, but that doesn&#39;t change the picture.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo it is probably that I don&#39;t understand how the JVM works rather than an issue with junit or Eclipse :)<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the help.<br/>\n<br/>\n/Chris<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------------------------<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Sun, 10/9/16, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kcooney@...\">kcooney@...</a> [junit] &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n Subject: [junit] Re: Parallel runner & Eclipse?<br/>\n To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n Date: Sunday, October 9, 2016, 6:09 PM<br/>\n       <br/>\n       It&#39;s hard to suggest more without<br/>\n seeing the code.<br/>\n Does the problem happen when<br/>\n you run tests in Eclipse that do not use your custom runner?<br/>\n Do you limit the<br/>\n number of threads when you configure the `ThreadPoolExecutor`?
