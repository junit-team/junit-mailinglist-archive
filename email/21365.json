I expect it to break with JUnit 4.6.<br/>\n2) Intellij doesn&#39;t report the test name correctly. It reports:<br/>\n<br/>\nTest &#39;com.intellij.rt.junit4.Junit4ClassSuite$1.0 test case(s)&#39; ignored.<br/>\n<br/>\nI assume it looks at the annotation and does its own naming.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe main reason I&#39;m asking on the group is in case I&#39;m missing<br/>\nsomething about the approach, and perhaps the JUnit developers had<br/>\nsomething else in mind. Clearly they do for JUnit 4 tests, but I<br/>\nhaven&#39;t found anything for intermixing JUnit 3 tests.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do appreciate the insight about the Assume class, it is very helpful<br/>\nto know!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mark Levison &lt;mark@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On Tue, Feb 17, 2009 at 1:23 PM, yme0987654321 &lt;yme0987654321@...&gt;<br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hi David,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; My name is Yishai (I have to figure out how to change this Yahoo<br/>\n&gt; &gt; profile). Anyway, I guess the issue is that I have many tests that are<br/>\n&gt; &gt; in the 3.8 style that I am retrofitting, so to use this I would have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to change the test into a Junit 4 type test, whereas in my hack the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; runner correctly figured out that it was a JUnit 3.8 style test.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Have you considered converting the tests to Junit 4? I&#39;m sure if you<br/>\n&gt; ask around some has implemented a script to get most of the monkey<br/>\n&gt; work done.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Cheers<br/>\n&gt; Mark<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Blog: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.notesfromatooluser.com/\">http://www.notesfromatooluser.com/</a><br/>\n&gt; Recent Entries: Agile/Scrum Smells:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.notesfromatooluser.com/2008/06/agilescrum-smells.html\">http://www.notesfromatooluser.com/2008/06/agilescrum-smells.html</a><br/>\n&gt; Agile Games for Making Retrospectives Interesting:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.notesfromatooluser.com/2008/10/agile-games-for-making-retrospectives-interesting.html\">http://www.notesfromatooluser.com/2008/10/agile-games-for-making-retrospectives-interesting.html</a><br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
