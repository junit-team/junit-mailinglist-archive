I think this&#39;ll\nhelp. \n\nI did do a search on Yahoo groups, and I did read the\ne-mail I received when I first signed up. However, my\nsearch results did not return the two messages you\nsent to me. I think we were using two different search\ncriteria. I first searched for NullPointerException\nwhich returns far too many messages to read. I then\nsearched for &quot;java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke&quot; which,\nwhile it is contained in both of the messages you\nlisted, returns a list that does not include either of\nthe messages. Oh well...\n\nAnyhow, it looks as though the issue was resolved way\nback in August... I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re involved with\nJ/Unit development, but I&#39;m curious why if it is known\nthat a particular use-case causes a\nNullPointerException to be thrown, a better error\nmessage is not returned (such as, &quot;Please make sure\nsuiteMethod is static in class XXX&quot;). That would make\nthings a little more robust, and definately more user\nfriendly.\n\nOnce again, thanks for the reference.\n\n\nSam W\n\n--- Vladimir Bossicard &lt;vladimir@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; A really quick search on yahoogroups gives...\n&gt; \n&gt; a similar question:\n&gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/junit/message/2417\n&gt; \n&gt; and its answer:\n&gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/junit/message/2442\n&gt; \n&gt; Please first read the mail you received when you\n&gt; joined the group (today \n&gt; according to yahoogroups): it gives you useful\n&gt; information on where to \n&gt; search for information (already asked questions...)\n&gt; before sending an \n&gt; email to 1,795 users.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Vladimir\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; Vladimir Bossicard\n&gt; www.bossicard.com\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTry FREE Yahoo!
