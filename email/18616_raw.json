And was considering modifying JUnit such \n&gt; th=\r\nat it will auto generate some test cases based values flagged by \n&gt; users. =\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; E.g., \n&gt; Public boolean isLegalInt(int x){ \n&gt; /* input - 0 &lt; x &lt; 10, =\r\nresult - True*/\n&gt; \n&gt; }\n&gt; given a comment like the above will generate asser=\r\nt statements such \n&gt; as\n&gt; assertFalse(isLegalInt(0));\n&gt; assertTrue(isLegalI=\r\nnt(1));\n&gt; assertTrue(isLegalInt(9));\n&gt; assertFalse(isLegalInt(10));\n&gt; \n&gt; Th=\r\nus, I am trying to locate the source code that generates the \n&gt; testclass t=\r\nemplate to implement the changes and I can&#39;t seem to find \n&gt; it anywhere. A=\r\nny help would be greatly appreciated thankyou.\n&gt; \n&gt; p.s I am currently work=\r\ning with Junit 3.8.1\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Jimm\n&gt;\n\nThere are several great commer=\r\ncial tools that do automated test case\ncreation. Feel free to experiment wi=\r\nth testgen4j which is an open\nsource project we created that builds on some=\r\n other open source tools\n(http://developer.spikesource.com/wiki/index.php/P=\r\nrojects:TestGen4J).\n\nAfter a while its the management and maintenance of th=\r\ne test data that\nbecomes more of a challenge!\n\nregards\ncalvin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
