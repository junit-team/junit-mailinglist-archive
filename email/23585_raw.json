I see that you did define the hamcres=\r\nt-core dependency in the POM, but since the class files are also shipped th=\r\nis has no effect.\n\nI wonder: is this bundling on purpose, and if not, will =\r\nit be corrected?\n\nKind regards,\nStephan\n\n\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, Da=\r\nvid Saff &lt;david@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; So, one minute--does this mean that the bet=\r\na staging repositories that\n&gt; I closed, but didn&#39;t release, were not availa=\r\nble to users for beta\n&gt; testing?\n&gt; \n&gt;    David Saff\n&gt; \n&gt; On Wed, Aug 24, 20=\r\n11 at 11:40 AM, Max Bowsher &lt;maxb@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Yes, that looks fine.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; You probably also want to either promote or drop - probably drop - the=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; remaining active staging repositories containing 4.9 beta releases fro=\r\nm\n&gt; &gt; oss.sonatype.org.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Max.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; On 24/08/11 12:35, David Saff =\r\nwrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I just had to click the button, it turns out. =A0It should now =\r\nbe\n&gt; &gt;&gt; promoted. =A0Please let me know if it looks that way to you (since =\r\nI&#39;m\n&gt; &gt;&gt; still, obviously, new at this).\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =A0 =A0David Saff\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; On Wed, Aug 24, 2011 at 7:29 AM, Max Bowsher &lt;maxb@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; On=\r\n 23/08/11 16:44, David Saff wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hello, everyone. =A0We&#39;re happy t=\r\no announce the release of JUnit 4.9.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Great!\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; I see y=\r\nou&#39;ve already staged it at oss.sonatype.org - what still needs to\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; hap=\r\npen before that staging repository gets promoted into Maven Central?\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Max.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n",
