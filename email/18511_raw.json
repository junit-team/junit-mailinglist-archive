For example, I have a fairly \n&gt; straightforwa=\r\nrd DAO and I want to test the create method.  \n&gt; But to really test it, I n=\r\need to retrieve it afterwards and \n&gt; make sure it was successfully created.=\r\n  And I need to clean \n&gt; it up afterwards (or the test will fail next time =\r\nI run it \n&gt; and try to create a duplicate), so I call my delete method. \n&gt; =\r\nThere I&#39;ve exercised 3 methods of my DAO, not just one.  So \n&gt; it feels lik=\r\ne it would save time to assert that each step of \n&gt; the process succeeded. =\r\n \n&gt; \n&gt; Example:\n&gt;   public void testEmployeeCRUD()\n&gt;   throws Exception\n&gt;  =\r\n {\n&gt; \tint sizeBeforeAdding =3D em.listEmployees().size();\n&gt; \t_employeeId =\r\n=3D em.createEmployee(_fname, _lname, _jobtitle);\n&gt; \t\n&gt;         int sizeAft=\r\nerAdding =3D em.listEmployees().size();\n&gt;         log.debug(&quot;Created employ=\r\nee &quot; + _employeeId);\n&gt;         //Make sure that the new list is longer than=\r\n the old list\n&gt; \tassertTrue(&quot;Create employee failed&quot;, \n&gt; sizeAfterAdding&gt;si=\r\nzeBeforeAdding);\n&gt;                \n&gt;         Employee emp =3D em.getEmploye=\r\ne(_employeeId);\n&gt;         assertEquals(&quot;getEmployee failed&quot;, emp.getLName()=\r\n, _lname);\n&gt;         log.debug(&quot;Retrieved employee &quot; + emp.getLName());\n&gt;  =\r\n               \n&gt;         em.deleteEmployee(emp);\n&gt;                 \n&gt;     =\r\n    int sizeAfterDelete =3D em.listEmployees().size();\n&gt;                 \n&gt;=\r\n         //Make sure that the length of the list after delete \n&gt;         //=\r\nis the same as it was before we added\n&gt;         assertEquals(&quot;Delete employ=\r\nee failed&quot;, \n&gt; sizeAfterDelete, sizeBeforeAdding);\n&gt;         log.debug(&quot;Del=\r\neted employee&quot;);\n&gt;     }\n&gt; \n&gt; The preceding code works just fine.  If the t=\r\nest fails, I&#39;d \n&gt; look in the failure message to see which part of it faile=\r\nd, \n&gt; and it seems like that&#39;s not too difficult.  I know it&#39;s not \n&gt; follo=\r\nwing best practices because it calls 4 separate methods, \n&gt; but when I trie=\r\nd writing a test for each of those methods, I \n&gt; ended up either calling th=\r\ne other ones in the setup/teardown \n&gt; or by essentially recreating them in =\r\na sample data loading \n&gt; operation.  I&#39;m trying to do good TDD and to convi=\r\nnce a \n&gt; colleague who resists unit tests at all, so I don&#39;t want to \n&gt; do =\r\nthings &quot;wrong&quot; but I also don&#39;t want to make life \n&gt; tremendously more diff=\r\nicult without understanding the real \n&gt; reason behind the recommendations.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; Does anyone have any thoughts on this principle?  I \n&gt; appreciate the =\r\nintelligent exchanges I&#39;ve seen on the list in \n&gt; the past so I hope to get=\r\n a thoughtful discussion going.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks very much!\n&gt; Julie\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  =\r\n\n&gt; Yahoo!
