It provides a bunch of assertions but then an arbitrary line in <br/>\n&gt;the sand has been drawn to say that these are all that anyone should need. <br/>\n&gt;This is confusing.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What I am about to write is not a personal attack; therefore, do not take it <br/>\npersonally. It is a comment on a general attitude that I have experienced <br/>\nand, in the past, held. Please do not write letters to the editor.<br/>\n<br/>\nI used to believe, &quot;if they are going to do something, they should go all <br/>\nthe way, not just part of the way.&quot; My justification was managing <br/>\nexpectations: if they do A, B and C for me, I expect them to do X, Y and Z. <br/>\nWhen they don&#39;t, I am disappointed. Why should they do that to me?! I have <br/>\nsince changed my tune, as I find that attitude artifically limits some <br/>\npeople&#39;s tendency to add some convenience where it is needed. Some <br/>\nconvenience is almost always better than no convenience. Sometimes total <br/>\nconvenience has too high a cost.<br/>\n<br/>\nSpecifically to Chris, your assumption is that Kent and Erich were trying to <br/>\nlimit you by not including the kitchen sink. They did not. I&#39;m certain they <br/>\nonly added whatever they thought was needed at the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nI maintain, however, that further customization is likely <br/>\napplication-specific; therefore, I do not need it and I would prefer not to <br/>\nsee it in the framework. As always, some exceptions apply.<br/>\n<br/>\nJ. B.
