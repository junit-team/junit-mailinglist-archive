I&#39;m new at Junit and just finished testing my \n&gt;Dao and wanted to see how other people test their Ejb. I have an Ejb \n&gt;that has almost no business logic and essentially just gives you \n&gt;connections.\n\n...then why do you want to test it with JUnit? Since you&#39;re new to\nJUnit, I assume you&#39;re also new to unit testing in general. I suggest\nthat you don&#39;t want to test an EJB that has no business logic if you\nhave already tested the DAO underneath.\n\nIf you *do* have business logic, then I suggest refactoring that into\nits own class (collaborating with the DAO directly, I imagine) and\ntesting *that*, since that allows you to avoid issues about testing\nwith EJB containers and so on.\n\nBut don&#39;t test the EJB code -- the stuff that&#39;s part of the EJB\nframework -- unless you&#39;re trying to reproduce a defect. It&#39;s enough\nwork to test your own code without trying to test everyone else&#39;s.\n\nGood luck.\n\nJ. B.
