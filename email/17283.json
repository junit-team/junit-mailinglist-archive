Every tool manages to frustrate some <br/>\npeople, even JUnit.  :-)  But it&#39;s very valuable to get feedback from <br/>\nfrustrated users who are still trying to make things work.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou have a lot of specific questions, and if you choose to highlight one <br/>\nat a time, I think you&#39;ll get some really good answers from this <br/>\ncommunity. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut I was struck by your first real statement: &quot;I have to say it&#39;s fun <br/>\nto do the implement coding. But it&#39;s suffering to write JUnit cases.&quot;  <br/>\nIt made me think a lot.  I got into JUnit because I really _liked_ <br/>\nwriting test cases.  But I really respect some people that have been <br/>\nreally frustrated, like you are.  Is there more going on here than <br/>\npersonal preference?  I think there might be.<br/>\n<br/>\nI thought a lot about it, and, sadly, wrote even more.  Rather than <br/>\nburden the list with it, I&#39;ve moved my thoughts over to my tech blog:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://shareandenjoy.saff.net\">http://shareandenjoy.saff.net</a><br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck,<br/>\n<br/>\n    David Saff<br/>\n<br/>\nJean wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; I&#39;ve written JUnit cases for over 1 month. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have to say it&#39;s fun to do the implement coding. But it&#39;s suffering to<br/>\n&gt; write JUnit cases. Because:<br/>\n&gt; 1. I need to know the correct result from the other way around and sometimes<br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s hard to find another way. <br/>\n&gt; 2. Database and JSP pages are difficult to JUnit test.<br/>\n&gt; 3. Mock objects brings more than double efforts during the whole develop<br/>\n&gt; process.<br/>\n&gt; 4. Exception situation is not so easy to make as JUnit claims.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 3 friends in 3 different companies (small size and middle size company)<br/>\n&gt; complain JUnit as:<br/>\n&gt; 1. They planned JUnit testing firstly and they cannot keep it going. TIME<br/>\n&gt; reason?<br/>\n&gt; 2. It consumes a lot of time but hard to find big problems. JUnit does find<br/>\n&gt; small problems as we expected.<br/>\n&gt; 3. JUnit testing is not effcient enough.<br/>\n&gt; 4. Best JUnit tester is the senior software developer. But senior guys hate<br/>\n&gt; to write test cases.<br/>\n&gt; 5. For small company, it&#39;s really hard to choose between JUnit+develop and<br/>\n&gt; develop+functional testing.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Is there anyone who is successful in deploying JUnit during develop as:<br/>\n&gt; JUnit + code + JUnit + code + System Testing? <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
