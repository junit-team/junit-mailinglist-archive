It<br/>\nwas a tool to help you figure out the behavior of an object and identify any<br/>\nunexpected behaviors. It was very useful for the kind of post-TDD testing<br/>\nthat you talk about but useless for huge legacy projects with lots of<br/>\ninter-dependencies.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am often struck by the distance between the discussions in lists like this<br/>\none and mainstream practice out there in Cubeland.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople such as ourselves (by which I mean people who talk about testing<br/>\nideas on mailing lists) are able to mentally partition the various goals of<br/>\ntesting and identify gaps and opportunities for improvement. We tend towards<br/>\na big bag o&#39; testing tricks that we can delve into and choose the right<br/>\ntrick for the right goal and are always on the lookout for new tricks to add<br/>\nto the bag. I suspect that mainstream development teams still have a single<br/>\nbucket in their budget marked &#39;testing&#39; and they are looking a for a<br/>\none-shot solution that will solve all their testing needs.<br/>\n<br/>\nSelfishly, I&#39;d use a tool like the one I described but I&#39;d like to see more<br/>\ntools that can gently ease developers into a test-infected frame of mind so<br/>\nthey can benefit from some of the other great ideas that will surely be<br/>\ndiscussed here.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nKevin<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.junitfactory.com\">http://www.junitfactory.com</a><br/>\nYou send us code.
