So our<br/>\n&gt; customers sometimes don&#39;t want us to use an open source tool like<br/>\n&gt; junit because it isn&#39;t formally validated, e.g., doesn&#39;t have written<br/>\n&gt; requirements, traceable to design, traceable to unit and system tests,<br/>\n&gt; with the output of the tests captured.  Any suggestions for how to<br/>\n&gt; address this other than telling them that junit is so extensively used<br/>\n&gt; it must work, e.g., is there a suite of junit acceptance tests or even<br/>\n&gt; unit tests that we can run to prove that it works according to its<br/>\n&gt; specs?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is an interesting question that you raise and while I don&#39;t have<br/>\nan answer, I do have a question.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf there was a suite of JUnit unit tests, written in JUnit, wouldn&#39;t<br/>\nthat be too recursive to be acceptable?
