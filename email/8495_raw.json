Right now means development/debugging but of course that \nmeans testing too. [Aside, in smalltalk, for many years, I have been \nwriting small test cases right inside the method body as a \ncomment &#39;during&#39; writing of the method. This took the place of \nwriting workspace tests. I could unit test the method I just wrote, \nand six months later it serves as a handy mini-doc on how that code \nworks. This made a lot of sense in st where you can swipe and \nevaluate the code right in the method pane but that doesnt work in \nJava IDEs so it doesnt translate as well].\n\nMy persistence objects are currently quite unstable. So an \ninteresting automated test is whether the code completes without \nthrowing an exception. So, my unit tests DO assert something - that \nthe code doesnt crash.\n\nAs things stabilise that will become a boring test (only for \nregression test a framework change). But at this point, those test \nmethods would serve double-duty for my purposes if they could return \na value.\n\nEventually I will add junit tests which will assert the findings that \nare now just explorations and new code. (I&#39;m aware that that might \nappear backwards to a test-first proponent, that&#39;s a whole nother \ndebate. I am agnostic on whether I write the test before or &#39;during&#39;. \nI think i am a &#39;test-during&#39; proponent). \n\nBut meanwhile, I am journalling (cataloging etc, this seems to be a \nsticking point) all my testing &#39;thoughts&#39;. I expect to cull the test \nsuite to a strong usable set as time goes on. So, one might say I am \ndeveloping/debugging the test suite concurrent with app \ndevelopment/testing. \n\n\n\n",
