As runners can&#39;t be composed, it<br/>\n&gt; should be handled at the root like @Ignored<br/>\n<br/>\nBut Rules can be composed.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; assertEquals&  IDE integration: an additional static assert method<br/>\n&gt;&gt; (when we change the built-in assertEquals, it breaks tests that have<br/>\n&gt;&gt; been running fine for years.  This tends to cause Bad Days for already<br/>\n&gt;&gt; over-worked people.  A separate static method is an easy way for<br/>\n&gt;&gt; people to opt-in to the new behavior)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; this doesn&#39;t make sense for me at all.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; First who will call Assert.assertEquals in some cases and<br/>\n&gt; SomeUtils.assertEquals in other cases?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Second, I&#39;m quite sure that changing<br/>\n&gt;   failNotEquals(message, expected, actual);<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt;   throw new ComparisonFailure(cleanMessage, String.valueOf(expected),<br/>\n&gt; String.valueOf(actual));<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t have the drawbacks you describe. Even better it would align the<br/>\n&gt; code to what is currently done for Strings.<br/>\n<br/>\nChanging AssertionFailedException to AssertError as part of the<br/>\nupgrade from JUnit 3 to JUnit 4 internally to Google broke dozens of<br/>\ntest suites.  People write custom assertion packages, and then write<br/>\ntests for those packages.  I&#39;m quite sure that this change would have<br/>\na similar effect, multiplied by a much wider user base.  It would be<br/>\nodd to me to assert both that this change is so useful, it&#39;s worth the<br/>\npotential breakage, but so useless, no one would be willing to change<br/>\ntheir static imports to use it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we were to make this available in junit-contrib, we could see how<br/>\nwide its usage was, and then have data to add to the discussion, not<br/>\njust the force of our convictions.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Most interesting is ParallelRunner.  From your description, this<br/>\n&gt;&gt; appears to be a Runner that exposes the work already latent in the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; ParallelComputer class and others.  It would be interesting if you had<br/>\n&gt;&gt; to make any changes to the existing classes in order to produce this<br/>\n&gt;&gt; new Runner without duplication.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; just make the anonymous RunnerScheduler in ParallelComputer.parallelize<br/>\n&gt; reusable and it&#39;s done.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d welcome a patch to do this.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; This was my last email on this subject. This is clear to me that you are<br/>\n&gt; not interested in what I propose. I&#39;m not really surprised as it<br/>\n&gt; confirms the experience made by others in the past. This is sad because<br/>\n&gt; I still think that a lot of JUnit users would love improvements but at<br/>\n&gt; the end, it is your decision.<br/>\n<br/>\nMarc,<br/>\n<br/>\nI invited you to submit your ideas to the same process that everyone<br/>\nelse&#39;s ideas are evaluated.  You responded that responsiveness in that<br/>\narena was lacking.  I spent a long time thinking about that, and sent<br/>\na long response entitled &quot;JUnit issue responsiveness&quot;, where I tried<br/>\nto directly discuss the &quot;experience made by others in the past&quot;, and<br/>\nmy plans for improving it.  I have invited you to contribute to those<br/>\nplans.  I have, in total, spent several hours addressing these ideas<br/>\nof yours, at no cost to yourself, not even the time it would have<br/>\ntaken you to copy and paste your ideas over to github.<br/>\n<br/>\nEvery addition into the core JUnit jar has a cost, as well as a<br/>\nbenefit, to future maintainers, extenders, and users.  At this point,<br/>\nI do not think that changing to a model in which someone mails five<br/>\none-line ideas to a mailing list, and I simply say &quot;sure, I&#39;ll accept<br/>\nall of those patches if you write them&quot; would be beneficial to<br/>\neveryone involved.  Please, try to convince me otherwise, ideally over<br/>\nat the thread &quot;JUnit issue responsiveness&quot;, so I can learn from your<br/>\nexperiences.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sorry if this does not appear to you to be &quot;interest&quot;.  I truly<br/>\nhope that you, or other interested users, can partner with me to take<br/>\nJUnit forward, and welcome your contributions in the future.<br/>\n<br/>\n   David Saff<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Cheers,<br/>\n&gt; Marc.<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; HtmlUnit support & consulting from the source<br/>\n&gt; Blog: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mguillem.wordpress.com\">http://mguillem.wordpress.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
