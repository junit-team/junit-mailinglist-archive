You could annotate your code with say <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;@TestDependency Test1 public void myTest() {code;}&quot;, which would cause myTest() to depend on Test1 running it&#39;s tests first.<br/>\n<br/>\nA scenario where this might be needed...<br/>\n1. Test1 inserts DB records<br/>\n2. Nightly job runs (but can be run manually by user)<br/>\n3. Test2.myTest() then runs, as #2 has completed, and myTest() now has data that can be used.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the case of #2, it would need to give the user enough time to run the nightly job, manually.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m wanting to test everything in a totally automated way.  But at this point, it is not entirely possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just wanted to ask about this, as you guys probably have a lot more experience in why this is or is not a good idea.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks.</div>",
