Examples \n&gt;     &gt; include open \n&gt;     &gt; source applications or products where the source code is \n&gt;     &gt; the primary \n&gt;     &gt; deliverable (e.g. frameworks).\n&gt; \n&gt; But Mike, don&#39;t you think this is a different beast altogether?  OpenSource\n&gt; should have the tests included because it fully expects the user to change\n&gt; the code.  If the user is responsible about maintaining the tests then it\n&gt; makes it easier for the progenitor(s) of the project accept changes to the\n&gt; base code.  At least in a somewhat perfect world... :D\n&gt; \n&gt; -Jason\n&gt; \n\nNo doubt, maintaining test cases is an excellent way to convince open \nsource project curators that the changes work and don&#39;t break anything. \n  Moreover, the test cases are valuable stepping stones for users who \ndon&#39;t plan to contribute their changes back to the user community.  In \nany event, the intent of shipping the test cases in these situations is \nto give users of source code confidence that the software works, \ndocument it&#39;s capabilities, and provide a testable foundation for \nmodification.\n\nI&#39;ll up the ante a bit and propose that products that provide a Java API \nship selected JUnit test cases to demonstrate example uses of the API. \nIt&#39;s common for such products to include example programs in various and \nsundry formats, and sometimes they even work!  I&#39;ve often thought it \nwould be handy if these examples followed a well known structure and \nautomatically validated the results.  This of course requires that \ncustomers are willing to install JUnit if it&#39;s not distributed with the \nproduct.\n\nMike\n\n-- \nMike Clark\nClarkware Consulting, Inc.\nCustom Software Architecture, Design,\nDevelopment, and Performance Consulting\nhttp://www.clarkware.com\n\n\n",
