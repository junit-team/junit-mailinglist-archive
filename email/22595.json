If you are not happy with the version of junit shipped with eclipse, just download the version you want (I&#39;d put that into a lib-directory in the project as to get is stowed away via svn or csv). Then, all you need is to tweak the build-path to point to the downloaded vesion. Or you use maven and add it as a dependency.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\n  Georg<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;nuttzy99&quot; &lt;nuttzy@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Point of clarification, the PHP Eclipse does ship with enough Java components where I was able to write some sample apps with it and run them.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;nuttzy99&quot; &lt;nuttzy@&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hey Guys,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I GOT IT!  Between the two of you, you had the right answer ;-)  In the &quot;Install New Software&quot; dialog under Galileo there was nothing there specific to JUnit.  But it occurred to me that installing &quot;EPP Java Package&quot; and &quot;Java EE IDE Feature&quot; was a reasonable thing to do.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Did that and now JUnit 4.5 is install and I can access the features I previously mentioned were lacking.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Thanks!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
