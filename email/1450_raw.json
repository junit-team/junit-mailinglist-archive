That is, you\nare saying that if class A&#39;s methods are accessible to members of its\npackage and subclasses or only its package, then what the programmer should\ndo is define the methods of class A as public.  You said that &quot;if the client\nhas no business touching these parts, make them private.&quot;  But we should say\nthat while a client can be an unknown, external process or third party\nlibrary, a client can also be a class in the same package of our own\nlibrary.  The existence of the various access modifiers gives us finer\ncontrol than the binary choice of public/private.\n\nScott Stirling\nJRun QA\nMacromedia\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Jason Rogers [mailto:jason.rogers@...]\n&gt; Sent: Monday, June 11, 2001 10:09 AM\n&gt; To: &#39;junit@yahoogroups.com&#39;\n&gt; Subject: RE: [junit] Best Practice for Tests ?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; IMO...\n&gt; \n&gt;     &gt; It simply make testing easier, without changing the \n&gt; protection of\n&gt; existing code. \n&gt;     &gt; We find it sometimes easy to test part of a flow (which usually\n&gt; resides in a separate method) rather than \n&gt;     &gt; check the public interface function. \n&gt; \n&gt; Then shouldn&#39;t these be made part of the public interface and \n&gt; allow the\n&gt; client to interact with them?  If the client has no business \n&gt; touching these\n&gt; parts, make them private.\n&gt; \n&gt;     &gt; Also, I take the term &quot;public interface&quot; as relative. \n&gt; If an object\n&gt; exposes an interface (set of methods)\n&gt;     &gt; to its peer objects within its package, I see no reason \n&gt; not to test\n&gt; it, even though those methods are\n&gt;     &gt; package-protected. \n&gt; \n&gt; I guess I disagree here.  I am not convinced that \n&gt; package-potected methods\n&gt; are part of a public interface.  If they are used that way I \n&gt; would question\n&gt; whether some refactoring needed to take place.  But that&#39;s \n&gt; just my opinion.\n&gt; I don&#39;t want to seem like I am picking on your design decisions.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Jason\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
