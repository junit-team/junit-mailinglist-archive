Your proposed solution would not solve the problem I\nam trying to address.  My situation is the following:\n\n1. My test method throws an exception.  This exception indicates the real\nproblem.\n2. My tearDown method throws an exception.  This exception is caused by an\ninvalid state because my test method did not run all way through.\n\nThis is a problem because of #2.  The way the JUnit framework is written,\nany exception coming out of tearDown will mask any exception coming out of a\ntest method.\n\nRemember that fail() is really just a method that throws an\nAssertionFailedError.  So, your solution below will still cause the\nexception thrown from tearDown to mask the exception thrown by fail() in the\ntest method.\n\nIn my case the exception thrown in the test method is the root of the\nproblem.  But, I can&#39;t see that exception without modifying my code to print\nthe exception.  Once I fix the problem, I have to go back and remove the\ncode I added to print the exception.\n\nMatt\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: nils_khare@...

In the description below it would \ngive details about this Exception.\n\n2) public void testFoo(){\n      try{\n        //Some code that would throw SomeDBException\n      }\n      catch(SomeDBException e){\n        //Option I  - Nothing\n        //Option II -\n        fail(&quot;SomeDBException caught&quot;);\n      }\n\nIn this second case when SomeDBException is thrown with Option I, \nJUnit would assume that you are trying to catch this Exception and \nassuming that this is a negative test would &#39;PASS&#39; the test.\n\nIn this second case when Option II is put into effect by giving a \nspecific fail() command, JUnit makes the method to &#39;FAIL&#39;.\n\nOut of the two of the above, if you are really not interested in \ncatching the Exeption then it should be just declared to be thrown \nand not explicitly caught and then JUnit would give you the result \nthe way you want it.\n\nIf you are doing this all and still getting the mentioned \nSomeDBException then that means something needs to be investigated \nfurther.\n\nI would never modify the Production code in order to make my tests \npass or fail.\n\n- Nilesh\n\n--- In junit@y..., &quot;Di Iorio, Matthew (ISS Atlanta)&quot; &lt;mdiiorio@i...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; Laurent&#39;s message about tearDown getting called reminded me of \nsomething\n&gt; I&#39;ve wanted to post to the list.\n&gt; \n&gt; A few weeks back I was working with some database tests and was \ngetting odd\n&gt; behavior.  It took me a little while to figure it out, but what was\n&gt; happening was a test method was throwing an exception because of \nsome\n&gt; database error.  The tearDown method attempted to cleanup after the \ntest and\n&gt; it also threw a database exception.  All I got back was the \nexception that\n&gt; occurred in tearDown, not the exception that occurred in the test \nmethod.\n&gt; \n&gt; It was a real pain because I had to modify the production code to \ncatch and\n&gt; print the exception so I could uncover the actual problem.\n&gt; \n&gt; My preferred solution would be to print both exceptions.  If I get \nan\n&gt; exception in testFoo and in tearDown, JUnit should print the \nfollowing:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) testFoo(net.iss.FooTest) \n&gt; java.lang.Exception\n&gt; \tat ...\n&gt; Exception in tearDown:\n&gt; java.lang.Exception\n&gt; \tat ...\n&gt; \n&gt; I would be willing to put together a patch to do this.
