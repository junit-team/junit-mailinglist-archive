At\n&gt; least that&#39;s the methodology I use (no change happens to my code\n&gt; until there&#39;s a failing test forcing the change, except for\n&gt; refactoring).  So the code coverage tool shouldn&#39;t be (as)\n&gt; necessary.  I&#39;ve found I only use them for those project where\n&gt; (someone else :) wrote the code without writing tests first.\n&gt; In that case, it helps to know the coverage, but also can give\n&gt; me a false sense of security.\n&gt;  \n\nDavid,\n\nThis is the way I practice TDD as well -- test first. I&#39;ve been\nlearning that not everyone is as disciplined as we are. Code coverage\ntools /can/ be a two-edged sword. I use it as an audit check for how\nwell I&#39;m adhering to TDD. Sometimes I can still slip and this helps me\nidentify my own backsliding ways early so I can correct the problem by\nadding the right tests. But you are correct, just because the code is\nbeing executed by a test does not mean that it is adequately tested.\n\nMy recommendation was that a coverage tool be used to provide\nconfidence that private methods are being executed by existing tests\nthrough the public API. The impluse that leads to making the private\nmethod public for testing might diminish if one could be shown that\nthere was no need. Do you think it would be preferable in that context\nto measure code coverage before making methods public?\n\nRegards,\nJim \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
