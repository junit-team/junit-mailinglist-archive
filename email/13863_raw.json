In Eclipse it&#39;s just &quot;new class, copy=\r\n, run\n&gt;  &gt; tests, delete, run tests, update, commit&quot;. Well, except for the =\r\nclass\n&gt;  &gt; comments, I guess. For that you&#39;re on your own. :)\n&gt;  \n&gt;  Eclips=\r\ne.\n&gt;  \n&gt;  So that&#39;s &quot;new class&quot;. Copy. Fix layout. Fix suite(). Run tests. =\r\nDelete\n&gt;  tests. Run. Delete other tests in other class. Run. Check that th=\r\ne two\n&gt;  classes are a partition of the original class. (One *must* do this=\r\n, so\n&gt;  it&#39;s probably better to do moves than deletes.) Look for shared cod=\r\ne\n&gt;  and partition it or move it to a suitable (possibly new) superclass. \n=\r\n&gt;  (There&#39;s usually some helper code like this.) Link the suite() into\n&gt;  t=\r\nhe parent suite. (Yes, we don&#39;t use the automatic recursive suite\n&gt;  creati=\r\non. Close call: but sometimes being able to trivially comment\n&gt;  out subsui=\r\ntes has made bug-tracking much much easier, since we do\n&gt;  sometimes end up=\r\n with context-sensitive problems. Perhaps we just \n&gt;  have too many global =\r\ncaches.) Run complete test suite. Stare hard \n&gt;  at the new classname, rena=\r\nme to suitable, because now you have to \n&gt;  introduce it to CVS, and renami=\r\nng it later is a pain. Perform \n&gt;  introduction. No, I don&#39;t want the file =\r\nCVSed when it&#39;s created, since\n&gt;  if I want to back it out later (when I re=\r\nalise I made a complete mess)\n&gt;  I don&#39;t want dirty footprints in the repos=\r\nitory. OK, everything works.\n&gt;  Check in. Wait forever for CVS to complete.=\r\n Time passes. Maybe there&#39;s\n&gt;  some mail to read? Yes. Whoppee, CVS done. C=\r\nhange to paranoia window.\n&gt;  CVS update. Wait forever for CVS to complete. =\r\nTime passes. Mail already\n&gt;  read, read news instead. CVS completes. ant bu=\r\nild, run tests, all pass.\n&gt;  Hooray! Don&#39;t do this on a Friday afternoon, y=\r\nou&#39;ll likely miss your\n&gt;  train or break the build.\n&gt;  \n&gt;  Somewhere in the=\r\nre I fixed the auto-layout. And did a CVS update (Wait.\n&gt;  Time passes. Get=\r\n tea.) before running the tests. \n&gt;  \n&gt;  What do you do that if I did it to=\r\no I could do better?
