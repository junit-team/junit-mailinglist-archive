I figured I was doing something wrong. I got the\ntechnique of putting the verify in the tearDown from either an online\ntutorial or a book I read somewhere. If I find it I&#39;ll list it here.\nI&#39;m really brand new at all of this and I&#39;m trying to make sense of it\nall. I got the JUnit in action book and read the chapter in XDoclet in\naction regarding mock objects. So now that&#39;s what I&#39;m using. I use\nXDoclet to design the mocks for the objects my code interacts with.\nI&#39;ll take a look at JMock to see how it compares. I am a little\ndisenchanted due to the lack of documentation on the mockobjectdoclet\ntask. I&#39;ll be posting back here no doubt. Thanx all.\n\nCliff\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, Steve Freeman &lt;steve@m...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; First. Consider moving to jmock (www.jmock.org). That&#39;s our current \n&gt; favourite.\n&gt; \n&gt; You shouldn&#39;t call verify() in the tearDown, it&#39;s just the same as \n&gt; calling Assert. The test is over by the time you get to tearDown(), so \n&gt; failures won&#39;t be logged properly. In jMock, we&#39;ve subclassed TestCase \n&gt; to collect mocks and call verify() automatically in the right place.\n&gt; \n&gt; S.\n&gt; \n&gt; cliftonccraig wrote:\n&gt; &gt; I new to this and I&#39;m not even sure I&#39;m posting to the right list or\n&gt; &gt; not but here goes. I just started using JUnit and TDD on this project\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m working on. I am using MockObjects (I believe .9 version) through\n&gt; &gt; XDoclet to create a mock of an interface that the object I&#39;m testing\n&gt; &gt; uses. What I noticed is that introducing the call to mock.verify() in\n&gt; &gt; the TestCase tearDown method masks exceptions that are thrown from\n&gt; &gt; test methods. In other words if an unexpected exception occurs in a\n&gt; &gt; test method it doesn&#39;t appear to show in the logs when the\n&gt; &gt; mock.verify() executes. Mind you, I am using the JUnit support out of\n&gt; &gt; IntelliJ Idea. However I don&#39;t think that is relevant to the problem.\n&gt; &gt; The basics of my TestCase are as follows.\n&gt; &gt; class MyTestCase\n&gt; &gt; {\n&gt; &gt;    private MyMock mock;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;    public void testMyMethod() throws UnExcpectedException\n&gt; &gt;    {\n&gt; &gt;       //Test logic here\n&gt; &gt;    }\n&gt; &gt;      public void setup()\n&gt; &gt;    {\n&gt; &gt;       mock = new MyMock();\n&gt; &gt;       //logic to set mock preconditions and expectations...\n&gt; &gt;    }\n&gt; &gt;      public void verify()\n&gt; &gt;    {\n&gt; &gt;       //This executes and thorws an exception that masks the real\n&gt; &gt; exception in the test method.\n&gt; &gt;       mock.verify();\n&gt; &gt;    }\n&gt; &gt; }\n&gt; &gt; When I don&#39;t use mocks then I can test and figure out problems rather\n&gt; &gt; easily because I propogate exceptions up to the JUnit framework where\n&gt; &gt; the UI catches them and displays them accordingly. I&#39;m not sure if\n&gt; &gt; this is the best practice which is why I&#39;m writing. Could someone\n&gt; &gt; guide me here?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
