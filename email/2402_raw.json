(For example, one\n&gt; problem concerned how the server should protect itself from an I/O\n&gt; operation that takes an &quot;impossibly&quot; long duration.)\n&gt; \n&gt; So then I thought maybe what I&#39;m trying to do here isn&#39;t really Unit\n&gt; Testing.  Because I&#39;m trying to test the operation of the system as a\n&gt; whole (or at least a part of it that is bigger than one &quot;unit&quot;).  So\n&gt; what is it?  Is it &quot;Functional Testing&quot;?  I don&#39;t think so, because\n&gt; this unusual error case isn&#39;t something that I would expect I could\n&gt; find in a collection of User Stories.\n\nIMO there are two kinds of testing you have to touch here. The first one\nyou describe correctly:\n\n&gt; Is this another form of testing (&quot;Assumption Testing&quot;)?  Or perhaps\n&gt; another way to look at it is that I&#39;m a &quot;customer&quot; of the SSL library\n&gt; provider, and I need to have my own &quot;Acceptance Test&quot; of the\n&gt; functionality that I expect it to provide?\n\nIf you rely on a library which you think\n(a) contains bugs that prevent you from doing what you want to do with\nit\n(b) might change its interface in the future\n(c) you don&#39;t understand thoroughly enough\n\nthen, build your own test suites for the things you expect from that\nlibrary. &quot;Assumption Testing&quot; might be a good name for it.\n\n&gt; And, even if I try to persuade myself that this would be the correct\n&gt; way to test, somehow I&#39;m nervous that I would miss a test case, or not\n&gt; be aware of some assumption that I had made.\n\nThis is a problem you have with any test suite - you can never be sure.\nIt&#39;s more of a concern when you can only do specification-based testing,\ni.e. when you don&#39;t have the sources to suggest other test cases.\n\n&gt; Presumably if I tested the assumptions correctly in both cases, then I\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t have to test my code in both of its configurations (since\n&gt; &gt;from its point of view it&#39;s not really doing anything different in the\n&gt; two different cases).\n\nTo some extent you are right but not quite: Testing individual objects\ndoes not guarantee that the collaboration/interaction between tested\nobjects works (anti-composition axiom). That&#39;s why I&#39;d always test at\nleast some basic functionality with both configurations. You might check\nthe book\n&quot;McGregor & Sykes: Practical guide for testing object-oriented systems&quot;\nwhich covers interaction testing rather thoroughly.\n\nJohannes\n\n",
