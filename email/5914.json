    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-355433380\">Mr. Loritsch exactly describes the problem I ran into yesterday while<br/>\nextending the Test Mentor tool to have its test components (that live in a<br/>\ndifferent hierarchy) appear like JUnit tests. My first inclination was to<br/>\nsimply have Test Mentor test components implement the junit.framework.Test<br/>\ninterface and then implement countTestCases() and run(TestResult). The<br/>\nproblem I ran in to is that we don&#39;t compose tests by way of methods<br/>\nbeginning with &#39;testxxx&#39;, as JUnit does. What would have made the job a lot<br/>\neasier would have been some method in the Test interface that is passed a<br/>\ntest collector, such as collectTests(TestCollector), for example.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo subclasses of TestCase would implement code in<br/>\ncollectTests(TestCollector) that adds tests to the collector by virtue of<br/>\nthe &#39;testxxx&#39; methods, in order to maintain the current behavior, but other<br/>\nclasses in other hierarchies could implement other strategies to add tests<br/>\nto the collector.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; &gt; Berin Loritsch wrote:<br/>\n&gt; The problem with altering behavior based on a class hierarchy in the<br/>\n&gt; way that JUnit does it is that it is neither polymorphic, nor interface<br/>\n&gt; based.  It is somewhere in the middle--which is not clear.  Altering the<br/>\n&gt; behavior of a TestCollector based on the TestCase/TestSuite<br/>\n&gt; implementations means that if I had my own implementation of the Test<br/>\n&gt; interface I don&#39;t know how it is going to be handled.  Interfaces do<br/>\n&gt; not require you to have the same base class.  When used properly, that<br/>\n&gt; is a definite *strength*.  When used improperly, it causes problems<br/>\n&gt; in predictability.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My point is that the contracts with the Test interface are not defined<br/>\n&gt; clearly enough.  If I have to write a test harness (which I do BTW) that<br/>\n&gt; works quite differently than the core JUnit TestCase, then I am SOL.  I<br/>\n&gt; can&#39;t take advantage of any of the features that I would otherwise be<br/>\n&gt; able to expect with the relationship between TestCase and TestSuite.  I<br/>\n&gt; might be able to have a bunch of individual Test objects--which in some<br/>\n&gt; cases might be even better, but my objects would not be treated the same<br/>\n&gt; as the TestCase/TestSuite.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; For instance, I need to have a setup where I instantiate a component<br/>\n&gt; container, and the tests.  I want the tests to automatically collect all<br/>\n&gt; the testXXXX() methods and execute them.  However I can&#39;t do that unless<br/>\n&gt; I extend TestCase.  I can&#39;t extend TestCase because of other mitigating<br/>\n&gt; circumstances.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Lastly, when your contracts are fixated with the *interface* and not the<br/>\n&gt; abstract class, you do not depend on the internals of the abstract<br/>\n&gt; class.  There are some of those dependencies.  Logic for running a test<br/>\n&gt; should not be included in the TestCase itself.  The only thing that<br/>\n&gt; should be in a TestCase are the individual testXXX() methods and<br/>\n&gt; possibly the setUp()/tearDown() methods. </span></blockquote></div>",
