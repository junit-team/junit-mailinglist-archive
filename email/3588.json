Sorry.<br/>\n<br/>\nSoak testing is where you run tests in a random loop on a fixture that is<br/>\nnot being reset between tests in order to see if there are order<br/>\ndependencies, timing problems, state issues or if the fixture is being<br/>\nleft in an invalid condition by one or more tests. Soak tests will<br/>\nidentify failures that often won&#39;t be found any other way, but they are<br/>\nnotorious for identifying failures that cannot be diagnosed or fixed<br/>\nbecause the fixture may get into a bad state in one iteration and not<br/>\nactually fail until many iterations later. This is especially a problem in<br/>\ntesting C/C++ code.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoing invariant checking on each state change means that you<br/>\n(theoretically) know about the invalid state immediately rather than<br/>\nfinding out about it after some complex sequence of events causes the<br/>\nfailure to manifest. This makes it much easier to find and fix.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Mon, 17 Dec 2001, Holliday, Donald B.

As you say, it reduces exposure to<br/>\n&gt; internals. It also gives one the option of invoking that code in the<br/>\n&gt; field. Especially where there are user accessable APIs, I find it handy to<br/>\n&gt; ask a user to invoke invariants checking around problem code while<br/>\n&gt; diagnosing a possible API bug. If your assertInvariants(..) method is<br/>\n&gt; recursive, it is also not difficult to add a menu option that will invoke<br/>\n&gt; a full internal state check at run-time.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I always have the invariants checks run in my unit tests. This gives you<br/>\n&gt; the ability to catch a lot more bugs and get better diagnostics resorting<br/>\n&gt; to soak testing. A lot of times, your unit test may pass but leave the<br/>\n&gt; class-under-test in a bad state. In a real program, the next statement<br/>\n&gt; would fail, but its never caught in your test because the fixture is<br/>\n&gt; recycled. Invoking the invariants tests after state changes in tests is<br/>\n&gt; cheap and saves headaches in the long run.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On Fri, 14 Dec 2001, Robertson, Don wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Let&#39;s assume that invoking an assertInvariants() method within your<br/>\n&gt; class&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; methods is too expensive to be practical, but you want it for the purpose<br/>\n&gt; of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; unit testing anyway. Would it be structurally superior to :<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 1) Implement such a method within the actual class and invoke it from the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; test case. The main benefits I see are minimal exposure of the class&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; internals (although it *is* white box testing after all), and visual<br/>\n&gt; &gt; proximity of the invariant conditions for implementors/modifiers. The<br/>\n&gt; &gt; negative is that there is &quot;dead code&quot; (from a runtime perspective) within<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the class.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 2) Allow access to internal state within the class and write the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; assertInvariants() method within the test class(es). The benefits are<br/>\n&gt; visual<br/>\n&gt; &gt; proximity of the invariant conditions with the other functional<br/>\n&gt; description<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of the class, and no dead code in the runtime class. The negative is the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; need for exposure of more internal state.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Opinions?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; A second &quot;meta&quot; question might be whether you think it is worthwhile to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; check invariant conditions within your unit tests as a default behavior,<br/>\n&gt; or<br/>\n&gt; &gt; is it overkill?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Don<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nEric Vought<br/>\nChief Technical Officer - QLUE Consulting, Inc.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:evought@...\">evought@...</a> toll-free: 888-771-3538  RTP area: 919-816-9901 </span></blockquote></div>",
