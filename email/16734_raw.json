Could you please put in big, red letters on the\n&gt; site\n&gt; &gt; that this is strictly a legacy code technique, and that people\n&gt; should\n&gt; &gt; try to refactor away from using the tool as quickly as possible?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Another great tool for adding tests to code. I think I can use this\n&gt; &gt; tomorrow.\n&gt; &gt; --\n&gt; I just read the post on this little tool, so I haven&#39;t tried it yet,\n&gt; but it seems like it would be very helpful for mocking member objects\n&gt; created in a class. How do you refactor to eliminate a dependency on\n&gt; member objects. I understand how to do it with objects a class\n&gt; collaborates with, but it is a different matter when the member\n&gt; objects are &quot;owned&quot; by the object being tested. I guess you could\n&gt; provide the class with a factory class it could use to create it&#39;s\n&gt; members, but this seems like a lot of overhead for an object that only\n&gt; needs this capability for testing purposes.\n&gt;\n&gt; I am a new java programmer, so forgive me if my terminology isn&#39;t\n&gt; correct. Hopefully you can understand what I am trying to say.\n&gt;\n\n\nI suggest reading up about inversion of control and dependency injection\n\nhttp://www.martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html is a good read.\n\nhttp://picocontainer.codehaus.org/ has some nice 1, 2 and 5 minute tutorials\n\n\n- Dan\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n\n\n",
