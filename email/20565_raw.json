To be spec=\r\nific, let suppose\nthat there is 3 different teams with team leader in each =\r\none and\nproject manager makes status meeting once a week. If I was a projec=\r\nt\nmanager that is what would I say. But if I was team leader and heard\nthis=\r\n from my project manager, than I would think that there is\ndefinitely probl=\r\nem with my managing.\n\n1) Perhaps, I don&#39;t know what everybody does on daily=\r\n basis, so I\nspend a lot of time to get it out once a week.\n2) Perhaps, I i=\r\nnvolve my team excessively in preparation to the status\nmeeting and I shoul=\r\nd just live them along. I should use information\nthat I receive from them o=\r\nn daily basis.\n3) Perhaps, I report just too many details of what&#39;s going o=\r\nn and I\nshould cut it off.\n\nSo, potentially this highlights some managing p=\r\nroblem.\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kent Beck&quot; &lt;kentb@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I=\r\n had no idea the weekly meeting was cost 20% of our capacity. What\nI said w=\r\nas, &quot;The weekly status meeting isn&#39;t that big a deal. You\ncould cut your pr=\r\nep time in half without losing any of the value to me\nor, I think, to the t=\r\neam.&quot;\n&gt;  \n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt;  \n&gt; Kent Beck\n&gt; Three Rivers Institute\n&gt; \n&gt;   _____  =\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; From: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf\n=\r\nOf mfeathers@...\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, June 10, 2008 9:40 AM\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogr=\r\noups.com\n&gt; Subject: Re: A Note On Data-Gathering (Was Re: [junit] A case fo=\r\nr\nadding logging of assertions to junit)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I think that metrics=\r\n are fine when people just treat them as a\nsource of information. The place=\r\n where people mess up is when they\nreflexively assume that particular numbe=\r\nrs indicate problems and that\nthere is some sort of moral imperative to con=\r\nfront all perceived\nproblems. The fact is, there is no linkage there other =\r\nthan what we\nbring to the table. People and teams have natural rhythms and =\r\nwe have\nto take care when we decide what to optimize. \n&gt; \n&gt; The fact that p=\r\neople are less productive on one particular day out\nof the week would not s=\r\nurprise me. If someone told me that a team was\nuniformly productive every d=\r\nay of the week, I&#39;d actually be rather\nscared of what I might find if I was=\r\n to visit them.\n&gt; \n&gt; Michael\n&gt; \n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; &gt;From: Mike =\r\nHill &lt;mike@industriallogi\n&lt;mailto:mike%40industriallogic.com&gt; c.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Sen=\r\nt: Jun 10, 2008 11:39 AM\n&gt; &gt;To: junit@yahoogroups. &lt;mailto:junit%40yahoogro=\r\nups.com&gt; com\n&gt; &gt;Subject: A Note On Data-Gathering (Was Re: [junit] A case f=\r\nor\nadding logging of assertions to junit)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;On Tue, Jun 10, 2008 at 10=\r\n:07 AM, Kent Beck &lt;kentb@earthlink.\n&lt;mailto:kentb%40earthlink.net&gt; net&gt; wro=\r\nte:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; This is what DevCreek (www.devcreek.com) does, and the results\nare=\r\n often\n&gt; &gt;&gt; surprising. For example, we noticed that on Wednesdays the\nDevC=\r\nreek team\n&gt; &gt;&gt; itself wrote a quarter of the tests it wrote on other days. =\r\nTurns\nout they\n&gt; &gt;&gt; were spending most of the day preparing for the weekly =\r\nstatus\nmeeting.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;So. Side topic, and favorite horse-floggee of mine: =\r\ndid the metric\n&gt; &gt;do anything for us that simply knowing the team well woul=\r\ndn&#39;t have\n&gt; &gt;already done? I&#39;m assuming, here, dangerous habit, that there =\r\nwas no\n&gt; &gt;team-perceived process-weakness on Wednesdays prior to the metric=\r\n. If\n&gt; &gt;that&#39;s a valid assumption, dangerous habit admitted, then this woul=\r\nd\n&gt; &gt;seem to be a case where a metric -- not free -- gave us a false\n&gt; &gt;pos=\r\nitive -- not free -- requiring at least a little bit of\n&gt; &gt;investigation to=\r\n determine root cause -- not free. Metrics are\n&gt; &gt;scarily complex to me, an=\r\nd I wish my world had either fewer of them,\n&gt; &gt;or fewer people relying on t=\r\nhem.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Teams\n&gt; &gt;&gt; using DevCreek don&#39;t seem to change their behavior=\r\n much on the\nbasis of the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; feedback, though, which I find surprising. P=\r\nerhaps the feedback\nisn&#39;t really\n&gt; &gt;&gt; all that useful, perhaps we don&#39;t hav=\r\ne the right presentation of the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; information, or perhaps people just ne=\r\ned to get used to the idea\nthat the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; information is there for them.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;Or, another favorite equine victim of mine, perhaps people are\n&gt; &gt;decid=\r\nedly less rational than we routinely realize.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Of course, once having=\r\n typed this in, I immediately jump to another\n&gt; &gt;way of seeing it: put scar=\r\ne quotes around &#39;rational&#39;. To make this\n&gt; &gt;second idea more clear, I&#39;ll sa=\r\ny I might have theorized that the team\n&gt; &gt;would respond (incorrectly) by &#39;r=\r\nationally&#39; honoring feedback that\n&gt; &gt;didn&#39;t meet its -- what words to use h=\r\nere? -- gestalt self-image. In\n&gt; &gt;fact, the team responded (correctly) by &#39;=\r\nirrationally&#39; ignoring\n&gt; &gt;feedback that didn&#39;t meet that gestalt self-image=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;A third way in to the puzzle: information is not useful until it i=\r\ns\n&gt; &gt;integrated into a framework of meaning. At any given time, any such\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;framework has a loose boundary (the so-called hermeneutic horizon),\n&gt; &gt;whi=\r\nch represents the only possible locations where new information can\n&gt; &gt;be f=\r\nit. If the boundary is not situated where the new information can\n&gt; &gt;be fit=\r\n in, it will be ignored, hence useless. So it pays to focus\n&gt; &gt;one&#39;s attent=\r\nion not just on generating data, but on generating the\n&gt; &gt;data that will fi=\r\nt the current boundary for the current group and\n&gt; &gt;enable that group to be=\r\ncome what it wants.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;This is why I am so negative about quests for ev=\r\ner-more-detailed\n&gt; &gt;metrics, or one-size-fits-all approaches to measuring p=\r\nrogress in\n&gt; &gt;human enterprise. Down this road lies Taylor, and a reversion=\r\n of some\n&gt; &gt;particularly hard won 20th century knowledge. When someone post=\r\ns\n&gt; &gt;about &quot;what metric is best?&quot;, I wish we could all post back &quot;the one\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;that helps your team&quot;.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;I&#39;m reminded of a magnificent insight grant=\r\ned to me by Jerome Bruner,\n&gt; &gt;who somewhere remarks that the purpose of the=\r\nrapy is not to reveal the\n&gt; &gt;truth, but to construct a story which enables =\r\nthe patient to move\n&gt; &gt;towards his or her goal.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Cheers,\n&gt; &gt;Hill\n&gt; &gt;W=\r\nanna learn XP skills the hard way?
