The exit<br/>\n&gt; condition of this while is managed by another thread. In a given<br/>\n&gt; moment the test runs only the thread with the while cycle, so I want<br/>\n&gt; to test only the code behind the first thread. This means that this<br/>\n&gt; cycle is an infinite one. At a moment (let&#39;s say, after 2 or 3 time<br/>\n&gt; processing of the instructions in the while cycle) the testing<br/>\n&gt; terminates, without any exception rasing, or error message, the<br/>\n&gt; application simply stops. I suppose is something about timeout... (??)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Is anybody, who met this problem too? May I ask him to help me?<br/>\n&gt; Thank&#39;s a lot!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I have very little experience with testing threaded code, but can I<br/>\nstart with the basics? Have you tested everything that isn&#39;t threaded?<br/>\nCan you move as much code as possible outside of the threading<br/>\nmechanism so that you can test it without recourse to threads.<br/>\nFinally, is there a way that you could mock the threading construct<br/>\nand test the code with these mock threads?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe principle here is that you should move as much code as possible<br/>\nout of the difficult to test areas. This is often easier said than<br/>\ndone, but it&#39;s always worth a try.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust a couple of thoughts.<br/>\n<br/>\nSimon<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nwww.simonpeter.org</div>",
