If you are trying to test that you can actually create an ArrayList of your user defined type - as in your example - I would also test that you really can add an object of that type, and that you cannot add an object that is not of that type,...I don&#39;t want to test the ArrayList itself, since I trust Sun has done that, but I would want to test that it correctly recognizes what is and isn&#39;t my custom type.<br/>\n<br/>\n-------------- Original message -------------- <br/>\nFrom: Kamal Ahmed &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:KAhmed@...\">KAhmed@...</a>&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\nHi,<br/>\nHow can we test if a &quot;new&quot; instance of an object of a certain user defined<br/>\ntype is created? e.g.<br/>\n<br/>\nreqFieldTypes = new ArrayList&lt;FieldType&gt;(fieldTypes.length);<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n-Kamal.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
