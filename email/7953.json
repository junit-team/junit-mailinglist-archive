This fails if you subclass Point. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Eh?  instanceof returns true if the left-hand side argument is a<br/>\n&gt;subclass as well.  It also returns false if its null, which makes it<br/>\n&gt;particularly handy for objects.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The false-if-null thing I did not know, although it makes perfect sense now that I think of it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;If you mean that it ends up breaking symmetry if subclassed, I&#39;ll<br/>\n&gt;agree.  However, as Joshua Bloch pointed out (to me at least) in<br/>\n&gt;Effective Java, &quot;There isn&#39;t any way to extend an instantiable object<br/>\n&gt;and add an aspect while preserving the Equals contract&quot;.  You&#39;re either<br/>\n&gt;going to break symmetry or transitivity no matter how you do it.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I read your conclusion to be that it is therefore all right to code equals() in such a way as to report falsely that two objects are equal, because there&#39;s no way to make a superclass and subclass follow the equals() contract. Is that what you are saying? If it is, then I think it&#39;s all the more important to implement equals() in a failsafe way, since Bloch claims (and I don&#39;t doubt him, but I would need to think about it) that a subclass with more attributes than its superclass cannot be equal to it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAssuming that I did a reasonable job of expressing that, what do you say?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJ.
