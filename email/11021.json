But when I<br/>\n&gt; use the ANT, it says the BUILD failed and it does not execute the<br/>\n&gt; Thread.sleep line in one of the tests. Does anyone know why is it<br/>\n&gt; doing that? Any help on this matter would be really appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>How do you know it isn&#39;t executing that line?
