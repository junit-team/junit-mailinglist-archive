If your issue is simply that you want to guarantee the ordering of your test cases, you can cheat by having white box knowledge of the implementation of junit. If you don&#39;t use the reflection method of adding tests (i.e. - explicitly adding the test) you know that the tests will execute in the same order in which they were added. Note that JUnit does not advertise any contract in this area and the underlying implementation of test case execution could change at any release. \n\nIf your issue is that you want to have multiple failures in a given test case before failing the test case, there are some alternatives out there. Search the forum for multiple failures. To answer your question on doing a one time setup for all of your tests - check the FAQ. \n\nFunctional testing of API&#39;s have many of the same design and usage patterns of any functional test tool out on the market. Keep in mind that if tests have dependencies - you will effectively be blocked from executing dependent tests when you encounter a failure. This has a bad smell, weather you are doing functional, unit - or using a commercial tool like Silk or LoadRunner. That being said, sometimes it does make sense to couple test cases, or a series of test cases - but you need to understand the tradeoffs before doing this. \n\n\n\nCheers,\nBill \n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: erikstunkat \n  To: junit@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Friday, April 19, 2002 7:25 AM\n  Subject: [junit] Re: junit tests and functional/ integration tests\n\n\n  Hi Bill\n\n  We have junit tests and java property files. They run in a specific \n  sequence and get their data from the property files. That is fine for \n  completed tests.\n  But we need something like a workflow in the tests; eg. test1 creates \n  something in the database and test x uses the same data to verify \n  some additional testcases.\n  We started to examine jxunit, unfortunately it is not that well \n  documented..\n\n  cheers\n\n  erik\n\n  --- In junit@y..., &quot;Bill Laird&quot; &lt;wlaird@w...&gt; wrote:\n  &gt; Hi Erik - I&#39;m not quite sure what you are trying to say. Unit tests \n  in the classic sense are mutually exclusive from functional tests. \n  There may be some overlap in coverage, but there is no union of test \n  cases. \n  &gt; \n  &gt; Is what you are trying to say is that you want to use Junit as a \n  framework and harness for black box functional testing of Java API&#39;s? \n  &gt; \n  &gt; \n  &gt; Cheers,\n  &gt; Bill \n  &gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n  &gt;   From: erikstunkat \n  &gt;   To: junit@y... \n  &gt;   Sent: Wednesday, April 17, 2002 4:26 AM\n  &gt;   Subject: [junit] junit tests and functional/ integration tests\n  &gt; \n  &gt; \n  &gt;   Hi,\n  &gt;   I know that unit tests should run on their own and every test \n  should \n  &gt;   be executable of its own - but..\n  &gt;   we want to use unit tests for a QA related functional framework \n  and \n  &gt;   we yet defined some tasks with ant to run tests in a specific \n  order. \n  &gt;   My question: is there any extension for junit to define \n  properties \n  &gt;   for tests in a more straightforward way then java properties \n  files \n  &gt;   (xml?) and to combine several unit tests with global attributes \n  and \n  &gt;   properties?\n  &gt; \n  &gt;   thanks in advance!\n  &gt; \n  &gt;   erik stunkat\n  &gt; \n  &gt; \n  &gt;         Yahoo!
