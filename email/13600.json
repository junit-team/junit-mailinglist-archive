Are these all hand-coded?<br/>\n<br/>\nOrganizations that do *not* attempt testing these methods:  How do <br/>\nthey report their code coverage?  For instance, do they &quot;back-out&quot;<br/>\nthe <br/>\namount of code represented by getters/setters and then report the <br/>\npercentage of remaining code covered?  Or - do they lower the goal to <br/>\nsomething considerably less than 100%?<br/>\n<br/>\nIs anyone actually striving for near-100% code coverage?<br/>\n<br/>\n_Marvin</div>",
