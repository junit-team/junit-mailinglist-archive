It=\r\n is a symbol of\n&gt; &gt; my commitment to this minmium level of professional eth=\r\nics.  I WILL\n&gt; &gt; TEST MY CODE.\n&gt;\n&gt; Bob,\n&gt;\n&gt; While I don&#39;t agree with you 10=\r\n0% on Test First being THE solution, or\n&gt; THE right approach in ALL cases, =\r\nI am definitely more in your camp\n&gt; than not.\n\n\nI agree.  TDD is a powerful=\r\n tool, but not as much as &quot;simple testing&quot;.  If a\ndeveloper prefers to writ=\r\ne code first and tests then, that&#39;s perfectly fine\nwith me.  The important =\r\npoint here is that this developer needs to agree\nthat writing tests is part=\r\n of her job.  At least to a certain extent.\n\nWhen Roongko and I were at Sun=\r\nLabs, we headed a research project\n&gt; called ADL (Assertion Definition Langu=\r\nage) that was close in spirit to\n&gt; test first: designers/developers would w=\r\nrite the spec for the code\n&gt; before writing it.  The spec included both syn=\r\ntax (e.g. the method\n&gt; signature) as well as semantics (what the method was=\r\n supposed to do in\n&gt; terms of assertions (the A in ADL) - for example: if X=\r\n &lt; 0 throw\n&gt; InvalidArgumentException)).\n\n\nI am not a big fan of design by =\r\ncontract (DBC) for the simple reason that it\nis just not applicable in the =\r\nreal world, and if you look around, the only\nillustrations of DBC that you =\r\nsee are for Money, BankAccount or Bowling\nprograms.\n\nWhen you start solving=\r\n real problems, this kind of assertions is either\nsuper simple, and you can=\r\n just use assertions in your code, or too\ncomplicated to express with a DSL=\r\n and you&#39;re then better off writing a test\nfor it.  DBC sits in-between the=\r\nse two worlds and has never caught on for\nthat reason.\n\nMore details here &lt;=\r\nhttp://www.jroller.com/page/cbeust/20021213&gt; (I wrote\nthis four years ago, =\r\nbut my points still stand).\n\nSome developers, including some very good ones=\r\n, are not wired to think test\n&gt; first.  They could do it, but they would no=\r\nt be very effective at it -\n&gt; like asking a left-handed person to write wit=\r\nh their write hand.\n\n\nGood point.  Another reason is that there are many si=\r\ntuations where TDD is\nsimply not feasible. I&#39;ve come across enough of these=\r\n scenarios these past\nyears to start looking at TDD as something that is on=\r\nly *sometimes* useful.\nIf you&#39;re in a situation where you can use TDD, then=\r\n by all means, go ahead\nand do it:  I certainly know how good it makes you =\r\nfeel.  But keep in mind\nyou&#39;re lucky in the same way that somebody who can =\r\nuse Java to get their job\ndone is more lucky than someone forced to use COB=\r\nOL :-)\n\nAgain, it&#39;s a matter of philosophy.  If all the developers on your =\r\nteam\nstrongly feel that writing tests is part of their job, you will obtain=\r\n\nsoftware of equal quality as you would from a team of TDD nuts.\n\n-- \nC=E9d=\r\nric\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
