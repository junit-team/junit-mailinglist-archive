Could anyone offer me so \n&gt; guidance on this issue.\n\nHere&#39;s my take on the subject, from a Test-driven Development\nperspective.\n\nYou write your test first, calling whatever methods you need on the\nclass you are developing.  Those methods are naturally public, since\nthey are external behaviour.  This means that all methods called by\ntests are public.\n\nAs you refactor you will be creating private methods (as you extract\nmethods and so on).  These do not need to be explicitly tested, as the\nbahaviour of the class has not changed... just details of where the code\nresides.\n\nSo... tests drive the creation of public methods, refactoring drives the\ncreation of private methods.\n\nThere are times when one of these private, created-due-to-refactoring\nmethods is useful to call from outside.  Then you make it public.  With\nTDD you will already have a test in place, when you realize that an\nexisting private method does what you need.\n\nSummary: You don&#39;t need to test private methods if you&#39;re doing TDD\nrigorously.\n\nDave\n-- \nDave Astels (dave@...)\n  Coauthor of &quot;A Practical Guide to XP&quot;\n  Editor of the Test-Driven Development Edition of The Coad Letter\n    (subscribe at www.thecoadletter.com)\n  Presenter at XP2002 (www.xp2002.org) of:\n    the &quot;XP For One&quot; tutorial & &quot;Refactoring with UML&quot; paper\nCEO & Master Software Craftsman, Saorsa Development Inc.\nwww.saorsa.com\n&quot;An Agile Software Studio&quot;\n\n\n\n",
