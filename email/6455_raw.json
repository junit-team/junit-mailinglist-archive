I cite\nhttp://www.xprogramming.com/testfram.htm. To paraphrase: a TestCase\nclass is a test fixture; a TestCase instance is an individual test\noperating on the fixture.\n\n&gt;What we have a one to one correspondence of test classes to production\n&gt;classes. For example, a CalculatorEngine.java and\n&gt;CalculatorEngineTest.java (extended from TestCase) in parallel\n&gt;directories so that they&#39;re in the same package. When we we&#39;ve written\na\n&gt;few tests and find that some setup code is repeated in more than one\ntest\n&gt;class (often because it&#39;s setting up a mock database or file system)\nthat\n&gt;goes into something we call a XxxxTestUtility class - maybe\n&gt;OracleTestUtility.java.\n\nWhy &quot;Utility&quot;? Is there no better name for what that class is doing?\nMaybe you didn&#39;t know what it was until now. Still, &quot;SetUp&quot; would be a\nbetter choice, don&#39;t you find?\n\n&gt;I&#39;m wondering if our TestUtility is what you&#39;re calling a fixture even\n&gt;tho it doesn&#39;t extend TestCase. This class will setup the sometimes\n&gt;complicated objects, often instantiating several objects and setting\n&gt;their state. It&#39;s methods are then called by the test classes that\nextend\n&gt;TestCase and are called in test suites. \n\nYou are right: your *Utility classes are test fixtures and you are\nusing TestCase to group tests together.\n\nYour *Utility classes should be TestCase descendants and you should use\nTestSuite to group tests together. If you do that, then you&#39;ll be using\nJUnit the way it was intended. You seem to be going out of your way to\nbuild something that JUnit gives you free of charge.\n\n&gt;We still have a one-to-one correspondence of test classes to\nproduction\n&gt;classes which seems to help make sure that we test everything. \n\nJustify this. I typically do not have a 1:1 correspondence. I cannot\nsee how having that correspondence (on its own) gives me any more or\nless confidence in testing everything.\n\n&gt;And tells\n&gt;us where to look for code that tests a given class. \n\nI admit that this is a nice consequence of the 1:1 correspondence.\nStill, if the TestCase classes are named well, it will be clear. It&#39;s\nnot as though I split my tests into many test cases and those test\ncases are named something Martian compared to the class name.\n\n&gt;If it matters, this\n&gt;project was started a few years before we&#39;d heard of unit tests and\nlong\n&gt;before test driven development reached us.\n\nOf course it matters. The world has learned since then. :)\n\nTo be clear, what you&#39;re doing is in no way wrong, except that you&#39;re\ndoing work on your own that JUnit does for you. The TestCase class is\ndesigned to represent a fixture so that each test can communicate\nsimply with the fixture through instance-level attributes. By placing\nthe fixture in a collaborating object, you&#39;re simply making that\ncommunication slightly more complex. If it works, then I won&#39;t argue,\nbut you&#39;re doing more than you need to.\n\nThanks for sharing your experience with us!\n\nJ. B.
