However, your example with\np=\r\nayment processing is completely nightmare for me. I didn&#39;t understand\nwhat =\r\ndoes the application, what client thought and what what problem\nyou strike =\r\nwith. I also didn&#39;t understand your Stability and\nReliability aspect. I gue=\r\nss this is because I didn&#39;t understand your\npayment processing example. \n\n-=\r\n-- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;kentb&quot; &lt;kentb@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; All,\n&gt; \n&gt; Last =\r\nweek on succeeding days I encountered two situations, one where\n&gt; system-le=\r\nvel tests were valuable and unit tests would have been\nuseless and\n&gt; one wh=\r\nere the reverse was true. Since simply the level of the tests\nis not\n&gt; suff=\r\nicient to decide where to test, I thought a bit more about how I\nshould\n&gt; d=\r\necide where to test. I came to three criteria:\n&gt;   * The cost of writing an=\r\nd running the test\n&gt;   * The stability of the interface the test is, errr..=\r\n., testing\n&gt;   * The reliability of the code satisfying the test\n&gt; \n&gt; I wro=\r\nte this up in a little paper:\n&gt; www.threeriversinstitute.org/WhereToTest.ht=\r\nml. Comments welcome.\n&gt; \n&gt; Kent Beck\n&gt; Three Rivers Institute\n&gt;\n\n\n\n",
