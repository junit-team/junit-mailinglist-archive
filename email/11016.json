I have  a suite that lines up about 25 test <br/>\nclasses ( each containing say 10 test methods ) and I iterate for 300 <br/>\nobjects to add these tests to a suite. I would like to know any best <br/>\npractices to ensure I don&#39;t get any OutOfMemoryErrors. I changed the <br/>\njvm tag to increase virtual memory to say 512 but, if I keep adding <br/>\nmany tests to this suite, what would be the next item to ensure I&#39;m <br/>\ndoing. I am also setting TestCase member variables to null where <br/>\npossible. What would be the next step? The reason I ask is because I <br/>\nwould like to push JUnit to the limit and have it test all day and <br/>\nnight for a large application. Any help or comments would be <br/>\nappreciated. Even different design techniques are welcome.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers!<br/>\nClaudio</div>",
