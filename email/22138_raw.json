To have the rule working in several tests, you have =\r\nto place the Rule in each test.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; However, I am searching for a way t=\r\no activate a Rule for all the tests that are executed, without needing to a=\r\ndd the rule to each test. Perhaps by specifying a Java property parameter w=\r\nhen running the tests (I could also set this as a global Java option, there=\r\nfore being used upon each execution of the JVM).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Do you know if thi=\r\ns is possible?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The reason why I need this, is: I am making the plan=\r\ns and gathering the ideas for creating a simple Swing application that will=\r\n display the results of the executed tests (just like the JUnit view in Ecl=\r\nipse/Idea/Netbeans, but perhaps with more details, and also available for a=\r\nnyone, not just IDE users). Currently I developed a small agent rule, that =\r\nyou can place in your test, and it will report to the console the status of=\r\n your tests (the Swing console runs remotely).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; This is ok, but it m=\r\neans that you will have to add this rule to each and every test that you ha=\r\nve. It also means that will not be an easy task to disable this rule, if yo=\r\nu don&#39;t want it anymore.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Therefore a possibility to enable Rules gl=\r\nobally for all tests I think is the best solution for my case, and also a g=\r\nood tool to have for various other tasks.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; What do you think? Also, =\r\nwhat do you think about the Swing console idea?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Cheers,\n&gt; &gt; Bogdan\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
