    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2033677932\">My premise is that the tests are the design, not simply related thereto.  We<br/>\nhave a list of possible results of creating an order.  These possible<br/>\noutcomes determine the things we have to test.  In creating the tests, we<br/>\ncreate the design.  It then becomes the tests that drive the design rather<br/>\nthan being a trailing afterthought to determine whether we anwered the<br/>\nrequirements.<br/>\n<br/>\nConventional Methodology:<br/>\n<br/>\n       Requirements ----&gt; Design ----&gt; Construction ----&gt; Testing -- --&gt;<br/>\nDelivery<br/>\n                            ^                                       |<br/>\n                            |-----------&lt;  Revision of Design &lt;-----|<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSuggested Methodology :<br/>\n<br/>\n       Request ----&gt; Tests ----&gt; Design ----&gt; Construction -- --&gt; Delivery<br/>\n                       ^                                     |<br/>\n                       |---------&lt; Revision of Tests &lt;-------|<br/>\n<br/>\nBy devising the tests before construction, a couple of things are gained.<br/>\nFirst, the request, tests and designs are closer together in the process.<br/>\nThis improves communication and the reliability of the design.  Second, the<br/>\ntests drive the development process instead of a logical design improving<br/>\nboth the quality of the design and the answer the solution provides to the<br/>\noriginal request.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards,<br/>\n<br/>\nJason Tryon<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S.  It&#39;s pronounced Try - on ... like to try on a hat.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Shane Duan [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sduan@...\">sduan@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, July 18, 2001 11:55 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [junit] Why doesn&#39;t JUnit count asserts?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI would agree and also I would like to bring up a couter-example to Tyron&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\nIMHO, a unit test should be closely related to the design of the class.<br/>\nTyron&#39;s<br/>\nexmple seems more like a black box test rather than a white box one.  And a<br/>\nunit<br/>\ntest should be a white-box test.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the example should be modified as the following:<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we are talking about an Order class, a call getStatus() to another layer<br/>\n(the<br/>\nclass should be known) with specified ProductID might return different<br/>\nstatus,<br/>\nPENDING (onhand and<br/>\nnot committed), COMMITTED(on hand but committed), IMMINENT(on order or<br/>\nimminent<br/>\narrival), PROTRACTED (protracted arrival), OUT_OF_STOCK(out of stock at the<br/>\nsupplier undetermined), UNAVAILABLE.  Depending on the return status of the<br/>\nproduct ID, a call to Order.create() method on a Order class might throw<br/>\ncreate<br/>\nan Order instance with PENDING status, a ProductUnavailableException, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe point I am trying to make here is that because you know about the class<br/>\nimplementation, a unit is now finer grained in UT.  The language we are<br/>\nspeaking<br/>\nin UT is programming-like rather than business like in AT.<br/>\n<br/>\nJason Rogers wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; I would like to hear everyones thoughts on the topic.<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; Your point about AT&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; is well taken.<br/>\n&gt;     &gt;<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; To my way of thinking, flawed though it might be, a unit<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; describes one<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; scenario of one behavior.  For example, if we&#39;re talking<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; about an ordering<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; system, a specified product might exist in a number of<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; states, onhand and<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; not committed, on hand but committed, on order (imminent<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; arrival), on order<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; (protracted arrival), out of stock at the supplier (undetermined<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; availability) or perhaps even never available again.  A<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; customer wanting to<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; order that product might have patterned responses for<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; each of these states.<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; If the task at hand is to develop a system that will<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; automate the response<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; to a customer placing an order for this item, each<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; possible state and<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; outcome combination constitutes a unit.  Each test case<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; contributing its<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; behavioral rules to the design.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t know, Jason.  It seems to me that unit is, for all intensive<br/>\n&gt; purposes, the class to be tested.  If all of these scenarios are present<br/>\n </span></blockquote>in<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; that one class, then they can be tested at the &quot;unit&quot; level.  If the<br/>\n&gt; scenarios are a combination of objects and their interactions, I think the<br/>\n&gt; test raises to the &quot;acceptance&quot; level.  The thing I take issue with is<br/>\n </span></blockquote>your<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; use of the term &#39;scenarios&#39;, because it conjures up ATs in my mind, but<br/>\n </span></blockquote>that<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; may just be me.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It all comes down to what is the best way to write unit tests.  Right?<br/>\n&gt; That&#39;s a heated discussion from which I have learned to stay away (for the<br/>\n&gt; most part).  Everyone has their style and most are very adamant about it.<br/>\n&gt; There are some general principles that we can all agree upon, but once<br/>\n </span></blockquote>that<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; is done, the proofs are more or less stylistic.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Some general principles can be found at<br/>\n&gt; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-12-2000/jw-1221-junit-2.html\">http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-12-2000/jw-1221-junit-2.html</a>&gt;.  I<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t agree with the all of the things listed there, but most of it sounds<br/>\n&gt; good and right to me.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -Jason<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
