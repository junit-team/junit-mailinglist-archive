I generally adv=\r\nise against doing this purely for tests and instead look at implementing yo=\r\nur own hamcrest matcher. \n&gt; \n&gt; On Nov 17, 2012, at 7:39 PM, &quot;halfpirate1210=\r\n&quot; &lt;bell_beauty12@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hello.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Newbie here.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I=\r\n created a class (let&#39;s say class A) and in my JUnit class, I created an ob=\r\nject (let&#39;s say object A1) from class A. Object A1 contains several variabl=\r\nes and most importantly, an array of objects which are instantiated from an=\r\nother class (let&#39;s say class B); so the elements in that array are objects,=\r\n not data types like int, string, etc.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; So I wanted to test this ar=\r\nray of objects with another array of objects by simply creating another obj=\r\nect; A2 from class A. I wanted to test using assertArrayEquals and the resu=\r\nlt is red bar.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; So my question is why did the test fail? I&#39;m thinki=\r\nng probably objects are always different since they are based on reference?=\r\n But then again assertArrayEquals checks array length and content.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Many thanks,\n&gt; &gt; halfpirate1210\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of th=\r\nis message have been removed]\n&gt;\n\n\n",
