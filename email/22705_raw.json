I think my first reac=\r\ntion just stems from the Builder word. I hear Builder, I expect a fluid int=\r\nerface. That doesn&#39;t really mean very much (as I said this was nitpicking) =\r\nexcept that if others have that reaction, well then it is surprising, for w=\r\nhatever importance that carries. BTW, I didn&#39;t really love it with @Rule ei=\r\nther (although I think for @Parameters and @DataPoints it&#39;s more justified)=\r\n, but it didn&#39;t go against the grain of my expectations the same way Builde=\r\nr did.\n\nIn terms of an alternative design, here is what comes to mind (alth=\r\nough I obviously have not spent the time thinking about this that you have)=\r\n:\n\n@RunWith(DynamicRunner.class)\npublic class OnlyYes {\n      @DynamicRunne=\r\nr.Provider\n      public static Runner createRunner() {\n          return new=\r\n RunnerBuilder()\n                .ofListed(new Listed(...))\n               =\r\n .withFilter(CategoryFilter.of(Yes.class))\n                .build();\n      =\r\n}\n}\n\nOf course you could imagine the RunnerBuilder folding in all the other=\r\n three annotations by using a DynamicRunner whenever you needed them, but I=\r\n&#39;m less sure about that.\n\n         new RunnerBuilder(Parameterized.class)\n =\r\n            .withParameters(Arrays.asList(...))\n             .withRule(new =\r\nMethodRule(){...})\n             .build()\n\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, Da=\r\nvid Saff &lt;david@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; On Wed, May 12, 2010 at 2:56 PM, yme0987654=\r\n321 &lt;yme0987654321@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Beautiful, you definitely hit on the rig=\r\nht design limitations and found a great new direction.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m not posi=\r\ntive I love the conventions of having public variables do this kind of thin=\r\ng, but maybe that will grow on me (a more traditional Builder pattern strik=\r\nes me as less surprising), but that is nitpicking.\n&gt; \n&gt; We talked a lot abo=\r\nut this.  Configuration from objects grabbed from\n&gt; annotated fields or met=\r\nhods has already been done incidentally at\n&gt; several points throughout the =\r\ncodebase (i.e. @Parameters, @DataPoints,\n&gt; @Rule).  We realized that this n=\r\new runner would represent a commitment\n&gt; to the idea that this was a worthw=\r\nhile design pattern, but found it\n&gt; less surprising _within the context of =\r\njunit_ than the alternatives.\n&gt; If you have a sketch of a different design,=\r\n I&#39;d be happy to discuss\n&gt; it.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; The bottom line is that the new desig=\r\nn direction is great, providing substantial flexibility and power while kee=\r\nping things simple.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks!\n&gt; \n&gt;    David Saff\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thank you ve=\r\nry much.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In junit@yahoogroups.com, David Saff &lt;david@&gt; wrote:\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; All,\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; So Categories seemed to get some people excited\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; (http://www.google.com/search?q=3Djunit+categories&tbs=3Dqdr:w3), but we\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; couldn&#39;t help feeling that we&#39;d gone about it the wrong way. =A0From t=\r\nhe\n&gt; &gt;&gt; design perspective, why have a whole Runner just for filtering by\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; category? =A0There are other things you can filter on. =A0And, there we=\r\nre\n&gt; &gt;&gt; some definitely hackish parts of the implementation. =A0And, it tur=\r\nns\n&gt; &gt;&gt; out, there were bugs in Categories, (such as\n&gt; &gt;&gt; http://github.com=\r\n/KentBeck/junit/issues#issue/74) that were very hard\n&gt; &gt;&gt; to elegantly fix =\r\nwith the current design. =A0And, (sorry, maven\n&gt; &gt;&gt; hopefuls), but we were =\r\nanxious to get back into the meat of the code.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; So, the first 4.9 =\r\nsnapshot is up today, with a new way of specifying\n&gt; &gt;&gt; suites, called Suit=\r\neBuilder. =A0SuiteBuilder allows for flexible\n&gt; &gt;&gt; specification of where t=\r\no find the classes containing tests, and how\n&gt; &gt;&gt; to filter the resulting r=\r\nunners.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; This suite class lists the explicit test classes to consi=\r\nder running,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; and then filters it down to only those tests or classes a=\r\nnnotated with\n&gt; &gt;&gt; `@Category(Yes.class)`:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0 @RunWith(S=\r\nuiteBuilder.class)\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0 public static class OnlyYes {\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =A0 =\r\n=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 @Classes\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 public Li=\r\nsted classes=3D new Listed(Yes1.class, Yes2.class, No1.class);\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\n=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 @RunnerFilter\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =\r\npublic CategoryFilter filter=3D CategoryFilter.include(Yes.class);\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =A0=\r\n =A0 =A0 }\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; We hope to soon include other implementations for the =\r\n@Classes\n&gt; &gt;&gt; annotation, including a classpath-searching test gatherer. =\r\n=A0Other\n&gt; &gt;&gt; implementations for @RunnerFilter also make sense (if you loo=\r\nk close,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; you&#39;ll see that RunnerFilter implementations can also re-orde=\r\nr\n&gt; &gt;&gt; runners, as well as selecting them).\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Please have fun, and =\r\nlet us know how it works for you. =A0Thanks,\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =A0 =A0David Saff\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo! =\r\nGroups Links\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n",
