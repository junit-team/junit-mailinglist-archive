Here are some\n&gt; comments on the experience.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; I extended BlockJUnit4ClassRunner and override the invoke(...) method\n&gt; t=\r\no verify the mock objects after the test has run, but before tear-down.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; This way reduces the amount of code in the custom runner. I also\n&gt; didn&#39;t=\r\n have to duplicate existing functionality because the invoke\n&gt; method let m=\r\ne hook in at the right point.\n&gt; \n&gt; However, I still had to use classes in t=\r\nhe org.junit.internal package,\n&gt; which feels wrong. Have I missed the right=\r\n way of doing this?\n&gt; \n&gt; Other niggles...\n&gt; \n&gt; - The classes are compiled f=\r\nor Java 6 only, but only seem to need\n&gt; language features from 5 and above.=\r\n Can the release be compiled for\n&gt; Java 5?\n&gt; \n&gt; - The JUnit 4.4 classes hav=\r\ne been deprecated *and* moved to another\n&gt; package, which breaks any code t=\r\nhat used them. There&#39;s no point in\n&gt; doing both. Either break backward comp=\r\natability or keep backward\n&gt; compatability and deprecate the classes. I&#39;d p=\r\nrefer the latter, since\n&gt; it will allow me to do a jMock with new features =\r\nsupporting both JUnit\n&gt; 4.4 and 4.5 and then release a version that brings =\r\nsupport forward to\n&gt; 4.5 onwards.\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; --Nat.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In junit@y=\r\nahoogroups. &lt;mailto:junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt; com, &quot;Nat\nPryce&quot;\n&gt; &lt;nat.pryce@=\r\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; JUnit 4.5 breaks jMock 2 because the TestMethod class has =\r\nbeen moved\n&gt; &gt; to a different package.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; It&#39;s our fault for subclass=\r\ning JUnit4ClassRunner, but it would be nice\n&gt; &gt; if JUnit4ClassRunner did no=\r\nt change at all in this release.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --Nat\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 2008/6/16 Kent Bec=\r\nk &lt;kentb@&gt;:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; All,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Following our discussions last week, we =\r\nhave incorporated the old\n&gt; &gt; &gt; JUnit4ClassRunner into 4.5.
