It looks promising, but I have not tested it.  My next &quot;spare time&quot; <br/>\n&gt; project is to retrofit the parsing I mentioned above to use HTMLParser.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>HTMLParser does handle lots of dirty html, and its been built ground-up with a large suit of tests taken from real-world html. I started the project 2 years back, as other parsers looked too complex to me at the time (most of them still do). <br/>\n<br/>\nRight now, the HTMLParser project is entering an interesting phase. Together with Josh Kerievsky, we&#39;ve been continuously refactoring and adding capabilities to do unit-testing of html and xml content - this helped us to unit-test xsl stylesheets. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor html testing, the parser treats html as dirty xml, and there is a method - assertXmlEquals() - this does the job of xml comparison - with the advantage of being able to comapre &quot;dirty xml/html&quot;  - tags don&#39;t need to be closed. And yet, tag sets like <br/>\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  and &lt;td/&gt; will be considered equivalent. <br/>\n<br/>\nKen, if you need any help in using the parser, feel free to post questions on the htmparser-user list.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards,<br/>\nSomik<br/>\n********************************************<br/>\n  Somik Raha                     <br/>\n  Extreme Programmer and Coach   <br/>\n  Industrial Logic, Inc.          <br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:somik@...\">somik@...</a>      <br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://industriallogic.com\">http://industriallogic.com</a> <br/>\n  Voice : 510-540-8336      <br/>\n  Toll-free : 866-540-8336           <br/>\n  Fax   : 510-540-8936            <br/>\n********************************************<br/>\n.. the major danger in vertical thinking is not that of being trapped <br/>\nby the obvious but of failing to realize that one may be trapped by<br/>\nthe obvious.
