Thanks\nfor w=\r\nriting that up!\n\nSeems to me that the &quot;third way&quot; here is the one I gravita=\r\nte towards:\npass the narrowest possible interface into the method in questi=\r\non.  In\neach case, you could define an interface with two getters and pass\n=\r\nthat into the method.  Your production code would have &quot;Customer\nimplements=\r\n MortalityCriteria&quot; for the first scenario.  For the second\ncase, you could=\r\n have the &quot;legacy&quot; method cobble together a dynamic\nimplementation, or the =\r\nclass could contain a private implementation\nthat it constructs only once t=\r\no call the new method.  The worst\npenalty you pay is having big classes lik=\r\ne Customer bogged down with a\nton of interfaces, but in my practice that do=\r\nesn&#39;t seem to happen too\noften.\n\nFYI, I thought your initial message about =\r\nthe idea was clear too, so I\nmay not be your target audience.  ;)\n\nOn Wed, =\r\nAug 27, 2008 at 3:38 PM, kentb &lt;kentb@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; All,\n&gt;\n&gt; In s=\r\npite of the one feedback message I got that my recent post about\n&gt; abstract=\r\n vs. concrete parameters was clear, I expanded the idea into a\n&gt; paper: www=\r\n.threeriversinstitute.org/AbstractVsConcreteParameters.html. In\n&gt; short, it=\r\n tries to resolve the apparent contradiction between achieving\n&gt; testable c=\r\node sometimes by making parameters concrete and sometimes by\n&gt; making param=\r\neters abstract.
