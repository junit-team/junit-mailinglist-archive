I have a set of classes whose values are set \nfrom a file by a Reader object. Now I want to test whether these \nvalues are set correctly. I can use preset values for testing \npurpose. But due to the large number and complexity of these classes \nit would be very difficult and cumbersome to create objects with \nthese preset values manually for testing against the ones created by \nthe Reader.\n\nI am thinking of creating a helper class for each of the above \nclasses. I will pass it the object to compare, and it will compare \nthe object&#39;s data against pre-defined values that will be stored in \nthe helper classes. I will need to extend junit&#39;s Assert class for \nthese helper class, since they will assert if there is a data \nmismatch. So my question is,  is it okay to extend Assert in my own \nclasses ? Has anyone faced this problem before, and if so how did you \nsolve this ? Any help will be appreciated.\n\nThanks,\n- krishnan\n\n\n",
