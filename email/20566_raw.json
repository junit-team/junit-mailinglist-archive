To be specific, let suppose\n&gt;that there is 3 different teams with team=\r\n leader in each one and\n&gt;project manager makes status meeting once a week. =\r\nIf I was a project\n&gt;manager that is what would I say. But if I was team lea=\r\nder and heard\n&gt;this from my project manager, than I would think that there =\r\nis\n&gt;definitely problem with my managing.\n&gt;\n&gt;1) Perhaps, I don&#39;t know what e=\r\nverybody does on daily basis, so I\n&gt;spend a lot of time to get it out once =\r\na week.\n&gt;2) Perhaps, I involve my team excessively in preparation to the st=\r\natus\n&gt;meeting and I should just live them along. I should use information\n&gt;=\r\nthat I receive from them on daily basis.\n&gt;3) Perhaps, I report just too man=\r\ny details of what&#39;s going on and I\n&gt;should cut it off.\n&gt;\n&gt;So, potentially t=\r\nhis highlights some managing problem.\n&gt;\n&gt;--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Ken=\r\nt Beck&quot; &lt;kentb@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I had no idea the weekly meeting was cost =\r\n20% of our capacity. What\n&gt;I said was, &quot;The weekly status meeting isn&#39;t tha=\r\nt big a deal. You\n&gt;could cut your prep time in half without losing any of t=\r\nhe value to me\n&gt;or, I think, to the team.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;  \n&gt;&gt; Cheers,\n&gt;&gt;  \n&gt;&gt; Kent Bec=\r\nk\n&gt;&gt; Three Rivers Institute\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;   _____  \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; From: junit@yahoogroups=\r\n.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf\n&gt;Of mfeathers@...\n&gt;&gt; Sent: Tu=\r\nesday, June 10, 2008 9:40 AM\n&gt;&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;&gt; Subject: Re: A=\r\n Note On Data-Gathering (Was Re: [junit] A case for\n&gt;adding logging of asse=\r\nrtions to junit)\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; I think that metrics are fine when peop=\r\nle just treat them as a\n&gt;source of information. The place where people mess=\r\n up is when they\n&gt;reflexively assume that particular numbers indicate probl=\r\nems and that\n&gt;there is some sort of moral imperative to confront all percei=\r\nved\n&gt;problems. The fact is, there is no linkage there other than what we\n&gt;b=\r\nring to the table. People and teams have natural rhythms and we have\n&gt;to ta=\r\nke care when we decide what to optimize. \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; The fact that people are l=\r\ness productive on one particular day out\n&gt;of the week would not surprise me=\r\n. If someone told me that a team was\n&gt;uniformly productive every day of the=\r\n week, I&#39;d actually be rather\n&gt;scared of what I might find if I was to visi=\r\nt them.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Michael\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt;&gt; &gt;From: Mike Hil=\r\nl &lt;mike@industriallogi\n&gt;&lt;mailto:mike%40industriallogic.com&gt; c.com&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;Sent=\r\n: Jun 10, 2008 11:39 AM\n&gt;&gt; &gt;To: junit@yahoogroups. &lt;mailto:junit%40yahoogro=\r\nups.com&gt; com\n&gt;&gt; &gt;Subject: A Note On Data-Gathering (Was Re: [junit] A case =\r\nfor\n&gt;adding logging of assertions to junit)\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;On Tue, Jun 10, 2008 a=\r\nt 10:07 AM, Kent Beck &lt;kentb@earthlink.\n&gt;&lt;mailto:kentb%40earthlink.net&gt; net=\r\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; This is what DevCreek (www.devcreek.com) does, and the resul=\r\nts\n&gt;are often\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; surprising. For example, we noticed that on Wednesdays =\r\nthe\n&gt;DevCreek team\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; itself wrote a quarter of the tests it wrote on ot=\r\nher days. Turns\n&gt;out they\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; were spending most of the day preparing for=\r\n the weekly status\n&gt;meeting.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;So. Side topic, and favorite horse-fl=\r\noggee of mine: did the metric\n&gt;&gt; &gt;do anything for us that simply knowing th=\r\ne team well wouldn&#39;t have\n&gt;&gt; &gt;already done? I&#39;m assuming, here, dangerous h=\r\nabit, that there was no\n&gt;&gt; &gt;team-perceived process-weakness on Wednesdays p=\r\nrior to the metric. If\n&gt;&gt; &gt;that&#39;s a valid assumption, dangerous habit admit=\r\nted, then this would\n&gt;&gt; &gt;seem to be a case where a metric -- not free -- ga=\r\nve us a false\n&gt;&gt; &gt;positive -- not free -- requiring at least a little bit o=\r\nf\n&gt;&gt; &gt;investigation to determine root cause -- not free. Metrics are\n&gt;&gt; &gt;sc=\r\narily complex to me, and I wish my world had either fewer of them,\n&gt;&gt; &gt;or f=\r\newer people relying on them.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Teams\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; using DevCreek don&#39;t se=\r\nem to change their behavior much on the\n&gt;basis of the\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; feedback, thoug=\r\nh, which I find surprising. Perhaps the feedback\n&gt;isn&#39;t really\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; all th=\r\nat useful, perhaps we don&#39;t have the right presentation of the\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; inform=\r\nation, or perhaps people just need to get used to the idea\n&gt;that the\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\ninformation is there for them.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;Or, another favorite equine victim =\r\nof mine, perhaps people are\n&gt;&gt; &gt;decidedly less rational than we routinely r=\r\nealize.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;Of course, once having typed this in, I immediately jump t=\r\no another\n&gt;&gt; &gt;way of seeing it: put scare quotes around &#39;rational&#39;. To make=\r\n this\n&gt;&gt; &gt;second idea more clear, I&#39;ll say I might have theorized that the =\r\nteam\n&gt;&gt; &gt;would respond (incorrectly) by &#39;rationally&#39; honoring feedback that=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; &gt;didn&#39;t meet its -- what words to use here? -- gestalt self-image. In\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt;fact, the team responded (correctly) by &#39;irrationally&#39; ignoring\n&gt;&gt; &gt;feed=\r\nback that didn&#39;t meet that gestalt self-image.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;A third way in to t=\r\nhe puzzle: information is not useful until it is\n&gt;&gt; &gt;integrated into a fram=\r\nework of meaning. At any given time, any such\n&gt;&gt; &gt;framework has a loose bou=\r\nndary (the so-called hermeneutic horizon),\n&gt;&gt; &gt;which represents the only po=\r\nssible locations where new information can\n&gt;&gt; &gt;be fit. If the boundary is n=\r\not situated where the new information can\n&gt;&gt; &gt;be fit in, it will be ignored=\r\n, hence useless. So it pays to focus\n&gt;&gt; &gt;one&#39;s attention not just on genera=\r\nting data, but on generating the\n&gt;&gt; &gt;data that will fit the current boundar=\r\ny for the current group and\n&gt;&gt; &gt;enable that group to become what it wants.\n=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;This is why I am so negative about quests for ever-more-detailed\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt;metrics, or one-size-fits-all approaches to measuring progress in\n&gt;&gt; &gt;hu=\r\nman enterprise. Down this road lies Taylor, and a reversion of some\n&gt;&gt; &gt;par=\r\nticularly hard won 20th century knowledge. When someone posts\n&gt;&gt; &gt;about &quot;wh=\r\nat metric is best?&quot;, I wish we could all post back &quot;the one\n&gt;&gt; &gt;that helps =\r\nyour team&quot;.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;I&#39;m reminded of a magnificent insight granted to me by=\r\n Jerome Bruner,\n&gt;&gt; &gt;who somewhere remarks that the purpose of therapy is no=\r\nt to reveal the\n&gt;&gt; &gt;truth, but to construct a story which enables the patie=\r\nnt to move\n&gt;&gt; &gt;towards his or her goal.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;Cheers,\n&gt;&gt; &gt;Hill\n&gt;&gt; &gt;Wanna=\r\n learn XP skills the hard way?
