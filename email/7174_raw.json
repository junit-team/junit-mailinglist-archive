You can configure it to print everything, just failures,  \nwhatever you want. This article gives step by step instructions on  \nusing SuiteRunner as your JUnit runner:\n\nhttp://www.artima.com/suiterunner/junit.html\n\nIf the build-in print reporter doesn&#39;t satisfy your needs, you can  \ncreate a custom reporter that does whatever you want with the test  \nresults.  For example, this article explains how to build a custom  \nreporter that prints results in XML:\n\nhttp://www.artima.com/suiterunner/xmlreporter.html\n\nBill\n\nOn Monday, March 10, 2003, at 08:01 PM, Jason Rogers wrote:\n\n&gt; On Mon, 2003-03-10 at 00:33, temp_id_649 wrote: I am trying to make a  \n&gt; UI\n&gt; similar to textui, but I want to have all\n&gt; the test cases output in order of execution.  Is there anyway to do\n&gt; this with the existing framework.  In textui as it stands nothing is\n&gt; output for a pased test (other than &quot;.&quot;) and then the failures and\n&gt; errors are each listed seperately.  I want to have each test&#39;s result\n&gt; listed as the tests are executed.\n&gt;\n&gt; ie.  you could have a test passed then a failed test and then another\n&gt; passed test outputed in this order.\n&gt;\n&gt; I hope that I haven&#39;t confused anyone with this roundabout question.\n&gt;\n&gt; M Lavery\n&gt;\n&gt; Two solutions:\n&gt;\n&gt; 1. Give the textui a different ResultPrinter, overrriding the  \n&gt; following:\n&gt;     public void addError(Test test, Throwable t)\n&gt;     public void addFailure(Test test, AssertionFailedError t)\n&gt;     public void endTest(Test test) // if you need to\n&gt;     public void startTest(Test test)\n&gt;\n&gt; 2. Add a TestListener -- in which case you will probably want to give\n&gt; the TestRunner another PrintStream so that the two types of printings\n&gt; don&#39;t get mixed in together if your new one goes to stdout, so you  \n&gt; might\n&gt; as well just do number 1.\n&gt;\n&gt; =jason\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
