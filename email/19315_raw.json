I was using a home-grown one with\na previous employer, but that isn&#39;t (yet - I&#39;m hopeful!) open-sourced\n/ externally available, so I need to make a jump to another one.\n\nI tried EasyMock (1.x) after reading JB&#39;s book a couple of years back\n- I think the state of the art has moved on somewhat since then.\n\nThe closed framework that I used previously seems pretty similar in\nterms of look and feel to rMock 2.0 and JMock 2.0, but I&#39;m open to\nother suggestions.\n\nWhat experiences to people have to share?\n\nCheers,\n\nJames\n\n",
