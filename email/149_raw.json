(Justin Hedley)\r\nFrom: jphedley@...\r\n\r\nI too have been assigned to write unit tests for abstract classes.  Here is \nhow I approached for a few differenct cases:\n\n1)Class declared abstract but with no abstract methods.  As an inner class to \nmy testing class, I made a concrete extension the abstract super class which \nI use for testing purposes.  For example in AbstractFooTest, I created an \ninner class, AbstractFooExtension, which extends AbstractFoo.\n\n2)Class with abstract methods on which the concrete methods have no \ndependencies.  Same as 1) but stub in the abstract methods.  In other words, \nif the abstract methods can&#39;t impact state or are not called by the concrete \nmethods, then I am free to test concrete methods.\n\n3)Class with abstract methods on which the concrete methods do have \ndependencies.  Use Kevin&#39;s methodology.\n\n  \n\njunit@egroups.com wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; You might try simply mimicking the class hierarchy in your test \n&gt; classes.\n&gt; \n&gt; For example, to test an abstract &quot;AbstractNavigator&quot; class, write \n&gt; an &quot;AbstractNavigatorTest&quot; class--also abstract. �You can write all \n&gt; the test cases here that should apply to any type of navigator. �And \n&gt; add an abstract method to it such as:\n&gt; \n&gt; � � public asbstract AbstractNavigator newTestInstance();\n&gt; \n&gt; Now, to test one of the concrete implementations (which I assume you \n&gt; plan to do! :-)), just write a test class as a subclass of \n&gt; AbstractNavigatorTest--mirroring the inheritance hierarchy. \n&gt; Implement \n&gt; that method you declared and you&#39;re pretty much good to go!\n&gt; \n&gt; Does that help? �I have an example which tests java.util.Set (an \n&gt; interface) in this way--just ask and I will send it to you!\n&gt; \n&gt; Kevin\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In junit@egroups.com, Coralee Allaby &lt;cvallaby@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve been using JUnit to test my Java classes for a\n&gt; &gt; few weeks now. �I&#39;ve reached a problem that others\n&gt; &gt; have encountered as well.\n&gt; &gt; Here&#39;s the problem:\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve been asked, by my team leader, to write what&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; called an AbstractNavigator. �It doesn&#39;t matter what a\n&gt; &gt; Navigator is, the important point is that\n&gt; &gt; AbstractNavigator is an abstract class. This abstract\n&gt; &gt; class has a couple subclasses already (MDINavigator\n&gt; &gt; and TabbedPaneNavigator), and more will be written in\n&gt; &gt; the future. �\n&gt; &gt; We want to create unit tests (using JUnit, let&#39;s say\n&gt; &gt; AbstractUnitTest) which will apply to any\n&gt; &gt; AbstractNavigator. �Herein lies the problem. �I can&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; actually test the AbstractNavigator because I can&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &quot;have a(n)&quot; AbstractNavigator since it&#39;s abstract. \n&gt; &gt; Therefore, I need to test a subclass of the\n&gt; &gt; AbstractNavigator, but currently, the only way I see\n&gt; &gt; of doing that (making the AbstractUnitTest &quot;have a&quot;\n&gt; &gt; MDINavigator) restricts the abstractedness of the unit\n&gt; &gt; tests. �The AbstractUnitTest could not be used without\n&gt; &gt; recompiling, a step to be avoided.\n&gt; &gt; Another method we&#39;ve thought of is to add a method\n&gt; &gt; &quot;getNavigator&quot; to the AbstractUnitTest which is called\n&gt; &gt; from the TestCase setUp() method. �This getNavigator\n&gt; &gt; method would only be implemented by subclassing the\n&gt; &gt; AbstractUnitTest class and would then return the\n&gt; &gt; specific type of AbstractNavigator to be tested (i.e.\n&gt; &gt; MDINavigator). �The problem with this solution is that\n&gt; &gt; the method of TestCase which returns the TestSuite is\n&gt; &gt; static and therefore cannot be overridden...where to\n&gt; &gt; go from here?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If anyone can give us any more information about this\n&gt; &gt; kind of abstract unit testing, we would greatly\n&gt; &gt; appreciate it.\n&gt; &gt; Thanks,\n&gt; &gt; CJ\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
