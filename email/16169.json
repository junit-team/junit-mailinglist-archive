But anti pattern sounds too <br/>\nstrong for my taste. <br/>\nAnyhow...<br/>\n<br/>\nNo unit tests: sounds like saying &quot;you sing wrong because you don&#39;t sing <br/>\nat all&quot;. If I don&#39;t test, I surley do something wrong, but I am not doing <br/>\nunit testing wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t like the section heading &quot;Refactoring&quot; because a refactoring is <br/>\nsomething different. Your &#39;refactorings&#39; actively change the code and its <br/>\nbehavior, while AFAIK a refactoring in terms of THE book doesn&#39;t do that. <br/>\nMaybe &#39;fixes&#39; or &#39;solutions&#39; would be better headings?<br/>\n<br/>\nMissing assertions may be ok, for example in a test that was written for a <br/>\nbug report where the code threw but shouldn&#39;t do so. This test can just <br/>\nhave a comment like // This line throws if bug 123 is not fixed.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also don&#39;t have problems with multiple assertions, if it&#39;s only two or <br/>\nthree. For example I may assert some object to be not null before <br/>\nasserting its properties.<br/>\n<br/>\nSuperficial coverage: this can happen for TDD beginners, and unless there <br/>\nis a requirement to check something not on the happy path, I wouldn&#39;t <br/>\nmake this a hard rule. For example, if I write tests that deal with <br/>\npeople&#39;s age (as an integer), I see no problem with not testing negative <br/>\nvalues, if the code is used in a context where this is other classes <br/>\nresponsibility.<br/>\n<br/>\nAn example for the &quot;only easy tests&quot; section would be helpful.<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree on the overly complex tests. However, you may not always be able <br/>\nto just refactor as you&#39;d like.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou could add time/date and randomness to the external dependencies.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\n<br/>\nRobert</div>",
