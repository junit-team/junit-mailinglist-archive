He took me to his  \nbasement and showed me a cute little DSP chip that he had programmed  \nin assembler to draw concentric circles on a TV screen.  The program  \nsimply manipulated a D/A converter to generate the video signal.  Cute.\n\nThen he said, &quot;Now, how would you do this using TDD?&quot;  He proceeded  \nto show me a java program, complete with tests, that simulated the  \ngeneration of the video signal, complete with the concentric  \ncircles.  The program he wrote was, in a way, a DSP simulator.  But  \nit was more than that.  In essence he created an array of objects  \nthat correlated roughly to DSP instructions.  Each of these objects  \nhad two derivatives.  One mimicked the behavior of the DSP  \ninstruction that it represented, and the other emitted corresponding  \nDSP assembly language to an output file.\n\nThe result was a very detailed DSP application, on a chip that did  \nnot support a high level language, written in Java using TDD.\n\nWhere there is a will, there is a way.\n\n----\nRobert C.
