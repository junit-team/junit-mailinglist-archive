They&#39;re drop-in replacements of each other. You&#39;re <br/>\nkind-of saying that &quot;select is broken&quot;, which is why I&#39;m just saying no.<br/>\nI&#39;m repeatedly saying &quot;learn to walk before you run&quot;, and I&#39;m not sure <br/>\nI&#39;m getting across clearly.<br/>\n<br/>\nI assume you&#39;re starting firefox and not IE ? Maybe you should try to <br/>\nrun 1 instance of DefaultSelenium in two different VM; in that way you <br/>\ncan assert that 1 node works properly and<br/>\njust add more nodes.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;ll honestly have to talk to the people on the selenium mailing list <br/>\nabout grid. I tried it once, and it worked concurrently but not at the <br/>\nlevel of stability<br/>\nwe required - which is high. That may have changed since then.<br/>\n<br/>\nKristian<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
