After \n&gt;searching thru documentation, this news group and other sources, some \n&gt;issues still remain that I hope some of you can help answer.\n&gt;\n&gt;    1. We have a need to put some trace messages in the tests so as \n&gt;to know the progress of the test itself because each test can be \n&gt;fairly timeconsuming. Is there a way to have these capture this \n&gt;output for an individual test in the GUI-based TestRunner? I see only \n&gt;thing that is captured for each test on the UI are the assertion \n&gt;failures. \n\nMy guess is that if TestListener doesn&#39;t have something to allow you to\nlog progress messages, then you can easily add something to it.\n\n&gt;    2. I see that JUnitReport is used quite extensively with Ant. \n&gt;&gt;From what I learnt reading, it helps output TestResult in XML format \n&gt;and then one can translate it using XSLT. Know how one can use that \n&gt;without having to use Ant? Any resources on Net would be helpful.\n\nHm. Your best bet is to look at the source of the JUnitReport task and\nyou should be able to tell, from that, how to use it outside Ant.\n\n&gt;   3. I see JUnit is great for nesting sub-suites within a suite and \n&gt;thereby creating a tree of suites. But when it comes to test results, \n&gt;is there a way to get a breakup of which sub-suite had how many \n&gt;failures from TestResult?\n\nIf you want to map a TestSuite object to the collection of\nFailures/Errors generated by its tests, then your best bet is likely to\nregister an extra TestListener, which you can do by changing the\nTestRunner you usually use.\n\nI&#39;ve never tried to do these things, so I can only give you a\nbest-guess at a starting-point.\n\nIf you get this stuff working, please write an article about it!\n\nJ.
