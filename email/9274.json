    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1093440917\">Hi,<br/>\n<br/>\nI have read about JUnit and TDD and the mailing list about using these in real world.  However I am still not convinced how <br/>\nwould one apply these in large systems.  In particular, in compilers and related topics.<br/>\n<br/>\nA concrete instance would be an analysis that works on say some IR. The analysis can usually be cast as a single class and the <br/>\ntest of the &quot;unit&quot; is that each of the methods function as specified in the given scenarios.  The analysis works on the <br/>\nintermediate representation (IR) of a program.  The IR is dependent on the input program/source code.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo test the analysis class you need to provide it an IR which means we need the whole machinery to setup the IR on which the <br/>\nanalysis works and then drive the analysis with the test object while probing it correctness.  Generally, the machinery to <br/>\nsetup the IR is complex or large.  So, would one code that up into the test case?  If so, at what cost?  A more simple <br/>\nquestion would be that how much effort should go into setting up the environment for object to be tested and test object <br/>\nitself?  Also, say if the analysis provides information say relation between 2 entities in the IR, then how do you test for <br/>\nthis relation while unit testing the analysis (may be this is into another form of testing but anyways...)?<br/>\n<br/>\nFor people who have read &quot;Unit Testing in Java&quot; the above is a case of Object Under Test scenario.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn simple words, if a chunk of logic embedded in a class requires large pieces of information to be setup, then how would one <br/>\nuse JUnit or any unit testing framework in such cases?  Even more, when instances of such classes go through state changes <br/>\ndepending on interaction with other objects how do you instrument the test and run the test?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe reason I am posting this question is that I have heard a lot about JUnit and how Unit Testing is the &quot;magic bullet&quot; (of <br/>\ncourse I have heard people say otherwise about the latter too).  However, I am not convinced as to if it is applicable in all <br/>\nsituations and scenarios.  Even more, are there documents or studies that indicate the impact of Unit Testing on projects say <br/>\nin terms of shift in timelines, # of bugs, and such?  I am trying to find evidence of usage of JUnit is situations similar to <br/>\nones explained above.<br/>\n<br/>\nwaiting for reply,<br/>\n<br/>\n- Venkatesh</div>",
