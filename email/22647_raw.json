One\n&gt; thing that would help is clear consensus on community opinion.  There\n&gt; are currently two different patches mentioned in that thread--would\n&gt; you be willing to make a case about which is the better solution?\n\nThankyou, this I can usefully do.\n\nAlistair Israel&#39;s patch is a straightforward propagation of the existing\nconcepts of MethodRules to class level.\n\nDaniel Brolund&#39;s patch picks the terminology of &quot;TestCaseRule&quot; for this\nfeature, which I find less appropriate than &quot;ClassRule&quot; given that tests\ncan be ordinary classes now rather than inheriting from\njunit.framework.TestCase. It also goes considerably further, extending\nthe concept of rules beyond classes, to suites, and adding the concept\nof propagating rules from suites to individual classes and methods.\n\nIn the parts where the two overlap, I believe Alistair Israel&#39;s to be\nslightly superior in the minor details:\n\n * Passes an org.junit.runners.model.TestClass to its class-level\n   rules, not just a java.lang.Class.\n\n * Validates that ClassRule fields must be static.\n\nIn other respects, it seems to me that Daniel Brolund&#39;s work is close to\nbeing a superset of Alistair Israel&#39;s.\n\nTherefore, I propose that what should happen is:\n\n * Review/merge Alistair Israel&#39;s work, and declare issue 29 fixed.\n\n * Invite Daniel Brolund to tweak his extended work to be based upon\n   the merged implementation (which should be an easy task, given how\n   close conceptually the overlap is), and to open a new issue and\n   discussion on this mailing list concerning it.\n\n\nThanks,\nMax.\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
