I&#39;m interested \nin feedback regarding what others think is adequate. I am not \ninterested in why the question itself is incorrect, I know that. If \nyou were shown a project plan, told that unit tests weren&#39;t worked \ninto the schedule, but that they should be, and asked what percentage \nof time should be added - what would you say. Keep in mind the \npositive - management wants unit tests included and is willing to \nconsider allotting time.\n\nSome background:\nInitial requirements are complete. This is a major new version of an \nexisting product - new requirements, but not entirely new domain. The \nplanning is iterative, with medium-length development cycles that \nlook like small waterfalls.\n\nAny thoughts?\n\n\n\n",
