Assume\n&gt; also that I can&#39;t replicate the servlet environment  so I&#39;m using Mock\n&gt; Objects ( http://mockobjects.sourceforge.net ) to keep the testing\n&gt; light. \n&gt; \n&gt; If my service() method looks like this:\n&gt; \n&gt; service() {\n&gt; \n&gt; doSomething()\n&gt; doAnotherThing()\n&gt; doSomethingElse()\n&gt; }\n&gt; \n&gt; each of which require the setting of a significantly different state (\n&gt; or MockObjects inside MockObjects, which I&#39;ve read breaks the\n&gt; fundamental philosophy of unit testing and mock objects )\n&gt; \n&gt; would it suffice to test doSomething(), doAnotherThing(),\n&gt; doSomethingElse() or would good practice dictate that I test service()\n&gt; since that&#39;s the method that will be involved in the integration of my\n&gt; code with the rest of the system?\n&gt; \n&gt; I guess my underlying questions are:\n&gt; \n&gt; What are some guidelines for a &quot;unit&quot; ?\n&gt; Is the assumption of tested units enough to warrant passing on the\n&gt; composite methods that call those units?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks for any help,\n&gt; \n&gt; Aadi\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
