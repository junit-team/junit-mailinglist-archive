Creativity is exercised in solving \n&gt; business problems - not in configuring the environment.  (Or, even in \n&gt; using the latest and greatest technology.)\n&gt;\n&gt;   \nIt seems to me that the latest and greatest technology being \nexperimented with here is Junit 4, not Java 5. To use Java 5 for running \nJunit it would not need to be &quot;installed&quot; by sysadmins anymore than you \nneed a sysadmin to install junit 4. You just need a JRE somewhere. It \ncould even be in source control (assuming that&#39;s allowed by the license).\n\n- Neil\n\n\n",
