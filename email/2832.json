This TestRunner could then be<br/>\n&gt; used in automation and during development with a minimum of setup.<br/>\n&gt;   ClassPathTestCollector does a great job of grabbing up the .class files on<br/>\n&gt; the class path, but it doesn&#39;t dip into the jars to grab those classes also.<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m about to write some code to add this functionality.  Has anyone already<br/>\n&gt; done this?  If so, could you share code, ideas, or suggestions?<br/>\n&gt;   Thanks.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Do you have a test case?
