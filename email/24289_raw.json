If we go with using an annotation, we would have an annotation\n&gt; provided with JUnit that you could use. Does that change your view?\n&gt;\n\nThat would indeed reduce the difference between the two aproaches. The\ndifference I still see is that the annotation is more general.  You can use\nit at other places in the API if needed.   This is good if you think it\nwould be usefull in multiple place in the API.  However, if it is supported\nin only one place, it might raise useless questions when\nimplementing/extending other interfaces.  The implementer might ask himself\nif he should write thread safe code with that annotation or if it doesn&#39;t\nmather for this interface.\n\nOther differences are that the annotation is less intrusive than the taging\ninterface that is a little bit old school.\n\nGiven that, I&#39;m now thinking that annotation is a good idea, but a bigger\nwork.  I think for the annotation you should review the documention of the\nentire API to document where it applies.\n\n\n&gt; Note also that it is usually a bad idea to call a &quot;Listener&quot; while holding\n&gt; &gt; a lock. So the ThreadSafe listener should be strongly recommended and the\n&gt; &gt; non thread safe version should be deprecated.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m not sure I agree (but I&#39;m very interested in others thoughts). JUnit is\n&gt; used by all types of users, from novice to advanced. It is often the first\n&gt; and only third-party library a novice user uses. Novice users are highly\n&gt; likely to not handle thread-safety issues. Thread-safety issues in a\n&gt; listener could lead to all sorts of confusing results. I think we need to\n&gt; make it easy for novice users to add listeners without worrying about\n&gt; thread-safety issues, and possible for advanced users to have thread-safe\n&gt; listeners.\n&gt;\n&gt;\nIs the RunListener for novice ;-)\nAnyway, even non novice might have issues to implement a thread safe\nclass.  So I understand your concern.  But anyway, here also, you will need\nto document very well the locking aproach.\n\nGilles\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
