H=\r\nowever, I&#39;m much more interested in experiences than in votes. If someone s=\r\naid, &quot;I went through my code and I could definitely use classes as categori=\r\nes because of X, Y and/or Z,&quot; would be compelling to me. Even more compelli=\r\nng is if someone would write the test cases for the new scheme.\n\nRegards,\n\n=\r\nKent\n\nOn Nov 19, 2009, at 7:33 AM, David Saff wrote:\n\n&gt; On Wed, Nov 18, 200=\r\n9 at 7:46 PM, yme0987654321 &lt;yme0987654321@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; The decisi=\r\non to use types to define categories is definitely surprising to see, so th=\r\nat has to count against it.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; However, after the initial shock wears =\r\noff, I definitely see the power in it, using Java inheritance and static ch=\r\necking rather than free form strings and some arbitrary hierarchy delimiter=\r\n in the string.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; However, I think the decision to use a specific new=\r\n interface as the super type is not a good idea. It would seem you gain the=\r\n same power by allowing any Class&lt;?&gt;. The advantage of doing this is it wou=\r\nld allow real classes within the project to act as Categories, so that if, =\r\nfor example, I am testing a DAO framework, I can categorize individual test=\r\ns with the specific DAO subclass they are targeting, and then run a categor=\r\ny based on the DAO supertype. Much nicer than just calling it all SlowTests=\r\n. In practice that won&#39;t happen often if a custom interface is required bec=\r\nause it will introduce a dependency on a JUnit type in the production code.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Huh. The first time through, I thought &quot;that&#39;s ridiculous&quot;. The\n&gt; sec=\r\nond time, I wondered if there&#39;s not something to this...\n&gt; \n&gt; Totally musin=\r\ng out loud, but you could rename the annotation as\n&gt; TestOf, so that you&#39;d =\r\nhave\n&gt; \n&gt; @TestOf(CustomStreamingPlatform.class)\n&gt; \n&gt; Hmm...\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m als=\r\no curious if you considered using an annotation as the category? That is ha=\r\nving the category take a Class&lt;?&gt; that represents an annotation? You could =\r\nsupport meta-annotations to allow a hierarchy of categories as well as supp=\r\norting any subclasses or implementations of types so annotated. Coding for =\r\nthat would be nasty business, but it wouldn&#39;t be complicated from a client =\r\npoint of view, and would allow the same flexibility of inheritance without =\r\nthe dependency on a JUnit type.\n&gt; \n&gt; I wanted to stay away from meta-annota=\r\ntions unless the reasons were\n&gt; _really_ compelling.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I would prefer =\r\njust an arbitrary Class&lt;?&gt;, though. Inheritance is well understood by any J=\r\nava programmer (unlike meta-annotations) and opens up a synergy between the=\r\n category hierarchy and the code hierarchy.\n&gt; \n&gt; Can I get another vote on =\r\nthis extension idea?\n&gt; \n&gt; David\n&gt; \n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message ha=\r\nve been removed]\n\n\n",
