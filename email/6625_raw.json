I was inherited to take over \n&gt; testing a client / server application.  The test cases were all \n&gt; written in xml (a bunch of xml defined messages that the client \nwould \n&gt; send to the server) where a java application would read in each \ntest \n&gt; case from the xml file.  It would then send the xml message to the \n&gt; server and the server would then process that xml messages and send \n&gt; them back another xml message.\n&gt; \n&gt;   I would like to integrate this into Junit&#39;s framework but the \n&gt; problem I am having is that each test case has 4 xml messages that \nit \n&gt; sends to the server.  I would like to use JUnits TestCase method \nand \n&gt; read each xml file one by one.  The problem with this is that it \n&gt; would be one method that would be reading each xml message in from \n&gt; the file and then verifying it.  \n&gt;    \n&gt;    After looking at JUnit&#39;s framework they treat each method as a \n&gt; test case within a class that extends TestCase.  My question is how \n&gt; would you design this so that I could treat each file as testcase 1 \n&gt; and each message that gets read in as testcase a, b, c, etc....  I \n&gt; would like to be able to use Junit&#39;s swing TestRunner to run all \n&gt; these xml file test cases then.  Any help would be greatly \n&gt; appreciated.\n&gt; \n&gt; ben\n\n\n",
