Put all your testing code into a method start with &#39;test&#39;, e.g.\npublic void testCompatibility() so that test runner can pick it up.\n\n3. change the code so that instead of adding an error to a vector,\ncall fail(&quot;your message here&quot;) instead.  I suggest you change the\nfirst one or three only so that you don&#39;t spend too much time and\nkeep focused.\n\n4. Now you might notice that the first fail will stop further testing.  So\nyou need to create another test method (a public method that\nreturns void and takes no arguments) and move some code into\nthat method.  The code you move should be the one that you stil\nwant to do regardless whether the first one fail or not.  Don&#39;t worry\nabout duplicate code for now.\n\n5. Now do another one in another method, which should be the code\nyou want to continue even if the first two tests fail.\n\n6. Now that you have a good idea of the duplicated code, move them\nto the setUp() method so that they will be called automatically.\n\n7. Continue the steps.  Take care of the setUp and tearDown so that\nyour tests won&#39;t be dependent on each other (they can certainly call\neach other, though).\n\nHopefully this will get you started, unless, of course, I totally\nmisunderstood your motivation.  :)\n\nAnd keep in mind that this is by no means a trival task.  So be\nprepared and don&#39;t lose your focus. :)  Do something like write down\nthe steps you are going to do.\n\nShane\n\n\nthe_shark_tank@... wrote:\n\n&gt; Shane,\n&gt;\n&gt; Well, I am writing a tool to test binary compatibility between\n&gt; versions.  Basically, I load each version up using my own class\n&gt; loader, and then compare them to eachother.  However, the way that I\n&gt; designed the program was that all the errors were stored, and then\n&gt; just printed out by the user however he wanted.  I wrote the code\n&gt; myself (both the toolkit code and the junit code).  I have tried\n&gt; making my (BC) code more test worthy, as suggested earlier in this\n&gt; forum, such as instead of printing the results, I have a getList\n&gt; method so I can compare the list to a hardcoded list, however, this\n&gt; does not seem to fit in with the mentality of unit test writing.  Is\n&gt; that a better picture of what I am trying to do?  I have a unit test\n&gt; running now, but I just feel that my design is very sloppy and\n&gt; amateurish.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks!\n\n\n",
