Should I set all the values in the test\n&gt; class? How do I model a workflow?\n&gt; I prefer not to user mock objects because I&#39;ve found it for my\n&gt; knowledge level confusing.\n\nIf you need this object graph in order to write your test, then create \nthe object graph. Sometimes creating big object graphs becomes difficult \nto maintain. Use Google to searh for &quot;ObjectMother&quot;, which is one \ntechnique for organizing code that creates objects used in test cases.\n-- \nJ. B.
