I wonder if not many \n&gt; people find this useful or if I&#39;m overstating how\n&gt; useful it can be.\n\nIn the past I tried to make this same distinction, but\nI found in practice that it was often arbitrary.\nOften, I&#39;ll change code that invalidates existing test\ncases so they start throwing assertions. The code\nisn&#39;t broken, the problem is that the test cases are\nout of sync with the code since the assumptions have\nchanged. To me, it doesn&#39;t really matter what&#39;s broken\n(testing code or tested code) or how I&#39;m notified of\nthe problem (assertion or error). The point is that I\nneed to investigate the problem and fix it.\n\nFor me, the path of least resistance is the most\neffective: make my test cases simple to write and\nsimple to understand. Thus, I prefer letting JUnit\nhandle uncaught exceptions as errors since this:\n\n  public void testFoo() throws Exception {\n    code;\n  }\n\nis simpler than:\n\n  public void testFoo() {\n    try {\n      code;\n    catch (ErrorException e) {\n      fail(...);\n    }\n  }\n\nBoth versions say the same thing to me: I expect\n&quot;code&quot; to work, and if it doesn&#39;t something is wrong.\nI just find the latter case less clear.\n\nMy two cents...\n\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nMake international calls for as low as $.04/minute with Yahoo!
