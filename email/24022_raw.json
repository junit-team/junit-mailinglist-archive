That&#39;s the difference between framewo=\r\nrks.\nAs I said before introducing @TypeSafe/FailSafe would hide ClassNotFou=\r\nndExc. Although it would be an issue to use category class in compile time =\r\nand omit the class in runtime.\n\nBR, Tibor\n\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, D=\r\nawid Weiss &lt;dawid.weiss@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Classes as categories was my idea=\r\n.  If I had it to do over again, I&#39;d\n&gt; &gt; choose strings.\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t think=\r\n classes are a bad idea, actually.\n&gt; \n&gt; I implemented the concept of &quot;group=\r\ns&quot; of tests for Apache Lucene and\n&gt; it is annotation-based. That is: there =\r\nis a meta-annotation @TestGroup\n&gt; that you can use to annotate your own ann=\r\notations which are then\n&gt; recognized as groups and either enabled or disabl=\r\ned together. So, for\n&gt; example, slow tests are annotated with this thing:\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; @Documented\n&gt; @Inherited\n&gt; @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)\n&gt; @TestG=\r\nroup(enabled =3D true, sysProperty =3D SYSPROP_SLOW)\n&gt; public @interface Sl=\r\now {}\n&gt; \n&gt; Lucene coders use multiple IDEs (and emacs, vi, etc...) and I th=\r\nink\n&gt; classes (or annotations in my case) work very well for this. One\n&gt; up=\r\nside is that you don&#39;t need special support for test groups, you can\n&gt; just=\r\n locate them using regular Java-element searches. Also, it&#39;s\n&gt; harder to ma=\r\nke a typo, you get support for completion, annotations\n&gt; define additional =\r\ngroup properties (such as system properties used to\n&gt; turn them on/off), et=\r\nc.\n&gt; \n&gt; Obviously there are drawbacks like the ones you mentioned -- you ne=\r\ned\n&gt; to reference those annotations during compilation, for example. But\n&gt; =\r\nall in all, I&#39;d say it&#39;s not a bad idea to use classes/ annotations\n&gt; for d=\r\nefining groups.\n&gt; \n&gt; Dawid\n&gt;\n\n\n",
