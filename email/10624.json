I don&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; know what my nick name was. But my first topic was a discussion <br/>\n&gt; about the value of JUnit compared to Design by Contract.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It was very controversial. At times I asked myself, if I was right <br/>\n&gt; when many gurus here were arguing against my opinion. I will not <br/>\n&gt; repeat the discussion.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; But I have seen that the DBC inventor himself seems to support my <br/>\n&gt; opinion recently: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.artima.com/intv/contestP.html\">http://www.artima.com/intv/contestP.html</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have only read the summary until now. Maybe you are interested in <br/>\n&gt; what he has to say in favor of Contract-Driven Development. I like <br/>\n&gt; the idea of Design by Contract. And I think that it could make <br/>\n&gt; traditional JUnit tests obsolete, since the test cases could <br/>\n&gt; automatically be generated from the Contracts. I think this is what <br/>\n&gt; Parasoft JTest already does.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Don&#39;t misunderstand me. I like JUnit. But I always look for better <br/>\n&gt; ways to solve my problems. So I hope you are as open as me to new <br/>\n&gt; solutions and ideas.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I will say only this: if by any reason you find that DBC suits your<br/>\npreferences/needs better than unit testing use it.  But in trying to<br/>\nconvince a TDD person of it I believe you would be wasting your time.  I<br/>\ndon&#39;t think, for instance, that DBC would have solved the recent issues<br/>\nwith the Mars rovers.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJason Rogers<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Where there is no vision, the people perish...&quot;<br/>\nBible, Proverbs 29:18</div>",
