There are numerous\nbut in my mind their effe=\r\nctiveness is in question.\n\nRecently I have been trying to create a sample o=\r\nf automated tests for\nour enterprise web application running on Oracle 9IAS=\r\n. The application\nis quite complex and uses Javascript extensively.\nMy purp=\r\nose is to create a test that mimics the steps in a `Change\nRequest&#39; or `Def=\r\nect&#39; . This would be created by the\ndeveloper and\nexecuted before and after=\r\n the bugfix/change. Therefore I needed a java\nbased framework with which to=\r\n create the test cases.\n\nSince these test case need to test a web applicati=\r\non, I researched and\nfinally focused on following three options. Note that =\r\nwhile there are\nbunch of tools/frameworks, I did not find any big winners.\n=\r\n\nJAKARTA CACTUS =96 While I have successfully created some tests with\nJakar=\r\nta Cactus Framework to create server side tests that have access\nto HttpSes=\r\nsion etc. objects., this does not allow us to mimic a\nuser&#39;s\nbrowser experi=\r\nence.\n\nHTTPUNIT/JWEBUNIT =96 After spending considerable time with this\nfra=\r\nmework, I feel it has ways to go before it can be used for complex\nWeb appl=\r\nication testing. One of the primary issue is limited support\nfor Javascript=\r\n. Even if I was to bypass that, I found that the time\ntaken to create an au=\r\ntomated test is too long.\n\nTESTMAKER =96 This is created and recommend by F=\r\nrank Cohen in his\nbook\nJava Testing and Design. My reservations with this t=\r\nool is that I did\nnot get the impression that is was used by enough develop=\r\ners/testers.\nIt is also promoted as record/playback tool and such tools may=\r\n work\nwell for simple scripts, they can cause maintenance issues for large\n=\r\ntesting harness.\n\nMy question is :\n\n1. Has anyone implemented automated tes=\r\nting harness for their\nenterprise web application that has brought signific=\r\nant value to QA of\ntheir software product/system?\n\n2. If so, then what was =\r\nthe tool/framework used ? And would you say\ncritical success factor is\na) y=\r\nour architecture/methodology of automated testing harness or\nb) the tool/fr=\r\namework\n\n3. Is this even feasible exercise? Can automated testing harness b=\r\ne\ncreated to enterprise web applications?\n\nThank you\n\n- Niraj\nSurya Infosys=\r\n Corp\n\n\n\n\n",
