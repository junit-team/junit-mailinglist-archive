This is an\n&gt;  &gt; important trait of any good test, and not just tests\n&gt;  &gt; that use a database.\n&gt; \n&gt; I preface this question with &quot;I know very little about\n&gt; EJB&#39;s&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Is it possible to implement the findAll logic in a\n&gt; POJO which is then easier to test?  Or is the code\n&gt; likely to be just a call to an EJB API?\n\nIt&#39;s certainly possible. Typically all one needs to do is pass in the \nDataSource or Connection to the POJO and off you go.\n\nI have found in general, though, that when someone asks a question like \nthis, it&#39;s more effective to nudge them in the right direction, rather \nthan tell them they&#39;re doing it all wrong. :) For that reason, I suggest \nsmall, useful improvements, rather than overhauling the approach.\n\nSometimes the person comes back and tells me that what they have is \nbetter, but they want something even better than that. At that point, I \ntalk about decoupling database client code from the database.\n-- \nJ. B.
