Hey, my conclusion could be the right one\nirrespective.\n      &gt;;-)\n\n      How is that different from what I wrote?\n\nYou said &quot;hypothesis is false therefore all conclusions are false&quot;, not\ntrue. Bertrand said &quot;hypothesis is false, so all conclusions are provable&quot;.\nThat doesn&#39;t make them all false, nor mine meaningless, just not certain.\nMine might&#39;ve been right however I started, perhaps plain luck. :-)\n\n&lt;snip/&gt;\n\n          Like hell. I&#39;ve proposed a solution to you a number of times.\n     Why don&#39;t       you  listen to it?\n\n\nI listened, I totally absorbed what you said, I just didn&#39;t buy it. Heck,\nwho knows ... maybe you weren&#39;t right.\n\nI write code, I test my code, I debug my code when tests fail by trying to\nanalyse the output. I was hoping for it to be easier to analyse, w/o a lot\nof manual effort, but I don&#39;t have an itch big enough to attempt to write\nsuch a tool -- especially when it&#39;d be cheap/clean to do it in the\nframework. Also, much as I could craft some sort of add on (perhaps leverage\nmy own sub-class from TestCase) I think it needs too much of what is in the\nframework in order to work well, and I don&#39;t fancy re-writing the thing.\n\nI use eclipse, I use ant -- I like the integration into those tools more\nthan I like my idea. If I can&#39;t get you to contemplate the concept, then I\nprobably have little chance of persuading them. If they don&#39;t use it, I\nwon&#39;t benefit. Another reason not to start.\n\nThis was my first topic on this mailing list, and much as you were pretty\nmeasured/polite (at least at the start) I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be back for more.\nOpen Source is (IMHO) about open minded discussion of ideas, and I don&#39;t\nthink I found that here. No worries, have fun w/ what you do.\n\nThanks for your time.\n\nregards,\n\nAdam\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
