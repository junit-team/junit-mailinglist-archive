I am glad we have an option to pay for a b=\r\netter license, especially one without the patent clause[1]. Now I fully und=\r\nerstand why our lawyers object against CPL and I am surprised that Sun lawy=\r\ners previously accepted that clause.\n\nBtw. I am trying to understand ways t=\r\no make open source projects profitable[2]. So far I thought only GPL with c=\r\nommercial licensing is an option, but the CPL trick is also cute.\n\nI have o=\r\nne question, however: I can imagine buying a commercial license is good for=\r\n closed source projects. But how can a commercial license be suitable for a=\r\nn open source project like NetBeans? If we want to stay open source, we can=\r\nnot have a commercial license on one of our libraries! We need to have an o=\r\npen source one. We need to let 3rd parties to take parts of our IDE and use=\r\n them in an open source manner. I am sure we are not the first ones to have=\r\n this problem, and you have some solution, right?\n\nThanks in advance for yo=\r\nur answer. Meanwhile we&#39;ll start shaping up description of our needs with o=\r\nur lawyers.\n-jt\n\n[1] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eclipse_Public_License#ci=\r\nte_note-patent_litigation_change-2\n[2] http://wiki.apidesign.org/wiki/WhyGP=\r\nL\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, Kent Beck &lt;kentb@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Jaro=\r\nslav,\n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you for the message.

Our new lawyers seem=\r\n to be concerned about the JUnit license. True, JUnit&#39;s use of Common Publi=\r\nc License is unique and sort of archaic.

Silly, I know, JUnit is necessary part of any serious Java development=\r\n, but there is not much we can do. Except to ask:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Don&#39;t you want t=\r\no relicense JUnit to some more commonly used license? EPL would be fine. At=\r\n least I have not heard any complain about EPL from our new lawyers yet. Du=\r\nal licensing to CPL & EPL probably too.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thanks for reading my post=\r\n and sorry for bothering.
