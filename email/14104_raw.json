I&#39;m not exactly sure what you mean by\n&quot;Monostate,&quot; but I understand your concern on the static methods. My\ndevelopers&#39; group is meeting on Wednesday and one of the topics is\ngoing to be allowing my project to use Spring. If that happens, I will\neliminate the AppProperties and have each component that needs\nproperties have a setter for the specific property.\n\nAlso, I ordered your book from Amazon about three weeks ago and I am\nanxiously awaiting its arrival (it is supposed to be delivered\n7/12-7/28). I have heard nothing but rave reviews.\n\nMichael.\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;J. B. Rainsberger&quot; &lt;jbrains@r...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Michael wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Hi, all. I have a testing scenario I need help with. The application I\n&gt; &gt; am working on has a class called AppProperties. This class has a lot\n&gt; &gt; of static methods on it for loading properties files and getting\n&gt; &gt; properties back out:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; public void loadProperties() {\n&gt; &gt;    //reads properties from classpath\n&gt; &gt;    AppProperties.addResource(&quot;app.properties&quot;);\n&gt; &gt;    AppProperties.addResource(&quot;MessageResources.properties&quot;);\n&gt; &gt; }\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; public void performTest() {\n&gt; &gt;    boolean test = AppProperties.getBoolean(&quot;app.perform.test&quot;);\n&gt; &gt;    if (test) {\n&gt; &gt;       ...\n&gt; &gt;    }\n&gt; &gt; }\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; This scenario is not very testable. I like the idea of a static class\n&gt; &gt; to pull application properties from, but it makes testing more\n&gt; &gt; difficult. I could load the AppProperties object in the setUp (that is\n&gt; &gt; my solution to get it working until I get better suggestions), but it\n&gt; &gt; seems like the app should be designed a little differently. How would\n&gt; &gt; something like this be handled in IoC (DI) projects?\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t much like the Monostate you have there. Even a true Singleton \n&gt; would be a little better than all those class-level method invocations.\n&gt; \n&gt; Injecting the dependency is simple: classes than need application \n&gt; properties add a constructor parameter or set() method that takes an \n&gt; AppProperties implementation. Now in tests, I can set up the data in \n&gt; AppProperties any way I want for the test. (In fact, I wouldn&#39;t do it \n&gt; that way, but that&#39;s another article.) In production code, I might have \n&gt; AppProperties be a Singleton and, in one place, invoke \n&gt; AppProperties.getInstance(), then inject that instance into all the \n&gt; objects that need it, either in code or through a DI container like\nSpring.\n&gt; \n&gt; For the &quot;advanced&quot; answer, I&#39;ll just have to write the article, but \n&gt; here&#39;s the summary: don&#39;t have classes depend on AppProperties, but \n&gt; rather on the data you want from it. Centralize getting the \n&gt; AppProperties data in one place.\n&gt; -- \n&gt; J. B.
