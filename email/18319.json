I&#39;d like to create a junit ant task that<br/>\n&gt; just runs on my whole codebase, but not all of my classes will have<br/>\n&gt; test methods and I&#39;ll get an error for each class that doesn&#39;t (and I<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t want to have to explictily add each class to my build.xml file<br/>\n&gt; when I add a test).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If I were to try to tackle this, I&#39;d be looking at how the ANT JUnit<br/>\nrunner is structured.<br/>\n<br/>\nVery approximately, it is like this:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;junit&gt;<br/>\n  &lt;test&gt;<br/>\n    &lt;fileset /&gt;<br/>\n  &lt;/test&gt;<br/>\n&lt;/junit&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe &lt;junit&gt; task runs all the tests handed to it by one or more &lt;test&gt;<br/>\nelements. The &lt;test&gt; elements get their input from one or more nested<br/>\n&lt;filesets&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo rather than having JUnit /not/ filter out the non-tests, I&#39;d have<br/>\nthat logic in either a custom subclass of &lt;test&gt; or a custom &lt;fileset&gt;<br/>\n- or maybe even a customer selector within the fileset.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven if you don&#39;t sprinkle tests throughout your fileset, it&#39;s kinda<br/>\nlame that you have to select tests by doing pattern matching on a<br/>\n.class or .java filename. It&#39;s also error-prone as I have found out<br/>\nway too many times.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have often wanted to do something similar myself but have never<br/>\ngotten around to it. Let us know how it goes.<br/>\n<br/>\nKevin</div>",
