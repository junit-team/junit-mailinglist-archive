Naveen Thank you so much for\n&gt; sending that junitsupport.jar file. Yes you are right\n&gt; just I replaced that junitsupport.jar file and it\n&gt; working fine now.\n\nThank you for thanking the people who helped you and thanks to those \nwho helped.\n\n&gt; If this is the case why the JUnit\n&gt; people still allowing to download the buggy\n&gt; junitsupport.jar file. I just downloaded that\n&gt; yesterday.\n\nThis comment is just not helpful if the only place you posted it is \nthis forum, as it is an Eclipse support issue.\n\nErik Meade\nhttp://junit.org\nemeade@...\n\n\n\n",
