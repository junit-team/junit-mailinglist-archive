Is there better way?\n\nI think your approach is quite correct. Of course the test won&#39;t compile\nuntil the Book class is written.\nFirst step is to write the test (which you have done).\nNext step is to compile the test -- the students need to realize they\nneed to write the beginning of the Book class with the appropriate\nconstructor and method signatures. \n\nNext step is to make the test pass by adding sufficient logic to the\nmethods.\n\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Hope you can help. \n\nI hope this did.  This is the approach I take in writing virtually all\nmy code now days. It works extremely well. \n\nFrank\n\n-- \nFrank Burough &lt;fburough@...&gt;\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n",
