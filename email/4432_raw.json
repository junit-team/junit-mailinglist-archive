I am actually using log4j, but I mentioned\nsystem.out.writeln as a simplification.\n\nThe real problem I had really is how to invoke the entire application/applet\ninside a test case. It is easy to write a testcase to invoke a particular\nmethod in a particular class. However I cannot simply call the init() in the\nJApplet implementation - I need to simulate the applet life-cycle. Of course\nI would have to simulate the keystrokes and mouse - I am investigating Jemmy\nfor this purpose.\n\nThe situation is not as complicated with applications, since I should be\nable to simply call the main() with the appropriate arguments.\n\nRegards,\nStephen\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Vincent Massol [mailto:vmassol@...]\nSent: 21 March 2002 12:19\nTo: stephen.cheng@...\nSubject: RE: [junit] Testing Complete Applications and Applets\n\n\nStephen,\n\nAre you the Stephen Cheng I met at Icom ?\n\nThere are several solutions to your question.\n\n1/ First it is not good to do System.out.println ! You should rather use\na logging toolkit. I would suggest Jakarta Commons Logging as it\ntransparently let you use log4j, jdk1.4, logkit or simple logging using\nsystem.out, I think. If you do this, then you can provide a mock\nimplementation of the logger and assert whatever you want.\n\n2/ Simply redirect the out stream to a memory stream and then compare\nthe memory stream with the expected result.\n\nHope it helps.\n-Vincent\n\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Stephen Cheng [mailto:stephen.cheng@...]\n&gt; Sent: 21 March 2002 12:18\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: [junit] Testing Complete Applications and Applets\n&gt;\n&gt; In additional to performing unit testing, I need to test entire\n&gt; applications\n&gt; with main() and applets with init(). [Background info: I am working on\na\n&gt; java software development tool] I need to compare the text output\n&gt; (system.out.writeln) of the complete application/applet against\nexpected\n&gt; output. Is there someway I could do this?\n&gt;\n&gt; It appeared to me that I somehow need to simulate the enviroment that\na\n&gt; complete application/applet runs in. I would love to hear any\nsuggestions.\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards, Stephen\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
