That said the implementation, in J/=\r\nNUnit\nlags the concept a bit and J/N-users don&#39;t generally seem to grok it =\r\n(yet).\n\nThe general idea is that a Theory makes a statement that is true fo=\r\nr all\nvalues meeting a set of criteria. It invites the framework to supply =\r\nany\nvalues that meet those criteria - without any special intervention on t=\r\nhe\npart of the user. The individual test cases are not relevant except in t=\r\nhe\ncase of a failure, since the user should be viewing the Theory as a sing=\r\nle\ntest. Of course, the syntactic similarity to data-driven tests tends to =\r\nhide\nthe fact that this is a completely different way of looking at a test.=\r\n\n\nIME, Theories work best when I start out with a theory in mind. Standard\n=\r\ntests work best when I only have a collection of examples.\n\nThe J/NUnit imp=\r\nlementation, where the &#39;givens&#39; are provided within the\ntests themselves th=\r\nrough Assume.That, is not necessarily the only way\nto do it. We could const=\r\nruct some sort of DSL that instructed the framework\nabout what our assumpti=\r\nons are and allowed the data to be generated. In\n.NET that&#39;s quite difficul=\r\nt because of the limitations of attribute syntax\nand\nI suspect it&#39;s also tr=\r\nue for Java.\n\nCharlie\n\nOn Tue, Jun 28, 2011 at 4:08 PM, Bill Venners &lt;bill@=\r\nartima.com&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; **\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi All,\n&gt;\n&gt; This is all very interesting. On=\r\ne difference I see from ScalaTest is\n&gt; that a &quot;theory&quot; is not treated as a =\r\nspecial kind of test. J/NUnit\n&gt; &quot;theories&quot; map to ScalaTest &quot;properties.&quot; J=\r\n/NUnit &quot;assumptions&quot; (when\n&gt; used with theories) map to ScalaTest &quot;conditio=\r\nns.&quot; And J/NUnit &quot;data\n&gt; points&quot; map to a ScalaTest &quot;table.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; So for thi=\r\ns example from the JUNit 4.4 release notes:\n&gt;\n&gt; @RunWith(Theories.class)\n&gt; =\r\npublic class UserTest {\n&gt; @DataPoint public static String GOOD_USERNAME =3D=\r\n &quot;optimus&quot;;\n&gt; @DataPoint public static String USERNAME_WITH_SLASH =3D &quot;opti=\r\nmus/prime&quot;;\n&gt;\n&gt; @Theory public void filenameIncludesUsername(String usernam=\r\ne) {\n&gt; assumeThat(username, not(containsString(&quot;/&quot;)));\n&gt; assertThat(new Use=\r\nr(username).configFileName(), containsString(username));\n&gt; }\n&gt; }\n&gt;\n&gt; You mi=\r\nght do this in ScalaTest:\n&gt;\n&gt; public class UserSuite extends FunSuite {\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n test(&quot;filename includes username&quot;) {\n&gt;\n&gt; val examples =3D\n&gt; Table(\n&gt; &quot;user=\r\nname&quot;,\n&gt; &quot;optimus&quot;,\n&gt; &quot;optimus/prime&quot;\n&gt; )\n&gt;\n&gt; forAll (examples) { username =\r\n=3D&gt;\n&gt; whenever(!username.contains(&quot;/&quot;)) {\n&gt; (new User(username).configFile=\r\nName) should include (username)\n&gt; }\n&gt; }\n&gt; }\n&gt; }\n&gt;\n&gt; A false &quot;whenever&quot; expr=\r\nession is a failed &quot;condition,&quot; that causes a\n&gt; &quot;property evaluation&quot; to be=\r\n &quot;discarded.&quot; But the test encompasses all\n&gt; property evaluations. Here the=\r\nre&#39;s just two property evaluations, one\n&gt; of which gets discarded, but usua=\r\nlly there would be a table of many\n&gt; example usernames, otherwise it isn&#39;t =\r\nworth using a table.\n&gt;\n&gt; So what&#39;s missing from ScalaTest at this point is =\r\nsome way to do\n&gt; something like this, also taken from the JUnit 4.4 release=\r\n notes:\n&gt;\n&gt; @Test public void filenameIncludesUsername() {\n&gt; assumeThat(Fil=\r\ne.separatorChar, is(&#39;/&#39;));\n&gt; assertThat(new User(&quot;optimus&quot;).configFileName(=\r\n),\n&gt; is(&quot;configfiles/optimus.cfg&quot;));\n&gt; }\n&gt;\n&gt; That&#39;s actually a use of an as=\r\nsumption disconnected with a theory, and\n&gt; it seems useful. I haven&#39;t put a=\r\nnything like that into ScalaTest\n&gt; because no one has asked for it, and I w=\r\nanted to make sure that if I\n&gt; put something in it is based on real require=\r\nments. It seems to me that\n&gt; TestNG&#39;s dependencies are a similar concept, e=\r\nxcept instead of an\n&gt; assumption expression (like File.separatorChar is (&#39;/=\r\n&#39;) here) deciding\n&gt; whether a test is &quot;skipped&quot;, it is the failure of a dep=\r\nendent test.\n&gt;\n&gt; So one thing I&#39;d like to hear about from JUnit, NUnit, and=\r\n TestNG\n&gt; users are use cases. How have theoryless assumptions actually bee=\r\nn\n&gt; used in practice? What are they good for in reality?\n&gt;\n&gt; The other thin=\r\ng is the naming. To Esko I&#39;d say that I think &quot;skipped&quot;\n&gt; sounds to me most=\r\n like the generic term that would encompass all of\n&gt; these concepts, so may=\r\nbe that would not be a good term for me to use\n&gt; in ScalaTest if I end up a=\r\ndding this feature. I hadn&#39;t thought of\n&gt; &quot;canceled&quot; until Charlie mentione=\r\nd it, but that sounds like a clear\n&gt; way to describe a test that for this r=\r\nun is being skipped because of\n&gt; some unmet &quot;assumption.&quot; Another word you =\r\ncould consider for your\n&gt; runner, Esko, is &quot;discarded,&quot; which is what I use=\r\n for properties\n&gt; thrown out during a property check in ScalaTest.\n&gt;\n&gt; In c=\r\nase you&#39;re curious, the details on table-driven property checks in\n&gt; ScalaT=\r\nest is here:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www.scalatest.org/scaladoc-1.6.1/#org.scalatest.p=\r\nrop.TableDrivenPropertyChecks\n&gt;\n&gt; Bill\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; On Tue, Jun 28, 2011 at 11:58 =\r\nAM, Charlie Poole &lt;charliepoole@...&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi Davi=\r\nd,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The devil is of course in the details... see inline...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; O=\r\nn Tue, Jun 28, 2011 at 10:37 AM, David Saff &lt;david@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Just to make it clear, the statuses translate as:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; 1) Passed: We know it works\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yes\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 2) Failed: We k=\r\nnow it doesn&#39;t work.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yes, but we don&#39;t know why without further inf=\r\no.
