I have to=\r\n thank you,\n&gt;David, for putting this example in &gt;      the spotlight.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; =\r\n     The second test may be better if it depends on the data from the\n&gt;clas=\r\nspath\n&gt;walker, rather than a mock\n&gt;&gt;      classpath walker. Presumably the =\r\nmock classpath walker will be\n&gt;implemented to hardcode specified\n&gt;&gt;      cl=\r\nasspath walking data, anyway. I propose to extract the classpath\n&gt;walking\n&gt;=\r\ndata, then, and pass it to\n&gt;&gt;      the second object, rather than mocking a=\r\n classpath walker.\n&gt;\n&gt;J.B. I really have to thank you for not using this as=\r\n an opportunity to\n&gt;distract. Right after I sent this I feared I&#39;d be told =\r\n&quot;integration not\n&gt;unit&quot; and have the whole thread thrown out (or get side t=\r\nracked) for that\n&gt;one thought. That would be a shame on one example.\n\nDo yo=\r\nu realize that by writing the foregoing you have insulted me?\n\n&quot;I have to t=\r\nhank you for not being an idiot, because I expected you to be.&quot;\n\nIf you fel=\r\nt this way and truly couldn&#39;t control your impulse to express it, you could=\r\n at least have had the courtesy to do so in private.\n\n&gt;That all said, I hal=\r\nf wonder if you are being tongue in check or\n&gt;something -- seriously -- bec=\r\nause if you aren&#39;t joking, you said &quot;this test\n&gt;is best if it depends upon =\r\nthat test&quot;.\n\nIf you interpreted it that way, then I miscommunicated. I clar=\r\nified in another e-mail. Read that, since I think it more clearly indicates=\r\n the degree of isolation I am suggesting you strive for.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;Further, you s=\r\naid use a side effect\n&gt;(saved result) of one test for the next. [If you are=\r\n saying store it in a\n&gt;file, check that file in and test against it, then a=\r\nren&#39;t we risking that\n&gt;the output changes and the test isn&#39;t truly valid?] =\r\nThis all confuses me,\n&gt;since it seems to go against so much of what you sai=\r\nd.\n\nNot what I meant. I realized that after the first reply.\n\n&gt;Being more p=\r\nractical than purist I just need to know that my code works, I\n&gt;don&#39;t care =\r\ntoo much what is an internal-to-my-code-integration test, or\n&gt;not.\n&gt;As such=\r\n, I concur with what you are saying -- but I&#39;d have my second test\n&gt;use the=\r\n class in the first, not us stored results or mock objects. I need\n&gt;to\n&gt;kno=\r\nw that the solution I provide works as a unit (irrespective of user\n&gt;input/=\r\nothers) that is my goal for using junit. If not we could never junit\n&gt;anyth=\r\ning above the JDK &#39;cos we&#39;d be doing &quot;integration&quot; test.\n\nAgree with the la=\r\nst part. When we say &quot;integration test&quot;, we generally speak within the cont=\r\next of integrating with other application classes, and not the underlying p=\r\nlatform.\n\n&gt;So, do we have a valuable concept of a dependency? If this is th=\r\ne best way\n&gt;for me, the user, is to test my code -- ought I be able to want=\r\n it to stop\n&gt;if the walker failed?\n\nMy other e-mail ought to make it clear =\r\nthat no dependency is required. Read it and we&#39;ll pick this up after that.\n=\r\n\n\nJ. B.
