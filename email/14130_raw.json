I agree with Jamie Andrews&#39; observation. appendTo()\n&gt; in an implementation detail. It needs to be public because it is used\n&gt; polymorphically. It should not be part of the API. One fix is to create a\n&gt; separate interface just for that one method. Another is to add a warning to\n&gt; the javadoc.\n&gt; \n\nI&#39;m not sure I understand the actual bug here. (Does anyone have a URL \nfor the actual description of the bug, not just the newsgroup?) but the \nfix smells pretty bad to me. Most Java code exposes far more methods as \npublic than it should. If indeed this method should not be part of the \nAPI, then it should not be public. Documenting that it shouldn&#39;t be used \nis an inadequate response.\n\nOften overuse of public reflects a failure to use package protected \nmethods, often because the application has been divided into packages \nand yet the subpackages need to be able to access the internal parts of \nthe superpackages. Possibly Java 6 will fix this at a language level. \nUntil this is fixed most applications and libraries should use a single \npackage, even if that package ends up containing a rather large number \nof classes.\n\nAnother common problem is the tendency of many programmers and tools to \nmake methods public by default. Conservative design dictates that \nmethods should start their lives with the most restrictive access \npossible. If a need is discovered to make a private method public, \nthat&#39;s easy to change. The reverse operation can be impossible though.\n\n-- \nElliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nXML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim\n\n",
