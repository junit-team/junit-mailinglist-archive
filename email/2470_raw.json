I ensure that the old code is not \n&gt;broken and at the same time I test the new modifications also.\n&gt;Kindly correct if I am wrong.\n\nNo, sorry, you are right. I should have started brain before writing. &lt;g&gt;\n\n&gt;Even JUnit is described as a Regession Testing framework and I had \n&gt;some posts earlier in this group which confirmed that.\n\nBoth are regression tests, but JUnis is a unit test (white box), while your\ndescription indicates functional tests (black box). I know tools like\nMercury LoadRunner quite good enough to know their value, but they have a\ndifferent approach. Each testing method has its own place, JUnit is used by\nprogrammers ensuring that they implement the necessary &quot;software contract&quot;\nand ensures that this contract is not suddenly broken, while recording the\noutput of an application and comparing different runs is a much higher\ntesting level.\n\nGreetings,\nJorg\n\n",
