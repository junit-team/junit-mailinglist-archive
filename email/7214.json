I&#39;ve found <br/>\nthat Mockobjects have an implementation of the classes in javax.naming and <br/>\njavax.naming.directory. Is there anybody in the list with experiece using <br/>\nthem? Is it a good way to test a class that access an LDAP?<br/>\n<br/>\nBesides mockobjects, is there any solution similar to dbUnit but for LDAP?<br/>\n<br/>\nI would appreciate any advice.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n\tJorge</div>",
