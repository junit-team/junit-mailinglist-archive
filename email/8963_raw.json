This is the second time that you have\ndistorted what we have written.\n\nJ.B. you&#39;ve said this to me more than once. Hopefully it is clear that I am\ntrying, but there is a lot to read & mistakes will be made. I feel you&#39;ve\ndistorted what I&#39;ve said a number of times, I think it is an unfortunate\naspect of communication, on both our parts. Hopefully with us both trying we\nare getting past that.\n\n&gt;\tYour idea is not unwelcome. I have stated -- a few times -- that what you\npropose (the ability to\n&gt;\tmanage dependencies of the sort you describe) is a good idea and would\nlikely be welcome to others. All &gt;\tI have said is that I do not believe it\nbelongs at the core of JUnit.\n\nYou never communicated that to me. Your e-mails made me think otherwise.\nComments like:\n\n\t&quot;Get this straight: TEST CASE DEPENDENCY IS EVIL.&quot;\n\n... kinda made me think otherwise.\n\n&gt;\tAs for hoping that the JUnit team will assist you, I guess you don&#39;t know\nthe JUnit team very well. Kent &gt;\tand Erich are nice folks, but they are not\nactive contributors to JUnit these days. Just look at the gulfs &gt;\tin time\nbetween releases to convince yourself. Kent and Erich are not going to jump\non board and help\n&gt;\tyou with this. They don&#39;t have the time or energy. The real activity is in\nadd-on projects like\n&gt;\tJUnit-addons.\n\nDon&#39;t know them? Never heard of them, sorry and all. That is no insult, and\nno measure of my gratitude for what they&#39;ve produced and how I and the\ncommunity have benefited from their work. I also happen to have always been\nimpressed w/ the internals/design concepts in junit. That all said, none of\nthis is relevant .... I wasn&#39;t talking to them, I was talking to this list.\n\nOSS is (IMHO) a facet of the current community. I don&#39;t want help, I wanted\nto share/discuss a thought. If at the end of the day I write some code, then\ngreat, but I feel the idea needs better pressure testing & don&#39;t wish to\nrush to code.\n\n&gt;\t&lt;snip/&gt;\n&gt;\tA good solution to your problem is the second: a custom test runner with a\ndependency graph collector/analyzer.\n\nOk, so have we moved off &quot;I can do it with suites&quot;. I agree, a runner is\nalso needed. I also think I need a way (on the TestCase) to express\ndependency. But, if I write collector plus runner and add to testcase, how\nmuch of the framework have I replicated? How much benefited in my\nenvironment of ant and eclipse? Not much. I also don&#39;t want to take the ant\nroute and do an effective re-write.\n\n&gt;\tExcuse me: did you expect that we would suspend our lives and help you\nwrite what you need?\n\nActually, yes. Why not? Folks hack into junit out of love for it, out of a\ndesire to improve it. If something is a good idea, why not?\n\n\t&gt; That&#39;s not how open source works.\n\nActually, I feel it is. Convince the development team it is a good idea, and\nimportant, and they (closer to the implementation) are more than likely to\ndo the work, and should &#39;cos they know the bigger picture. Well, that is how\nI feel if folks come to me for something.\n\n\t&gt; I didn&#39;t see you handing out invitations; but rather asking, &quot;Why don&#39;t\nyou\n\t&gt;\tpeople add this to JUnit?&quot; That we don&#39;t need, thanks.\n\nYour interpretation, not mine. I said -- is it a good thing for junit, I\nnever said I&#39;d not try to help write it.\n\n\n\t&gt;Yes, I know, I&#39;ve written for both. I&#39;m hardly going to try to replicate\n\t&gt; all the work for both plugins just to try to get this point over.\n\n&gt;\tThen I guess you don&#39;t need it that badly.\n\nCorrect, but is that a measure of the idea, or the hurdle put in it&#39;s way?\n\n&gt;\tYou conclude that the community of developers is not open to accepting a\ncore change.\n&gt; \tThe alternate conclusion is that the community of developers does not\nbelieve your particular proposed\n&gt;\tchange is a good idea.\n&gt;\tOn what basis did you choose your conclusion over the alternative?\n\nFrom the fact that I only heard your voice, and (perhaps incorrectly, it was\nmy first posting) I felt that maybe you spoke for the community. Nobody else\nwas doing so back then. For all I knew you could&#39;ve been &quot;the original\nauthor&quot;. Whatever, the ideas presented on the mailing list give newbies like\nme feeling for the community. A community is what it posts...\n\n&gt;\tWhen you are ready to accept the possibility that we merely disagree with\nyou, rather than are\n&gt;\tnefariously blocking your proposal, please come back and discuss this with\nus again.\n\nNice try, but wrong. I am often wrong, numerous times -- and more than I am\nright. Honestly, I love it when somebody proves me wrong on something, I\nfeel I&#39;ve learned something. But, I can&#39;t quit a discussion because it\nbecomes an argument, I couldn&#39;t let this idea die because of distractions.\nIt didn&#39;t get a fair hearing (back then) and I&#39;m glad the rest of the list\nhas stepped in and opened things up. I was ready to quit, but now am\nlearning more & benefiting from the comments.\n\nregards\n\nAdam\n\n\n",
