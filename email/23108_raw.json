He&#39;s saying\nthat you should never test private methods=\r\n directly, only indirectly through\npublic methods.\n\nI find this angle puzzl=\r\ning, since as I said above, if you follow this\nreasoning, since all your co=\r\nde is already being tested indirectly by\nfunctional testing, why do unit te=\r\nsting at all?\n\nThe main reason why I sometimes want to test private methods=\r\n is not fear, as\nLasse claims, but simply the fact that this functionality =\r\ncan break.\nTherefore, it deserves a test of its own.\n\nThere are two extreme=\r\n ways to test private methods, both bad:\n\n   - Use reflection + setAccessib=\r\nle. Very fragile, avoid.\n   - Use public methods that call this private met=\r\nhod. Not good enough.\n\nI tend to favor the middle ground approach, which is=\r\n to relax the scope of\nthe method so that tests can see it. Making it packa=\r\nge protected and putting\na comment (&quot;/* for testing */&quot;) usually works, but=\r\n if it doesn&#39;t, I don&#39;t\nhave a problem with making this method public for t=\r\nesting.\n\n-- \nC=E9dric\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been remove=\r\nd]\n\n\n",
