For the tests we used Thread.yield()\nbefore asserting to wait till these tasks are done. This works fine when it\nruns in the ide but not when we run the test via the ant junit task. Via ant\nthe currentthread don&#39;t yield long enough and the testing starts before the\ntasks are done .\nAfter some try and error we found that the thread only waits long enough if\nwe put in three times Thread.yield().\nBut it&#39;s not a very elegant solution.\nIs there an other solution to solve this ?\n\nBart\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n\n",
