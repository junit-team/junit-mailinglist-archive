These \n&gt; &gt;messages are truncated after about 80 characers with the last part of the \n&gt; &gt;message replaced by &quot;...&quot;.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Is it possible to change the configuration of JUnit to allow long messages \n&gt; &gt;of about 200 charactes?\n&gt; \n&gt; In the more recent versions of JUnit (&gt;3.2?) you can put maxmessage=-1 in a \n&gt; file called junit.properties in the user.home directory which will allow \n&gt; unlimited messages (or maxmessage=200 will do exactly what you asked for).\n&gt; \n\nThat&#39;s not enough to stop truncation in the Swing runner.  (You can see \nthe truncation behavior by changing the width of the JUnit window.  You \nwon&#39;t see a horizontal scroll bar in the list of failures until, on \nSolaris under CDE, anyway, the width of the window is less than 400.)  \nWhen the JList is created in junit.swingui.FailureRunView&#39;s \nconstructor, setPrototypeCellValue is called.  This has the effect of \nsetting the preferred height and width of every element of the list to \nthe same value (width=297 in my environment).  Values wider than that \nget truncated.\n\nCommenting out that call to setPrototypeCellValue in \njava.swingui.FailureRunView.FailureRunView(TestRunContext) fixes this \nproblem.  Can someone offer an argument why it should be retained?  \n(Does it do something else useful?)\n\n\n\n",
