I will start not by talking about Agitator, but\nabout a more=\r\n general issue: is there a problem with unit testing that\nneeds solving?\n\nY=\r\nou write:\n\n&gt; The bottom line is that this is a very interesting product tha=\r\nt  \n&gt; appears to me to be looking for a problem to solve. \n\nI believe that =\r\nthere&#39;s a HUGE and GROWING problem to solve.  My\nco-founder (Dr. Roongko Do=\r\nong, another person who is as passionate\nabout advancing the state-of-the-a=\r\nrt in test automation for 15+\nyears), started Agitar not because we were lo=\r\noking for something to\ndo, or make a quick buck (quite the contrary, in 200=\r\n2 when we started\nAgitar I was Senior Director of Software Engineering at G=\r\noogle - if\nall I cared about was money I would have stayed put :-)).  We st=\r\narted\nAgitar to solve what I believe is one of the biggest problems in\nsoft=\r\nware development, and one that we are very passionate about:\ngetting develo=\r\npers to think about and do testing DURING development -\nso they can address=\r\n defects and design problems with maximum\nefficiency and minimum impact.  A=\r\ns opposed to the more traditional \n&quot;throw the code over the wall to QA&quot; mod=\r\nel.\n\nMy experience at Google, where with others I championed the\nintroducti=\r\non of JUnit and the idea of developer testing was very\nrevealing.  Admitted=\r\nly, Google is a way off the chart in terms of\nprogramming talent, but in th=\r\ne last 4 years I confirmed the very same\nfindings with 100s of other people=\r\n and software organizations that\nalso introduced, or tried to introduce, de=\r\nveloper/unit testing:\n\nHere are some of the key things I discovered:\n\n1) On=\r\n average, approximately only 30% of developers who are introduced\nto xUnit/=\r\ndeveloper-testing/TDD become test-infected (i.e. the will\ncontinue to do un=\r\nit testing even if they are not asked to).  The other\n70% will go back to t=\r\nheir &quot;old-ways&quot;.  Why is that?  My next points\nsheds some light.\n\n2) Most d=\r\neveloper complained that in order to get decent coverage (say\n80-90%) they =\r\nhave to write 3-4 lines of JUnit code for every line of\nJava.  They wanted =\r\nsome way to automate the most mundane parts of the\ntesting effort and retai=\r\nn control of the areas that require human\nintelligence, insight, domain-kno=\r\nwledge, and creativity.\n\n3) Most of the unit tests that actually get writte=\r\nn cover only the\nnormal/&quot;happy&quot; path.  They assume the best of all possible=\r\n world; that\nthey would never be passed bad parameters, that all strings wo=\r\nuld be\nnice ASCII code and never exceed some magic length, that all objects=\r\n\nwill be well formed and in the state they were expecting, etc. \nNeedless t=\r\no say, this is not sufficient for most industrial\napplications, especially =\r\nif they have to survive in hostile\nenvironments where hackers look for ever=\r\ny possible deficiency in the\nsystem, or when your colleagues assume that yo=\r\nu are going to handle\nthose null pointers so he does not have to worry abou=\r\nt them. On the\nother hand, if you want to cover all those contingencies tes=\r\nting\nbecomes a combinatorial problem and it&#39;s hard for developers to\nconcei=\r\nve of and test for everything that should be tested for.\n\n4) If testing a p=\r\narticular piece of code was too complicated (lots of\ndependencies, complica=\r\nted set-up, lots of things to mock, etc.) the\ntests were skipped.  This is =\r\nhuman nature. Ideally people would look\nat code that&#39;s difficult to test an=\r\nd think re-factoring and (re)design\nfor testability but most people are not=\r\n there yet.\n\n5) Test maintenance was as time consuming as code maintenance.=\r\n  If\nthere&#39;s anything that most developers disliked more than writing lots\n=\r\nof test code by hand, was maintaining that code.  One of the most\ncommon un=\r\nit test maintenance patterns is: delete or comment-out\nfailing tests.\n\nSo, =\r\nfor someone who believes that developer/unit testing is the right\nthing to =\r\ndo - one of the MOST important things to do and do WELL - I\nsaw a VERY big =\r\nand VERY definite problem.  Namely: Most developers\nwant and need help with=\r\n their testing effort.  Without some help and\nautomation they will either g=\r\nive up on developer/unit testing or, even\nworse because it gives a false se=\r\nnse of security, write some trivial\n&quot;happy-path&quot; tests that pass too easily=\r\n and fail to cover some\ncritical conditions.  Note that I am not in favor o=\r\nf complete\nautomation (press a button get some passing tests) unless you ne=\r\ned\nsome quick change detector. I want Agitator to do for software\ndeveloper=\r\ns what spreadsheets have done for accountants and business\npeople: raise th=\r\ne level of abstraction, allow the user to focus on the\nimportant things tha=\r\nt require their intelligence and understanding\n(e.g. formulae in spreadshee=\r\nts, test data/assertions in Agitator),\nprovide a number of other related ut=\r\nilities (e.g. graphs in\nspreadsheets, code coverage and code rules and dash=\r\nboard reports in\nAgitator).\n\nWe could argue whether Agitator helps with som=\r\ne of the problems (I\nbelieve it does since it was designed to address them =\r\nspecifically),\nbut I don&#39;t think we can argue that there is no problem to b=\r\ne solved\nwhen it comes to developer testing.  Until most developers and\nsof=\r\ntware development organizations practice thorough unit testing on a\nconsist=\r\nent basis, we have a problem.\n\nWithout JUnit we would not be where we are t=\r\noday.  A 30% test\ninfection rate is a huge step from what it was before (i.=\r\ne. ~0%).  But\nI refuse believe that we cannot augment and provide developer=\r\ns with\nother tools beyond JUnit, and that we are stuck at 30% test infected=\r\n.\n\nThere&#39;s work we all have left to do.\n\nPeople like you are helping our co=\r\nmmon cause doing what you do best\nand, presumably, like to do best: trainin=\r\ng, coaching, mentoring,\neducating, writing, etc.\n\nMe?  I am a software tool=\r\n maker.  That&#39;s what I do best, and that&#39;s\nwhat I like to do. That&#39;s the be=\r\nst way I can help the cause.  I\nbelieve that tools are critical to progress=\r\n, and that the right tools\nwill enable the right behavior.  Anyone who know=\r\ns me, or has talked\nwith me for just a few minutes, knows how passionate I =\r\nam about\nsolving this problem (if we agree that there is a problem :-)) and=\r\n I\nalso would like to think that in addition to my passion, I bring some\nun=\r\nique experience, skills, and vision to the table.\n\nBoy, this was a long pos=\r\nt.  I apologize.  I will take a break - do\nsome real work - and address som=\r\ne your other more specific comments a\nlittle later.\n\nAlberto\n\n\n\n\n\n",
