Rainsberger [mailto:jbr@d...]<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ...<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So the only thing you gain with the suggestion above is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; forcing the code to be aware of the Exception possibility of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; your code.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes: I submit that that is what tests are for. (If you&#39;re <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; here, then you&#39;re writing tests, after all.)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Isn&#39;t documentation the thing that should be used to tell the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; writer of code that calls yours what your code is supposed to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; do, or what the caller is supposed to do (or not do)?  (At<br/>\n&gt; &gt; least for code meant to be re-used, such as that implementing<br/>\n&gt; &gt; an API?)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Yes, it is. Please explain to me why unit tests are not <br/>\n&gt; documentation. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>i think with respect to checked exceptions your code has advertised,<br/>\nunit tests are not documentation about how to react to such<br/>\nexceptions.  if i&#39;ve understood the preceding discussion correctly,<br/>\nit is preferred in unit tests to let unexpected (read: not the<br/>\nsuccessful outcome of the test) exceptions, checked or unchecked,<br/>\npropagate out of the test method so the JUnit framework can signal<br/>\nthe test an error, preserving the stack trace of the thrown<br/>\nexception to facilitate diagnosis.  that&#39;s cool, they&#39;re tests.<br/>\n<br/>\nbut the intent of checked exceptions is to signal abnormalities from<br/>\nwhich, in the opinion of the designer, client code should be<br/>\nreasonably expected to recover.  from that perspective, the<br/>\n&quot;throws Exception&quot; policy of the unit tests illustrates only one<br/>\npossibility for handling the exceptions--that of letting your caller<br/>\ndeal with it.  as such, it is not the best documentation for showing<br/>\nhow to handle exceptions that emanate from the code-under-test.<br/>\nthe tests really can&#39;t make those decisions on behalf of specific<br/>\ncallers.  but, they do a marvelous job of describing and ensuring<br/>\nbehavior of the code-under-test.<br/>\n<br/>\ngreat discussion!  i haven&#39;t turned my back on checked exceptions,<br/>\nbut i&#39;m handling them in my tests much differently, in a way that<br/>\nhopefully will make refactoring in the presence of checked exceptions<br/>\nless painful.<br/>\n<br/>\ncheers,<br/>\np<br/>\n<br/>\nPaul Holser</div>",
