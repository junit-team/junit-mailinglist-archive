Or Columbus\n&gt; going to the New World?  Both events happened( regardless of what some small\n&gt; fringe group say ).\n\nI dream of someone giving me $10M, but that dream goes against basic \nhuman nature. That is why it remains a dream.\n\nThe dreams you mention here go *with* human nature -- namely the desire \nto explore -- and that helped make them happen.\n\n&gt; The point I&#39;m making is that if you do not have goals then you won&#39;t get the\n&gt; benefits of reaching\n&gt; even part of your goal.\n\n From what I understand the goal of CMM is to define a process that even \na monkey could follow. Monkeys do not write software; people do.\n\n&gt; Don&#39;t get me wrong. I have been on the butt end of an Enterprise CMM effort.\n&gt; It&#39;s mucho annoying,\n&gt; however, the underlying goal is still valid and drives toward better\n&gt; software.\n\nIt drives towards more uniform results, certainly; but I don&#39;t know \nabout &quot;better software&quot;.\n-- \nJ.
