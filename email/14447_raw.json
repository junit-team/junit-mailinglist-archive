You have a much larger definition of &quot;small bit of functionality&quot;\n&gt;  &gt; than\n&gt;  &gt; I do ;-).  That sounds like a big chunk of an application to me.\n&gt; \n&gt; As I said, it was a contrived example... probably not the best.  For\n&gt; what it&#39;s worth, our application doesn&#39;t model things that way.  I was\n&gt; using our business logic in a contrived situation to attempt to make a\n&gt; point.  However, it only derailed into a critique of the code and such\n&gt; -- I&#39;ll know better next time.  The point was that asserts may exist\n&gt; within a context that are related only by the context itself.  They do\n&gt; not affect each other.  For instance, applying a CreditMemo in this case\n&gt; will change the amount of a Sale and possibly its CloseDate and Stage. \n&gt; Whether or not the resulting CloseDate was correct has no affect on\n&gt; whether or not the resulting amounts of the Sale are correct. \n&gt; Nevertheless, when applying the CreditMemo to a Sale it makes sense to\n&gt; assert for all of these things.\n\nI thought I saw this pattern in your example:\n\narrange\nact\nassert\nact some more\nassert some more\nact some more\nassert some more\n\nIck.\n\nIf I mis-saw, then ignore me happily. You already know when to do that, \nanyway. :)\n-- \nJ. B.
