Inner test classes can be nested to arbitrary depth, and @Before and @After methods and @Rules will be run at all levels--that is, tests in inner classes will get the benefit of befores and afters in their parent (and grandparent, etc) classes.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, whether or not you _should_ make use of nested tests I find is a matter of debate, but nonetheless it&#39;s a useful tool to have at your disposal (and rspec (ruby), Cedar (obj-c) and jasmine (javascript) all promote nested test structures).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSource code (and an example) is available <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/avh4/junit-nested\">https://github.com/avh4/junit-nested</a> and the jar is available on maven central as net.avh4.test:junit-nested:1.0.1<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is currently licensed under the EPL.  If you have need of a different license, please contact me.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, if anyone with more knowledge of the internals of BlockJUnit4ClassRunner can make any suggestions on improving my attempts to extend it, I would appreciate the feedback.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/avh4/junit-nested/blob/master/src/main/java/net/avh4/test/junit/InnerRunner.java\">https://github.com/avh4/junit-nested/blob/master/src/main/java/net/avh4/test/junit/InnerRunner.java</a><br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\n--Aaron V.</div>",
