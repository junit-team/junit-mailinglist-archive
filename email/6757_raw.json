In \nparticular with a final non-interfaced class. In this case it is not \npossible to either write a mock based on the same interface or extend the \nclass.\n\nThere is a workaround to this, let&#39;s take java.net.URL as an example of a \nclass with no useful interface and that is final.\n\nSimply don&#39;t use URL in your code. Always use your own interface say \n&#39;WebConnection&#39;.\n\nRealWebConnection is a simple adapter on the URL with passthrough methods \nthis is used everywhere a URL would be used.\n\nNow you can write tests for any classes that use webconnection as you can \ncreate a MockWebConnection.\n\n---\nThere are other problems related to MockObject usage such as the singleton \npattern. However there *are* workarounds to all problems and I have seen no \nsituation where a test can not be written using MockObjects.\n\nRegards,\nMatt\nhttp://www.mockmaker.org\n\n\n\nFrom: &quot;tobemligado &lt;jasbell@...&gt;&quot; &lt;jasbell@...&gt;\nReply-To: junit@yahoogroups.com\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: [junit] When can you NOT use Mock objects?\nDate: Sun, 26 Jan 2003 15:50:53 -0000\n\nCan someone explain a coding situation where a Mock object can not be\nused to solve a test case\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nStay in touch with MSN Messenger http://messenger.msn.co.uk\n\n\n",
