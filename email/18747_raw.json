Something like:\n\nassert_equal &quot;10 nuts, 10 bolts, 2 hinges&quot;, helper.method(order.products)\n\nwhich I thought was incredibly readable.\n\nLike for another test it created a string something like\n&quot;19Charactersxxxxxxx&quot;, which again was nice and readable.\n\nIt also generated exception tests.  It did however test the expected\nmessage which I think some people like to do and some do not.  Going\nforward it would be nice to see this type of decision configurable if\npossible.\n\nIn case I am out of  touch though, I am not aware of any other product\nwith this level of sophistication, am I correct?\n\nCheers\nShane\n\n-- \nShane Mingins\n\n",
