If you keep your print statements, \n&gt;&gt; you&#39;re\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; discovering each time your run you tests, which is a lost of time.\n&gt;\n&gt; What&#39;s more, you may not need your print statements to discover. Here \n&gt; is a\n&gt; common trick I use.\n&gt;\n&gt; Suppose I want to debug something by checking a value. I write the \n&gt; smallest\n&gt; test case possible to get to that point. If possible, I write this \n&gt; assertion:\n&gt;\n&gt; assertEquals( &quot;&quot;, objectInUse.getValueToCheck())\n&gt;\n&gt; This will fail and tell me what &#39;valueToCheck&#39; is, instead. Now I \n&gt; verify by\n&gt; hand and use that as the new expected value.\n&gt;\n&gt; assertEquals( &quot;myNewExpectedValue&quot;, objectInUse.getValueToCheck())\n&gt;\n&gt; If the value to check is buried somewhere, then I need access to it. A\n&gt; collecting parameter will help, at least until I refactor the object \n&gt; under test\n&gt; to be easier to test on its own. With the collecting parameter, I can \n&gt; grab the\n&gt; value at the right moment and assert its value afterwards.\n&gt;\n&gt; ValueCollector valueCollector = new ValueCollector();\n&gt; ObjectInUse objectInUse = new ObjectInUse(otherConstructorParameters,\n&gt; valueCollector);\n&gt; // stimulate objectInUse\n&gt; assertEquals( &quot;myExpectedValue&quot;, valueCollector.getValue().toString());\n&gt;\n&gt; Of course, if I&#39;m forcing myself to do a good job, I work harder at \n&gt; writing the\n&gt; smallest possible test. I learn as much as I can about the objects that\n&gt; ObjectInUse collaborates with. I refactor ObjectInUse to make it easier \n&gt; to fake\n&gt; out its collaborators. Now I can write a really small, fast test.\n&gt;\n&gt; Sometimes, I just put \n&gt; junit.framework.Assert.fail(objectToCheck.toString()) in\n&gt; my production code. It&#39;s better than printing a value, because I have \n&gt; the exact\n&gt; stack trace at my fingertips. After checking by hand, I might change it \n&gt; to a\n&gt; useful assertion. I might even leave it in there until I can write a \n&gt; better\n&gt; test. I try not to wait more than ten minutes before writing the \n&gt; test. :)\n&gt;\n&gt; J. B.
