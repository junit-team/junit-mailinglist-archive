They want to run tests regularly,\n&gt; during development, but why should they run the whole\n&gt; suite every time, when they are only changing a small\n&gt; section. The time it takes to do a test run is one of\n&gt; the major hurdles to getting developers to run the\n&gt; tests in the first place.\n\nThis sounds suspiciously like a make antipattern - put makefiles in \neach directory because it&#39;s too big to run from the top. Perhaps \nthat&#39;s unfair, I don&#39;t know enough about your environment.\n\nIt *might* be that that the tests are telling your project is too \nbig and needs to be modularized into smaller &#39;grains of release&#39;.\n\nBill de h�ra\n\n\n\n",
