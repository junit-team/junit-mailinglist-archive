    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2130950613\">My experience with JTest comes from speaking with the JTest engineers and<br/>\nseeing some demos, so please view the following comments in that light.<br/>\n<br/>\nJTest has two aspects:<br/>\n1) Coding standards review<br/>\n2) Locating unhandled exceptions.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first aspect is definitely interesting, but is also provided by a number<br/>\nof less expensive tools. I don&#39;t know whether they are all equivalent<br/>\nregarding completeness.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe second aspect is the one is where the most confusion between JTest,<br/>\nJUnit and our tool, Test Mentor come in. JTest examines your code a class at<br/>\na time and derives a set of inputs that will drive code paths for those<br/>\nclasses, for the purpose of detecting unhandled exceptions. The scheme it<br/>\nuses does not naturally find logic errors. You need to write tests for this,<br/>\nalthough you can capture simple inputs and outputs as &#39;regression&#39; tests.<br/>\nThis is certainly useful, but you&#39;re not going to find very many logic<br/>\nerrors this way without a lot of work, and validation is fairly primitive.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe biggest weak points for JTest are:<br/>\n1) JTest does not actually execute code in a Java virtual machine. According<br/>\nto the Parasoft engineer that I spoke with, JTest simulates execution, but<br/>\nyou are not really running your code on any particular Java platform.<br/>\n2) JTest tests are very class centric and do not scale up to clusters for<br/>\nframeworks. This means that it will be difficult for your to test a class in<br/>\nthe context of other collaborating classes.<br/>\n3) JTest is rather expensive (around $3500?).<br/>\n4) JTest is very slow. In all fairness it is doing a tremendous amount of<br/>\ncomputation in parsing code and simulating execution, but it&#39;s not something<br/>\nyou&#39;d be able to run every few minutes - more like overnight.<br/>\n5) It takes a while to crawl through the output that JTest creates. There<br/>\nare usually quite a number of false positives and you have to do a bit of<br/>\nmanual work to figure out which output indicates real problems, or spend<br/>\nsome time configuring the tool to ignore certain conditions.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have the money, you might want to consider purchasing a single<br/>\nlicense to run periodically overnight on a lab machine. If you&#39;re already<br/>\ndoing a good job writing real tests with JUnit or a commercial tool like<br/>\nTest Mentor, it will probably be redundant.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are at the end of a cycle and have no time or intention to write<br/>\ntests, you might consider using JTest to do a massive sweep of your code.<br/>\nIt&#39;s bound to find something interesting. Just be careful that if you use<br/>\nJTest to find problems and then start fixing them, you may introduce new<br/>\nlogic problems in your code that JTest does not find.<br/>\n<br/>\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br/>\nMike Silverstein<br/>\nSilverMark, Inc.<br/>\nThe object testing company<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.silvermark.com\">http://www.silvermark.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Marco Pas [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:marco.pas@...\">marco.pas@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, July 11, 2001 5:59 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: [junit] JUnit or JTest ?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We are evaluating products and was wondering about your opinion about<br/>\n&gt; which tools to use for unit testing.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Criteria are:<br/>\n&gt; - fast/flexible development of test cases<br/>\n&gt; - usable in a j2ee architecture<br/>\n&gt; - support for regression testing.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Any opinion from you would be highly appreciated.<br/>\n&gt; Kind Regards,<br/>\n&gt; Marco Pas<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
