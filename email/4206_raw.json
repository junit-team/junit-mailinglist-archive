Just found out that there have already been better answers.\n\nI do want to share one more experience, though.  I found out that &quot;use \ntest method to explain the method&quot; works well with paired programming (I \nguess it is definitely a good thing for XPers), while it is sometimes \nnot that easy to look at someone else&#39; test case and try to figure out \nwhat in the world he/she was trying to do. :)\n\nShane\n\n-- \nDisclaimer:  I join all the news groups out of my own interest.  All opinions expressed here are my own and not necessarily those of my employer.\n\n\nShane Duan wrote:\n\n&gt;They CAN belong to the same package and I think they DO need to belong \n&gt;to the same package so that you have the freedom to test some package \n&gt;level methods.\n&gt;\n&gt;Say if you have a class package1.package2.Untitled1 and a testcase \n&gt;package1.package2.TestUntitled1.  The source for the first class should \n&gt;be  src&#92;package1&#92;package2&#92;Untitled1.java and the second should be \n&gt;test&#92;package1&#92;package2&#92;TestUntitled1.  Notice how they differ at the \n&gt;root level but same all the way down?\n&gt;\n&gt;To compile the file, you just need to specify your source path as \n&gt;&quot;-sourcepath src;test&quot;.  Most of the IDE these days support multiple \n&gt;source paths (I cannot say ALL just becasue I haven&#39;t seen ALL).\n&gt;\n&gt;Shane\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n",
