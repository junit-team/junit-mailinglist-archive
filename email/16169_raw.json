I&#39;d be interested in\n&gt; any feedback, if people want to suggest additions or improvements.\n\nHm, some of these items seem to be bad ideas. But anti pattern sounds too \nstrong for my taste. \nAnyhow...\n\nNo unit tests: sounds like saying &quot;you sing wrong because you don&#39;t sing \nat all&quot;. If I don&#39;t test, I surley do something wrong, but I am not doing \nunit testing wrong.\n\nI don&#39;t like the section heading &quot;Refactoring&quot; because a refactoring is \nsomething different. Your &#39;refactorings&#39; actively change the code and its \nbehavior, while AFAIK a refactoring in terms of THE book doesn&#39;t do that. \nMaybe &#39;fixes&#39; or &#39;solutions&#39; would be better headings?\n\nMissing assertions may be ok, for example in a test that was written for a \nbug report where the code threw but shouldn&#39;t do so. This test can just \nhave a comment like // This line throws if bug 123 is not fixed.\n\nI also don&#39;t have problems with multiple assertions, if it&#39;s only two or \nthree. For example I may assert some object to be not null before \nasserting its properties.\n\nSuperficial coverage: this can happen for TDD beginners, and unless there \nis a requirement to check something not on the happy path, I wouldn&#39;t \nmake this a hard rule. For example, if I write tests that deal with \npeople&#39;s age (as an integer), I see no problem with not testing negative \nvalues, if the code is used in a context where this is other classes \nresponsibility.\n\nAn example for the &quot;only easy tests&quot; section would be helpful.\n\nI agree on the overly complex tests. However, you may not always be able \nto just refactor as you&#39;d like.\n\nYou could add time/date and randomness to the external dependencies.\n\nCheers,\n\nRobert\n\n",
