So this is somewhat incidental to \n&gt;=\r\nwhether to keep files in or out of java. If my test run breaks on \n&gt;g:/myCs=\r\nvFiles for a test input file, is it any less likely to break \n&gt;on g:/projec=\r\nt where the test java itself is located?\n\nNow, for some tests that I wrote =\r\nto test a Java version of the Unix touch tool, I generated the test file to=\r\n be touched using:\n\nFile testFile =3D File.createTempFile(&quot;utouch&quot;, &quot;.txt&quot;)=\r\n;\n&lt;do some testing stuff here&gt;\ntestFile.delete();\n\nThis worked well for me =\r\non both Windows 2000, Cygwin running on Windows 2000 and Linux. I have ever=\r\ny reason to believe that it will run on my new Mac OS X box, but time has n=\r\not yet permitted me to validate this.\n\nThe advantage of this is that I have=\r\n no idea where the file is and have no need to know. The file gets created =\r\nat the start of the test and deleted at the end of the test. I did it that =\r\nway because I was new to Junit and few of my test files seemed similar enou=\r\ngh to factor them out into the setUp or tearDown.\n\nSimon\n\n-----------------=\r\n------------------------------------------------\nSimon P.
