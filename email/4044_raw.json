I haven&#39;t looked into it deeply, but it looks similar in\ncapability to what is available in Eiffel and (via macro) C++.\n\nI think assertion-style internal testing is a different type of\ntesting.  It is really checking that the current state of the system is\n*within the design parameters*.  JUnit tests actually *define* the\ndesign parameters and check that the software behaves correctly within\nthem.\n\nSo I think there is definite room for both external tests and integral\ntests ala assertions.  \nThe external tests ask a question:\n  &quot;Does the software do the right thing if conditions are foo?&quot;\nand the integral tests make a statement:\n  &quot;If conditions are not foo, I cannot run.&quot;\n\nOn Tue, 2002-02-12 at 17:14, Nilesh Thali wrote:\n    Someone please clarify this for me:\n    \n    Manuel Amago wrote:\n    \n    &gt; &gt; it struck me why not have a self assertive code\n    &gt;\n    &gt; The only solution that I can see would be to make testing (or assertion)\n    &gt; an integral part of the language (ala Eiffel).  This would mean that\n    &gt; tests (assertions) would be an integral part of a method definition.\n    \n        What does self-assertive mean ? JUnit, the way i understand it, tests\n        my class methods with static data that i expect.\n        e.g. assertTrue(40, add(20, 20));\n    \n        How can i put that in my code itself ? the real data is going to be\n    changing.\n        All i can assert within my code is that references are not null.\n    \n    Thanks,\n    Nilesh\n    \n    \n    \n    To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n    junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n     \n    \n    Your use of Yahoo!
