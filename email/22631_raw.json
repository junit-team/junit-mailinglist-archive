It should be MethodRule, but that would require all the rules out there to change.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Could you clarify what you mean by that? In the git branch, Rule is an \n&gt;&gt; annotation and ClassRule an interface so I don&#39;t understand what you \n&gt;&gt; mean by asymmetry.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; What should be MethodRule?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Changing existing rules is inevitable, since MethodRule#apply operates \n&gt;&gt; in the context of a FrameworkMethod and an instantiated target object, \n&gt;&gt; neither of which are available at class scope.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Also, I&#39;m not happy about encouraging more extra-test state as this reduces the chances that tests are independent. I&#39;m feeling quite the fuddy-duddy on this, though.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; If I have a supporting database that I need to load from an SQL dump, \n&gt;&gt; and then want to run 20 different tests using it, it&#39;s not a very \n&gt;&gt; palatable option to needlessly reload the databsae 20 times instead of 1.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I agree I&#39;m taking liberties with the definition of a _unit_ test by \n&gt;&gt; doing so, but when dealing with legacy code and legacy testsuites, \n&gt;&gt; sometimes a philosophically-impure test is better than no test at all.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Max.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
