I don&#39;t do code for &quot;consumers&quot; style end-\nusers.\n&gt; More like a system that is put into production at some point, not \nan app\n&gt; installed on a desktop. Having a special hook in the app to enable \nrunning\n&gt; unit tests on production hardware & software setup might prove \nvaluable when\n&gt; you suspect a problem with a JVM for example.\n&gt; \n&gt;  I totally agree with what Michael expressed below. In my case, I \ncurrently\n&gt; work for an IT departement that wants to maintain the code on it&#39;s \nown after\n&gt; the project (so &quot;source code is provided&quot;). They are buying code, \nand we\n&gt; give them tests as an added bonus. As for bandwith & storage, I \nthink it is\n&gt; a moot point. How much for a 20 Gig theses days? If the code is not \nan\n&gt; applet, I don&#39;t see why it would generate bandwith loss more than me\n&gt; downloading mp3s  ;)\n&gt; \n&gt; mathieu\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; From: Michael Silverstein\n&gt; \n&gt; Definitely if source code is provided, including test cases make \nsense. I\n&gt; think we all agree now that within the context of end-user \napplication\n&gt; deployment, it doesn&#39;t make sense to include test cases, except for \nspecial\n&gt; diagnostic circumstances. If a product deliverable includes source \ncode, or\n&gt; is a framework that provides a set of Java APIs, then a set of test \ncases is\n&gt; invaluable for documenting and validating product usage.\n\n\n",
