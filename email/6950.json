For every test method (&#39;public void&#39; and<br/>\nstarting with &#39;test&#39;) there will be a new instance of your test class.<br/>\n<br/>\nCan you show your code to verify what you are doing differently?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;The test object<br/>\n&gt; created during setup turned out to be reused for<br/>\n&gt; subsequent tests in the test case, which caused problems<br/>\n&gt; arising from old state, until I figured it out.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This might be the case if you are using static variables instead of member<br/>\nvariables.<br/>\nProbably a code example will best reveal the problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nI strongly agree to your general comment:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Note:<br/>\n&gt; In general, I&#39;m not much fond of the name, &quot;TestCase&quot;, because<br/>\n&gt; to me that represents a single test. Since a TestCase class can<br/>\n&gt; actually have multiple test methods, the name &quot;TestFixture&quot; is<br/>\n&gt; probably more appropriate. But be that as it may...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It appears to me that the word &quot;test&quot; is badly overloaded in the<br/>\n&gt; docs, meaning at various times, test method, test case, and<br/>\n&gt; potentially even test suite.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The best way to eliminate confusion that I can see is to do a<br/>\n&gt; global search on &quot;test &quot;, and replace with one of the hyphenated<br/>\n&gt; words &quot;test-method&quot;, &quot;test-case&quot;, or &quot;test-suite&quot;, as appropriate.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Johannes<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n+++ GMX - Mail, Messaging & more  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.gmx.net\">http://www.gmx.net</a> +++<br/>\nBitte lächeln!
