The problem I&#39;ve seen in the past with<br/>\ncalling overridden methods in a constructor is that the variables in<br/>\nthe subclass are initialised *after* the superclass constructor<br/>\nreturns. That means any changes you make to the subclass variables in<br/>\nthe overridden method are lost (at least if there is explicit<br/>\ninitialisation). It also means that the method will be called without<br/>\nthe initialisation having taken place, so it&#39;s effectively running in<br/>\na partially constructed context.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo yes, it&#39;s generally not a good idea, but very occasionally it can<br/>\nbe the simplest way of working, and it should certainly work in the<br/>\nOP&#39;s case - and does for me... I&#39;d be interested to try to work out<br/>\nexactly why it doesn&#39;t on the OP&#39;s box.<br/>\n<br/>\nJon</div>",
