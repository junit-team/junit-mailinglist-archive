The last\n&gt;&gt;  notes I can find on the JUnit site bemoan the fact JUnit4 has not been\n&gt;&gt;  integrated into any IDEs or test and build tools yet.  However that\n&gt;&gt;  was over a year ago.  Any update on this?  I would be particularly\n&gt;&gt;  interested in:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;  Eclipse\n&gt;&gt;  Netbeans\n&gt;&gt;  IntelliJ\n&gt;&gt;  Cruise Control\n&gt;&gt;  Fitnesse\n&gt;&gt;  JSystem\n&gt;&gt;  maven\n&gt;&gt;  cactus\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve used Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, CruiseControl and Maven on projects\n&gt; that used JUnit 4. As far as I can remember, there was no need to\n&gt; tweak anything about the IDEs or CruiseControl but we needed to\n&gt; install a snapshot version of Maven&#39;s surefire plugin because JUnit 4\n&gt; support wasn&#39;t yet released back then but it&#39;s now supported out of\n&gt; the box so that shouldn&#39;t be an issue anymore.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m not sure how Fitnesse relates to JUnit(?), I haven&#39;t used Cactus\n&gt; in ages, and I hadn&#39;t even heard of JSystem before now so no comment\n&gt; about those.\n&gt; \n&gt; I hope this helps,\n&gt; Lasse\n&gt; \n\nLasse,\n\nThanks for the quick response.  Your response makes me feel a lot \nbetter.  I was just reading up on Eclipse and JUnit4 so I am glad to \nhear most of the rest is good also.\n\nAs for the other products, JSystem I saw listed on the JUnit pages as a \ntool to expand unit testing to system/functional testing.  Fitnesse (if \nit is even still maintained) was intended to pick up testing where the \ndeveloper leaves off and the customer picks up so is geared towards \ncustomer definable acceptance tests.  I need to go read up again because \nI don&#39;t recall if it uses JUnit under the covers, or can be used to at \nleast re-run the JUnit tests on the customer facing test site or what. \nI was just covering all bases on my request.\n\nThanks again,\nRobert Kuropkat\n\n",
