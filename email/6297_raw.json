The annual maintenance and support is \ntargeted at companies who want/need more/faster support.\n\nWith the &quot;basic maintenance and support&quot;, you still have access to the \nsupport forums,  and the  EAP (Early Access Program). It is still \nrunning, and has already produced 2 bugfixes releases, that work with \nthe standard licenses.\nIt should also give you access to next EAP (for the next version), that, \nI think, should start in about 2 months.\n\nCheer up : they are not going the JBuilder way.\n\nAlain Ravet\n\n\n",
