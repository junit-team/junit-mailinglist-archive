When I tell it to run a single \ntest=\r\n, it will instead run all of the tests in the class up to and \nincluding th=\r\ne one I want, but will only give the results of the one I \nspecified. \n\nThi=\r\ns is fine for my normal unit tests, but I also use JUnit for my \nintegratio=\r\nn tests, and some of those tests can take some time to \ncomplete. If I choo=\r\nse to run a test that is physically near the bottom \nof the class, it can t=\r\nake minutes before it will run my test. \n\nIs there a way to really make it =\r\nonly run the one test you specify? \n\n\n\n\n",
