Do you think it is better or worse\n&gt; than the current assertions? I would like to have it included in the\n&gt; new release, would you too? David, why do you think using constraints\n&gt; is heavy weight? \n&gt; \n\nI have been playing with assertThat(). I like it a lot and will continue \nto use it. I will continue to use it whether or not it is part of the \nframework.\n\nI have also been experimenting with using &quot;should&quot; in the names of all \nmy tests. I was quite surprised by the positive effect it had on the \nquality of my tests.\n\nI have no strong opinion on the other issues you mention.\n\nKevin\n\n",
