Coming from this context your email got my\nattention.\n\n \n\nI think it is interesting to be clear about differences between Servlets\nand Portlets, but I am not sure if this really will help me to come up\nwith a good strategy on how to test Portlets.  With Servlets I always\ntry to implement as much as possible as POJOs which allows me to test\nmost of the functionality outside of a Servlet container.\n\n \n\nI assume this will not be much different with Portlets.  For Servlets I\nfound good Mock classes for Request and Response objects and other\nclasses to be passed around in Servlets (for example the Spring\nFramework provides good Mock objects in that regard).\n\n \n\nAre you aware of any such test supporting implementations in the Portlet\ncontext (besides the one you referenced in your follow up email)?  \n\n \n\nI think it is also interesting discussing Best Practices on designing\ntestable Portlets.  I think designing components should always include\ntestability.  Did you come across such information yet?\n\n \n\nThank you for providing the link to portletUnit\n(http://m0smith.freeshell.org/portletunit/docs/index.php).  That looks\ndefinitely interesting.\n\n \n\nAndreas\n\n   \n\n \n\n________________________________\n\nFrom: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of\nKamal Ahmed\nSent: Tuesday, September 26, 2006 10:54 AM\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: RE: [junit] Testing portlets with JUnit\n\n \n\nJB,\n\nNow that I am back on testing portlets, I found that there some\ndifferences\nand similarities between them:\n\nWhat are the differences between portlets and servlets?\n\nEssentially, Servlets provide content that normally takes up the whole\npage\nin a browser (unless you&#39;re using frames), and portlets provide content\nthat\nis wrapped by a window. \n\nWith portlets, you can have multiple portlets side by side with one\nanother\nand each one can provide content and functionality that is different\nfrom\nthe other. \n\nA portlet can provide the complete interaction for one type of\napplication,\nwhile another portlet can provide content for another type of\napplication. \n\nThe portal can provide some house keeping functionality and secured\nsingle\npoint of entry to all of the portlets on a page. \n\nAs for the particulars (similarities/differences) between them, please\ncontinue reading.\n\nHere are some similarities:\n\nServlets and portlets are web based components that utilize Java for\ntheir\nimplementation\n\nPortlets are managed by a portlet container similar to a servlet\ncontainer\n\nBoth of these components generate content, which can be static or\ndynamic\n\nBoth portlets and servlets have a lifecycle that is controlled by the\ncontainer\n\nThe client/server model is used for both servlets and portlets\n\nThe packaging and deployment are essentially the same\n\nThe manner in which the classes are loaded and the class loaders that\nperform the work are also the same\n\nLifecycle management is similar\n\nThe Request and Response semantics are also similar\n\nHere are some differences:\n\nServlets can provide complete web pages, whereas portlets only provide\nfragments. These fragments are then aggregated to form a complete web\npage\nby the portal\n\nPortlets aren&#39;t allowed to generated HTML code that contains tags such\nas\nbase, body, frame, frameset, head, html, or title. The iframe tag can be\nused with caution.\n\nThe user cannot access a portlet directly using a URL in the way that a\nservlet is accessed. Instead, the URL points to the page containing all\nof\nthe portlets on one page\n\nCommunication between the web client and the portlets is performed\nthrough\nthe portal\n\nPortlets can be provided with buttons or controls to manipulate the\nportlets&#39; window states or portlet modes\n\nMultiple instances of a single portlet can be placed onto the same page\n\nPortlets support persistent configuration and customization\n\nPortlets also support user profile information\n\nPortlets support two scopes within the session; application scope and\nportlet scope\n\nThere are several things that servlets are allowed to do, but portlets\naren&#39;t. These include the following:\n\nPortlet aren&#39;t allowed to set the character set encoding of the response\n\nPortlet also aren&#39;t allowed to set the HTTP headers on the response\n\nPortlet cannot manipulate the URL of the client request to the portal\n\nIn view of these similarities and differences, do you think , with minor\nchanges to the recipes, I would be able to develop tests for portlets?\n\nThanks,\n\n-Kamal.\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: junit@yahoogroups.com &lt;mailto:junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt;\n[mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com &lt;mailto:junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt; ] On\nBehalf Of J.\nB.

In that case, _JUnit Recipes_ has a chapter on testing web \n\ncomponents, and the recipes that apply to servlets should apply pretty \n\nwell to portlets.\n\nTake care.\n\n-- \n\nJ. B.
