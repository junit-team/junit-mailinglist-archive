Great writeup.\n\nThanks.\n\n&gt; But at this point I&#39;ve lost track of how that discussion applies to\n&gt; the problem of testing private methods.\n\nTrue.\n\n&gt; What was your solution to that problem?\n\nI don&#39;t.\n\nAlso, I don&#39;t intentionally make private methods.  They are generally\na result of refactoring.  Another place I&#39;ll have privates is if I am\nsing factory methods for instantiation.  Then I&#39;ll have private\nconstructors.\n\nPrivate methods aren&#39;t part of the external behavior of the system, so\nit needn&#39;t be directly tested.  TDD drives the design and\nimplementation of the external behavior.  So you code the external\nbehavior to pass the test.  When you cleanup by refactoring and start\nextracting bits, those extracted methods are structural, not\nbehavioral, so I make them private. \n\nAs mentioned before, there are times when a subset of a class can be\nextracted, then maybe some of the private methods that go with it\nchange to publis.. as makes sense.  But if that&#39;s going to happen.. it\nhas to happen in response to a failing test.\n\nDave\n\n\n\n",
