Unless the DB is set up, the test will fail. <br/>\n<br/>\nDifferentiating between completely standalone tests (eg StingUtility <br/>\nclasses) or requires a test environment (eg database, file structure) <br/>\nwould be terrific, especially with the Ant junit batchtest structure, <br/>\nwhere Ant works its way through the code and finds Tester classes to <br/>\nrun.  It doesn&#39;t have any way of knowing the environment that it&#39;s <br/>\nrunning in, or the environment that the test needs.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example:<br/>\n<br/>\na new method<br/>\n<br/>\nString getProject() - Returns the name of the project.  Allows for <br/>\nsimple &quot;namespaces&quot; for test environments.<br/>\n<br/>\nString[] getTestEnvironments() - that returns a list of required test <br/>\nenvironments (by name).  <br/>\n<br/>\nUpdated JUnit testrunners that will by default run all tests <br/>\nregardless of environment.  New JUnit testrunners that take a list of <br/>\navailable projects/test environmnets as parameters, and only run <br/>\nthose tests that run in available environments.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll of which would be upwardly compatible.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny thoughts?<br/>\n<br/>\nDavid Ford</div>",
