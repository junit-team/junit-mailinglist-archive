If not,<br/>\n&gt; can you picture how it must be done? Once all the stones are in place,<br/>\n&gt; they stay there because none of them can fall through the others. But<br/>\n&gt; how do you get them there in the first place? Image trying to hold all<br/>\n&gt; the stones in place simultaneously while you try to get the keystone<br/>\n&gt; set. You would drop a lot of them and get really frustrated. But a<br/>\n&gt; mason first builds a simple wooden form shaped like the interior of<br/>\n&gt; the arch and piles the stones on it. Then he takes it away when they<br/>\n&gt; are in place. Even though he has done this &quot;extra work&quot; of building<br/>\n&gt; the form, it is faster and more reliable to do it that way. It is the<br/>\n&gt; same thing with developer unit tests.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hy,<br/>\n<br/>\nalthough I think you miss the original posters point (as he knows about <br/>\ntest-first and seems to use it when possible but asks what to do when he&#39;s <br/>\nforced to test-last) I like that analogy a lot. It really captures the <br/>\nessence of test-driven development and can probably be successfully used <br/>\nto describe tests-first to non-developers (PHB & Co).<br/>\n<br/>\nregards<br/>\nJoachim Sauer<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
