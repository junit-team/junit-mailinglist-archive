I&#39;ll ask again on our mailing list and see wh=\r\nat the consensus is. CPL is actually accepted if it&#39;s included in a binary =\r\nform. Is that easy to do?\n(I&#39;m new to java/java build systems and just agre=\r\ned to check all the licensing stuff is in order, I do know other languages =\r\nso i&#39;m not completely clueless however)\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, Step=\r\nhen Connolly &lt;stephen.alan.connolly@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; There are loads of apac=\r\nhe projects using junit. I think you may be\n&gt; mis-interpreting the requirem=\r\nents.\n&gt; \n&gt; If you are building with maven (for fecks sake we use junit) the=\r\nn you are\n&gt; not distributing either the junit source code or the binary, so=\r\n you\n&gt; shouldn&#39;t even need to worry.\n&gt; \n&gt; Iirc the rules are for code inclu=\r\nded in the source distribution that the\n&gt; vote applies to. Are you really i=\r\nncluding junit in that?\n&gt; \n&gt; On Thursday, 13 September 2012, anguslturner w=\r\nrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hi all,\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m currently managing a release for Apache Wave (=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; http://incubator.apache.org/wave/) and we use junit for our unit testi=\r\nng.\n&gt; &gt; I realise this is released under the CPL license however it is not\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; compatible with the Apache 2 License, which Apache require us to use. I=\r\n was\n&gt; &gt; wondering if it would be possible to relicense the software under =\r\na\n&gt; &gt; different license so we can continue to use the software. A good list=\r\n of\n&gt; &gt; licenses to use is located here:\n&gt; &gt; http://www.apache.org/legal/re=\r\nsolved.html#category-a\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
