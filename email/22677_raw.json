The=\r\nn you can start your JUnit tests,\n&gt; and they simply start their own cache, =\r\nwhich is configured to work\n&gt; distributed and connect to the already runnin=\r\ng cache of VmWare-related\n&gt; objects. Then the objects that you created with=\r\n VmWare will also be\n&gt; available for the unit tests.\n&gt;\n&gt; The connection in =\r\nJUnit can be performed in a Rule or in the BeforeClass\n&gt; methods.\n&gt;\n&gt; Cheer=\r\ns,\n&gt; Bogdan\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In junit@yahoogroups.com &lt;junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt;, A=\r\nnanth &lt;cbananth@...&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks a lot Kent.
