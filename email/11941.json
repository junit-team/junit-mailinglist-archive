So i was not <br/>\n&gt; sure if we could handle pop up windows and page refreshed. I would <br/>\n&gt; really appreciate if you could let me know how its done. And thanks for <br/>\n&gt; your quick response.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Have you tried HtmlUnit or jWebUnit? I suppose that, since jWebUnit <br/>\nbuilds on HttpUnit, then it may not help, but you never know.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegarding the pop-up windows, what are you testing? Does your test need <br/>\nto know that these windows are popping up, or could you simply test the <br/>\npop-up windows by navigating to them directly? If you could do that, <br/>\nthen you could avoid the problem of setting focus on them.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
