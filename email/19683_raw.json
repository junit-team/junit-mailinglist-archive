Not only the unit \ntesting that JUnit can help on, but GUI testing, button clicking and all \nsorts of ugly stuff.\n\n\n\n&gt; The bottom line is that most projects are\n&gt; too big, and especially most &quot;midsize enterprise application&quot;s are too\n&gt; big, by which I mean that they&#39;re much more often than not treated as\n&gt; big blobs of stuff, rather than side-by-side, loosely coupled modules\n&gt; that work when you put them together.\n\nI&#39;m biased towards &quot;Better, Faster, Lighter Java&quot;\nas a philosophy, but I&#39;m not sure it is practical.\nSome applications are just big, slow, and ugly.\n\nI think that a fair number of magic numbers and parameters would be \neasier to edit, check, and use if they were written in Java code. \nSingleton or not. Its not like editing big XML files is something you \nshould do in Notepad.\n\nJust IMHO, of course.\n\n-- \nPat Farrell\nhttp://www.pfarrell.com/\n\n\n",
