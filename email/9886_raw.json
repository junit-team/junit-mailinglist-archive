My question was sparked\nbecause I was in what I would call a laborous position - multiple code paths\nso multiple test cases. I had 30 test cases for one method, amounting to 300\nlines of code. Is this tedious or difficult. In JUnit world, does tedious ==\ndifficult?\n\nThanks,\nKevin.\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: J. B. Rainsberger [mailto:jbrains@...]\nSent: Thursday, November 13, 2003 21:10\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: Re: [junit] how many tests on a method - all possible scenarios or\njust enough?\n\n\nPaolo &quot;Nusco&quot; Perrotta wrote:\n\n&gt;  &gt; I&#39;ve started investigating JUnit and I&#39;m finding that for methods in my\n&gt;  &gt; application that have some non trivial logic (basically multiple if\npaths\n&gt;  &gt; through the method) that my JUnit tests are becoming unwieldy to\n&gt; setup and\n&gt;  &gt; maintain. I&#39;m retrofitting unit tests onto an existing large J2EE app.\n&gt;\n&gt; To me, one of the benefits of tests is that they help me to spot design\n&gt; problems early. Whenever I find it difficult to write a test for a method,\nI\n&gt; ask myself whether it&#39;s the method&#39;s fault.\n\nI would estimate that 99% of the time -- no hyperbole -- the problem is\nToo Many Responsibilities. As to whether you can conveniently refactor,\nthat is another issue.\n\nTry garden-variety Extract Method. If a method has too many codepaths,\nextract the smallest, innermost part you could reasonably test on its\nown, make it public, then test it in isolation. Repeat until happy.\n--\nJ. B.
