One of the strengths of the framework (IMHO) is the<br/>\nguidance it gives me to fix every test incrementally.  I am unclear on why<br/>\nyou would want the test to go on.  It seems to me that you would end up<br/>\nbiting off more than you can chew.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">     &gt; Hi,<br/>\n    &gt; <br/>\n    &gt; When I run my test suite I found that each test stops <br/>\n    &gt; running after the<br/>\n    &gt; first failed assertion. I have a number of assertions in <br/>\n    &gt; each test and I<br/>\n    &gt; would like to know every assertion that is broken. I have tried to<br/>\n    &gt; create a default TestResult inside each test using,<br/>\n    &gt; <br/>\n    &gt; \tTestResult result = createResult();<br/>\n    &gt; <br/>\n    &gt; and then adding failures to &#39;result&#39; using,<br/>\n    &gt; <br/>\n    &gt; \tresult.addFailure(mytest, afe);<br/>\n    &gt; <br/>\n    &gt; which works fine, except that no AssertionFailedException <br/>\n    &gt; gets thrown<br/>\n    &gt; this way and my test passes even though I have broken assertions.<br/>\n    &gt; <br/>\n    &gt; Is there any way I can get JUnit to show all broken <br/>\n    &gt; assertions for each<br/>\n    &gt; test and not move onto the next test when the first <br/>\n    &gt; assertion fails? </span></blockquote></div>",
