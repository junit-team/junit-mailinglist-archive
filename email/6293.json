My experience indicates that writing <br/>\neffective tests first reduces the overall programming overhead.  That <br/>\nis, I write less production code because the designs that emerge by <br/>\nsatisfying tests tend to be simpler with less code.  It also generally <br/>\ntakes less code to make these designs respond to change.  Moreover, I&#39;m <br/>\nonly writing code that a customer really needs today.  So, in the big <br/>\npot theory of economics, I&#39;ve found writing unit tests to be underhead, <br/>\nif there is such a thing.  <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;2) What are the tools you use for creation of unit tests, if any?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t mean to be flippant, but the tool encased by my cranium has <br/>\nproven to be the most valuable.  It&#39;s able to ask and answer questions <br/>\nlike: &quot;What is this chunk of code supposed to do?&quot;  Then I just use an <br/>\neditor (Eclipse) to reify the question and answer in code.  As a <br/>\nconvenience, I have a template in Eclipse that lays down the boilerplate <br/>\ncode for a test case.<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;3) Do you prefer using tools for unit tests creation?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Tools can be useful and productive to automate things, though I prefer <br/>\nto understand how to do those things manually first.  I&#39;m then free from <br/>\nthe bondage of a tool, which is often handy when visiting projects that <br/>\nuse different tools.  That is, the absence of a tool never stands in my <br/>\nway of writing tests.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re referring to tools that purport to automatically write tests <br/>\nby inspecting code, then I have used those as a supplement to unit tests <br/>\nI write.   Used as a sole means for testing, I miss the opportunity for <br/>\nbetter designs.  I&#39;ve found automatic test generators to be especially <br/>\nhelpful when faced with refactoring legacy code for which no tests <br/>\nexist.  It&#39;s better than no tests at all.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;4) We use JBuilder in our development efforst. What would you advise us to go for to reduce our development overheads associated with unit tests?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>When and how are you writing tests now?  To what extent is that <br/>\nincurring an overhead?  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;5) What do you guys think of cactus?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It&#39;s an excellent tool if you really must test components fronted by a <br/>\nweb application in their native environment.  If you start swinging the <br/>\nCactus golden hammer too early, then it&#39;s been my experience that soon <br/>\neverything indeed must be tested within the container.  I strive to <br/>\nnever use it, focusing instead on building modular components that can <br/>\nbe tested outside of the container.  Components of this sort then don&#39;t <br/>\ndepend on the container, and the technology implied therein.  So, <br/>\nalthough Cactus is well-designed and scratches certain itches, using it <br/>\nshould be an exception, not the rule.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps.  Please ask for clarification on any of these answers <br/>\nif they don&#39;t make sense.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike  <br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nMike Clark<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clarkware.com\">http://clarkware.com</a> <br/>\n(720) 851-2014</div>",
