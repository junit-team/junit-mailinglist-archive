As for me stress<br/>\n&gt; testing is testing in conditions which are very close<br/>\n&gt; to &quot;production&quot;. Is it possible to call such a testing as &quot;unit&quot;<br/>\n&gt; testing? In most cases stresstests are to figure out how set of<br/>\n&gt; components works, this set may be distributed between server and<br/>\n&gt; client, between peers, and so on... but jUnit fundamently works on<br/>\n&gt; one machine. I think PRIMARILY jUnit is for testing of classes or<br/>\n&gt; small sets of components. Am I right?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes.
