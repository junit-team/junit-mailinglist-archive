Thanks a lot. I also went back and\nlooked at my build script. Then I took out the line that unset the\nDISPLAY variable, and magically everything worked :) The only problem\nis that I have to be root to start the X server remotely, since I\ndon&#39;t have ownership of the console. I&#39;m going to try the frame buffer \nthing to see if that gets me past this. Otherwise, I&#39;m just going to\nset up that machine to run Xdm, and not worry about it.\n\nThanks again for your help,\n\nbab\n\n-- \nBrian Button            bbutton@...\nSenior Consultant       Object Mentor, Inc\nSt. Louis, MO\t\thttp://www.objectmentor.com\n\n\n",
