Three things <br/>\n&gt; have changed.<br/>\n&gt;   * The class is now annotated with a class used to run it: <br/>\n&gt; @Factory(Parameterized.class). This seems like a very general mechanism <br/>\n&gt; to me. For example, I was able to write a test runnerlet to run JUnit <br/>\n&gt; 3.x AllTests in a few minutes. Would JUnit extenders find this <br/>\n&gt; annotation generally helpful?<br/>\n&gt;   * The data comes from a static method instead of a static field. A <br/>\n&gt; method seemed more general than a field and is evaluated later, when the <br/>\n&gt; test is run instead of when the class is loaded. Totally static data can <br/>\n&gt; be simply implemented by a method which just returns that data.<br/>\n&gt;   * Parameters are passed to a constructor instead of stuffed into <br/>\n&gt; fields. This seems more general as well as reducing the number of <br/>\n&gt; annotations by one. One limitation of the current implementation is that <br/>\n&gt; parameterized test classes can only have a single constructor.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I quite like this, Kent.
