E.g.: run all =A0tests that are not in (a) certain categ=\r\nory(s)? This is probably not difficult add in one way or another onto the c=\r\noncept of categories, but the answer to &quot;which test is now acctually includ=\r\ned&quot; could become confusing in cases where a test is in an included and an e=\r\nxcluded category. I would like to see something here that does not require =\r\na lot of browsing through hierarchies of suites nad categories. This may in=\r\n my approach not well solved either as suites can extend on other suites: i=\r\nf a referenced suite includes a certain test, it is executed even if the ex=\r\ntending suite excludes a test.\n\nGeorg,\n\nWe came very close to adding an Exc=\r\nludeCategories annotation.\nHowever, we decided to stay at a minimal feature=\r\n set for Categories in\nthe initial release, figuring that if the whole API =\r\nturned out to be\nwrong, or if users just shrugged, then any time put into p=\r\nerfecting\nthe mini-language of category filter configuration would be waste=\r\nd.\nIf the feature takes off, I think we&#39;ll certainly revisit that\ndecision =\r\n(especially if a highly-voted github issue requests it, hint,\nhint.)\n\nHowev=\r\ner, Iyou touch on another concern: a simple category feature set\nthat is ea=\r\nsy to understand, but leaves out 20% of valid use cases, may\nbe preferable =\r\nto a more &quot;feature complete&quot; feature implementation that\nrequires pages of =\r\ndocumentation to fully grok.  I don&#39;t know that\nwe&#39;re in danger of either e=\r\nxtreme yet.\n\n   David Saff\n\n&gt;\n&gt; And more fundamentally: is the idea/need of=\r\n exclusion meaningfull or just a result of badly organising tests (I&#39;d say =\r\nno, but I may be wrong)?\n&gt;\n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; =A0Georg\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; -----------------=\r\n-------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
