I would\n&gt; like to test it using Junit. However, this requires me to write a\n&gt; test case which is distributed among many processes which act as\n&gt; client/servers.\n&gt;\n\nConventional wisdom says to use mock objects to simulate the network.  The\nclient tests use mock objects to simulate the server; the server tests use\nmock objects to simulate the client.  The client and server stay decoupled\nand can be developed concurrently by the team.  These tests get run very\nfrequently and they don&#39;t take long to run.\n\nOn a less frequent basis, and possibly taking more time to run, other tests\nusing the &quot;real&quot; objects are run for end-to-end testing.  Ideally, the only\ndifference is that the mock objects are dynamically removed from the tests by\nplugging in a new factory.\n\nMike\n\n--\nMike Clark\nClarkware Consulting, Inc.\nhttp://www.clarkware.com\n720.851.2014\n\n\n\n",
