It looks very nice,\nand is well architected. I haven&#39;t seen anybody talk about it, so I&#39;ll\nprovide the links. \n\nSee the page: http://junit.netbeans.org/JUnit_installation.html and look for\nthe &quot;extensions&quot; link, which is in the section labeled &quot;Dependencies&quot;. The\nlink is http://junit.netbeans.org/download/junit-file-diff.zip - My browser\ndoesn&#39;t seem to like retrieving this file directly from the zip file link. \n\n\nHas anyone had any experience with using this? Are there any other\nextensions like this floating around? \n\n\nBill Laird\n\n",
