My group uses both\ntools depen=\r\nding on the project and our specific needs so I honestly\ncan&#39;t tell you to =\r\nuse one vs the other. ;-)\n\nAs for Continuum... It comes from the same team =\r\nworking on the Maven\nbuild tool and is a very nice CI server. It is newer t=\r\nhan\nCruiseControl but there are a number of people using it and working on\n=\r\nit etc and the user list is rather active. They are working on v1.1\nwith a =\r\nlarge number of new features etc so its taking some time.\n\nAs you mentioned=\r\n, CruiseControl and Anthill are two other CI servers.\nMost people I know ru=\r\nn CruiseControl; I actually don&#39;t know anyone\npersonally who runs Anthill, =\r\nbut that doesn&#39;t mean much. I would take\na look at the various CI server ma=\r\niling lists, current/planned feature\nlists, SCM check-ins and bug trackers =\r\nto get a feel for which one is\nthe best fit for your team.\n\nWayne\n\nOn 3/8/0=\r\n7, Niklas Saers &lt;niklassaers@... &lt;mailto:niklassaers%40gmail.com&gt; &gt; w=\r\nrote:\n&gt; Thanks guys for your many answers. I have a couple of questions\n&gt; r=\r\negarding your suggestions:\n&gt;\n&gt; C=E9deric and Wayne: TestNG: how mature / we=\r\nll used is this compared to\n&gt; JUnit? I&#39;ve been using JUnit in a few project=\r\ns before and see that\n&gt; lots of people use it. I&#39;ve heared about TestNG bef=\r\nore and when\n&gt; researching my ignore problems I saw it and thought that its=\r\n\n&gt; different parameters for @Test looked intriguing. Does JUnit do stuff\n&gt; =\r\nthat TestNG doesn&#39;t that I should know that I&#39;m sacrificing should I\n&gt; swit=\r\nch to TestNG?\n&gt;\n&gt; Continuum 1.0.3 is considered a preview release from its\n=\r\n&gt; documentation and was released a year ago. This tells me that it is\n&gt; not=\r\n stable and well-tried and probably hasn&#39;t a big community\n&gt; submitting bug=\r\ns and coming with feature requests. This of course is\n&gt; countered by 79 com=\r\nmits last month. :-) What is the state of Continuum?\n&gt;\n&gt; How do CruiseContr=\r\nol, Continuum and Anthill compare to one-another?\n&gt; Thanks Wayne for these =\r\npointers, it all looks like a much better deal\n&gt; than Cron. :-)\n&gt;\n&gt; Cheers\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; Nik\n\n\n \n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
