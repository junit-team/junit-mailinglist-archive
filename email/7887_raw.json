B. Rainsberger wrote:\n\n&gt; What about Ant makes it difficult to manage widely-ranging  \n&gt; dependencies and tasks? If Ant can do what make can do, when why is  \n&gt; Ant any less suited to building the JDK/JVM than make?\n\nNothing in the architecture of Ant per se. Compiling native  \nexecutables, however, requires quite a bit of knowledge of the local  \nplatform: What options to pass to the compiler, where to find the  \ncompiler, what libraries are needed, how to make shared libraries, how  \nto package executables (resources, bundles and so forth), etc.\n\nMake is missing much of this as well, but most people do not use raw  \nmake for cross-platform work. There are a lot of tools out there which  \nalready have the logic to ferret out many of these settings and many  \ncompanies already have an in-house tool for their projects. These  \ntools, by and large, know how to write makefiles. This logic would need  \nto be coded into Ant (or an add-on) and and Ant would need to interact  \nheavily with a host of native tools to accomplish this anyway. The  \ncross-platform/architecture neutral nature of Ant ends up buying very  \nlittle in a job like that.\n\nAnt will probably inch into this area over time, but it is not quite  \nthere yet.\n\n&gt;&gt; So said Timothy Wall on 4/27/2003 --------------------\n&gt;&gt; Aside from neither of these existing when they originally set up the\n&gt;&gt; build and test processes, ant is less suited than make to managing a\n&gt;&gt; large, complex project that consists of a wide range dependencies and\n&gt;&gt; tasks.  Can you imaging trying to use ant to build a VM?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; On Saturday, April 26, 2003, at 04:46 AM, javainsel wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Today I downloaded &quot;Java(TM) 2 SDK, Standard Edition (SCSL) 1.4.1&quot;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; from Sun: http://wwws.sun.com/software/java2/download.html\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; It includes the sources, tests and makefiles which are not included\n&gt;&gt;&gt; in the Java SDK 1.4.1.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; When I unpacked the archive which I&#39;ve downloaded, I discovered that\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Sun doesn&#39;t use JUnit.
