Is this intentional? I was thinking that ther=\r\ne would ultimately be only junit.jar, without the Hamcrest classes baked in=\r\n?\n\nCheers,\np\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, Marc Philipp &lt;mphilipp82@...&gt; w=\r\nrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; All,\n&gt; \n&gt; I am happy to announce the release of JUnit 4.11-beta-1=\r\n. There have been a lot of contributions by a full cast of contributors. Th=\r\nanks to everyone who took part by reporting an issue, offering his/her opin=\r\nion, or even submitting a pull request!\n&gt; \n&gt; Today, we are releasing a firs=\r\nt beta version of 4.11. The reason is simple: We want to make sure the upgr=\r\nade from Hamcrest 1.1 to 1.3 goes smoothly. Therefore, we are kindly asking=\r\n you to give it a try. If you find anything we should consider, please let =\r\nus know, either via this mailing list or directly on GitHub: https://github=\r\n.com/KentBeck/junit/issues/512\n&gt; \n&gt; As usual, you can download the JARs or =\r\nthe complete ZIP file directly from https://github.com/KentBeck/junit/downl=\r\noads. In addition, the jars\n&gt; have been submitted to Maven Central and shou=\r\nld appear there within one or two hours.\n&gt; \n&gt; You can find the preliminary =\r\nrelease notes on GitHub and copied below:\n&gt; https://github.com/KentBeck/jun=\r\nit/blob/master/doc/ReleaseNotes4.11.txt\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; \n&gt; Marc Philipp\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; Summary of changes in version 4.11 [unreleased!]\n&gt; \n&gt; Matchers: Upgrade=\r\n to Hamcrest 1.3\n&gt; \n&gt; JUnit now uses the latest version of Hamcrest. Thus, =\r\nyou can use all the available matchers and benefit from an improved assertT=\r\nhat which will now print the mismatch description from the matcher when an =\r\nassertion fails.\n&gt; \n&gt; Example\n&gt; \n&gt; assertThat(Long.valueOf(1), instanceOf(I=\r\nnteger.class));\n&gt; Old error message:\n&gt; \n&gt; Expected: an instance of java.lan=\r\ng.Integer\n&gt;      got: &lt;1L&gt;\n&gt; New error message:\n&gt; \n&gt; Expected: an instance =\r\nof java.lang.Integer\n&gt;      but: &lt;1L&gt; is a java.lang.Long\n&gt; Hamcrest&#39;s new =\r\nFeatureMatcher makes writing custom matchers that make use of custom mismat=\r\nch descriptions quite easy:\n&gt; \n&gt; @Test\n&gt; public void featureMatcher() throw=\r\ns Exception {\n&gt;     assertThat(&quot;Hello World!&quot;, length(is(0)));\n&gt; }\n&gt; \n&gt; pri=\r\nvate Matcher&lt;String&gt; length(Matcher&lt;? super Integer&gt; matcher) {\n&gt;     retur=\r\nn new FeatureMatcher&lt;String, Integer&gt;(matcher, &quot;a String of length that&quot;, &quot;=\r\nlength&quot;) {\n&gt;         @Override\n&gt;         protected Integer featureValueOf(S=\r\ntring actual) {\n&gt;             return actual.length();\n&gt;         }\n&gt;     };\n=\r\n&gt; }\n&gt; Running this test will return the following failure message:\n&gt; \n&gt; Exp=\r\nected: a String of length that is &lt;0&gt;\n&gt;      but: length was &lt;12&gt;\n&gt; Most of=\r\n the matchers in JUnitMatchers have been deprecated. Please use org.hamcres=\r\nt.CoreMatchers directly.\n&gt; \n&gt; Parameterized Tests\n&gt; \n&gt; In order to easily i=\r\ndentify the individual test cases in a Parameterized test, you may provide =\r\na name using the @Parameters annotation. This name is allowed to contain pl=\r\naceholders that are replaced at runtime:\n&gt; \n&gt; {index}: the current paramete=\r\nr index\n&gt; {0}, {1}, =85: the first, second, and so on, parameter value\n&gt; Ex=\r\nample\n&gt; \n&gt; @RunWith(Parameterized.class)\n&gt; public class FibonacciTest {\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt;     @Parameters(name =3D &quot;{index}: fib({0})=3D{1}&quot;)\n&gt;     public static I=\r\nterable&lt;Object[]&gt; data() {\n&gt;         return Arrays.asList(new Object[][] { =\r\n{ 0, 0 }, { 1, 1 }, { 2, 1 },\n&gt;                 { 3, 2 }, { 4, 3 }, { 5, 5 =\r\n}, { 6, 8 } });\n&gt;     }\n&gt; \n&gt;     private int input;\n&gt;     private int expec=\r\nted;\n&gt; \n&gt;     public FibonacciTest(int input, int expected) {\n&gt;         thi=\r\ns.input =3D input;\n&gt;         this.expected =3D expected;\n&gt;     }\n&gt; \n&gt;     @=\r\nTest\n&gt;     public void test() {\n&gt;         assertEquals(expected, Fibonacci.=\r\ncompute(input));\n&gt;     }\n&gt; }\n&gt; In the example given above, the Parameterize=\r\nd runner creates names like [1: fib(3)=3D2]. If you don&#39;t specify a name, t=\r\nhe current parameter index will be used by default.\n&gt; \n&gt; Test execution ord=\r\ner\n&gt; \n&gt; By design, JUnit does not specify the execution order of test metho=\r\nd invocations. Until now, the methods were simply invoked in the order retu=\r\nrned by the reflection API. However, using the JVM order is unwise since th=\r\ne Java platform does not specify any particular order, and in fact JDK 7 re=\r\nturns a more or less random order. Of course, well-written test code would =\r\nnot assume any order, but some does, and a predictable failure is better th=\r\nan a random failure on certain platforms.\n&gt; \n&gt; From now on, JUnit will by d=\r\nefault use a deterministic, but not predictable, order (MethodSorters.DEFAU=\r\nLT). To change the test execution order simply annotate your test class usi=\r\nng @FixMethodOrder and specify one of the available MethodSorters:\n&gt; \n&gt; @Fi=\r\nxMethodOrder(MethodSorters.JVM): Leaves the test methods in the order retur=\r\nned by the JVM. This order may vary from run to run.\n&gt; \n&gt; @FixMethodOrder(M=\r\nethodSorters.NAME_ASCENDING): Sorts the test methods by method name, in lex=\r\nicographic order.\n&gt; \n&gt; Maven artifacts\n&gt; \n&gt; Up until now there were two Mav=\r\nen artifacts for JUnit: junit:junit-dep and junit:junit. From a Maven point=\r\n-of-view only the former made sense because it did not contain the Hamcrest=\r\n classes but declared a dependency to the Hamcrest Maven artifact. The latt=\r\ner included the Hamcrest classes which was very un-Maven-like.\n&gt; \n&gt; From th=\r\nis release on, you should use junit:junit which will be what junit:junit-de=\r\np used to. If you still reference junit:junit-dep, Maven will automatically=\r\n relocate you to the new junit:junit and issue a warning for you to fix.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Rules\n&gt; \n&gt; A number of improvements have been made to Rules:\n&gt; \n&gt; Both @=\r\nRule and @ClassRule can now be used on methods that return a TestRule.\n&gt; Ex=\r\npectedException now always prints the stacktrace of the actual exception in=\r\n case of failure.\n&gt; A parent folder can be specified for TemporaryFolder. I=\r\nn addition, the newFile/newFolder methods will now fail when the file or fo=\r\nlder could not be created.\n&gt; TestWatcher has a new template method called s=\r\nkipped that is invoked when a test is skipped due to a failed assumption.\n&gt;=\r\n Improvements to Assert and Assume\n&gt; \n&gt; assertNotEquals has been added to A=\r\nssert.\n&gt; assertEquals has been overloaded in order to check whether two flo=\r\nats are equal given a certain float delta.\n&gt; Most methods in Assume now all=\r\now to pass a custom message.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message =\r\nhave been removed]\n&gt;\n\n\n\n",
