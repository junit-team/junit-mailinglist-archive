But, you used the word &quot;Agile,&quot; so,\nI\n&gt; read it and am replying.\n&gt;\n&gt; Interesting article thoughts.  Also quite &quot;high level&quot; and speculative,\n&gt; which made me wonder about some facts.\n\nYes it is, and I too am replying. I work for a large company that has\noffices in Israel, Belgium, Canada, the US, and various other locales around\nthe world. Many of these places have development teams, some of them sharing\ndevelopment tasks on the same projects. A lot of large companies that have a\nworldwide presence also have their development efforts spread out around the\nworld. Also, the Open Source movement seems to have a widespread community.\nI don&#39;t know that outsourcing is that much different with respect to\nefficiency/comminication/etc. compared to other forms of geographically\ndisparate development teams.\n\nThere are of course problems with communication/etc. - but somehow the job\nstill gets done and I haven&#39;t seen a huge mass exodus from the US of\ndevelopment jobs despite the fact that some very big names have been\npredicting such a trend for over a decade. What I wonder is, what are the\ncore objections to outsourcing? Do people object to:\n\n1) The fact that some people around the world will work for less than they\ndo? If so, get used to it - welcome to the new world. I welcome and applaud\ncompetition. When I was unemployed I actively let employers know I was\nwilling to underbid just about anybody because the alternative was being\nunemployed.\n\n2) The fact that these people may not engender the kind of loyalty we get\nfrom our employers? If so, get real; just ask any of the thousands of\nunemployed Java developers how loyal and concerned their former employers\nwere.\n\n3) Responsiblity? Concerned about the conditions in a third world country\nnot being as good as in the US? Welcome to the real world. A programmer in\nIndia is going to have better living conditions than 99% of the rest of the\npopulace, and by making a decent living wage for their locale (and probably\nthen some), they help the local economy and create other jobs by spending\nthier wages. It is a tired axiom but generally true; as the tide rises, so\ndo all boats.\n\nIf outsourcing is such a bad idea, if there are problems that make it an\neconomically stupid thing to do, then eventually companies will discover\nthat fact or fail - just as many discovered they couldn&#39;t make money by\njumping on the internet bandwagon without a sound business plan.\n\nFWIW,\nLCB\n\n\n\n",
