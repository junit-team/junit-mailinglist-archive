    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-808416410\">I need some way to run a certain test after all other tests.<br/>\n<br/>\nI run my tests in Eclipse, and do not yet have a build system outside of it. I understand that had I done this programmatically, I could have attached a RunListener, implementing the testRunFinished(Result) method.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs there any way to achieve a similar effect within the JUnit runner in Eclipse?<br/>\n<br/>\nRationale: I have actual unit tests, then bigger tests, then full-fledged &quot;integration tests&quot; or whatever one call them, where I take up my entire application-local server thingy and process a bunch of items, letting JUnit check after the dust settles whether the items was processed correctly. However, the internals are multi threaded, and also, this being a Swing app, lots of Runnables are sent over to the EDT. This is all good.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, I&#39;ve sometimes seen that a thread crashes (uncaught exception), without this being noticed by any of the tests running (I&#39;ve e.g. seen a ConcurrentModificationException take down the EDT, without having a clue as to why I got that - and the next event posted just brings up a new EDT, so I get a green bar, but with an uncaught error). What I&#39;d want to achieve, is to install an uncaught exception handler, and then, as a final step to ALL permutations of tests (e.g. both for a single unit test, and also for the project-wide test run), run a test that checks whether any thread-killing exception was caught by the handler, and if so, fails the run. (I&#39;d throw the exception that was caught, and in any case also log-dump any and all such exceptions).<br/>\n<br/>\n(As a very similar question, I&#39;d also like to have a &quot;before any tests&quot; thing, like the RunListener.testRunStarted(Description) method, where I could set up logging. Now I do that by letting ALL tests have a static block that calls a specific static method which has a static boolean that tells whether the log system already is set up. This also works just nicely, but is a hassle nevertheless. However, it is not possible, as I see it, to solve the above question in the same manner.)</div>",
