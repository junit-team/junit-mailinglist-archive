B. Rainsberger wrote:\n&gt;&gt; &gt;So said Chris Dollin on 2003-08=\r\n-04 --------------------\n&gt;&gt; &gt;We have an interface (Graph) with multiple imp=\r\nlementations (A and B).\n&gt;&gt; &gt; [Some names have been changed to avoid complic=\r\nations.] I have a test\n&gt;case\n&gt;&gt; &gt; AbstractTestGraph with an abstract method=\r\n Graph getGraph(), where the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; tests test the Graph(s) that getGraph() r=\r\neturns, and TestA/TestB define\n&gt;&gt; &gt; getGraph() to return instances of A/B a=\r\ns appropriate. So far, so good,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; and just as suggested in one of the Ju=\r\nnit documents. The code for each\n&gt;&gt; &gt; test case is nice and short.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt;Well ... I lied about A and B; it&#39;s more like A, B, C, and X. And likely\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; to be more, since Y and Z exist but may not be properly included in the=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; &gt; test suite at the moment.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;(1) How can I write a test generat=\r\nor which takes A.class, X.class etc as\n&gt;&gt; &gt;arguments and constructs the nec=\r\nessary suite?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I didn&#39;t understand this question.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; True or false:=\r\n you want to create a test suite consisting of tests for\n&gt;all\n&gt;&gt; the implem=\r\nentations of an interface. (Please answer.)\n&gt;\n&gt;Erm ... no, that&#39;s not it, q=\r\nuite. Apologies for unclear writing (perhaps,\n&gt;unclear thinking ...)\n\nIt ha=\r\nppens.\n\n&gt;I want to write a method M which given a class C which is supposed=\r\n\n&gt;to implement interface I will return a suite which runs the abstract test=\r\n\n&gt;cases ATC for I with respect to the implementation C. I happens to be\n&gt;Gr=\r\naph and the C&#39;s are implementations of Graph and there are enough\n&gt;C&#39;s that=\r\n writing out explicit subclasses of ATC for each C is a pain.\n&gt;\n&gt;This makes=\r\n it easy for the writers of the different C&#39;s to run the \n&gt;abstract test ca=\r\nses. \n\nWith the greatest love and respect, that first sentence does not app=\r\near to be English. Forget C, M, I... speak concretely and I will understand=\r\n.\n\nLet me try again.\n\nYou have an abstract test case AbstractTestGraph. The=\r\nre are a bunch of implementations (subclasses) of Graph. You want to be abl=\r\ne to generate on the fly test cases for each implementation (subclass) of G=\r\nraph.\n\n&lt;snip /&gt;\n&gt;&gt; This appears to try to build concrete test cases\n&gt;&gt; (htt=\r\np://c2.com/cgi/wiki?AbstractTestCases) on the fly given an abstract\n&gt;&gt; test=\r\n case. I have never thought of doing this before, but it makes sense.\n&gt;\n&gt;Ye=\r\ns, I thought so too. [I have a functional programming / Lisplike\n&gt;backgroun=\r\nd;\n&gt;higher-order programming comes naturally.]\n\nIf that is what you want, t=\r\nhen it shouldn&#39;t be that hard. Create a TestSuite object consisting of dyna=\r\nmic subclasses of AbstractTestGraph, each of which overrides makeGraph() to=\r\n answer its particular implementation of Graph. As I wrote, dynamic invocat=\r\nion handlers should do the job.\n\n&gt;&gt; Assuming that this is what you&#39;re tryin=\r\ng to do, then I assume you have:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;    * An abstract test case GraphTest=\r\n\n&gt;&gt;    * An interface Graph\n&gt;&gt;    * Implementations of Graph\n&gt;\n&gt;Yes [GraphT=\r\nest is called AbstractTestGraph, but what&#39;s an alpha-conversion\n&gt;between fr=\r\niends?].\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; You would like to generate a test suite consisting of XTestCa=\r\nse for each\n&gt;&gt; implementation XGraph of Graph where XTestCase creates an in=\r\nstance of\n&gt;&gt; XGraph to test.\n&gt;\n&gt;What&#39;s important is not to be able to creat=\r\ne a suite of them all (although\n&gt;that might be nice), but to be able to tri=\r\nvially able to create a suite for\n&gt;each one to be plugged into the locally =\r\nappropriate test-cases.\n\nYou want to generate code? or generate the impleme=\r\nntation at runtime?\n\n&gt;[When I say &quot;suite&quot; am I being sloppy? I really mean =\r\n&quot;a test that runs\n&gt;lots of tests&quot;.]\n\nTests don&#39;t run tests. TestRunners run=\r\n tests.\n\n&gt;&gt; This is a neat question. Let me think about this.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;So ...=\r\n am I dead-ended in the wrong alley? Missing something obvious?\n&gt;&gt; &gt;Missing=\r\n something subtle? Any advice would be welcome. If I have to\n&gt;&gt; &gt;hack junit=\r\n source code I will, but I feel that surely I don&#39;t need to\n&gt;...\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I do=\r\nn&#39;t think you are. Dynamic invocation handlers might be the order of\n&gt;&gt; the=\r\n day, or something... This seems to be easy to do in a dynamic\n&gt;language\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n like Smalltalk. :)\n&gt;\n&gt;So far as I can tell, it would be easy in Java if cl=\r\nasses nested inside\n&gt;methods\n&gt;were allowed to be public. I suspect the rest=\r\nriction was not reviewed when\n&gt;they added reflection to the official langua=\r\nge ...\n\nThey are if they are class-level (static).\n\n\nJ. B.
