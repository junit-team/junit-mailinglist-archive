JTest can load and execute all \nof your existing JUnit test classes.  It can export its automatically \ngenerated test cases into a test class.  It can also create a test \nclass template when you wish to define your own test class.\n\nIn addition to all the functionality you find in JUnit, JTest will \nautomatically generate test cases to test the construction of a class \n(assuring you that there is no unexpected input that will cause a \nmethod to throw an exception).  The tool also does static-analysis \n(automatic enforcement of best coding practices), regression testing, \ncoverage analysis (for both JUnit and Jtest generated test classes), \nand checks Design By Contract.\n\nIf anybody is interested in seeing a demo, please contact me as I \nwill be scheduling several over the next few weeks.\n\nYou can reach me at:\n\ndmccaw@...\n888-305-0041 x1209\n\nFor more info, visit http://www.parasoft.com.\n\nThanks,\nDavid McCaw\n\n\n\n",
