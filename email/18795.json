The schools that many look to for definition of<br/>\nthe standard curriculum have classes taught by academics.  Many<br/>\nsoftware academics are crack developers with excellent ideas about<br/>\nproducing quality code quickly.  Some have spent more of their life<br/>\ngetting paid to think about software than produce it.  Most have a<br/>\ncertain blindspot when it comes to TDD and unit testing in general,<br/>\nthough, I believe:<br/>\n<br/>\nIn research, it can be hard to say in advance what your code is<br/>\nsupposed to be doing.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are ways to incrementally well-tested units that contribute to<br/>\nan overall whole that is still somewhat amorphous, but it does<br/>\nrequire, to a certain extent, changing both how you think about<br/>\nresearch and software, and it&#39;s taken me a while to figure out even as<br/>\nmuch as I have.  For example, it&#39;s often worth keeping a well-tested,<br/>\nbut low-performing algorithm around at least until you can build a<br/>\nsecond algorithm that can do as well.  All that said, the number of<br/>\nlong-standing research projects with even slightly comprehensive unit<br/>\ntests is much less than a T1 person would hope.<br/>\n<br/>\n   David Saff</div>",
