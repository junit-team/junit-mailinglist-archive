Rainsberger&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jbrains@...\">jbrains@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;&gt; No, I had lost the context of the discussion. I<br/>\n&gt;&gt; would use DbUnit or the <br/>\n&gt;&gt; ORM, whichever was simpler. In your case, I&#39;d use<br/>\n&gt;&gt; the ORM.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; But, even better, I&#39;d use a fake (not a mock!) Data<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Repository layer <br/>\n&gt;&gt; when testing Business Logic without worrying about<br/>\n&gt;&gt; where in particular <br/>\n&gt;&gt; the data comes from.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I agree. But what do you tell about integration<br/>\n&gt; testing? Some bugs will never show up if only mock<br/>\n&gt; objects are used. How do you catch them? Chapter 13<br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t seem to address our needs for integration<br/>\n&gt; testing.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You only mention FIT very shortly in your book. Is<br/>\n&gt; this the ultimate solution for integration testing?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What do you think about TestNG? I see that you don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; mention it in your book.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What do you say about test dependencies? In your book<br/>\n&gt; I only found a solution for ensuring that the tests<br/>\n&gt; are executed in a special order. But what about &quot;skip<br/>\n&gt; test y if test x failed&quot;? It reminds me of our batch<br/>\n&gt; programs: run batch y (which depends on results of<br/>\n&gt; batch x) only if batch x succeeded. Is there an addon<br/>\n&gt; for this for JUnit or a small and simple solution? Or<br/>\n&gt; should it not be done? In a way I agree with the<br/>\n&gt; author of TestNG that it would be nice to see 1 test<br/>\n&gt; passed, 1 test failed, 24 tests skipped instead of 1<br/>\n&gt; test passed and 25 tests failed.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>TestNG was just an idea at the moment the book was written. From that moment we went a long way ;-).<br/>\n<br/>\nI would say that TestNG dependency features are more appropriate to integration testing. These are<br/>\nsupported by the core of TestNG so you will not need to do advanced JUnit conf stuff to emulate this<br/>\nbehavior.<br/>\nHowever without these, TestNG can fit also the unit testing scenarios.<br/>\n<br/>\n:alex |.::the_mindstorm::.|<br/>\n--<br/>\nTestNG developer</div>",
