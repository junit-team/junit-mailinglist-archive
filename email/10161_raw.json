I just want to know a few test case generators that can generate the test cases automatically for Java programs. If possible I want the list of Open sources as well.\n \n2. Can we generate the test cases automatically using JUnit. I think at least for the first time we are supposed to write the first set of test cases manually. I know to write the test cases manually but how can we generate the test cases automatically from the first set of manual ones?\n \nThanks in advance,\n \nSurya.\n\n\n---------------------------------\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
