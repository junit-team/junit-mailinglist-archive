I feel pretty <br/>\n&gt; confident about their difference. I guess the problem i had <br/>\n&gt; and perhaps other is that whereas a theory is in fact a <br/>\n&gt; universal quantification ( <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_quantification)\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_quantification)</a>. The <br/>\n&gt; problem is, while the set for each possible value is often <br/>\n&gt; indefinite, you have to be realistic and provide appropriate <br/>\n&gt; candidate data (using data parameter supplies). And that&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; when theories start to look a lot like parameterized tests, <br/>\n&gt; while in fact they are in nature very different .<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Raphael<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On Thu, Oct 23, 2008 at 1:42 PM, Joakim Ohlrogge<br/>\n&gt; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:joakim.ohlrogge@...\">joakim.ohlrogge@...</a>&gt;wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; Thanks for the clear responses. What i see is that a theory is a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (parametrized) test inside out; you don&#39;t specify what <br/>\n&gt; will work but <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; you leave out what should not be tested (iow assumptions <br/>\n&gt; by leaving <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; out the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; data<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; for these cases).<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m not sure that there is a misunderstanding here but just <br/>\n&gt; to make sure:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; While what you wrote is technically true I think it simplifies the <br/>\n&gt; &gt; theory a bit. I would consider a long list of assumptions <br/>\n&gt; in a theory <br/>\n&gt; &gt; a smell, perhaps named: &quot;assmumptions is the mother of all <br/>\n&gt; screw ups&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; :). I almost fell into the trap of using assumptions to filter the <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;desired&quot; datapoints to the &quot;correct&quot; theory but that would be a <br/>\n&gt; &gt; violation of the idea, the idea is that the datapoints I have <br/>\n&gt; &gt; specified and all other datapoints I (or an automatic tool) <br/>\n&gt; can come <br/>\n&gt; &gt; up with should pass. I think that there is a subtle difference here <br/>\n&gt; &gt; between data driven tests and theories, data driven tests <br/>\n&gt; are merely a <br/>\n&gt; &gt; convenient way to create lots of specific examples while <br/>\n&gt; theories aim <br/>\n&gt; &gt; at the abstraction, the definition of the truth in this system.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; If a lot of assumptions are a smell, then what are our <br/>\n&gt; weapons against <br/>\n&gt; &gt; them? I found that declaring types help here and it pays off <br/>\n&gt; &gt; instantly. For instance, if I represent name as a String and phone <br/>\n&gt; &gt; number as a String and it is important to my theories to <br/>\n&gt; differentiate <br/>\n&gt; &gt; between the two I could ether:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Assume that any string with numbers in it is a phone number <br/>\n&gt; and that <br/>\n&gt; &gt; anything that is not a phone number is a name.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Or, I could declare the type Name and the type PhoneNumber.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; In this case I would prefer a type.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; If I was intersted in defining what a long distance call is I could <br/>\n&gt; &gt; write that as a theory:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; @Theory<br/>\n&gt; &gt; public void makeLongDistanceCall(PhoneNumber from, <br/>\n&gt; PhoneNumber to) { <br/>\n&gt; &gt; assumeThat(from.areaCode, is(not(equalTo(to.areaCode))); <br/>\n&gt; Call call = <br/>\n&gt; &gt; new Call(from, to); assertTrue(call.isLongDistance());<br/>\n&gt; &gt; }<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I probably screwed up both the domain and the design but I hope my <br/>\n&gt; &gt; idea of what an assumptions role in a theory is and how <br/>\n&gt; theories are <br/>\n&gt; &gt; different than data-driven tests in spite of them both <br/>\n&gt; being driven by <br/>\n&gt; &gt; data.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I also hope that in the case the domain is screwed up it should be <br/>\n&gt; &gt; perfectly clear from the above theory to anyone who knows <br/>\n&gt; the domain.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Finally, I hope this helps someone :)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; /J<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  <br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; Raphael Parree<br/>\n&gt; CTO<br/>\n&gt; SOA Evangelist<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Trivera Technologies Global J2EE Education, Mentoring, <br/>\n&gt; Courseware & Consulting Services<br/>\n&gt; phone:+31 152600 448<br/>\n&gt; phone +33 683 468663<br/>\n&gt; Disclaimer...<br/>\n&gt; &quot;The information contained in this message may be <br/>\n&gt; confidential and is intended to be exclusively for the <br/>\n&gt; addressee.
