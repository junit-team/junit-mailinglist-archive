In my opinion, this isn&#39;t something that can break.  Instead I <br/>\n&gt; would test<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;the super class implementation.  On that same note, why do you even have<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;these methods here?  Are you opening up the access level (from default or<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;protected to public)?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; As someone who practises TDD  I would have written the test first, then<br/>\n&gt; implemented the derived class.

Also, if we refactor the super class because of some need of<br/>\n&gt; another derived class, we know whether we have broken any derived<br/>\n&gt; classes assumptions of how the super class works.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Are you prepared have n+1 copies of the tests for a given superclass <br/>\nmethod, one for the superclass and one for each of the n known <br/>\nsubclasses? I&#39;m not.<br/>\n<br/>\nI change the test to work with the superclass, and when (in the future) <br/>\nI change the subclass&#39;s implementation, I would test-drive the new <br/>\nbehavior, (re)creating the tests I need.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ.
