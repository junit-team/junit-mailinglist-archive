Could you be more specific?<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nStephen Smith, MEng (Wales).<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.stephen-smith.co.uk/\">http://www.stephen-smith.co.uk/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nJason Rogers wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; On 12/19/2005 03:32 AM, Ilja Preuss apparently said:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; What development tools are you using? Both Eclipse and Ant, for example,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; already have built in the feature to gather and run all the tests in a<br/>\n&gt;&gt; package/directory.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 1. We don&#39;t use Ant to run tests<br/>\n&gt; 2. reasons we don&#39;t use Eclipse&#39;s built-in functionality:<br/>\n&gt;   a. Eclipse seemed to skip some tests in the 3.0.x branch (we would <br/>\n&gt; select 1 project whose tests would number N, its dependent projects <br/>\n&gt; would weigh in at M tests.  So you would expect N + M tests to have been <br/>\n&gt; run.  Not so.  It was N + M - X tests.  I don&#39;t know where things were <br/>\n&gt; getting lost.  I noticed this because I had a test in which I was <br/>\n&gt; forcing a failure and it never failed.  Why?  It never ran.)<br/>\n&gt;   b. using JUnit-Addons we actually are able to be more selective in the <br/>\n&gt; types of tests we run through Eclipse Launchers.  We have launchers for <br/>\n&gt; Units only, Units and Database Tests, Functional Tests, and All Tests.  <br/>\n&gt; The suite is built on the fly via tests implementing specific interfaces.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
