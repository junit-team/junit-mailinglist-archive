I mirror \nNUnit 2.5 there and have several related projects hosted. NUnit\n 3.0 will be moving there. The VCS on Launchpad is bazaar.\n\nThe main attraction of Launchpad to me was their stated\ngoal of making it very easy for people to contribute to\nprojects. Anyone who wants to create a branch of a project\nin their private space on launchpad can do so and then \npropose the change for merging into the trunk. Of course,C\nthe project team has control over what they accept.\n\nWhile working on such a branch, the potential contributor\nhas all the services of a source code management system\navailable to them on their own machine and can push\nupdates to a published branch on Launchpad. Regular\ncontributors or team members can do the same thing and\nyou can use your main branch (trunk) like a centralized\nrepository if you prefer, while still having the benefits\nof a distributed system where you need it. Code review\nis integrated in the process.\n\nI&#39;m still in the stage of learning to use LP and bzr,\nand there could still be glitches, but both are under\nactive development and the underlying philosophy matches\nwhat I&#39;d like to do. I suspect it&#39;s a philosophical match\nyou as well. I spent some time searching and couldn&#39;t\nfind anything about banning any countries there.\n\nLaunchpad, btw, is sponsored by Canonical, and it&#39;s \nwhere Ubuntu is developed, so it focuses on an international\naudience and has a platform for localization as well.\n \nI suggest taking the tour at http://launchpad.net/+tour/index\nif this sounds at all interesting.\n\nCharlie\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On \n&gt; Behalf Of David Saff\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, December 09, 2008 11:07 AM\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: Re: [junit] Would JUnit moving to Subversion and/or \n&gt; Google Code have consequences for you?\n&gt; \n&gt; Actually, it appears that JUnit has already been somewhat \n&gt; blocked from Cuba:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SourceForge#Banned_countries\n&gt; \n&gt; So now we have three variables to control:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) Code review ease\n&gt; 2) Source control ease\n&gt; 3) Worldwide access\n&gt; \n&gt; Does anyone know for sure if there&#39;s a hosting solution that \n&gt; scores 100% on Worldwide Access?  Does anyone know what the \n&gt; restrictions involve?  (I wonder if it&#39;s something to do with \n&gt; SSL connections from countries to which, theoretically, you \n&gt; can&#39;t export SSL-enabling technology, or couldn&#39;t at one \n&gt; point--I&#39;m very rusty on this).\n&gt; \n&gt; It appears that if we allow browsing the documentation and \n&gt; downloading through junit.org, and other services through \n&gt; Google Code, we&#39;d be offering the same level of worldwide \n&gt; access we are now.  Is that true?\n&gt; \n&gt;    David Saff\n&gt; \n&gt; On Tue, Dec 9, 2008 at 12:45 PM, kentb &lt;kentb@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;   Very interesting. That doesn&#39;t align with my values. Still, David \n&gt; &gt; and I would like a less-synchronous-but-still-connected style of \n&gt; &gt; development. For that we need good code review tools. \n&gt; Google Code provides those in spades.\n&gt; &gt; Is there something equivalent for Git?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Cheers,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Kent Beck\n&gt; &gt; Three Rivers Institute\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; _____\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; From: junit@yahoogroups.com &lt;junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt; [mailto:\n&gt; &gt; junit@yahoogroups.com &lt;junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt;] On Behalf \n&gt; Of Lothar \n&gt; &gt; Kimmeringer\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Tuesday, December 09, 2008 1:48 AM\n&gt; &gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com &lt;junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [junit] Would JUnit moving to Subversion and/or Google \n&gt; &gt; Code have consequences for you?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; kentb schrieb:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; We are considering moving to Google Code (and thus \n&gt; Subversion) for \n&gt; &gt; &gt; its superior code review features. However, before doing so we&#39;d \n&gt; &gt; &gt; like to know who else would be affected by such a change. If a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; project you run would\n&gt; &gt; be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; affected, please let us know.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Google Code denies access from restricted countries.
