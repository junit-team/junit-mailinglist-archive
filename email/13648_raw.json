(which was Allen&#39;s original question if I&#39;m not mistaken)\n\nThen I would think about splitting the test class in many test classes.\nGroup test cases around a common setup.\n\n&gt; For example, imagine that the class to test does some verification on\n&gt; an XML file.  In this case, the one-time set up should simply parse the\n&gt; XML file, create the DOM tree and then use the class to perform various\n&gt; verifications on this tree.  And of course, we don&#39;t want to re-parse\n&gt; it every time.\n\nHold on a second -- what do you want to test, an XML /file/ or the \nrepresentation in memory? If you test the transformation from file to \nobjects in memory, you probably want to parse again in each test with \nslightly different XML input.\n\nIf you don&#39;t want to test the XML to object mapping, then why bother with \nXML at all in the test? Just create a bunch of objects to play with and \nskip the XML part.\n\n&gt; I can come up with a lot of examples where such a fine grained (or\n&gt; coarse grained, in this case) setUp/tearDown life cycle is necessary\n&gt; without the tests being dependent on each other.\n\nPlease give an example where it does affect your test results if the setup \ncode runs for each test and where you still claim that the tests are \nindependent.\n\nCheers,\n\nRobert\n\n",
