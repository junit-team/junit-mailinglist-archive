Like the text runner, but\n&gt; generates HTML.  Obviously, this is implemented by the ANT tasks but,\n&gt; since we use a make build, this isnt terribly useful to me.  Its\n&gt; prototype code at the moment, but it works.  Ive implemented\n&gt; TestListener.  My columns currently include:\n&gt;\n&gt; - Test name\n&gt; - Output (with stderr coloured differently to stdout)\n&gt; - Problem (ie. Exception or Assert)\n&gt; - Time\n&gt; - Memory delta\n&gt;\n&gt; I use Velocity to do the formatting and stick some summary data at the\n&gt; top.\n&gt;\n&gt; Has anyone else done one of these?  Is anyone else interested?  Should\n&gt; I publish the code?\n\nSure, publish it in the Files section of the group.  If anyone is truly \ninterested they will grab it.  I would suggest putting it in some \narchive format (jar/zip, tar, etc.) with whatever documentation is \nneeded to get one up and running.  Make sure to include the version \nnumbers of 3rd party libs you are using.\n\n-- \nJason Rogers\n\n&quot;I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I,\nbut Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in\nthe flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved\nme, and gave himself for me.&quot;\n    Galatians 2:20\n\n\n",
