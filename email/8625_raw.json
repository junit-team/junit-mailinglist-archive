I actually purchased the ebook through Manning&#39;s MEAP program \nlast night and read the first chapter. Well done so far! I especially like the logical way \nyou demonstrate the value of JUnit over old-style (non-framework) unit testing \nmethods. This is great, convincing stuff for someone new to JUnit and good ammo for \nanyone trying to convince management to invest more heavily in up-front testing. I&#39;m \nlooking forward to reading subsequent chapters as they are published.\n\nI do have one sematic, nitpicky gripe. In several places, unit testing is referred to as a \n&quot;new&quot; testing strategy. Wouldn&#39;t it be better to refer to Test Driven Development as \nthe &quot;new&quot; strategy? Unit testing has been around for quite some time, but TDD is \n(arguably) a new strategy.\n\n-TJ\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Vincent Massol&quot; &lt;vmassol@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m happy to announce that my JUnit in Action book is now available\n&gt; through the Manning Early Access Programme (MEAP). This means that you\n&gt; can subscribe to it and get the chapters in PDF format as they are\n&gt; published (first chapter is already published, 2 others will be\n&gt; published tomorrow and other chapters will be posted at a rate of 1 per\n&gt; week).\n&gt; \n&gt; More information about the book and MEAP is available at\n&gt; http://www.manning.com/massol/\n&gt; \n&gt; Here&#39;s some information about the book (taken from the book&#39;s\n&gt; back-cover):\n&gt; \n&gt; Developers in the know are switching to a new testing strategy - unit\n&gt; testing - which interleaves coding and testing in an integrated way.\n&gt; This has proven to be a powerful combination that results in better\n&gt; designed software with fewer defects and faster delivery cycles. \n&gt; \n&gt; JUnit in Action shows you how to benefit from this strategy using the\n&gt; popular open source testing framework, JUnit. It&#39;s a no fluff discussion\n&gt; of unit testing techniques and best practices. It gives examples of\n&gt; tough situations such as how to unit test EJBs, database applications,\n&gt; JSPs and Taglibs. It discusses unit testing of J2EE applications, and\n&gt; shows how to test in automated builds.\n&gt; \n&gt; What&#39;s Inside:\n&gt; - Unit testing best practices\n&gt; - Testing in isolation with mock objects \n&gt; - In-container testing with Cactus \n&gt; - Automated builds with Ant and Maven \n&gt; - Unit testing from within Eclipse \n&gt; - Test Driven Development principles \n&gt; - Unit testing \n&gt;   - Java apps \n&gt;   - Servlets \n&gt;   - JSP \n&gt;   - Taglibs \n&gt;   - Filters \n&gt;   - EJB \n&gt;   - DB apps\n&gt; \n&gt; Note that the book can also pre-ordered from Amazon\n&gt; (http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1930110995/\nqid=1057695644\n&gt; /sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_1/104-1481474-9343103?v=glance&s=books&n=507846).\n&gt; \n&gt; Feel free to ask any question.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks\n&gt; -Vincent\n\n\n",
