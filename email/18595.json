It is about design.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is value, though, in generating JUnit tests both for people who<br/>\nare not able or not willing to do TDD. We (Agitar) have been working<br/>\non this problem and have an experimental version of our test<br/>\ngeneration engine available at www.junitfactory.com. There is a free<br/>\ndemo online and I can get an invitation for anyone who would like to<br/>\ntry it for real in Eclipse.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is primarily designed for people who do not do TDD but we,<br/>\ninternally, find it a useful complement to cover the cases that TDD<br/>\nmisses or to bring legacy code under test in the way that Michael<br/>\nFeathers describes in Working Effectively with Legacy Code.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKevin<br/>\n<br/>\nwww.junitfactory.com<br/>\nYou send us code. We send you tests.</div>",
