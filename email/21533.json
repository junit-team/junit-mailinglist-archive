Do you mean perhaps that you&#39;d like to<br/>\n&gt; specify dependencies between tests; i.e. if test A fails, then don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; bother running tests B, C, D and E?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Could you try to re-state the problem that you&#39;re trying to solve so<br/>\n&gt; that we can have a better understanding and give you a more accurate<br/>\n&gt; answer?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Cheers,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; James<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I am so sorry. My English is very poor, so I can just try to make myself understood a little better. <br/>\nOK,let&#39;s test the following codes with junit4.<br/>\n1.<br/>\n@Test(expected = NullPointerException.class)<br/>\npublic void f1(){<br/>\nString s = null;<br/>\nSystem.out.println(s.length());<br/>\n}<br/>\nIf I run f1(), the result will be that junit4 test runs without Exceptions or Errors, because the test f1() obtains its expected Exception. Can you follow me here?<br/>\n<br/>\n2.<br/>\n@Test<br/>\npublic void f2(){<br/>\nString s = null;<br/>\nSystem.out.println(s.length());<br/>\n}<br/>\nIf I run f2(), the result will be that junit4 test runs with an Exception called NullPointerException, which is not expected. If you can&#39;t understand what I say here, I have to learn English harder.<br/>\n<br/>\n3.<br/>\n@Test(expected = NullPointerException.class)<br/>\npublic void f3(){<br/>\nString s = null;<br/>\nSystem.out.println(s.length());<br/>\n}<br/>\nThe content in f3() is the same as in f1(), so if I run f3(), the result is the same as f1().<br/>\n<br/>\n4.<br/>\n@Test<br/>\npublic void g(){<br/>\n  f1();<br/>\n  f3();<br/>\n}<br/>\nI want to use f1() test and f3() test in g(), because the test&#39;s result of f1() and of f3() above is that it runs without Exceptions or Errors. So I(not junit4&#39;s @test) expected if I run g(), the result is that it runs without Exceptions or Errors too. Can you follow me here? But the mechanism of junit4 does not like I expected. When I run g(), the actual result is that it runs with an Exception called NullPointerException.<br/>\n  If I wanna immplement the function I expected above, what shall I do? Why I wanna the function? Because I wanna use reflect machanism to simplify the whole test in our project.<br/>\n  If you can&#39;t follow me above, I set an additional example as follows:<br/>\n5.  <br/>\n@Test<br/>\npublic void g1(){<br/>\n  f1();<br/>\n  f2();<br/>\n}<br/>\nIf I run g1(), the result I expected is that it runs with the NullPointerException. Because the result in test f2() is that it runs with the NullPointerException. And because the result in test f1() is that it runs without any Exception, so the result in g1() is that it runs with the NullPointerException, and the NullPointerException causes by f2().<br/>\nThat&#39;s what I wanna do. If you haven&#39;t understand, I can just say very very sorry. I have try my best.</div>",
