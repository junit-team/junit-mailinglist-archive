Or they are\n&gt; treated the same way as static methods.\n\nJUnit doesn&#39;t know what method you&#39;re testing, so I suppose the answer \nto your question is &quot;no&quot;. I don&#39;t really understand the question, \nthough, so I can&#39;t be any surer.\n\n&gt; Here is the reason why I asked this question. After reading this article\n&gt; (below). It is rather &quot;back to basics&quot; but sometimes I find it useful to go\n&gt; to &quot;root&quot;\n\nThis article, while cute, takes a long time to say something /very/ \nsimple: make all methods static unless the compiler says they can&#39;t be \nstatic. If you want to make a method instance-level that can be \nclass-level, then you&#39;re probably hardcoding something that will \neventually, through some refactoring, become stored in a field.\n\nTake care.\n-- \nJ.
