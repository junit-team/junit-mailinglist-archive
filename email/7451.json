(So far my <br/>\n&gt; code is a small fraction of the download, so this<br/>\n&gt; isn&#39;t an issue - yet)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There are alternatives to &quot;embedded&quot; code (if you mean<br/>\nwhat I think you mean, using inner classes to test).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Another comment:<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve been trying to get started with the unit<br/>\n&gt; testing and have been <br/>\n&gt; encouraging other&#39;s in my company to try it too, but<br/>\n&gt; I can&#39;t get any <br/>\n&gt; buy-in. I&#39;m finding it difficult to get started so I<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t really have <br/>\n&gt; a convincing argument for it other than &quot;I&#39;ve read<br/>\n&gt; that it is a great <br/>\n&gt; thing&quot; :), obviously if I can make it work for me it<br/>\n&gt; would help.   It&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; good to hear that others have had the same issues<br/>\n&gt; and have gotten past <br/>\n&gt; them.   The examples make it look so simple and<br/>\n&gt; easy...<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I felt the same way a while back, about XP in general<br/>\nand unit testing specifically.  I gave up trying to<br/>\nconvince others by talk.  At that point it WAS just<br/>\nsomething good I&#39;d heard about.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, nearly a year later I actually practice (as much<br/>\nas is possible) TDD and unit test first.  Now it is<br/>\nnot just something good I&#39;ve read about, but I can<br/>\ntell my coworkers of actual benefit that comes from<br/>\nit.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne concrete case is with some installation code that<br/>\nme and several other members of our team have written.<br/>\n I&#39;ve found ways to refactor the code to be nearly<br/>\n100% unit tested and now the test cycles take about 3<br/>\nseconds whenever there is a change instead of a couple<br/>\nof hours (time spent actually installing the OS,<br/>\nmanually hitting buttons, testing upgrade paths, etc,<br/>\netc).  My coworkers who have been through the pain of<br/>\ndoing it the other way see the wisdom of unit testing<br/>\nwhen I show them the time and effort saved.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I&#39;m saying that once you have been doing it<br/>\nfor a while, you will know how to inform them of the<br/>\nbenefits in ways that actually will make sense to them<br/>\nand that you can back up with cold, hard, data.   But<br/>\nfirst you need to get &quot;test-infected&quot; yourself, and<br/>\nthat requires a bit of discipline and time trying<br/>\nthings out.  (it doesn&#39;t take long though, since the<br/>\nbenefits are very very real).<br/>\n<br/>\n- Jeff Tulley<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
