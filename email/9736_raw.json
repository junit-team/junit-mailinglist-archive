This is then hand-checked to make sure \nits good.  This is being referred to as the &quot;Golden Master&quot; technique.\n\nI then write a test that generates the report using the same test \ndata, and then assert that the generated output is the same as the \ngolden master.  For me, this means a byte level comparison of the \ngenerated PDF file, which works just fine.\n\nThis is really a &quot;change detector&quot; style of test that lets me know \nwhen my output format changes.  When I actually want it to change, \nits just a matter of recreating the &quot;golden master&quot; report again.\n\nWhy would I bother doing this?  So we can change the code base, \nconfigurations, etc., without worrying that there&#39;s an accidental \neffect on the final reports.   \n\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;J. B.
