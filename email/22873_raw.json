They ha=\r\nve to manually select to use the new version that has just appeared in the =\r\nrepo, and this way if their tests start failing, they will know that they c=\r\nan either fix them to work with the new version of junit, or revert to the =\r\nprevious version.\n&gt;\n&gt; Interesting. =A0I was under the impression that it wa=\r\ns possible to\n&gt; simply depend on the _latest_ version of a package--indeed,=\r\n that the\n&gt; ability to get upgraded versions automatically was one of the\n&gt;=\r\n benefits/risks of maven. =A0Perhaps I&#39;ve just learned something new.\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n=A0 David Saff\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I am considering of taking up on this task with push=\r\ning junit to the public Maven repo, but I have to first learn what is exact=\r\nly the process for this (perhaps signing up at Apache as contributor, or sm=\r\nt).\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Bogdan\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; --- In junit@yahoogroups.com, David Saff &lt;david@...&gt;=\r\n wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; On Tue, Aug 17, 2010 at 6:28 PM, pniederw &lt;pniederw@...&gt; wr=\r\note:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve noticed that JUnit includes an (outdated) version of Hamcre=\r\nst.
