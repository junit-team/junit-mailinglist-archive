Know your tools, and know your IDE.  IDEs like Eclipse and IntelliJ=\r\n make it very easy to generate an interface from an existing class or vice =\r\nversa.  I do not see any problems using Interfaces where it makes sense. =\r\n=20\r\n\r\n=20\r\n\r\nI remember situations where the development manager demanded that all meth=\r\nods are private except the few that the client is supposed to use.  That de=\r\nmand together with the dislike of Interfaces then asked for usage of JUnit =\r\nextensions like Junitx (I think that is the name) which allow to test priva=\r\nte methods (or to write my own reflection method retrieval for testing the =\r\nprivats).  Using Interfaces in that case would have improved the whole situ=\r\nation.\r\n\r\n=20\r\n\r\nAndreas\r\n\r\n=20\r\n\r\n=20\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\n\r\nFrom: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of El=\r\nliotte Harold\r\nSent: Wednesday, August 16, 2006 7:59 AM\r\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\r\nSubject: Re: [junit] Test-friendly, but not caller-friendly?\r\n\r\n=20\r\n\r\nAndreas Guther wrote:\r\n&gt; There is always the possibility to define your API with Interfaces and t=\r\nhus have it as user friendly as possible without exposing any additional me=\r\nthods that were written in the actual implementation for the purpose of tes=\r\nting the class.\r\n&gt;=20\r\n\r\nYUCK! That&#39;s like making your tech support user friendly by outsourcing=20\r\nit to trained professionasl in India rather than letting your clients=20\r\ntalk directly to the developers. There&#39;s a ton of theory (i.e.=20\r\nrationalizations) to support doing that, and it&#39;s completely=20\r\ncounterproductive in practice.\r\n\r\nInterfaces are very popular among the most theoretical programmers: i.e.=\r\n=20\r\nexactly the sort of programmers who are likely to write books, read=20\r\nbooks about OO theory, and hang out on lists like this one. However in=20\r\nmy experience concrete classes are much simpler and much preferred by=20\r\nthe vast majority of pragmatic programmers just getting their jobs done.\r\n\r\nI can certainly see how making a class test-friendly could make it less=20\r\ncaller-friendly. In fact, exactly how to do that is the subject of=20\r\nanother perma-thread on this list. exposing methods purely for the=20\r\nconvenience of testers expands a class&#39;s interface and makes it harder=20\r\nto learn, use, and understand. Minimal interfaces are simpler to=20\r\nunderstand and learn. Exposing additional methods purely for test=20\r\nconvenience is very counter-productive to caller-convenience. The only=20\r\npublic parts of a class&#39;s interface should be things that are relevant=20\r\nto client programmers.\r\n\r\n--=20\r\n=EF=BB=BFElliotte Rusty Harold elharo@... &lt;mailto:elharo%40met=\r\nalab.unc.edu&gt;=20\r\nJava I/O 2nd Edition Just Published!\r\nhttp://www.cafeaulait.org/books/javaio2/ &lt;http://www.cafeaulait.org/books/=\r\njavaio2/&gt;=20\r\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=3D0596527500/ref=3Dnosim/cafeaulait=\r\nA/ &lt;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=3D0596527500/ref=3Dnosim/cafeaul=\r\naitA/&gt;=20\r\n\r\n=20\r\n\r\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n\n\n",
