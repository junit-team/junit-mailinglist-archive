These days every piece of java\nsnippet I write has a test attached to it :).\n\nI was wondering why there are no assertNotEquals and assertThrows methods in\nthe Assert class. I have needed something like this many times in my\ntesting, and have had to fall back to doing assertFalse(a.equals(b)) and a\nsequence of try-catch-fail, respectively.\n\nassertNotEquals seems trivial to me, and assertThrows, in my thougths would\ntake the exception being expected, or default to Exception.\n\nJust wondering if these have come up before, and what the thoughts on them\nare. If needed, I can try coding them up and get on the developer list.\n\nThanks,\n- Nitay.\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n\n\n",
