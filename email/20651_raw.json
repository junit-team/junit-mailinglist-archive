A precondition for us is that we do\nnot want to override/extend any internal classes of JUnit. We would like\nto do it the &quot;official&quot; way. Sadly I could not find any documentaion on\nthis topic. The only documentation I found was the Javadoc for Sorter\nand Filter.\nMy question is whether there is any best practice for this kind of\nfunctionality. When I previously asked a similar question on this list I\ngot the hint that TestNG does exactly what we need. However TestNG is no\noption for us and we want to or have to use JUnit.\nIn the meantime I developed a testsuite that runs with an extended\nVersion of Parameterized.class and supports the usage of Filter and\nSorter based on the current the current parameter value. I tried to only\nuse official non-internal APIs of JUnit. I am eager to know whether I\nhave the same understanding of how to extend JUnit than the other people\non the list..\n\nYou can find Eclipse projects with my experimental testsuite here:\nhttp://sourceforge.net/tracker/download.php?group_id=15278&atid=115278&f&#92;\nile_id=283395&aid=2008607\n \n&lt;http://sourceforge.net/tracker/download.php?group_id=15278&atid=115278&&#92;\nfile_id=283395&aid=2008607%20&gt;\nBest Regards,\nRobin de Silva Jayasinghe\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
