Examples <br/>\n    &gt; include open <br/>\n    &gt; source applications or products where the source code is <br/>\n    &gt; the primary <br/>\n    &gt; deliverable (e.g. frameworks).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>But Mike, don&#39;t you think this is a different beast altogether?  OpenSource<br/>\nshould have the tests included because it fully expects the user to change<br/>\nthe code.  If the user is responsible about maintaining the tests then it<br/>\nmakes it easier for the progenitor(s) of the project accept changes to the<br/>\nbase code.  At least in a somewhat perfect world... :D<br/>\n<br/>\n-Jason</div>",
