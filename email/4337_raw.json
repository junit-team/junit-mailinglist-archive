For instance, it seems to me that we could catch these\n&gt; errors instead of letting them fall through and stop the execution of the\n&gt; application.\n\n\nThank you for volonteering :-)\n\nIt is (IMHO) wrong to catch these errors. The goal of the application is \nto run _all_ the tests, and not only those who could be successfully \nloaded.  The developer must know that some of his/her tests couldn&#39;t be \nexecuted because of a linkage error.\n\n-Vladimir\n-- \nVladimir Bossicard\nwww.bossicard.com\n\n\n",
