This means that you\ncan subscribe to it and get the chapters in PDF format as they are\npublished (first chapter is already published, 2 others will be\npublished tomorrow and other chapters will be posted at a rate of 1 per\nweek).\n\nMore information about the book and MEAP is available at\nhttp://www.manning.com/massol/\n\nHere&#39;s some information about the book (taken from the book&#39;s\nback-cover):\n\nDevelopers in the know are switching to a new testing strategy - unit\ntesting - which interleaves coding and testing in an integrated way.\nThis has proven to be a powerful combination that results in better\ndesigned software with fewer defects and faster delivery cycles. \n\nJUnit in Action shows you how to benefit from this strategy using the\npopular open source testing framework, JUnit. It&#39;s a no fluff discussion\nof unit testing techniques and best practices. It gives examples of\ntough situations such as how to unit test EJBs, database applications,\nJSPs and Taglibs. It discusses unit testing of J2EE applications, and\nshows how to test in automated builds.\n\nWhat&#39;s Inside:\n- Unit testing best practices\n- Testing in isolation with mock objects \n- In-container testing with Cactus \n- Automated builds with Ant and Maven \n- Unit testing from within Eclipse \n- Test Driven Development principles \n- Unit testing \n  - Java apps \n  - Servlets \n  - JSP \n  - Taglibs \n  - Filters \n  - EJB \n  - DB apps\n\nNote that the book can also pre-ordered from Amazon\n(http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1930110995/qid=1057695644\n/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_1/104-1481474-9343103?v=glance&s=books&n=507846).\n\nFeel free to ask any question.\n\nThanks\n-Vincent\n\n\n",
