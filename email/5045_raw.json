Only counterpoint I see is that when you crash the\nentire JVM (thus app server) the bug will be fixed with much higher priority\nbecause you&#39;ll have management over you. Not sur it&#39;s a win ;)\n\nNeither of you ever experiences a server halt that could have been avoided\nby simply catching some throwables?. I did. Wrongly installed library on one\non the app servers in a cluster. Only that little rarely used feature didn&#39;t\nwork. We got an alert, fixed it, and here we go. You think it&#39;s preferable\nto get the entire JVM to exit? No talking about a JVM serving one client\nhere. A lot of clients on the same machine. It would be like you have a CGI\nthat crashes leading to a stop of the entire apache server.\n\nI&#39;m surprised I&#39;m the only one doing that sort of stuff.
