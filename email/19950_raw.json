For method that the values are not defined until running as random, or takes time like  schedule (should we write a test for method is scheduled to run within 1 hours). Applying above two rules, we can abstract the library code and use Mock object to have &#39;Evident data&#39;, we focus to test our business code not what library assume to do (we think random, schedule do the good job already - some cases, library does not do like expected but detecting it is another story).\n\nRegards,\nHai\nhttp://www.haiphucnguyen.net/blog/\n\n&quot;J.

I think of randomness as generating a \n stream of numbers, so depend on &quot;a stream of numbers&quot; rather than a \n &quot;random number generator&quot;. Then, in production, use a &quot;random number \n generator&quot; implementation of the &quot;stream of numbers&quot;. It&#39;ll just work.\n -- \n J. B.
