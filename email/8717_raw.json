Server starts, then clients each start \nand interact with the server and make assertions on the response from \nserver.\n\n\nI know about Ant with parallel task or batch job.  I know about \nActiveTestSuite and JUnitPref but they seems to run tests in different \nthreads but same JVM.\n\nI&#39;d like to do this from ONE TestCase since that seems like a nicer \nsolution than Ant parallel task.  e.g my TestClientServer  would spawn \na server in a different VM and also spawn as many clients as I want \neach in its own VM and then once all client(s) test methods are done, \nthe TestClientServer tears down.\n\n\nIs there a way to do this.\n\n\nthanks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
