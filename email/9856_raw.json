Beginning with 0 Junit tests in=\r\n place, we had the choice of writing pure unit tests or approaching it at a=\r\n higher level.  In the interest of time, we chose to write at the same leve=\r\nl that internal consumers and external customers would be doing, beginning =\r\nwith the APIs projected as being the &#39;most used&#39;.  In a perfect world, we w=\r\nould &quot;do it all&quot; but given time and resource constraints we went for the mo=\r\nst &#39;bang for the buck&#39; in this product cycle.  While this wasn&#39;t intended t=\r\no be a total replacement for pure unit tests, in theory if you cover all th=\r\ne exposed API&#39;s and their permutations of arguments, you are testing everyt=\r\nhing that can be reached by external means (we&#39;re not there yet, nor close =\r\n:).  Coupling this strategy with Continuous Integration using Cruise Contro=\r\nl where the tests are run upon every code/testware push to cvs has greatly =\r\nimproved\nconfidence in product stability, not to mention that it has caught=\r\n numerous bugs the moment they were introduced.\n\nSo, I see your strategy as=\r\n very pragmatic but would also encourage in a secondary thread the developm=\r\nent of pure unit tests, possibly beginning with new classes as they are cre=\r\nated.\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: jlindwall [mailto:jlindwall@xifin.c=\r\nom] \nSent: Wednesday, November 12, 2003 5:59 PM\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nS=\r\nubject: [junit] Stop me from being bad: Functional testing w/junit OK?\n\n\nIs=\r\n it against the laws of nature to do something more then unit \ntesting with=\r\n junit?\n\nI have a heirarchy of objects that implement a common interface (a=\r\nn \nSPI if you will).  Each object has a &quot;normal&quot; life cycle that \nconsists =\r\nof the following methods being called: beginFile(), print(), \nendFile().  T=\r\nhe result of these calls is a file generated on disk.\n\nI guess that this is=\r\n not unit testing because I&#39;m not testing a \nsingle method&#39;s actions.  I wa=\r\nnt to call this sequence of methods and \nthen compare the generated files t=\r\no golden masters.\n\nFURTHERMORE, I&#39;d like to use reflection to perform these=\r\n steps on \neach class in the heirarchy so it will automatically test new \ni=\r\nmplementations as they are added to the tree.\n\nIs it inappropriate to use j=\r\nunit in this way?  Is there a better way?\n\nThanks!\n\n\n----------------------=\r\n-- Yahoo!
