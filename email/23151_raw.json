When I asked=\r\n for &quot;more modern license&quot; I did not know how close I was. Proliferation of=\r\n various open source licenses is bad and I am glad upgrading to EPL1.0 is a=\r\nllowed by CPL1.0. It can safe a lot of troubles.\n\nNow, when it is clear tha=\r\nt EPL1.0 is the natural evolution step, I can offer some help. Kent mention=\r\ned that he has no capacity to change the license himself. I can help changi=\r\nng all the JUnit sources and create a patch. The rest would be just a matte=\r\nr of incorporating my changes into main source line and releasing binaries =\r\nfor under the new license...\n\nShall we walk this path?\n-jt\n\n[1] The license=\r\n would rather be called CPL1.1 if &quot;the superceeding&quot; was the plan from begi=\r\nning...\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;milestravisparker&quot; &lt;milesparker@...=\r\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; The following posts might be helpful..\n&gt; \n&gt; http://dev.eclipse=\r\n.org/blogs/mike/2009/04/16/one-small-step-towards-reducing-license-prolifer=\r\nation/\n&gt; http://forums.pentaho.com/showthread.php?69944-License-upgrade-fro=\r\nm-CPL-to-EPL\n&gt; \n&gt; IANAL either but the section 7 language does appear to gi=\r\nve any contributor the right to release under a successor license, and EPL =\r\nis a successor.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hope you guys can get it sorted out!\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In junit=\r\n@yahoogroups.com, Kent Beck &lt;kentb@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Dear Jaroslav,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Thank you for the message. It is not practical to change the license for J=\r\nUnit because of the difficult of identifying and notifying contributors.
