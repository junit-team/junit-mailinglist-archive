But it does make me feel the <br/>\npain of overly coupled, hard-to-test code that causes me to go look for a <br/>\nbetter solution.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I have improved my test-first skills, I have learned to use that pain as <br/>\na signal.  Why does testing this code hurt so much?  It could be because <br/>\nI&#39;m stupid and need a coffee break, but it&#39;s probably because my code has a <br/>\nproblem and I need to find a better way.  I think about it for a bit, and <br/>\nif I don&#39;t come up with a solution, I hunt around for ideas in a book <br/>\nwritten by someone who knows more than I do, or I ask a list with a lot of <br/>\npeople on it who know more than I do.  I learn something and the pain goes <br/>\naway.  Now I have some new techniques for eliminating &quot;file-angst&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for all of the great feedback :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 06:50 PM 5/1/2002 -0700, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; Notice, everyone, how the test tool suggested a change that makes this<br/>\n&gt; &gt; class more generally useful. Hmmmm.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Well, not exactly: One solution (&quot;a directory full of a bunch of xml<br/>\n&gt;catalog file variations becomes more readable and understandable than a<br/>\n&gt;bunch of code.&quot;) didn&#39;t require any change to the code and is seen as a<br/>\n&gt;better solution.  The tool&#39;s suggestion was I think not that obvious.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;If it was so obvious, why did David take the time to ask the question to<br/>\n&gt;the group?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I think that you still need some experience to smell the refactoring.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-Vladimir<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>David Olivier<br/>\nNaval Research Laboratory<br/>\nDigital Mapping, Charting & Geodesy Analysis Program<br/>\nCode 7440.2</div>",
