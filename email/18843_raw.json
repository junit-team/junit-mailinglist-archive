The solution I had was to turn the\nprivate met=\r\nhods to protected.\n\nOn 2/8/07, Michael Feathers &lt;mfeathers@...&gt; =\r\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; So there once was a doctor. A patient came to him and said &quot;Do=\r\nc, I have\n&gt; these recurring headaches.&quot; His response was &quot;Well, Tylenol wor=\r\nks.&quot;\n&gt; The patient went off with the doctor&#39;s advice and, sure enough, his\n=\r\n&gt; headaches went away for a while.. but eventually the patient had to come\n=\r\n&gt; back to the doctor for something far worse.\n&gt;\n&gt; The desire to test privat=\r\ne method is not something that you should\n&gt; ignore, it&#39;s an indication that=\r\n something else is wrong. Using\n&gt; reflection to get at them is kind of like=\r\n taking Tylenol without asking\n&gt; what else could be wrong.\n&gt;\n&gt; Good design =\r\nis easily testable. If you can&#39;t write test without special\n&gt; tricks, it&#39;s =\r\ntime to go back to your design and ask: do I really have\n&gt; good cohesion? O=\r\nr, why is my coupling so bad that testing is hard.\n&gt;\n&gt; Michael Feathers\n&gt; w=\r\nww.objectmentor.com\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been re=\r\nmoved]\n\n\n",
