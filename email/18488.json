I&#39;ll try to be fair to your<br/>\npoints--this is not something that I feel is immensely important to<br/>\nget agreement on, but I&#39;m hoping to help those who haven&#39;t tried<br/>\nassertThat to get a feeling for it&#39;s power, perhaps just enough of a<br/>\nglimpse that they&#39;ll try it, and see how it goes.  (Any apostate<br/>\nassertThat users out there?  Tried it, hated it, gone back?)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 11/30/06, Jeff Langr &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jeff@...\">jeff@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; The main benefit of literate programming that I gather from reading<br/>\n&gt; earlier messages is that it makes the error messages easier to read.<br/>\n&gt; Given this example:<br/>\n&gt;     assert(that(n).greaterThan(2).and().that(n).lessThan(10))<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, I don&#39;t believe that there&#39;s a framework currently in existence<br/>\nthat looks like that (am I wrong?)  Second, as I&#39;ve said elsewhere, I<br/>\nthink this is not a useful example.  I find that I end up with very<br/>\nfew tests that actually want to say<br/>\n<br/>\nassertTrue( 2 &lt; n && n &lt; 10, &quot;n should be inside the (2, 10) interval&quot;);<br/>\n<br/>\nwhether I&#39;m using assertThat or not.  Do you?<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; it seems to me to be at the expense of the readability of the tests<br/>\n&gt; (in some cases), and also likely at the expense of amount of effort<br/>\n&gt; required to code the tests.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs an aside, I find that<br/>\n<br/>\nassertThat(x, eq(5));<br/>\n<br/>\nrolls off the fingers just as nicely as<br/>\n<br/>\nassertEquals(5, x);<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; For me, the answer is that my tests don&#39;t fail often enough to warrant<br/>\n&gt; that extra expense. Since I&#39;m doing TDD, assertions generally fail<br/>\n&gt; once, maybe a few times, during development. And while I&#39;m developing,<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m pretty familiar with what the test failures mean. But after that,<br/>\n&gt; failing tests are pretty rare, and I want them to be. So, I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; usually bother with assertion failure messages.<br/>\n<br/>\nOut of true curiosity, to what extent is this because you&#39;re already<br/>\nusing the built-in assertion failure sugar in assertEquals?<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom experience, I find that:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) I like using JUnit for my long-running user tests, too, in which<br/>\ncase having enough information to debug in the first error message is<br/>\nindeed useful.<br/>\n2) Just as I find that the pressure to make my classes testable<br/>\nresults in designs that appeal to me, regardless of testability, I<br/>\nfind that assertThat pressures me to create designs that have easily<br/>\nasserted-on values.  For example, where before I might have written:<br/>\n<br/>\nassertTrue(process.finished() && process.returnValue() == 0),<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m more likely to write (partially _because_ of the clunkiness of the<br/>\nconstraint syntax):<br/>\n<br/>\nassertThat(process.status(), eq(Process.SUCCESSFUL_RETURN));<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, I&#39;ve found a new class, ProcessStatus, that proves useful in<br/>\nrendering progress bars and info logs.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn general, I hope that everyone has an internal list of things they<br/>\nhaven&#39;t tried yet, aren&#39;t sure about, but are hoping to try someday.<br/>\nAnd I&#39;m hoping to get assertThat on a few more of those lists.  That&#39;s<br/>\nmy only ulterior motive here.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n   David Saff </span></blockquote></div>",
