It&#39;s free and\na lot of the technology behind it was inspired by the=\r\n research done at\nMIT by the people you mention in some of the other links =\r\n(Dr. Mike\nErnst and his students at MIT&#39;s CSAIL).  I am very interested in =\r\nyour\nresearch in applying automated test generation to legacy code. It&#39;s a\n=\r\nvery tough problem because a lot of legacy code was not written with\ntestab=\r\nility in mind (manual or automated) and something I am also\nworking on (ano=\r\nther thing we have in common besides our first name :-)).\n\n\nAlberto\n\n\n\n\n",
