I don&#39;t see how that&#39;s \npossible, since &quot;this&quot; cannot be null. I read on. I found out that the \nbug is that some other code in this class assumes that this.type is not \nnull, and because someone was permitted to invoke _setType(null), there \nis a problem.\n\nI disagree.\n\nThe bug is in whatever code invoked _setType(null). Possibly, the real \nbug is in providing a way to change this property after object creation \nin the first place.\n\nI strongly doubt the programming error was not testing the setter; it \nwas not testing the code that tried to use it.\n\nIf we /do/ want to make the property writable and publish that API for \nanyone to use, then it might be worth programming more defensively, but \nin this case, the property isn&#39;t even directly writable, which makes me \nbelieve even more strongly that the bug is not in the setter. After \nreading your article more closely, the bug was in the non-trivial public \nsetType() method and not in the private and trivial _setType() method. A \nmethod like setType() that does data checks is certainly not Too Simple \nto Break and I would definitely test it.\n\nBased on that, I feel your argument is of the bait-and-switch kind: you \noffer up the _setType() example as code that should be tested, but \njustify it by concluding that setType() is the method really ought to be \ntested. This might be harsh, but that reasoning just doesn&#39;t work.\n\nOf course, this is just one man&#39;s opinion, and I&#39;m writing this more for \nthe audience than in any hope of changing your mind. I&#39;m OK with the \nfact that we have different thresholds for &quot;Too Simple to Break&quot;. I&#39;m \nnot OK with faulty reasoning.\n\nTake care.\n-- \nJ. B.
