I am <br/>\nrunning several .class tests in my suite() and I would like to have <br/>\nsome flexibility as far as running different subsets of tests. I have <br/>\ncreated a &quot;TestClient&quot; with a main that collects command line <br/>\narguments to know what subset of parametrized tests to run. I&#39;d also <br/>\nlike to include &quot;levels&quot; of testing. Basically, I&#39;d like to be able <br/>\nto run certain sets of tests based on a command line parameter. <br/>\neg.) java TestClient &lt;-detailed | -normal | -brief &gt; <br/>\nThe only option I can seem to think of is to have the suite add tests <br/>\nby methodName and do so conditionally (based on a static global <br/>\nvariable). <br/>\n<br/>\nif(detailed){<br/>\n   suite.addTest(newTestClient(&quot;testItemA&quot;)) <br/>\n}<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem with this is that I&#39;d have to list every single <br/>\ntestMethod for the test. Instead, I&#39;d like to add the tests to the <br/>\nsuite as .class files and use any another approach. Can anyone think <br/>\nof anything? Any suggestions out there? <br/>\nThanks!<br/>\nClaudio</div>",
