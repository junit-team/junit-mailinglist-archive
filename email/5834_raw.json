Price. Starting at US$125 for a Developer License, Clover is ALOT \ncheaper than its competitors. Return On Investment is a no-brainer - \nif Clover helps you find and fix one bug that otherwise would have \nmade it into production, its easily paid for itself.\n\n2. Ant integration. Because Clover plays nicely with Ant, it can be \nintegrated into your projects build scripts and run automatically, as \npart of a continuous integration effort. \n\n3. Reporting. Clover reporting is the most accurate because we parse \nyour source to produce them. This differentiates us from byte-code or \nJDPA based tools that are not always accurate in mapping back to the \nsource. Reports can be produced in XML or HTML, and (in Version 1.1, \ncoming soon) in PDF. Version 1.1 will also provide summary historical \nreporting over the lifetime of your project - Something that pointy \nheaded manager types will love to look at.\n\n4. Container friendliness. Clover will happily work with applications \nrunning inside an Application Container (eg. a J2EE server). Clover \ndoesn&#39;t care what VM you use either (as long as its 1.3 or greater).\n\nAs Scott points out, Clover uses Source-code instrumentation. This \nmeans you need to do a coverage build to measure coverage. So this \nmeans Clover isn&#39;t for everyone. As a Java Development shop, we have \ndeliberately written Clover with developers in mind.\n\nCheers,\n-Brendan\n  \n----\nBrendan Humphreys\nLead Developer\nClover Development Team\nhttp://www.thecortex.net/clover\n\n--- In junit@y..., Scott Vachalek &lt;svachalek@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; You are right, the source/object approach is one\n&gt; difference.  Another is that GJTK can separate data by\n&gt; test, it&#39;s up to you whether that&#39;s important or not. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Some of the other features like runtime performance\n&gt; are more significant if you also collect coverage at\n&gt; higher levels, integration and systems level testing. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; To be honest I don&#39;t know that there would be much of\n&gt; a speed difference compared to another\n&gt; instrumentation-based solution like Clover, but the\n&gt; differences are dramatic compared to the JPDA-based\n&gt; tools.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m not in sales so I guess I&#39;ll leave it at that.  \n&gt; ;-)  Both tools are readily available for download so\n&gt; it&#39;s not hard to try them out and see which works\n&gt; better for you.\n&gt; \n&gt; Scott\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- Eytan Faverman &lt;shmaytan@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Andy,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; thanks for the info. Clover does seem pretty solid.\n&gt; &gt; Wondering how it\n&gt; &gt; compares with http://www.testersedge.com/gjtk/.\n&gt; &gt; Seems the main\n&gt; &gt; difference is that one instruments the byte code\n&gt; &gt; while the other\n&gt; &gt; instuments the source (since speed of testing is not\n&gt; &gt; a huge concern\n&gt; &gt; does it really even matter?).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thanks,\n&gt; &gt; -Eytan\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In junit@y..., &lt;andrew.beacock@n...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Eytan,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; You could try Clover, I have been using the\n&gt; &gt; 0.6beta a bit and it seems \n&gt; &gt; &gt; to give clear results.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Haven&#39;t tried the 1.0eval yet though.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Their website is quite good, explains what it is\n&gt; &gt; all about, and gives \n&gt; &gt; &gt; some example outputs for common open-source\n&gt; &gt; software.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.thecortex.net/clover/\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Andy.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Andrew Beacock\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Principal Software Engineer\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Nokia\n&gt; &gt; &gt; NMP/MSW/SSP/MMS\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; Yahoo!
