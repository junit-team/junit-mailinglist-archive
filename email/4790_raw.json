JUnit instantiates new object of TestCase for \nevery method=\r\n (when TestSuite.addTestCase(=85) is called), which results \nin a) a lot of=\r\n objects being newed, and b) setUp() and tearDown() \nmethods called every t=\r\nime test method is invoked. During my work with \nAPI testing I notices that=\r\n a) it is more modular to write one test \nclass per one tested class, where=\r\n test class includes multiple test \nmethods; In this case I need to instant=\r\niate app container (which \nwould be set up) only once, before I start runni=\r\nng multiple test \nclasses. Objects created in &quot;set up&quot; are shared by test c=\r\nlasses, and \ndon&#39;t need to be created every time test method is called. I \n=\r\nunderstand that decision to instantiate TestClass for every test \nmethod wa=\r\ns stipulated by some rational of design, I am trying to \nunderstand what th=\r\nis rational is?\n\n\n\n\n\n",
