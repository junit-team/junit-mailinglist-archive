You might be able to use a bytecode<br/>\n&gt; generation tool like jMock with CGLib to create mocks of classes,<br/>\n&gt; though it&#39;s almost always easier to build off an interface.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is going to be a problem for me. There is not direct interface<br/>\nfor the third party library. I have thought of direct inheritance but<br/>\nnot sure if it is a good idea. Using JMock and CGLib for bytecode<br/>\ngeneration required some time to implement. Unfortunately, I don&#39;t<br/>\nhave the time now. Probably after my tight deadline then I will look<br/>\ninto it. Could you elaborate a little bit how you would approach this<br/>\nproblem using JMock and CGLib?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe good news is I am using Spring Framework in my application. I<br/>\ncould use dependency injection to inject the third party classs into<br/>\nmy class. If I don&#39;t have the interface for the third party, Spring<br/>\nwould still inject the implementation class for me using CGLib instead<br/>\nof dynamic proxy, right?<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you for your help and the book information.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards,<br/>\nLee</div>",
