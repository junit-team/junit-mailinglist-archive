As a very concrete example of this problem, I \n&gt; can see great\n&gt; benefits in using parameterised tests (more on that in \n&gt; another mail) but\n&gt; I could easily want to use them in conjunction with\n&gt; @BeforeClass/@AfterClass (whether another &quot;level&quot; of setup/teardown,\n&gt; taking place after all the tests for a particular parameter \n&gt; set would be\n&gt; good or not is an open question in my mind). Additionally, I can see\n&gt; there potentially being other extensions which I&#39;d want to use in\n&gt; conjunction with each other.\n&gt; \n&gt; I can&#39;t see a neat way round this without being prescriptive about the\n&gt; kinds of extensions which are available (at which point you \n&gt; could chain\n&gt; certain types together - introspectors which found or removed possible\n&gt; tests, for example). I thought I&#39;d raise it as a concern though. (I\n&gt; admit I&#39;m less concerned than I was before I saw that @Before, @After,\n&gt; expected exceptions and timed tests are all handled by \n&gt; TestMethodRunner\n&gt; rather than TestClassRunner.)\n&gt; \n&gt; Any thoughts?\n&gt; \n&gt; Jon Skeet\n&gt; Senior Software Engineer\n&gt; CLEARSWIFT\n&gt; The MIMEsweeper Company\n&gt; \n&gt; DDI:               +44 (0) 1189  038  109\n&gt; Mobile:           +44 (0) 7970 158 865\n&gt; Switchboard:   +44 (0) 1189  038  903 \n&gt; Fax:               +44 (0) 1189  039  000      \n&gt; Web: www.clearswift.com \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Clearswift monitors, controls and protects all its messaging \n&gt; traffic in compliance with its corporate email policy using \n&gt; Clearswift products.\n&gt; Find out more about Clearswift, its solutions and services at \n&gt; http://www.clearswift.com\n&gt; \n&gt; This communication is confidential and may contain privileged \n&gt; information intended solely for the named addressee(s).
