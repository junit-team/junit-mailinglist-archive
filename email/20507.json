They have all been to a TDD<br/>\n&gt; course but for a variety of reasons didn&#39;t learn enough to pick up the<br/>\n&gt; habit. The developers all think that TDD is a worthy idea but don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; know enough to practice it day to day.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To make this worthwhile I think we need a more interesting example<br/>\n&gt; than the typical factorial example and a location that encourages<br/>\n&gt; pairing. I could start with the team&#39;s existing code and tasks but I<br/>\n&gt; think we would spend a lot of time on non-trivial edge cases without<br/>\n&gt; really hitting TDD. Instead I think I will offer to pair with people<br/>\n&gt; to tackle these problems.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m looking for any and all ideas, but have some specific questions:<br/>\n&gt; - What example would you use? Brian Marick had mentioned one:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.exampler\">http://www.exampler</a> .com/blog/ 2007/06/26/ a-workbook- for-practicing- test-driven- design-draft/<br/>\n&gt; but the downloads are broken.<br/>\n&gt; - Do you have an example that would demonstrate any of these difficult<br/>\n&gt; issues: abstracting the database, test driving bits of the GUI?<br/>\n&gt; - Do you have good examples to help demonstrate Test Driven<br/>\n&gt; Refactoring aka Michael Feathers and Legacy code.<br/>\n&gt; - Would you go off site? They don&#39;t have a team room yet.<br/>\n&gt; - Would a boardroom setup work well to encourage pairing?<br/>\n&gt; - How long would you make the session? Half day? Full day?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What would you do?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\nI would ask the team whether they want to work on a real feature in <br/>\norder to learn TDD. If they do, then iteration 1 is building something <br/>\nsimple that runs in memory and focuses on the mechanics of TDD and a <br/>\nfew of the early hiccups. Start with something that involves a handful <br/>\nof objects working together. I use an example in my &quot;Architecture <br/>\nWithout Trying&quot; demo that shows MVC/MVP emerging without my pushing in <br/>\nthat direction, but simply by paying attention to duplication and <br/>\nnames. The entire demo takes maybe 2 hours.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter they practice for a while, I offer to spend an hour doing the <br/>\nsame demo, but Presenter-First style, designing the Model and View <br/>\ninterfaces, usually using a dynamic mock framework. This takes about <br/>\nan hour.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I would definitely expect to take an entire day. If you can <br/>\nidentify a small feature that involves displaying data from a model, <br/>\nthen you can do Architecture Without Trying and it might really <br/>\nimpress them.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn between the demos, ask them to TDD something--anything --and check <br/>\nin with them every 40 minutes or so. By letting them choose, they get <br/>\nto learn what they need to learn at the moment they need it. After 40 <br/>\nminutes, spend 10 minutes answering questions or sharing tips and <br/>\ntricks related to observations you made about their progress: common <br/>\nquestions, that kind of thing. Then give them a 10-minute break. <br/>\nRepeat this hour as much as needed.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for offsite/onsite, do whatever it takes to give them room to be <br/>\ncomfortable, space to work in pairs, and have a whiteboard or <br/>\nflipchart handy.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope that helps you.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care.<br/>\n----<br/>\nJ.
