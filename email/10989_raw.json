(There are many texts on cyclomatic complexity but in short it&#39;s basically the number of loops/branches in a method + 1.)  \n\nThat is, a function with no branches can be covered in one test, with a single branch you need two tests (true path and false path) and so on.  For loops, consider the case of &quot;loop entered&quot; vs &quot;loop never entered&quot;.  The basic idea is that this should give you more or less 100% coverage by most metrics, and without basic coverage you can&#39;t have fully tested a method.  (The reverse is not true; you can have 100% coverage without fully testing.)\n\nAs far as I know, the science behind code coverage hasn&#39;t quite caught up to the world of exceptions and objects: stack unwinding and polymorphism add all kinds of hidden branches so in many cases the complexity is a gross underestimate.  On the other hand, as Mr. Chappell mentioned, a single method may often be too small a unit to properly test.  On the whole though, I think getting code coverage is a good goal and a measurable one, and complexity is often a fair enough estimate while you are writing tests.\n\nScott\n\n\n----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Girish Patil \n  To: junit@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Sunday, May 09, 2004 1:34 AM\n  Subject: [junit] JUnit GuideLines\n\n\n  Hi\n  This is regarding the JUnit Test classes \n  Is there any guidline available for How many test\n  classes/test methods one should write for Testing\n  methods\n  For EG \n  For method \n  myMethod(String st1,Object ob1,Object ob1){\n  ..\n  }\n\n  I can write test methods with Different combinations\n  like passing null string ,valid string ,null object\n  ob1\n  etc...\n\n  is there any guideline on this ?\n\n\n  Regards\n  Girish\n\n\n        \n              \n  __________________________________\n  Do you Yahoo!?\n  Win a $20,000 Career Makeover at Yahoo!
