You are correct and in fact I did write my\nown test runner. After a=\r\n little more playing (after I\nsent the previous email) I figured it out. My=\r\n problem\nwas this... I am dynamically creating the classes with\nmy own cust=\r\nom loader. The primary reason is partly\nwhat the junit faq/docs say about i=\r\nts own custom\nloader use being a problem, and that is, my testcase\nclasses =\r\nand 3rd party libraries are not on the\napplication classpath. Because of th=\r\nis, I need a way\nto add various URL locations to my custom loader, such\nas =\r\nthe compiled classes output of testcases and\nlocations of any 3rd party lib=\r\nraries the tests may\nuse, such as jfcUnit, httpUnit, and junit. Junit is on=\r\n\nour main application classpath, but the others are\nnot.\n\nMy harness actual=\r\nly runs embedded in the application\nbeing tested (at least for the UI side)=\r\n, so that you\ncan run an individual testcase right from the UI. This\nis esp=\r\necially helpful for developers who write unit\ntests and/or GUI automation t=\r\nests that want to test\ntheir functional area as they work. Having to drop\nd=\r\nown and run ant and try to specify a specific test to\nrun is a pain in the =\r\narse, especially when you have\nhundreds or thousands of them over a period =\r\nof time.\n\nSo because my classes are loaded dynamicaly AND the\nselected meth=\r\nod to execute is also dynamic, I was\nhaving trouble using junit to get the =\r\nresult set of\nthe test run. I want to get something similar to the\njunit ou=\r\ntput that in ant you can generate xml/html\nfrom and see a nice web report.\n=\r\n\nThe solution, as I found out was\nTestSuite.createTest(Class clazz, String\n=\r\nmethodNameToExecute);\n\nVery nice they already had that in place. So after a=\r\n\ncouple hours, I was able to get a TestResult back and\npurposely fail some =\r\ntests and see that in the test\nresult. I am quite the happy camper this wee=\r\nkend. I\nthought it was going to take me a long time to get all\nthis working=\r\n.\n\nOriginally my harness was not based on anything, not\neven junit. But I f=\r\nigured I want the least common\ndenominator, JUnit in this case, so that I C=\r\nan atleast\nutilize existing unit tests that our developers have\nalready don=\r\ne, as well as allow for the UI automation\ntestcases and a little later http=\r\nUnit automation\ntesting as well, all runnable from the one harness in\nan ea=\r\nsy to use GUI. While tests run the harness will\nupdate the status of each t=\r\nestcase (or possibly wait\nuntil they are all done to reduce hindering test =\r\nrun\nperformance).\n\n\nThanks again.\n\n\n\n--- Russell Gold &lt;russgold@...&gt; =\r\nwrote:\n\n&gt; On Sat, 20 Nov 2004 01:09:12 -0000,\n&gt; supreme_java_guru_1\n&gt; &lt;supr=\r\neme_java_guru_1@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hi all,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I am worki=\r\nng on a GUI test harness that will run\n&gt; GUI tests, unit tests\n&gt; &gt; and http=\r\n tests. Long story short, the GUI harness\n&gt; helps in building\n&gt; &gt; test suit=\r\nes. Part of this harness is allowing the\n&gt; user to add new\n&gt; &gt; testcases in=\r\n a graphical tree, define the class\n&gt; name, and the methods\n&gt; &gt; of the clas=\r\ns. All of this is embeddable within\n&gt; existing applications,\n&gt; &gt; such as a =\r\nSwing GUI app to allow a developer to\n&gt; quickly assemble and\n&gt; &gt; execute in=\r\ndividual tests without having to drop to\n&gt; the command line.\n&gt; &gt; All of thi=\r\ns works presently. My one BIG problem is\n&gt; trying to get the\n&gt; &gt; test resul=\r\nts from the test cases that are ran, so\n&gt; that I can embed\n&gt; &gt; something si=\r\nmilar to the &lt;junitreport&gt; task that\n&gt; ant has. After a\n&gt; &gt; single test, or=\r\n a group of tests run, I want my\n&gt; harness to show the\n&gt; &gt; output.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n My initial thought was that I did not have to\n&gt; execute a junit TestCase\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; through the junit run(TestResult) method.\n&gt; Basically, I was hoping I\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; could somehow get the assertXxx() output directly.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Essentially yo=\r\nu are looking at writing your own test\n&gt; runner. You can\n&gt; look at numerous=\r\n examples of this - look at how ant\n&gt; implements the\n&gt; junit task, look at =\r\nthe open source project JUnitEE\n&gt; or the\n&gt; JUnitServlet included with HttpU=\r\nnit - all are\n&gt; examples of custom test\n&gt; runners which can produce their r=\r\nesults as xml.\n&gt; \n\n\n\n            \n__________________________________ \nDo yo=\r\nu Yahoo!? \nThe all-new My Yahoo! - Get yours free! \nhttp://my.yahoo.com \n\n\n=\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYahoo!
