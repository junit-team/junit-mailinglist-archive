This book by Gamma/Kent seems to have a lot of<br/>\nanswers, at first glance. There is nothing like getting the answers<br/>\nfrom the source. It was written for Eclipse 2.1.1, does anybody know<br/>\nif an updated version for Eclipse 3.0 is planned in the near future?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks - Doris</div>",
