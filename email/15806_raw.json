Then how to write an accurate assertion. Do we have to\n&gt; understand the origin method? If so, then what&#39;s the difference between\n&gt; testers and developers?\n\nTo write assertions, you need to understand what the method should do. \nYou need to understand the results to expect. You do not need to \nunderstand how those results happen.\n\nIn many agile teams, the separation between programmer and tester \nbecomes very small over time.\n\n&gt; I&#39;ve read some samples of junit. They are easy to think out an\n&gt; assertion.\n&gt; \n&gt; But for most methods, how can we decide whether write an assertion with\n&gt; the original method or assertTrue(/assertFalse)?\n&gt; Please give me some help on writing the assertion.\n\nI imagine you need to write assertions for a specific method in your \nsystem. Think about that method. I claim it works. How do you check my \nclaim? What do you look for? Imagine you can do anything you want to \ntest it, what would you do?\n-- \nJ. B.
