The production code gets used in many <br/>\npaths, and I decided the asserts in it would be to &quot;generic&quot; to help.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Also, I&#39;ll mention another idea, although it may be anathema to this <br/>\n&gt;list.  If you can somehow DETECT the failure, put a breakpoint in your <br/>\n&gt;application (System.in or something to that effect), and then fire up <br/>\n&gt;your debugger and inspect the state of everything.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I know that many people on this list (and Dave Astel&#39;s in his fine book) <br/>\n&gt;say you shouldn&#39;t need the debugger if you TDD intensively enough.  I <br/>\n&gt;myself am unfortunately not to that level yet, and I often find it <br/>\n&gt;useful to fire up the debugger.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Whatever approach you use, I think the general idea is to gradually <br/>\n&gt;narrow down the scope of the unknown failure until you can see what is <br/>\n&gt;the root cause.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s certainly the cause.  The problem is that I only see it once a <br/>\nday or so, so narrowing it down may take a while.  I was hoping <br/>\n(originally) that runing it &quot;a lot&quot;, under &quot;random conditions&quot; might <br/>\nmake it show itself more than once a day.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;Hope this helps,<br/>\n&gt;Chad<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;David Corbin wrote:<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Prefectly reasonable suggestion.  I&#39;ll give it a try. For some reason, I <br/>\n&gt;&gt;don&#39;t think of asserts outside my tests.

Whatever the failure is, keep adding asserts about <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;anything you can think of regarding the expected state of the app and <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;objects under test.  Even (especially?) add ones for things you may <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;think are obviously working correctly.  This may give you some clues to <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the problem.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;David Corbin wrote:<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;        <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I&#39;ve got one tests which fails sporadically, and I cannot figure out any <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;reason for it to be non-deterministic in MY code.  I&#39;ve added some <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;logging statements, but It&#39;s hard to get to fail.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;            <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Yahoo!
