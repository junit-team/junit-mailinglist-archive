As runners can&#39;t be composed, it\n&gt; should be handled at the root like @Ig=\r\nnored\n\nBut Rules can be composed.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; assertEquals& =A0IDE integration: a=\r\nn additional static assert method\n&gt;&gt; (when we change the built-in assertEqu=\r\nals, it breaks tests that have\n&gt;&gt; been running fine for years. =A0This tend=\r\ns to cause Bad Days for already\n&gt;&gt; over-worked people. =A0A separate static=\r\n method is an easy way for\n&gt;&gt; people to opt-in to the new behavior)\n&gt;\n&gt; thi=\r\ns doesn&#39;t make sense for me at all.\n&gt;\n&gt; First who will call Assert.assertEq=\r\nuals in some cases and\n&gt; SomeUtils.assertEquals in other cases?\n&gt;\n&gt; Second,=\r\n I&#39;m quite sure that changing\n&gt; =A0 failNotEquals(message, expected, actual=\r\n);\n&gt; to\n&gt; =A0 throw new ComparisonFailure(cleanMessage, String.valueOf(expe=\r\ncted),\n&gt; String.valueOf(actual));\n&gt;\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t have the drawbacks you descr=\r\nibe. Even better it would align the\n&gt; code to what is currently done for St=\r\nrings.\n\nChanging AssertionFailedException to AssertError as part of the\nupg=\r\nrade from JUnit 3 to JUnit 4 internally to Google broke dozens of\ntest suit=\r\nes.  People write custom assertion packages, and then write\ntests for those=\r\n packages.  I&#39;m quite sure that this change would have\na similar effect, mu=\r\nltiplied by a much wider user base.  It would be\nodd to me to assert both t=\r\nhat this change is so useful, it&#39;s worth the\npotential breakage, but so use=\r\nless, no one would be willing to change\ntheir static imports to use it.\n\nIf=\r\n we were to make this available in junit-contrib, we could see how\nwide its=\r\n usage was, and then have data to add to the discussion, not\njust the force=\r\n of our convictions.\n\n&gt;&gt; Most interesting is ParallelRunner. =A0From your d=\r\nescription, this\n&gt;&gt; appears to be a Runner that exposes the work already la=\r\ntent in the\n&gt;&gt; ParallelComputer class and others. =A0It would be interestin=\r\ng if you had\n&gt;&gt; to make any changes to the existing classes in order to pro=\r\nduce this\n&gt;&gt; new Runner without duplication.\n&gt;\n&gt; just make the anonymous Ru=\r\nnnerScheduler in ParallelComputer.parallelize\n&gt; reusable and it&#39;s done.\n\nI&#39;=\r\nd welcome a patch to do this.\n\n&gt; This was my last email on this subject. Th=\r\nis is clear to me that you are\n&gt; not interested in what I propose. I&#39;m not =\r\nreally surprised as it\n&gt; confirms the experience made by others in the past=\r\n. This is sad because\n&gt; I still think that a lot of JUnit users would love =\r\nimprovements but at\n&gt; the end, it is your decision.\n\nMarc,\n\nI invited you t=\r\no submit your ideas to the same process that everyone\nelse&#39;s ideas are eval=\r\nuated.  You responded that responsiveness in that\narena was lacking.  I spe=\r\nnt a long time thinking about that, and sent\na long response entitled &quot;JUni=\r\nt issue responsiveness&quot;, where I tried\nto directly discuss the &quot;experience =\r\nmade by others in the past&quot;, and\nmy plans for improving it.  I have invited=\r\n you to contribute to those\nplans.  I have, in total, spent several hours a=\r\nddressing these ideas\nof yours, at no cost to yourself, not even the time i=\r\nt would have\ntaken you to copy and paste your ideas over to github.\n\nEvery =\r\naddition into the core JUnit jar has a cost, as well as a\nbenefit, to futur=\r\ne maintainers, extenders, and users.  At this point,\nI do not think that ch=\r\nanging to a model in which someone mails five\none-line ideas to a mailing l=\r\nist, and I simply say &quot;sure, I&#39;ll accept\nall of those patches if you write =\r\nthem&quot; would be beneficial to\neveryone involved.  Please, try to convince me=\r\n otherwise, ideally over\nat the thread &quot;JUnit issue responsiveness&quot;, so I c=\r\nan learn from your\nexperiences.\n\nI&#39;m sorry if this does not appear to you t=\r\no be &quot;interest&quot;.  I truly\nhope that you, or other interested users, can par=\r\ntner with me to take\nJUnit forward, and welcome your contributions in the f=\r\nuture.\n\n   David Saff\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; Marc.\n&gt; --\n&gt; HtmlUnit support & consul=\r\nting from the source\n&gt; Blog: http://mguillem.wordpress.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --------=\r\n----------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
