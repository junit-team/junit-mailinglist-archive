I have been playing around with aggressive use of the <br/>\nCommons-Collections classes &quot;Closure&quot; and &quot;Transformer&quot; to help me with <br/>\nthat. They are essentially blocks of code. I can use a combination of <br/>\nEasyMock and these two interfaces to swap arbitrary blocks of code, <br/>\nallowing me to write one tests that verifies that bigMethod() invokes <br/>\neverything in the right sequence.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow a block of code is really just some method on some collaborating <br/>\nclass that you haven&#39;t yet identified. Consider someCode()... is there <br/>\nan object that should provide that method? If so, create it and change <br/>\nbigMethod() to collaborate with it. Change bigMethod()&#39;s class so that <br/>\nit accepts an instance of this new class through a constructor <br/>\nparameters or a set method. (Change the existing constructor so that it <br/>\nprovides the &quot;real&quot; implementation of someCode() by default).<br/>\n<br/>\nNow your &quot;overall test&quot; for bigMethod() and substitute an empty <br/>\nimplementation of someCode() -- one that only says &quot;Someone invoked <br/>\nme!&quot;-- so that whatever someCode()&#39;s behavior, it doesn&#39;t get in the <br/>\nway. Now your test passes if bigMethod() invokes someCode(). :)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a complicated thing, and I really should write it up better as a <br/>\ntest-related refactoring. I can&#39;t right now, because I have work to do. <br/>\nSoon. I&#39;ll come back to it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you get the idea, then run with it, and if you don&#39;t... well, I tried.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ.
