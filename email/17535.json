The alternative to TDD is code that is not repeatably testable.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Therefore I consider TDD to be a minimum professional standard.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Developers who do not use TDD fall below that standard.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I can&#39;t quite agree with that, but I would be thrilled to wake up one<br/>\n&gt; morning to find out that it&#39;s true.
