There are many reasons why I need it in a<br/>\n&gt; different directory.  Also to change the production code just to<br/>\n&gt; satisfy unit testing doesn&#39;t sound so good.  There is a reason why we<br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t want to make it public.  So do you know of any graceful way of<br/>\n&gt; doing this besides a and b?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I read and understood your limitations.  The fact of the matter is the JVM is<br/>\nspecifically design not to allow access to package-protected classes in other<br/>\npackages.  So I&#39;m offering the best advice I have given that constraint.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the way, organizing the test classes in the same packages doesn&#39;t mean the<br/>\nsource code has to be in the same directory.  I use a parallel (mirrored)<br/>\ndirectory structure to avoid lumping everything in the same directory.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome have offered reflection as an alternative to (a) and (b) above, as<br/>\nwell.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Doctor, it hurts when I put my code and its tests in different packages, and<br/>\nthen try to test non-public methods.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMike<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nMike Clark<br/>\nClarkware Consulting, Inc.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.clarkware.com\">http://www.clarkware.com</a><br/>\n720.851.2014</div>",
