The last project I was on applied many of the XP \npractices (test first,\nunit testing).\n\nWhen designing our classes, we would write tests (contracts) \nverifiying the functionality\nof our classes.  If one practices this approach when developing, what \nadditional benefit \ndo assertions bring to the table?\n\nThis is the example I have been using:\n\nSay we have a Math class with a sqrt routine.  We want to make it \nclear to the outside\nworld that our routine does not handle negative numbers.  If I were \nto write this class\ntoday using standard Java mechanisms for argument checking, the \nmethod would look \nsomething like this:\n\npublic float sqrt(float number) {\n\tif (number &lt; 0) {\n\t   throw IllegalArgumentException(&quot;Number can not be \nnegative.&quot;);\n\t}\n}\n\nIf we were to make this a precondition (ala Design By Contract) the \nassertion would look\nsomething like:\n\npublic float sqrt(float number) {\n\tassert number &lt; 0 : &quot;Number can not be negative.&quot;;\n}\n\nWhats the difference?  Is one better then the other?\n\nHow is the &#39;assert&#39; keyword affecting the code people are writing?\n\nJonathan\n\n\n\n\n",
