In other \n&gt; words, I don&#39;t want to deploy the bean and it&#39;s home/remote/local \n&gt; interfaces. Not yet anyway. I wanted to first test the underlying \n&gt; code. Once that is working, then I&#39;ll test the remote invocation of \n&gt; this code.\n\nConsider the EJB as a plumbing layer that you need in order to get\nyour code to run in the context of the app server.  That is, write as\nmuch code as you can outside the bean, and have the bean be a\nfacade/delegate  for the purposes of the app server... just like a\nSwing GUI should be a plumbing layer/facade/delegate for the purposes\nof a human user.\n\nDave\n\nJB.. how&#39;d I do? :-)\n\n\n\n",
