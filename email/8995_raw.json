I looked over all of the emails and none of =\r\nthem mentioned it was noise - or even implied that it was nothing more than=\r\n noise. The only thing that came close was a conversation that traffic was =\r\nheavier then normal and some other email questions may have slipped through=\r\n the cracks.\n\tYou can&#39;t jump into a group ready to find insult and slight a=\r\nround the nearest corner just because not everyone agrees with your positio=\r\nn. If you are looking for a junit advocacy group then this group probably i=\r\nsn&#39;t it - this is more of a discussion and help/best-practices type of grou=\r\np. Are there disagreements among list-members, of course - do they discuss =\r\nthem openly, of course - do the members dig for the smallest believed insul=\r\nt, no we are all adults here and understand that email is not the perfect m=\r\nedium for discussions and intent is often masked behind the words.\n\n\nChip\n-=\r\n----\nProgramming: Its not just a job - its an indenture \n\n\n-----Original Me=\r\nssage-----\nFrom: Adam Jack [mailto:ajack@...]\nSent: Friday, Augus=\r\nt 01, 2003 4:48 PM\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: Sorry for the noise .=\r\n.. (was RE: [junit] ClasspathWalker (even\nbetter))\n\n\n\n\t&gt; I bet it&#39;s related=\r\n to a phenomenon I&#39;ve been struck by the past day or\nso:\n\t&gt;\n\t&gt; There have b=\r\neen so many posts to this email group between now and\nyesterday that I dele=\r\nted a bunch without reading them.\n\t&gt; Others may have done the same.  \tNot t=\r\no mention we&#39;ve had one original\nthread spawn into at least 3 other threads=\r\n,\n\t&gt; which have been responsible for most of the traffic.\n\nI&#39;m sorry for wh=\r\nat you consider noise. I guess I got involved in the\ndiscussion, I thought =\r\nit was (at times) useful. Since it was my first\nposting (and heck, I was th=\r\nrottled by moderation) how was I to know that you\ndidn&#39;t want discuss on th=\r\ne list.\n\n\t&gt; I&#39;d suggest some folks should think more between posts or take =\r\na\ndiscussion offline until things are resolved,\n\t&gt; then come back with a su=\r\nmmary.  But this is so unusual for this list\n(thinking over the past few ye=\r\nars),\n\t&gt; it will probably return to normal soon by themselves.\n\nI&#39;d like to=\r\n think I&#39;ve been thinking, but hmm ... let me think about that\nsome more ..=\r\n. Yup, I&#39;m pretty sure I was. You judge so harshly yet you admit\nyou delete=\r\nd much of what was there. Couldn&#39;t you have just kept on deleting\nand kept =\r\nthis to yourself? No, I guess you want a quiet mailing list. Ok,\nyou win --=\r\n I&#39;m done.\n\nEvery other OSS list I know says discuss here, not in private, =\r\nthe\ndiscussion is part of the process & best archived for reference. Clearl=\r\ny the\nmain two noise producers failed to come to a summary, so observation =\r\nby\nother was needed. A bunch of folks jumped in with what I considered\ninte=\r\nresting perspectives, I was grateful for that, even if to you viewed it\nas =\r\nmore noise.\n\n&gt;\t+1\n\n-1 -- but hey, I clearly don&#39;t fit here. I thought I was=\r\n discussing\nsomething of small potential with the development team of junit=\r\n, but I\nclearly got that all wrong. I guess from that mistaken hypothesis a=\r\nll\nconclusion is obviously worthless, so I should&#39;ve just given up when I\nt=\r\nhought about giving up.\n\nI learned a lot from these threads, just little of=\r\n it was about junit & most\nof it was about this list&#39;s participants.\n\nNo mo=\r\nre noise from me...\n\nregards\n\nAdam\n\n\n\n\n\nTo unsubscribe from this group, sen=\r\nd an email to:\njunit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n \n\nYour use of Yahoo!
