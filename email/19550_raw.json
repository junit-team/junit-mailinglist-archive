We =\r\nare wondering of the tearDown() time is \nsimilary included?\n\nJUnit 4.3 look=\r\ns very nice, and we are also wondering if the\nuse of the @BeforeClass/@Afte=\r\nrClass Annotations will prevent the \nsetUp/tearDown times being included.\n\n=\r\nThis seems like a suitable question and it is not covered in the FAQ, \nwhic=\r\nh was last modified in 2002.\n\nThanks all\n\n\n\n",
