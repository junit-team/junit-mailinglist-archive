[mailto:mamago@...] \nSent: Friday, December 13, 2002 10:53 AM\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: [junit] OT: OO Newcomer\n\n\nOFF TOPIC\nDisclaimer:  see below\n\nBringing a newbie into OO\n=========================\n\nI would like to ask the people on this list for recommendations of the\nbest literature to bring an OO newbie up to speed.\n\nThe programming language in question is Java, which means that there is\na splendid wealth of online material for someone to learn the language.\nThe important thing, however, is to instill the notion of OO purity,\nwhich is harder, perhaps, than just teaching the language.\n\nFor example: the GoF patterns book is a must, but I think it is not a\ntext that you can give to someone until they have a grounding in OO\ntechniques.\n\nYour thoughts?\n\nManuel Amago.\n\n-----------------------------------------------\nDISCLAIMER\nI know this group is not for this type of question, which is why I\nexplicitly labelled this thread as OT (Off Topic).  I hope you will\nforgive my impertinence.  ;) But, I greatly value the opinions of the\npeople on this list, and I trust your opinion on this particular issue.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nmail2web - Check your email from the web at http://mail2web.com/ .\n\n\n\n\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\njunit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n \n\nYour use of Yahoo!
