It would be a shame to have to look at two things \nwhenever you used to have to look at one. \n\nTo me, the better thing is to notice when things are hard to test and \nthen decide whether to break your classes down into pieces where \noperations can be public and whether, once public, they enable more in \nyour code.  If you want to see an example of this, look at FIT \n(fit.c2.com).  I don&#39;t recall if it&#39;s that way now, but in the early \nversions all methods were either public or package-scope.  You have to \nmake some serious tradeoffs when you adopt that style for API code, but \nin general it&#39;s a reasonable style for application (non-API) code.\n\nMichael Feathers\nwww.objectmentor.com\n\nOle Ersoy wrote:\n\n&gt;Hi Guys,\n&gt;\n&gt;Would it be a good idea to always use all public\n&gt;methods...?\n&gt;\n&gt;In the context of a convention where there is a\n&gt;&quot;MainClass&quot; and a &quot;MainClassHelper&quot; that has public\n&gt;methods used to help the MainClass.\n&gt;\n&gt;Users of MainClassHelper (The collaborator should\n&gt;really be MainClass only) know that this class exists\n&gt;mainly for the purpose of helping MainClass, and all\n&gt;the methods are public, so that they can be easily\n&gt;unit tested.\n&gt;\n&gt;Otherwise they would be private or protected members\n&gt;of MainClass.\n&gt;\n&gt;So MainClassHelper can really be thought of as a\n&gt;utility library that is specific to MainClass...\n&gt;\n&gt;Anyone know if there are security risks to this,\n&gt;beside API risks?\n&gt;\n&gt;Thanks,\n&gt;- Ole\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;____________________________________________________________________________________\n&gt;Don&#39;t get soaked.
