Make the protected methods\n&gt; &gt; public.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; (c) ensure the methods are package-visible (isn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; that anyways\n&gt; &gt;     the case for protected?). Put the test class in\n&gt; &gt; the same\n&gt; &gt;     package.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; (d) (c), but keep the test classes elsewhere in the\n&gt; &gt; filesystem \n&gt; &gt;     tree.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; (e) (c) or (d), except it&#39;s not the test classes\n&gt; &gt; that share the\n&gt; &gt;     package, but a relay class.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; (f) Have the test classes define and use a subclass\n&gt; &gt; of the\n&gt; &gt;     class with protected methods. In that test\n&gt; &gt; class, add\n&gt; &gt;     public method(s) that delegate to the protected\n&gt; &gt; method(s).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; (g) Use reflection: look into a mirror and say &quot;you\n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t need\n&gt; &gt;     to use reflection. That would be a mistake.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; -- \n&gt; &gt; Chris &quot;electric hedgehog&quot; Dollin\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \t\n&gt; \t\t\n&gt; __________________________________ \n&gt; Do you Yahoo!? \n&gt; Yahoo!
