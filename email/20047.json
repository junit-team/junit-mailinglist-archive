The<br/>\nresponse to Crap4J was so positive that we decided to go further and<br/>\ncreated a dedicated website crap4j.org &lt;http://www.crap4j. &lt;http://www.crap4j.org&gt; org&gt; .<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve had hundreds of downloads since we launched the site, along with<br/>\nmany requests for Ant support and support for IDEs other than Eclipse.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe just added Ant support in 1.1.4, and we are planning to support other<br/>\nIDEs like NetBeans and IntelliJ (BTW, if you are interested in<br/>\ncontribute to plug-in development please let us know).<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have a chance, please try Crap4J on your project and let us know<br/>\nwhat you think. We are interested in getting this group&#39;s feedback on<br/>\nCrap4j and suggestions for improving and extending it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe home page is: www.crap4j.org &lt;http://www.crap4j. &lt;http://www.crap4j.org&gt; org&gt; ; from<br/>\nthere<br/>\nyou can navigate to the download page.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have any problems installing it or running it, feel free to ask<br/>\nfor help on the forum or file a bug report or feature request.<br/>\n&lt;http://trac. &lt;http://trac.crap4j.org/&gt; crap4j.org/&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\nAlberto<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
