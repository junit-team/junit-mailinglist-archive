Lots of discomfort using jUnit, is it\n&gt; only me..:-(\n&gt; \n&gt; Though this is not my usecase. Do not get carried away by this\n&gt; example..I am trying to sample a similar one..\n&gt; Assume the following heirarchy structure..\n&gt; BizDoc = Performs versions/history relation functions.\n&gt; OrderDoc -&gt; BizDoc = Performs Order related functions.\n&gt; RequestDoc -&gt; BizDoc = Performs Request related functions.\n&gt; PurchaseOrder -&gt;OrderDoc = Performs PO specific functions.\n&gt; Invoice -&gt; OrderDoc = Performs Invoice specific functions.\n&gt; Shipment -&gt; Orderdoc = Performs Shipment specific functions.\n&gt; Auction -&gt; RequestDoc = Performs auctions specific functions.\n&gt; PurchaseRequest -&gt; RequestDoc = Performs PR specific functions.\n&gt; \n&gt; I would prefer to organize my tests with a similar hierarchy structure\n&gt; to test the functions at the respective level.  Also I would like to\n&gt; initialise the objects needed in the appropriate level for the childs\n&gt; to make use of them without doing them again.\n\nIf you only want to share common setup (common objects), then put that \nbehavior in the setUp() method of an abstract TestCase class, then have \nall related test case classes extend that.\n\nTo speak in terms of your example, don&#39;t have OrderDoc extend BizDoc. \nInstead, have each extend BizOrderRequestDocTestTemplate, which is \nabstract and has no test cases.\n\nI think your discomfort comes from using inheritance in a way JUnit did \nnot intend.\n\n&gt; Currently when PurchaseRequestUt and AuctionUt tests are run, it\n&gt; executes RequestDocUt tests as well BizDocUt tests twice which is\n&gt; unnecessary.\n\n... so don&#39;t extend a class containing tests!\n\n&gt; I see two options .\n&gt; 1. Have a single parent without testXXX methods do the on demand\n&gt; initialisation at the top level and all Uts inherit from this single\n&gt; parent. And have Uts in a single level. In the above case BizDocUt &\n&gt; PurchaseRequestUt will be in the same level.  BizDocUt initialises\n&gt; some objects in the helpers and make available for all Uts.  Or if\n&gt; PurchaseRequestUt is run first it initialises first all Bizdoc objects\n&gt; so that BizdocUt can run w/o initializing them again.\n\nYes! You&#39;d be working the way JUnit is designed.\n\n&gt; Guys - don&#39;t you feel this is a very common need for any OO\n&gt; application.\n\nAbsolutely not. In fact, wanting to use the same setup for so many \ndifferent tests is a design smell. Well-designed OO code doesn&#39;t need this.\n\n&gt; I am surprised JUnit doesn&#39;t provided this flexibility\n&gt; directly.  I have posted my requirement for Logical flow of tests\n&gt; which is also good to have.\n\nIt&#39;s good to have when you choose to test an application end to end, \nrather than testing objects individually. JUnit was designed to help \ntesting objects, not end-to-end application request/response cycles.\n\n&gt; JUnit has these missing.  I can\n&gt; hack(override) into jUnit to support these but I do not want to\n&gt; maintain this for every release.\n\nI strongly recommend tools like Fit or TestNG for end-to-end testing, \nand use JUnit when you want to test individual objects.\n\n&gt; JUnit folks..are you hearing...?\n\nYes. Now it&#39;s time for you to hear: stop using inheritance this way. \nIt&#39;s obviously not helping you, so do something else. Perhaps what a \nnumber of us have recommended already. (At least three times, if I count \ncorrectly.)\n-- \nJ. B.
