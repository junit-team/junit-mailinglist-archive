However, as the system starts\n&gt; &gt; to get complicated those simple constructors sometimes become\n&gt; &gt; complications because of the need to have mocks for unit tests.  \n&gt; Later\n&gt; &gt; they become even greater complications because of the need to break\n&gt; &gt; or invert dependencies between modules.\n&gt;\n&gt; At such point as that becomes a real problem, I&#39;m willing to  \n&gt; refactor to\n&gt; accomplish this. However in my experience most classes are not reused,\n&gt; most do not need to be mocked, most do not need to be decoupled, and\n&gt; very few classes need multiple implementations.\n\nAgreed on all points except, possibly, the definition of the term  \n&quot;most&quot;.  If by that you mean &quot;more than half&quot; then I agree.  If, on  \nthe other hand you mean &quot;the overwhelming majority&quot; then I don&#39;t.  In  \nmy experience quite a few classes wind up needing this kind of  \ndecoupling.\n&gt; My objection is not to using these techniques in the rare cases where\n&gt; it&#39;s actually necessary.\n\nRare?\n\n&gt; My objection is to starting by assuming that\n&gt; the simplest thing (concrete classes with constructors) can&#39;t possibly\n&gt; work, and jumping straight into the deep end every time.\n\nI agree with that.  I find, however, that I *do* move many of them to  \ninterfaces in short order.\n\n----\nRobert C.
