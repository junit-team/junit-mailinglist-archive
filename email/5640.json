    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1568278774\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt; I prefer the idea of well designed code that makes it easy to substitute<br/>\n&gt; the /environment/ for a MockObject &lt;www.mockobjects.com&gt; instead.  This,<br/>\n&gt; IMHO, is the true nature of *unit* tests.  What you want to know is that<br/>\n&gt; your code responds to the environment in the expected way.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Your SQL is code and it also need to be unit tested. This cannot be done<br/>\nwith mock<br/>\nobjects. It needs to be executed by something which understands SQL. If<br/>\nnecessary<br/>\nyou can try to make this layer as thin as possible and abstract enough to<br/>\nsubstitute with<br/>\nmock objects at the next level up.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Thus you create mock objets for a faulty database: method call throws<br/>\n&gt; exception; a normal db call: the method returns a valid response; etc.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That is an advantage of mock objects. I would use a mixture of mock and real<br/>\nin the same test class.<br/>\n<br/>\nMock objects have there place. I have used them recently to test servlets<br/>\nwithout<br/>\na container and to test that Swing models fire events. I don&#39;t think all<br/>\nJDBC tests<br/>\nshould be done with mock objects however.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; This gives you complete control over the responses you expect from the<br/>\n&gt; environment, and allow you to test your code under expected conditions.<br/>\n&gt; It also means that your unit test suite will be a lot faster.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>But maybe the tests are fast enough even when they exercise the whole<br/>\nsystem from end to end. I did my ejb testing in container using a real<br/>\ndatabase and my tests weren&#39;t too slow.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had similar thoughts to David. My motivation was working from home when I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t have access to the database but would still like to execute as many<br/>\ntests as possible.<br/>\nOther classes of test might be long running stress tests.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Neil Swingler</div>",
