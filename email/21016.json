The reason is<br/>\nthat JUnit tests have always been isolated an we have come to expect<br/>\nthat to be the case. It is quite convenient not to have to worry about<br/>\nrestoring state between testruns so that testB can never fail because<br/>\ntestA failed to clean after iteself (or that testB does not run<br/>\nbecause it expects testA to have run which makes it fail in<br/>\nisolation). Tests are of course not completely isolated anyway since<br/>\nyou can write to the filesystem and mutate static data but a new<br/>\ninstance each time sure helps.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t mind if it would be possible to share an instance (after<br/>\nall I don&#39;t have to use it if I don&#39;t want to) but I think such a<br/>\nfunctionality should be the exception rather than the norm. One way to<br/>\ntreat such an exception would be to annotate the testclass as a shared<br/>\nfixture or something:<br/>\n<br/>\n@SharedFixture<br/>\n@RunOrder(AsDeclared.class)<br/>\npublic class SomeTest {<br/>\n...<br/>\n}<br/>\n<br/>\nBut maybe I&#39;m getting ahead of things, what would be the problem the<br/>\nabove would solve?<br/>\n<br/>\n/J<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJoakim Ohlrogge<br/>\nAgical AB<br/>\nVästerlånggatan 79, 2 tr<br/>\n111 29 Stockholm, SWEDEN<br/>\n<br/>\nBlog: johlrogge.wordpress.com</div>",
