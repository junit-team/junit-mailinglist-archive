And even though I&#39;ve used JUnit every work day for \nthe past 3\n&gt; &gt;  y=\r\nears, I have a new problem I&#39;m not sure how to approach.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  I need to=\r\n write some tests of a Java API that we&#39;re going to \ndeliver to\n&gt; &gt;  our cu=\r\nstomer.  And so my basic plan is to write some JUnit test \ncases\n&gt; &gt;  that =\r\nwill interact with our product through this Java API, just \nas a\n&gt; &gt;  custo=\r\nmer would.  But I don&#39;t want to have any of our product \nsource code\n&gt; &gt;  c=\r\nhecked out to do this.  Instead, I want my JUnit test case&#39;s \nsetUp() to\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;  find the appropriate JAR file on a remote system, fetch it \nlocally, and=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;  then start running tests against it.  That way, whenever the \nJAR fil=\r\ne on\n&gt; &gt;  the remote system (our system-under-test) changes, I know I&#39;ll \nb=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt;  testing the latest API code.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  I&#39;ve got all the tools at hand=\r\n to find and fetch the JAR file, \nbut I&#39;m\n&gt; &gt;  not sure what my approach sh=\r\nould be to load the JAR at runtime \nAFTER my\n&gt; &gt;  test (and thus the JVM it=\r\n&#39;s running in) has already started.  \nAny advice\n&gt; &gt;  for me?\n&gt; \n&gt; To do th=\r\nat implies some sort of classloader shenanigans, which \nisn&#39;t pretty.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nWhat is stopping you from getting the latest version of the JAR as\n&gt; part o=\r\nf the ANT script / automated build process that runs the \ntests,\n&gt; before t=\r\nhe tests start running?\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; \n&gt; James\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  Todd.\n&gt; &gt;  ----=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;  Todd Bradley - Polycom, Inc.\n&gt; &gt;  ReadiVideo QA Lead\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n",
