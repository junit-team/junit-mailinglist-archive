Maybe you are interested in\n&gt; what he has to say in favor of Contract-Driven Development. I like\n&gt; the idea of Design by Contract. And I think that it could make\n&gt; traditional JUnit tests obsolete, since the test cases could\n&gt; automatically be generated from the Contracts. I think this is what\n&gt; Parasoft JTest already does.\n\nI don&#39;t know why you insist that DBC and runtime assertion-based testing \nare mutually exclusive, considering they have so much in common.\n\nBut you&#39;re right, it&#39;s not worth reopening the discussion.\n\n&gt; Don&#39;t misunderstand me. I like JUnit. But I always look for better\n&gt; ways to solve my problems. So I hope you are as open as me to new\n&gt; solutions and ideas.\n\nOh, we understand you perfectly. Anyone satisfied with the results they \nare getting from what they&#39;re doing now is /obviously/ too closed-minded \nto look at every potential solution that comes along.\n-- \nJ. B.
