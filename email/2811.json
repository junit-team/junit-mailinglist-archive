The test excersize the interfaces of the Component and makes sure<br/>\nit behaves within the environment.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a way, it might be both at once.  We have extended JUnit&#39;s TestCase to<br/>\nmake what we want work.  It would just be easier to that by extending<br/>\nTestSuite instead of TestCase.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; On Tue, 2 Oct 2001, Berin Loritsch wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Eric Vought wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m not sure what Kent had in mind, but:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; In the first set of situations you mention (Logger hierarchies, config<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; files, etc), these can often be dealt with by stubbing out these<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; components.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; For example, although an application may use a complex logging<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; hierarchy which routes different classes of messages to different files or<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; hosts, the testcases are handed a Logger with a single listener which<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sends output to a single local file which is appropriately labelled and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; filed. Having this setup run for each test method does not slow my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; testcases down appreciably. It doesn&#39;t matter to the testcases where the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Logger actually sends its output to- just that there is something there to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; accept events. I have a LoggerTestCase which performs this setup for me<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and I just don&#39;t worry about it.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The issue is similar with config files. Most testcases don&#39;t care where<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the configuration data comes from. I just create a Map as a fixture which<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; contains exactly what is needed for particular testcases. My code doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; care what mechanism was used to populate the Map or what 10 gazillion<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; other values might be available. The actual process of interpreting the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; config files or database or whatever is in a separate package and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; independently tested.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I think the design issue is making your classes much less dependent on the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; global state. Singletons are just one aspect of that. If these components<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; are hidden behind nice interfaces, then you have a lot of freedom to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; decide just how much initialization is needed and can dumnmy out a lot of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; extra complexity.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The thing to reiterate is that we are testing Components that live in a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; specific environment, and we must make sure they play nice in that environment.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; This makes sure that changes to the environment don&#39;t break the Components,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and vice versa.  You can&#39;t test that with dummy stuff.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Not all our testcases use this heavy process--Only the testcases that test<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Components.  We have a lot of helper classes that we test individually--without<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the extra bulk.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sometime during the test cycle we need to perform the environment tests, so<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I would rather do it with JUnit than with a production system ;).<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; RMI *is* an issue and is one of the places I have had significant problems<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; with per-testcase fixtures. This and other testing issues led to me<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; dramatically reducing my use of RMI.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t typically use RMI in most cases, however we do have a component that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; exposes an RMI interface, so we need to test it.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
