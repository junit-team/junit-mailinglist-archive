For <br/>\nthese tests, success is measured by what I see in the inspector. But <br/>\nstoring these tests in junit has independent value. For one, success <br/>\ncan also defined as &#39;no exception thrown&#39;, which is what <br/>\njunit would test. (The exception might be an unanticipated error, or <br/>\na runtime exception I deliberately throw in the test). The other is <br/>\nsimply the value of &#39;cataloging&#39; and sharing these tests rather than <br/>\nhaving them ad hoc in a development workspace. True, I dont *have* to <br/>\nuse junit for that but it fits (except for the return value issue I <br/>\nam raising).<br/>\n<br/>\nObviously I can wrapper my test methods in a junit method but it is a <br/>\nwaste of time. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso thanks to Mike for the tip about looking at the code, great <br/>\nidea. But I dont have any source for junit.jar in the junit3.8.1.zip <br/>\nfile I downloaded from junit.org (also sourceforge), else I&#39;d have <br/>\nfixed this myself. Where do I find the source distro?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, Robert Wenner &lt;robert@p...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; On Monday 23 June 2003 18:43, areider wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I would like to write test methods that I can reuse outside of <br/>\njunit,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; where I would want to inspect the result of the test.
