So from <br/>\n&gt; time to time, in this area something may go wrong. Therefore I&#39;m <br/>\n&gt; looking for a tool, that generates a report showing only the <br/>\n&gt; differences between current and last JUnit report - which failing <br/>\n&gt; tests were fixed, which tests stopped to pass, which tests were added <br/>\n&gt; and which removed. Additionaly a test trend analysis should be <br/>\n&gt; possible.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I know, parsing the XML junitreport output and generating the info, <br/>\n&gt; e.g., with the help of a database, would be possible. But is anyone <br/>\n&gt; aware of an existing tool or open source project that can help in this <br/>\n&gt; direction?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>In the Maven world, there&#39;s a plugin called Maven Historical Data <br/>\n(http://mavenhistorical.sourceforge.net) that sounds like it would meet <br/>\nat least some of your needs. Specificially, it maintains a Hibernate <br/>\ndatabase of information scraped from JUnit reports, and builds some nice <br/>\ngraphs. Unlike most Maven plugins, it doesn&#39;t appear to built on top of <br/>\na corresponding Ant library, so it may be useless to you if you don&#39;t <br/>\nuse Maven.</div>",
