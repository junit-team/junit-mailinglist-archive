I see two things:\n\n1) adding a way to obtain/test private information.\n\nSure... if you really need to.  My view is generally that if\nsomething&#39;s private then it isn&#39;t part of the external behaviour of\nthe code... and so shouldn&#39;t be the subject of a test... that would be\ntesting the implementation of the behaviour.. and not the behaviour\nitself.\n\nAs a rule, I don&#39;t test private methods directly.  Private methods are\nan implementation detail, and (the way I work) the result of\nrefactoring.  If they become important or useful enough that they are\npromoted to public, then they need direct tests... but not until then.\n\nHowever, it can be a useful approach to writing characterization tests\nfor an existing codebase.\n\n2) &quot;insert temporary lines of code&quot;\n\nNo.  Not temporary.  If you add code in support of a test it has to\nhave the life span of the test, and tests are meant to be long lived.\n You don&#39;t write a test to make sure things work then throw the test\naway.  The test is like an alter-ego of the code.  Like that episode\nof Star Trek where Kirk gets ripped in two by the transporter.  Either\nin isolation doesn&#39;t make sense.\n\nDave\n\n\n",
