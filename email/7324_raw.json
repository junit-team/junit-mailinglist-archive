I\n&gt; basically need it for doing regression testing. Junit doesn&#39;t\n&gt; support eclipse.\n\nI believe I understand your question, but IMHO your vocabulary is\nimprecise :-)\n\nJunit _does_ support eclipse, and vv. But that&#39;s not your problem.\nAlso, there are several tools for automating AWT and Swing UIs,\nseveral of which have excellent JUnit integration (like JFCUnit, which\nyou know). For more info, see\n\nhttp://www.superlinksoftware.com/cgi-bin/jugwiki.pl?TestingGUIs\n\nHowever, most folks writing extensions for Eclipse are gonna be\nwriting SWT UIs, and that&#39;s probably your problem. AFAIK, right now,\nthe only tools that will automate an SWT UI are\n\n* platform-native tools (about which I know little), such as the\n  Mercury tools and Rational Robot. Because SWT is a relatively thin\n  layer over the native widgets, platform-native tools will work.\n  (AFAIK OTI considers this an acceptable state of affairs--I\n  disagree.) I dunno about the level of JUnit integration of any of\n  these.\n\n* Rational RobotJ will also do SWT, and has the advantage of allowing\n  much of the scripting in Java. Unfortunately AFAIK is has no JUnit\n  integration at this time.\n\nHowever, extending some of the open, JUnit-integrated tools to handle\nSWT seems like it should not be rocket science.
