This works fine when the TestAll suite is manually selected from a menu presented in an HTML screen. \n\nWith JUnit, I wrote a short batch file containing an ANT command line to build and test the entire application. With the JUnitEE TestAll suite normally activated from the browser, I&#39;m stuck as to how to automate my TestAll suite to run overnight. \n\nHas anyone else come out with a solution to this problem ? Or am I on the wrong track here ?  I am looking at using Cactus, but at present most of our unit testing is testing the home interfaces at CMP level, and I don&#39;t think Cactus is appropriate for this.\n\nThanks for your help. \n\nScott \n\n\n--\nPersonalised email by http://another.com\r\n------=_Part_6734_2182559.1015491990698--\r\n\n",
