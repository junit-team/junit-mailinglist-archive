I&#39;d rather just assume any number I give will be \nwrong and defer giving an estimate until after building some small \nportion of the system.  That is, I can&#39;t tell you how much extra time \nwriting unit tests takes, but I can tell you how long it took us to \nbuild this much software with unit tests.  \n\nLet the delivery of working software speak for itself.
