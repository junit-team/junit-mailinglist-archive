The file is in the directory\n&gt; &gt; junit&#92;=\r\ntests&#92;runner under my base classpath directory, and the\n&gt; &gt; reference withi=\r\nn the call is to junit.tests.runner.LoadedFromJar,\n&gt; &gt; which is correct fro=\r\nm the base classpath. I tried adding it in\n&gt; &gt; explicitly without success.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; Don&#39;t take this the wrong way, but it doesn&#39;t sound like your \nproblem=\r\n is \n&gt; JUnit related.  It sounds like you need to brush up on Java \nclasspa=\r\nth & \n&gt; Java commandline usage.  You can look at \n&gt; http://www.kevinboone.c=\r\nom/classpath.html for more help, or just \nGoogle for \n&gt; &#39;java classpath&#39; an=\r\nd &#39;java commandline&#39;, you will get tons of hits.\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; Jason Rogers\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &quot;So great is the ignorance, so very little the knowledge, of even \nthe b=\r\nest \n&gt; of men!&quot; - John Wesley, &quot;Christian Perfection&quot;\n\nNo offense taken (so=\r\nrry for the delay in responding =96 out of town); \nI am definitely new to t=\r\nhis. That said I do not understand the \nfailure on the JUnit self-test. The=\r\n classpath appears to be correct, \neven after reading the material you sugg=\r\nested. It has the base \ndirectory listed as well as the junit.jar file. The=\r\n system is \nlocating the other class files for the other tests, and is loca=\r\nting \nthe &quot;test.jar&quot; file. I inserted an additional assert in the code to \n=\r\nverify the load jar file command returned correctly. The \nClassNotFoundExce=\r\nption exception is thrown when it tries to load the \nclass junit.tests.runn=\r\ner.LoadedFromJar using the loadClass() method \n(line 33 in the file TestCas=\r\neClassLoaderTest.java). The test.jar \nfile has the correct path embedded in=\r\n it (file LoadedFromJar.class \nwith path junit&#92;tests&#92;runner according to zi=\r\np), so I am not sure \nwhat the failure is. The other 118 tests all pass, an=\r\nd I have not \nmade any modifications other than those specified in the FAQ.=\r\n\n\n\n\n",
