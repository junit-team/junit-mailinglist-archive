Why would you\nwant to do this?  One of the strengths of the framework (IMHO) is the\nguidance it gives me to fix every test incrementally.  I am unclear on why\nyou would want the test to go on.  It seems to me that you would end up\nbiting off more than you can chew.\n\n    &gt; Hi,\n    &gt; \n    &gt; When I run my test suite I found that each test stops \n    &gt; running after the\n    &gt; first failed assertion. I have a number of assertions in \n    &gt; each test and I\n    &gt; would like to know every assertion that is broken. I have tried to\n    &gt; create a default TestResult inside each test using,\n    &gt; \n    &gt; \tTestResult result = createResult();\n    &gt; \n    &gt; and then adding failures to &#39;result&#39; using,\n    &gt; \n    &gt; \tresult.addFailure(mytest, afe);\n    &gt; \n    &gt; which works fine, except that no AssertionFailedException \n    &gt; gets thrown\n    &gt; this way and my test passes even though I have broken assertions.\n    &gt; \n    &gt; Is there any way I can get JUnit to show all broken \n    &gt; assertions for each\n    &gt; test and not move onto the next test when the first \n    &gt; assertion fails?\n\n\n\n",
