The use of the term &quot;test case&quot; to represent a<br/>\n    collection of tests with common fixture is a nonstandard use of the<br/>\n    term. It sounds to me like nothing more than a name that looked good at<br/>\n    first, but wasn&#39;t changed when perhaps it could have been. Everything<br/>\n    is a TestSuite, although most of them are automatically generated for<br/>\n    us. Once I made that connexion, everything became clear.<br/>\n    <br/>\n    &gt;Anyone think this would make a good topic for the TDD Coad Letter?<br/>\n    <br/>\n    Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\nOK.  It&#39;s on my list.  To help me focus it better, I would appreciate<br/>\ninput from the community with regard to what questions you would like to<br/>\nsee answered/explored.<br/>\n<br/>\nDave<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nDave Astels<br/>\n  Coauthor of &quot;A Practical Guide to XP&quot; <br/>\n  Editor of the Test-Driven Development Edition of The Coad Letter<br/>\nCEO & Master Software Craftsman <br/>\n<br/>\nAn Agile Software Studio<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>",
