It is not clear to me that AfterClass would be called =\r\nin this case (a Suite with no @Test in it).\n\nBeforeClass and AfterClass are=\r\n also static methods and the functionality I need to implement is once per =\r\ninstance, not once for all instances.\n\nIt&#39;s unlikely that my test suite wou=\r\nld ever be run more than once in the same JVM so I could probably make Befo=\r\nreClass and AfterClass work - if AfterClass is guaranteed to be run after t=\r\nhe Suite is finished.\n\nIs there a pattern in JUnit for BeforeSuite and Afte=\r\nrSuite functionality?\n\nThanks.\n\n\n",
