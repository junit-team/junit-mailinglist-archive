The <br/>\n&gt; &gt; question of faithfulness of representation doesn&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; &gt; arise.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am a little on the fence with this example.  You can<br/>\n&gt; explain that a process has a start and an end, ways of<br/>\n&gt; interacting with the environment, that they use<br/>\n&gt; resources, and are controlled, enabled or regulated by<br/>\n&gt; a larger system.  In this sense, a software process<br/>\n&gt; could correspond to a natural process, like<br/>\n&gt; photosynthesis or blood clotting.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Certainly an analogy can be drawn, and it justifies the use of the<br/>\nword &quot;process&quot;.  But it&#39;s a long step from that to the idea that<br/>\nOS processes are intended to *model* real-world processes, which<br/>\nis what is needed for faithfulness of representation to be an<br/>\nimportant consideration.<br/>\n<br/>\nAn analogy can also be drawn between the kind of windows that let<br/>\nyou see through walls and the windows of windowing GUIs, again<br/>\njustifying the word.  But no one objects that GUIs&#39; windows don&#39;t<br/>\nget streaked and so are not faithful representations of their<br/>\nreal-world counterparts, nor that minimizing a window has no<br/>\nreal-world analogue and so is added behaviour that corrupts the<br/>\nobject design.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; Resources often do represent real-world objects, but<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it is highly desirable that the representations have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; properties those objects do not -- sharability among<br/>\n&gt; &gt; concurrently executing processes, for example.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; How do you represent &quot;shareability&quot; as a property in<br/>\n&gt; something like a software file?  [...]<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The example I had in mind was the printing system, actually,<br/>\nconstrued as a representation of the printer.  This system has<br/>\nqueueing behaviour which the printer does not, and as a result<br/>\nprinting more than one job simultaneously through the printing<br/>\nsystem gives different (and more useful) results than trying to<br/>\nprint more than one job directly on the printer.<br/>\n<br/>\n  [...]<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I wonder if &quot;changeability&quot; could be reduced and made<br/>\n&gt; more precise by analysis, like I am trying to reduce<br/>\n&gt; &quot;testability&quot; and &quot;maintainability.&quot;  [...]<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If you&#39;re just looking for a more precise definition, I&#39;d suggest<br/>\nthis: a system is said to have high changeability when the cost of<br/>\nchanging it is low.  (Still vague, but it&#39;s the proper vagueness.)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy claim that changeability is desirable relies on a tacit<br/>\nassumption that the costs of change dominate the lifetime costs of<br/>\na software system.  (Well, I also have aesthetic reasons for<br/>\nliking changeability.  But cost reduction is the main pragmatic<br/>\nreason.)<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nSteven Taschuk           | &quot;I may be wrong but I&#39;m positive.&quot;<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:staschuk@...\">staschuk@...</a> |       _Friday_, Robert A.
