Determine whether Extract Class should be used to split the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; responsibilities of the class into two or more abstractions.

Return to step 1.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t see this as a solution. If the method wasn&#39;t public before, it<br/>\n&gt; shouldn&#39;t be public now just because it moved to a different class. If<br/>\n&gt; the only reason it becomes public is because it moved to a different<br/>\n&gt; class, it would be better off as the original private method inside the<br/>\n&gt; one class. Public API should be kept to a minimum, especially if you<br/>\n&gt; expect anybody to use your API. If the API is purely for your app&#39;s own<br/>\n&gt; internal use, then this constraint can be relaxed a little, but you<br/>\n&gt; should still strive for the minimum exposure of class internals. This is<br/>\n&gt; one of the first principles of object oriented design, and test driven<br/>\n&gt; development doesn&#39;t really change it to any significant extent.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote> If using TDD you are slowly emerging the design. Why would Extract Class <br/>\nnot be a valid refactoring? At some point a private method on a class wants <br/>\nto be a class in it&#39;s own.
