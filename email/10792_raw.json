But alas, I\n&gt; &gt; believe we are off-topic now.  You are correct in the sense that it\n&gt; &gt; reduces memory usage, but as a habit (personally) I feel it should be\n&gt; &gt; avoided.  If I must optimize, this is surely a good optimization place.\n&gt; &gt; For example:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(file));\n&gt; &gt;   String line = null;\n&gt; &gt;   while ( (line = reader.readLine()) != null ) {\n&gt; &gt;     doSomethingWith(line);\n&gt; &gt;   }\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; is _MUCH_ cheaper (in terms of allocation) than:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(file));\n&gt; &gt;   while ( reader.ready() ) {\n&gt; &gt;     String line = reader.readLine();\n&gt; &gt;     doSomethingWith(line);\n&gt; &gt;   }\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t see why you think this: in both cases all the interesting allocation\n&gt; happens inside readLine. Where the local variable is declared is going\n&gt; to make essentially no difference. [Internally, &quot;line&quot; is a reference value\n&gt; of fixed size, allocated in the method&#39;s stack-frame; it&#39;s not an object\n&gt; allocated in the heap [1], so going round the loop redeclaring it doesn&#39;t\n&gt; burn store. It would be different if we were in a language with full lexical\n&gt; scoping like Scheme or Pop11, and the variable was captured by a closure,\n&gt; but we aren&#39;t and we cant.]\n&gt; \n&gt; [1] I can imagine an implementation that allocated stack-frames on the\n&gt; heap, as NJSML does, but even that doesn&#39;t allocate individual variables\n&gt; on the heap in cases like this.\n\nAlas, you are correct.  In the future I will refrain from responding on\nso little sleep.  I can&#39;t confirm it, though I believe what was in my\nmind was GC optimization (having to keep track of many stale\nreferences), but even that is of no consequence in this case given that\nthe code in question would probably be optimized by the compiler\nanyway.  You are correct that the real allocation is in the readLine()\nmethod call to the reader.  Can I use this as one (or more) of my\nblunders for the year?\n\n-- \nJason Rogers\n\n&quot;Where there is no vision, the people perish...&quot;\nBible, Proverbs 29:18\n\n\n",
