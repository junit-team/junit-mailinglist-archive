This is why we are looking for a good obfuscator. I have =\r\nno experience with obfuscators but my boss has ordered me to get a good one=\r\n, no matter whether it is commercial or not.\n\nPlease let me know what obfus=\r\ncators you use and what about the experience with them.\n\nI look forward to =\r\nhearing from you.\n\n\n\n\n&gt; -----Mensaje original-----\n&gt; De:\tChad Woolley [SMTP=\r\n:lists@...]\n&gt; Enviado el:\tmartes, 11 de noviembre de 2003 10:=\r\n57\n&gt; Para:\tjunit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Asunto:\tRe: [junit] Digest Number 1040\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; Nathan Coast wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Hi,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Is anyone doing performance testin=\r\ng with junit or a junit extension?  I&#39;ve \n&gt; &gt; looked at JUnitPerf and I don=\r\n&#39;t think it has the functionality I need.  I&#39;d like \n&gt; &gt; to record the time=\r\n taken to execute individual junit tests.  The idea is that it \n&gt; &gt; should =\r\nthen be possible identify when code changes occurred that caused a \n&gt; &gt; sig=\r\nnificant drop in performance.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; thanks\n&gt; &gt; Nathan\n&gt; \n&gt; You could pro=\r\nbably do this if you wrote a custom TestRunner.\n&gt; \n&gt; If you know Aspect-Ori=\r\nented Programming, this also seems like a good use for it. \n&gt;   It would be=\r\n fairly simple to write an aspect which reported elapsed execution \n&gt; time =\r\non a per-test-method level.  You could write the data on all tests for each=\r\n \n&gt; run to a CSV file, for example.  Then you could use a spreadsheet or ot=\r\nher tool \n&gt; to perform trend analysis on the collected data over time.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubsc=\r\nribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
