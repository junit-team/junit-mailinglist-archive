As for me \n&gt; stress testing is testing in conditions which are very close \n&gt; to &quot;production&quot;. Is it possible to call such a testing as \n&gt; &quot;unit&quot; testing? In most cases stresstests are to figure out \n&gt; how set of components works, this set may be distributed \n&gt; between server and client, between peers, and so on... but \n&gt; jUnit fundamently works on one machine. I think PRIMARILY \n&gt; jUnit is for testing of classes or small sets of components. \n&gt; Am I right?\n\nI believe you are, however the jperf extension from junit\nand the other the ways of running multiple thread / process discussed\nrecently are aimed at predicting the scalability of your units of code\n. However, you are not going to be sure until you do full stress & load \ntesting on the production release.\n\nStu\n\n&gt; PS. there is also difference between load testing and stress \n&gt; testing... above I gathered them under term &quot;stress&quot; :)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
