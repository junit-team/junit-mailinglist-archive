I started searching for best =\r\npractices and found that people were asking that question all the way back =\r\nin 2001!  Kind of intimidating!\n\nAnyway, what I am looking for is not &quot;best=\r\n practices&quot;, per se, but a real world example.  And from that I mean an exa=\r\nmple that starts from an idea in someone&#39;s head and evolves all the way thr=\r\nough application completion and testing coverage.  For example, I am thinki=\r\nng of an auto insurance type of application that has certain requirements, =\r\nsay 10, and how the tests are derived from the requirements and the code ge=\r\nts derived from the tests.  \n\nWe have many developers that are new to Test =\r\nDriven Development, and to simply come out with best practices and ask them=\r\n to get on board will never work.  However, if we can take a real world exa=\r\nmple, from start to finish, and show how the tests did drive the code and h=\r\now refactoring became so much simpler as a result, that would be a great st=\r\nart into changing the mentality of some of our developers (myself included =\r\n;-)\n\nAny suggestions?\nThank you,\nRegards,\nElaine\n\n\n",
