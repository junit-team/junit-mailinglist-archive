In my case, it doesn&#39;t \napply as strictly because of what I&#39;m doing\nin the TestSetup.setUp(). I have a set of database \ninserts that I do in the TestSetup.setup(), but don&#39;t \ndelete the rows in the tearDown(). Because I don&#39;t \ndelete the data, I can use it in the individual tests.\n\nSo, I&#39;m really breaking the rules by not cleaning up \nwhat I did in the setUp().\n\nSuppose I could just do the database init externally \nanyway.\n\nBTW, I do have separate setUp and tearDown for each \nindividual test case wrapped by the TestSetup. That \nmakes it possible to do additional setup for the \nindividual tests. \n\nThanks,\nHerm\n\n--- &quot;Dinwiddie, George&quot;\n&lt;George.Dinwiddie@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Herm,\n&gt; \n&gt; One thing I&#39;ve found is that when using the\n&gt; TestSetup\n&gt; decorator, it&#39;s no longer possible to run the\n&gt; individual\n&gt; tests, because there&#39;s no longer an individual setUp\n&gt; and\n&gt; tearDown for them.\n&gt; \n&gt;  - George\n&gt; \n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Herm Greider [mailto:animate123@...]\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, March 07, 2001 11:49 AM\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: [junit] TestSetup decorator with\n&gt; swingui.TestRunner\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; A couple of kind folks aimed me at the TestSetup \n&gt; decorator a couple of weeks ago to run setup code \n&gt; for a block of tests. \n&gt; \n&gt; This works great except for one annoyance. In the\n&gt; swingui.TestRunner, under the Test Hierarchy tab,\n&gt; the TestSetup and the tests it wraps show up as:\n&gt; \n&gt;     junit.framework.TestSuite\n&gt; \n&gt; With no drill-down possible. Is this by design?\n&gt; \n&gt; It is really nothing more than an annoyance. But\n&gt; it would be nice to be able to run the complete \n&gt; TestSuite and then pick specific tests from the\n&gt; hierarchy tab and run them directly to isolate \n&gt; failures without starting a separate GUI.\n&gt; \n&gt; Herm Greider\n&gt; Lexis-Nexis\n&gt; Dayton, Ohio\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; Get email at your own domain with Yahoo!
