So I&#39;m inclined to think that there actually\n&gt;&gt; might be some importance in the order.\n&gt;&gt;     \n&gt;\n&gt; Ah yes, but how much? One problem with this entire thread is that we \n&gt; don&#39;t have enough data to support any of our claims.\n&gt;   \nThan perhaps we shouldn&#39;t claim something. That&#39;s not a problem to me - \nI already know enough to decide what I want to do. And I can report what \nmy experience is - readers with an open mind might than take that into \naccount when they decide what *they* want to do or want to try. Others \nprobably wouldn&#39;t be persuaded by more data, anyway.\n\nRegards, Ilja\n\n",
