I agree with you that there\n&gt; are too many terms that mean similar things, but &quot;developer testing&quot;\n&gt; is what most people and companies out there seem to use to describe\n&gt; the act of software developers getting seriously involved in test\n&gt; development.  Even in the Agile community, people like Brian Marick\n&gt; (one of the original authors of the Agile Manifesto) use &quot;developer\n&gt; testing&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; Right or wrong, most people interpret &quot;programmer testing&quot; as the\n&gt; testing *of* a programmer&#39;s skill (e.g. certification.)\n\nI strongly disagree with &quot;most,&quot; but I get your point. And anyway, how \ndoes calling it &quot;developer testing&quot; solve that problem?\n\n&gt; There is also the issue that some &quot;software engineers&quot; want to be\n&gt; though of as developers and not programmers.  What&#39;s the difference\n&gt; between a programmer and a developer?  I haven&#39;t seen a serious\n&gt; definition of the two, but below is a humorous attempt I read\n&gt; somewhere (origins unknown):\n&gt; \n&gt; * Programmer: A biological machine designed to convert caffeine into\n&gt; code.\n&gt; \n&gt; * Developer: A person who develops working systems by writing and\n&gt; using software.\n&gt; \n&gt; Using this definition, I guess all of us are sometimes programmers\n&gt; and sometimes developers :-).  Although, apparently, you can&#39;t be a\n&gt; programmer if you drink decaf.\n\n From what I&#39;ve seen recently, Developer is the term used to describe \nthe general class of people working on a software project. They (and I) \nuse it as short for &quot;Product Developer&quot; and not &quot;Software Developer&quot;. A \nProgrammer is a Developer, but then so is a Tester.\n\nI don&#39;t buy into the notion that a Developer is a more sophisticated \nProgrammer. It&#39;s called Extreme Programming, after all, and not Extreme \nDeveloping. Calling myself a Programmer reminds me that, ultimately, \nclean code that works (programming) is how I solve a customer&#39;s business \nproblem.\n\n&gt; In general usage I hear and read &quot;unit testing&quot;, &quot;developer\n&gt; testing&quot;, and &quot;programmer testing&quot; used quite interchangeably (and\n&gt; in that order of frequency).\n&gt; \n&gt;  &gt;(What&#39;s a &quot;unit&quot; anyway?)\n&gt; \n&gt; That&#39;s another challenge altogether :-), but that&#39;s the primary\n&gt; reason why I thought that &quot;developer testing&quot; was better than &quot;unit\n&gt; testing.&quot;\n\nTrue enough. It&#39;s a living and breathing thing and we&#39;ll all have \ndifferent opinions. I encourage people not to think that Programmer \nTesting and unit testing are the same thing. In most cases, a unit is an \nobject; and in most cases, when a programmer writes a test, it&#39;s for an \nobject. That&#39;s why I say &quot;Object Testing&quot; is one part of &quot;Programmer \nTesting&quot;.\n-- \nJ. B.
