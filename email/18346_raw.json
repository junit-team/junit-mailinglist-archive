I&#39;m a longtime computer industry journalist; I egotistically =\r\nimagine that \nyou&#39;ve seen my byline here-and-there, particularly when it co=\r\nmes to software \ndevelopment topics. (If not, please don&#39;t tell me; I&#39;ll cr=\r\ny.)\n\nLast week, I started a new job as senior editor at cio.com and csoonli=\r\nne.com, where I&#39;m \nprimarily responsible for the online communities. That d=\r\noesn&#39;t keep me from writing \narticles -- and the first one that I decided t=\r\no tackle is among the rough spots between \nmanagement and development staff=\r\n. And I&#39;d very much like your input.\n\nI know, from Evans Data research, tha=\r\nt a rather high percentage of software developers \nwrite open source code, =\r\nwhether on their own time or the company&#39;s clock; some \nmeaningful percenta=\r\nge of those developers also contribute the changes back to the open \nsource=\r\n community. And one of the factoids mentioned in passing at the Gartner Ope=\r\nn \nSource summit in September was that a growing percentage of corporations=\r\n are paying \ntheir own developers to work on open source projects, some of =\r\nwhom do so full time. IBM \nis probably the easiest example, with several pe=\r\nople on the Eclipse project employed by \nIBM.\n\nI&#39;m looking for other people=\r\n in that situation -- either the salaried open source developer \nor that de=\r\nveloper&#39;s management -- so I can write an article to provide guidance to IT=\r\n \nManagers who are contemplating such options.\n\nWhat I&#39;m hoping to find (or=\r\n create) are management guidelines for companies who want to \ntake advantag=\r\ne of open source code, and know that they need functions that aren&#39;t \ncurre=\r\nntly in the software. The easiest solution is to add the features they need=\r\n to the \nexisting open source code base, then contribute the enhancements b=\r\nack to the \ndevelopment community. But doing so can raise intellectual prop=\r\nerty questions (such as \n&quot;what does it mean for &#39;work for hire&#39;?&quot;)... and p=\r\nerhaps several other issues that make \nlawyers and CEOs uncomfortable. I&#39;d =\r\nlike to get your input on what issues the open source \ndeveloper and her ma=\r\nnager need to deal with. (Feel free to forward this to developers you \nknow=\r\n who might be able to help.)\n\nNote that I&#39;m NOT looking here for people who=\r\n are using open source tools at work; that \nis, I&#39;m thrilled if you write c=\r\node in Eclipse or you target your site to run on the Apache Web \nserver, bu=\r\nt I&#39;m not after the users. Rather, I&#39;m in search of someone who writes the =\r\ncode \n_of_ the open source software: a committer to Plone, a contributor to=\r\n Drupal, a \nprogrammer who&#39;s given code to samba. And who has done so on co=\r\nmpany time, whether \nas part of the job description or simply to get the wo=\r\nrk done or for any other reason. With \nor without management approval, thou=\r\ngh I&#39;m most interested in those who can say &quot;with.&quot;\n\nSo, if you&#39;re the righ=\r\nt person, here&#39;s the questions I&#39;m wondering about:\n\n* How did you convince=\r\n management that this was a good idea? Or did they approach you?\n\n* What co=\r\nncerns did management have regarding intellectual property issues? How were=\r\n \nthey resolved?\n\n* People issues: Were there &quot;team&quot; challenges, since the =\r\nopen source developer is sort-of \nworking on corporate applications (but no=\r\nt quite)? Have the needs of the open source \ncommunity ever presented a con=\r\nflict with your company identity? Do people in the open \nsource community k=\r\nnow for whom you work; that is, does your e-mail sig identify you as \n@comp=\r\nany.com or @..., and does that have any side effects?\n\n* What other =\r\nproblems came up? How have you dealt with them? \n\n* In short, what should a=\r\n manager know before she decides to say, &quot;Okay, we&#39;ll let you \nwork 20 hour=\r\ns a week on the such-and-so project&quot;?\n\nI&#39;m writing for the manager and CIO =\r\nhere; let&#39;s help them make the best decisions \npossible.\n\nI&#39;m hoping to pos=\r\nt the article sometime at the beginning of December, so I&#39;d appreciate \nany=\r\n advice you can offer me -- publicly or privately -- sooner rather than lat=\r\ner. Also, let \nme know (privately if necessary) about your company and open=\r\n source community \naffliations; we can work out the details of &quot;how should =\r\nI refer to you&quot; one-on-one.\n\nEsther Schindler\nsenior editor, cio.com\neschin=\r\ndler@...\n\n\n\n\n",
