Among other\n&gt; &gt; things, it is much larger :-(\n&gt; [snip]\n&gt; &gt; In other words, fixtures can include classes, although they\n&gt; &gt; almost always consist only of objects.\n&gt;\n&gt; I think you&#39;re equivocating on the word &#39;class&#39; here.  Classes are\n&gt; always dealt programmatically in Java via the java.lang.Class object,\n&gt; or, if you&#39;re manipulating the constituent binary data, via an\n&gt; InputStream or some other object.  I think you were right before, in\n&gt; the general sense: Java deals with objects except for the primitive\n&gt; types.\n\nUhm, yes...\n\nIf you look through the literature, you will find things called defining\nclass loaders.  They are class loaders that turn byte arrays into classes.\nJXCL acts as a defining class loader, using the method\n\n  protected final Class defineClass(String name, byte[] b, int off,\n      int len) throws ClassFormatError\n\nto produce what you can see by inspecting the signature are in fact\ngenuine Java classes.  If the byte array b is recognized by the JVM as\na Java class, it loads it, anointing it as such.  If the JVM doesn&#39;t\nfind it acceptable, it throws the ClassFormatError.\n\nEssentially, if the JVM says that a data structure is a Java class, it\nis a Java class.  It&#39;s loaded into a special area and treated in a\nvery special way.\n\nOf course I accept that others use the word in a different sense in other\ncontexts.  But here, in the Java context, a class can most certainly be\ncreated by a program.  If you wish, I can point you to countless\nreferences.  For starters, try Sheng Liang&#39;s &quot;Dynamic Class Loading in\nthe Java Virtual Machine&quot;; it&#39;s an easy read.  There is a link from\nhttp://java.sun.com/people/sl\n\nPerhaps you would accept this formulation:\n\n&quot;A fixture is a non-empty set of objects and/or primitive types, which\n are normally initialized before testing, except that in rare cases the\n objects may be uninstantiated (and therefore uninitialized) Java\n classes.&quot;\n\n--\nJim Dixon  jdd@...   tel +44 117 982 0786  mobile +44 797 373 7881\n    for more information on JXCL see http://jxcl.sourceforge.net\n\n\n",
