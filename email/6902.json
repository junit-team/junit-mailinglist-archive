Whereas non-TDD code would not follow that and could be random.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust thought this was a very interesting line of thought...<br/>\n<br/>\nJoel Shellman<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Scott Stirling <br/>\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, February 06, 2003 8:18 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: [junit] TDD -&gt; FSM<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: J.

If I <br/>\n&gt; &gt; give you some code that I test-drove, would you try <br/>\n&gt; identifying how it <br/>\n&gt; &gt; is a FSM? That would be very interesting.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;d be willing to try.  I would be interested to have an <br/>\n&gt; example that&#39;s not my own or borrowed out of a book.  But I&#39;m <br/>\n&gt; working with a few book examples right now, trying to sort <br/>\n&gt; things out and see how far I can take this FSM idea.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Scott S.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
