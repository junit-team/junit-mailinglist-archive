If I just print the information to standard\n&gt; out it gets pushed together with all the other stdout information and\n&gt; doesn&#39;t tell me what test was running when it was printed. If I call\n&gt; System.exit(1), then I get a BUILDFAILED message that tells me what\n&gt; *class* containing the tests failed, but it doesn&#39;t tell me the exact\n&gt; method of the test.\n&gt;\n&gt; How can I force more specific output? Should I be using a different\n&gt; test runner? I need one that will work with junit 3.8.1.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Brendan\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n",
