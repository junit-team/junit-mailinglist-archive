There is no &#39;zero&#39; in temperature so it is not\n&gt;  &gt;&gt; correct to say it is going to be twice as cold tomorrow. And yes, I\n&gt;  &gt;&gt; know there is &#39;absolute&#39; zero but ask any statistician and he will\n&gt;  &gt;&gt; tell you that using ratios with our normal temperature scales is\n&gt;  &gt;&gt; simply wrong.  Using ratios with time works if you are using timed\n&gt;  &gt;&gt; tests and define &#39;zero&#39; as no time.  Then yes, 5 minutes is twice as\n&gt;  &gt;&gt; slow as 10 minutes.\n&gt; \n&gt; 5 minutes is twice as *slow* as 10 minutes?  While that might be\n&gt; technically accurate from a narrow mathematical definition of &quot;twice as\n&gt; slow&quot;, I doubt most readers of English would interpret it that way.\n\nWell, it&#39;s wrong: anything that happens in five minutes happens twice as \nquickly as if it happened in ten minutes. :)\n\nSaying that &quot;5 minutes is slow&quot; is the problem. Minutes are not slow, or \nfast. :)\n\nHey... we can *all* be pedantic.\n\n&gt; In general when making comparisons, I take &quot;faster&quot; to mean less time\n&gt; and &quot;slower&quot; to mean more time.\n\nNot just you. :)\n-- \nJ.
