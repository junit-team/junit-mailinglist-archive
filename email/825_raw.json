Goodness knows the loader could use a bunch more tests.\n\nPart of the political statement of JUnit is that as the reporter of \nbugs you have the additional responsibility to track down the bugs \nfar enough that the provider has an objective measure of whether they \nwill have satisfied you. We could debate whether this is a better, or \neven reasonable, social contract, but it&#39;s how Erich and I work.\n\nKent\n\n\n",
