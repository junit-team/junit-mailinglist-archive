There is a<br/>\n&gt; provider for JUnit3, JUnit pre 4.7 and JUnit post 4.7. JUnit post 4.7 uses<br/>\n&gt; the JUnitCore, which you could replace with your own version, which inserts<br/>\n&gt; the same rule everywhere.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It seems (at first glance) to be a better way to get global behaviour from<br/>\n&gt; your jenkins server.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Matthew Farwell.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 2013/4/30 Henning Groß &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:igaffai@...\">igaffai@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; **<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hi Kevin!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Thank you very much for your feedback! First some words to the<br/>\n&gt; environment:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; In the project I need the feature we currently have 9 developers and it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; might be more. Even freelancers. There are something around 20k tests.<br/>\n&gt; What<br/>\n&gt; &gt; we want to achieve is to enable a global timeout rule that applies<br/>\n&gt; &gt; different timeouts to tests depending on their category (eg<br/>\n&gt; SlowTests.class<br/>\n&gt; &gt; may take longer than other tests). Also there are other things to take<br/>\n&gt; into<br/>\n&gt; &gt; consideration (eg is some context already loaded, otherwise the timeout<br/>\n&gt; &gt; will be increased).<br/>\n&gt; &gt; This rule already exists and is registered in some abstract base class.<br/>\n&gt; Its<br/>\n&gt; &gt; working fine.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Having this amount of tests makes it very hard to make sure that every<br/>\n&gt; &gt; class is annotated with it. Also not all tests inherit from the abstract<br/>\n&gt; &gt; test class and I would like to keep it that way. It would be just some<br/>\n&gt; work<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to put the rule in every test but what about tests written in the future.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I need to make sure that the rule is applied to every test especially<br/>\n&gt; when<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the developer forgets about it. Its a rule that is intended to avoid<br/>\n&gt; &gt; developers slowing down jenkins build by writing slow tests without<br/>\n&gt; &gt; annotating them as such.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; That said using a different runner is not an option. Also we already<br/>\n&gt; have a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; hard time mixing spring-runner, mockito-runner, junitparam-runner (btw<br/>\n&gt; &gt; we/you should copy some of that behaviour as it is a lot more flexible<br/>\n&gt; than<br/>\n&gt; &gt; junit parameterized test [1])) aso-behaviour (btw: we/you need to think<br/>\n&gt; &gt; about the runner-concept. it would be a lot better to have one runner and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; registering behaviour to it (eg being able to register as many &quot;runners&quot;<br/>\n&gt; as<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I want to).<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Scanning classpath is a good thing. We already use classpathsuite [2].<br/>\n&gt; That<br/>\n&gt; &gt; enables us to create suites without having to specify all classes in it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; (another feature that would very well fit junit). We could for example<br/>\n&gt; &gt; annotate a rule with a classifier (basepacke, package or<br/>\n&gt; package.classname)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and it would get applied to everything that matches. But this kind of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; behaviour would introduce a completely new way of configuration to junit<br/>\n&gt; (a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; little cdi/spring-ish). Maybe it would be a good idea to overthink the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; junit-concept leading this direction anyway but I get the feeling its a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; little too much for this concern.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; At last I do not think the external switch is a problem as its highly<br/>\n&gt; &gt; optional. If you use it, you know what you are doing. Dont you think so?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; [1] <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://code.google.com/p/junitparams/\">https://code.google.com/p/junitparams/</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; [2] <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://johanneslink.net/projects/cpsuite.jsp\">http://johanneslink.net/projects/cpsuite.jsp</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 2013/4/29 Kevin Cooney &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kcooney@...\">kcooney@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Henning,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sorry for the lack of response. JUnit is maintained by volunteers, and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sometimes our day jobs get busy. I was waiting for David to respond (I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; am a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sometimes contributor) but here are my thoughts.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; This is an interesting idea. Note that you could get what you want<br/>\n&gt; with a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; custom runner.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; My concern with adding Rules via system properties that someone running<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; tests in their IDE would see different results compared to the test<br/>\n&gt; runs<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; from Maven. Sure, you could tell your IDE to run the tests with the<br/>\n&gt; same<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; system properties, but it would be unexpected for most people to have<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; take a special step to make the tests run the same way as they did in<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; continuous build.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Could you find some way to define the global rules via code? Perhaps<br/>\n&gt; you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; could add a DynamicRule to all of your tests that could apply the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; addition<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; rules. Alternatively, you could have a class in the same package as the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; tests that defined the global rules for tests in that package (though<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; not sure there is a platform-independent way to scan all of the classes<br/>\n&gt; &gt; in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a package that works for all runtime/deployment environments)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; -- Kevin<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; On Mon, Apr 29, 2013 at 7:09 AM, Henning Groß &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:igaffai@...\">igaffai@...</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; **<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have a use-case where I need to enable rules based on external<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; parameters.
