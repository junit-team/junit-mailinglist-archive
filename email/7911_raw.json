However, I need to make it as easy \nand seamless as possible to use. \n\nWith this aim in mind I&#39;ve written a VAJ tool to scan for tests at \nthe selected level (ie project, package or class), and run them \nautomatically. \n\nNow all the selection code works, the test classes work with the \nstandard main() running TestRunner, but I receive a \nAssertionFailedError: No tests found when run from the tool.\n\nI&#39;ve tracked it down to the isAssignableFrom() method failing in the \nTestSuite construtor. This has me confused as by the time \nisAssignableFrom() is called we have already sucessfully loaded the \ntest class to get its constructor so the class must have been found \nin the classpath. \n\nAny ideas?\n\nTIA\nMichael Rutherfurd\n\n\n\n",
