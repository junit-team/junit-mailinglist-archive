Immutable objects that have mutable objects as a\nparameter to a method can be a problem....\n\nThe Sun folks were pretty good about the immutable classes, so there\naren&#39;t any examples there. Classes that implement the GOF Flyweight\npattern will be immutable, but take some sort of Context argument to\nsome/all methods. These methods are only thread safe if the Context is\nthread safe. I supposed we could debate whether Flyweights count as\nbeing immutable.... \n\nRegards,\n\nRob\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
