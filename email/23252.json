A failure should be reported as success whereas a success should be reported as failure. This has proven to be far more interesting than @Ignore which is just a little better than removing a test: @NotYetImplemented allows to write tests for &quot;accepted&quot; bugs or future features and to get notified when they are fixed as side effect of other changes<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; - assertEquals & IDE integration<br/>\n&gt; small improvement to throw ComparisonFailure not only for String comparison what allows IDE like Eclipse to better display differences between expected and actual result.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Cheers,<br/>\n&gt; Marc.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
