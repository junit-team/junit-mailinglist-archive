But because the<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; doGet(HttpServletRequest, HttpServletResponse) and<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; doPost(HttpServletRequest, HttpServletResponse) methods have no returns,<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; and HttpServletRequest and HttpServletResponse are generated by the<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; system, I could not create JUnit tests for them.  Does anyone have some<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; experience?  Thanks a lot for the help.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; You can use HTTPUnit to run tests against the servlet.  The<br/>\n&gt; problem, however, as you point out, is that you only have<br/>\n&gt; limited visibility into the servlet, since you can only check<br/>\n&gt; the returned HTTP response to the web client.  It&#39;s gets even<br/>\n&gt; more fun when you&#39;re trying to test the behavior of session<br/>\n&gt; time outs, security and log in checks, etc.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What we&#39;ve discussed doing is to make our servlets (and JSPs<br/>\n&gt; via tag libraries) very thin layers that take the incoming<br/>\n&gt; requests and just delegate to our presentation helper classes.<br/>\n&gt; In many cases, we&#39;ll end up just passing the request and<br/>\n&gt; session objects along, but we now have a point where we can<br/>\n&gt; create the request or session objects in particular states<br/>\n&gt; (like expired session), so we can much more easily test the<br/>\n&gt; interface&#39;s behavior, plus we can use JUnit.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This isn&#39;t a silver bullet or anything, because there are<br/>\n&gt; still cases where you want to test the actual returned HTML,<br/>\n&gt; and sometimes HTTPUnit tests are the best way to do that.<br/>\n&gt; But it seems like it will make our life a bit easier for some<br/>\n&gt; other classes of presentation layer testing.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anyone else try this?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -Paul Hodgetts<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
