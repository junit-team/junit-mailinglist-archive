I think this\n  is the easiest and most straightforward solution for me at the moment\n  (assuming I can work out the correct RegEx!).\n\n  But given that this must be a common case, I really think this should\n  be pointed out somewhere in the Clover docs.  Anyway, thanks to all\n  who responded...\n\n  Pat.\n\n\n  --- In junit@yahoogroups.com, Neil Swingler &lt;neil@s...&gt; wrote:\n  &gt; \n  &gt; There are other idioms for testing exceptions which will actually be\n  supported by using clover.\n  &gt; e.g.\n  &gt; try\n  &gt; {\n  &gt;   somethingDangerous();\n  &gt; }\n  &gt; catch(Exception exception)\n  &gt; {\n  &gt;   assertEquals(&quot;message&quot;, exception.getMessage());\n  &gt; }\n  &gt; \n  &gt; in this case clover will warn you if the test passed but the\n  exception was never thrown i.e. we don&#39;t need the fail any more\n  because we&#39;ve got clover\n  &gt; \n  &gt; - Neil\n  &gt; \n\n\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  YAHOO!
