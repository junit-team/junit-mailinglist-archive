    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-730272465\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt;Background:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I have written several derivatives of java.io.InputStream and test cases<br/>\n&gt;that go along with them. However, during a recent peer review of the<br/>\n&gt;code, we discovered an inconsistency between the contract of one of the<br/>\n&gt;methods in java.io.InputStream and my implementation of that same method<br/>\n&gt;in the specialized subclass.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Problem:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I would like to have a set of functional tests (black-box style) that<br/>\n&gt;enforce the behaviors of the super class, java.io.InputStream. Then use<br/>\n&gt;that same set of tests to ensure that the basic contracts for each of<br/>\n&gt;the classes I write follow that contract (i.e. pass those generic<br/>\n&gt;tests). Does anyone have a suggestion for doing this? While this<br/>\n&gt;specific example pertains to java.io.InputStream the same scenario may<br/>\n&gt;occur with any class hierarchy.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Environment:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I use Ant to compile and run my tests, so ideally any solution will be<br/>\n&gt;compatible with the &lt;batchtest&gt; mechanism or otherwise allow for the<br/>\n&gt;dynamic (read, &quot;automatic&quot;) addition of new tests.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;----- End -----<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Ok, the pointer was for an abstract test class. I can see the<br/>\n&gt;applicability for a simple inheritance problem as the one I posted was.<br/>\n&gt;However, there is a situation where that solution does not seem to work.<br/>\n&gt;Enforcing interfaces&#39; contracts - I cannot use the same model to enforce<br/>\n&gt;three different interface&#39;s contracts (since there is no multiple<br/>\n&gt;inheritance).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t understand why this is a problem. If your class implements three interfaces, then you have three test cases for that class, each a subclass of the corresponding abstract test for each interface. Run them all. No law says you must have one test case per production class, and in fact, you probably shouldn&#39;t!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Also, only some objects implement the equals method. These<br/>\n&gt;I have a standard set of tests to ensure that null and a few other<br/>\n&gt;scenarios are handled correctly (as well as the hashcode / equals<br/>\n&gt;relationship). I would like to have these standard tests available for<br/>\n&gt;different objects without having to rewrite them all the time.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>GSBase&#39;s EqualsTester for testing equals(). JUnit-addons also has something, but I can&#39;t remember the name of it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJ. B.
