Since you&#39;re new to<br/>\nJUnit, I assume you&#39;re also new to unit testing in general. I suggest<br/>\nthat you don&#39;t want to test an EJB that has no business logic if you<br/>\nhave already tested the DAO underneath.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you *do* have business logic, then I suggest refactoring that into<br/>\nits own class (collaborating with the DAO directly, I imagine) and<br/>\ntesting *that*, since that allows you to avoid issues about testing<br/>\nwith EJB containers and so on.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut don&#39;t test the EJB code -- the stuff that&#39;s part of the EJB<br/>\nframework -- unless you&#39;re trying to reproduce a defect. It&#39;s enough<br/>\nwork to test your own code without trying to test everyone else&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck.<br/>\n<br/>\nJ. B.
