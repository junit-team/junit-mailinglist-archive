(TestNG has more &quot;test grouping&quot;\nfeatures so you may want to look into it.)\n\nAs for automating the testing, I&#39;d suggest that you look into a real\nContinuous Integration server like CruiseControl or Continuum. Cron is\ngreat for simple stuff but most people benefit from real CI.\n\nWayne\n\nOn 3/7/07, niklassaers &lt;niklassaers@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hi guys,\n&gt; for our project me and a friend are using JUnit heavily. Our\n&gt; application is a client that collects data and a backend that\n&gt; organizes and analyses it. Lately we have started to use JUnit tests\n&gt; to ensure that our database is sane, and these tests take quite a\n&gt; while. Now, I don&#39;t actually need to know that the database is still\n&gt; sane every time I recompile, so I&#39;d like to ignore them. But adding\n&gt; and removing @Ignore&#39;s will fill up our CVS repo quickly. Besides,\n&gt; I&#39;ve also set up a box to run tests from cron, and I&#39;d like to i.e. do\n&gt; most tests every 15 minutes (gives me a nice little pop-up when\n&gt; something breaks) and only run the DB sanity every four hours. How can\n&gt; I make a testing schedule? Should I do this through ANT? Can I make a\n&gt; property-file for JUnit that checks if a certain time has elapsed? At\n&gt; the moment my fileset is just &lt;include name=&quot;**/test/**/*.java&quot;/&gt;  I\n&gt; hope I don&#39;t have to make individual ant targets and list the files\n&gt; manually! :-) What are my options?\n&gt;\n&gt; Cheers\n&gt;\n&gt;   Nik\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
