    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1623476945\">Has anyone done any work on unit test for memory usage of objects?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I&#39;d like to do is write a unit tests that asserts the memory used <br/>\nby a certain object is less than a given value. Ideally I&#39;d like to do <br/>\ndeep measurements that follow a complete object graph. For example, you <br/>\nmight measure that the total memory used by a list and all its members <br/>\nwere less than 100K. However, even being able to reliably measure the <br/>\nshallow memory usage of an object without following an object graph <br/>\nmight be useful.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems to me that the issue here is not so much writing the test as it <br/>\nis measuring the memory. i.e. one would really need to hook into the <br/>\nvirtual machine at a fairly deep level. Java doesn&#39;t seem to expose this <br/>\ninformation at a high level. I&#39;ve looked at the various profiler APIs, <br/>\nbut they seem to assume you&#39;re writing your code in C, not Java.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny ideas?<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nElliotte Rusty Harold  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:elharo@...\">elharo@...</a><br/>\nXML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/\">http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim\">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim</a></div>",
