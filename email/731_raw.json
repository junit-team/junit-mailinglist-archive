We have a significant code\n&gt; base already and we&#39;re trying to move to JUnit.  What issues did you have\n&gt; when trying this yourself?  Was your testing hierarchy exactly the same as\n&gt; your application package structure?  Did you start only using JUnit with new\n&gt; development or with bugs as well?  Or did you take a month off and have\n&gt; everyone write JUnit tests?  Any help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nI pretend to do XP for one.  What I did when I started using JUnit was\nto pick an interesting existing class, and write tests for just that class,\nas a learning exercise.\n\nAll new code is written test-first (unless it&#39;s a spike.)  \n\nBefore I change a pre-existing class I write tests for it.  If it&#39;s\na big class I may write tests covering the behavior I&#39;m changing.\nIE If I&#39;m changing a method on a Java bean which deals with one field,\nand that field doesn&#39;t influence some other fields, I may not take the\ntime to write tests right now for those other fields.\n\nWriting tests for existing classes is on my @todo list but they&#39;re nowhere\nnear the top.  I have a very deep @todo list. :/\n\nIf I&#39;ve acquired new 3rd party code with sources, and it doesn&#39;t come\nwith its own tests (most don&#39;t) then I&#39;ll often write tests for the\nclasses/methods I&#39;m using, often as a learning exercise.  \n\n-- \nJoi Ellis                    Software Engineer\nAravox Technologies          joi@..., gyles19@...\n\nNo matter what we think of Linux versus FreeBSD, etc., the one thing I\nreally like about Linux is that it has Microsoft worried.
