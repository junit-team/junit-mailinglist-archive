(I don&#39;t remember the details, I&#39;m not the\ncryppie guy, but jarsigner -verify -certs -verbose shows that all the\nfiles are signed by both certs)\n\nI had a test that called a method that takes in a string and encrypts\nit with a password using a substitution algorithm. The snippet:\n\n        try\n        {\n            String provider = &quot;name.of.our.crypto.provider.class&quot;;\n            Class providerClass = Class.forName(provider);\n           \njava.security.Security.addProvider((java.security.Provider)\nproviderClass.newInstance());\n        }\n        catch (Throwable t)\n        {\n            t.printStackTrace();\n        }\n\n        SecretKeySpec s = new SecretKeySpec(cipher, &quot;SUBSTITUTION&quot;);\n        SubstAlgorithmParameters p = new SubstAlgorithmParameters();\n        // we set some parameters for this algorithm\n\n        try\n        {\n            Cipher c =\nCipher.getInstance(&quot;SUBSTITUTION&quot;,&quot;name.of.our.crypto.provider&quot;);\n\n\nAnd it was puking on Cipher.getInstance saying that the file might not\nhave been signed. So we put in some simple debugging code:\n\n            String provider = &quot;name.of.our.crypto.provider&quot;;\n            Class providerClass = Class.forName(provider);\n            Object[] signers = providerClass.getSigners();\n            if (signers == null) {\n                System.err.println(&quot;No signers!&quot;);\n                signers = new Object[0];\n            }\n            System.err.println(&quot;Signer count for &quot;+provider+&quot;:\n&quot;+signers.length);\n\nAnd sure enough, signers was null and &quot;No signers!&quot; would appear.\n\nThe same block of code, and all of our tests, run fine both naturally\nand in the textui runner.\n\nSo... there is some funky classloader thing going on here that I don&#39;t\nunderstand. I just wanted to see if this was known (I haven&#39;t found\nanything anywhere else about signed jar files yet) and what people\nthought.\n\nThanks for your time!\n\njohn\n\n\n",
