Here&#39;s my response:<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------<br/>\nI almost always just run all my tests, avoiding the problem altogether. <br/>\nBy using Eclipse or  or IntelliJ IDEA or DirectorySuiteBuilder... I can <br/>\nsimply point to a location on disk and run all the tests contained in <br/>\nthat file system tree.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I want to /permanently/ separate tests from one another -- for <br/>\nexample, slow-running ones from quick-running ones -- then I put them in <br/>\nseparate source trees. This makes it very easy to run all the <br/>\nslow-running tests in the background with CruiseControl, and run all the <br/>\nquick-running tests as part of my normal TDD cycle. Of course, I want to <br/>\nmove tests from the slow-running tree to the quick-running tree, because <br/>\nrunning more tests (all things being equal) is better.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter that, there are only two reasons I use suite(): (1) for the <br/>\nParameterized Test Case pattern, (2) to create a temporary view of the <br/>\ntests while dealing with a specific problem, such as a defect.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Parameterized Test Case needs suite() to generate tests with <br/>\nexternal fixture data, a pattern I describe in detail in _JUnit <br/>\nRecipes_, recipe 4.8. I do this more and more rarely, preferring to use <br/>\nFit instead.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for dealing with a defect, the idea is to create a suite of tests <br/>\nthat likely expose the defect and cover the surrounding area, including <br/>\nany end-to-end tests (if needed). I have found myself doing this only a <br/>\nfew times, since TDD tends to stop me from making those kinds of <br/>\nmistakes. (I make other, more interesting mistakes, but that&#39;s not on <br/>\npoint for now.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThese are the techniques and strategies I use to make suite() -- such as <br/>\nused in an AllTests class -- essentially obsolete.<br/>\n<br/>\n[Please note that, when working on legacy code, I use OrderedTestSuite <br/>\nwith suite() to tease apart tests that rely on executing in a given <br/>\norder. I just don&#39;t work on much legacy code these days, so it&#39;s easy <br/>\nfor me to forget.]<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
