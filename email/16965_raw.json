Can any one explain me from starting.\n&gt;   What is Junit. How it is Used. What is the use of it.\n&gt;\n&gt;   Thanks\n&gt;   kiran\n\nWelcome to the wonderful world of JUnit!\n\nThere are many useful websites for the JUnit user, but perhaps the two\nmain ones are http://www.junit.org/ and http://www.google.com/.\n\nThe JUnit site maintains a lot of useful information and links to\nother resources. Many of the articles there are directed towards the\nbeginner and will help you greatly as you learn about JUnit. There is\neven a link on the site called &quot;Getting Started&quot; that will take you to\na page full of useful information for those who wish to learn to use\nJUnit.\n\nGoogle is useful when there&#39;s something you need, but don&#39;t know what\nit is. Just type a description in, press enter and see how much help\nit can be. I&#39;ve found quite a few useful things that way. Another tip\nwith Google is to search on the specific error message that you have,\noften you&#39;ll find forum discussions about that exact error, with a\ngood chance of a solution being given as well.\n\nAs you learn and start having questions, you will also find the JUnit\nFAQ very helpful. The questions that it answers really are the\nfrequent ones that most of us had asked or wondered about and Mike\nClark does a wonderful job of collating it. Here is a link:\n\nhttp://junit.sourceforge.net/doc/faq/faq.htm\n\nWhen you are ready to start asking more questions on the JUnit mailing\nlist, please consider following all of the advice in Eric Raymond&#39;s\nvery helpful document: &quot;How to ask questions the smart way&quot;, available\nat his website. Here is a link:\n\nhttp://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html\n\nAs far as books are concerned, I recommend Pragmatic Unit Testing by\nHunt and Thomas for beginners. JUnit recipes by Rainsberger is good\nonce you&#39;re past the basics. There are other good books out there, but\nthese are my recommendations.\n\nI hope that this helps.\n\nSimon\n\n-- \nwww.simonpeter.org\n\n",
