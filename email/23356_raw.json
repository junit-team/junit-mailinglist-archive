They all have the same\n&gt;&gt; structure:\n&gt;&gt; 1. Create some test files and directories in an directory called &quot;source&quot;\n&gt;&gt; 2. Start the backup process (to backup the files/dirs in &quot;source&quot; to a\n&gt;&gt; directory called &quot;target&quot;)\n&gt;&gt; 3. Check whether all files in &quot;source&quot; exist also in &quot;target&quot;\n&gt;&gt; 4. Remove all files from the &quot;source&quot; and &quot;target&quot; directory so that the\n&gt;&gt; directories are empty for the next test.\n&gt; Is there any need to share a &#39;static&#39; directory across tests at all?\n&gt; May I suggest establishing a separate location for each test would\n&gt; ensure they don&#39;t ever clash, perhaps include the test name in the\n&gt; folder naming?\n&gt;\n&gt; If at some point in the future your tests are run in parallel, distinct\n&gt; testing folders would support this.\nThanks for the suggestion. Sure, that is a requirement for parallel \ntesting. But i thought it should work if i have just one source and one \ntarget directory. I will get to this later if my problem can&#39;t be solved.\n&gt; I suspect you have a timing issue or race conditions, so I would try and\n&gt; avoid any clashes and  aim to build a set of completely isolated tests.\nOk, i will check this. Maybe a reader-thread is not closed.\n\nBest regards,\n\nNils\n\n",
