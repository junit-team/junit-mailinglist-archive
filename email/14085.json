I like the idea of a<br/>\n&gt; static class to pull application properties from, but it<br/>\n&gt; makes testing more difficult. I could load the AppProperties<br/>\n&gt; object in the setUp (that is my solution to get it working<br/>\n&gt; until I get better suggestions), but it seems like the app<br/>\n&gt; should be designed a little differently.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The AppProperties methods could use a private static member to do <br/>\nthe detailed work.  And then you could use MockObject, during <br/>\ntesting, to control the static member object&#39;s behavior.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis can quickly lead to AppProperties being a Singleton.  That&#39;s <br/>\nOK; the tests can swap in a MockObject in setUp and clear or reset <br/>\nit on tearDown.<br/>\n<br/>\nSingleton is not ideal, but it can be refactored later to remove the <br/>\nSingleton-ness.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; How would something like this be handled in IoC (DI) projects? <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Other objects would accept an AppProperties instance in their <br/>\nconstructor or in a &quot;set&quot; method, and keep it in a local variable.  <br/>\nYou can migrate from Singleton to this pattern, over time.</div>",
