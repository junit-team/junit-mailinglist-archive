We are pleased to inform you that<br/>\nZephyr has come out with its new and enhanced version Zephyr v3.0<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.getzephyr.com/\">http://www.getzephyr.com/</a>&gt; , where quality intelligence meets<br/>\ncomprehensive test management.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat&#39;s New in Zephyr v3.0?<br/>\n<br/>\n    *<br/>\nCustom reports generator: Zephyr&#39;s new custom report generator makes it<br/>\nsimple for every team to be able to run any report they need. The new<br/>\nfunctionality builds on the existing out of the box functionality which<br/>\ncomes with more than 16 drill down reports and metrics.<br/>\n<br/>\n    *<br/>\nExtensive API&#39;s: Zephyr&#39;s philosophy has always been to integrate<br/>\nwith existing infrastructure and not force teams to rip one tool out to<br/>\nreplace it with another. With the new extensive API&#39;s Zephyr further<br/>\nextends the capability of its platform to support the myriad needs of<br/>\nglobal software quality teams. The web services API&#39;s are fully<br/>\ndocumented at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://developer.yourzephyr.com\">http://developer.yourzephyr.com</a><br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://developer.yourzephyr.com/\">http://developer.yourzephyr.com/</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n    *<br/>\nEnhanced productivity levels/Search Technology: Zephyr&#39;s test management<br/>\nsolution promotes a new level of organization at the release, project,<br/>\ndepartment and global level. With the 3.0 release, Zephyr debuts a new<br/>\nsearch technology that searches in the body of fields, not just in the<br/>\ntitle or subject field. Teams will achieve new levels of productivity<br/>\n<br/>\n    *<br/>\nTrend reporting: With Zephyr&#39;s new, first of its kind dynamic trend<br/>\nreports, teams now have the ability to look back at stages of former<br/>\nprojects and quantify how long it took to complete the release. With<br/>\nthis information in hand, the same teams will now able to plan<br/>\naccordingly for not only current releases, but also for future projects.<br/>\n<br/>\n    *<br/>\nEnhanced JIRA integration: Zephyr enhances its one of a kind 2-way JIRA<br/>\nintegration by supporting JIRA custom fields. Teams have always been<br/>\nable to enter, search, change, report, analyze and close any defect in<br/>\nJIRA from within Zephyr through optimized testing desktops. With the new<br/>\nrelease, teams who have customized or plan to customize JIRA will also<br/>\nbe able to leverage the robust functionality and achieve higher<br/>\nproductivity and efficiencies.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;d love to hear your opinion about Zephyr v3.0 and will be glad to<br/>\nshare more information with you.
