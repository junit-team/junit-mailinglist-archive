You <br/>\nmight as well read tea leaves.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; And it also blows up the size of the compiled code without use.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Are you guessing again?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; At<br/>\n&gt;  least for code to be transmitted over the Internet (e.g. by Java Web<br/>\n&gt;  Start or in Applets) this should be avoided too.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Who cares after compression if it&#39;s 10k or 12k? Or 100k or 110k?<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Without conditional compilation there is no other way than commenting<br/>\n&gt;  out the hundreds of assertions manually - not really realistic. This<br/>\n&gt;  keeps me from using standard test frameworks in my own projects.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Do you mean you prefer performance over correctness?<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; In my own logger I have such a global boolean flag to disable test code<br/>\n&gt;  generation.  But this also can not stop those message String<br/>\n&gt;  concatenations because these are done before passing the resulting<br/>\n&gt;  String to the internally disabled assertTrue(message, ok) method.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That sends up a bunch of red flags:<br/>\n- your own logger -- nothing else is good enough, you have to write your <br/>\nown?<br/>\n- disable test code -- do you mix test code and production code?<br/>\n- you&#39;re worried about test performance but didn&#39;t profile?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Would it be technically impossible to solve this through an annotation<br/>\n&gt;  like e.g. @EnableTestCodeGeneration? Annotations are recognized at<br/>\n&gt;  compile time.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Since you already wrote your own logger, why not write your own <br/>\npreprocessor?<br/>\nPlease let us know how many nano seconds of performance you could squeeze <br/>\nout of your production tests.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobert</div>",
