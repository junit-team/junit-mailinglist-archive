They have a &quot;jUnit macro&quot; that will embed a summary of \ntests in a wiki page. I am trying to get something a bit more \ncomprehensive, such as a test tracking system. I favor extensive tests \nand am trying to get my group to do the same, but this means I need some \ntool that will allow us to organize and track a large number of these \ntests. My manager likes Confluence (looks pretty good for a number of \nthings, actually, such as jira support) but I would like to have a \nbroader perspective on how this product might actually work with tests.\n\nSo, anyone use Confluence?\n\nThanks!\n\n\nNat Pryce wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Confluence is an &quot;enterprise&quot; wiki. I don&#39;t think it has anything to\n&gt; do with JUnit.\n&gt;\n&gt; Do you mean Concordion?\n&gt;\n\n&gt;\n&gt; --Nat\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt; http://www.natpryce.com &lt;http://www.natpryce.com&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; 2009/2/23 Jeff &lt;jjg@... &lt;mailto:jjg%40jqhome.net&gt;&gt;:\n&gt; &gt; Our group is thinking of adopting Confluence and as one of the ardent\n&gt; &gt; jUnit testers I&#39;ve been asked to investigate it.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Does anyone have any experiences (good/bad) with it? Are there any large\n&gt; &gt; projects that use it? Good places to get started on it?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks in Advance!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n\n",
