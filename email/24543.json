It just dives recursive into the object-tree and compares the properties. If a property is not equal, the property-name will be shown in the standard error / fail-message in junit. It already does what we want, but it is not open available right now and we would like to use that in several projects. <br>\n\n<br>We could create a maven-artefact in our company-maven-repository, to make it available for all projects in our company, but we think this might be usefull for everyone. Also we think that this is quite a small change and it would be far more elegant to include this in junit itself instead of creating a new artifact that has only this single feature.<br>\n\nSo we would like to contribute to junit by adding this to the Assert-class. <br><br>I hope that this is the correct group to get in touch with the junit-maintenance. I would be glad to discuss this in depth if you like the idea!<br>\n\n<br>Greetings!<br>Jan</p>\n\n    </div>\n     \n\n    \n    <div style=\"color:#fff;min-height:0;\"></div>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div></div></blockquote></div><br></span></blockquote></div></div>\n</div>",
