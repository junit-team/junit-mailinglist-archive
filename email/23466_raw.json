Each test is also described via describeChild.\n\nDuring runCh=\r\nild execution, if I create child descriptions of each child as each unfores=\r\neeable test occurs, then I get &quot;unrooted&quot; output.\n\nMy actual use-case is th=\r\nat I have a test runner executing a series of tests within an html file. I =\r\nwould have to parse the html and its associated JavaScript to determine how=\r\n many tests will be run. This would be tricky.\n\nIs there a recommended mean=\r\ns of reporting the results of tests that are not determinable in advance?\n\n=\r\nKind regards,\nChristopher\n\n\n",
