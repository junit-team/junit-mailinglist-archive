It&#39;s something we <br/>\ndiscussed in the team a while back, and management were making hopeful <br/>\nnoises about. My plan was to speak with Da Boss on Monday about all <br/>\nthis, and but I&#39;ve just this moment heard that he&#39;s out all next week <br/>\n(new baby - awww!), so it might have to wait a bit. But I&#39;m pretty sure <br/>\nI will be back to you about this, as soon as I can get to discuss it <br/>\nwith management.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m feeling much more positive now - thank you!<br/>\nThanks again,<br/>\nTracey</div>",
