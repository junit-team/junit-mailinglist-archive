I&#39;ve learned quite a bit but I&#39;m having trouble \n&gt; creating MockObjects from Classes that use Static Methods.\n\nSome of us who use Mock Objects think that they&#39;re most useful as a\ntechnique for driving your design. Static methods are hard to replace\nfor unit testing, which suggests that maybe their use is problematic.\n\n&lt;nostalgia&gt;\nof course, in Smalltalk, you can override class methods because classes\nare objects too. Sigh.\n&lt;/nostalgia&gt;\n\nA couple of solutions are to move the static methods to the instance\nside so you can attach them to an interface. Alternatively, create a\nlittle object that wraps the static code. Usually this leads you to\ncreating a context type that gets passed around and turns out to be\nReally Useful Object (Sorry, been reading Thomas The Tank Engine to my\nkid again).\n\nSteve\n\n\n\n",
