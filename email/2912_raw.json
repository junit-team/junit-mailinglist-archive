But it is simple too.\n&gt; \n&gt; Please correct me if I&#39;m wrong somewhere!\n&gt; \n&gt; JunitEE project has been very quiet but I like it!\n&gt; I like Cactus too and have difficulties in deciding\n&gt; what I want to use!\n&gt; \n&gt; Kaarle Kaila\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; gopala krishnan T wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; hello\n&gt; &gt; &gt; i would like to know, how to test session beans, i mean is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; there any process or procedure for testing session beans,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; an early reply is appreciated.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; gopal krishnan\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; ..........\n&gt; &gt; Hi ,\n&gt; &gt; I founded a framework for named Cactus testing EJB&#39;s , Servlets , \n&gt; &gt; Tag-Libs , Filters , ...\n&gt; &gt; It&#39;s a subproject from Jakarta , and it&#39;s based on JUnit\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; http://jakarta.apache.org/cactus\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
