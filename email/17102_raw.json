From the\nimplementation in TestClassMethodsRunner.invokeTestMethod() it looks like\nthe test instance cannot escape, and is available for garbage collection\nafter the test runs. This behavior is not (yet?) part of the API, however.\n \nCheers,\n \nKent Beck\nThree Rivers Institute\n\n\n  _____  \n\nFrom: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of\nDMCG123\nSent: Friday, July 07, 2006 1:07 AM\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: [junit] junit 4 @Before v constructor\n\n\n\nI&#39;ve always thought that in retrospect one of junit (&lt;4)&#39;s worse failings\nwas creating \ninstances of the test classes up front in the suite. This means that \n* the contructors of all tests are called before any tests are run, leading\nto some \ninteresting issues if any initialization is done there instead of in setUp, \n* resources created in setUp and assigned to test class fields hang around\nuntil the end of \nthe test run, kept alive by the suite\n* we get some very different behaviour running all tests in ant using\nfork=true, compared \nto running all tests in the same VM\n\nNow in junit 4 it looks like the instances of test classes are constructed\non the fly. The \nconstructor of each test instance is called just before @Before.\n\nSo my question - is this a designed behaviour? Can I assume that junit 4\nrunners will have \nthis behaviour, allowing me to use the constructor instead of @Before,\nallowing fields to \nbe final, etc? \n\nDoes anyone have experience of constructors v @Before in junit 4?\n\nFinally, is there scope for releasing the test class instances after each\ntest has run? This \nwould give us a much smaller footprint for large test suites, without having\nto assign \nfields to null in @After.\n\nThanks in anticipation\n\nDuncan Mc^Gregor\n&quot;The name rings a bell&quot;\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
