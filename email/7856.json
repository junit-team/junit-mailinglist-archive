    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1719457780\">I&#39;ve never thought about testing equals() this way, simple idea though it<br/>\nis.  I test equals() according to its contract as specified in its<br/>\ndocumentation in Object.  Joshua Bloch also explains it well in his book,<br/>\n_Effective Java_.  What I test for, then, are the following:  reflexivity,<br/>\nsymmetry, transitivity, consistency and &quot;non-nullity,&quot; to use Bloch&#39;s terms.<br/>\nI create three identical instances of a class and use them in various<br/>\nasserts.  I could share if you like.  I&#39;ll have to think about what value<br/>\nyour idea might bring to my test.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegarding an assertNotEquals() method specifically, I have not yet noticed<br/>\nthe lack of this method while writing tests.  It&#39;s clearer than using<br/>\nassertFalse() as you described.  One reason that I can think of for its<br/>\nexclusion is that it would likely need to be provided in every &quot;flavor&quot; of<br/>\nassertEquals(), virtually doubling the number of methods in Assert.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for sharing,<br/>\nCraig</div>",
