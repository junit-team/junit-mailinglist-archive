Our tests are\n&gt; &gt; a pain to maintain - takes too long to run completely in Eclipse before\n&gt; &gt; checking in; takes ~6 hours to run and report the nightlybuild (includes\n&gt; &gt; coverage testing); we&#39;re nowhere near green bar, so recognizing when\n&gt; &gt; there is something new (from yesterday) is near impossible, and possibly\n&gt; &gt; impractical (in a 40 hour work week). I&#39;m not necessarily looking for any\n&gt; &gt; answers,...but maybe someone has some insight - has been there before -\n&gt; &gt; or will just commisserate with me.  :)\n&gt;\n&gt; It&#39;s hard to imagine that unit tests for 1500 classes would take that long.\n&gt;\n&gt; Are you writing unit level tests ? Or system level tests ?\n&gt;\n&gt; What proportion of your tests hit a database/file system/network/gui ?\n\nAs a datapoint for comparison: Jena has about 1300 classes and about 4000\ntests, and running those tests takes about 50s on my machine (a 3GHz Intel\nbeast with enough memory). We have five developers, but none of us is full-\ntime on Jena nowadays. \n\nThe tests are a mixture of unit and integration tests, and touch the \nfilesystem a little and the database not at all. Running the database\ntests (which are a subset of the normal tests with the data store in\nRDB rather than memory) takes more like 15m with MySQL and comparable \nor a lot longer with Postgres. (Likely because there&#39;s a complete\nreset of the DB between each test.) Hence the DB tests get run a lot\nless often, which is sort-of OK because they&#39;re &quot;just&quot; a storage layer\nand so long as the DB presents the same (Graph) interface as memory\ndoes, everthing else should &quot;just work&quot;.\n\n-- \nChris &quot;electric hedgehog&quot; Dollin\nIt&#39;s called *extreme* programming, not *stupid* programming.\n\n\n",
