It seems that the functionality that you seek could be provided by<br/>\nhandling test return codes other than &quot;fail&quot; (or the absence of &quot;fail&quot;).  In<br/>\nprevious test harnesses, I have found it useful to bucket test statii as<br/>\nfollows:<br/>\n<br/>\n    PASS<br/>\n    FAIL<br/>\n    UNIMPLEMENTED<br/>\n    EXCEPTION<br/>\n    ABORT<br/>\n    UNKNOWN<br/>\n<br/>\nPass and fail to the obvious thing, and are the usual test status.  Tests<br/>\nthat are defined but their class implementation isn&#39;t complete, or for<br/>\nwhatever reason the test hadn&#39;t been implemented can flag themselves as<br/>\nUnimplemented.  Unexpected exceptions that can be handled by the test would<br/>\nflag an Exception status (this may seem redundant with Fail, except that the<br/>\ntest can handle the exception and continue).  Abort means that the test<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t be setup (or torn down), or had some environmental problem.<br/>\nUnknown is for good measure and is defined as &quot;none of the above&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the past, I have implemented these codes as static ints.  In the JUnit<br/>\nimplementation, Fail is denoted by an AssertionFailedError, and silence is<br/>\ngolden.<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps it would be simpler to implement these statii as additional methods<br/>\nin framework.Assert class and add corresponding vectors and methods to<br/>\nframework.TestResult?  Something like Assert.assertUnimplemented() and<br/>\nassertUnimplemented(String).  It shouldn&#39;t be too hard to teach<br/>\nframework.TestResult to tally the buckets and amend the test summary report.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\n<br/>\n_chas_<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jcarpenter@...\">jcarpenter@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Monday, March 12, 2001 1:59 PM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: [junit] todo tests in JUnit (think Perl)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I sent the following email to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@...\">junit@...</a>.  By posting<br/>\n&gt; this email I am hoping to receive additional guidance and insight<br/>\n&gt; from the JUnit community.  Please copy any responses to<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jcarpenter@...\">jcarpenter@...</a>.<br/>\n&gt; ______________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; We are finding that there are times when it may be desirable to check<br/>\n&gt; into source control code that is not fully implemented.  The tests<br/>\n&gt; may be defined, but the corresponding class implementation may not be<br/>\n&gt; complete.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Perl&#39;s standard framework has the concept of a todo test.  A simple<br/>\n&gt; enough way to notate such a test in JUnit would be to name a method<br/>\n&gt; within a test todoBlah, rather than testBlah.  To safely go down this<br/>\n&gt; road, it is desirable to extend JUnit to report on what todo tests<br/>\n&gt; are in the code base in addition to the normal tests.  I am<br/>\n&gt; considering writting such an extension and contributing it back to<br/>\n&gt; the JUnit project.  Unfortuantely, I don&#39;t know where in the JUnit<br/>\n&gt; code base to start.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Can you provide guidance as to what classes would need to be changed<br/>\n&gt; to support this functionality?  Do you have any suggestions<br/>\n&gt; to improve the idea?  Ideally this can fit into JUnit&#39;s normal<br/>\n&gt; extension framework.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thank you for your time and consideration.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Jimmy Carpenter<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jcarpenter@...\">jcarpenter@...</a><br/>\n&gt; __________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Erik Meade kindly responded with the following:<br/>\n&gt; *******************<br/>\n&gt; Jimmy,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I think the class you want to start with is junit.framework.TestSuite.<br/>\n&gt; Take a look at the constructor which accepts a Class.  I believe this<br/>\n&gt; is where the tests get loaded by reflection...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If you want more input I would suggest you post this to the JUnit<br/>\n&gt; group,<br/>\n&gt; which you can sign up with from the junit.org page, and/or a forum on<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sourceforge.net/projects/junit/\">http://sourceforge.net/projects/junit/</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; Erik Meade             <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:emeade@...\">emeade@...</a><br/>\n&gt; Senior Consultant      Object Mentor, Inc.<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.junit.org\">http://www.junit.org</a><br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
