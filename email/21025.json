My<br/>\nadvice to people spending grief to clean up after each test anyway is<br/>\nto stop doing that.<br/>\nAfter all, the next test will be run on a new instance anyway so why<br/>\nbother to clean instance data?<br/>\n<br/>\nI totally ignore cleaning up instance state after myself since I know<br/>\nit&#39;s not needed (unless there is something particulary expensive that<br/>\nI am doing but I cant recall any good example of that at the moment so<br/>\nI&#39;d consider that rare).<br/>\nThe other case where I might reluctantly use @After is if I have some<br/>\nshared resources such as file resources that I don&#39;t want to have<br/>\nlying around but I have come to prefer cleaning up in @Before to the<br/>\npain of acidentaly forgetting to clean after some test in those cases.<br/>\n<br/>\nIsolation scores pretty high on my list, at the moment I rely on it<br/>\ncompletely. To answer your question about how many tests would break<br/>\nif the instance was shared I must confess, I have no idea, I assume<br/>\ntoo many  considering that I spend 0 effort restoring state and I<br/>\ndon&#39;t want that extra possibility to consider when tests do break. On<br/>\nthe other hand, If no fixture was ever setup in the constructor or,<br/>\nmore commonly, when the field is declared I&#39;d have to admit that<br/>\nsharing an instance would probably not be an issue. Tools like PMD<br/>\ncould find those situations by static analisys and a rule could be<br/>\nadded to fail those tests in the build...<br/>\n<br/>\nSo there is a way to convert to shared instances that i would be<br/>\ncomfortable with given some clear benefit of doing so, now what is the<br/>\nbenefit?<br/>\n<br/>\n/J<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Thu, Oct 23, 2008 at 4:20 PM, Cédric Beust ♔ &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cbeust@...\">cbeust@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; On Thu, Oct 23, 2008 at 2:20 AM, Joakim Ohlrogge<br/>\n&gt; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:joakim.ohlrogge@...\">joakim.ohlrogge@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; I think that there would be some unhappy JUnit users out there if we<br/>\n&gt;&gt; got one instance shared between all tests in the class.
