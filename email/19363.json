I have a<br/>\nCruiseControl machine doing continuous integration, and occasionally<br/>\nsomeone writes a unit test that hangs, which also hangs the entire<br/>\nCruiseControl process.  Because the test process never completes, I<br/>\ncan&#39;t tell which test hung.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I could set a default timeout, something generous like 5 minutes,<br/>\nthen hanging tests would eventually fail and everything would wrap up<br/>\ncleanly.  Perhaps a system property would fit the bill.</div>",
