The jsp page \ncontains two text fields. In that page only i am calling bean method \nwhich makes a SELECT query to the DB. I am populating those two text \nfields by the result of this select query.\nAll java code are embedded as a scriplet.\nSo how can i go about testing jsp pages? \nPls help me. Do any one know some good sites which explains in details \nhow to test jsp pages?\nThanks well in advance.\n\nShrikant \n\n\n\n\n\n",
