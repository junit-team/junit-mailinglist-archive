Hmmm... there&#39;s maybe a little \nmisint=\r\nerpretation there, yes... I was assuming that it was the same \nperson writi=\r\nng the code and the tests, NOT two different people. \nBut I&#39;d got the size =\r\nof the cycle wrong, I think. I&#39;d guessed that \nyou&#39;d write tests for everyt=\r\nhing a class does, then code the class to \nsuit. But that&#39;s not what you&#39;re=\r\n saying, is it...\n\nIn your world, you write a test class that just tries to=\r\n make an \ninstance of the real class. But it won&#39;t compile, so you make the=\r\n \nclass and then the test class does compile, and the test works. \nThen you=\r\n write a test that tries to run a method, but now the test \nclass won&#39;t com=\r\npile again because that method doesn&#39;t exist yet. So \nyou write the method,=\r\n and now the test compiles. \nThen you add to that test to say what you expe=\r\nct the method to \nreturn, and the test fails. So you write the code in the =\r\nmethod and \nnow the test passes.\nAnd so on, in teeny-tiny steps?\n\nWell, I c=\r\nan now see how this can practically be used! And those rules \ndo help to ma=\r\nke it clearer. Thank you. And thanks for the FIT \npointer, too...\n\nBut, thi=\r\nnking about it, maybe this cold be a problem to work with, \nwhen you&#39;re try=\r\ning to make a big structure with other developers? \nBecause this builds up =\r\nfrom the bottom quite slowly, if I&#39;ve \nunderstood it. Doesn&#39;t it take a lon=\r\ng while before it&#39;s usable in any \nway?\nWe&#39;re typically making a whole stru=\r\ncture, with DA, DTO, Domain \nobject, MVC layer and SOAP service. One of the=\r\n benefits of using \nInterfaces for us, and making whole classes at a time, =\r\nis that we can \ncode the Interface for the DAO and Domain Object, offering =\r\neverything \nwe&#39;d need, and use those in the other objects, then fill in the=\r\n \ndetail in the actual classes. That way, we can work together on one \nenti=\r\nty. This would be a bit difficult to do if we built it this way, \nbuilding =\r\nup bit by bit from the bottom, wouldn&#39;t it?\n\nOr maybe I need to think about=\r\nthis some more...\n\nCheers\nTracey\n\n\n\n\n",
