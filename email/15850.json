If you&#39;re writing an<br/>\napplication that will dominate the user environment, yes, being memory<br/>\nhungry isn&#39;t a crime. If it needs to co-exist with several other<br/>\napplications, then it is.<br/>\n<br/>\nA server app running on a dedicated box can do what it wants. A Java<br/>\nGUI app to process shipping orders that needs to be able to accessed<br/>\nalong with Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, and Outlook all runing<br/>\nas well needs to be more parsimonious. A SWT application designed to<br/>\nrun as a status-bar extension probably can&#39;t even afford the overhead<br/>\nof the JVM.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven if the application is &quot;worthy&quot; of the extra memory, it may not be<br/>\ncheaper to give it the memory. If you intend to deploy the application<br/>\nto 10,000 machines in a corporate environment, the $50,000+ in parts<br/>\nthe memory upgrade will cost (before installation!) lets you afford a<br/>\nfew _months_ of improving the memory usage.<br/>\n<br/>\nContext is crucial in any optimisation debate.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\n               &quot;Software is too expensive to build cheaply&quot;<br/>\nRobert Watkins           <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://twasink.net/\">http://twasink.net/</a>           <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:robertdw@...\">robertdw@...</a></div>",
