Sun \n&gt; sugests to run \n&gt; the Java application without the &quot;assert&quot; option to increase \n&gt; speed.  So \n&gt; you cannot be sure that your application will _always_ run in the \n&gt; &#39;assert&#39; mode.  Using the _optional_ &#39;assert&#39; mode to \n&gt; validate something \n&gt; that is _not_ optional (parameter&#39;s value) is IMO a big mistake.\n\nThat&#39;s the key distinction, IMHO.\n\nI use assertions in my own classes, where the inputs should already have\nbeen validated. A few seconds of typing can protect against all sorts of\nerrors (particularly null references!).\n\nHowever, it doesn&#39;t cut the mustard where inputs can come in from outside.\nSo, if you&#39;re building a remoted component, or an API to be used by someone\nelse, or a user-interface, etc, etc, you need more explicit parameter\nchecking. These should throw appropriate exceptions;\nIllegalArgumentException is good for APIs, probably okay for remote objects,\nbut pretty bad for user-interfaces.\n\nNote that you explicitly handle exceptions, you should test that the\nexceptions do get thrown; the exceptions are a stated part of your object&#39;s\n&quot;contract&quot;, after all. However, testing assertions isn&#39;t worth it. One of\nthe big benefits of assertions is that they let you avoid a whole heap of\nstupid error checking tests (&quot;Does this behave well if I give it a null\nvalue?&quot;)\n\nRobert.\n\n-- \n                 &quot;Software is too expensive to build cheaply&quot;\n  Robert Watkins           Software Architect          QSI Payments Inc.\n  robertdw@...                 robert.watkins@...\n\n\n\n",
