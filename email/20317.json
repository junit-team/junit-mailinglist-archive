Twice in two days, I  <br/>\nhave found a use for something which junit doesn&#39;t seem to provide. I  <br/>\nwanted to check if I was doing something wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a couple of similar classes A, B, C, that implement the same  <br/>\ninterface. So I create test classes TestA, TestB and TestC. But all  <br/>\nthe tests in these are really the same, with just different setup. So  <br/>\nI&#39;d like to create a base test class, BaseTest. I&#39;ll put all my @Test  <br/>\nmethods here. In TestA, TestB and TestC, I&#39;ll just have my @Before  <br/>\nmethods. When I try to get junit to run my TestA/TestB/TestC, it  <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t find any tests, because it appears to be looking for tests in  <br/>\nthose classes only and not any superclasses. The best I&#39;ve been able  <br/>\nto do is to override the same test methods in TestA, TestB and TestC,  <br/>\nwhere each method simply calls the corresponding superclass method.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m using junit 4 and doing this in eclipse. Anything wrong in what  <br/>\nI&#39;m doing/assuming ? I&#39;ve checked the FAQ and done some google  <br/>\nsearches, but didn&#39;t find anything.<br/>\n<br/>\n      thanks<br/>\n<br/>\n      Srinivas<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
