B. Rainsberger [mailto:jbrains@ro=\r\ngers.com] \n&gt; Sent: Saturday, June 26, 2004 5:07 PM\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.=\r\ncom\n&gt; Subject: Re: [junit] Control test order in base test case hierarchy.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; Ray Tayek wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Suite.addTest(SuperClass.suite()) seems to dtr=\r\nt, but it  seems that you\n&gt; &gt; *must* roll up up your tests in the subclass =\r\ni.e. in the supbclass, you\n&gt; &gt; must: suite.addTest(SubClassTestCase(&quot;nameOf=\r\nTestInSuperClass&quot;));\n&gt; \n&gt; Ah, yes. I may have misspoke (miswritten) earlier=\r\n. Remember \n&gt; that classes do not inherit class-level methods, like suite()=\r\n. Could that \n&gt; be related to your problem?\n\nI was not clear, the tests get=\r\n run when you roll &#39;em up in the superclass\ntest case, but they *are* insta=\r\nnces of that super class (not the sub class).\nAnd I was supplying different=\r\n flavours of a test fixture (as well as testing\ndifferent sublcasses) to th=\r\ne super class test case by overriding a\ngetTestObject() in the super class =\r\ntest case that normally returned null.\nOnce I rolled up the tests in the su=\r\nb class test case, the correct test\nfixture was used by the test methods in=\r\n the super class. This works fine.\n\nBut it is a bit ugly/complicated, since=\r\n I have guards in some of my tests in\nthe super test case that check for a =\r\nnull test fixture as well as test for\nwhether I an testing a subclass or no=\r\nt. The idea was to have a test case\nhierarchy that mirrored the class hiera=\r\nrchy that was being tested. This has\nhaving common (for the super class and=\r\n all subclasses) tests there. So if\nthe mirrored class (of the super test b=\r\nase) is concrete the super test case\ncan roll up a concrete instance of his=\r\n mirror and test that mirror. The\nalternative is to have an abstract test c=\r\nase in between the two that just\nhas common stuff for the sub test cases. T=\r\nhis of course breaks the mirror :(\n\nthanks \n\n\n\n",
