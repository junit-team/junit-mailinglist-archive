It has direct support for fakes/stubs.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; EasyMock 1 had default return values/throwables for that,<br/>\n&gt; EasyMock 2 has stub return values/throwables for that.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>So jMock &gt; EasyMock1, but jMock ~ EasyMock2 with regard to support for <br/>\nfakes.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  &gt; 2. It makes ignoring method parameters easy.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I agree, This was a major pain in EasyMock 1.<br/>\n&gt; The rationale behind this was that I found no way to make<br/>\n&gt; this refactoring-safe (reordering parameter refactorings should<br/>\n&gt; not break the test). In EasyMock 2, matchers can be defined<br/>\n&gt; directly in the method calls, allowing to ignore arguments,<br/>\n&gt; match only parts of an argument, and so on.<br/>\n&gt; You may even define your own matchers.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That sounds like an improvement. Since jMock&#39;s comparative <br/>\nrefactoring-unfriendliness is not a big cost for me, I&#39;m not moved to <br/>\nswitch to EasyMock2.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  &gt; 3. Its support for complex parameter, method or invocation matching is<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; great.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; EasyMock 2 has much better support for that. Argument matchers<br/>\n&gt; are in my opinion better. Inter-mock dependencies can be defined.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I would have to look at this.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  &gt; If there is ever a 2nd edition of _JUnit Recipes_, I will replace all<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; the EasyMock example code with jMock.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; As the author of EasyMock, I am sad to hear that.<br/>\n&gt; Can you elaborate which features are missing in<br/>\n&gt; EasyMock 2 that are so crucial that you consider switching?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It&#39;s not a question of what&#39;s missing in EasyMock2. The reason is that <br/>\nsince 2003, I&#39;ve been using jMock exclusively as my dynamic mock objects <br/>\nlibrary, so that&#39;s what I know best. If I get on a project where they <br/>\nalready use EasyMock2, I&#39;m sure I&#39;d get used to it quickly and would <br/>\nprobably enjoy it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  &gt; The people who don&#39;t like jMock often say it&#39;s because declaring the<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; method names as strings makes refactoring more error-prone. That might<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; be the case, but I have never felt pain as a result of it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s not only a problem when renaming methods.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Reordering, adding, or removing parameters all break tests at runtime,<br/>\n&gt; and you have to adapt them manually to the new situation.<br/>\n&gt; Tests using EasyMock work after reordering and removing<br/>\n&gt; parameters, and after adding parameters if no matchers were used.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>See above: you&#39;re right, but I find the cost to be low.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; And there is also the issue of code completion when defining expectations.<br/>\n&gt; With JMock, it does not work, you have to rely on text completion features.<br/>\n&gt; With EasyMock, it works like a charm.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I do admit that this is a shortcoming, but I don&#39;t find that annoying <br/>\nwhen I use jMock. In fact, in an odd way, if I find I really want code <br/>\ncompletion when defining fakes or expectations, then perhaps my <br/>\ninterface is too complex. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps.<br/>\n<br/>\nTammo, don&#39;t get me wrong: I really appreciate what EasyMock 1 did for <br/>\nme for 2 solid years, and EasyMock 1 is immortalized in _JUnit Recipes_. <br/>\nIt&#39;s just that I preferred jMock 1.0 to EasyMock 1, and I haven&#39;t had <br/>\nthe need to leave jMock yet. EasyMock 2 doesn&#39;t pull me and jMock 1.x <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t push me away.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
