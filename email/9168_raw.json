How much value? What is business value? Unless your definition\ncontains definable\nquantities then your definition is vague and ambiguous.  Who determines the\nbusiness value?\nDo you go out and get ROI numbers on the projects you do for your customers?\nOr is business\nvalue a feel good thing that you and your customer agree on at the end of\nthe project?\n\nThank you\n\nMichael Holly\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: J. B.

They are not similar.\nInstead, compare building software to product design and try again.\n&lt;snip /&gt;\n\n&gt; Now correct me if I am wrong (I&#39;m sure you will) but better software\n&gt; development\n&gt; is about\n&gt;\n&gt; definable, documentable interfaces,\n&gt; modularization,\n&gt; testing ... repeatable testing,\n&gt; frameworks,\n&gt; patterns,\n&gt; components,\n&gt; automated documentation\n&gt; etc.\n\nNo. Better software is about delivering business value faster. The\nthings you list help us get there, but that list changes over time. They\nare just today&#39;s tools.\n\n&gt; All of these concepts drive toward &#39;uniform&#39; results.  Even this\nnewsgroup&#39;s\n&gt; purpose\n&gt; is about promotion of software that allows repeatable testing.  Better\n&gt; software development\n&gt; is completely about bringing &#39;uniformity&#39; to the process.\n\nI don&#39;t like this, but I can&#39;t articulate an alternative. I&#39;m working on it.\n\n&gt; If you have a definition of &#39;better software&#39; then please supply it\n\nAbove. Software is better if it brings more value to my customer faster.\nMore value in the same time or same value faster would each also be better.\n\n&gt; This\n&gt; definition\n&gt; has to exist, otherwise, you have no standard to compare your latest\nproject\n&gt; to validate\n&gt; that it is better.  The feedback you are getting from this comparison will\n&gt; make *gasp* your\n&gt; process better!\n\nXP is not about defining a process; it is about building up a toolkit\nand learning how the tools work and when to use them. Judgment remains\nthe key ingredient and a defined process *encourages* me to *ignore* my\nown judgment.\n--\nJ. B.
