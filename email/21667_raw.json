It does get deep, and\nin some cases, compiler-dependent, if I remember correctly.\n\nHowever, we did find that in some cases, the signature of the\n_Matcher_ could be improved.  What&#39;s the signature of hasEntry?\n\nThis is also pushing me to keep on my &quot;Dotmesh&quot; project, which would allow this:\n\nassertThat(result.entrySet()).contains(entry(&quot;Key&quot;, Date.class));\n\n[if the &quot;entry&quot; factory convenience method were written]\n\nThanks,\n\n   David Saff\n\n",
