I&#39;m \nrather disappointed.  Here is the readme:\n\n-------------------\nThis is experimental software, use at your own risk, you have been \nwarned.\n\nKnown Problems:\n\nClasspath.  I haven&#39;t been able to figure out how to get the \nTestRunner to use the Vaj Classpath.  This means you have to export \nyour tests into the junit directory under ide&#92;tools.  It&#39;s a pain, \nI&#39;ve experimented with Worspace.setClassPath, which has been \nresulting in a java.lang.InteralError when trying to load the test.\n\nDefault packages don&#39;t work well.  You can run the test, but double \nclicking on a failure won&#39;t open up the Class Browser.  the default \npackage information needs to be saved before passed on to JUnit, and \nused again when opening the Class.  Shouldn&#39;t be that difficult to \ndo, but in light of the other problem, it doesn&#39;t seem worth the \neffort.\n\n\nInstallation:\n\nShut down VisualAge for Java\nUnzip VajJUnit.zip into your VisualAge for Java ide&#92;tools directory.\nStart VisualAge for Java.\n\n\nUsage:\n\nExport your test(s) to the ide/tools/junit directory.  (See Known \nProblem classpath)\nRight click on the packages whose AllTests you want to run, or right \nclick on the Test you want to run.\nSelect JUnit.\nSelect package or test run.\nWhen a test fails and you double click on the TestFailure (not the \nstack trace, the failure) a Class browser for that test should be \nopened.  Can&#39;t take you to the exact line of the failure, don&#39;t see \nhow it possible to do so.\n\n\nNotes:\n\nI modified JUnit slightly (hence the 3.5vaj version name), I changed \nthe scope of junit.swingui.TestRunner.fTestRunViews from private to \nprotected, so I could add a MouseListener to the JList which contains \nthe failures.\n\n\nErik Meade\nemeade@...\n\n\n\n",
