So I thought why not auto generate some <br/>\ntest cases? I dont mean all of them since testing is creative <br/>\nwork...but surely the basic few?<br/>\n<br/>\nStressed,<br/>\nJimm<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, Ilja Preuss &lt;it@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; junitheadache schrieb:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I am currently working on auto generation of test cases for TDD <br/>\nfor <br/>\n&gt; &gt; my honors year project.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Why? I mean, besides that you need to do a project - what tells <br/>\nyou that <br/>\n&gt; it would be a good idea?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; How much experience do you have with TDD?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Curious, Ilja<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
