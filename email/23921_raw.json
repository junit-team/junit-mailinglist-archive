T=\r\nhe problem with the retry is that since the same statement is reused, the f=\r\nields will not be re-initialized between retries.\n\nI&#39;ve tried to find a sol=\r\nution to this. It looks to me like I would have to create my own test runne=\r\nr to achieve this, which ideally I would like to avoid.\n\nAm I correct in th=\r\nat I have to create a custom test runner, or can it be done in some other w=\r\nay?\n\n\nThanks\n\nDaniel\n\n\n",
