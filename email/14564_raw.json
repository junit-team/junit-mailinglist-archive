But perhaps this is &#39;BAD&#39; (tm)?\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; I value testing, so I generally do whatever it takes to\n&gt;  &gt; make code testable. Not everyone values testing as much\n&gt;  &gt; I do, especially compared to other considerations, so\n&gt;  &gt; they do other things.\n&gt;  &gt; --\n&gt;  &gt; J. B. (Joe) Rainsberger\n&gt; \n&gt; I value testing also. But I guess I&#39;m in the latter group that finds\n&gt; other considerations to be of greater importance. I&#39;m not happy with\n&gt; stating it that way. I think there is a fundamental interconnectedness\n&gt; (in more than a Dirk Gently sort of way) between design and a lack of\n&gt; testability. It seems good designs should be inherently testable. If\n&gt; one&#39;s design attitude is test-first then the two are holistic. Even\n&gt; symbiotic.\n\nJBR&#39;s postulate 1. For every testable design that requires exposing \nelements &quot;just for testing&quot;, there exists an equivalent testable design \nthat does not require exposing elements &quot;just for testing&quot;.\n\nIn other words, if I add a method &quot;just for testing&quot;, I can usually find \na way to restructure the design so that that method either earns its \nkeep or goes away. I don&#39;t have a specific example right now, because \nwhenever I see one, I don&#39;t have time to write about it.\n\n&gt; What I&#39;m talking about here is green-field development. Legacy code,\n&gt; as always, trumps best intentions. Sometimes small changes can be made\n&gt; that both improve the design and testability. Sometimes changes one\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t ordinarily accept must be tolerated for the short term to\n&gt; improve testability to the point that more sweeping design changes can\n&gt; be made with confidence. But if this is consistently happening in new\n&gt; development then I suggest stepping back and reconsidering essential\n&gt; OO design principles.\n\nThe flip side is that I don&#39;t value access visibilility keywords. I \ndon&#39;t find them useful. If all data were private and all methods were \npublic, that would be fine, as is the case in Smalltalk and the default \nin Ruby. In Java, I use interface/implementation separation instead of \npublic/protected/private, because the former helps me for other reasons, \nanyway.\n-- \nJ. B.
