Or am I seeing something wrong? Or is\n&gt; it impossible to JUnit-test file creation?\n\nChristian,\n\nI&#39;ve worked on two different projects that created PDF files. We had\nunit tests for both projects, and found little difficulty doing this.\n\nWe did have a couple tests that caused pdf files to be created on the\ndisk, but these were more like acceptance tests or integration tests.\n (In these projects, we did not strongly distinguish between\nunit/integration/system/acceptance tests.)\n\nBUT, each time we added a capability to the PDF generator, we tested\nthat capability.  Usually, that meant creating the pdf snippet either\nas a String, or by writing the snippet to a Writer/OutputStream.\nSomething like &quot;Does the pie chart generator produce the proper pdf\nfor this case? For that case?&quot;\n\nhth,\nEric\n\n\n",
