ONLY 12 DAYS LEFT TO WIN AN <br/>\niPOD NANO! <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are an active user/contributor to a company wiki, consider <br/>\ntaking this survey and have your name entered into a raffle for an <br/>\niPod Nano! <br/>\n<br/>\nhttp://emarshall2.usc.edu/ultimatesurvey/takeSurvey.asp?surveyID=419 <br/>\n<br/>\nTake a moment and read these questions: <br/>\n<br/>\nHave you thought about how your use of corporate wikis compare to <br/>\nother people using corporate wikis? <br/>\nHave you wondered if other people contribute to their company&#39;s wiki <br/>\nfor the same reasons you do? <br/>\nHave you wondered why some people are comfortable editing others&#39; <br/>\nstuff on wikis and others are not comfortable doing it? <br/>\nIs there anything about your company&#39;s use of wikis that bothers <br/>\nyou? <br/>\nHave you ever been interested in contributing to research that is <br/>\ngoing to help identify lessons learned about how to enhance <br/>\ncorporate use of wikis? <br/>\nDo you have any interest in winning an iPod Nano? <br/>\nIf you answered any of these questions &quot;yes&quot;, then consider taking <br/>\nthis survey by November 15th and be entered into a drawing for a <br/>\nfree iPod Nano. Why not give it a try? <br/>\n<br/>\nThis survey is being conducted by Dr. Ann Majchrzak, Marshall School <br/>\nof Business, University of Southern California and Dr. Christian <br/>\nWagner, City University of Hong Kong. We&#39;ve been asked by the <br/>\nSociety for Information Management&#39;s Advanced Practices Council (a <br/>\nprofessional society of Chief Information Officers in the U.S. (see <br/>\nhttp://simnet.org)) to conduct a survey of active (contributing) <br/>\ncorporate wiki users. We will use your responses to identify lessons <br/>\nlearned about how to enhance corporate use of wikis. By corporate <br/>\nwiki, we mean a wiki used in a company to further the goals of that <br/>\norganization. Such a wiki might be used for tasks including R&D, <br/>\nproject management, helpdesk activities or knowledge sharing.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThank you for your time!<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nAnn Majchrzak, PhD<br/>\n<br/>\nProfessor of Information Systems<br/>\n<br/>\nMarshall School of Business<br/>\n<br/>\nUniversity of Southern California<br/>\n<br/>\nLos Angeles, CA  90089<br/>\n<br/>\nmajchrza@...</div>",
