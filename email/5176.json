Should it?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; The only problem is that a single form could have its behavior driven <br/>\n&gt;&gt; by<br/>\n&gt;&gt; some data lying inside the depth of the application itself.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yes, in nearly every application, when something happens deep within the<br/>\n&gt; application, the gui is used to communicate with the user.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; The main fact stil remains: do you all have successfully used JUnit in <br/>\n&gt;&gt; order<br/>\n&gt;&gt; to make GUI testing?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We come full circle to the first question I asked this morning - what <br/>\n&gt; do you<br/>\n&gt; want to test? GUI is too big - what specifically about the GUI do you <br/>\n&gt; want<br/>\n&gt; to test? You CAN test everything except aesthetics. I try very hard to <br/>\n&gt; move<br/>\n&gt; any logic out of the gui (and you really do have to work at it) and<br/>\n&gt; someplace where I can test it, and rely on visual inspection to test the<br/>\n&gt; gui.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; Robert Koss, Ph.D.     | Training, Mentoring, Contract Development<br/>\n&gt; Senior Consultant      | Object Oriented Design, C++, Java<br/>\n&gt; www.objectmentor.com   | Extreme Programming<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
