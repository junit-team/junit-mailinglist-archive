    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-407800543\">I&#39;m only just starting to look at adding a couple of features to <br/>\nJUnit so I can&#39;t help with the question concerning the Protectable <br/>\ninterface.  One of the enhancements I am interested in making <br/>\nhowever is something along the lines that jpulley is describing - <br/>\ni.e. allowing a test to continue following an assertion failure.<br/>\n<br/>\nInitially I just want the tests to continue so that I can get <br/>\nsome kind of indication about how many assertions are failing <br/>\nin each test case.  Longer term I am thinking that it may be <br/>\nuseful to be able to indicate whether or not particular assertion <br/>\nfailure should cause a test case to halt - this might be on a per <br/>\nassertion basis (perhaps a little tedious) or via some other <br/>\nmechanism (say a flag that can be set to indicate whether <br/>\nor not the next failure should end the test case).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe motivation for this extension is that most test cases <br/>\ncontain a whole bunch of assertions following the code <br/>\nthat is being tested.  I am actually writing several hundred <br/>\ntest cases for code written by someone else - working <br/>\nthis way it makes much more sense to test a feature to <br/>\ndeath in a single test case rather than writing a separate <br/>\ntest case for each aspect of a feature.  I have test cases <br/>\nthat include 100 assertions with up to like 80 failures <br/>\n(I currently have to comment out lines containing failures <br/>\nin order to continue processing).  Writing 100 separate <br/>\ntest cases would not be practical and would actually <br/>\nmake the test results harder to interpret.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt would be interesting to hear jpulley&#39;s approach - any chance <br/>\nof you providing some guidance on what needs to be <br/>\nchanged?<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\n<br/>\nScott<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\nFrom: &quot;Sharmila &quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sharmila_pillai@...\">sharmila_pillai@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@egroups.com\">junit@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Thursday, January 04, 2001 12:43 AM<br/>\nSubject: [junit] Re: Protectable - why?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Hi, <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  Could you throw some light on &quot;extending JUnit to permit deferred <br/>\n&gt; collection of assertion failures&quot;...am a newbie and havn&#39;t a clue how <br/>\n&gt; to go about this.<br/>\n&gt; Would appreciate any help.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks in advance,<br/>\n&gt; Sharmila.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@egroups.com\">junit@egroups.com</a>, jpulley@c... wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Does anyone know why the Protectable interface is needed in the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; design of JUnit?  Why couldn&#39;t they just put the call to runBare() <br/>\n&gt; &gt; directly in runProtected()?  I&#39;m extending JUnit to permit deferred <br/>\n&gt; &gt; collection of assertion failures (so selected tests can continue if <br/>\n&gt; an <br/>\n&gt; &gt; assertion fails), and although the extension works I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m <br/>\n&gt; &gt; missing something. </span></blockquote></div>",
