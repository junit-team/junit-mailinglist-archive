I want a WYSIWYG HTML editor to write weblog <br/>\nentries. All I need to do is write the weblog entry, then switch to the <br/>\n&quot;Source&quot; view, then copy the contents into my weblog entry form. I have <br/>\ntried four different HTML editors for the Mac before I found one that <br/>\ndidn&#39;t suck. Mostly, here is how they have sucked:<br/>\n<br/>\n  * One of them wouldn&#39;t insert a new &lt;p&gt; tag when I pressed ENTER; it <br/>\nwould assume I meant &lt;br&gt;<br/>\n  * One of them would insert a bunch of &lt;br&gt; tags in my code samples <br/>\n(surrounding by &lt;pre&gt; tags), which doesn&#39;t actually work properly in all <br/>\nbrowsers<br/>\n  * Two of them didn&#39;t do WYSIWYG even remotely well.<br/>\n  * One of them inserted &nbsp; instead of regular spaces inside &lt;pre&gt; tags<br/>\n<br/>\nAll these products probably have loyal followings--dozens, hundreds, <br/>\neven thousands of users--and yet they have simple, silly problems that <br/>\nwould easily have been fixed by the slightest amount of attention to <br/>\nadhering to the HTML standard. The tests don&#39;t get any easier than that.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo we, as a user community, don&#39;t demand enough of software teams. If we <br/>\ndemanded more, programmers would have little choice but to test more.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s an open question to me whether that day will ever come, but I have <br/>\nfound that TDD makes me so faster, not slower, so I get to market sooner <br/>\neither way.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ.
