But it doesn&#39;t look like I can use inheirit from Suite or Parent<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Runner for example because they both are looking for a class.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; You can actually give pass Suite a null for the parent class, and then<br/>\n&gt;&gt; a list of subclasses.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Right, but given below then the subclasses have to be known at<br/>\n&gt; discovery time, right? Or can we simply have the class *name* at that<br/>\n&gt; time? IOTW, appropos below, do all classes also have to be loaded at<br/>\n&gt; discovery time, or are we simply building an arbitrary tree for which<br/>\n&gt; the actual test classes can be loaded and instantiated at runtime?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The API for Runner is<br/>\n<br/>\ngetDescription()<br/>\nrun()<br/>\n<br/>\nJUnit&#39;s built-in Suite runner does indeed load the referenced classes<br/>\nin the getDescription() phase.  If you write your own custom runner,<br/>\nyou have total control over what computation to do in each phase.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; But the trick<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; of course is that needs to be deferred until test run-time.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Does the test discovery step _need_ to happen inside a test computation? Why?<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; I have a feeling we have a mismatch of assumptions.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yes, or expectations. My dilemma is that it doesn&#39;t make sense for me<br/>\n&gt; to go through trying to put this kind of harness together without<br/>\n&gt; knowing wether it is possible, but it&#39;s a lot to expect that someone<br/>\n&gt; who would actually know wether it was possible would want to take the<br/>\n&gt; time to understand what I&#39;m trying to do. :D So the short answer is<br/>\n&gt; yes, I need or really really want this and I&#39;ve thought it through<br/>\n&gt; quite a bit. The long answer...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In a way JUnit&#39;s raison d&#39;être is the philosophy that one should<br/>\n&gt; specify *a priori* and statically what is expected and then check that<br/>\n&gt; that indeed happens, right? So a lot of the architecture quite<br/>\n&gt; understandably carries that simplifying assumption. BUt.. it begins to<br/>\n&gt; get more confused as we add leverage through model-driven / generative<br/>\n&gt; techniques. I&#39;m working at a bit of a meta-level here -- there are<br/>\n&gt; tests that ensure things like wether the classes are actually<br/>\n&gt; generated correctly and doing so with an arbitrary set of targets; but<br/>\n&gt; we are *also* actually generating the test code that exercises that<br/>\n&gt; target code. There is an aspect to the code-gen process that gets<br/>\n&gt; switched on and adds test annotations, potentially in-line asserts and<br/>\n&gt; so on either by specializing the target code generated classes or by<br/>\n&gt; creating proxies. I want the discovery of test methods so that we<br/>\n&gt; ensure coverage for newly generated model behaviors and to ease<br/>\n&gt; maintenance.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Why can&#39;t all of this happen during getDescription()?<br/>\n<br/>\n   David Saff</div>",
