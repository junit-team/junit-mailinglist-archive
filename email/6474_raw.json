Our tests are around a server which is started and configured\nsuch that the tests can run against the server.  We&#39;re currently\nstarting and configuring the server as part of the base test class&#39;s\nconstructor, but since we don&#39;t currently allow more than one instance\nof our server to be running at a time, we cough up some errors.\n\nThis isn&#39;t a major problem per se, but I&#39;m looking to get a greater\nunderstanding of how jUnit works w.r.t. this situation and learn if\nanyone else has had a similar situation and how they&#39;ve resolved this\nissue for themselves.\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nTom Robbs\n\n\n\n",
