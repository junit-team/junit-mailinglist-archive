In short, I could\n&gt; make @Ignore @BeforeClass declare the class malformed, with specific\n&gt; directions to the developer about how to accomplish what they want.\n&gt; Would that meet the actual pain point?\n\nNot bad. You could issue a &quot;doesn&#39;t do what you think it&#39;d do&quot; warning \nin this case.\n\n&gt; It&#39;s of course not impossible to change JUnit to have well-formed,\n&gt; somewhat well-formed, and not-at-all well-formed classes, but I&#39;m not\n&gt; yet convinced that there&#39;s pain pushing me in that direction.\n\nInstead of thinking of the well-formedness of the test, just think of \nthe correct use of the annotation. &quot;@Ignore has no effect here.&quot;\n\n&gt;  &gt; but at the\n&gt;  &gt; same time, users are quite logically trying to use @Ignore in a context\n&gt;  &gt; you didn&#39;t intend, but that nevertheless makes sense to them, and in\n&gt;  &gt; general.\n&gt; \n&gt; Very true, and I hadn&#39;t given that enough credit yet.\n\nI feel you: I don&#39;t like to deal with that stuff, either, in general. \nDamn users.\n\n&gt;  &gt; If @Ignore-ing a @Test stops the test from running, then why doesn&#39;t\n&gt;  &gt; @Ignore-ing a @Before stop the before from running? This is, perhaps,\n&gt;  &gt; why I wouldn&#39;t support @Ignore, but would rather just ask the test\n&gt;  &gt; writer to remove the @Test annotation when he doesn&#39;t want the test to\n&gt;  &gt; run. I don&#39;t know that @Ignore provides better results than removing the\n&gt;  &gt; @Test annotation temporarily.\n&gt; \n&gt; Is this a separate issue? Are you suggesting that, given the choice,\n&gt; you would not have included @Ignore, with the attendant reminder to\n&gt; un-@Ignore sometime in the future, in JUnit at all? I&#39;m curious about\n&gt; that position, but first want to make sure if it is your position.\n&gt; Thanks,\n\nI would certainly not have included @Ignore as a decorator annotation of \n@Test. Especially in light of this, I would want to change it to \n@IgnoreTest /replacing/ @Test, as that better reveals the intent behind \nthe annotation. As long-time readers here know about me, I favor \nfeatures that reflect the intent of JUnit as a TDD tool, and I don&#39;t see \n@Ignore as reflecting that intent. @Ignore is more of a regression \ntesting feature.\n\nTake care.\n-- \nJ.
