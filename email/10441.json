What if I have a class that has a small section of code that is repeated constantly in the class. The way I was taught back in the day was to pull that section code out and make it a private member to enhance code readability and security (singular updates).<br/>\n\tThis code snipped is not really suitable for an interface. Likewise it should not be made a public class simply because it is only a bit of code reduction. We have a section of code that assembles a filepath string based upon some parameters given and its own given values. Its not a big method, but it does a bit of simple logic and string concats. However, we put it in its own method so that when changes occur (and they have over time) that we only need to update one spot; thus avoiding the problems with changes not being carried through to all applicable sections.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nclass foo {<br/>\n<br/>\n\tpublic method_1(String param1) {<br/>\n\t\t// some tasks<br/>\n\t\tString value = repeatMethod(newVari);<br/>\n\t\t// some tasks<br/>\n\t}<br/>\n<br/>\n\tpublic method_2(String param1) {<br/>\n\t\t// some tasks<br/>\n\t\tString value = repeatMethod(newVari);<br/>\n\t\t// some tasks\t}<br/>\n<br/>\n\t...&lt;snip&gt;...<br/>\n<br/>\n\tpublic method_n(String param1) {<br/>\n\t\t// some tasks<br/>\n\t\tString value = repeatMethod(newVari);<br/>\n\t\t// some tasks<br/>\n\t}<br/>\n<br/>\n\tprivate String repeatMethod(String newVari) {<br/>\n\t\t// some tasks<br/>\n\t\treturn anotherVari;<br/>\n\t}<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n}<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nChip<br/>\n-----<br/>\n&quot;I&#39;m sure looters don&#39;t call it looting.

Make the class public.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hey..<br/>\n&gt; Thanks a lot.. I appreciate the help. I am not the developer of the<br/>\n&gt; xmlInfo.. I am just the tester of the entire application and the<br/>\n&gt; developers have made that it in such a way that no one can access<br/>\n&gt; it. So, I think the only way that can be tested is if i put my<br/>\n&gt; testclass is the samepackage with xmlinfo.. Is that right?.. I<br/>\n&gt; cannot make the class xmlInfo public. It is out of my reach..<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The usual assumption is that you&#39;re testing code you can change, so the <br/>\nusual advice will be to change to code to make it easier to test.<br/>\n<br/>\nAsk the developers what their concern is about client code being able to <br/>\naccess their classes. Maybe they have nothing to worry about. Beyond <br/>\nthat, they ought to consider using Interface Segregation instead of the <br/>\ndreaded visibility keywords.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the class is package-visible, then placing the tests in the same <br/>\npackage -- even if in a different source tree -- will do. It&#39;s not my <br/>\nfavorite solution, but it will do.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
