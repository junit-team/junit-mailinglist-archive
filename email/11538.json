    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1161364342\">Greetings,<br/>\nThis is true.  I recall reading about that &#39;trap&#39;, and I can<br/>\ndefinitely agree that&#39;s where the breakdown is.  For my<br/>\nproject, there are (imo) very well-defined, good reasons<br/>\nto test like this.  (A small one of which is that it was the<br/>\nperfect way to build the server structure in a &#39;test-first&#39;<br/>\nmanner, a much larger one is knowing the precise<br/>\nperformance implications of each functional unit of the<br/>\nprogram.)  They have nothing to do with JUnit&#39;s mission,<br/>\nhowever, and everything to do with mine as a developer.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd you hit the nail on the head as well, when noting the<br/>\nfunctional vs. unit aspect of it.  I have a small set of tests<br/>\nthat test the overall correctness, and then the larger<br/>\nfunctional tests that *call* the smaller tests, in order to<br/>\nreuse test knowledge.  (Don&#39;t Repeat Yourself.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI am trying to do both with JUnit, under the theory that whenever<br/>\nI make a change, I re-run the test suite and if it works, then I&#39;m<br/>\ncomfortable that I&#39;m not going to have to deal with QA, because<br/>\nmy test suite is sufficiently complete and similar to actual<br/>\napplication use that (barring infrastructure issues) my code will<br/>\nJust Work.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the answer is that what I&#39;m trying to do is beyond the scope<br/>\nof JUnit.  A small mod to JUnit would let me do it, but that mod<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t ever be accepted into JUnit-proper because it&#39;s effectively<br/>\nscope creep.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis actually makes me feel a lot better about making a local mod<br/>\nto JUnit.  I normally hate to do something like that without feeding<br/>\nthe patch back, but my project needs are just different than the<br/>\ntarget for the JUnit project.  I need tests, and I have them, but I<br/>\nalso need the performance numbers that I get, as well as higher<br/>\nlevel functional tests, as well as &#39;behavior under load&#39; tests.  You<br/>\ncan&#39;t do that with the basic JUnit framework.  It&#39;s absurd to claim<br/>\nI *shouldn&#39;t* do the other tests, as more tests are good, but I&#39;ll<br/>\neasily agree that it&#39;s clearly not what JUnit was designed for.<br/>\n<br/>\nThankfully small changes to JUnit make this completely possible<br/>\ninside its framework, and since it&#39;s not under active development,<br/>\nI don&#39;t have to worry about rolling in new versions.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere really are no other well-supported (by tools, at least)<br/>\ntesting frameworks out there, so if I want to do the kind of<br/>\ntesting I *need* to do, my choices are to build an entirely<br/>\nnew framework (which then won&#39;t integrate with other<br/>\nprograms like IntelliJ), or extend the quality work already<br/>\ndone.<br/>\n<br/>\n--  Morgan Schweers<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Ilja Preuss&quot; &lt;preuss@d...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; cypherfox wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Greetings,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I asked about a few feature enhancements, or more accurately<br/>\n&gt; &gt; if anyone had any reasons they shouldn&#39;t be done, or what<br/>\n&gt; &gt; testing paradigm I might be missing that made them wrong...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Well, the paradigm that Junit follows and with which you seem to<br/>\nhave<br/>\n&gt; problems is that a testcase should be a full standalone test<br/>\nscenario<br/>\n&gt; and shouldn&#39;t depend at the results of other testcases at all.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It might be that you are fallen into the &quot;a test method should test<br/>\na<br/>\n&gt; single method call&quot; trap (it shouldn&#39;t, it should test a single,<br/>\nsimple<br/>\n&gt; test scenario); or perhaps your tests are too big and more on the<br/>\n&gt; functional side than the unit side to be handled effectively using<br/>\n&gt; Junit.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What do you think?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Cheers, Ilja </span></blockquote></div>",
