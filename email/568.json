This one is a religious battle.  The answer depends upon how dearly<br/>\nyou love encapsulation philosophy.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to test the private method directly, one method is to<br/>\nprovide a more-accessible test method which exercises the private<br/>\nmethod.  Your unit test would call the more-accessible test method.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother method is to inspect the class for more-accessible methods<br/>\nwhich use the private method, and craft a test which excercises the<br/>\nprivate method via the more-accessible method.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your method is using default access, create a test class which<br/>\nextends the class and write tests on/for the test class.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe method I use for my current project is to just set the private<br/>\nmethod to protected instead of private.  My project doesn&#39;t have<br/>\na published interface outside the company, so anyone who misuses<br/>\nprotected methods is within easy reach of my big, fat cluebat.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy unit tests sit in the same package (but not the same project<br/>\ndirectory) as the classes under test, so my unit tests can access<br/>\nanything which is public or protected.  Works great.  The few<br/>\nitems I really do have set private are usually <br/>\nthings-that-can&#39;t-possibly-break, anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJoi Ellis                    Software Engineer<br/>\nAravox Technologies          <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:joi@...\">joi@...</a>, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:gyles19@...\">gyles19@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\nNo matter what we think of Linux versus FreeBSD, etc., the one thing I<br/>\nreally like about Linux is that it has Microsoft worried.  Anything<br/>\nthat kicks a monopoly in the pants has got to be good for something.<br/>\n           - Chris Johnson</div>",
