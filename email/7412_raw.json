However, i couldn&#39;t specify all the possible\n&gt; outputs right?\n&gt;\n&gt; so how to do method testing?\n\nClassical testing theory knows the concept of &quot;oracles&quot;, i.e. programs which\nwill compute the expected output of a test for a given (dynamically)\ncomputed input. Bob Binder has dedicated a whole chapter of his oo-testing\nbook to this topic.\n\nHowever, in cases like yours, building an oracle would basically mean to\nduplicate the algorithm of your trimA() method which is not a reasonable\nthing to do for a developer testing her own code. Proceed as suggested in\nanother post: Choose a couple of examples which make you feel comfortable\nwith your implementation. In most cases testing is the art of finding the\ncrucial set of examples.\n\nIn a sense test-driven development is about finding the minimal (or\nreasonably small) crucial set of examples.\n\nJohannes\n\n\n",
