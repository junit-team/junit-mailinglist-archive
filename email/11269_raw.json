Whilst not the only \ntool on the market right now, EMMA strives to be different by being \nvery lightweight, flexible, and fast.\n\nIn fact, speed is one of EMMA&#39;s signature features. Besides using a \nfast bytecode processor (~2ms/class), EMMA can do instrumentation \nincrementally or even &quot;on-the-fly&quot;, without a special preparation \nphase.\n\nEMMA&#39;s mission is to move code coverage from an infrequent release \ngate (possibly run on a dedicated &quot;coverage&quot; machine because the \nlicense is too expensive for the entire team) to the domain of agile \ntesting and development (&quot;check coverage while still writing \ntestcases and *before* you check code in&quot;). Coupled with a very \nliberal license, EMMA is a tool that provides code coverage stats as \nan easy side effect of unit testing itself.\n\nEMMA is free/open source and at the same time coded from a commercial \nsoftware developer&#39;s point of view: it works in any (not just the \nlatest and greatest beta from Sun) Java 2 runtime and scales to very \nlarge projects (the largest single instrumentation run so far covered \n20000+ classes). It has no external dependencies and is not tied to \nany particular testing framework.\n\nEMMA home page: http://emma.sourceforge.net\nEMMA SourceForge project page: http://sourceforge.net/projects/emma/\n\n\n\n\n",
