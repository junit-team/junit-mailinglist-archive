The other error in my \nmessage is that you instantiate objects not classes--glad no one dinged me \non that.  :-)\n\nJust as a data point, I ran the OPs code in Eclipse 3.1.1 under jre1.5.0_05 \nand experienced the same test failure he had.  So I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s simply a \nJava 1.4 vs. Java 1.5 thing.  Of course, Eclipse uses its own compiler . . .\n\nJeff\n\n&quot;Jon Skeet&quot; wrote:\n\n&gt; The problems with calling overridden methods in a constructor are\n&gt; particularly nasty when it comes to inner classes - and *very* nasty\n&gt; for anonymous inner classes which use variables in the declaring method.\n&gt;\n&gt; There was a change to the Java compiler (and the byte code spec, if I\n&gt; remember correctly) to allow certain fields to be initialised *before*\n&gt; the call to the superconstructor - fields such as those effectively\n&gt; taken from the declaring method for anonymous inner classes, and the\n&gt; hidden field containing the reference to the &quot;parent&quot; instance for all\n&gt; inner classes.\n&gt;\n&gt; Now, I can&#39;t find where the change is documented unfortunately - I\n&gt; thought it was a feature in 1.4, but I can&#39;t see it in the release\n&gt; notes. Anyway, I suspect that we&#39;ll find the OP was using an older\n&gt; version of javac than I am, hence the difference.\n&gt;\n&gt; In the light of this, I would after all agree with the idea that using\n&gt; an overridden method in a constructor puts you in no man&#39;s land, at\n&gt; least in the case where you&#39;re using an inner class.\n&gt;\n&gt; Jon\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
