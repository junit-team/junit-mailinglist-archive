It&#39;s healthy to ask the original<br/>\n&gt; poster if this design is really necessary, but if they say &quot;yes&quot;, then<br/>\n&gt; we should just move on to solving their problem and not patronize them<br/>\n&gt; on how pure their architecture is.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Cedric, I don&#39;t know whether you actually read the entire discussion, <br/>\nbut /not once/ did I criticize the design of the production code. What I <br/>\ntold the OP a few times was that he was /misusing/ inheritance of test <br/>\ncase classes in JUnit, and it took him a while to see that I might have <br/>\na point worth worrying about. Not once did I suggest his production code <br/>\ndesign was bad. Not once. All I said was that inheriting test case <br/>\nclasses in JUnit without wanting to inherit the test methods was silly <br/>\nand that he could have the benefit of sharing test fixture data without <br/>\ninadvertently sharing test methods.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; In real life, faulty or imperfect designs are the norm.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Cedric, you just said in the previous paragraph that I shouldn&#39;t <br/>\npatronize. Now you patronize me. Maybe your message carries less <br/>\nstrength that way. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If a framework forces you to change your design to be useful, you can<br/>\n&gt; bet that most companies will keep their design and choose another<br/>\n&gt; framework.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I can also bet that a large segment of the population will fork over a <br/>\nbunch of money to see the latest Will Smith film, but that doesn&#39;t make <br/>\nit a good film. Popular, yes; good, not necessarily.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
