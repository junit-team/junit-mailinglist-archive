I&#39;m working on a client/server app so I ended up<br/>\nessentially faking the data from the server that the client reads in order<br/>\nto test the client component by itself.  In addition, I added integration<br/>\ntests that have the client accessing the server and parsing its output<br/>\nlive.  The two sets of tests tell me different things.  If I only had the<br/>\nintegration tests, it would be more difficult to tell where the problem is<br/>\ncoming from although not impossible.<br/>\n<br/>\nMocking up the real world objects carries some risk, of course.  Namely<br/>\nthat the real world objects will change before you can update the mock<br/>\nones, and then your tests are out of date and possibly giving false<br/>\nindicators of success.  Or that the mock implementations will have bugs<br/>\nand also give false indicators of success or failure.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn reality, whether to do one or both depends on how much time you have<br/>\nand which will provide greater value.  Don&#39;t forget the downstream<br/>\nmaintenance consequences.  That is project-dependent and only you can<br/>\nanswer that.<br/>\n<br/>\nJeremy<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJeremy Schertzinger<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jeremys@...\">jeremys@...</a></div>",
