What happens is that I have a custom runner that suppresses the test (these are slow tests, so they are only run at check-in, not by the developer while developing).<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, when I replace that with a Rule, the setup method is still run (looks slow). So I guess the conclusion is that @Rule can&#39;t interrupt or override the setup and teardown process, so if you need to do that you are back to a Runner? (Or making your own setups rule-aware I guess).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, David Saff &lt;david@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yishai,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I just ran a test, and the Rules in the superclass were picked up.<br/>\n&gt; Can you post a small example?
