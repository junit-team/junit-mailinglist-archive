I have heard this is good for testing.\n\nYes, it is.\n\n&gt; So let me explain what I am trying to do. I am building my first web\n&gt; services application but sticking with POJOs in the service layer\n&gt; initially. I want to create a web service for a postcode lookup servlet\n&gt; we already have. This servlet produces XML output but the code to\n&gt; connect and send in paramters is all done manually (the author did not\n&gt; know about web services at the time).\n&gt; \n&gt; So here&#39;s my initial design.\n&gt; \n&gt; public interface PostcodeService {\n&gt;     public String getAddressAsXML(String postcode);\n&gt; }\n&gt; \n&gt; now, should I write a test class against the\n&gt; interface(PostcodeServiceTest) or against the implementation\n&gt; class(PostcodeServiceImplTest)?\n\nI never start with an interface. I assume you want to test the behavior \nof the implementation of the Postcode service. In that case, do you even \nneed to extract an interface yet? When do you think you&#39;ll need the \ninterface? Probably when it&#39;s time to expose the service as a web \nservice. Worry about the interface then. In the meantime, test-drive \nPostcodeService.\n\n&gt; Now calling the underlying postcode servlet actually costs money so I\n&gt; know I will need to produce a mock version of it also. So do I create a\n&gt; test class for this also(PostcodeServiceMockImpl)?\n\nI&#39;m confused here. Are you /building/ PostcodeService? or using it?\n\nIf you&#39;re building it, then you&#39;d only fake/mock/substitute it when you \nwanted to test something else that uses PostcodeService. Don&#39;t worry \nabout it until you get there.\n\nIf you&#39;re using PostcodeService, then I&#39;m still confused and can&#39;t offer \nmore advice.\n\n&gt; Thats 3 potential test classes and also they will probably be very\n&gt; similar. Is that right? I can also see when I come to code DAOs i will\n&gt; be in a similar situation since I will probably want to mock db access\n&gt; (perhaps the mock will return hard coded values).\n\nCheck out my weblog (diasparsoftware.com/weblog) and look for an entry \ncalled &quot;When to fake, when to mock.&quot; It might help you understand how I \nuse those two concepts in interaction testing.\n\n&gt; I am spending way too long thinking about this rather than writing code\n&gt; which has me a bit worried.\n\nTest-drive your implementation of PostcodeService. If that \nimplementation uses other expensive services, hide those behind \ninterfaces and fake/mock them. When you&#39;re done, decide whether you need \nto extract an interface from PostcodeService to publish. Does that help?\n-- \nJ. B.
