In this case, we take \ndata in from many customers and map it to a semi-standard format that \nis stored in a DB in an obfuscated XML format that you access via \nobjects already deployed by the platform.\n\n  I do not need to test if I can grab a field, or anything like \nthat....what I need to be able to do, is test that when a client \nsends in some data, that it always contains required fields.\n\n  You would think this could be done by testing the input data, but \nthat would be very difficult because of the various formats of data \nand the engine that is used to parse that data.  I don&#39;t want to test \nif the data is in the stream, I need to test if the data made it to \nthe DB.\n\n  So what I&#39;m trying to do is use jUnit and some plugin derivatives \nto access the DB and grab a batch of data and go through \neach &quot;record&quot; and determine if it contains those required fields.  \nI have been successful in opening up a DB connection using jUnit++ \nwhich I think I can persist throughout the test suites.  Where I am \nstruggling is how to get my Tests to:\n\n- Grab a batch, and then cycle through the objects related to that \nbatch, running every test on each object\n\n- Organizing the TestSuites.  I&#39;m not really sure how to get them to \nproperly cascade down.  For example, I have the DB connection, but \nI&#39;m not sure where that should be placed.\n\nHopefully someone else has had to perform this semi-functional semi-\nunit test.  A Testing Suite like this would help tremendously to \nregression test during maintenance efforts.\n\n-Mike\n\n  \n\n\n",
