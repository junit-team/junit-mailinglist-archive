For example, I have a fairly <br/>\n&gt; straightforward DAO and I want to test the create method.  <br/>\n&gt; But to really test it, I need to retrieve it afterwards and <br/>\n&gt; make sure it was successfully created.  And I need to clean <br/>\n&gt; it up afterwards (or the test will fail next time I run it <br/>\n&gt; and try to create a duplicate), so I call my delete method. <br/>\n&gt; There I&#39;ve exercised 3 methods of my DAO, not just one.  So <br/>\n&gt; it feels like it would save time to assert that each step of <br/>\n&gt; the process succeeded.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Example:<br/>\n&gt;   public void testEmployeeCRUD()<br/>\n&gt;   throws Exception<br/>\n&gt;   {<br/>\n&gt; \tint sizeBeforeAdding = em.listEmployees().size();<br/>\n&gt; \t_employeeId = em.createEmployee(_fname, _lname, _jobtitle);<br/>\n&gt; \t<br/>\n&gt;         int sizeAfterAdding = em.listEmployees().size();<br/>\n&gt;         log.debug(&quot;Created employee &quot; + _employeeId);<br/>\n&gt;         //Make sure that the new list is longer than the old list<br/>\n&gt; \tassertTrue(&quot;Create employee failed&quot;, <br/>\n&gt; sizeAfterAdding&gt;sizeBeforeAdding);<br/>\n&gt;                <br/>\n&gt;         Employee emp = em.getEmployee(_employeeId);<br/>\n&gt;         assertEquals(&quot;getEmployee failed&quot;, emp.getLName(), _lname);<br/>\n&gt;         log.debug(&quot;Retrieved employee &quot; + emp.getLName());<br/>\n&gt;                 <br/>\n&gt;         em.deleteEmployee(emp);<br/>\n&gt;                 <br/>\n&gt;         int sizeAfterDelete = em.listEmployees().size();<br/>\n&gt;                 <br/>\n&gt;         //Make sure that the length of the list after delete <br/>\n&gt;         //is the same as it was before we added<br/>\n&gt;         assertEquals(&quot;Delete employee failed&quot;, <br/>\n&gt; sizeAfterDelete, sizeBeforeAdding);<br/>\n&gt;         log.debug(&quot;Deleted employee&quot;);<br/>\n&gt;     }<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The preceding code works just fine.  If the test fails, I&#39;d <br/>\n&gt; look in the failure message to see which part of it failed, <br/>\n&gt; and it seems like that&#39;s not too difficult.  I know it&#39;s not <br/>\n&gt; following best practices because it calls 4 separate methods, <br/>\n&gt; but when I tried writing a test for each of those methods, I <br/>\n&gt; ended up either calling the other ones in the setup/teardown <br/>\n&gt; or by essentially recreating them in a sample data loading <br/>\n&gt; operation.  I&#39;m trying to do good TDD and to convince a <br/>\n&gt; colleague who resists unit tests at all, so I don&#39;t want to <br/>\n&gt; do things &quot;wrong&quot; but I also don&#39;t want to make life <br/>\n&gt; tremendously more difficult without understanding the real <br/>\n&gt; reason behind the recommendations.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Does anyone have any thoughts on this principle?  I <br/>\n&gt; appreciate the intelligent exchanges I&#39;ve seen on the list in <br/>\n&gt; the past so I hope to get a thoughtful discussion going.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks very much!<br/>\n&gt; Julie<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
