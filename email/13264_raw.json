My hierachical requirement is\n&gt; moved out as hierarchical helpe=\r\nrs that are creating test\n&gt; objects (similar to ObjectMother pattern sugges=\r\nted by IIja).. how\n&gt; does it sound..? \n\nDoesn&#39;t sound ideal, but like it&#39;s =\r\nprobably the best you can do if you don&#39;t\nwant to touch the app&#39;s design.\n\n=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Let us not question the design for testing..\n&gt; \n&gt; I didn&#39;t mean to be r=\r\nude here.\n\nNo rudeness implied. Still, please notice that not wanting to qu=\r\nestion the\napp&#39;s design when encountering testing problems is unlikely to l=\r\nead to\noptimal results. Problems in test design most often just are a resul=\r\nt of\nsuboptimal app design.\n\n&gt; But I wanted to imply that\n&gt; the app design =\r\nis done this way for various reasons.\n\nCertainly. I&#39;d bet, though, that it&#39;=\r\ns possible to find a design that\nconforms to both the needs of testing and =\r\nthose other reasons, and that most\nexperienced OO developers would say that=\r\n such a design is better.\n\n&gt; But the\n&gt; tests has to be written around the e=\r\nxisting app design.  The\n&gt; issue in question was the test design not the ap=\r\np design.\n\nThen the issue is how to write unit tests for a suboptimally des=\r\nigned app. I\nhope you can now understand why Junit doesn&#39;t strive to suppor=\r\nt that very\nwell out of the box - most Junit practitioners simply prefer to=\r\n improve the\napp&#39;s design in those cases.\n\nCheers, Ilja\n\n\n",
