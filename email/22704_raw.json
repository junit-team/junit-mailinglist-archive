Configuration from objects=\r\n grabbed from\nannotated fields or methods has already been done incidentall=\r\ny at\nseveral points throughout the codebase (i.e. @Parameters, @DataPoints,=\r\n\n@Rule).  We realized that this new runner would represent a commitment\nto =\r\nthe idea that this was a worthwhile design pattern, but found it\nless surpr=\r\nising _within the context of junit_ than the alternatives.\nIf you have a sk=\r\netch of a different design, I&#39;d be happy to discuss\nit.\n\n&gt; The bottom line =\r\nis that the new design direction is great, providing substantial flexibilit=\r\ny and power while keeping things simple.\n\nThanks!\n\n   David Saff\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Thank=\r\n you very much.\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In junit@yahoogroups.com, David Saff &lt;david@...&gt; wr=\r\note:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; All,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; So Categories seemed to get some people excited\n&gt;&gt; (h=\r\nttp://www.google.com/search?q=3Djunit+categories&tbs=3Dqdr:w3), but we\n&gt;&gt; c=\r\nouldn&#39;t help feeling that we&#39;d gone about it the wrong way. =A0From the\n&gt;&gt; =\r\ndesign perspective, why have a whole Runner just for filtering by\n&gt;&gt; catego=\r\nry? =A0There are other things you can filter on. =A0And, there were\n&gt;&gt; some=\r\n definitely hackish parts of the implementation. =A0And, it turns\n&gt;&gt; out, t=\r\nhere were bugs in Categories, (such as\n&gt;&gt; http://github.com/KentBeck/junit/=\r\nissues#issue/74) that were very hard\n&gt;&gt; to elegantly fix with the current d=\r\nesign. =A0And, (sorry, maven\n&gt;&gt; hopefuls), but we were anxious to get back =\r\ninto the meat of the code.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; So, the first 4.9 snapshot is up today, wi=\r\nth a new way of specifying\n&gt;&gt; suites, called SuiteBuilder. =A0SuiteBuilder =\r\nallows for flexible\n&gt;&gt; specification of where to find the classes containin=\r\ng tests, and how\n&gt;&gt; to filter the resulting runners.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; This suite class=\r\n lists the explicit test classes to consider running,\n&gt;&gt; and then filters i=\r\nt down to only those tests or classes annotated with\n&gt;&gt; `@Category(Yes.clas=\r\ns)`:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0 @RunWith(SuiteBuilder.class)\n&gt;&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0 public s=\r\ntatic class OnlyYes {\n&gt;&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 @Classes\n&gt;&gt; =A0 =A0 =\r\n=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 public Listed classes=3D new Listed(Yes1.class, Yes2.cl=\r\nass, No1.class);\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 @RunnerFilter\n&gt;&gt; =A0 =A0=\r\n =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 public CategoryFilter filter=3D CategoryFilter.include=\r\n(Yes.class);\n&gt;&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0 }\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; We hope to soon include other implement=\r\nations for the @Classes\n&gt;&gt; annotation, including a classpath-searching test=\r\n gatherer. =A0Other\n&gt;&gt; implementations for @RunnerFilter also make sense (i=\r\nf you look close,\n&gt;&gt; you&#39;ll see that RunnerFilter implementations can also =\r\nre-order\n&gt;&gt; runners, as well as selecting them).\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Please have fun, and=\r\n let us know how it works for you. =A0Thanks,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; =A0 =A0David Saff\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
