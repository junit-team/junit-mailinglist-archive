Normally (prior to abbot) I&#39;d dig about my code to<br/>\n&gt; locate the appropriate code, create a test case (or cases) to<br/>\n&gt; highlight the bug and drive the fix appropriately. Now I have a UI<br/>\n&gt; fault that is easy to reproduce - and I&#39;ve created a test case using<br/>\n&gt; abbot to highlight the fault, and can now dig through the code and<br/>\n&gt; fix it... but... this fault (as with a couple of other UI faults)<br/>\n&gt; resolves down to a failing implementation of some DocumentListener<br/>\n&gt; logic.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>&quot;Real&quot; (complex, non-trivial) UIs have this amazing ability to tease<br/>\nout problems with backends :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; So should I (would you) keep TDD the fix via the high level UI test<br/>\n&gt; case, or drill down and write &quot;lower&quot; level test cases for the<br/>\n&gt; DocumentListener implementation. The former helps solve the current<br/>\n&gt; bug, the later also fixes the bug but has better coverage of the<br/>\n&gt; listener (which could be/is reused)? Or should I duplicate the test<br/>\n&gt; to test both the UI working correctly and the listener being<br/>\n&gt; implemented correctly? I don&#39;t like the idea of duplication, and I<br/>\n&gt; prefer using non UI tool testing (because of the quicker round trip<br/>\n&gt; effect), but it seems that I probably do need both tests<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Fortunately, a rhetorical question:<br/>\n<br/>\nJonathan Oddy Mon, 7 Jun 2004 16:13:21 +0100<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Well I&#39;ve settled on the following:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; 1) Keep the UI test (it drives the UI implementation and tests that<br/>\n&gt; code from a constrained input perspective).<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; 2) Drill down and write specific tests for the underlying logic<br/>\n&gt; implementation (if applicable).  In this case it was because the <br/>\n </span></blockquote>underlying<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; listener didn&#39;t have any test code for it.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; 3) Implement (2) and check the fix (1).<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve chosen this because my current fault *didn&#39;t* have any test<br/>\n&gt; code for (2) and when added - I only got a green bar!? So closer<br/>\n&gt; inspection of (1) I noted that I was actually wrapping a number of<br/>\n&gt; DocumentListeners to get the effect I desired - unfortunately I was<br/>\n&gt; add them in the wrong order. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You might consider<br/>\n<br/>\n4) expose API to getEffectDesired() and then testGettingEffectDesired<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; So whilst (1) on its own would have worked, I like (2) as well<br/>\n&gt; because the listener can be used in a number of different ways and<br/>\n&gt; (1) only tests a specific usage.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Another thing to consider: which is more stable, your UI or your<br/>\nbackend? If the latter, esp if you expect to expose it more ways in<br/>\nfuture (e.g. as a service), you should definitely put more test effort<br/>\ninto it--over time you will &quot;spread the overhead.&quot; But if your UI is<br/>\nmore stable, and you expect to &quot;forklift-replace&quot; the current backend,<br/>\nthen I might not bother.</div>",
