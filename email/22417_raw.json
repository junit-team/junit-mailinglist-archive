You will need to use t=\r\nhe /combination/ to restrict threadCount. Since you&#39;re a selenium user you =\r\nWILL need to limit threads, which means you *cannot* get by with just junit=\r\n 4.7+, but you *will* need ConfigurableParallelComputer.\n\nI will update the=\r\n surefire docs to be a bit clearer on this restriction.\n\nI know at least th=\r\nree selenium projects that are doing exactly what you want. Most run with p=\r\narallel=3Dclasses and a thread restriction, since this allows a smooth numb=\r\ner of concurrent tests, something that is good for your grid. My current fi=\r\nrefox runs went from 45 minutes single thread to 8 minutes concurrent, so t=\r\nhere&#39;s definitely a huge upside.\n\nThis does not mean it&#39;s a simple task, si=\r\nnce most selenium test suites are not written with concurrency support in m=\r\nind. Quite frankly, if you think getting surefire/junit to work is hard you=\r\n can rest assured that the worst part is still ahead of you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Non-tex=\r\nt portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
