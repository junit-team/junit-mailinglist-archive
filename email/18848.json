I expected to talk a little about Theories and<br/>\n&gt; assertThat, but we ended up having a wide-ranging discussion about a variety<br/>\n&gt; of topics. I mind-mapped the result and put in on the conference wiki:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.agileopennorthwest.com/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?FutureOfUnitTesting\">http://www.agileopennorthwest.com/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?FutureOfUnitTesting</a> <br/>\n&gt; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.agileopennorthwest.com/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?FutureOfUnitTesting\">http://www.agileopennorthwest.com/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?FutureOfUnitTesting</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The most surprising result to me was the interest in language features for<br/>\n&gt; testing-what would a language look like that included double-checking as a<br/>\n&gt; first-class concept? I was also surprised at how much commonality there was<br/>\n&gt; between the unit and functional testing &quot;vendors&quot;, that reporting is a big<br/>\n&gt; issue for everyone.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; One thing missing from the discussion was much talk about the hopes and<br/>\n&gt; dreams of users, so I thought I would open up the question here. What is it<br/>\n&gt; you wish your testing tool would do for you that it doesn&#39;t?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m beginning to wonder whether we should have separate design and <br/>\ntesting tools. This seems to be a serious source of contention among <br/>\nprogrammers: we call it testing, but we mean design, and when we do <br/>\ndesign, testing is a secondary consideration, and yet testing is important.<br/>\n<br/>\nRather than repackaging TDD and calling it BDD, hoping that Sapir-Whorf <br/>\nwill save us from our own sloppiness, maybe it&#39;s time for separate tools <br/>\nfor design and testing. I have no idea how that would work, but perhaps <br/>\nit would help us all get along.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I&#39;d like a way to separate my design and testing activities when I do <br/>\nTDD. For example, when I test-drive behavior that doesn&#39;t yet exist, I&#39;m <br/>\nalmost always designing; but when I fill in the holes by adding a test <br/>\nfor a case that should already pass, I&#39;m testing. Perhaps it would be <br/>\nbetter to separate those somehow.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny ideas?<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
