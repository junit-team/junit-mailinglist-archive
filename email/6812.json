Also, like I said, I want to say &quot;ConfigManager is not valid <br/>\n&gt;until its state (the other objects it loads) has also been <br/>\n&gt;successfully created&quot;.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Is there no object in your system that can hold a reference to<br/>\nConfigManager and make it available to the rest of the system?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;REGARDING:  Your answer:<br/>\n&gt;I did not originally do what you suggested with the second public <br/>\n&gt;constructor because other members of my team will see it and use it <br/>\n&gt;if they dont know better.  I feel its like &quot;changing the house to fit <br/>\n&gt;the door&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s understandable. Read my other words on the topic: first get it<br/>\nto work, then refactor to what you really want.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I will now read the article you suggested<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Thanks.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJ.
