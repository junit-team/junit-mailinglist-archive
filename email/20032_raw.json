I am using\n&gt; Abbot framework for gui testing. I have written a test class with some\n&gt; test cases. I created suite of tests by overriding the suite method.\n&gt;\n&gt; As I start the testing, the first test case is run and after that\n&gt; the testing gets suddently stopped. It neither reports for failure or\n&gt; successful of testing.\n&gt;\n&gt; How can I resolve the problem ?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
