B. Rainsberger wrote:\n\n&gt;&gt;   It could be funny it it wouldn&#39;t be that sad. If all &quot;complicated&quot;\n&gt;&gt;would be like that we can get 200% test coverage...\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;   You came to the right conclusion that SQLException is an\n&gt;&gt;unrecoverable one and should be wrapped into a runtime exception. You\n&gt;&gt;even have slight improvement there with a common exception handler.\n&gt;&gt;There is only one step left before template pattern, so you can have\n&gt;&gt;exactly one place where that exception handler would be used. Take a\n&gt;&gt;look at JDBC packages in a Spring framework and either copy its design\n&gt;&gt;or use as is.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;   Pretty much the same pattern can be applied to other common API&#39;s and\n&gt;&gt;many already in a very same Spring framework, so you won&#39;t have to\n&gt;&gt;invent the wheel.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;   As I said, there are really good ways to make code more testable.\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;I agree that we can improve things with the Template pattern, but I&#39;d\n&gt;need a template for JDBC, for JMS, ... for every different 3rd-party\n&gt;product I use. Even if I do that, I still need to test-drive the\n&gt;template, or hide the template behind an interface so I can test-drive\n&gt;the code that uses it. I suppose it is achievable, but I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s\n&gt;worth the effort.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n  Oh. It very well worth it and as I mentioned already there are \nframeworks for this, so others don&#39;t have to reimplement this stuff \nagain and again.\n\n&gt;If Java made the syntax for anonymous code blocks nicer, then I suppose \n&gt;this wouldn&#39;t be a problem. What I find is that when I try to use the \n&gt;Template pattern on projects, most of the people around me don&#39;t like it \n&gt;or don&#39;t understand it, even though it&#39;s quite natural to me.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n  In many cases you don&#39;t even need bloks. Here is code for Spring API:\n\n  JdbcTemplate jt = new JdbcTemplate(dataSource);\n  jt.execute(&quot;create table mytable (id integer, name varchar(100))&quot;);\n  int count = jt.queryForInt(&quot;select count(*) from mytable&quot;);\n  List rows = jt.queryForList(&quot;select * from mytable&quot;);\n  etc...\n\n  regards,\n  Eugene\n\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
