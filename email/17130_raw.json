Here is the link for it:\n&gt; http://ant.apache.org/manual/OptionalTasks/junit.html\n&gt;\n&gt; Ejaz\n&gt;\n&gt; On 7/12/06, james_adams &lt;james_adams@... &lt;james_adams%40yahoo.com&gt;&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I have inherited some code which runs a suite of JUnit test cases (via\n&gt; &gt; junit.textui.TestRunner.doRun(mySuite)) and outputs the results of the\n&gt; &gt; test case either as &quot;.&quot; for a success, or &quot;.F&quot; for a failure, followed\n&gt; &gt; by the errors and a summary of the run results. So if I have three\n&gt; &gt; test cases in the suite, and the first and third test cases succeed,\n&gt; &gt; then the output file looks like &quot;..F.&quot; followed by the errors and a\n&gt; &gt; summary of how many successes/failures. There are about 80 test cases\n&gt; &gt; in the suite I&#39;m working with, and it is very time consuming and error\n&gt; &gt; prone to try to figure out which tests succeeded and which ones failed\n&gt; &gt; from a long list of dots and dot-F&#39;s. What I would like instead is to\n&gt; &gt; have the report look something like this:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; test-01-01: success\n&gt; &gt; test-01-02: failure\n&gt; &gt; test-02-01: success\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;errors&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;summary&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I have looked at the JavaDoc for junit.textui.TestRunner and there is\n&gt; &gt; no way to specify how the final report comes out, more specifically no\n&gt; &gt; way to tell it to print the name of the test case and the result\n&gt; &gt; rather than either &quot;.&quot; for success or &quot;.F&quot; for failures.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Can anyone advise me how I can modify this behavior? Am I stuck and\n&gt; &gt; just need to write a parser to convert the &quot;..F.&quot; to a meaningful\n&gt; &gt; report as to which tests succeeded or failed (as in the above example)?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks in advance for any suggestions.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --James\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
