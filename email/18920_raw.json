Try googling for &quot;manifest&quot; and\n&quot;classpath&quot;.\n\nI have never bothered with manifest classpaths. I generally invoke java with\nthe jars\nI need on the classpath and specify which main I want to run like so:\njava -cp lib/JUnit.jar:lib/MyJar.jar somepackage.MyMainClass\n\nI hope this helps.\n/J\n\nOn 2/14/07, Thomas L Roche &lt;tlroche@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;   Slightly offtopic, but since it&#39;s something that OP probably runink the\n&gt; into, and I didn&#39;t see it answered in the FAQ, I thought I&#39;d ask:\n&gt; how to include JUnit JARs with JARed test code? What I mean:\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m automating some tests on a legacy batch-mode app that runs\n&gt; remotely. This app runs headlessly, emitting tons &#39;o files to a\n&gt; filespace, so basically I&#39;m automating\n&gt;\n&gt; * invoking the app (setting up its inputs)\n&gt;\n&gt; * waiting for it to finish\n&gt;\n&gt; * verifying the output\n&gt;\n&gt; First I wrote some classes to setup for and invoke the app. I know\n&gt; enough Ant to JAR this code up, so I wrote a build.xml (in eclipse)\n&gt; for that, built the JAR, deployed it to one of the app&#39;s boxes (this\n&gt; is the kind of app that bogs down one&#39;s laptop if run locally), and\n&gt; ran it with `java -jar ...`, so I know that works.\n&gt;\n&gt; Then I wrote a JUnit test that calls the code that calls the app, and\n&gt; rebuilt the JAR (from eclipse). Eclipse compiled the new JUnit-using\n&gt; class OK, and included that class in the JAR it built, but the JAR\n&gt; does not contain junit.jar or any of its classes. So to deploy the\n&gt; new JAR, I just unzipped junit.jar on top of my JAR&#39;s contents,\n&gt; changed the Main-Class in its manifest, and re-JARed, deployed, and ran.\n&gt;\n&gt; That worked, but ugly. How best to tell Ant to include make available\n&gt; either &lt;project name&gt;/lib/junit.jar or its contents in the output JAR?\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
