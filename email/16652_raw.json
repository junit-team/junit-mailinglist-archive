As the runners are currently implemented, I\nthink they might both be a challenge. If you try it, I would like to hear\nwhat was easy and what hard. We would like to improve the extensibility of\nthe runner architecture.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nKent Beck\nThree Rivers Institute \n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On \n&gt; Behalf Of Mike Norman\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, May 04, 2006 8:53 AM\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: [junit] Junit 4 custom Runner design\n&gt; \n&gt; From my brief scan of the JUnit4.1 docs, one could create\n&gt; a custom Runner using the @RunWith annotation, correct?\n&gt; \n&gt; I would like to add the following capabilities:\n&gt; \n&gt;  i) parameterize the fixture @BeforeClass/@AfterClass methods:\n&gt; \n&gt;     @BeforeClass\n&gt;     public static void setupFixtures(Properties p) {\n&gt;        ...\n&gt;     }\n&gt;     The properties would be provided by searching the classpath\n&gt;     for the resource &#39;x.y.z.foo.properties&#39; where &#39;x.y.z&#39; is\n&gt;     the package of the current testclass and &#39;foo&#39; is the\n&gt;     all-lowercase-name of the testclass. The main motivation is\n&gt;     testing with databases - the various login parameters are\n&gt;     always changing with new versions of databases we must test\n&gt;     against (not just Oracle!).\n&gt; \n&gt;  ii) a new runtime Assert called &#39;ignore(&quot;some msg&quot;)&#39; to parallel\n&gt;     the design-time @Ignore annotation. The motivation is (again!)\n&gt;     testing with databases - we have a numerous tests that run\n&gt;     against many versions of databases, but each version has their\n&gt;     own idiosyncratic capabilities - e.g. each vendor handles\n&gt;     stored-procedures a little different. A test suite may have\n&gt;     hundreds of tests that pass all db-platforms, but some that only\n&gt;     pass for known configurations. At runtime the test can\n&gt;     interrogate the db-fixture and decide to not fail the testcase\n&gt;     but to ignore it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Any reason the above behaviour could not be implemented in a\n&gt; custom Runner?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks in advance,\n&gt; MWN\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
