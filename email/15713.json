Both Eclipse and Ant, for example,<br/>\n&gt; already have built in the feature to gather and run all the tests in a<br/>\n&gt; package/directory.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>1. We don&#39;t use Ant to run tests<br/>\n2. reasons we don&#39;t use Eclipse&#39;s built-in functionality:<br/>\n  a. Eclipse seemed to skip some tests in the 3.0.x branch (we would <br/>\nselect 1 project whose tests would number N, its dependent projects <br/>\nwould weigh in at M tests.  So you would expect N + M tests to have been <br/>\nrun.  Not so.  It was N + M - X tests.  I don&#39;t know where things were <br/>\ngetting lost.  I noticed this because I had a test in which I was <br/>\nforcing a failure and it never failed.  Why?  It never ran.)<br/>\n  b. using JUnit-Addons we actually are able to be more selective in the <br/>\ntypes of tests we run through Eclipse Launchers.  We have launchers for <br/>\nUnits only, Units and Database Tests, Functional Tests, and All Tests.  <br/>\nThe suite is built on the fly via tests implementing specific interfaces.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJason Rogers<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I,<br/>\nbut Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in<br/>\nthe flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved<br/>\nme, and gave himself for me.&quot;<br/>\n    Galatians 2:20<br/>\n<br/>\n (&#92; /)<br/>\n  0 0     www.squeak.org<br/>\n  =*=</div>",
