Schuchert &lt;schuchert@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; A unit te=\r\nst should test one thing. Let&#39;s say you WANT to get multiple\n&gt; results. Wha=\r\nt&#39;s the UI for that? And besides the UI, what&#39;s even the point?\n&gt; We&#39;re try=\r\ning to write tests in a way that requires nearly 0 human\n&gt; interaction. If =\r\nyou can get multiple results from a test, it seems you&#39;d\n&gt; need a person to=\r\n process those results rather than the computer. It goes\n&gt; counter to AUTOM=\r\nATION and moves towards more human intervention.\n\n\nI&#39;m not sure why wanting=\r\n multiple results leads to needing human\nintervention...  Can you expand on=\r\n that?\n\nThe original example was later answered well by someone else. Make\n=\r\n&gt; testOrder() three tests instead of one. You get the results you want, tho=\r\nugh\n&gt; you do have to write a few more lines of code.\n\n\nThe problem with thi=\r\ns approach is not just that it leads to an explosion of\ntest methods, it&#39;s =\r\nthat it decouples code that you obviously want to keep\ntogether.  First you=\r\n break these three tests in three different methods and\nnext thing you know=\r\n, these three methods become scattered in the class and\nyou completely forg=\r\net they are testing things that are closely related.  And\nmost likely, if y=\r\nou change one of these methods, you need to hunt down these\nother methods t=\r\no modify them too.\n\nI&#39;m not saying that it&#39;s a bad thing to do, just that s=\r\nometimes, there are\ngood reasons for wanting these multiple asserts togethe=\r\nr in the same method.\n\n\n\n&gt; // Note, in the original test this assert would =\r\nhave failed. It should\n&gt; have been written\n&gt; // in a way that would not fai=\r\nl but still assert what should happen\n&gt; public void testFailure_DoesNotMatc=\r\nh() {\n&gt;    assertNotEqual( 44, Largest.largest( new int[] {8,9,7}));\n&gt; }\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; And so on... The name of the test states the intent of the test. I don&#39;t\n=\r\n&gt; have to read the code to figure out the intention of what is being tested=\r\n.\n\n\nSure, but you can get the same result with strings, which are even more=\r\n\nreadable:\n\nassert 44 !=3D Larget.largest(new int[] { 8, 9, 7}) : &quot;The larg=\r\nest item should\nnot be 44&quot;.\n\n&lt;snip&gt;\n\nAgree with the rest of your message.\n\n=\r\n-- \nC=E9dric\nhttp://testng.org\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have be=\r\nen removed]\n\n\n",
