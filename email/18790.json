We said OK to the  <br/>\narchitecture, AND then we started building our part of the system  <br/>\ndriven by tests. As problems arose with the architecture, there was  <br/>\nusually some really good OO design principle that could be used to  <br/>\nexplain the problem with the architecture. Sometimes that got the  <br/>\narchitecture changed; other times, we wrote our part of the system in  <br/>\nan isolated, but testable manner and then wrote a bridge to connect  <br/>\nit to the badly architected piece. This is not ideal, but being able  <br/>\nto write your code effectively, and then adapt it to some other  <br/>\nlegacy system is often a better engineering decision, IMHO.<br/>\n<br/>\nBob Evans<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.junitfactory.com/\">http://www.junitfactory.com/</a><br/>\nSend Java code, get tests.
