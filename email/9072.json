What you want to do is<br/>\nmaximize the ROI of the time spent writing tests (i.e. get the biggest<br/>\nbang for the buck).  You need to find places in the codebase that<br/>\nwould benefit the most from adding tests and go after those first. <br/>\nYou just keep plugging away at it.. What&#39;s the worst problem?  Deal<br/>\nwith it.  Now what&#39;s the worst problem.  Deal with it.. etc.  Also,<br/>\nwhen you work on a piece of code, wrap it in some tests first.  As you<br/>\nhave more & more tests in place, you&#39;ll be better able to refactor<br/>\ninto something that is more testable.. so you can add more & better<br/>\ntests.  Getting a legacy codebase under test (and under control!)<br/>\nisn&#39;t a big bang effort... it&#39;s gradual... part of everyone&#39;s daily work.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m actually working on something very similar at the moment.. using<br/>\nmetrics (with TCC in fact) to find places in the codebase that need<br/>\nattention.<br/>\n<br/>\nDave</div>",
