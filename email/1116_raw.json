The one\n&gt; question I get =\r\na lot is, &quot;How do we test the results of a database query?&quot;\n&gt; The former me=\r\nthod of testing the query, was to manually review the results.\n&gt; The one so=\r\nlution we&#39;ve come up with is to perform the query, save the\n&gt; results to a =\r\nfile, then assert that the results from the live query are\n&gt; equivalent to =\r\nthe stored results in the file. This gets a little more tricky\n&gt; when the r=\r\nesults data contains time-sensitive fields (i.e. date fields).\n&gt; \n&gt; Anyway,=\r\n I just wanted to know whether anyone had come up with a simpler\n&gt; and/or b=\r\netter solution.\n \nWhat I do for this sort of thing (not databases, mind you=\r\n) is to\nuse the output from toString() as the test.  If that isn&#39;t suitable=\r\n,\nI&#39;ll make a method that suits the test better.   This method can\nreplace =\r\nthings like time-sensitive fields with fixed values so that\ntests don&#39;t bre=\r\nak.\n\nMy tests send up being simple assertEquals against two strings,\none co=\r\nming from a static constant, the other from the result object.\n\nI wrote a l=\r\nittle tool in perl that reads an input file and writes a\njava statement tha=\r\nt reproduces the file as a string.  I&#39;ve used this\nto take captured results=\r\n and convert them to reference data for use in\nUnit tests.\n\n-- \nJoi Ellis  =\r\n                  Software Engineer\nAravox Technologies          joi@aravox=\r\n.com, gyles19@...\n\nNo matter what we think of Linux versus FreeBSD, et=\r\nc., the one thing I\nreally like about Linux is that it has Microsoft worrie=\r\nd.
