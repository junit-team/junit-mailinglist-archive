I never used junit before. Can anybody give \nme a quick answer to my two sample questions.\n\n1) Can junit can do coverage analysis? How?\nAs my understanding, it should have a parser for java program. and \nenable to add instrumentation code easily. \n\n2) If junit can not be used to do coverage analysis, do anybody now \na good open source tool can do so? \n\nYour answer is highly appreciated.\n\nXiaochen\n\n\n\n",
