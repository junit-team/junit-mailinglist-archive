It&#39;s not an empty method, it&#39;s a method that is currently empty but will be written later.\n\n&gt; What is the difference if you just add the method later?\n\nI just pointed out that if you really want an empty method (with no assertion -&gt; reported as successfull by JUnit) you must add some note to not forget to write the code.  If you don&#39;t I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll forget at the end of the project that you still have somewhere (dude, where&#39;s my empty method?) code to write.\n\nIf you declare your method &quot;_notImplemented&quot; :\n1) you can only define one unimplemented method per TestCase\n2) you don&#39;t code anything meaningfull.  If you want to write a template, the method&#39;s name should at least mean something (such as &quot;testThrowExceptionA&quot;...).\n\nI imagine a tool that parses your classes and generates a specific TestCase class with methods to test your public methods?  Let&#39;s say: you have a method that can throw exceptions A, B or C, your generated file will have 3 methods (testThrowA, testThrowB, testThrowC...) with (almost) empty bodies.  Does it make sense?\n\nBTW anyone thinks that it is a good idea? (the tool is IDE independant of course).\n\n-Vladimir\n\n\n\n",
