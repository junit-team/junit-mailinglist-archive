As posted last time this discussion went around\nevought&gt; the exact same circles:\n...\nevought&gt;         public void setJ(int j) {d_j = j;}\nevought&gt;         public int getJ() {return d_i;}\n\nevought&gt; This code is trivial. It is also wrong. Somebody probably created the\nevought&gt; accessors for i and then cut and paste them for j without editting\nevought&gt; everywhere they should. Without a testcase here, there will be a more\nevought&gt; complex failure somewhere else. Somebody will spend an hour or so pulling\nevought&gt; their hair out. A testcase for this is very quick to do.\n\nThe main problem with testing at this level is that, just as it is\ntempting to create the getters and setters using cut-n-paste, it is\ntempting to create the unit tests using cut-n-paste.  Admit it, we&#39;ve\nall done it.\n\nAfter a lot of soul searching, the conclusion I have come to for my\nown work is that unit tests should not really be testing the &quot;raw&quot;\nmethods of a class.  Rather, they should be testing the real\nfunctionality actually required by users of the class.\n\nI can&#39;t help help feeling in this case that (maybe) there might\nactually be no real need for a getJ() accessor, and it may have been\ncreated from a knee-jerk &quot;must provide all the accessors in case\nsomeone wants to use this class as a JavaBean&quot;. If you have a real\nneed in your system to call such a method, then provide a unit test\nwhen you have that need, but before you do that, consider whether the\nreal need in the system is for a more specific call, which can be\ntested in more depth.\n\n-- \nFrank Carver     frank@...    http://www.efsol.com/\n\n\n",
