MockObjects are NOT just a way of testing code,<br/>\nthey are a tool used to design loosely coupled, well factored systems. <br/>\nIf you can easily mock out the whole of an encompassing system in order<br/>\nto test one itty-bitty unit, you PROBABLY have done a very good job of<br/>\nfollowing the creme-de-la-creme principles of Object Oriented<br/>\nProgramming.  I don&#39;t look at them as kludges.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe real issue may not be the test code.  It may be in the design of the<br/>\nproduction code, &quot;may&quot; being the operative word here since I don&#39;t<br/>\npresume to pass judgment on your code base.<br/>\n<br/>\nHTH,<br/>\n=jason<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Mon, 2003-06-16 at 16:48, robert_difalco wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Is there a way to get each test method to run in it&#39;s own JVM?

If each test method <br/>\n&gt; ran in it&#39;s own JVM, my testing code would not require me to make <br/>\n&gt; changes in the code I am testing.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s not just singletons but also caches that should be initialized <br/>\n&gt; once for a JVM. And, honestly, if you think about it, each test <br/>\n&gt; method SHOULD be atomic. Mock objects seemed kind of like a kludge <br/>\n&gt; for tests not being run atomically.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thoughts?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; R. </span></blockquote></div>",
