In my JDBC and HTTP tests, this has made a\nfew tests kind of brittle when the order or number of calls to an\naccessor method has changed.   The code still works, it also still\nconforms to the expectations of the interface, it just does things a\nlittle differently.\n\nHave you had these issues as well, and are there workarounds?  In my\nmock objects that I write by hand, I&#39;m often either returning one thing\nall the time, or I implement a map for look-ups:\n\npublic String getMiddleName(Person person) {\n    return (String)middleNameData.get(person);\n}\n\n-Kevin Klinemeier\n\n--- Jason Rogers &lt;jacaetevha@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; You could have used dynamic mocks (a la \n&gt;\nhttp://mockobjects.sourceforge.net/javadoc/1.4/com/mockobjects/dynamic/Mock.html\n&gt; \n&gt; or http://mockobjects.com/DynaMock.html) wherein you tell your mock\n&gt; what \n&gt; calls, results, and constraints are expected.  Then you just send the\n&gt; message \n&gt; verify() to the mock at the end of the test.\n\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
