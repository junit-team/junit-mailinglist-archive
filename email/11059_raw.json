You can\n&gt; &gt; only extend TestCase or you business class, but not both.  If you\n&gt; &gt; want to use JUnit with a derived class, it seems you have to\n&gt; &gt; implement a lot of methods from the TestCase interface -- which\n&gt; &gt; isn&#39;t practical.\n&gt; ...\n&gt; Put simply, what you propose to do goes entirely against JUnit&#39;s\n&gt; philosophy, as well as the more general testing philosophies of the\n&gt; xUnit family of testing frameworks. Tests are tests and production code\n&gt; is production code.\n\nInterestingly enough, in the engineering world, having testing stuff\nbuilt into the final product is very common. In part this is due to the\nvagaries of manufacturing, of course; you want some way to ascertain\nthat this particular CPU you built functions as it should, which is not\nnormally a problem with software where you can produce perfect replicas.\n\nHowever, now that I&#39;ve played around with Ruby a bit, I am rather\ngetting to like the idea of getting the test and production code\n&quot;closer together.&quot; I often put my test classes in the same file as the\nproduction code, which can save a lot of switching back and forth. You\ncan even define a but of the production class, a bit of the test class\nwith the tests for that method or whatever, a bit more of the production\nclass, and so on.\n\n&gt; Why do you want a production class also to be a test? I think it&#39;s\n&gt; generally a very bad idea.\n\nI don&#39;t see what the problem with it is. It might cause a bit of code\nbloat, but that&#39;s often not a problem in many projects.\n\n&gt; This brings up something I am struggling with: in C#/NUnit, we can\n&gt; declare a test without extending TestCase (even if we frequently extend\n&gt; Assert, anyway). Is there some great benefit to this over the way we do\n&gt; it in JUnit, SUnit, RubyUnit, PyUnit, ...?\n\nYou can do the same in Ruby&#39;s Test::Unit:\n\n    require &#39;test/unit/testsuite&#39;\n    require &#39;test/unit/ui/console/testrunner&#39;\n\n    class NonTestcaseTest\n\tdef size; 1; end\n\tdef run(result); result.add_run; end\n    end\n\n    suite = Test::Unit::TestSuite.new\n    suite &lt;&lt; NonTestcaseTest.new\n    Test::Unit::UI::Console::TestRunner.run(suite)\n\nIn Ruby, and it sounds like in C#, &quot;interfaces&quot; are defined by what\nmessages an object will respond to; there&#39;s no need to explicitly\ndeclare them. Java people tend to be pretty uncomfortable with this, but\nit&#39;s a basic part of life in Smalltalk, and can be very handy, as it\nmakes basically everything extensible, and lets extend things in ways\nnot anticipated by the author of the package you&#39;re using. For fun:\n\n    require &#39;test/unit/testsuite&#39;\n    require &#39;test/unit/testcase&#39;\n    require &#39;test/unit/ui/console/testrunner&#39;\n\n    class ArrayOfTests &lt; Array\n\tdef run(result)\n\t    each { |test| test.run(result) { } }\n\tend\n    end\n\n    class SampleTestCase &lt; Test::Unit::TestCase\n\tdef test_nil_is_nil\n\t    assert_nil(nil)\n\tend\n    end\n\n    suite = Test::Unit::TestSuite.new\n    arrayOfTests = ArrayOfTests.new\n    suite &lt;&lt; arrayOfTests\n\n    2.times { arrayOfTests &lt;&lt; SampleTestCase.new(&quot;test_nil_is_nil&quot;) }\n\n    Test::Unit::UI::Console::TestRunner.run(suite)\n\nOne can even keep the &quot;dynamic&quot; feel of this but still have static\ntyping by having the compiler do type inference, as done in Haskell and\nML.\n\ncjs\n-- \nCurt Sampson  &lt;cjs@...&gt;   +81 90 7737 2974   http://www.NetBSD.org\n    Don&#39;t you know, in this new Dark Age, we&#39;re all light.  --XTC\n\n",
