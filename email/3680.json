If not, those asking the questions will find answers on their own and then become the answerers.<br/>\nIt&#39;s emergent.  When you&#39;ve had ample time to recharge, I&#39;m confident you&#39;ll be even more valuable to this list and your other endeavors.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for all the time and energy you&#39;ve already contributed to this community.  I appreciate it.  More importantly, I hope it&#39;s been rewarding for you.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest Regards,<br/>\n<br/>\nMike<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nMike Clark<br/>\nClarkware Consulting, Inc.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.clarkware.com\">http://www.clarkware.com</a><br/>\n720.851.2014</div>",
