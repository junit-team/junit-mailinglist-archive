We are not verifying Count\n&gt; &gt; in this test, but rather indexing.  Although I would argue that it is\n&gt; &gt; nice to have pre-requisites satisfied in the middle of a test, to help\n&gt; &gt; direct your attention to the true cause of the issue.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Much like the snowball effect of the nuclear reactor plant example.  A\n&gt; &gt; defect occurs, which in turn causes other defects (which in turn\n&gt; &gt; causes more defects, and so on).  From an analysis perspective it is\n&gt; &gt; difficult to pin-point the root defect because it is being masks but\n&gt; &gt; subsequent ones.  Unlike the above example, where the order of the\n&gt; &gt; defects can be used to unravel the issue, in testing order is\n&gt; &gt; independent, so the primary defects are not necessarily those that\n&gt; &gt; occur first.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; To address this, it would interesting to append two additional bits of\n&gt; &gt; information on an assertion.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 1) Assumption.AreEqual(3,list.Count,&quot;Check the count, and the add\n&gt; methods&quot;);\n&gt; &gt; 2) Corollory.IsTrue(list.ContainsOnly(typeof(string)));\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; An assumption is really a pre-requisite - that if fails, really means\n&gt; &gt; that you were not even able to set-up to do the real testing.  Having\n&gt; &gt; assumptions fail helps to pin-point coupling between components - as\n&gt; &gt; well as helps direct your attention was secondary failing tests to the\n&gt; &gt; primary ones (aka the failed Assertions).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; An corollary is something you believe to be true, but is not essential\n&gt; &gt; to your unit test itself.  Corollaries are nice because you indirectly\n&gt; &gt; add additional tests for other components of our system without that\n&gt; &gt; much extra overhead.  Failing corollaries may highlight obscure bugs\n&gt; &gt; in other parts of your system, or they highlight your\n&gt; &gt; mis-understanding of those other parts (or they highlight a change to\n&gt; &gt; the underlying assumptions of those parts).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; On Thu, 8 Jul 2004 10:22:01 +0000, Jason Rogers\n&gt; &gt; &lt;jacaetevha@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; On Wednesday 07 July 2004 10:49 pm, Curt Sampson wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  On Tue, 6 Jul 2004, hedgi wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt;   Now I there is the problem.

I&#39;m stuck\n&gt; with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt;   it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  I&#39;ve been thinking for a while that this is a serious problem in\n&gt; JUnit\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  (and most unit testing frameworks), because it&#39;s been such an\n&gt; annoyance\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  for so many people. Let&#39;s face it; a lot of groups of tests do have\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  known dependencies between tests such that if test A fails, we know\n&gt; &gt; that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  the output of tests B, C and D are uninteresting. Yet we end up\n&gt; running\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  B, C and D anyway, and then searching through all the error output\n&gt; for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  the failure that we know is the &quot;real&quot; one, ignoring all the others\n&gt; as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  spurious.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; With all due respect, I believe that is a code smell.  It seems to say\n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; me\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that there is something not right about the design of the code being\n&gt; &gt; tested,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; or perhaps even more elusive, something is wrong with how the tests are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; written.  When I find these types of dependencies I inevitably rethink\n&gt; how\n&gt; &gt; I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; have written my tests.  Have I coded in the dependencies or are they\n&gt; &gt; really\n&gt; &gt; &gt; there.  More times than not I have coded in the dependencies -- and\n&gt; &gt; therefore\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I can remove them.  Further, I would argue that I _NEED_ to remove them.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Now, maybe I am old-fashioned but I believe tests (at least at the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; unit/programmer level) ought to be as autonomous as possible.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Jason Rogers\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 117 N.
