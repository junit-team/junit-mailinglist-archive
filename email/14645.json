And in my experience, that&#39;s very likely<br/>\n&gt;&gt; always possible, in a way that makes the design more flexible and<br/>\n&gt;&gt; the behaviour more reusable. <br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; Does that sound reasonable?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;Let us redefine progress, to mean that just because we /can/<br/>\n&gt; do a thing, it does not necessarily follow that we /must/ do<br/>\n&gt; that thing.&quot; So I suppose it would depend on several factors.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 1. Are you doing this /just/ so that you can test the method<br/>\n&gt; by external invocation? If so then my answer is no. 2. Is the<br/>\n&gt; method already tested through the public API of the class? If<br/>\n&gt; yes then my answer is no. 3. Does the system (code plus<br/>\n&gt; tests) clearly communicate everything that needs to be<br/>\n&gt; communicated at this time? If it does then my answer is no.<br/>\n&gt; 4. Is the flexibility and reusability that you refer to<br/>\n&gt; needed now or is it speculative? If the latter then my answer<br/>\n&gt; is no. 5. Was my answer no to the previous questions and<br/>\n&gt; there are more stories needing to be implemented this iteration? Then<br/>\n&gt; heck no! <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not doing this &quot;just&quot; for one thing. In my experience moving a complex<br/>\nmethod to a place where it wants to be public both<br/>\n<br/>\n- makes the code more expressive,<br/>\n- makes the code easier to test,<br/>\n- makes the code more flexible, and thereby<br/>\n- helps me to maintain a high velocity.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso keep in mind that moving the method often is only a first step, an<br/>\nenabler for further simplifying refactorings.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers, Ilja</div>",
