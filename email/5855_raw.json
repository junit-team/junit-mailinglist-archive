This worked really well until I participated in a distributed development project and found out that the tests did not run in the same sequence at the remote site.  I never tracked down the difference, but my hypothesis was different JVMs/versions.\n\nIf you want to _reliably_ order the tests, I think you need to give up the reflection-generated suite method and hand code it.\n\n-- Ted Velkoff\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Vincent Wong \n  To: junit@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Monday, September 23, 2002 1:54 PM\n  Subject: Re: [junit] Running tests in some specified sequence\n\n\n  Hi Taras\n\n  I have found that the jUnit tests methods seem to be\n  run in an alphabetical manner. For example, given the\n  methods testGetName() and testSetName(), testGetName()\n  will run first.\n\n  If you like to make testSetName() run first and then\n  use testGetName() to get the name and then do an\n  assert, you can try renaming testGetName() to\n  testZGetName().\n\n  Regards\n  Vincent\n\n\n  --- Taras Tielkes &lt;taras@...&gt; wrote: &gt; Hi,\n  &gt; \n  &gt; I have a layered API class model that I&#39;d like to\n  &gt; unit test.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; The API is layered in the sense that some high level\n  &gt; APIs depend on lower\n  &gt; level APIs. Other higher level APIs are built on the\n  &gt; high level APIs.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; I have written unit tests for each of these APIs.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; These unit tests can be run in any sequence,\n  &gt; however: I&#39;d like to specify\n  &gt; that the unit tests for the lower level APIs should\n  &gt; be run first.\n  &gt; When these tests pass, the higher level APIs can be\n  &gt; tested, having some\n  &gt; confidence that the lower level works.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; The reason is that when an error occurs in a low\n  &gt; level API, it&#39;s easier to\n  &gt; diagnose when it occurs in the unit test for the\n  &gt; lower level API, rather\n  &gt; than as a result of the higher level API calling the\n  &gt; low level API.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; When I add tests to a TestSuite using one of the\n  &gt; addXXX() methods, is the\n  &gt; sequence of adding the tests the same sequence if\n  &gt; which the tests are run?\n  &gt; \n  &gt; If not, how can specify that a subset of all tests\n  &gt; &#39;should&#39; be run in some\n  &gt; sequence? (Note: not *must*, the unit tests can\n  &gt; still be run in *any*\n  &gt; sequence, but I&#39;d like the stuff that tests the low\n  &gt; level parts of the code\n  &gt; to run first)\n  &gt; \n  &gt; If TestSuite does not respect the sequence of the\n  &gt; addXXX() calls for the\n  &gt; running of the tests, can I implements this by\n  &gt; extending TestSuite?\n  &gt; \n  &gt; Thanks in advance for any comments on this!
