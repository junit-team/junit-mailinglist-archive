Not an option right now. :(\n\nRegards,\n\nSteve.\n\n--\nStephen Smith, MEng (Wales).\nhttp://www.stephen-smith.co.uk/\n\nDavid Saff wrote:\n&gt; Nitay wrote:\n&gt;&gt; I&#39;ve been using junit for a while now. These days every piece of java\n&gt;&gt; snippet I write has a test attached to it :).\n&gt; \n&gt; That&#39;s cool.  I hope it&#39;s helping the design and implementation of your \n&gt; code--I know it helps mine.\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; I was wondering why there are no assertNotEquals and assertThrows \n&gt;&gt; methods in\n&gt;&gt; the Assert class. I have needed something like this many times in my\n&gt;&gt; testing, and have had to fall back to doing assertFalse(a.equals(b)) and a\n&gt;&gt; sequence of try-catch-fail, respectively.\n&gt; \n&gt; I can&#39;t comment on the history of assertNotEquals.  assertThrows is hard \n&gt; in a language like Java that doesn&#39;t have literal code blocks, but JUnit \n&gt; 4 handles it with the @Test(expected=NullPointerException.class) annotation.\n&gt; \n&gt;     David Saff\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo!
