This is what\nsetUp() and tearDown() usually take care of. \nWhen you rely on a certain order what do your follow-up tests do when\none of their precessors has failed? Removing test order dependeny often\nrequires some refactoring of the tests and of the classes under tests.\nEvery time that I had to do this refactoring I ended up with an improved\ndesign, i.e. one with less overall dependencies and better overall\ntestability.\n\nJohannes\n\nHeinz van Pee wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; Hello,\n&gt; i have a question about JUnit:\n&gt; Is it possible to influence the order of the Tests?\n&gt; I have some test methods in a Testcase and would like to\n&gt; have them executed in a specific order, for some tests\n&gt; reley on the success of others.\n&gt; Is there any way to do this?\n&gt; \n&gt; Kind Regards,\n&gt;     Heinz van Pee\n\n",
