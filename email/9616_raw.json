There&#39;s many ways to test JMS related\nthings, either with or without jUnit.\nIf you abstract the JMS layer into a messaging-facade, you can replace the\nactual messaging-facade with a Mockup. The mockup directly connects the\nsender to the receiver and runs outside the app. server.\n\nCut down and slice up as desired; you don&#39;t have to connect sender and\nreceiver this way always - you can put a stub at either end to test them\nseperately.\n\n--Tim\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Kadam, Sal [mailto:skadam@...]\nSent: woensdag 1 oktober 2003 22:59\nTo: &#39;junit@yahoogroups.com&#39;\nSubject: [junit] How to test JMS code with any App. Server\n\n\nGuys,\n  Any thoughts.\n \n \nThanks\n Sal\n-----  This message is for the named person&#39;s use only.
