Sometimes this is a viable <br/>\noption, but at some point a directory full of a bunch of xml catalog <br/>\nfile variations becomes more readable and understandable than a bunch of <br/>\ncode.  You want to find a medium that works for your situation, rather <br/>\nthan trying too hard to make your situation fit a set of rules.<br/>\n<br/>\nT.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Wednesday, May 1, 2002, at 05:30 PM, David V.

This makes perfect sense.  Tests which rely on<br/>\n&gt; external resources are  not self-contained, are harder to read, and can <br/>\n&gt; be<br/>\n&gt; broken even if the code is functioning correctly.  However, code does <br/>\n&gt; touch<br/>\n&gt; external resources at some point.  Shouldn&#39;t this be tested, and how?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Specifically, I have code that parses a xml catalog file and builds a<br/>\n&gt; catalog object structure.  I want to verify that the parsing works<br/>\n&gt; correctly.  In particular, I want to make sure that it robustly handles<br/>\n&gt; unusual conditions such as catalogs with certain branches missing.  It<br/>\n&gt; seems to me that the simplest way to do this is to have a test which <br/>\n&gt; uses<br/>\n&gt; the parsing code to parse a very simple catalog and verifies that it <br/>\n&gt; builds<br/>\n&gt; what I expect it to.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But to do this test I do need some external resource, a simple catalog<br/>\n&gt; file.  Ok.  Now I can&#39;t simply look at the test to see what it does.  I<br/>\n&gt; also have to look at the file.  Are there cleaner alternatives?  Must I<br/>\n&gt; simply accept that there will occasionally be external resources <br/>\n&gt; required<br/>\n&gt; to test functionality at the boundaries of the system?  If so, are there<br/>\n&gt; best practices for this scenario?  Am I missing something?  I&#39;d love to<br/>\n&gt; hear peoples thoughts.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; David Olivier<br/>\n&gt; Naval Research Laboratory<br/>\n&gt; Digital Mapping, Charting & Geodesy Analysis Program<br/>\n&gt; Code 7440.2<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
