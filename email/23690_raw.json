Thi=\r\ns brings the semantics of the assume*() methods in the context of a @Test&#39;s=\r\n and @Theory&#39;s much closer.\n\n(Background: this custom runner is used in a S=\r\nelenium/WebDriver setup that is meant to test the UI of a system, irrespect=\r\nive of the system&#39;s underlying config/database. As such it is not uncommon =\r\nthat no suitable PotentialAssignments can be found for a given test setup. =\r\nYes, I am aware that this kind of test is anything but a unit test, but JUn=\r\nit serves us very well regardless.)\n\nStephan\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com,=\r\n David Saff &lt;david@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; So, it would be up to individual runners=\r\n to figure out how to fit into\n&gt; the overall scheme.  Right now, the Theori=\r\nes runner doesn&#39;t report up\n&gt; individual assumption failures.  If every sin=\r\ngle data point results in\n&gt; an assumption failure, then the test is marked =\r\nas failing.  If at\n&gt; least one data point fails, the test is marked as fail=\r\ning.  If at\n&gt; least one data point succeeds, and none fail, it&#39;s marked pas=\r\nsing.\n&gt; \n&gt;     David\n&gt; \n&gt; On Mon, Sep 19, 2011 at 4:23 PM, Stephen Connolly=\r\n\n&gt; &lt;stephen.alan.connolly@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; I think there are a number of iss=\r\nues with this categorization...
