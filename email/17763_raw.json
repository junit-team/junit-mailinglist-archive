Fact is, if your precondition fails or you \n&gt; get a NullPointerException, there&#39;s a bug in the client.  You can have \n&gt; checking enabled, or not, but checking is not error handling. \n\nThen maybe we agree more than we think. If checking is not error \nhandling, then I accept that we don&#39;t need to handle the error. Indeed, \nin many cases we can&#39;t reasonably handle the error inside the method. \nHowever, I do think that it&#39;s important not to blindly accept a bad \nargument that violates a precondition and precede blindly ahead whatever \nhappens. It is important to fail fast (and in a controlled and \ndocumented way via an exception) rather than let the software corrupt \nitself. Martin Fowler has written extensively about this:\n\nhttp://www.martinfowler.com/ieeeSoftware/failFast.pdf\n\n\n&gt; The point \n&gt; of DbC is to build software robust enough so that you don&#39;t have to \n&gt; write error handling code at each level.  Relevant section is 11.6 \n&gt; &quot;Assertions are not an input checking mechanism.&quot;\n\nThat&#39;s something very different. Meyer clearly means *user* input in \nthat section, and I agree with him on that. Assertions very much are an \nargument/parameter checking mechanism. I don&#39;t think we&#39;re talking here \nabout user input, just about how two different methods from two \ndifferent code bases communicate.\n\n&gt; And when you say &quot;It is my job to make sure my code works. I can&#39;t do \n&gt; that if the code that calls it violates my preconditions and class \n&gt; invariants.&quot;  Most of the time, that&#39;s trying to do too much.\n\n\nAgreed. What I really should have said is something like, &quot;It&#39;s my job \nto make sure my code works, or signals an error at the earliest possible \nopportunity if it can&#39;t work due to precondition violation&quot;\n\n-- \n﻿Elliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nJava I/O 2nd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeaulait.org/books/javaio2/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596527500/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/\n\n",
