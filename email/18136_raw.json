It lets you leverage from standard\ndevelopment practi=\r\nces to get more insight into the requirements \ncovered by the code. \n\nJRequ=\r\nire works on top of the well known unit testing framework - \nJUnit, to iden=\r\ntify the requirement coverage in the code. This also \nmakes JRequire useful=\r\n for projects, which use tools that operate on \ntop of JUnit, such as, Cact=\r\nus, StrutsTestcase, etc. \n\nFollowing are the salient features of JRequire\n-=\r\n Facilitates traceability of code to requirements during \ndevelopment.\n- We=\r\nll-integrated with the standard JUnit unit testing framework. \n- Eclipse Pl=\r\nugin: Provides a convenient editor to manage requirements\n  and an instant =\r\nview to developers on requirement coverage as they\n  develop code. \n- Custo=\r\nm ANT Task: This is useful for automated builds and generating\n  requiremen=\r\nt coverage for the entire project. \n- Sophisticated reporting on covered re=\r\nquirements, broken \n  requirements and requirements with no coverage. \n- Ro=\r\nund trip engineering: Keep your source/external requirements\n  files and JR=\r\nequire requirements files in sync as your project\n  proceeds. \n- Refactorin=\r\ng: Keep your requirements files up-to-date when the unit\n  tests are refact=\r\nored.\n\nPlease visit the following link to download it\nhttp://www.technobuff=\r\n.net/webapp/product/showProduct.do?\nname=3Djrequire \n\n\n\n\n",
