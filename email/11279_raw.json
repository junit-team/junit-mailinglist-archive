Can I use it\n&gt; in place of Clover?\n\nYes, you can use it in place of Clover (several\naccount teams at my company have switched and I am\ngetting emails from external users to the same effect\nas well). Of course, there will always be feature\ndifferences between source code instrumentation-based\n(Clover), bytecode instrumentation-based (EMMA), and\nJVMPI-based tools (many other commercial tools). \n\nNo, EMMA has not been integrated into Maven (yet),\nalthough this has been much requested as soon as it\nwas published outside of Trilogy. This feature will be\nimplemented in near future (another developer is\njoining the project soon specifically to address this\narea) but I don&#39;t think this is a gate for starting to\nuse EMMA now.\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nNew and Improved Yahoo!
