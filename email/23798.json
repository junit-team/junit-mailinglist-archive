Starting today, I&#39;m going<br/>\nto try to get back to one-week maximum latency for new code reviews<br/>\nand communication around JUnit.  If you&#39;ve gotten stuck in the backlog<br/>\nI&#39;ve built up in the interim, feel free to re-forward and jump the<br/>\nqueue.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, if it feels like it&#39;s taking a long time to get a code review,<br/>\nplease feel free to use this list to ask other devs to take a first<br/>\nlook: often, the first 80% of improvements, especially around naming<br/>\nand documentation, can be provided by any suitably experienced<br/>\ndeveloper.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your patience and for supporting each other within the community.<br/>\n<br/>\n   David Saff<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Mon, Oct 31, 2011 at 2:51 PM, David Saff &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:david@...\">david@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; All,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve been very lucky for several years to had both a family and an<br/>\n&gt; employer that have left room for me to contribute to JUnit for free.<br/>\n&gt; However, for at least the next month, two launches are combining to<br/>\n&gt; absorb the lion&#39;s share of my time.  One is named Micah, and is rather<br/>\n&gt; user-friendly most of the time, but has a somewhat draining<br/>\n&gt; maintenance schedule, and sporadic uptime.  The other doesn&#39;t yet have<br/>\n&gt; a last name that we&#39;re sharing, although I expect the first name will<br/>\n&gt; be &quot;Google&quot;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks for understanding if your great questions and valuable patches<br/>\n&gt; are responded to with more delay over the coming weeks.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   David Saff </span></blockquote></div>",
