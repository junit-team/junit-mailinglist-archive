Put\n&gt; as much of the logic as possible into POJOs and/or taglibs, and test those\n&gt; the usual way.\n&gt; \n&gt; If you really need to test the JSPs, you can use jWebUnit with ServletUnit\n&gt; as the test container (the latter comes with httpUnit), or Jetty as an\n&gt; embedded webserver.\n\nWhen I tried faking the web container, I found that the JSP processor \npulls in such crazy stuff -- like Ant! -- that the complexity of the \ntest environment was no longer worth the effort. For that reason, I \ncannot emphasize enough the need to push as much of the JSP out into \nplain Java (POJOs or taglibs, as you say). The best you can do is test \nthe JSPs independently of the application that uses them, so write a \ntest servlet that allows you to stick arbitrary data into the Request, \nthen forwards to the JSP. This way you can test various error conditions \nby simulating, not recreating them. It&#39;s not as nice as (say) Velocity, \nbut it&#39;ll do.\n-- \nJ. B.
