Once you are done, then\nexecute the builder in loop to create java class for\nall the classes in the folder. Then you have to\ncustomize it while you are testing the individual\nclass. \n--- &quot;David M.

We\n&gt; have a significant code\n&gt; base already and we&#39;re trying to move to JUnit. \n&gt; What issues did you have\n&gt; when trying this yourself?  Was your testing\n&gt; hierarchy exactly the same as\n&gt; your application package structure?  Did you start\n&gt; only using JUnit with new\n&gt; development or with bugs as well?  Or did you take a\n&gt; month off and have\n&gt; everyone write JUnit tests?  Any help would be\n&gt; greatly appreciated.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; -dmg\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nGet email at your own domain with Yahoo!
