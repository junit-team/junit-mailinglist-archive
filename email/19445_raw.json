Somehow I was\n&gt; thinking compilation failure=\r\ns... Anyway, the problem is in the way you\n&gt; use the &lt;batchtest/&gt; element -=\r\n- you&#39;re currently telling the JUnit\n&gt; task to run all &quot;*.java&quot; files as JU=\r\nnit tests, which obviously doesn&#39;t\n&gt; work. Instead, you need to use pattern=\r\ns like &quot;*Test.java&quot; and\n&gt; &quot;Test*.java&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; Lasse\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; Lasse Koskela=\r\n\n&gt; * Author of &quot;Test Driven&quot; (Manning Publications, 2007) *\n\n\n\n",
