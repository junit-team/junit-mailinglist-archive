We<br/>\n&gt; are now looking at Agitator and trying to determine if, and how, it<br/>\n&gt; fits into our current practices.  I was wondering how others have<br/>\n&gt; decided to use Agitator (or not use it).  Some of the issues we are<br/>\n&gt; struggling with:<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve struggled with this myself.  Agitar has some very cool  <br/>\ncapabilities, but I can&#39;t figure out when I&#39;d actually use them.  Oh,  <br/>\nI think the code coverage reports are useful; though I think clover  <br/>\novers more value for money in that regard.  The real problem I have  <br/>\nwith Agitar is with the core functionality itself.  I don&#39;t really  <br/>\nknow when I&#39;d use the agitation.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problems I have experienced, when I have tried to use it, stem  <br/>\nfrom the fact that random generation of input data is not a  <br/>\nparticularly good way to exercise a function.  Most functions make a  <br/>\nsequence of decisions about their input data.  If the random  <br/>\nagitation does not offer data in the appropriate syntax, then the  <br/>\nagitation simply won&#39;t test more than the outer skin of the function.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo put this another way, imagine that you are testing the following  <br/>\nfunction:<br/>\n<br/>\npublic boolean isSpecial(String userName);<br/>\n<br/>\nThis function returns true of the userName matches one of a list of  <br/>\n&quot;special&quot; users.  How is Agitar going to observe this functionality  <br/>\nunless you build a special factory to create the input values?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother kind of function that doesn&#39;t seem to work well for agitation  <br/>\nis one that can be called several times and expects a sequence of  <br/>\ndata.  Imagine, for example, the function named:<br/>\n<br/>\n   public boolean compile(character c);<br/>\n<br/>\nThis function is called, one character at a time, and only returns  <br/>\ntrue once a valid line of Java has been entered.  How do you agitate  <br/>\nthis?<br/>\n<br/>\nFunctions like this may seem contrived; but my problem is that when I  <br/>\nhave tried to use Agitar (or it&#39;s competitor, JTest) I have  <br/>\nconsistently run in to variations on these themes.  That is,  <br/>\nfunctions for which the random generation of input data is  <br/>\ninsufficient to get very far below the surface.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; 1.  Agitator looks like it can eliminate the need to write most JUnit<br/>\n&gt; tests (except true persistence testing).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>NO, NO, NO, NO, NO!!!!  First the spirit is wrong.  Second the facts  <br/>\nare wrong.<br/>\nTDD is not about HAVING tests, it is about WRITING tests.  If you try  <br/>\nto generate tests from code, then you might as well not have the  <br/>\ntests at all; because all you are doing is creating tests that pass.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe most major benefit of TDD is that the author writes everything  <br/>\ntwice, once as a test and once as production code.<br/>\n(see: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.TheSensitivityProblem)\">http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.TheSensitivityProblem)</a><br/>\n<br/>\nYet even if you did not accept this argument, remember that Agitation  <br/>\ncan&#39;t see very far below the surface.  So the tests that it creates  <br/>\nwould be imperfect at best.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the end you get an imperfect representation of what IS, rather  <br/>\nthan a separate specification of what you intend.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The downside is that we<br/>\n&gt; would be left with only Agitator config files that contain our<br/>\n&gt; business logic assertions.  This seems like a big leap to take, given<br/>\n&gt; that if Agitar goes away, we have no JUnit.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>JTest provides similar functionality to Agitar, but writes it&#39;s  <br/>\nobservations out as JUnit tests.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; 2.  Agitator mocks and factories look easy to create, but look like<br/>\n&gt; they are only useful in the context of Agitator.  I couldn&#39;t use them<br/>\n&gt; for other purposes (e.g. Fitnesse, JUnit).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And again, why would you?  The effort spent on those would be better  <br/>\nspent on writing unit tests using true TDD.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; 3.  Having my business logic tests in JUnit means they are in an<br/>\n&gt; understood format and things such as inputs and expected results are<br/>\n&gt; clearly visible and grouped with each test.  My impression of<br/>\n&gt; Agitator is that this wouldn&#39;t be as clear.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Certainly true. This was one of my early complaints about the product  <br/>\nbefore I dug beneath the surface.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe bottom line is that this is a very interesting product that  <br/>\nappears to me to be looking for a problem to solve. I&#39;m not at all  <br/>\nsure how I would use it to solve any of the problems that my teams  <br/>\ncurrently have.  I think the random generation of input data is  <br/>\ninteresting, and can be beneficial for simple syntax and validation  <br/>\nissues; but Agitar is NOT a replacement for TDD; and NOBODY should  <br/>\nthink that the tool can write your unit tests for you.  Remember.  <br/>\nTEST FIRST!, not Agitate second.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n----<br/>\nRobert C.
