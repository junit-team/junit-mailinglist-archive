Most\n&gt; developers did not want to write specs first.  Let me be more\n&gt; specific: some of them did not want to, others could not do it. Some\n&gt; developers, including some very good ones, are not wired to think test\n&gt; first.  They could do it, but they would not be very effective at it -\n&gt; like asking a left-handed person to write with their write hand.\n&gt; \n\nThe system did not work just fine. As you point out, developers would \nnot and could not operate this way. This wasn&#39;t a problem with your \ndevelopers. It was a problem with your process.\n\nI have *never* met a competent developer who was incapable of doing test \nfirst development once introduced to it. The reason you couldn&#39;t get \ndevelopers to follow your system is precisely that it wasn&#39;t test first \ndevelopment. You were asking for big up-front design, and we know from \nexperience that doesn&#39;t work. I am not surprised that you encountered \nresistance when asking programmers to produce this level of design \nbefore writing code.\n\nThe proper way to do test first development is to write *one* test, just \none. Then code until the test passes. Then write another test. Then code \nuntil it passes. Repeat until the application is done.\n\nYou don&#39;t have to be a total stickler about this. Sometimes you can \nwrite a few tests before writing the code to make them pass. Sometimes \nyou can write a somewhat more generic version of a method than is \nstrictly needed to make a test pass. However the two extremes--all code \nbefore any tests or all tests before any code--are completely \ndysfunctional modes of operation. Normally we&#39;re arguing against the \nformer position--all code before testing--because it&#39;s the more common \npathology. However the opposite is equally pathological, just not as \noften seen.\n\n-- \n﻿Elliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nJava I/O 2nd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeaulait.org/books/javaio2/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596527500/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/\n\n",
