I also have lots of test data, input files/ extected<br/>\nresults.  Also, developers keep adding to this list of files.<br/>\n I would like to write a testCase which would get all files from a<br/>\nfolder, and checked if the results are fine. (in a for/while loop).<br/>\nFor this, i will have a single test-case method. However, the problem<br/>\nis i would like the test&#39;s to <br/>\n 1) Run for all test-case and not stop if one fails.<br/>\n 2) Have more info in the TestResult. Not just details of the one<br/>\nmethod. Ideally, within the test case, i would like to add details<br/>\ninto the TEstResult indicating for which files the tests failed.<br/>\n How do i do this using junit ?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks, <br/>\n ~preetham</div>",
