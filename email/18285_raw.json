[...] I want to display some\n&gt; information at Type column in JUnitReport. But it seems that only the\n&gt; Assert Fail/Error information can be displayed. I want to display some\n&gt; Assert Sucessful information which I need in order to make the report\n&gt; more detailed.\n\nI understood what you wanted to do but, due to the way JUnit works,\nit&#39;s not possible without some heavy lifting. The basic issue is that\nthere&#39;s no &quot;event&quot; created for a successful assertion. Only exceptions\nthrown by the code under test or the test method itself create a\n&quot;failure&quot; event.\n\nTo put it another way, there&#39;s no way for JUnit to tell whether you\nexecuted one, two or a dozen assertions somewhere inside your test\nmethod. That is, unless you instrument the bytecode somehow (with\nwhich I cannot help since it&#39;s really not my field of expertise) and\nadd the necessary logging to where the assertion methods are invoked.\n\n\nOn 10/31/06, Bo Liu &lt;hitliubo@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; A guy said I could achieve my goal though modifying XSL.\n&gt; But I&#39;ve no idea about that.\n\nMe neither. Since the XML document being processed with the XSL\nstylesheet doesn&#39;t contain any information about assertions that were\nexecuted successfully, I really cannot imagine how the XSL could come\nup with that information on its own...\n\n\nLasse\n\n",
