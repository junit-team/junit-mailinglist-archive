B. Rainsberger &lt;jbrains@rogers. com&gt; wrote:\n!snip!\n&gt; 1. You&#39;re shipping shit, or\n&gt; 2. You&#39;re not shipping shit, which means you&#39;re a genius, which means\n&gt; you go faster than everyone else, anyway, whether you practise TDD or not.\n\nI think it&#39;s safe to say that most versions of Microsoft Windows have\nbeen Sierra Hotel 1 Tango, but apparently, that hasn&#39;t stopped it\nselling. This says nothing good about our industry or our users, I\nfear.\n\n&gt; I just can&#39;t buy the notion that it&#39;s possible to write good, untested\n&gt; code. Show it to me. Where is this good, untested code?\n\nI still maintain that it&#39;s all about quality. TDD is a tool to help\nyou build quality in to your software. It isn&#39;t, nor should it be a\nreligion. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s possible to write code that is &quot;good enough&quot;\nwithout TDD, but it&#39;ll never be high quality.\n\nAnd you&#39;ll never get code that&#39;s &quot;good enough&quot; accepted into flight\nsystems. They not only test the code, but they have independent\ntesters test the tests and certify the results. When Windows crashes\nit&#39;s annoying, when airplanes crash, it&#39;s at the far end of bad.\n\nIt&#39;s all about how much quality you want in your code. Quality has to\nbe built in, you can&#39;t go back an bolt it on. I use TDD whenever\npossible to build quality into my code. No one make me do it, but I\nfind that the more tests I write, the quicker I write them and the\nquicker I get to working code.\n\nSimon\n\n-- \nwww.simonpeter. org\n\n \n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n\n\n",
