I have something that I hacked up for our first<br/>\n&gt; &gt; homework, however, this kind of thing would be great to make into a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; tutorial that could be used by other classes.<br/>\n&gt; Lecture 11 from MIT 6.170 is the best pre-prepared doc I know of around <br/>\n&gt; here:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Electrical-Engineering-and-Computer-Science/6-170Laboratory-in-Software-EngineeringFall2001/LectureNotes/index.htm\">http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Electrical-Engineering-and-Computer-Science/6-170Laboratory-in-Software-EngineeringFall2001/LectureNotes/index.htm</a><br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;d be very interested in your materials, as well, if they&#39;re publicly <br/>\n&gt; available.

I like the formal introduction to JUnit.<br/>\nHow much experience would the typical person taking this course have?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe docs I have for this assignment are:<br/>\n<br/>\nAn assignment overview<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~bmaurer/15-211/s06/snake/docs/\">http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~bmaurer/15-211/s06/snake/docs/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nAn introduction to testing:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~bmaurer/15-211/s06/snake/docs/testing.html\">http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~bmaurer/15-211/s06/snake/docs/testing.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI think this documentation is coming in to the idea of testing from a<br/>\ndifferent angle than the MIT one: my goal here is to enable people to<br/>\nunderstand how JUnit will help them for this assignment, rather than<br/>\nto give the background of &quot;what is testing, why do we do it, etc&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust for some fun stats about how people are doing on this assignment<br/>\nso far: about 50 people have submitted a solution for the problem so<br/>\nfar (out of 190 students) -- it is due thursday at midnight (!!!). Of<br/>\nthese people, about 20 pass the tests for the circular buffer based<br/>\nqueue, about 15 pass them for hash table. Glancing over people&#39;s code,<br/>\nit looks like the people who submitted test cases along with their<br/>\ncode are doing much better on the submission system&#39;s tests (nb:<br/>\nstudents are not allowed to see their results on all of our test<br/>\ncases. So they are &quot;blind&quot; in some ways).<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re thinking of some fun ways we can put testing into the course.<br/>\nFor example, I was thinking of giving people partial credit for the<br/>\nassignment if they 1) wrote a patch for their own code and 2) wrote<br/>\ntest cases that caught their bugs. At dinner last night with another<br/>\nTA friend, we thought about an assignment where we would give people<br/>\n.jar files with a broken List/Queue/HashSet/whatever and they would<br/>\nhave to 1) figure out what was wrong and 2) write a test case.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;d be really fun to package an exercise like this and publish it. I<br/>\nthink that many CS courses don&#39;t teach people the testing skills they<br/>\nneed.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Ben</div>",
