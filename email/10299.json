    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1779935162\">Hi,<br/>\n<br/>\nI am creating a tool called the Automated Feature Tracer (AFT) which <br/>\nwill generate an execution trace of an entire test suite, storing <br/>\nthe results so that they can be viewed in JQuery (a query-based code <br/>\nbrowser for Eclipse).  The tool can tell you which code gets called <br/>\nby the test suite (and which doesn&#39;t).  It can also tell you which <br/>\ntest calls each piece of code and a little bit about the stack at <br/>\nthat point.  This would help you determine code coverage.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe AFT tool is not available for download yet (I&#39;m planning on <br/>\nfinihsing my thesis first), but I would be happy to make it <br/>\navailable and help you use it if you wanted to use the tool on your <br/>\nsystem.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\ngood luck,<br/>\n--andrew<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, Chad Woolley &lt;lists@t...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Vladimir Ritz Bossicard wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; murukeshcts wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; hai all,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;   Is there any tool available..that i can integrated with <br/>\nWSAD so that<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; i can check for the code coverage of the JUnitcode which  a <br/>\nperson<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; writes in his project.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; I don&#39;t know about WSAD integration, but there are several <br/>\ntest coverage <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; tools out there, including Clover and Jester.
