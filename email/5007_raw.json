I read the documentation on junit.org, but it&#39;s not really clear\n&gt; to me how I actually share a fixture. I&#39;m probably completely off\n&gt; track in regards to what the cookbook actually tries to explain,\n&gt; but I wish multiple tests (as separate classes) to work on a common\n&gt; set of fixtures. Is the proper way to have the fixtures as static\n&gt; variables in a separate class? From the documentation I gathered:\n\nThe desire for a shared fixture is a symptom of an opportunity to \nreduce the coupling of your design. For example, I was working on a \nsystem dealing with exchange rates. We had a global variable \n(essentially) for storing the rates. Different tests wanted different \nrates on different dates. We struggled with fancy schemes for only \ninstalling rates at certain times. In the end, we passed the rates \ninto the routines that needed them, which made testing simpler, made \nthe &quot;proper&quot; home for the rates in the application obvious, and \nenabled a bunch of other refactorings.\n\nKent\n\n\n",
