If you just change the JVM version, and let generics<br/>\n&gt; warnings stand, are you concerned there would be behavior changes?<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;d be a little surprised, but I can&#39;t say that I&#39;ve watched a large<br/>\n&gt; Java project go through that transition, so I don&#39;t know.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; David Saff<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On Wed, Oct 6, 2010 at 10:53 PM, rejohnsoca &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:regan.v.johnson@...\">regan.v.johnson@...</a>&lt;regan.v.johnson%40gmail.com&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve recently become responsible for a piece of software, that runs under<br/>\n&gt; java 1.4.2.  it has NO unit tests.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I want to move it to Java 6, but the CTO of my company is thinking that<br/>\n&gt; we should write a unit test suite first, so that we can make sure the<br/>\n&gt; upgrade doesn&#39;t break anything.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; That&#39;s a nice idea, and I&#39;m fully behind writing some unit tests.  I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; not sure that the plan is very practical, as I&#39;d really like to start with a<br/>\n&gt; recent version of JUnit -like 4.8, and I can&#39;t use it with java 1.4.2<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; We do have a reasonable suite of integration tests (which are NOT unit<br/>\n&gt; tests), to ensure that the upgrade goes well.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I was considering, rather than writing unit tests for java 1.4.2, and<br/>\n&gt; JUnit 3.8 and then potentially rewriting all of them to run under JUnit 4.8<br/>\n&gt; after the upgrade, it would be better to upgrade the JVM first, rely on<br/>\n&gt; integration tests, and then write unit tests from scratch for JUnit 4.8.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; What do other people do if they are in a similar situation?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
