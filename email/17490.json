I&#39;m not sure these recommendations are actually accepted by <br/>\n&gt;anyone except the people promulgating them, though. In particular, what <br/>\n&gt;I see is a lot of relatively smart people quietly blaming themselves for <br/>\n&gt;not understanding the complexity that&#39;s being foisted on them, and <br/>\n&gt;thinking they must be stupid for not understanding it. They may use <br/>\n&gt;interfaces when forced to do so by the frameworks, but they don&#39;t like <br/>\n&gt;it; and they certainly don&#39;t make it the first choice in their own code.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Interfaces have their place, but that place has been vastly overdrawn in <br/>\n&gt;the Java world. Most classes simply do not need more than one <br/>\n&gt;implementation.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Unless you&#39;re testing.</div>",
