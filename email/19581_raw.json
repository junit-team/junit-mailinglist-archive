This is done by filtering out all other tests.&quot;\n\nNow when I do that and pass that to the JUnitCore it still runs all\ntests/methods in that class :( .. am I missing something?\n(I suspect its related to the problem further down.. which in essence\nwould be that I cannot filter testcases that have a suite() method)\n\nFurthermore I tried to implement my own Filter which would just filter\nout all unwanted methods using a Description.\nNow there it seems that JUnit currently doesnt allow me to filter test\nclasses that contain the pre-v4 suite() methods\n(unless I explicitly create the Request using\nRequest.classWithoutSuiteMethod())\n\nIf I create the Request as ususal (Request.aClass()) the Runner that\ngets created internally is a AllTests Runner which doesnt implement\nFilterable.  As a result any filter.apply(Runner runner) calls have no\neffect and the test is executed according to the suite() method.\nSo effectively I cannot filter test classes that have a suite() method.\n\nIs that a desired behavior?\nShould this be documented?\n\n\nThis is some sample code to illustrate what I need to do to have a\nFilter actually be applied to my Test class (i.e. with that code I get\njust the testMethodName method invoked on the test class clazz ).\n\n// make a description with the methodname string\nfinal Description d2 = Description.createTestDescription(clazz,\ntestMethodName);\n\n// anonymous inner class filtering out all tests where the description\n// differs from this methodnames description\nf = new Filter(){\n     /** run only the test where the description matches */\n     public boolean shouldRun(Description d) {\n         return d2.equals(d);\n     }\n     public String describe() {\n         return &quot;allows only methodname = &quot;+ testMethodName;\n     }\n};\n\n// weird hack: because most of our test cases have a suite method\n// junit creates a AllTests runner which does not implement Filterable\n// and hence the filter has no effect (and all methods are invoked)\n// so as a fix we create a request for a class without suite() method\nrequest = Request.classWithoutSuiteMethod(clazz);\n\n\n\n\n  Thanks,\n\nSebastian\n\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
