What is the best gettin=\r\ng started guide for a Windows user out there?\n&gt; \n&gt; I assume you mean a gett=\r\ning-started guide for github in particular?  I\n&gt; found the on-site help suf=\r\nficient, but I think Kent found that things\n&gt; didn&#39;t Just Work on Windows. =\r\n Kent?\n&gt; \n&gt;   David Saff\n\n\n",
