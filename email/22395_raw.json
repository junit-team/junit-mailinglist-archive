Under this approach I definitely want the test marked ignored if the assumptions failed.\n\nWhat I really don&#39;t like is how do you know when an assumption fails the way the theory is implemented now?  How many of the data point combinations got skipped?  Why?  That&#39;s all very useful information.\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: junit@yahoogroups.com on behalf of Charlie Poole\nSent: Thu 2/11/2010 3:08 PM\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: RE: [junit] Something is bothering me about assumptions\n \nHi Rocco,\n\nYes, that&#39;s what I would expect when all assumptions fail.\n\nWhat happens when it&#39;s not a theory and an assumption is \nused and fails would have to depend on whether you want to \nsupport / encourage that use.\n\nCharlie\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On \n&gt; Behalf Of Pigneri, Rocco\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, February 11, 2010 10:37 AM\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: RE: [junit] Something is bothering me about assumptions\n&gt; \n&gt; Charlie,\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I think it is reasonable to ask that a test with an \n&gt; assumption fail (or at least be marked ignored) if *all* the \n&gt; test data fails the assumption.  A test that never executes \n&gt; because its assumption is never satisfied is \n&gt; counterproductive.  In this case, a failure would alert the \n&gt; user could fix the assumption, update the test data, or \n&gt; remove the test entirely if it&#39;s no longer needed.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Rocco\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; From: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On \n&gt; Behalf Of Charlie Poole\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, February 11, 2010 2:28 AM\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: RE: [junit] Something is bothering me about assumptions\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; It seems to me that the behavior you are asking for is \n&gt; appropriate if an assumption fails in a normal test as \n&gt; opposed to a theory.\n&gt; \n&gt; Charlie\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; &gt; From: junit@yahoogroups.com&lt;mailto:junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt; \n&gt; &gt; [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com&lt;mailto:junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt;] On \n&gt; &gt; Behalf Of Berin\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Tuesday, February 09, 2010 2:29 PM\n&gt; &gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com&lt;mailto:junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [junit] Something is bothering me about assumptions\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve seen in a few places that if an assumption fails, the test \n&gt; &gt; automatically passes. I then ran into the test case that \n&gt; confirms that \n&gt; &gt; action. Coming from the aspect that I want to have \n&gt; confidence that my \n&gt; &gt; code and tests are functioning properly, I honestly think \n&gt; that is the \n&gt; &gt; wrong action.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If an assumption is violated then it should be either a \n&gt; failure or at \n&gt; &gt; best ignored. To say the test passes because something \n&gt; failed is like \n&gt; &gt; saying you don&#39;t have a cavity because the dentist doesn&#39;t have the \n&gt; &gt; right tool. You don&#39;t know one way or the other, and the \n&gt; test won&#39;t be \n&gt; &gt; able to run properly when the assumption is violated.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; It&#39;s partly that reason that I don&#39;t use assumptions to \n&gt; begin with. If \n&gt; &gt; there needs to be a certain precondition to the test \n&gt; passing, I will \n&gt; &gt; add those assertions before I perform the action that needs to be \n&gt; &gt; tested. To me, it is a failure if the test could not be set up \n&gt; &gt; properly.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If you want something a little softer, then I recommend \n&gt; that a failed \n&gt; &gt; assumption is equivalent to the @Ignore annotation.\n&gt; &gt; You&#39;ll see in the summary that X number of tests were run, \n&gt; Y number of \n&gt; &gt; tests ignored, and Z number of tests failed.\n&gt; &gt; Although, for ignored tests I&#39;d like to see what the reason was \n&gt; &gt; (failed assumption or manually ignored through the attribute).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Making a test pass because of a failed assumption gives you a false \n&gt; &gt; sense of security about your code. What is happening is \n&gt; that the test \n&gt; &gt; just wasn&#39;t run, and there may be a legitimate problem \n&gt; hiding. To me \n&gt; &gt; that is the most dangerous part of that solution. I&#39;d \n&gt; rather get the \n&gt; &gt; bad news straight than trust faulty information.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Am I making sense?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
