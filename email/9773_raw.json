B. Rainsberger [mailto:jbrains@r...]\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, October 30, 2003 3:32 PM\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: Re: [junit] Detecting failure in tearDown()\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; jlindwall wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;d like to be able to determine in tearDown() whether or not the\n&gt; &gt; test succeeded (eg, success, fail, or error).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If you&#39;re curious why: If the test failed I&#39;d like to leave the\n&gt; &gt; database in it&#39;s current state to assist in manually determining \nwhat\n&gt; &gt; went wrong.  If the test succeeded I&#39;d like to cleanu p the db.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Using the standard runner I don&#39;t see any way to do this.  Do I \nhave\n&gt; &gt; to subclass the runners to add this feature?\n&gt; \n&gt; Either subclass the test runner or, if you know any AOP, use an \naspect \n&gt; to do it. You&#39;re changing the behavior of runBare(), so I don&#39;t see \nany \n&gt; alternative that doesn&#39;t lead to massive duplication.\n&gt; \n&gt; Good luck.\n&gt; -- \n&gt; J. B.
