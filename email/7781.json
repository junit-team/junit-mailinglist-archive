This contradicts with the idea that each test case should<br/>\n&gt; &gt;be<br/>\n&gt; &gt;independent. On the other hand the test cases are easy to write and I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; &gt;happy<br/>\n&gt; &gt;with the result. I wonder if there is any convincing reason to write a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;complex<br/>\n&gt; &gt;test case just so it can be totally independently from the others.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The only way to learn this lesson is to let yourself get into trouble doing<br/>\n&gt; it the &quot;easy&quot; way. If that day never comes, then don&#39;t worry about;<br/>\n&gt; otherwise, you&#39;ll see the problems when you hit them.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What you&#39;re doing is fine testing, but it&#39;s not Programmer Testing, so don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; treat it that way. Separate those tests into another suite and don&#39;t run them<br/>\n&gt; as frequently as you run the Programmer Tests.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Take care.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; J. B.

What is the mythical problem that would get<br/>\nme into trouble? Or is it just some design guideline or best practice that we<br/>\nshould follow when it make sense?<br/>\n<br/>\nI indeed put the persistence tests into a separate suite. It is not mean to run<br/>\neverytime it compiles. People need to know it write into the database and thus<br/>\nneed to have it properly setup. The create() method itself is fairly straight<br/>\nforward. It&#39;s just a few setString() and executeQuery(). I don&#39;t know if it<br/>\nworth the effort to mock the infrastructure to test these few statements really<br/>\ngot executed. The most interesting part for me is to see the queries got<br/>\nexecuted correctly and the fields do match the schema.<br/>\n<br/>\nWai Yip<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S. For some reason my mails to this list only get listed after I sent it for<br/>\n2 days. This make the conversion not very interactive.
