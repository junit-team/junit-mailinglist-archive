I try to be clearer with my problem.\n\nI have a method getConnection that uses a datasource to get a \nconnection from the connection buffer pool with the websphere \napplication server. I have some other methods that call this method. \n\nif those methods are called by a jsp or a servlet running on the \nserver then everything is fine. However, when any of those method are \ncalled by a Junit method, then getConnection fails. I need to say \nthat my JUnit tests also reside within the same web application \nworkspace in wsad.\n\nIf it comes to worst,I can write a getConnectionMock method that uses \na jdbc to get a connection but that means everytime I test my code, I \nneed to change the source code.\n\nIs there a way around it, I would really appreciate your replies in \nadvance.\n\nregards,\n\n\n",
