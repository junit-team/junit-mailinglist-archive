Sure, I could\n&gt; extend TestCase to periodically call a function in its TestResult\n&gt; (oops, it has no reference to it!), which would then propogate to the\n&gt; TestListener, and then somehow output the data. But...no. That was SO\n&gt; much more work than it seemed like it should have been. Too many\n&gt; private elements, too much reflection.\n&gt; \n&gt; But it seems like a useful feature. Perhaps one that others might have\n&gt; explored in the past. Has anyone looked at this? Is there an extension\n&gt; out there that implements it?\n\nJUnit was written to support test-first programming.\n\nWhen writing code test-first, tests cannot be that slow.\n\nNow you know why JUnit makes no room for such a feature.\n\nYou can easily build your own test runner with that feature built in. I \nthink the community would like to have it -- at least, the ones doing \nintegration testing or testing legacy code, where they have tests that \ntake more than fractions of a second.\n-- \nJ. B.
