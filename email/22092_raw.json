E.g.: run all tests that are not in (a) certain category=\r\n(s)? This is\n&gt;&gt; probably not difficult add in one way or another onto the c=\r\noncept of\n&gt;&gt; categories, but the answer to &quot;which test is now acctually inc=\r\nluded&quot; could\n&gt;&gt; become confusing in cases where a test is in an included an=\r\nd an excluded\n&gt;&gt; category. I would like to see something here that does not=\r\n require a lot of\n&gt;&gt; browsing through hierarchies of suites nad categories.=\r\n This may in my\n&gt;&gt; approach not well solved either as suites can extend on =\r\nother suites: if a\n&gt;&gt; referenced suite includes a certain test, it is execu=\r\nted even if the\n&gt;&gt; extending suite excludes a test.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; And more fundamen=\r\ntally: is the idea/need of exclusion meaningfull or just a\n&gt;&gt; result of bad=\r\nly organising tests (I&#39;d say no, but I may be wrong)?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; For what it&#39;s =\r\nworth, excluding tests is a very popular TestNG features. =C2=A0For\n&gt; examp=\r\nle, I use it when a few tests are broken and need to remain so for a\n&gt; whil=\r\ne: =C2=A0I put them in the group &quot;broken&quot;, which I always exclude during my=\r\n\n&gt; runs.\n&gt;\n&gt; When the time to ship approaches, I look at all the tests in t=\r\nhe &quot;broken&quot;\n&gt; category and I go fix them then.\n\nFor this particular use cas=\r\ne, I&#39;ve found @Ignore generally useful.  I\nalso really love Kevin Lawrence&#39;=\r\ns idea of marking tests with bug\nnumbers.  He does it like this:\n\n@Test pub=\r\nlic void shouldntDeleteAllTheUsersFiles() {\n  bug(34456);\n  ...\n}\n\nThe test=\r\n only starts failing once bug 34456 is marked as fixed in the\nbug system.  =\r\nOnce we have failing assumptions working as they truly\nshould, this will be=\r\n easy to implement on the JUnit side, although the\nbug-system integration w=\r\nould still be up to individual extenders or\nteams.\n\nAll this is to say that=\r\n I do get the idea of excluded categories, but\nthis particular instance doe=\r\nsn&#39;t immediately convince me.\n\n   David Saff\n\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt; ***C=C3=A9dric\n&gt; *\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --------=\r\n----------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
