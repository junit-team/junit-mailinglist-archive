If the team isn&#39;t already doing TDD this would be a good way \nto get them started.\n\nHow long is the presentation/class?  You could actually run them through \na small app as an exercise: seeing is believing, doing is converting. ;)\n\n-- \nJason Rogers\n\n I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I,\n but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in\n the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved\n me, and gave himself for me.\n    Galatians 2:20\n\n\n (&#92; /)\n  0 0     www.squeak.org\n  =*= \n\n\n",
