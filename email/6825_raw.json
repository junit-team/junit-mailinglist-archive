I&#39;ve done the same thing in many production systems,\nand I rarely test it.\n\nNote that Kent Beck says, right in the first page or two of his chapter\non testing in _Extreme Programming Explained_, you should not write\ntests for things that seem simple and unlikely to break. (I&#39;d quote it,\nbut I&#39;m at home right now and the book is at work.)\n\nI see this an example of such a situation.\n\n&gt; &gt; Err...if you&#39;re creating new classes for the mock objects, aren&#39;t you\n&gt; &gt; adding extra code just for testability?\n&gt;\n&gt; Sort of -- but test code that doesn&#39;t have to ship with the product, and\n&gt; which is completely decoupled from the design and implementation of the\n&gt; product, unlike test code added to the class itself.\n\nMy concern is not about shipping it with the product; my concern is\nthat, whether it ships or not, it&#39;s extra code to write and maintain.\nThat&#39;s extra cost. The question is, are you likely to get more from that\ninvestment than you spend on it?\n\n&gt; It doesn&#39;t have to much work at all if you use an IDE like Eclipse and/or a\n&gt; tool like Mockmaker (http://www.mockmaker.org/).\n\nRight. But it&#39;s still more than no work at all.\n\n&gt; I am debating the general principle of whether one should modify\n&gt; implementation code to make it testable, and you&#39;re talking about\n&gt; particular cases *when* it might be better. I can&#39;t argue with that.\n\nWell, I saw it, perhaps incorrectly, as you saying &quot;there is never\na case where it&#39;s better to modify implementation code to make it\ntestable,&quot; and I presented a single case that I thought disproved this\nstatement. (At the very least, it does for me. I guess it&#39;s a matter of\nopinion whether or not it does for others.)\n\n&gt; Would we both agree that the best possible solution would be to avoid\n&gt; the problem altogether by doing test driven development?\n\nI wouldn&#39;t, because it was test-driven development that drove me to the\nabove solution in the first place. I thought, &quot;Darn, to test this I&#39;ve\ngot to make another mock object here, and pass it a database connection.\nWhy not just pass in the connection directly, and save myself the effort?&quot;\n\ncjs\n-- \nCurt Sampson  &lt;cjs@...&gt;   +81 90 7737 2974   http://www.netbsd.org\n    Don&#39;t you know, in this new Dark Age, we&#39;re all light.  --XTC\n\n",
