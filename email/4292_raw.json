I am in charge of getting a test\nframework written for an application with over 200K lines of code that does\nnot have a single test case yet.  Yikes!  It is very confusing about how to\nstart and how to set up an application level test suite that will touch all\nthe classes.  I would be willing to write about my experiences once I\nfigure it out, but that may be some time.\n\nAnother thing that would be helpful is some best practices on how to write\ncode that will be easy to test.\n\n-Phil\n\n\n\n                                                                                       \n                    &quot;Ryan P                                                            \n                    Ripley&quot;               To:     &lt;junit@yahoogroups.com&gt;              \n                    &lt;ryan.ripley@z        cc:                                          \n                    immer.com&gt;            Subject:     RE: [junit] Re: JUnit bug for   \n                                          XML testing?                                 \n                    03/07/2002                                                         \n                    02:53 PM                                                           \n                    Please respond                                                     \n                    to junit                                                           \n                                                                                       \n                                                                                       \n\n\n\n\n\nWhat kind of documentation would be required?

I know, I know... if I don&#39;t like it I should do\n&gt; better... [...]\n\nBe critical -- we&#39;ll probably all agree with you. What kind of\ndocumentation is\nmissing? I, for one, have written a Starter&#39;s Guide. Mike Clark has a\nreally\ngood primer. Is this not the documentation you need? Maybe someone with\nsome\nexperience could be convinced to share some knowledge if there&#39;s an area\nof the\nframework, its usage or testing patterns that you need to know about.\n\nGo to the Articles section of http://www.junit.org -- it may help.\n\nJ.
