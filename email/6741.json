Please see my comments below.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; &gt;As far as I learned, usually we shall test behaviour and design, <br/>\n&gt; &gt;not specific classes and methods. This allows us to keep tests <br/>\n&gt; &gt;task-oriented and not implementation-oriented.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Considering this, I see the following possible decisions regarding<br/>\n&gt; &gt;tests organization: <br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;1. For Functional tests:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;    - all tests for a use case (and, possibly, alternative flows) are <br/>\n&gt; &gt;    placed into a single package with an appropriate name. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Generally there is one test per use case scenario (different flow<br/>\n&gt; through the use case). Choosing to write more or fewer tests should be<br/>\n&gt; done thoughtfully.<br/>\n<br/>\n  In my experience, there are several alternative flows for a ordinary<br/>\n  use case. And I see reasonable to test at least two of them: basic<br/>\n  flow and error flow. What do you think?<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;    - each test scenario is placed into single class with appropriate<br/>\n&gt; name.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Each use case scenario is a test. Test classes should almost always<br/>\n&gt; evolve based around a fixture, not some other arbitrary organization<br/>\n&gt; mechanism. A given use case may be implemented as its own Customer Test<br/>\n&gt; class, but it is usually better to let the organization of tests into<br/>\n&gt; TestCase implementations depend on shared fixture requirements.<br/>\n<br/>\n  But we can share fixtures using inheritance as well. I have two points here:<br/>\n<br/>\n   - for a complicated test case it may be better to keep it in a separate class.<br/>\n   - It is easier to get full list of existing functional tests if we put<br/>\n     each test case into a single class. Getting the list is quite usual<br/>\n     task requested by QA department or customer (or I&#39;m wrong here?)<br/>\n     <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;2. For Unit tests:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;    - test package shall be the same as for the production code, <br/>\n&gt; &gt;    but it is better to use a different source tree.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;    - for simple classes (such as value objects) it is OK to name<br/>\n&gt; &gt;    test classes after the name of the class under test <br/>\n&gt; &gt;    (like UTestFooBar or FooBarTest). Names of test methods,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;    in its turn, may include the name of the tested method.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;    - for complex classes, which require a complex fixture to be set,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;    test case class shall be named using fixture description. <br/>\n&gt; &gt;    (The issue was discussed previously on this list).<br/>\n&gt; &gt;    Test method name in this case shall describe the tested behaviour.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The last point is the general case, and the previous points are special<br/>\n&gt; cases when the tests (not the code under test) are very simple.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Agreed. The issue here is to fugure out proper fixture class when you <br/>\n  want to add a new test (for instance, when you find a bug). The task <br/>\n  may become more complicated if you never seen the code before and there<br/>\n  are nobody to ask (bad things happen). I see two possible solutions:<br/>\n<br/>\n   - Use IDE features to find usages of tested code (if you have such IDE)<br/>\n   - Make a error in the production code and see which test breaks.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;3. For Integration Tests:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;    - I suggest, names of Integration tests must differ from Unit<br/>\n&gt; tests.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;    Usually, integration tests run longer, and consequently, more<br/>\n&gt; seldom. <br/>\n&gt; &gt;    That&#39;s why it is convinient to name them differently. One may name<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;    unit tests using UTest prefix, anf Integration tests using ITest<br/>\n&gt; &gt;prefix.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On a past project, we used tag interfaces to distinguish Programmer<br/>\n&gt; Tests from Customer Tests. This made it easy to write a TestRunner that<br/>\n&gt; picked one or the other or both when building a test suite. You may<br/>\n&gt; find this technique useful.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I saw an article where static variable with specific value was used <br/>\n  to mark a test and TestSuite class used reflection to include only <br/>\n  tests with specific value of the variable. It is quite close to your<br/>\n  approach.<br/>\n<br/>\n  What for me, I use ant to build/run my test suites. That&#39;s why I <br/>\n  suggest class naming approach.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Also, place the different kinds of tests in different packages in order<br/>\n&gt; to reduce the number of naming collisions.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Sorry, I don&#39;t see your point clearly. Are you talking about unit tests,<br/>\n  functional tests?<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have to say that your list of points is excellent and should be<br/>\n&gt; turned into a short article on the subject.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Thank you very much. Actually, I thought about it and I&#39;ll possibly<br/>\n  try to write one.<br/>\n<br/>\n  With best regards,<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nKirill Maximov aka KIR<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kir@...\">kir@...</a> | <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.maxkir.com/\">http://www.maxkir.com/</a><br/>\nSt.Petersburg, Russia </span></blockquote></div>",
