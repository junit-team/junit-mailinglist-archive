At least to a certain extent.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well said.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are obvious disagreements and mis-understandings about the ways<br/>\ndevelopers should test: manual/automated, test first/during/after,<br/>\ntest-some/test-everything, etc., but we all seem to agree that some<br/>\n(non-trivial) amount of testing is part of a developer&#39;s job.  This is<br/>\nnot a surprising result given the sample of people who participate in<br/>\nthis forum.  What is somewhat surprising is that today most developers<br/>\nwill readily agree with that statement as well (this would not have<br/>\nbeen the case 5-10 years ago).<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is, however, a difference between agreeing with something and<br/>\npracticing it.  The state of affairs today is that most software<br/>\ndevelopment organizations and individual developers agree that<br/>\ndeveloper testing is the right thing to do - but very few actually do<br/>\nit, or do it well enough.  I call this &quot;The Developer Testing Paradox&quot;<br/>\nand wrote about in some detail on developertesting.com:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.developertesting.com/archives/month200501/20050127-TheDeveloperTestingParadox.html\">http://www.developertesting.com/archives/month200501/20050127-TheDeveloperTestingParadox.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I see on this forum (and others) is that we (the thought leaders<br/>\nand active promoters of developer testing) spend too much time arguing<br/>\nwith each-other about the best way to do developer testing instead of<br/>\nagreeing on the common ground and joining  forces to promote the core<br/>\nidea that we all agree upon.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I was a developer exploring the idea of unit testing and wanting to<br/>\nlearn more about it and JUnit/TestNG/Agitator/you-name-it, I would<br/>\nfind some of the arguments we have to be a turn-off: &quot;I&#39;d really like<br/>\nto try developer testing, but these people can&#39;t even agree amongst<br/>\nthemselves on how to go about it.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe it&#39;s fine and healthy to have differing opinions and believe<br/>\nin different approaches to developer testing, but I can&#39;t help<br/>\nthinking that, compared to the reality that the vast majority of<br/>\ndevelopers and organizations are not practicing developer testing in<br/>\nthe first place, we are splitting hairs.<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe the best way to grow the ranks of people who become test<br/>\ninfected is to lower the barriers to entry, to offer a variety of<br/>\napproaches to suit most tastes and preferences: <br/>\n<br/>\nTest-first or test-last? Either one as long as you test.  <br/>\nJUnit or TestNG? Whatever feels most natural to you.  <br/>\nManual or Automated? Take your pick, mix-and-match, both are good.<br/>\n<br/>\nInstead of attacking or confronting people who bring other approaches,<br/>\nviews, and tools to the table, we should welcome them because we need<br/>\nmore people on our side and more/better tools and options to get more<br/>\npeople to join the ranks of test-infected developers.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my opinion, our ranks are still too small for us to act in a<br/>\ndivisive way, make the entry barrier too high, or be too inflexible<br/>\nabout the way people choose to approach their testing.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlberto</div>",
