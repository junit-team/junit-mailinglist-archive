[1]\n&gt; \n&gt; Why exactly do the return values need to be different?  \n\nI think I screwed up :-)  You should have read:  ( :-) )\n\nyou have to choose the input of your tests so that your tests go through \nall conditions.  Which is nothing new :-)\n\nI was thinking of a method returning one different flag per path.  So \nthe easiest way to check if you have gone through all paths is to [1].\n\n&gt; However, do you really need to know which path the code took?\n\nyou only need to be certain that you tested all paths.\n\n&gt; Isn&#39;t it sufficient to test that you get the correct return value for \n&gt; whatever combinations of input values you choose to test with?\n\nyes and no.  writing tests does not guarantee that you have tested all \npaths.  And since it&#39;s impossible to test every input values, a good \nalternative is to choose the input value that give you the most feedback.\n\n-Vladimir\n\n-- \nVladimir Bossicard\nwww.bossicard.com\n\n\n",
