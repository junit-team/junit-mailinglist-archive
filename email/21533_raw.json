And if f=\r\n() in g() is tested ok, it&#39;s also ok in\n&gt; &gt; g(). If the test of f() is fail=\r\ned, the global test is failed too.\n&gt; &gt; I want that the result based on beyo=\r\nnd code succeed, but it is failed.What\n&gt; &gt; can I do if I want to accomplish=\r\n that function?\n&gt; &gt; Thanks a lot!\n&gt; \n&gt; Hi,\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m not sure I quite follow=\r\n. Do you mean perhaps that you&#39;d like to\n&gt; specify dependencies between tes=\r\nts; i.e. if test A fails, then don&#39;t\n&gt; bother running tests B, C, D and E?\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; Could you try to re-state the problem that you&#39;re trying to solve so\n&gt;=\r\n that we can have a better understanding and give you a more accurate\n&gt; ans=\r\nwer?\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; \n&gt; James\n&gt;\nI am so sorry. My English is very poor, so I=\r\n can just try to make myself understood a little better. \nOK,let&#39;s test the=\r\n following codes with junit4.\n1.\n@Test(expected =3D NullPointerException.cl=\r\nass)\npublic void f1(){\nString s =3D null;\nSystem.out.println(s.length());\n}=\r\n\nIf I run f1(), the result will be that junit4 test runs without Exceptions=\r\n or Errors, because the test f1() obtains its expected Exception. Can you f=\r\nollow me here?\n\n2.\n@Test\npublic void f2(){\nString s =3D null;\nSystem.out.pr=\r\nintln(s.length());\n}\nIf I run f2(), the result will be that junit4 test run=\r\ns with an Exception called NullPointerException, which is not expected. If =\r\nyou can&#39;t understand what I say here, I have to learn English harder.\n\n3.\n@=\r\nTest(expected =3D NullPointerException.class)\npublic void f3(){\nString s =\r\n=3D null;\nSystem.out.println(s.length());\n}\nThe content in f3() is the same=\r\n as in f1(), so if I run f3(), the result is the same as f1().\n\n4.\n@Test\npu=\r\nblic void g(){\n  f1();\n  f3();\n}\nI want to use f1() test and f3() test in g=\r\n(), because the test&#39;s result of f1() and of f3() above is that it runs wit=\r\nhout Exceptions or Errors. So I(not junit4&#39;s @test) expected if I run g(), =\r\nthe result is that it runs without Exceptions or Errors too. Can you follow=\r\n me here? But the mechanism of junit4 does not like I expected. When I run =\r\ng(), the actual result is that it runs with an Exception called NullPointer=\r\nException.\n  If I wanna immplement the function I expected above, what shal=\r\nl I do? Why I wanna the function? Because I wanna use reflect machanism to =\r\nsimplify the whole test in our project.\n  If you can&#39;t follow me above, I s=\r\net an additional example as follows:\n5.  \n@Test\npublic void g1(){\n  f1();\n =\r\n f2();\n}\nIf I run g1(), the result I expected is that it runs with the Null=\r\nPointerException. Because the result in test f2() is that it runs with the =\r\nNullPointerException. And because the result in test f1() is that it runs w=\r\nithout any Exception, so the result in g1() is that it runs with the NullPo=\r\ninterException, and the NullPointerException causes by f2().\nThat&#39;s what I =\r\nwanna do. If you haven&#39;t understand, I can just say very very sorry. I have=\r\n try my best.  \n\n\n",
