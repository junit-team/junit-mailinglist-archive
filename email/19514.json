In 4.3, we introduced some run-time math magic to make up for<br/>\n&gt; the lack of type-expansion once we had removed most of the primitive<br/>\n&gt; type assertEquals methods. Thus, it became the case, somewhat<br/>\n&gt; accidentally, that this would pass:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; assertEquals(new Integer(1), new Long(1)); // A<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; However, it simultaneously became the case that this would also pass:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; assertEquals(new BigDecimal(&quot;1.0&quot;), new BigDecimal(&quot;1.1&quot;)); // B<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Line B should certainly fail. The simplest thing to do is to remove<br/>\n&gt; our math magic, introduce assertEquals(long, long), etc, and let<br/>\n&gt; numerical classes define their own equality. This means that line A<br/>\n&gt; will now fail, since that&#39;s how Integer.equals() is defined. This is<br/>\n&gt; a small behavior change, but a &quot;regression&quot; of sorts.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If anyone believes this is a damaging decision, please let me know.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think it makes the most sense to behave consistently with equals(), <br/>\nrather than try to compensate for its behavior. It&#39;s probably poor <br/>\ndesign to compare Integer objects with Long objects, anyway.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
