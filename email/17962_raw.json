The =\r\nterm &quot;optimization for code completion&quot; attempts to\n&gt; capture the notion th=\r\nat naming of Classes and Methods can be done in\n&gt; a manner that provides mo=\r\nre (immediate) clarity within an IDE\n&gt; context.\n&gt;\n&gt; In an earlier post - yo=\r\nu referred to it as adding &quot;adding metadata\n&gt; to that method&quot; name.  In add=\r\nition to code completion, having all\n&gt; like method names begin with a presc=\r\nribed verb is useful for sorting\n&gt; methods.\n\n\nI agree.  Code completion is =\r\none of the main reasons why I enforce strictly\nthe get/set convention throu=\r\nghout my code and everyone around me.\n\nYou are right that currently, code c=\r\nompletion hasn&#39;t been extended to\nannotations, so the &quot;test&quot; prefix is more=\r\n convenient.  I believe it&#39;s just a\nmatter of time before IDE&#39;s catch up on=\r\n that level, though, and as a matter\nof fact, Eclipse has been supporting c=\r\nategories since\n3.2&lt;http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/drops/R-3=\r\n.2-200606291905/new_noteworthy/eclipse-news-part2.html&gt;(JavaDoc\ntags you pu=\r\nt on top of your methods, such as &quot;getter&quot; or &quot;setter&quot;,\nand which you can t=\r\nhen specify in the outline view).\n\nAt any rate, just because you start usin=\r\ng annotations doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t\nkeep starting your test method names w=\r\nith &quot;test&quot;.\n\n\n&gt; The strength of your conviction in this area is causing me =\r\nto\n&gt; wonder.  Am I the only Java &quot;guy&quot; that finds benefit (on a fifteen\n&gt; d=\r\neveloper project on two continents) in having a test method begin\n&gt; with he=\r\n word &quot;test&quot; - or, a callback method begin with &quot;pre&quot;\n&gt; or &quot;post&quot; - or, a t=\r\nransparent persistence registration begin\n&gt; with &quot;register&quot;???\n\n\nNo, you&#39;re=\r\n not.  Quite a few TestNG users keep using &quot;test&quot;, and that&#39;s\nfine.\n\nI&#39;m no=\r\nt trying to convince anyone to abandon this idea, but I do want to\nmake a f=\r\new points regarding the adequacy of using annotations in the testing\narea, =\r\nbecause I think they are a perfect tool for this job.\n\n&gt; Following your log=\r\nic, shouldn&#39;t you rename testFoo() to ignoreFoo () then?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Sure.  Exc=\r\nept for the fact that &quot;test&quot; is a long-term perscription\n&gt; and &quot;ignore&quot; is =\r\n(presumably) transitory.  The nuances around which\n&gt; capability is appropri=\r\natly declared and which capability is\n&gt; appropriately inherited are more su=\r\nbtle than a verb study.\n&gt;\n&gt; In this case, &quot;ignore&quot; is a contextual assignme=\r\nnt.  It might\n&gt; mean, &quot;ignore until I get this test method working&quot;.  Where=\r\nas &quot;test&quot;\n&gt; means &quot;always test&quot; unless declared otherwise.  &quot;Ignore&quot; is\n&gt; (=\r\nconceptual) override of &quot;test&quot;.  They are not peers - so, a\n&gt; different sty=\r\nlistic implementation might be warranted.\n\n\nSince we&#39;re talking stylistic i=\r\nssues here, I would point out that @Ignore is\na very poor choice for this p=\r\nurpose, since it doesn&#39;t say much about &quot;ignore\nwhat?&quot;.  Or, in this case, =\r\n&quot;ignored by what?&quot;.\n\nThe equivalent in TestNG is an attribute:  @Test(enabl=\r\ned =3D false), which\nmakes more sense in my opinion.  An even better choice=\r\n is to put the method\nin an ignored group (@Test(groups =3D {&quot;ignored&quot;}) an=\r\nd then exclude that group\nfrom your runs.  The benefit of this approach is =\r\nthat the HTML reports list\nall the groups that have been included and exclu=\r\nded, so it&#39;s very easy to\nget a quick list of all the methods currently bei=\r\nng ignored.\n\n-- \nC=E9dric\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been re=\r\nmoved]\n\n\n",
