(&quot;Hmmm. We just saw and fixed a\n&gt; failure like such-and-such, does that mean that this other thing\n&gt; might be able to fail like that, too? Let&#39;s write a test and find\n&gt; out.&quot;)\n\n&gt; It sounds to me like the &quot;scripted testing&quot; he&#39;s talking about in\n&gt; that article is not XP-style testing, where you run the tests as you\n&gt; come up with them, but instead one where you create a whole series\n&gt; of tests before you take them to the code. Especially where he says:\n\n&gt; Scripting has its place. I can imagine testing situations where\n&gt; efficiency and repeatability are so important that we should script\n&gt; or automate them.\n\n&gt; I can&#39;t imagine a situation where efficiency and repeatability are\n&gt; *not* important enough to script the tests! But if you can somehow\n&gt; manipulate the system quickly enough to do exploratory testing, you\n&gt; can probably come up with a way for the script to manipulate the\n&gt; system even more quickly, and then just add your tests to the\n&gt; script, rather than throwing them away as soon as you&#39;ve tried them\n&gt; out.\n\ns/script/suite\n\nThis is why, to me, GUI test automation based on JUnit is the way to\ngo:\n\n* good tool support\n\n* standard framework\n\n* lotsa mindshare among coders\n\n* tests can be refactored with code\n\n* tests can be easily saved for regression\n\nMichael Silverstein Tue Aug 26, 2003  3:44 pm\n&gt; The good part of ET is that you spend less time coming up with\n&gt; scripts and automating and more time testing, so you have a greater\n&gt; liklihood of going down a path you might not otherwise have tested.\n&gt; The bad part, obviously, is that because there is no automation some\n&gt; paths may only get hit once, possibly before a defect is ever\n&gt; inserted there.\n\nAnd regression testing remains tedious, unless you throw your tests\nback in the bucket. Why not do that? (&quot;2 words: test maintenance&quot; :-)\n\nOn Thu, 28 Aug 2003, Michael Silverstein wrote:\n&gt; For a better defense of ET and discussion of the limitation of\n&gt; automation than I could ever provide, you should read some of Cem\n&gt; Kaner&#39;s articles on http://www.kaner.com/. Note that I don&#39;t agree\n&gt; with a lot of it.\n\nMichael Silverstein Thu Aug 28, 2003  7:15 pm\n&gt; To clarify my sentence above, the last word &quot;it&quot; equates to things\n&gt; written on the site about exploratory testing, as well as a lot of\n&gt; negatives about test automation. I already mentioned what I don&#39;t\n&gt; like about ET in my previous append and this group/XP/agile people\n&gt; can articulate the advantages of automation better than I. If you\n&gt; want to dig, Mr. Kaner and I went back and forth a bit in on this\n&gt; subject in January of this year on the software-testing group. Of\n&gt; course there&#39;s always more to be said but not enough time. Anyway,\n&gt; to reiterate a different append of mine, if you want to have a\n&gt; good/fun/heated conversation on these subjects with peple who have\n&gt; very strong, well earned opinions you should take this subject to\n&gt; the sodtware-testing group.\n\nand for similarly insightful debate regarding GUI test automation,\nconsider \n\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/java-gui-testing/\n\nCurt Sampson Fri Aug 29, 2003  3:50 am\n&gt; Funny, you know I am in general agreement with all he&#39;s saying about\n&gt; GUI test automation, and how it&#39;s not much use. His problem is that\n&gt; he&#39;s testing in the wrong place. He wants to test if the printer\n&gt; driver gets the margins correct, and he ends up testing the entire\n&gt; GUI, too. He&#39;s a victim of the &quot;separate the testers and the\n&gt; programmers&quot; method of development.\n\n&gt; If you replace ten difficult GUI tests with one difficult GUI test\n&gt; and ten easier tests at a lower level, suddenly you find your test\n&gt; automation has become much easier.\n\nYes. By all means, have a thin GUI, and test your backend, but then\nautomate a &quot;real&quot; scenario driving your GUI, to make _sure_ that the V\nreally goes with the M and the C the way you think it does :-) Plus,\nthe GUI automation is documentation, possibly even a deliverable (who\nneeds Flash ?-)\n\n\n\n",
