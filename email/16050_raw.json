However, for commercial software development, is this\n&gt; still possible ?\n\nDo commercial projects not also need to deliver high-quality systems \nquickly?\n\n&gt; Although I knew JUnit and other JUnit-based open-source tools for a\n&gt; couple of years, my company and team never really enbrace it. The\n&gt; major reason is Product Managers always want to add cool features to\n&gt; the system quickly while programmers find the schedule is always too\n&gt; tight to spend any extra time to write testing.\n\nThis assumes that testing requires extra time. Very good testing means \nvery few defects, which means less overall cost to deliver the same \nsoftware. It is important to compare the cost of the /entire/ \ndevelopment process, and not just the cost of typing code.\n\n&gt; I know from the mail list and books that we can take lots of advantage\n&gt; of JUnit-based testing, I myself have no real hands-on experience on\n&gt; it. So here are my questions:\n&gt; \n&gt; * Will Junit-based testing make the project time longer or shorter ?\n&gt; Any hard statistic data ? ( Here I mean commercial project rather than\n&gt; open-source project. )\n\nThis depends on your time horizon. How far ahead are you planning? To \nuse JUnit effectively requires investment in learning. If you are \ndiligent in learning, you will see positive return on the investment, \nbut not immediately.\n\nFor a plain Java project (not J2EE), I have a team with 3 programmers \nwho report positive overall return on investment after 3 months.\n\nFor a J2EE project, it often takes longer. At least 6 months and maybe 1 \nyear.\n\nOf course, these numbers are based on my informal observations and are \nnot hard, scientific or statistical data.\n\n&gt; * One intersting point I found is that after Junit-based testing is\n&gt; introduced, programmers tend to use IDE debugger much less than\n&gt; before.  This would save lots of time. Is that true ?\n\nI only use the debugger to step through code without enough tests. In \nthe equivalent of the past 3 months, I have spent less than 1 hour in \nthe debugger. It is a big time savings for me.\n\n&gt; * Some guys say JUnit is good for biz / util code testing. But for web\n&gt; application development, where HTML/javascript would be root cause of\n&gt; lots of bugs, Junit is not so powerful. Any comments ?\n\nI don&#39;t believe that&#39;s true, but that doesn&#39;t matter. Even if I assume \nit is true, most of the high-priority defects in projects I coach are \nbusiness logic problems, so if we eliminate 70% of those, we have a lot \nof time to figure out how to test HTML and Javascript. (_JUnit Recipes_ \nalready provides a lot of advice on testing J2EE components and \napplications. Also Google &quot;Test-Driven J2EE&quot;.)\n\n&gt; * How can I convince managers and programmers that JUnit-based is\n&gt; really possible for commercial software development ? Any differnece\n&gt; from open-source projects ?\n\nWhat does it mean for JUnit to be possible? What results do they expect?\n-- \nJ. B.
