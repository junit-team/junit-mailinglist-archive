Its core is an object, say APP, static reference of which<br/>\nis kept in the main class (much like in singleton, but the<br/>\nconstructor&#39;s not private; for the above stated reasons I don&#39;t want<br/>\nto discuss this detail).<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m only a rookie in programming as such and might not know things<br/>\nthat are second nature to you. But having a singleton-like<br/>\narchitecture seems to me to contradict the tests separation<br/>\nprinciple... Every time I call a static method of my APP class, I use<br/>\nthe same object... <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd what&#39;s what started to give me trouble recently. It is possible to<br/>\ninitialize this APP object, loading GUI modules or not. To be honest,<br/>\nusing it without UI is a workaround of mine, which I implemented to be<br/>\nsomewhat closer to unit testing, although my tasks are actually<br/>\nregular regression tests, examining whole big chunks of<br/>\nfunctionality... So in a part of my tests that don&#39;t need the<br/>\ngraphical modules, I simply don&#39;t load them. However, I&#39;ve recently<br/>\nbeen trying out some other type of tests that operate on a<br/>\nfull-fledged application, which needs loading the UI. And that&#39;s where<br/>\nthe problem begins - trying to load those modules, having used the<br/>\napplication without them in previous tests, is in the application, as<br/>\nit currently is, impossible (and don&#39;t think that anyone will take<br/>\ngrumbling of a humble tester into consideration).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the question to you guys is as follows: should I give up hope that<br/>\nmy job has anything to do with unit testing, and allow dosens of funny<br/>\nwindows to jump here and fro while basic functionality is being<br/>\nchecked or rather do you see any other possibility to solve my problem<br/>\nthat I, humble rookie, overlooked?<br/>\n<br/>\nGrateful for any answer,<br/>\n<br/>\nAnna</div>",
