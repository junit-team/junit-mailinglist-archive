I have came <br/>\nacross various tools including XJB, EJBUnit, Embedded Jboss, Cactus, etc..  I am just <br/>\nwondering which solution is the most mature and most supported by the community.  I need <br/>\nto be able to mock up JNDI so that I can test the persistance in my EJB&#39;s.  I would like to test <br/>\noutside the container as I hear this is the best method for testing EJBs.  Can anyone give me <br/>\nsome suggestions and point me in the right direction.  Any help would be greatly appreciate, <br/>\na tutorial anything that will help get me started.  I would preferable like a solution that can fit <br/>\ninto a night build and test enviornment.  We use Continuum to build and test our companies <br/>\ncode everynight.  If I could drive the EJB test cases from a Maven pom that would be a bonus.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance,<br/>\n<br/>\nVince</div>",
