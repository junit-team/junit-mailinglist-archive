After some time, maybe they&#39;ll see that it has no benefit and<br/>\nthey&#39;ll stop doing it.  Or maybe there is a real benefit (I don&#39;t see any but I<br/>\ncan be wrong).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I also object using System.out.println(&quot;...&quot;) in JUnit tests. Some <br/>\n&gt; coworkers do this. Maybe they understand the nature of JUnit tests <br/>\n&gt; one time.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>wait until you have 1000 tests... the more tests, the more outputs and it will<br/>\nbe harder and harder to separate the good (infos why a test failed) and the bad<br/>\n(noise about passing tests).<br/>\n<br/>\nBut it would be interesting to know _what_ they are printing out.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes it&#39;s handy to know the testcase that is currently running (typically<br/>\nif you have suddently an infinite loop...):<br/>\n- the bad solution is to add a println() at the beginning of the test<br/>\n- the good solution is to write a listener that outputs the name of the<br/>\ncurrently running test.  You can then register/deregister the listener if you<br/>\nneed it or not.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Vladimir<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nVladimir R. Bossicard<br/>\nwww.bossicard.com</div>",
