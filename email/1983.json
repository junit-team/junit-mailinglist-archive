    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-366387288\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt; I would like to hear everyones thoughts on the topic.  <br/>\n    &gt; Your point about AT&#39;s<br/>\n    &gt; is well taken.<br/>\n    &gt; <br/>\n    &gt; To my way of thinking, flawed though it might be, a unit <br/>\n    &gt; describes one<br/>\n    &gt; scenario of one behavior.  For example, if we&#39;re talking <br/>\n    &gt; about an ordering<br/>\n    &gt; system, a specified product might exist in a number of <br/>\n    &gt; states, onhand and<br/>\n    &gt; not committed, on hand but committed, on order (imminent <br/>\n    &gt; arrival), on order<br/>\n    &gt; (protracted arrival), out of stock at the supplier (undetermined<br/>\n    &gt; availability) or perhaps even never available again.  A <br/>\n    &gt; customer wanting to<br/>\n    &gt; order that product might have patterned responses for <br/>\n    &gt; each of these states.<br/>\n    &gt; If the task at hand is to develop a system that will <br/>\n    &gt; automate the response<br/>\n    &gt; to a customer placing an order for this item, each <br/>\n    &gt; possible state and<br/>\n    &gt; outcome combination constitutes a unit.  Each test case <br/>\n    &gt; contributing its<br/>\n    &gt; behavioral rules to the design.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know, Jason.  It seems to me that unit is, for all intensive<br/>\npurposes, the class to be tested.  If all of these scenarios are present in<br/>\nthat one class, then they can be tested at the &quot;unit&quot; level.  If the<br/>\nscenarios are a combination of objects and their interactions, I think the<br/>\ntest raises to the &quot;acceptance&quot; level.  The thing I take issue with is your<br/>\nuse of the term &#39;scenarios&#39;, because it conjures up ATs in my mind, but that<br/>\nmay just be me.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt all comes down to what is the best way to write unit tests.  Right?<br/>\nThat&#39;s a heated discussion from which I have learned to stay away (for the<br/>\nmost part).  Everyone has their style and most are very adamant about it.<br/>\nThere are some general principles that we can all agree upon, but once that<br/>\nis done, the proofs are more or less stylistic.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome general principles can be found at<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-12-2000/jw-1221-junit-2.html\">http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-12-2000/jw-1221-junit-2.html</a>&gt;.  I<br/>\ndon&#39;t agree with the all of the things listed there, but most of it sounds<br/>\ngood and right to me.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Jason</div>",
