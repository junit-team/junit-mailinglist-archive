Some are running on Java background and some on .NET background.<br/>\nCorrespondingly unit test cases are written for both the cases.<br/>\nLet us say for Java applications unit tests are written in JUNIT.<br/>\nFor .NET applications unit tests are written in NUNIT.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe can also assume that these tests are configured in some build tool like ANT,Maven,NMaven etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy requirement is to integrate all these tests in a common framework(or a platform) and run them in a common environment which can be User Interface or a batch or a command.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nPlease let me know if am not clear with the requirement.</div>",
