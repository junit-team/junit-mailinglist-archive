It DOES find the DebugSupport. The problem is this: \nLinkage Error means that there is another class that DebugSupport is \nlinked to which it cannot find, because it is native IBM Java class.\n\nIf i didn&#39;t run &#39;com.ibm.uvm.tools.DebugSupport&#39; in the classpath, it \nwould simply give me &quot;ClassNotFound&quot; error. However, it throws a \nLinkager error: UnsatisfiedLinkError: no uvmtools in \njava.library.path.\n\nThanks,\n\nLily.\n\n\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, Jason Rogers &lt;jacaetevha@f...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; On Wed, 2003-06-18 at 17:52, ok_lilya wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve been stuck on this problem way too long - There must be \nsomekind \n&gt; &gt; of solution to it! Unless JUnit is designed specifically to avoid \n&gt; &gt; being run outside of VAJ. I&#39;m on the verge of giving up.\n&gt; \n&gt; You need &#39;com.ibm.uvm.tools.DebugSupport&#39; on your classpath.  When \nyou\n&gt; export your code make sure to export the jar with that class as \nwell. \n&gt; JUnit was not written to specifically run in VAJ.  So, that isn&#39;t \nthe\n&gt; problem!!  Look at the JavaDoc for LinkageError, it will give you a \nclue\n&gt; as to why it is thrown.  The JavaDoc probably would have been \nsufficient\n&gt; to let you know that it was a classpath issue.\n&gt; \n&gt; =jason\n\n\n",
