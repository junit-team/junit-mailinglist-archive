We use Mock objects, so that helps,...but we \n&gt; don&#39;t use them everywhere.  We also utilize &quot;TestAll&quot; tests, so that \n&gt; helps get you to a scope somewhere between one and all.\n\nIt takes 4 hours to run all your /programmer/ tests?! I daresay that is \na large problem and needs attention! I could understand all your \n/customer/ tests taking that long to run, but not your programmer tests.\n\n&gt; We don&#39;t run into this often,...but it does happen, and I have asked \n&gt; myself &quot;Isn&#39;t there an easier way to find all the tests that might be \n&gt; affected by my change?&quot;\n\nIf you don&#39;t run into this often, then it might be that the cost of \ntrying to do this more cleverly is higher than the cost of doing it the \nlong way. Don&#39;t forget to consider that possibility.\n-- \nJ. B.
