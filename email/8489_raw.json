I want to evaluate expressions which read my\n&gt; objects from the db to test my mappings.  If that doesnt blow up (and\n&gt; it does, a LOT, right now), I want to play around with that instance\n&gt; in an inspector, send messages to it, fix the toString(), test lazy\n&gt; instantiation of its parts, add some behavior, debug, etc, all in the\n&gt; context of a live instance. In short I want to _interact_ with the\n&gt; object.\n\nIf I get you right, you use JUnit (or tests written for JUnit) like you \ncould use any other code: to do something / create some state, display \nsome data. You do not assert something as for automated testing, right?\nIn fact you are debugging or developing, not testing or doing TDD?\n\nIn this case I&#39;d agree with JB: use JUnit if it helps getting your job \ndone. I can not (yet?) see what benefits JUnit could bring comapred to \nplain Java, though.\n\n&gt; However since I am going to the trouble to create this test code\n&gt; which produces those objects, I would like to institutionalize those\n&gt; snippets into a test suite so I and other team members can reuse them\n&gt; easily in the same manner. That&#39;s why I dont want the code in a\n&gt; scrapbook window. I&#39;m less interested in the automated test aspect\n&gt; right now.\n\nRight now means during development / debugging, right?\nLooks like you are playing around and getting familiar with Toplink?\n\n&gt; I mean I want to elevate my test artifacts from workspacewindow\n&gt; snippets to code which is managed by the version control system (Envy\n&gt; etc), available to team members, etc. And yes for automated testing\n&gt; eventually.\n\nMaybe you could turn those things you found out into automated test \ncases?\n\nRobert\n\n",
