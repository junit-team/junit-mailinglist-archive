The final goal would be to have the tool\ncomparing the class to the test_class and create stubs for new methods\nwhile leaving the existing ones untouched.\n\nBefore I&#39;m going to create it on my own, I wanted to know, if anybody knows\nabout an existing tool, that does the job?\n\nIf it does not exist, is there a good reason, why this automation wouldn&#39;t\nmake sense? Sometimes for complex function you may need several testcases,\nbut they can be easely created by taking the first stub and append a\nnumber...\n\n\n\n\n",
