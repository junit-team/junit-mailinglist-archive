(Page 153)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 1. The first two solutions I understand. But how can mock objects <br/>\n&gt; ease or bypass the problem of testing private methods?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Mock objects enable you to test a unit from the inside. This can make the<br/>\nneed to test private features vanish. Testing private features makes a test<br/>\nmore fragile, but so does the use of mock objects.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 2. I understand this to this point. But then he writes that the <br/>\n&gt; counting of branches is impossible if dynamic class loading is <br/>\n&gt; allowed. Why is it impossible then?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Because you don&#39;t know all implementors of a polymorphic method at compile<br/>\ntime. There can be any number of implementations unknown to the original<br/>\ndeveloper of the client class.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Another thing I don&#39;t understand is the a solution to the problem <br/>\n&gt; with the Square class which extends the Rectangle class.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The problem arises if a method &quot;stretchX(int factor)&quot; is added to <br/>\n&gt; the Rectangle class. Then you can override it in the Square class <br/>\n&gt; (so that Y is stretched too with the factor). But then a Square <br/>\n&gt; instance cannot be used everywhere where a Rectangle instance is can <br/>\n&gt; be used.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Right. This violates the LSP and thereby destroys the well-fromedness of the<br/>\nclass hierarchy.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; He has three solution for this: reversing the extends relationship, <br/>\n&gt; extracting a common super class and introducing a value semantics <br/>\n&gt; (&quot;Wertesemantik&quot;).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 3. How does a solution look like with value semantics? I&#39;m not sure <br/>\n&gt; if I translated the word correctly.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>&quot;Value semantics&quot; in this context means that any method which is supposed to<br/>\nchange the state of the object, eg. stretch the side of a rectangle, does<br/>\nnot change the original object but returns a new object which has a different<br/>\ninternal state than the original object. Transforming an object with changing<br/>\nstate into a value object (which is *identified* by its internal state) often<br/>\nrequires you to change method names. And sometimes it just does not make<br/>\nsense.<br/>\n<br/>\nJohannes<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n+++ GMX - Mail, Messaging & more  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.gmx.net\">http://www.gmx.net</a> +++<br/>\nBitte lächeln!
