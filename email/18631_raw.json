This assumes that there\n&gt; are no constraints on the output.  Lets jus=\r\nt say that\n&gt; the output is just an int\n&gt; c.\n&gt;\n&gt; Suppose c can only be 1 or =\r\n2.\n&gt;\n&gt; Well, that implies further constraints on the inputs,\n&gt; so we have t=\r\no go back and reconstrain.\n&gt;\n&gt; However in this example c can be anything, s=\r\no we just\n&gt; calculate the possible outputs.\n&gt;\n&gt; Then we run it through test=\r\ning.\n&gt;\n&gt; Now we could test\n&gt;\n&gt; a =3D 22\n&gt; a =3D 23\n&gt;\n&gt; etc.\n&gt;\n&gt; but that wo=\r\nuld be silly since we assume that\n&gt; since we passed values through our enum=\r\nerated branch\n&gt; list, that represent the beginning and end of the\n&gt; range o=\r\nf allowed values and even the points external\n&gt; to that range, we covered e=\r\nverything.\n&gt;\n&gt; So now I can look at my generated test code\n&gt; and see all th=\r\ne inputs, the expected outputs,\n&gt; and run the tests.\n&gt;\n&gt; I personally would=\r\n like this since it does a lot of\n&gt; the grunt work for me.\n&gt;\n&gt; It&#39;s possibl=\r\ne to have a method\n&gt; with a gazillion variables and paths...\n&gt;\n&gt; but I woul=\r\nd think that that would be a ripe case for\n&gt; refactoring, because it&#39;s tric=\r\nky to test :-)\n&gt;\n&gt; As a matter of fact...it would be nice to have\n&gt; somethi=\r\nng that enumerates the branches and generates a\n&gt; report on which methods h=\r\nas a number of branches over\n&gt; a certain limit...for code refactoring and m=\r\naintenance\n&gt; purposes.\n&gt;\n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; - Ole\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- C=C3(c)dric Be=\r\nust =E2=99&quot;  &lt;cbeust@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; On 1/3/07, Ole Ersoy &lt;ole_ers=\r\noy@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; We first have to agree on what 100% means.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I provided a very simple example in the earlier\n&gt; &gt; post.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The example gives a 100% tested tested method\n&gt; &gt; example,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; gi=\r\nven that the assumptions hold.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; This example can be entirely gen=\r\nerated using\n&gt; &gt; DataType\n&gt; &gt; &gt; meta data.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yes, but your exampl=\r\ne is too simple since it only\n&gt; &gt; contains one branch (most\n&gt; &gt; examples ex=\r\ntolling the virtues of code coverage have\n&gt; &gt; this flaw :-)).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 100% =\r\ncoverage means you should cover all the\n&gt; &gt; possible branches of your code,=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; which is impossible to achieve in practice.
