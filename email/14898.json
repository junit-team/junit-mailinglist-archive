There are those who seemingly are smart enough to subscribe<br/>\nto the mailing list, yet not wise enough to perform some simple search<br/>\nengine searching.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe best manner of dealing with them that I have seen, is to gently<br/>\nwelcome them to the world of JUnit, suggest that they start by reading<br/>\nthe resources available at junit.org and that they then follow that up<br/>\nwith reading one of the fine books available at their local or<br/>\nInternet book store. And it never hurts to mention ESR&#39;s Smart<br/>\nQuestions essay.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat does take a few minutes, but it&#39;s the nicest way to deal with<br/>\nthat sort of person that I&#39;ve seen. This list is very friendly and<br/>\nhelpful and populated by some fine people, so the last thing we want<br/>\nto do is to seem judgemental or rude. Products are judged by their<br/>\nmailing list. Think of Perl, a scripting language that is many orders<br/>\nof magnitude more difficult to learn than JUnit, but it&#39;s mailing<br/>\nlists are reputed for their friendliness. We should be the same way.<br/>\nStudy how J.B. and some of the others deal with the beginner/unwise<br/>\nquestions that come through the list.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and remember back to when you were confused and asking questions.<br/>\nI try to keep learning new things so I have no problem remembering<br/>\nback to a day when I didn&#39;t &quot;just know&quot; the answer. You should see<br/>\nsome of the stupid questions that I&#39;ve asked over at the Groovy<br/>\nmailing list! But they are very kind and patient over there. We<br/>\nare/should remain that way over here. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nSimon<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nwww.simonpeter.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 9/21/05, David Jackman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:david.jackman@...\">david.jackman@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Unfortunately, I think the people who send a question without looking in<br/>\n&gt; the FAQ or doing a simple Google search are also those people who would<br/>\n&gt; send the question to both the simple and advanced group in hopes of<br/>\n&gt; getting a faster response.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>] On Behalf Of<br/>\n&gt; Bradley, Todd<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, September 21, 2005 11:23 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: [junit] splitting this list<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi, I&#39;d like to propose a controversial topic, which is to somehow split<br/>\n&gt; up the JUnit email list into two lists - one for beginners and one for<br/>\n&gt; intermediate-to-advanced users.  I cherish the discussion on this list<br/>\n&gt; about meaty topics of unit testing and using and extending JUnit.  There<br/>\n&gt; are some very smart people here!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; However, I frankly have reached the limit of my tolerance for stupid<br/>\n&gt; questions in this list.  And by &quot;stupid questions&quot; I mean the opposite<br/>\n&gt; of Eric Raymond&#39;s &quot;smart questions&quot;<br/>\n&gt; (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html)\">http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html)</a>.  There seems to be<br/>\n&gt; no end to the steady stream of new members who sign on and immediately<br/>\n&gt; ask a question that&#39;s already answered in the JUnit FAQ, which every new<br/>\n&gt; member automatically receives.  I know hitting the delete key 5 or 10<br/>\n&gt; times a day isn&#39;t a huge deal, so I guess it&#39;s just the principle of it<br/>\n&gt; all.  I consider it rude for people to not have the courtesy to at least<br/>\n&gt; make an effort to help themselves.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But I thought that rather than just unsubscribing from the list, I&#39;d<br/>\n&gt; toss this message out to see if anyone else is in the same boat as me.<br/>\n&gt; There are supposedly over 6000 subscribers, which sure sounds like a big<br/>\n&gt; enough population to allow some specialization.  Alternatively, if<br/>\n&gt; dividing the <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a> list isn&#39;t likely to happen, does<br/>\n&gt; anyone know of a similar forum for &quot;intermediate-to-advanced&quot; users of<br/>\n&gt; JUnit with a better S/N ratio?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks for listening,<br/>\n&gt; Todd.<br/>\n&gt; ----<br/>\n&gt; Todd Bradley - Polycom, Inc.<br/>\n&gt; Test Lead, Proximo Projects </span></blockquote></div>",
