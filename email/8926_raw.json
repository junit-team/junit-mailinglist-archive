The smiley really doesn&#39;t change much.\n\nIlja, I was attempting to use sarcasm to make a point, and the wink was\nintended to convey that. I know e-mail is so tone flat, so maybe I shouldn&#39;t\nhave taken the risk, but I was not meaning to be rude. I apologize if that\nis how it came off.\n\nAlso -- if you interpreted this as &quot;junit isn&#39;t good&quot;, please don&#39;t. I was\nreplying to J.B saying if I had lots of core failures then I had other\nproblems, and I was saying --- don&#39;t folks w/ problems need good testing? I\nhope the words in the sentence I wrote didn&#39;t come off as &quot;junit is not\ngood&quot;.\n\nThat all said, please give me a break. I&#39;ve praised jUnit, I&#39;ve tolerated\njibes (so as not to start a flame war) and on the whole I&#39;ve tried very hard\nto be very level -- not try to score too many cheap points -- and keep a\nhealthy sense of humour, despite a lot of contentious comments.\n\n\tI also think that the whole xJunit\n\tcommunity has done very much for the better regarding unit testing - it\n\tdoesn&#39;t deserve such comments.\n\n\tBut perhaps I am overreacting because I strongly feel as part of the\n\tcommunity you attacked with above sentence. I also don&#39;t understand at\n\tall how it connects to J.B.&#39;s suggestion (which I think probably isn&#39;t\n\ttotally misguided). Would you like to elaborate?\n\nI didn&#39;t attack it at all. I think jUnit is awesome for helping me in the\nearly phase of rapid application development, and (once things grow) in the\nretaining of contract knowledge. I use it most when I am refactoring a lot,\nand when my code is breaking a lot. I was trying to make the point that that\nis exactly when folks need junit the most...\n\nAgain, please forgive me if my choice of words failed to convey the correct\npoint.\n\nregards,\n\nAdam\n\n\n",
