That&#39;s like making your tech support user friendly by outsourcing \nit to trained professionasl in India rather than letting your clients \ntalk directly to the developers. There&#39;s a ton of theory (i.e. \nrationalizations) to support doing that, and it&#39;s completely \ncounterproductive in practice.\n\nInterfaces are very popular among the most theoretical programmers: i.e. \nexactly the sort of programmers who are likely to write books, read \nbooks about OO theory, and hang out on lists like this one. However in \nmy experience concrete classes are much simpler and much preferred by \nthe vast majority of pragmatic programmers just getting their jobs done.\n\nI can certainly see how making a class test-friendly could make it less \ncaller-friendly. In fact, exactly how to do that is the subject of \nanother perma-thread on this list. exposing methods purely for the \nconvenience of testers expands a class&#39;s interface and makes it harder \nto learn, use, and understand. Minimal interfaces are simpler to \nunderstand and learn. Exposing additional methods purely for test \nconvenience is very counter-productive to caller-convenience. The only \npublic parts of a class&#39;s interface should be things that are relevant \nto client programmers.\n\n-- \n﻿Elliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nJava I/O 2nd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeaulait.org/books/javaio2/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596527500/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/\n\n",
