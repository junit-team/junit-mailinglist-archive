No tests exist.\nAs part of maintaining the app I&#39;ve been wanting to create JUnit test cases\nto document current behaviour prior to making changes. Unfortunately the\nDocumentum object model is so integral to practically everything that I\nhaven&#39;t been able to create tests for anything substantial.\n\nHas anyone had previous experience with testing this product?\n\nMichael Rutherfurd\n\n\n**************   IMPORTANT MESSAGE  **************\nThis e-mail message is intended only for the addressee(s) and contains information which may be confidential. \nIf you are not the intended recipient please advise the sender by return email, do not use or disclose the contents, and delete the message and any attachments from your system.
