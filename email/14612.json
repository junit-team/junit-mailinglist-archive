Even in Sun&#39;s libraries, there are public classes<br/>\n&gt;&gt; and methods in com.sun packages, which per convention aren&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;&gt; *published*. If you use them, you do so at your own peril.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; And guess what? People use them, even though they aren&#39;t supposed to.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And guess what? They might do so for good reasons, while being aware of the<br/>\nfact that what they do is rather fragile.<br/>\n<br/>\nI even access a private field in a thirdparty class once in a year, using<br/>\nreflection. I always do that because it&#39;s the best option available.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Hell, I even wrote a book whose primary focus<br/>\n&gt; was on documenting, explaining, and teaching people to use the sun<br/>\n&gt; classes! <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You hopefully warned them that they shouldn&#39;t blame Sun for not supporting<br/>\nthe API in the next version of the library.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If gentlemen&#39;s agreements were sufficient to enforce constraints on<br/>\n&gt; usage, we never would have had to invent access protection in the<br/>\n&gt; first place.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Guess what, Smalltakers live very well with &quot;private&quot; being not more than a<br/>\ncomment, for decades now.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; public == published in Java. I certainly wish it were<br/>\n&gt; otherwise, but sadly that&#39;s not the case.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>With your reasoning it seems to me that even private == published in Java,<br/>\nbecause private doesn&#39;t hold me from accessing a member, if I really want<br/>\nto. Might just be me, though.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers, Ilja</div>",
