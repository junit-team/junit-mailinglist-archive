Then seek the power of Ant.\n\nI&#39;ve only got one chance to=\r\n start off with good practices, and\nI&#39;d better get it right. But others hav=\r\ne pointed me toward tools\nfor doing this. \n * http://tinyurl.com/2uyb\n * so=\r\nme code from Craig Pardley\n * use of ant (but I tried this and couldn&#39;t mak=\r\ne it work)\n\n            . . .\n\n&gt; &gt;QUESTION 3:\n&gt; &gt;   How do I &quot;turn on&quot; my m=\r\nock objects when tests are running?\n&gt; When faced with testing a constellati=\r\non of objects that can&#39;t easily be \n&gt; &quot;installed&quot; with a mock object direct=\r\nly, I try to find ways to do so. \n&gt;  Sometimes it turns out those objects c=\r\nan be composed in a different \n&gt; order like Russian dolls.  If that doesn&#39;t=\r\n turn up anything, I&#39;ll resort \n&gt; to building a factory that plugs in imple=\r\nmentations based on a dynamic \n&gt; property.  I can count the number of times=\r\n I&#39;ve done that on one finger.\n\nInteresting. It seems to me like it&#39;d be a =\r\nmuch more common\nsolution than that. I&#39;ll go back and look at my designs ag=\r\nain\nand see if I can come up with a different approach that avoids\nthe need=\r\n for the &quot;dynamic property&quot;. Perhaps I&#39;m missing a\ngood solution.\n\n        =\r\n    . . .\n\n&gt; As you encounter specific issues not addressed in the FAQ, let=\r\n us know. \n&gt;  We&#39;ll make it better.\n\nWell, I have one suggestion. In respon=\r\nse to my question about \nwhere to place the tests, nearly everybody respond=\r\ned that a \nseparate source hierarchy was the best place (5 of 6 responders,=\r\n\nand the 6th proposed a new solution and said separate hierarchy\nwas his se=\r\ncond choice). I think that&#39;s sufficient agreement to\nmake this an acknowled=\r\nged &quot;best practice&quot;, and if you agree and\nwould like to add it to the FAQ, =\r\nI&#39;ll volunteer to write up an\nitem on it. Let me know.\n\n-- Michael Chermsid=\r\ne\n\n\n",
