Rainsberger [mailto:jbr@d...]\n&gt; &gt; ...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So the only thing you gain with the suggestion above is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; forcing the code to be aware of the Exception possibility of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; your code.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes: I submit that that is what tests are for. (If you&#39;re \n&gt; &gt; &gt; here, then you&#39;re writing tests, after all.)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Isn&#39;t documentation the thing that should be used to tell the\n&gt; &gt; writer of code that calls yours what your code is supposed to\n&gt; &gt; do, or what the caller is supposed to do (or not do)?  (At\n&gt; &gt; least for code meant to be re-used, such as that implementing\n&gt; &gt; an API?)\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes, it is. Please explain to me why unit tests are not \n&gt; documentation. :)\n\ni think with respect to checked exceptions your code has advertised,\nunit tests are not documentation about how to react to such\nexceptions.  if i&#39;ve understood the preceding discussion correctly,\nit is preferred in unit tests to let unexpected (read: not the\nsuccessful outcome of the test) exceptions, checked or unchecked,\npropagate out of the test method so the JUnit framework can signal\nthe test an error, preserving the stack trace of the thrown\nexception to facilitate diagnosis.  that&#39;s cool, they&#39;re tests.\n\nbut the intent of checked exceptions is to signal abnormalities from\nwhich, in the opinion of the designer, client code should be\nreasonably expected to recover.  from that perspective, the\n&quot;throws Exception&quot; policy of the unit tests illustrates only one\npossibility for handling the exceptions--that of letting your caller\ndeal with it.  as such, it is not the best documentation for showing\nhow to handle exceptions that emanate from the code-under-test.\nthe tests really can&#39;t make those decisions on behalf of specific\ncallers.  but, they do a marvelous job of describing and ensuring\nbehavior of the code-under-test.\n\ngreat discussion!  i haven&#39;t turned my back on checked exceptions,\nbut i&#39;m handling them in my tests much differently, in a way that\nhopefully will make refactoring in the presence of checked exceptions\nless painful.\n\ncheers,\np\n\nPaul Holser\n\n\n\n",
