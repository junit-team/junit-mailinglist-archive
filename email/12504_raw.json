I&#39;m willing to accept that it is a problem with me\nrather than JUnit.  Is there something about my outlook on testing that I need\nto refine?  I am surprised that data driven testing like this is not supported,\nas it seems like soemthign that would be used a lot.  What is the reasoning\nbehind JUnit not beign designed for this, and is there soemthign that I can do\nto acheive what I want while still keeping with JUnit&#39;s design goals.\n\n&gt; This is a different problem from the one you described before, so it&#39;s a \n&gt; different one from what I tried to help you solve.\n\nYes, that is why I tried to describe it better.  I really appreciate your taking\nthe time to understand what I am saying and help me.  I bought your book\nyesterday and I plan to read it over the holidays.\nAlright I will look into FitNesse like you suggested.  But I still feel like\nthere is either an issue with JUnit or my understanding of it since I failed to\nmake this work.\n\nThanks!! :)\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n\n\n",
