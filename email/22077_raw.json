So you pick some random class somewhere and you annotated it with th=\r\ne @RunWith(Suite.class), add the class to the suite with @...=\r\ns annotation, and then on that class define a @BeforeClass and an @AfterCla=\r\nss method. Those @BeforeClass and @AfterClass methods will get run before a=\r\nnd after all the other tests in the suite, respectively.\n\nWhat you don&#39;t ge=\r\nt from using this method is the nice convenient use of your IDE to just run=\r\n all the tests. You have to put them together yourself. Right now in JUnit =\r\nliterally by specifying them, although David has promised some idea for all=\r\nowing the Suite classes to be generated programatically.\n\nIn the mean time =\r\nif you need something generated programatically, you can make a custom runn=\r\ner that extends Suite and pass an array of the classes that you construct p=\r\nrogramatically to the Suite constructor.\n\nEven with this solution, you lose=\r\n the ability to have your IDE just find all tests in the project, but since=\r\n I need those tests run during the build anyway, that was not a loss for me=\r\n.\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;stolsvik&quot; &lt;online@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; Folks, thanks for your answers.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In junit@yahoogroups.com, David =\r\nSaff &lt;david@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Stolsvik,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; You can use @BeforeClass an=\r\nd @AfterClass on a suite to get this\n&gt; &gt; behavior, in many circumstances.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; Could you tell me directly, or point to some resource, of how I set tha=\r\nt up? Your sentence didn&#39;t immediately ring understanding with me.\n&gt; \n&gt; Bas=\r\nically, what I am requesting, is that I&#39;d like to annotate some random meth=\r\nod on some random class anywhere in the project with some annotation like @=\r\nAfterTestRun - so that when I run either one single test class, or a packag=\r\ne, or the entire project, with the Eclipse runner, this specific method wou=\r\nld be invoked after the requested test(s) are run.\n&gt; \n&gt; So: How do I accomp=\r\nlish that with &quot;@AfterClass on a suite&quot;?\n&gt; \n&gt; Do I have to annotate all my =\r\ntest classes with some specific Suite-annotation? That would be doable. How=\r\never, it would be just as awkward as I do with my logging init: Having to d=\r\no some boilerplate bs on every single test class - only that forgetting to =\r\ndo this would not give me any immediate indication, as with the logging ini=\r\nt; For the logging init, I immediately see if I have forgotten those three =\r\nboilerplate lines (&quot;static { TestHelper.setupLogging() }&quot;), because log4j s=\r\npews out some noise on Std.err if any part of the system starts to log on a=\r\nn uninitialized logging system.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;    David Saff\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; On Thu, =\r\nNov 19, 2009 at 7:09 AM, stolsvik &lt;online@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I need some way to=\r\n run a certain test after all other tests.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I run my tests in Ec=\r\nlipse, and do not yet have a build system outside of it. I understand that =\r\nhad I done this programmatically, I could have attached a RunListener, impl=\r\nementing the testRunFinished(Result) method.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Is there any way t=\r\no achieve a similar effect within the JUnit runner in Eclipse?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nRationale: I have actual unit tests, then bigger tests, then full-fledged &quot;=\r\nintegration tests&quot; or whatever one call them, where I take up my entire app=\r\nlication-local server thingy and process a bunch of items, letting JUnit ch=\r\neck after the dust settles whether the items was processed correctly. Howev=\r\ner, the internals are multi threaded, and also, this being a Swing app, lot=\r\ns of Runnables are sent over to the EDT. This is all good.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Howe=\r\nver, I&#39;ve sometimes seen that a thread crashes (uncaught exception), withou=\r\nt this being noticed by any of the tests running (I&#39;ve e.g. seen a Concurre=\r\nntModificationException take down the EDT, without having a clue as to why =\r\nI got that - and the next event posted just brings up a new EDT, so I get a=\r\n green bar, but with an uncaught error). What I&#39;d want to achieve, is to in=\r\nstall an uncaught exception handler, and then, as a final step to ALL permu=\r\ntations of tests (e.g. both for a single unit test, and also for the projec=\r\nt-wide test run), run a test that checks whether any thread-killing excepti=\r\non was caught by the handler, and if so, fails the run. (I&#39;d throw the exce=\r\nption that was caught, and in any case also log-dump any and all such excep=\r\ntions).\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (As a very similar question, I&#39;d also like to have a &quot;b=\r\nefore any tests&quot; thing, like the RunListener.testRunStarted(Description) me=\r\nthod, where I could set up logging. Now I do that by letting ALL tests have=\r\n a static block that calls a specific static method which has a static bool=\r\nean that tells whether the log system already is set up. This also works ju=\r\nst nicely, but is a hassle nevertheless. However, it is not possible, as I =\r\nsee it, to solve the above question in the same manner.)\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yahoo!
