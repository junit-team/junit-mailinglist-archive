Once something is in core JUnit, I try hard to guarantee that it is<br/>\nvery unlikely to change in breaking ways, and this big an idea, at this<br/>\nearly a stage, that degree of calcification is the last thing you want.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you find yourself tempted to make changes to core JUnit code in order to<br/>\nget the extension points that you need, please open pull requests for<br/>\nindividual changes.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck!<br/>\n<br/>\n   David<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Wed, Apr 24, 2013 at 2:16 AM, sourabh &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sourabh707@...\">sourabh707@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; **<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My team has recently started work on trying to extend Junit to support all<br/>\n&gt; inclusive annotation driven testing of a method in Java.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What I mean is that if we have a method<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; public int add(int a ,int b)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; then, instead of having to write a separate class for testing it, we would<br/>\n&gt; like to annotate the method as follows<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; @AutoTest<br/>\n&gt; @InputParams<br/>\n&gt; @AutoAssert<br/>\n&gt; public int add(int a,int b)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The responsibility of setting up junit to understand and execute this set<br/>\n&gt; of annotation would be delegated t our custom Runner.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The example above is quite basic as we plan to support testing for complex<br/>\n&gt; input objects that are seeded using an XML file.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We are in pretty advanced stages of completing this implementation. Please<br/>\n&gt; let me know how can we share our code for approvals/reviews with the Junit<br/>\n&gt; community.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks,<br/>\n&gt; SG<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>",
