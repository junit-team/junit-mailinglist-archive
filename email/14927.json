A lot <br/>\nof the JUnit test suites I see in practice, including some I&#39;ve written, <br/>\npush way too much into one method. I was just looking at one a couple of <br/>\ndays ago that had about two methods in the entire test suite, and these <br/>\ntwo methods tested everything. Adding specialized support for <br/>\nparameterized test cases like this will just make it easier and more <br/>\nconvenient for programmers to do the wrong thing. I&#39;m afraid this will <br/>\nbe just too tempting and be use far more often than it should be.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, it might mean more tests get written since it&#39;s a lot <br/>\neasier to add a line to an array of parameters than a whole new method. <br/>\nthat would be a good thing. But it definitely leads away from *unit* <br/>\ntesting. I think we&#39;ll see more functional and integration tests with <br/>\nthis and fewer unit tests (not that the lines between them aren&#39;t fuzzy <br/>\nalready) I&#39;m not sure whether the advantages outweigh the disadvantages <br/>\nor not.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n﻿Elliotte Rusty Harold  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:elharo@...\">elharo@...</a><br/>\nXML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/\">http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim\">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim</a></div>",
