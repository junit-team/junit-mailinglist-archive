I see it all the time. More specifically, I see people \n&gt; acting as though they do /not/ have permission to remove dead code. &quot;If \n&gt; it ain&#39;t broke, don&#39;t fix it&quot; and &quot;Don&#39;t touch it; it might break&quot;   \n\nIn the system I&#39;m currently working on over half the classes were obsolete,\nPOC or due to projects that hadn&#39;t gone &quot;live&quot;. Half the object model\nrelates to functions that the original lead worked on that were parked (the\nproject was descoped 2 years ago). The code has large blocks scattered\nthroughout that look like \n\n boolean projectXEnabled = false;\n\n if (projectXEnabled == true) {\n\t...\n\t...\n\t...\n }\n\nI have deleted more code (methods, classes, entire packages) in 18 months\nthan I have written in that time, and I&#39;ve rewritten most of the remaining\nlive functionality.\n\nThe original lead actively fought against using source control and automated\nbuilds (ant) which may explain some of it (no source control = can&#39;t delete\nit we might need it) but that just opens up the question about why was he\nemployed for so long and why is he now back in the company in another\ntechnical lead position?\n\nMichael Rutherfurd\n\n\n**************   IMPORTANT MESSAGE  **************\nThis e-mail message is intended only for the addressee(s) and contains information which may be confidential. \nIf you are not the intended recipient please advise the sender by return email, do not use or disclose the contents, and delete the message and any attachments from your system.
