If the \nsecond, it&#39;s very unlikely that Eclipse is to blame.  You might want to \ntake Eclipse and JUnit out of the picture by writing a small program \nwhose main procedure reads your input.in files and prints them out to \nthe console, or compares them to literal unicode strings.  If that \nprogram works as expected, then perhaps the gremlins are hiding in \nEclipse or JUnit--let us know.\n\n    David Saff\n\nspeedracer1548 wrote:\n\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ve been interested in using J-unit for globalization testing. I\n&gt; have used J-Unit before, but never in this way.  I want to use J-Unit\n&gt; to verify Japanese characters in resource bundles.  I am using Eclipse\n&gt; to run J-Unit.  I am also using input.in files to use as the &quot;Expected&quot;\n&gt; Data.  I correctly grab the &quot;Actual&quot; data as Eclispe shows me this,\n&gt; but the &quot;Expected&quot; data comes out corrupted.\n&gt;\n&gt; For those of you who know locale region settings, I am in Japanese in\n&gt; all of them and my input.in file correctly displays Japanese\n&gt; characters, the only problem I&#39;m facing is with J-Unit. See the\n&gt; attached screenshot for clarification. The SS shows the input file\n&gt; with &quot;Expected&quot; data, and also shows the character corruption from\n&gt; Eclipse.\n&gt;\n&gt; Is this problem related to J-Unit or Eclipse, or something else?\n&gt;\n&gt; http://img400.imageshack.us/img400/1391/junitcharcorruption1zf.jpg\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; YAHOO!
