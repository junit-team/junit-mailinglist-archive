I connect to a data provider via an IP address. They have<br/>\n&gt; provided an API which I implement, and get callbacks from them with<br/>\n&gt; the data. I can create a mock of one of their classes - but since<br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s not hooked up to their IP, there&#39;s no data in it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I suppose I could decompile their class and put some data in it - but<br/>\n&gt; at that point, am I really testing my interaction with their classes -<br/>\n&gt; or with one of my own munging?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks for any suggestions.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>About a year ago I had to get our application to work with another <br/>\napplication over JNI (they only had a C/C++ interface).   I did the <br/>\nfollowing:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. I wrote an interface that described how I wanted to access the remote <br/>\nAPI in terms of my<br/>\napplication (the Facade pattern)<br/>\n<br/>\n2. I wrote an implementation of that interface using fake data for <br/>\ntesting the rest of the system.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. I wrote tests of the real implementation against the real API (which <br/>\naccessed a local copy of the remote application). As the real API was <br/>\nnot always going to be available (licensing issues), these were <br/>\nseparated from the rest of the tests.  Some of these tests were also <br/>\n&quot;Learning tests&quot; to make certain I understood the remote API (and, in my <br/>\ncase, JNI, as this<br/>\nwas my first JNI project).<br/>\n<br/>\nI thus ended up with three kinds of tests:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Learning tests to make certain I understood the API (and also <br/>\nprotecting me from changes to the API).<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Tests of my real implementation of the interface against remote API.  <br/>\nThese tests were separated from the standard set of tests.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Tests of my application against a fake implementation.  These were <br/>\npart of the main set of tests.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope this helps,<br/>\n<br/>\nKathy Van Stone<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kvs@...\">kvs@...</a></div>",
