But I have a question which I hope some of you\n&gt; &gt; can help me with - it&#39;s regarding testing private/protected methods and how\n&gt; &gt; to organize my test package.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; First the package. I have read to articles regarding test (&quot;Junit best\n&gt; &gt; practices&quot; from JavaWorld and &quot;Incremental development with Ant and JUnit&quot;\n&gt; &gt; from developerWorks). In the JBT article Andy Schneider advice you to keep\n&gt; &gt; tests in the same location as the source code. And in the Incremental...\n&gt; &gt; article Malcolm Davis advice you to make a separate package. Which approach\n&gt; &gt; is the best to use?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;it is better to make separate package. when we can identify as two separate\n&gt;components like source code and test code it is better to keep them as two\n&gt;different components from configuration management point of view.\n\n\n\nOn the other hand...\nI have the test classes in the same package as the classes to test, and \nthen use delete/fileset/include in ant when packaging.\n\ne.g.:\n   &lt;target name=&quot;remove_tests&quot;&gt;\n     &lt;delete&gt;\n       &lt;fileset  dir=&quot;${build}&quot;&gt;\n         &lt;include name=&quot;**/*Test*.class&quot;/&gt;\n       &lt;/fileset&gt;\n     &lt;/delete&gt;\n   &lt;/target&gt;\n\nThis means I can test all but private methods.\n(Of course, if you have any classes that you want to keep that include \n&quot;Test&quot; in their names this won&#39;t work...)\n\n\nHTH,\nJim\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--\n\n                           *   Jim Cheesman   *\n             Trabajo: \njchees@... - (34)(91) 724 9200 x 2360\n         On one hand, I&#39;m \nindecisive, but on the other, I&#39;m not.\n\n\n\n",
