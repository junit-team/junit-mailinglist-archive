But then if we are accepting that testing\n&gt; public/friendly/protected methods adecuately test these methods, why not\ngo\n&gt; one step beyond and say that black box testing is all we need? It seems to\n&gt; me that testing private methods is as useful and valid as testing\n&gt; non-private ones, just at a different level of granularity.\n&gt;\nsnip\n\n    yes, you may test private methods. But that is not what actually is\nintended by unit testing. The idea is to write tests for the unit and\nthereby to specify what this unit is capable of. The idea of unit testing is\nnot testing per se. The cool thing is that you finish writing your unit,\nwhen your tests pass, which cuts down time in testing and implementation.\n\n    Later unit testing (the TestAll called when integrating) helps us\nfinding out misbehaving units after refactoring or other code changes.\n\n    I know that this aproach is not based on mathematical abductions but on\nexperience. Thus I don&#39;t want to make a religion out of it, but just do it\nas good habbit.\nAnd I don&#39;t believe that there is a proof, that testing is more and more\nefficiant, the more granular you test. Well, you could test every line of\ncode.\n\nToyin\n\n\n",
