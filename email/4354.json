My reasoning is public method types are what&#39;s exposed to the<br/>\npublic, therefore, test them well.  If the class is primary used via<br/>\ninheritance, I&#39;ll write test methods for the protected methods as well.<br/>\nOtherwise, I don&#39;t bother with private method types.  They&#39;re indirectly<br/>\ntested through the methods they support.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: J. B. Rainsberger [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jbr@...\">jbr@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, March 14, 2002 5:20 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [junit] Where to place test classes?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Another purpose for using JUnit is to create tests<br/>\n&gt;first and then write code.  For those that take this<br/>\n&gt;approach to development, they would probably want a<br/>\n&gt;test for each method.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m sorry to be blunt, but absolutely not.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn TFP, the goal is to test every feature -- that is, every bit of behavior <br/>\nyou care about. Implementation details are unimportant and, in fact, testing<br/>\n<br/>\nthem on their own often impedes refactoring. Since tests are meant to <br/>\nprovide the &quot;safety net&quot; during refactoring, they should try not to get in <br/>\nthe way of refactoring, if they can avoid it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have one feature that uses four or five private methods behind a <br/>\nsingle public method, then it&#39;s best simply to test the public method. If <br/>\nyou find a bug in there, then that may be a clue about your design: perhaps <br/>\nwhat you perceive as an implementation detail is something bigger that <br/>\nshould be in its own class. At that point, the method becomes public and <br/>\nvoila, you can test it. (Or package-level, if you prefer that route and <br/>\nplace your tests in the same package as the production code.)<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;A test for each method&quot; is a bad thing. &quot;Tests for each feature or service&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nis a Good Thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nJ.
