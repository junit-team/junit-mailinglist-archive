And you&#39;ll be told exactly how you screwed\nup, possibly with colourful asides. In public.\n\nWhen this happens, the worst thing you can do is whine\nabout the experience, claim to have been verbally\nassaulted, demand apologies, scream, hold your breath,\nthreaten lawsuits, complain to people&#39;s employers,\nleave the toilet seat up, etc. Instead, here&#39;s what\nyou do:\n\n\nMan - No wonder I never get any answers - Should have\nlistened to my wife and put the toilet seat down while\nbreathing normally without making sound.\n\n\n\n--- Simon Chappell &lt;simonpeterchappell@...&gt;\nwrote:\n\n&gt; On 9/2/06, vkv3056 &lt;vkv3056@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Thanks for your response. But you could have\n&gt; safely assumed that\n&gt; &gt; anyone asking for use of Junit for web services\n&gt; would necessarily\n&gt; &gt; have common sense of using any of the major search\n&gt; engines. Instead\n&gt; &gt; of sermons on helping me exercise search engine\n&gt; skills, some\n&gt; &gt; concrete info would have been more useful (for\n&gt; example, look at\n&gt; &gt; other responses on this topic).\n&gt; \n&gt; Oh, you&#39;ve gotta love this. Someone who dumps a\n&gt; quick &quot;please give me\n&gt; info about testing web services&quot; email, is now\n&gt; taking me to task about\n&gt; not making dramatically unlikely assumptions about\n&gt; their level of\n&gt; knowledge.\n&gt; \n&gt; The vast majority of emails that come through this\n&gt; list of the type\n&gt; &quot;pls u snd me junit info thnx&quot; are from folks who\n&gt; have not used a\n&gt; search engine and who are lazy beyond belief. These\n&gt; folks are welcome\n&gt; to receive help when they start following the advice\n&gt; in ESR&#39;s &quot;asking\n&gt; smart questions&quot;. For the record, I also suggest\n&gt; that you read it. You\n&gt; gave no indication that you had ever touched a\n&gt; search engine. You gave\n&gt; no indication that you knew anything about web\n&gt; services beyond the\n&gt; correct spelling of the words. Here&#39;s the link (see,\n&gt; I can be\n&gt; helpful):\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html\n&gt; \n&gt; I also noticed quite a large number of useful\n&gt; looking links when I\n&gt; googled for &quot;testing web services junit&quot;. If I could\n&gt; find them, I have\n&gt; no idea why you couldn&#39;t.\n&gt; \n&gt; Simon\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; www.simonpeter.org\n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
