The common approach seems to be to \n    &gt; gather\n    &gt; &gt; all the tests for a given class in one test class.  \n    &gt; What about the\n    &gt; &gt; scenario type of tests?  Organized by use case?  What \n    &gt; communicates\n    &gt; &gt; better, especially if we want to use the tests as documentation?\n    &gt; &gt; \n    &gt; \n    &gt; Usually I organize functional tests by subsystem/useCase.\n    &gt; \n    &gt; Regards,\n    &gt; \n    &gt; David\nI think the organization depends on your browsing capabilities (i.e. using\nan IDE or not, what IDE you are using, etc.) mainly because if it isn&#39;t too\ncumbersome to break the tests out of production code locations, go ahead and\ndo it.  I use VAJ for all of my Java development (at home and at work).\nBecause of VAJ&#39;s extremely easy-to-use browser, I never mix tests with\nproduction code.\n\nIf I have com.foobar.parsers.xyz I would have a unit test package that maps\none-to-one: com.foobar.parsers.xyz.tests.  If there are functional tests to\ngo with these classes they would be in\ncom.foobar.parsers.xyz.functionaltests.\n\nWe have actually split things up a little more where I work for the sake off\ntime-to-run-tests.  If there are tests that are functional in nature but\ntake more than 50 - 60 seconds to run we put them in\ncom.foobar.parsers.xyz.quickfunctionaltests whereas the longer (most likely\nfull system) tests would be in the aforementioned\ncom.foobar.parsers.xyz.functionaltests.\n\n-Jason\n\n\n",
