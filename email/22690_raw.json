It wasn&#39;t=\r\n until I\n&gt; got my first job that I even heard of the concept.\n&gt;\n&gt; Similarly=\r\n (and bringing this a little more back on topic) none of my\n&gt; university cl=\r\nasses covered unit testing, either. But that was long before\n&gt; TDD and the =\r\nwhole &quot;test infected&quot; thing.\n&gt;\n&gt; As far as I know, none of my university pr=\r\nofessors (both undergrad and\n&gt; graduate) had any clue about version control=\r\n or unit testing, especially\n&gt; automated unit testing. I just always chalke=\r\nd that up to them having a\n&gt; completely academic background, with no real w=\r\norld professional software\n&gt; engineering experience. An important part of t=\r\nhe first 5 years of my career\n&gt; was understanding the difference between ho=\r\nw professors wanted things done\n&gt; and how things are done in the industry. =\r\nNobody told me in college that they\n&gt; would be such different worlds.\n&gt;\n&gt; C=\r\nheers,\n&gt; Todd.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: junit@yahoogroups.c=\r\nom &lt;junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt; [mailto:\n&gt; junit@yahoogroups.com &lt;junit%40yaho=\r\nogroups.com&gt;] On Behalf Of Steve\n&gt; Freeman\n&gt; Sent: Saturday, May 08, 2010 4=\r\n:03 AM\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com &lt;junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Subject: Re:=\r\n [junit] When it matters most, don&#39;t forget your tests.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ve been doing=\r\n some teaching at a major university department for 4th\n&gt; years and MSc stu=\r\ndents. The first year I taught the course, I had to back up\n&gt; and do a sess=\r\nion on version control. A significant number of the students\n&gt; (including s=\r\nome who had worked in industry) had never seen it. The fact that\n&gt; one can =\r\nget through a CS degree too without using version control is less\n&gt; surpris=\r\ning, but still disappointing.\n&gt;\n&gt; S.\n&gt;\n&gt; On 6 May 2010, at 19:59, Loritsch,=\r\n Berin C. wrote:\n&gt; &gt; I know this opens up a huge can of worms, but it is am=\r\nazing to me what\n&gt; &gt; should be standard engineering practices are neither p=\r\nracticed nor\n&gt; &gt; understood.
