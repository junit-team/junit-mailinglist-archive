I go =\r\nto the database where the URLs are stored and then open a\nURL connection an=\r\nd ping the service. \n\nI iterate through the URLs, and collect the results. =\r\nI want to be able\nto display a message for all the URLs that fail. But I ca=\r\nnnot see how\nto do that.\n\nThis test only does on thing, so I don&#39;t think th=\r\nis is a case where I\nneed to break up the test. Also I don&#39;t want to have t=\r\no be aware of\nwhat URLs fail before hand by checking specific URLs with ass=\r\nertEquals.\n\nIs there a way I can display multiple errors or failures, in Ju=\r\nnit?\nI have read the FAQ about the logic for not being able to display\nmult=\r\niple results, but I don&#39;t feel like the argument is applicable here.\n\nIf th=\r\nere is a previous response, please fowared the message id, when\nsearched I =\r\nkept getting &#39;search timed out, only partial results&#39;.\n\nThanks, Karen\n\n\n\n\n\n=\r\n\n\n",
