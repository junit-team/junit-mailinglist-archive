If you can demonstrate more than a single percentage\npoint of difference in performance please post the results and I will\neat my proverbial hat.\n\nIf there is a relationship between size of code and performance, it is\nthat complex code has more interactions so feels slower than small\nsimple code. It&#39;s nothing to do with the size of the identifiers!\n\nThe point that lots of people are making here is plain: Well factored,\nmeaningfully written code is vastly superior to badly written,\nsprawling cryptic code. \n\nThis is true even for performance critical code. If there are\nbottlenecks revealed by your profiler, having well factored meaningful\ncode will allow you to do something about them. Badly maintained and\npurposely obfuscated code will discourage you from even trying, in case\nyou break something you don&#39;t understand.\n\n\n\nOn Wed, 2003-09-24 at 02:38, Jason Rogers wrote:\n&gt; On Tue, 23 Sep 2003 19:30:13 -0000, &quot;ssmith12345uk&quot; &lt;shauns@...&gt;\n&gt; said:\n&gt; &gt; I must confess, I am definitely one of the &#39;comment extremely \n&gt; &gt; sparsely&#39; crowd.  What might be interesting is if we perhaps wrote a \n&gt; &gt; Ruby program to process a Java source tree, replacing the symbols \n&gt; &gt; with the smallest identifiers possible, unless they are tagged with \n&gt; &gt; a @published tag for external compatibility reasons.  I would expect \n&gt; &gt; to be able to produce a readable and maintainable program to do this \n&gt; &gt; with very few comments indeed.  I also expect to be able to write a \n&gt; &gt; program to convert a stack trace back to the original symbols, again \n&gt; &gt; with very few comments.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Do you think that might be a worthwhile or interesting exercise?\n&gt; \n&gt; I, for one, would be very interested in this.\n&gt; \n&gt; --\n&gt; =jason\n&gt; [:question | ^One]\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
