I&#39;ve used both techniques successfully.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy default, I try to keep the assertion methods local to the tests using the<br/>\nassertions.  If I have a test case testing a Money object, for example, then I&#39;ll put<br/>\nthe money-related assertions in that test case.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I have several test cases all focused on making assertions on Money objects, then<br/>\nI&#39;ll pull the method up into a common money-related test case.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf there are test cases that aren&#39;t specifically money related, but they need to make<br/>\nassertions on Money objects for some reason, then I&#39;ll extract the money-related<br/>\nassertions into a MoneyAssertion utility class.  This rarely happens, but when I does<br/>\nit makes me think through whether it&#39;s a good thing to have money-related tests<br/>\nsprinkled far and wide.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; At first glance it seems that making a new specialized TestCase (i.e.-<br/>\n&gt; inheritance) to contain the custom assertion methods would be the quickest way<br/>\n&gt; to add these on. Just push them up into a new base class.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; However, the specialized Assert class (i.e.-delegation) appears to be more<br/>\n&gt; flexible and easier to change in the future. It also seems to better communicate<br/>\n&gt; the purpose of the new class.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; In other words, if I went with the new TestCase extension route, I&#39;m not sure<br/>\n&gt; whether I&#39;ll remember 6 months down the road that I created the new TestCase<br/>\n&gt; class to hold the custom assertions. Where as making calls to an specialized<br/>\n&gt; Assert class route would likely to be more understandable.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Perhaps, if you remembered that the specialized Assert class existed.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; What are your thoughts on the matter of simplicity and readability vs. ease of<br/>\n&gt; initial implementation with regards to these choices? I&#39;m trying to stick to the<br/>\n&gt; Extreme Programming way of doing things.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Do what&#39;s simplest for you today, then refactor it later if you change your mind.<br/>\nTest code can begin to smell just as production code sometimes does.  Refactoring is<br/>\nthe cure.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nMike Clark<br/>\nClarkware Consulting, Inc.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.clarkware.com\">http://www.clarkware.com</a><br/>\n720.851.2014</div>",
