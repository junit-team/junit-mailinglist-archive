I&#39;ve used it a bit in IBM VAJ, and <br/>\nreally like it so far, but it would be great if I could interact with <br/>\nother users of this software, since alot of aspects of usage are <br/>\nstill pretty unclear.  But I cannot seem to find link or button in <br/>\nthe SourceForge page for posting to the list from the list archive <br/>\npage, even though the preceeding page clearly says &#39;Choose a list to <br/>\nbrowse, search, and post messages&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI realize I may very well be missing something very simple that when <br/>\nexplained to me will make me feel quite dumb.  On the other hand, I <br/>\ndon&#39;t see very many postings in that public user list, so perhaps <br/>\nsomething there is broken?<br/>\n<br/>\nIs anyone else having similar frustrations, or is it just me?  The <br/>\nEasyMock alternative, I think, requires jdk 1.3, which IBM VAJ does <br/>\nnot yet support, so I was hoping to bank on the MockObjects framework <br/>\nto provide much needed help in building my unit-tests.</div>",
