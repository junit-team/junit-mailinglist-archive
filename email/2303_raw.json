Basically, I load each version up using my own class \nloader, and then compare them to eachother.  However, the way that I \ndesigned the program was that all the errors were stored, and then \njust printed out by the user however he wanted.  I wrote the code \nmyself (both the toolkit code and the junit code).  I have tried \nmaking my (BC) code more test worthy, as suggested earlier in this \nforum, such as instead of printing the results, I have a getList \nmethod so I can compare the list to a hardcoded list, however, this \ndoes not seem to fit in with the mentality of unit test writing.  Is \nthat a better picture of what I am trying to do?  I have a unit test \nrunning now, but I just feel that my design is very sloppy and \namateurish.\n\nThanks!\n\n--- In junit@y..., Shane Duan &lt;sduan@b...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; If you can provide more information, I might have a better answer.\n&gt; \n&gt; What kind of &#39;certain type of compatibility&#39; are you referring to?\n&gt; \n&gt; &#39;my code&#39; mentioned in your earlier post is referring to your unit \ntesting code\n&gt; is that correct?\n&gt; \n&gt; As to your question of add, I suspect that what you have learned in \nschool is\n&gt; in procedure language instead of object oriented language.  So if \nyou have two\n&gt; variable &#39;a&#39; and &#39;b&#39;, in procedure language it is &#39;add(a, b)&#39;, \nwhile in object\n&gt; oriented language it is &#39;a.add(b)&#39;.  In fact, I think in the early \ndays of C++\n&gt; the compile just convert a.add(b) to add(a, b).\n&gt; \n&gt; Hope that is clear.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Jason Rogers wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; He said he was the author of the code, so I don&#39;t think that will \nwork.\n&gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; &gt; From: Keith Ray [mailto:keith.ray@e...]\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Tuesday, August 07, 2001 1:27 PM\n&gt; &gt; To: &#39;junit@y...&#39;\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [junit] re - novice QA\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;I am invading your group as a mere QA intern. . .  I am supposed \nto\n&gt; &gt; &gt;implement JUnit tests on code that I have just written. However, \nwhat\n&gt; &gt; &gt;I have learned in school does not seem to apply here!  We learned\n&gt; &gt; &gt;that if the method is an &quot;add&quot; method, give it two numbers,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;and &quot;assert&quot; that the correct addition is performed, and so \non. . .\n&gt; &gt; &gt;well, I have no clue what to assert!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Quick rundown of what I am testing:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Basically, my code is using the Reflection class to check all the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;members of a class for a certain type of compatibility.  Most \nmethods\n&gt; &gt; &gt;add errors to an error vector, and then there is a simple print\n&gt; &gt; &gt;function to print out the vector... How on earth do I test this\n&gt; &gt; &gt;class??\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Thanks for any help in advance!!\n&gt; &gt; You should pair-program with the writer of this code to refactor \nit to be\n&gt; &gt; more testable. Search the web for &quot;test-first-design&quot;, &quot;test-\nfirst-coding&quot;,\n&gt; &gt; &quot;refactoring&quot;, etc... search Ward&#39;s Wiki as well:\n&gt; &gt; &lt;http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?FindPage&gt;.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; &gt; junit-unsubscribe@y...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
