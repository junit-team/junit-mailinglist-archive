Currently I am able to do this <br/>\nthru an embedded Tomcat server on the Linux box, and the test seems <br/>\nto work well. I need to have the test class located on both boxes, <br/>\nalthough it seems the test class on the Windows box is merely for <br/>\nreference and the code inside the test methods is only implemented <br/>\non the Linux side. What I&#39;d like to do is run different code on the <br/>\nWindows side, so that once the Linux side&#39;s code has been run the <br/>\nWindows&#39; side code can verify the results. Does anyone have any <br/>\nsuggestions?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nPaul</div>",
