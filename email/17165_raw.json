I&#39;v=\r\ne taken the time to document the setup and I&#39;m now \nworking on the analysis=\r\n.\n\nI&#39;d appreciate any feedback you might want to offer:\n\nhttp://schuchert.w=\r\nikispaces.com/Car+Rental+Code+Coverage+with+Emma\n\nThanks!\n\nBrett\nTutorials =\r\nand Articles\n     http://schuchert.wikispaces.com/\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroup=\r\ns.com, &quot;Brett L. Schuchert&quot; &lt;schuchert@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://schuchert.wi=\r\nkispaces.com/Car+Rental+Example\n&gt;  \n&gt; This is an example I plan to get a lo=\r\nt of mileage out of. It \ncontains 100 unit tests written for Dao&#39;s (all in =\r\nmemory right now), \nComponents that perform simple validation and Business =\r\nObjects that \ndo NOT follow the transfer object (anti) pattern. (When I got=\r\n to \naround 95 tests naturally, I went around looking for 5 more to add).\n&gt;=\r\n  \n&gt; You can just download the file and have a look at the &quot;test&quot; \ndirector=\r\ny under the CarRental project. Alternatively, you can follow \nall of the in=\r\nstructions and get them to run.\n&gt;  \n&gt; This example has several things embed=\r\nded in it, including:\n&gt; - A simple use of Spring\n&gt; - An aspect that outputs=\r\n the time each unit test takes to run \n(mentioned earlier on this list)\n&gt; -=\r\n Yet another simple wrapper around Log4J that actually adds value \nby using=\r\n variable arguments\n&gt; - Several examples of the use of Generics (both types=\r\n and methods)\n&gt; - What something looks like after using both PMD and Checks=\r\ntyle\n&gt; - JUnit, of course (not TestNG - just to presempt C=C3=A9dric&#39;s \nque=\r\nstion about whether I&#39;ve looked at TestNG (I have))\n&gt;  \n&gt; I plan to extend =\r\nthis example over the next several months (as time \npermits). On my TO DO l=\r\nist (not necessarily in priority order):\n&gt; - Introduce Hibernate (replace a=\r\nll of the in-memory Dao&#39;s with \nhibernate)\n&gt; - Rewrite (by hand) every test=\r\n using TestNG (for experience - I \ndon&#39;t want to just convert them so I can=\r\n learn TestNG from the ground \nup - and I figure after writing that many te=\r\nsts I&#39;ll have enough \nexperience to intelligently speak about both JUnit an=\r\nd TestNG)\n&gt; - I&#39;ll add some kind of front end, have not yet decided.\n&gt; - Pl=\r\nan out more possible Aspect assignments to be applied to this \nexample (tha=\r\nt&#39;s the original impetus for this work - part 2 of a 3-\npart class on AOP a=\r\nnd AspectJ)\n&gt;  \n&gt; Comments welcome.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Oh, if you do follow all of the i=\r\nnstructions and you install \neverything under the same directory, it will t=\r\nake up roughly 312 MB \n(+ some for the block size used by your hard drive).=\r\n\n&gt;  \n&gt; FYI, the last time I checked, the ratio of the &quot;source&quot; code to \nthe=\r\n &quot;test&quot; code was 3:2. That is, around 1500 non-comment source \nstatements f=\r\nor the src directory and about 1000 non-comment source \nstatements for the =\r\ntest directory. Are your results similar?\n&gt;  \n&gt; Brett\n&gt;  \n&gt; Tutorials and A=\r\nrticles\n&gt;      http://schuchert.wikispaces.com/\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original M=\r\nessage ----\n&gt; From: clgonsal &lt;clgonsal@...&gt;\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; S=\r\nent: Monday, July 17, 2006 6:08:15 PM\n&gt; Subject: [junit] setUp versus const=\r\nructors\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve been using JUnit for a few years now, and one thing th=\r\nat&#39;s \nalways\n&gt; bothered me is the &quot;setUp&quot; method.\n&gt; \n&gt; I always do my initi=\r\nalization in my constructor (if I&#39;m not just \ndoing\n&gt; it at the field defin=\r\nition) as constructors allow me to initialize\n&gt; final fields. The semantics=\r\n of using a constructor also seem far \nmore\n&gt; obvious to me as everyone rea=\r\nding my code knows Java, while not\n&gt; everyone is a JUnit guru.\n&gt; \n&gt; The add=\r\nitional complexity of having the (as far as I can tell)\n&gt; redundant setUp m=\r\nethod seems counterproductive, so why does setUp \nexist?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; [No=\r\nn-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
