We wrapped it. Yes, we had system tests, but in order to test<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; our logic independently, we pretty much had to wrap it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t want the tests to be independent of the libraries they depend<br/>\n&gt; on. I want them to depend on exactly what the code depends on: no more;<br/>\n&gt; no less. That way you find bugs in the boundaries between model classes<br/>\n&gt; and libraries as well as in the model classes and libraries themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You seem to think that&#39;s (1) the only way to do it and (2) the best way <br/>\nto do it. I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s always true, which is why I use contract <br/>\ntests and interaction tests to perform the same task you perform by <br/>\ntesting against the real thing. I do what I do because of the <br/>\nimprovements in my design; you what do you do (I presume) because it&#39;s <br/>\ncloser to how the thing will be used and you don&#39;t mind the extra cost <br/>\nof testing against the real thing. It would be interesting to get to the <br/>\nbottom of why so many of us feel testing against the real thing is too <br/>\nexpensive and why so many of you feel testing against the real thing is <br/>\nworth the cost.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  &gt; The fact is, testing is a legitmate need. Designing for testability is<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; simply good engineering.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The tail is wagging the dog. Testing is done to support the project. It<br/>\n&gt; is not the project, and it should not control the project.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I find this interesting, considering that many projects do not ship <br/>\nuntil their testing phase is complete /or/ feel bad that they ship <br/>\nbefore their testing phase is complete. Many projects that do ship <br/>\nbefore their testing phase is complete end up shipping shit.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems testing is more than something that supports the project.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;ll keep an eye out for such a case in the future, but I don;t recall<br/>\n&gt; ever noticing one. I do recall numerous examples where I had trouble<br/>\n&gt; testing code that wasn&#39;t intended to be used as a library in the first<br/>\n&gt; place. However in all cases I can think of the problems that prevented<br/>\n&gt; testing also prevented library usage. The problems were in no way unique<br/>\n&gt; to testability, nor did you have to resort to testability to justify<br/>\n&gt; fixing the problems,<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>So this is one point of commonality: we say &quot;Testable designs tend to be <br/>\ngood designs&quot;; you say &quot;Difficult-to-test libraries tend to be <br/>\ndifficult-to-use libraries&quot;. Those sound pretty equivalent to me.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
