In my experience, there have been a lot of times when functions und=\r\ner test within the same class depend upon each other, and it would have bee=\r\nn great to have the test harness know that information.  When I was refacto=\r\nring code for a new framework package, I would have loved to have the UI to=\r\n display non-dependent tests first as it would have shown me very clearly t=\r\nhe source of the problem.\n\nSpecifying only the relationships in code and le=\r\naving the display strategy to the test harness would allow more flexible di=\r\nsplay and execution of these tests based upon the user&#39;s goals rather than =\r\nupon the dependencies themselves.  I could imagine myself asking the UI onl=\r\ny to display the least dependent functions&#39; errors and to hide all other er=\r\nrors for quick debugging on sweeping optimizations.  I could also want to s=\r\nee the dependent tests in a tree in case I am changing a single class and w=\r\nant to understand the effects of what I am touching.  I could also want to =\r\nsee all tests in a single list with the least dependent at the top and the =\r\nmost dependent on the bottom when running regression tests.  As you can see=\r\n, the chosen view depends more upon what I am doing than upon the test depe=\r\nndencies themselves.\n\nFinally, being able to list dependencies between test=\r\n classes in addition to test cases would also JUnit to report which compone=\r\nnts of the system depend upon each other.  This simple extension would grea=\r\ntly increase the power of the dependency models for larger systems (particu=\r\nlarly regression tests).\n\nThank you,\n\nRocco\n\nFrom: junit@yahoogroups.com [m=\r\nailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of Charlie Poole\nSent: Thursday, Dec=\r\nember 24, 2009 12:09 AM\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: RE: [junit] Orde=\r\nr of execution for tests\n\n\n\nHi C=E9dric,\n\n&gt; &gt; On another list, I identified=\r\n the same variations of dependency but\n&gt; &gt; with the variation that for case=\r\n 1. We might run B anyway but could\n&gt; &gt; highlight the error in A in some wa=\r\ny. That approach doesn&#39;t require\n&gt; &gt; ordering the tests in any particular w=\r\nay, which has some advantages.\n&gt; &gt; It still promotes developer efficiency w=\r\nhile not worrying about\n&gt; &gt; execution efficiency.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yes, we call thes=\r\ne &quot;soft dependencies&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; If &quot;b&quot; has a hard dependency on &quot;a&quot; and &quot;a&quot; fail=\r\ns, &quot;a&quot; will\n&gt; be marked &quot;FAILED&quot; and b &quot;SKIPPED&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; If &quot;b&quot; has a soft dep=\r\nendency on &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot; will still run even\n&gt; if &quot;a&quot; fails but a warning could =\r\nbe displayed in the log.\n\nThis is an implementation-based view of the tests=\r\n: i.e. they\nwill either be run or not run.\n\nThe distinction I was trying to=\r\n make - and I think David as\nwell - is based on the cause and nature of the=\r\n dependency.\nFor the sake of argument, I&#39;ll try to redefine what you&#39;re\ncal=\r\nling Hard and Soft along those lines.\n\nHard: Test A does something (sets st=\r\nate) upon which B depends.\nFor example, A may write to a data store and B m=\r\night try to\nread the information back. Or A might create a complex object\na=\r\nnd B might try to call a method on that object. If we allow\nthis sort of th=\r\ning, then there is no choice but to run A first\nand it makes sense to not r=\r\nun B at all if A fails. However,\nI would not want a unit test framework to =\r\nallow it.\n\nSoft: Test A tests some functionality upon which some other\nfunc=\r\ntionality, tested by B, depends. Therefore, if test A\nfails, Test B will ei=\r\nther fail as well or be inconclusive,\nso nothing further can be learned fro=\r\nm test B. In this case,\na testing framework could respond in a number of wa=\r\nys to\nthe dependency:\n1) Run the tests in order, skipping B if A fails.\n2) =\r\nRun the tests in an arbitrary order, but skip B if A\nalready ran and failed=\r\n.\n3) Run the tests in an arbitrary order, not skipping any\nof them but orga=\r\nnize reporting in such a way that a failure\nof A takes precedence over a fa=\r\nilure of B.\n\nAs a framework author, I can see that allowing the user to\nspe=\r\ncify ordering is a simpler implementation. But I think\nit&#39;s more interestin=\r\ng to imagine the user specifying the\nnature of the dependencies and allowin=\r\ng the framework to\nfigure out a strategy.\n\nCharlie\n\n&gt; Every time we have di=\r\nscussed this potential feature for\n&gt; TestNG, the discussion ended up being =\r\nnon conclusive on the\n&gt; real interest and the existing ability to mark cert=\r\nain\n&gt; methods as &quot;alwaysRun&quot; already fills a big part of this\n&gt; scenario, s=\r\no I always ended up punting on it, but I&#39;d be\n&gt; happy to hear if someone ca=\r\nn come up with a good use case for\n&gt; soft dependencies...\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt; ***C=E9d=\r\nric\n&gt; *\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
