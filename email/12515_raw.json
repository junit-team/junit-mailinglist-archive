It was pretty clear to me.\n\n&gt; Rather than deem Junit insufficient, my first thought was that I was missing\n&gt; something.  This stance was taken out of respect for �all the very smart \n&gt; people\n&gt; who&#39;ve been working with JUnit since 1999.�  The reason that I asked on this\n&gt; forum is to �take some stock in what someone with experience has to say.�\n&gt; I was expecting some explanation of why this type of testing was not \n&gt; supported.\n\nOK. Did you get the explanation you wanted? Sometimes the explanation \ntakes pages and pages, and I don&#39;t have the energy to write that out \nevery time someone asks.\n\n&gt; Maybe that there were better paradigms that Junit preferred.  I was simply\n&gt; trying to best understand a piece of software before moving on.\n&gt; I guess I&#39;m confused about your need to be condescending, especially \n&gt; since my\n&gt; motivations to respect previous work, listen to experience, and recognize\n&gt; software limitations seem to line up pretty nicely with your views.\n&gt; Thanks for you time, I guess I&#39;ll have to wait until you explain the \n&gt; solutions\n&gt; that you alluded to.\n\nI apologize for my tone. I was tired, and it seemed like you were asking \nfor our advice, then disregarding it anyway. You can understand how that \nmight be enervating.\n-- \nJ. B.
