B. is saying, I strongly recommend you keep to<br/>\nthe following rule: Each test should correspond to testing one thing in<br/>\none configuration state.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have 10 tests, and 4 different configurations you want to run<br/>\nthem in, that&#39;s (4 x 10 =) 40 tests in total. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn JUnit, you don&#39;t have to write 40 test methods. You can get away<br/>\nwith 10, and run them in different suites. You can name the suites<br/>\nwhatever you like, but I recommend you name them so you can tell which<br/>\ntests correspond to which configuration. <br/>\n<br/>\n(btw. Now it looks like you&#39;ve got 40 tests instead of 10, your fellow<br/>\nprogrammers will be very impressed by your productivity next time they<br/>\nrun the test suite! ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not cheating. You&#39;ve got 40 tests, each testing something unique.<br/>\nThe important thing is to avoid situations where you have to explain<br/>\n&quot;these tests pass if you run them this way, but four of them fail you<br/>\nrun them that way&quot;. That&#39;s brings in complexity you just don&#39;t want in<br/>\nyour test suite.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Sat, 2003-09-27 at 18:57, J. B.

I find the second problem to be <br/>\n&gt; worth fixing, but others do not.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I think it&#39;s a good first step, but it will annoy you pretty quickly. <br/>\n&gt; Try it and see.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Good luck.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nMalcolm Sparks<br/>\nCongreve Computing<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.congreve.com\">http://www.congreve.com</a> </span></blockquote></div>",
