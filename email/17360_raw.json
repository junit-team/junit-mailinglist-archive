Its core is an object, say APP, static reference of which\n&gt; is kept in the main class (much like in singleton, but the\n&gt; constructor&#39;s not private; for the above stated reasons I don&#39;t want\n&gt; to discuss this detail).\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m only a rookie in programming as such and might not know things\n&gt; that are second nature to you. But having a singleton-like\n&gt; architecture seems to me to contradict the tests separation\n&gt; principle...\n\nI got my start in this community by writing about that very topic. \nGoogle &quot;use your singletons wisely&quot;.\n\n&gt; Every time I call a static method of my APP class, I use\n&gt; the same object...\n&gt; \n&gt; And what&#39;s what started to give me trouble recently. It is possible to\n&gt; initialize this APP object, yloading GUI modules or not. To be honest,\n&gt; using it without UI is a workaround of mine, which I implemented to be\n&gt; somewhat closer to unit testing, although my tasks are actually\n&gt; regular regression tests, examining whole big chunks of\n&gt; functionality... So in a part of my tests that don&#39;t need the\n&gt; graphical modules, I simply don&#39;t load them.\n\nI don&#39;t consider that a workaround, but rather more focused testing. \nIt&#39;s a Good Thing.\n\n&gt; However, I&#39;ve recently\n&gt; been trying out some other type of tests that operate on a\n&gt; full-fledged application, which needs loading the UI. And that&#39;s where\n&gt; the problem begins - trying to load those modules, having used the\n&gt; application without them in previous tests, is in the application, as\n&gt; it currently is, impossible (and don&#39;t think that anyone will take\n&gt; grumbling of a humble tester into consideration).\n&gt; \n&gt; So the question to you guys is as follows: should I give up hope that\n&gt; my job has anything to do with unit testing, and allow dosens of funny\n&gt; windows to jump here and fro while basic functionality is being\n&gt; checked or rather do you see any other possibility to solve my problem\n&gt; that I, humble rookie, overlooked?\n\nIf no-one will take your &quot;grumbling&quot; (which is really simple, obvious \ndesign criticism that they should listen to) into consideration, then \nyes, give up on trying to unit test. The idea that you could do unit \ntesting /for/ them is absurd on its face. You could do it /with/ them, \nor they could do it with your advice, but you can&#39;t do it for them. It \njust doesn&#39;t work.\n\nSo you&#39;d need to change the hearts and minds before you can make \nprogress with the practice.\n\nGood luck.\n-- \nJ. B.
