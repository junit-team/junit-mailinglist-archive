What you are describing is acceptance testing, not<br/>\nunit testing.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnit testing allows you to test very small portions of code in order to<br/>\ncatch failures as soon as possible.  If all you test is public/protected<br/>\nmethods, you will miss an opportunity to catch a bug in a very fundamental<br/>\npiece of your code and you will be wasting time looking for it.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, imagine you are writing a file manager that can list your files<br/>\nin several orders (by date, by name, etc...) and therefore, makes use of<br/>\nseveral types of algorithms, all private.  One day, the program starts<br/>\nshowing the files in the wrong order.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe sort algorithm is not exposed to anyone, but if you unit-test it, you<br/>\nwill catch the error much earlier instead of starting to investigate, say,<br/>\nyour list widget.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t be dogmatic about testing:  test whatever you think can break.  And<br/>\nit&#39;s okay if it includes private methods.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nCédric<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://beust.com/testng\">http://beust.com/testng</a></div>",
