I&#39;m currently working<br/>\non a project in which I had to use JACOB (See here FMI:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/jacob-project/)\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/jacob-project/)</a> to access a COM object<br/>\nvia Java.  I got my class working correctly and was quite happy.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, once I tried to write a JUnit test for it, it mysteriously<br/>\nceased working.  After spending about a day and a half on the issue we<br/>\ntried, in desperation, moving the whole shebang to another developer&#39;s<br/>\nenvironment wherein it worked beautifully.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat developer was then tasked with writing the JUnit test, but before<br/>\nhe could do so he had to apply the JUnit JAR files to his Eclipse<br/>\nenvironment.  Immediately the COM accessing class failed once more.<br/>\n<br/>\nCurious, we uninstalled the JUnit JAR from my environment and lo and<br/>\nbehold, the class began working again.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, obviously there is some conflict between JUnit and JACOB. I&#39;m<br/>\nusing JUnit 3.8.1 and JACOB 1.8.  Any help or assistance would be<br/>\ngreatly appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\nJV</div>",
