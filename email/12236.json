Let&#39;s presume I&#39;ve reached<br/>\nthe stage where I have successfully implemented the rules engine along<br/>\nwith a full suite of unit tests. Would I be violating any canons by<br/>\nhaving JUnit output its results in some text-like form to enable quick<br/>\ncomparisons between result sets of different rules changes ? Is there<br/>\na more elegant way to accomplish this ? I&#39;m essentially trying to come<br/>\nup with a quick way to tell the user &quot;When you change Rule # 5 that<br/>\nway, loans 1, 4 and 7 fail but 2,3 and 89 now pass.&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again for your help.<br/>\n<br/>\nRob Rambusch </span></blockquote></div>",
