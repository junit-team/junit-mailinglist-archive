I&#39;m in the\n&gt; unfortunate situation of having to write tests for an existing\n&gt; application(I haven&#39;t been involved in the development).\n&gt; \n&gt; I found tons of information about test-driven development and\n&gt; test-first, but hardly anything about writing tests after the\n&gt; application has been developed. Any experiences?\n\nSure, most of us have to deal with legacy code at some point. Michael\nFeathers has even written a whole book on the subject.\n\nIn general, test last is not the way to go if you can avoid it -\nbuilding the tests first makes sure that the code is inherently\ntestable out of necessity. That is not always the case if you try to\nwrite the tests last. And when you write the tests first, you can be\nsure that they fail when the code is wrong and pretty sure that\npassing means the code is correct. If you write them after the fact,\nthey may pass whether the code works or doesn&#39;t.\n\nAnd if that is not enough for you, consider this: when you use the\ntests to drive you development, you actually write them because it is\nsimply easier and faster to develop that way (for one thing, many of\nus TDD practitioners rarely need to use the debugger). When you write\nthem afterwards, you do so reluctantly, since the *code already works*\n- so you don&#39;t think you need them.\n\nA simple analogy: have you ever seen a stone arch being built? If not,\ncan you picture how it must be done? Once all the stones are in place,\nthey stay there because none of them can fall through the others. But\nhow do you get them there in the first place? Image trying to hold all\nthe stones in place simultaneously while you try to get the keystone\nset. You would drop a lot of them and get really frustrated. But a\nmason first builds a simple wooden form shaped like the interior of\nthe arch and piles the stones on it. Then he takes it away when they\nare in place. Even though he has done this &quot;extra work&quot; of building\nthe form, it is faster and more reliable to do it that way. It is the\nsame thing with developer unit tests.\n&gt; \n&gt; It still isn&#39;t determined yet on which level the tests should take\n&gt; place. &quot;Real unit-tests&quot; (&quot;test everything that could possibly break&quot;)\n&gt; would be too much work for the given time(~6 weeks), I guess. So it\n&gt; might be more something like acceptance tests.\n&gt; \n&gt; The SUT is a middleware-API running on an application server, using\n&gt; webservices and RMI to get and set customer data from several remote\n&gt; databases (lots of getters for about 10mio customers). =&gt; no user\n&gt; interface/gui etc.\n&gt; \n&gt; Since we still have to exactly figure out what we want to test, I\n&gt; would appreciate some information about whether or not JUnit is the\n&gt; right choice in general (alternatives?) and some advices for my &quot;test\n&gt; last&quot; approach.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks in advance,\n&gt; Thomas\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
