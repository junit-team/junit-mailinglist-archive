I am in charge of getting a test\n&gt; framework written for an application with over 200K lines of code that does\n&gt; not have a single test case yet.  Yikes!  It is very confusing about how to\n&gt; start and how to set up an application level test suite that will touch all\n&gt; the classes.  I would be willing to write about my experiences once I\n&gt; figure it out, but that may be some time.\n&gt;\n\nCan you tell us more about this effort?  Specifically, if you had test cases for all the\ncode, how would that help?\n\nIn general, before touching existing code I&#39;ll write a test to create a safety net.  The\ntest helps me learn the behaviors of the existing code, and gives me confidence that I\ncan fiddle with it safely.  The test suite grows over time as more code is touched,\ndefects are reported, and I learn more about its intended behavior.\n\nIt sounds as if you&#39;re attempting to write tests for all the classes post-development.\nI haven&#39;t had good experiences with attempting to generate test cases en masse.\nGenerated test code tends to be too shallow, and I miss the opportunity to learn more\nabout the code.\n\nMike\n\n--\nMike Clark\nClarkware Consulting, Inc.\nhttp://www.clarkware.com\n720.851.2014\n\n\n\n",
