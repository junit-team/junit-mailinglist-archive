My CS 1 lab manual (which uses JUnit<br/>\n&gt; everywhere, all the time) is currently just for private use; I am<br/>\n&gt; planning to get it published somehow, somewhere. I hope to do the same<br/>\n&gt; to my PL materials.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I had plans to start a book on teaching OOP entirely through tests and <br/>\nTDD, but then I started to suffer some serious burnout and I have put <br/>\nthat plan to the side for now. I strongly believe such a book would be <br/>\nvaluable, either as a fieldguide for teachers of all kinds, from <br/>\nconsultants and mentors to university instructors.
