In my experience, most<br/>\npeople estimate the time to design and code their module and then want<br/>\nto add an estimate for writing tests for that module once the design and<br/>\ncoding are finished.  I&#39;ve found two major drawbacks to this approach:<br/>\n    1) It will take longer to write the tests after the design and<br/>\ncoding are finished than it does to write the unit tests at the same<br/>\ntime design and coding are happening.  This is because the module isn&#39;t<br/>\nnecessarily designed with tests in mind so it&#39;s harder to write tests<br/>\nfor portions of the code in isolation (i.e. the design doesn&#39;t allow<br/>\nthat code to be isolated).  Another reason that writing tests takes<br/>\nlonger here is because there are naturally bugs in the design and coding<br/>\nof the module that will be discovered when the tests are finally<br/>\nwritten.  This means that the time designated as &quot;unit testing&quot; in the<br/>\nestimate will also be spent re-designing and re-coding.  This highlights<br/>\nthe problem with testing only after the coding is finished (and the<br/>\nreason testing as-you-go takes less time): the time spent coding to a<br/>\nbad design is wasted time.  It is better to discover the design flaw as<br/>\nsoon as possible so very little time is wasted on coding to the bad<br/>\ndesign.  Many design flaws aren&#39;t apparent until you start writing code<br/>\nthat calls your module (and the unit tests are the first thing that does<br/>\nthis), so it&#39;s better to have the tests going as early in the process as<br/>\npossible.<br/>\n    2) There&#39;s a tendency for developers to view the time allocated for<br/>\ntesting as a schedule pad (since they didn&#39;t really want to spend time<br/>\ntesting anyway).  When this happens, they allow the design and coding<br/>\nportion of their schedule to take a bit longer then catch up by spending<br/>\nless time writing tests.  This is a problem for obvious reasons.<br/>\n <br/>\nThat said, you still have the issue of how best to estimate the schedule<br/>\nfor building your great product.  For someone who is not already<br/>\nexperienced in unit testing and test driven development (TDD) practices,<br/>\nI would recommend estimating the time to complete a module to be twice<br/>\nwhat they would estimate taking without doing testing.  This seems like<br/>\na lot of extra time, but it really isn&#39;t when you look at the entire<br/>\nprocess for getting a product finished and out the door.  In my<br/>\nexperience, developers estimating their time to complete a module<br/>\nconsider the time to design and code the module, and their estimate ends<br/>\nthere.  In reality, once they&#39;ve &quot;finished&quot; the module they will<br/>\ncontinue to spend time coming back to the module to fix bugs found in<br/>\nsome QA process, which means the total time spent to build the module<br/>\nincludes their design+code time as well as all of the bug fixes.  By<br/>\ndoubling the traditional estimate (which would have been just the<br/>\ndesign+code time), you&#39;re allowing for the extra time to write the tests<br/>\nand fix the bugs found by those tests.  It will also allow some<br/>\nadditional time to learn about how best to do unit testing, which won&#39;t<br/>\nhappen with every project.  Once a developer has completed a couple of<br/>\nprojects with testing, they will be better able to come up with<br/>\nestimates that include the testing effort (which can be as accurate as<br/>\nestimates can be for this sort of thing, and we all know there&#39;s a lot<br/>\nof uncertainty here).<br/>\n <br/>\nI would definitely recommend taking the time to train and convince your<br/>\nteam the best practices for writing tests and doing test driven<br/>\ndevelopment.  This includes the technical aspects of the testing<br/>\nframework (JUnit) as well as the theoretical aspects of the discipline.<br/>\nIn my experience, some developers have a hard time with this and it<br/>\ntakes time for them to realize that you really can finish a project<br/>\nfaster when following these practices.<br/>\n <br/>\nWell, that was rather long-winded.  Hope the information you really<br/>\nwanted is in there somewhere.<br/>\n..David..<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>] On Behalf Of<br/>\nRakesh Patel<br/>\nSent: Friday, September 30, 2005 12:39 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: [junit] Query on estimation<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHi,<br/>\n<br/>\nI have read more about unit testing than actually doing it so bear that<br/>\nin mind - apparently, once the developers have got used to writing unit<br/>\ntests, the time taken to write code+unit tests is shorter than just<br/>\nwriting the code. The reason being that you end up writing &#39;just enough&#39;<br/>\nto get the job done because you have tests.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, it is not recommended to split estimates into 2 parts like that.<br/>\nUnit testing and code-writing are one task.<br/>\n<br/>\nHopefully, someone with more experience will back these comments up.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<br/>\n<br/>\nRakesh<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>] On Behalf Of<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sachin.dholakia@...\">sachin.dholakia@...</a><br/>\nSent: 29 September 2005 09:31<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [junit] Query on estimation<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDear all,<br/>\n<br/>\nI would like to use JUnits for a development project.
