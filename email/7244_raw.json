Can you use use the thin driver?\n&gt; This will remove the dll-dependency.\n&gt; \n\nWell, with Bernd&#39;s &quot;thin driver&quot; suggestion, I am able to avoid the \nreal issue. All the JUnit-based tests can now be invoked together \nthrough Ant&#39;s &lt;junit&gt; task with 100% success. Also, my application \nruns its system-level tests.\nAll I had to do was modify part of the connection string that I \npassed to my getConnection():\n        connection_str = &quot;jdbc:oracle:thin:@(description=(address=\n(host= &quot;\n//         connection_str = &quot;jdbc:oracle:oci8:@(description=(address=\n(host=&quot;\n            + host + &quot;)(protocol=tcp)(port=&quot; + port +\n            &quot;))(connect_data=(sid=&quot; + sid + &quot;)))&quot;;\n\nBut, I cannot announce any resolution or advice for the basic \nclassloader/problem.\n\n&gt; Have your tried the textui runner?\n\nEven with the &quot;thick-driver&quot;, I was able to invoke both of my test \nsuites through the TestRunner&#39;s SwingUI interface. I could select \neach one in the &quot;Test Class Name&quot; choicebox and get successfull runs \nas many times as I wanted.\n\nAnyone care to make another suggestion concerning the Ant/JUnit setup \nto fix the original classloader/library problem? Does anybody think \nthey have a test suite that successfully resolves a similar issue?\n\nI was suprised that my attempts to implement the suggestion at:\nhttp://junit.sourceforge.net/doc/faq/faq.htm#running_8\n&quot;Why do I get an error (ClassCastException or LinkageError) using the \nGUI TestRunners&quot;\nhad no effect.\nBut, I did not have the problem with the TestRunners, only Ant&#39;s \n&lt;junit&gt; task. Hmmm...\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Bernd\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thanks\n&gt; &gt; -Tim\n&gt; &gt; \n\n\n\n",
