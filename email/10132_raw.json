Maybe someone out their uses \nEclipse and can point me in the right direction.\n\nI downloaded Eclipse and it appears to have JUnit as part of the \ndownload. When I try to use JUnit as per the the &quot;Eclipse in Action \nWorkbook&quot; I do not get the results the book indicates. Basically I \ncan&#39;t get it to work. Also the release level of JUnit does not match \nthe book either.\n\nI assume I should download the latest release of JUnit and install \nit. Is their somewhere I can obtain install instructions for JUnit?\n\nThanks in advance for any help provided.\n\nJared\n\n\n",
