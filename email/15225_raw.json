The size and low vote count put it lower down on \nmy priority list than (especially) full native JUnit 4 support.\n\n&gt;    I&#39;ve also filled number of others requests against Eclipse JUnit\n&gt; integration. Please take a look. If others from this list are also\n&gt; using Eclipse and like to see some of them implemented it would make\n&gt; sense to vote for them:\n\nIt certainly would.  Votes and discussion on Eclipse bugs are taken \nseriously by the Eclipse developers.\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt;   It seems violating the concept of annotations. You should not\n&gt; &gt;&gt;annotate the behaviour, but rather define enough metadata that can be\n&gt; &gt;&gt;used by the tool to decide how to behave.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tricky, maybe, but violating is a strong word.  :)  Can you give an\n&gt; &gt; example of how using annotations to identify the Runner that should be\n&gt; &gt; used by a particular class might be a problem?  Thanks,\n&gt;\n&gt;    Let me ask you another question first. Why would you need to have a\n&gt; different runner for some specific test?\n\nYou may of course ask another question first, but I hope that I can \nstill get an answer to my question.  :)  One thing that I may have \nmanaged to make unclear is that the meaning of Runner has changed in \nJUnit 4.  Now there is a JUnitCore class responsible for running an \nentire set of test classes.  Each test class has a separate Runner \ninstance invoked, which knows how to run the tests in that class.  There \nare four runners that are currently shipping with JUnit 4:\n\n* TestClassRunner, for default JUnit 4 test classes\n* OldTestClassRunner, for implementers of the JUnit 3 \njunit.framework.Test interface\n* AllTests, for classes that do not implement Test, but declare a \nsuite() method\n* Parameterized, for the proposed new JUnit 4 parameterized test API\n\n&gt;    This doesn&#39;t sound right to me to begin with and may also make more\n&gt; difficult to integrate with different tools (including coverage\n&gt; metrisc, etc).\n\nThere might be problems.  I&#39;ve tried it out and liked it, and I can&#39;t \nnecessarily see how coverage metrics would be affected by the new Runner \nidea.  But I&#39;d definitely be interested in your experiences with it.  \nHave you tried it?\n\n    David Saff\n\n",
