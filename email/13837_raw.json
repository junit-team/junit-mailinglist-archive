For \n&gt; example,\n&gt;  &gt; you can have &quot;database&quot; tests, &quot;front-end&quot; tests, &quot;security&quot; tests, \n&gt; etc...\n&gt; \n&gt; I strongly agree, and I think this is something important that is simply\n&gt; missing from JUnit.\n\njunit.framework says nothing about how you collect tests to be run. The \ndefault JUnit test runner makes those decisions, and I agree it&#39;s \nannoying the way the current test-collecting behavior is hardwired as \nclass-level methods. That said, combine GSBase&#39;s &quot;RecursiveTestSuite&quot; or \nJUnit-addons&#39; &quot;DirectorySuiteBuilder&quot; with a filter that examines any \nmetadat you want, and you can run any subset of the tests you can imagine.\n\nAgreed, TestNG supports this out of the box, but for every neat feature \nTestNG supports out of the box there will be 20 people crying about this \nother neat feature it doesn&#39;t support... it&#39;s for that reason that JUnit \ndoesn&#39;t even try. :)\n\nOne big difference between the two is that JUnit assumes that the test \nsuite is computed before the first test runs, and I admit that is a \nfundamental and useful difference between JUnit and TestNG. I suppose \nonce TestNG has a large user base we&#39;ll have a clearer idea how \nimportant that is. (I know that day is approaching!)\n\n&lt;snip /&gt;\n&gt; Or you can use marker interfaces to the same purpose:\n&gt; \n&gt; public class FooTest implements NeedsDatabaseTest, FunctionalTest { ... }\n&gt; \n&gt; and simply have a test collector that finds all of the classes that\n&gt; include or exclude particular marker interfaces.  How are annotations\n&gt; superior to just using interfaces like that?\n\nYou could say that marker annotations are &quot;merely&quot; syntax sugar \nreplacing marker interfaces. That said, syntax sugar done well is very \nnice. Also, annotations were /designed/ for this kind of thing, and \ninterfaces weren&#39;t. Interfaces are not metadata, even if they can be \nmetadata. My butter knife can be a screwdriver, but that doesn&#39;t mean I \nshould avoid buying a screwdriver.\n-- \nJ. B.
