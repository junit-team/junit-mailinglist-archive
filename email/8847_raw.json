So far, I know that I need separate the \ncommand \n&gt; &gt;&gt;line parsing into two steps. First is to transfer command line \nargs \n&gt; &gt;&gt;to a builder. Second is to use the builder to set the private \nmember \n&gt; &gt;&gt;variables. I could understand the first step to use equivalent \n&gt; &gt;&gt;operation to compare two builder class objects. However, I have \nsome \n&gt; &gt;&gt;sort of difficult to understand the Second step. Could you \nprovide \n&gt; &gt;&gt;some code snippets to give more concrete explanations? Thanks \nvery \n&gt; &gt;&gt;much!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;I will take some time to write this up on my JUnit blog tonight.\n&gt; &gt;http://junit.blog-city.com\n&gt; \n&gt; The unexpected birth of six bunnies last night made it impossible \nfor me to do this last night. I&#39;ll try again today. :)\n&gt; \n&gt; Two litters of rabbits in three weeks. Anyone want a bunny?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; J. B.

Thanks a \nlot for your help!\n\n\n",
