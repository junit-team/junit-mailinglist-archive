In the example I posted (the silly one) there are obviously<br/>\nfewer lines of code in the executeCommand method in the second example<br/>\nbut the total number of lines will likely be more (counting the total<br/>\nnumber of lines in the project).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe example is not the best I couldn&#39;t think of a really good one,<br/>\nperhaps it would make more sense if the command was executed like<br/>\nthis:<br/>\n<br/>\ncommand.execute(this.robotController);<br/>\n<br/>\nOr something, I have my preference but I don&#39;t know if it is the<br/>\nsimple one in everyones book. I think it can become more complicated<br/>\nthan just counting lines fo code to know what is simple but I agree<br/>\nthat it is a good start.</div>",
