Any shared variable you\n&gt; want your tests to\n&gt; access should usually go into the setUp() method. \n&gt; In your case it\n&gt; doesn&#39;t look like it&#39;s affecting your test, but for\n&gt; future reference\n&gt; this habit could cause errors that are very\n&gt; difficult to track down --\n&gt; eg. static variables in a test.  (If you want more\n&gt; info. on this let me\n&gt; know and I will start a new thread.)\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; my assertion is failing \n&gt; &gt; when the method testRegisterDuplicatedUser() is\n&gt; executed. Can \n&gt; &gt; somebody tell me why?\n&gt; \n&gt; You will need to be more specific.  Where is the\n&gt; failure?  Is it on the\n&gt; first assertion of that method or the second?\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; This is my first post to this forum. Is this the\n&gt; right forum to ask \n&gt; &gt; such questions? \n&gt; \n&gt; This is the place.\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; Jason Rogers\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Where there is no vision, the people perish...&quot;\n&gt; Bible, Proverbs 29:18\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
