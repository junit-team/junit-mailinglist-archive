Some<br/>\nof these might become part of the JUnit distribution, and others will<br/>\nbecome popular extensions.  Is there anything that you&#39;d like to do<br/>\nwith JUnit that you can&#39;t now?  That&#39;s a great place to start.<br/>\nOtherwise, you could look through the bug database for something that<br/>\nlooks like it would take a day or two at most.  Is this something<br/>\nthat&#39;s explicitly for a school class, or your own interest?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve CC&#39;ed the junit-devel list with this response, and further<br/>\ndiscussion may make sense there.  Thanks,<br/>\n<br/>\n   David Saff<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 10/28/07, Akshay Savadatti &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:asavadatti@...\">asavadatti@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Hi All,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;       I am a student and I am interested in devoting some of my time<br/>\n&gt; to develop some additional functionality/fix bugs for junit.
