Unit tests in the classic sense are mutually exclusive from functional tests. There may be some overlap in coverage, but there is no union of test cases. \n\nIs what you are trying to say is that you want to use Junit as a framework and harness for black box functional testing of Java API&#39;s? \n\n\nCheers,\nBill \n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: erikstunkat \n  To: junit@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Wednesday, April 17, 2002 4:26 AM\n  Subject: [junit] junit tests and functional/ integration tests\n\n\n  Hi,\n  I know that unit tests should run on their own and every test should \n  be executable of its own - but..\n  we want to use unit tests for a QA related functional framework and \n  we yet defined some tasks with ant to run tests in a specific order. \n  My question: is there any extension for junit to define properties \n  for tests in a more straightforward way then java properties files \n  (xml?) and to combine several unit tests with global attributes and \n  properties?\n\n  thanks in advance!\n\n  erik stunkat\n\n\n        Yahoo!
