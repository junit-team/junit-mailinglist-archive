Most of my &quot;concrete&quot; classes implement more\n&gt; than one of these interfaces.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now, I was hoping to find a way to refactor my tests so that each\n&gt; interface has its own abstract TestCase. Then, if multiple inheritance\n&gt; was allowed in Java, I could simply implement each classes concrete\n&gt; classe&#39;s TestCase by inheriting from all the appropriate &quot;interface\n&gt; TestCases&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; This would allow me to inherit all the general purpose fixtures and\n&gt; simply add some new fixtures targeted for the concrete classe&#39;s\n&gt; specific behavior. In a way, I simply want to enforce the &quot;Liskov\n&gt; Substitution Principle&quot; as simply as possible...\n&gt; \n&gt; I know multiple inheritance isn&#39;t allowed in Java and should be\n&gt; avoided anyway but I&#39;d like to find a simple way to keep the general\n&gt; idea of &quot;interface specific super TestCases&quot; and apply it to classes\n&gt; implementing several of these interfaces.\n&gt; \n&gt; Is the general idea a good one ? If it is, what is  the best \n&gt; way to achieve it ?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks in advance,\n&gt; \n&gt; D.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
