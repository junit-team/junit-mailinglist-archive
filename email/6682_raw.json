Actually, if it doesn&#39;t return a value AND doesn&#39;t have a \nside effect, it isn&#39;t doing anything. \n\nThere may be a way to verify that the side effect actually occurred \nas expected. For example, consider the add() method in the Collection \nclasses. There are ways of verifying that the side effect happened \n(i.e. the object was added). You can check the size and assert that \nit is what is expected: \n\n    public void testCollectionAdd() {\n    Collection collection = new ArrayList();\n    assertEquals(0, collection.size());\n    collection.add(&quot;itemA&quot;);\n    assertEquals(1, collection.size());\n    collection.add(&quot;itemB&quot;);\n    assertEquals(2, collection.size());\n}\n\n \n\n\nAnother approach is to make use of MockObjects. \n\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Pardeep Duggal&quot; &lt;psduggal@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; Hi,\n&gt;   Could someone tell me how to test methods that do not return any \nvalue. For example, the loadFromDatabase() or similar methods that do \nnot return any value but in turn loads internally a vector or a Hash \ntable with some specific data. and the data it loads is accesible \nthru the get methods. by calling the get methods and seeing if it \ndoes not return me null value is one option, but this does not tell \nme whether the correct data has been loaded.\n&gt;   also how do we test database related methods which involve \nupdating the database??\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n",
