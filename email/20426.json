As I stated in my message to you dated 20<br/>\nMarch 08, we are finishing up the 4.5 release and so are not focusing on new<br/>\nfeatures.<br/>\n <br/>\nJUnit has a long history of slow evolution and I expect that to continue. I<br/>\nconsider it a compliment when people can make JUnit much more usable with<br/>\nminor modifications. If everyone has to make the same modifications, that&#39;s<br/>\ndefinitely a problem, or if everyone has to modify the core, but our<br/>\nphilosophy has always been to make JUnit an intersection instead of a union<br/>\nof all useful testing-related functionality.<br/>\n <br/>\nThe next steps I would suggest for you are:<br/>\n    1) Do something to accelerate the 4.5 release, like fill in missing<br/>\njavadoc.<br/>\n    2) Add automated tests to your feature requests.<br/>\n <br/>\nBeginning to contribute to an existing project is a little like going to<br/>\nsomeone else&#39;s home. If you are demanding, if you rearrange all the<br/>\nfurniture, if, in short, you act like you are the most important person in<br/>\nthe room, then you are unlikely to be welcome. If you listen carefully and<br/>\noffer to help, you have a chance of building a relationship that will help<br/>\nyou feel at home and prepare the way for a closer relationship.<br/>\n <br/>\nBest regards,<br/>\n <br/>\nKent Beck<br/>\nThree Rivers Institute<br/>\n<br/>\n  _____  <br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of<br/>\ntoalexsmail<br/>\nSent: Friday, March 28, 2008 12:03 PM<br/>\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com<br/>\nSubject: [junit] Re: How can I join developping group?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIt tokes about 3 weeks since I started to figure out how can I<br/>\ncontribute to JUnit project. I eventually wrote to all administrators,<br/>\nbut I have receive no answer from them. If nobody want to discuss my<br/>\nproposition (and there is no discussion and threads that I opened), so<br/>\nat least give me write access to CVS and I will do it myself.<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In junit@yahoogroups. &lt;mailto:junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt; com, Ilja Preuss<br/>\n&lt;it@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Did you take a look at http://junit.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>&lt;http://junit.sourceforge.net/#Developer&gt; sourceforge.net/#Developer ?<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; toalexsmail wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I have some ideas of little improvements of JUnit.
