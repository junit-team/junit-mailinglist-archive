If so, have you come up with any strategies\n&gt; for unit testing against the Prevayler without changing its source? I\n&gt; have been considering refactoring Prevayler to talk to byte streams and\n&gt; having one wrapper around it that uses the file system for production\n&gt; and another wrapper that keeps everything in memory for test.\n&gt;\n&gt; *********** REPLY SEPARATOR  ***********\n&gt;\n&gt; On 2002-09-07 at 17:37 Andrew Forward wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I am curious under what circumstances the file ssytem is too slow to\n&gt;&gt; clean up after itself?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I have some code that crawls files and directories, so to test this\n&gt;&gt; functionality I create the hierachy right in the TestCase.  I use a\n&gt;&gt; special createFile(...) method to, of course, create the file, as well\n&gt; as\n&gt;&gt; track it in a Vector to be cleaned up on every tearDown();\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Would it be better to increment the root directory name and then\n&gt; delete\n&gt;&gt; all the structures at the end of all test cases?  Or would this\n&gt; present a\n&gt;&gt; similar problem when joining multiple tests from multiple test classes\n&gt;&gt; (provided they also access the file system in a similar manner).\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; andrew f\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; ```````````````````````\n&gt;&gt; A common idea is to kill a folder on the file system after every test,\n&gt; in\n&gt;&gt; order to start with a &quot;clean slate&quot;. Unfortunately, the\n&gt;&gt; tests are too fast for the file system, so the file system isn&#39;t clean\n&gt;&gt; before the next test starts.\n&gt;&gt; ```````````\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
