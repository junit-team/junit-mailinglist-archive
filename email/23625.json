    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1219106684\">All,<br/>\n<br/>\nTo date, we&#39;ve kept two pieces of documentary metadata along with<br/>\nJUnit: acknowledgements.txt and ReleaseNotes files.  In order:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) acknowledgements.txt is an attempt at a log of everyone outside of<br/>\nthe primary maintainers who has contributed in some way to JUnit.  It<br/>\nwas, I believe, originally intended to serve two purposes: (a) for<br/>\ntraceability, should any legal questions arise about the provenance of<br/>\na piece of code, (b) before github, we often ended up massaging (or<br/>\nreplacing) patches ourselves before committing them to CVS, and we<br/>\nwanted a way to genuinely thank and remember the original authors.<br/>\n<br/>\nGitHub now helps with both of these issues: since we can discuss pull<br/>\nrequests before they&#39;re accepted, we can ask contributors to fix minor<br/>\nissues, and github keeps excellent track of what came from where.  In<br/>\naddition, distributed maintenance of the acknowledgements.txt file has<br/>\nbecome a pain, since as a linear document, there is often a race<br/>\ncondition between appended items.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) I&#39;ve been asking committers to include updates to ReleaseNotes<br/>\nfiles as part of check-ins.  This has some of the same issues as<br/>\nabove: it&#39;s no longer strictly necessary given GitHub support, and<br/>\nalso leads to race conditions.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, my proposal is:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Drop further appends to acknowedgements.txt<br/>\n2) Adopt a more formal approach to git commit messages, following<br/>\nalong <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html,\">http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html,</a><br/>\nalong release notes to be largely auto-generated at release time.<br/>\n<br/>\nThoughts?</div>",
