RE: Test Coverage Analysis<br/>\n&gt; To ol For Junit<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We find using simple code coverage (method entry profiling) <br/>\n&gt; is a cheap and<br/>\n&gt; easy way to double-check your tests and helps ensure you <br/>\n&gt; really did test<br/>\n&gt; everything you intended to test with your test cases. I believe Joseph<br/>\n&gt; Pelrine, possibly in this lecture<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://oopsla.acm.org/ap/tutorials/tut66.html,\">http://oopsla.acm.org/ap/tutorials/tut66.html,</a> mentioned <br/>\n&gt; several groups<br/>\n&gt; using XP who thought they were doing a fine job of writing <br/>\n&gt; tests, only to<br/>\n&gt; find on running their tests under a code coverage profiler <br/>\n&gt; (SilverMark&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; Test Mentor with code coverage profiling turned on), that <br/>\n&gt; they had missed a<br/>\n&gt; number of important functional variations/methods. The way I <br/>\n&gt; look at it, we<br/>\n&gt; test because we admit we are fallible. Any tool or technique <br/>\n&gt; that, when used<br/>\n&gt; properly, can help guard against that fallibility when we <br/>\n&gt; write our tests<br/>\n&gt; must be a good thing.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br/>\n&gt; Mike Silverstein, Lead Architect\tvoice:  (919) 858-8300 x29<br/>\n&gt; SilverMark, Inc.\t\t\tfax:    (919) 858-8308<br/>\n&gt; 5511 Capital Center Drive\t\tmobile: (919) 669-5906<br/>\n&gt; Suite 510, Raleigh, NC 27606\t\ttoll free: (888) 588-0668<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.silvermark.com\">http://www.silvermark.com</a>\t\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:msilverstein@...\">msilverstein@...</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Steve Freeman [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:steve@...\">steve@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Tuesday, April 24, 2001 7:32 PM<br/>\n&gt; &gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [junit] Is coverage important?

A couple of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; projects ago we hit this number the first time we ran a coverage<br/>\n&gt; &gt; tool 3 months into the project.

RE: Test Coverage<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Analysis To ol For Junit<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Is coverage really that important?  The directive is to &quot;Test<br/>\n&gt; &gt; everything that could possibly break&quot;, not &quot;Test everything&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Unit Tests give you great benefits in productivity and quality.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I have worked on XP teams that measured both quality and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; productivity.  Unit Testing and XP does improve both!  However,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; there comes a point where more Unit Tests only marginally<br/>\n&gt; &gt; increases quality while not increasing productivity (even<br/>\n&gt; &gt; negatively impacting productivity).  Developers should question<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the value of creating more Unit Tests.  If you are not careful,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; you can get into a &quot;Test everything&quot; mode and kill productivity.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Since Coverage metrics can lead the team to focus on &quot;Test<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Everything&quot;, it isn&#39;t a great measurement.  Instead, focus on<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;things that could break&quot; and you will continue to gain both<br/>\n&gt; &gt; increased productivity and quality.   Only use Coverage tools to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; reveal something that could break.  Using coverage as a metric is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; a poor practice.  I suggest using quality metrics instead (i.e.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; number of Unit Tests and number of passing Functional Tests)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; - Greg Houston<br/>\n&gt; &gt; www.ISS.net<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
