[:)]\n\nSecond one: If you use XML just as a example and the real &quot;Graph\n&lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory&gt;  &quot; objects is of other king,\nthan I think in parsers - well, let me explain:\nYou have a &quot;Graph&quot; of objects, this mean that you have one object\nconnected in other and this object connected in other and so on.\nProbably you need access some object in this &quot;Graph&quot;; when is needed\naccess this object you will have chance to test it . A example is more\nexplanatory:\n\nSuppose I will access a budget object; a real budget will have a lot of\nobjects connected to it, this is a &quot;Graph&quot;. Make a test to know if the\nroot object is correct, check yours attributes and no more. Right now I\ndon&#39;t care about others objects in this &quot;Graph&quot;.\n\nSuppose now that I need access some product inside of the list product.\nThis will use the first code - a kind of service; I know that I have the\ncorrect budget, now I need know if this budget have the correct first\nproduct - now I need access it. I will make a test to know if this\nproduct is correct.\n\nIn this explanation I make unitary test step-by-step, walking on the\n&quot;Graph&quot; when needed.\n\nI expected that you have understood what I want tell. My paper will be\nmore clear.  [;)]  Sorry about my poor English.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n",
