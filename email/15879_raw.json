I hope there&#39;ll be a great program this year.\n\nOf course, in the interest of equal time, we should mention:\n\nWaterfall 2006\n\nhttp://www.waterfall2006.com/\n\n\n&quot;After years of being disparaged by some in the software development\ncommunity, the waterfall process is back with a vengeance. You&#39;ve always\nknown a good waterfall-based process is the right way to develop software\nprojects. Come to the Waterfall 2006 conference and see how a sequential\ndevelopment process can benefit your next project. Learn how slow,\ndeliberate handoffs (with signatures!) between groups can slow the rate of\nchange on any project so that development teams have more time to spend on\nanticipating user needs through big, upfront design.&quot;\n\n\nKeynotes\n- Put Testing Where It Belongs--At the End by Brian Marick\n- Dead Fish Can&#39;t Swim But They Can Float Down a Waterfall by Tim Lister\n- Extreme Programming Uninstalled by Ron Jeffries\n- Super Model Driven Architecture: An Update From the OMG by Tyra Banks\n\nAlso check out the exciting tutorials.\n\nhttp://www.waterfall2006.com/\n\n\nShare and Enjoy,\n\n    David Saff\n\nAlex Viggio wrote:\n&gt; AGILE 2006\n&gt; July 23-29, 2006\n&gt; Hyatt Regency Hotel\n&gt; Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; *** CFP SUBMISSION DEADLINES WILL SOON ARRIVE ***\n&gt;\n&gt; - January 31, 2006:  Discovery Session, Experience Reports, Hands-on\n&gt;    Sessions, Tutorials\n&gt;\n&gt; - February 28, 2006:  Research Papers, Educators&#39; Symposium\n&gt;\n&gt; Agile 2006 will be an exciting conference about techniques and\n&gt; technologies, attitudes and policies, research and experience, and the\n&gt; management and development sides of agile software development. The\n&gt; agile approach focuses on delivering business value early in the project\n&gt; lifetime and being able to incorporate emergent requirements. It\n&gt; accentuates the use of rich, informal communication channels and\n&gt; frequent delivery of running, tested systems, while attending to the\n&gt; human component of software development.\n&gt;\n&gt; Agile 2006 gives attendees access to the latest thinking in this domain,\n&gt; and bridges communities that rarely get a proper chance to exchange\n&gt; ideas and thoughts. It brings together researchers from labs and\n&gt; academia with executives, managers, and developers in the trenches of\n&gt; software development. The conference is not about a single methodology\n&gt; or approach, but rather provides a forum for the exchange of information\n&gt; regarding all agile development technologies.\n&gt;\n&gt; Visit the conference website at http://www.agile2006.com for details on\n&gt; all submission categories and links to the online submission areas.\n&gt;\n&gt; We invite submissions for the following:\n&gt;\n&gt; **Research paper\n&gt; An original contribution to the field of agile development. These\n&gt; submissions have the potential to promote reflection in the field, to\n&gt; deepen our understanding of agile approaches, to influence future\n&gt; developments, and to inspire innovation.\n&gt;\n&gt; **Educators&#39; Symposium\n&gt; A one-day event targeted particularly for agile educators. Sessions here\n&gt; may take a variety of forms, such as papers, panels and activities.\n&gt;\n&gt; **Experience Report\n&gt; An opportunity to describe what did or didn&#39;t work for you on a project.\n&gt; Experience reports allow practitioners to share practical advice and\n&gt; warnings to other teams.  The proposal is a short summary of your\n&gt; experience which will result in a paper presentation at the conference.\n&gt;\n&gt; **Discovery Session\n&gt; An opportunity for conference attendees to learn from each other about a\n&gt; relevant topic and share the concrete outcomes after the session. These\n&gt; 90 or 180 minute sessions may take several formats including a think\n&gt; tank, a goldfish bowl or a workshop.\n&gt;\n&gt; **Tutorial\n&gt; An opportunity for an expert to share knowledge with others through a\n&gt; combination of lecture and exercise. Tutorials may be either 90 or 180\n&gt; minutes.\n&gt;\n&gt; **Hands-on session\n&gt; An all-day or multi-day event during which participants are encouraged\n&gt; to drop in and stay from one hour to all day to work hands-on developing\n&gt; software. In past years, hands-on events featured the FIT Fest, which\n&gt; provided opportunities to use FIT and FitNesse.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; YAHOO!
