Essentially, the=\r\n model has\n&gt; a\n&gt;&gt; listener infrastructure and if the user changes the value=\r\n of the class\n&gt;&gt; attribute the appropriate event is supposed to fire. The t=\r\nypical\n&gt;&gt; setter/getter looks like this:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; class MyBean extends Listena=\r\nble {\n&gt;&gt; String value;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; public String getValue() {\n&gt;&gt; return value;\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n }\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; public void setValue(String newValue) {\n&gt;&gt; fireAttributeChangedEve=\r\nnt(&quot;value&quot;, value, newValue);\n&gt;&gt; value =3D newValue;\n&gt;&gt; }\n&gt;&gt; }\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I need=\r\n to test that the setters fire the appropriate event, and that\n&gt; the\n&gt;&gt; eve=\r\nnt attribute name is correct. I want a test harness to essentially\n&gt;&gt; colle=\r\nct all the setters and getters and change the value to ensure\n&gt; that\n&gt;&gt; the=\r\n event is sent as expected. Then I want to run that against all my\n&gt;&gt; domai=\r\nn models.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; My understanding is that I need to generate a suite, and ad=\r\nd the test\n&gt;&gt; instances to that suite. I&#39;ve upgraded to JUnit 4 because I t=\r\nhink it\n&gt; is\n&gt;&gt; designed better. I&#39;m just at a loss as to how to start.
