That\n&gt; said, many testers and test suites (including myself and my suites, and\n&gt; apparently even some of JUnit&#39;s own suites) tend to gravitate toward one\n&gt; test class per tested class. This is a very common pattern, even if it&#39;s\n&gt; one JUnit wasn&#39;t meant to support and one that causes test suites to\n&gt; take longer to run than they otherwise would.\n&gt; \n&gt; This does make me wonder if maybe JUnit has been cutting the wrong way\n&gt; all these years. Perhaps it should be designed to organize tests by\n&gt; model class rather than fixture. This certainly seems a lot more natural\n&gt; to a lot of developers.\n\nWhen a class has common code in two methods, we usually Extract Method.\n\nWhen a class has sets of methods that operate on two different parts of \nthe class&#39; internal state, we usually split the class in two.\n\nWhy wouldn&#39;t we follow those rules with JUnit test case classes? The \nfirst rule extracts common setup code into setUp() and fixture objects. \nThe second splits test case classes that have multiple fixtures into \nseparate test case classes. This leads to test case classes organized \naround fixtures.\n\nAs for one test case per model class, that&#39;s a natural place to start, \nbecause it&#39;s simple, but once that test case class becomes complex, \nrefactor as usual.\n\nTo say that JUnit supports or doesn&#39;t support this way of organizing \ntests sounds odd to me. I don&#39;t organize my tests a certain way; I \nrefactor the tests, and that&#39;s where they tend to end up.\n-- \nJ. B.
