In that case, its enough to know <br/>\nthat your code has called the database appropriately.  You don&#39;t need to <br/>\ncare about what&#39;s in the database.  So you use a Mock Database.  This <br/>\nallows you to *quickly* change your code and make sure it still works <br/>\nwell with a database.<br/>\n<br/>\n+ &quot;Functional&quot; tests test the workings of the full system.  Several <br/>\ntimes, the &quot;Functional&quot; test can be exactly the same as the &quot;Unit&quot; test, <br/>\nthough using the real implementation rather than the Mock <br/>\nimplementation.  This is a pattern I&#39;ve used on occassion.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy typical pattern for an enhancement is:<br/>\n<br/>\n+ Unit test the enhancement, Mock-ing as needed.<br/>\n+ Functional test the enhanced system.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I *HAD* to choose between the two, I&#39;d choose &quot;Unit&quot; tests.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy?<br/>\n<br/>\n+ With only Functional tests, it is much harder to isolate where the <br/>\nproblem is.  Its also very hard to describe a precise enough functional <br/>\ntest to isolate the bug in question and avoid regression issues.<br/>\n+ Performance overhead: It can take time to initialize a database (or <br/>\nHttpConnection or whatever).  So if you can use a Mock, you can reduce <br/>\nthe runtime for non-db specific tests.  In some cases, Compilation can <br/>\nbe much faster if you don&#39;t have to drag in the database-specific <br/>\nimplementation java files either.<br/>\n+ Often, a complete and accurate set of Unit tests will mean functional <br/>\ntests succeed.  Its unusual (though *certainly* not unheard of) for our <br/>\nFunctional tests to fail after all of the Unit tests succeed.  So Unit <br/>\ntests can provide a sort-of-incomplete Functional test.<br/>\n<br/>\nNOTE: This is NOT to say I&#39;d eliminate functional tests; they do provide <br/>\nvalue and find bugs and I&#39;d *STRONGLY* encourage using them.  I&#39;m merely <br/>\nsaying that if I *HAD* to choose....<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nPC<br/>\n<br/>\nPaul Christmann<br/>\nPrior Artisans, LLC<br/>\nmailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:paul@...\">paul@...</a><br/>\n504-587-9072</div>",
