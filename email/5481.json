Of course I can<br/>\nput a main() in MyTestSuite with code similar to *Runner.run(new<br/>\nMyTestSuite()) and that will work! I started looking through the source code<br/>\nof the TextRunner to try to work it out but decided it wasn&#39;t important<br/>\nenough to me at the time. So that&#39;s an exaple of where documentation would<br/>\nhave helped.<br/>\n<br/>\nToby<br/>\n<br/>\nVladimir Bossicard wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; &gt; Where is the documentation that really explains what the various test<br/>\n&gt; &gt; runners do? Where is the javadoc for these classes?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What are you not understanding?  Users don&#39;t need to fully understand<br/>\n&gt; the runners to use them and IMHO that&#39;s the reason why they are not<br/>\n&gt; fully documented.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ll be glad to answer your questions but I need a first, more specific<br/>\n&gt; question to start.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -Vladimir<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; Vladimir Bossicard<br/>\n&gt; www.bossicard.com<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
