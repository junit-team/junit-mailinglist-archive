The first says\ndon&#39;t use \nthem inside the class if they are simple but provide them if necessary to\nthe outside world. \nThe second says always use them inside the class and make them accessable to\nthe outside \nworld on a need-to-know basis. There are advantages to both.\n\nWhat I said was &quot;Don&#39;t provide setter/getter unless a test you are writing\nsays\nyou need them.&quot; For example, if my object gets its values at creation time\nand those\nvalues never change, I don&#39;t need to provide a public setter. For example\nthe File object\ngets a name at creation and provides a getName() method but no setName()\nmethod.\nBut notice that the File object has some setters for attributes that might\nchange\nduring its lifetime such as setReadonly(). \n\nDo the simplest thing possible. Don&#39;t add methods to an object until you\nneed them.\n\n\nErik Husby\nPhase Forward Incorporated\n1440 Main Street\nWaltham, MA 02451-1623 USA \n781-902-4559\nerik.husby@...\n\n\n",
