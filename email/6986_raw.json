I\nwasn&#39;t talking about redundancy in testing, inefficiency, or\nineffectiveness.  I was talking about REAL test cases that test distinct\nbehaviors, effects, and edge cases.  Once that is done, you may BEGIN to\nconsider yourself done.  It&#39;s at that point where you &quot;feel&quot; (notice the\nsubjective term) that you can go on knowing that you have left behind a\ngood enough security system.  When that system is breached, you write a\ntest case to expose it, then fix the code.\n\n:)\n\nOn Tue, 18 Feb 2003 14:18:21 -0800, &quot;Lauren Bish&quot;\n&lt;developerdude@...&gt; said:\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; From: &quot;Jason Rogers&quot; &lt;jacaetevha@...&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;  5. etc. (someone else chime in)\n&gt; \n&gt; Okay, I don&#39;t know what level of testing/QA experience people on this\n&gt; list\n&gt; have, but I assume most members of the list are developers with little\n&gt; real\n&gt; experience. Testing and QA are a somewhat different mindset after all. So\n&gt; excuse me if I come off as somewhat pedantic.\n&gt; \n&gt; First, you can indeed do &quot;too much testing&quot; - or rather you can test\n&gt; ineffectively and inefficiently.\n=jason\n[:question | ^One]\n\n",
