The current interface\nrequires a lot of syntactic &quot;noise&quot;. We&#39;re open to proposals that simplify\nthe API.\n \nAs far as having multiple fixtures in a single class, I don&#39;t see the value\nof moving away from the current model. Users can already apply inheritance\nto factor out common fixturing. It&#39;s true that &quot;one class=one fixture&quot;\nhasn&#39;t been very effectively communicated, but that&#39;s something we can work\non. I&#39;d like to see sets of real concrete tests that would be made simpler\nby allowing different parameters for different tests in the same class.\n \nOverall, I think what we have here is one of those design decisions that can\nreasonably go either way, depending on the underlying values of the project\ndevelopers. We&#39;ve always chosen simplicity of the API over flexibility if\nthe two are in conflict. Other projects have other values and decide\ndifferently.\n \nRegards,\n \nKent Beck\nThree Rivers Institute\n\n  _____  \n\nFrom: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of\nMalte Finsterwalder\nSent: Monday, July 14, 2008 2:01 AM\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: Re: [junit] Parameterized Tests, a proposal\n\n\n\nHi Kent,\n\nKent Beck wrote:\n&gt; I agree that the current arrangement for parameterized tests is clunky.\n\nDo you have other ideas about how to improve it?\n\n&gt; However, the solution you propose--different tests in the same class being\n&gt; parameterized by different (or even no) data, contradicts a fundamental\n&gt; element of JUnit&#39;s design: one class/one fixture.\n&gt;\n&gt; Your proposal is akin, it\n&gt; seems to me, to having different tests in the same class use different\nsets\n&gt; of @Befores. You could do that using a similar syntax to that outlined\n&gt; below, but it would make it harder to read tests declaratively. With the\n&gt; current design, if I want to know what data a test will have available, I\n&gt; read the @Befores (and @Parameters). Then I can read all the tests\nassuming\n&gt; those are the conditions under which it will execute. If I have a\ndiffferent\n&gt; fixture, I go to a different class.\n&gt; \n&gt; Can you tell me a little more about what benefits you see from your\nproposed\n&gt; arrangement and in which circumstances it would be superior to having\ntests\n&gt; with different fixtures in different classes?\n\nI don&#39;t think that the parameterization and the test fixture are the same.\n\nAnd I think it&#39;s normal to have part of my test fixture shared in a \nBefore-Method. And then I extend (or modify) this setup slightly inside \nmy different test methods.\n\nI want to do some tests with a customer object, for example how the \ncustomer responds to billing differnt items to his account.\nSome of theses tests can be parameterized, some can&#39;t.\n\ne.g. I want to write a test that billing &quot;null&quot; is not allowed and \nthrows an exception. This test is not parameterized.\nThen I want to bill different goods and I want to see, that the customer \nresponds correctly by say calculating a correct bonus, according to his \nstate. To check this, I need to bill 10 different goods, cause some of \nthem have a bonus, some don&#39;t, etc.\nThese 10 tests can be parameterized with a good to bill and the \nresulting bonus. They still use the same fixture, namely the customer \nobject.\n\nI would like all these tests in the same class, since they use the same \nfixture and test a coherent set of functionality.\n\nDoes that make more sense now?\n\nBTW: I learned, that testNG uses an approach like the one I proposed.\nAns reading up on Theries, I noticed, that they have a somewhat similar \napproach as well.\n\nRegard,\nMalte\n\n&gt; From: junit@yahoogroups. &lt;mailto:junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt; com\n&lt;mailto:junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt; \n&gt; [mailto:junit@yahoogroups. &lt;mailto:junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt; com\n&lt;mailto:junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt;] On Behalf Of\n&gt; Malte Finsterwalder\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, July 09, 2008 12:01 AM\n&gt; To: junit YahooGroup\n&gt; Subject: [junit] Parameterized Tests, a proposal\n&gt; \n&gt; Hi,\n&gt; \n&gt; I just got around to looking into parameterized tests a little more.\n&gt; But it confirmed the impression I got when they came out with JUnit 4.\n&gt; They are sooo clunky, that I rather write a test that calls a\n&gt; helper-method with parameters instead.\n&gt; \n&gt; But this time I had time to ask myself: Why is it so clunky?\n&gt; In what way could it be better.\n&gt; \n&gt; So I came up with an idea, how I would like it to be.\n&gt; And here is an example:\n&gt; \n&gt; @RunWith(Parameterized.class)\n&gt; public class MyParameterizedTest {\n&gt; \n&gt; private Object[] data = new Object[][] {\n&gt; {&quot;param1&quot;, 2, 3},\n&gt; {&quot;other&quot;, 5, 99},\n&gt; {&quot;more&quot;, 234, 5875727343}\n&gt; };\n&gt; \n&gt; // The parameter given as &quot;data&quot; here, specifies that\n&gt; // attribute, that contains the parameters for the test\n&gt; @ParameterizedTest(&quot;data&quot;)\n&gt; public void testWhatever(String str, int i, long j) {\n&gt; // This method gets called 3 times\n&gt; // once for each line in the above Object[]\n&gt; \n&gt; // do whatever here\n&gt; }\n&gt; \n&gt; @Test\n&gt; public void plainNonParameterizedTest() {\n&gt; // this is a normal unit test that is\n&gt; // called just once\n&gt; }\n&gt; }\n&gt; \n&gt; I think it&#39;s a lot easier this way.\n&gt; It allows mixing of parameterized tests and non parameterized tests, if\n&gt; you like.\n&gt; I allows for several parameterized tests in a single class.\n&gt; And I don&#39;t see disadvantages.\n&gt; \n&gt; It could be even simpler, if it were incorporated into the existing\n&gt; JUnit Test-annotation, like so:\n&gt; \n&gt; // no @RunWith-Annotation here\n&gt; public class MyParameterizedTest {\n&gt; \n&gt; private Object[] data = new Object[][] {\n&gt; {&quot;param1&quot;, 2, 3},\n&gt; {&quot;other&quot;, 5, 99},\n&gt; {&quot;more&quot;, 234, 5875727343}\n&gt; };\n&gt; \n&gt; // The parameter given as &quot;data&quot; here, specifies that\n&gt; // attribute, that contains the parameters for the test\n&gt; // Use of standard Test-annotation with a new parameter\n&gt; @Test(parameterized=&quot;data&quot;)\n&gt; public void testWhatever(String str, int i, long j) {\n&gt; // This method gets called 3 times\n&gt; // once for each line in the above Object[]\n&gt; \n&gt; // do whatever here\n&gt; }\n&gt; }\n&gt; \n&gt; What do you think?\n&gt; \n&gt; I already tried to implement the first version, since it&#39;s non\n&gt; intrusive, but looking into extending JUnit, I found that it&#39;s a pain in\n&gt; the behind, if you don&#39;t want to extends internals-stuff.\n&gt; But maybe I&#39;m just misunderstanding or missing things.\n&gt; But that&#39;s another story for another post... shortly...\n&gt; \n&gt; Greetings,\n&gt; Malte\n\n\n\n \n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
