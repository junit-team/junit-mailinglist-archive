I just want that doYourOneTimeSetup() would be run once<br/>\n&gt; &gt; for ANY suite that run. doYourOneTimeSetup() will startup<br/>\n&gt; &gt; microcontainer. Parameters to it doesn&#39;t changdes.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Can you define doYourOneTimeSetup in a superclass of the suites, and<br/>\n&gt; have all of your suites inherit from it?<br/>\nI don&#39;t actually understand your question. Do you mean to define some<br/>\nBaseEJBTest class with <br/>\n<br/>\n@BeforeClass<br/>\npublic static void setUpClass();<br/>\n?<br/>\n<br/>\nAll test classes will inherit from this class. In this cases, however,<br/>\nBaseEJBTest.setUpClass() will be called for all test class in the<br/>\nsuite. This is actually what I did. There is work-around, namely, to<br/>\nuse Bootstrap.getInstance().isStarted() to determine whether this is<br/>\nfirst call to this method or not. <br/>\nPerhaps, you meant to use something like this<br/>\n&gt; @RunWith(Suite.class)<br/>\n&gt; @SuiteClasses(A.class, B.class)<br/>\n&gt; public class MySuite {<br/>\n&gt; @BeforeClass public static void doYourOneTimeSetup() {}<br/>\n&gt; @AfterClass public static void doYourOneTimeTeardown() {}<br/>\n&gt; }<br/>\n?<br/>\nFirst of all, until recently I wasn&#39;t aware of this opportunity.<br/>\nSecond of all, it is quite verbose and not very flexible.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Choosing individual methods to run<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; from the command line or Eclipse is fairly simple, but mixing and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; matching methods from multiple classes takes a fair amount of magic.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Do you find yourself wanting to do this often? (I usually am either<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; running a whole suite, one class in the suite, or one method).<br/>\n&gt; &gt; When I write some code or fix the bug I usually want to run some<br/>\n&gt; &gt; subgroup of the test suite. I should split up my suite to the smaller<br/>\n&gt; &gt; one, I know, but I couldn&#39;t to do it easily and, in fact, architecture<br/>\n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t want to do it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So the suite that you want to run often involves one method, but not<br/>\n&gt; all, from class A, and one method, but not all, from class B?  I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; sorry to ask the same question again, but I couldn&#39;t parse your answer<br/>\n&gt; (not enough coffee yet).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\nUsually I want to run 2,3 or 10 method from some class A. Typical use<br/>\ncase is the following (after I finished to write unit test and I want<br/>\nto refactor the code&#92;improve the code&#92;find bug in production). <br/>\n1. Run all test classes that cover the method to change. Usually it is<br/>\n one class (this has a drawback to have huge test classes).<br/>\n2. Figure out what test method has failed (after I made a change, I am<br/>\nnot describing a process of refactoring in detail here). Usually all<br/>\nthese methods belongs to one familiar that under normal circumstances<br/>\nwill be in different class. <br/>\n3. Rerun only those methods.<br/>\n4. Make a change to test method&#92;method and rerun those methods, test<br/>\nmethods that failed, one particular test method, based on what is best<br/>\nfeet in this case. <br/>\n<br/>\nI hope this helps. </span></blockquote></div>",
