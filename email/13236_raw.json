Some\n&gt; test cases are run at the parent level and some are run at\n&gt; the child level.  My observation is this. When I run my child\n&gt; test cases it traverses to the parent and runs the parent&#39;s\n&gt; tests also.  My question is this..\n&gt; \n&gt; #1. Can I stop my derived Unit tests from running parent\n&gt; tests.?\n\nIf you don&#39;t want to rerun the tests from the parent class, I assume that\nyou are reusing some other code from it?\n\nWhat if you simply moved that code to a common (abstract) base class and\ndon&#39;t any longer let the child class inherit from the parent class (but let\nboth inherit from the abstract base class)?\n\nCheers, Ilja\n\n\n\n---------------------------------\nYahoo!
