Until we can measure that <br/>\nsomewhat objectively, neither one of us can say more than &quot;I don&#39;t agree <br/>\nwith him&quot;. As long as we agree not to say, &quot;He&#39;s wrong; what an idiot!&quot; <br/>\nthen I&#39;ll be very happy. So far, he doesn&#39;t appear to have called me <br/>\nwrong or an idiot, and I certainly haven&#39;t done that to him.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m intrigued by extreme heuristics like &quot;all code should be either <br/>\ntested or deleted&quot;. I suppose I should try that on a project and see <br/>\nwhat happens. Maybe I&#39;ll be pleasantly surprised.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
