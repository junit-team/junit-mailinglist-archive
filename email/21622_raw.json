Because i&#39;m a little confused right now. I need to us=\r\ne URLClassLoader to load classes from projects I want my plugin to monitor =\r\n(or is there by any chance much better way i didn&#39;t think of?) - the first =\r\nURL in the constructor points at monitored project output directory. But wi=\r\nthout the second URL classes were loaded without @Test annotations. While d=\r\nebugging i discovered exception \n\ncom.sun.jdi.ClassNotLoadedException: Type=\r\n has not been loaded occurred while retrieving component type of array. \n\nw=\r\nhile trying to preview method&#39;s annotations. So i added another URL which p=\r\noints at JUnit jar from Eclipse. Annotations appeared but i&#39;m not 100% sure=\r\n why it worked.\n\nHowever,  I just run some tests and it seems, that:\n\nclazz=\r\nLoader.loadClass(&quot;org.junit.Test&quot;).equals(Test.class)\n\nevaluates to false..=\r\n. I don&#39;t know what to do - is there any way i could decorate JUnitCore wit=\r\nh my URLClassLoader? Because as far as i know (and i&#39;ve spent some time goo=\r\ngling for it) using URLClassLoader is the only sensible way to dynamically =\r\nload classes from class files...  \n\nThanks for your reply Gilles and once a=\r\ngain, i&#39;d be very grateful for any more help.\n\nBest regards,\nMichal Olejnik=\r\n\n\nPS. Forgive me if my english is bad, but i&#39;ve been fighting with this for=\r\n whole day and i&#39;m just too tired to pay much attention to grammar and spel=\r\nling. However i hope what i wrote is not very hard to understand\n\n--- In ju=\r\nnit@yahoogroups.com, Gilles Scokart &lt;gscokart@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Is the @Test =\r\nreferenced by the unit test and the @Test used by the runner\n&gt; coming from =\r\nthe same classloader ?  If not, they are different annotations.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Gil=\r\nles Scokart\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; 2009/5/16 blekit@... &lt;blekit@...&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hello,=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; i&#39;m currently writing a plugin which is supposed to launch JUnit4 =\r\nTests\n&gt; &gt; after each save. So far i&#39;m only loading every class that is chan=\r\nged using\n&gt; &gt; IResourceChangedListener and URLClassLoader:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; URLClass=\r\nLoader classLoader =3D new URLClassLoader(new URL[]\n&gt; &gt; {outputDirectory.to=\r\nURL(), new\n&gt; &gt; URL(&quot;file:/D:/eclipse/plugins/org.junit4_4.3.1/junit.jar&quot;) }=\r\n);\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Class&lt;?&gt; clazz =3D classLoader.loadClass(fileName);\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; At t=\r\nhis point everything looks great - when i modify JUnit4 test class it\n&gt; &gt; g=\r\nets loaded with annotations on proper methods (thanks to second URL -\n&gt; &gt; w=\r\nithout it no annotation was loaded, and to be honest i don&#39;t know why).\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n However, things start to go wrong when i pass the loaded class to\n&gt; &gt; JUni=\r\ntCore.run method - the result i always get says that there was &quot;No\n&gt; &gt; runn=\r\nable method&quot; exception even though there are clearly some method\n&gt; &gt; annota=\r\nded with @Test...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I have little experience in writing plugins for E=\r\nclipse, so i&#39;m kind of\n&gt; &gt; lost now... I may suspect, that the problem is w=\r\nith not sufficient classpath\n&gt; &gt; (cause it seems that it was a reason why i=\r\n had to add another URL to class\n&gt; &gt; loader) of my plugin. So i&#39;m asking if=\r\n anyone ever tried to dynamically load\n&gt; &gt; test classes from Eclipse plugin=\r\n and run them using JUnitCore - if so, I&#39;d\n&gt; &gt; be very grateful for helping=\r\n me out with this problem.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks in advance.\n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Michal Olejnik\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message ha=\r\nve been removed]\n&gt;\n\n\n\n",
