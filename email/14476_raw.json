Where have\n&gt;  &gt; you been working?! :)\n&gt; \n&gt; This is the documented and required behavior of all Throwable objects in\n&gt; Java 1.4 and later. I&#39;m just trying to duplicate that in Java 1.3 and\n&gt; earlier.If you consult the source code for java.lang.Throwable you&#39;ll\n&gt; see something similar. I told you this was tricky. :-)\n\nIncidentally, I just learned that, by default, an exception /is/ its own \ncause in JDK 1.4, so are you sure you want to stop people from doing that?\n\n&gt; By the way one place where exception objects do get assigned to\n&gt; variables is in a SAX parser, where an exception would need to be passed\n&gt; to an ErrorHandler, which then has the choice of whether to throw the\n&gt; exception or not.\n\nThis I understand. I guess I&#39;ve just never seen that level of \nsophistication in exception classes before. It looks like unnecessary \ncomplexity to me, but then I don&#39;t understand the problems you&#39;re trying \nto solve. I&#39;m sure that if you explained it to me over beer, I would see \nit differently. :)\n\nTake care.\n-- \nJ. B.
