It would seem you gain the same power by allowing any Class&lt;?&gt;. The advantage of doing this is it would allow real classes within the project to act as Categories, so that if, for example, I am testing a DAO framework, I can categorize individual tests with the specific DAO subclass they are targeting, and then run a category based on the DAO supertype. Much nicer than just calling it all SlowTests. In practice that won&#39;t happen often if a custom interface is required because it will introduce a dependency on a JUnit type in the production code.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Huh.  The first time through, I thought &quot;that&#39;s ridiculous&quot;.  The<br/>\nsecond time, I wondered if there&#39;s not something to this...<br/>\n<br/>\nTotally musing out loud, but you could rename the annotation as<br/>\nTestOf, so that you&#39;d have<br/>\n<br/>\n@TestOf(CustomStreamingPlatform.class)<br/>\n<br/>\nHmm...<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;m also curious if you considered using an annotation as the category? That is having the category take a Class&lt;?&gt; that represents an annotation? You could support meta-annotations to allow a hierarchy of categories as well as supporting any subclasses or implementations of types so annotated. Coding for that would be nasty business, but it wouldn&#39;t be complicated from a client point of view, and would allow the same flexibility of inheritance without the dependency on a JUnit type.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I wanted to stay away from meta-annotations unless the reasons were<br/>\n_really_ compelling.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I would prefer just an arbitrary Class&lt;?&gt;, though. Inheritance is well understood by any Java programmer (unlike meta-annotations) and opens up a synergy between the category hierarchy and the code hierarchy.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Can I get another vote on this extension idea?<br/>\n<br/>\n   David</div>",
