I find they\n rarely run the tests that are there, often check in\n code that breaks the tests (but not the build), and\n they very frequently add new code that&#39;s untested.\n\nI have found myself in this situation more often than I would like.  Up to\nnow, I have found the best thing to do is wait for someone to check in a\nfailing test.  Once the test fails, I invest some time determining why.\nNormally, I find that:\n\na) Object behavior has changed, and certain corner cases the developer\ndidn&#39;t manually test for arenow failing.  This is an excellent opportunity\nto bring the failure to the developer in question and let them know.  When\nthey ask how you found out so quickly, you can demonstrate the value of the\ntests.\n\nb) Something trivial has changed - for example a toString() method now\nreturns something different.  This is usually an indication of a test that\nis too dependent upon the implementation and is fragile.  This is an\nexellent learning opportunity for yourself - what is the test really\ntesting?  How can it be rewritten so that these trivial changes won&#39;t cause\nproblems?\n\nc) Something about the design has changed - instead of injecting a\ncollaborator the code now creates one.  I&#39;ve had the most trouble with these\nfailures.  If the people writing the code don&#39;t value tests, and don&#39;t\nunderstand the value of dependency injection outside of tests, it can\nquickly turn negative.  I tend to clean these up quietly and promote\nDependency Injection as a best practice when the team talks about design.\nI&#39;m sure there are better ways to handle it - I&#39;d love to hear some from the\npeople on the list.\n\nMy personal advice is to keep unit testing.  It can be extremely frustrating\n&quot;playing catchup&quot;, however you can&#39;t beat that rewarding feeling when other\ndevelopers on your team starts promoting them too.\n\nCheers!\nCarl\n\n\n\n-- \nhttp://genomescampaigns.blogspot.com\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
