You will probably\nfind these somewhere online (because I am pretty sure somebody with more\nwritting skills have already published it). So, I will just say that my\npersonal ranking is EasyMock 2.x (clean API, clean design, legibility, but\nit works only on VM &gt;= 1.5), EasyMock 1.x (not so clean API, still clean\ndesign, legibility), JMock 1.x and JMock 2.x (this one is imo a mess: they\nmoved from string-based method invocation to more static approach, but they\nhave completely screwed the API). However, as I said, this is my personal\nopinion :-).\n\nbests,\n\n./alex\n--\n.w( the_mindstorm )p.\n  TestNG co-founder\nEclipseTestNG Creator\n\n\nOn 5/2/07, James Abley &lt;james.abley@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;   Hi all,\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m looking to use a Mock framework. I was using a home-grown one with\n&gt; a previous employer, but that isn&#39;t (yet - I&#39;m hopeful!) open-sourced\n&gt; / externally available, so I need to make a jump to another one.\n&gt;\n&gt; I tried EasyMock (1.x) after reading JB&#39;s book a couple of years back\n&gt; - I think the state of the art has moved on somewhat since then.\n&gt;\n&gt; The closed framework that I used previously seems pretty similar in\n&gt; terms of look and feel to rMock 2.0 and JMock 2.0, but I&#39;m open to\n&gt; other suggestions.\n&gt;\n&gt; What experiences to people have to share?\n&gt;\n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt;\n&gt; James\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
