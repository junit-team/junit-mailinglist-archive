The place where people mess up is when they reflexively assume that particular numbers indicate problems and that there is some sort of moral imperative to confront all perceived problems.  The fact is, there is no linkage there other than what we bring to the table.  People and teams have natural rhythms and we have to take care when we decide what to optimize. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe fact that people are less productive on one particular day out of the week would not surprise me.  If someone told me that a team was uniformly productive every day of the week, I&#39;d actually be rather scared of what I might find if I was to visit them.<br/>\n<br/>\nMichael<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: Mike Hill &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mike@...\">mike@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Sent: Jun 10, 2008 11:39 AM<br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: A Note On Data-Gathering (Was Re: [junit] A case for adding logging of assertions to junit)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;On Tue, Jun 10, 2008 at 10:07 AM, Kent Beck &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kentb@...\">kentb@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;&gt; This is what DevCreek (www.devcreek.com) does, and the results are often<br/>\n&gt;&gt; surprising. For example, we noticed that on Wednesdays the DevCreek team<br/>\n&gt;&gt; itself wrote a quarter of the tests it wrote on other days. Turns out they<br/>\n&gt;&gt; were spending most of the day preparing for the weekly status meeting.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;So.  Side topic, and favorite horse-floggee of mine:  did the metric<br/>\n&gt;do anything for us that simply knowing the team well wouldn&#39;t have<br/>\n&gt;already done?  I&#39;m assuming, here, dangerous habit, that there was no<br/>\n&gt;team-perceived process-weakness on Wednesdays prior to the metric.  If<br/>\n&gt;that&#39;s a valid assumption, dangerous habit admitted, then this would<br/>\n&gt;seem to be a case where a metric -- not free -- gave us a false<br/>\n&gt;positive -- not free -- requiring at least a little bit of<br/>\n&gt;investigation to determine root cause -- not free.  Metrics are<br/>\n&gt;scarily complex to me, and I wish my world had either fewer of them,<br/>\n&gt;or fewer people relying on them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Teams<br/>\n&gt;&gt; using DevCreek don&#39;t seem to change their behavior much on the basis of the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; feedback, though, which I find surprising. Perhaps the feedback isn&#39;t really<br/>\n&gt;&gt; all that useful, perhaps we don&#39;t have the right presentation of the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; information, or perhaps people just need to get used to the idea that the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; information is there for them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Or, another favorite equine victim of mine, perhaps people are<br/>\n&gt;decidedly less rational than we routinely realize.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Of course, once having typed this in, I immediately jump to another<br/>\n&gt;way of seeing it:  put scare quotes around &#39;rational&#39;.  To make this<br/>\n&gt;second idea more clear, I&#39;ll say I might have theorized that the team<br/>\n&gt;would respond (incorrectly) by &#39;rationally&#39; honoring feedback that<br/>\n&gt;didn&#39;t meet its -- what words to use here? -- gestalt self-image.  In<br/>\n&gt;fact, the team responded (correctly) by &#39;irrationally&#39; ignoring<br/>\n&gt;feedback that didn&#39;t meet that gestalt self-image.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;A third way in to the puzzle:  information is not useful until it is<br/>\n&gt;integrated into a framework of meaning.  At any given time, any such<br/>\n&gt;framework has a loose boundary (the so-called hermeneutic horizon),<br/>\n&gt;which represents the only possible locations where new information can<br/>\n&gt;be fit.  If the boundary is not situated where the new information can<br/>\n&gt;be fit in, it will be ignored, hence useless.  So it pays to focus<br/>\n&gt;one&#39;s attention not just on generating data, but on generating the<br/>\n&gt;data that will fit the current boundary for the current group and<br/>\n&gt;enable that group to become what it wants.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;This is why I am so negative about quests for ever-more-detailed<br/>\n&gt;metrics, or one-size-fits-all approaches to measuring progress in<br/>\n&gt;human enterprise.  Down this road lies Taylor, and a reversion of some<br/>\n&gt;particularly hard won 20th century knowledge.  When someone posts<br/>\n&gt;about &quot;what metric is best?&quot;, I wish we could all post back &quot;the one<br/>\n&gt;that helps your team&quot;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;m reminded of a magnificent insight granted to me by Jerome Bruner,<br/>\n&gt;who somewhere remarks that the purpose of therapy is not to reveal the<br/>\n&gt;truth, but to construct a story which enables the patient to move<br/>\n&gt;towards his or her goal.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Cheers,<br/>\n&gt;Hill<br/>\n&gt;Wanna learn XP skills the hard way?
