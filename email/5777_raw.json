Let me see if I can \n=\r\nclarify a bit about the @pre tag.  When Jtest automatically generates \ntest=\r\n cases for a method, it will read this tag and not generate any \ninput whic=\r\nh specifically violates the defined pre-condition.  If an \n@post tag is pre=\r\nsent, Jtest will try to generate inputs which would \nadhere to the @pre con=\r\ndition, but intentionally try to break the \n@post condition.  If the @post =\r\ncondition were able to be violated, \nthis would indicate a serious flaw in =\r\nthe code.\n\nAlso, Jtest can report a @pre violation if the method with the @=\r\npre \ntag is called by another method and that @pre condition is violated.\nF=\r\nor example, let&#39;s say you have method A which calls method B.  \nMethod B ha=\r\ns some @pre defined and Jtest generates a test for method \nA which calls me=\r\nthod B in such a manner which violates method B&#39;s \n@pre condition.  Here, J=\r\ntest would report a @pre violation.\n\nThese particular features are related =\r\nto DBC.  The above is just a \nsmall subset of what ParaSoft&#39;s tools can do =\r\nin relation to DBC.  If \nyou want more info on DBC, you can go to \nhttp://w=\r\nww.parasoft.com/jsp/products/article.jsp?\narticleId=3D579&product=3DJcontra=\r\nct\n\nRegards,\nDavid McCaw\n\n\n\n--- In junit@y..., Ilja Preu=DF &lt;ilja.preuss@w.=\r\n..&gt; wrote:\n&gt; What exactly does the @pre tag do?

One can use an @pre tag in j=\r\navadoc to find such \n&gt; &gt; &gt; problems.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Carson\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- I=\r\nn junit@y..., Ilja Preu=DF &lt;ilja.preuss@w...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The problem =\r\nis that I don&#39;t know if there was a problem with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the input, the p=\r\nrocessing or something random. If your code\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; returns an IllegalArg=\r\numentException, then I have a much\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; better idea of the issues.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you are on the same team, you could ask him. Possibly you\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; could \n&gt; &gt; &gt; even\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; find out by simply looking at the code and/or=\r\n the JUnit tests.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One point I find more critical is that i=\r\nnvalid input should be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fail-fast. If a method fails because you pro=\r\nvided invalid \ninput\n&gt; &gt; to a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; prior method call, such problems are =\r\nreally hard to find. Can\n&gt; &gt; JTest \n&gt; &gt; &gt; help\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with such issues?\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Regards, Ilja\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; To unsubscribe from th=\r\nis group, send an email to:\n&gt; &gt; junit-unsubscribe@y...\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Your =\r\nuse of Yahoo!
