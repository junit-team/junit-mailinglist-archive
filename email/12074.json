I know this is a rather broad question but I was<br/>\n&gt; just wondering if you found it to be an effective tool when used in<br/>\n&gt; conjunction with BV or if it requires a rather long and involved<br/>\n&gt; process of setting it up and getting broadvision to interact with<br/>\n&gt; junit?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>JUnit /can/ be used to test anything that is Java, it can even be used to  <br/>\ntest non-Java apps.  The proof of whether or not it is suited to a  <br/>\nparticular need is an exercise left to the reader.  You are correct that  <br/>\nyour question is very broad.  A better answer may come if you take the  <br/>\ntime to define your needs to us.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJason Rogers<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I,<br/>\nbut Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in<br/>\nthe flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved<br/>\nme, and gave himself for me.&quot;<br/>\n     Galatians 2:20</div>",
