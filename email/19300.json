If a second suite of <br/>\ntests later require the same code, consider a utility class at that <br/>\nstage - with its own tests, of course. ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\nStephen Smith, MEng (Wales).<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.stephen-smith.co.uk/\">http://www.stephen-smith.co.uk/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nScott Glaser wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have a question about designing JUnit tests. I have some common setup and<br/>\n&gt; teardown tasks that are shared amongst several test classes. For example I<br/>\n&gt; read test data from an xml file used by each test class that contains global<br/>\n&gt; information like Locale and Timezone. Another is removing test data from the<br/>\n&gt; db. These are not tasks I want to do once per test class but once per test<br/>\n&gt; method in several test classes. I would think it makes more sense to pull<br/>\n&gt; out these common tasks from each test class and either put them in a<br/>\n&gt; utility/helper class or create a base test class that each test class will<br/>\n&gt; inherit. The dilemma I have is which approach is better. Creating a utility<br/>\n&gt; class or creating a base test class that is inherited. The common tasks are<br/>\n&gt; not package specific, meaning they are not targeting a specific suite of<br/>\n&gt; test classes so my initial thought is to create a utility class for these<br/>\n&gt; common tasks to reside. This may seem to be more of a general java design<br/>\n&gt; question but was hoping someone can give me some pointers.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks,<br/>\n&gt; Scott<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; No virus found in this incoming message.<br/>\n&gt; Checked by AVG Free Edition. <br/>\n&gt; Version: 7.5.463 / Virus Database: 269.6.1/776 - Release Date: 25/04/2007 12:19 </span></blockquote></div>",
