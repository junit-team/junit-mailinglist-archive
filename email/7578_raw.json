B. Rainsberger&quot; &lt;jbrains@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Two things.\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. Think about how to change your design so that your test doesn&#39;t need to\n&gt; read/write CSV files. This is the better option of the two I offer you.\n&gt; 2. If you really can&#39;t do (1), then look at TestSetup for information about\n&gt; one-time setup.\n&gt; \n&gt; Good luck.\n&gt; \n&gt; So said jakespigl3 on 4/7/2003 --------------------\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt; \n&gt; Being new to junit and the world of unit testing, how do I eliminate\n&gt; part of the setup from being torn down and setup again for each test?\n&gt; It seems like a bit of  a waste of time.\n&gt; \n&gt; The part of the setup I am talking about is writing a csv file for the\n&gt; purposes of getting the class under test to read it. There will be a\n&gt; test case to write a report  too - based on the contents of the file.\n&gt; There will only be one test case to test the read functionality.\n&gt; \n&gt; How do should I proceed?\n&gt; \n&gt; regards\n&gt; jfc\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
