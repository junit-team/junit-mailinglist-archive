How will you \ntest &quot;procedures&quot; that do work instead?\n(It is &#39;against the rules&#39; to change the design of them to return \nvalues - a testing tool should not force code changes.)\n2) How will you test procedures that are composed of several \nfunctions?\n3) Can JUnit ever replace stepping thru with a debugger?\n\nthanks,\nAnil\naphili01@...\n\n\n\n",
