I would like to figure out a mechenism to \nmake the\n&gt; testcase automatically run 3 time with difference DB connection \nsetUp().\n&gt; \n&gt; Currently every testcase already inherienced from a common base \nclass\n&gt; call Databasetestcase which setup and teardown the connection. Can I\n&gt; make some trick to this class to make it happen, rather than make a\n&gt; custom patch of junit?\n\n\n\n",
