However, as the system starts  <br/>\n&gt; to get complicated those simple constructors sometimes become  <br/>\n&gt; complications because of the need to have mocks for unit tests. Later  <br/>\n&gt; they become even greater complications because of the need to break  <br/>\n&gt; or invert dependencies between modules.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>At such point as that becomes a real problem, I&#39;m willing to refactor to <br/>\naccomplish this. However in my experience most classes are not reused, <br/>\nmost do not need to be mocked, most do not need to be decoupled, and <br/>\nvery few classes need multiple implementations.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy objection is not to using these techniques in the rare cases where <br/>\nit&#39;s actually necessary. My objection is to starting by assuming that <br/>\nthe simplest thing (concrete classes with constructors) can&#39;t possibly <br/>\nwork, and jumping straight into the deep end every time.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you need it, fine; but more likely than not you don&#39;t. YAGNI isn&#39;t <br/>\njust about features. It&#39;s also about programming techniques. Additional <br/>\nlayers of indirection are powerful problem solvers; but they are also <br/>\npowerful obfuscators. They should not be introduced gratuitously just <br/>\nbecause they might be useful to someone some day.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n﻿Elliotte Rusty Harold  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:elharo@...\">elharo@...</a><br/>\nJava I/O 2nd Edition Just Published!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafeaulait.org/books/javaio2/\">http://www.cafeaulait.org/books/javaio2/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596527500/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/\">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596527500/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/</a></div>",
