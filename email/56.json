Does anyone know why <br/>\n&gt; (time, philosophy,<br/>\n&gt; etc ) ?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My guess would be philosophy. (That DOES sound like a song title, doesn&#39;t<br/>\nit? :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you can only test your class by testing the output it generates on a<br/>\nfilesystem, its design could be improved. It should probably take an<br/>\nOutputStream and write there. You can then compare the contents of the<br/>\nOutputStream to your expected result.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s all about keeping implementation details out of the public interface. A<br/>\nfile representation is an implementation detail - a stream is not. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the benefits you reap if you implement your classes that way is that<br/>\nyou can add MD5 checksums, compression, etc without any redesign. If your<br/>\nclass is writing directly to a file, you would have to modify that class to<br/>\nachieve the same.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, that&#39;s only a guess - I could be completely off :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; One of the most common situations for me in testing tools is <br/>\n&gt; the need to<br/>\n&gt; test a given file output against a canonical output file.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That is definitely true for acceptance tests. Unit tests should not pose<br/>\nthat problem.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBye,<br/>\n  Robert</div>",
