Mr problems specifically were that when I tried to \nrun the test code supplied with JUnit, I got IO exceptions to do with \nCreateProcess. \n\nI posted details of my problems to the MS Java-COM mailing list. Don \nMcCaughey used to have the same problems and had managed to find the \ncause and the solution. I am cross posting his message here (he has \ngiven me the ok to do this) so that any other Visual J++ users who \nrun into the same issues will be able to find the answer here, too.\n\nDon&#39;s message:\n\nIf you check the source code for the test fixture that&#39;s failing\n(junit.tests.TextRunnerTest), notice that it attempts to build the \npath to java.exe (Sun&#39;s equivalent of jview.exe) in order to run a \nclass in another process using Runtime.exec().  Microsoft&#39;s Java is \norganized differently so this fails.  It also fails under \njunit.awtui.TestRunner and junit.swingui.TestRunner won&#39;t work at all \nsince VJ++ doesn&#39;t have the Swing libraries.  All the other tests ran \nso you&#39;re in good shape.\n\n-Don\n\nSure enough, I modified the test code to use the &quot;JView&quot; command \ninstead of &quot;java&quot; and everything works perfectly.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nRegards,\n\nKrishna\n\n\n",
