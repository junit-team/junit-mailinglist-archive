I have a couple of questions  <br/>\nregarding your suggestions:<br/>\n<br/>\nCéderic and Wayne: TestNG: how mature / well used is this compared to  <br/>\nJUnit? I&#39;ve been using JUnit in a few projects before and see that  <br/>\nlots of people use it. I&#39;ve heared about TestNG before and when  <br/>\nresearching my ignore problems I saw it and thought that its  <br/>\ndifferent parameters for @Test looked intriguing. Does JUnit do stuff  <br/>\nthat TestNG doesn&#39;t that I should know that I&#39;m sacrificing should I  <br/>\nswitch to TestNG?<br/>\n<br/>\nContinuum 1.0.3 is considered a preview release from its  <br/>\ndocumentation and was released a year ago. This tells me that it is  <br/>\nnot stable and well-tried and probably hasn&#39;t a big community  <br/>\nsubmitting bugs and coming with feature requests. This of course is  <br/>\ncountered by 79 commits last month. :-) What is the state of Continuum?<br/>\n<br/>\nHow do CruiseControl, Continuum and Anthill compare to one-another?  <br/>\nThanks Wayne for these pointers, it all looks like a much better deal  <br/>\nthan Cron. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<br/>\n<br/>\n\tNik</div>",
