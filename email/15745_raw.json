So, how do \nyou \nthink I can implement my requirements with this tool?\n\n--Klaus\n\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;kamal2222ahmed&quot; &lt;Kamal.Ahmed@w...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In junit@yahoogroups.com, jason r tibbetts &lt;tibbettj@v...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; sachin.dholakia@t... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Klaus,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; There is a tool namely QALAB which is used to pick info from \nXML\n&gt; files and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; generate so called Movers and Shakers of build.

I imagine that you could probably \nwrite \n&gt; &gt; &gt; something to do this yourself as quickly as extracting the\n&gt; interesting \n&gt; &gt; &gt; parts from my code.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Can you give a few details about what you would be looking for \nin a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; trend analysis?  Thanks,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;     David Saff\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; kp.berg wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;Hi all,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;I know, JUnit &#39;unit&#39; tests should always pass ;-) But we are \nusing the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;JUnit framework to write integration and systemtests as well. \nSo from\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;time to time, in this area something may go wrong. Therefore \nI&#39;m\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;looking for a tool, that generates a report showing only the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;differences between current and last JUnit report - which \nfailing\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;tests were fixed, which tests stopped to pass, which tests \nwere added\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;and which removed. Additionaly a test trend analysis should be\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;possible.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;I know, parsing the XML junitreport output and generating the \ninfo,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;e.g., with the help of a database, would be possible. But is \nanyone\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;aware of an existing tool or open source project that can help \nin this\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;direction?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Is there such a tool for eclipse/perforce?\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSPONSORED LINKS \nBasic programming language \nC programming language \nComputer programming languages \nThe c programming language \nC programming language \nList of programming languages \n\nYAHOO!
