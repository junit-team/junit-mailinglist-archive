Does the result of <br/>\nyour big method vary at all or is it dependent  solely on the state of <br/>\nthe variables after initialization?<br/>\n<br/>\nMichael Feathers<br/>\n<br/>\nedu_kumar wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;Hi all, <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;ve been stuck with a problem, when i&#39;m unit testing my code. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;My problem is that i&#39;ve a really huge method,which calls several small<br/>\n&gt;methods ( methods so small, they&#39;re just getters for member<br/>\n&gt;variables), If i have to unit test this method, i&#39;ve to make sure all<br/>\n&gt;the small methods that it subsequently invoke, work as they&#39;re<br/>\n&gt;expected. But all my member variables get initialized seperately in a<br/>\n&gt;different method which is of no relation with the BIG method I wanted<br/>\n&gt;to test in the first place. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Can I test my method without worrying about the initialization of my<br/>\n&gt;object&#39;s data, by mocking the results of all my getter methods ?  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Ex: <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Class MyClass<br/>\n&gt;{<br/>\n&gt;   private Object _member; <br/>\n&gt;   public void initialize()<br/>\n&gt;   {<br/>\n&gt;     //huge initialization process, which initializes my member<br/>\n&gt;variables. <br/>\n&gt;      _member = new Object(); <br/>\n&gt;   }<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   public void myHugeMethod()<br/>\n&gt;   {<br/>\n&gt;       //.. my logic here.<br/>\n&gt;       Object m = getMember(); <br/>\n&gt;       //... proceed with this value. <br/>\n&gt;   }<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   public Object getMember()<br/>\n&gt;   {<br/>\n&gt;      return this._member; <br/>\n&gt;   }<br/>\n&gt;}<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Now, if I call &#39;myHugeMethod()&#39; without calling &#39;initialize()&#39; method,<br/>\n&gt;it always return NULL. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;All i wanted to do is to test &#39;myHugeMethod()&#39;, by mocking<br/>\n&gt;&#39;getMember()&#39; method and setting the result what i wanted. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I tried using Jmock for creating mocks in my test case, but it fails<br/>\n&gt;because the mock object only knows what exactly I wanted to mock but<br/>\n&gt;nothing more than that. All my application logic is present in<br/>\n&gt;&#39;MyClass&#39; object not in its mock. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;How can I achieve this using Jmock ? <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;FYI, I tried with a direct approach by extending &#39;MyClass&#39; and<br/>\n&gt;overriding the &#39;getMember()&#39; method in it. But I still feel there&#39;s a<br/>\n&gt;better way to do it. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;ll be very thankful for any help in this regard.. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Thanks in advance, <br/>\n&gt;Sarat kumar. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
