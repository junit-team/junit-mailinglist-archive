I don&#39;t know if it has worked\nyet, and I welcome sug=\r\ngestions to improve it.\nThe Software Inferno\n\n\nIt can be difficult to convi=\r\nnce people the value of unit tests.  As Paul\nWheaton says in his article &quot;E=\r\nvil Unit Tests&quot;\nhttp://www.javaranch.com/journal/200603/Journal200603.jsp#a=\r\n1\n&lt;http://www.javaranch.com/journal/200603/Journal200603.jsp#a1&gt;  people\nar=\r\ne both proud of the fact that they have them and bothered by the fact\nthat =\r\nthere is so much work required to create and maintain them.  As\nPaul states=\r\n, a Unit Test is &quot;The smallest amount of testable code.\nOften a single meth=\r\nod/function, sans the use of other methods or\nclasses.&quot;  Methods with multi=\r\nple paths of execution may require\nmultiple unit tests.\nWe don&#39;t need that =\r\nkind of test\nOften, opposition to tests at this level is based on the perce=\r\nived\nreturn on investment:  the level of effort to create and run them plus=\r\n\nongoing maintenance costs vs. what they add to delivering the finished\napp=\r\nlication.   The argument is often that the application as a whole is\nbeing =\r\ndelivered so the JUnit tests must test application functionality,\nnot objec=\r\nts in isolation.  In addition, since the functionality of the\napplication w=\r\nill be verified by the Functional Tests performed by a test\nteam and Accept=\r\nance Tests witnessed by the Customer, lower level tests\nare redundant and o=\r\nmitting them allows more value to be delivered in the\nform of more function=\r\nality.\nAn Analogy\nIn the 1974 production of Irwin Allen&#39;s The Towering Infe=\r\nrno, Paul\nNewman played an architect who designed a 138 story glass tower f=\r\nor a\nbuilder, played by William Holden.  On the afternoon of the opening\nce=\r\nlebration the maintenance staff was testing the backup generators and\na swi=\r\ntch in the power room erupted in smoke.  The architect was called\nand disco=\r\nvered an overload occurred due to the use of the wrong type of\nwire.  At th=\r\ne same time on an upper floor, an overload in an electrical\nswitch box star=\r\nted a fire in a utility room.  A security guard, played\nby O.J. Simpson, re=\r\nad a computer warning from a heat sensor, but the\nautomatic fire alarm syst=\r\nem did not recognize it as a fire and did not\nnotify the fire department.  =\r\nWhen he later saw the smoke on a video\ncamera, he instructed another guard =\r\nto call the fire department\nmanually.\n\n\n\nWhen the fire department arrived, =\r\nthe fire chief, played by Steve\nMcQueen, asked why the ventilation system d=\r\nid not automatically reverse\nto remove the smoke and whether the sprinkler =\r\nsystem was working.  The\narchitect informed him that neither was working on=\r\n the floor with the\nfire and he did not know why.\n\n\n\nThe story revealed tha=\r\nt the builder needed to cut $4 million from\nconstruction costs and had dema=\r\nnded that $2 million come from the cost\nof the electrical subsystem. In ord=\r\ner to accomplish this, the electrical\nsubcontractor, played by Richard Cham=\r\nberlain, changed the\narchitect&#39;s specifications and reduced the robustness =\r\nof the\nelectrical system to the minimum that would meet the requirements of=\r\n the\nbuilding code.  The other $2 million came from cost reductions in othe=\r\nr\nsubsystems with potentially similar results.\n\n\n\nThe fire department was u=\r\nnable to successfully fight the fire and the\narchitect ultimately had to bl=\r\now up the water tanks on an upper floor to\nput it out.  Many people lost th=\r\neir lives and the building was\ndestroyed.\nNow how does this relate to softw=\r\nare?\nThe glass tower is our application.  Paul Newman is the Software\nArchi=\r\ntect who designed the system to provide the functionality desired\nby Willia=\r\nm Holden, the Customer.  Richard Chamberlain is the Project\nManager who mus=\r\nt deliver his portion of the application within the\nCustomer&#39;s budget.  O.J=\r\n. Simpson is the Operations and Maintenance\nteam.  Steve McQueen is the new=\r\n developer sent in to fix the problems\nwith the application, but finds the =\r\nproblems are so pervasive that he\ncannot save it and the application has to=\r\n be rebuilt practically from\nscratch.\nBut the high level tests passed\nThe b=\r\nuilding passed its Integration Tests: Electrical, telephone,\nelevator, air =\r\nconditioning, security systems all work.\n\nThe building passed its Functiona=\r\nl Tests:  Residents are living in the\nbuilding, business tenants are operat=\r\ning there.\n\nThe building passed its Acceptance Tests =96 The city inspector=\r\ns\npassed all of the systems as meeting the building code.\nHow could disaste=\r\nr have been prevented?\nMany things change once an application is released. =\r\n Users perform\nactions and use values untested prior to release.  Problems =\r\nwith\nalgorithms and logic due to untested corner cases are revealed.  New\nf=\r\nunctionality breaks previously working functionality but no one knows\nthis =\r\nbecause the previous functionality had no low level test to reveal\nthe brea=\r\nkage.  Many of these problems can be tested for with low level\nunit tests. =\r\n Examples from the analogy:\n\n\n\nassertEquals(&quot;highAmperageConduitWire&quot;, swit=\r\nchbox.getWireType);\n\n\n\nfloor.setTemperature(140 degrees);\n\nassertTrue(floor=\r\n.getSprinklerSystem().isWaterFlowing());\n\n\n\nfloor.setSmokePresent(true);\n\na=\r\nssertEquals(&quot;reverse&quot;, ventilation.getDirection());\n\n\n\nfireAlarmSystem.setH=\r\neatSensorStatus(&quot;alarm&quot;);\n\nassertTrue(fireAlarmSystem.fireDepartmentNotifie=\r\nd());\n\n\nAnother (shorter) Analogy\nPharaoh wants a new pyramid built, but th=\r\ne straw harvest was poor so the\nratio of straw to mud for the bricks is cut=\r\n in half.  No one tests\nwhether the new bricks can stand the load.  When th=\r\ne fourth level is\nreached, the bricks at the base crumble and the pyramid c=\r\nollapses.\nWhy is software different?\nDo automobile manufacturers destroy a =\r\ncar in a crash test without first\ntesting the characteristics of the bumper=\r\n and other related components\nin isolation from the car?\n\n\n\nDoes NASA send =\r\nup the space shuttle to test the heat properties of the\nceramic tiles that =\r\nline its surface or are the tiles tested on Earth\nfirst?\n\n\n\n\n\nYour thoughts=\r\n?\n\n\n\nBob\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n\n\n",
