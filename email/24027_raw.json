I feel that (the need) for such an =\r\nannotation implies a risk that test go easily lost (this is implemented on =\r\nclass-level in the RegexpSuite in the project unofficialjunit on SF). \nAn i=\r\nnconvenience of this approach is the need for some rigour when naming class=\r\nes and packages. On the other hand, this rigour may anyhow be needed to sep=\r\narate &quot;true&quot; unit tests from integration tests, etc.\n\nAnd yes, I would chip=\r\n in to reimplemente categories in one way or another.\n\nCheers,\n   Georg\n\n--=\r\n- In junit@yahoogroups.com, David Saff &lt;saff@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Classes as cat=\r\negories was my idea.  If I had it to do over again, I&#39;d\n&gt; choose strings.  =\r\nIf anyone has the passion and time to invest in a\n&gt; string-based category i=\r\nmplementation, we should talk.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Thu, Sep 20, 2012 at 2:48 PM, seb=\r\nastian_4711 &lt;usenet@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; **\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hello,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; we sta=\r\nrt using categories in a project to distinguish unit and integration\n&gt; &gt; te=\r\nsts using database. Our requirement is to run unit tests from within\n&gt; &gt; Ec=\r\nlipse and using Maven.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The experience was rather disappointing.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; The support for categories in Eclipse is completely missing. Maven plu=\r\ngin\n&gt; &gt; did not work out of the box as the wrong test executor was instanti=\r\nated.\n&gt; &gt; Once this was fixed, we found that the category class must be ava=\r\nilable in\n&gt; &gt; the class path of all projects, else the plugin fails with a\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; ClassNotFoundException.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Why are categories not plain strings as=\r\n in TestNG? This would prevent\n&gt; &gt; class not found exceptions and in additi=\r\non removes the requirement to have\n&gt; &gt; a dependency on the single module co=\r\nntaining the categories. If you like\n&gt; &gt; you can still use String constants=\r\n to be &quot;name safe&quot;.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Evaluating TestNG as an alternative lead to the=\r\n following results:\n&gt; &gt; - Good support in the Eclipse Plugin and Maven\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n-- Groups (=3D categories) are found by the Eclipse plugin\n&gt; &gt; - TestNG doe=\r\ns not create a new instance per test. As a consequence all\n&gt; &gt; fields must =\r\nbe set in @BeforeMethod. Using a normal constructor causes\n&gt; &gt; unexpected r=\r\nesults.\n&gt; &gt; - @BeforeMethod is not executed, if a group is specified. There=\r\n is a\n&gt; &gt; @BeforeGroup annotation which makes the whole thing much more com=\r\nplex.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Best Regards\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sebastian\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-tex=\r\nt portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n\n\n\n",
