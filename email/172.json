Thought it might be time to <br/>\nupgrade. However, in a project I am currently working on, I&#39;ve found <br/>\nthat tests that run just fine under 3.2 (non-loading runner) will not <br/>\nrun under 3.4. Furthermore, when I use the LoadingTestRunner under <br/>\n3.2 I seem to be getting the same (or similar) problem. Namely, I get <br/>\na &quot;Could not invoke suite() method&quot; error.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only thing I can think of is that since the TestRunners have been <br/>\nre-factored under 3.4 and the separation between loading and non-<br/>\nloading is gone, that perhaps there is something in the class loader <br/>\nthat is causing this.<br/>\n<br/>\nHas anyone experienced similar troubles?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks.<br/>\n<br/>\nChris</div>",
