The beta release is here\n(http://forum.omnicore.com/showthread.php?threadid=68) - Need a reg. \nthough.\n\nI have using IntelliJ but I think CodeGuide does better for itself\n(faster) and more sound compiler checking on the fly. But I like IJ&#39;s \nintegration to ant & Junit (eyepopping - really!) but tis a wee bit \nslow - Wish Java Swing would get faster! & whie im wishing i wish \nthey would generate test case skeletons for Junit like JBuilder does.\n\nIm sorry if this thread is out of place in this group, but im so in \nlove with CodeGuide, that i felt bad when a search on archives for \nCodeGuide yielded nothing ;-)\n\nAny thoughts on other IDEs except the mother of them all, Visual Age \nfor Java(VAJ)\n\nPS: I dont work for CodeGuide - so this not an Advertisement!\nThis is from One CodeGuide smitten Developer  to another (not yet \nsmitten! ;-))\n\n--- In junit@y..., &quot;Richard Brooks&quot; &lt;rbrooks@C...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Not to go too far afield here on refactoring or anything (whoops, I\n&gt; apologize since I probably already have) but there&#39;s a pretty slick \njava\n&gt; IDE around that actually provides some nice assistance with \nrefactoring\n&gt; as well as doing some other fairly incredible things (including a \nfairly\n&gt; eye-popping job of integrating Ant and, by indirection, Junit).  \n&gt;  \n&gt; 21 day eval at: http://www.intellij.com &lt;http://www.intellij.com/&gt;\n&gt; (Nuff said except to say I ain&#39;t associated with these guys in any \nway\n&gt; except being delighted by their product). \n\n\n\n\n",
