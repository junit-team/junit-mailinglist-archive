Rainsberger and all the others who participated in my thread a <br/>\nfew weeks ago:<br/>\n<br/>\nNow Eclipse 3.0 supports what I was looking for: <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sunsite.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/eclipse/downloads/drops/R-\">http://sunsite.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/eclipse/downloads/drops/R-</a><br/>\n3.0-200406251208/eclipse-news-part7-R3.html<br/>\n<br/>\nTake a look at header &quot;JUnit Integration&quot;: &quot;JUnit now supports <br/>\ndecorating an individual test for a test run. This is done by <br/>\nimplementing a public static setUpTest(Test) method in your TestCase <br/>\nclass ...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI had not yet the time to test your solution. Now there is a <br/>\nsolution by Eclipse.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the way, I want to use it to override setUp(). It needs to create <br/>\nan entity in the database because all other tests are depending on <br/>\nthat entity in the database. I do this because I want to have as few <br/>\npreconditions for our tests as possible. But lets not dig deeper in <br/>\nthis, because I will not follow this discussion very much longer.<br/>\n<br/>\nRainsberger, you write you consider using tearDown() a smell. We use <br/>\nthis method for our persistance layer tests. For each entity (like <br/>\nArticle, Supplier and so on) we have a test case class with methods <br/>\nlike testCreateArticle, testUpdateArticle, testDeleteArticle, <br/>\ntestGetArticleById, testArticleIdValidation and so on. The tearDown<br/>\n() deletes the created entities. So it is not just something like <br/>\ninstanceVariable = null. I don&#39;t consider tearDown() as code smell.</div>",
