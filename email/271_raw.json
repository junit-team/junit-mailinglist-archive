My RH6.2 is out of the\n&gt; &gt; box, meaning the original glibc and original X11 and runs on a laptop.\nI&#39;ve\n&gt; &gt; tried two jdk1.2.2s, blackdown&#39;s and sun&#39;s and both have the same\nproblems.\n&gt;\n&gt; Which problems, specifically?  That stack trace you posted from the Junit\n&gt; test suite itself?  Or are there others?\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; What version of JUnit are you using?\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m using JUnit 3.2 right now.  I have 3.3.1, and it runs, but I have to\n&gt; change code in many of my tests to deal with deleted classes and methods\n&gt; I&#39;m using. :/\n&gt;\n&gt; I noticed the error you&#39;re getting, and I don&#39;t see how that can be blamed\n&gt; upon the JVM.  You aren&#39;t getting a JVM core dump or anything, you&#39;re\ngetting\n&gt; JUnit failures.  When I upgraded, I had to diddle with my scripts and\n&gt; IDE settings to change some classpaths.\n&gt;\n&gt; You might be running into differences in the reflection API, perhaps?\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt; Joi Ellis                    Software Engineer\n&gt; Aravox Technologies          joi@..., gyles19@...\n&gt;\n&gt; No matter what we think of Linux versus FreeBSD, etc., the one thing I\n&gt; really like about Linux is that it has Microsoft worried.
