Being rather new to both Junit and JXunit I am not sure if \nthis makes sense. I understand JUnit is used for unit testing but I \nwas wondering If I could use it along with JXunit in creating a \nsimulator.\n\nMy JUnit TC would interface with my api and allow me to enroll \nNetwork elements into my application. I would create my test case \nwith a loop to enroll x number of Network elements. JXunit would be \nused to contain the data necessary to call my api. ie Number of NE&#39;s \nto enroll as well Network Element attributes.\n\nDoes it make sense to use Junit and JXunit.\n\nI also want to raise alarms on my simulated NE&#39;s. But performance is \na concern. I would want my Alarm raising test case to be able to call \nmy API and raise alarms at a rate of 500 alarms per sec. Any idea how \nJunit and JXunit would handle this type of load.\n\n\n\n\n\n",
