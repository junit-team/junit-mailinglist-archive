It&#39;s easy to reload \na \n&gt; TestCase subclass. It would be harder to reload a TestSuite or an \n&gt; object implementing the Test interface.\n&gt; \n&gt; What I&#39;m proposing is to implement a &quot;junit.framework.Reloadable&quot; \n&gt; interface to allow tests that aren&#39;t subclasses of the &quot;TestCase&quot; \n&gt; class to be reloaded and rerun from the Swing GUI. That interface \n&gt; would only have one method:\n&gt; \n&gt; public Test reload();\n&gt; \n&gt; Or maybe the java.lang.Cloneable interface could be used.\n&gt; \n&gt; Anyway, I will implement those changes locally because it&#39;s a \nfeature \n&gt; I really need. If you think it could be a good thing to include in \n&gt; JUnit, let me know and I&#39;ll send you the source code.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Alexandre\n\n\n\n",
