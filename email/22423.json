We don&#39;t seem to have <br/>\nany special name for the latter. I use the term test case for<br/>\nthe combination of a test (set of predicates) with a single<br/>\nset of parameters to which it is applied.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn theory &lt;g&gt; Theories could also introduce data internally, but<br/>\nthis doesn&#39;t seem very practical. So theories are parameterized<br/>\nin practice, if not by nature. This tends to make them look like<br/>\nparameterized tests when viewed from outside.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd of course, the implementation of a parameterized test in <br/>\nan xUnit-style is typically a method with arguments. The <br/>\nimplementation of a Theory is also a method with arguments. Again,<br/>\nthis makes them look like the same thing - or as if a Theory<br/>\nis a specialization of a parameterized test.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think that&#39;s the case. Or at least I don&#39;t think it&#39;s<br/>\nthe most useful way to view things.<br/>\n<br/>\nDr. Who looks human, but he has two hearts. Those two sets of <br/>\npredicates at the heart of a Theory are what make it what it is.<br/>\nWe could say - in either case - that the doctor/theory is a <br/>\nsubset of humans/parameterized-tests, with the addition of<br/>\nsome extra functionality, but this only makes sense at a very<br/>\nsuperficial level.<br/>\n<br/>\nUse parameterized tests if you have a set of examples you need<br/>\nto make work. Use Theories... well... if you have a theory that<br/>\nneeds to be demonstrated. In some kinds of work, we start with<br/>\na theory. In other kinds, we start with examples and have to<br/>\nwork our way toward a mental model. IME, the former is more<br/>\ntypical in implementing algorithms while the latter is more<br/>\ntypical of business programming. Also IME, premature speculation <br/>\nabout the underlying theory/model, rather than just listening to<br/>\nthe customer, is a pretty common anti-pattern.<br/>\n<br/>\nFair warning: what I know about Theories is based on my<br/>\ninterpretation of some of David&#39;s papers and my efforts<br/>\nto implement it in NUnit, where it (a) works pretty well<br/>\nand (b) is poorly understood by most users. I&#39;m generally <br/>\nfamiliar with how the JUnit implementation works, but I <br/>\ndon&#39;t know all the intimate details.<br/>\n<br/>\nCharlie<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a> &lt;mailto:junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt;  [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a> &lt;mailto:junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt; ] On <br/>\n&gt; Behalf Of Berin<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Friday, February 12, 2010 3:08 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a> &lt;mailto:junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Subject: [junit] Re: When to use parameterized tests vs. theories?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My basic understanding of the _practical_ difference between <br/>\n&gt; them is that parameterized tests have more restrictions on <br/>\n&gt; how the data is set up. For example, parameterized tests <br/>\n&gt; have an array of arrays, each internal array is a set of <br/>\n&gt; parameters to apply to the test. Essentially, there is more <br/>\n&gt; onus on the test writer to know what parameters are important <br/>\n&gt; to test, and how they are supposed to relate.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Theories have much less restrictions on the data, and instead <br/>\n&gt; force the test writer to focus on the function of the theory <br/>\n&gt; independent of the data. That&#39;s a good thing IMO.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My guess is that parameterized tests came first, and because <br/>\n&gt; of the limitations it forced on the test writer theories came <br/>\n&gt; later. That is only a guess.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In some ways I would like to pair the expected result with <br/>\n&gt; the passed in parameter, but that solution requires a <br/>\n&gt; parameterized test. In most applications, I care more about <br/>\n&gt; the behavior of a class implementing an interface, or <br/>\n&gt; something of that nature.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What I&#39;m missing here is what is the _philosophical_ difference?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a> &lt;mailto:junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt; , CÃ©dric Beust â(tm)&quot; &lt;cbeust@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; If my understanding is correct, there is definitely an <br/>\n&gt; overlap between <br/>\n&gt; &gt; parameterized tests and theories.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Theories generate a set of tuples representing the combination of a <br/>\n&gt; &gt; data set, while parameterized can return... well, any data <br/>\n&gt; set.

The parameterized tests are a bit more of a pain to set <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; up; but they provide a little more control over how <br/>\n&gt; things get matched up.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Of course, theories allow for much more robust data sets by <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; combining all the data points in every way. This can provide an <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; order of magnitude more tests automatically, but care has to be <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; taken. For example, the number of actual tests run is D^P <br/>\n&gt; where D is <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the number of data points and P is the number of <br/>\n&gt; parameters on any <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; given theory. This can generate a lot of tests quickly, and the <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;runDiscretely&quot; option I hacked together for theories <br/>\n&gt; would definitely not be a preferable.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I now know that assumptions are filtering devices for <br/>\n&gt; theories, so <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; it does not mark the test as failed. Essentially, the <br/>\n&gt; reason that an <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; assumption is marked as passing for the theory is that the <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; assumption successfully filtered out that data combination. I get <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that now, but I probably will use that feature very sparingly.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The question I have is what problem was the reason parameterized <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; tests supposed to solve, and how is that different than <br/>\n&gt; the problem <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that theories are supposed to solve?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; --<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ***Cédric<br/>\n&gt; &gt; *<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
