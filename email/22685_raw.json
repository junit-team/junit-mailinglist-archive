So, I threw caution to the wind and submitted not\nonly\nmethods that did=\r\n X, but unit tests to ensure that the method really did\ndo\nmy best understa=\r\nnding of X.\n\nTwo of my three previous employers had zero unit tests in-hous=\r\ne when I\nstepped through the door. In both of them, I wrote the first tests=\r\n and\nstarted trying to share the vision of tested code being somewhere that=\r\n\nbugs\ncan&#39;t hide. It&#39;s hard work.\n\nUnit testing should be a &quot;no-brainer&quot;, b=\r\nut I find that it&#39;s still\ntreated\npoorly within corporations.\n\nSimon\n\n\nOn W=\r\ned, May 5, 2010 at 6:25 PM, Bradley, Todd\n&lt;todd.bradley@...&gt;wrote:\n=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Mike, this is such a great topic you&#39;ve stumbled on. Where I work, w=\r\ne\nare\n&gt; doing lots of hiring this year. Every development engineer candidat=\r\ne\nthat\n&gt; comes in gets to do at least two programming problems on the board=\r\n.\nFor one\n&gt; of the problems, the question is something like, &quot;Write a funct=\r\nion in\nany\n&gt; language you want (except Perl) to do XXX.&quot; And then once they=\r\n have\nthat, we\n&gt; ask them to tell us how they&#39;d unit test what they just wr=\r\note.\n&gt;\n&gt; It&#39;s a rare individual that says, &quot;Damn, now I realize I should ha=\r\nve\n&gt; written the unit test FIRST!&quot; And out of probably 100 candidates in\nth=\r\ne past\n&gt; few years of this approach, not a single candidate has ever actual=\r\nly\nwritten\n&gt; a JUnit/NUnit/whatever test case first. But I hold out hope th=\r\nat\nperson will\n&gt; someday grace our interview room.\n&gt;\n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; Todd.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: junit@yahoogroups.com &lt;junit%40yahoo=\r\ngroups.com&gt; [mailto:\n&gt; junit@yahoogroups.com &lt;junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt;] On =\r\nBehalf Of Mike\n&gt; Forsberg\n&gt; Sent: Monday, May 03, 2010 10:24 AM\n&gt; To: junit=\r\n@yahoogroups.com &lt;junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Subject: Re: [junit] When it m=\r\natters most, don&#39;t forget your tests.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thank you to all those that respo=\r\nnded.\n&gt;\n&gt; I agree that if a candidate spends all their time on the simple e=\r\nrror\ncases\n&gt; then they don&#39;t understand TDD.\n&gt;\n&gt; I think a pair programming=\r\n environment would be ideal for an\ninterview.\n&gt; Maybe actually have the can=\r\ndidate solve an actual problem you&#39;re\nsolving.\n&gt; This may sound like it may=\r\n take a lot of time, but I&#39;d rather be part\nof a\n&gt; team that can spend 1-2 =\r\nhours writing code in an interview, then waste\nthat\n&gt; time on soft silks. I=\r\nf the candidate complains that it&#39;s not their\n&gt; IDE/editor of choice, that =\r\nshould send up a flag. Granted this is my\nideal\n&gt; environment.\n&gt;\n&gt; What abo=\r\nut a 2 stage interview? One where they write the tests for a\n&gt; already\n&gt; ex=\r\nisting piece of code (maybe to increase the codes functionality),\nthen\n&gt; an=\r\nother where they try and write code to get the tests to pass.\nGranted\n&gt; thi=\r\ns is not testing if they actually use TDD, but it would show if\nthey\n&gt; have=\r\n\n&gt; the skill. Maybe forcing the iteration process of test -&gt;\nfunctionality =\r\n-&gt;\n&gt; test -&gt; functionality will show if they have the skill.\n&gt;\n&gt; I think sp=\r\nending some time, 2-3 hours with a machine, later in the\n&gt; interview\n&gt; proc=\r\ness, say after a phone screen, maybe second round of face to face,\n&gt; might\n=\r\n&gt; pay dividends in the quality of people on a team. Then again it might\n&gt; d=\r\nepend on how skilled you need this individual to be.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks for the inp=\r\nut,\n&gt;\n&gt; Big Mike\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been=\r\n removed]\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
