If it were just removing the duplicate =\r\nspace, you  \ncould do that with something like a hardcoded array:\n\nString[]=\r\n reversedSentence =3D { &quot;technology&quot;, &quot;devolopment&quot;, &quot;software&quot;,  \n&quot;a&quot;, &quot;is=\r\n&quot;, &quot;Tdd&quot; };\nfor (String word: reversedSentence) {\n\tresult.append(word, &quot; &quot;)=\r\n;\n}\n\nThat is certainly one possible route.\n\nYou might try to instead think =\r\nin terms of moving from the simplest  \npossible case and adding complexity =\r\nincrementally to the test cases.  \nThe simplest possible test case here? Em=\r\npty string, do nothing. Write  \nthe code to get this to pass. This gets you=\r\nr interface in place.\n\nThen consider the next most simple case: one word. R=\r\neversal is the  \nsame as the input. You have to check for the existence of =\r\nthe  \nseparator character (indexOf is probably sufficient).\n\nThen move to t=\r\nhe next case, which would probably be two words. You  \ndon&#39;t need a loop to=\r\n implement this case.\n\nThen write a case for multiple words. A loop is prob=\r\nably prudent at  \nthis point.\n\nFinally, oddball/edge cases: Does your algor=\r\nithm work for multiple  \nspaces inbetween words? Should it retain the same =\r\ninput spacing (or  \nnot?). Write a test.\n\nYou&#39;ll end up with a more compreh=\r\nensive set of test cases, and more  \nimportantly, you&#39;ll have arrived at th=\r\ne solution more incrementally.\n\nJeff\n\n",
