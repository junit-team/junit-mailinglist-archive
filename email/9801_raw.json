Proper usage.  From the Fixture section on JUnit Web site:\n&gt; &lt;snip /&gt;\n\nWhat you just snipped out was taken directly from the JUnit Web site.\nJust to keep things clear, let&#39;s put it back in:\n\n&quot;Tests need to run against the background of a known set of objects. This\nset of objects is called a test fixture. When you are writing tests you\nwill often find that you spend more time writing the code to set up the\nfixture than you do in actually testing values.&quot;\n\nPay close attention, class.  The set of objects is the fixture.  The\nfixture is what you set up.  This is clear and unambiguous English from\nthe authors of JUnit.\n\n&gt; Let us try this again, with one slight correction.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Ah.. but in proper usage each fixture is a different TestCase class...&quot;\n\nNow, either\n\n*  this &quot;correction&quot; is also from the JUnit site, in which case they have\n   contradicted themselves, or\n\n*  this is simply your interpretation, in which case you should defer to\n   what the authors of JUnit.\n\nWhich is it?  Searching on the Web page I gave a URL for, I just don&#39;t\nfind the phrase &quot;in proper usage&quot;.\n\nFor that matter, if I google I get\n\n    Your search - junit &quot;each fixture is a different TestCase class&quot; -\n    did not match any documents.\n\nGoogling on a shorter phrase gives me the same result\n\n    Your search - junit &quot;different TestCase class&quot; - did not match any\n    documents.\n\nIt would seem that if this text appears anywhere, Google hasn&#39;t noticed\nit.\n\n&gt; &quot;test case&quot; (as used in the document Jim quoted) == instance of\n&gt; TestCase, usually implemented as a method on a TestCase class\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;fixture&quot; == TestCase class\n&gt;\n&gt; OK?\n\nNot really.  A TestCase always contains a fixture.  This may or may not\nbe clearly distinguished by putting it in a setUp() method, but it&#39;s the\nset of objects that you are running your test against.\n\nIf we are going to be truly nitpicking, then recall that an object is an\nINSTANCE of a class.  A set of objects can never be a class.  It is  a set\nof instances of a set of classes.\n\n\nMy apologies to the wider world for starting this absurd thread; I was\njust trying to be helpful to the enquirer.\n\n--\nJim Dixon  jdd@...   tel +44 117 982 0786  mobile +44 797 373 7881\n\n\n",
