I&#39;ll leave aside discussion that you can&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; always isolate components from the infrastructure because it is a<br/>\n&gt; separate topic and in fact quite achievable in my opinion.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Now, for each isolated unit of code we have an unit test. When<br/>\n&gt; application size grows complexity of unit tests would grow linearly and<br/>\n&gt; not exponential and as a result close to 100% test coverage is not any<br/>\n&gt; more difficult to achieve for large codebase then for a small codebase.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I guess it depends what you mean by &quot;code coverage&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you mean &quot;that segment of code was run by at least one test&quot;, then yes,<br/>\nit&#39;s not &quot;too hard&quot; (albeit still sometimes too complex to be worth the<br/>\ntrouble).<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you mean &quot;all possible paths of execution have been tested&quot;, then it&#39;s<br/>\nclearly impossible because it&#39;s exponential with the number of branches in<br/>\nyour code (see &quot;cyclomatic complexity&quot;).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nCédric<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
