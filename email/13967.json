However, at least  I&#39;m sure the<br/>\n&gt; tests are running the way I think they should be running!  <br/>\n&gt; I distrust computers and software greatly<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If you trust your eyes more than computers, you are probably in the wrong<br/>\nindustry :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; so I&#39;m always trying to check up on what I<br/>\n&gt; think is going on... this is doubly true when I&#39;m using new (for me)<br/>\n&gt; software like Junit.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; How do you Junit veterans assure yourself that a test is <br/>\n&gt; actually running and doing what it should be doing?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Heavy doses of alcohol do wonder for me :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nMore seriously, the HTML (or wherever you generate them) reports will help<br/>\nyou make sure your tests pass, and if you are not quite sure of yourself,<br/>\nsome redundancy in your tests doesn&#39;t hurt either (testing the same feature<br/>\ntwice in slightly modified ways in two different places).<br/>\n<br/>\nBut at some point, you really have to trust that your code is really being<br/>\nexecuted and it takes a little leap of faith to get there (especially when<br/>\nyou are testing a testing framework with itself, which was the case in the<br/>\nearly days of TestNG :-)).<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nCédric<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://testng.org\">http://testng.org</a></div>",
