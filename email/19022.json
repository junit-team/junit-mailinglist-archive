However, currently, when it comes to<br/>\n&quot;well-formedness&quot; of JUnit classes, the answer is either yes or no,<br/>\nand since...<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I suspect you don&#39;t want to get into &quot;JUnit lint&quot; territory<br/>\n<br/>\n... is true, I&#39;m not yet convinced to change this.  In short, I could<br/>\nmake @Ignore @BeforeClass declare the class malformed, with specific<br/>\ndirections to the developer about how to accomplish what they want.<br/>\nWould that meet the actual pain point?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s of course not impossible to change JUnit to have well-formed,<br/>\nsomewhat well-formed, and not-at-all well-formed classes, but I&#39;m not<br/>\nyet convinced that there&#39;s pain pushing me in that direction.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; but at the<br/>\n&gt; same time, users are quite logically trying to use @Ignore in a context<br/>\n&gt; you didn&#39;t intend, but that nevertheless makes sense to them, and in<br/>\n&gt; general.<br/>\n<br/>\nVery true, and I hadn&#39;t given that enough credit yet.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; If @Ignore-ing a @Test stops the test from running, then why doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; @Ignore-ing a @Before stop the before from running? This is, perhaps,<br/>\n&gt; why I wouldn&#39;t support @Ignore, but would rather just ask the test<br/>\n&gt; writer to remove the @Test annotation when he doesn&#39;t want the test to<br/>\n&gt; run. I don&#39;t know that @Ignore provides better results than removing the<br/>\n&gt; @Test annotation temporarily.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs this a separate issue?  Are you suggesting that, given the choice,<br/>\nyou would not have included @Ignore, with the attendant reminder to<br/>\nun-@Ignore sometime in the future, in JUnit at all?  I&#39;m curious about<br/>\nthat position, but first want to make sure if it is your position.<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\n   David Saff </span></blockquote></div>",
