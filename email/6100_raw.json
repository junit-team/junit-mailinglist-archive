Only problem is, I already have those lines.\n&gt;\n&gt; The root of the problem for me was that I had jrun.jar in my\n&gt; classpath. jrun.jar is an 8 meg monster that comes with JRun4 and\n&gt; includes its own copy of the sax classes. Taking jrun.jar out of my\n&gt; classpath solved the problem and the tests ran fine.\n&gt;\n&gt; If anyone happens to know why, I&#39;d like to hear it.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
