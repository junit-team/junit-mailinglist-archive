This is a classic source of error in software, and <br/>\nI would hate to see you present it to students as a good idea.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, in your example, the price can be wrong by up to 1% in either <br/>\ndirection! Is this really what you want? If the price comes back as <br/>\n7.93, that&#39;s good enough?! No way.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt least for now, use an integer to express price in cents, so you would <br/>\nhave this:<br/>\n<br/>\npublic void testPrice()<br/>\n{<br/>\n       Book book = new Book();<br/>\n       book.setPrice(799);<br/>\n       assertEquals(799, book.getPrice());<br/>\n}<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s also no reason to call the variable &quot;b1&quot;. If it&#39;s a book, then <br/>\ncall it a book.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Sudents should write the set and get methods and set values<br/>\n&gt; correctly so this test is passed.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Problem : - I want them to work through the exercises and tests one<br/>\n&gt; at a time, but the test class will obviously not compile until all<br/>\n&gt; of the correct methods are in place in the Book class.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Why is this a problem? That&#39;s part of test-driven development: you write <br/>\na test, then write enough code to make it /compile/, then run the test <br/>\nand watch it fail, then write enough code to make the test pass. That&#39;s <br/>\n&quot;textbook&quot; test-driven development, and exactly the way I teach it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Is my approach to this incorrect. Is there better way?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, your code needed some work, but your approach is solid.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Hope you can help.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You be the judge. :)<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ.
