B. Rainsberger&quot; &lt;jbrains@...&gt;\r\nReply-To: jbr@...\r\nX-Yahoo-Group-Post: member; u=127224993\r\nX-Yahoo-Profile: nails762\r\n\r\n&gt;Background:\n&gt;\n&gt;I have written several derivatives of java.io.InputStream a=\r\nnd test cases\n&gt;that go along with them. However, during a recent peer revie=\r\nw of the\n&gt;code, we discovered an inconsistency between the contract of one =\r\nof the\n&gt;methods in java.io.InputStream and my implementation of that same m=\r\nethod\n&gt;in the specialized subclass.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Problem:\n&gt;\n&gt;I would like to have=\r\n a set of functional tests (black-box style) that\n&gt;enforce the behaviors of=\r\n the super class, java.io.InputStream. Then use\n&gt;that same set of tests to =\r\nensure that the basic contracts for each of\n&gt;the classes I write follow tha=\r\nt contract (i.e. pass those generic\n&gt;tests). Does anyone have a suggestion =\r\nfor doing this? While this\n&gt;specific example pertains to java.io.InputStrea=\r\nm the same scenario may\n&gt;occur with any class hierarchy.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Environment=\r\n:\n&gt;\n&gt;I use Ant to compile and run my tests, so ideally any solution will be=\r\n\n&gt;compatible with the &lt;batchtest&gt; mechanism or otherwise allow for the\n&gt;dyn=\r\namic (read, &quot;automatic&quot;) addition of new tests.\n&gt;\n&gt;----- End -----\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;O=\r\nk, the pointer was for an abstract test class. I can see the\n&gt;applicability=\r\n for a simple inheritance problem as the one I posted was.\n&gt;However, there =\r\nis a situation where that solution does not seem to work.\n&gt;Enforcing interf=\r\naces&#39; contracts - I cannot use the same model to enforce\n&gt;three different i=\r\nnterface&#39;s contracts (since there is no multiple\n&gt;inheritance).\n\nI don&#39;t un=\r\nderstand why this is a problem. If your class implements three interfaces, =\r\nthen you have three test cases for that class, each a subclass of the corre=\r\nsponding abstract test for each interface. Run them all. No law says you mu=\r\nst have one test case per production class, and in fact, you probably shoul=\r\ndn&#39;t!\n\n&gt;Also, only some objects implement the equals method. These\n&gt;I have =\r\na standard set of tests to ensure that null and a few other\n&gt;scenarios are =\r\nhandled correctly (as well as the hashcode / equals\n&gt;relationship). I would=\r\n like to have these standard tests available for\n&gt;different objects without=\r\n having to rewrite them all the time.\n\nGSBase&#39;s EqualsTester for testing eq=\r\nuals(). JUnit-addons also has something, but I can&#39;t remember the name of i=\r\nt.\n\n\nJ. B.
