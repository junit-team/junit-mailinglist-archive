This seems to be a legitimate \ncode smell.  However, that doesn&#39;t mean you will always decide to do \nso.  In those cases, testing them, as private methods, is necessary, \nIMHO.\n\nOne technique we use, with Java, is to implement our JUnit TestCases \nas static inner classes.  This gives you the access you require.  It \nalso provides other benefits, especially with TDD.  It makes managing \nthe source a lot easier.  You only have to check in/out one file from \nSCM.  That way you never, ahem, forget the test code.  It&#39;s always \nmarried to the app code.  This helps enforce a mindset that the test \ncode is just as important as the app code.  And it&#39;s really \ncomfortable to bounce up and down the single file in your editor as \nyou iterate between writing test code and app code.  Deployment is \nnot a problem, since inner classes are compiled into seperate class \nfiles, using the AppClass$TestClass.class naming convention.\n\nYour mileage may vary, but it works pretty well for us.  I&#39;d be \ninterested in others&#39; approaches, as well.\n\nBy the way, I&#39;m new here.  Nice to meet you all!\n\n\n\n\n\n",
