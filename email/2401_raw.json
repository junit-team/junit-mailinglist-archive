Do you think it would be a\ndesirable\n&gt; design decision to refactor your class(es) to reflect the first method of\n&gt; testing?  That is have a base class that handles TCP/IP traffic requests\nand\n&gt; then two decendents (one that tunnels through SSL and one that doesn&#39;t).\n\nFirst of all, thank you Johannes and Jason for your replies to my\nquestion.  This has gotten me to thinking, and is becoming even more\ninteresting.  Specifically, it is very interesting how thinking about\ntesting affects the design of the product code.\n\nIn my particular case it is already true that (virtually) all of the\ncode I&#39;m trying to test doesn&#39;t care whether we&#39;re using SSL or not.\nThe beauty of these SSL libraries is precisely that they allow you to\ntreat a socket as a socket, whether or not it has SSL going on under\nthe covers.\n\nSo, in a way, that suggests that if all I want to test is my code,\nthen I shouldn&#39;t have to test the same thing twice.  All I (should)\nwant to do is to verify that my code produces the results I think it\nshould, given a certain input.  That would be true Unit Testing.\n\nNow I had a number of problems recently that I traced not to failure\nof my code to do what I thought it should do, but rather to\ndiscrepancies between the behavior of plain sockets and SSL sockets.\nIn other words, the SSL libraries had bugs in them.  (For example, one\nproblem concerned how the server should protect itself from an I/O\noperation that takes an &quot;impossibly&quot; long duration.)\n\nSo then I thought maybe what I&#39;m trying to do here isn&#39;t really Unit\nTesting.  Because I&#39;m trying to test the operation of the system as a\nwhole (or at least a part of it that is bigger than one &quot;unit&quot;).  So\nwhat is it?  Is it &quot;Functional Testing&quot;?  I don&#39;t think so, because\nthis unusual error case isn&#39;t something that I would expect I could\nfind in a collection of User Stories.\n\nIn retrospect, I can come up with a characterization of the problem\nand say that I made certain assumptions about the behavior of the\nsockets API.  Given that was the case, it would have been prudent of\nme to write (very simple) test cases that verify those assumptions,\nand run them on both plain and SSL sockets.  These tests, of course,\nwould be very simple, and wouldn&#39;t involve any of my product code.\n\nPresumably if I tested the assumptions correctly in both cases, then I\nwouldn&#39;t have to test my code in both of its configurations (since\nfrom its point of view it&#39;s not really doing anything different in the\ntwo different cases).\n\nIs this another form of testing (&quot;Assumption Testing&quot;)?  Or perhaps\nanother way to look at it is that I&#39;m a &quot;customer&quot; of the SSL library\nprovider, and I need to have my own &quot;Acceptance Test&quot; of the\nfunctionality that I expect it to provide?\n\nAnd, even if I try to persuade myself that this would be the correct\nway to test, somehow I&#39;m nervous that I would miss a test case, or not\nbe aware of some assumption that I had made.\n\n - Alan Bram\n\n\n",
