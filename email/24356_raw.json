Currently datapoint methods that throw\nexceptions are simply ignored: this means that theories with two valid\nsources for a parameter quietly pass even if one of those sources is\nfailing and never producing values to test.\n\nThere&#39;s an open pull request to fix this (\nhttps://github.com/junit-team/junit/pull/639), making those datapoint\nmethods fail instead, but there&#39;s concern that this can break tests that\ncurrently pass, or that people might even actually be depending on this\nfunctionality.\n\nDoes anybody have any strong feelings either way on this? I&#39;m particularly\ninterested from anybody who does depend on the current functionality, or\nanybody who can think of any reasonable scenarios where you might prefer\nthis behaviour.\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
