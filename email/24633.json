Stefan Birkner has sent his email to the junit mailing <br/>\nlist and Nat Pryce&#39;s sample project is about separating junit4 and <br/>\nhamcrest. Thus I assumed we were talking about the next (or some future) <br/>\nJunit4 release.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegarding JUnit5 the separation makes more sense but should be supported <br/>\nby a committment to compatiblity and extensibility. I think there is a <br/>\nbroad agreement that JUnit5 should concentrate on the aspects of running <br/>\ntests but needs to be extensible and needs to provide hooks for other <br/>\nprojects like test-starters (IDE, maven surefire, pitest ....), test <br/>\nresult reporters (IDE, maven surefire, CI server plugins, sonar qube, <br/>\n...), test environment enhancers (Spring, JMock, Arquillian and all the <br/>\nothers that have custom runner implementations) and many more. But as <br/>\nmore and more projects will use these hooks they have to be reliable and <br/>\nstable (at least across minor releases).<br/>\n<br/>\nI tried to keep it short and will continue discussion at the mailing list.<br/>\n<br/>\nStefan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAm 12.01.2015 um 17:26 schrieb Esko Luontola <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:esko.luontola@...\">esko.luontola@...</a> <br/>\n[junit]:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Some time ago the testing-java-8 mailing list was started to discuss<br/>\n&gt; things like these; to throw around ideas about new testing frameworks<br/>\n&gt; and tools in the post-Java 8 world, without cluttering the JUnit mailing<br/>\n&gt; list with non-JUnit stuff.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!\">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!</a>forum/testing-java-8<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Stefan Bechtold <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:stefan.bechtold@...\">stefan.bechtold@...</a> [junit] wrote on 12.1.2015 13:53:<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Concerning the exception handling, I like the JUnit Rule based approach for applications up to Java 7 (without support for lambdas) very well. This provides a way to execute a piece of code and provide information about the code that was executed. In order to be compatible to Java 7 (and maybe 6), I think it is a must-have feature in the next testing framework. Anyways, wherever possible, I would strongly recommend to leave the assertion part out of the test framework and simply provide an extension point (like the @Rule annotation) for 3rd party libraries. For Java 8, I really prefer the lambda approach, as it makes the test code much more readable and expresses the intend of the test case more clearly. </span></blockquote></div>",
