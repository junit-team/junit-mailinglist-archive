I do have encountered the same problem when i used to write the JUNIT for some WebApplications in Eclipse. <br/>\n <br/>\nBasically ClassNot Found Exceptions we do  get because of the following reasons: Do try the following solutions and let me know if this could solve ur problem. <br/>\n <br/>\n1. Did u import the package for the corresponding directory structure for the java file which u are going to write the JUNIT code. I mean to say that in the TestCase.java file did u import the corresponding package? If not lets try doing that. <br/>\n <br/>\n2. Also Did u set the CLASSPATH in the Environment Variables? If not please set it and try. <br/>\n <br/>\nLet me know if these could solve ur problem. <br/>\n <br/>\nRegards<br/>\nSuresh<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Balasubramaniam, Ram Ganesh (Cognizant)&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:BRamGanesh@...\">BRamGanesh@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\nBalasubramaniam, Ram Ganesh (Cognizant) wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; hai,<br/>\n&gt;       I am doing my Web Application in Eclipse and Test Run by JUnit.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;       When I write a TestXXX for a class XXX , and run it , it gives me<br/>\n&gt; a error &quot;Class not Found&quot; .
