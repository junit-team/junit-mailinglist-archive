I have started experimenting with using it for\nparameter declarations after exploring HtmlUnit a bit\nbut haven&#39;t reached a conclusion for my own habits).\n\nI do find it helps clarify my intent about a local\nvariable particularly in large methods.  (My current\ncontract has me working on some pretty &quot;procedural&quot;\nJava code and it&#39;s not always appropriate to jump in\nand refactor until the methods are all nice and\nsmall.)  Using final for local variables in these big\nmethods makes it clear to anyone reading the code that\nthe variable is expected to at least be predictable as\nto what object or value it refers to for the rest of\nthe method.  The only thing I expect the compiler to\ndo with it is enforce the &quot;set once&quot; property just in\ncase I or anyone else forgets that they shouldn&#39;t set\nit again.\n\nI&#39;m not sure it helps much when methods are small but\nI do find that I&#39;m starting to put it in even with\nsmall methods just to be consistent.\n\nDoing it because it might help the compiler generate\nbetter code hasn&#39;t tempted me.  I guess I suspect that\nif I have a performance problem in a method, I won&#39;t\nfix it just by giving the compiler a hint like final. \nI expect I&#39;d have to think harder about how to reduce\nthe cost of the work being performed in that method\nand perhaps it&#39;s neighbors in the call stack.\n\nRick Berman\nAncilla SF LLC\n415-819-4865\n\n",
