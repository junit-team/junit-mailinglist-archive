Static methods are hard to replace<br/>\nfor unit testing, which suggests that maybe their use is problematic.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;nostalgia&gt;<br/>\nof course, in Smalltalk, you can override class methods because classes<br/>\nare objects too. Sigh.<br/>\n&lt;/nostalgia&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nA couple of solutions are to move the static methods to the instance<br/>\nside so you can attach them to an interface. Alternatively, create a<br/>\nlittle object that wraps the static code. Usually this leads you to<br/>\ncreating a context type that gets passed around and turns out to be<br/>\nReally Useful Object (Sorry, been reading Thomas The Tank Engine to my<br/>\nkid again).<br/>\n<br/>\nSteve</div>",
