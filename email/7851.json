If B&#39;s method is trivial, then testing B only tests C and nothing else, so I wouldn&#39;t bother writing the test. If B&#39;s method takes parameters and passes them to C, then B&#39;s method still cannot break: only the methods that call B&#39;s method and C could break, so test those.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would use the same approach for the relationship between A and B.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf B&#39;s method is not trivial, then as soon as you feel the pain of duplicated tests mock the behavior in C that B calls and use that mock behavior in the test. This allows you to test B in isolation from any defects in C.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope this helps.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;So said Jonathan Oddy on 4/25/2003 --------------------<br/>\n&gt;I understand that in general we want to write tests and test cases that are<br/>\n&gt;not dependent upon each other so that an earlier failing(?) test doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;set<br/>\n&gt;state of the underlying object(s) to prejudice later tests.  Okay fine, but<br/>\n&gt;I was wondering how people solve/resolve the following type of dependency.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;If I have three classes A, B and C where A delegates some functionality to<br/>\n&gt;B<br/>\n&gt;which delegates to C.  During my implementation and unit testing I write<br/>\n&gt;tests for C then implement the desired functionality in C.  I then repeat<br/>\n&gt;the process for B and A, okay fine.  But now I have an implied unit test<br/>\n&gt;dependency don&#39;t I?  So when running my tests as a suite I really want my<br/>\n&gt;test cases to run in the order C, B, A and never any other order because if<br/>\n&gt;the defect is in C then I want to know about it from C and not from A or B.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I am currently implementing a small library that does a lot of this style<br/>\n&gt;of<br/>\n&gt;delegation, and being reasonably new to JUnit I wondered how other people<br/>\n&gt;work round this issue especially since those nice Eclipse people provide a<br/>\n&gt;helpful &quot;run all tests in a package option&quot;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Thanks inadnavce<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Jonathan<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Yahoo!
