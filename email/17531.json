One question, though:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Here&#39;s another example:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The JUnit 3 test runners create all test cases before running, and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; keep references to them in memory after running.  Anything kept as field<br/>\n&gt; &gt; references in a test class will not be GC&#39;d until the test runner<br/>\n&gt; &gt; releases the test class reference (which is never).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Doesn&#39;t this qualify as a memory leak? Is this a known bug or working<br/>\n&gt; as designed? Mayby I didn&#39;t understand fully what you meant: when the<br/>\n&gt; TestRunner is done, isn&#39;t it GC&#39;ed by itself?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Whether as designed or not, it&#39;s poorly suited to running lots of<br/>\nresource-intensive tests.  In order to say whether it&#39;s a leak or not, you have<br/>\nto define when the test runner is &quot;done&quot;.</div>",
