Rainsberger wrote:\n\n&gt; albsavoia wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt;  &gt; Based on the number of replies and positive emails I received from\n&gt;  &gt; that blog, I realized that the idea of Testivus (an approach to\n&gt;  &gt; unit/developer testing less focused on testing dogma and more on\n&gt;  &gt; testing karma) had struck a nerve and decided to take the idea of\n&gt;  &gt; Testivus even further and wrote &quot;The Way of Testivus&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; I object again, as I have in the past, to the notion that conviction is\n&gt; dogma. For example, I find that people who disagree with my convictions\n&gt; call me dogmatic, and I find that to be a cop-out on their part. I would\n&gt; find it easier to take your ideas seriously if you didn&#39;t pose them as\n&gt; being against some nonexistent testing dogma.\n\nI should add to clarify my position that I think you&#39;re wonderful, I \nlike you and I respect you, but I just dislike quite strongly the way \nyou present these ideas. You&#39;re naturally free not to care about that, \nbut I hope you continue to like and respect me, as I think you do.\n\n[More concisely: it wasn&#39;t a personal attack, so please don&#39;t take it \nthat way.]\n-- \nJ.
