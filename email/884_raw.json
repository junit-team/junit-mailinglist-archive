I would like an\n&gt; &gt; error/failure in testMoneyEquals() to show *first* in the output. How to\n&gt; &gt; implement this? The test writer could somehow specify a &quot;level&quot; for each\n&gt; &gt; test (basic, mid, complex). That could be totally optionnal and thus not\n&gt; &gt; change the current API. That would be *just a hint* from the test writer to\n&gt; &gt; the person running the tests saying &quot;hey, look there first&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ve been relying upon the undocumented behavior in JUnit&#39;s reflection support.\n&gt; Reflection seems to return methods based on their order within the class file,\n&gt; and JUnit&#39;s Result stores failures in a vector.  Vector&#39;s elements() method\n&gt; is documented as returning the contents in vector order.\n&gt;\n&gt; So, basically, I write my tests in order, simplest first, most complex last,\n&gt; and it comes out in the right order if I use have JUnit use reflection to\n&gt; identify the test methods.\n&gt;\n&gt; Naturally, if Kent or Erich change the Result class, I&#39;m hosed.\n&gt;\n\nI like the idea of test cases classified by their complexity and\ndefinitely it is not good to rely on some undocumented features,\nthus I would appreciate some support in JUnit framework.\n\nMorover ordering test functions by their complexity restricts\nyou to the class boundaries. Suite, generally, can include tests\nfrom several classes and then it would be nice to have *basic*\ntests from all classes grouped together.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; If you wanted to do this &quot;right&quot;, you could extend TestRunner and replace\n&gt; printFailures() with a version which sorts the enumeration based on whatever\n&gt; criteria you like.  Method name comes to mind as something easy to use.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Personnally I&#39;m not even sure it&#39;s worth it, but I wanted to share that idea\n&gt; &gt; with people on the list.\n&gt;\n&gt; Oh, I think it&#39;s worth it.  The last time I brought it up I got flamed. :p\n&gt; I hope you fare better than I did.\n&gt;\n\nNow maybe some core XP funs will curicify me, but I see\nit useful to have a possibility to define dependencies between\nthose above metnioned groups of tests with the same complexity level.\nI like the TestRunner which will skip more complex tests, when\nsome basic tests fail. Note, that for testing some large products\nthe test can take 1 hour or more. Why should I wait for\nsuch a long time just to know that some basic test failed and\nthus all others depending on it failed too.\n\nVita\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt; Joi Ellis                    Software Engineer\n&gt; Aravox Technologies          joi@..., gyles19@...\n&gt;\n&gt; No matter what we think of Linux versus FreeBSD, etc., the one thing I\n&gt; really like about Linux is that it has Microsoft worried.
