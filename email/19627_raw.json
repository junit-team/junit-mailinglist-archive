And as I said before, test=\r\n runs\nthat take hours if not sometimes entire nights to run are pretty comm=\r\non in\nenterprise software.\n\n-- \nCedric\nhttp://testng.org\n\n\n\nOn 7/26/07, Ken=\r\nt Beck &lt;kentb@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;   All,\n&gt;\n&gt; It seems clear to me tha=\r\nt some sort of test classification scheme is a\n&gt; reasonable thing to add to=\r\n JUnit. However, rather than simply copy one of\n&gt; the models out there we&#39;r=\r\ne going to go back to first principles and try to\n&gt; derive a model for clas=\r\nsification that is concise, useful, flexible, and,\n&gt; above all, easy to use=\r\n.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ve heard two purposes for classification:\n&gt; * Performance\n&gt; * Assum=\r\nptions\n&gt;\n&gt; Performance\n&gt;\n&gt; If you have tests that run for longer than your =\r\nattention span (my limits\n&gt; are 1 second for the inner loop of programming =\r\nand 10 minutes for\n&gt; integration), running a subset of the tests can give y=\r\nou some assurance\n&gt; that\n&gt; the software is working. Classification is one w=\r\nay to reduce test run\n&gt; time--just this one test, all tests in this class, =\r\nall tests in this\n&gt; package, all tests labeled &quot;quick&quot;, etc.\n&gt;\n&gt; There are =\r\nother ways of reducing test run time. For example, you could\n&gt; have\n&gt; a run=\r\nner that runs 1 second worth of the tests that have failed most\n&gt; recently =\r\nor a runner that runs half a second of recently failed tests plus\n&gt; half a =\r\nsecond of randomly selected tests.\n&gt;\n&gt; In the end I think the systemic solu=\r\ntion to test run times is to improve\n&gt; design and testing techniques to dra=\r\nmatically increase the assurance/CPU\n&gt; cycle ratio.\n&gt;\n&gt; I remember a friend=\r\n&#39;s story of an early project that used tests\n&gt; extensively.\n&gt; After three y=\r\nears they had a carefully tuned suite that took ten minutes\n&gt; to\n&gt; run. Whe=\r\nn the test runtime increased beyond ten minutes, they would work\n&gt; on\n&gt; the=\r\n design of the system and/or the design of the tests to improve the\n&gt; assur=\r\nance/CPU cycle ratio and get the runtime back under ten minutes. Then\n&gt; mos=\r\nt of the original team left.\n&gt;\n&gt; A few years later my friend was shown the =\r\nsystem. The programmer proudly\n&gt; explained that the test suites now took 24=\r\n hours to run, even though the\n&gt; system had grown little in functionality. =\r\nThey had stopped paying\n&gt; attention\n&gt; to designing for testability. Every t=\r\nime they added a new axis of\n&gt; variability they blindly ran the cross produ=\r\nct of the existing tests with\n&gt; all the alternatives for the new axis. Yes =\r\nthey had more tests, but A/C\n&gt; had\n&gt; dropped by several orders of magnitude=\r\n.\n&gt;\n&gt; In short, I see using classification to reduce test runtime as a band=\r\nage\n&gt; masking the real problem which is low A/C. Using classification to re=\r\nduce\n&gt; test runtime really is a hack and I hope people will continue workin=\r\ng to\n&gt; improve design for testability. We will still provide some classific=\r\nation\n&gt; mechanism, but that doesn&#39;t make it not a hack.\n&gt;\n&gt; Assumptions\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n The second reason I&#39;ve heard for classification is to avoid a slew of\n&gt; mi=\r\nsleadingly failing tests. If my development machine doesn&#39;t have access\n&gt; t=\r\no\n&gt; the database, then if I run the database tests I&#39;ll get a bunch of\n&gt; fa=\r\nilures\n&gt; even though the system is really working (or, to be more precise, =\r\nI don&#39;t\n&gt; have any information about whether the system is really working o=\r\nr not).\n&gt;\n&gt; Classification is one way to express assumptions. When I say &quot;@=\r\nTest(groups\n&gt; =3D\n&gt; {&quot;database&quot;})&quot; I have declared something about this tes=\r\nt. However, this\n&gt; expression seems limited and error-prone to me. I&#39;d pref=\r\ner to have the\n&gt; power\n&gt; of a programming language to express my assumption=\r\ns.\n&gt;\n&gt; In the JUnit 4.4 you can use assumeThat() to express assumptions. Fo=\r\nr\n&gt; example, you can say:\n&gt;\n&gt; public class DatabaseTest {\n&gt; @BeforeClass pu=\r\nblic static void isDatabaseAccessible() {\n&gt; User result=3D Database.login(&quot;=\r\nkent&quot;);\n&gt; assumeThat(not(isError(result));\n&gt; }\n&gt; ...\n&gt; }\n&gt;\n&gt; This is a bit =\r\nof a workaround because runner don&#39;t yet handle failed\n&gt; assumptions as any=\r\nthing other than successful tests, but it gives you a\n&gt; richer language to =\r\nexpress assumptions than a textual classification\n&gt; scheme.\n&gt;\n&gt; The Point\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; So now the point of this long post. Are there other uses of classificati=\r\non\n&gt; that I&#39;ve missed? Is the above way of expressing assumptions (or somet=\r\nhing\n&gt; derived from it like an explicit @Assumption) sufficient?\n&gt;\n&gt; Regard=\r\ns,\n&gt;\n&gt; Kent Beck\n&gt; Three Rivers Institute\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this me=\r\nssage have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n\n-- \nC=E9dric\n\n\n[Non-text portions of th=\r\nis message have been removed]\n\n\n",
