And\n&gt; Rick is a fellow kiwi!\n\nI didn&#39;t knew that he will publish a book. I will read\nit too.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; To become a master of JUnit it takes years of\n&gt; &gt; practice, although it is easy to learn the basics.\n&gt; \n&gt; Like most things.  I always remember the phrase on\n&gt; my\n&gt; Othello game  ... &quot;a moment to learn a lifetime to\n&gt; master&quot;\n\nYes. But it is not so common as one might think. There\nare frameworks, development processes and tools which\nare hard to learn and cannot be mastered... To make a\nthing simpler but not simple (like JUnit) requires a\nlot of intelligence and knowledge, which is not common.\n\n\n\t\t\nDiscover Yahoo! \nGet on-the-go sports scores, stock quotes, news and more.
