That was a different question, <br/>\nthough: which I believe was &quot;How do I run two test suites together?&quot; The <br/>\nOriginal Questioner wrote &quot;fixture&quot; for &quot;test suite&quot; and that is how <br/>\nthis all started.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow see, had you just asked me to clarify... but no, you ran with your <br/>\nassumptions and it led you entirely off course. Just ask! Just say, &quot;JB, <br/>\nI didn&#39;t see that on the JUnit web site...&quot; and then I can write &quot;That&#39;s <br/>\nnot what I meant...&quot; and this could have been civil.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ.
