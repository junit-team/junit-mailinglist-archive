Another example.. a while ago\n&gt;&gt;I was talking to Ivan Moore (of Jester fame) and he was saying that he\n&gt;&gt;had an idea for a tool that would go through your Java code and\n&gt;&gt;&#39;privitize&#39; it; that is, make all methods private that could be\n&gt;&gt;private.  In the spirit of the thing he was thinking of calling it\n&gt;&gt;Thatcher :-)  We were talking about it with a few other people who, like\n&gt;&gt;me, are very annoyed by the fact that private gets in the way when its\n&gt;&gt;in someone else&#39;s mangled code and you don&#39;t have the opportunity to\n&gt;&gt;peel it off, and we thought, well, wouldn&#39;t it be nice if your\n&gt;&gt;environment just told you which methods weren&#39;t used elsewhere in the\n&gt;&gt;system?  Sort of, &quot;this one could be private if you wanted it to be.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Michael,\n&gt;\n&gt;Very interesting.  Are you suggesting this tool would allow you to\n&gt;make more things private, or allow you to leave fewer things private,\n&gt;while still having the documentary benefit from the IDE of an &quot;only\n&gt;used locally&quot; marker?\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nYou could use it either way and as long as a language has private, \npeople would probably move to one or the other style.\n\nI think that the core issue behind all of this is what we choose to \nthink of as the program.  For languages like Java which are file-based, \nthat have representation outside the IDE, I suppose there will always be \npeople who want to see those semantics in the source.  The thing that is \ninteresting to consider, though, is that if our IDEs can infer this \ninformation, is there much merit in the idea of having the programmer \nspecify it?  Could it be enough to say, well, you can access whatever \nyou want, but the uses will be immediately apparent when people look at \nthe code.\n\nTyping &#39;private&#39; is a like a little ritual.  You are documenting a \ndecision.  But, if you have control over the code, you can &quot;untype&quot; it \nwhenever you want to.  This is pretty much the same as having the IDE \ninfer it for you.  The only way that private has teeth is when you don&#39;t \nhave control over the code that uses it.  And, as a guy who runs into \ntesting dilemmas all the time, I have to say that those teeth feel very \nsharp.\n\nOne way out of this might be to let IDEs manage private the way that \nEclipse manages imports.  I haven&#39;t thought that through yet.. might be \nneat though.\n\nMichael Feathers\nhttp://www.objectmentor.com\nhttp://michaelfeathers.typepad.com\n\n\n\n\n\n",
