My package \nstructure combined with my test cases naturally dictate my suite \nstructure. In order to run my tests I simply use a utility that I \nwrote to discover the tests in the packages. \n\nHas anyone else found the construction of test suites to be largely a \nwaste of time? IMO, if you use packages properly, then you should \nnever need to construct a test suite. \n\nFor instance, to find and run all the tests on my current project I \njust need to type the following at the command line.\n\njava MyTestFinder com\n\n&quot;com&quot; is the root package for the system. My utility then recursively \ngoes through the packages and runs all the test cases it can find. \n\nSo I can selectively test a particular package\n\njava MyTestFinder com.dotcomfailure.mycode\n\nOr... if you need to run a single test...\n\njava MyTestFinder com.dotcomfailure.mycode.SimpleTestCase\n\nRunning tests this way, I never have to worry about adding a main \nmethod to any of my test cases to run them. Also, I don&#39;t have to \nworry about maintaining TestSuites. The greatest benefit that I see \nis that when I run all the tests, I know without a doubt that every \nsingle test case in the entire system was run. I don&#39;t have to worry \nabout a test case not getting run b/c someone forgot to add it to a \ntest suite. \n\nI know Ant has the ability to find all tests, so anyone can take this \naproach. However, Ant finds test based on pattern matching, which can \nlead to problems b/c then a naming standard has to be enforced.\n\nI&#39;m new to this group, so let me know if this has already been \ndiscussed.\n\nRegards,\n\nMike\n\n\n",
