Of course, Java makes 100%<br/>\nreliability impossible, but it would seem that examining the classpath could<br/>\nallow some magic to be worked.  It would also seem the kind of problem that<br/>\nsomeone out there may have already solved.  Anyone have a pointer?

I&#39;d like to create a junit ant task that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; just runs on my whole codebase, but not all of my classes will have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; test methods and I&#39;ll get an error for each class that doesn&#39;t (and I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t want to have to explictily add each class to my build.xml file<br/>\n&gt; &gt; when I add a test).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If I were to try to tackle this, I&#39;d be looking at how the ANT JUnit<br/>\n&gt; runner is structured.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Very approximately, it is like this:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;junit&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   &lt;test&gt;<br/>\n&gt;     &lt;fileset /&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   &lt;/test&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;/junit&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The &lt;junit&gt; task runs all the tests handed to it by one or more &lt;test&gt;<br/>\n&gt; elements. The &lt;test&gt; elements get their input from one or more nested<br/>\n&gt; &lt;filesets&gt;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So rather than having JUnit /not/ filter out the non-tests, I&#39;d have<br/>\n&gt; that logic in either a custom subclass of &lt;test&gt; or a custom &lt;fileset&gt;<br/>\n&gt; - or maybe even a customer selector within the fileset.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Even if you don&#39;t sprinkle tests throughout your fileset, it&#39;s kinda<br/>\n&gt; lame that you have to select tests by doing pattern matching on a<br/>\n&gt; .class or .java filename. It&#39;s also error-prone as I have found out<br/>\n&gt; way too many times.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have often wanted to do something similar myself but have never<br/>\n&gt; gotten around to it.
