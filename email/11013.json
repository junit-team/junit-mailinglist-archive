While I agree with a lot of the<br/>\n&gt; JUnit philosophy, I  have one major concern with it.  Perhaps there<br/>\n&gt; are articles out there that address this, but I can&#39;t find any of<br/>\n&gt; them.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; As I look into JUnit, it seems that each class either has to do one<br/>\n&gt; of the following:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;       extend TestCase<br/>\n&gt;       implement Test. <br/>\n&gt;       extend some other class that implements Test. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; As we all know, Java doesn&#39;t support multiple inheritance.  You can<br/>\n&gt; only extend TestCase or you business class, but not both.  If you<br/>\n&gt; want to use JUnit with a derived class, it seems you have to<br/>\n&gt; implement a lot of methods from the TestCase interface -- which<br/>\n&gt; isn&#39;t practical.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What are some of the ways people use JUnit to test classes that are<br/>\n&gt; derived classes?   Are there splinter projects that address this<br/>\n&gt; deficiency?  Or is JUnit a poor fit for derived classes?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Put simply, what you propose to do goes entirely against JUnit&#39;s <br/>\nphilosophy, as well as the more general testing philosophies of the <br/>\nxUnit family of testing frameworks. Tests are tests and production code <br/>\nis production code.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy do you want a production class also to be a test? I think it&#39;s <br/>\ngenerally a very bad idea.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis brings up something I am struggling with: in C#/NUnit, we can <br/>\ndeclare a test without extending TestCase (even if we frequently extend <br/>\nAssert, anyway). Is there some great benefit to this over the way we do <br/>\nit in JUnit, SUnit, RubyUnit, PyUnit, ...?<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
