B. Rainsberger&quot; &lt;jbrains762@...&gt;\r\n\r\n&gt; &gt;Agreed; however, I find it nice to go on the assumption that a failure\n&gt; means\n&gt; &gt;my code is broken and an error means my test is broken. I wonder if not\n&gt; many\n&gt; &gt;people find this useful or if I&#39;m overstating how useful it can be.\n&gt;\n&gt; Interesting comment. What if the tested code throw a NullPointerException?\n&gt; You catch it and fail()? So All your tests contain try ..catch\nstuf...around\n&gt; tested method but not around asserts?\n\nI&#39;m not sure I understand your last comment, so let me try to address your\nquestion.\n\n&quot;What if the tested code throws a NullPointerException?&quot; There are two\npossibilities: I expect the exception or I do not. If I expect the\nexception, then I have a test that runs like this:\n\npublic void testA() {\n    try {\n        doSomething();\n        fail(&quot;How did I get here?!&quot;);\n    }\n    catch (NullPointerException success) {}\n}\n\nWe&#39;ve already talked for a long time about this coding pattern on this\nmailing list, so I state it &quot;without proof&quot; as a best practice.\n\nIf I do not expect the exception, then either my test or my code is broken.\nSince I don&#39;t want to debug, what I generally do is add a bunch of\nassertNotNull() statements into my tests to determine which reference is\nnull. Once I determine which reference is null, it is generally easy to\ndetermine whether the test or the code is broken. Specifically, I generally\nput stronger &quot;not null&quot; preconditions on the test to quickly rule out that\nthe test is broken. Also, it depends when I get the NullPointerException:\nwhat did I just write? the test or code? Usually that tells me.\n\nCan you clarify what you meant by your last statement? Why would I put\ntry/catch around an assertion?\n\nThanks.\n\nJBR.\n\n",
