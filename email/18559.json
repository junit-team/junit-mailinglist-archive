And good testing requires good requirements. Oh and I&#39;ve always wanted an excuse to pontificate on what I&#39;d like to tell some CIOs that I know. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nSimon (One of the JUnit list moderators)]<br/>\n<br/>\nHi, folks. &lt;&lt;Esther waves to the few people who may recognize her  <br/>\nfrom her various articles/publications&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m now senior online editor at CIO.com (and more invisibly at  <br/>\nCSOonline.com), where I can get into trouble in my very own blog  <br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blogs.cio.com/blog/37)\">http://blogs.cio.com/blog/37)</a>. I am, of course, still paying a lot  <br/>\nof editorial attention to the software development community. It&#39;s  <br/>\njust that now I have the ear of the boss.<br/>\n<br/>\nAmong the things that CIOs most desperately want to know -- really,  <br/>\nthey say this -- is what their development staff thinks, but doesn&#39;t  <br/>\nSAY. At least, the developer won&#39;t say it directly to the CIO or  <br/>\nother top management. So I&#39;m starting a series of articles about  <br/>\n&quot;what CIOs really need to know about...&quot; which will cover various  <br/>\ntopics. The first one is about software requirements.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy question to you is a very simple one. If you could get your CIO to  <br/>\nunderstand one thing, just ONE THING about software requirements,  <br/>\nwhat would it be?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then, the obvious follow-up: why did you pick *that*? War stories  <br/>\nto illustrate your point would be great.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can touch on anything to do with the software requirements  <br/>\nprocess; I&#39;m game for whatever you give me. It could be related to  <br/>\nsoftware testing or junit, but your pet peeve could appear anywhere  <br/>\nin the development process.<br/>\n<br/>\nIdeally I would quote you by name and company and location (&quot;Esther  <br/>\nSchindler is a senior developer at the Groovy Corporation in  <br/>\nScottsdale Arizona&quot;) but as long as you give me some kind of context  <br/>\nI&#39;m willing to work without one. That is, I do need some identifying  <br/>\ncharacteristics to give the article credibility (&quot;Esther works at a  <br/>\nlarge finance company in the Southwest&quot;) but I don&#39;t want you to lose  <br/>\nyour job when the CIO realizes that the developer quoted works for  <br/>\n*her*! &lt;grin&gt; So please be sure to let me know how to refer to you in  <br/>\nthe article.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll be sure to stop by here (as I expect others want to participate  <br/>\nin the conversation), but it&#39;d be great if you could send me a  <br/>\nprivate message. I don&#39;t want to miss any responses. Feply privately  <br/>\nif that&#39;s easier, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nI plan to work on this during the holiday and to collect responses  <br/>\nover the next week or so. I&#39;m hoping to publish the article on  <br/>\nCIO.com by mid-January at the latest.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo: what clue would you most like your CIO to get? about software  <br/>\nrequirements, that is?<br/>\n<br/>\nEsther Schindler<br/>\nsenior online editor<br/>\nCXO Media</div>",
