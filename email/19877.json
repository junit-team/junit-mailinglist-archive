If the method only has to be able to reverse one hard <br/>\n&gt;coded string, we don&#39;t really need to pass in that string:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    public String reverseTddSentence() {<br/>\n&gt;             return &quot;technology devolopment software a is Tdd&quot;;<br/>\n&gt;    }<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;But perhaps the real problem is that this is kind of a bogus <br/>\n&gt;requirement? Where is it coming from?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Cheers, Ilja<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I agree.
