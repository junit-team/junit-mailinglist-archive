The test class is checking the\n&gt; &gt; dependencies and=\r\n contents of the Maven artifacts produced by the build.\n&gt; &gt; I have some spe=\r\ncial build requirements which require me to use Maven\n&gt; &gt; Shade Plugin to b=\r\nundle external (and in one case also internal)\n&gt; &gt; dependencies into the sa=\r\nme JAR, and these build tests have been\n&gt; &gt; extremely helpful (more details=\r\n at the first episodes of\n&gt; &gt; http://www.orfjackal.net/lets-code#jumi).\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; https://github.com/orfjackal/jumi/blob/730378ddf5260cdcb44285c5c75e7=\r\na7ca5447407/end-to-end-tests/src/test/java/fi/jumi/test/BuildTest.java\n&gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; The first two tests are parameterized. They check each artifact for its=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; expected dependencies and contents.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The third test is checking=\r\n one of the artifacts which was checked\n&gt; &gt; already earlier, but this time =\r\na copy the JAR which which is embedded\n&gt; &gt; inside another JAR (it&#39;s used in=\r\n bootstrapping the application). Since\n&gt; &gt; this test is slow (~150ms), I wa=\r\nnt to avoid running it many times.\n&gt; &gt; Logically it&#39;s related to the things=\r\n checked by the parameterized tests,\n&gt; &gt; so I want to keep it close to them=\r\n, but it itself is not parameterized.\n&gt; &gt; Right now I&#39;ve solved the issue w=\r\nith a hack, so all but one\n&gt; &gt; parameterized execution skip the test.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; The fourth and fifth test are tests against all of the parameters. It&#39;s\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; testing the test data, to make sure that some project-wide principles\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; are followed (i.e. no visible dependencies to external libraries). These=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; tests also are not parameterized. Fortunately they are quick, so I\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n haven&#39;t tried to avoid running them many times.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; What are your sugg=\r\nestions for mixing parameterized and non-parameterized\n&gt; &gt; tests? Some crea=\r\ntive use of nested classes?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; Don&#39;t. Put them in separate classes in th=\r\ne same (test) package. It is\n&gt; normal to\n&gt; have one class in the system und=\r\ner test verified by several test classes;\n&gt; there\n&gt; is no rule that says th=\r\nere has to be a 1:1 correspondence.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve been thinking about ex=\r\ntending Parameterized so that I can annotate\n&gt; &gt; which methods are paramete=\r\nrized and which are not, by adding either\n&gt; &gt; @ParameterizedTest or @NonPar=\r\nameterized annotations to the test methods.\n&gt; &gt; The non-parameterized metho=\r\nds would be run only once, probably using the\n&gt; &gt; first element in the test=\r\n data (passing null to the constructor is\n&gt; &gt; another option; now it would =\r\nfail in the constructor, but I should\n&gt; &gt; anyways relocate the couple of me=\r\nthod calls which are now in the\n&gt; &gt; constructor).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; You are over-compli=\r\ncating the problem.
