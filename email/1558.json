If I had to <br/>\n    &gt; unit test<br/>\n    &gt; something like the controler, I would rather write own <br/>\n    &gt; mock implementations<br/>\n    &gt; of greeter and sender to test the controler: By doing so <br/>\n    &gt; I will have no<br/>\n    &gt; testing code in my production code. Does that seem too <br/>\n    &gt; much of an overhead,<br/>\n    &gt; or for what other reason is Eric Allen&#39;s approach more promising?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>As I said it all depends on your need.  Eric has offered a potential<br/>\nframework in a vacuum devoid of context called an article.  That is what<br/>\nwriters do.  The quote at the top is probably what makes this smell bad to<br/>\nyou.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Unit testing with JUnit can be a powerful way to ensure the integrity of<br/>\nyour code base, but some of the invariants are trickier to test than others<br/>\n-- method-invocation sequence is one of them.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it with a grain of salt.  If you find it is needed to test this way, go<br/>\nahead. But as you said, mock objects would *probably* be a better solution.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Jason</div>",
