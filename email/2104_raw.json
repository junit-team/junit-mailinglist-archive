In general, I think that using &quot;throws\nException&quot; is bad coding.\n\nHowever, from the standpoint of maintaining a testing framework,\nusing &quot;throws Exception&quot; might be acceptable.  When writing a test\nmethod the goal is to test a specific condition.  You can minimize\nyour work and maintenance by letting the JUint framework handle the\nthings that go wrong (catching exceptions and generating errors).\n\nIf you have twenty test methods that test the method &quot;aMethod&quot; and\neach of these methods has a throws clause identical to the throws\nclause in aMethod, whenever the throws clause for aMethod changes you\nhave twenty test methods to revise.  If each of your test methods\n&quot;throws Exception&quot;, a change in the throws clause of aMethod does not\naffect your test methods.\n\nMike\n\n\n\n--- dfw1@... wrote:\n&gt; --- In junit@y..., Mike Duffy &lt;mduffy_lists@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; I have only been using JUnit for a few months and I am focusing\n&gt; on\n&gt; &gt; creating &quot;best practices&quot; templates for our development team.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I would greatly appreciate the insight of more experienced users\n&gt; on\n&gt; &gt; the following issue.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Because an exception caught by the JUnit framework is an error,\n&gt; when\n&gt; &gt; testing a method that throws exceptions, it is best to include\n&gt; those\n&gt; &gt; exceptions in the throws clause of the test method (or even add a\n&gt; &gt; &quot;throws Exception&quot; to most test methods).  \n&gt; \n&gt; Hi Mike,\n&gt; \n&gt; My team at a previous job tried just adding &quot;throws Exception&quot; to\n&gt; all\n&gt; our test method footprints. The problem we hit was that other\n&gt; developers down the line would use our test code as example code\n&gt; when\n&gt; they reused the code we were testing. (Unit test code makes poor\n&gt; example code in so many ways, but was consistenty what the\n&gt; developers\n&gt; down line tried to use. That continued even when we provided\n&gt; example\n&gt; code.)\n&gt; \n&gt; I found it much better to list out all the exceptions that a test\n&gt; could possibly throw in the throws clause. It adds a tiny amount of\n&gt; overhead to writing the test code, but adds greatly to the\n&gt; awareness\n&gt; of just what can go wrong. Otherwise, people who use your code down\n&gt; line are likely to include &quot;throws Exception&quot; (or worse,\n&gt; catch(Exception ex)) in everything that uses your code. Also, it\n&gt; will\n&gt; tip you off to changes in the throws clauses in your code at\n&gt; compile\n&gt; time.\n&gt; \n&gt; Since then, I&#39;ve added a patch to junit that adds a fail(Exception)\n&gt; method to Assert. See\n&gt;\nhttp://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=435699&group_id=15278&atid=315278\n&gt; (I feel like I&#39;m plugging a book in a talk show interview. :) )\n&gt; \n&gt; I personally prefer having try-catch-finally blocks in my tests,\n&gt; and\n&gt; this patch lets me do it. That reserves junit errors for\n&gt; RuntimeExceptions and Errors, and still gives me a full stack\n&gt; trace. \n&gt; \n&gt; Not everyone will want to run a patched junit 3.7, so listing out\n&gt; each\n&gt; exception seems a reasonable technique.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; public void testMethod() throws Exception {\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;     returnValue = methodCall(args);\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;     assertTrue(some condition);\n&gt; &gt; }\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The following template would be less correct:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; public void testMethod() {\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;     try {\n&gt; &gt;         returnValue = methodCall(args);\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;     } catch (Exception e){\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;         fail(&quot;Exception should not be thrown: &quot; + e);\n&gt; &gt;     }\n&gt; &gt;      \n&gt; &gt;     assertTrue(some condition);\n&gt; &gt; }\n&gt; \n&gt; Don&#39;t forget that your assertTrue(some condition); can also throw\n&gt; exceptions, so these two blocks are not interchangable.\n&gt; \n&gt; I prefer\n&gt; \n&gt; public void testMethod() throws SomeExceptionThatMethodCallThrows\n&gt; {\n&gt; \ttry\n&gt; \t{\n&gt; \t\treturnValue = methodCall(args);\n&gt; \t\tassertTrue(some condition);\n&gt; \t}\n&gt; \tfinally\n&gt; \t{\n&gt; \t\t//any code to clean up the mess\n&gt; \t}\n&gt; }\n&gt; \n&gt; or (even better)\n&gt; \n&gt; public void testMethod()\n&gt; {\n&gt; \ttry\n&gt; \t{\n&gt; \t\treturnValue = methodCall(args);\n&gt; \t\tassertTrue(some condition);\n&gt; \t}\n&gt; \tcatch(SomeExceptionThatMethodCallThrows setmct)\n&gt; \t{\n&gt; \t\tfail(setmct);\n&gt; \t}\n&gt; \tfinally\n&gt; \t{\n&gt; \t\t//any code to clean up the mess\n&gt; \t}\n&gt; }\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; In general, test methods should be very lean and focus\n&gt; specifically\n&gt; &gt; on the condition being tested; let the framework handle the rest.\n&gt; \n&gt; so long as the code is easy to read, and encourages good practices\n&gt; down the line. I discourage &quot;throws Exception&quot;s anywhere I see\n&gt; them.\n&gt; \n&gt; Anyway, that&#39;s how I do it. Others take different approaches, and\n&gt; have\n&gt; reasons for it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Dave\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nMake international calls for as low as $.04/minute with Yahoo!
