It has a few quirks and\nisn&#39;t as popular as JMock but has some interesting\nfeatures that you might find useful. It seems to have\nslowed (in terms of active development) in recent times.\n\nCheers, Paul.\n\nDavid Saff wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On 12/1/06, Jeff Langr &lt;jeff@... \n&gt; &lt;mailto:jeff%40langrsoft.com&gt;&gt; wrote:\n&gt;  &gt; I experimented with one of the frameworks a good while ago. Still, I&#39;d\n&gt;  &gt; be happy to give a more recent version a try. Can you re-post a link\n&gt;  &gt; to one you recommend?\n&gt; \n&gt; All of my experience with any of the public tools has been with JMock.\n&gt; JMock 1, available from\n&gt; \n&gt; http://jmock.org &lt;http://jmock.org&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; has both the mocking library and the constraint library, with\n&gt; assertThat. In the next generation, the constraint library has been\n&gt; renamed to hamcrest, which is being developed independently:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://sourceforge.net/projects/hamcrest \n&gt; &lt;http://sourceforge.net/projects/hamcrest&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; A warning: hamcrest uses (but doesn&#39;t, I believe, require) generic\n&gt; types. I was one of several users pushing for this, but now that it&#39;s\n&gt; here, I have mixed feelings about it. I tend to believe the main\n&gt; issue isn&#39;t the generics themselves, but unnecessarily poor type\n&gt; inference from current compilers. This is an orthogonal issue, with\n&gt; the same kinds of benefits and drawbacks that would come from\n&gt; declaring assertEquals as\n&gt; \n&gt; public &lt;T&gt; void assertEquals(T expected, T actual).\n&gt; \n&gt; Have fun,\n&gt; \n&gt; David Saff\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n",
