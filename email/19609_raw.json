Setup all three projects in \nCruise Control.  Then set Project1 and Project2 to look at the build \nstatus file for APIProject.  In the Cruise Control main config.xml \nfiles, it looks like this:\n\n     &lt;project name=&quot;Project1&quot; &gt;\n         &lt;modificationset&gt;\n             &lt;buildstatus logdir=&quot;${cc.logs.dir}/apiproject&quot; /&gt;\n             &lt;cvs /&gt;\n         &lt;/modificationset&gt;\n          ...\n     &lt;/project&gt;\n\nThe &lt;cvs&gt; tag checks CVS for changes in Project1, the buildstatus tag \nchecks for changes in the build status of apiproject.  This creates a \nbuild trigger based on source code changes to Project1 as well as a \ndependency on apiproject changes.\n\nNote: the cvs and project tags are somewhat abbreviated due to what \nCruise Control calls &quot;plugins&quot; which are just common setup in the \nbeginning of the config.xml file so the project description themselves \ndo not have so much redundant setup.\n\nRobert Kuropkat\n\n\ntripdavid wrote:\n&gt; *This message was transferred with a trial version of CommuniGate(tm) Pro*\n&gt; What is the best approach for handing a situation where a project\n&gt; exists that represents an API to other projects? \n&gt; \n&gt; For example: Project1 and Project2 are separate projects which depend\n&gt; on apiproject. \n&gt; \n&gt; Changes are made to apiproject, such that the tests within apiproject\n&gt; pass. \n&gt; \n&gt; But, those changes would now break project1 and project2. \n&gt; \n&gt; Would the solution be:\n&gt; a) when changes are made to apiproject, automatically fire off the\n&gt; tests for dependent projects (in this case Project1 and Project2)?\n&gt; \n&gt; b) Plan to run tests at periodic intervals of Project1 and Project2,\n&gt; so that eventually, the break will become apparent? \n&gt; \n&gt; We plan to use CruiseControl to do automated builds and tests. Just\n&gt; not sure how we can know when code in an api (subproject?) will break\n&gt; the dependent projects. \n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks!\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo!
