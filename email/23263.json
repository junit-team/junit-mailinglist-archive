That<br/>\nway, we could start with the most popular ideas, and iterate on clean<br/>\npatches for those, once you could be sure that the effort wouldn&#39;t be<br/>\nwasted.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope that addresses your concerns.  Let me know,<br/>\n<br/>\n   David Saff<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Mon, Feb 14, 2011 at 3:47 AM, mguillemot &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mguillemot@...\">mguillemot@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Hi David,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; not really the most motivating answer :-(<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Providing a clean patch requires time.
