From the sounds of your initial\npost, it sounds that possibly you intend to write many tests at once\n[&quot;..code the skeleton..with the methods..then write the tests..&quot;].  There is\na fundamental rule of TDD to write one and only one failing test at a time\nand make that pass before moving on to the next test.  This is important\nbecause it will encourage you to constantly refactor, enabling your brain to\nevolve a much cleaner overall design as you go.  In addition, this tends to\nmake the task of &quot;getting the test to compile&quot; much less tedious, as you\nwill need to add at the very most only a single class and a single method.\nHope that helps.\n  -- MB\n\nOn 10/30/06, J.

I guess\n&gt; &gt; you could code in all the skeleton of the class, with the methods &\n&gt; &gt; such (though this won&#39;t compile unless you really do return what you\n&gt; &gt; say you will), then write the tests, then add the rest of the code.\n&gt; &gt; But I don&#39;t see the great advantage of that, to be honest...\n&gt;\n&gt; I write the test, then use Eclipse to generate classes, interfaces and\n&gt; method stubs as I go. When the test compiles, I run it to watch it fail.\n&gt; This way I know my test actually tests /something/. Only then do I make\n&gt; it pass.\n&gt;\n&gt; When I do this, I get the opportunity to see my code in black and white\n&gt; on the screen. I get to ask myself, &quot;Is the design any good?&quot; or more\n&gt; correctly, &quot;Does the design suck in an obvious way?&quot; I&#39;m surprised how\n&gt; often it does. :) It&#39;s often not until I have to /use/ the API that I\n&gt; realize it sucks.\n&gt;\n&gt; So that&#39;s how I do it. I tried writing the skeleton code, then writing\n&gt; the test, but I found I couldn&#39;t easily enough track in my head the code\n&gt; I needed for the test I wanted to write, so I decided to let the test\n&gt; pull the code out of me. It works for me.\n&gt;\n&gt; Take care.\n&gt; --\n&gt; J. B.
