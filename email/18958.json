I&#39;ve thought in the past that I&#39;d<br/>\nlike at least three different organizational schemes for my tests:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) By class tested<br/>\n2) By functionality tested<br/>\n3) By order of creation*<br/>\n<br/>\nYou bring out possibly yet another:<br/>\n<br/>\n4) By intent<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps 3 and 4 are similar.  I&#39;ve thought in the past it should be<br/>\npossible to do all of this by thinking hard about how I lay out my<br/>\ntests, but I now think that, at least, 3 and 4 lead to a different<br/>\norganization than 1 and 2.  Do you think that JUnit could help with<br/>\nthis, or would the first step be in an IDE?<br/>\n<br/>\n   David Saff<br/>\n<br/>\n* I&#39;m always reminded of a scene from High Fidelity in which John<br/>\nCusack&#39;s character re-sorts his record collection in &quot;autobiographical<br/>\norder&quot;--that is, the order in which he bought them.</div>",
