OCL is easier for business\n&gt; users, but we still get the java performance.\n&gt; \n&gt; Then it&#39;s just a matter of adding more test generation\n&gt; templates for design validation.\n&gt; \n&gt; I hope to have a proof of concept soon. Just need\n&gt; another 48 hours in the day :-)\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; - Ole\n&gt; \n&gt; --- &quot;James P.

Burn them!\n&gt;  &gt; :-). So, separating test and design is all to the\n&gt;  &gt; good. We have a well\n&gt;  &gt; established design methodology, and (relatively\n&gt;  &gt; good) tool support for\n&gt;  &gt; design.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Where I see the biggest lack of support in testing\n&gt;  &gt; tools is a formal,\n&gt;  &gt; semi-automated way to generate test stubs for\n&gt;  &gt; requirements checking. I\n&gt;  &gt; would love to be able to extract from a structured\n&gt;  &gt; requirements document\n&gt;  &gt; and generate a slew of test stubs for those\n&gt;  &gt; requirements. I just got bit\n&gt;  &gt; in the butt today, by an untested class invariant:\n&gt;  &gt; it was specified in\n&gt;  &gt; the design docs, but never implemented in the test\n&gt;  &gt; code. (Bad Programmer\n&gt;  &gt; - no biscuit!) We&#39;ve been playing around with the\n&gt;  &gt; notion of a tool to\n&gt;  &gt; read the structured English requirements, and\n&gt;  &gt; automatically extract the\n&gt;  &gt; test stubs, but haven&#39;t had the time to make any\n&gt;  &gt; real progress.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; I agree that there are at least two large\n&gt;  &gt; stake-holders on the JUnit\n&gt;  &gt; group, those who do test driven DESIGN, and those\n&gt;  &gt; who do test driven\n&gt;  &gt; DEVELOPMENT, and I think that both need to be\n&gt;  &gt; supported.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Jim\n&gt;  &gt; J. B. Rainsberger wrote:\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; I&#39;m beginning to wonder whether we should have\n&gt;  &gt; separate design and\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; testing tools. This seems to be a serious source\n&gt;  &gt; of contention among\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; programmers: we call it testing, but we mean\n&gt;  &gt; design, and when we do\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; design, testing is a secondary consideration, and\n&gt;  &gt; yet testing is important.\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; Rather than repackaging TDD and calling it BDD,\n&gt;  &gt; hoping that Sapir-Whorf\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; will save us from our own sloppiness, maybe it&#39;s\n&gt;  &gt; time for separate tools\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; for design and testing. I have no idea how that\n&gt;  &gt; would work, but perhaps\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; it would help us all get along.\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; So I&#39;d like a way to separate my design and\n&gt;  &gt; testing activities when I do\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; TDD. For example, when I test-drive behavior that\n&gt;  &gt; doesn&#39;t yet exist, I&#39;m\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; almost always designing; but when I fill in the\n&gt;  &gt; holes by adding a test\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; for a case that should already pass, I&#39;m testing.\n&gt;  &gt; Perhaps it would be\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; better to separate those somehow.\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; Any ideas?\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; --\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; J.
