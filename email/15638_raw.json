Hyatt Regency Hotel, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.\n\nhttp://www.agile2006.com\n\nSubmission deadlines:\n- January 31, 2006:  Discovery Session, Experience Reports, Hands-on\n   Sessions, Tutorials\n- February 28, 2006:  Research Papers, Educators&#39; Symposium\n\nAgile 2006 will be an exciting conference about techniques and\ntechnologies, attitudes and policies, research and experience, and the\nmanagement and development sides of agile software development. The \nagile approach focuses on delivering business value early in the project\nlifetime and being able to incorporate emergent requirements. It\naccentuates the use of rich, informal communication channels and \nfrequent delivery of running, tested systems, while attending to the \nhuman component of software development.\n\nAgile 2006 gives attendees access to the latest thinking in this domain,\nand bridges communities that rarely get a proper chance to exchange \nideas and thoughts. It brings together researchers from labs and \nacademia with executives, managers, and developers in the trenches of \nsoftware development. The conference is not about a single methodology \nor approach, but rather provides a forum for the exchange of information \nregarding all agile development technologies.\n\nWe invite submissions for the following:\n\n**Research paper\nAn original contribution to the field of agile development. These\nsubmissions have the potential to promote reflection in the field, to\ndeepen our understanding of agile approaches, to influence future\ndevelopments, and to inspire innovation.\n\n**Educators&#39; Symposium\nA one-day event targeted particularly for agile educators. Sessions here\nmay take a variety of forms, such as papers, panels and activities.\n\n**Experience Report\nAn opportunity to describe what did or didn&#39;t work for you on a project.\nExperience reports allow practitioners to share practical advice and\nwarnings to other teams.  The proposal is a short summary of your\nexperience which will result in a paper presentation at the conference.\n\n**Discovery Session\nAn opportunity for conference attendees to learn from each other about a\nrelevant topic and share the concrete outcomes after the session. These \n90 or 180 minute sessions may take several formats including a think \ntank, a goldfish bowl or a workshop.\n\n**Tutorial\nAn opportunity for an expert to share knowledge with others through a\ncombination of lecture and exercise. Tutorials may be either 90 or 180\nminutes.\n\n**Hands-on session\nAn all-day or multi-day event during which participants are encouraged \nto drop in and stay from one hour to all day to work hands-on developing\nsoftware. In past years, hands-on events featured the FIT Fest, which\nprovided opportunities to use FIT and FitNesse.\n\nWatch the Agile 2006 website for details--to be posted soon!\n\nhttp://www.agile2006.com\n\n\n\n\n\n",
