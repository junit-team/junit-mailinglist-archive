I don&#39;t mind a bit that yo=\r\nu&#39;ve \nselectively replied - any help is most welcome!\n\nGet/Set tests are a =\r\npain, but I can indeed see that they&#39;re useful. \nIn fact, they turned up tw=\r\no of the issues that JUnit&#39;s found for me, \nby exposing copy/paste errors. =\r\nI haven&#39;t seen TestUtil before, but it \nsounds interesting - I&#39;ll have a lo=\r\nok at that. Have you used it \nyourself?\n\nThe classes and methods (outside t=\r\nhe get/sets) are indeed typically \nquite large. Some of this is just becaus=\r\ne the DTO, Domain object and \nBean perforce contain all the properties and =\r\ntheir get/sets, which \nseems unavoidable to me. \nBut the Service classes an=\r\nd their methods are also large - For \nexample, a service update method woul=\r\nd contain code to check the \nvalues the user passes in, convert the incomin=\r\ng values to the proper \nformat, obtain the object they want to update, upda=\r\nte that with each \nvalue passed in, validate the updated object, apply any =\r\nrules to it, \nand return a message or a generated SOAPBean. These chunks of=\r\n work \nare typically extracted into separate methods, (at least, they are i=\r\nn \nmy code, so I can both reuse them and only test them once) but even \nso,=\r\n they&#39;re considerably larger than 10 lines...\nSounds like this is an area w=\r\ne should look into in more detail - \nthank you!\n\nWe are indeed not doing TD=\r\nD, basically because we don&#39;t know how! The \noriginal aim was to work that =\r\nway, but nobody could see how to do it. \nThank you for the link to the Sque=\r\nak code - I will have a look at \nthat, and hopefully it&#39;ll give us some poi=\r\nnters.\n\nThank very much for your help,\nCheers\nTracey\n\n\n\n\n",
