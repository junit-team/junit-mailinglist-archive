When you are\n&gt;&gt; interested in speed of long running, server side software, start-up\n&gt;&gt; and warm-up time are quite uninteresting...\n&gt; \n&gt; The test in question measured none of these things.  It\n&gt; measured one compute-bound activity repeated millions of\n&gt; times.  I believe that any optimizations would have occurred\n&gt; in the first few iterations.\n\nI wouldn&#39;t be too sure about it. I once observed a long-running XSL\ntransformation (done with Xalan) to still become faster at the tenth\nrun. And the difference to the first run was in the dimension of a\nfactor of 100.\n\nAnyway, what I actually wanted to say is that the meaning of &quot;run them\nunder exactly the same conditions&quot; can heavily depend on what you want\nto try to measure.\n\n&gt;  Java programs are slowed down\n&gt; by interpretation and layers of abstraction.\n\nAnd they are speeded up by runtime compilation and optimization.\n\n&gt; In this particular case, when asked, I said that a decent\n&gt; test would take quite some time to devise.\n\nYes. I didn&#39;t mean to criticize your test, just your general statement\nas quoted above.\n\nNo hard feelings, Ilja\n\n\n",
