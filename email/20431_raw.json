I see that you have created Feature\nRequests on Sourceforge, but I can&#39;t see any associated patch. I think\nthat might be a good place to start.\n\nIn my experience, very few open source projects grant write access to\nthe version control system willy-nilly. Instead, people create\nrelationships with the existing development team by submitting\npatches, having a discussion with the dev team about improvements /\nwhy the patch was rejected and so on, until eventually the contributor\nmay be deemed worthy of becoming a fully-fledged committer on the\nproject. I would imagine JUnit has a similar tradition, although of\ncourse any of the existing development team are free to point out any\nmisconception I have here.\n\nCheers,\n\nJames\n\n",
