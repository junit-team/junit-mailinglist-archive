That means that they have tests,\n&gt; &gt; and damn good ones. As a result, a method like this can&#39;t break on its\n&gt; &gt; own:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; if myCollection.size &lt; 20\n&gt; &gt;     myCollection.sortWith(SortAlgorithms.bubbleSort)\n&gt; &gt; else if myCollection.size &lt; 100\n&gt; &gt;     myCollection.sortWith(SortAlgorithms.quickSort)\n&gt; &gt; else\n&gt; &gt;     myCollection.sortWith(SortAlgorithms.mergeSort)\n&gt; &gt; end\n&gt; \n&gt; There&#39;s a way the method can break: e.g. if the merge sort implementation\n&gt; does not work with collections under a certain size (precondition) \n&gt; and the threshold in the sort method was chosen incorrectly. \n\nThis is a very fine line, Johannes. It is reasonable to assume that a sort \nmethod, in general, works on collections of any size; otherwise, it should be \nnamed something other than &quot;sort&quot;. Perhaps it should be \nnamed &quot;sortCollectionsOfSizeLessThanTwenty&quot;. This is a design issue; not a \ntesting issue.\n\nIf the bubbleSort algorithm doesn&#39;t work with collections smaller than twenty \nitems, then it&#39;s bubbleSort that&#39;s broken, not this method. That was my \noriginal point.\n\n&gt; Or the changed\n&gt; implementation of merge sort changed the threshold. The underlying \n&gt; pre- and postconditions can change without noticing as long as they \n&gt; are not formalized and proven to hold.\n\nI don&#39;t think these are likely to happen in a sort method. The underlying \nassumption I made is that &quot;sort&quot; works: that is, it works for any collection \nof any size and any kinds of objects that can be compared with each other for \nordering. If that&#39;s not true, then I would probably need Learning Tests to \ncodify the unexpected pre- and post-conditions -- those would be tests on the \nsort algorithms, though, and not necessarily on my method. :)\n\nIf I really needed to test my method, I&#39;d change the design so that the sort \nalgorithms can easily be mocked; then I&#39;d write tests that ensured that the \nmethod tried to call the appropriate sort algorithm on the appropriate \nconditions.\n\n&gt; But probably you are right and the sort example is not as good as I thought\n&gt; in the beginning. So I declare myself defeated until I come up with \n&gt; an example that makes sense as is and not only when considered in an \n&gt; abstract way.\n\nI&#39;m happy to see it when you come up with it. I don&#39;t always practice what I \npreach, because I&#39;m not good enough at it yet. More examples to try to \nunderstand would help. :) I just notice a bunch of duplicated tests in my \ncurrent projects; I&#39;d like to remove that duplication.\n--\nJ. B.
