I eliminate remote object method calls with\nmocks, and local method calls (to public/protected methods of the same\nclass) by overriding them in an anonymous inner class declared in my test\nmethod.  Obviously I can&#39;t override a private method.\n\n \n\nI think the solution is to refactor the private method such that it can be\neither eliminated (by extracting a public/protected parent method that can\nbe overriden) or tested along with the method under test (by supporting some\nform of mock object injection).  \n\n \n\nDoes this sound reasonable?\n\n \n\n-Mitch\n\n  _____  \n\nFrom: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of Jeff\nGrigg\nSent: Monday, October 31, 2005 10:36 AM\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: [junit] Re: Private method throws an exception\n\n \n\n&gt;&gt; --- mitchellch60 wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; My method under test calls a private method in the same\n&gt;&gt;&gt; class.
