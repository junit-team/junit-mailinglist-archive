You<br/>\ncan code all 4 things in the same test case and use an<br/>\nassert condition between each step.  You wouldn&#39;t need<br/>\nto create a test method for each of theses steps<br/>\nunless one step is actually worth testing stand alone.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the later case you can create a test method for<br/>\nretreive, delete and create.  When you code the create<br/>\ntest you will call the retreive test method to verify<br/>\nthat the create worked.  If you want to clean up the<br/>\ndata that was created you can cap the hole test off<br/>\nwith a call to the delete test.<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Thomas Rynne<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:thomas.rynne-yahoo-groups@...\">thomas.rynne-yahoo-groups@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Hi, I&#39;ve just started using jUnit and I&#39;m unsure how<br/>\n&gt; it should be used<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m testing invoking a method on an object. I want<br/>\n&gt; to test that the method <br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t throw any errors, and objects were added to<br/>\n&gt; several lists.<br/>\n&gt; Do I<br/>\n&gt; 1) invoke the method in setUp and have methods<br/>\n&gt; testNoErrors, <br/>\n&gt; testAddedToList1, testAddedToList2 and a tearDown<br/>\n&gt; method which cleans up the affects of the setUp<br/>\n&gt; method.<br/>\n&gt; 2) keep the same test methods but invoke the method<br/>\n&gt; in each test method<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m also having problems with test dependencies. For<br/>\n&gt; example, I have a <br/>\n&gt; create, retrieve and a delete methods. In order to<br/>\n&gt; test that the create <br/>\n&gt; method is working I have to use the retrieve method.<br/>\n&gt; In order to clean up <br/>\n&gt; after I need to use the delete method.<br/>\n&gt; Any of these could fail but I&#39;m only testing one. If<br/>\n&gt; create does fail <br/>\n&gt; retrieve can&#39;t be tested because I need create to<br/>\n&gt; work to add test data to <br/>\n&gt; retrieve. How do people usually get over this?<br/>\n&gt; thanksThomas<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
