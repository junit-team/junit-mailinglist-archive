In the past, although\nunder-documented, the policy has been that the order in which test\nmethods within a test class are run is undefined.  In practice, it has\nbeen left to the JDK implementation, which has usually ended up\nmeaning the tests are run in bytecode order, and almost always been a\nstable ordering.\n\nJDK 7 (and, I believe, upcoming releases of JDK 6) changes this, by\nhaving the methods returned from reflective queries in essentially\nrandom order.\n\nIt will always be my belief that proper use of JUnit results in test\nmethods whose passing or failure does not depend on ordering.  That\nsaid, it can be very frustrating to have a test break because the JDK\nselected a particular random ordering, and then have little or no tool\nsupport in recreating the order that triggers the failure.\n\nSo, accepting this patch will mean that the ordering of methods will\nno longer change from run to run, even if you change or upgrade JDKs.\nUnfortunately, it may change the ordering once--if we put this change\ninto 4.11, say, then teams using current versions of JDK 6 that\nupgrade from 4.10 to 4.11 may find their tests now running in a\ndifferent stable ordering than before.  I think this is a small price\nas a one-time cost.\n\nMore disconcerting to me would be if I started seeing test cases with\nmethod names like aaaRunMeFirst.\n\nThoughts?\n\n   David Saff\n\n",
