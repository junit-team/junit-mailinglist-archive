I understand you are\n&gt;currently doing this as an exercise, so it&#39;s healthy to take it to\n&gt;extremes and do everything by the book in order to learn, but in your\n&gt;real work, use your judgment and decide for yourself when you are\n&gt;indeed writing too much code, in which case it&#39;s probably safer to go\n&gt;the usual route (get your code to work, then write tests for it).\n&gt;\n&gt;The downside of TDD is that you can end up writing a lot of tests for\n&gt;business code that you quickly throw away and rewrite, so the amount\n&gt;of churn can be quite high.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nI haven&#39;t seen that. Maybe we are doing things differently.\n\nOne thing that is underemphasized in all of this, though, is TDD&#39;s \neffect on design. When you write tests after the fact it&#39;s easier to end \nup with classes that are rather monolithic. An example, close to this \nlist: I wrote a tool a while back which shows the internal dependency \nstructure of classes. I ran it on a version of JUnit and the pictures \nare small and balanced. Most of the classes have roughly the same amount \nof internal structure. Afterwards, I ran it on TestNG and I noticed that \nsome of the classes are rather large and they contain a lot of internal \nstructure.\n\nI&#39;m not saying this is good or bad, JUnit and TestNG have different \nimplementation styles. In any case, I don&#39;t think that a class like your \nTestRunner in TestNG, would look the same if it was implemented \nincrementally via TDD.\n\nMichael Feathers\nwww.objectmentor.com\n\n\n\n\n\n",
