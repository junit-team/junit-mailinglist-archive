But it&#39;s maybe because I \ndon&#39;t stick to this principle.\n\nIn many cases, the simplest thing that works is #ifdef ... #endif (in \nC++).  Well I let you imagine how a code may look like after several \nyears of #ifdef... #endif!\n\nYou can argue that you should refactor... well unless someone has a \n_real_ good reason to spend time refactoring something that works \nperfectly, he would rather do other things that don&#39;t currently work.\n\n &gt; However, the specialized Assert class (i.e.-delegation) appears to be \nmore\n\n&gt; flexible and easier to change in the future. It also seems to better communicate \n&gt; the purpose of the new class.\n\n\nIf you extend the TestCase class, you can use your assertion in the \nsubclass.  But you cannot use your assertion in an ExceptionTestCase, \nTestDecorator, TestSetup subclass unless you have created as specialized \nTestCase for that particular TestCase class.\n\nMy personal thoughts\n\n-Vladimir\n\n\n-- \nVladimir Bossicard\nwww.bossicard.com\n\n\n",
