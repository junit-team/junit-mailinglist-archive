I have a question for u people.<br/>\n&gt; I have a method which overwrites value of a private variable. This<br/>\n&gt; method is public and I need to test that method. Is it ok to set the<br/>\n&gt; value of the private var using reflection and then check the method<br/>\n&gt; in the test case ?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>When you ask, &quot;Is it OK?&quot; in what way do you think it might not be OK?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat you propose works, because it tests what you want to test: &quot;Does my <br/>\nmethod properly write the expected value to the expected field?&quot; There <br/>\nare, however, certain drawbacks to this approach. Still, so much depends <br/>\non your goals, so I&#39;ll ask again, but differently: what are you afraid <br/>\nof that might /not/ be OK with what you&#39;re proposing?<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
