Yikes!  It is very confusing about how to<br/>\n&gt; start and how to set up an application level test suite that will touch all<br/>\n&gt; the classes.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>- Forget about strictly applying XP and test-first concept.  Don&#39;t write <br/>\ntests for a class if you don&#39;t need to.<br/>\n- Start from the top.  I imagine that your application is somewhat <br/>\nrunning: First write some general tests that exercise the application or <br/>\nuse reports from your QA.  Once you have discovered a class with <br/>\npotential bugs, try to test your class. If you can&#39;t write tests, you <br/>\nmay have to refactor the class (and write tests before refactoring)<br/>\n- maybe JUnit is too &quot;unit-centered&quot; to help you.  Have a look at <br/>\ncommercial products (TestMentor by SylverMark or others): they may <br/>\nenable you to faster cover your application with several testing methods <br/>\n(and not only unit testing).<br/>\n- by analysing your code and report some metrics (complexity, <br/>\ninheritence, coupling...), you may be able to guess the classes that are <br/>\nthe mose likely to be bugged (have a look at JDepend from Mike Clark)<br/>\n<br/>\nThese are only guesses since I never faced a similar situation (in Java) <br/>\nbut it would be _really_ interesting to have some kind of &quot;How to <br/>\nsurvive a not tested project&quot; article.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Vladimir<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nVladimir Bossicard<br/>\nwww.bossicard.com</div>",
