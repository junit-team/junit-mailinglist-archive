The same seems to happen to many developers under t=\r\nhe\nheat of a challenging deadline. When I interviewed candidates in the pas=\r\nt, I\npay close attention to if they mention TDD or automated unit testing. =\r\nIf\nthey don&#39;t mention it themselves, I ask. That is because I believe it is=\r\n one\nof most important (perhaps THE most important) development skills. I a=\r\nlso\nask a lot of questions regarding test case identification.\n\nIt has been=\r\n a long time since I was on an interview which asked me to write\ncode. Howe=\r\nver, the last interview I was on, I was presented with a code\nsample and as=\r\nked what was wrong with it. It was a single function, spanning\nthree printe=\r\nd pages, with a &quot;bug&quot; somewhere in it. I told the interviewer\nthat the prob=\r\nlem was there were no unit tests, and the code was not clearly\nwritten - af=\r\nter fixing those two things, the bug should be obvious.\n\nIt&#39;s easy to forge=\r\nt these things during an interview. Developer interviews\nthat I have seen t=\r\nend to focus on specific developer experiences, such as\nfamiliarity with sp=\r\necific languages or technologies, or knowledge of a\ncertain domain. It is e=\r\nasy for the interviewer and candidate to get lost in\nthese details and forg=\r\net good practices. I think this focus is generally a\nmistake. I think the f=\r\nocus should be on demonstrating experience with good\ndevelopment practices,=\r\n good design, testing, well-written code, along with a\ndesire to learn and =\r\ngrow as a developer on a team.\n\nCheers,\nDennis\n\nOn Sat, May 1, 2010 at 9:17=\r\n AM, Mike Forsberg &lt;bigmike.f@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; This may be better i=\r\nn a blog post, which I will hopefully get to...\n&gt; but I&#39;d like to pose two =\r\nquestions to the group first.
