I&#39;ll leave aside discussion that you can&#39;t\n&gt;&gt;always isolate components from the infrastructure because it is a\n&gt;&gt;separate topic and in fact quite achievable in my opinion.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;  Now, for each isolated unit of code we have an unit test. When\n&gt;&gt;application size grows complexity of unit tests would grow linearly and\n&gt;&gt;not exponential and as a result close to 100% test coverage is not any\n&gt;&gt;more difficult to achieve for large codebase then for a small codebase.\n&gt; \n&gt; I guess it depends what you mean by &quot;code coverage&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; If you mean &quot;that segment of code was run by at least one test&quot;, then yes,\n&gt; it&#39;s not &quot;too hard&quot; (albeit still sometimes too complex to be worth the\n&gt; trouble).\n&gt; \n&gt; If you mean &quot;all possible paths of execution have been tested&quot;, then it&#39;s\n&gt; clearly impossible because it&#39;s exponential with the number of branches in\n&gt; your code (see &quot;cyclomatic complexity&quot;).\n\n   &quot;all possible paths&quot; coverage referred at \nhttp://www.bullseye.com/coverage.html#basic_path is obviously not only \n  difficult to cover and but also unpractical to verify.\n\n   I would say that &quot;condition&quot; or &quot;branch&quot; coverage variants would \ngive quite acceptable outcome in most of the cases. This is sort of \nsimilar to the concept of unit testing where each condition \nprectically interpreted as an individual unit.\n   See http://www.bullseye.com/coverage.html#basic_condition\n   If I am not mistaken this sort of coverage idea is used in an \nopposide direction by Agitator tool that Kent Beck somehow involved to.\n\n   Not to mention, of course, that method with high degree of \ncomplexity can be broken into individually testable units... :-)\n\n   regards,\n   Eugene\n\n\n",
