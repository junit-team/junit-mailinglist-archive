This\n&gt;  &gt; wouldn&#39;t be expecting the exception, and so would presumably fail if\n&gt; \n&gt; Which, if I&#39;m not mistaken, would require...  dependent methods (being able\n&gt; to order the tests).\n\nYou are mistaken. :) It wouldn&#39;t require it; I don&#39;t mind if both tests \nfail for the same reason, although I might be concerned if 10 tests \nfailed for the same reason. In the latter case, there&#39;s a design issue I \nneed to work on.\n\n&gt;  &gt; I personally don&#39;t like expecting exceptions in tests because I wish\n&gt;  &gt; to verify the state of the exception, but each to their own...\n&gt; \n&gt; It seems to be more an exception than a rule, but you can always stick to\n&gt; the try/catch approach if you really need that.\n&gt; \n&gt; What &quot;state&quot; do you usually check on your exceptions?  Except for the\n&gt; message (which is probably not a good idea since you need to plan for\n&gt; internationalization), there is not much in that object, unless you make\n&gt; heavy use of your own exceptions (not a very common occurrence in my\n&gt; experience).\n\nIndeed. I used to do that a lot, but now I don&#39;t. I think I found that \nall those custom exception classes weren&#39;t worth the effort.\n-- \nJ. B.
