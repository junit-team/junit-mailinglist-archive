I have been running JUnit 3.2 \nvery successfully for some time now. Thought it might be time to \nupgrade. However, in a project I am currently working on, I&#39;ve found \nthat tests that run just fine under 3.2 (non-loading runner) will not \nrun under 3.4. Furthermore, when I use the LoadingTestRunner under \n3.2 I seem to be getting the same (or similar) problem. Namely, I get \na &quot;Could not invoke suite() method&quot; error.\n\nThe only thing I can think of is that since the TestRunners have been \nre-factored under 3.4 and the separation between loading and non-\nloading is gone, that perhaps there is something in the class loader \nthat is causing this.\n\nHas anyone experienced similar troubles?\n\nThanks.\n\nChris\n\n\n\n",
