I would expect it to be somethi=\r\nng more\n&gt;&gt; &gt; than a way of avoiding that kind of boilerplate.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I just =\r\nexplained that in my previous reply. When the boilerplate that is\n&gt;&gt; avoide=\r\nd is so excessive, the syntactic sugar itself becomes a valuable\n&gt;&gt; feature=\r\n.\n&gt;\n&gt; I really don&#39;t perceive that as excessive boilerplate. YMMV.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; A=\r\ns an example of the kind of thing I think a class rule would enable,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; i=\r\ns that it might allow the rule to dynamically pass values to the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; test =\r\nclass&#39;s constructor based on some dynamic criteria (say a souped\n&gt;&gt; &gt; up ve=\r\nrsion of Parameterized)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; No. Test class instantiation occurs per-metho=\r\nd, not per-class, thus\n&gt;&gt; class-level is not where it can be changed.\n&gt;\n&gt; T=\r\nest instantiation is yes, but I would expect a ClassRule to provide a hook =\r\ninto the instance generation process (although for the whole class, not eac=\r\nh case at a time).\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; or perhaps change the runner that will run the te=\r\nsts,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; No. The Runner is what invokes the rules, so rules can&#39;t change =\r\nthe runner.\n&gt;\n&gt; Just like the ExpectedException rule intercepts the Stateme=\r\nnt and replaces it with its own, a ClassRule can intercept the Runner and r=\r\neplace it with its own (possibly).\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Something that is not possible wi=\r\nth an @BeforeClass\n&gt;&gt; &gt; or @AfterClass annotation.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The ability to pac=\r\nkage a common class-level setup/teardown behaviour and\n&gt;&gt; re-use it in many=\r\n places is what rules provide over embedded\n&gt;&gt; before/after methods. That&#39;s=\r\n very useful by itself, and they don&#39;t have\n&gt;&gt; to do anything more to justi=\r\nfy their existence.\n&gt;\n&gt; Hmm, I guess we have to agree to disagree on that o=\r\nne.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
