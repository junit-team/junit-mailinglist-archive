Have you tried going at it incrementally?  \nGo ahead and write the unit tests for two or three of your classes, \ncutting and pasting if necessary.  Then go back and see what you have to \ndo to remove the duplication.  I often find this to be an effective way \nto make an abstract question concrete.\n\nIf, in the midst of doing this exercise, you find yourself with a small, \nfocused example of a place where you would be tempted to use multiple \ninheritance, please post it.  I&#39;m willing to bet, with even odds, that \nyou&#39;ll quickly find other ways of gracefully doing what you need.  Good \nluck,\n\n    David Saff\n\nJava Questions wrote:\n\n&gt; Hi everyone,\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m faced with a &quot;design problem&quot; and I was hoping that some\n&gt; experienced developer could help me figure out how to sort it out.\n&gt;\n&gt; I use a lot of small interfaces in my application, each of which has a\n&gt; very precise purpose. Most of my &quot;concrete&quot; classes implement more\n&gt; than one of these interfaces.\n&gt;\n&gt; Now, I was hoping to find a way to refactor my tests so that each\n&gt; interface has its own abstract TestCase. Then, if multiple inheritance\n&gt; was allowed in Java, I could simply implement each classes concrete\n&gt; classe&#39;s TestCase by inheriting from all the appropriate &quot;interface\n&gt; TestCases&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; This would allow me to inherit all the general purpose fixtures and\n&gt; simply add some new fixtures targeted for the concrete classe&#39;s\n&gt; specific behavior. In a way, I simply want to enforce the &quot;Liskov\n&gt; Substitution Principle&quot; as simply as possible...\n&gt;\n&gt; I know multiple inheritance isn&#39;t allowed in Java and should be\n&gt; avoided anyway but I&#39;d like to find a simple way to keep the general\n&gt; idea of &quot;interface specific super TestCases&quot; and apply it to classes\n&gt; implementing several of these interfaces.\n&gt;\n&gt; Is the general idea a good one ? If it is, what is  the best way to \n&gt; achieve it ?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks in advance,\n&gt;\n&gt; D.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; YAHOO!
