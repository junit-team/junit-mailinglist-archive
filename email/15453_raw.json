I&#39;ll leave aside discussion that you can&#39;t \nalways isolate components from the infrastructure because it is a \nseparate topic and in fact quite achievable in my opinion.\n\n  Now, for each isolated unit of code we have an unit test. When \napplication size grows complexity of unit tests would grow linearly and \nnot exponential and as a result close to 100% test coverage is not any \nmore difficult to achieve for large codebase then for a small codebase.\n\n  Last thing I want to point out is that in many cases folks talk about \ntest coverage based on the percent of covered lines. This is one of the \neasies coverage methodologies and also the one of the least \nrepresentative. There are more meaningful coverage techniques that would \ngive better representation of the tested logic paths. It also seems very \nlogical to me to assume that well designed code will not have infinite \nnumber of logical branches for any given code unit.\n  I agree that there could be some code patterns that doesn&#39;t make sense \nto test explicitly, but coverage tool can actually exclude such patterns \nfrom the analysis.\n\n  For those who curious about coverage analysis methodologies I can \nsuggest a good summary at http://www.bullseye.com/coverage.html\n\n  regards,\n  Eugene\n\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
