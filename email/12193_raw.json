Are you trying to test end\n&gt; to end? Are you \n&gt; trying to test your integration with some part of\n&gt; the framework? Is this \n&gt; a Learning Test?\n&gt; \n&gt; What are you afraid is broken right now?\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I was wondering if anyone with more experience\n&gt; than us is doing\n&gt; &gt; similar testing with Spring/Hibernate and how are\n&gt; the doing such\n&gt; &gt; testing?\n&gt; \n&gt; I have no experience, but I have ideas. You said\n&gt; that you want to verify \n&gt; that data makes it to the database. Who&#39;s\n&gt; responsible for making sure \n&gt; the data gets into the database? (Your code?\n&gt; Hibernate? WebSphere?) If \n&gt; you still need to/want to solve this problem, then\n&gt; I&#39;d like to start by \n&gt; establishing who has which responsibilities.\n&gt; -- \n\nMy reply has taken just as long ... I am on leave at\nthe moment with child #3 :-)\n\nI left the original msg unsnipped for reference.\n\nTo answer your questions:\n\n1. What was my goal?  \n\nIt was a type of end to end test.  The test&#39;s point of\nentry was the InvestorWebService object.  I asked the\nInvestorWebService for a PersonDTO (a person is one\ninvestor type), modified it, and sent it to the update\nmethod on the InvestorWebService.   \n\nTo check that this indeed worked as expected, in that\nall the tables in DB were updated as expected, I used\nDbUnit to assert that the tables matched XML datasets.\n\n2.  Responsibilities\n\nThe InvestorWebService is responsible for returning an\ninvestor as a DTO.  It uses a DAO object (this is\ninstantiated using Spring) to retrieve an investor\nbusiness object.  The DAO uses Hibernate to retreive\nthe requested investor object.\n\nThe InvestorWebService is responsible for updating an\ninvestor from a passed DTO.  It uses a DAO object\n(this is instantiated using Spring) to update an\ninvestor business object.  The DAO uses Hibernate to\nupdate the requested investor object.\n\nHibernate ultimately updates the database.\n\nIs that enough to start some discussion on your ideas?\n\nCheers\nShane\n\n\n\n\n\n=====\n\nShane Mingins\n\nshanemingins@...\n\nplease remove clothes before emailing\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
