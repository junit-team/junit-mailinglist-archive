One of the enhancements I am interested in making \nhowever is something along the lines that jpulley is describing - \ni.e. allowing a test to continue following an assertion failure.\n\nInitially I just want the tests to continue so that I can get \nsome kind of indication about how many assertions are failing \nin each test case.  Longer term I am thinking that it may be \nuseful to be able to indicate whether or not particular assertion \nfailure should cause a test case to halt - this might be on a per \nassertion basis (perhaps a little tedious) or via some other \nmechanism (say a flag that can be set to indicate whether \nor not the next failure should end the test case).\n\nThe motivation for this extension is that most test cases \ncontain a whole bunch of assertions following the code \nthat is being tested.  I am actually writing several hundred \ntest cases for code written by someone else - working \nthis way it makes much more sense to test a feature to \ndeath in a single test case rather than writing a separate \ntest case for each aspect of a feature.  I have test cases \nthat include 100 assertions with up to like 80 failures \n(I currently have to comment out lines containing failures \nin order to continue processing).  Writing 100 separate \ntest cases would not be practical and would actually \nmake the test results harder to interpret.\n\nIt would be interesting to hear jpulley&#39;s approach - any chance \nof you providing some guidance on what needs to be \nchanged?\n\nCheers,\n\nScott\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;Sharmila &quot; &lt;sharmila_pillai@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;junit@egroups.com&gt;\nSent: Thursday, January 04, 2001 12:43 AM\nSubject: [junit] Re: Protectable - why?\n\n\n&gt; Hi, \n&gt; \n&gt;  Could you throw some light on &quot;extending JUnit to permit deferred \n&gt; collection of assertion failures&quot;...am a newbie and havn&#39;t a clue how \n&gt; to go about this.\n&gt; Would appreciate any help.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks in advance,\n&gt; Sharmila.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In junit@egroups.com, jpulley@c... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Does anyone know why the Protectable interface is needed in the\n&gt; &gt; design of JUnit?  Why couldn&#39;t they just put the call to runBare() \n&gt; &gt; directly in runProtected()?  I&#39;m extending JUnit to permit deferred \n&gt; &gt; collection of assertion failures (so selected tests can continue if \n&gt; an \n&gt; &gt; assertion fails), and although the extension works I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m \n&gt; &gt; missing something.\n\n\n\n",
