I s=\r\nuppose it could be called a DynamicSuite, or SuiteMethodRunner. I&#39;m just no=\r\nt sure that it adds anything.\n\nCertainly from the user perspective I would =\r\nsee it as more intuitive to have one @RunWith(Suite.class) annotation with =\r\nsome variations on how to set up the suite rather than have two different r=\r\nunners and have to understand which one to use when.\n\n--- In junit@yahoogro=\r\nups.com, David Saff &lt;david@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Sorry for the long delay in resp=\r\nonse.\n&gt; \n&gt; This is a good idea, I think.  I wonder if it needs to be in the=\r\n same\n&gt; runner as Suite, or could it be a different Runner?\n&gt; \n&gt;    David S=\r\naff\n&gt; \n&gt; On Wed, Feb 25, 2009 at 10:34 AM, yme0987654321 &lt;yme0987654321@...=\r\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; I have the following challenge, with a proposed solution. If t=\r\nhere is\n&gt; &gt; interest, I would be happy to contribute a patch to the JUnit p=\r\nroject\n&gt; &gt; to address it. On the other hand, if there is a way to solve thi=\r\ns\n&gt; &gt; problem differently in JUnit already, please let me know.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Ant=\r\n and IDEA (the IDE from Intellij) don&#39;t agree on how to gather\n&gt; &gt; classes =\r\nfor test. IDEA inspects the actual class for things that\n&gt; &gt; extend TestCas=\r\ne or have a JUnit annotation on the class (or have a\n&gt; &gt; static suite metho=\r\nd) and executes the test. Ant gathers tests via\n&gt; &gt; class names. To use the=\r\n Ant method with JUnit outside of Ant, you can\n&gt; &gt; use JUnitCore, and just =\r\npass it an array of classes gathered in the\n&gt; &gt; Ant form. However IDEA does=\r\nn&#39;t report those results in its typical\n&gt; &gt; fashion. It uses its own custom=\r\n runner to gather and run these tests.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The only option I see in the=\r\n JUnit current code is to make a custom\n&gt; &gt; runner that knows how to extrac=\r\nt a Class[] array and pass it on to the\n&gt; &gt; standard runner, and then use t=\r\nhe RunWith tag to annotate an arbitrary\n&gt; &gt; class to get IDEA to think that=\r\n it is running a test suite. I haven&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; actually done this to see if IDE=\r\nA has any issues, but it seems like it\n&gt; &gt; should work.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; My proposal=\r\n is to add an annotation to the Suite class called\n&gt; &gt; SuiteMethod that wou=\r\nld annotate a method that returns a Class[] array.\n&gt; &gt; The Suite would then=\r\n be built from the two annotations,\n&gt; &gt; Suite.SuiteClasses plus any methods=\r\n on the class (we could enforce\n&gt; &gt; that they be public, static, take no pa=\r\nrameters and return a Class[]\n&gt; &gt; array) that are annotated with Suite.Suit=\r\neMethod and build the Suite\n&gt; &gt; as a combination of all of the Arrays retur=\r\nned.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; What do you think?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; -----------=\r\n-------------------------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
