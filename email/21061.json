I did not mean to say that there would be no<br/>\ndocumentation other than what Structure 101 can provide.  I meant to<br/>\nsay that it might be a while, and if you had specific questions, you<br/>\ncould spend some time with the diagramming tools, or ask specific<br/>\nquestions, and I hope you could write up what you&#39;ve learned.  There&#39;s<br/>\na lot I&#39;d like to do with JUnit, and I can&#39;t promise any design<br/>\ndocumentation in less than a month.

It is not the kind of documentation I meant.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Such tools just twist and twirl data and present it in a way which does not<br/>\n&gt; help much to understand the design.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; A good documentation cannot be automated away or roundtripped.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; You need some text and some diagrams. Both need not be perfect. But as I<br/>\n&gt; said, that can&#39;t be automated, or at least is not valuable for understanding<br/>\n&gt; it quickly as it would be from a human who knows how man thinks and how the<br/>\n&gt; design is and what does matter to know and what is unnecessary detail.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But it seems no matter what I would write, you mean that there will be no<br/>\n&gt; such manual documentation. A little design documentation would be very good<br/>\n&gt; for understanding such a widely used tool. Thousands of programmers should<br/>\n&gt; not need to download a specific tool and then discover that it does not help<br/>\n&gt; them understanding JUnit&#39;s design.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Just my opinion.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --- On Thu, 10/23/08, David Saff &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:david@...\">david@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; From: David Saff &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:david@...\">david@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [junit] Design documentation for JUnit 4.x?<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Date: Thursday, October 23, 2008, 1:45 PM<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; None published.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If someone wanted to download a trial copy of Structure 101 and<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; produce some, that&#39;d be cool, and I&#39;d be happy to answer questions.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; David Saff<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On Thu, Oct 23, 2008 at 4:36 AM, Hans Schwaebli<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;hans_schwaebli@ yahoo.com&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Is there any design documentation for JUnit 4.x?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; I mean class diagrams and sequence diagrams?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; __<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
