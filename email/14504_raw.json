Imagine that you have class with one point of entry \n&gt;for the client i.e. one public method. You can&#39;t change the access modifier \n&gt;of your method just to test it. Wrapping your private method in a public \n&gt;method is just the same as changing the access modifier. It is will \n&gt;documented and it works to use java reflection.\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nThe main issue is that a class with a large number of private methods is \nprobably doing too much work. A significant amount of that work could be \npushed off to helper classes. This will often (always, in my experience) \nresult in a better and simpler design that, _as a side effect_, is more \ntestable. I also end up with less duplication in the code base.\n\nI normally make these helper classes package-private until I can promote \nthem to more generally used classes; some get this status, but most \nwouldn&#39;t.\n\nRobert.\n\n\n",
