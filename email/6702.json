But with the skeleton of<br/>\n&gt; the application method in place, one can use the full power<br/>\n&gt; of the IDE. I&#39;m using JUnitDoclet together with IDEA.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [lots of stuff about the IDE changing stuff you&#39;ve already written]<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I dunno. All of this stuff where you write a stub and then get the idea<br/>\nto edit the stub for you as you play with ideas seems like a lot of work<br/>\nto me, compared to just sketching out the ideas right into a unit test.<br/>\nEspecially since you still have to type out the stubs initially.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy futz about with special tools when they&#39;re completely unnecessary?<br/>\nJust play about with your interface without any stubs at all, and write<br/>\nthem when you&#39;re happy with the bit of interface you&#39;ve designed.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact, I often &quot;test second&quot; in that the usually place I first write<br/>\nanything to do with a new class I&#39;m thinking of creating is in the<br/>\nclass that uses it. I just imagine that my new magic class exists<br/>\nand does what I need, and code that. Then I code up some unit tests<br/>\nthat parallel that, and then code the class itself. Works great, and<br/>\nsometimes complete classes appear and disappear in the caller before I<br/>\nreally work out what interface I need; it would be a waste of time to<br/>\ncreate stubs for a class and generate the test cases, only to delete all<br/>\nof that five minutes later.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I find my test cases often don&#39;t parallel the particular methods<br/>\nof a class. They test the typical usage patterns of a class, instead. So<br/>\na test generator would just generate the wrong thing anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut in the end, I guess you believe in test-first programming or you don&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\ncjs<br/>\n-- <br/>\nCurt Sampson  &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cjs@...\">cjs@...</a>&gt;   +81 90 7737 2974   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.netbsd.org\">http://www.netbsd.org</a><br/>\n    Don&#39;t you know, in this new Dark Age, we&#39;re all light.  --XTC</div>",
