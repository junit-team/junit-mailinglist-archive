We&#39;d like to \n    be able to test whether or not they have implemented the methods \n    we&#39;ve defined in our interfaces correctly.

Obviously, the graphics portion must be verified \n    visually, but what about the non-visual portions? \n    \n    Can JUnit test this? \n    \n    Thanks, \n    \n    Adam\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n    junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n     \n    \n    Your use of Yahoo!
