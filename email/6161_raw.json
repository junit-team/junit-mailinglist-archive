In my case it was to \nreuse some tests (without modification) that were present in a number of \nexternal files, so the filename was the parameter.\n\nI created a test class that was a derived class of TestSuite.\n\nWithin that I declared a static inner class that derives from TestCase \n(though it could just as well be a separate non-inner public class)\nThe actual test is in the runTest method of the inner class.\nThe inner class has a constructor that takes arguments which are the \nvariable parameters to the test, storing the values in \n\nIn the constructor of the TestSuite I construct and add as tests instances \nof the inner TestCase for each set of parameters I want to run (by \ncalling, for example, addTest(new InnerTestCase(...)); ).\n\nThen I can run the test suite.  Each instance of the inner test case \ncounts as a single test and is reported as so in the TestRunners - \nincluding in the test hierarchy display.  The TestSuite&#39;s run and \ncountTestCases methods work without derivation, if I remember correctly. I \nthink I did define a static suite() method for the TestSuite.  You can \nalso add the outer Test Suite as an element of larger Test Suites.\n\nWorks great - the more I figured out how to properly use JUnit, the \nshorter my own code became.\n\nI don&#39;t have the code here, but will be glad to send it to you directly if \nmy approach is not clear from the discussion above.\n\n- David\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&quot;mark_x_robinson&quot; &lt;mark_X_robinson@...&gt;\n11/13/2002 07:53 AM\nPlease respond to junit\n\n \n        To:     junit@yahoogroups.com\n        cc: \n        Subject:        [junit] Using the same test but with different parameters\n\n\nI have a standard test with needs to be run for different parameters.\nI have created an XML file to define all the parameters and was\nhoping to use JUnit to run the tests.\n\nI cannot see how I can run the same method using different parameters.\ne.g tests hcannot take paramters and methods are only called one.\n\nI could have one test method that does the test for each parameter\nset but JUnit I don&#39;t think allows you to continue after an assert.\nBasically I want to treat each pass of the test  as a seperate\nsuccess/fail condition.\n\nAny ideas ?\n\n\n\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\njunit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n\n\nYour use of Yahoo!
