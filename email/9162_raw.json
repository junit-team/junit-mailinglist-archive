Perhaps\n  every heretofore uncharted business domain may provide\n=\r\n  artistic freedom for a software developer, but pretty soon,\n  it becomes =\r\nyet another &quot;patternizable&quot;, &quot;automated testable&quot;\n  piece of software.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n  From what I understand the goal of CMM is to define a \n&gt; process that eve=\r\nn \n&gt; a monkey could follow. Monkeys do not write software; people do.\n\n  pe=\r\nrhaps the monkey refers to &quot;code monkeys&quot;...\n  Again, my point is that a la=\r\nrge part of software being built today\n  is grunt-work, which can and shoul=\r\nd be codified in a process.\n&gt; \n&gt; It drives towards more uniform results, ce=\r\nrtainly; but I don&#39;t know \n&gt; about &quot;better software&quot;.\n  \n  At the end, if y=\r\nou&#39;re saying the concept of the CMM is BS, I don&#39;t\nagree. The very fact tha=\r\nt we&#39;re using JUnit and other tools to \ncomplement our laziness (laziness b=\r\neing a compliment, of course, in\nsoftware development) is evidence that we =\r\nare trying to get from\nInitial to Repeatable (this word is JUnit all the wa=\r\ny) to Defined\nto Managed to Optimized (refactor mercilessly).\nif you&#39;re say=\r\ning the process (documentation, documentation and more\ndocumentation) is fl=\r\nawed, I&#39;m with you.\n\nFinally, I just took a look at http://www.sei.cmu.edu =\r\nand found out \nthat they&#39;re sunsetting the CMM and moving to CMMI, so maybe=\r\n they\ndid find out that most people out here cared two hoots about the\nproc=\r\ness...\n\nregards,\nNilesh\n\n",
