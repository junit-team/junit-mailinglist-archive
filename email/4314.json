If the files do differ, then I&#39;d like a<br/>\n&gt; listing of ALL the places where they differ.  Is there anything in<br/>\n&gt; JUnit or any of its extensions that does something like this?  I know<br/>\n&gt; this is not really unit testing, more like black box application<br/>\n&gt; testing, but I like the formatting and gui options of JUnit and would<br/>\n&gt; like to be able to use it if possible.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks in advance,<br/>\n&gt; Adam </span></blockquote></div>",
