For example,=\r\n the JUnit Web page seems to have had few\n&gt; &gt; updates since 2003. And on So=\r\nurceForge, Erich Gamma and Kent Beck\n&gt; &gt; responded to some GUI-related RFEs=\r\n with the comment that because most\n&gt; &gt; IDEs now handle test running themse=\r\nlves, there&#39;s no point to improving\n&gt; &gt; JUnit&#39;s own GUI tools. Non-interfac=\r\ne bug reports and RFEs have gone\n&gt; &gt; unassigned unless they&#39;re of very high=\r\n priority (such as ones related to\n&gt; &gt; thread safety). Is there simply no r=\r\neal demand for improvements, or has\n&gt; &gt; the SourceForge bug report page bee=\r\nn deprecated?\n&gt; \n&gt; That&#39;s an ongoing debate in the community. I honestly be=\r\nlieve that the\n&gt; JUnit framework is closed (in the Open/Closed Principle se=\r\nnse), even if\n&gt; the test runners are occasionally inadequate. Since I use E=\r\nclipse&#39;s test\n&gt; runner most of the time and Ant&#39;s the rest of the time, tha=\r\nt&#39;s not an\n&gt; issue for me.\n&gt; \n&gt; JUnit 4.0, complete with support for Java a=\r\nnnotations, is in the works,\n&gt; but I don&#39;t know any more than that.\n&gt; --\n&gt; =\r\nJ.
