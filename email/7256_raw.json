Since we currently have more than 500 test cases it is \ndifficult to do this manually. It would of course be easy if the \nnormal success rate was 100%, but a number of test cases fail since \nthe implementation is not yet completed. I would like to input two \nversions of the JUnit output (which currently is in XML format), and \nget a report of what the difference is between the two.\n\nIs there a tool that can help me with this?\n\n/Daniel\n\n\n",
