    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1324218722\">In the past, I&#39;ve designed my database interaction classes to take an<br/>\napplication specific Transaction object.  The Transaction had<br/>\nCommit/Rollback methods which contained application specific handling<br/>\n(like resetting local state in event of a database rollback) as well as<br/>\nperforming the real commit/rollback . By substituting a special purpose<br/>\nTransaction object I could simulate nested transactions or<br/>\ndummy out the commits for testing purposes.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Fri, 31 Aug 2001, Richard Dallaway wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; A while ago I had an email conversation with Bruce Vinchon regarding<br/>\n&gt; database testing. I said I&#39;d mention something we discussed on this mailing<br/>\n&gt; list so here goes (and apologies to Bruce if I&#39;ve misrepresented his thoughts).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Bruce mentioned using the &quot;auto commit off&quot; trick to make database testing<br/>\n&gt; easier.   I.e., you do something like turn auto commit off during setUp()<br/>\n&gt; and do an rollback/abort in tearDown(), so you can write to a test database<br/>\n&gt; and not have to worry about cleaning it up. Something like that.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I replied talking about the problems when you have methods which are<br/>\n&gt; themselves transactions (i.e., methods which<br/>\n&gt; start transactions, write to various tables, then commit).  How can you use<br/>\n&gt; the &quot;auto commit off&quot; trick in those situations?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Bruce suggested that you may be able to get something to work with nested<br/>\n&gt; transactions, perhaps using a transaction service such as JTA/JTS.  Sounds<br/>\n&gt; good to me, but I haven&#39;t had the opportunity to investigate this idea or<br/>\n&gt; the Java Transaction APIs.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Can anyone comment on this approach?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Regards<br/>\n&gt; Richard<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
