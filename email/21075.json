Now,<br/>\n&gt; these run against a single backend and now several developers in my<br/>\n&gt; group would like to use these tests against other backends to test them.<br/>\n&gt; The most natural way to do this is with the test suite mechanism in<br/>\n&gt; jUnit. That is to say, make up a suite that requires merely that the<br/>\n&gt; backend be set and test away. Or so I thought.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The different backends are different projects in our group and live in<br/>\n&gt; different Maven modules.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The problem is that making a suite using annotations does not really<br/>\n&gt; work so well. The annotations are not inherited. The other solution<br/>\n&gt; which is to have the developers make their own suites by annotations is<br/>\n&gt; also very clunky and will probably break at some point.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So here is my question: Is there any way to make a test suite that is a<br/>\n&gt; harness and can be reused?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I assume that jUnit 3.8&#39;s method of explicitly creating a suite is going<br/>\n&gt; to get deprecated soon, right? So that would be a deadend. Also, are<br/>\n&gt; their plans to make annotations inheritable at some point in jUnit? We<br/>\n&gt; could maybe live with cutting and pasting for the short term if we knew<br/>\n&gt; that this issue would get resolved at some point.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Jeff<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
