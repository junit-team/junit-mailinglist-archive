Reports \nmay be very long and here two approaches arise. \n1. I guess that the classic design would be to separate gathering DB \ndata from composing XML, but on the other hand, if a gatherer returns \na collection of value objects from a DB and then a composer really \nbuilds an XML we waste memory. The example is not so teoretical cause \nI met users working somehow with MSWord documents of size 200Mb. If \nan XML report would have a like length then a server building several \nsuch request will simply die! \n2. Non classic solution is to return to a composer a recordset object \nand put on the composer&#39;s shoulders to fetch it, surround by specific \ninfo and put out. This resolves memory wasting problem but tights two \ndifferent activities together.\n\nWhy I&#39;m asking this question in JUint group is &#39;cause I started \npracticing JUint recently and one of my badly-designed classes \nhappened to be untestable (cause of such thought copling).\nAs buffs of XP approach what do you preffer? Does it mean that every \ntime a unit test can&#39;t be written for a function the function must be \nrefactored?\n\n\n\n",
