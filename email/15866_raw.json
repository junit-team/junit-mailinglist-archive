At\nfir=\r\nst I was baffled as running the tests individually went fine but\nrunning a =\r\nlot (hundreds) of tests caused JUnit to run out of memory (the\nclasses unde=\r\nr test used jaxb to read a lot of xml). After digging I\nfound that I had mi=\r\nsunderstood how JUnit works. I thought that after a\ntest is run, there is n=\r\no more use for that test object so the reference\nto it is discarded. This i=\r\ns not so, as I found reading the FAQ entry\n&quot;When are tests garbage collecte=\r\nd?&quot;: \n\nhttp://junit.sourceforge.net/doc/faq/faq.htm#tests_18\n\n  So, I made =\r\ntearDown set reference to anything instantiated in setUp to\nnull and the pr=\r\noblem was gone. \n\n\n\n\n       -Antti-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
