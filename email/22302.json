What is the best getting started guide for a Windows user out there?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I assume you mean a getting-started guide for github in particular?  I<br/>\n&gt; found the on-site help sufficient, but I think Kent found that things<br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t Just Work on Windows.  Kent?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   David Saff </span></blockquote></div>",
