This is clear to me that you are<br/>\n&gt; not interested in what I propose. I&#39;m not really surprised as it<br/>\n&gt; confirms the experience made by others in the past. This is sad because<br/>\n&gt; I still think that a lot of JUnit users would love improvements but at<br/>\n&gt; the end, it is your decision.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t see, that David does not have any interest in accepting your<br/>\nchanges. I too feel, that he is trying hard to find a way to<br/>\naccomodate your changes.<br/>\nBut yes, this accomodation is not: We will build it all into JUnit.<br/>\nAnd that&#39;s ok for me (as a JUnit user).<br/>\nIf that&#39;s the only acceptable answer for you, than I feel sorry, that<br/>\nwe all can&#39;t benefit from your contributions.<br/>\n<br/>\nKent Beck and David Saff work hard not to break existing usage of<br/>\nJUnit. That&#39;s a deliberate decision and it&#39;s quite reasonable,<br/>\nconsidering the large user base, that JUnit has. They also work hard<br/>\nto keep JUnit itself small (lean and mean), so it can be maintained<br/>\nand developed easily. They built lots of extension mechanisms to allow<br/>\nfor the type of contributions, that you would like to make.<br/>\nIf these extension mechanisms are not quite enough yet, then I would<br/>\nwork to improve those in the JUnit core. (Combinable Runners might be<br/>\none of those things, that are missing yet.)<br/>\n<br/>\nGreetings,<br/>\n   Malte</div>",
