Perhaps\n&gt;  &gt; it is worth starting with a class that does not have any collaborators\n&gt;  &gt; or only ones that are already tested in a previous &quot;test phase&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt;  I&#39;d suggest classes which are likely to be worked on &quot;soon&quot;. Those are,\n&gt;  after all, the ones which you might otherwise break, and for which\n&gt;  unit tests will add most value.\n&gt;\n&gt;  It&#39;s tempting to start with &quot;easy&quot; ones, but you run the risk of writing\n&gt;  tests for things that won&#39;t change and won&#39;t break, and you&#39;d gain an\n&gt;  unrealistic view of how easy it is(n&#39;t) to add tests post-hoc.\n\nAll good advice.\n\nI&#39;d also cover the code with end-to-end tests.\n\nUnit tests give you a lot of feedback about the internal quality of\nyour code (is it maintainable, readable, decoupled, cohesive etc.),\nbut less feedback about the external quality of the code (is it good\nenough for purpose).\n\nEnd-to-end and integration tests give you more feedback about the\nexternal quality of your code, but less feedback about its internal\nquality.  E.g. the tell you whether all the pieces work together, but\nnot whether the pieces are well structured and easily (un)pluggable.\n\nIf you&#39;ve already got a lot of code, feedback about its internal\nquality now is a bit late in the day.  I expect you&#39;re concerned about\nregressions as you add behaviour.  So, I would concentrate on\nintegration and end-to-end tests to ensure correct system behaviour.\n\nIt&#39;s worth adding unit tests for new classes as you add new behaviour.\nThey will also help you to discover where the code is difficult to\nmaintain and help you introduce flex points.  At that point you can\nstart refactoring the existing code, where it touches the new code, to\nmake it more testable and more easily surround the refactored with\nunit tests.  You&#39;ll feel more confident that you aren&#39;t breaking\nanything because the end-to-end tests will help detect any regressions\nthe changes cause.\n\n--Nat\n\n",
