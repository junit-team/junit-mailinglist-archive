If your driver breaks, then obviously you <br/>\nare missing a test in the former test suite, but not necessarily in the <br/>\nlater.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Why is it so hard to understand that I want my tests to be as close to<br/>\n&gt; my production code as possible?!?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Don&#39;t know, maybe it&#39;s related to the way you try to explain?<br/>\n<br/>\nYour tests don&#39;t seem to be unit tests to me, but end to end tests. <br/>\nThey seem to do too much.<br/>\n<br/>\nAssume your data may also come from a database, not only from XML. <br/>\nDo you then write all your test that deal with the objects *again*?<br/>\nOr do you just test the objects in isolation and the the XML / DB readers <br/>\nin isolation?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; Please give an example where it does affect your test results<br/>\n&gt; &gt; if the setup code runs for each test and where you still<br/>\n&gt; &gt; claim that the tests are independent.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; How about the example I just gave?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>A concrete example please. A test class with at least two test methods <br/>\nthat <br/>\na) are independent of each other<br/>\nb) fail / pass if and only if setUp is / is not run<br/>\nI have seen some pretty bad code but I still don&#39;t see how you want to <br/>\nachieve that.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Hint:  imagine the XML file is several megabytes big.  It&#39;s not that<br/>\n&gt; far fetched, really.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hint: cut it down to simpler XML. <br/>\nI cannot believe you have no duplication in terms of features in a several <br/>\nmegabytes file. <br/>\nAnd if you do, why not use small chunks in each test?  What about one test <br/>\nper interesting feature of each XML entity? <br/>\n<br/>\nI am curious how long your test methods are... more than 3 lines on <br/>\naverage?<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\n<br/>\nRobert</div>",
