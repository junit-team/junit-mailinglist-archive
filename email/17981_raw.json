Working on \nsuch a thing on your own, if you get time and permission, can teach you \na lot about how Eclipse is built).\n\nThe developer tests should be vanilla JUnit tests, which don&#39;t require \nany of the Eclipse runtime to be in place.  In some places, Eclipse \nhelps with this: many interesting operations are defined and invoked on \ninterfaces that you can mock.  In some places, Eclipse gets in your \nway.  One example is that SWT is difficult to load at runtime without \nthe whole Eclipse runtime coming along for the ride.  However, there&#39;s a \ntip in the e-mail above that will get around that.\n\nWorse is that Eclipse often gets the implementors of those nice \ninterfaces by making direct static calls to unmockable runtime classes.  \nThis will push your design in a certain direction--you will need to wrap \nthese global services and override or mock them in your tests.  If your \nteam is test-infected, then this shouldn&#39;t be a problem.  If not, there \nmay be some grumbling about making your design more complicated &quot;just \nfor testing&quot;.  However, point out to them the ability gained to run \n100&#39;s of tests in under 5 seconds, compared to the 30 seconds it usually \ntakes just to boot the Eclipse runtime, and the even longer time it \ntakes to test manually.  Also, I find that the design pressures of \nwrapping the Eclipse services leads me to some nice model classes that \nare comprehensible even to people who know nothing about Eclipse, \nallowing me to leverage a much broader range of design advice and \nimplementation expertise.\n\nIf you have more questions, please post them here; I find this to be a \nreally fun problem to work on.  Thanks,\n\n    David Saff\n\nKamal Ahmed wrote:\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt; Does anyone have experience of developing JUnit tests for Eclipse based User\n&gt; Interface?\n&gt; The product being an Eclipse plugin.\n&gt;\n&gt; The Interface/plugin is developed using:\n&gt; org.eclipse.ui\n&gt; org.eclipse.swt\n&gt; org.eclipse.jface\n&gt; org.eclipse.core.resources\n&gt; org.eclipse.ui.workbench\n&gt; org.eclipse.ui.navigator\n&gt; org.eclipse.ui.ide\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; -Kamal.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo!
