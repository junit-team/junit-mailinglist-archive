Discovered<br/>\n&gt; DBUnit, but I&#39;m not sure how I should approach my problem.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We migrate a database from one data schema to another, completely<br/>\n&gt; different. I want to be sure data is migrated correctly (so that for<br/>\n&gt; example a customer keeps its orders).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My first idea was to iterate on customers in the source database, and<br/>\n&gt; check its data against the new database.<br/>\n&gt; For example, for a customer, I would have tests on, amongst others:<br/>\n&gt; -contacts<br/>\n&gt; -orders<br/>\n&gt; -address<br/>\n&gt; and each test would be run for each row coming from the source database.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Is that the correct approach?<br/>\n&gt; From what I discovered of JUnit, I&#39;m not sure how to integrate the<br/>\n&gt; iteration in the test suite ( The same test would be run against all rows<br/>\n&gt; from the database).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks in advance for your help. I hope I didn&#39;t miss any obvious thing<br/>\n&gt; before posting this....<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Raph<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Raph,<br/>\n<br/>\nThis sounds like a fine approach.  Why not try it in a small fashion and <br/>\nsee if it would meet your needs?  As far as the implementation is <br/>\nconcerned... I would hope that you already have something of a persistence <br/>\nabstraction layer in which you could swap out the DBs.  The first thing I <br/>\nmight do is to build up models on one DB, swap in the new DB, build models <br/>\nagain and compare them.  Make sense?<br/>\n<br/>\n=jason<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nUsing M2, Opera&#39;s revolutionary e-mail client: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.opera.com/m2/\">http://www.opera.com/m2/</a></div>",
