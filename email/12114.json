My <br/>\nconcern is that I can&#39;t figure out a good way to write these tests <br/>\nwithout relying on other DAO methods.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, my employeeDAO might have a createEmployee(Employee <br/>\nemployee) method and a getEmployeeById(Integer id) method.  Almost <br/>\nall of my tests rely on a employee record being pre-populated.  For <br/>\nnow, I&#39;m calling my createEmployee DAO method in setup() so every <br/>\ntest has it.  Then I call the deleteEmployee(Employee employee) <br/>\nmethod in tearDown().  It bothers me somewhat to have to do this as <br/>\nI would prefer to only call those methods within their corresponding <br/>\ntest methods.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve looked at DBUnit.  The problem here is that I still have to <br/>\npopulate my bean from the database - then I&#39;m back to calling a DAO <br/>\nmethod like getEmployeeById in every method - an undesirable <br/>\ndependency.  Another option I guess would be to have some DAO <br/>\nmethods used only for testing but this seems overkill.  I&#39;d rather <br/>\nuse the database during testing too, not mock objects.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I guess my questions are:<br/>\n<br/>\n1.)Is there a good way to test DAOs in isolation, without relying on <br/>\nother DAO methods?<br/>\n2.)Does it really matter that much anyway if I use other DAO <br/>\nmethods?  I mean, the goal is for ALL tests to pass anyway.  It can <br/>\nbe confusing if your testDeleteEmployee method fails due to a <br/>\nfailure in createEmployee which you have to call first, but I guess <br/>\nit wouldn&#39;t take long to figure out what really happened.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny feedback would be appreciated.<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nMike<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nYahoo!
