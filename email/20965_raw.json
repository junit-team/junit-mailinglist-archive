Are you using the\n&gt; version from the=\r\n website?\n\nYes, but I downloaded it again and found the theory classes this=\r\n time.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Theories will continue to be supported.  As a matter of fact, =\r\nupcoming\n&gt; releases should help solve one of the chief drawbacks of their u=\r\nse,\n&gt; which is that they force developers to choose between broad coverage\n=\r\n&gt; and fast runtimes.\n&gt; \n&gt;    David Saff\n&gt; \n\nDavid, thanks for the info. Can=\r\n you point me to some examples of how\nto use @Theory and associated runner,=\r\n etc.?\n\nI&#39;ve already read the white paper &#39;The Practice of Theories: Adding=\r\n\n&quot;For-all&quot; Statements to &quot;There-Exists&quot; Tests&#39; and am interested in\nsome pr=\r\nactical examples and/or how-to&#39;s.\n\nLeo\n\n\n",
