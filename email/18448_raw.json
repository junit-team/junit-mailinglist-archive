Might\n&gt;  &gt; that help?\n&gt; \n&gt; Umm ... Agile Java &lt;http://www.bookpool.com/sm/0131482394 \n&gt; &lt;http://www.bookpool.com/sm/0131482394&gt;&gt; by Jeff\n&gt; Langr?\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;quote&gt;\n&gt; Agile Java represents a successful approach to learning and mastering\n&gt; Java development ... Using TDD, you will learn how to craft Java code to\n&gt; produce solid object-oriented designs and highly maintainable, high\n&gt; quality systems.\n&gt; &lt;/quote&gt;\n\nI wondered how much overlap there would be between my book and his. I \nhaven&#39;t read Jeff&#39;s from beginning to end. I think we probably have \nsimilar content in spots, but slightly different goals. Part of me wants \nto read it to make sure I&#39;m not rewriting it; part of me wants to avoid \nit so that I don&#39;t subconsciously rewrite it. I don&#39;t know how to deal \nwith it.\n\nJeff, maybe we should talk about my idea and you can tell me whether I&#39;d \nbe rewriting your book. I feel no need to do that.\n\nIn the worst case, I would write mine in another language, which I was \nprobably going to have to do, anyway.\n-- \nJ. B.
