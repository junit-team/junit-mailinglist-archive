However it looks like that I \nwill have to run my tests in a container, meaning I have to use \nCactus. I don&#39;t think I can do this with Cactus because they \ninstantiate TestCase. If there is a way I would love to know.\n\nThanks\n\nZoran \n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;J. B. Rainsberger&quot; &lt;jbrains@r...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; zoran_101 wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; My question is how can I achieve the run of all the 100 test \neven if\n&gt; &gt; some of them fail.\n&gt; \n&gt; There is something called the Parameterized Test Case pattern with \n&gt; JUnit. The basic idea is to get fixture data into your TestCase \nsubclass \n&gt; through the constructor, then use the suite() method to create a \ncustom \n&gt; test suite with a test for each row of fixture data. For details, \nlook \n&gt; around the web, or in the book _JUnit Recipes_, recipe 4.8.\n&gt; -- \n&gt; J. B.
