One of their tools minimizes the <br/>\n </span></blockquote>length of<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; names where possible (it&#39;s not possible where a name is part of a<br/>\n&gt; published interface).

I&#39;m not sure that I can relate it <br/>\nto the presence or absence of comments, particularly since comments <br/>\ndon&#39;t end up in the compiled code.  If this compression of names is <br/>\nthat beneficial, then it sounds like it should be a part of the <br/>\nautomated build process i.e.<br/>\n<br/>\nSource Code In ---&gt; Everything renamed to short names --&gt; Compiler --<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Result<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; There is a reasonably reliable relationship between code size and<br/>\n&gt; speed. Less than half as many bytes typically means software that<br/>\n&gt; runs more than twice as fast.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I would have expected that choice of algorithm, correct use of <br/>\nbuffered I/O and so on would have a larger effect on performance <br/>\nthan the relative size in bytes of the compiled result.  Is the <br/>\narticle online for us to examine?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sure, but bear in mind the cost of using long names and an expanded<br/>\n&gt; class hierarchy to replace comments.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not clear what the cost of using long variable names is.  Could <br/>\nyou go into further detail about what the costs of the above two <br/>\nare?  I also suspect that if either of these things has a <br/>\nsignificant cost, then we are using wrong tools, or the right tools <br/>\nincorrectly.<br/>\n<br/>\nI must confess, I am definitely one of the &#39;comment extremely <br/>\nsparsely&#39; crowd.  What might be interesting is if we perhaps wrote a <br/>\nRuby program to process a Java source tree, replacing the symbols <br/>\nwith the smallest identifiers possible, unless they are tagged with <br/>\na @published tag for external compatibility reasons.  I would expect <br/>\nto be able to produce a readable and maintainable program to do this <br/>\nwith very few comments indeed.  I also expect to be able to write a <br/>\nprogram to convert a stack trace back to the original symbols, again <br/>\nwith very few comments.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you think that might be a worthwhile or interesting exercise?<br/>\n<br/>\nI can higly recommend &#39;Refactoring&#39; by Martin Fowler.  He has lots <br/>\nof great ideas and examples relating to identifying code quality, <br/>\nand a few bits on unit testing too.<br/>\n<br/>\nKind Regards,<br/>\nShaun.</div>",
