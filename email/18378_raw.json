It is an optional part of\nsome small JUnit extension. For more information, see or download at\nhttp://www.junitext.org. The jar file contained in junitext-0.2.0.zip is\nnamed &quot;junit-ui-runners-3.8.2.jar&quot;.\n\nHTH, Jochen\n\nOn 11/18/06, Kent Beck &lt;kentb@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;   Dear Al,\n&gt;\n&gt; We wrote the graphical runners because at the time there was no way to run\n&gt; tests besides the ugly/retro text runner. Once IDEs supported JUnit, it no\n&gt; longer made sense from a practical perspective to continue supporting the\n&gt; standalone runners. Aesthetically I prefer to have a design that depends\n&gt; only on basic Java rather than a large, relatively high-level GUI library.\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt;\n&gt; Kent Beck\n&gt; Three Rivers Institute\n&gt;\n&gt; _____\n&gt;\n&gt; From: junit@yahoogroups.com &lt;junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt; [mailto:\n&gt; junit@yahoogroups.com &lt;junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt;] On Behalf Of Al\n&gt; May\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, November 15, 2006 12:48 PM\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com &lt;junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [junit] Why should I continue to use junit.swingui.TestRunnerwith\n&gt; JUnit 4.1 ?\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt;\n&gt; ...\n&gt;\n&gt; My problem is with the third way: using the junit.swingui.TestRunner\n&gt; class present in the version 3.8. I say &quot;present in...&quot; because this\n&gt; class isn&#39;t available anymore in the version 4.1. As I said in the\n&gt; beginning of my post, I want to change to 4.1 definitely and I like to\n&gt; know whether I have to forget the Swing GUI runner or not. I don&#39;t\n&gt; want to include the java.jar of the previous version just to be able\n&gt; to run that runner. The problem is I liked to run my tests outside\n&gt; Eclipse using that special Swing test runner, but if someone tell me\n&gt; the reasons why it has been removed, I&#39;ll try to forget to use it anymore.\n&gt;\n&gt; In that case, I&#39;ll use Eclipse as a graphical user interface\n&gt; environment to run my JUnit tests and I will use the console mode\n&gt; throught ant to quickly verify my code.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks for your advice,\n&gt; Al\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
