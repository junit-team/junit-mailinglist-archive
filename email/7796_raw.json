From a computer\nscience perspective - issues like building and deployment are not a very hot\ntopic - at any level.  It would be nice it things were otherwise - but some\nmay argue that university is not there just to prepare you for a job... so,\ninterest in deployment would be rooted in the research possibilities (which\nI have not seen much of)...\n\nLearning to jar takes about an hour .. learning it really well - half a day.\nNow learning about testing methodologies (such as unit testing and load\ntesting) and other computer science concepts take much, much longer.\n\nMy point - just because you don&#39;t know  how to use a particular tool (and\nthat&#39;s all jar is) does not mean that you are poorly suited for a research\nposition (or even an employment one either).  It is more closely related to\nhow well you conduct research in general - and how well you can search out\nanswers to your questions in an academic manner.\n\n\nandrew f\n\n\n",
