This<br/>\n&gt; course will be taught in a variety of formats and lengths ranging from<br/>\n&gt; 90-minute seminar to one or two day hands on tutorial to a traditional<br/>\n&gt; university setting. Obviously how much I can cover and how deep I can go<br/>\n&gt; will vary depending on format, length, and audience level.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m wondering if anyone has any good ideas for examples to use in this<br/>\n&gt; course? Ideally I&#39;d like something that&#39;s simple enough to do in a day,<br/>\n&gt; but still gives attendees a feeling that they&#39;ve developed something<br/>\n&gt; real. I could possibly do something involving the Mandelbrot set or<br/>\n&gt; cellular automata. However, I&#39;d prefer something a little less<br/>\n&gt; mathematical if possible.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;d like it to have a GUI component, but at the same time I&#39;d like that<br/>\n&gt; to show up fairly late in the application, and for the application to<br/>\n&gt; still make sense if there&#39;s not time to cover testing GUIs.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It should be possible to develop this program on a laptop not connected<br/>\n&gt; to the Internet. i.e. no databases access, network communications, web<br/>\n&gt; services, the U.S. tax code, and so forth.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Students will have a wide variety of backgrounds so I want to avoid any<br/>\n&gt; special knowledge of subjects like XML processing, financial<br/>\n&gt; derivatives, quantum physics, and so forth. I should be able to cover<br/>\n&gt; the background necessary to start writing the program in 10 minutes or<br/>\n&gt; less.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Any ideas?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -- <br/>\n&gt; Elliotte Rusty Harold  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:elharo@...\">elharo@...</a><br/>\n&gt; XML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/\">http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/</a><br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim\">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>How about Bill Wake&#39;s Spreadsheet idea &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.xp123.com/xplor/xp0201/\">http://www.xp123.com/xplor/xp0201/</a>&gt;?<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJason Rogers<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I,<br/>\nbut Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in <br/>\nthe flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved <br/>\nme, and gave himself for me.&quot;<br/>\n    Galatians 2:20</div>",
