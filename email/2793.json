We (the Apache<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Avalon project) use Ant to do our builds and automated testing,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; however the behavior for test collection is different based<br/>\n&gt; &gt; on wether a Test is a TestCase or a TestSuite.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Your FAQ suggests that for one-time setup code you need to run<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it in a TestSuite.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This is what TestSetup is for. Wrap the suite in a subclass of<br/>\n&gt; TestSetup, override setUp() (and maybe tearDown()) in your subclass,<br/>\n&gt; and it only gets run once.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Alternatively, you could consider how to untangle your design so you<br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t need one-time setup.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t _need_ one-time setup, it is a matter of resources.  We have<br/>\na rather expensive setup and tear down routine that takes time.  If<br/>\nit were done once for all the tests in the class then the test takes<br/>\nan order of magnitude less time to run.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, some tests do need one time setup, the idea was to allow them<br/>\nto extend one of our own framework interfaces (Initializable or<br/>\nDisposable) to do their own one time setup.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe solution we have still allows the use of setUp() and tearDown()<br/>\nfor each test (prepare files, etc).<br/>\n<br/>\nI can try the TestSetup -- it is probably easier to maintain.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe whole thing is that I don&#39;t want to have to set up suites specifically<br/>\nfor the purpose of wrapping them.</div>",
