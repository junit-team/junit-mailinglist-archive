So i was not \n&gt; sure if we could handle pop up windows and page refreshed. I would \n&gt; really appreciate if you could let me know how its done. And thanks for \n&gt; your quick response.\n\nHave you tried HtmlUnit or jWebUnit? I suppose that, since jWebUnit \nbuilds on HttpUnit, then it may not help, but you never know.\n\nRegarding the pop-up windows, what are you testing? Does your test need \nto know that these windows are popping up, or could you simply test the \npop-up windows by navigating to them directly? If you could do that, \nthen you could avoid the problem of setting focus on them.\n\nTake care.\n-- \nJ. B.
