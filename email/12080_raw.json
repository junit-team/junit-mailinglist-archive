The JUnit-addons test runner reports \n&gt; &quot;ignored&quot; tests without actually executing them. Some people might find \n&gt; that valuable in general, although I suppose in this case, it may not be \n&gt; all that useful.\n\nTo bring in another view of ignored/unimplemented test cases in here:\n\nI generate many parts of my code from UML2 models using templates (JET\ntemplates of the Eclipse Modeling Framework). Also tests are generated.\nSometimes I can just generate interfaces or abstract classes and also\njust tests stubs.\n\nAt the moment my Test classes contain tests like:\n\npublic testSomething()\n{\n\tfail(&quot;Please implement!&quot;);\n}\n\nThat show at least what is working. But it hides the information about\nif there was a real problem or not. Since I generate for a legacy system\nI implement only needed parts of generated interfaces or abstract\nclasses. For thus I implement the tests.\n\nI could change the template to generate testSomething_ignored(). But JET\ncan merge java code an it would detect that the *_ignored tests is\nmissing in the case of regeneration.\n\nSo in that situation it would be helpful to do something like:\n\npublic testSomething()\n{\n   notImplemented(&quot;Please implement!&quot;);\n}\n\nEvery implemented test would fail/error or pass. All other would claim\nthat I have to implement them. I could miss to implement tests for some\ncode, but I would always see if code with existing tests is broken.\n\nregards.\n-- \nAlexander Rupsch\nhttp://www.dreinhalb.de\n\n\n",
