Most of the methods I add &quot;just for testing&quot; are query methods <br/>\nwithout side effects, so they&#39;re generally not dangerous. If I&#39;m /truly/ <br/>\nconcerned about keeping methods hidden, I can hide classes behind <br/>\ninterfaces, which tends to lead to more flexible designs, anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Excessive complexity of any form is to be scrutinized carefully. If <br/>\nwe must add complexity, I&#39;d rather add less than more, and a query <br/>\nmethod is certainly less complex than circumventing a code privilege <br/>\nsystem that ought not to have been there in the first place.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt appears, though, that we&#39;ve both done it both ways and that has led <br/>\nus to opposite conclusions. That&#39;s the kind of thing that makes life <br/>\ninteresting enough to keep living.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
