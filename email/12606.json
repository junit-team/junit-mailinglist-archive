    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1641656471\">On Wed, 05 Jan 2005 09:59:19 -0800, Kevin Lawrence<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kevin@...\">kevin@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The standard answer is that comments are a way to deodorize a code smell<br/>\n&gt; and that you can often make the smell go away rather than cover it up<br/>\n&gt; with a comment. Of course, this isn&#39;t always possible and sometimes not<br/>\n&gt; even desirable in a test.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Right, and if the code in question were particularly long, or ugly in<br/>\nsome other fashion, I&#39;d agree.  Taken alone your kind of comments can<br/>\nsound suspiciously like &quot;my code is self-documenting&quot;.  And it isn&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sometimes it is though. I find that when I have a lot of page long<br/>\n&gt; tests, there is a lot of duplication between the tests - which hurts<br/>\n&gt; maintainability and readability. EXTRACT METHOD can help with both.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am imagining something like this :<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; public void testMultipleCustomerPurchaseOrderEntriesForOneSalesOrderLine()<br/>\n&gt; {<br/>\n&gt;    createSalesOrderLine(...);<br/>\n&gt;    addCustomerPurchaseOrder( .... X );<br/>\n&gt;    addCustomerPurchaseOrder( .... Y );<br/>\n&gt;    assertSomethingAboutOrders( ...expected ...);<br/>\n&gt; }<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Any chance we can see the test ?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You&#39;ve described pretty much what it does.  There is other set-up that<br/>\nis done in this test that isn&#39;t done in the other tests in order to<br/>\ncreate the many purchase order situation, and there are more<br/>\nassertions because it checks a larger (about fifteen) set of data<br/>\ngoing in and out.  Most of that is done by helper methods, but you<br/>\nhave to record the values, so there&#39;s a lot of things like:<br/>\n<br/>\nString customerPO = &quot;somenumber&quot;;<br/>\nString housebillNumber = &quot;someHawb&quot;;<br/>\nString somethingElseToBeCheckedLater = &quot;somevalue&quot;;<br/>\n<br/>\nand their accompanying assert clauses.  Yes, I could do these in a<br/>\nseparate test, an interesting refactor and something we&#39;d likely do in<br/>\na code review, but not something I did the first time, and not the<br/>\nsource of the complexity that required the comment.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d share the test, but it uses client-specific data.  Some of it I<br/>\ncould change, but some values and paradigms are expected by the rest<br/>\nof the system (client codes, account nubmers, etc).<br/>\n<br/>\nIn general, what I wanted to say was that while Mike&#39;s right that most<br/>\nof the time the method name is sufficient, sometimes the case is<br/>\nenough of a corner that you both need and want a short description of<br/>\nwhat the heck is going on.  Not shipping any javadoc is turning that<br/>\n&#39;sometimes&#39; into &#39;never&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Kevin</div>",
