In fact the order is definitively stated\nto be undefined. This encourages tests to be written in such a way as\nto be independent of each other and execution sequence.\n\n&gt; How does junit determine the order of execution for test cases added\n&gt; to a test suite?\n\nDon&#39;t know. I almost never use suites these days. The fine manual\nmight have an answer for that one. (as in Read The Fine Manula! ;-)\n\n&gt; Does junit execute test methods/test cases swquentially or\n&gt; concurrently?\n\nSequentially, although, given the independent nature of tests, there&#39;s\nno reason why they shouldn&#39;t be executed in parallel. Mike Clark&#39;s\nJUnitPerf goes half-way there and runs the same test in multiple\nthreads for performance reasons, but I don&#39;t know of any test runners\nthat run different tests in different threads. That&#39;d be neat.\n\nSimon\n\n-- \nwww.simonpeter.org\n\n",
