Perhaps you would like to consider:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) Very little, if any, blame for the perceived problem was put on the\n&gt; posters other to note the situation. In fact, the discussion quickly\n&gt; focused on how to make it easier for people to find the information they need\n&gt; and make better use of the list.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2) This has quickly launched into a concrete discussion (and beginnings of\n&gt; action) for improving the documentation available to the community.\n\nI really like the idea of sending a FAQ as part of the initial mailing\nwhen someone subscribes to the list.  Hopefully, it will drastically\nreduce the &quot;dumb&quot; questions (and many of the smarter ones), and allow us\nto feel better about ignoring the ones that get through anyway.  And if\nsomeone asks a dumb question that isn&#39;t covered by the FAQ, a reasoned\nresponse should go into the FAQ!\n\nSuggestions:\n1. It should include a link to the latest version of the FAQ on the web\nsomewhere.  That way, older subscribers can keep up to date.\n\n2. It should be posted to the list whenever it is updated, similar to\nmany Usenet FAQs.\n\n3. Can we PLEASEPLEASEPLEASE include a link to the ESR essay that\nsomeone posted earlier?  It is much easier to answer questions when the\nquestions are phrased well, and basic rules of etiquette are followed. \nOf course, those who ask the worst questions don&#39;t read documentation\nanyway, but it would feel good.  :}\n-- \n\nDavid Stagner\n\nNational Marrow Donor Program\n3001 Broadway Street NE\nBroadway Ridge Suite 500\nMinneapolis, MN  55413\n\nEmail: dstagner@...\n\n",
