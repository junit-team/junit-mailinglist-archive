Sometimes, I can think of a better way <br/>\n&gt; to structure the problem, and am not worried about exposing<br/>\n&gt; the internals.

And pass that (unit tested) code into your primary class?  That way<br/>\ndo you not get the best of both worlds - and also the ability to plug in a<br/>\nnew implementation as/when required?<br/>\n<br/>\nJonathan</div>",
