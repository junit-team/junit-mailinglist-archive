This way clients can still override <br/>\n&gt; y() and z(), and call them from the subclass, but they can <br/>\n&gt; not be invoked from outside the class.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Keeping this on topic, the protected methods shouldn&#39;t be <br/>\n&gt; very difficult to test.  The test can create a MockMyClass <br/>\n&gt; that overrides y() and z() but change the modifier from <br/>\n&gt; protected to public.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, making the methods protected instead of public would work for<br/>\nsubclassing. I didn&#39;t mention that because in order to write tests that<br/>\nlive in a different package you&#39;d have to wrap the methods as you<br/>\nshowed, which adds additional, and what I would consider unnecessary,<br/>\ninfrastructure.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess for me the test for the utility of access protection is that in<br/>\nall the years and thousands of lines of Smalltalk code I&#39;ve written I&#39;ve<br/>\nwished for a number of things to be added to the language, but member<br/>\naccess protection was never one of them and it certainly doesn&#39;t make<br/>\ntesting any easier.<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\nOutgoing mail is certified Virus Free.<br/>\nChecked by AVG anti-virus system (http://www.grisoft.com).<br/>\nVersion: 6.0.528 / Virus Database: 324 - Release Date: 10/16/2003</div>",
