I \n&gt; &gt;know my tests run thru&#39; the textui, but it gives a \nclassCastException \n&gt; &gt;and a null ptr exception.\n&gt; &gt;would anyone know why?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; I suspect your changed excluded.properties file isn&#39;t in play.  \nPerhaps \n&gt; it&#39;s not in the correct package.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Also I am using net Beans, so when u say that put it in your \n&gt; &gt;classpath before the junit.jar does that mean mount it before you \n&gt; &gt;mount the junit.jar.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; It means the classpath order defines your fully-qualified \n&gt; excluded.properties file before the default one.  If &quot;mounting&quot; \ngets you \n&gt; there, then so be it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Mike\n\n\n\n",
