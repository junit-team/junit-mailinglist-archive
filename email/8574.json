JB does.  We&#39;re not alone.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I document everything. even tests!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Why?  What would happen if you didn&#39;t?  How much time is wasted by<br/>\nwriting & maintaining those comments?<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you program by intention?  Why isn&#39;t your code written to express<br/>\nwhat it does, what your intent was when you wrote it?  Why do you need<br/>\nto write that separately?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Especially since I am in a large company setting, if the next guy<br/>\n </span></blockquote>comes along at looks at my tests, he can see some of the comments I<br/>\nhave made.<br/>\n<br/>\nWouldn&#39;t it be better if they could just look at the code and see what<br/>\nit does.  If they can do that, then what use are the comments?<br/>\n<br/>\nHow do they know the comments are up to date?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Maybe not make some of the same mistakes. etc...<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If something is done a certain way for a reason (e.g. performance<br/>\ntuning, using a specific algorithm, etc.) then a short comment is<br/>\nreasonable.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It is never, ever, a bad idea to document.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, quite often it is.  If you feel the need to write a comment,<br/>\nconsider refactoring the code to make the comment unneccessary.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll this has been said in amany place by many people.  I suggest you<br/>\nread &quot;Refactoring&quot; by Martin Fowler and my new book &quot;TDD: A Practical<br/>\nGuide&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said there are valid times to document if it has value to the<br/>\ncustomer or is needed/reasonable to set up for the next game (e.g.<br/>\n&quot;maintenance&quot;).<br/>\n<br/>\nDave<br/>\n<br/>\nps.  I&#39;m thinking about writing a book on programming by intention. <br/>\nComments?  feedback?</div>",
