It&#39;s completely up to the program\n&gt; reading the file how to interpret it, including how to find any record\n&gt; boundaries in that file. \n\nIt&#39;s a nice philosophy. Hey, it&#39;s so nice I&#39;m happy with it; but I\nremember the days when there /were/ filing systems with special\nformats, and OS calls to read those formats and do the grunt work\nfor you, and what a total and absolute pain it was when &quot;it&#39;s a\nbyte stream&quot; got in the way of &quot;and this is the data&quot;.\n\n    [Editing object files on RSX-11M was, I think, the activity that\n     provoked particular horror. &quot;Editing&quot; means &quot;writing a program\n     to do systematic renaming of compiler-genrated identifiers&quot;.]\n\nI didn&#39;t think those days had gone away. Delight me.\n\n&gt; Java does exactly what the program tells it to do.\n\nThe program says &quot;read [or write] the next K bytes down this\nstream&quot;. If &quot;this stream&quot; happened to be connected to a record-\noriented file, Java should do exactly what the program says -\nwhich is to invoke the filing-system call appropriate to writing \nto that file, I would have thought, not just splattering the\nbytes randomly into the file&#39;s blocks.\n\nOne can certainly take the view that Java programs just cannot\nhandle such files on such filing systems. One may also scratch\none&#39;s head about whether this is a good thing. \n\n&gt; Applications should not be written to local conventions. Your program\n&gt; should generate the same output whether it runs on a Mac, Windows, Unix,\n&gt; or something else. It rally doesn&#39;t matter whether you pick &#92;n, &#92;r, or\n&gt; &#92;r&#92;n; but pick one and be done with it. Don&#39;t change it just because the\n&gt; platform changed. Otherwise you get into the trouble that started this\n&gt; whole thread, where  a program that works on one system fails for no\n&gt; apparent reason on another.\n\nIf there are applications on those platforms that /demand/ the\nplatform-local format - they need not be Java applications, nor\nneed they be &quot;reasonable text editors&quot; - then wilfully getting\nin their way doesn&#39;t seem to me to be good policy.\n\n[Which is why Jena&#39;s RDF/XML writer uses line.separator at a\n critical point; we had been generating RDF/XML that some \n application running on Windows Did Not Like. Having the user\n change it to a Modern Application wasn&#39;t an option.]\n\n-- \nChris &quot;electric hedgehog&quot; Dollin\nThe software engineer&#39;s song: &quot;who knows where the time goes&quot;.\n\n\n",
