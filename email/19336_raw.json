I was using a home-grown one with\n&gt; a previous employer, but that isn&#39;t (yet - I&#39;m hopeful!) open-sourced\n&gt; / externally available, so I need to make a jump to another one.\n&gt; \n&gt; I tried EasyMock (1.x) after reading JB&#39;s book a couple of years back\n&gt; - I think the state of the art has moved on somewhat since then.\n&gt; \n&gt; The closed framework that I used previously seems pretty similar in\n&gt; terms of look and feel to rMock 2.0 and JMock 2.0, but I&#39;m open to\n&gt; other suggestions.\n&gt; \n&gt; What experiences to people have to share?\n\nI wrote then that if I&#39;d been able to use JMock 1.x for real before \nwriting the book, my examples would have been with JMock 1.x. I stand by \nthat statement. I haven&#39;t used JMock 2, because I don&#39;t do Java 5, but \nif I did, I&#39;d reach for JMock 2 first. In the Java 1.4 world, I use \nJMock 1 and love it.\n-- \nJ.
