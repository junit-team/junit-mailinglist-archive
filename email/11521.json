Sometimes you can do<br/>\nthis simply by setting creating the state in setUp(), sometimes it&#39;s<br/>\nbetter to replace you test against with something you have more control<br/>\nover (that is, mock it). After all, you want to test the classes which<br/>\nuse the server, not the server itself, don&#39;t you?<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers, Ilja</div>",
