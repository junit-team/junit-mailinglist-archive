It was working fine.\nBut the developers are switching towards Eclipse (rewritting the entire\napplication using eclipse(SWT components + JFace  ) ) to gain more\nperformance.\n \n(link to eclipse ...)\nhttp://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/library/os-ecgui1/\n&lt;http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/library/os-ecgui1/&gt; \n \nThe JFCUnit can identify only swing component like (JFrame, JButton,\nJMenuBar etc ..).   \n(link to JFCUnit ...)\nhttp://jfcunit.sourceforge.net &lt;http://jfcunit.sourceforge.net&gt; \n \nThey cannot identify the SWT components.
