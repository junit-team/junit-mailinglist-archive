I always assert early on whatever assumptions my\ntest code is making about its environment, with error messages that\ninstruct the user what they need to do to fix the situation (or at least\nwhat&#39;s missing).  It&#39;s a whole lot better to see one of those error\nmessages than some other exception that occurred because an assumption\nwasn&#39;t valid.  So, in your case, I would even say that every test should\n(in the setUp method if possible) verify that everything is in place\nwith the DAO (if such verification is possible without actually changing\nthe state).  And any time a test does change the state of the system, it\nought to verify that the state is as expected.  It&#39;s basically the &quot;fail\nfast&quot; philosophy.  As you say, it&#39;s good to limit the amount of state\nchanges occurring in a single test, but sometimes it is necessary.\n \n..David..\n\n________________________________\n\nFrom: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of\nshefehs\nSent: Wednesday, December 06, 2006 1:52 PM\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: [junit] Philosophical question--Multiple assertions in one test\ncase\n\n\n\nI&#39;ve read all over the place that it&#39;s a bad idea to include multiple\nassertions in one test case, but it seems to me that sometimes it&#39;s\nvery useful. For example, I have a fairly straightforward DAO and I\nwant to test the create method. But to really test it, I need to\nretrieve it afterwards and make sure it was successfully created. And\nI need to clean it up afterwards (or the test will fail next time I\nrun it and try to create a duplicate), so I call my delete method. \nThere I&#39;ve exercised 3 methods of my DAO, not just one. So it feels\nlike it would save time to assert that each step of the process\nsucceeded. \n\nExample:\npublic void testEmployeeCRUD()\nthrows Exception\n{\nint sizeBeforeAdding = em.listEmployees().size();\n_employeeId = em.createEmployee(_fname, _lname, _jobtitle);\n\nint sizeAfterAdding = em.listEmployees().size();\nlog.debug(&quot;Created employee &quot; + _employeeId);\n//Make sure that the new list is longer than the old list\nassertTrue(&quot;Create employee failed&quot;, sizeAfterAdding&gt;sizeBeforeAdding);\n\nEmployee emp = em.getEmployee(_employeeId);\nassertEquals(&quot;getEmployee failed&quot;, emp.getLName(), _lname);\nlog.debug(&quot;Retrieved employee &quot; + emp.getLName());\n\nem.deleteEmployee(emp);\n\nint sizeAfterDelete = em.listEmployees().size();\n\n//Make sure that the length of the list after delete \n//is the same as it was before we added\nassertEquals(&quot;Delete employee failed&quot;, sizeAfterDelete,\nsizeBeforeAdding);\nlog.debug(&quot;Deleted employee&quot;);\n}\n\nThe preceding code works just fine. If the test fails, I&#39;d look in\nthe failure message to see which part of it failed, and it seems like\nthat&#39;s not too difficult. I know it&#39;s not following best practices\nbecause it calls 4 separate methods, but when I tried writing a test\nfor each of those methods, I ended up either calling the other ones in\nthe setup/teardown or by essentially recreating them in a sample data\nloading operation. I&#39;m trying to do good TDD and to convince a\ncolleague who resists unit tests at all, so I don&#39;t want to do things\n&quot;wrong&quot; but I also don&#39;t want to make life tremendously more difficult\nwithout understanding the real reason behind the recommendations.\n\nDoes anyone have any thoughts on this principle? I appreciate the\nintelligent exchanges I&#39;ve seen on the list in the past so I hope to\nget a thoughtful discussion going.\n\nThanks very much!\nJulie\n\n\n\n \n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
