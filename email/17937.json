Indeed starting with<br/>\n&gt; java 5 features in unit tests would be a good way to practice them<br/>\n&gt; without risking all on the production code.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; - Neil<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I did this when developing some stuff for MHP which is only guaranteed to<br/>\nsupport some very old JDKs. I think it was 1.1 or 1.2. I set the ant script<br/>\nto build the production code with target=&quot;1.2&quot; or such. Wanted to try out<br/>\nJDK5 features and JUnit4. Worked fine for me, but I can see it might be<br/>\ndifficult in corporate environments. I was in a situation where I was able<br/>\nto try things out so its a bit different.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Teemu<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
