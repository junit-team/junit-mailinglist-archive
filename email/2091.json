Then why does JUnit report the Exception? Why is reporting more<br/>\nthan one such assertion failure not more useful than only reporting the<br/>\nfirst? How is reporting two assertion failures different from a test<br/>\nthat manages to pack multiple booleans into a single assertTrue and<br/>\npass back the extra failure information in the message?<br/>\n<br/>\nIs it really so evil to report more information in a failure that could<br/>\nbe used for solving the problem without invoking the debuggger. I hate<br/>\ndebuggers. Even fast and good ones take a lot of time and effort to get<br/>\nto the problem (I know, I should use VAJ, but that&#39;s not how things<br/>\nhave evolved here; in part due to the integrated source control and<br/>\nsome initial problems with VM thrashing we had, VAJ got tossed). If I<br/>\nget a complete assertion failure report, I might (and often have) been<br/>\nable to fix the bug immediately.<br/>\n<br/>\nI remain unconvinced that this feature is necessary, but it seems to me<br/>\nthat we should dismiss it so quickly simply because it&#39;s hard or it<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t fit our personal definition of unit test.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards,<br/>\n<br/>\nRob<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nMake international calls for as low as $.04/minute with Yahoo!
