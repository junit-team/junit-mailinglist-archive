Basically, we have a bunch of JUnit tests that check SQL\n&gt; &quot;SELECT&quot; statements that are generated by a framework.  \n&gt; \n&gt; These tests are currently a little painful to maintain, because if you\n&gt; modify the framework so that the order of the tables, columns, or where\n&gt; clause statements changes somehow, every test has to change.  That got\n&gt; me wondering about how to do an \n&gt; \n&gt;   assertSemanticEquals(expectedSQL, actualSQL)\n&gt; \n&gt; where the order of things within each brance of the select is\n&gt; irrelevant.  For example,\n&gt; \n&gt;   select foo.col1, bar.col2\n&gt;       from bar, foo \n&gt;       where bar.id = foo.id and bar.id &gt; 4\n&gt;       order by bar.col2\n&gt; \n&gt; is semantically equivalent to\n&gt; \n&gt;   select bar.col2, foo.col1\n&gt;       from foo, bar \n&gt;       where bar.id &gt; 4 and foo.id = bar.id\n&gt;       order by bar.col2\n\nMy colleague and I are working on a research project that is\ntangentially related to this question, so I thought that I would\nprovide a few pointers and see if the JUnit community has some\ncomments or insights.\n\nWe are focusing on the testing and analysis of database-driven\napplications by testing the program, the database, and the program&#39;s\ninteraction with the database.  Our initial work has focused on the\ncreation of algorithms that can produce a representation of a program\nand its interaction with a database and then enumerate the\ndatabase-interaction associations for a new family of data flow-based\ntest adequacy criteria.\n\nOur initial goal is to determine how well tests ensure that the\nprogram does not violate the completeness and validity of the database\nthat it defines and uses with embedded SQL statements.  In the future,\nwe will be developing testing tools that aid test data generation,\ntest execution, and regression testing.  Since I frequently use tools\nlike JUnit, DBUnit, etc. for my own development, my personal goal is\nto construct a complete tool suite, based upon these existing tools,\nto handle many of these issues.\n\nMore information about the Database drIven Application Testing tOol\nModuleS! (DIATOMS) research is available at the following URL:\n\nhttp://cs.allegheny.edu/~gkapfham/research/diatoms/\n\nMy colleague and I would certainly value your comments on our FSE 2003\npaper. We also value your insights about some of the practical testing\nissues that you would encounter during the application of such test\nadequacy criteria and/or other issues related to testing database-driven\napplications.\n\nKind Regards,\n\ngreg\n\n-- \nGregory M.
