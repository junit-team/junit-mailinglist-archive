Now, I&#39;ve done this<br/>\n&gt; &gt; a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; bunch of times and JUnit is there to select as a library.

That&#39;ll be kind of weird.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sorry, I guess I wasn&#39;t clear about what I do. Let me try to clarify...<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I have an application that I&#39;m going to be testing, I create two<br/>\nprojects<br/>\nthat are in parallel directories. One holds the original program and the<br/>\nother<br/>\ndirectory holds the test classes that I develop to test the program.<br/>\nThat<br/>\nsecond project makes use of JUnit and will have classes that are<br/>\nsubclasses of<br/>\nTestCase and therefore will depend on the JUnit library. I usually use<br/>\nthe<br/>\nsame package for both projects (the app and the test app).<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a result, in the test project, I specify JUnit as a required library<br/>\nso<br/>\nthat it will build. That was what I was trying to explain in my post.<br/>\n<br/>\nI use two parallel directories and that ends up with duplicates of the<br/>\nclass<br/>\nfiles (the test project will build the test sources and the program<br/>\nsources).<br/>\nI guess you could put the test files in the same tree as the program<br/>\nfiles,<br/>\nhowever, with JBuilder, I haven&#39;t figured out how to get it to place the<br/>\ntest<br/>\nclass files in a different place (to separate test classes from app<br/>\nclasses).<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d be interested in hearing about other ways to do this...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; And also you can specify the source code jar file, which is bundled in the download, for JUnit in the library, then you can browse the source<br/>\n&gt; code of JUnit classes without extracting the files.  Personally I like this feature a lot.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Cool! I hadn&#39;t tried that. I would run JAR and extract the sources to a<br/>\ndirectory<br/>\nand then browse the files.
