I�ll volunteer to do some (or most) of the\nrewriting, with Vladimir acting as the final editor.  We can save the\noriginal comments page as a background link for the summary page.\n\nIf we base the examples on the sample code shipped with JUnit, we\nshould be able to expand these �Best Practices� topics into a very\nuseful tutorial for new users. \n\nMany thanks to J. B. Rainsberger for taking the time to put this\ntogether.\n\nMike\n\nPS to J. B. Rainsberger.  I�ve communicated with you on other issues.\n I think you could make a valued contribution in helping to rewrite\nthe summaries.\n\n\n--- Vladimir Bossicard &lt;vladimir@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Is it possible for people to just submit request, so that we\n&gt; won&#39;t overwrite\n&gt; &gt; each other&#39;s change?  I can see that this will become a hot topic\n&gt; and there\n&gt; &gt; will be cases that several people changing it at the same time.\n&gt; \n&gt; and people with different point of views trying to expose &quot;or\n&gt; impose&quot; their ideas.  I think it&#39;s a great tool and hope that\n&gt; people will be responsible and not screw up everything.\n&gt; \n&gt; So let&#39;s give it a try and see the result in a couple of weeks.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Vladimir\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nMake international calls for as low as $.04/minute with Yahoo!
