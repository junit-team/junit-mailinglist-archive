Then the catch could instantiate a new\nexception, insert the reference to the caught exception, and throw the\nnew one. The contained exception should hold the stack information\nabout the original exception. This technique is used with JMSException\nand seems to work well.\n\nThe only downside is that any code that catches the new exception must\ncheck to see if there is a contained exception and decide what to do\nwith the information.\n\nIt would have been nice if there were an interface that described the\nmethods setLinkedException and getLinkedException (or whatever you\nchoose to call them) so code could have a general way to look for\ncontained exceptions.\n\nGerry\n\n\ndsnider@... wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Anyone notice exceptions from tests only hold partial stack frames?\n&gt; This makes debugging challenging unless you trap exceptions in your\n&gt; tests making them cluttered.\n&gt;\n&gt; This appears to be a side-effect of trapping\n&gt; InvocationTargetException in TestCase.runTest(). At first sight, the\n&gt;\n&gt; fillInStackTrace call seems to be the problem. I don&#39;t believe it&#39;s\n&gt; desired in this case. It&#39;s removal, however, did not address the\n&gt; problem. The target stack frame seems to be reset by the re-throw of\n&gt;\n&gt; the target exception.\n&gt;\n&gt; Commenting out the catch of InvocationTargetException fixes the\n&gt; problem for me.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thoughts?\n\n\n",
