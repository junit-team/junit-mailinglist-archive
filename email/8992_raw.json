I guess I got involved in the\n&gt; discussion, I thought it was =\r\n(at times) useful. Since it was my first\n&gt; posting (and heck, I was throttl=\r\ned by moderation) how was I \n&gt; to know that you\n&gt; didn&#39;t want discuss on th=\r\ne list.\n&gt; \n&gt; \t&gt; I&#39;d suggest some folks should think more between \n&gt; posts o=\r\nr take a\n&gt; discussion offline until things are resolved,\n&gt; \t&gt; then come bac=\r\nk with a summary.  But this is so \n&gt; unusual for this list\n&gt; (thinking over=\r\n the past few years),\n&gt; \t&gt; it will probably return to normal soon by themse=\r\nlves.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;d like to think I&#39;ve been thinking, but hmm ... let me \n&gt; thin=\r\nk about that\n&gt; some more ... Yup, I&#39;m pretty sure I was. You judge so \n&gt; ha=\r\nrshly yet you admit\n&gt; you deleted much of what was there. Couldn&#39;t you have=\r\n just \n&gt; kept on deleting\n&gt; and kept this to yourself? No, I guess you want=\r\n a quiet \n&gt; mailing list. Ok,\n&gt; you win -- I&#39;m done.\n&gt; \n&gt; Every other OSS l=\r\nist I know says discuss here, not in private, the\n&gt; discussion is part of t=\r\nhe process & best archived for \n&gt; reference. Clearly the\n&gt; main two noise p=\r\nroducers failed to come to a summary, so \n&gt; observation by\n&gt; other was need=\r\ned. A bunch of folks jumped in with what I considered\n&gt; interesting perspec=\r\ntives, I was grateful for that, even if to \n&gt; you viewed it\n&gt; as more noise=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\t+1\n&gt; \n&gt; -1 -- but hey, I clearly don&#39;t fit here. I thought I was d=\r\niscussing\n&gt; something of small potential with the development team of junit=\r\n, but I\n&gt; clearly got that all wrong. I guess from that mistaken hypothesis=\r\n all\n&gt; conclusion is obviously worthless, so I should&#39;ve just given up when=\r\n I\n&gt; thought about giving up.\n&gt; \n&gt; I learned a lot from these threads, just=\r\n little of it was \n&gt; about junit & most\n&gt; of it was about this list&#39;s parti=\r\ncipants.\n&gt; \n&gt; No more noise from me...\n&gt; \n&gt; regards\n&gt; \n&gt; Adam\n\n",
