As such, I&#39;m presented with a fairly unique opportunity\nto\n\testablish some standard practices for unit testing.\n\t\n\tA few things are obvious. Yes, writing unit tests for all new\ncode\n\tshould be STRONGLY ENCOURAGED. Yes, the JUnit framework is what\nwe\n\twill use for launching our tests. \n\t\n\tSome are less obvious, but I&#39;m still clear on what to do. For\ninstance,\n\twriting tests that include the database are often QUITE\ndifficult. Not\n\teveryone has a copy of Oracle; we can&#39;t just erase tables\nwilly-nilly\n\tto set up for each test; etc. So I will use mock objects\n(hopefully\n\tstarting from those at www.mockobjects.com) to simulate the\nconnection,\n\tand other &quot;external&quot; data sources/sinks.\n\t\n\tAnd there are a few questions on which I&#39;d like to hear input\nfrom\n\tsome with more experience so I can start out using &quot;Best\nPractices&quot;\n\tinstead of having to learn from my OWN experience.\n\t\n\tQUESTION 1:\n\t   Where do my JUnit unit tests go?\n\t   \n\t   I see 3 likely answers... (a) make each an inner class of the\n\t   class being tested, (b) for every class &quot;Foo&quot; have a class\ncalled \n\t   &quot;TestFoo&quot; in the same package, or (c) have a separate (but\nparallel\n\t   hierarchy of classes... SOURCE/com/pkg/Foo.java is tested by \n\t   TEST/com/pkg/TestFoo.java.\n\t\n\t   I lean towards (c) because it makes it easy to build the\n&quot;real&quot; code\n\t   and the &quot;test&quot; code separately, and omit the &quot;test&quot; code from\n\t   production deployment. Are there other significant issues\nhere? \n\t \n\tI prefer approach C \n\t\n\t\n\tQUESTION 2:\n\t   How do I automatically build the suite of all tests?\n\t\n\t   For each class, I can have several methods called &quot;testXxx()&quot;\nand\n\t   can collect them into a suite to run at once. I can collect\nthe\n\t   suites together into larger suites, eventually coalescing\ninto a\n\t   suite called &quot;RunAllTests&quot; which does just that. But this\nrequires\n\t   me to write each of these suites, and to remember to include\neach\n\t   and every test class. I&#39;d rather if &quot;RunAllTests&quot; just\nmagically\n\t   found all of the tests... that way I couldn&#39;t forget to\ninclude\n\t   one and wind up with some tests that never get run just\nbecause I\n\t   forgot a line in a suite. How do I create this &quot;magical&quot; \n\t   RunAllTests?\n\t\n\t   Stray thought... if there&#39;s no simple solution in straight\njava,\n\t   I wonder if ant can help me to achieve RunAllTests as an ant\n\t   target? \n\t \n\tUse ant with the junit task \n\t\n\t\n\tQUESTION 3:\n\t   How do I &quot;turn on&quot; my mock objects when tests are running?\n\t\n\t   The most straightforward use of mock objects is to pass them\n\t   directly to the code being tested. However, (despite the fact\nthat\n\t   this is a bit broader than simply &quot;unit&quot; testing), I plan to\nhave\n\t   a lot of tests that exercise an entire sub-system at once.\nFor\n\t   example, I might create the input file, run the command, and\nthen\n\t   test the output file. But if this &quot;command&quot; opens a\nconnection to\n\t   a database (or other system), then I&#39;d like to return a mock\n\t   ResultSet instead of a real one. So the code that obtains a\nDB\n\t   connection has to look at some global setting to see if we&#39;re\nin\n\t   &quot;test mode&quot; or &quot;real life&quot;. What is a good way to achieve\nthis --\n\t   is it something I&#39;ll have to write for myself?\n\t \n\tI you are doing test-driven-development you will notice your\ndesign starting to evolve around your tests such that things naturally\nbecome easily testable.  One approach we have taken is to use a\nDynamic-Factory where the type of object returned (real or mock) is set\nat run time and then loaded using Class.forName(). \n\t\n\tI&#39;m sure I&#39;ll have more questions also, but this email is QUITE\nlong\n\tenough as is. Thanks in advance for any feedback, suggestions,\nor\n\tpointers to other forums/FAQs for this kind of stuff.\n\t\n\t-- Michael Chermside\n\t \n\t \n\tAs for links to FAQ&#39;s the official one is found on the junit.org\nwebsite at http://junit.sourceforge.net/doc/faq/faq.htm\n\t--Josh \n\t\n\t\n\t\nYahoo!
