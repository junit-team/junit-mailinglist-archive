Our framework starts services and agents that look something like this:<br/>\n<br/>\nclass ExampleAgent implements IAgent {<br/>\n<br/>\n\tpublic static IAgent createAgent(...) { ...}<br/>\n<br/>\n\tpublic void start() {<br/>\n\t\t// Assumption is that this will start the agent in a thread and return.<br/>\n\t}<br/>\n}<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce an agent is started it has access to various services supplied by the Framework; its these services I&#39;d like to unit test. I&#39;d guess that I need to create a IAgent that extends JUnit&#39;s TestCase and implements the functionality of JUnit&#39;s main methods. I&#39;d also like the tests to run using either JUnit&#39;s GUI or its text driver.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny tips would be a great help. Thanks.<br/>\n-Christopher Helck</div>",
