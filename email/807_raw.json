I say keep the feature (and all of its blessings), but\n&gt; don&#39;t make it the default behavior.  I.e., don&#39;t put people in a position\n&gt; that they have to find out the hard way.  Let&#39;s cause JUnit 3.6 to have a\n&gt; &quot;-loader&quot; flag that would enable the ReloadingTestSuiteLoader.  When that\n&gt; flag isn&#39;t given, then JUnit will use Java&#39;s default class loader.\n&gt; Then, JUnit&#39;s default class loading behavior will be Java&#39;s default\n&gt; class loading behavior.  It&#39;s more intuitive that way anyway.\n&gt; \n&gt; Discussion is warmly invited, as long as it&#39;s professional.  Flames to NLA0:\n\nI learned about the class loader issue a year ago.  The instant I have\na wierd problem with a test, I run it twice, once under swingui and again\nwith textui.\n\nIf it runs under textui but not swingui, my next step is to add -noloading\nto swingui.  That has always solved the problem, and -noloading goes \nright into the project&#39;s launcher from that point onward.\n\nThis loading/noloading trick is necessary for JNI debugging as well,\nbecause with JNI the JVM will load a library at most once, no matter\nwhat classloader is involved.\n\nI have no difficulties with the current default behavior.  The GUI\ninterfaces, which you like to leave up and running, must obviously\nbe using the custom classloader, because otherwise you&#39;re just restesting\nold classes already in the JVM.  TextUI doesn&#39;t stay running and doesn&#39;t\ntake long to load, so it doesn&#39;t use the custom classloader.\n\nBeyond beating this topic into the ground in the documentation, I don&#39;t\nsee the need to change anything in JUnit.\n\n-- \nJoi Ellis                    Software Engineer\nAravox Technologies          joi@..., gyles19@...\n\nNo matter what we think of Linux versus FreeBSD, etc., the one thing I\nreally like about Linux is that it has Microsoft worried.  Anything\nthat kicks a monopoly in the pants has got to be good for something.\n           - Chris Johnson\n\n\n",
