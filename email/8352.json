An external test could then invoke<br/>\nthe query to ask, &quot;did you pass or fail&quot;?<br/>\n<br/>\nOf couse, any desire to keep such methods out of the production<br/>\nobjects leads to interesting and problematic design issues, but<br/>\nit might be worth adding additional methods like:<br/>\n    eventNotificationListIncludes(EvenListener el)<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is no &quot;get&quot; in this system, but the test can still verify<br/>\nthat the internal state is as expected, using state-verification<br/>\nmethods intended for that purpose.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Open question: Should such a method return a boolean or throw<br/>\nan exception??)</div>",
