I&#39;ll see if I <br/>\nget any response.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have also been using Hudson and have an &#39;issue&#39; with JUnit there too, <br/>\nbut can&#39;t quite decide whether to start here or there. What I would like <br/>\nis a class of test which is known to fail, yet is still run on each <br/>\ncommit, but doesn&#39;t block acceptance (largely because the &#39;bug&#39; has been <br/>\nthere for years). I want to be reminded that these bugs are still there <br/>\nand also be advised if any are unintentionally fixed. This would also <br/>\nallow someone who discovers a bug to check in a test which illustrates <br/>\nthe problem, while being unable to fix it themselves (whether for lack <br/>\nof skill or time).<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards,<br/>\nMark<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; On Fri, May 21, 2010 at 1:10 PM, Mark Thornton<br/>\n&gt; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mark.p.thornton@...\">mark.p.thornton@...</a> &lt;mailto:mark.p.thornton%40ntlworld.com&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Running the whole set works fine, but in IDEA at least attempting<br/>\n&gt; &gt; run/debug an individual item doesn&#39;t work. Or rather it almost does. I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; tried adding two constructors to the class intending that one would be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; used for the parameterised runs and the default constructor would apply<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to the individual tests. Unfortunately JUnit complains about having more<br/>\n&gt; &gt; than one constructor.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; We currently work around this by using a second class which delegates to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the parameterised test class.
