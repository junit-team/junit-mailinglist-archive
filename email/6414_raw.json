Webber - Jentro AG&quot; \n&lt;John.Webber@j...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; For quite a while I used the static inner classes technique, but \nfound \n&gt; that with time our source files were getting too cluttered.\n\nWhat do you mean by &quot;cluttered&quot;.  I just put the inner class at the \nbottom of the source file.  The demarcation of app code and the test \ncode is very clear.\n\n&gt; I&#39;ve now moved to putting my test cases in a parallel directory \nwith the \n&gt; same package structure,\n\nDon&#39;t you find it more of a hassle to manage seperate files, in \nseperate directories, especially while checking your code in and out \nof a source code repository?  What if you forget to check in the test \ncode?  Presumably you could script this, but that&#39;s just another \nhassle.\n\n\n&gt; and if I really need to test a private method I \n&gt; change the access to package-private and can then test it directly \nfrom \n&gt; a test class in the same package, but in a different source tree. \nWith a \n&gt; few good Ant targets and/or scripts this works nicely. Still, \nchanging a \n&gt; private method representing an implementation detail to package-\nprivate \n&gt; seems to be a code smell!\n\nAmen.\n\n\nMike\n\n\n\n\n\n",
