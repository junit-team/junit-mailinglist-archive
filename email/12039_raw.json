So it\n&gt; might be more something like acceptance tests. \n\nWhat are you writing the tests for? Do you want to check wether the system \nworks or do you want to be able to refactor without fear of breaking \nthings?\n\nI&#39;d usually write tests for such a system on-demand. Only when a \ncode-change is needed or a bug found will I write a test. Large-scale \ntest-writing &quot;because we should&quot; is not worth it IMHO.\n\n&gt; Since we still have to exactly figure out what we want to test, I\n&gt; would appreciate some information about whether or not JUnit is the\n&gt; right choice in general (alternatives?) and some advices for my &quot;test\n&gt; last&quot; approach. \n\nI&#39;ve been using JUnit in a similar situation (I maintain/extend a \nframework that was built without any UnitTests) and I&#39;ve successfully used \nJUnit for not-quite-unit Tests. Other tools have been suggested \n(Fit/Fitnesse come to my mind) but I&#39;ve not seen anything yet that makes \nit worth to convert the 150+ Tests that exist.\n\n&gt; Thanks in advance,\n&gt; Thomas\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n",
