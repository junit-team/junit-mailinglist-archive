The problem which u are facing is quite common and more often we do encounter this kind of problems. I do have encountered the same problem when i used to write the JUNIT for some WebApplications in Eclipse. \n \nBasically ClassNot Found Exceptions we do  get because of the following reasons: Do try the following solutions and let me know if this could solve ur problem. \n \n1. Did u import the package for the corresponding directory structure for the java file which u are going to write the JUNIT code. I mean to say that in the TestCase.java file did u import the corresponding package? If not lets try doing that. \n \n2. Also Did u set the CLASSPATH in the Environment Variables? If not please set it and try. \n \nLet me know if these could solve ur problem. \n \nRegards\nSuresh\n \n\n\n&quot;Balasubramaniam, Ram Ganesh (Cognizant)&quot; &lt;BRamGanesh@...&gt; wrote:\n\nBalasubramaniam, Ram Ganesh (Cognizant) wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; hai,\n&gt;       I am doing my Web Application in Eclipse and Test Run by JUnit.\n&gt;\n&gt;       When I write a TestXXX for a class XXX , and run it , it gives me\n&gt; a error &quot;Class not Found&quot; .
