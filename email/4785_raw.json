How will you\n&gt; test &quot;procedures&quot; that do work instead?\n\nTest the side-effect of the work.  This may involve querying an instance\nvariable or passing in a mock object somewhere to collect the results of the\nwork.  The latter is sometimes useful to avoid breaking encapsulation.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; (It is &#39;against the rules&#39; to change the design of them to return\n&gt; values - a testing tool should not force code changes.)\n\n(I&#39;ll assume you are the designer in this case.)\n\nJUnit is as much a design tool as it is a testing tool.  Your tests are\neffectively asking the code questions, the expected answers to which are\nasserted.  If it&#39;s difficult to ask a question such that the right answer can\neasily be asserted, then the code is communicating something very important\nabout the design.  Writing tests first, I&#39;m constantly changing the design of\nthe code, in very small steps.\n\n\n&gt; 2) How will you test procedures that are composed of several\n&gt; functions?\n\nI generally have a test for each method, and then a test for the composite\nmethod.  Sometimes not.  It&#39;s a judgment call.  For me, it really depends on\nthe test-first path I&#39;m on when those methods are born.\n\nI recommend trying both ways and see what works best for you.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; 3) Can JUnit ever replace stepping thru with a debugger?\n&gt;\n\nI can&#39;t remember the last time I used a debugger.  I used to use a debugger\nquite often to step through the code and manually inspect that the variables\nalong the way contained the values I expected.  Once in a while I&#39;d even get\nlazy and dump a System.out.println() somewhere in the call stack to list all\nthe variables and their values.  Worse yet, I&#39;d go through this sanity check\nevery time something changed.  Then I recognized this as nothing more than\nmanually comparing expected vs. actual values.\n\nSo I started to resist the urge to fire up the debugger and instead try to\nwrite an automated test.  Sometimes I just put the assertion directly in the\ncode as a way to start thinking about what I would need to write a unit\ntest.  Often times the design changes to make the code more testable. Short\nand cohesive methods were one immediate improvement.  In return the design\nseems to exhibit some desirable properties.\n\nWriting the tests first really speeds up this feedback loop.  It distills\ntestable code and better designs from the beginning.  I write all new code\nthis way these days.  If I&#39;m debugging existing code, I&#39;ll try my best to\nfind a way to write automated tests to retain the value of the debugging\nsession over time.\n\nMike\n\n--\nMike Clark\nClarkware Consulting, Inc.\nhttp://www.clarkware.com\n720.851.2014\n\n\n\n",
