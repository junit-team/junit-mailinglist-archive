I want to write test cases that refere=\r\nnce interfaces only\n&gt;  as I want to publish them as part of a spec =96 they=\r\n are to define the\n&gt;  semantics of classes.\n\nWhen faced with this situation=\r\n in the past I separated the tests into\n&quot;white box&quot; and &quot;black box&quot; parts.\n=\r\n\nThe black box parts I implemented as assertions about the behaviour\nimplie=\r\nd by the interface.\n\nThe white box parts I implemented as unit tests that p=\r\nut a known\nimplementation into a known (significant) state and then passed =\r\nit to\na black-box assertion.\n\nE.g. I might have two implementations of List=\r\n: LinkedList and ArrayList.\n\nI would have assertions that I can add an elem=\r\nent onto the end of the\nlist and retrieve the last element, adding an eleme=\r\nnt increases the\nsize by one, etc. etc..\n\nI would have tests for the implem=\r\nentations that exercised specific\ninternal states.  For example, for an Arr=\r\nayList I would have tests\nthat added an element to an empty list, to a list=\r\n that has a full\narray that needs to be expanded, etc.  Those tests would c=\r\nall the\nassertions.  Something like:\n\n  import static ListAssert.assertAddi=\r\nngAnElementIncreasesTheSizeByOne;\n\n  ...\n\n  @Test public void\n  addingAnEle=\r\nmentIncreasesTheSizeByOne() {\n       assertAddingAnElementIncreasesTheSizeB=\r\nyOne(new ArrayList());\n\n       List listAtCapacity =3D new ArrayList(4);\n  =\r\n     listAtCapacity.addAll(Arrays.asList(1,2,3,4));\n       assertAddingAnEl=\r\nementIncreasesTheSizeByOne(listAtCapacity);\n   }\n\nIf those tests got too la=\r\nrge (as above), I&#39;d break them into separate\ntest methods.\n\n--Nat\n\n",
