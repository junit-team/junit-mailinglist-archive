Thus the only public methods I want to see is read(file) and execute()\nthrows TestFailException.\n\nNow, do you think that a sufficient test is to supply some working and\nnon-working test spec examples a see if the right ones fail? Of course not.\n\nIn fact, such examples are common in applications which contain more complex\nfunctionality than data shuffling, and the notion than testing public\nmethods is sufficient is just plain wrong. Consider simulators, rule\nengines, planners etc.\n\nBtw, I don&#39;t like to have my unit tests in the same package, but I don&#39;t\nlike the alternative either. What we need is a friend construct. Tests\ncommonly needs a backdoor to classes, and so does parsistence layers. There\nis a diference between the system level and business level interface of\nclasses.\n\n-- \nJon S Bratseth, Zenior AS\n\n&gt; -----Opprinnelig melding-----\n&gt; Fra: Miles, Eric SAXONHQ [mailto:milese@...]\n&gt; Sendt: 14. mars 2002 23:35\n&gt; Til: &#39;junit@yahoogroups.com&#39;\n&gt; Emne: RE: [junit] Where to place test classes?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;d have to agree with Mr. Rainsberger.  I see no need to \n&gt; test methods other\n&gt; than public.  My reasoning is public method types are what&#39;s \n&gt; exposed to the\n&gt; public, therefore, test them well.  If the class is primary used via\n&gt; inheritance, I&#39;ll write test methods for the protected \n&gt; methods as well.\n&gt; Otherwise, I don&#39;t bother with private method types.  They&#39;re \n&gt; indirectly\n&gt; tested through the methods they support.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: J. B. Rainsberger [mailto:jbr@...]\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, March 14, 2002 5:20 PM\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: Re: [junit] Where to place test classes?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;Another purpose for using JUnit is to create tests\n&gt; &gt;first and then write code.  For those that take this\n&gt; &gt;approach to development, they would probably want a\n&gt; &gt;test for each method.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m sorry to be blunt, but absolutely not.\n&gt; \n&gt; In TFP, the goal is to test every feature -- that is, every \n&gt; bit of behavior \n&gt; you care about. Implementation details are unimportant and, \n&gt; in fact, testing\n&gt; \n&gt; them on their own often impedes refactoring. Since tests are meant to \n&gt; provide the &quot;safety net&quot; during refactoring, they should try \n&gt; not to get in \n&gt; the way of refactoring, if they can avoid it.\n&gt; \n&gt; If you have one feature that uses four or five private \n&gt; methods behind a \n&gt; single public method, then it&#39;s best simply to test the \n&gt; public method. If \n&gt; you find a bug in there, then that may be a clue about your \n&gt; design: perhaps \n&gt; what you perceive as an implementation detail is something \n&gt; bigger that \n&gt; should be in its own class. At that point, the method becomes \n&gt; public and \n&gt; voila, you can test it. (Or package-level, if you prefer that \n&gt; route and \n&gt; place your tests in the same package as the production code.)\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;A test for each method&quot; is a bad thing. &quot;Tests for each \n&gt; feature or service&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; is a Good Thing.\n&gt; \n&gt; J.
