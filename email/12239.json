Let&#39;s presume I&#39;ve reached<br/>\n&gt;the stage where I have successfully implemented the rules engine along<br/>\n&gt;with a full suite of unit tests. Would I be violating any canons by<br/>\n&gt;having JUnit output its results in some text-like form to enable quick<br/>\n&gt;comparisons between result sets of different rules changes ? Is there<br/>\n&gt;a more elegant way to accomplish this ? I&#39;m essentially trying to come<br/>\n&gt;up with a quick way to tell the user &quot;When you change Rule # 5 that<br/>\n&gt;way, loans 1, 4 and 7 fail but 2,3 and 89 now pass.&quot;.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>JUnit (like other xUnits) is meant to test whether your code behaves <br/>\ncorrectly with respect to the requirements. It seems like you want to <br/>\nuse JUnit to &#39;experiment&#39; with your rules. If you have a set of loans <br/>\nthat should be accepted and a set of loans that should not be accepted, <br/>\nyou could write tests for these (perhaps parameterized tests to make <br/>\nthings easier, so you only need to write two tests) and experiment as <br/>\nyou like. You can also write a custom TestListener that reports test <br/>\nsuccess and failure in a result file, that also reads the file(s) with <br/>\nthe rules and writes them to the same result file, so you later have an <br/>\noverview which rule set performed how (make sure you write to a new file <br/>\neach time, so you can compare, or append at the of the file). In this <br/>\ncase you would also need a custom TestRunner, to write the rules to the <br/>\nresult file when the testsuite starts.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n  Mark Van Peteghem<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.q-mentum.com\">http://www.q-mentum.com</a> -- easier and more powerful unit testing</div>",
