Can I use it\n&gt;  &gt; in place of Clover?\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes, you can use it in place of Clover (several\n&gt; account teams at my company have switched and I am\n&gt; getting emails from external users to the same effect\n&gt; as well). Of course, there will always be feature\n&gt; differences between source code instrumentation-based\n&gt; (Clover), bytecode instrumentation-based (EMMA), and\n&gt; JVMPI-based tools (many other commercial tools).\n&gt; \n&gt; No, EMMA has not been integrated into Maven (yet),\n&gt; although this has been much requested as soon as it\n&gt; was published outside of Trilogy. This feature will be\n&gt; implemented in near future (another developer is\n&gt; joining the project soon specifically to address this\n&gt; area) but I don&#39;t think this is a gate for starting to\n&gt; use EMMA now.\n\nWell, for my purposes, code coverage isn&#39;t /so/ important. I would only \nuse it, at this point, as integrated with Maven. Perhaps it&#39;s not so \ndifficult to do. I&#39;d just have to try it out, I suppose.\n\nAt any rate, thanks for sharing. I&#39;m sure some of our members will find \nit quite interesting.\n-- \nJ. B.
