I haven&#39;t ha=\r\nd a\nchance to take a deep look at your work, but look forward to doing so.\n=\r\n\nThe motive for creating a new breaking version would be several-fold:\n\n- P=\r\nrimarily, it&#39;s always been my opinion that a unit-testing framework\nshould =\r\n&quot;fit the grain&quot; of the host language.  It is looking like the\ntransition fr=\r\nom Java 7 to 8 will be an even bigger shift in the grain of\nJava than betwe=\r\nen 4 and 5.  There&#39;s been a lot of things we&#39;ve wanted to do\nall along with=\r\n JUnit that I&#39;ve designed first in my head the way they would\nhave worked i=\r\nn a language with lambdas, and then redesigned to fit the\ngrain of a lambda=\r\n-less language.  Assertions (and mocks) have especially\ncontorted themselve=\r\ns in ways that they might finally now be able to relax.\n\n- Secondarily, per=\r\nsonally, there are some core decisions made very early in\nthe design of JUn=\r\nit 4 that are beginning to show their age, and are hard to\nfigure out how t=\r\no fix while leaving everything intact:\n  - The fact that a Description is b=\r\noth the immutable single name of a test\nnode, and a mutable builder for the=\r\n test structure, and then later an\nimmutable reference for the test structu=\r\nre, is exasperating.\n  - The reliance on reflectively-discovered constructo=\r\nrs for extensibility\ncauses some awkwardness.\n  - The IDE-centric idea that=\r\n one should be enable to enumerate all tests\nbefore any is run places some =\r\nbinding constraints, and should be at most\noptional in a world in which tes=\r\nts are often run by daemons many more times\na day than by humans.\n  - There=\r\n are as many perfect models of test status possibilities as there\nare devel=\r\nopers.  Passed/Failed?  Passed/Failed/Skipped?\n Passed/Failed/Ignored, etc.=\r\n  The current design bakes one required system\npretty deep into the interna=\r\nls, unnecessarily.\n\nNow, should the framework to which I&#39;d contribute time =\r\nto fix these\nproblems be called JUnit 5, or something entirely different?  =\r\nThat&#39;s\nanother kettle of fish, with some interesting options to consider.  =\r\nLooks\nlike we have at least 9 months to consider them at length.\n\n   David =\r\nSaff\n\n\nOn Wed, Dec 12, 2012 at 5:40 PM, Esko Luontola &lt;esko.luontola@gmail.=\r\ncom&gt;wrote:\n\n&gt; **\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ve written a testing framework called Specsy (http=\r\n://specsy.org/) that\n&gt; runs on Scala, Groovy and also Java. Though it works=\r\n on Java 7, the\n&gt; syntax is awfully verbose [1], but with Java 8&#39;s lambdas =\r\nit will be\n&gt; quite close to the Groovy version [2]. The motivation for crea=\r\nting\n&gt; Specsy was to have test isolation (like JUnit and JDave), nested tes=\r\nts\n&gt; (like JDave and Scala&#39;s specs), and instead of &quot;after methods&quot; it has\n=\r\n&gt; more expressive defer blocks (like Golang).\n&gt;\n&gt; [1]\n&gt;\n&gt; https://github.co=\r\nm/orfjackal/specsy/blob/master/specsy-java/src/test/java/org/specsy/java/Ja=\r\nvaSpecsyExample.java\n&gt; [2]\n&gt;\n&gt; https://github.com/orfjackal/specsy/blob/mas=\r\nter/specsy-groovy/src/test/java/org/specsy/groovy/GroovySpecsyExample.groov=\r\ny\n&gt;\n&gt; Right now I&#39;m implementing a new test runner called Jumi\n&gt; (http://ju=\r\nmi.fi/) to overcome a bunch of limitations of the JUnit test\n&gt; runner, as e=\r\nxplained in http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DGgi6yutRZ9Y\n&gt; During this wint=\r\ner holiday I should be able to add support for test\n&gt; discovery, maybe also=\r\n JUnit backward compatibility, after which it\n&gt; should be usable for early =\r\nadopters (right now it&#39;s usable only for\n&gt; testing framework developers - S=\r\npecsy 2.0 runs on Jumi).\n&gt;\n&gt; What does this have to do with JUnit 5?\n&gt;\n&gt; - =\r\nFirstly, both of these frameworks I mentioned had clear goals to do\n&gt; some =\r\nthings that were lacking in JUnit and other frameworks. What are\n&gt; the goal=\r\ns for JUnit 5? What would be such a radical improvement that it\n&gt; would war=\r\nrant a major release (that breaks compatibility, basically\n&gt; being a new te=\r\nsting framework) instead of minor 4.x releases?\n&gt;\n&gt; - Secondly, if you deci=\r\nde to create a &quot;JUnit 5&quot; that is a radical change\n&gt; from JUnit 4, instead o=\r\nf an incremental update, then please keep an eye\n&gt; on Jumi. If JUnit 4&#39;s te=\r\nst runner is not enough for JUnit 5, then it\n&gt; could run using Jumi instead=\r\n of creating yet another test runner. That\n&gt; would save time from yourself =\r\nand all the tool vendors who would need to\n&gt; integrate with any new test ru=\r\nnner.\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt; Esko Luontola\n&gt; www.orfjackal.net\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n[Non-text portions=\r\n of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
