B. Rainsberger [mailto:jbr@d...]<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ...<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So the only thing you gain with the suggestion above is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; forcing the code to be aware of the Exception possibility of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; your code.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes: I submit that that is what tests are for. (If you&#39;re <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; here, then you&#39;re writing tests, after all.)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Isn&#39;t documentation the thing that should be used to tell the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; writer of code that calls yours what your code is supposed to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; do, or what the caller is supposed to do (or not do)?  (At<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; least for code meant to be re-used, such as that implementing<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; an API?)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Yes, it is. Please explain to me why unit tests are not <br/>\n&gt; &gt; documentation. :)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; i think with respect to checked exceptions your code has advertised,<br/>\n&gt; unit tests are not documentation about how to react to such<br/>\n&gt; exceptions. &lt;snip /&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Indeed, they are not, nor can they be.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; but the intent of checked exceptions is to signal abnormalities from<br/>\n&gt; which, in the opinion of the designer, client code should be<br/>\n&gt; reasonably expected to recover. &lt;snip /&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This, combined with the preceding, makes me ask this question:<br/>\n<br/>\n    If the intent of checked exceptions is to signal a situation<br/>\n    from which the caller is expected to decide how to recover, then<br/>\n    how is it possible for the code under test to suggest how to<br/>\n    recover from such exceptions?<br/>\n<br/>\nPresumably, if the code under test knows how to recover from the exception, <br/>\nit would handle the exception itself; however, it throws the exception, <br/>\nsaying, &quot;I don&#39;t know what to do here. You figure it out.&quot; In the latter <br/>\ncase, there is nothing to document except &quot;You have to catch these <br/>\nexceptions.&quot; I agree that this information is not properly conveyed by unit <br/>\ntests; however, it is entirely conveyed by the signature of the method. No <br/>\nadditional documentation is likely required.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not saying the additional documentation is *bad*, necessarily; but it <br/>\nought to be questioned. It is usually not required.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; great discussion!  i haven&#39;t turned my back on checked exceptions,<br/>\n&gt; but i&#39;m handling them in my tests much differently, in a way that<br/>\n&gt; hopefully will make refactoring in the presence of checked exceptions<br/>\n&gt; less painful.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s the goal: to use them better. You help me to do it; I help you to do <br/>\nit. We all win.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJ. B.
