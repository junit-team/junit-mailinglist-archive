I am actually writing several hundred \n&gt; test cases for code written by someone else - working \n&gt; this way it makes much more sense to test a feature to \n&gt; death in a single test case rather than writing a separate \n&gt; test case for each aspect of a feature.  I have test cases \n&gt; that include 100 assertions with up to like 80 failures \n[...]\n\nWhat you are doing sounds like acceptance testing. Unit testing with JUnit\nis intended to QUICKLY show that all tests pass while you are refactoring,\nor that only one test fails when you are writing test-first code.\n\nAcceptance testing usually tests that the application satisfies the user&#39;s\nStories... failures are allowed (and expected) for un-implemented stories.\nKent Beck describes the results of Acceptance testing to be a number like\n&quot;89% of tests pass&quot;.\n\nas someone else has said:\n\n&gt;I use JUnit for application-level acceptance testing of web applications\n&gt;(using HttpUnit - see http://httpunit.sourceforge.net) as well as just unit\n&gt;testing, and having something like this I would find extremely useful.\n&gt;\n&gt;For example, I could then do something like:\n&gt;\n&gt;  Page loginPage = getLoginPage();\n&gt;  check(loginPage.existenceOfFeature1());  // important, but not fatal\n&gt;  check(loginPage.existenceOfFeature2());  // important, but not fatal\n&gt;  assert(loginPage.existenceOfFeature3()); // fatal, cannot procede if\nfails\n\nYou can extend JUnit to define &quot;check&quot; to increment the number of passes or\nfailures without throwing the exception that &quot;assert&quot; throws.\n\n\n",
