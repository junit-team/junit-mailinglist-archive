Definitely.\n&gt;\n&gt;But probably NOT within my desired eff=\r\nort level. ;-)\n\nUnderstood, but if it has to be done, then it has to be don=\r\ne....\n\n&gt;  &gt;BUT. As I\n&gt;  &gt;refactor, as code grows, the suites (being separat=\r\ne from the tests) are\n&gt;.\n&gt;  &gt;but that seems a level of manual effort/manage=\r\nment that is counter\n&gt;  &gt;productive -- and hence counter testing. IMHO anyt=\r\nhing that can be\n&gt;better\n&gt;  &gt;done by a computer ought be done by a computer=\r\n.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Maintaining test suites is not counterproductive if you have a need =\r\nto\n&gt;maintain test suites. If you need to maintain test suites to do your wo=\r\nrk,\n&gt;then maintaining test suites is, by definition, productive.\n&gt;\n&gt;We are =\r\nfailing to communicate. Either I am wrong and stubbornly failing to\n&gt;see yo=\r\nur point (not impossible), or I am not explaining my issues w/ suites\n&gt;well=\r\n enough...\n\nPerhaps a concrete example would be best here, if you are inter=\r\nested in getting to the bottom of things, as it were.\n\n&gt;I agree that suites=\r\n are a way to group tests and manage test group\n&gt;hierarchy, however they ar=\r\nen&#39;t (IMHO) a good tool for managing test\n&gt;hierarchies. \n\nAgree. They aren&#39;=\r\nt a tool for managing test hierarchies at all -- they *are* the test hierar=\r\nchies.\n\nJUnit provides a simple, default way to build a test suite from a T=\r\nestCase subclass. Beyond that, it&#39;s your job to build the suite you want. M=\r\ny point is simple -- and I think you keep missing it -- do whatever you nee=\r\nd to build a test suite, but don&#39;t mistake those custom building process fo=\r\nr something that belongs in the framework. Don&#39;t confuse TestSuite, which i=\r\ns part of the framework, with creating instances of TestSuite, which is you=\r\nr job. To make it simpler, JUnit provides one way to do it....\n\n&lt;snip /&gt;\n\n&gt;=\r\nI guess I\n&gt;figure that if there is an easier way for developers to maintain=\r\n test\n&gt;dependencies, one that improves test results failure analysis, then =\r\ntesting\n&gt;will be more effective/efficient. That seems nicely &quot;test infectin=\r\ng&quot; and\n&gt;hence junit-like, to me.\n\nBuild the suites however you need to.\n\n&gt;S=\r\nure, I may be re-inventing the wheel -- and dumbly thinking I have\n&gt;somethi=\r\nng new -- but I am attempting to pressure test that here. I&#39;m making\n&gt;one m=\r\nore step at explaining (see next reply to yours below). Please keep an\n&gt;ope=\r\nn mind to this as an optional addition/alternative to suites. \n\nIt&#39;s not an=\r\n addition to suites. It&#39;s a way to build suites.\n\n&gt;If you\n&gt;just\n&gt;can&#39;t see =\r\nit, then so be it. I think the problem with the example I&#39;ve\n&gt;given\n&gt;are th=\r\nat they are too small & simple. Perhaps the difference can&#39;t be\n&gt;explained =\r\nby simple example.\n\nI invite you to provide a larger example, if you like.\n=\r\n\n&gt;If the method I am proposing makes sense for a decent chunk of the user\n&gt;=\r\ncommunity, and makes junit more productive for that use case, then I see it=\r\n\n&gt;as a good alternative to test suites (which I feel are becoming obsolete =\r\nby\n&gt;test collectors). \n\nFrom what I understand, a Test Collector is a way t=\r\no build a TestSuite. JUnit executes TestSuite objects. It appears that you =\r\nare talking about a new kind of Test Collector that uses some dependency me=\r\ntadata about tests. That&#39;s very cool stuff, but it&#39;s not an extension to JU=\r\nnit: it is a particular use of JUnit.\n\n&gt;No reason why both couldn&#39;t be avai=\r\nlable.\n\nIndeed.\n\n&gt;I  believe I am saying/seeing a different between a human=\r\n maintaining\n&gt;disjointed groupings (suites) and a human maintaining simple =\r\nassertions of\n&gt;dependency of a testcase on other testcases (or suites, I gu=\r\ness), and the\n&gt;engine (runner) calculating the dependency order. I guess I =\r\nam describing a\n&gt;declarative mechanism (like ant) verses .. what would one =\r\ncall it ...\n&gt;procedural?\n\nThen it *is* what I think it is. You&#39;re just talk=\r\ning about a TestSuite factory that uses markup to create TestSuite objects.=\r\n Again, it does not belong in the JUnit framework, but rather as an add-on =\r\ntool.\n\n&gt;  &gt;What suite would I create?\n&gt;\n&gt;  I would create the suite I know =\r\nI need. But then, I don&#39;t view\n&gt;integration\n&gt;tests by the objects they test=\r\n: I view them by the features they support.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;My examples were just simp=\r\nle ones. Dependency can be in the eye of the\n&gt;beholder... :-)\n\nI don&#39;t know=\r\n that it can be: dependency is or is not.\n\n&gt;  &gt;I would like to be able to s=\r\net X to depend upon Y/Z (almost a &quot;dynamic\n&gt;  &gt;suite&quot;) and set A on Y and Z=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt;  If *you* are setting it, then how is that different from what I sugge=\r\nst?\n&gt;Either a computer program determines the mapping, or you determine the=\r\n\n&gt;mapping. How you EXPRESS the mapping is just a matter of implementation\n&gt;=\r\ndetails. Start by maintaining the suite by hand, notice the patterns in the=\r\n\n&gt;way you do things, then script it.\n&gt;\n&gt;Declarative verses &quot;procedural&quot;.\n\nI=\r\nmplementation details.\n\n&gt;Gak, why script it? That isn&#39;t going to fit into m=\r\ny eclipse, or ant tasks,\n&gt;usage w/o some pain. Some things aren&#39;t worth doi=\r\nng unless they are\n&gt;accepted\n&gt;by the core.\n\nVery well, automate it however =\r\nyou please.\n\n&gt;  &gt;Is what I am discussing unreasonable? It seems an easy int=\r\nerface for\n&gt;users,\n&gt;  &gt;and something that junit could manage behind the sce=\r\nnes.\n&gt;\n&gt;  I just don&#39;t think it&#39;s part of JUnit. It&#39;s a new Test Runner, pe=\r\nrhaps.\n&gt;It&#39;s a specialized Test Suite Builder. But the framework already su=\r\npports\n&gt;what you want; someone just has to do the work of building it.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;Why not? Suites serve a purpose, why couldn&#39;t declarative. I agree, it\n&gt;me=\r\nans\n&gt;changes to the runner, but maybe that is warranted in this age of\n&gt;ant=\r\n/eclipse test collectors...\n\nMaybe I misunderstand Test Collectors -- point=\r\n me to something to learn more, if you don&#39;t mind -- but don&#39;t they just cr=\r\neate TestSuite objects?\n\nYour way to declare a test suite is already suppor=\r\nted by JUnit and a little cute refactoring.\n\nConsider the AllTests pattern.=\r\n I can reduce it to a collection of AllTests or TestCase class names with a=\r\n little neat refactoring. Then I can use that little engine to store AllTes=\r\nts as text. The next step is to generate that text by doing a directory sca=\r\nn. Now I have a TestSuite builder that build tests from a part of the file =\r\nsystem.\n\nI did nothing to change JUnit. I just decorated it. Does it belong=\r\n in the framework? I don&#39;t think so. That&#39;s a question of taste, in my opin=\r\nion.\n\nSo I think we understand each other quite well -- I just don&#39;t unders=\r\ntand why you think this feature you suggest should be part of the framework=\r\n? Why isn&#39;t it a candidate for JUnit-addons or something like that?\n\nRememb=\r\ner that my goal -- Kent&#39;s goal, too -- is to keep JUnit very tight and smal=\r\nl. It should provide just enough for everyone, rather than a glut of featur=\r\nes that have limited use. The less to learn, the better. If you need more, =\r\ngrab add-on package X, add-on package Y and add-on package Z.\n\nAlso, the mo=\r\nre magic in the package, the less the users need to learn to use it. I want=\r\n them to know what they&#39;re doing.\n\nTake care.\n\n\nJ. B.
