But I\n&gt; think it might be\n&gt; worth thinking about passing in the base folder to\n&gt; your class under test\n&gt; (Dependency Injection Pattern) rather than having\n&gt; the class computing\n&gt; it.  In situations like that I sometime use in my\n&gt; class under test a\n&gt; setter method for a base folder that I only use in a\n&gt; test environment.\n&gt; The class under test checks if the folder is already\n&gt; set, if not, it\n&gt; does the standard behavior in computing the current\n&gt; folder, etc. You\n&gt; could have a check for null and since the setter\n&gt; method is not used in\n&gt; production, the variable would be null in\n&gt; production.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Andreas\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Andreas Guther\n&gt; \n&gt; www.markettools.com\n&gt; \n&gt; Ph.
