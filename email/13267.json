Yet even so, JUnit can <br/>\neasily test this.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood testing practices suggest that we don&#39;t test abstract classes, <br/>\ninstead we focus our testing efforts upon the most derived classes - as <br/>\nthese are the ones who are going to be used and could well override <br/>\nfunctionality defined in base classes.  Therefore we might just have two <br/>\ntestcase classes:<br/>\n<br/>\nclass FirstMostDerivedTests extends Testcase {}<br/>\nclass SecondMostDerivedTests extends Testcase {}<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, if during development of these tests, we find duplication, it <br/>\nmight be worthwhile in creating an abstract base class for the tests, so <br/>\nthat help methods could be defined and used by both. Likewise, it might <br/>\nbe appropriate for the abstract testclass to contain &#39;some&#39; unittests <br/>\nwhich are applicable to both classes under test. <br/>\n<br/>\ne.g. the tests above become:<br/>\n<br/>\nclass AbstractTests extends Testcase{}<br/>\n<br/>\nclass FirstMostDerivedTests extends AbstractTests {}<br/>\nclass SecondMostDerivedTests extends AbstractTests {}<br/>\n<br/>\nWe might however decide that instead of using inheritance, regardless of <br/>\nthe fact that the class under test use inheritance, that we use <br/>\nassociation instead.<br/>\n<br/>\nAndrew</div>",
