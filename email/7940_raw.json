But, measuring coverage (and quality with a tool like JesTer)\nis useful with a group that is still learning to TDD properly.  It&#39;s\nnot so much looking for full coverage as an indication that all is\nright, it&#39;s more looking for holes in the coverage that indicate that\ntests are missing.  And, yes, 100% is unrealistic because there will\nalways be things that don&#39;t need testing.. like toString methods that\nare to make test results more meaningful.\n\nDave\n\n\n",
