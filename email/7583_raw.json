B. Rainsberger&quot; &lt;jbrains@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Two things.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1. Think about how to change your design so that your test \n&gt; doesn&#39;t need to\n&gt; &gt; read/write CSV files. This is the better option of the two \n&gt; I offer you.\n&gt; &gt; 2. If you really can&#39;t do (1), then look at TestSetup for \n&gt; information about\n&gt; &gt; one-time setup.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Good luck.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; So said jakespigl3 on 4/7/2003 --------------------\n&gt; &gt; Hi,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Being new to junit and the world of unit testing, how do I eliminate\n&gt; &gt; part of the setup from being torn down and setup again for \n&gt; each test?\n&gt; &gt; It seems like a bit of  a waste of time.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The part of the setup I am talking about is writing a csv \n&gt; file for the\n&gt; &gt; purposes of getting the class under test to read it. There will be a\n&gt; &gt; test case to write a report  too - based on the contents of \n&gt; the file.\n&gt; &gt; There will only be one test case to test the read functionality.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; How do should I proceed?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; regards\n&gt; &gt; jfc\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
