For instance, maybe the private methods<br/>\nshould really be pulled out and placed in their own<br/>\nclass, which could have public methods, but the old<br/>\nclass would have a private instance of the new class.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy take on this . . . put them in the same package, or<br/>\ndon&#39;t, user inner classes, or don&#39;t, whatever (I&#39;ve<br/>\nseen too many flames about this issue to last me a<br/>\nwhile) . . . just make sure you test what should be<br/>\ntested.  There&#39;s always a way to make it (more)<br/>\ntestable.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Eric<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Vladimir Bossicard &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:vladimir@...\">vladimir@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; I see no need to test methods other than public<br/>\n&gt; &lt;snip&gt; I&#39;ll write <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  &gt; test methods for the protected methods as well.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So why do you test protected methods if there&#39;s no<br/>\n&gt; need to test methods <br/>\n&gt; other than public?  Simply because it depends. <br/>\n&gt; Sometimes you want to <br/>\n&gt; test protected methods, sometimes you don&#39;t.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My point is: placing tests classes so that it is<br/>\n&gt; _impossible_ to test <br/>\n&gt; protected methods is a &quot;bad&quot; decision because you<br/>\n&gt; restrict your <br/>\n&gt; flexibility.  By placing test classes in the same<br/>\n&gt; package, you still <br/>\n&gt; have that flexibility, but you don&#39;t have to use it<br/>\n&gt; if you don&#39;t want to.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; - Vladimir<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -- <br/>\n&gt; Vladimir Bossicard<br/>\n&gt; www.bossicard.com<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
