I use ANT to run Jcoverage on my Junit <br/>\ntests (bascially copied and pasted the ANT script with a few <br/>\nmodifications in the Jcoverage example directory for my project)... <br/>\nthe &lt;junit&gt; xml lang/tasks that you use within ANT, is there <br/>\nsomewhere where it is defined and can read about it somewhere?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, Jcoverage itself, when u click on an html report and see yellow <br/>\nlines... that means the unit tests didnt &#39;go over&#39; those lines of <br/>\ncode, hence they were not tested/&#39;covered&#39;?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat if my prog in the GUI creates all the Objects by reading in a <br/>\nfile/not given with args[]. how can u unit test that? modify code so <br/>\nit uses instead a file on command line? or u wouldnt test that as its <br/>\nnot a individual &#39;unit&#39;?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanx,<br/>\nArian</div>",
