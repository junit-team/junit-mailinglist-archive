If I declare more specific exceptions,\n&gt;  &gt; a la\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;     public void testAFile() throws FileNotFoundException {\n&gt;  &gt;         ...\n&gt;  &gt;   }\n&gt; \n&gt; I always declare the most specific exception, as well.  Then when\n&gt; someone (me!) comes back to see how the code under test is supposed to\n&gt; work, the exception(s) that can be raised is explicit.  That is, the\n&gt; test is an example of how the code is intended to be used.  Client code\n&gt; can always just catch Throwable, but the test documents the bare\n&gt; minimum.\n\nI haven&#39;t had this particular need, which explains my practice. \nSometimes I do need to know which exceptions I expect code to throw from \nwhich I can be reasonably expected to recover. I find that information \nin two different places:\n\n1. The Javadoc for the production code, explaining why it throws each \nkind of checked exception. (Recoverable error &lt;=&gt; checked exception)\n\n2. In tests that demonstrate the conditions under which the code throws \nan expected exception.\n\nWith these both in place, I haven&#39;t found it useful to /additionally/ \nconstrain a test to the specific, checked exception classes it might \nthrow. Since I&#39;m not going to catch them, I don&#39;t find it useful to know \nwhich ones they are.\n\n&gt;  &gt; then I can document why it might fail:\n&gt;  &gt;     @throws FileNotFoundException when the test file &quot;foo&quot; is not\n&gt;  &gt; found, but\n&gt;  &gt; it should always be found. This might indicate a problem with ...\n&gt; \n&gt; Of course, that information can also be documented in the form of a\n&gt; negative test.  It&#39;s fun to write a test that raises an expected\n&gt; exception.  The artifact of that fun is an example of what and how\n&gt; exceptions can be raised.\n\nAbsolutely.\n-- \nJ. B.
