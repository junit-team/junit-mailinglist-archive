But somehow moving the clases into another project broke \n&gt; something in junit.\n&gt;\n&gt; The packagenames of these classes are still the same as they were \n&gt; before. I read the FAQ about problems people have had with the \n&gt; swingui testrunner not working when the textui testrunner works \n&gt; fine... Last week, I had the same problem (classcast exception - \nwith \n&gt; Objectivity, not ObjectStore) that was described in the FAQ, and so \nI \n&gt; made up an exclude.properties file which fixed that problem already.\n&gt; \n&gt; #\n&gt; # The list of excluded package paths for the TestCaseClassLoader\n&gt; #\n&gt; excluded.0=sun.*\n&gt; excluded.1=com.sun.*\n&gt; excluded.2=org.omg.*\n&gt; excluded.3=javax.*\n&gt; excluded.4=sunw.*\n&gt; excluded.5=java.*\n&gt; excluded.6=com.objy.*\n&gt; excluded.7=com.archiserve.*\n&gt; excluded.8=COM.odi.*\n&gt; \n&gt; But now, when I try to run a test under the swingUI,\n&gt; I get the following error, printed in the bottom status bar, in red.\n&gt; \n&gt; Failed to invoke suite():java.lang.VerifyError:\n&gt; (class:com/archiserve/dal/test/TestOid, method: putObject signature\n()\n&gt; V) Incompatible object argument for function call\n&gt; \n&gt; just fyi, testOid is a test suite in its own right, and I was \ntrying \n&gt; to run a suite of suites there via TestEverything.\n&gt; \n&gt; When I try to run TestOid directly, it just hangs when trying to \nload \n&gt; the test case.\n&gt; \n&gt; Clicking the &quot;reload classes every run&quot; doesn&#39;t seem to do anything.\n&gt; \n&gt; But again, all works fine under the textui testrunner.\n&gt; \n&gt; Any other ideas?\n\n\n",
