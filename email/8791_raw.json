B. Rainsberger&quot; &lt;jbrains@r...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; &gt;So said Dave Astels on 2003-07-24 --------------------\n&gt; &gt;--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;J. B. Rainsberger&quot; &lt;jbrains@r...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;JB&#39;s right on the money.  Factor the command line parsing into it&#39;s\n&gt; &gt;own class.  Then it&#39;s encapsulated and can be cleanly refactored in\n&gt; &gt;isolation.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Once you&#39;ve done this, main() calls the parser, then does stuff \nlike\n&gt; &gt;this:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; new MyClass(\n&gt; &gt;&gt;     (Integer) args.get(&quot;blah&quot;),\n&gt; &gt;&gt;     (String) args.get(&quot;foo&quot;),\n&gt; &gt;&gt;     ...\n&gt; &gt;&gt; );\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; A little ugly, due to the casting, but not horrible.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Yes.. the joys of a straight-jacket language.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Face it, it&#39;s hard to write Java, C++, C#, etc that isn&#39;t ugly.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; 2. That main() passes the parameters correctly to MyClass&#39; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; constructor?\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Rather than expose getX() methods, add equals() that compares \ntwo \n&gt; &gt;&gt; MyClass objects and answers true if their fields have the same \n&gt; &gt;&gt; values. Then in your test, set up the &quot;expected MyClass&quot; with the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; argument values you expect main() to pass in and use assertEquals\n() \n&gt; &gt;&gt; to compare them.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Another option would be to pass a clean instance to the command \nline\n&gt; &gt;parser, which then acts as a builder.. calling setters on the\n&gt; &gt;instance.  Then you can pass in a mock to be built.. with \nexpectations\n&gt; &gt;as to *how* it will be built.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hello! Ding ding ding.... that&#39;s nice.\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. Put the sets on an interface.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2. Expose get/set on Test Implementation and submit it to the \nbuilder. This tests that the builder calls the interface&#39;s sets \ncorrectly.\n&gt; \n&gt; 3. Don&#39;t expose get on Production Implementation because the \noutside world doesn&#39;t need them.\n&gt; \n&gt; I like it.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; J. B. Rainsberger,\n&gt; President, Diaspar Software Services\n&gt; Let&#39;s write software that people understand.\n&gt; http://www.diasparsoftware.com/\n&gt; telephone: +1 416 791-8603\n\nSorry I have some difficult to understand your great suggestions due \nto my new to Junit. So far, I know that I need separate the command \nline parsing into two steps. First is to transfer command line args \nto a builder. Second is to use the builder to set the private member \nvariables. I could understand the first step to use equivalent \noperation to compare two builder class objects. However, I have some \nsort of difficult to understand the Second step. Could you provide \nsome code snippets to give more concrete explanations? Thanks very \nmuch!\n\n\n",
