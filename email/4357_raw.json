For instance, maybe the private methods\nshould really be pulled out and placed in their own\nclass, which could have public methods, but the old\nclass would have a private instance of the new class.\n\nMy take on this . . . put them in the same package, or\ndon&#39;t, user inner classes, or don&#39;t, whatever (I&#39;ve\nseen too many flames about this issue to last me a\nwhile) . . . just make sure you test what should be\ntested.  There&#39;s always a way to make it (more)\ntestable.\n\n-Eric\n\n--- Vladimir Bossicard &lt;vladimir@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; I see no need to test methods other than public\n&gt; &lt;snip&gt; I&#39;ll write \n&gt; \n&gt;  &gt; test methods for the protected methods as well.\n&gt; \n&gt; So why do you test protected methods if there&#39;s no\n&gt; need to test methods \n&gt; other than public?  Simply because it depends. \n&gt; Sometimes you want to \n&gt; test protected methods, sometimes you don&#39;t.\n&gt; \n&gt; My point is: placing tests classes so that it is\n&gt; _impossible_ to test \n&gt; protected methods is a &quot;bad&quot; decision because you\n&gt; restrict your \n&gt; flexibility.  By placing test classes in the same\n&gt; package, you still \n&gt; have that flexibility, but you don&#39;t have to use it\n&gt; if you don&#39;t want to.\n&gt; \n&gt; - Vladimir\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; Vladimir Bossicard\n&gt; www.bossicard.com\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
