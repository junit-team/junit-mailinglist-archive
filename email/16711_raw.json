The system is about 95% batch. Several other \nposts have sub=\r\nmitted ideas on how you might do this. I wish I had \nrealized that there we=\r\nre tools out there to do this because I wrote it \nall myself. As you can se=\r\ne there are options, so hopefully you will \nnot need to do all the work tha=\r\nt I did.\n\nHowever, I did come up with a few techniques that you might find =\r\n\nhelpful. I keep all of the input files in a directory called TestData. \nTh=\r\ne structure of this directory is identical to my source directory. \nTherefo=\r\nre any test input files required by a.b.c.TestCase1 will be \nfound in the T=\r\nestData/a/b/c/TestCase1 directory.\n\nI have a BaseTestCase that has a number=\r\n of methods that will return \nthe handle to afile from the current TestCase=\r\n directory, in the form \nof a fileNameString, File, InputStream, etc. to th=\r\ne satisfy the input \nrequirements of the methods that I am testing. To acce=\r\nss the file, you \ncall the appropriate method and give it the file name (wi=\r\nthout the \ndirectory structure). The beauty of this approach is that you al=\r\nways \nknow where you data is and if you refactor your class and move it to =\r\n\nanother package, you simply move you TestData directory to the \ndirectory =\r\nthat corresponds to your new package name.\n\nFor comparison purposes, I have=\r\n the identical structure in a directory \ncalled TestResults. Since typicall=\r\ny only one file or XML would be \ncompared per test method, I store the test=\r\n results in a file with the \nsame name as the test method, followed by eith=\r\ner .txt or .xml. I came \nup with the following little trick to get the test=\r\n method name:\n\n    String testMethodName =3D new Exception().getStackTrace(=\r\n)\n[0].getMethodName();\n    System.out.println(testMethodName);\n\nThe first t=\r\nwo lines of all of our test methods are always these two \nlines. It is very=\r\n helpful to display the test method name in the \nsystem.out so you figure o=\r\nut which test method sys prints that must be \nadded from time-to-time to a =\r\ntest method came from. We pass the \ntestMethodName to the methods in our Ba=\r\nseTestCase that do the file and \nXML compares. This class figures out the d=\r\nirectory from the class name \nand we keep the root directory, which changes=\r\n dependent upon \nenvironment, in a properties file.\n\nI also added an option=\r\n in the constructor of the BaseTestCase to \nindicate when the compare metho=\r\nds are executed whether they should do \none of the following:\n1. compare th=\r\ne files and fail if the prior results not found\n2. compare the files if the=\r\n prior results found, otherwise write the \nnew results to the file\n3. write=\r\n the new results to the file.\n\nWe almost always have option 2 turned on. Wh=\r\nen the results change and \nwe verify that the change is valid, we simply de=\r\nlete the old file and \nrun the test again. It is working very well for us.\n=\r\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;kavithask_98&quot; &lt;kavithask_98@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n Hi,\n&gt; After running unit test, the output generates an xml file which has =\r\n\n&gt; say more than 300 lines.\n&gt; Now, I need to verify this with the expected =\r\nxml file. Since, I have \n&gt; lot of testcases like this it is not possible to=\r\n verify manually.\n&gt; Does Junit support this feature like comparing any two =\r\nfiles \nchecking \n&gt; for the difference and then if something is not matching=\r\n, showing me \n&gt; the testcase and the lines due to which has failed.\n&gt; \n&gt; If=\r\n yes, how to do the same.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks in adavance,\n&gt; Kavitha\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
