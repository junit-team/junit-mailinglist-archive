I&#39;d be leery of a class that generates HTML and sorts. If the<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;&gt;sort is an another class, it can be public and far easier to test.<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;I&#39;ve always wondered why most developers are highly offended by making<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;things more public for purposes of testing, yet they have no problem<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;consistently and willingly violating cohesion. I suspect that it&#39;s the<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;same reason most developers worry about performance more than good<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;design: it&#39;s easier to quantify.<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt; I think that lack of protection is just easier to see. Lack of cohesion<br/>\n&gt; requires trained eyes. I have to admit that every time I teach the<br/>\n&gt; &#39;Single Responsibility Principle&#39; I feel a little odd. It&#39;s not like<br/>\n&gt; you can use a check list which tells you whether you&#39;re violating it or<br/>\n&gt; not, you just have to show people enough examples for them to &#39;get it.&#39;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It reminds me of the Supreme Court of the US. There was a time when<br/>\n&gt; obscenity cases were all the rage. Producers of movies, pictures, and<br/>\n&gt; stories were prosecuted all the way up to the Supreme Court on obscenity<br/>\n&gt; grounds, and the Court was unable to articulate a definition of<br/>\n&gt; obscenity which drew a line between pornography and free speech. Some<br/>\n&gt; Saturdays the Justices would get together to view the films in evidence<br/>\n&gt; and make their decision. Justice Potter Stewart said (paraphrasing) &quot;I<br/>\n&gt; may not be able to define obscenity, but I know it when I see it.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It&#39;s similar to the Polgar method to learn to play chess well. Look at <br/>\nPolgar&#39;s book &quot;Chess&quot;: nothing but thousands of diagrams, categorized by <br/>\ntheme (&quot;mate in 1&quot;, &quot;mate in 2&quot;, &quot;double attack&quot;...) with no <br/>\nexplanation, but rather just solutions in the back. At some point, after <br/>\nlearning the basic principles and goals, you just need to be drilled <br/>\nwith examples. Playing good tactical chess is certainly related to good <br/>\ntactical design, just as reading the board and reading code are related. <br/>\nThey&#39;re languages, and we seem to acquire them effectively by seeing <br/>\nlarge numbers of examples and detecting patterns.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ.
