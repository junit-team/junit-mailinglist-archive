Writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Also, Agitator can help retrofit tests to legacy code, however it <br/>\n&gt; /doesn&#39;t/ help you identify the specific design problems in that code, <br/>\n&gt; nor does it motivate you to improve the design. This might or might not <br/>\n&gt; concern your team at this time.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is Alberto jumping in again to set the record straight on<br/>\nAgitator ...<br/>\n<br/>\nHi Joe, you might not remember me but we exchanged emails a couple of<br/>\nyears ago, and I am a big fan of yours for all the work you have done<br/>\nto educate people about JUnit through your book and online presence.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway ... your description of using Agitator to complement TDD is<br/>\nspot-on (for people who do TDD) - thank you for jumping in and helping<br/>\nin setting the record straight.  But you also state (I paraphrase):<br/>\n&quot;Agitator does not help you identify design problems or motivate you<br/>\nto improve the design&quot;.  We have actually found, somewhat<br/>\nserendipitously, that Agitator does indeed help you in identifying<br/>\ndesign problems and even provides you compelling motivations to<br/>\naddress them (e.g. well designed code Agitates better).<br/>\n<br/>\nA simple example, of Agitator helping you improve your design is<br/>\nblogged on developertesting.com:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.developertesting.com/archives/month200402/20040226-TestDrivenDevelopmentAndAgitatorDrivenRefactoring.html\">http://www.developertesting.com/archives/month200402/20040226-TestDrivenDevelopmentAndAgitatorDrivenRefactoring.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, this does not mean that Agitator replaces TDD, but it can<br/>\ncomplement TDD efforts (our own Dashboard product was developed<br/>\npracticing TDD, pair-programming, etc., AND Agitator of course).<br/>\n<br/>\nAlberto</div>",
