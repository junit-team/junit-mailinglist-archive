This is where Interfaces show their true<br/>\nstrength.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Jason<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 9/5/06 8:54 PM, &quot;J. B.

Excess complexity<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;  &gt; They make receiving a message more complex, it&#39;s true. They make<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;  &gt; sending a message much simpler. Or rather, they add more lines of<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;  &gt; code on the receiving side; but they eliminate dependencies on the<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;  &gt; sending side. The benefit of those eliminated dependencies is very<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;  &gt; powerful.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; I&#39;m not sure I believe the second part. In practice, replacing a<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; concrete-class based solution with an interface-based solution expands<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; the complexity for the caller. What used to require a single class now<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; typically requires three: a factory to create the factory, the factory<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; itself, and the interface you&#39;re actually trying to create. I&#39;m not sure<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; you really need all that, but you need at least two pieces where you<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; previously needed one, and in practice three is what we usually seem to<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; end up with. (Think of DocumentBuilderFactory, DocumentBuilder, and<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Document in JAXP/DOM for example). And of course there are still<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; concrete classes for each of these. We&#39;ve turned what could have been<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; one concrete class (Document) into six separate pieces! What could have<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; been this:<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Document doc = new Document();<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; is now this:<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; DocumentBuilderFactory factory = DocumentBuilderFactory.getInstance();<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; DocumentBuilder builder = factory.newDocumentBuilder();<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Document doc = builder.newDocument();<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Be careful! The Builder pattern is by no means needed to create an<br/>\n&gt; instance of an interface. JAXP/DOM combines, for whatever reason, the<br/>\n&gt; Singleton, Abstract Factory and Builder pattern, when all you really<br/>\n&gt; need is this:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Document document = new WritableDocument();<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I could see using the Builder pattern to simplify the interface for<br/>\n&gt; constructing a document, separating creating a document from reading it,<br/>\n&gt; but by no means does JAXP/DOM do what it does because of /interfaces/.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s true that if you have a bunch of related interfaces (like in a GUI<br/>\n&gt; toolkit), you might want an Abstract Factory, but neither Singleton nor<br/>\n&gt; Builder enter the picture just because you have interfaces.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; I fail to see how that&#39;s simpler.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s not, and interfaces didn&#39;t make it more complex: the Singleton,<br/>\n&gt; Abstract Factory and Builder patterns did. If this is a representative<br/>\n&gt; example of why you find interfaces unnecessarily complex, then I really<br/>\n&gt; believe you&#39;re blaming the wrong part of the design.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Take care.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>",
