Since simply the level of the tests is not\nsufficient to decide where to test, I thought a bit more about how I should\ndecide where to test. I came to three criteria:\n* The cost of writing and running the test\n* The stability of the interface the test is, errr..., testing\n* The reliability of the code satisfying the test\n\nI wrote this up in a little paper:\nwww.threeriversinst itute.org/ WhereToTest. html. Comments welcome.\n\nKent Beck\nThree Rivers Institute\n\n    \n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
