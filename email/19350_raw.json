I\n&gt; chose the words carefully because I believe that *some* dogma is\n&gt; necessary - one has to have a basic position, some ground on which to\n&gt; stand - hence the phrase &quot;LESS unit testing dogma&quot; as opposed to &quot;NO\n&gt; unit testing dogma.&quot;\n\nPerhaps I&#39;m just reacting strongly to the term &quot;dogma&quot; because I have \nbeen accused of being dogmatic in the past when I honestly believe I \nhave not been. That might be it.\n\n&gt; Testivus itself can be seen as dogmatic in a few places. For example,\n&gt; &quot;If you write code write tests&quot;, is not exactly wishy-washy about the\n&gt; fact that developers should test.\n\nIndeed.\n\n&gt; The epigram &quot;Don&#39;t get stuck on unit testing dogma&quot; is aimed as much at\n&gt; Testivus as it is to anything else, and the key part of the sentence is\n&gt; &quot;Don&#39;t get STUCK&quot;, don&#39;t let blind following of dogma kill your\n&gt; creativity or your flexibility.\n&gt; \n&gt; I hope this clarifies things somewhat.\n\nI suspect the issue is on my side of the fence, and not yours.\n-- \nJ.
