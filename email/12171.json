The answer that I received<br/>\n&gt; was to use a decorator. It works this way. But I cannot execute a<br/>\n&gt; test with its decorator in Eclipse. So I cannot use it.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I strongly disagree. Certainly you can. Read on.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;ve coded something like this in the main method to solve the<br/>\n&gt; problem:<br/>\n&gt; TestDecorator myTestSetup = new MyTestSetup(new SupplierArticleTest<br/>\n&gt; (&quot;testInitialValidation&quot;));<br/>\n&gt; junit.textui.TestRunner.run(myTestSetup);<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What you&#39;re doing here defeats the purpose of one-time setup/teardown. <br/>\nUsually, one does this:<br/>\n<br/>\npublic class DecoratedTestSuite {<br/>\n     public static Test suite() {<br/>\n         return new MyTestSetup(new TestSuite(TestCaseToDecorate.class));<br/>\n     }<br/>\n}<br/>\n<br/>\nNow MyTestSetup.setUp() executes, then all the tests in <br/>\nTestCaseToDecorator, followed at last by MyTestSetup.tearDown(). Is this <br/>\nwhat you want?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf so, then you should be able to right-click DecoratedTestSuite in <br/>\nEclipse and run it as JUnit tests, because it has a suite() method.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;pause /&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI just tried it, and it works.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The most straightforward thing would have been if I had two<br/>\n&gt; additional methods in the TestCase: setUpTestCase() and<br/>\n&gt; tearDownTestCase(). Both would be called only once, the first, when<br/>\n&gt; the test (all test methods in a TestCase) starts and the last when<br/>\n&gt; the test ends (all test methods in a TestCase).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s exactly what TestSetup already does, so there&#39;s no need to add <br/>\nthat behavior to TestCase.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ.
