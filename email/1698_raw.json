I know \n    &gt; that there are\n    &gt; options I could use outside of VA such as ANT to only \n    &gt; build certain classes,\n    &gt; but I doubt I could get the client to buy into that and I \n    &gt; still don&#39;t think\n    &gt; that solves the private method issue.\n    &gt; \n    &gt; Am I just missing something easy or what?\n    &gt; \n    &gt; Thanks,\n    &gt; Mike\n    &gt; \n    &gt; \n    &gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n    &gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n    &gt;  \n    &gt; \n    &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
