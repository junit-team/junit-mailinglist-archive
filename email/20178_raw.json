What I learned\n&gt; is that when I had a test case that was a subclass of TestCase (to be\n&gt; specific, my test case was a subclass of a subclass of TestCase), I had\n&gt; the &quot;Unrooted Test&quot; problem.  When I made a test case in a new project\n&gt; from scratch that didn&#39;t extend TestCase but only used @Test\n&gt; annotations, Eclipse didn&#39;t run the unrooted tests.\n&gt;\n&gt; When I get some more time, I want to dig into it more and try to figure\n&gt; out why this is the case.  But I&#39;m stuck in backlog estimation for the\n&gt; next 3 days, and then it&#39;s Christmas.  So I may not have time to\n&gt; investigate any more until the new year.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Todd.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of\n&gt; edu_kumar\n&gt; Sent: Monday, December 17, 2007 7:44 PM\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt; Subject: Re: [junit] what&#39;s an &quot;Unrooted Test&quot; and why can&#39;t I find\n&gt; anything online about\n&gt;\n&gt; Hey Todd,\n&gt;\n&gt; I too got the same issue, If I execute only one unit test case as\n&gt; opposed to the whole class.

In the olden days, with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Eclipse 3.0 and JUnit 3.8, I could select a single test method in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the Outline view and run just that method.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Nowadays, whenever I try to do that, Eclipse&#39;s test runner runs all\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the tests in the class. The results are shown in a tree, and the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; tests I didn&#39;t ask to be run are all under a node called &quot;Unrooted\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Tests [Runner: JUnit 4]&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; So, I figured there must be some simple explanation, and immediately\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; did a Google search. And it found nothing on topic. So I searched\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the Eclipse documentation and website for &quot;unrooted tests&quot; and again\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; got nothing. So I searched on this Yahoo Group&#39;s message archive,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and again found nothing.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Am I the only person in the world who has ever had this problem with\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; running a single test method from Eclipse? Or am I searching for the\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; web&#39;s most suppressed secret?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Someone please tell me you&#39;ve seen this problem too! And why is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; there nothing written up about these mysterious &quot;Unrooted Tests&quot; in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; all the places I looked?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Cheers,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Todd.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ----\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; .\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
