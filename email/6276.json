I run every test every time I<br/>\nbuild!<br/>\nI think about the code while it&#39;s building (even code sometimes)! This gives me every assert I<br/>\nneed on any class wrote every time I build my code ... I think that&#39;s continuous integration.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is no substitute to hard-work.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease comment !<br/>\n<br/>\n--Neo<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- &quot;J. B.

When tests are expensive to write, I<br/>\n&gt; encourage everyone to take whatever time is necessary to discover the<br/>\n&gt; design improvement that we&#39;re all missing. On most projects, the cost<br/>\n&gt; is recovered.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;2) What are the tools you use for creation of unit tests, if any?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m not sure what you mean here. If you are talking about automatically<br/>\n&gt; generating tests or even test skeletons, I don&#39;t believe in it. TDD is<br/>\n&gt; a human activity.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;3) Do you prefer using tools for unit tests creation?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; See my answer to (2)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;4) We use JBuilder in our development efforst. What would you advise<br/>\n&gt; us to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;go for to reduce our development overheads associated with unit tests?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am not (yet) familiar with JBuilder, so I cannot comment. If JBuilder<br/>\n&gt; helps you, then continue using it; otherwise, stop.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;5) What do you guys think of cactus?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have never used Cactus. I prefer to test outside the container.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; J. B.
