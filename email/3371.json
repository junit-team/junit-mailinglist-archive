So since I <br/>\ncan run the tests in awtui, the problem is not as much of an <br/>\ninconvenience as it was before.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In junit@y..., &quot;Alan E&quot; &lt;yahoogroups@o...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Using Junit 3.7 with Borland Jbuilder 4 windows NT.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I just took a bunch of ObjectStore-specific code out of my main<br/>\n&gt; project and placed it into another project, so I could access it <br/>\nlike <br/>\n&gt; an external library.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Before this, I was able to run the test suites in the swingUI no <br/>\n&gt; problemo. But somehow moving the clases into another project broke <br/>\n&gt; something in junit.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The packagenames of these classes are still the same as they were <br/>\n&gt; before. I read the FAQ about problems people have had with the <br/>\n&gt; swingui testrunner not working when the textui testrunner works <br/>\n&gt; fine... Last week, I had the same problem (classcast exception - <br/>\nwith <br/>\n&gt; Objectivity, not ObjectStore) that was described in the FAQ, and so <br/>\nI <br/>\n&gt; made up an exclude.properties file which fixed that problem already.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; #<br/>\n&gt; # The list of excluded package paths for the TestCaseClassLoader<br/>\n&gt; #<br/>\n&gt; excluded.0=sun.*<br/>\n&gt; excluded.1=com.sun.*<br/>\n&gt; excluded.2=org.omg.*<br/>\n&gt; excluded.3=javax.*<br/>\n&gt; excluded.4=sunw.*<br/>\n&gt; excluded.5=java.*<br/>\n&gt; excluded.6=com.objy.*<br/>\n&gt; excluded.7=com.archiserve.*<br/>\n&gt; excluded.8=COM.odi.*<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; But now, when I try to run a test under the swingUI,<br/>\n&gt; I get the following error, printed in the bottom status bar, in red.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Failed to invoke suite():java.lang.VerifyError:<br/>\n&gt; (class:com/archiserve/dal/test/TestOid, method: putObject signature<br/>\n()<br/>\n&gt; V) Incompatible object argument for function call<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; just fyi, testOid is a test suite in its own right, and I was <br/>\ntrying <br/>\n&gt; to run a suite of suites there via TestEverything.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; When I try to run TestOid directly, it just hangs when trying to <br/>\nload <br/>\n&gt; the test case.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Clicking the &quot;reload classes every run&quot; doesn&#39;t seem to do anything.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; But again, all works fine under the textui testrunner.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Any other ideas? </span></blockquote></div>",
