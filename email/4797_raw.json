This makes perfect sense.  Tests which rely on \nexternal resources are  not self-contained, are harder to read, and can be \nbroken even if the code is functioning correctly.  However, code does touch \nexternal resources at some point.  Shouldn&#39;t this be tested, and how?\n\nSpecifically, I have code that parses a xml catalog file and builds a \ncatalog object structure.  I want to verify that the parsing works \ncorrectly.  In particular, I want to make sure that it robustly handles \nunusual conditions such as catalogs with certain branches missing.  It \nseems to me that the simplest way to do this is to have a test which uses \nthe parsing code to parse a very simple catalog and verifies that it builds \nwhat I expect it to.\n\nBut to do this test I do need some external resource, a simple catalog \nfile.  Ok.  Now I can&#39;t simply look at the test to see what it does.  I \nalso have to look at the file.  Are there cleaner alternatives?  Must I \nsimply accept that there will occasionally be external resources required \nto test functionality at the boundaries of the system?  If so, are there \nbest practices for this scenario?  Am I missing something?  I&#39;d love to \nhear peoples thoughts.\n\n\n\nDavid Olivier\nNaval Research Laboratory\nDigital Mapping, Charting & Geodesy Analysis Program\nCode 7440.2\n\n\n",
