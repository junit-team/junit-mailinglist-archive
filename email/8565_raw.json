If your concern \n&gt; is package scope testing, you can still accomplish this from \n&gt; separate directories by using the same packaging in separate \n&gt; directories. For example\n&gt; \n&gt; src_java\n&gt;   - com\n&gt;     - somewhere\n&gt;       - widget\n&gt;         - MyWidget.java\n&gt; src_java_test\n&gt;   - com\n&gt;     - somewhere\n&gt;       - widget\n&gt;         -MyWidgetTest.java\n&gt; \n&gt; Since the test class is stored in a separate source tree packaging \n&gt; is easy (everything from the src_java directory). However since the \n&gt; two source trees share the same packaging you can still test down to \n&gt; the package-private scope.\n&gt; \n&gt; If you have some other reason for having your tests coesist...\n\nWhat I usually do is starting with app classes and test classes in the same\npackage and in the same directory tree. This facilitates browsing them\ntogether and it&#39;s the simplest thing you can do. That way the threshold value for\nhaving too many classes in a single package is reached earlier - which is a\ngood thing in my opinion and forces me to rethink my package structure more\noften.\nI sometimes move to separate directory trees (as described above) when\napproaching deployment iff there&#39;s a requirement not to deploy the test classes.\n\nI&#39;m yet waiting for an Eclipse view which merges two directories with the\nsame package into a single package. *Maybe* I&#39;d then go with two directory\ntrees from the very beginning ... but probably not. \n\nJohannes\n\n-- \n+++ GMX - Mail, Messaging & more  http://www.gmx.net +++\n\nJetzt ein- oder umsteigen und USB-Speicheruhr als Pr�mie sichern!\n\n\n",
