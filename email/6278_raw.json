Continuing this further, I woud like to bring the question of development overheads involved.\n\n&gt; 1) What efforts have you guys taken in your respective organizations to reduce the programming overhead associated with writing unit tests? \n\nUse templates to generate testcases. Typing all that stuff in is a pita.\n\n\n&gt; 2) What are the tools you use for creation of unit tests, if any?\n\nOne of the main reasons I&#39;m loyal to JPad pro is the fact that it \nwill let me create as many class templates as needed (I have well \nover a dozen for Java alone), including the boilerplate for test \ncases (if anyone here uses JPad Pro and wants them, let me know).\n\nOther tools don&#39;t support this very well and I don&#39;t understand why- \nI&#39;m mainly thinking about Eclipse and IntelliJ, but often when I say \nthese IDEs don&#39;t do something, I get corrected ;).\n\nOne think I don&#39;t like about the way Junit does test suites, aside \nfrom the effort of remembering to add a test to a suite, is that it \ndrives the dependencies downward. AllTests at the top of the tree \nhas to know about all the tests or testsuites below it. This seems \nto introduce cycles in Java packages and while it&#39;s not the end of \nthe world or anything, it seems broken as designed to introduce \ncycles even if the payoffs for having test are substantial. It&#39;s the \nmain reason I wrote a tree walker to capture and run tests; I&#39;d \ndefinitely like to hear some opinions as to why I&#39;m wrongheaded \nabout this.\n\n&gt; 3) Do you prefer using tools for unit tests creation?\n\nOnly for blowing out the test boilerplate. I prefer to run tests \nthrough bash or cmd - going through an IDE can be very slow.\n\n\n&gt; 4) We use JBuilder in our development efforst. What would you advise us to go for to reduce our development overheads associated with unit tests?\n\nAccess to a bash shell and an ide that will let you generate test \nclass boilerplate quickly, if JBuilder doesn&#39;t do that already.\n\n\n&gt; 5) What do you guys think of cactus?\n\nGood project, doesn&#39;t get enough attention. I&#39;m not sure why Jakarta \nis running all of Jelly/Maven/Cactus/Ant  (although it would be \ngreat to see CruiseControl/AntHill run within the Jakarta effort).\n\nBill de h�ra\n\n\n\n",
