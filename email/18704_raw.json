Gunderson &lt;jgunders@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; So I would have to manually check every\n&gt; passing test case to make sure that it was valid. Bummer.\n&gt;\n&gt; I would need be able to add something like:\n&gt;\n&gt; //** Test Point(0,0), Point(3,4), 5.0 **//\n&gt;\n&gt; as a guide to the test generator as to what was expected. Then, in\n&gt; addition to all the other valuable verification tests of corner cases,\n&gt; etc.; it could generate the validation test.\n\nI find myself often tempted to do something like this.  But then, I\nwonder if this is much better than\n\n@Test public void pythagoreanDistance() {\n  assertEquals(5.0, new Point(0.0).distanceTo(new Point 3,4));\n}\n\nAs I see it, the advantages of generation from comments, as you&#39;re\nproposing are:\nG1) The validation code sits close to the implementation code, making\nit easier to look at both and reason about them\nG2) Specific behavior examples can sit next to general statements\nabout correct behavior, with the same syntax\nG3) A custom domain-specific language can reduce typing.\n\nThe advantages of the JUnit approach are:\nJ1) Java is actually usually a pretty good language for describing the\nbehavior of Java programs (this is not entirely tongue-in-cheek.  For\nexample, bash is a rather poor language with which to describe the\nbehavior of shell scripts)\nJ2) When it&#39;s hard to write Java to validate my implementation code,\nsometimes that means my code has a bad design.\nJ3) Not having to learn a custom domain-specific language reduces cognitive load\n\nI currently believe that it&#39;s easier to improve tooling around a\nJUnit-like framework to get the advantages of code generation than\nvice-versa.  I think that G1, looking at tests and implementation\nsimultaneously, is something that IDE&#39;s can still improve upon\ntremendously when using JUnit.  Ideally, when a test failed, I would\nautomatically be able to see the failure log, the test, and the\nimplementation code in side-by-side windows.  My Theories work is\ndesigned to bring the G2 advantages to people using JUnit, allowing\ngeneral statements to be written and evaluated in a JUnit style.  As\nto G3, I&#39;ve yet to see a domain-specific language (DSL) for tests that\nreally excites me*, but I believe that someday I might.\n\nNone of this touches on the idea of generating characterization tests,\nas with junitfactory.  What I&#39;m getting at is the best way for a\ndeveloper to write down what the implementation code should do, to get\nautomated support for verifying that it does.\n\nThanks,\n\n   David Saff\n\n* (esoteric side comment) especially since I&#39;m a firm believer that\nevery external DSL maintained long enough eventually becomes a poorly\nimplemented general-purpose OO language.
