Besides, the original\nposter was not necessarily talking about unit testing.\n\nTime and again, I&#39;ve had the need to create tests that depend on each\nother.  It&#39;s not very common (most of my tests are isolated), but when\nyou encounter this problem, you really need a way to specify that\ncertain tests depend on each other, for two reasons:\n\n- You are testing logic that has dependencies itself, so it should\ncome as no surprise that the tests that exercise it need dependencies\nas well.\n\n- More accurate reporting.  In the case where a test that failed\ncauses dozens of others to fail as well, would you rather read &quot;1\nSUCCESS, 19 FAILURES&quot; or &quot;1 SUCCESS, 1 FAILURE, 18 SKIPS&quot;?\n\nThe latter error message singles out the test that really failed and\nalso tells you that for now, you can ignore the other 18 tests that\nwere skipped because they didn&#39;t really fail:  they simply didn&#39;t run.\n\nThe fact that JUnit doesn&#39;t support dependent testing was one of the\nreasons why I created TestNG in the first place, and David, I still\nhave some hope that at some point, JUnit is going to go beyond its\n&quot;unit testing&quot; scope and start addressing other forms of testing as\nwell :-)\n\n-- \nCedric\nhttp://testng.org\n\n",
