However,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the outcome surprise me. Assertion success but\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; obj1.equals(obj2) return false.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What&#39;s going on insid=\r\ne assertEquals() operation? Is this\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; what it&#39;s suppose to be?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; As I stated, albeit not very clearly the first time (Curse you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&quot;Rich Text Editor(Beta)&quot;!), I suspect that the culprit here is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that &quot;=\r\nAssert.assertEquals(Object, Object)&quot; is not being called\n&gt; &gt; &gt; at all. This=\r\n is borne out by the fact that a J2SE 1.4 compiler\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and a JavaSE 1.5 c=\r\nompiler treat the same call completely\n&gt; &gt; &gt; differently.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I *SU=\r\nSPECT* that the 1.5 compiler is unboxing the Double\n&gt; &gt; &gt; objects into prim=\r\nitive longs and that the method that is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; *ACTUALLY* called is &quot;Assert.=\r\nassertEquals(long,long)&quot;. This\n&gt; &gt; &gt; accounts for the behavior since the in=\r\nteger parts of your two\n&gt; &gt; &gt; numbers are the same. &quot;Assert.assertEquals(lo=\r\nng,long)&quot; yields\n&gt; &gt; &gt; successful after the Doubles are converted (truncate=\r\nd) to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; longs.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; That&#39;s almost certainly what is happening, an=\r\nd good deduction.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you very much!\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Now we ask the question,=\r\n what&#39;s the better answer? Defeat the  \n&gt; &gt; purpose of assertEquals(Object,=\r\nObject) or letting programmers  \n&gt; &gt; hoist themselves on their own petards?=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; JUnit could detect this situation, but if it did, I&#39;d prefer  \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; it to warn the programmer rather than fix the problem, because  \n&gt; &gt; I wa=\r\nnt to encourage programmers to improve their design:  \n&gt; &gt; either the test =\r\nshould compare the Double values with a  \n&gt; &gt; tolerance, or perhaps the pro=\r\nduction code ought not to use\n&gt; &gt; Doubles.\n&gt; \n&gt; Well if that is the best so=\r\nlution (and I must say that I like it\n&gt; better than the status quo) then th=\r\ne easiest way to do that would\n&gt; probably be to create a bogus &quot;Assert.asse=\r\nrtEquals(double,double)&quot; \nthat:\n&gt; \n&gt; A) is deprecated (Yes, I mean it. A ne=\r\nw method that is deprecated and\n&gt; with no intent ever to remove it). The ja=\r\nvadoc should point to the\n&gt; 3-double overload as the preferred alternative =\r\nand explain why.\n&gt; \n&gt; *AND*\n&gt; \n&gt; B) is implemented to unconditionally throw=\r\n\n&gt; &quot;UnsupportedOperationException&quot; (or similar unchecked standard\n&gt; excepti=\r\non) with a message that indicates that you should use the\n&gt; 3-double overlo=\r\nad instead.\nI&#39;m agree with this choice. Since it&#39;s not preferred to be used=\r\n with \nDouble so some Exception should be threw.\n&gt; \n&gt; -- Roger Glover\n&gt;    =\r\nObject Partners, Inc.\n&gt;\n------------------------------------\nNattapong Siri=\r\nlappanich\nEngineer, National Language Development - GCoC & TSC Thailand\nSof=\r\ntware Group, IBM Thailand Co., Ltd.\ne-mail: natta@...\n\n\n",
