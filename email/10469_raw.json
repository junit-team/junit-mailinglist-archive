Currently I am able to do this \nthru an embedded Tomcat server on the Linux box, and the test seems \nto work well. I need to have the test class located on both boxes, \nalthough it seems the test class on the Windows box is merely for \nreference and the code inside the test methods is only implemented \non the Linux side. What I&#39;d like to do is run different code on the \nWindows side, so that once the Linux side&#39;s code has been run the \nWindows&#39; side code can verify the results. Does anyone have any \nsuggestions?\n\nThanks,\nPaul \n\n\n\n",
