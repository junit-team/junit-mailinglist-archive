To answer your question about how many tests would break<br/>\n&gt; if the instance was shared I must confess, I have no idea, I assume<br/>\n&gt; too many considering that I spend 0 effort restoring state and I<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t want that extra possibility to consider when tests do break. On<br/>\n&gt; the other hand, If no fixture was ever setup in the constructor or,<br/>\n&gt; more commonly, when the field is declared I&#39;d have to admit that<br/>\n&gt; sharing an instance would probably not be an issue. Tools like PMD<br/>\n&gt; could find those situations by static analisys and a rule could be<br/>\n&gt; added to fail those tests in the build...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So there is a way to convert to shared instances that i would be<br/>\n&gt; comfortable with given some clear benefit of doing so, now what is the<br/>\n&gt; benefit?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The main advantage I have seen is that I no longer need to use static<br/>\nfields and boolean guards to maintain read-only (and sometimes,<br/>\nwritable) expensive state across method in invocations.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nCédric</div>",
