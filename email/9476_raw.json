But sometimes what you want is a soft assertion\n&gt;&gt;&gt;-- if the condition doesn&#39;t hold, let me know, but keep\n&gt;&gt;&gt;on going.  And JUnit doesn&#39;t support that approach.\n\n\n&gt;Jason Rogers wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;In unit tests you don&#39;t.  If that were the case I would\n&gt;&gt;never want to use the object because it isn&#39;t stable.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;In functional or integration tests, perhaps -- doubtful,\n&gt;&gt;but perhaps.  If you do need a &quot;soft assert&quot; just surround\n&gt;&gt;it with a try/catch on AssertionFailedError and keep going.\n\n--- &quot;J. B. Rainsberger&quot; &lt;jbrains@r...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;I will say &quot;no&quot;: not during testing, ever. During production,\n&gt;perhaps; but not during testing, ever. Make an assertion.\n&gt;\n&gt;Strong words, I know.\n\nI 99% agree that you should use a strong assertion.  However, I have \nfound a few rare cases which are an exception.\n\nYou still have &#39;System.out.print[ln]&#39; and &#39;System.err.print[ln]&#39;.  \nIf you want &quot;soft assertions&quot; that the person running the test has \nto check by hand, please feel free to use them.\n\nSome IDEs highlight &#39;System.err&#39; output in red, making it an &quot;eye \ncatcher.&quot;\n\nI have a few &quot;print&quot; statements in my tests:\n\n1. A library I&#39;m using aborts the JVM when it finds problems in its \nconfiguration file.  Its configuration changes regularly, and there \nare often problems.  So I print &quot;If the system aborts right after \nprinting this message, check the configuration file &#39;X&#39; for problems \nlike this...&quot;  The message has proven helpful.\n\n2. I have a few &quot;print&quot; statements for tracing.  Almost all of them \nare commented out, and probably most of them should be deleted.\n\n3. Some MockObjects print unexpected calls, almost to the point of \ncode generation, for the convenience of the developer.  Then they \ntake a default action that is right most of the time.  Really, these \nshould set a flag or counter that would trigger an ASSERT later on.\n\n4. Some MockObjects do &#39;System.err.println&#39; rather than throw an \nexception, because a library inflicted upon us by an architecture \nteam silently captures and ignores runtime errors, like \nAssertionError.  (It&#39;s bad code, and they shouldn&#39;t do this, but \nthey refuse to change it.)  Again, I should probably set a flag or \ncounter, and ASSERT in the JUnit test code after we return out \nthrough the library.\n\n5. I&#39;ve done &#39;System.err.println&#39;, from time to time, instead of an \nassert, because I didn&#39;t have the conditions completely worked out \nso that it would be right all the time.  This is typically a problem \nwhen we&#39;re checking and cleaning up bad code.\n\n\n\n",
