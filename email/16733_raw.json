Agitator looks like it can eliminate the need to write most JUnit\n&gt; tests (except true persistence testing).  The downside is that we\n&gt; would be left with only Agitator config files that contain our\n&gt; business logic assertions.  This seems like a big leap to take, given\n&gt; that if Agitar goes away, we have no JUnit.\n\n\n\nHi David\n\nI have been playing around with Agitator and also attended a presentation by\nJeff Frederick from Agitar about Developer testing.  Two things ... 1.\nAgitar have realised that they have pushed the product thing a bit too far;\nand 2. Agitator is not a replacement for JUnit and I have not seen anyone\nsuggest that.\n\nHave a look for a thread on the TDD group where I asked a similar question\nto you .. and Jeff responded.  They wrote up their experiences TDD their\nDashboard product using JUnit and Agitator.  It&#39;s titled the XPeriment (or\nsomething similar).\n\nJeff also had some slides on Agitation Driven Refactorings which looked\ninteresting.  Where I can see agiation adding value is in the example they\nfound where a method took a string.  It then tried to instantiate a class\nfrom that string.  Agitator looked at the method and went &quot;it takes a string\n... well let&#39;s try any string then&quot; ... and so identfied an area that could\ncause a bug.\n\nI have been trying to agitate the bowling game to see what refactorings it\ndrives me to do.\n\nAnyway bottom line, I think the product compliments JUnit and TDD ... I am\njust not sure on how much that is yet.\n\n\nCheers\nShane\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
