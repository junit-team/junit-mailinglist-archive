Maybe that&#39;s due to\nmy limited use of Java (a little over a year).  Can you cite a good reason\nto use these various access modifiers?  I guess I think in Smalltalk too\nmuch, where everything is &quot;public&quot; and the idea of private is only in\ncomment form.  I am not saying that package-protected is inherently bad, I\njust haven&#39;t seen a good deal of need for it.  I have used it in some\ndesigns, where I wanted subclasses to override member variables or member\nmethods, but in those cases the overriding is still tested through the\nparent class&#39;s public interface.\n\nExample:\n\npublic abstract class AbstractParentClass{\n\tprotected String name;\n\tprotected String description;\n\tprotected Schema schema;\n\n\tprotected AbstractParentClass(Schema aSchema){\n\t\tschema = aSchema;\n\t}\n\tpublic Information getInformation(){\n\t\treturn new Information(name, description);\n\t}\n\tprotected processSchema(){\n\t\t...\n\t}\n}\n\npublic class ConcreteClassA{\n\tprivate Schema schema;\n}\n\npublic class ConcreteClassB{\n}\n\t\n\n    &gt; -----Original Message-----\n    &gt; From: Scott Stirling [mailto:sstirling@...]\n    &gt; Sent: Monday, June 11, 2001 10:23 AM\n    &gt; To: &#39;junit@yahoogroups.com&#39;\n    &gt; Subject: RE: [junit] Best Practice for Tests ?\n    &gt; \n    &gt; \n    &gt; By your logic, it sounds as though one might as well do \n    &gt; away with the\n    &gt; protected keyword, as well as default package access \n    &gt; behavior.  That is, you\n    &gt; are saying that if class A&#39;s methods are accessible to \n    &gt; members of its\n    &gt; package and subclasses or only its package, then what the \n    &gt; programmer should\n    &gt; do is define the methods of class A as public.  You said \n    &gt; that &quot;if the client\n    &gt; has no business touching these parts, make them private.&quot; \n    &gt;  But we should say\n    &gt; that while a client can be an unknown, external process \n    &gt; or third party\n    &gt; library, a client can also be a class in the same package \n    &gt; of our own\n    &gt; library.  The existence of the various access modifiers \n    &gt; gives us finer\n    &gt; control than the binary choice of public/private.\n    &gt; \n    &gt; Scott Stirling\n    &gt; JRun QA\n    &gt; Macromedia\n    &gt; \n    &gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----\n    &gt; &gt; From: Jason Rogers [mailto:jason.rogers@...]\n    &gt; &gt; Sent: Monday, June 11, 2001 10:09 AM\n    &gt; &gt; To: &#39;junit@yahoogroups.com&#39;\n    &gt; &gt; Subject: RE: [junit] Best Practice for Tests ?\n    &gt; &gt; \n    &gt; &gt; \n    &gt; &gt; IMO...\n    &gt; &gt; \n    &gt; &gt;     &gt; It simply make testing easier, without changing the \n    &gt; &gt; protection of\n    &gt; &gt; existing code. \n    &gt; &gt;     &gt; We find it sometimes easy to test part of a flow \n    &gt; (which usually\n    &gt; &gt; resides in a separate method) rather than \n    &gt; &gt;     &gt; check the public interface function. \n    &gt; &gt; \n    &gt; &gt; Then shouldn&#39;t these be made part of the public interface and \n    &gt; &gt; allow the\n    &gt; &gt; client to interact with them?  If the client has no business \n    &gt; &gt; touching these\n    &gt; &gt; parts, make them private.\n    &gt; &gt; \n    &gt; &gt;     &gt; Also, I take the term &quot;public interface&quot; as relative. \n    &gt; &gt; If an object\n    &gt; &gt; exposes an interface (set of methods)\n    &gt; &gt;     &gt; to its peer objects within its package, I see no reason \n    &gt; &gt; not to test\n    &gt; &gt; it, even though those methods are\n    &gt; &gt;     &gt; package-protected. \n    &gt; &gt; \n    &gt; &gt; I guess I disagree here.  I am not convinced that \n    &gt; &gt; package-potected methods\n    &gt; &gt; are part of a public interface.  If they are used that way I \n    &gt; &gt; would question\n    &gt; &gt; whether some refactoring needed to take place.  But that&#39;s \n    &gt; &gt; just my opinion.\n    &gt; &gt; I don&#39;t want to seem like I am picking on your design decisions.\n    &gt; &gt; \n    &gt; &gt; -Jason\n    &gt; &gt; \n    &gt; &gt; \n    &gt; &gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n    &gt; &gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n    &gt; &gt;  \n    &gt; &gt; \n    &gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
