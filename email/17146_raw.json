If you want to make sure each test has the same setup/configuration before the test executes, put it in setUp. If, on the other hand, you want to make sure all tests in a test case use the same values, put it in the constructor.\n \nConstructor E.G.: I want to use a common DAO for all tests. Initialize it in the CTOR\n \nsetUp E.G.: I want to create a new instance of Foo for every test. I put it in setUp so a test can change it, I init it in setUp so one test does not affect the next one (I use this frequently)\n \nYou really need setUp. The constructor is a nice plus.\n \nYou can alternatively clean up using tearDown.\n \nI have a large set of examples at http://schuchert.wikispaces.com/Car+Rental+Example. The included zip file has 100 Unit Tests (more on that in another message). But if you have a look at VehicleComponentTest, you&#39;ll see the following:\n@Before\npublic void init() {\n   vehicle = generateVehicle();\n}\n \nEvery test in that class uses this vehicle variable. Sure I could put that same line in every test, but this is a simple example. Another more complex example: VehicleTypeComponentTest:\n@Before\npublic void setup() {\n   component = CarRentalBeanFactory.getBean(VehicleTypeComponent.class);\n   component.removeAll();\n   createAndInstallVehicleType(PRE_EXISTING_1, MAKE, MODEL, YEAR, ValidState.valid);\n   createAndInstallVehicleType(PRE_EXISTING_2, MAKE, MODEL, YEAR, ValidState.valid);\n   createAndInstallVehicleType(PRE_EXISTING_3, MAKE, MODEL, YEAR, ValidState.invalid);\n   createAndInstallVehicleType(PRE_EXISTING_4, MAKE, MODEL, YEAR, ValidState.valid);\n}\n \nI want to start with a fresh set of known values (four VehicleTypes in this case) before each test. Not every test uses all of these, but I have them as I write new tests. \n \nSince it is possible for a test to change one of these VehicleTypes, I reinstall them for each test so that tests run in isolation.\n \nBrett\n \nTutorials and Articles\n     http://schuchert.wikispaces.com/\n\n\n\n----- Original Message ----\nFrom: clgonsal &lt;clgonsal@...&gt;\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSent: Monday, July 17, 2006 6:08:15 PM\nSubject: [junit] setUp versus constructors\n\n\nI&#39;ve been using JUnit for a few years now, and one thing that&#39;s always\nbothered me is the &quot;setUp&quot; method.\n\nI always do my initialization in my constructor (if I&#39;m not just doing\nit at the field definition) as constructors allow me to initialize\nfinal fields. The semantics of using a constructor also seem far more\nobvious to me as everyone reading my code knows Java, while not\neveryone is a JUnit guru.\n\nThe additional complexity of having the (as far as I can tell)\nredundant setUp method seems counterproductive, so why does setUp exist?\n\n\n \n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n\n\n",
