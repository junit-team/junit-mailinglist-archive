One question, though:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Here&#39;s another example:<br/>\n&gt; The JUnit 3 test runners create all test cases before running, and<br/>\n&gt; keep references to them in memory after running.  Anything kept as field<br/>\n&gt; references in a test class will not be GC&#39;d until the test runner<br/>\n&gt; releases the test class reference (which is never).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Doesn&#39;t this qualify as a memory leak? Is this a known bug or working<br/>\nas designed? Mayby I didn&#39;t understand fully what you meant: when the<br/>\nTestRunner is done, isn&#39;t it GC&#39;ed by itself?</div>",
