The problerm is<br/>\n&gt; having to provide the interelationships between the various interfaces to<br/>\n&gt; allow the mock to function adequately. In the simple example below I needed<br/>\n&gt; to provide a mock IDfSession with enough extra code for it to produce mock<br/>\n&gt; IDfGroup and IDfUser objects that could then be resolved against each other<br/>\n&gt; in several variations by the business logic. It was a major effort just to<br/>\n&gt; get the mocks set up. IIRC the test code was significantly larger than the<br/>\n&gt; original class, let alone just the method I was testing.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What would have to be true for you to have avoided this extra work? What <br/>\nexample were you trying to check? I don&#39;t know Documentum well, but if <br/>\nyour business logic operates on User and Group objects, shouldn&#39;t you <br/>\njust invoke your business logic passing in User and Group objects? This <br/>\nwould remove the need to simulate the Session interface.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would need to know more to be sure, but I suspect there are <br/>\nsimplifications we can apply by looking at the tests a little <br/>\ndifferently. If you could share a test (or the essence of it) with us, <br/>\nwe might be able to help.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The fact that calls to Documentum super class methods are intermingled with<br/>\n&gt; business logic to a high degree and seperating them would complicate the<br/>\n&gt; class inordinately making it less maintainable is also annoying.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;ll take your word for it, but intermixing business logic with <br/>\nintegration logic has, in my experience, never been simpler (easier to <br/>\nmaintain) than separating them from each other.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Having said that I still haven&#39;t given up, I&#39;m just less confident than I<br/>\n&gt; was. I also reread the holy books regularly (&quot;Refactoring&quot;, &quot;Working<br/>\n&gt; Effectively With Legacy Code&quot;, &quot;JUnit Recipes&quot;, &quot;Design Patterns&quot; and<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Refactoring to Patterns&quot;) trying to get ideas :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>More eyes usually help....<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ.
