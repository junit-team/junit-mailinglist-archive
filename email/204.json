I am actually writing several hundred <br/>\n&gt; test cases for code written by someone else - working <br/>\n&gt; this way it makes much more sense to test a feature to <br/>\n&gt; death in a single test case rather than writing a separate <br/>\n&gt; test case for each aspect of a feature.  I have test cases <br/>\n&gt; that include 100 assertions with up to like 80 failures <br/>\n </span></blockquote>[...]<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat you are doing sounds like acceptance testing. Unit testing with JUnit<br/>\nis intended to QUICKLY show that all tests pass while you are refactoring,<br/>\nor that only one test fails when you are writing test-first code.<br/>\n<br/>\nAcceptance testing usually tests that the application satisfies the user&#39;s<br/>\nStories... failures are allowed (and expected) for un-implemented stories.<br/>\nKent Beck describes the results of Acceptance testing to be a number like<br/>\n&quot;89% of tests pass&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nas someone else has said:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I use JUnit for application-level acceptance testing of web applications<br/>\n&gt;(using HttpUnit - see http://httpunit.sourceforge.net) as well as just unit<br/>\n&gt;testing, and having something like this I would find extremely useful.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;For example, I could then do something like:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Page loginPage = getLoginPage();<br/>\n&gt;  check(loginPage.existenceOfFeature1());  // important, but not fatal<br/>\n&gt;  check(loginPage.existenceOfFeature2());  // important, but not fatal<br/>\n&gt;  assert(loginPage.existenceOfFeature3()); // fatal, cannot procede if<br/>\n </span></blockquote>fails<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can extend JUnit to define &quot;check&quot; to increment the number of passes or<br/>\nfailures without throwing the exception that &quot;assert&quot; throws.</div>",
