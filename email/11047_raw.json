Your approach breaks this model for no apparent gain. \n&gt;(Tell us why you prefer to do what you propose over just writing JUnit \n&gt;tests in the usual way.)\n\nNice catch J.B., I hadn&#39;t thought of that one. I&#39;ll add it to my mental checklist for this type of question. Perhaps Mike could add this to the FAQ.\n\nSome points I have considered were\n\n.To write test along with the main code logic\n\n.Testing (Some what Validation of Code) is perhaps the property of the Component we are coding for and therefor containd within.\n\n.Well why should i compile the code if it doesnot seems to be wroking So assuring it to work while it is build.\n\n\n\t\t\n---------------------------------\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
