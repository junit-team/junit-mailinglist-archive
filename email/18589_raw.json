With that in mind, I figured if i \n&gt; could help autogenerate some basic testing codes to get them off on \n&gt; a start, they could get the hang of it and probably improve on the \n&gt; tests generated later.\n &gt;\n&gt; Erm does that make sense?\n\nMhh, I&#39;m not sure how allowing &quot;them&quot; to *not* write the tests first \nwill help them come to value *writing* the tests first.\n\nIt is also my experience that the best way to learn TDD is to really \ntest and code in *very* tiny steps. Your proposed tool seems to \n*increase* the size of the first step (generating a whole bunch of \nassertions before writing the first production code), which seems to go \nagainst the flow of TDD and I&#39;d fear will in fact obscure the main \nbenefit of TDD - driving you to design your production code in mini steps.\n\nI can imagine that going all those mini steps can feel tedious at the \nbeginning (although I don&#39;t remember having felt that way). I&#39;m not sure \nthat taking a shortcut will help much with the learning, though. I&#39;d \nimagine that making those mini steps become *more fun* - perhaps by \nmaking kind of game out of it - could be more effective...\n\nJust my 0.02,\n\nIlja\n\n",
