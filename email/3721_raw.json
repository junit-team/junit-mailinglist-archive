The DB is now well enhenced &\n&gt; &gt; contains a flush on close so the deleted records a re definitively\nremoved,\n&gt; &gt; etc...\n&gt; &gt; Everything has been done in the almost purest JUnit style (must admit\nmany\n&gt; &gt; coding followed by testing, but there&#39;s none piping over my schoulder,\nso\n&gt; &gt; ;-) ).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;d like now to change the accessor of some methods from public to\n&gt; &gt; &quot;friendly&quot; or protected for some methods as they are not needed for the\n&gt; &gt; caller anymore.\n&gt; &gt; My question is twofold :\n&gt; &gt;     1�. What are the possibilities ?\n&gt; &gt;         Would simply moving the TestCase as inner\n&gt; &gt;         class suite the matter.\n&gt; &gt;     2�. Am I&#39;m better to make all the TestCases member\n&gt; &gt;         of the package of the class to test & make the accessor\n&gt; &gt;         protected ?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tx for advice,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thomas,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; p.s. :\n&gt; &gt; To read with a sens of humour\n&gt; &gt; I was wandering if some of the fossiles wagging around this web site\ncould\n&gt; &gt; lay down some of their best advices on testing private/protected methods\n&\n&gt; &gt; testing with inner classes.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/junit/message/3542\n\n\n\n\n",
