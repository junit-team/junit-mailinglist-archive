It&#39;s a reasonable substitute for communication and agreement in organizations where people don&#39;t like to talk to one another or organizations which a decision is reached that everyone ignores.\n\nOther than that, I haven&#39;t found a good spot for JTest that other tools don&#39;t already fill. That&#39;s my fault: I had the chance to try it out in the summer and I was too lazy to do it. If anyone from Parasoft is reading this, I apologize for not giving your tool the time it deserves.\n\nStill, based on what I&#39;ve seen, JTest supports a kind of testing I don&#39;t do.\n\nTake care.\n\nSo said Ilja Preuss on 4/4/2003 --------------------\n&gt; How does Jtest work? \n\nI think &quot;How well does JTest work&quot; would be a much more interesting\nquestion. And IMO it can only be answered by trying it.\n\nSo, please try it for a reasonable time (say, half a year) - and try\nJunit for a similiar amount of time. If you *then* report back here with\nyour experiences, you will probably find a very interested audience.\n\nUntil then, all your points are mere speculation - and not very\ninteresting ones, to actual practitioners.\n\nRegards, Ilja\n\nPS: Personally, I am not very inclined trying out Jtest - simply because\nI *like* working test-driven. YMMV.\n\n\nYahoo! Groups Sponsor\n\n\n\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\njunit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n\n\nYour use of Yahoo! Groups is subject to the Yahoo!
