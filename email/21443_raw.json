But I&#39;m not sure\n&gt; if I should use the DirectoryBuilder, or if I should manually maintain a\n&gt; class that launches my tests, or use annotations.\n&gt;\n&gt; It looks like there is a way to simply annotate the classes I want to run\n&gt; and then to be able to kick off various test suites. But the docs don&#39;t have\n&gt; many examples of this. And it seems like there are many ways to do the same\n&gt; thing.\n&gt;\n&gt; The cookbook just mentions using JUnitCore.runClasses(TestClass1.class,\n&gt; ...), but that doesn&#39;t seem very extendable.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m just looking for a simple best practice. I&#39;d like to not have to update\n&gt; a main() method each time I want to add a new test class. I&#39;d like to simply\n&gt; kick off one or another suite of test classes from my IDE in most cases and\n&gt; get a nicely printed result printed to the console.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks!\n&gt; David\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n\n-- \nWomen have complained until they got what men had, then they complained\nbecause it wasn&#39;t what they thought it was.\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
