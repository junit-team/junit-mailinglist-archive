She fires up eclipse,\n&gt; creates a new class, and codes a method.\n&gt; \n&gt; Just 1.\n&gt; \n&gt; Then she selects the Eclipse menu (Hypothetical)\n&gt; \n&gt; Test &gt; test\n&gt; \n&gt; and\n&gt; \n&gt; a src/main/test\n&gt; \n&gt; directory within her project is automatically created\n&gt; with tests that cover her method exhaustively (100%).\n&gt; \n&gt; So when I say 0 time for the developer, I mean 0 time\n&gt; coding the tests.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now she reviews the tests. Could be that she finds\n&gt; that her method needs some tweaking, to further\n&gt; contrain it&#39;s behaviour. Then she regenerates the\n&gt; tests.\n&gt; \n&gt; Etc.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now I think the question becomes:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Well, how do we know the test is tested\n&gt; 100%/Exhaustively?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; This is where the part about reading some of the other\n&gt; stuff I wrote earlier in previous posts comes in.\n&gt; I&#39;ll be glad to elaborate on those :-)\n\nI understand this better. It&#39;s a shame that such tools simply cannot \nexist beyond the very simplest methods. If it were so easy to do, it \nwould be done. I&#39;m no complexity/computational theory expert, but from \nwhat I understand, there is very little any program can reason about the \nbehavior of any other program, so the tool you describe above probably \ncan&#39;t be useful for any non-trivial system.\n\nAs for the question of whether the method is tested exhaustively, that \ndepends on how well the test-generating code is tested... and then it&#39;s \nturtles all the way down: an infinite regression. It simply pushes the \nproblem to the next programmer.\n-- \nJ. B.
