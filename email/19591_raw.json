I can&#39;t imagine having a\n&gt;  &gt; test suite that takes 10 hours to run.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m surprised you don&#39;t have a more active imagination! :-)\n&gt; \n&gt; On the project I&#39;m on, we now have so many JUnit-based tests that we\n&gt; have to schedule them to run on alternating nights on two different test\n&gt; servers. It takes about 14 hours to run through them all. But we&#39;re\n&gt; using JUnit as a foundation for an automated system testing framework,\n&gt; and I suspect your imagination is limited to JUnit being a unit test\n&gt; tool.\n\nThat last bit probably sounded more negative than you intended it to, so \nI won&#39;t take it negatively or personally.\n\nLikewise, I don&#39;t know how to say this without sounding like an ass, so \nplease bear with me: are /all/ those 14 hours worth of tests really that \nvaluable? More valuable than faster tests that would cover the same \narea? It just seems to me that, at 14 hours, I wouldn&#39;t be happy with \nthe speed with which I obtained feedback.\n\nOf course, I&#39;m not in your shoes, so I don&#39;t know the whole picture.\n\nTake care.\n-- \nJ.
