This class will be used by EJBs and uses \nsome of the resources offered by the Application Server, so it won&#39;t \nrun outside de App Server. I would like to know what the best \nstrategy would be. What I did was to create a tester EJB that runs \nall the tests for the class, and to write a TestCase that uses this \ntester EJB. This approach has two main problems. First, from the EJB \nI am not able to use some of the TestCase features, like the use of \nassert methods. Second, I am writing the test code twice, once in the \nEJB and then again in the TestCase.\n\n \n\nI would appreciate it if you can give some pointers.\n\n \n\nThanks in advance,\n\n \n\n\n\n\n",
