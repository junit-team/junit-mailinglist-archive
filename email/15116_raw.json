B. Rainsberger wrote:\n\n&gt;&gt; &gt;    Are you suggesting that groupping test classes per fixture will be\n&gt;&gt; &gt; the only supported option in JUnit4?\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;This has always been how JUnit is designed and intended to be used. That\n&gt;&gt;said, many testers and test suites (including myself and my suites, and\n&gt;&gt;apparently even some of JUnit&#39;s own suites) tend to gravitate toward one\n&gt;&gt;test class per tested class. This is a very common pattern, even if it&#39;s\n&gt;&gt;one JUnit wasn&#39;t meant to support and one that causes test suites to\n&gt;&gt;take longer to run than they otherwise would.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;This does make me wonder if maybe JUnit has been cutting the wrong way\n&gt;&gt;all these years. Perhaps it should be designed to organize tests by\n&gt;&gt;model class rather than fixture. This certainly seems a lot more natural\n&gt;&gt;to a lot of developers.\n&gt; \n&gt; When a class has common code in two methods, we usually Extract Method.\n&gt; \n&gt; When a class has sets of methods that operate on two different parts of \n&gt; the class&#39; internal state, we usually split the class in two.\n\n   This sounds like theological design discussion and this list \nprobably not the best place for this. In any case I&#39;d say that you can \ndo above, but it is not always necessary that you should do that all \nthe time.\n\n   For instance, if you look at typical facade pattern, it is quite \noften that it would change different parts of the internal state but \nwe still need to test it as a single entity. I am pretty sure that \nfacade is not only case for this.\n\n&gt; Why wouldn&#39;t we follow those rules with JUnit test case classes? The \n&gt; first rule extracts common setup code into setUp() and fixture objects. \n&gt; The second splits test case classes that have multiple fixtures into \n&gt; separate test case classes. This leads to test case classes organized \n&gt; around fixtures.\n&gt; \n&gt; As for one test case per model class, that&#39;s a natural place to start, \n&gt; because it&#39;s simple, but once that test case class becomes complex, \n&gt; refactor as usual.\n\n   That usually would lead to confusion and will require special tools \nto track down all the test cases for given class.\n\n&gt; To say that JUnit supports or doesn&#39;t support this way of organizing \n&gt; tests sounds odd to me. I don&#39;t organize my tests a certain way; I \n&gt; refactor the tests, and that&#39;s where they tend to end up.\n\n   By the way, I believe that such freely-organized test cases will be \naffected a lot when doing massive code refactorings and/or moving \nthings around classses. So, I&#39;d say it is always a tread off and has \nto be considered in a case by case base.\n\n   regards,\n   Eugene\n\n\n",
