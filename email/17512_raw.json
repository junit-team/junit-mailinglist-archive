That&#39;s like making your tech support user friendly by outsourcing \n&gt;it to trained professionasl in India rather than letting your clients \n&gt;talk directly to the developers. There&#39;s a ton of theory (i.e. \n&gt;rationalizations) to support doing that, and it&#39;s completely \n&gt;counterproductive in practice.\n&gt;\n&gt;Interfaces are very popular among the most theoretical programmers: i.e. \n&gt;exactly the sort of programmers who are likely to write books, read \n&gt;books about OO theory, and hang out on lists like this one. However in \n&gt;my experience concrete classes are much simpler and much preferred by \n&gt;the vast majority of pragmatic programmers just getting their jobs done.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nUnfortunately, programmers who want to unit test their code suffer.  API \ndesigners rarely think about testability of client code.  I see the \neffect nearly every week at client sites.\n\nMichael Feathers\nwww.objectmentor.com\n\n\n\n\n",
