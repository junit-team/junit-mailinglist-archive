B. Rainsberger&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jbr@...\">jbr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Hear, hear.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; The goal of Programmer Tests is to for the programmer to:<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; * have tangible evidence of progress<br/>\n&gt;&gt; * clarify the needs of the design<br/>\n&gt;&gt; * &quot;eat his own dog food&quot; by being forced to write client code before<br/>\n&gt;&gt; writing provider code<br/>\n&gt;&gt; * keep focus on small steps<br/>\n&gt;&gt; * avoid writing too much code in one flow<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; I don&#39;t see how a dedicated unit tester can make that happen for a<br/>\n&gt;&gt; programmer.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;That is all true - but I didn&#39;t say that a dedicated unit tester&#39;s<br/>\n </span></blockquote>purpose<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;was to replace TDD - what I said was that the dedicated unit tester<br/>\n </span></blockquote>helped<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;in getting more and better tests earlier. A dedicated unit tester also<br/>\n&gt;helps<br/>\n&gt;introduce the concept and value of unit and early testing to teams,<br/>\n&gt;management, companies and developers. This helps get your foot in the<br/>\n </span></blockquote>door.<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t realize that there was all this context around the issue, so I<br/>\napologize if my entry into the discussion was off base.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;You have to remember that there are a lot of companies out there that<br/>\n </span></blockquote>don&#39;t<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;practice XP or even halfway decent practices, &lt;snip /&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Oh, I know. I&#39;ve worked for them. I&#39;m in the XPAdoption group, trying<br/>\nto figure out how to change all that. I&#39;m convinced that the only thing<br/>\nto do is to start my own shop, but I don&#39;t have the business and<br/>\nmarketing knowledge to run it, nor do I have the funds to pay someone<br/>\nelse to run it on day one.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;snip /&gt;<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Early testing has a value all its own, whether it is accomplished by<br/>\n </span></blockquote>TDD,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;or<br/>\n&gt;dedicated unit testers or both. &lt;snip /&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No argument there. My concern is that everyone wants to test, but not<br/>\neveryone has the same goals. In this case, I think it&#39;s important to<br/>\nidentify each person&#39;s (role&#39;s?) goals, then partition the work in a<br/>\nway that there is sufficient overlap for crosschecking, but not so much<br/>\nthat we&#39;re all doing Solo Testing, but duplicating effort.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn that vein, I place more value on a dedicated tester (someone with<br/>\nTesting Skill) doing integration-or-bigger testing, and leave the<br/>\ntesting of individual units of work to the people building them.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe more tests, the merrier, but let&#39;s not all try to write the same<br/>\ntests.<br/>\n&lt;snip /&gt;<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; I feel appropriately inspired. Let me write the article, then I&#39;ll<br/>\n </span></blockquote>be<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; back. :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I don&#39;t see the need. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Others may see the need. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;As I said I don&#39;t see a conflict between TDD and<br/>\n&gt;independent unit testing. The two can coexist. The only danger I would<br/>\n </span></blockquote>see<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;with both coexisting is that the developer may adopt the attitude that<br/>\n&gt;since<br/>\n&gt;there is an independent unit tester, that there is no reason for<br/>\n </span></blockquote>him/her to<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;do TDD. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Perhaps that is the article that needs to be written.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;snip /&gt;<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;If I had developers that wrote poor tests because they felt the unit<br/>\n&gt;testers<br/>\n&gt;would catch the bugs anyway, I would probably approach the situation<br/>\n </span></blockquote>the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;same as if I had a developer who wrote poor code because testers would<br/>\n&gt;sooner or later find any bugs. If they couldn&#39;t be made to see the<br/>\n </span></blockquote>wisdom<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;of<br/>\n&gt;early testing and TDD, then I would probably replace them with someone<br/>\n </span></blockquote>who<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;did.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I might approach the situation by explaining that the tests in TDD are<br/>\nnot meant to test, but rather the guide the design. In that light,<br/>\nsurely outside testing looks like a good idea.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;snip /&gt;<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;The original question was not about TDD vs. independent unit testing,<br/>\n </span></blockquote>the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;original question was how do you justify either one to management and<br/>\n&gt;project teams.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is where my ignorance shines. I don&#39;t know how to convince anyone<br/>\nof anything, so I&#39;m content to let others try to do it.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;snip /&gt;<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Also, as I said, don&#39;t make the mistake of hubris in thinking that TDD<br/>\n </span></blockquote>is<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;going to find all the bugs and that an independent unit tester<br/>\n </span></blockquote>wouldn&#39;t<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;find<br/>\n&gt;at least some also - I dare say that an independent unit tester would<br/>\n&gt;probably find numerous bugs. Hire me and I will prove it to you. ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, of course TDD won&#39;t find all the bugs. TDD isn&#39;t about finding<br/>\nbugs.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJ. B.
