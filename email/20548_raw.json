The test runner provides one, fairly te=\r\nrse, view:\nthis test passed, or it failed on this assertion. This is\nby far=\r\n the most useful view. \n\nThe assertion\nlog provides a deeper view into the =\r\ntest run, by leveraging\ninformation about the test run that you&#39;ve already =\r\nbuilt into\nyour test cases. If you don&#39;t find that view useful, then\nyou wo=\r\nn&#39;t use it and no worries. There are many views in \nEclipse that I do not f=\r\nind useful, but there may come a day\nwhen I will.\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups=\r\n.com, C=C3=A9dric Beust =E2=99&quot; &lt;cbeust@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi J.B,\n&gt; \n&gt; I thin=\r\nk the original poster wants a log of all the assertions that\nare being\n&gt; ru=\r\nn.

Yes, many people have said they w=\r\nant\n&gt; to log assertions in tests because they want the warm fuzzy feedback\n=\r\n&gt; that their tests are running and assertion what they think they are\n&gt; ass=\r\nerting. Logging is just one, and in my opinion a bad, way to do\n&gt; this. I b=\r\nelieve it is much better to write simpler tests.\n&gt; &gt; 1) eliminating redunda=\r\nnt logging statements - Many logging statements\n&gt; &gt; in a JUnit test case si=\r\nmply output information that you&#39;ve already\n&gt; &gt; told JUnit about in your as=\r\nsertions. Developers often put these in as\n&gt; &gt; a &#39;sanity check&#39; to verify t=\r\nhat the test is doing what they expected.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; If your tests need such a s=\r\nanity check, then I believe they should be\n&gt; simpler.\n&gt; &gt; 2) improving asse=\r\nrtion messages - it&#39;s often the case that the\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; first time you see th=\r\ne message for an assertion will be when the\n&gt; &gt; assertion fails, which may =\r\nnot happen until you run a regression test\n&gt; &gt; many moons after you coded t=\r\nhe test. Unless you see the message\n&gt; &gt; displayed when you are developing t=\r\nhe test, you won&#39;t realize that the\n&gt; &gt; message - if you provided one - is =\r\nnot be very helpful. Better\n&gt; &gt; assertion messages also help to communicate=\r\n to a developer what the\n&gt; &gt; point of the assertion is both when it fails a=\r\nnd when reading the\n&gt; &gt; test.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; If you aren&#39;t going to think about the =\r\nfailure message when you write\n&gt; it, then don&#39;t write one.\n&gt; &gt; 3) see finer=\r\n-grain test results. Every assertion is a mini-test on its\n&gt; &gt; own, but JUn=\r\nit these mini-tests are invisible until they fail.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; Absolutely not. As=\r\nsertions are not mini-tests. A test is a test. If\n&gt; you have multiple unrel=\r\nated assertions in a test, then move them into\n&gt; their own tests. This lead=\r\ns to a number of benefits (more accurate\n&gt; test count metrics, more informa=\r\ntion when a test fails, easier to\n&gt; isolate the cause of a failure).\n&gt; &gt; 4)=\r\n by making logging easy, it can help to avoid the\n&gt; &gt; using-system-outs-ins=\r\ntead-of-asserts syndrome, where new junit test\n&gt; &gt; writers will write &quot;test=\r\n cases&quot; that actually just write a bunch of\n&gt; &gt; stuff to the console that t=\r\nhe test writer then eyeballs for expected\n&gt; &gt; results\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; Why would anyon=\r\ne use JUnit to spit things out to the console? If they\n&gt; want output on the=\r\n console, and they&#39;re not just using that as a way\n&gt; to learn to use JUnit,=\r\n then they shouldn&#39;t use JUnit.\n&gt; &gt; There are some problems with logging as=\r\nsertions that I have\n&gt; &gt; encountered:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 1) if iterating over a collec=\r\ntion and asserting each element, your log\n&gt; &gt; can be overwhelmed. Maybe it =\r\nwould be useful to have some way of\n&gt; &gt; hinting that a particular assertion=\r\n should not create notifications;\n&gt; &gt; maybe not.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; I don&#39;t even want to=\r\n think about how slowly tests will run, and how\n&gt; much time I would waste d=\r\neciding which tests should log what and when.\n&gt; It&#39;s much easier just to ad=\r\nd logging where I want it.\n&gt; &gt; Is there any appetite out there for adding a=\r\nssertion logging (or\n&gt; &gt; assertion notification) into the junit 4 framework=\r\n? I would be\n&gt; &gt; happy to do the work if I thought it would be accepted int=\r\no the\n&gt; &gt; main junit distribution. Or maybe this capability already exists\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; in some way in junit 4 that I am not aware of?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; Yes, there is such=\r\n an appetite, but I hope there is a bigger appetite\n&gt; not to include it.\n&gt; =\r\n----\n&gt; J.
