    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-175837585\">Dear Vietchau,<br/>\n <br/>\nWhen I first started writing automated tests, I would come in and see a<br/>\nstack of test failures on my chair from the nightly run. The first few times<br/>\nI get excited, but then I realized that that there were always one or two<br/>\nreal failures and that the remaining failures resulted from those. That&#39;s<br/>\nwhen I decided that test isolation was a valuable and important<br/>\nproperty--the success or failure of one test should not affect the success<br/>\nor failure of another. One concrete corollary of this principle is the JUnit<br/>\npolicy of creating and setting up a new instance for each test. <br/>\n <br/>\nI wrote a little JUnit-ish performance testing framework while I was writing<br/>\nImplementation Patterns. Since some of the operations I was measuring were<br/>\nvery short, I didn&#39;t want an object allocation in the inner loop of the<br/>\ntimer so I reused the instances. I found it difficult to return each<br/>\ninstance to exactly the same state after the timed operation as it was in<br/>\nbefore.<br/>\n <br/>\nSeparate instances don&#39;t guarantee test isolation. If you use global or<br/>\nexternal resources, they can carry state between tests. However, the<br/>\nseparate instances give you a better chance of writing isolated tests. This<br/>\nis a case where I am happy to spend some CPU cycles to simplify the<br/>\nprogramming tasks. If you are willing to do the work yourself to return the<br/>\nworld to its original state at the end of every test or you are willing to<br/>\ngive up test isolation, you can use one of the mechanisms for shared<br/>\nsetup--TestSetup in JUnit 3.8.x and @BeforeClass in JUnit 4.<br/>\n <br/>\nRegards,<br/>\n <br/>\nKent Beck<br/>\nThree Rivers Institute<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  _____  <br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>] On Behalf Of<br/>\nVietchau Nguyen<br/>\nSent: Thursday, December 21, 2006 8:10 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [junit] How JUnit runs test class<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDear all,<br/>\n<br/>\nI am new to JUnit and so my question may be obvious... Is there a way to<br/>\nrun all test methods in a test class by create only one instance of the<br/>\nclass in JUnit? That is, not creating a new instance of the class for<br/>\neach test? <br/>\n<br/>\nI use <br/>\n<br/>\norg.junit.runner.JUnitCore.run(myClass.class)<br/>\n<br/>\nin the main program<br/>\n<br/>\nand if myClass has 100 test methods, the program will create 100<br/>\ninstances of myClass.<br/>\n<br/>\nI find that wasteful of resource because each time it will have to do<br/>\nall the setup again.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\nVietchau<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
