It looks like the test failures were actually=\r\n\nhighlighting a threading problem in either your test or code, which\nyou we=\r\nre able to fix, so that&#39;s a happy outcome, and you may not need\nthe rest of=\r\n this message.\n\nLike Joakim, I have found that on some platforms (older ver=\r\nsions of\nWindows are foremost in my memory), it seems that deleting a file =\r\nfrom\nJava sometime simply doesn&#39;t, and sometimes does, but only after a\nsur=\r\nprising delay.   One possibility is to use the TemporaryFolder rule\nin JUni=\r\nt 4.7 and above.  This creates a new temporary folder for each\ntest, and de=\r\nletes it afterward.  Since each test automatically gets a\ndifferent folder,=\r\n you&#39;re protected against any filesystem oddities in\ndeletion.\n\nGood luck,\n=\r\n\n   David Saff\n\nOn Tue, Mar 29, 2011 at 5:22 PM, Nils Wilhelm &lt;murphy@plane=\r\nt-of-art.de&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hi there,\n&gt;\n&gt; i have written a simple backup tool and=\r\n 10 tests. They all have the same\n&gt; structure:\n&gt; 1. Create some test files =\r\nand directories in an directory called &quot;source&quot;\n&gt; 2. Start the backup proce=\r\nss (to backup the files/dirs in &quot;source&quot; to a\n&gt; directory called &quot;target&quot;)\n=\r\n&gt; 3. Check whether all files in &quot;source&quot; exist also in &quot;target&quot;\n&gt; 4. Remove=\r\n all files from the &quot;source&quot; and &quot;target&quot; directory so that the\n&gt; directori=\r\nes are empty for the next test.\n&gt;\n&gt; If i execute the whole test set ten tim=\r\nes, i have 6-7 successes and 3-4\n&gt; failures. The error messages say that fi=\r\nles in the target directory\n&gt; could not be created or deleted (in the last =\r\nstep of the tests, see\n&gt; above) if there is a failure. One possibility i co=\r\nuld think of is that\n&gt; the tests are not run sequentially, so they could ha=\r\nve influence at each\n&gt; other. But as far as i know JUnit runs all tests in =\r\nseparate threads and\n&gt; those sequentially. Is that correct? Does anybody ha=\r\nve any suggestions?\n&gt;\n&gt; I use eclipse helios, JUnit 4.8.1, Java 1.6 and Asp=\r\nectJ\n&gt;\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt;\n&gt; Nils\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
