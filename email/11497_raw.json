Should they be\nincluded in production code packages or separated out into their own\nJUnitTest package?\n\nAlso, any JUnit book recommendations?  I saw JUnit.org lists quite a\nfew.  The books are so expensive, so I&#39;m looking to just get one good\nbasic one for now.  This would include approaches to writing test\ncases and using things like mock objects.  I notice a new book is\ncoming out soon called JUnit Recipes?  Any advance word on that?  Note\nthat as of now, I&#39;m not using EJB, XML or any goodies like that.  I&#39;m\njust using the basic java.utils API, though some folks in our group\nare also using JMS.\n\nThanks!\n\nKen\n\n\n\n\n\n \nYahoo!
