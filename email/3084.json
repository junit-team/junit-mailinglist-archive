It took me a little while to figure it out, but what was<br/>\nhappening was a test method was throwing an exception because of some<br/>\ndatabase error.  The tearDown method attempted to cleanup after the test and<br/>\nit also threw a database exception.  All I got back was the exception that<br/>\noccurred in tearDown, not the exception that occurred in the test method.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was a real pain because I had to modify the production code to catch and<br/>\nprint the exception so I could uncover the actual problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy preferred solution would be to print both exceptions.  If I get an<br/>\nexception in testFoo and in tearDown, JUnit should print the following:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) testFoo(net.iss.FooTest) <br/>\njava.lang.Exception<br/>\n\tat ...<br/>\nException in tearDown:<br/>\njava.lang.Exception<br/>\n\tat ...<br/>\n<br/>\nI would be willing to put together a patch to do this.  Comments?<br/>\n<br/>\nMatt</div>",
