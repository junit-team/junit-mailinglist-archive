I have one unit \n&gt; testcase for each action.\n\nI would call these &quot;unit tests&quot; or &quot;developer tests&quot;.\n\n&gt; Now im sitting and doing some HTTP-Unit testing of the whole \n&gt; http server, trying to login, logoff, etc. I start the server \n&gt; and connect to it as a real HTTP client, to test the functionality.\n\nI would call these &quot;acceptance tests&quot; or &quot;customer tests&quot;.\n\n&gt; What is the &quot;right&quot; amount of testing, is it best to do the \n&gt; same test but on different levels in order to make sure that \n&gt; NO strange behaviour is discovered or should I just test the \n&gt; whole flow?\n\nI think it&#39;s all about choosing what &quot;level&quot; you want to be testing at\nany given moment in time.  Remember you need all these different types\nof tests to ensure that the application does what the customer wants\n(and that you are happy that it can provide these features).\n\nWhy are you now testing with HTTP-Unit?  Is it to see if the application\n(rather than individual class) is working as the customer wants?  The\nanswer to that question might indicate whether you are on the right\ntrack.\n\nHope this helps!\n\nAndy.\n\n--\nAndrew Beacock\nLammtara\n\n\n",
