Then later, if I find some extra time,<br/>\nI&#39;ll try to write a few unit tests that will allow me to converge toward<br/>\nproblems faster. Because that&#39;s all unit tests enable: faster pinpointing of<br/>\na problem. If 100% of your tests are functional, you will still find the<br/>\nproblem but it might take you a little longer. Not a big deal.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s unfortunate that unit tests have become such a high focus of attention<br/>\nlately (and another reason why TDD makes me uncomfortable). High emphasis on<br/>\nunit tests and on TDD is engineers trying to make their work easier. It&#39;s a<br/>\nlaudable goal, but it should never come at the expense of the person whom<br/>\nyou are working for: the customer.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the only tests that really matter to the customer are functional tests.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nCédric<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
