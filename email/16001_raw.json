B. Rainsberger\n&gt; Sent: Sunday, February 05, 2006 4:59 PM\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: Re: Pluggable Selector considered harmful? (Re: \n&gt; [junit] Re: Observations from a production use of JUnit4)\n&gt; \n&gt; Jason Rogers wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; My point was that instead of using string-based reflection, \n&gt; you have a\n&gt; &gt; collection of Adaptors that you can iterate over to get the same\n&gt; &gt; behavior.  How do you get the adaptors?  Use a Factory.\n&gt; \n&gt; I get it; I really do. I&#39;d like to frame my original question \n&gt; within the \n&gt; context of JUnit itself, and not just to bring this back \n&gt; on-topic.[1] A \n&gt; common way to extract test methods from JUnit (3.x) tests is to use a \n&gt; naming convention with reflection. Assume that we do not have \n&gt; access to \n&gt; metainformation such as annotations. How could we allow \n&gt; people to write \n&gt; tests without having to do the kind of double-entry I prefer \n&gt; not to do? \n&gt; In other words, I just want to write a test and JUnit knows \n&gt; it&#39;s a test, \n&gt; rather than having to tell it that. How can we do that without \n&gt; reflection? If there&#39;s a way, I want to know about it, because I&#39;d be \n&gt; missing something valuable!\n&gt; \n&gt; What I find strange in all this is that I demonstrated doing \n&gt; what JUnit \n&gt; does in another piece of code, and even people who use JUnit \n&gt; looked at \n&gt; me like I was high.[2] Why the double standard? Why does JUnit get to \n&gt; use this pattern and I don&#39;t. It&#39;s just weird, so I&#39;m looking for an \n&gt; explanation by asking the more general question, &quot;What&#39;s so bad about \n&gt; Pluggable Selector?&quot;\n&gt; ----\n&gt; [1] Personally I don&#39;t care whether it&#39;s off- or on-topic, but some \n&gt; readers might care.\n&gt; \n&gt; [2] Just say no.
