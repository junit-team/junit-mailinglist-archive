I mean, I have a framework that uses xml configuration\n&gt; and XPATH to make some assertion tests from our server, and I would\n&gt; like to run them using junit, as it would be easier to generate\n&gt; reports and so on. The problem is that the tests are dinamic and\n&gt; depend on an external configuration file. So if i do asserts inside a\n&gt; loop it would leave the method on the first fail/error, is there any\n&gt; way to store all the asserts and process them afterwards? what would\n&gt; you suggest?\n\nChapter 5 (I believe) of the book _JUnit Recipes_ (&quot;Working with test \ndata&quot;) would help you here. Scott Stirling wrote about this quite deeply.\n\nMy first choice is for each test to provide its own configuration data \nby creating a different Configuration object, instead of an XML \ndocument. This is like Spring framework, which allows configuration in \nXML and configuration in Java.\n\nWhen I can&#39;t do this easily, I create a test/data/configuration \ndirectory in my project with a different configuration file for each \ntest. You still need to point your code to the configuration file for \neach test, but at least all the test data is in one directory and you \ncan name each file to match the name of the test method.\n\nThe Parameterized Test Case is another choice, depending on how many \nassertions you need to make and how many different inputs there are. If \nyou have just one input (the configuration file path) and a few outputs \nto check, try it; but if the expected results are very different for \neach test, then I recommend simply writing the tests and extracting the \ncommon code into methods (usually setUp() in JUnit 3 or a @Before method \nin JUnit 4).\n\nGood luck.\n-- \nJ.
