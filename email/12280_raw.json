While I am able to \ncreate and execute simple test cases, what I am really looking to do is \nto test my classes in their real-world environment: packaged in jar files.\n\nI&#39;m unclear, however, how to do this. If I run an Ant build, and create \na jar file with all the classes in it (as I always do), how do I then \nrun the jUnit tests against the classes in this .jar?\n\nI suspect it has something to do with making adding a jUnit task to the \nAnt build file that contains a &quot;java -cp...&quot; style command pointing to \nthe files in the jar? Is this the right way to go? Does anyone have a \nsample build file that does this?\n\nThanks for any help. I look forward to improving my code using unit tests.\nM.\n\n\n\n\n",
