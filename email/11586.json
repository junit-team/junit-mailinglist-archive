In general, such generalizations are specious at best. <br/>\nThis is a specific instance. (That said, I&#39;m guilty of plenty of <br/>\npremature generalization.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  &gt; The problem is, I am /quite/ serious, having spent a<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; year writing about<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; it and all that. Say whatever you want about the<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; quality of the work,<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; whoever spends a year writing on a topic is almost<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; certainly serious<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; about it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This argument I accept :)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Excellent!
