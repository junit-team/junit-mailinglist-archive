It&#39;s qu=\r\nite useful for debugging purposes when some tests break on a specific node.=\r\n\n\nWe rely on some deprecated code in order to do that, like BlockJUnit4Clas=\r\nsRunner.withBefores. So we were wondering if we can reimplement it with rul=\r\nes. It seems that the only way would be to retrofit every base test class a=\r\nnd isolated test case class with the necessary rules. Is that correct? Or h=\r\nave some sort of global rules been implemented that apply for all tests?\n\nT=\r\nhanks a lo\nGiuliano\n\n\n",
