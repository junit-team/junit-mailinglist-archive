It emulates a dumb framebuffer<br/>\nusing virtual memory.  The primary use of this server was intended to be<br/>\nserver testing, but other novel uses for it have been found, including<br/>\ntesting clients against unusual depths and screen configurations, doing<br/>\nbatch processing with Xvfb as a background rendering engine, load<br/>\ntesting, as an aid to porting the X server to a new platform, and<br/>\nproviding an unobtrusive way to run applications that don&#39;t really need<br/>\nan X server but insist on having one anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope it helps!<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards, <br/>\nReda<br/>\n-- <br/>\nGCE/E/IT/M/SS !d---(+) s+:+(++:++) a-- C++ ULS++ P+?
