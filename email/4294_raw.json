What you will find is that if you follow the\ntest-first paradigm... Yes, the p-word... Your code will be much\nsimplier to test... =))\n\nHowever, since you are in a situation of having 200k lines of code, I\nwould start small...  Only add test cases to code as you need to.  In\notherwords, only create a test case when you need to refactor/change\nsomething.\n\nOtherwise, good luck...\n\n\t--Ryan\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: philipborlin@...\n[mailto:philipborlin@...] \nSent: Friday, March 08, 2002 11:31 AM\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: RE: [junit] Re: JUnit bug for XML testing?\n\n\n\nI for one wouldn&#39;t mind seeing a bit more beef in the manual or maybe\njust a second manual for &#39;advanced&#39; usage.  I am in charge of getting a\ntest framework written for an application with over 200K lines of code\nthat does not have a single test case yet.  Yikes!  It is very confusing\nabout how to start and how to set up an application level test suite\nthat will touch all the classes.  I would be willing to write about my\nexperiences once I figure it out, but that may be some time.\n\nAnother thing that would be helpful is some best practices on how to\nwrite code that will be easy to test.\n\n-Phil\n\n\n\n \n\n                    &quot;Ryan P\n\n                    Ripley&quot;               To:\n&lt;junit@yahoogroups.com&gt;              \n                    &lt;ryan.ripley@z        cc:\n\n                    immer.com&gt;            Subject:     RE: [junit] Re:\nJUnit bug for   \n                                          XML testing?\n\n                    03/07/2002\n\n                    02:53 PM\n\n                    Please respond\n\n                    to junit\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat kind of documentation would be required?  This is something that I\nwould be somewhat comfortable getting the ball rolling on.

I know, I know... if I don&#39;t like it I should do \n&gt; better... [...]\n\nBe critical -- we&#39;ll probably all agree with you. What kind of\ndocumentation is missing? I, for one, have written a Starter&#39;s Guide.\nMike Clark has a really good primer. Is this not the documentation you\nneed? Maybe someone with some experience could be convinced to share\nsome knowledge if there&#39;s an area of the framework, its usage or testing\npatterns that you need to know about.\n\nGo to the Articles section of http://www.junit.org -- it may help.\n\nJ.
