Lets call it MyTestCase.  It works great by\nitself.  It fakes some data that it will need, then runs through some tests to\nmake sure everything works right.  Great!\n\nNow what I want to do is instantiate MyTestCase from another TestCase and have\nit run through the tests.  The reason that I want to do this is because the\nother TestCase (lets call it AnotherTestCase is going to feed it the fake data\nthat I want.  So I also have made a constructor for loadign the fake data in\nMyTestCase.  I would have thought this would be simple.  This is the code that I\nwould think that I could put in a test method of AnotherTestCase and have it run\nthe tests of MyTestCase:\n\nTestCase ts = new MyTestCase(FakeData);\nts.run();\n\nBut when I execute AnotherTestCase, it executes these lines, but ts.run() does\nnot cause the tests in MyTestCase to run.  The Setup() of MyTestCase runs, but\nno tests.  What is run used for then, and how do I do what I am tryign to do?\nEven using the regular constructor I can&#39;t make this work.  If I set up a static\nsuite method in MyTestCase then I can run the tests, but not on the specific\nMyTestCase that I instantiated.  I want to run the tests for this specific\ninstance that I created.  The run() is after all an instance method.  I can&#39;t\nfind any information about how to do this.  I must be thinking about this wrong.\n Help would be greatly appreciated.\nThanks\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n\n\n",
