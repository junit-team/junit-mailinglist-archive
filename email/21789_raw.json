I have a class under test and to=\r\n test each of the methods of the class there are different test methods in =\r\nmy test class. Now testing all these methods requires different test data. =\r\nHere is where my question lies, is it possible to annotate the test method =\r\nto somehow say use these setup methods, or use this setup method. \n\nI can o=\r\nbviously include the data population code within my test method. But in my =\r\nsituation there can be two test methods that require the same setup and thi=\r\ns would then mean code duplication.\n\nRight now the only way I can think of =\r\nis to create these setup methods and call them individually from all my tes=\r\nt methods which require that setup. Is that the right way to go about this?=\r\n\n\nThanks\n\n\n",
