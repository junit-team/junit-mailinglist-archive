My question is one of usage in the development cycle - <br/>\nhow are people using the ant/junit combination in actual development, <br/>\nparticularly in a test first, XP -style of development where you tend to <br/>\nwork in a single package while making changes or adding new functionality <br/>\nand as a consequence want to run the tests for that package (or more often <br/>\na single TestCase) after the build. Are you adding a junit task to the <br/>\nbuild file for each TestCase (which could easily get out of hand), or <br/>\nperhaps for each package (and wearing the slower test time) or do you not <br/>\neven use ant/junit at this level, instead keeping a junit (ui or cli) <br/>\nwindow open and run the tests from there after a successful build ?<br/>\n<br/>\nTIA<br/>\n<br/>\nRobert</div>",
