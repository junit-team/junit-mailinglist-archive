This is a much\ndiscussed topic, and you should be able to find many differing\nopinions.  For a detailed argument /against/ checked exceptions in\njava, see Bruce Eckels article:\nhttp://www.mindview.net/Etc/Discussions/CheckedExceptions\n&lt;/warning&gt;\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Pico Geyer&quot; &lt;picog@s...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ...\n&gt; \n&gt; try{\n&gt; \tstatement1\n&gt; \tstatement2\n&gt; }\n&gt; catch(ExceptionType1 e1){\n&gt; \tSystem.err.println(&quot;The following exception occurred &quot; +\n&gt; e1.toString());\n&gt; }\n&gt;\n&gt; I know that this is not a very good way of handling exceptions...\nGlad you noticed :)!\n\n&gt; The most obvious solution would be to let the method throw all\n&gt; exceptions that are generated. \nFor argument&#39;s sake, lets explore that option...\n\nHere&#39;s a question: if you&#39;re not going to do anything about an\nexception, why bother catching it?  And logging doesn&#39;t count - it&#39;s\nmere hand-waving.  In fact, here&#39;s how i would rate the possible\nresponses to a typical exception:\n\n1. Catch it and do nothing - if you do this, i /will/ fire you!\n2. Catch it and log it - marginally better, but you&#39;re still fired.\n3. Catch it, log it and rethrow it - you can keep your job, but your\nlog file will be filled up with the same exception logged repeatedly.\n4. Catch it and rethrow it - better, but if so, why catch it in the\nfirst place?\n\n(note that the topmost layers of your code are exempt - they obviously\nhave to catch all exceptions and at least report them).\n\nIf the answer to item 4. is that you have to catch exceptions because\nthe compiler forces you to, then your problem is the over-use of\nchecked exceptions.\n\n&gt; The problem is that there are 5 or 6 different types of \n&gt; exceptions that this method can generate and \n&gt; this seems to make my code very messy.\n/Any/ piece of code can raise dozens of exceptions, but you don&#39;t have\nto respond to most of them because they&#39;re /unchecked/.  I am curious\nwhy throwing your 5/6 exception makes your code messy - is it because\nthey are checked?\n\nConsider what happens if you get in the habit of not using checked\nexceptions and wrapping any existing checked exceptions with a\nRuntimeException:\n\n    try {\n        new FileInputStream(new File(&quot;/tmp/temp.txt&quot;));\n    }\n    catch (FileNotFoundException e) {\n        throw new RuntimeException(e);\n    }\n\nNow the client code isn&#39;t /forced/ to write a catch block for the\nFileNotFoundException. If the client actually needs to respond to this\nparticular exception, use a specific extension of RuntimeException.\n\nWhat you&#39;ll often find, however, is that the majority of your code\nwon&#39;t actually care about exceptions, leaving them to propogate up to\nyour top-level controllers where they can be communicated to users in\nsome fashion.\n\nI admit i&#39;m presenting an over-simplified view of the problem;\nmoreover, this attitude towards exception-handling makes most sense\nwithin an environment supported by rigorous and automated unit\ntesting.  Such environments encourage a rather simple strategy for\ndealing with exceptions:\n* Fix the bug in your code that /caused/ the exception, instead of\nwriting more code to respond to bad code. *\n\nSorry if i&#39;ve gone off on a tangential rant: i don&#39;t really have\nenough evidence to assume you are suffering from over-use of checked\nexceptions.  In any case, i hope this is food for thought.\n\nCheers, lasitha.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
