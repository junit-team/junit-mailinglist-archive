I avoided taking that route before since\n&gt; &gt; &lt;junit&gt; and &lt;junitreport&gt; were such an improvement over what I had\n&gt; &gt; originally. However (I think) I have run up against a limitation of\n&gt; &gt; the &lt;junit&gt; task which makes me revisit this solution. The &lt;junit&gt;\n&gt; &gt; task isn&#39;t working for me because it won&#39;t allow you to control how\n&gt; &gt; much exception stack trace information is kept for each failure. I\n&gt; &gt; only want to see the first line or two (the only really useful info in\n&gt; &gt; the exception stack), but I want to limit the amount of exceptions\n&gt; &gt; that are reported because I appear to be running out of memory when I\n&gt; &gt; run a full test suite of over 80 tests. This never happened before I\n&gt; &gt; started using Ant/&lt;junit&gt;/&lt;junitreport&gt;, and my assumption is that the\n&gt; &gt; exception stacks for each failure are being kept in memory by the\n&gt; &gt; &lt;junit&gt; task, which is expecting to write all of the info to XML once\n&gt; &gt; the suite completes. Unfortunately after so many failures the\n&gt; &gt; exception stack info being held in memory is so much that the program\n&gt; &gt; crashes with an out-of-memory error. Is my assumption correct? Will\n&gt; &gt; the TestListener approach help me?\n&gt;\n&gt; Using your own TestListener won&#39;t solve the OutOfMemory problem,\n&gt; although it might delay the problem a bit further, unless, of course,\n&gt; you use the TestListener to write all that information out to disk\n&gt; first, then after running the tests, read that back from disk to process\n&gt; it.\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt; J.
