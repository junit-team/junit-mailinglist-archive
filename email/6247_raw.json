(a) make each an inner class of the\n&gt;   class being tested, (b) for every class &quot;Foo&quot; have a class called \n&gt;   &quot;TestFoo&quot; in the same package, or (c) have a separate (but parallel\n&gt;   hierarchy of classes... SOURCE/com/pkg/Foo.java is tested by \n&gt;   TEST/com/pkg/TestFoo.java.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\nI use Option C.  Option B works, too.  People who put curly braces on \nthe correct line use Option C.\n\n&gt;QUESTION 2:\n&gt;   How do I automatically build the suite of all tests?\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\nI recommend starting by creating the suites manually to get a feel for \ncomposable tests.  Then seek the power of Ant.\n\n&gt;QUESTION 3:\n&gt;   How do I &quot;turn on&quot; my mock objects when tests are running?\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\nWhen faced with testing a constellation of objects that can&#39;t easily be \n&quot;installed&quot; with a mock object directly, I try to find ways to do so. \nSometimes it turns out those objects can be composed in a different \norder like Russian dolls.  If that doesn&#39;t turn up anything, I&#39;ll resort \nto building a factory that plugs in implementations based on a dynamic \nproperty.  I can count the number of times I&#39;ve done that on one finger.\n\n&gt;I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll have more questions also, but this email is QUITE long\n&gt;enough as is. Thanks in advance for any feedback, suggestions, or\n&gt;pointers to other forums/FAQs for this kind of stuff.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\nAs you encounter specific issues not addressed in the FAQ, let us know. \nWe&#39;ll make it better.\n\nMike\n\n\nYahoo!
