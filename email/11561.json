It usually takes a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; noticeable time to run them all.<br/>\n&gt; Can you quantify this? GSBase, for example, runs tests at<br/>\n&gt; approximately<br/>\n&gt; 100/second, and that&#39;s my usual performance goal for tests. On<br/>\n&gt; my most<br/>\n&gt; recent project, I separated tests that required expensive,<br/>\n&gt; external<br/>\n&gt; resources (there were about 10) from tests than ran entirely in<br/>\n&gt; memory<br/>\n&gt; (there were about 400). The in-memory tests ran in about 6<br/>\n&gt; seconds.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I will add that on my last project we had 2000+ /unit/ tests that ran in<br/>\n20 - 30 seconds.  Our functional tests (over 30) at one point were<br/>\nrunning in 17 minutes.  With 1.5 days of refactoring the functional<br/>\ntests they ran in 3 - 5 minutes.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are keeping count that is 2030+ tests within 5 minutes, an<br/>\naverage of 406 tests per minute (but let&#39;s not forget that the unit<br/>\ntests ran about 4000 - 6060 per minute).  Those are not shabby numbers,<br/>\nbut they aren&#39;t the best either.  There was definite room for<br/>\nimprovement, but we found that the ROI was not high enough to bring them<br/>\ndown anymore.</div>",
