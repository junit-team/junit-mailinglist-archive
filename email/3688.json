    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1082746763\">Looks interesting, although I have a word of warning for you: I worked <br/>\nwith the Blaze rules engine for three years. It tried to essentially <br/>\ncreate an English-like Java/business rules hybrid. It never reached the <br/>\npoint where nontechnical people could easily use it to do anything <br/>\nuseful, and that was its overriding goal. I suspect your goal is <br/>\nsimilar. It is a difficult goal to reach, so I suggest either throwing <br/>\nyourself into making ESL very easy for nontechnical people to use, or <br/>\ndon&#39;t bother trying. If you create something somewhat in the middle, <br/>\nyou&#39;ll just anger both sides. (I have plenty of personal experience on <br/>\nthis one.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, please don&#39;t name interfaces with &quot;IF&quot; at the end. A good OO <br/>\ndesign doesn&#39;t distinguish among kinds of types: concrete classes, <br/>\nabstract classes and interfaces should all look the same. An interface <br/>\nis a role a class can play, so name it that way without extra <br/>\ndecoration. Let the Javadoc tell me it&#39;s an interface.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have tried something similar, and have found it difficult to do it in <br/>\na domain-neutral way. It always ended up looking like a clunky <br/>\nBASIC/Java hybrid. Let me suggest that you pick a business domain to <br/>\ntarget and concentrate on that. You&#39;ll be more effective that way, even <br/>\nif you reach fewer people.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease don&#39;t think I&#39;m discouraging you. I&#39;m just trying to push you <br/>\ndown a brighter tunnel than the one you seem to be going down. :)<br/>\n<br/>\ndvydra2 wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; In the spirit of &quot;release early, release often&quot; I&#39;ve decided to post<br/>\n&gt; my work in progress.
