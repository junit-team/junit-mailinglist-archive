I ran into the same set of problems each time I tried. The\nDocumentum API is so complex and has so many interacting parts that\ngenerally I was not able to dedicate the time required to create anything\nmore than trivial tests that were probably not worth having in the\nDocumentum arena. I&#39;ve looked in passing at the various mocking libraries\nand they looked interesting but again required too many &quot;moving parts&quot; to be\nuseful for more than trivial tests.\n \nDocumentum itself doesn&#39;t provide a testing library so I started looking at\nbuilding a kind of test library to mock Documentum itself but bogged down in\nhow do you test the test code. \n \nType Based Objects bring their own hell as they extend and overide the\nexisting Documentum object features in complex ways.\n \nThe only technique I&#39;ve used successfully, and only to a limited extent, is\nto endevour to encapsulate the non-Documentum specific logic in seperately\ntestable classes as Strategies etc. In some cases I was able to isolate\nmethods and test just those specific methods. \n \nMichael Rutherfurd\n \n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of\nDavid Saff\nSent: Tuesday, 20 June 2006 10:14 PM\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: Re: [junit] unit test case for login()\n\n\n\nTejal,\n\nOne possibility is to think about things that could go wrong. For \nexample, I assume that docbaseSession is a field of your class. If the \nlast line didn&#39;t execute, and docbaseSession ended up not being \nassigned, how could you detect that from outside the object?\n\nDavid Saff\n\nTejal Khatri, Gurgaon wrote:\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt;\n&gt; I am new to junit and I have to unit test a few methods of \n&gt; a class. Out of those one of the methods is login method.\n&gt; I have undergone many examples in tutorials, but still have no\n&gt; idea about how to unit test following login method of my application.\n&gt;\n&gt; public void login(String username, String password, String docbase) throws\n&gt; Exception{\n&gt; \n&gt; try{\n&gt; \n&gt; moClientX = new DfClientX();\n&gt; IDfClient moClient = moClientX.getLocalClient();\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; DfLoginInfo loLoginInfo = new DfLoginInfo();\n&gt; loLoginInfo.setUser(username);\n&gt; loLoginInfo.setPassword(password);\n&gt;\n&gt; /*create a Session Manager object*/\n&gt; sessionManager = moClient.newSessionManager();\n&gt; sessionManager.setIdentity(docbase, loLoginInfo);\n&gt; sessionManager.authenticate(docbase);\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; docbaseSession = sessionManager.getSession(docbase);\n&gt;\n&gt; }catch(Exception e)\n&gt; {\n&gt; e.printStackTrace();\n&gt; throw new Exception(e.toString());\n&gt; }\n&gt; }\n&gt;\n&gt; Does anybody have any idea?\n&gt; Thanks in advance.\n&gt; Best Regards,\n&gt; Tejal\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
