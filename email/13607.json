I<br/>\n&gt; think that when a novice asks us a question, it&#39;s OK for us to<br/>\n&gt; provide a simple, dogmatic-sounding answer. This person is learning,<br/>\n&gt; and is therefore not well-informed about the consequences of the<br/>\n&gt; choices he has in front of him.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Also known as Shu or Level 1 audience: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ShuHaRi\">http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ShuHaRi</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ThreeLevelsOfAudience\">http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ThreeLevelsOfAudience</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; That said, perhaps we<br/>\n&gt; ought to ask more questions before giving answers....<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s certainly a heuristic I like. It&#39;s sometimes a little bit frustrating<br/>\nto apply though, because people typically  reply more positively to<br/>\nsolutions than to more questions. The solutions don&#39;t even have to be very<br/>\nadequate... &lt;sigh&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards, Ilja</div>",
