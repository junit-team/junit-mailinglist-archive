JUnit as a political gesture celebrates the ability of programmers<br/>\n&gt; to test their own software. The code and tests must be held to a<br/>\n&gt; higher standard, to demonstrate the techniques necessary to uphold<br/>\n&gt; our end of the bargain.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;d like to add two aspects:<br/>\n- JUnit should be the stable angle for the very unstable projects we all<br/>\nhave to do. Changing too much jeopardizes stableness.<br/>\n- When adding too much non-core functionality one quickly looses focus of<br/>\nthe core parts. Very often the extra functionality is not exactly what I<br/>\nneed in a specific situation, so I have to reimplement it anyway. If the<br/>\nunneeded and unwanted part of a tool is prevailing many will move towards<br/>\nstarting from scratch with a new (small) framework. That&#39;s why I&#39;d rather<br/>\nhave JUnit as a core with hooks to plug in additional behaviour which is<br/>\navailable in additional tools.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, is the move to version 4 as described in<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?JunitNextRelease\">http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?JunitNextRelease</a><br/>\nan &quot;official&quot; thing, i.e. promoted by Kent and Erich?<br/>\n<br/>\nJohannes</div>",
