To recap:<br/>\n<br/>\nThe filename matching system that David proposed was my first thought as<br/>\nwell and it could be implemented as an Ant task easily enough so that can be<br/>\nused to fail a build if a test case is missing, etc... I had started to<br/>\nwrite this utility when I decided to email the list and make sure I wasn&#39;t<br/>\nre-inventing the wheel. I think that this approach is a good first step but<br/>\nit doesn&#39;t give us a look into the code and it would be difficult to handle<br/>\ninterfaces (for which I rarely write a unit test).<br/>\n<br/>\nI looked at NoUnit but I cannot get it to run with Java 1.4 -- it looks<br/>\npromising though. Quilt is the most ambitious of the open source projects<br/>\nand it also looks to be very promising -- but is still pre-alpha and<br/>\nprobably not ready for use in a corporate setting.<br/>\n<br/>\nIntegration with Ant is, of-course, a big plus for any utility that can be<br/>\nused for this task. Looks like there&#39;s some definate room for improvement in<br/>\nthis area. Does anyone else have some suggestions?<br/>\n<br/>\nChris<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Vladimir Bossicard [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:vladimir@...\">vladimir@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, February 05, 2002 9:33 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [junit] checking for test coverage<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Does anyone know of any utilities that can check for test coverage.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You can have a look at Quilt: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://quilt.sourceforge.net\">http://quilt.sourceforge.net</a><br/>\n<br/>\nOff the record: it would be interesting to know what is the average <br/>\ncoverage of the Test First Design method: 80%, 90%, 95%, 100%?<br/>\n<br/>\n-Vladimir<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nVladimir Bossicard<br/>\nwww.bossicard.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!
