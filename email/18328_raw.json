In my curr=\r\nent situation, I\n&gt; &gt; want to write two tests:\n&gt; &gt; 1) is a standard operatio=\r\nn test where it loads a file and makes sure\n&gt; &gt; everything was sent properl=\r\ny to Oracle.\n&gt; &gt; 2) is a specialized test where it loads a file and checks =\r\nto see if\n&gt; &gt; the site code was capitalized in Oracle.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; So my questi=\r\non is this, should I use individual files for each test\n&gt; &gt; (i.e., one file=\r\n containing many lines of site data for the first test\n&gt; &gt; and then a seper=\r\nate file containing a single line with a lowercase\n&gt; &gt; site code) and load =\r\neach file at the start of each test, or should I\n&gt; &gt; combine the data from =\r\nboth into a single file and load that before all\n&gt; &gt; the tests are run (usi=\r\nng a @BeforeClass)?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thank you in advance.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Y=\r\nahoo!
