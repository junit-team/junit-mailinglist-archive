The servlet will compile the code (creating a .class file) and return some results (success or compiling errors).<br/>\nSo far so good. But I&#39;d also like to test that the user created an appropriate solution to the excercise, and I was thinking of doing so with JUnit.<br/>\nMy problem is I can&#39;t think of a way to do it (I&#39;ve never used JUnit before). Any ideas?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!!<br/>\n<br/>\nPatricia.</div>",
