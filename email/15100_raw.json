We do an accounting app\nthat tracks royalty=\r\n streams, the current market that we&#39;re working on\nis the music industry wh=\r\nere we track royalty income payments to\nartists from labels and other incom=\r\ne sources and then split the money\nwithin the band.  Abit like  hearding ca=\r\nts...  We&#39;re looking forward\nto other licensee-licensor markets (books, toy=\r\ns, IP, semiconductor,\nclothings, etc) and hoping that they&#39;ll be abit more =\r\nstraightfwd.\n\nWith that said we are trying to position ourselves to get the=\r\n SW\nmiddle/back end ready to license as an API, and if that ends up\nhappeni=\r\nng then I&#39;d see value in providing a test suite for the backend\nalong with =\r\nthe API binaries.  We&#39;d see doing this in order to allow\nother programmers =\r\nto view tests, experiment with params, see high and\nlow values, etc in orde=\r\nr to help them come up to speed on our API. \nProvides customer confidence t=\r\nhat API works as advertised  -- as well\nas providing us a known good line i=\r\nn the sand, so that if they\nmis-impement the API we can point them back to =\r\nthe tests as a means of\nestablishing a baseline level of API functionality.=\r\n  Helps keep us out\nof finger pointing situations with misunderstandings ab=\r\nout what\nfunctinality the API provides.  \n\nBut right now we&#39;re (read: me) t=\r\nrying to get a test suite together,\nrather get it setup as &quot;right&quot; as I can=\r\n and avoid refactoring later\n\nEnjoying the book, well written, working well=\r\n for me. Slow reading but\nthats probably more of a pilot error on this end.=\r\n..\n\nMike\n\nJoe wrote:\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;J. B.
