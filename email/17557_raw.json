Even without the arbitrary speed goal, there is a \ngood reason to avoid testing against the database.\n\nIt&#39;s just too easy when testing against the database to write more tests \nthan is necessary against the database. Rather than 20-30 such tests, \noften we end up with hundreds, and that&#39;s not just idiot practitioners \ndoing it. I&#39;ve seen otherwise intelligent, thoughtful people fall into \nthis trap. This is one of the reasons I advise against it.\n\n&gt; Nowadays, databases and networks are extremely fast, so don&#39;t optimize\n&gt; prematurely. Test the &quot;real code&quot; and wait until the tests start taking a\n&gt; long time before deciding on a course of action (and when such a thing\n&gt; happens, I will usually choose not to use mock objects and split my tests\n&gt; further into &quot;slow&quot; and &quot;fast&quot; groups).\n\nI agree with you in general (and I&#39;m pretty sure you knew that). I am \ntalking about years of experience doing this, and not weeks, so I \nstrongly doubt that I have optimized prematurely (and I&#39;m pretty sure \nyou haven&#39;t aimed that statement at me in particular).\n\n&gt; Like Elliotte, I like testing real objects, but I don&#39;t hesitate to use\n&gt; interfaces whenever it makes sense.\n\nI prefer testing with real objects, if they run entirely in memory and \nif they don&#39;t make my tests overly complex. Strangely enough, though, \nreal collaborators tend to make my tests overly complex. They introduce \nirrelevant details in my tests and make it difficult to pinpoint \nproblems. It&#39;s about test execution speed, but not exclusively so.\n-- \nJ. B.
