(Incidently, cactus has \nits own list which can be reached from jakarta-apache.)\nI haven&#39;t used JUnitEE, and don&#39;t really have enough experience with EJB to \nhelp you on that side.\n\n\n\nHTH,\nJim\n\n\n--\n\n                           *   Jim Cheesman   *\n             Trabajo: \njchees@... - (34)(91) 724 9200 x 2360\n         An oral contract isn&#39;t \nworth the paper it&#39;s written on.\n\n\n\n",
