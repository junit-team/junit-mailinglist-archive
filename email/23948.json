Also the data<br/>\nhandling(permutation of all the data set) by Theories is not something that<br/>\nassist in performing data driven testing.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll this and more resulted in I agreeing to David&#39;s suggestion of submitting an<br/>\ninitial extension to Theories Runnner that handles data in a consistent way and<br/>\nprovides users the ability to extend the framework.<br/>\nSo here is the link to the initial source code that supports new features for doing Data Driven Testing :<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/anujgandharv/junit-theories-ext\">https://github.com/anujgandharv/junit-theories-ext</a><br/>\n<br/>\nMajorly the support is in form of annotations.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is also a sample test in the repository that explores most of the new<br/>\nfeatures introduced.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am looking forward to your suggestions of how you feel about the extension and<br/>\nwhat can be improved so that it can be used by JUnit as an extension to Theories<br/>\nRunner.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers!<br/>\nAnuj Kumar</div>",
