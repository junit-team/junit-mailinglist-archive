And for all you\n&gt; know, all these potential users chose to use a different library than yours\n&gt; because they had more freedom there.\n\nPerhaps, but I don&#39;t think so. I not only pay pretty close attention to \nwhat users are asking me. I listen to what users are asking from my \ncompetition. (fringe benefit of open source and open development). \nUnless they&#39;re a lot of people working on their own XML frameworks in \ntheir basements, there&#39;s just not that much need for extending the \nframework beyond what I provide. Even in frameworks that allow a lot \nmore extensibility of this type (DOM comes to mind) people don&#39;t \nactually seem to take advantage of that possibility.\n\nInheritance is vastly overrated. The number of people who actually want \nto change a class&#39;s behavior is extremely small in most cases.\n\n\n&gt; And even if you could know this number for sure, just accept that other\n&gt; people have different experiences than you do (among which, most of the\n&gt; people who are participating in this thread, it seems).\n\n\nActually, I&#39;d turn that back on you. Different people have different \nexperiences and different needs, but these experiences and needs are not \nequal in numbers or importance. The programmers who hang out on mailing \nlists like this one (especially this one) are a very highly \nself-selected group. They are in many ways much more theoretically and \nabstractly inclined than 90% of working developers. Most programmers who \nwrite books about programming and who design and publish libraries are \nreally way beyond the typical working developer. Not a surprise: some \nprogrammers are experts in programming and some are experts in insurance \nor financial derivatives or shock wave modeling or something else. We \ncan&#39;t all be experts in everything. But these mailing lists attract the \nmeta-programmers: the programmers who are experts in programming.\n\nGuess what? We&#39;re weird, even among programmers. We are much more \ncomfortable with abstraction than even other typical programmers. Design \npatterns, factory methods, interfaces, inheritance, polymorphism, and \nanything beyond simple data encapsulation is way beyond the comfort \nlevel of most actual programmers. A library designed for ease of use by \na typical programmer needs to focus on the 90% rather than the 10%. If \nyou gauge the audience for a tool by the programmers who hang out in \nforums like this one, you&#39;re going to miss the vast body of programmers \nwho don&#39;t.\n\nWhat you are in effect arguing is that you don&#39;t want to be held back by \nthe needs of the many. You can safely use extra extension points, and \ntherefore they should be there. But most programmers don&#39;t feel this \nway. Most of them can at least safely ignore the extra methods. They \nprobably won&#39;t shoot themselves in the foot even if we give them plenty \nof bullets. However the sheer complexity of adding all these extra \nextension points make the classes so much harder to use that the cost to \nthe many outweighs the benefits to the few.\n\nSometimes we do need subclassing and extra extension points, but not \nthat many and not that often; even when considering only the most \nabstractly inclined of programmers. Extension points are not without \ncost. There&#39;s is or should be a significant hurdle to be jumped before \nadding a new published method. Even if the method is inherently useful \nand has no corresponding problems, it still needs to be useful enough. \nIt&#39;s not enough that one or a few people might use a method. It needs to \nbe pretty clear that large percentage of a library&#39;s users are going to \ntake advantage of the feature, or that it be extremely important to a \nsmaller but still sizeable percentage.\n\nWe can argue about exactly where to put the line: how useful to how many \npeople does a method need to be before we add it. However that number is \nquite a bit higher then 1. It is certainly higher than 0. That a feature \nmight someday be used by someone, but we aren&#39;t quite sure who or when, \nis not sufficient grounds to include it. There needs to be a positive \ndecision that a feature will be useful before it&#39;s added. Featuritis is \nas damaging to APIs as it is to applications.\n\n\n-- \n﻿Elliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nXML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim\n\n",
