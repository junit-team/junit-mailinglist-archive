If I had to unit test<br/>\nsomething like the controler, I would rather write own mock implementations<br/>\nof greeter and sender to test the controler: By doing so I will have no<br/>\ntesting code in my production code. Does that seem too much of an overhead,<br/>\nor for what other reason is Eric Allen&#39;s approach more promising?<br/>\n<br/>\nToyin<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Jason Rogers&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jason.rogers@...\">jason.rogers@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, June 19, 2001 3:20 PM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [junit] Does this have a bad smell<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;     &gt;     I am a regular reader of Eric Allen&#39;s series at IBM<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; devoloperWorks.<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; In his newest article<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-diag\">http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-diag</a><br/>\n&gt;     &gt; 0612.html) he<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; intermingles test code with production code. In my<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; opinion, this has a bad<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; smell, but ... well, I am interested of your opinion as I<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; am not to sure if<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; I am right.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Actually, I thought it was a *neat* idea, if needed.  He points out to<br/>\n&gt; places where the need for this might be apparent, you decide on the need.<br/>\n&gt; Recorder is just a special case of a listener.  You don&#39;t have to<br/>\nimplement<br/>\n&gt; it the way Eric did, I think his implementation is a case of DTSTTCPW for<br/>\n&gt; his article.  More than likely, if you wanted some kind of Recorder like<br/>\n&gt; this you would have an update method on the observed classes that would<br/>\n&gt; cause the observer(s) to update itself.  If you wanted to get specific<br/>\n&gt; information about the class that is updating (like the method name), you<br/>\n&gt; could use the second parameter of the update method from the Observer<br/>\n&gt; interface.  Or if you have need of that param for something else, use<br/>\ndouble<br/>\n&gt; dispatching to call back on the observable.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In short, it&#39;s a bad smell if you don&#39;t need it (either through his<br/>\n&gt; implementation or through your own).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -Jason<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
