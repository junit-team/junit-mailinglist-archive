IMO, if you use packages properly, then you should \n&gt; never need to construct a test suite. \n\nNo, not really.  I like having suite() because it allows me to trim out\ntests I don&#39;t need to run without having to delete the sources for them.\nI have a number of tests which, unfortunately, require manual intervention\nto click buttons on swing dialogs, and I leave these commented out in\nthe suite() method most of the time so that nightly automated tests run\nunattended.\n\nSuite() methods also allow me to control the runtime order without\nplaying games like manually rearranging source code or changing method\nnames so that a reflection-based runtime can be coerced into running the\ntests in the order I want them run.  Typically I order my test methods so that\nbasics get tested first, followed by more complex/esoteric stuff which\nhas to assume the earlier stuff works.  This lets me assume that the\nfirst test which failed is the first one to look at, rather than a bunch\nof other tests which failed as a side effect of the first problem.\n\nThere&#39;s nothing particularly wrong with your method.  It simply excludes\na level of control I happen to like using.\n\n-- \nJoi Ellis                    Software Engineer\nAravox Technologies          joi@..., gyles19@...\n\nNo matter what we think of Linux versus FreeBSD, etc., the one thing I\nreally like about Linux is that it has Microsoft worried.  Anything\nthat kicks a monopoly in the pants has got to be good for something.\n           - Chris Johnson\n\n\n",
