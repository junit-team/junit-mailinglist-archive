B. Rainsberger\n\n&gt; Agreed, TestNG supports this out of the box, but for=\r\n every \n&gt; neat feature TestNG supports out of the box there will be 20 \n&gt; p=\r\neople crying about this other neat feature it doesn&#39;t \n&gt; support... \n\nUh, t=\r\nhat&#39;s quite a bold statement.  I have certainly not heard anything like\nthi=\r\ns on our mailing-list... \n\n&gt; it&#39;s for that reason that JUnit doesn&#39;t even t=\r\nry. :)\n\nMy impression is that JUnit doesn&#39;t try simply because its authors =\r\ndidn&#39;t\nenvision that this feature would one day be needed.  Nothing wrong w=\r\nith\nthat, you can&#39;t always predict what the future will hold.\n \n&gt; One big d=\r\nifference between the two is that JUnit assumes that \n&gt; the test suite is c=\r\nomputed before the first test runs, and I \n&gt; admit that is a fundamental an=\r\nd useful difference between \n&gt; JUnit and TestNG. I suppose once TestNG has =\r\na large user base \n&gt; we&#39;ll have a clearer idea how important that is. (I kn=\r\now that \n&gt; day is approaching!)\n\nThanks for the vote of confidence :-)\n\n&gt; Y=\r\nou could say that marker annotations are &quot;merely&quot; syntax \n&gt; sugar replacing=\r\n marker interfaces. That said, syntax sugar \n&gt; done well is very nice. Also=\r\n, annotations were /designed/ for \n&gt; this kind of thing, and interfaces wer=\r\nen&#39;t. Interfaces are \n&gt; not metadata, even if they can be metadata. My butt=\r\ner knife \n&gt; can be a screwdriver, but that doesn&#39;t mean I should avoid \n&gt; b=\r\nuying a screwdriver.\n\nWell put.\n\n-- \nC=E9dric\nhttp://beust.com/weblog\n\n\n\n",
