I&#39;ve just grad=\r\nuated from Kaunas University of Technology (in Lithuania) where I have been=\r\n studying IT for four years. I&#39;ve been using Java for 3 years now.\n\nFirst o=\r\nf all I&#39;d like to thank You and all JUnit team for the great testing framew=\r\nork which I&#39;ve been using since version 4. What I especially like about the=\r\n version 4 is hamcrest and matchers. They make my tests more readable (and =\r\nfun) to write.\n\nHowever I&#39;ve found that JUnit does not have property matche=\r\nrs which would be very usefull in my opinion. While using FlexUnit 4 (Adobe=\r\n Flex and ActionScript 3 testing framework) I&#39;ve got used to these property=\r\n (or object) matchers and now think that similar matchers could be implemen=\r\nted and used in JUnit.\n\nHere is an example reasoning the necessity of this =\r\nfeature. Lets say we call &#39;sellItem()&#39; method on instance of class &#39;Store&#39;.=\r\n Then we need to check if properties (migh be set/get pairs or public insta=\r\nnce variables) like &#39;itemsInStock&#39;, &#39;currentStoreValue&#39; or &#39;itemsSold&#39; have=\r\n been updated. Currently we could accomplish this in several ways with JUni=\r\nt:\n\n1) Use assertion methods:\n    store.sellItem(item);\n    assertEquals( s=\r\ntore.getItemsInStock(), 10 );\n    assertEquals( store.getCurrentStoreValue(=\r\n), 720.5 );\n    ...\n\n2) With currently available matchers:\n    store.sellIt=\r\nem(item);\n    assertThat( store.getItemsInStock(), equalTo (10) );\n    asse=\r\nrtThat( store.getCurrentStoreValue(), equalTo (720.5) );\n    ...\n\n3) Creati=\r\nng another instance and comparing the two:\n    Store storeExpected =3D new =\r\nStore();\n    // Set values of properties or even add all items to the stock=\r\n\n    assertThat( store, equalTo (storeExpected) );\n    // or\n    assertEqua=\r\nls( store, storeExpected );\n\nThe last example is limited because we must ha=\r\nve &#39;equals()&#39; implemented  in correct way and this assertion will *always* =\r\ncheck same properties which, probably, means all of them. But what if wee n=\r\need only a subset? Of course this issue can be addressed by the first two e=\r\nxamples.\n\nHowever, things get complicated when we come to collections. The =\r\nsame class &#39;Store&#39; probably holds a list of all items. Its difficult to che=\r\nck if there is an item with some specific properties values:\n\n    StoreItem=\r\n item =3D new StoreItem();\n    // Initialize all properties (which might be=\r\n a lot)\n    assertThat( store.items, hasItem (item) );\n\nAgain, we need &#39;equ=\r\nals()&#39; to be implemented correctly and we can&#39;t easily match agains a subse=\r\nt of all properties. Needless to say, many lines of code are required when =\r\nwe want to use &#39;hasItems()&#39; to check even a few items in a collection.\n\nNow=\r\n here is how one would make similar assertions with FlexUnit 4:\n\n    store.=\r\nsellItem(item);\n    assertThat( store, hasProperties (\n        &quot;itemsInStoc=\r\nk&quot;: 10,\n        &quot;currentStoreValue&quot;: 720.5,\n        ...\n        &quot;items&quot;: ha=\r\nsItems (\n            hasProperties( &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Bread&quot;, &quot;price&quot;: 10 ),\n       =\r\n     hasProperties( &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Apple&quot;, &quot;price&quot;: 2 )\n        )\n    ));\n\n(You c=\r\nan find more information regarding FlexUnit and property (object) matchers =\r\nhere:\nhttp://docs.flexunit.org/index.php?title=3DMain_Page\nhttp://wiki.gith=\r\nub.com/drewbourne/hamcrest-as3/matchers-objects)\n\nI think this approach is =\r\nbetter in many ways compared with those described above. Of course due to l=\r\nimitations of Java same example would be more verbose. Still I think that i=\r\nmplementing these matchers for JUnit is worth a shot. And if Java 7 is rele=\r\nased we could be able to use new features (like language level support for =\r\ncollections) to simplify the syntax (not sure if this is a correct term).\n\n=\r\nFinally, I think implementing these matchers in Java is not very complicate=\r\nd. Having said that, I would be glad to do it myself. I think I have got en=\r\nough knowledge and experience to be able to accoplish the task.\n\nTo sum up =\r\nwith, I believe property matchers would be great addition to JUnit testing =\r\nframework. I&#39;m looking forward to hearing Your opinion about this proposal.=\r\n\n\nMykolas Mickus (Kaunas University of Technology graduate)\n\n\n",
