I *have* a seperate set of\n&gt; serialisation/deserialisation tests that have nothing to do with the tests I\n&gt; mentioned in my original post.\n\nThose aren&#39;t the ones I was worriked about.\n\n&gt;  &gt; Write some tests for using the object.\n&gt;  &gt; For the &quot;using the object&quot; tests, just create the objects in memory and\n&gt;  &gt; use them, rather than deseralizing them.\n&gt; \n&gt; I think this is what I am/was doing.  However (almost) all of these &quot;data\n&gt; type&quot; objects are only &quot;constructed&quot; through the deserialisation process -\n&gt; they don&#39;t have constructors with 20+ arguments (may be they should, or may\n&gt; be these data objects should be refactored into smaller classes...).  \n\nThere&#39;s your answer, but don&#39;t add constructors: add creation methods. A \nclass ought to have one constructor that takes all the data the object \nneeds. For multiple ways of creating an object, use creation methods \n(class-level methods).\n\n &gt; So\n&gt; when I come to use them during testing (because the method under test uses\n&gt; them) I have a decision to make - should I (1) fake; (2) use the\n&gt; deserialisation process to construct a &quot;real&quot; object; or (3) add a\n&gt; constructor that takes 20+ parameters and construct my in memory object that\n&gt; way.  \n\n#3, beyond question. If #3 is very slow, then consider extracting an \ninterface and doing #1. Do not do #2, since that is testing two things \nat once, and that will make you feel pain. (And here you are.)\n\n&lt;snip /&gt;\n&gt; So my original question rephrased was: I want to depend on as little as\n&gt; possible and when I do I&#39;d prefer, where practical, to depend on &quot;real&quot;\n&gt; objects rather than fakes, however as most of my data objects follow the\n&gt; &quot;deserialised construction idiom&quot; (I might just have made that term up) I\n&gt; was querying whether there might be a better way of achieving this.\n\nEspecially for bags of data, use the real thing wherever possible.\n-- \nJ.
