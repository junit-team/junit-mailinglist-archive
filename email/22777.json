(Don&#39;t populate<br/>\nthe _whole_ database.)<br/>\n- Which of the DBUnit population features are you using... I think there is<br/>\none that will revert to a known state, without the delete and insert.  This<br/>\nmay save some time.<br/>\n- Try to use a non-commitable transaction for testing.  After all, one<br/>\nshouldn&#39;t need to test the commit functionality.  If that breaks more than<br/>\njust you will have problems.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope I helped,<br/>\n<br/>\nBig Mike<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Wed, Jun 30, 2010 at 8:32 PM, hdave321321 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:hdave321321@...\">hdave321321@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My DAO integration tests are taking a long time to run.
