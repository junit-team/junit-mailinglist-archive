I was trying to find one (as I thought I\n&gt; had\n&gt; &gt; seen more than just a reference to a\n&gt; conversation).\n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s all personal e-mail. Let&#39;s see whether I can\n&gt; find it...\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;pause /&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t have it any more, it doesn&#39;t seem. I think I\n&gt; remember reading \n&gt; something at c2.com about public fields, especially\n&gt; as it related to \n&gt; Fit, and then I asked Ward about it, and I included\n&gt; his response in the \n&gt; book.\n\nThat fits with my memory of it also, but I could not\nlocate it.  Maybe he&#39;ll publish an article on it\nsomeday.  Thanks for looking.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; BTW, flicking through the book it looks good! \n&gt; Kind of\n&gt; &gt; like your mailing list postings ... only bigger\n&gt; ;-)\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks... I think. :)\n\nOh, it&#39;s all good!  I liked the sidebar on exploratory\ntesting which fitted a current discussion on the\nagile-testing group.\n\nCheers\nShane\n\n\n\n\nShane Mingins\n\nshanemingins@...\n\nplease remove clothes before emailing\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
