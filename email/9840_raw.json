So, sure, you can use JUnit for this sort of simple\nperformance testing, but you should at least run the tests enough times to\nbuild statistical confidence in the results.\n\nIt didn&#39;t show up in these few runs, but I believe that I have noticed\nbefore that the first test reported a much longer than normal time --\nseconds rather than milliseconds.  So the order in which tests are run\nmight introduce an effect large enough to render the results useless.\n\n--\nJim Dixon  jdd@...   tel +44 117 982 0786  mobile +44 797 373 7881\n\n\n",
