I just D/Led the V3.2 JUnit and I made a simple application\n&gt; &gt; under JBuilder 4.0 (which I&#39;m also trying to come up to speed on)\n&gt; &gt; that has a simple unit test case (shown below). I&#39;ve been looking\n&gt; &gt; at the cook book HTML pages, but I don&#39;t see how I hook this into\n&gt; &gt; the GUI TestRunner.\n&gt;\n&gt; If you run the GUI test runner (junit.ui.LoadingTestRunner, for example)\n&gt; with your test cases somewhere on the classpath, you can run them by typing\n&gt; the name of the test case into the edit box in the UI and hitting &quot;run&quot;.  If\n&gt; the test case has a static suite() method, it&#39;ll run that; otherwise, it\n&gt; will use reflection to find all of the &quot;public void testXXX&quot; methods in your\n&gt; class.\n\nI guess I&#39;m a bit dense, but I still can&#39;t get this to work. SOme of it is my\ninexperience with Java, jar files, and JBuilder.\n\nHere&#39;s what I&#39;ve tried...\n\nInside JBuilder4, I created the (previously posted) TestSummarizer class.\nUnder the project properties, I told JBuilder that the main class is\njunit.swingui.TestRunner. I built everything and tried to run under the\ndebugger with my test class (TestSummarizer), which has one test method\ncalled testDummy(), specified as the sole command line argument.\n\nThe program comes up, and tells me that the class (TestSummarizer) is\nnot found.\n\nNext, I used Jbuilder4&#39;s archive wizard and built a JAR file. From the\ncommand line, I typed &quot;java -jar TestSummarizer.jar&quot;. The program\nruns and when I enter &#39;TestSummarizer&quot; and press the &quot;Run&quot; button, it\ndoes not find the class either. I tried adding the full path to the directory\nwhere the TestSummarizer.class file lives to my CLASSPATH\nenvironment variable, but I get the same results.\n\nI&#39;ll try doing the same thing using one of the test classes from JUnit.\n\nAny suggestions as to what I&#39;m doing wrong? This sounds like it\nshould be easy...\n\n\nPCM\n\n\n\n",
