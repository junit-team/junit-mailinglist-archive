If you want to test<br/>\nthem using reflection, that&#39;s fine. In fact, that may make the most<br/>\nsense. But you did test them, because you found they could break. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; (Rational Rose has a bad habit of deleting method bodies when doing<br/>\n&gt; round-trip engineering.
