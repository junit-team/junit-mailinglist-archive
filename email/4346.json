You must carefully<br/>\n    create the unit tests performed by JUnit to ensure<br/>\n    that the tests rigorously check the code just as it<br/>\n    would run in the real world. In this article, we first<br/>\n    look at how to create unit tests and then at how to put<br/>\n    together test suites.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe I&#39;m being overly sensitive but it almost sounds like<br/>\n&quot;Here is a complicated thing that I&#39;m going to explain to you&quot;<br/>\nrather than &quot;Creating GOOD test cases is always tough. JUnit<br/>\nhelps by giving a framework where all you have to think about<br/>\nis what you want to test...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;/vent&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nRichard.</div>",
