There is no need to\nsay &quot;abstract&quot; twice in the class definition.  The class defines a concept (\ne.g. &quot;Thingy&quot;).  The class can be named after the concept only, because the\nJava language has a built-in feature for marking classes as abstract.\n\n--Nat\n\nOn 29/12/2007, jmdevins &lt;josh@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;   Normally I like to test my abstract classes separately from any\n&gt; concrete implementations I might have. I might have something like this:\n&gt;\n&gt; public abstract AbstractThingy {\n&gt; // some concrete methods in here that need testing\n&gt; ...\n&gt; }\n&gt;\n&gt; Based on this, I would name my test class: AbstractThingyTest\n&gt; (although it&#39;s not abstract itself).\n&gt;\n&gt; When I run JUnit in Eclipse, everything is fine and dandy. Running it\n&gt; from within Maven however seems to make this test not run. So I tried\n&gt; renaming the test to simply: ThingyTest. When I run this, it does in\n&gt; fact run.\n&gt;\n&gt; Anyone else encountered something similar? I suspect it&#39;s a bug and it\n&gt; should be looking for the keyword &quot;abstract&quot; instead of any file or\n&gt; class with the word &quot;Abstract&quot; in it.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thoughts?\n&gt;\n&gt; Josh\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
