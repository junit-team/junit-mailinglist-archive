I have been mocking for some 5 years now (in our group we\n&gt; originally called them crash test dummies).\n\nWe often use that phrase when describing them to students.\n\n&gt; I much prefer to query the mock object and assert whether the \n&gt; &#39;correct&#39; thing happened in the unit test.\n\nHmm.. not very object opriented.  Why not tell the mock what to\nexpect, and let it figure out if it happened?\n\nThen you have a specification of the interaction in your test... not\njust the postconditions.\n\nHow do you test for correct call sequencing?\n\nBoth approaches have their place.  To me it depends on whether I want\nto test interaction or results.\n\n&gt; We sell a dynamic mock object implementation that works for\n&gt; non-final classes and interfaces using byte code modification, that \n&gt; we call &#39;imposter&#39;.\n\nInteresting.  Why?  (i.e. why sell and why that approach)\n\n&gt; You can also download a GPL code coverage tool from us too.\n\nI&#39;ll have to look into it.  I&#39;ve been hooked on Clover for a while now.\n\nDave\n\n\n",
