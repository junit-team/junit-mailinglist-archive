Are you trying to test end to end? Are you <br/>\ntrying to test your integration with some part of the framework? Is this <br/>\na Learning Test?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat are you afraid is broken right now?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I was wondering if anyone with more experience than us is doing<br/>\n&gt; similar testing with Spring/Hibernate and how are the doing such<br/>\n&gt; testing?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I have no experience, but I have ideas. You said that you want to verify <br/>\nthat data makes it to the database. Who&#39;s responsible for making sure <br/>\nthe data gets into the database? (Your code? Hibernate? WebSphere?) If <br/>\nyou still need to/want to solve this problem, then I&#39;d like to start by <br/>\nestablishing who has which responsibilities.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
