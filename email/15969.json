How do you get the adaptors?  Use a Factory.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I get it; I really do. I&#39;d like to frame my original question within the <br/>\ncontext of JUnit itself, and not just to bring this back on-topic.[1] A <br/>\ncommon way to extract test methods from JUnit (3.x) tests is to use a <br/>\nnaming convention with reflection. Assume that we do not have access to <br/>\nmetainformation such as annotations. How could we allow people to write <br/>\ntests without having to do the kind of double-entry I prefer not to do? <br/>\nIn other words, I just want to write a test and JUnit knows it&#39;s a test, <br/>\nrather than having to tell it that. How can we do that without <br/>\nreflection? If there&#39;s a way, I want to know about it, because I&#39;d be <br/>\nmissing something valuable!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I find strange in all this is that I demonstrated doing what JUnit <br/>\ndoes in another piece of code, and even people who use JUnit looked at <br/>\nme like I was high.[2] Why the double standard? Why does JUnit get to <br/>\nuse this pattern and I don&#39;t. It&#39;s just weird, so I&#39;m looking for an <br/>\nexplanation by asking the more general question, &quot;What&#39;s so bad about <br/>\nPluggable Selector?&quot;<br/>\n----<br/>\n[1] Personally I don&#39;t care whether it&#39;s off- or on-topic, but some <br/>\nreaders might care.<br/>\n<br/>\n[2] Just say no. Stay in school. All that stuff.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
