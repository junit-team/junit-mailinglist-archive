My framework of interest currently \nis Eclipse.  I use test-driven development, and my current rule is that \nif I have to change a configuration file to get a system test to work, \nI&#39;ll write a unit test for that configuration file change.  I&#39;ve found \nthe resulting tests most useful for regression testing--the most common \nconfiguration bugs, in my experience so far, are not ignorant human \nchanges, but source control misuse or other mistakes that result in \nout-of-date configuration files.\n\n&gt; My concrete problem is that I want to test hibernate configuration.\n&gt; I have two ideas on how to do this:\n&gt;\n&gt; 1. Use dbunit, hsqldb to make some basic operations over my\n&gt; persistent classes. This way I&#39;m pretty sure they are correctly mapped.\n&gt; 2. I somehow manage to test the configuration files.\n\nI&#39;ve been using option #2.  Rather than write my own XML-parsing code, I \nfigured out how to drive the tests using the lowest 1.5 layers of \nEclipse&#39;s own configuration parsing code.   This has the strong \nadvantage that my tests see the configuration files the way Eclipse \ndoes.  If I tested closer to the actual XML, I would insulate myself \nfrom bugs in Eclipse, but I&#39;ve found a lot more bugs in recently-changed \nconfiguration files than in Eclipse&#39;s parsing code.  If I tested further \nback (closer to your option #1), I&#39;d be getting closer to integration \ntests, which would make it harder to figure out whether failures were \ndue to the configuration, or some aspect of the things being configured.\n\nThe big downside is the up-front cost of this approach.  It took the \nbetter part of a day to understand the Eclipse parsing code well enough \nto reuse it, and I had to resort to some evil-looking tricks, because \nthe parser has an astounding number of dependencies on the rest of \nEclipse that I had to stub out.  Once I&#39;d written two tests, though, the \nrest have come fast and furious.\n\nThe other downside is a bit of cognitive dissonance.  It feels like I \ncould get to the point where I was basically writing the same thing in \ntwo places, first in the test, then in the configuration file itself.  \nSo far, I don&#39;t feel that fear has born itself out, so I try to ignore it.\n\nShare and Enjoy,\n\n    David Saff\n\n",
