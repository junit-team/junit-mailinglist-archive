B. Rainsberger&quot; &lt;jbr@...&gt;\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; So said  Lauren Bish  on  2/21/2003 --------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; I agree with this 100% provided the word &quot;unit&quot; is removed. My fears:\n&gt;\n&gt; * The extra tests make refactoring more difficult, by testing the unit\n&gt; too deeply\n&gt; * I didn&#39;t write the extra tests, so I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ll understand them\n&gt; -- although if we pair, have coding standards and collective code\n&gt; ownership, then this is less of an issue\n&gt;\n&gt; When I worked at IBM, I had people in QA write bug reports whenever the\n&gt; internal implementation of my component changed, even if it did not\n&gt; affect the outward-facing behavior of the component. This happened at\n&gt; least once per month and annoyed the hell out of me. Why is QA trying\n&gt; to do my unit testing? My standard question to them: &quot;Does the system\n&gt; work?&quot; When they replied &quot;yes&quot;, my next question was, &quot;Then what the\n&gt; hell are you worried about?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; --&quot;You moved such-and-such file...&quot;\n&gt; --&quot;This XML entry changed...&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; To me, that&#39;s not what they should worry about. That just wastes\n&gt; everyone&#39;s time: their time for worrying about it and my time for\n&gt; dealing with the non-issue.\n&gt;\n&gt; That&#39;s why I don&#39;t like the idea of someone else doing my unit testing.\n&gt; Any other kind of testing is cool, but not my unit testing. When it\n&gt; comes to Programmer Tests, only programmers need apply. The rest should\n&gt; test some other way.\n\nWhat you describe was a management problem, not a problem with unit testing\ndone by someone other than the author of the code. I have seen such\noverzealousness from time to time to - it is one of the reasons why we had a\ntriage team made up of representatives of different disciplines. Such bug\nreports are the sign of an inexperienced tester and they need to be\neducated. If they are testing too deeply then someone needs to make them\naware of that. I always had people test the API first, and treat the units\nas black boxes, just at a unit level. Such an approach is a lot more\nproductive than trying to walk through the code and writing tests for the\nimplemenation - it is not the proper level of abstraction for the tests; the\nimplementation often changes, but the interface usually doesn&#39;t or shouldn&#39;t\n(once it becomes halfway stable) - if the interface is changing then you\nhave a real problem.\n\nAlso, as I stated in my posts several times, the independent unit testers\nwere indeed programmers, not QA or testing people - or at least not solely\njust testing people. They were trained and mentored by people like me who\nhave experience in both disciplines about how to test properly and how to\nwrite code properly. Some worked out, some did not, but all learned from it,\nincluding the people doing the training and mentoring.\n\nAgain, there were two factors involved that greatly improved unit testing;\nindependent eyes creating the tests, and a testing\nmentality/aptitude/attitude. I do believe there is a lot of value in\nindependent unit testing.\n\nFWIW,\nLauren\n\n=====\nLooking for an experienced Java/C++ Software Engineer?\nSee: http://developerdude.mystarband.net/resume.html\n\n\n",
