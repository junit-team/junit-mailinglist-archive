Then in another class  do rest of your test=\r\ns - in particular if you are concerned with the time to execute the tests -=\r\n place the login-code in a method of a class testing the rest of your appli=\r\ncation with a @BeforeClass annotation.\nThat way, there should be no depende=\r\nncy of the test outcomes on the sequence in which the tests are executed (a=\r\n good idea anyhow!). You may force ant (for convinience only!) to have the =\r\nlogin test done early to make the root cause of the failures more evident.\n=\r\n\nGreetings,\n  Georg\n\n\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Pigneri, Rocco&quot; &lt;rpig=\r\nneri@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Andy,\n&gt; \n&gt; I haven&#39;t used Ant in a number of year=\r\ns, but perhaps you could separate the login tests, main tests, and logout t=\r\nests into three separate Ant tasks.  You could then use Ant to force the or=\r\nder of execution and test the return value from your test runner to see if =\r\nany test cases failed and then act accordingly.  Since this is a web app, I=\r\n&#39;m assuming that it doesn&#39;t really matter which process makes the HTTP requ=\r\nest as long as it comes in with the same credentials.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hope that helps,=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Rocco\n&gt; \n&gt; From: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com]=\r\n On Behalf Of kokaku71\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, October 13, 2009 10:18 AM\n&gt; To: jun=\r\nit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: [junit] Specifying the order of tests and tes=\r\nt classes?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Hello,\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m looking for some advice on the best w=\r\nay to setup this test scenario...\n&gt; \n&gt; * Tests are run from Ant using a fil=\r\neset with wildcards (so that we don&#39;t have to manually maintain a list of t=\r\nests)\n&gt; \n&gt; * These tests are for a web application where there is a login s=\r\ncreen\n&gt; \n&gt; * We want to test the login screen with LoginTest.class, but the=\r\n tests in that class only need to run once. Once the test has logged in suc=\r\ncessfully, the other application tests will already be logged in.\n&gt; \n&gt; So, =\r\nwhat is the best way to force LoginTest to run before all other tests and t=\r\no force the order of LoginTest tests (because we want to test all the failu=\r\nre scenarios before finally testing the success scenario)?\n&gt; \n&gt; Is it possi=\r\nble to maintain the low-maintainance flexibility of the Ant fileset while s=\r\npecifying order? Is it possible to create a TestSuite dynamically that woul=\r\nd allow us to specify order?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message =\r\nhave been removed]\n&gt;\n\n\n\n",
