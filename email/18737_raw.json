For me this type of approach\nmeans having a domain specific language, like OCL,\nthat further constrains what is possible in Java,\ngiving the solution designer a more limited set of\ntools for expressing an idea, while at the same time\ngiving the designer an exhaustive set of tools within\na specific solution domain, like Data Mining for\ninstance.\n\nCheers,\n- Ole\n\n\n\n\n--- &quot;J.

I wanted to make sure I wasn&#39;t missing\n&gt; something important.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m relying on the method body and using it as the\n&gt; &gt; specification of what the programmer intended for\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; method to do. If what the programmers code\n&gt; produces\n&gt; &gt; is different from what their intention was then\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; tests are wrong as well.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; So the dataset produced for the tests will be\n&gt; wrong.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I think that&#39;s what you are saying, and it&#39;s a\n&gt; good\n&gt; &gt; point.\n&gt;\n \n&gt; -- \n&gt; J.
