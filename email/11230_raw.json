I see little value in this for many reasons. \n\nMocking the remote communication partner was often extremly useful for me.\nCan you give us some examples why it would be of little value for you.\n\n&gt; I \n&gt; want to test the real thing.\n\nWhat do you mean with &quot;the real thing&quot;? \n\nThe combination of your code + the real communication partner? \nThen look at J.B.s answer, this is \nexactly my experience and worked very well for me\n\nThe remote communication partner? I mainly want to test my code \n(and not the remote communication partner) \nas the protocol for me is usually defined by a third party\nand I &quot;just&quot; need to make sure that my code complains to to protocoll.\n\nBernd\n\n\n\n",
