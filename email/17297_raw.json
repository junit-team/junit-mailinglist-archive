I have b=\r\neen\nusing it for only one year now but in that short space of time you\nhave=\r\n all helped me not only to write better tests but to also be a\nbetter devel=\r\noper.\n\nNow to my problem :-) I searched for a solution to this but all in\nv=\r\nain. Essentially I want to execute a JUNIT test on a unix box\nremotely whil=\r\ne connecting to the JVM using eclipse on my windows\nmachine with the intent=\r\nion of debugging.\n\nHow do I launch my JUNIT with a debug option on the comm=\r\nand line? I\ndon&#39;t want to use ANT. The problem I have is that we develop on=\r\n\nwindows but the application is designed to run solely on some\ndifferent fl=\r\navours of unix (mostly HP-UX). \n\nAll our tests run automatically at night a=\r\nfter the daily build but\nsometimes the tests will fail on unix and pass on =\r\nwindows. Ideally,\nthe solution would be to develop and test on unix but thi=\r\ns is not\npermitted due certain limitations beyond my control.\n\nAny help wou=\r\nld be very much appreciated. \nregards,\nDavid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
