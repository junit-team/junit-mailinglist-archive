From a computer\n&gt;science perspective - issues like building and deployment are not a very hot\n&gt;topic - at any level.\n\nI agree.  I didn&#39;t think EJB was very hot either, being pretty far from the \ncutting edge of research and being squarely focused on business rather than \nscience.  That&#39;s why I asked what his university was &quot;local&quot; to -- it seems \nlike a fishy project for a comp sci grad student.\n\nI mean, it&#39;s not a quest to discover the unknown is it?  Everyone knows how to \ntest EJBs with JUnit, or at least knows where to find out.  Is this information \nunobtainable from inside our local universities?  Not at all.  So what kind of \ngraduate research project is it?\n\n&gt;Learning to jar takes about an hour .. learning it really well - half a day.\n&gt;Now learning about testing methodologies (such as unit testing and load\n&gt;testing) and other computer science concepts take much, much longer.\n\nI was just keying into the user&#39;s &quot;confession&quot; of the state of his ignorance.  \nHe writes in asking how to unit and load test EJBs with JUnit and adds almost \nin a p.s., by the way, I don&#39;t know how to create a jar file.  Hello!  This is \nwhere you must meet him if you want to go to his level and bring him up near \nyours.\n\n&gt;My point - just because you don&#39;t know  how to use a particular tool (and\n&gt;that&#39;s all jar is) does not mean that you are poorly suited for a research\n&gt;position (or even an employment one either).  It is more closely related to\n&gt;how well you conduct research in general - and how well you can search out\n&gt;answers to your questions in an academic manner.\n\nI guess the main tool to learn how to use well in research is your own brain.\n\nScott Stirling\n\n",
