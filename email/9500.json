These names do not go in the constant pool.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is, since the test doesn&#39;t measure I/O, there should be no effect<br/>\nat all.  But there is.  The long names ran consistently faster in the<br/>\nJava tests. Since the test runs in a continuous loop, this can&#39;t be the<br/>\nresult of any startup effect.<br/>\n<br/>\nFWIW I translated the Java into C++ and ran the same benchmark.  Oddly<br/>\nenough, the variable name length definitely has a pronounced effect<br/>\nin C++.  On a slow PC used as a test box, results looked like this:<br/>\n<br/>\n           Java    C++ -O1    C++ -O2<br/>\nshort      13.4s     3.2s       4.1s<br/>\nlong       12.0s     8.4s       7.2s<br/>\n<br/>\nmemory use 12.4 MB   0.8 MB     0.8 MB<br/>\n<br/>\nTurning up the optimization on the C++ code had the disturbing effect<br/>\nof slowing down the short-name tests while improving the long-name<br/>\nresults.  Further optimization produced no clear benefit.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe machine was running RedHat 8.0 Linux, gcc 3.x, Sun Java 1.4.1_02,<br/>\nand X.  It was otherwise idle.  It has a CPU clocked at 533 MHz.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you include startup times, C++&#39;s performance advantage over Java<br/>\nimproves.  However, it comes as a pleasant surprise that Java comes<br/>\nthis close to C++.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJim Dixon  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jdd@...\">jdd@...</a>   tel +44 117 982 0786  mobile +44 797 373 7881</div>",
