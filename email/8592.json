I was trying to narrow scope to work within the team on the project, though. I assume that the team effectively manages its members&#39; interaction with the rest of the organization or Customer. The last XP team I was on did this well, so that&#39;s the context I live in. In that case, we can pick #1, #2 and perhaps #5 off the list. (Maybe you consider XP to be the latest management fad... :)<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, on a team using Pair Programming, #4 becomes a positive.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat leaves #3, which is a big time-waster, indeed. The team needs to learn to resolve issues quickly, including, &quot;Let&#39;s just try it both ways and see what&#39;s better.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s amazing to me the number of items on your list that I don&#39;t worry about any more.... when they come up, I simply walk out the front door. That level of organizational dysfunction isn&#39;t worth my effort.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I wasn&#39;t looking for ammo, I just saw the statement and was wondering if<br/>\n&gt;it was more than &quot;red is the best car color.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, it certainly is, since that&#39;s an opinion, whereas my statement is based both on personal experience and anecdotal evidence from people in the Agile community. A formal study? No.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;When I asked I had assumed<br/>\n&gt;that if you had a link to a roundtable discussion or conference/white<br/>\n&gt;paper on the subject you would be willing to share.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Alistair Cockburn has done work on the time wasted in creating documentation for its own sake. Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas&#39; &quot;Pragmatic Programmer&quot; talks about it, too, but this last reference is just more opinion/experience/anecdotes.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;      Sure a study or white paper is just something that one guy did. But<br/>\n&gt;the minute you put it into the public arena like that you are inviting<br/>\n&gt;public/peer review and commentary. Thus, it reaches a far larger audience<br/>\n&gt;with a wider range of experience than just the gang you tip back with on<br/>\n&gt;occasion.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Agreed.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJ.
