Having done some reading<br/>\non the use of the Java &quot;assert&quot; statement, I was curious if anyone<br/>\nhere had a strong conviction about using or not using it with unit<br/>\ntesting.<br/>\n<br/>\nAssuming that I would only be using the assert statement in non-public<br/>\nmethods (public methods would throw a meaningful exception), shouldn&#39;t<br/>\nI be writing unit tests to basically assert the same post or pre<br/>\nconditions that the assert keyword could be used for?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy only argument for using them at this point would be to assert the<br/>\nvalidity of arguments to a method; non-null, etc...<br/>\n<br/>\nHas this been discussed ad nauseam elsewhere that I should just<br/>\nreview? &lt;grin&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your time,<br/>\nTim Kuntz</div>",
