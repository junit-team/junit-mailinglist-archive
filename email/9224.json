I&#39;d assume that I may need to create my<br/>\nown TestRunner to perform the &quot;execute tests against remote server&quot;<br/>\napproach.  I don&#39;t want to go down a rat hole on this as I think there<br/>\nis a chunk of basic Junit knowledge that I&#39;m missing out on as to how to<br/>\nbest set up this pattern.<br/>\n<br/>\nCan anyone lend a hand or point me at some examples of solutions that<br/>\nfix similar problems?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance,<br/>\n<br/>\nTom<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
