    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1966520966\">Thanks!  This is where a work around could work.  However, I have <br/>\nanother issue.  I&#39;ve never been very good with regular expressions, <br/>\nwhich seems to be the best way to either search and replace or search <br/>\nand add.  If I have a project class and I want to add a name, what <br/>\nwould I do?  Here&#39;s a vague example of what I&#39;m trying to do:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;testsuite ... name=&quot;[package name].class&quot; ...&gt; changed to:<br/>\n&lt;testsuite ... name=&quot;[package name].class.[test name]&quot; ...&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause the package name (or similarly class name) is the same for <br/>\nevery test, the test was overwritten.  However, each test I run has <br/>\nit&#39;s own name, which I could add at the end as described above.  The <br/>\nonly bad part is that the report then recognizes the &quot;[package <br/>\nname].class&quot; as the package, instead of just the package and the <br/>\ntest &quot;[test name]&quot; as the class instead of the actual class.  This is <br/>\nmore of an annoyance, however, not an actual problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone has any pointers on good ways to use reg ex or another <br/>\nmethod, I&#39;d appreciate it.  I hope to be able to do this for multiple <br/>\nfiles, so I&#39;m looking for a more script-like implementation.  I <br/>\nunderstand I could use &quot;sed&quot; in Unix, but again, I am not very good <br/>\nwith regular expressions.  Thanks!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;J. B.
