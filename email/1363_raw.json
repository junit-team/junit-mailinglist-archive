Parameters \n\nAs Mr Freeman shows, you use parameters to pass the Mock into the \nclass that calls it.\n\n2 Reflection\n\nIf B is referenced in a field of A, you can use reflection to modify \nA and replace B with it&#39;s Mock.\n\n3 Mole Pattern\n\nSubclass A, and use the subclass to setup the Mock.  [I call this \ndesign the &quot;Mole Pattern&quot;]\n\n4 Strategy Pattern\n\nUse a Strategy design pattern.\n\n5 Dynamic Proxy\n\nIf the B is an implementation of an Interface, you can use a Dynamic \nProxy (new feature of Java 1.3b).  The Mock would be an \nInvocationHandler, instead of a twin of B.\n\n6 Classloader\n\nUse a classloader to load the Mock instead of the real class.\n\n---\n\nThere may be other options, but these are the ones I&#39;ve heard of.  \nPersonally, I&#39;ve used everything except #6.  Options #1 (parameters) \nand #2 (reflection) are my favorites.  They are usually the easiest \nto implement and understand.  For #2, I&#39;ve used the \nPrivilegedAccessor.java [posted by Mr DiIorio] to make the reflection \nwork simple.\n\nI&#39;ve never seen anyone use #6 (classloaders), I think it would be fun \nto try.\n\n- Greg\n\n\n--- In junit@y..., &quot;Steve Freeman&quot; &lt;steve@m...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; RE: Method Chains, was Re: Testing private methodsAlternatively, \n&gt; change from:\n&gt; \n&gt; public class A {\n&gt;   public void f() {\n&gt;     b = new B();\n&gt;     b.doSomething();\n&gt;   }\n&gt; }\n&gt; \n&gt; to:\n&gt; \n&gt; public class A {\n&gt;   public void f(B b) {\n&gt;     b.doSomething(aValue());\n&gt;   }\n&gt; }\n&gt; \n&gt; The test then becomes:\n&gt; \n&gt; public class TestA {\n&gt;   public void testF() {\n&gt;     A anA = new A(aValue);\n&gt;     MockB mockB = new MockB();\n&gt;     mockB.setExpectedSomething(aValue);\n&gt; \n&gt;     a.f(mockB);\n&gt; \n&gt;     mockB.verify();\n&gt;   }\n&gt; }\n&gt; \n&gt; We have found that changing to a style where you pass behaviours \naround, rather than data, avoids things like subclassing production \ncode in a test and pushes the code to flexing in the &#39;right&#39; kinda \nways. If you can figure out what to pass in and what to verify, then \nthe rest of the test usually falls out.\n&gt; \n&gt; Steve\n\n\n",
