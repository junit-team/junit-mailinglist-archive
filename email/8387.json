There is a tendency in OOP to pretend<br/>\n&gt;there is behavior where there is no behavior. I think that is a mistake.<br/>\n&gt;Some objects in the system are just bags of data. I think public fields<br/>\n&gt;should do nicely there. Ward Cunningham has been experimenting with<br/>\n&gt;ignoring the prevaling paranoia against public data.

I don&#39;t think you<br/>\n&gt;were applying it to the latter, I just wanted to be clear.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Exactly. I&#39;m with you. Sometimes, it&#39;s just a bag of data. Maps would do.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; One counterexample is an object with 20 fields. Perhaps 20 set methods<br/>\n&gt;is clearer, at least in a language like Java with positional parameters.<br/>\n&gt;(In Smalltalk it&#39;s exactly the same, so it doesn&#39;t matter.) Should an<br/>\n&gt;object have 20 fields? Perhaps not, but some do. It is not clear that<br/>\n&gt;breaking that 20-field objects into four 5-field objects is any better.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;A twist on that... If that object needs to have 20 fields (which I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;believe it does) you can group fields together into other objects such<br/>\n&gt;that this object is a wrapper on 5 others, each with 4 fields.  The data<br/>\n&gt;is still in one place, but it&#39;s creation is much less cumbersome and you<br/>\n&gt;can create it in a sane state.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know that this is better: now I have to build five or six objects, and not just one. I think the creation is *no less* cumbersome in this case. That has been my observation.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJ. B.
