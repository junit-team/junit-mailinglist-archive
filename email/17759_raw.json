Bertrand Meyer was trying to come up with \n&gt;&gt;a set of conventions to prevent defensive programming.. the situation \n&gt;&gt;where every piece of code is responsible not only for itself but for its \n&gt;&gt;correct usage.  By advertising a contract, you make the preconditions, \n&gt;&gt;and usage, the caller&#39;s reponsibility.\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;I think you&#39;ve misunderstood Meyer. He wanted to make the checks easier \n&gt;to write. He didn&#39;t think they shouldn&#39;t happen. Providing correct input \n&gt;data is the client&#39;s responsibility. Recognizing when the client has not \n&gt;adhered to the contract is the library&#39;s responsibility.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nNo, the point of preconditions is really to make responsibility clear.  \nPeople often place too much emphasis on their runtime aspect. \n\nRegardless, you can have preconditions for interfaces in Java, you just \nhave to document them.\n\nMichael Feathers\nwww.objectmentor.com\n\n\n\n\n",
