It is a requirement of our tests that they continue to run after the first assertion fails.  We don&#39;t want fatal asserts in other words.  We would like to capture the results of all the assertions.  The current way JUnit functions is to fail out of the test at the first failed assertion.  This contradicts the requirement of our tests.  The junit3.7b.jar file available in the article Mike sent seems to solve our problem.  Thanks for your advice though!\n\nJosh Hoepner\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Eric Heikkila [mailto:ericheikkila@...]\nSent: Friday, February 22, 2002 4:32 PM\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: RE: [junit] multiple assertions\n\n\nOk, I&#39;m not quite understanding (or vice versa), so\nhow about showing us some examples?\n\nSomething like:\n\npublic class theTest extends TestCase {\n\nprivate DataClass data;\nprivate String name;\nprivate String address;\nprivate String phoneNumber;\n\npublic void setUp() {\n\n   name = &quot;Franks, Rick&quot;;\n   address = &quot;1313 MockingBird Lane&quot;;\n   phoneNumber = &quot;800-999-1234&quot;;\n\n   data = new DataClass(name, address, phoneNumber);\n}\n\npublic void testName() {\n\n   data.address(null);\n\n   assertNotNull(&quot;Name should not be null&quot;,\ndata.name());\n   assertEquals(&quot;Incorrect name: &quot;, name,\ndata.name());\n\n   assertNull(&quot;Address may be null&quot;, data.address());\n}\n\npublic void testAddress() {\n\n   data.name(null);\n\n   assertNotNull(&quot;Address should not be null&quot;,\ndata.address());\n   assertEquals(&quot;Incorrect address&quot;, address,\ndata.address());\n\n   assertTrue(!data.isOk());\n\n   // based on some silly assumption about\n   //    &#39;data&#39; being NOT OK if the address\n   //    is not null and the name is null.\n}\n}\n\n\nWhat is it you are trying to test?\nAnd how do you currently have the test written so that\nit does not do what you want it to do??\n\n-Eric\n\n--- &quot;Hoepner, Josh (J.M.)&quot; &lt;jhoepner@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; We are automating these JUnit tests for regression\n&gt; testing.
