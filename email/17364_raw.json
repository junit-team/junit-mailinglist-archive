Or, that \nis only a theoretical existence, since you can&#39;t know such code exists, \nuntil you test it, even if only by using it.\n\nIf a person has time to test it manually, and he uses the tests as \nchange detectors (so he runs them more than once in his life), then he \nvery likely has time to automate at least some non-trivial subset of \nthose tests. Over time, he&#39;ll find that automating some of those tests \nup front is faster than running them manually any number of times.\n\nWhat I have observed is that the &quot;time problem&quot; is not a matter of &quot;I \ndon&#39;t have time to write the tests&quot;, but rather a matter of &quot;I don&#39;t \nhave time to learn how to write the tests&quot;. Those are two very different \nanimals. In that case, I concur with Bob, that &quot;senior guys&quot; are guys \nwho take time to learn; and conversely, you can&#39;t be a &quot;senior guy&quot; if \nyou don&#39;t take time to learn. (Note, that doesn&#39;t have to be project \ntime. It&#39;s often spare time for those senior guys.)\n\n&gt; It&#39;s a fairly common occurrence, in my experience, and the reason behind my\n&gt; comments earlier: if other circumstances warrant it, it&#39;s okay to write the\n&gt; code, ship it and write the tests later.\n\nIf it doesn&#39;t have to work, that&#39;s fine.\n\n&gt; Just use your judgment, that&#39;s why your employer is paying you.\n\nI agree with this statement; however, &quot;judgment&quot; without information is \njust guessing.\n\nTake care.\n-- \nJ.
