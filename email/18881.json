Private methods<br/>\ngenerally mean that I have several abstraction layers living within<br/>\nthe same class.  I&#39;m not bothered by this in principle, until I find<br/>\nthe &quot;hidden&quot; abstraction layer troublesome or interesting enough that<br/>\nI&#39;m tempted to test it directly, in which case I take the time to<br/>\nthink about the name and interface of that hidden abstraction layer,<br/>\nand expose it as a class.<br/>\n<br/>\n   David Saff<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 2/12/07, Ole Ersoy &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ole_ersoy@...\">ole_ersoy@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Hi Guys,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Would it be a good idea to always use all public<br/>\n&gt; methods...?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In the context of a convention where there is a<br/>\n&gt; &quot;MainClass&quot; and a &quot;MainClassHelper&quot; that has public<br/>\n&gt; methods used to help the MainClass.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Users of MainClassHelper (The collaborator should<br/>\n&gt; really be MainClass only) know that this class exists<br/>\n&gt; mainly for the purpose of helping MainClass, and all<br/>\n&gt; the methods are public, so that they can be easily<br/>\n&gt; unit tested.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Otherwise they would be private or protected members<br/>\n&gt; of MainClass.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So MainClassHelper can really be thought of as a<br/>\n&gt; utility library that is specific to MainClass...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anyone know if there are security risks to this,<br/>\n&gt; beside API risks?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks,<br/>\n&gt; - Ole<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ____________________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Don&#39;t get soaked.
