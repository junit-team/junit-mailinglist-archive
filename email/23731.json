This output isn&#39;t just the number of tests failed/successful/ignored and time lapse, but it is the output generated by the tests and junit at run time.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would like to redirect the output to a file, I am looking at the junit source code (as a good boyscout) and the only classes I could find that MAYBE print on the console is junit.textui.ResultPrinter but it prints the results of the tests.<br/>\nMy question is:<br/>\nAre there any classes in the source code that prints output on the command line? (If yes, what are they?)<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you for your time</div>",
