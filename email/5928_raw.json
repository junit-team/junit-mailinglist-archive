To help me focus it better, I would appreciate\n&gt;&gt;input from the community with regard to what questions you would like to\n&gt;&gt;see answered/explored.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Dave:\n&gt; \n&gt; Since we&#39;ve been talking about making improvements to JUnit and most users\n&gt; of JUnit already understand the framework to some degree, this looks like a\n&gt; golden opportunity to explore, and certainly a concrete example of how one\n&gt; would apply TDD to the task of refactoring or improving an existing\n&gt; framework.\n&gt; \n&gt; A good approach to an article would be to select some improvement to JUnit\n&gt; and then make that improvement right there in the article, while\n&gt; illustrating how TDD is used within the process.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;d be happy to work with you on this, since I have existing needs for\n&gt; changes and I&#39;ve already specified them to some degree with tests.\n\nHow about starting by associating the TestCase/TestSuite contracts with\nexplicit interfaces.  That way you strengthen the API, removing\ndependencies on those two classes.\n\nThe refactoring would be done by creating the interfaces, and then\nhaving those two classes implement the interfaces.  From there, you can\nensure that the JUnit internals work with the new interfaces (instead\nof the classes).  You can even write the testcases to prove that old\nTestCases still work with this change.\n\nIt is doable, and it is a relatively simple refactoring that would be\nsuitable for an article.\n\n\n-- \n\n&quot;They that give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety\n  deserve neither liberty nor safety.&quot;\n                 - Benjamin Franklin\n\n\n",
