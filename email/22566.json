We would like to use JUnit, but we cannot find a way to make it do what we want.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have a db that contains some information. The client can choose a number of items in the db. These selected items are the tests to execute.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo my question is how can I create and launch a test (suite) based on some dynamic user input.<br/>\n<br/>\nI already looked at Paremeterized class, but it implies that we know statically in advance the data (which in this case should come from the dynamic client selection)<br/>\n<br/>\nA way to make it work is creating the test classes dynamically (code generation) but this is too much overhead.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs there a way to make this work, or is JUnit not intended to do this kind of things?<br/>\n<br/>\nregards<br/>\nhans</div>",
