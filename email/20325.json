So, i was wondering are there any<br/>\ntools for doing this end-to-end testing ? just like Junit ? <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks anyway for your valuable suggestions.. <br/>\n<br/>\nSarat. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Nat Pryce&quot; &lt;nat.pryce@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On 20/02/2008, edu_kumar &lt;sarat.beesa@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  My question is..<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  1) Whose responsibility is to initialize this &#39;Real&#39; object in my<br/>\nclass ?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s the responsibility of the code that creates the object to pass it<br/>\n&gt; the other objects that it depends on.  So, the unit test could pass<br/>\n&gt; mock dependencies to its constructor.  The real code would pass real<br/>\n&gt; dependencies to its constructors.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;  2) Should my unit tests cover this &#39;Initializing real time<br/>\nobjects&#39; as<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  well ?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The unit tests of objects that are made up of other objects (composite<br/>\n&gt; objects) would test the behaviour of those composite objects and,<br/>\n&gt; thereby, test how the internal parts of those composites are<br/>\n&gt; initialised.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; End-to-end tests cover the correct initialisation of all the objects<br/>\n&gt; in the system.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Usually a build runs unit tests and then a smoke test that runs a fast<br/>\n&gt; end-to-end test to check for obvious integration errors.  Then it runs<br/>\n&gt; more extensive end-to-end tests to exercise the features that users<br/>\n&gt; care about.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;  3) What way I can assure that my &#39;Real&#39; objects are initialized<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  properly ?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In TDD, you start with an end-to-end test.  Only when you have a<br/>\n&gt; failing end-to-end test for a given feature do you start drilling down<br/>\n&gt; to write unit tests for individual objects.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --Nat<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
