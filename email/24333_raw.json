I=\r\nf we feel strongly\n&gt; &gt; that it should remain consonant with @ThreadSafe, we=\r\n could make it a static\n&gt; &gt; inner annotation, and reference it as @RunListe=\r\nner.ThreadSafe.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m personally find with that as long as the JavaDo=\r\nc for the annotation\n&gt; makes it clear that a RunListener implementation ann=\r\notated with that\n&gt; interface will be treated differently than one not annot=\r\nated with that\n&gt; interface when addListener() and removeListener() is calle=\r\nd.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;  That might\n&gt; &gt; also have the advantage of making clear tha=\r\nt it&#39;s a single-purpose\n&gt; &gt; annotation (I&#39;d rather not, at this point, star=\r\nt speculatively figuring out\n&gt; &gt; what other interfaces might try to pun mea=\r\nnings onto a general-purpose\n&gt; &gt; ThreadSafe annotation)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m a littl=\r\ne curious about the third-party library implementation.  Let&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; say I wr=\r\nite a package FooTest which is compiled against JUnit 4.12, and it\n&gt; &gt; cont=\r\nains a FooListener I&#39;d like to mark threadsafe.  A client wants to use\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nit with JUnit 4.11 (she knows she won&#39;t get the concurrent performance\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nboost, but wants it to just work).  The document seems to assume that if\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; FooListener has a RunListener.TheadSafe annotation, then our client won&#39;t=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; have a problem (unless, likely, she actually tries to instantiate all =\r\nof\n&gt; &gt; the annotations from FooListener in her own code).\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Correct a=\r\ns of JDK 1.5.0_06. See\n&gt; http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3567413/why-doe=\r\nsnt-a-missing-annotation-cause-a-classnotfoundexception-at-runtime\n&gt; \n&gt; It =\r\nsounds that if the client wants to write code that extends FooListener\n&gt; th=\r\nen JUnit 4.12 will need to be on the compile-time classpath\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Ho=\r\nwever, the document\n&gt; &gt; assumes that declaring a marker interface ThreadSaf=\r\neRunListener _would_\n&gt; &gt; break the client.  Is that true?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I believe=\r\n it would result in a NoClassDefFoundError exception. It should be\n&gt; easy t=\r\no verify.\n&gt; \n&gt; Note that it may be hard to write a library that has a compi=\r\nle-time\n&gt; dependency on JUnit 4.12 while being runtime compatible with 4.11=\r\n for other\n&gt; reasons.\n&gt; \n&gt;  Does FooListener fail at bytecode\n&gt; &gt; verificat=\r\nion because the verifier wants to make sure that it implements all\n&gt; &gt; of T=\r\nhreadSafeRunListener&#39;s methods?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; That would be my guess.\n&gt; \n&gt; -- Ke=\r\nvin\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n\n\n\n",
