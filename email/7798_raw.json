Some of them have been helpful (ie. the \none that pointed me to jboss, cactus), althought most of &#39;em aren&#39;t. \nI&#39;ve decided to go to a bookstore and pickup a book on EJB. I \nfigured if i get familiar with EJB, it might be easier to understand \nthe testing itself. \nBefore, I was looking for a quick solution, by trying to look for \nhands on tutorial which explains about EJB as well as the testing \nitself. I guess there&#39;s no such thing out there. most of the \ntutorial on the testing is assuming that you are already familiar \nwith EJB. I got frustated after spending so many hours, and not \nbeing able to get anything useful out of google, and decided to post \na message here to see if the experts here can offer some guide.\n\nHowever, I must say this. I am really disappointed at some of the \nreplies out there which really don&#39;t address the real question. I am \nasking for some pointers on where to start looking if i were to \nlearn ejb and junit, and the replies that i got are totally \nirrelevant and unnecessary. \nI am sure that most of you that hang around here must be \nprofessional developer with years of programming experience, but the \nway you guys address a simple question is really out of context.\nA beginner asked for a hint or two cuz he wants to learn, and \ninstead of giving some hints, many of you are questioning his \nbackground, and some even are implying that maybe he&#39;s totally out \nof place, and should not be doing this; which does&#39;t answer the \nquestion at all.\n\nAnyway, I am just expressing myself, and I hope that I don&#39;t offend, \nor tick off anyone. I totally appreciate the time you guys took to \nreply to my message.\n\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Andrew Forward&quot; &lt;milkforlife@h...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; Scott Stirling said:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;JUnit is suitable for unit testing EJBs if you don&#39;t even know \nhow to\n&gt; &quot;pack&quot;\n&gt; a jar file? &quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Just a side concept about that packaging of jar files.  From a \ncomputer\n&gt; science perspective - issues like building and deployment are not \na very hot\n&gt; topic - at any level.  It would be nice it things were otherwise - \nbut some\n&gt; may argue that university is not there just to prepare you for a \njob... so,\n&gt; interest in deployment would be rooted in the research \npossibilities (which\n&gt; I have not seen much of)...\n&gt; \n&gt; Learning to jar takes about an hour .. learning it really well - \nhalf a day.\n&gt; Now learning about testing methodologies (such as unit testing and \nload\n&gt; testing) and other computer science concepts take much, much \nlonger.\n&gt; \n&gt; My point - just because you don&#39;t know  how to use a particular \ntool (and\n&gt; that&#39;s all jar is) does not mean that you are poorly suited for a \nresearch\n&gt; position (or even an employment one either).  It is more closely \nrelated to\n&gt; how well you conduct research in general - and how well you can \nsearch out\n&gt; answers to your questions in an academic manner.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; andrew f\n\n\n",
