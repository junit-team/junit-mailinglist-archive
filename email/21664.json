However, several of the services for<br/>\nwhich we used to look to SourceForge have moved to other providers:<br/>\njunit.org is being hosted and maintained by 8thlight, the mailing list<br/>\nis on yahoogroups, and, more recently, we&#39;ve switched to github for<br/>\nsource control.<br/>\n<br/>\nToday, we&#39;re going to, on an experimental basis, move issue tracking<br/>\nand snapshot downloads to github as well.  GitHub allows issues to be<br/>\ncreated in a couple fewer clicks, and new releases to be uploaded in<br/>\n_many, many_ fewer clicks, than SourceForge, which should allow our<br/>\nsmall team to be faster providing interim builds to play with, and<br/>\nresponding to issues.  We&#39;ll use the next couple of months to<br/>\ntransition.  Please immediately start tracking new bugs and feature<br/>\nrequests to:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://github.com/KentBeck/junit/issues\">http://github.com/KentBeck/junit/issues</a><br/>\n<br/>\nAnd look for interim builds at:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://github.com/KentBeck/junit/downloads\">http://github.com/KentBeck/junit/downloads</a><br/>\n<br/>\nWe will probably continue to mirror stable releases through<br/>\nSourceForge for at least the time being.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd please give feedback on the experience, either on this list, or on<br/>\nthe issue tracker itself.  Thanks,<br/>\n<br/>\n   David Saff</div>",
