Two of my books have information that might be helpful to\nyou. &quot;Test-Driven Development: By Example&quot; shows an example of writing a\ntesting framework. &quot;JUnit Pocket Guide&quot; talks about the patterns of using a\ntesting framework like JUnit. It seems to me that the biggest problem in\nimplementing such a tool is deciding what subset of features you are going\nto focus on. Both testing frameworks and coverage tools can contain many\nmore features than you are likely to get implemented in half a year. I would\nwrite a little tool that combines minimal testing and coverage features,\nmake sure it works on itself (you are studying computer science after all),\nand then add features one at a time.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nKent Beck\nThree Rivers Institute\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On \n&gt; Behalf Of ahmed fouad\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, August 30, 2005 1:31 PM\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: [junit] help please\n&gt; \n&gt; In the name of ALLAH\n&gt; I am a student in the final year of computer and informatio \n&gt; system and  I have a graduation project about implementing a \n&gt; unit testing tool with code coverage features, the unit \n&gt; testing tool will be like JUnit testing tool.\n&gt; please any one can help me in this topic send me \n&gt; is this a good idea to be implemented?\n&gt; what knowledge(tools or technology)should we learn to carry \n&gt; out this project?\n&gt; what are the problems to implement this project?\n&gt; Note:we are 5 members and work with JAVA.\n&gt; please reply me soon and also send your comments about any \n&gt; questions that I have not asked.\n\n\n",
