While I agree that one runner with two<br/>\nmechanisms sounds simpler than two runners with one mechanism each, I<br/>\nalso think that when you have two mechanisms, you have to address<br/>\ntheir interaction, which can lead to user confusion.

If there is<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; interest, I would be happy to contribute a patch to the JUnit project<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; to address it. On the other hand, if there is a way to solve this<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; problem differently in JUnit already, please let me know.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Ant and IDEA (the IDE from Intellij) don&#39;t agree on how to gather<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; classes for test. IDEA inspects the actual class for things that<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; extend TestCase or have a JUnit annotation on the class (or have a<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; static suite method) and executes the test. Ant gathers tests via<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; class names. To use the Ant method with JUnit outside of Ant, you can<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; use JUnitCore, and just pass it an array of classes gathered in the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Ant form. However IDEA doesn&#39;t report those results in its typical<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; fashion. It uses its own custom runner to gather and run these tests.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; The only option I see in the JUnit current code is to make a custom<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; runner that knows how to extract a Class[] array and pass it on to the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; standard runner, and then use the RunWith tag to annotate an arbitrary<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; class to get IDEA to think that it is running a test suite. I haven&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; actually done this to see if IDEA has any issues, but it seems like it<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; should work.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; My proposal is to add an annotation to the Suite class called<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; SuiteMethod that would annotate a method that returns a Class[] array.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; The Suite would then be built from the two annotations,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Suite.SuiteClasses plus any methods on the class (we could enforce<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; that they be public, static, take no parameters and return a Class[]<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; array) that are annotated with Suite.SuiteMethod and build the Suite<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; as a combination of all of the Arrays returned.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; What do you think?<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
