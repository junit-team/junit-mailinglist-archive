In\nthe\nrest of the properties, I&#39;m looking first to see if they exist and then\nI&#39;m\ncollecting all the entries for each path and putting them into a List of\nString. There are others, but this is the gist of what I&#39;m dealing with.\n\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; I think the answer is 2...  What I would do is simply create a Propertie\n&gt; object and fill it with values.  You will easily test your methods\n&gt; without having dozen of files everywhere.\n\nInteresting idea. You&#39;re saying to create a Properties object and then\n&quot;set&quot; the values as I want and to then process them. That would do some\nof the testing. However, I also need to make sure some mandatory\nProperties\nare there and have values assigned as well.\n\n\nPCM (Paul Michali)\n\nCarrier Voice Gateway Business Unit (CVGBU)\nCisco Systems, Inc.\n250 Apollo Drive\nChelmsford, MA 01824\n\nPhone : (800) 572-6771 x 45817  (978) 244-5817 [direct]\nPaging: (800) 365-4578 [voice]  pcm@...
