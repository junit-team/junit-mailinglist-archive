These certifications/training details are required as per business<br/>\n&gt; requirements. We would like to get few of our associated certified. Please<br/>\n&gt; let us know if you have any learning partner or JUnit itself could provide<br/>\n&gt; us the training/certifications.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Request you provide the appropriate contact list if I have posted the query<br/>\n&gt; on the wrong mailing list.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks and Regards,<br/>\n&gt; Purvi Verma<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; =====-----=====-----=====<br/>\n&gt; Notice: The information contained in this e-mail<br/>\n&gt; message and/or attachments to it may contain<br/>\n&gt; confidential or privileged information.
