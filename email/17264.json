I avoided taking that route before since<br/>\n&lt;junit&gt; and &lt;junitreport&gt; were such an improvement over what I had<br/>\noriginally.  However (I think) I have run up against a limitation of<br/>\nthe &lt;junit&gt; task which makes me revisit this solution.  The &lt;junit&gt;<br/>\ntask isn&#39;t working for me because it won&#39;t allow you to control how<br/>\nmuch exception stack trace information is kept for each failure.  I<br/>\nonly want to see the first line or two (the only really useful info in<br/>\nthe exception stack), but I want to limit the amount of exceptions<br/>\nthat are reported because I appear to be running out of memory when I<br/>\nrun a full test suite of over 80 tests.  This never happened before I<br/>\nstarted using Ant/&lt;junit&gt;/&lt;junitreport&gt;, and my assumption is that the<br/>\nexception stacks for each failure are being kept in memory by the<br/>\n&lt;junit&gt; task, which is expecting to write all of the info to XML once<br/>\nthe suite completes.  Unfortunately after so many failures the<br/>\nexception stack info being held in memory is so much that the program<br/>\ncrashes with an out-of-memory error.  Is my assumption correct?  Will<br/>\nthe TestListener approach help me?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--James<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;J.

So if I have three<br/>\n&gt; &gt; test cases in the suite, and the first and third test cases succeed,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; then the output file looks like &quot;..F.&quot; followed by the errors and a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; summary of how many successes/failures. There are about 80 test cases<br/>\n&gt; &gt; in the suite I&#39;m working with, and it is very time consuming and error<br/>\n&gt; &gt; prone to try to figure out which tests succeeded and which ones failed<br/>\n&gt; &gt; from a long list of dots and dot-F&#39;s. What I would like instead is to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; have the report look something like this:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; test-01-01: success<br/>\n&gt; &gt; test-01-02: failure<br/>\n&gt; &gt; test-02-01: success<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &lt;errors&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &lt;summary&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I have looked at the JavaDoc for junit.textui.TestRunner and there is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; no way to specify how the final report comes out, more specifically no<br/>\n&gt; &gt; way to tell it to print the name of the test case and the result<br/>\n&gt; &gt; rather than either &quot;.&quot; for success or &quot;.F&quot; for failures.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Can anyone advise me how I can modify this behavior? Am I stuck and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; just need to write a parser to convert the &quot;..F.&quot; to a meaningful<br/>\n&gt; &gt; report as to which tests succeeded or failed (as in the above<br/>\nexample)?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You&#39;re not stuck writing a parser. Instead, you can write a<br/>\nTestListener <br/>\n&gt; that generates the kind of report you&#39;d like to generate. I&#39;ve taken<br/>\nthe <br/>\n&gt; liberty of sending you (privately) a recipe from _JUnit Recipes_ on the <br/>\n&gt; topic. I have found it easiest to use the JUnit-addons test runner and <br/>\n&gt; plug in whatever test listeners I want.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Take care.<br/>\n&gt; -- <br/>\n&gt; J. B.
