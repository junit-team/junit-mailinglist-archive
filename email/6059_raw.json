So you will start to have a\n&gt; client part that calls your URL, parses the XML and display the result.\n&gt; All is fine but then you also want to be able to execute the test from\n&gt; any of the existing JUnit integration tools (from IDEs, using Ant junit\n&gt; task, etc). So you will transform your client side into a TestCase so\n&gt; that it can be run by any test runner ...\n&gt;\n&gt; ... and this is Cactus ! :-)\n&gt;\n&gt; To summarise :\n&gt;\n&gt; - yes Cactus can be a simple as what you describe (this is actually a\n&gt; feature of version 1.4, which is not released yet - but soon to be)\n&gt;\n&gt; - it allow for more should you need it\n&gt;\n&gt; - it is documented and there are resources on Cactus : website + books +\n&gt; articles\n&gt;\n&gt; - BTW, Cactus integrates completely with Ant to automated start up and\n&gt; shutdown of application servers\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;/biased&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yes, I am the original author of Cactus and thus I am biased :-) but as\n&gt; a user I would always go with existing framework if I find any that\n&gt; perform what I want. For example, I wouldn&#39;t dare write my logging\n&gt; framework, MVC controller one, XML to Java mapping one, etc.\n&gt;\n&gt; In the end it is your choice. I&#39;m just writing this email so that you\n&gt; know Cactus does what you want and that you shouldn&#39;t skip it because\n&gt; you think it doesn&#39;t.\n&gt;\n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; -Vincent\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; &gt; From: Michael Rettig [mailto:mrettig@...]\n&gt; &gt; Sent: 13 July 2002 02:45\n&gt; &gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; Subject: RE: [junit] Testing a class inside an Application Server\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Nicholas Lesiecki&quot; &lt;nick@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; What you describe sounds very similar to Cactus:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://jakarta.apache.org/cactus/\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Have you looked at it?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yes, and what I&#39;m describing is far simpler than Cactus. There is no\n&gt; &gt; framework to speak of. Just a servlet that knows how to run a test\n&gt; suite\n&gt; &gt; and return the results as xml. For instance, you would pass this URL\n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; your browser to run the tests in a remote app server.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; http://localhost:8080/junit?classname=com.package.test.TestCase\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; It is very simple, but powerful. Since the test executes within the\n&gt; &gt; servlet container you can access all the facilities of the app server.\n&gt; &gt; We&#39;ve also automated the startup and shutdown of the app server, so\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; entire test process is completely scripted. This makes it simple to\n&gt; plug\n&gt; &gt; the whole process into our cruise control build process.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Mike\n&gt; &gt; --\n&gt; &gt; __________________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sign-up for your own FREE Personalized E-mail at Mail.com\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; http://www.mail.com/?sr=signup\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Save up to $160 by signing up for NetZero Platinum Internet service.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; http://www.netzero.net/?refcd=N2P0602NEP8\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
