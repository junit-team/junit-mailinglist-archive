I am testing the merging of these xml\nfiles. The following could be possible\n\nxml1-xml1\nxml1-xml2\nxml1-xml3\nxml3-xml1\nxml3-xml2\nxml3-xml3\n\nOne method is to write testMethods for all these combination.\nOne more approach is just write two for loops which will do this for\nme.Theproblem with this approach is the method is just single. Due to\nthis, what\nis happening is the JUnit report just shows a single success or failure.\n\nI tried Anonymous Inner class approach but that did not work.\n\nCan somebody point me to some different approach to just have all the\nresults displayed using just a single mehtod or some solution like this?\n\n-Thanks\n\n-- \nhttp://shahharshal.blogspot.com/\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
