I know the issues, and I&#39;m not \ntrying to force you to type too much.\n\n&gt; Just like the test name often needs further clarification (never pass\n&gt; up an oportunity for documentation), often the reason for the\n&gt; assertion is not self-apparent.  You can try to argue that &quot;it ought\n&gt; to be, or rewrite your code!&quot; but, as before, I think you&#39;re straying\n&gt; too close to the &quot;Java code is self-documenting&quot; argument, which I\n&gt; find ... dubious at best.\n\nI don&#39;t know. I just wrote this in an XHTMLUnit test today:\n\nassertXpathExists(\n     somewhereThereIsA(formNamed(&quot;demographics&quot;))\n     .eventuallyContainingA(textFieldNamed(&quot;firstName&quot;)), document);\n\nThis translated to the XPath expression\n\n     //form[@name=&quot;demographics&quot;]//input[@type=&quot;text&quot; and @name=&quot;firstName&quot;]\n\nIs a comment or a failure message going to make that clearer?\n\n&gt; It makes your test reports clearer when failures occur  I prefer to\n&gt; see &quot;Wrong number of Login attempts recorded ...&quot; rather than\n&gt; &quot;testValidLogin.assertEquals failed ... &quot;  As a result I often don&#39;t\n&gt; even have to look at the test code to fix the problem.  Without\n&gt; messages, I have to at the very least go and look to see what the\n&gt; assertion&#39;s variables are named before I can begin fixing the problem.\n\nYou&#39;re right: it would be nice if the failure message reported the name \nof the variable in this case.\n\n&gt; It&#39;s also easier to write a short sentence about what&#39;s being asserted\n&gt; than it is to be sure that you&#39;ve chosen values and variable names\n&gt; such that future readers can divine their purpose.  That&#39;s a valuable\n&gt; task as well, but for the time involved, there&#39;s no reason you can&#39;t\n&gt; write a little text as well.  Or to put it pithily:\n&gt; \n&gt; I feel that I&#39;m proficient with Java, but when I want to explain\n&gt; something, especially *why* something, I generally prefer English.\n\nI agree and explain &quot;why&quot; in English, but nost of the time, test case \nclass name, method name and line number is enough for me to know what \nfailed, from which I generally can determine why it failed. If not, then \nmy tests are too big (and that&#39;s an entirely different problem).\n-- \nJ. B.
