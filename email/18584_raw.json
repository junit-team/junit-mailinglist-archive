So I thought why not auto g=\r\nenerate some \ntest cases? I dont mean all of them since testing is creative=\r\n \nwork...but surely the basic few?\n\nStressed,\nJimm\n\n\n\n\n--- In junit@yahoogr=\r\noups.com, Ilja Preuss &lt;it@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; junitheadache schrieb:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I a=\r\nm currently working on auto generation of test cases for TDD \nfor \n&gt; &gt; my h=\r\nonors year project.\n&gt; \n&gt; Why?
