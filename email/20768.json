After spending lots of time it turned out to be<br/>\ncaused by iterating over a HashSet. I wrongly thought the order doesn&#39;t<br/>\nmatter I used the HashSet. Additionally I didn&#39;t override the<br/>\nhashCode()-functions. This causes my program to iterate sometimes (usually<br/>\nwhen I run as JUnit-test but quite never when I run with a debugger and<br/>\nbreakpoints - I guess it has something to do with the hashcodes depending on<br/>\nthe allocated memory) in another order.<br/>\nSo the assumption that the order of iteration doesn&#39;t matter was wrong and<br/>\nthis causes the failure.<br/>\n<br/>\nPossibly it&#39;s somehow similar to your problem...</div>",
