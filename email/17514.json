This is a web-development<br/>\n&gt; framework that has testing built in from the very start. Virtually<br/>\n&gt; every facet of a rails application is intended to be written using<br/>\n&gt; TDD. The point is that the new hyper-productive frameworks are<br/>\n&gt; adopting TDD from the get-go.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Not disputing this point (as I have only been using Rails now for a week or<br/>\ntotal and so far I love the testing capabilities that I have seenl) but I<br/>\nwas disappointed that the Pragmatic Series book Agile Web Development with<br/>\nRails has no coverage of applying TDD with Rails.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne could argue that this was not the point of the book, that it is about<br/>\nlearning the Rails framework but I just expected to see some mention and<br/>\ndemonstration of it by either Dave Thomas of Mike Clark.<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps when I have moved further along I may change my opinion on this :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<br/>\nShane<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
