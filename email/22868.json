Will future JUnit version continue to ship with Hamcrest?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, having made this decision, we&#39;ll stick to it until convinced it&#39;s<br/>\ndoing more harm than good.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Do you have plans to update to Hamcrest 1.2 or higher?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Unfortunately, the last time we looked at the typing changes in<br/>\nHamcrest 1.2, we found that we couldn&#39;t automatically upgrade people<br/>\nwithout changing compiling tests into non-compiling tests, and, if I<br/>\nremember, in a few pathological cases, passing tests into failing<br/>\ntests.  We guessed that of people who used the hamcrest features<br/>\nbundled with JUnit, there were more that would be hurt by a version<br/>\nchange than would be helped by it, so we&#39;ve stayed here.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Why is there no junit-dep anymore, i.e. how are we supposed to use JUnit with Hamcrest 1.2?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>junit-dep has been up on github for every release.  Whoever has been<br/>\nputting JUnit up on maven, I take it, hasn&#39;t been also putting up<br/>\njunit-dep?  I&#39;m sorry to say that I&#39;m very aware that a lot of people<br/>\nare indebted to the anonymous time-donor who&#39;d been keeping the maven<br/>\nrepos up-to-date until several months ago.  I&#39;ve been reluctant to<br/>\naccept full responsibility for feeding a repository I neither use nor<br/>\nfully understand until some point where I was sure I could quickly<br/>\nrespond to millions of users who got their junit jars auto-updated in<br/>\na way that broke all their tests.  This might be overly cautious of<br/>\nme.<br/>\n<br/>\n   David Saff<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Cheers,<br/>\n&gt; Peter<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
