I do mind not having<br/>\na notation for `the end of the line, however it&#39;s supposed to<br/>\nhappen in this streamlike thing that I am writing down`.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; This means when you&#39;re writing or<br/>\n&gt; reading a protocol or network file format that specifies a linefeed, you<br/>\n&gt; know what you&#39;re getting. You can depend on it. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s fine and I have no quarrel with it. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; In 2005 there is no good<br/>\n&gt; reason to change the line separator to match some imagined platform<br/>\n&gt; default.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not asking for that. I&#39;m asking for a notation for end-of-line;<br/>\nit&#39;s not the same thing. You may have a case that such a thing<br/>\ncannot plausibly be provided.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; All reasonable text editors can handle &#92;r, &#92;n, or &#92;r&#92;n. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That depends on what you mean by &quot;handle&quot; and &quot;reasonable&quot;. <br/>\n(I use a text editor which I suspect you would classify differently<br/>\nthan I would.) <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Many<br/>\n&gt; protocols and file formats specify one or the other of these. For<br/>\n&gt; instance HTTP headers MUST be terminated with &#92;r&#92;n. &#92;n and &#92;r alone are<br/>\n&gt; incorrect (though many clients are liberal in what they accept). This is<br/>\n&gt; regardless of platform or OS.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, that one has always puzzled me too.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; We live in a multiplatform, multi-OS, multilingual world. Platform<br/>\n&gt; defaults of all kinds are harmful. Data must not be tied to one type of<br/>\n&gt; computer or operating system. We need multiplatform, multilingual,<br/>\n&gt; multilocale data.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>We live in a multiplatform world in which different platforms<br/>\nhave different conventions for what counts as a &quot;line&quot; in a &quot;text<br/>\nfile&quot;. I&#39;d prefer to be able to write a &quot;text output stream&quot; without<br/>\nhaving to jump through hoops to separate one line from the next<br/>\nin my text strings. Similarly I&#39;d like to be able to read &quot;lines&quot;<br/>\nfrom a &quot;text file&quot; without having to dither about how those lines<br/>\nare separated.<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps I&#39;m just recklessly optimistic.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nChris &quot;all the diodes down my left side&quot; Dollin<br/>\nThe software engineer&#39;s song: &quot;who knows where the time goes&quot;.</div>",
