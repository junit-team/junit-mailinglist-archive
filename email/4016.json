It&#39;s like saying SQL code doesn&#39;t need <br/>\n&gt; testing as<br/>\n&gt; mush as java code.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Programmer A:<br/>\n&gt; When I do unit testing, I just run my code in a couple of <br/>\n&gt; conditions and<br/>\n&gt; look if it&#39;s ok.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; XPer:<br/>\n&gt; You should really program those tests so they are repeatable, <br/>\n&gt; fast to run<br/>\n&gt; and don&#39;t need any human interaction to verify if they pass. <br/>\n&gt; Do automated<br/>\n&gt; unit testing! Use  JUnit!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Why doesn&#39;t the same applies to SQL queries? In reality the <br/>\n&gt; programmer DOES<br/>\n&gt; test his SQL queries by trying them and looking at results. <br/>\n&gt; (&quot;make sure your<br/>\n&gt; SQL is valid&quot;) so why not automate it like the rest?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve seen queries way more complex than some Java code. I&#39;m <br/>\n&gt; pretty sure<br/>\n&gt; everybody did. Don&#39;t you want that when somebody will need to <br/>\n&gt; modifiy the<br/>\n&gt; query (to add a filtering condition for example) they can <br/>\n&gt; press the button<br/>\n&gt; and run the tests to ensure the query is still ok?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What I do is I connect to a special DB (with a replica of the <br/>\n&gt; schema of the<br/>\n&gt; real DB) populated with test data. I also dynamically add <br/>\n&gt; data (in setup)<br/>\n&gt; and delete it (in teardown) for some tests. Or check that my <br/>\n&gt; code really<br/>\n&gt; inserted a row, etc. Of course, if a query is like <br/>\n&gt; selectAll(), you might be<br/>\n&gt; influenced by other programmers using the same test DB at the <br/>\n&gt; same time, so<br/>\n&gt; you will want something like a test db per programmer. And <br/>\n&gt; then you start to<br/>\n&gt; find it hard to deal with this increasingly complex solution <br/>\n&gt; so you drop all<br/>\n&gt; of this and return to &quot;make sure your SQL is valid&quot; testing, no more<br/>\n&gt; automated tests for SQL.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I would really like to have a tool that helped me test my SQL <br/>\n&gt; code and setup<br/>\n&gt; testcases as easily as the JUnit testcase for Java. I can&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; use a sql only<br/>\n&gt; test tool: I don&#39;t want to test the SQL outside the java code <br/>\n&gt; and then have<br/>\n&gt; the java code use those statements. Why? Because often what I <br/>\n&gt; want to test<br/>\n&gt; is if the transaction is correctly rolledback in a special <br/>\n&gt; case, stuff like<br/>\n&gt; that that needs java code and SQL. But really 10 lines of <br/>\n&gt; code and 3 lines<br/>\n&gt; of sql, so it is a &quot;unit&quot; difficult to break down further <br/>\n&gt; without loosing a<br/>\n&gt; lot of test cases. And what about testing failure of a DB <br/>\n&gt; connection at a<br/>\n&gt; critical point? Mock objects seem to be usefull for this. <br/>\n&gt; Really, there is a<br/>\n&gt; need for somebody to build a tool or documentatin explaining <br/>\n&gt; the best way to<br/>\n&gt; do all of this.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve already tought about solutions for DB-interacting code <br/>\n&gt; testing  (see<br/>\n&gt; posts in archive) but all my ideas are going into direction where the<br/>\n&gt; infrastructure needed is heavy and difficult to maintain. Any <br/>\n&gt; brillant tool<br/>\n&gt; or ideas out there for all of this?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; mathieu<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; PS: The original poster should also look at MockObjects to <br/>\n&gt; mock the results<br/>\n&gt; of the DB. They might help depending on what you want to do. <br/>\n&gt; But then you<br/>\n&gt; aren&#39;t testing the SQL since you are mocking the execution engine.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; From: Nilesh Thali<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Sent: Monday, February 11, 2002 5:01 PM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [junit] Database Select query checks!! newbie<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; (2) Your tests are simple: populate the database with data, <br/>\n&gt; write News<br/>\n&gt; beans<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that represent that data, assert that getAllNews() answers <br/>\n&gt; the same Set<br/>\n&gt; (or<br/>\n&gt; &gt; List, if you care about order within the collection) of <br/>\n&gt; News beans.
