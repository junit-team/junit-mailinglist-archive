JTS specification allows nested transaction (spec \n&gt; 1.0 says : &quot;not required&quot; but you can find JTS compliant platforms that \n&gt; support it) :\n\n&gt; Bruce suggested that you may be able to get something to work with\nnested\n&gt; transactions, perhaps using a transaction service such as JTA/JTS. \nSounds\n&gt; good to me, but I haven&#39;t had the opportunity to investigate this idea\nor\n&gt; the Java Transaction APIs.\n&gt; \n&gt; Can anyone comment on this approach?\n\nOTS subtransactions are very different from top-level transactions. \nResources are not consulted and no two-phase commit occurs. \nSubtransactions simply promote registered resources if they commit and\ndiscard them if they rollback.  You will need to use subtransaction-aware\nresources (which are not resources, go figure) to interact with the\ntransaction manager for a subtransaction.  And that is far more than you\nwanted to learn that much about the OMG Transaction Spec, I bet.\n\n-Steve  :)\n\n\n=====\nSteve Morgan       xerafin@...   http://profiles.yahoo.com/xerafin\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nGet email alerts & NEW webcam video instant messaging with Yahoo!
