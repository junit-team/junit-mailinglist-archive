I know e-mail is so<br/>\n&gt; tone flat, so maybe I shouldn&#39;t have taken the risk, but I<br/>\n&gt; was not meaning to be rude. I apologize if that is how it came off.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Apology accepted. Guess I was a little bit sensitive when I read your<br/>\nmail... ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Also -- if you interpreted this as &quot;junit isn&#39;t good&quot;, please<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t. I was replying to J.B saying if I had lots of core<br/>\n&gt; failures then I had other problems,<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Please reread - you will see that he suggested you *might* have other<br/>\nproblems.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; and I was saying ---<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t folks w/ problems need good testing?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Oh, ok. I accept that you said that, though I still don&#39;t hear it from<br/>\nyour original sentence. Thanks for the clarification.<br/>\n<br/>\n*If* you do have a process/people problem, though, I don&#39;t think that<br/>\ntinkering with Junit is the best solution. The mass of failing tests is<br/>\nonly a symptom, and by trying to fix it with Junit, you will only cure<br/>\nthe symptom, not the real problem. By solving the real problem, the need<br/>\nto change the way Junit works will vanish. In fact, aggravating the<br/>\nproblem by letting more tests fail due to a single problem might<br/>\nactually *help* you solve the real problem (by making it more visible).<br/>\n*If* you do have a process/people problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, tell us more about those failing tests?<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards, Ilja</div>",
