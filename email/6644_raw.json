(Yes, I know bad tests can\n\n\n&gt; I&#39;m tempted to say that the generated tests is what you should look \n&gt; into, rather than JUnit.  For example, if your generated test put \n&gt; something like this into the body:\n&gt; \n&gt; throw new Exception(&quot;Test Not Yet Implemented&quot;);\n&gt; \n&gt; -shane\n \n\n&gt;    From: &quot;J. B. Rainsberger&quot; &lt;jbr@...&gt;\n&gt; Then fix the test generator. I use an explicit failure to indicate that\n&gt; I have not yet written the test. In fact, in my &quot;JUnit: A Starter\n&gt; Guide&quot;, I suggest starting with this test:\n&gt; \n&gt; testSomething:\n&gt;     fail(&quot;Not yet implemented&quot;)\n&gt; \n&gt; As I add code to the test, I keep the fail statement in there until I\n&gt; have decided that the test is complete.\n&gt; \n&gt; It sounds to me like you should consider changing the test generator,\n&gt; and not JUnit, to solve your problem.\n\nWhy are there empty methods at all?\n \nI know, that some of you practice TDD and are very active in the \ntestdrivendevelopment list. Empty tests won&#39;t happen with TDD, \nat least not without any generator. ;-)\n\nIf you have at least a compilable skeleton of your application class,\ntools like our JUnitDoclet or many others can generate a skeleton \nof TestCases - just the skeleton, not much flesh. So I&#39;d like to\nconsider the generating as:\n  Offering a place to fill in some tests very easy. \n(You may nee functional tests too, but that&#39;s of topic here.)\nAny code generator will do that, after all that is what they are \nbuild for. If you don&#39;t fill in the tests, that is a different thing.\n\nA generator could put fail(); in any empty tests very easy.\nBut there is a major downside too, especially for regenerating \ntools loke JUnitDoclet. I don&#39;t want to copy/paste half \na page to this email, please see:\n  http://www.junitdoclet.org/faq.html#fail_not_default \n\nBack to the question from Steve. \n\nHe asked me the same thing directly as well. If I understand \nhim right, he want&#39;s to measure his progress in writing tests \nfor a given application. (With a generator, the number of \ntests is a constant as long as the application stays as it is.)\n\n * Counting the assertions is one option he came up with. \n    \n * I suggested the size of all tests as a very rough estimate\n   to be another option. (Since I&#39;m not payed by kbyte, \n   I prefer that way of measuring progress because of it&#39;s \n   simplicity.)\n\n * Test coverage tools are very likely the most precice option.\n\n * Removing empty methods as an additional step in building\n   the tests could serve as an option too. (A simple script could \n   do that.) But the estimate is not much better than &quot;size of\n   all tests&quot;, isn&#39;t it? (You meight measure the number of tests \n   you&#39;ve touched, but not the care you put into each test.)\n\nAnyway, the next version of JUnitDoclet will report the number \nof empty methods each time it generates. Maybe we provide \nan option to list them too.  \n\nI hope, this is was helpful to someone.\n\nKind Regards,\n\nSteffen Gemkow\n\n\n",
