Our goal is to<br/>\n&gt; eliminate such tests, but exposure of those tests is required to<br/>\n&gt; achieve this goal.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It sounds like you either want Categories, have your own annotation and<br/>\nwrite a custom Filter.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother option would be to write a method that checks an environment<br/>\nvariable or system property and based on the results optionally calls<br/>\nAssume.assumeTrue(false).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; The following (especially the cons since I&#39;m biased and there&#39;s lots<br/>\n&gt; about JUnit I don&#39;t yet understand) will likely be missing items but<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ll try to be fair about them. If there&#39;s anything missing, I&#39;m sure<br/>\n&gt; people will jump in.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Pro&#39;s:<br/>\n&gt; * Simpler code. @Ignore processing would simply be just another<br/>\n&gt; filter. Existing duplicate code to check for @Ignore annotations will<br/>\n&gt; disappear.<br/>\n&gt; * Conceptually simpler. @Ignore and Filters aren&#39;t two separate things<br/>\n&gt; with different hard-coded nuances.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>But they currently *do* have different nuances. Filtered tests do not show<br/>\nup in the Description tree; Ignored tests do. JUnit provides notifications<br/>\nwhen &quot;running&quot; an ignored test; no notification exists for filtering tests.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey are also semantically different IMHO. @Ignore is a code-level<br/>\nindication to never run a test. Filtering is a way to run a subset of the<br/>\ntests.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounds like you want tests that are run in some environments and not<br/>\nothers; I think Ignore is a poor choice because it doesn&#39;t allow you to<br/>\nspecify which environments you want to run them in. Again, I would use<br/>\nCategories or a custom annotation and a filter.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Con&#39;s:<br/>\n&gt; * Slower performance. Since notifications will have to be made, the<br/>\n&gt; set of tests to be run can&#39;t be culled down. Such slower performance<br/>\n&gt; is theoretical and ought to be measured.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Potential alternatives:<br/>\n&gt; * Have an option (somewhere) that allows notification for filtered tests.<br/>\n&gt; * Have a fireFiltered() method for notifiers.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Filtering can happen before RunNotifiers are added. One way to filter is to<br/>\ncreate a Request, and then call Request.filterWith(), and then run the<br/>\ntests. When you filter a request, the filtered items vanish from the<br/>\nRunner/Description tree. It would be hard to change that behavior without<br/>\nbreaking existing users.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Kevin<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
