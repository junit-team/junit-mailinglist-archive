The system under test is then configured to\nconnect back to the stub ser=\r\nvice in the test, and the test can prime\nit with responses to drive the tes=\r\nt scenario.\n\nI usually write some builder classes to create those responses=\r\n, to\nshield the tests from the on-the-wire format used by the third party\ns=\r\nervice.\n\nBut I also test against responses captured from the real service t=\r\no\nmake sure that the stub service and builders aren&#39;t giving me a false\nsen=\r\nse of security.\n\nFinally, I&#39;ll plan some integration testing against the se=\r\nrvice using\nan environment or account that is provided by the third party f=\r\nor\ntesting.  I try to get that integration testing started as early as\nposs=\r\nible (during development, not in a final testing phase) so that\nthere&#39;s as =\r\nmuch time as possible to deal with any misunderstandings\nand defects it rai=\r\nses.\n\n--Nat\n\n2009/6/29 angeshwar &lt;angeshwar@...&gt;:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt;\n&gt; I hav=\r\ne a client server application. The client connects with a remote server\n&gt; (=\r\n3rd party) and sends/receives different kinds of messages.\n&gt;\n&gt; For my Junit=\r\n test cases I am implementing my own server which simulates the\n&gt; behavior =\r\nof the 3rd party server.\n&gt;\n&gt; Whats the best approach to test this.\n&gt;\n&gt; - Wh=\r\nere do I include the code that actually launches my local test server\n&gt; (sh=\r\nould this part of Junit test package)\n&gt; - For each message type (exchanged =\r\nb/w client and my test server) that I\n&gt; will be testing, do I kick start / =\r\nshut down the server (seperately for each\n&gt; test case)\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n\n\n-- \nhttp://w=\r\nww.natpryce.com\n\n",
