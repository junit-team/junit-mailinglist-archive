I want to test that the method \ndidn&#39;t throw any errors, and objects were added to several lists.\nDo I\n1) invoke the method in setUp and have methods testNoErrors, \ntestAddedToList1, testAddedToList2 and a tearDown\nmethod which cleans up the affects of the setUp method.\n2) keep the same test methods but invoke the method in each test method\n\nI&#39;m also having problems with test dependencies. For example, I have a \ncreate, retrieve and a delete methods. In order to test that the create \nmethod is working I have to use the retrieve method. In order to clean up \nafter I need to use the delete method.\nAny of these could fail but I&#39;m only testing one. If create does fail \nretrieve can&#39;t be tested because I need create to work to add test data to \nretrieve. How do people usually get over this?\nthanksThomas\n\n\n",
