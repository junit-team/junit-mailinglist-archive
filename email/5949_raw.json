Summarizing a huge specification, messages are sent through\nthe ports based on transitions and the exisiting state of hierachical\nstate diagrams.  The situation seems ideal for unit testing since the\nwhole environment is complex and unit testing would ensure that the\nmessages sent, based on the state transitions are correct after\nmodifications and we could automatically test a huge number of cases.\n It&#39;s not actually _what_ is sent, since that can be tested, but it&#39;s\nthat the correct sequence of messages was requested to be sent (based,\nin this case, on string identifiers).\n\nMy problem is that the state of the object after the call is the same\nas before the call, or at least the sending of the message is not, and\ncannot easily be indicated in the state of the object without changing\nthe runtime behavior of the object.\n\nI hope all this makes sense.  I&#39;d appreciate any suggestions.  My only\nthought for checking this is something like a log file, or Log4J\nlogger.  After the test I could check the logger and make sure that it\ncontains _exactly_ what I would expect - but this seems somewhat complex.\n\nJim\n\n\n\n\n",
