Run a subset of tests during active development, all tests for<br/>\nintegration & build. Use techniques like Mock Objects to insulate things<br/>\nbeing tested, and to speed the tests.<br/>\n<br/>\n    It&#39;s nice to get a complete list of failures so that you<br/>\n    can attempt to fix as many as possible before having to dive into the build<br/>\n    process again...<br/>\n<br/>\nAs above, you need tools that support incremental development.  Batch<br/>\nmode development doesn&#39;t cut it anymore, especially not if you are<br/>\ntrying to be Agile (or, better yet, eXtreme).  Also, if you have<br/>\nmultiple failures, they may be ripple effects, although if you are<br/>\nwriting tests properly (which having them all in one method isn&#39;t) they<br/>\nshould be independent.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat raises another point:  If you have all your tests in one method (an<br/>\nextreme case.. even just multiple independent tests in the same method)<br/>\nyou loose the independence,  subsequent tests are sensitive to the<br/>\nactions of previous ones.<br/>\n<br/>\nDave<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nDave Astels<br/>\n  Coauthor of &quot;A Practical Guide to XP&quot; <br/>\n  Editor of the Test-Driven Development Edition of The Coad Letter<br/>\n  Presenter at XP2002 of: <br/>\n    the &quot;XP For One&quot; tutorial & &quot;Refactoring with UML&quot; paper <br/>\nCEO & Master Software Craftsman <br/>\n<br/>\nAn Agile Software Studio<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
