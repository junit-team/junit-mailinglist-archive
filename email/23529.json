It turns out that the floats were being casted to doubles, so I modified the code so that the floats remained as floats. At the request of David Saff, I attempted to write a test that would cause either the previous implementation that printed out thrown exceptions with doubles, or my new implementation that does the same with floats instead, to fail. So far, I have only been able to write tests with wide varieties of input that cause both implementations to fail, but not just one, just because of the messy nature of floats and doubles. I have run out of ideas of input to use (two float arrays to be compared against each other and a maximum delta when comparing the floats in the two arrays) that would cause only one implementation to fail. Any ideas? <br/>\n<br/>\nRegards,<br/>\nJuan</div>",
