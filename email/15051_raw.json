Followup below--\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On \n&gt; Behalf Of Eugene Kuleshov\n&gt; Sent: Sunday, October 02, 2005 1:08 PM\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: RE: [junit] Proposed parameterized test syntax for JUnit 4\n&gt; \n&gt; Kent,\n&gt; \n&gt;   I like that it will be again possible to dynamically generate test \n&gt; data and I believe it is a good change to introduce constructor with \n&gt; test parameters because it is less error prone then using annotated \n&gt; fields for the same purpose.\n&gt; \n&gt;   However there are still few flaws in this design.\n&gt; \n&gt;   First of all you are forcing test runner to create new \n&gt; class instance \n&gt; for each test, which is probably good thing from the point of \n&gt; unit test \n&gt; isolation enforcement, but from other hand it put a huge \n&gt; limitation for \n&gt; tools and will have memory and performance hit as well. So, it would \n&gt; make sense to have these parameters passed to the test method \n&gt; (like it \n&gt; is done in TestNG).\n\nI think the performance problems can be solved other ways, and I still like\nencouraging test isolation by executing tests in separate instances. The\nJUnit 4 runner creates the instances immediately in advance of invoking the\ntest method. The current design requires less duplication than passing the\nparameters to the test methods, since the parameters only appear in the\nconstructor. It might be better for the @Parameters method to return an\nIterator, allowing the lazy creation of substantial data structures,\nhowever.\n  @Parameters static Iterator&lt;Object[]&gt; data() ...\n \n&gt;   Second limitation is that user don&#39;t have will have to \n&gt; declaratively \n&gt; specify test data sets without writing custom @Parameters \n&gt; method and use \n&gt; some system property to differentiate between tests. Perhaps \n&gt; you can add \n&gt; some &quot;name&quot; property to Parameters annotation, so test runner \n&gt; can match \n&gt; this name with declared test data. Such name property would \n&gt; also allow \n&gt; to have multiple @Parameters methods and match them with \n&gt; @Test methods \n&gt; if you&#39;ll have same name there too. The last would allow to \n&gt; have several \n&gt; test methods with different kinds of test parameters without creating \n&gt; separate test classes (so you&#39;ll have single test class for \n&gt; class under \n&gt; testing).\n\nI don&#39;t understand this objection. Can you write an example of what you\nwould like to see?\n\n&gt;   The last thing I&#39;d like to mention is that current \n&gt; @Parameters methods \n&gt; won&#39;t scale to large data sets (the same limitation also exists in \n&gt; TestNG). I&#39;ve seen JUnit3 suite() methods that produced thousands of \n&gt; test permutations and that required lots of memory memory \n&gt; when running \n&gt; tests. So, It think that it would make sense to introduce an \n&gt; interface \n&gt; similar to JDBC ResultSet, so test runner can create iterate \n&gt; trough test \n&gt; data without loading it completely into memory and also have \n&gt; option to \n&gt; get number of tests as well as jump to Nth test. You can also \n&gt; provide an \n&gt; adapter that will take Object[][] and provide all that \n&gt; functionality for \n&gt; users who don&#39;t want to create test data dynamically.\n\nWould the Iterator version satisfy the need to handle large data sets?\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nKent Beck\nThree Rivers Institute\n\n\n\n",
