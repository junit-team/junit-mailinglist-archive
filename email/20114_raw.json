Those\ntests will take longer to run, but on the other hand they give you\nmore freedom to refactor the code &quot;under the hood&quot; once you get it\nunder test, and they will verify that the functionality of the product\ndoesn&#39;t change over time. A risk with unit tests is that they tie down\nthe code, and for every change you want to make you have to change\nbundles of unit tests.\n\nI would go for an extensive system test suite, and unit tests for the\nmore complicated lower-level refactorings of important pieces of code.\n\nCheers\nDaniel\n\n\n\nOn Nov 19, 2007 1:58 PM, Joel Neely &lt;joel.neely@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I highly recommend _Working_Effectively_with_Legacy_Code_ by Michael\n&gt; Feathers.\n&gt;  (His definition of &quot;legacy code&quot; is simply &quot;code without tests&quot;,\n&gt;  regardless of when it\n&gt;  was written, or by whom.)\n&gt;\n&gt;  That book does an outstanding job of discussing how to get code under test.\n&gt;  The first section, &quot;The Mechanics of Change&quot;, describes goals and\n&gt; techniques\n&gt;  of unit testing, along with general strategies for getting tests\n&gt;  around code that\n&gt;  wasn&#39;t designed to be tested. The second section, &quot;Changing Software&quot;, is\n&gt;  almost a set of case studies. Each chapter addresses a specific problem of\n&gt; the\n&gt;  form, &#39;I need to ...&quot; or &quot;How do I ...&quot; with clear suggestions and\n&gt;  illustrations.\n&gt;  The third section, &quot; Dependency-Breaking Techniques&quot;, returns to the\n&gt; general\n&gt;  level and presents a catalog of tactics for breaking code down into\n&gt; testable\n&gt;  (and manageable) segments.\n&gt;\n&gt;  I sincerely believe the best thing you could do (given your questions) is\n&gt; to\n&gt;  read that book and start trying out the techniques it presents.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Good luck!\n&gt;\n&gt;  -jn-\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  On Nov 19, 2007 3:47 AM, Vladimir Chladny &lt;vladeycolder@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Hello,\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; could you suggest me some good article /resource/ about the strategy how\n&gt; to\n&gt;  &gt; add jUnit testing to a large existing JAVA project, please?\n&gt;  &gt; What is the best practice for this + some experience /e.g. typical\n&gt; problems\n&gt;  &gt; to avoid.../?\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; /I didn&#39;t find any usefull document on the internet for this topic yet./\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Thank you in advance,\n&gt;  &gt; Vladey.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; __________________________________________________________\n&gt;  &gt; Be a better pen pal.\n&gt;  &gt; Text or chat with friends inside Yahoo!
