I have been<br/>\nusing it for only one year now but in that short space of time you<br/>\nhave all helped me not only to write better tests but to also be a<br/>\nbetter developer.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow to my problem :-) I searched for a solution to this but all in<br/>\nvain. Essentially I want to execute a JUNIT test on a unix box<br/>\nremotely while connecting to the JVM using eclipse on my windows<br/>\nmachine with the intention of debugging.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow do I launch my JUNIT with a debug option on the command line? I<br/>\ndon&#39;t want to use ANT. The problem I have is that we develop on<br/>\nwindows but the application is designed to run solely on some<br/>\ndifferent flavours of unix (mostly HP-UX). <br/>\n<br/>\nAll our tests run automatically at night after the daily build but<br/>\nsometimes the tests will fail on unix and pass on windows. Ideally,<br/>\nthe solution would be to develop and test on unix but this is not<br/>\npermitted due certain limitations beyond my control.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny help would be very much appreciated. <br/>\nregards,<br/>\nDavid.</div>",
