Coul=\r\nd you elaborate?\n\n\nIt becomes very difficult to formulate expressions as so=\r\non as they are more\ncomplex than a simple equality or inequality.  It&#39;s fin=\r\ne for &quot;n &gt; 2&quot;, not so\nmuch for &quot;n &gt; 2 && n &lt; 10&quot; and it&#39;s all downhill from=\r\n there.\n\nThe Java language also cripples this attempt by not allowing you t=\r\no re-open\nexisting classes (you can&#39;t say n.greaterThan(2).and().lessThan(1=\r\n0)), so you\nare forced to put your words and verbs in a certain order that =\r\nis dictated\nby the Java syntax, and not by the developer.\n\nQuery API&#39;s suff=\r\ner from the same problem (e.g. Hibernate&#39;s Criteria API that\nturns SQL expr=\r\nessions into typed Java objects.  Nothing wrong with\nHibernate, by the way,=\r\n this is a problem that&#39;s endemic to Criteria API&#39;s in\ngeneral).  Past a ce=\r\nrtain complexity, you&#39;re just better off writing the\nexpression in terms of=\r\n boolean and numeric operators, which are very easy to\nparse for programmer=\r\ns.\n\n, and in the end, you&#39;re probably better off simply writing a\n&gt; &gt;  meth=\r\nod assertButtonIsEnabled(enabled) which, in my opinion, is the most\n&gt; &gt;  re=\r\nadable of all.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; How does that scale better?\n\n\nI didn&#39;t say it scaled=\r\n better (it scales the same), I said it&#39;s the most\nreadable form because th=\r\ne programmer is free to capture the meaning of the\nassertion in one word of=\r\n his choosing, as opposed to literate API&#39;s which,\ndespite their best effor=\r\nts, can&#39;t help introducing noise (such as the eq()\nkeyword in the example a=\r\nbove).\n\nOne of the problems with assertXxxx(String message, Object expected=\r\n,\n&gt; Object actual). Is that it is not obvious where expected and actual\n&gt; s=\r\nhould go.\n\n\nAgreed, I keep being tripped by this all the time, and I usuall=\r\ny have to\nresort to my IDE&#39;s completion capabilities to refresh my memory.\n=\r\n\nWith the precence of a descriptive message and checking\n&gt; strings for equa=\r\nlity it can become even funnier. with\n&gt; assertThat(Object actual, Expressio=\r\nn expression) you simply can&#39;t mix\n&gt; them (unless actual is also an express=\r\nion).\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ve noticed that a lot of people have issues with the asserThat\n=\r\n&gt; syntax and I have never been able to quite figure out why.\n\n\nThese are ju=\r\nst my personal objections.  I don&#39;t feel extremely strongly\nabout this, tho=\r\nugh, I just wanted to point out that literate assertions\nsolve a few proble=\r\nms and introduce a few others, so we still haven&#39;t found\nthe ultimate API s=\r\nolution.  And in the meantime, the introduction of\nbusiness-specific assert=\r\ns is the best we can do.\n\n-- \nC=E9dric\nhttp://testng.org\n\n\n[Non-text portio=\r\nns of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
