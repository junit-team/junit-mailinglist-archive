If you adopt a convention that API methods are only presented\nvia Java Interfaces instead of concrete classes then you don&#39;t care\nabout the way the implementers of the Interfaces are written. You can\nthen make non-API methods within the concrete implementation public\nwithout implying that they are themselves API methods. \n\nYou would also write your API tests for the Java Interfaces and plug in\nthe concrete implementations to test them. If you need to write tests\nfor lower-level supporting methods within the concrete classes you can\ndo that separately, as appropriate and its easy because they are public.\n\n\n-----------------------------\nMike Silverstein\nSilverMark, Inc.\nThe Object Testing Company\nwww.javatesting.com\n\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Chirag Shashikant Doshi [mailto:chirag.doshi@...] \n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, October 15, 2003 11:02 PM\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: RE: [junit] Re: How to test private methods, its urgent\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Hi Michael\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Personally, I don&#39;t believe in private methods.

Therefore well \n&gt; tested public \n&gt; &gt; methods will include the behaviour of the private methods.  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; There is no real reason for directly testing private methods.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Domain objects support the GUI. By the logic above a well \n&gt; tested GUI will include the behavior of the domain objects, \n&gt; so there is no reason to unit test the domain objects :-)\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve occasionally found reason to write unit tests for \n&gt; private, supporting methods. Often you loose efficiency \n&gt; testing supporting methods indirectly via their caller - such \n&gt; as in the case where you want to test their ability to \n&gt; properly handle a range of input values. \n&gt; \n&gt; Personally, I don&#39;t believe in private methods. I&#39;d rather \n&gt; make everything public and testable and expose real APIs via \n&gt; Java Interfaces.\n&gt; \n&gt; To answer the original poster: google junit + &quot;private methods&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n\n---\nOutgoing mail is certified Virus Free.\nChecked by AVG anti-virus system (http://www.grisoft.com).\nVersion: 6.0.522 / Virus Database: 320 - Release Date: 9/29/2003\n \n\n\n",
