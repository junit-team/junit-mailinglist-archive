My code <br/>\ncompiles but throws resource exceptions when it tries to (for <br/>\nexample) create a database. I presume this is because the MIDP <br/>\nclasses call native functions and the emulator has some reference to <br/>\na dll somewhere that the test classes aren&#39;t aware of.<br/>\n<br/>\nHas anyone got much experience with this ? Any solutions ?</div>",
