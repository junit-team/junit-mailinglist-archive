Turns\nout our embedded SQL statement had a mixture of case for table and column\nnames. This case mixture wasn&#39;t a problem on windows, but is on linux.\n\nSo, we moved the sql statements to a resource bundle, changing and unifying\ntheir cases along the way.\n\nMy point (and there is one honestly ) is that if all of the SQL was in the\nresource file in the first place, then its less likely (I feel) that people\nwould of mixed the cases used within the statements.\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Strebel, Dr. Oliver [mailto:Oliver.Strebel@...]\nSent: 07 February 2003 14:17\nTo: &#39;junit@yahoogroups.com&#39;\nSubject: RE: [junit] Programmer Tests and the Database\n\n\n&gt; On Thu, 6 Feb 2003, J. B. Rainsberger wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Pushing every SQL statement you use out to a ResourceBundle (or other\n&gt;&gt; metadata file) is a good idea.\n&gt;\n&gt; Eww! I know this tends to be a bit of a personal preference, but I far\n&gt; prefer to keep my code together when I can. If a statement is used in\n&gt; only one place, keeping it where it&#39;s used makes the code much easier to\n&gt; read, because you don&#39;t have to go chasing off into some other file to\n&gt; find out what SQL statement is being executed.\n&gt;\n\nRobert Koss wrote:\nThat&#39;s probably true if the SQL never has to change. If the schema changes,\nI find it more convenient to go to one known place instead of having to\nsearch my entire app for possible changes.\n\nMy opinion:\nThis is a quite convenient and,\naccording to my experience, effective\napproach for dealing with schema evolution.\n\nOn the other hand it really hampers development.\nBut there is also a compromise between\nthe two positions:\nLayer the classes that access the database by\nputting all the SQL generation into an inner class.\n\npublic class UsingSQL\n{\n\tprivate m_SQL = new SQL();\n\n\tpublic void usesSQL()\n\t{\n\t\t//some processing\n\t\tm_Statement.execute( m_SQL.selectEmployees() );\n\t\t//some more processing\n\t}\n\n\tprivate class SQL\n\t{\n\t\tString selectEmployees()\n\t\t{\n\t\t\treturn &quot;select * from emp&quot;;\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n\nSo you have all the SQL in place, but it is only limited to a certain\narea of your code and doesn&#39;t litter the entire class.\nMoreover this is a quite convenient way of generating dynamic SQL.\nIf one adheres to a naming convention for the inner\nclass (SQL), such classes can be found easily in case of schema evolution.\n\nJust my 2 cents\n\nDr. Oliver Strebel\n\nCC RCO TC\nJ�rgen Ponto Platz 1\n21.
