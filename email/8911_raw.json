(If some test for the lower layers failed the t=\r\nest\nfor higher layers failed also). But this need faded away and\ndid not ap=\r\npear again, so I forgot about it.\n\nI only followed your discussion roughly,=\r\n but I guess my need \nfor test hierarchies disappeared because my unit test=\r\ns \nare independent from each other. \n\nThis is your example from another mai=\r\nl from you:\n&gt; Ok, another example. I have a class that walks a classpath an=\r\nd generates\n&gt; listener events on things found, I test that. I have a class =\r\nthat listens\nto\n&gt; such events to &quot;find&quot; things that match a certain criteri=\r\non, I test that.\nIf\n&gt; the first class fails to send events, then I ought no=\r\nt blame (or dig into)\n&gt; the second for not finding anything. The tests are =\r\n(I believe) unit tests\nof\n&gt; each, without duplication.\n\nHow would you blame=\r\n the second for not finding anything?\nDo you run this as one or two tests?\n=\r\n\nThe first test could be: are the expected events thrown for\na given classp=\r\nath? Do not use the second class in this test.\n(I guess you have some liste=\r\nner interface: have the test-class\nimplement this listener interface: &quot;self=\r\n-shunt&quot;)\n\nThe second test could be: does the second class react correctly o=\r\nn a given\nevent?\nIn this test the event(s) is/are created by the test code =\r\nand not by the\nfirst class: Do not use the first class to create events in =\r\nthis test.\n\nYou do not have test code duplication here but you can run thee=\r\nse test\nindependently.\n\nBernd\n\n\n\n",
