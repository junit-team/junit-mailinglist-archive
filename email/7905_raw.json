Is the expectation that the error me=\r\nssage should give all \n&gt;the information necessary to identify the bug?\n&gt;\n&gt;O=\r\nr is it expected that the developer have knowledege of (or discover) \n&gt;what=\r\n the test is doing? or run the test in debug mode? or other?\n\nIn my experie=\r\nnce, it depends. Some defects are easy to diagnose. Some are instances of u=\r\nser error.\n\nIf you have Programmer Test coverage and QA still finds defects=\r\n, then the programmers aren&#39;t using QA&#39;s tests, and they probably should. Q=\r\nA is automating the tests, right? (I hope so.)\n\nIf QA raises a defect, I as=\r\nk the finder to work with me to reproduce it. I then isolate the cause, wri=\r\nte the appropriate missing Programmer Tests, fix the problem and off we go.=\r\n\n\n&gt;We are testing methods that take xml Strings as parameters and return \n&gt;=\r\nxml. It would be nice to see what was passed in and what was returned \n&gt;if =\r\nanything .. even when something like a NullPointerException is \n&gt;failing th=\r\ne test. Also we are running the tests in different \n&gt;environments so a deve=\r\nloper may not see the same error if they run \n&gt;the test in the development =\r\nenvironment.\n\nThis is not really a testing consideration. It&#39;s a logging co=\r\nnsideration, and logging is important in enterprise-scale applications wher=\r\ne it is usually impossible to run your tests at the client site. I would lo=\r\ng information at the key handoff points between components. Within a compon=\r\nent, there should be tests. Presumably you only need to know that XML strin=\r\ngs are coming into a component because you fear that they are not what the =\r\ntarget component expects. Consider using XML schema here to avoid the prob =\r\nlem.\n\n&gt;Is a separate logging mechanism the answer?\n\nIt is, by the sound of =\r\nit.\n\n\n\n\n",
