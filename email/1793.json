The only <br/>\n    &gt; reason I can think of is<br/>\n    &gt; if your application had the ability to run built-in <br/>\n    &gt; diagnostics that were<br/>\n    &gt; included in order to help track down faults due to unanticipated<br/>\n    &gt; environmental conditions. Other than that, test cases are <br/>\n    &gt; just dead code as<br/>\n    &gt; far as an end-user is concerned.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Agreed.
