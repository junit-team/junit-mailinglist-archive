In the same lines, we have to prepare an interview for Unit Testing. (Java Related)\nI would appreciate it, if you would send me your Java Unit Testing Queries, so that I can prepare an interview format.\n\nI understand, that this is not what this discussion group is meant for. However, many of us have queries, which might be answered best by Senior Industry Leaders.\n\nFull credit to this Discussion group will be given for the questions.\n\nHoping for a speedy reply from all of you.\n\nThanks and regards\nGaurav Pandey\nGaurav@...\nwww.WhatIsTesting.com - A Tester&#39;s Paradise.\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n",
