I am a user of JUnit and project contributor in github.\n\nI am glad to s=\r\nay that we extended Categories with new feature in pull request https://git=\r\nhub.com/KentBeck/junit/pull/503\nThis extension is not yet in KentBeck repo,=\r\n however the implementation and tests are ready.\n\nIn JUnit we got a consens=\r\nus of anotations design and behavior, but we do not have consensus in javad=\r\noc for Categories class.\n\nWe would like to ask you to have a look and help =\r\nus refine the Javadoc, which finally would help to all users of JUnit.\n\nOur=\r\n main goal is to declare many inclusive/exclusive categories on the top of =\r\na test suite, unlike the old Categories.java runner which used just only on=\r\ne category.\n\nThere is Maven community with surefire-plugin, which may use t=\r\nhis extension known as groups -currently they only use a single group.\n\nNot=\r\ne: you&#39;r welcome to login to www.github.com and contribute to the pull #503=\r\n i mentioned above.\n\nThx, Tibor\n\n\n",
