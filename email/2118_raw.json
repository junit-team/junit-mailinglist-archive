If the Comparator argument is null the\n    &gt; compareTo() on the elements is called.\n    &gt; \n    &gt; I am not sure what use an assertGreaterThan( Collection, \n    &gt; Collection)\n    &gt; makes much sense.   In mathematics it&#39;s not possible to \n    &gt; say one vector\n    &gt; is greater than another, unless they are projected onto a \n    &gt; given axis.\n    &gt; This is not really possible on your average collection of objects.\n    &gt; \n    &gt; I think the only two useful cases are...\n    &gt; \n    &gt; assertEquals(Collection, Collection);\n    &gt; assertEquals(Collection, Collection, Comparator );\n    &gt; \n    &gt; Passing in a null Comparator to the second method would \n    &gt; behave like when\n    &gt; passing a Comparator to a sorted set, equals() method (or \n    &gt; compareTo())\n    &gt; would be called on the elements.  \n    &gt; \n    &gt; \n    &gt; Dave\n    &gt; \n    &gt; \n    &gt; -----Original Message-----\n    &gt; From: Jason Rogers [mailto:jason.rogers@...]\n    &gt; Sent: 25 July 2001 19:29\n    &gt; To: &#39;junit@yahoogroups.com&#39;\n    &gt; Subject: RE: [junit] Reporting more then 1 failed \n    &gt; assertion per test\n    &gt; \n    &gt; \n    &gt; You are right.  And as I recall, we have tested for that \n    &gt; case in our\n    &gt; code as\n    &gt; well.  How would the framework know when to use a \n    &gt; comparator or not?\n    &gt; Have\n    &gt; something like the following?  Seems quirky... but this \n    &gt; is what working\n    &gt; on 4\n    &gt; hours of sleep can do :)\n    &gt; \n    &gt; assertEquals(expectedCollection, actualCollection)\n    &gt; assertComparesGreaterThanZero(expectedCollection, \n    &gt; actualCollection)\n    &gt; assertComparesLessThanZero(expectedCollection, actualCollection)\n    &gt; assertComparesZero(expectedCollection, actualCollection)\n    &gt; \n    &gt; -Jason\n    &gt; \n    &gt;     &gt; -----Original Message-----\n    &gt;     &gt; From: Vladimir Bossicard [mailto:vladimir@...]\n    &gt;     &gt; Sent: Wednesday, July 25, 2001 12:36 PM\n    &gt;     &gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n    &gt;     &gt; Subject: Re: [junit] Reporting more then 1 failed \n    &gt;     &gt; assertion per test\n    &gt;     &gt; \n    &gt;     &gt; \n    &gt;     &gt; &gt;\n    &gt;     &gt; &gt;\n    &gt;     &gt; &gt;How would this complete list help you any more than the \n    &gt;     &gt; simple fact that the\n    &gt;     &gt; &gt;arrays were not of the same length?  Given that I \n    &gt;     &gt; expected them to contain\n    &gt;     &gt; &gt;the same number of elements, the most valuable \n    &gt;     &gt; information to me would be\n    &gt;     &gt; &gt;that they were of different lengths, not which elements \n    &gt;     &gt; were/were not\n    &gt;     &gt; &gt;present.\n    &gt;     &gt; &gt;\n    &gt;     &gt; I partially don&#39;t agree.  I think that comparing vectors \n    &gt;     &gt; should tell you \n    &gt;     &gt; if the elements are equals.  If your testing a sort \n    &gt;     &gt; algorythm, you want \n    &gt;     &gt; to know if elements of the result vector are in the right \n    &gt;     &gt; position. \n    &gt;     &gt;  This request (assertEquals do array properly) has been \n    &gt;     &gt; expressed by \n    &gt;     &gt; many people and I think that it should be included in JUnit.\n    &gt;     &gt; \n    &gt;     &gt; But I&#39;m against the &quot;soft warning&quot; idea.  Don&#39;t see the \n    &gt;     &gt; added value there.\n    &gt;     &gt; \n    &gt;     &gt; -Vladimir\n    &gt;     &gt; \n    &gt;     &gt; \n    &gt;     &gt; \n    &gt;     &gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
