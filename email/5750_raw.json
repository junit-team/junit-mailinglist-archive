I&#39;m not trying to bait you=\r\n, but if you have a automated code testing tool (let&#39;s be generic here, so =\r\nno-one thinks that I&#39;m on the ParaSoft payroll :-) and it complains about y=\r\nour code then either the tool is defective or your code is sub-optimal.\n\n&gt;H=\r\nere is another way of putting it:\n&gt;Personally I think that the &#39;exposure&#39; o=\r\nf (mainly) NullPointers by\n&gt;applying generated tests that put nonsense para=\r\nmeter values in methods\n&gt;does improve the quality of the product.\n\nAgreed. =\r\n:-)\n\n&gt;The motto &#39;Garbage in Garbage out&#39; still applies in this case. As an\n=\r\n\nNot agreed. GIGO is only for non-robust code. I think that &quot;Garbage In&quot; sh=\r\nould cause appropriate guard conditions to be triggered and an appropriate =\r\nresponse to be generated NPE or IAE (your choice). For anything other than =\r\nthe most trivial of code, I do not want to ever contribute to &quot;Garbage Out&quot;=\r\n. As developers we usually have no control over the many potential ways tha=\r\nt our code could be used, but we do have control over how it responds.\n\n&gt;an=\r\nalogy you might say that the software application is like a car\n&gt;exposing c=\r\nertain interfaces that must be handled in a specific way.\n&gt;If you bypass th=\r\nese interfaces you can get unexpected results, no\n&gt;sensible car testing aut=\r\nhority would put a burning piece of cloth into\n&gt;the gastank and would repor=\r\nt the following explosing a &#39;serious\n&gt;defect&#39; found through a dynamic test.=\r\n\n\nActually, I&#39;m sure that contingency is addressed by the automotive indust=\r\nry. Now bringing fire near any body of petrol is bad, but there are ways to=\r\n reduce the likelihood of a bad thing. Baffles in the tube leading to the p=\r\netrol tank are an example of trying to provide hardware guard conditions.\n\n=\r\n&gt;I do not want to resolve all &#39;dubious&#39; runtime exceptions reported by\n&gt;JTe=\r\nst ! \n\nAny decent tool should allow you to turn off inappropriate tests.\n\n&gt;=\r\nIf you are working in life threatening devices using Java such as\n&gt;Simon yo=\r\nu might need this JTest behaviour but I think 99% of all Java\n&gt;developers w=\r\nork on non life threatening applications\n&gt;(except when you are running behi=\r\nnd schedule and your boss want&#39;s your\n&gt;head on a silver plate :))\n\nFortunat=\r\nely, I don&#39;t work with anything too dangerous these days. I used to work in=\r\n a Radiography department, so I am aware of the issues there. The project t=\r\nhat I am winding up now is not life threatening, but because of volume, it =\r\ndoes need to be very fast and very accurate or the CEO will be asking why i=\r\nt is failing to process about 2000 shipments an hour! (Not a conversation t=\r\nhat I ever want to have!) I still think that it&#39;s appropriate to &quot;harden&quot; o=\r\nur code to handle the unexpected.\n\nThis is the concept of &quot;graceful degreda=\r\ntion&quot;. A web browser is a very good example of this .... a lot of web pages=\r\n have awful HTML and yet most of them display acceptably, because the brows=\r\ner takes what it&#39;s given and does the best it can with it. A browser cannot=\r\n throw an exception, but it can try to render what it&#39;s given. All software=\r\n should do the best it can with what it&#39;s given or when possible reject una=\r\ncceptable inputs.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;greetings\n&gt;Arie Roy (my boss just came in and gave me=\r\n a smile and an apple ?)\n\nSimon\n\n------------------------------------------=\r\n-----------------------\nSimon P.
