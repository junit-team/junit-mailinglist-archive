With annotations you don&#39;t need\n|&gt; &gt; to inherit from a framework (jUnit) class.  You simply annotate the\n|&gt; &gt; class and it becomes a TestCase.  This means you don&#39;t need to break\n|&gt; &gt; out your tests into separate classes (though one is still free to do\n|&gt; &gt; so).\n|&gt;\n|&gt; I&#39;m biased, being a JUnit user, but I don&#39;t like the idea of tests\n|&gt; living in with the class under test. My objection is that it implicitly\n|&gt; encourages a testing style with which I disagree: that there is a 1:1\n|&gt; correspondence between fixtures and classes under test.\n|&gt;\n|&gt; I do admit that in those cases where the 1:1 correspondence holds, it\n|&gt; might be better to put tests and production code together, but I\n| usually\n|&gt; have a large number of small test methods, and I feel like that would\n|&gt; pollute my production code.\n|&gt;\n|&gt; ...or did you mean something else entirely? :)\n|&gt; --\n|\n| I think I meant the more general case of just not being bound to\n| inherit from a jUnit framework class.  That&#39;s the main point.  Since\n| Java is single inheritance there are times when you want to have your\n| test live in some framework (say testing in J2EE) and having to\n| inherit from the jUnit class becomes an obstacle to testing in some of\n| those cases.  (There are other obstacles too, of course.)  So I meant\n| the benefits of decoupling.  The framework can run tests and still be\n| automatic without imposing any requirements on the hierarchy of the\n| test classes.\n\nThis may sound as an adverstise, but it is not. We have addresed in TestNG (http://beust.com/testng)\na set of - in our opinion :-) -  missing features or limitations of JUnit, this mandatory\ninheritance being one of them.\n\n- --\n:pope\n[the_mindstorm]\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: GnuPG v1.4.0 (MingW32)\n\niD8DBQFB+0afTTDTje0R2dgRAgl4AJ95LrSG0dmMmZVvcMYr2Ni7wMrLmwCfQrrx\nFSHAboxCUNQeTR+zMEBWgFo=\n=mIX2\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n",
