I have a TestSuite that takes the name of a script as a<br/>\n&gt; parameter. That script contains a series of request/response pairs. I<br/>\n&gt; dynamically generate a test case for each line in the file and add it<br/>\n&gt; to the TestSuite. The name of the TestSuite is the name of the script<br/>\n&gt; file so I can distinguish between runs.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I run this insisde Eclipse and the TestSuite&#39;s name is correct (i.e.<br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s the name of the script) but when I run it using ant with an XML<br/>\n&gt; formatter, the name of the test is the name of the class.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It looks like the XML formatter is making an assumption about the <br/>\nTestSuite name. I&#39;m not sure what to do about that, short of looking at <br/>\nthe source and deciding it&#39;s incorrect. I think that, objectively <br/>\nspeaking, a TestSuite should be named by its name property, and not <br/>\nnecessarily its class name.<br/>\n<br/>\nLook at the Ant task source and see what you can find out. I doubt it <br/>\nwould be a difficult fix. TestSuite has a method to return the name, so <br/>\nperhaps the XML formatter is not invoking it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; For the time being I&#39;m going to create a second TestSuite under the<br/>\n&gt; main test suite and give it the correct name since all the children of<br/>\n&gt; the original have synthetic names and show up find in the generated XML.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Is this a known issue? Better workarounds than what i&#39;ve mentioned above?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve never run into it before. I don&#39;t name test suites very often, and <br/>\nI&#39;ve been working mostly in Eclipse for the past two years. :)<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
