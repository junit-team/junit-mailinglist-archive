[...]</font>\n<br><font SIZE=\"2\">&gt;</font>\n<br><font SIZE=\"2\">&gt;In retrospect, I can come up with a characterization of the problem</font>\n<br><font SIZE=\"2\">&gt;and say that I made certain assumptions about the behavior of the</font>\n<br><font SIZE=\"2\">&gt;sockets API.&nbsp; Given that was the case, it would have been prudent of</font>\n<br><font SIZE=\"2\">&gt;me to write (very simple) test cases that verify those assumptions,</font>\n<br><font SIZE=\"2\">&gt;and run them on both plain and SSL sockets.&nbsp; These tests, of course,</font>\n<br><font SIZE=\"2\">&gt;would be very simple, and wouldn&#39;t involve any of my product code.</font>\n<br><font SIZE=\"2\">&gt;</font>\n<br><font SIZE=\"2\">&gt;Presumably if I tested the assumptions correctly in both cases, then I</font>\n<br><font SIZE=\"2\">&gt;wouldn&#39;t have to test my code in both of its configurations (since</font>\n<br><font SIZE=\"2\">&gt;from its point of view it&#39;s not really doing anything different in the</font>\n<br><font SIZE=\"2\">&gt;two different cases).</font>\n<br><font SIZE=\"2\">&gt;</font>\n<br><font SIZE=\"2\">&gt;Is this another form of testing (&quot;Assumption Testing&quot;)?&nbsp; Or perhaps</font>\n<br><font SIZE=\"2\">&gt;another way to look at it is that I&#39;m a &quot;customer&quot; of the SSL library</font>\n<br><font SIZE=\"2\">&gt;provider, and I need to have my own &quot;Acceptance Test&quot; of the</font>\n<br><font SIZE=\"2\">&gt;functionality that I expect it to provide?</font>\n</p>\n\n<p><font SIZE=\"2\">Your tests of a third-party API are your acceptance tests of that API. If you give them to the maker of the API, they can be their unit tests or their acceptance tests.</font></p>\n\n<p><font SIZE=\"2\">I have found testing a third-party library to be extremely valuable... Whenever you get a new version of that third-party library, you can run all your tests to see if the library makers have fixed known bugs, created new bugs, or changed assumptions....</font></p>\n\n<p><font SIZE=\"2\">Once you are confident of the third-party library&#39;s functionality, you could choose to use Mock objects in the production code unit tests, or continue to use the actual library objects. </font></p>\n\n \n</html></div>",
