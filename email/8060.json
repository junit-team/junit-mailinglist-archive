Except that I&#39;m able to do this:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 1. Instantiate an object.<br/>\n&gt; 2. Initialize the object with known values.<br/>\n&gt; 3. Serialize the object.<br/>\n&gt; 4. Load object into another variable.<br/>\n&gt; 5. assertEquals on 2 objects.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes.  That&#39;s what I thought.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I have implemented equals methods on my classes so if they are not <br/>\n&gt; equal (not the same, but equal). In fact, I do some tests on my <br/>\n&gt; equals functions by taking 2 objects that should be equal, and also <br/>\n&gt; comparing 2 objects that are not. I also verify that they are not <br/>\n&gt; the same objects (i.e. obj1 == obj2)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Have a look at the Gargoyle extensions that Mike Bowler has written: <br/>\n<br/>\nhttp://gsbase.sourceforge.net/<br/>\n<br/>\nPart of it is EqualsTester which does a comprehensive verification of<br/>\na class&#39;s equals() and hashCode() methods.  It saves alot of test code.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; I advise a separate test for each (&quot;advise&quot; because you don&#39;t work <br/>\n&gt; &gt; for me.. if you did, I&#39;d &quot;insist&quot;).  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; And that&#39;s why I&#39;m here. Trying to learn. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>:)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; In fact, I just got hired by this company and they don&#39;t do ANY <br/>\n&gt; testing... I&#39;m trying to move them forward in this, so I appreciate <br/>\n&gt; the tips.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Are they interested in improving that?  <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;This message contains commercial content, reader disgression is advised&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe some training is in order?   see www.adaptionsoft.com (we are<br/>\none of several compainies that could help with this)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll be teaching TDD tutorials at various conferences this year (see <br/>\nhttp://www.adaptionsoft.com/conferences.htm<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, watch for my book in July: http://www.adaptionsoft.com/tddapg.htm<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;/commercial content&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;ll look into Mocks. I&#39;ve read a little about them, but I&#39;m trying <br/>\n&gt; to take baby steps...<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>They can take a bit of effort to grok... but they are a very powerful<br/>\ntesting tool.  I suggest EasyMock (www.easymock.org) as well as<br/>\nMockObjects (http://www.mockobjects.com)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; My main concern is that the functionality involved serializing to a <br/>\n&gt; file, so I thought I&#39;d need to exercise that in a test (i.e., saving <br/>\n&gt; to a known location, then making sure it loads from the same known <br/>\n&gt; location, etc).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>1) I&#39;d consider that more of an integration level test (which needs to<br/>\nbe done, but not as part of TDD)<br/>\n2) when TDDing you should try to avoid using external resources as<br/>\nmuch as possible<br/>\n3) use createTempFile.. see<br/>\nhttp://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.1/docs/api/java/io/File.html#createTempFile(java.lang.String,%20java.lang.String)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The output is binary, and I&#39;m working with streams all the way until <br/>\n&gt; I actually write the file.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>A mock file or mock stream could be programmed to expect a specific<br/>\nsequence of bytes.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Thanks again for your tips<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My pleasure<br/>\n<br/>\nDave</div>",
