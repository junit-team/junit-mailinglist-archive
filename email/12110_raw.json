My\n&gt; concern is that I can&#39;t figure out a good way to write these tests\n&gt; without relying on other DAO methods.\n\nDon&#39;t worry about this. As long as you test some methods on their own, \nfeel free to use those (tested) methods to test others, especially if \nit&#39;s costly to avoid doing it.\n\nThink of testing List.add() and List.contains(). You can&#39;t invoke \ncontains() without having invoked add(), but that doesn&#39;t make it &quot;bad \nform&quot; to use add() to test contains(); or even to use contains() to test \nadd()!\n\n&gt; I&#39;ve looked at DBUnit.  The problem here is that I still have to\n&gt; populate my bean from the database - then I&#39;m back to calling a DAO\n&gt; method like getEmployeeById in every method - an undesirable\n&gt; dependency.  Another option I guess would be to have some DAO\n&gt; methods used only for testing but this seems overkill.  I&#39;d rather\n&gt; use the database during testing too, not mock objects.\n\nAnother option is to test using the back door: to test createEmployee(), \nuse raw JDBC and a SELECT statement to ensure that the record is \nactually there.\n\nThat said, why would you rather use the database? Are you concerned that \nyour JDBC driver doesn&#39;t work?\n\n&gt; So, I guess my questions are:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1.)Is there a good way to test DAOs in isolation, without relying on\n&gt; other DAO methods?\n\nYes: use the back door (raw JDBC) to make assertions about database \nstate at the end of the test.\n\n&gt; 2.)Does it really matter that much anyway if I use other DAO\n&gt; methods?  I mean, the goal is for ALL tests to pass anyway.  It can\n&gt; be confusing if your testDeleteEmployee method fails due to a\n&gt; failure in createEmployee which you have to call first, but I guess\n&gt; it wouldn&#39;t take long to figure out what really happened.\n\nYou could try this and observe the problems. I don&#39;t think there are \nmany when the problem is small, but over time, testing your DAO against \na real database becomes increasingly risky. Chapter 10 of _JUnit \nRecipes_ describes this in detail.\n\nTake care.\n-- \nJ. B.
