Is anybody\n&gt; &gt;else is doing this and how they are implementing DBC (iContract? JASS? or\n&gt; &gt;merely at a documentation level?)\n&gt;\n&gt; Test-Driven Development drives a programmer towards DBC on a test-by-test\n&gt; basis. As a result, although I don&#39;t use DBC tools, I believe I&#39;m doing DBC\n&gt;\n&gt; by simply writing the tests first. In a way, JUnit is my DBC tool.\n&gt;\n&gt; J. B. Rainsberger\n\nexactly!  And you don&#39;t have any run-time issues or complex build\nprocesses sitting around.  I tend to keep pre-condition checks in\nmy code, but my tests check for post conditions as well.  Checking\nfor a failed post-condition at run-time in a production system\nis not usually what you want anyways, since that means you are\nin an undefined state if it fails anyways.  Let the unit tests\nfind the post-condition failures for you *before* the code is\nshipped.\n\n-- \nJohn Goodsen           RADSoft / Rapid Software Delivery Specialists\njgoodsen@...             eXtreme Java Internet Consultants\nhttp://www.radsoft.com           Toll Free: 866-RADSOFT (723-7638)\n\n",
