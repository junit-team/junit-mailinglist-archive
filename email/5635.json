Just wanted to mention that <br/>\non the current project I&#39;m working on we just passed the 1000 test <br/>\nmark. :)  The tests take about two or three minutes to run, but <br/>\nthat&#39;s because we haven&#39;t gone back to refactor some of the tests <br/>\nthat are still nailing the database instead of using mocks or <br/>\nsomething.  Back when we were at the 400-500 mark, tests took almost <br/>\nsix minutes.  I went in, found the three tests that took the most <br/>\ntime, and changed them to use MockObjects...which reduced the time to <br/>\nrun considerably.<br/>\n<br/>\nI figure we&#39;ll probably hit the 2K mark before we&#39;re finished with <br/>\nthe initial project, and add even more tests when we go in and do <br/>\nsome major cleaning up.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-Eric</div>",
