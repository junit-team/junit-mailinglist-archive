In the past, although\n&gt; under-documented, the polic=\r\ny has been that the order in which test\n&gt; methods within a test class are r=\r\nun is undefined. In practice, it has\n&gt; been left to the JDK implementation,=\r\n which has usually ended up\n&gt; meaning the tests are run in bytecode order, =\r\nand almost always been a\n&gt; stable ordering.\n&gt;\n&gt; JDK 7 (and, I believe, upco=\r\nming releases of JDK 6) changes this, by\n&gt; having the methods returned from=\r\n reflective queries in essentially\n&gt; random order.\n&gt;\n&gt; It will always be my=\r\n belief that proper use of JUnit results in test\n&gt; methods whose passing or=\r\n failure does not depend on ordering. That\n&gt; said, it can be very frustrati=\r\nng to have a test break because the JDK\n&gt; selected a particular random orde=\r\nring, and then have little or no tool\n&gt; support in recreating the order tha=\r\nt triggers the failure.\n&gt;\n&gt; So, accepting this patch will mean that the ord=\r\nering of methods will\n&gt; no longer change from run to run, even if you chang=\r\ne or upgrade JDKs.\n&gt; Unfortunately, it may change the ordering once--if we =\r\nput this change\n&gt; into 4.11, say, then teams using current versions of JDK =\r\n6 that\n&gt; upgrade from 4.10 to 4.11 may find their tests now running in a\n&gt; =\r\ndifferent stable ordering than before. I think this is a small price\n&gt; as a=\r\n one-time cost.\n&gt;\n&gt; More disconcerting to me would be if I started seeing t=\r\nest cases with\n&gt; method names like aaaRunMeFirst.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thoughts?\n&gt;\n&gt; David S=\r\naff\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n\n-- \nsimonpeter.org | simonpeter.com | newlife-upc.org\n\n\n[Non-t=\r\next portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
