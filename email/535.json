I also wrote simple example, showing the usage of assertFile<br/>\nfunctions.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I needed more than just comparion of two files, I didn&#39;t think about the<br/>\nsimple<br/>\nassertFile(&quot;file1&quot;, :file2&quot;) function, but definitly it belongs there (and<br/>\nnow I added it).<br/>\nSo, please take updated version of this extension from appended ZIP archive,<br/>\ntry<br/>\nexample (its usage is described in readme.html) and/or read more info from<br/>\nJavaDocs.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe you will find some kinds of assertFile functions needless, I would like<br/>\nto<br/>\ndiscuss it in wider audience, because I think that file-diff capability<br/>\nsignificantly<br/>\nimproves the JUnit framework.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso I would like to find better diff implementations written in Java, which<br/>\nwill produce<br/>\nresults in human readable form. The SimpleDiff doesn&#39;t produce output at all<br/>\nand the<br/>\nNativeDiff relies on the native application.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny other comments are more than welcomed.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you,<br/>\nVita<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:faith@jsheet.com\">faith@jsheet.com</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Vitezslav,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thank-you for the JUnit file-diff extension.  The capability is<br/>\n&gt; exactly what I need.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am having a bit of a problem implementing it. If you could give me<br/>\n&gt; an short example, I would appreciate it. Here is an outline of what I<br/>\n&gt; have tried so far.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In the original post you requested an assert that would take two file<br/>\n&gt; names and return a boolean. So, before reading .java files, I tried<br/>\n&gt; the following and was told that there were not enough arguments:<br/>\n&gt; assertFile(&quot;file1&quot;, &quot;file2&quot;);<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Then being stubborn I tried:<br/>\n&gt; assertFile(&quot;file1&quot;, &quot;file2&quot;, null);<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This ran fine, however, file1 and file2 did not exist.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If you could provide an example of the diff parameter that needs to<br/>\n&gt; be passed, I would appreciate it. The html mentioned a<br/>\n&gt; junit.diff.SimpleDiff.  I would like to use this.  However, I cannot<br/>\n&gt; find it in the package.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Once again, I would like to say that this is an excellent idea.  It<br/>\n&gt; would be nice to see the documentation expanded.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Faith<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
