I could think of many cases where a user would want to state<br/>\nsuch a thing, but your example (one I finally used in e-mails that I sent<br/>\nyesterday but didn&#39;t get published yet, odd odd) is a good/clear one. &quot;quick<br/>\nway to say&quot; is what I am looking for.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the trouble with &quot;test run dependency&quot; is that there is an<br/>\nuncertainty on if the test *will fail* or not, and an uncertainty on if<br/>\nrunning the test &quot;helps debug the overall problem by showing more symptoms&quot;<br/>\nor not. That said, I think a simple/quick/optional way to allow users to<br/>\nexpress this lets that be a user choice.<br/>\n<br/>\nregards,<br/>\n<br/>\nAdam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
