(And it is often easier to read.)<br/>\n<br/>\nJB: You assume someone doing the tests careful but assume on the other <br/>\nhand JavaDoc to be (usually) crap? I would not trust in the tests if <br/>\nthe JavaDoc was bad in the first case. And even if both were ok I would <br/>\nnot conclude from the absence of a test case that what would be tested <br/>\nis undefined behaviour -- it is way too easy to miss a test case / <br/>\nspecial condition / parameter combination.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobert</div>",
