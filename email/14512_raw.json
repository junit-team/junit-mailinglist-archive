I&#39;d say that if 60% of\n&gt; your logic is in private methods, then chances are very high that\n&gt; this is true for that code.\n&gt; \n&gt; Michael Feathers\n&gt; www.objectmentor.com\n\nI&#39;m not sure where the statistical cut-off point would be. I&#39;ll have\nto take your word for it that if 60% (or more) of the code in a class\nis private implementation then there is reason for suspicion. I know\nthat if you just count LOC in some of my code that the private\nimplementation percentage will likely be high. The reason for this, I\nthink, is that I tend to refactor agressively, extracting methods\nwhenever I can give even a code fragment (like the test of an if) a\ngood intention-revealing name.\n\nHas anyone suggested the use of code coverage metrics as a way to\nquell the gotta-testa-private syndrome? When practicing TDD I have\nfound that private methods really only arise from refactoring of less\nrestrictively scoped methods. Since extracting a method is really just\nmoving code within the class, if the code had 100% coverage before the\ntest it should still have 100% coverage after the test. Are any of the\nopen source / free code coverage tools particularly worth\nrecommending?\n\thttp://java-source.net/open-source/code-coverage\n\t\nJim\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
