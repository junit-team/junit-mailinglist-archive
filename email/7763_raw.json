This contradicts with the idea that each test case should be\nindependent. On the other hand the test cases are easy to write and I&#39;m happy\nwith the result. I wonder if there is any convincing reason to write a complex\ntest case just so it can be totally independently from the others.\n\nWai Yip Tung\n\n\n\n\n\n--- javainsel &lt;javainsel@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; We want to test the creation, update and deletion of an object which \n&gt; is persisted in database.\n&gt; \n&gt; What we now do is to have three test methods for this.\n&gt; \n&gt; In the testCreate method the object is created, checked that he is \n&gt; really created and then it is deleted (we have delete because \n&gt; unfortunately we don&#39;t use Mock Objects).\n&gt; \n&gt; In the testUpdate method we create the object, update it, test the \n&gt; update result and delete the created object.\n&gt; \n&gt; In the testDelete method we create the object so that we can test \n&gt; the deletion of it.\n&gt; \n&gt; As you see, everything is included in the testUpdate method. We \n&gt; duplicate much code in the other two test methods.\n&gt; \n&gt; We write such tests for every domain object so I wonder if we should \n&gt; improve our test class.\n&gt; \n&gt; Would you write 3 or just 1 test method for that example?\n&gt; \n&gt; And would you try to convince senior coworkers who know little about \n&gt; JUnit and dislike TDD?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
