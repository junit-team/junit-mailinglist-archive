It&#39;s likely that any problems you encounter \n    &gt; will have already\n    &gt; been encountered (and solved) by other people and the \n    &gt; answers will be in\n    &gt; these archives. That&#39;s certainly been my experience.\n    &gt; \n    &gt; We also started using JUnit recently, but I didn&#39;t have \n    &gt; to do much in the\n    &gt; way of formal documentation to convince management to \n    &gt; support it. It was\n    &gt; more a matter of &quot;hey, look at this really neat way of \n    &gt; doing automated unit\n    &gt; testing. Once we had a decent set of automated unit \n    &gt; tests, there was no\n    &gt; turning back.\n    &gt; \n    &gt; Hope this is of some help,\n    &gt; Peter\n    &gt; \n    &gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n    &gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n    &gt;  \n    &gt; \n    &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
