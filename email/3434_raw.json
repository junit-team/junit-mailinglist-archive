There&#39;s also an interresting feature that JUnit needs is a \nmean to count the assert(), assertNotNull(), assertNull()...\nso some test are heavier than others.\n\nWhat I&#39;ve also noticed but in this case it&#39;s - I believe - included but \nI haven&#39;t managed to have it working on my tests, is the following :\nWhen making repetive tests with the same method/TestCase but with \ndifferent parameters, it&#39;s the need to name the tests to be able to \nrecognize them.\nAn example ?\nSay for instance that I want to test the behavior of a system on the set \nof Real number where the function should have the following behavior :\nf(x) gives true :\n\tx = -infinite , -5[ & [-4, 3] & 5\n\nf(x) gives false :\n\tx = [-5, -4[ & ]3, 5[ & ] 5, + infinite\n\nf(x) should throw an exception when x = 5\n\nNow I can definitevely write three TestCases.\n1�. testF_X_OK();\n2�. testF_X_NOK();\n3�. testF_X_throws_Exception();\n\nbut modify the internal state of my TestCase to reach the requested \nvalidation*s*It would be nice to put some comments on the TestCase.\nI belive the TestCase.setName(String aTestCaseName) method is there for \nthat but I never managed to have it working.\n\nOf course ideally, the TestCase.setComment() ethod should come from \njavadocs... ;-)\n\n\nThomas,\n\n\n\n\nDavid V. Olivier wrote:\n\n&gt; All in all, JUnit has a wonderfully simple and effective user\n&gt; interface.  There is , however, one behavior that I find troublesome.  This\n&gt; is the absence of a detailed stack trace when one runs only a single test\n&gt; case (the second &quot;Run&quot; button).  Instead one only receives pass/fail\n&gt; information in the status bar (I&#39;m using the Swing UI).\n&gt; \n&gt; I often find myself in the case where one test of several has failed.  I\n&gt; make the fix, and then want to test it again.  If I want detailed reporting\n&gt; I have to run the entire suite.  Some of my tests require time-consuming\n&gt; set-up operations, and when this is the case the overhead excessive.  Of\n&gt; course, at some point one needs run the complete suite, but when iterating\n&gt; between coding and testing it would be nice to have the full functionality\n&gt; available for running a single test case.\n&gt; \n&gt; Anyone else have an opinion?\n&gt; \n&gt; p.s. Forgive me if this issue has come up before, but I couldn&#39;t find it\n&gt; the archives.  Also, one might argue that this is more of a development\n&gt; issue, but since it relates to the user interface, I&#39;ll go ahead and post\n&gt; it here.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; David Olivier\n&gt; Naval Research Laboratory\n&gt; Digital Mapping, Charting & Geodesy Analysis Program\n&gt; Code 7440.2\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
