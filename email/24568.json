There have also been failures because of writing things to <br/>\nthe database and not cleaning up properly after themselves - or because <br/>\nthe tests were not designed to work in the presense of existing data, <br/>\nwhichever way you want to think about it.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nEsko Luontola<br/>\nwww.orfjackal.net</div>",
