You then<br/>\n&gt; insert the data you will test.  Your data is not time dependant anymore.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>    If you have that luxury, then the problem doesn&#39;t arise. We frequently<br/>\n    have to &quot;make do&quot; with a database that already exists and being used<br/>\n    by other groups. But i guess, if you create some rows specifically for<br/>\n    your testing and ensure that nobody else messes with those, that would<br/>\n    be a good solution...<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If you have an object that can be saved, updated and retrieved from a<br/>\n&gt; database, a nice way to test your SQL statement and your database is to:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 1. create an object with valid data<br/>\n&gt; 2. store the object into the database<br/>\n&gt; 3. retrieve from the database into another object<br/>\n&gt; 4. compare that these two objects are equal<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>    That is a good way. I have had this problem with testing database queries<br/>\n    and i have gotten some good ideas from the replies.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nNilesh</div>",
