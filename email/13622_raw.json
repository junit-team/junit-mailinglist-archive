(EG\nthree of them are a transaction-oriented begin/commit/abort family.)\n\nA bunch of at-any-timers deal with adding stuff (mostly triples, some\nname bindings) and removing stuff (ditto); then there&#39;s a bunch of\nmethods probing the stuff (list-satisfying-pattern, does-it-contain,\netc).\n\nNow, one might reasonably say 180 was a tad too many. (It&#39;s not *quite*\nthat bad, because there&#39;s a bunch of families of methods differing only\nin the type of there last argument - int/real/float/double/long/short/char\n/byte/String/Object, pah - so really there&#39;s one abstract method and a\nclump of overloadings). It&#39;s not clear that there&#39;s a better solution,\nthough.
