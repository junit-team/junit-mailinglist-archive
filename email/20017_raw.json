I need to be able to mock up JNDI so that I can test=\r\n\n&gt; the persistance in my EJB&#39;s.\n&gt;\n&gt; I would like to test outside the contai=\r\nner as I hear this is the best\n&gt; method for testing EJBs.

Any help would =\r\nbe greatly appreciate, a tutorial\n&gt; anything that will help get me started.=\r\n  I would preferable like a\n&gt; solution that can fit into a night build and =\r\ntest enviornment.  We use\n&gt; Continuum to build and test our companies code =\r\neverynight.  If I could\n&gt; drive the EJB test cases from a Maven pom that wo=\r\nuld be a bonus.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks in advance,\n&gt;\n&gt; Vince\n\n\n\n",
