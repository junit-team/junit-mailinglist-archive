Netbeans QA & RE departments\nrequired ability to define subset of existing tests, which are\nstable enough to be executed continuously and whose\npotential failure will discover real regression in Netbean&#39;s product.\n\nWell, that was my motivation for writing JUnit extension allowing\ntest filtering. The idea was simple: assign filter to each test in the\nsuite and let it decide if it can or can not run depending on its name\nand assigned filter.\n\nImplementation was surprisingly simple too:\n\n* there is new class junit.framework.Filter, which you can\nset list of include and exclude patterns, each pattern is wildcard-like mask\n\n* the Test interface was extended by functions:\npublic void setFilter(Filter)\npublic boolean canRun()\n\n* all classes implementing Test were updated, it means\nTestCase, TestSuite, TestDecorator; their behavior is as follows:\n\nTestCase - uses filter for decision if it can or can not run (doesn&#39;t run if it\ncan&#39;t)\nTestSuite - always can run (ignores filter), but delegates filter to contained\ntests\nTestDecorator - delegates decision on filtering to decorated test\n\n* doing that should keep as much as possible of existing testing code\nworking, as it should be derived from above three classes (all you need\nis to recompile your tests)\n\n* and finally, new FilteredTestRunner was added to allow test filtering\n\nAnd now, the reason of this mail, I would like to share my\ncode with community as there are still voices asking for\nsomething similar.\n\nAttached ZIP-archive contains all of my code and simple example,\nwhich will demonstrate the feature. I have included source files only,\nbut there is simple Ant&#39;s script, which will build all for you, just\nfollow these steps:\n\n1. unzip attached archive somewhere to your disk\n2. write &#39;ant&#39; to build JUnit extension, this should create lib/junit-f.jar\nfile\n3. copy junit.jar (JUnit 3.6 or 3.5 frameworks) to created lib directory\n4. write &#39;ant example&#39; to compile and start example of tests, you should\nget output like this:\nBuildfile: build.xml\n\ne-compile:\n    [javac] Compiling 2 source files to V:&#92;work&#92;jj&#92;example&#92;tested\n    [javac] Compiling 4 source files to V:&#92;work&#92;jj&#92;example&#92;test\n\nexample:\n     [java] .testGreeting1\n     [java] .testGreeting2\n     [java] .testHello\n     [java]\n     [java] Time: 0.032\n     [java]\n     [java] OK (3 tests)\n     [java]\n\nBUILD SUCCESSFUL\n\nNote, that three tests were executed.\n\n5. enable filter in build.xml file (comment line\n&lt;arg line=&quot;RootSuite&quot;/&gt;\n\nand uncoment line\n&lt;!-- &lt;arg line=&quot;RootSuite -i *Greeting* -e *2&quot;/&gt; --&gt;\n\nand write &#39;ant example&#39; again, you should get following output:\nBuildfile: build.xml\n\ne-compile:\n\nexample:\n     [java] .testGreeting1\n     [java]\n     [java] Time: 0.016\n     [java]\n     [java] OK (1 tests)\n     [java]\n\nBUILD SUCCESSFUL\n\nNote, that tests contained in RootSuite class were filtered\nby active filter &#39;-i *Greeting* -e *2&#39;, thus only testGreeting1\nwas executed.\n\nThat&#39;s the demonstration, please try it and let me know.\nI am looking forward your comments!\n\nGood luck,\nVita\n\nP.S.: If you don&#39;t have Ant already installed, you can\ndownload it from http://jakarta.apache.org.\n\nP.P.S: For those really interested I have refectored Ant&#39;s\njunit task to support filtering of tests.\n\n\n--\nVitezslav Stejskal, Software engineer\n\nSUN Microsystems Czech s.r.o.\ne-mail: vitezslav.stejskal@...\ntel:    +420 2 3300-9232\n\n\r\n--------------4AA0406AA4E96DF3F92A84CF\r\nContent-Type: application/x-zip-compressed;\n name=&quot;junit-filtering.zip&quot;\r\nContent-Disposition: inline;\n filename=&quot;junit-filtering.zip&quot;\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n--------------4AA0406AA4E96DF3F92A84CF--\r\n\n",
