I understand you are<br/>\n&gt;currently doing this as an exercise, so it&#39;s healthy to take it to<br/>\n&gt;extremes and do everything by the book in order to learn, but in your<br/>\n&gt;real work, use your judgment and decide for yourself when you are<br/>\n&gt;indeed writing too much code, in which case it&#39;s probably safer to go<br/>\n&gt;the usual route (get your code to work, then write tests for it).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The downside of TDD is that you can end up writing a lot of tests for<br/>\n&gt;business code that you quickly throw away and rewrite, so the amount<br/>\n&gt;of churn can be quite high.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I haven&#39;t seen that. Maybe we are doing things differently.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing that is underemphasized in all of this, though, is TDD&#39;s <br/>\neffect on design. When you write tests after the fact it&#39;s easier to end <br/>\nup with classes that are rather monolithic. An example, close to this <br/>\nlist: I wrote a tool a while back which shows the internal dependency <br/>\nstructure of classes. I ran it on a version of JUnit and the pictures <br/>\nare small and balanced. Most of the classes have roughly the same amount <br/>\nof internal structure. Afterwards, I ran it on TestNG and I noticed that <br/>\nsome of the classes are rather large and they contain a lot of internal <br/>\nstructure.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not saying this is good or bad, JUnit and TestNG have different <br/>\nimplementation styles. In any case, I don&#39;t think that a class like your <br/>\nTestRunner in TestNG, would look the same if it was implemented <br/>\nincrementally via TDD.<br/>\n<br/>\nMichael Feathers<br/>\nwww.objectmentor.com</div>",
