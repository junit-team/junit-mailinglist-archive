No real world classloader environment<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I assert that it is almost a proper testing environment. For many, if<br/>\n&gt; not most, JUnit users, the class loading tests work and work better<br/>\n&gt; than the alternative because they allow a developer to leave the Swing<br/>\n&gt; UI running and rerun an individual test after changing it in the IDE.<br/>\n&gt; As the usage of JUnit expans, many people run the Swing UI in what I<br/>\n&gt; would consider strange environments. I often wonder why they aren&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; just running the textui, but I digress. Since those environment are<br/>\n&gt; common, and the loading behavior introduces problems it would probably<br/>\n&gt; be best to change the Swing UI to default to noloading. Eliminating the<br/>\n&gt; class loading behavior would be a huge disservice to the devlopers who<br/>\n&gt; use it daily to increase their feedback by running tests while coding.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>&quot;Almost&quot; and &quot;Are&quot; can sometimes be a mile apart.  Defaulting to the<br/>\n&quot;-nonloading&quot; option is a step in the right direction.  However, what<br/>\nabout this possibility:<br/>\n<br/>\nThe same classloader is run for all tests.  When the Swing runner is asked<br/>\nto re-run a test or group of tests, create a new Classloader for the<br/>\nenvironment.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe important thing here is consistency.  In this situation, we do not<br/>\nhave a new ClassLoader for each individual *Test* (which may be simply<br/>\nanother method in the same class).  We have a new ClassLoader for each<br/>\nindividual *Run*.  This provides the flexibility the users want, AND<br/>\nthe stable environment everyone craves.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave you guys considered that route and run into snags?<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Those who would trade liberty for<br/>\n temporary security deserve neither&quot;<br/>\n                - Benjamin Franklin</div>",
