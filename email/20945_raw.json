There is a lot of information out there,=\r\n and also a lot of\n&gt; free and open code, but this data is not organized in =\r\nthe way Perl is,\n&gt; such as with the Perl CPAN, and as a result I am definit=\r\nely getting\n&gt; overwhelmed and frustrated.  (Perhaps Larry Wall spoiled me.)=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; I would be really grateful if anywone could point me to some \nexcelle=\r\nnt\n&gt; &quot;step by step&quot; information for getting started with Eclipse and JUnit.=\r\n\n&gt;  I should mention that I will be needing to work with the\n&gt; SpringFramew=\r\nork, and ultimately customizing the fancy new \nmessaging\n&gt; systems such as =\r\nAMPQ.\n&gt; \n&gt; As soon as I get &quot;turned around&quot; I will be documenting everythin=\r\ng I \nam\n&gt; doing probably on the Wikiversity site, which is a great place.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; Thank you very much in advance, John\n&gt; \n&gt; PS, if you are interested in =\r\nthe business model I am working on/with\n&gt; and the group we are forming, and=\r\n our philosophy, etc, etc, please \nask.\n&gt;\n\nI think the book &quot;Test-Driven De=\r\nvelopment by Example&quot; is a good start \npoint. \n\n\n",
