I suppose we could start looking at a\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n custom Request object that returns a runner that is never intended to\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nbe used with the @RunWith annotation, but rather delegates run\n&gt; &gt; building=\r\n on each class. But I&#39;m not sure that IDEA or ant support a\n&gt; &gt; custom Requ=\r\nest object, or how you would get them to use it.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In junit@yaho=\r\nogroups.com, Malte Finsterwalder &lt;malte@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; yme0987654321 wrote:\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; In answer to your second question, basically the slow tests\nwould run=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; at check in, or during the general build process, whereas the fast\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt;&gt; test would just be part of the TDD of making sure everything is\ngreen.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; For point of comparison, the slow tests are currently 1/2 hour for\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt;&gt; less than 100, and the fast tests are under 60 seconds, even though\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; there are about 700 of them.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I understand that reasoning.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; But as you said you want to have several categories:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; DB-Tests, In Co=\r\nntainer Tests, ...\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Maybe you should create a runner hat can be paramet=\r\nerized to\nhandle all\n&gt; &gt;&gt; these cases?\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; And how do you setup the r=\r\nuntime, so that it does run the tests\nor does\n&gt; &gt;&gt; not run the tests on a p=\r\ner run basis?\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Setting a system property seams cumbersome to me.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; T=\r\nhat&#39;s ok for the server, but sometimes I want to run the slow\ntests on\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n my desktop too, don&#39;t I?\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Maybe we can come up with something bet=\r\nter?\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Greetings,\n&gt; &gt;&gt;    Malte\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ------=\r\n------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
