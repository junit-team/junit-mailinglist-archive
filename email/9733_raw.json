(I will not consider badl=\r\ny written, since majority I have expirience with are fine in this rescpect)=\r\n.\nSo, when you say only interfaces are visible (and I mean visibillity in s=\r\noftware programming sence) I understand all classes are not, so there is no=\r\n way to extend them (inherit). On the other hand, if classes are visible, t=\r\nhere is nothing preventing a client programmer instantiating these classes =\r\ndirectly (not through interface). Generally, you will want to permit extend=\r\ning only certain classes.\nThe same thing happens on the method - field leve=\r\nl, if you don&#39;t make method private, client programmer will consider it was=\r\nn&#39;t ment to be private.\nOO. Rule No 1: encapsulate!\nOnly contract two progr=\r\nammers have to obey is code. What makes you think other programmer will rea=\r\nd your docs or comments? But, if he tries to override private method, compi=\r\nler will not permit it. (Actually, he will not even know the method exist.)=\r\n \nIf you can ENFORCE something, you will not leave it to chance. Making met=\r\nhod private or public is a design decision , not something arbitrary.\nLeavi=\r\nng important information to comments, docs etc is extremely dangerous! I su=\r\nggest you check out refactoring catalogue www.refactoring.com (&quot;Comments li=\r\ne, code does not&quot;) and how refactoring community treats comments: either yo=\r\nu don&#39;t need them  so you eliminate them or you make code out of them. Simi=\r\nlar thing goes for documentation that is trying to explain code.\nMaking tes=\r\nting influence your design decision is an example of very testing-biased pa=\r\nradigm, but this should not conflict with basic premises of OO, like most o=\r\nf new usefull paradigms don&#39;t (for example AOP does not make you change OO =\r\nprinciples, it builds on them).\n \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Hello Michael, \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; &gt;Privat=\r\ne methods are difficult to test because, after all, they&#39;re \n&gt;&gt; &gt;private. I=\r\nf you adopt a convention that API methods are only \n&gt;&gt; presented \n&gt;&gt; &gt;via J=\r\nava Interfaces instead of concrete classes then you don&#39;t care \n&gt;&gt; &gt;about t=\r\nhe way the implementers of the Interfaces are \n&gt;&gt; written. You can \n&gt;&gt; &gt;the=\r\nn make non-API methods within the concrete implementation public \n&gt;&gt; &gt;witho=\r\nut implying that they are themselves API methods.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; I am not sure I fo=\r\nllow, but as I can see this only works if \n&gt;&gt; you never plan to extend your=\r\n clases, or leave them to be \n&gt;&gt; extended. I guess that in your case only t=\r\nhing visible from \n&gt;&gt; the outside are interfaces. If you write frameworks, =\r\nit is \n&gt;&gt; difficult to get by without inheritance. Inheritance breaks \n&gt;&gt; e=\r\nncapsulation, keeping methods private helps encapsulate things. \n&gt;&gt; Also, I=\r\n am not shure what you mean by &quot;without implying&quot;, \n&gt;&gt; generally you &quot;make =\r\nstatement&quot; with your code, any other \n&gt;&gt; method yo imply something (comment=\r\ns, documentation etc...) is \n&gt;&gt; superfluous.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Regards,\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Danijel=\r\n Arsenovski\n&gt;\n&gt;On the contrary, I think this approach makes it easier to ex=\r\ntend\n&gt;frameworks. I believe that in the general case, there is no reason to=\r\n\n&gt;make methods in classes private if their API methods are only accessed\n&gt;b=\r\ny clients via Interface methods.\n&gt;\n&gt;Here&#39;s an example of what I mean:\n&gt;\n&gt;Le=\r\nt&#39;s assume we have class MyClass that implements interface\n&gt;MyInterface, wi=\r\nth methods:\n&gt;public int x(){\n&gt;  // return an answer based on y() and z() \n&gt;=\r\n}\n&gt;private int y() {...}\n&gt;private int z() {...}\n&gt;\n&gt;And Interface MyInterfac=\r\ne with method:\n&gt;public int x()\n&gt;\n&gt;We observe that:\n&gt;\n&gt;- MyInterface serves =\r\nto &#39;publish&#39; the API method x().\n&gt;\n&gt;- Any client of MyClass will only see i=\r\nt in terms of \n&gt;\n&gt;- We have the choice of testing public method x() by cons=\r\ntructing a test\n&gt;that &#39;talks&#39; to either MyClass or MyInterface. \n&gt;\n&gt;- If we=\r\n have other concrete implementors of MyInterface it makes sense\n&gt;to write t=\r\nhe test to talk to MyInterface rather than directly to\n&gt;implementors to the=\r\ny can be swapped in and tested.\n&gt;\n&gt;- x() returns a value based on values re=\r\nturned by private methods y()\n&gt;and z().\n&gt;\n&gt;- Methods y() and z() may be pri=\r\nvate for no other reason than that they\n&gt;are not part of the public API int=\r\nerface of MyClass and that the\n&gt;developer did not anticipate that anyone wo=\r\nuld ever need to use them in\n&gt;extending the framework.\n\n&gt;Continuing:\n&gt;Let&#39;s=\r\n say \n&gt; - we want to extend MyClass with MyClass2 that implements method in=\r\nt\n&gt;q().\n&gt; - we want to override x() so that it uses methods y(),  z(), and =\r\nq() to\n&gt;calculate its return value. \n&gt;\n&gt;We have a problem: MyClass2 does no=\r\nt have visibility to private methods\n&gt;y() and z().\n&gt;\n&gt;If private methods y(=\r\n) and z() were made public there would be no\n&gt;adverse effect on the publica=\r\ntion of API methods because users of the\n&gt;class would only see those method=\r\ns published via MyInterface. \n&gt;\n&gt;We have the question of whether it is *saf=\r\ne* to use y() and z(). Since\n&gt;they are not published as part of the API via=\r\n MyInterface it may be\n&gt;considered too risky to use them. This can be solve=\r\nd with some notes in\n&gt;the javadoc. \n&gt;\n&gt;Methods that really are too risky to=\r\n use outside of the class itself can\n&gt;always be made private but I would ho=\r\npe that this is the exception and\n&gt;not the rule.\n&gt;\n&gt;The developer creating =\r\nthe extension can make the decision based on\n&gt;those notes whether they are =\r\nwilling to accept fhe risk of using methods\n&gt;that may not continue to behav=\r\ne the same way or even exist in the\n&gt;future. At least they have that choice=\r\n. If they have a good set of tests\n&gt;then changes to those methods in the fu=\r\nture will be exposed readily\n&gt;enough.\n&gt;\n&gt;Conclusion\n&gt;----------\n&gt;If the pur=\r\npose of making methods private is to indicate that they are\n&gt;not part of a =\r\nclass&#39;s API a better way is to encourage users of the\n&gt;class to program to =\r\na Java Interface instead. When you make methods\n&gt;private it makes the class=\r\n more difficult to test and short-circuits the\n&gt;efforts of people who might=\r\n need to extend the framework in\n&gt;unanticipated ways.\n\n--------------------=\r\n---------\nMike Silverstein\nSilverMark, Inc.\nThe Object Testing Company\nwww.=\r\njavatesting.com\n\n---\nOutgoing mail is certified Virus Free.\nChecked by AVG =\r\nanti-virus system (http://www.grisoft.com).\nVersion: 6.0.522 / Virus Databa=\r\nse: 320 - Release Date: 9/29/2003\n \n\n\n\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send=\r\n an email to:\njunit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n \n\nYour use of Yahoo!
