Here is the basic\nthought:\n\nThe vast majority of CIOs have been wreckless in their\nthinking about outsourcing. The notion of sending work\nprimarily to India is minimally irresponsible. CIOs\nhave the fiduciary duty to protect the integrity of\ntheir systems and the health and welfare of existing\nemployees.\n\nThe responsible CIOs have taken steps that address the\nIndia movement. For example, the CIO of Phoenix Life\ntook the initiative to build their own outsourcing\nfacility in Bangalore India instead of giving it over\nto a third party. They did not underestimate the need\nfor &quot;employees&quot; to do work instead of third parties.\n\nOther CIOs that have adapted Agile approaches realize\nthat people interaction is more important than\nprocesses and tools. They figured out that outsourcing\nto locations where interaction with existing staff is\neasier makes the most sense. The really smart CIOs\nhave looked at smaller countries in the same time zone\nas their employees. For example, there are outsourcing\ncompanies in Barbados and Trinidad.\n\nThe Agile CIO also understands that his/her own\nemployees need to periodically travel in order to form\na viable partnership. Choosing countries that have\ndirect flights from major airports such as JFK, Miami,\netc are responsible. Likewise choosing countries where\nculture is similar to US/UK is also responsible. \n\nIgnoring the fact that the world is changing where\nterrorist activities are prevalent, choosing countries\nwhere this will not jeopardize the business is vital.\nImagine how many strategies are at risk if Pakistan\ndecides to fight India. One could academically argue\nthat maybe Trinidad would fight Barbados but this\nwould be silly.\n\nCIOs simply need to be more responsible...\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
