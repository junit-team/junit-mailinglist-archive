By looking at it I\nassume...\n\n&gt; * Are sufficiently implementation-independent to support easier\nrefactoring\n\nWhen your tests only use the public interfaces they usually don&#39;t break\nduring refactoring. They might become redundant, i.e. worthless, when you\ntest a special case which is no special case in the new refactored\nimplementation any more.\n\n&gt; * Run quickly, are small, easy to read...\n&gt;\n&gt; I realize that these are competing forces, so the challenge is striking\nthe\n&gt; right balance. I find my life difficult when my tests get in the way of my\n&gt; refactorings... tests that have intimate knowledge of the implementation\ntend\n&gt; to be refactoring-resistant. I tend away from them if I can.\n\nThat&#39;s a very food heuristic for deciding if it&#39;s worth writing a test or\nnot: asking if the test will probably stay around with the next\nfunctionality or not. This is my biggest concern I have with doing\nendo-testing using mock objects.\n\nWhere do you think our views still differ? Defining the &quot;real&quot; meaning of a\nterm (black-box) seems no essential difference to me. It&#39;s interesting but\nmerely of academic value.\n\nJohannes\n\n\n",
