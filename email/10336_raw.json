Now how can I write a test to this particular change\n&gt; that I have to make. My understanding of testing using JUnit is to\n&gt; test the component which I am changing. But in this particular case\n&gt; I will be returning this ValueObject to some other part of my code\n&gt; where there is chance that the code may fail(though I can&#39;t see any\n&gt; chance of it as of now). I&#39;ll appreciate the group&#39;s comments on my\n&gt; doubt.\n\nDon&#39;t look to us for rules about what to test. If you think it might not \nwork, then test it. Test it, anyway, just for practice. After you gain \nmore experience, your judgment about what to test and what&#39;s Too Simple \nto Break will improve.\n\nIn the meantime, test it.\n\nAnswer this question for yourself: if you made your change incorrectly, \nthen how would you know? When you answer that question, there is your \ntest. If the answer is &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot;, then maybe that line of code you \nare about to remove does nothing useful! Is there more code that does \nnothing useful? Remove it too!\n-- \nJ. B.
