Myself, I l=\r\nike\nto gather tests into Java-level suite classes, because these can be\nreu=\r\nsed in ant, Eclipse, maven, etc.\n\nOne advantage of ant is that you can fail=\r\n fast, deciding that if suite\nA fails, don&#39;t even bother running suite B.  =\r\nAlso, sometimes the build\nsystem or political structure of a team can make =\r\nit easier to edit XML\nfiles than Java, in which case the ant file might mak=\r\ne sense.\n\nGood luck,\n\n   David\n\nOn Tue, Apr 28, 2009 at 6:03 AM, esordini &lt;=\r\nemmanuele.sordini@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Dear all,\n&gt; I find myself faced with =\r\nthe following issue. I&#39;ve been assigned to\n&gt; a new project where I have a g=\r\nroup of Junit test classes (around\n&gt; 150). My aim is to setup a fully autom=\r\nated test environment\n&gt; starting on the current project status. I was think=\r\ning of using\n&gt; Ant as the the first step, and then moving to some continuou=\r\ns\n&gt; integration tool further down the line.\n&gt;\n&gt; I see two main outstanding =\r\nproblems:\n&gt;\n&gt; 1) My test hierarchy is made up of a heterogeneous set of cla=\r\nsses,\n&gt; some of which are purely stand-alone classes (i.e. I have to\n&gt; manu=\r\nally launch them), while some others are grouped into\n&gt; test suites.\n&gt;\n&gt; 2)=\r\n Test case complexity is very wide, ranging from very simple\n&gt; (and fast) o=\r\nnes to more complicated ones than can take hours to\n&gt; complete.\n&gt;\n&gt; So I wa=\r\ns wondering what is the best tradeoff between prioritizing\n&gt; tests at code =\r\nlevel (i.e. with Test Suites) vs. at script level\n&gt; (i.e. by specifying the=\r\n desired order in an Ant batchtest task).\n&gt;\n&gt; Any help on this issue will b=\r\ne greatly appreciated.\n&gt;\n&gt; Best regards\n&gt; Emmanuele Sordini\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; -------=\r\n-----------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
