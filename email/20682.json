You could do that using a similar syntax to that outlined<br/>\n&gt; below, but it would make it harder to read tests declaratively. With the<br/>\n&gt; current design, if I want to know what data a test will have available, I<br/>\n&gt; read the @Befores (and @Parameters). Then I can read all the tests assuming<br/>\n&gt; those are the conditions under which it will execute. If I have a diffferent<br/>\n&gt; fixture, I go to a different class.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Can you tell me a little more about what benefits you see from your proposed<br/>\n&gt; arrangement and in which circumstances it would be superior to having tests<br/>\n&gt; with different fixtures in different classes?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think that the parameterization and the test fixture are the same.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I think it&#39;s normal to have part of my test fixture shared in a <br/>\nBefore-Method. And then I extend (or modify) this setup slightly inside <br/>\nmy different test methods.<br/>\n<br/>\nI want to do some tests with a customer object, for example how the <br/>\ncustomer responds to billing differnt items to his account.<br/>\nSome of theses tests can be parameterized, some can&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\ne.g. I want to write a test that billing &quot;null&quot; is not allowed and <br/>\nthrows an exception. This test is not parameterized.<br/>\nThen I want to bill different goods and I want to see, that the customer <br/>\nresponds correctly by say calculating a correct bonus, according to his <br/>\nstate. To check this, I need to bill 10 different goods, cause some of <br/>\nthem have a bonus, some don&#39;t, etc.<br/>\nThese 10 tests can be parameterized with a good to bill and the <br/>\nresulting bonus. They still use the same fixture, namely the customer <br/>\nobject.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would like all these tests in the same class, since they use the same <br/>\nfixture and test a coherent set of functionality.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes that make more sense now?<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW: I learned, that testNG uses an approach like the one I proposed.<br/>\nAns reading up on Theries, I noticed, that they have a somewhat similar <br/>\napproach as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegard,<br/>\n    Malte<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a> &lt;mailto:junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a> &lt;mailto:junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt;] On Behalf Of<br/>\n&gt; Malte Finsterwalder<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, July 09, 2008 12:01 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: junit YahooGroup<br/>\n&gt; Subject: [junit] Parameterized Tests, a proposal<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hi,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I just got around to looking into parameterized tests a little more.<br/>\n&gt; But it confirmed the impression I got when they came out with JUnit 4.<br/>\n&gt; They are sooo clunky, that I rather write a test that calls a<br/>\n&gt; helper-method with parameters instead.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; But this time I had time to ask myself: Why is it so clunky?<br/>\n&gt; In what way could it be better.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So I came up with an idea, how I would like it to be.<br/>\n&gt; And here is an example:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; @RunWith(Parameterized.class)<br/>\n&gt; public class MyParameterizedTest {<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; private Object[] data = new Object[][] {<br/>\n&gt; {&quot;param1&quot;, 2, 3},<br/>\n&gt; {&quot;other&quot;, 5, 99},<br/>\n&gt; {&quot;more&quot;, 234, 5875727343}<br/>\n&gt; };<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; // The parameter given as &quot;data&quot; here, specifies that<br/>\n&gt; // attribute, that contains the parameters for the test<br/>\n&gt; @ParameterizedTest(&quot;data&quot;)<br/>\n&gt; public void testWhatever(String str, int i, long j) {<br/>\n&gt; // This method gets called 3 times<br/>\n&gt; // once for each line in the above Object[]<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; // do whatever here<br/>\n&gt; }<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; @Test<br/>\n&gt; public void plainNonParameterizedTest() {<br/>\n&gt; // this is a normal unit test that is<br/>\n&gt; // called just once<br/>\n&gt; }<br/>\n&gt; }<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I think it&#39;s a lot easier this way.<br/>\n&gt; It allows mixing of parameterized tests and non parameterized tests, if<br/>\n&gt; you like.<br/>\n&gt; I allows for several parameterized tests in a single class.<br/>\n&gt; And I don&#39;t see disadvantages.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It could be even simpler, if it were incorporated into the existing<br/>\n&gt; JUnit Test-annotation, like so:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; // no @RunWith-Annotation here<br/>\n&gt; public class MyParameterizedTest {<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; private Object[] data = new Object[][] {<br/>\n&gt; {&quot;param1&quot;, 2, 3},<br/>\n&gt; {&quot;other&quot;, 5, 99},<br/>\n&gt; {&quot;more&quot;, 234, 5875727343}<br/>\n&gt; };<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; // The parameter given as &quot;data&quot; here, specifies that<br/>\n&gt; // attribute, that contains the parameters for the test<br/>\n&gt; // Use of standard Test-annotation with a new parameter<br/>\n&gt; @Test(parameterized=&quot;data&quot;)<br/>\n&gt; public void testWhatever(String str, int i, long j) {<br/>\n&gt; // This method gets called 3 times<br/>\n&gt; // once for each line in the above Object[]<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; // do whatever here<br/>\n&gt; }<br/>\n&gt; }<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What do you think?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I already tried to implement the first version, since it&#39;s non<br/>\n&gt; intrusive, but looking into extending JUnit, I found that it&#39;s a pain in<br/>\n&gt; the behind, if you don&#39;t want to extends internals-stuff.<br/>\n&gt; But maybe I&#39;m just misunderstanding or missing things.<br/>\n&gt; But that&#39;s another story for another post... shortly...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Greetings,<br/>\n&gt; Malte </span></blockquote></div>",
