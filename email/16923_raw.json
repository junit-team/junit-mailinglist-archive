I will\ntry to be as brief as possible.\n \nI have about 100 excel spreadsheets that I am accessing via POI. These\nbasically form the input to my system. Then I take this input and run it\nagainst a component to get some rates. The aim of my test is to compare\nthe output coming from the rate engine to the output generated by\nformulas on each Excel workbook.\n \nIf I run tests on all 100 workbooks at once, it takes a long time. And\nit takes longer to identify which workbooks have errors on them and why.\nSo, I would like to selectively run tests on some workbooks only at a\ntime. One way to do this is to write a Base Test Class which contains\nall the test methods and 100 Test classes (each corresponding to one\nworkbook) which extend this class. Then these 100 classes are added to a\nsuite and I can then run each test class independently.\n \nThe problem is writing the 100 classes. Also, its hard to go on creating\nmore classes if we need to test more workbooks.\n \nMy question is, is there a way to programatically run tests on a\nworkbook by passing in the name of the workbook. So that, for example, I\ncan pass in the name of the Workbook and test would run for only that\nworkbook.\n \nI did some research and it seems like a concept of a Plugggable Selector\nmight do the trick for me. Its available at:\nhttp://junit.sourceforge.net/doc/cookstour/cookstour.htm\n \nBut I don&#39;t know this for sure. Has anyone done this before or have any\nidea how to do it?\n \nThanks,\nHarsh.\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n\n",
