Have one folder in your project called &quot;src&quot; for your source code.\n2=\r\n. Have another folder (a sibling of &quot;src&quot;) called &quot;junit&quot; or &quot;test&quot; or\nsome=\r\nthing like that. Nowadays I am calling mine &quot;junit&quot; because I&#39;ve ended\nup w=\r\nith a variety of types of test code in my projects.\n3. Under the &quot;junit&quot; fo=\r\nlder organize your packages the same way as you would\nunder &quot;src&quot;, and keep=\r\n your test classes and all other related classes here\n(such as mock classes=\r\n).\n4 In Eclipse, set up a new run configuration that runs all tests in the\n=\r\n&quot;junit&quot; folder. This will allow you to execute all tests in your project. I=\r\nf\nyou want to run all the classes in a specific package, you can setup run\n=\r\nconfigurations to do that also.\n\nAs for the Yahoo Groups things - I thought=\r\n that at first too. But if you go\nback into the group there will be a link =\r\nto Edit Membership, where you can\nadd a new email address and switch where =\r\nmail is sent to for this group.\n\nGood luck!\n-Dennis\n\nOn Sat, Jul 3, 2010 at=\r\n 10:35 AM, debio264 &lt;debio264@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; After Googling inste=\r\nad of going through articles here, I found\n&gt; http://www.devx.com/Java/Artic=\r\nle/31983/0/page/3\n&gt; It looks like I should be using @RunWith(Suite.class) a=\r\nnd\n&gt; @SuiteClasses({1.class,2.class}). This isn&#39;t documented in any of the =\r\nguides\n&gt; I found in the articles section of the JUnit site.\n&gt;\n&gt; Also, this =\r\nmay just be me whining, but... Yahoo Groups seems like a poor\n&gt; place for a=\r\n project like this. I had to register a Yahoo account to join the\n&gt; group, =\r\nwhich wouldn&#39;t normally bother me, except that Yahoo forces me to use\n&gt; the=\r\nir mail system to get updates (apparently I have to pay to get the option\n&gt;=\r\n to forward my mail elsewhere). Sourceforge gives you the option to get a\n&gt;=\r\n real mailing list that requires no website account at all.\n&gt; Again, I may =\r\njust be a lazy whiner, but I found it frustrating.\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n[Non-text port=\r\nions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
