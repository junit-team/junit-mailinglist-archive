So, if your<br/>\ncode<br/>\n&gt; is done then yes it&#39;s too late. Then there isn&#39;t any unit test approach.<br/>\n&gt; Just stick to use-case tests.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs others have pointed out, that is *not* the unit test approach. They<br/>\npointed out that they and others have written unit tests for legacy code,<br/>\nand that it is never too late to write such tests. I would point out that<br/>\nthere is (at least in my mind) a difference between Test Driven Development<br/>\nand Unit Testing; Unit Testing is a tool that TDD uses to accomplish its<br/>\ngoals and objectives, but Unit Testing can be used in various other ways and<br/>\nat various other times. As I have said here recently, I advocate Unit<br/>\nTesting by independent testers *after* code has been written - even when TDD<br/>\nwas used in the design and development of that code. While TDD may be the<br/>\nfirst time code is tested, it is not the only or last time that code code<br/>\nneeds to tested - it is just the earliest time.<br/>\n<br/>\nFWIW,<br/>\nLauren<br/>\n<br/>\n=====<br/>\nLooking for an experienced Java/C++ Software Engineer?<br/>\nSee: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://developerdude.mystarband.net/resume.html\">http://developerdude.mystarband.net/resume.html</a> </span></blockquote></div>",
