For example, produce a system that is\n&gt; ready to roll out into production at any time at all, given at most a\n&gt; few hours notice. Or create a system such that a full production release\n&gt; of a huge system can be done in a couple of hours.\n\nAgreed.\n\n&gt; Unfortuantely, it can be a lot easier to hire five, or even twenty,\n&gt; not-so-talented programmers than one talented one.\n\nSo it costs less to spend more? Great. Just when I think I begin to \nunderstand business people....\n\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; In my current project, we don&#39;t even have any dedicated QA people...\n&gt; \n&gt;  &gt; Hm. Do you mean that you don&#39;t have people who test full time? or you\n&gt;  &gt; don&#39;t have people will formal testing experience and/or raw testing \n&gt; skill?\n&gt; \n&gt; We don&#39;t have people who test full time, in the sense of someone devoted\n&gt; to writing customer and functional tests. Everybody helps out a bit with\n&gt; the customer tests, though some more than others, and the functional\n&gt; tests are done by the programmers as they work on somethign that needs\n&gt; functional testing.\n&gt; \n&gt; But another point of view would be that &quot;everyone is a full-time tester&quot;\n&gt; in that everyone is expected to make sure the code has reasonable test\n&gt; coverage, and not just for the programmers&#39; unit tests.\n\nLet me offer: Everyone is a member of the team, many of which are better \nat testing and therefore execute/write tests more often than others.\n&gt; \n&gt;  &gt; Google &quot;What is exploratory testing?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Interesting. Does this quote really describe exploratory testing?\n&gt; \n&gt;      To the extent that the next test we do is influenced by the result\n&gt;      of the last test we did, we are doing exploratory testing.\n&gt; \n&gt;      (http://www.satisfice.com/articles/what_is_et.htm)\n&gt; \n&gt; This seems to me that it could just as well describe test-first\n&gt; programming; I often decide what my next test will be based on the\n&gt; previous tests I&#39;ve just produced. (&quot;Hmmm. We just saw and fixed a\n&gt; failure like such-and-such, does that mean that this other thing might\n&gt; be able to fail like that, too? Let&#39;s write a test and find out.&quot;)\n\nYes, that&#39;s accurate. When James came to XP/AU 2002 we discussed it in \nsome detail. I wish I understood ET as well then as I do now, because I \nwould have got more out of the conversations we had.\n\n&gt; It sounds to me like the &quot;scripted testing&quot; he&#39;s talking about in that\n&gt; article is not XP-style testing, where you run the tests as you come\n&gt; up with them, but instead one where you create a whole series of tests\n&gt; before you take them to the code. Especially where he says:\n&gt; \n&gt;     Scripting has its place. I can imagine testing situations where\n&gt;     efficiency and repeatability are so important that we should script\n&gt;     or automate them.\n&gt; \n&gt; I can&#39;t imagine a situation where efficiency and repeatability are\n&gt; *not* important enough to script the tests! But if you can somehow\n&gt; manipulate the system quickly enough to do exploratory testing, you can\n&gt; probably come up with a way for the script to manipulate the system even\n&gt; more quickly, and then just add your tests to the script, rather than\n&gt; throwing them away as soon as you&#39;ve tried them out.\n\nI view testing in the XP/Agile context from two perspectives.\n\n  * Test-Driven Development\n  * Continuous Regression Testing\n\nTDD is about using tests to drive the design. CRT is about capturing the \nknowledge we gain from ET to avoid reintroducing problems. CRT supports \nrefactoring by providing the safety net. Programmers and Customers alike \ncan do ET.\n\nJames and his associates worry that we focus on automating tests, rather \nthan learning from them. To that extent, they had something to worry \nabout. I am learning to remember to learn from tests and I am learning \nto view that as perhaps the most important aspect of testing, followed \nby verifying features and enabling design improvement.\n\nTake care.\n-- \nJ.
