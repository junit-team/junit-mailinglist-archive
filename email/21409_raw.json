Are there any large\n&gt;  &gt; projects that use it? Good places to get started on it?\n&gt; \n&gt; When you say adopting Confluence, do you mean adopting it as a\n&gt; platform on which you build your own application?\n\nGuessing but perhaps:\n\nhttp://www.greenpeppersoftware.com/en/products/greenpepper/features/\n\nIt seems like a FitNesse style plugin for confluence but I have\nnever used it. Don&#39;t know if it can talk to JUnit or not.\n\nI have used and really like their Agile Jira plugin GreenHopper but\ngreenpepper seems hard to get a handle on exactly what is does from\ntheir web site.\n\nPaul.\n\n&gt; I haven&#39;t developed anything on top of Confluence myself but I have\n&gt; seen a multi-module Maven project with one of the modules being a\n&gt; skeleton for a Confluence plugin (generated with Atlassian&#39;s tools, I\n&gt; believe). That skeleton had a bunch of automated tests itself so even\n&gt; if they took ages to run (can&#39;t remember exactly but it was several\n&gt; minutes) at least the existence of automated tests suggests that it&#39;s\n&gt; not the worst platform to build on.\n&gt; \n&gt; Of course, this is just an educated guess so...
