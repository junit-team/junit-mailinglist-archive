I was looking to create a data-driven test<br/>\nsuite  but the Ant reporting options aren&#39;t able to represent this<br/>\nhierarchy. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo I looked at the Swing UI Test Runner source, which has it&#39;s own<br/>\nimplementation, as does the Eclipse version as well, which build their<br/>\nown hierarchy. I had a look at the code in JUnit and it looked as<br/>\nthough adding appropriate methods to TestSuite, TestResult and<br/>\nTestListener could easily create a way of representing hierarchies to<br/>\nall listeners. Obviously, you may want to provide a a new<br/>\nTestListener2 interface, or something to maintain binary<br/>\ncompatibility, but I was wondering it anyone else has ever hit this? I<br/>\ncould of course provide a patch and tests to interested parties.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\n<br/>\nJames</div>",
