Java developers are \nat the forefront of this revolution, as evidenced by the fact that \nJUnit has been downloaded more than 500,000 times, a stunning number \nfor a testing tool, and more than all of the other XUnit frameworks \ncombined. \n\nThanks to JUnit, we have automated and standardized test execution \nand reporting, but the creation and maintenance of developer and \nunit tests is still a time-consuming and mostly manual process. It&#39;s \ntime to raise the bar. Java gives us an opportunity to let computers \ndo 90% of the mundane work associated with test creation and \nmaintenance and to do \nit better than us. We should take advantage of this so developers \ncan focus on the aspects of programming and testing that fully \nleverage human intelligence and creativity. \n\nIn this presentation you learn how JavaTM Technology&#39;s unique set of \nfeatures, \ncombined with the computing power of modern CPUs, can be used to \naddress some of the thorniest problems associated with developer and \nunit testing. You learn the right way to handle some of the biggest \nchallenges intrinsic to testing such as combinatorial \nexplosions, the myriad of explicit and implicit class dependencies, \nuncoordinated and unexpected code changes, complex and time-\nconsuming test setup and test maintenance issues. You see code and \ntest examples that highlight the inherent inefficiencies and \nincompleteness of handcrafted tests, and how automation and \ncollaborative testing can save you from writing and maintaining 90% \nof the test code you think you need to write.\n\n\n\n",
