One might get really<br/>\n&gt; confused by the mixture of different conventions (as I did, having<br/>\n&gt; started the research).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If you want to focus on the newest version od JUnit, watch out reading<br/>\n&gt; the tutorials. As I said, the two versions have totally different<br/>\n&gt; naming conventions, the older one being deprecated by the new one.<br/>\n&gt; Here&#39;s a brilliant advice on how to recognize the two styles:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.instrumentalservices.com/content/view/45/52/\">http://www.instrumentalservices.com/content/view/45/52/</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sad but true, if I hadn&#39;t found that very article, I would still be<br/>\n&gt; confused. Even though the docs attached to the downloadable version of<br/>\n&gt; JUnit 4.0 cover the new convention, the samples are still unchanged.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Have fun learning, as I&#39;m having for a few days :)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is an excellent point.
