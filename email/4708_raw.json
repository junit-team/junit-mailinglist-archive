The main \nadvantages for us are the support base for JUnit -- if we run into a \nproblem, we can turn to discussion groups for help -- and that the \nopen source community is continuously improving JUnit. So we don&#39;t \nhave to worry about developing and maintaining our own testing tool.\n\nJUnit can also work with other tools, such as Ant and HTTPUnit. The \ncombination of these tools give us a framework from which we can \nquickly put together automated test suites.\n\nJUnit does have some limitations. We use it for functional testing \nrather than strictly unit testing, and we&#39;ve had to tweak it here and \nthere (nice to have the source code available, in those cases). I \nintroduced JUnit to my manager in the context of a pilot project, and \nit helped my team to understand its capabilities and limitations \nbefore implementing it. As a result, we typically mix some of JUnit&#39;s \nfeatures with some of our own techniques when we write our black-box \ntests.\n\n-- Todd\n\n--- In junit@y..., arathi.bhaskar@i... wrote:\n&gt; Hi\n&gt; \n&gt; I am familiar with Junit for a month or two month. I have also \nstarted to\n&gt; look into Cactus project for servlet testing. I am one of the very \nfew\n&gt; people in the organization to know about this & want to share \nJunit&#39;s\n&gt; features & advantages with others & convince them of its use. I \nhave tested\n&gt; some Java programs with Junit. I gave a presentation to my managar, \nto see\n&gt; if we can pilot the use of Junit in some project.\n&gt; \n&gt; Can someone tell me the real advantages of using Junit over the\n&gt; individual&#39;s own Unit testing of the Java Code written by him. I \nhave been\n&gt; reading the articles posted on Junit homepage. Where can I find more\n&gt; articles giving the advantages of Junit.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks & Regards\n&gt; Arathi\n&gt; \n&gt; -----------------------Disclaimer------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; The views of the author may not necessarily reflect those\n&gt; of the Company.
