How will you\n&gt; test &quot;procedures&quot; that do work instead?\n&gt; (It is &#39;against the rules&#39; to change the design of them to return\n&gt; values - a testing tool should not force code changes.)\n\nJUnit is a white box testing tool meant for the developers to write as \nthey write their code.  Checking the test infected doc, for an example \nof the testing first methodology.\n\nIf QA were employing this tool, then you might be right about it being \n&#39;against the rules&#39; to change the code you&#39;re testing.  But JUnit \nencourages refactoring for testing.  Often times it removes any hard \ncoded assumptions and you&#39;ll end up designing your code better.\n\nProcedures that do work may be tricky, especially if you can&#39;t change \nthe code your testing (see the hard coded assumptions problem presenting \nitself?).  If can change the code though, you *should* manipulate it to \nallow you to test the state of the object in some manner.  Believe me, \nyour code will be better for it.\n\n&gt; 2) How will you test procedures that are composed of several\n&gt; functions?\n\n(Leaving this for someone else to answer.)\n\n&gt; 3) Can JUnit ever replace stepping thru with a debugger?\n\nMy question is can it ever replace all my print statements?\n\n\n",
