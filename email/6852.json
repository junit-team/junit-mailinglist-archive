    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-841242883\">Hello everyone,<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a project on SourceForge.net which I started a while ago.  I named<br/>\nit &quot;Extensible Java Unit-testing Framework&quot; (ejuf for short).  This<br/>\nproject is using a reusable assertion mechanism.  I am using the Jakarta<br/>\n&quot;Byte Code Engineering Library&quot; to implement assertion interfaces into<br/>\ntestable objects.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, let&#39;s say you want to use XML assertions and DB assertions<br/>\nin the same test case, you would do something like this:<br/>\npublic abstract MyXmlAndDbCase implements Testable, XmlAssertions,<br/>\nDbAssertions, EqualityAssertions {<br/>\n   public void testSomething() {<br/>\n      // Uses an object that implements XmlAssertions that was previously<br/>\n      configured<br/>\n      assertXmlEquals(...);<br/>\n<br/>\n      // Uses an object that implements DbAssertions that was previously<br/>\n      configured<br/>\n      assertDbEquals(...); // I don&#39;t know actual method names, but this<br/>\n      is for illustration purposes<br/>\n<br/>\n      // Uses an object that implements EqualityAssertions that was<br/>\n      previously configured<br/>\n      assertEquals(...);<br/>\n   }<br/>\n}<br/>\n<br/>\nThis way of doing things provides me with a completely vendor and<br/>\nextension neutral way of doing things.  Additionnaly, I have other things<br/>\nin there to help testing.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor more information, you may access the project&#39;s CVS repository.  I<br/>\nhave successfully used EJUF in two or three projects of mine.  Obviously,<br/>\nEJUF is able to test itself :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI consider the code ready for prime-time, except that there is almost no<br/>\ndocumentation.  WARNING:  There is a failure in the tests right now<br/>\nbecause that is where I left off.  I had started doing XmlConfiguration<br/>\nstuff, but that is not finished.  But the rest is actually very usable.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to take a look at the project and report back, I would be<br/>\nmore than happy to help and respond to comments, although such<br/>\ndiscussions might be more appropriate on EJUF&#39;s mailing lists...<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you,<br/>\nFrancois Beausoleil<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sourceforge.net/projects/ejuf/\">http://sourceforge.net/projects/ejuf/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nOn Mon, 3 Feb 2003 10:49:57 +0900 (JST), &quot;Curt Sampson&quot;<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:yahoo_sucks@...\">yahoo_sucks@...</a>&gt; said:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; On Sun, 2 Feb 2003, Scott Stirling wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Why not just extend TestCase with specialized, re-usable, TestCase types?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I do already. In fact, many times: we have a base test case for our<br/>\n&gt; company which adds various handy generic stuff (such as byte-array<br/>\n&gt; comparisons), inheriting from that often a test case for a project<br/>\n&gt; adding some project specific-stuff, inheriting from that in certain<br/>\n&gt; packages a package-specific test case adding stuff for the servlet or<br/>\n&gt; DB testing or whatever, and so on.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Unfortunately, it&#39;s not very modular; if someone supplies me with<br/>\n&gt; a ExtendedTestCaseOne and another person supplies me with an<br/>\n&gt; ExtendedTestCaseTwo, each of which has certain features I want, I can&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; inherit from both. And again, the test cases tend to collect more and<br/>\n&gt; more code, becoming this massive objects with massive functionality (and<br/>\n&gt; correspondingly massive tests)....<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My primary feeling here (whether supportable or not) is that a TestCase<br/>\n&gt; could be a lot smaller and simpler if we could move most of the<br/>\n&gt; assertion checking and assertion message generation code out of it.<br/>\n&gt; As well it would also give us the ability to easily add different<br/>\n&gt; ways of asserting where and when we need them, without having to use<br/>\n&gt; inheritance to bring in new implemenations of something. (I&#39;m a big fan<br/>\n&gt; of type inheritance; I&#39;m rather dubious about the use of inheritance for<br/>\n&gt; implemenation purposes only.)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; cjs<br/>\n&gt; -- <br/>\n&gt; Curt Sampson  &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cjs@...\">cjs@...</a>&gt;   +81 90 7737 2974   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.netbsd.org\">http://www.netbsd.org</a><br/>\n&gt;     Don&#39;t you know, in this new Dark Age, we&#39;re all light.  --XTC<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
