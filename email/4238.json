But it&#39;s maybe because I <br/>\ndon&#39;t stick to this principle.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn many cases, the simplest thing that works is #ifdef ... #endif (in <br/>\nC++).  Well I let you imagine how a code may look like after several <br/>\nyears of #ifdef... #endif!<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can argue that you should refactor... well unless someone has a <br/>\n_real_ good reason to spend time refactoring something that works <br/>\nperfectly, he would rather do other things that don&#39;t currently work.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt; However, the specialized Assert class (i.e.-delegation) appears to be <br/>\n </span></blockquote>more<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; flexible and easier to change in the future. It also seems to better communicate <br/>\n&gt; the purpose of the new class.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If you extend the TestCase class, you can use your assertion in the <br/>\nsubclass.  But you cannot use your assertion in an ExceptionTestCase, <br/>\nTestDecorator, TestSetup subclass unless you have created as specialized <br/>\nTestCase for that particular TestCase class.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy personal thoughts<br/>\n<br/>\n-Vladimir<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nVladimir Bossicard<br/>\nwww.bossicard.com</div>",
