(So far my \n&gt; code is a small fraction of the download, so this\n&gt; isn&#39;t an issue - yet)\n\nThere are alternatives to &quot;embedded&quot; code (if you mean\nwhat I think you mean, using inner classes to test).\n\n&gt; Another comment:\n&gt; I&#39;ve been trying to get started with the unit\n&gt; testing and have been \n&gt; encouraging other&#39;s in my company to try it too, but\n&gt; I can&#39;t get any \n&gt; buy-in. I&#39;m finding it difficult to get started so I\n&gt; don&#39;t really have \n&gt; a convincing argument for it other than &quot;I&#39;ve read\n&gt; that it is a great \n&gt; thing&quot; :), obviously if I can make it work for me it\n&gt; would help.   It&#39;s \n&gt; good to hear that others have had the same issues\n&gt; and have gotten past \n&gt; them.   The examples make it look so simple and\n&gt; easy...\n\nI felt the same way a while back, about XP in general\nand unit testing specifically.  I gave up trying to\nconvince others by talk.  At that point it WAS just\nsomething good I&#39;d heard about.\n\nNow, nearly a year later I actually practice (as much\nas is possible) TDD and unit test first.  Now it is\nnot just something good I&#39;ve read about, but I can\ntell my coworkers of actual benefit that comes from\nit.\n\nOne concrete case is with some installation code that\nme and several other members of our team have written.\n I&#39;ve found ways to refactor the code to be nearly\n100% unit tested and now the test cycles take about 3\nseconds whenever there is a change instead of a couple\nof hours (time spent actually installing the OS,\nmanually hitting buttons, testing upgrade paths, etc,\netc).  My coworkers who have been through the pain of\ndoing it the other way see the wisdom of unit testing\nwhen I show them the time and effort saved.\n\nI guess I&#39;m saying that once you have been doing it\nfor a while, you will know how to inform them of the\nbenefits in ways that actually will make sense to them\nand that you can back up with cold, hard, data.   But\nfirst you need to get &quot;test-infected&quot; yourself, and\nthat requires a bit of discipline and time trying\nthings out.  (it doesn&#39;t take long though, since the\nbenefits are very very real).\n\n- Jeff Tulley\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
