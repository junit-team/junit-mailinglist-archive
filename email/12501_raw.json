But this could get into some tricky threading\n&gt; issues.  But again I am not sure how I would update the variable and run the\n&gt; tests, and get the TestResults to come out appropriately.\n\nYou&#39;re right; you don&#39;t want to do this.\n\n&gt; Is it so wrong to want to instantiate a test with some parameters and\n&gt; automatically run the tests on it?\n\nNo, but JUnit was not designed that way.\n\n &gt; Of course I am new to Unit Testing.  It was trivially easy\n&gt; until I came across this problem.  Now it feels like I am fighting with \n&gt; JUnit,\n &gt; Parameterized TestCase is close, but I\n&gt; don&#39;t want to override runTest().  I want the reflective base \n&gt; functionality to\n&gt; run all methods named test* automatically, and for the results to show up\n&gt; appropriately.\n\nThis is a different problem from the one you described before, so it&#39;s a \ndifferent one from what I tried to help you solve.\n\nI have implemented Parameterized Test Suite, which is a hybrid of \nParameterized Test Case and the automatic test*() method extractor. I \ndidn&#39;t like the solution. I would recommend using FitNesse for this kind \nof test, rather than JUnit. Don&#39;t be thrown off by the fact that \nFitNesse is an &quot;acceptance testing&quot; tool. It&#39;s great for data driven \ntests like the one you&#39;re trying to write.\n-- \nJ. B.
