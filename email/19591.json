I can&#39;t imagine having a<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; test suite that takes 10 hours to run.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m surprised you don&#39;t have a more active imagination! :-)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On the project I&#39;m on, we now have so many JUnit-based tests that we<br/>\n&gt; have to schedule them to run on alternating nights on two different test<br/>\n&gt; servers. It takes about 14 hours to run through them all. But we&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; using JUnit as a foundation for an automated system testing framework,<br/>\n&gt; and I suspect your imagination is limited to JUnit being a unit test<br/>\n&gt; tool.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That last bit probably sounded more negative than you intended it to, so <br/>\nI won&#39;t take it negatively or personally.<br/>\n<br/>\nLikewise, I don&#39;t know how to say this without sounding like an ass, so <br/>\nplease bear with me: are /all/ those 14 hours worth of tests really that <br/>\nvaluable? More valuable than faster tests that would cover the same <br/>\narea? It just seems to me that, at 14 hours, I wouldn&#39;t be happy with <br/>\nthe speed with which I obtained feedback.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, I&#39;m not in your shoes, so I don&#39;t know the whole picture.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ.
