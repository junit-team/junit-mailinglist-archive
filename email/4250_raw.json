The javascript functions would \n&gt; ignore the default - hardcoded - action of the form, unlike \n&gt; pure httpUnit.\n&gt; \n&gt; The buttons were :\n&gt;       &quot;Save&quot;, &quot;Delete&quot;, &quot;Reload&quot;...\n&gt; The javascript functions were :\n&gt;       &quot;callSaveServlet()&quot;, &quot;callDeleteServlet()&quot;, ..\n&gt; The target servlets were :\n&gt;       SaveServlet, DeleteServlet, ReloadServlet\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Using Velocity (http://jakarta.apache.org/velocity/), the \n&gt; simplest way I \n&gt; found, was to have this hardcoded action linked to a Velocity \n&gt; variable \n&gt; &quot;$actionTarget&quot;.\n&gt; =&gt;\n&gt; Before clicking the &quot;Save&quot; button with httpUnit, I would just change, \n&gt; through Velocity, the value of $actionTarget to &quot;SaveServlet&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; Though not the real thing, it was good enough for repetitive unit \n&gt; testing, as we had one &quot;non-automated&quot; test (read : &quot;manual&quot;) \n&gt; test, that \n&gt; would have trapped typos related error.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Using this trick, I could extensively test my javascript enabled \n&gt; web-app. with pure and simple httpUnit.\n&gt; \n&gt; It was good enough for enough for us.\n&gt; Could be for you.\n&gt; \n&gt; Alain Ravet\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
