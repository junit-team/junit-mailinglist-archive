I \n&gt; would like to \n&gt; &gt; test successful downloadi=\r\nng and launching of the apps from \n&gt; the server\n&gt; &gt; via WebStart, I guess I=\r\n am looking for WebStartUnit...\n&gt; \n&gt; I think you are /writing/ WebStartUnit=\r\n... although not necessarily.\n&gt; \n&gt; Use me as a virtual pair. Describe how y=\r\nou would test this manually.\n&gt; -- \n\nJ.B.,\n\nWhat I would ideally like is a m=\r\neans to specify from a unit test\nthe URL of a WebStart app. to launch, then=\r\n get back some indication\nof whether it launched OK, or some error codes if=\r\n something went wrong.\nCurrently we have to test this manually by clicking =\r\non each app&#39;s\nlink on the WebStart page and verifying the app. is downloade=\r\nd\nand launched successfully.\n\nI&#39;ve already written some HTTPUnit tests whic=\r\nh test following the links\non our WebStart apps homepage, verifying they&#39;re=\r\n valid and\nreturn JNLP files when clicked.  I&#39;d like to test more than this=\r\n however\nas more than a few times we&#39;ve\nseen problems such as JAR signing p=\r\nroblems, library version mismatches\netc.\nwhich have caused the WebStart lau=\r\nnch to fail.  I&#39;m aware that this\nmay be more in the realm of integration t=\r\nesting than unit testing as\nsuch.\n\nAny more ideas would be appreciated,\nTha=\r\nnks,\nSean\n\n\n",
