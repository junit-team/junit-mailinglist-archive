They reasoned that\nmisplaced components is something that gets found really quickly\nand that can change a lot in reviews so the focused on that everything\n/worked/ and didn&#39;t try to verify the cosmetics.\n\nI don&#39;t know what kind of components you are testing and I can imagine that\nsome type of graphic components can be hard to find valuable asserts for.\nBut I think in general if there is a will there is a way. If you want to\ntest a GUI you figure out how to do it. If you don&#39;t want to test a GUI you\ncollect evidence that it is impossible.\n\nI have found that asking questions and really listening in this situation\ncan help move forward:\n* are automated tests important? Why? Why not?\n* what are the consequences if something doesn&#39;t work?\n* why can&#39;t this be unit tested?\n* is there any part that we can test today? (until we have figured out how\nto test the rest)\n* If it can&#39;t be unit tested, are there any other tools that can be used\nthat would give an acceptable level of certainty?\n* if it can&#39;t be tested how can we know that it works\n* can the process of knowing that it works be repeated by any one\n* can the process be repeated often enough\n* can the process be repeated by anyone? any developer? just one developer?\n\nI think in this case it is a combination of a people-problem and that\ntesting GUI:s is really hard.\nIs there any other developer that disagrees that this can&#39;t be tested?\nI have also realised (better late than ever) that it is more satisfying to\nlook for relative improvements.\nIf we test more stuff today than yesterday than that is a good thing even if\nwe don&#39;t test as much as we\nwould like to test.\n\nI would have liked to give you something concrete but I just sprayed a bunch\nof stuff your way, maybe you can use some of it.\nCheers!\n\n\n\nOn 8/16/06, Altman, Joel G. (JSC-CC)[LM] &lt;joel.g.altman@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;   After forwarding some of the replies I got from my previous question, my\n&gt; GUI programmer posed a further question.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; The point I told you this morning was &quot;DEVELOPING THE GUI INTERFACE&quot;.\n&gt; Here is the Questions you should ask him.\n&gt;\n&gt; Point: Does JUnit have a GUI Development IDE?. With Drag and Drop\n&gt; features?.\n&gt;\n&gt; That&#39;s why I said I am plying with netBeans and/or Java Studio 8. By the\n&gt; way Java Studio 8 is built on netBeans. netBeans do have the Graphical\n&gt; Drag and Drop Features to Build the GUIs Soon, than by laying out the\n&gt; interface by hand.\n&gt;\n&gt; I will be glad if he can tell me how to do this in Junit (point above).\n&gt; I can then forget netBeans or anything else.\n&gt;\n&gt; -Kumar&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Joel Altman\n&gt; Shuttle Training Aircraft Project\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
