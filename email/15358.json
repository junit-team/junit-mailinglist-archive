Since some people see benefit in thinking about frameworks <br/>\nsimilar to JUnit in terms of behavior, and not testing, perhaps there is <br/>\na benefit in cognitive flexibility to leaving the annotation @Before <br/>\ninstead of @BeforeTest.  @BeforeTest is somewhat &quot;hardcoding the <br/>\nmetaphor&quot;.  However, since I&#39;m still contrigued about behavior-driven <br/>\ndevelopment, this is just a whimsical thought.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Do you mean that constraints &#39;double the amount of work for each<br/>\n&gt; implementing class&#39; because you have to implement two methods instead of<br/>\n&gt; one? If so, I don&#39;t think that this is much of a problem since you won&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; write new constraints too often - their power comes from their ability <br/>\n&gt; to be<br/>\n&gt; combined after all.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I also feel that the power comes from expressiveness.  For example, this <br/>\nreal example from a test I wrote looks like what I want to test is the <br/>\nsummaryString() method:<br/>\n<br/>\nassertThat(states.summaryString(), eq(&quot;GREEN 0.0 GREEN 0.5 RED 1.0&quot;));<br/>\n<br/>\nBut it&#39;s really just using summaryString as a testing utility.  I&#39;d be <br/>\ntempted to write this instead, which feels clearer:<br/>\n<br/>\nassertThat(states, summarizeTo(&quot;GREEN 0.0 GREEN 0.5 RED 1.0&quot;))<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the number of lines of code that would have to go into summarizeTo <br/>\nmakes me unsure this is a good idea.  Hmm... unless I used reflection:<br/>\n<br/>\nConstraint summarizeTo(String summary) {<br/>\n    return applyTo(eq(summary), callMethod(&quot;summaryString&quot;));<br/>\n}<br/>\n<br/>\nThat might be promising.  Not sure it&#39;s a win in expressiveness.  It&#39;s <br/>\nbeginning to look really lispy.<br/>\n<br/>\n    David Saff</div>",
