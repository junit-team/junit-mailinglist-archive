There&#39;s some functionality I had built for myself in the land of <br/>\nJUnit 3, and I&#39;m trying to figure out how best to replicate it in JUnit <br/>\n4. Let me explain it in two parts.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first part is something that finds all my tests (by walking the <br/>\nfilesystem) and then runs them.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe second part is a way for me to segregate different sorts of tests so <br/>\nthat I can run them conditionally. I previously used annotations, <br/>\nincluding something akin to the @Ignore annotation that I&#39;m pleased to <br/>\nsee is now included. I also had something like @Category(&quot;slow&quot;), which <br/>\nallowed me to kick slow tests out of the common target that developers run.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the first part, I found this chunk of code, so I didn&#39;t have to <br/>\nwrite that myself:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://burtbeckwith.com/blog/?p=52\">http://burtbeckwith.com/blog/?p=52</a><br/>\n<br/>\nBut now that I&#39;m looking to add the second part to it, it seems awkward <br/>\nenough that I wonder if I&#39;m going about it wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nWithin this structure, it looks like I could use per-class annotations <br/>\nto kick entire classes out of the set of tests to run. But is there a <br/>\nreasonable way I could use annotations on individual methods to include <br/>\nor exclude them from the set of tests to run?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\nWilliam</div>",
