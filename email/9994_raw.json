If I am running tests on the desktop\n&gt; I usually want to stop on the first failure, fix it and move on to the\n&gt; next one.\n\nAgreed.  Context matters.\n\n&gt; If we are running a large set of automated tests for a build of an\n&gt; entire system that has code that spans multiple developers, it may be\n&gt; preferable to complete the entire test with a report of multiple errors\n&gt; that the developers can scurry off with and recreate on their own, one\n&gt; error at a time. On the other hand it some times works out better to \n&gt; run\n&gt; the build tests and stop on the first error, with developers taking\n&gt; turns in the &#39;hot seat&#39; to fix their problem and start the build tests\n&gt; again.\n\nGood point.\n\nAlong the same lines, I have had occasion to use the same single test \nmethod technique with an externalize data file, but allowing for \nmultiple failures to be accumulated.  While looping through the &quot;rows&quot; \nof data, the test method catches AssertionFailedError and adds it to a \ncollection of failures.  When the test suite completes, it dumps out \nany failures that were collected along the way.\n\nMike\n\n\n",
