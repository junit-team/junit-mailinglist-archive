That was my point.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; That&#39;s why I&#39;d rather have JUnit as a core with hooks to plug in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; additional behaviour which is available in additional tools.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I partially agree.  If you have too many additional tools to run a<br/>\n&gt; program, you will have conflicts with versions.  I think that JUnit must<br/>\n&gt; have a framework, a swing interface and a text interface.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I proposed the architecture of &quot;plug-in&quot; modules that will enable other<br/>\n&gt; programmers to write specific &quot;TestResult&quot; modules (using XML,<br/>\n&gt; databases, mail to store the results).  This won&#39;t add complexity to<br/>\n&gt; JUnit and allow a great flexibility.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The plug-in architecture sounds very good to me.
