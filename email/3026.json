You actually asked a specific<br/>\nquestion, which is all I&#39;ve been asking for on this list. You showed<br/>\nevidence of having thought about things. There would be no reason to &quot;flame&quot;<br/>\nyou for that.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you had just removed &quot;And before you flame me...&quot; from your message, I<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t think you were acting like a wiseass.

When I<br/>\nclick the &quot;...&quot; button, it does not show up, but it does in the drop<br/>\ndown list.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny ideas?<br/>\n<br/>\n(And before you flame me, I did search the archives and faq, and have<br/>\ndome some problem solving on my own!)<br/>\n<br/>\n-dave-</div>",
