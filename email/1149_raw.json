You\ncan code all 4 things in the same test case and use an\nassert condition between each step.  You wouldn&#39;t need\nto create a test method for each of theses steps\nunless one step is actually worth testing stand alone.\n\nIn the later case you can create a test method for\nretreive, delete and create.  When you code the create\ntest you will call the retreive test method to verify\nthat the create worked.  If you want to clean up the\ndata that was created you can cap the hole test off\nwith a call to the delete test.\n\n--- Thomas Rynne\n&lt;thomas.rynne-yahoo-groups@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hi, I&#39;ve just started using jUnit and I&#39;m unsure how\n&gt; it should be used\n&gt; I&#39;m testing invoking a method on an object. I want\n&gt; to test that the method \n&gt; didn&#39;t throw any errors, and objects were added to\n&gt; several lists.\n&gt; Do I\n&gt; 1) invoke the method in setUp and have methods\n&gt; testNoErrors, \n&gt; testAddedToList1, testAddedToList2 and a tearDown\n&gt; method which cleans up the affects of the setUp\n&gt; method.\n&gt; 2) keep the same test methods but invoke the method\n&gt; in each test method\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m also having problems with test dependencies. For\n&gt; example, I have a \n&gt; create, retrieve and a delete methods. In order to\n&gt; test that the create \n&gt; method is working I have to use the retrieve method.\n&gt; In order to clean up \n&gt; after I need to use the delete method.\n&gt; Any of these could fail but I&#39;m only testing one. If\n&gt; create does fail \n&gt; retrieve can&#39;t be tested because I need create to\n&gt; work to add test data to \n&gt; retrieve. How do people usually get over this?\n&gt; thanksThomas\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
