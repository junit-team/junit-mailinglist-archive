They are the first users of the production code\n&gt; and if they are hard to write, other production code that uses the code\n&gt; under test will also be hard to write. Development includes thrown\n&gt; exception types (throw specifications). If I write throws Exception at\n&gt; each unit test, I may hide a cumbersome exception specification in the\n&gt; code under test -- in production code I don&#39;t want to have throws\n&gt; Exception attached to every method.\n\nYou&#39;re right: I might hide a cumbersome exception specification, but \nsomething else I do seems to compensate for that, because I can&#39;t \nremember the last time it bit me.\n\nI am confused, though: why does &quot;throws Exception&quot; in a test lead to \n&quot;throws Exception&quot; in production code? That doesn&#39;t happen to me. What \ntypically happens is:\n\n1. I write the test for code that will use code that throws a checked \nexception. I don&#39;t notice.\n\n2. I write the production code, at which point I realize that I need to \ncatch a checked exception, so in my production code, I have this:\n\n....\ncatch (CheckedException wrapped) {\n     throw new RuntimeException(&quot;Something went wrong doing X&quot;, wrapped);\n}\n\n3. I look up the situation under which the code I&#39;m /using/ (not \nwriting) throws CheckedException.\n\n4. I write down exception handling tests on my test list.\n\nI can follow this relatively simple ritual and avoid missing checked \nexception specifications.\n\n&gt; In short terms: I write no throws to my tests, unless the compiler\n&gt; complain, and the more often I have to do that, the more often I think\n&gt; about my throw specifications.\n\nDifferent strokes for different folks. I used to do this, and it seemed \nonly to cost me without benefiting me. Maybe I need to try again.\n-- \nJ. B.
