A testing framework should<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; provide this case, without using another one library.<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; Now you&#39;re making the hard assumption: that what you&#39;re doing is<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; commonly needed. A framework of any kind should solve common<br/>\n&gt; problems<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; and leave unusual ones to extensions. This is the difference<br/>\n&gt; between<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &quot;framework&quot; and &quot;platform&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Dear J.B. Rainsberger,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It is a metter of opinion, the question is simple: ¿Can I change<br/>\n&gt; dinamically during a jUnit test the classpath?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The answer you provide instead of saying NO, :-) is: use Ant. ¿Why?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I am not certain that the answer is &quot;no&quot;, so I did not answer &quot;no&quot;. <br/>\nInstead, I gave you an answer that I thought would help you achieve the <br/>\nresult you wanted.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Under jUnit, I can modify life cicle of the running process in order<br/>\n&gt; to make tests, why not to let the user to alter also some<br/>\n&gt; configuration information for example: classpath (and probably it is<br/>\n&gt; possible, specifying some class loader mechanism, but I am not an<br/>\n&gt; expert on that)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Every framework should decide which features are common enough to build <br/>\ninto the framework and which features should be implemented through <br/>\nextensions. No matter which decision the framework makes, someone will <br/>\nthink it&#39;s wrong. Since frameworks should be as small as possible, it <br/>\nmakes sense to include only those features we are certain should be there.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I don&#39;t like test that depends on IDE&#39;s, because when the project<br/>\n&gt; grows up you end up that is much better to run them under console,<br/>\n&gt; that is why I don&#39;t like to assume specific location of Eclipse<br/>\n&gt; classpath.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I agree, which is why I suggested Ant, which does not depend on any IDE.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ.
