Just include them in the release.\n \n  &gt; Because we have a naming convention where every test \n  &gt; class name begins with\n  &gt; &quot;Test&quot;, it&#39;s also pretty easy to manipulate them when exporting.\n  &gt; Why hide the tests? I&#39;m proud of them! :) And I want them \n  &gt; to be seen right\n  &gt; aside the class they test, so it gives a visual clue that \n  &gt; they need to\n  &gt; follow the evolution of the class. Anyway.... :)\n\n&lt;/snip&gt;\n\n",
