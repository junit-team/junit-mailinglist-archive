Why have two concepts that deal with the\nsame thing. Is it likely that Parameterized will be replaced by Theories\nwhen they become a integral part of Junit?\n\nI do see one difference between them, but this is not made clear in the\ndocumentation. \n\nThe Parameterized runners parametrize the fixture, whereas  Theories \n&quot;parametrizes&quot; the test method.\n\nIs that indeed the difference between them and will they therefore remain\nboth?\n\ntx.,\n\n\n\ntoalexsmail wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; There is 2 runners that did the same work. More precisely, all work\n&gt; that can be done by Parameterized runner can be done by Theories\n&gt; runner. I think it should be consider to refactor their\n&gt; implementations and to write more documentation about use of Theories. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n-- \nView this message in context: http://www.nabble.com/Parameterized-and-Theories-overlaps-tp16004982p20029916.html\nSent from the JUnit - User mailing list archive at Nabble.com.\n\n\n",
