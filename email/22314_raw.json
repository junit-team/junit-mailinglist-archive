I can see your argument, I was in=\r\ndeed trying to avoid the nasty doALotOfWorkToMakeABigThing in a test that j=\r\nust wanted to add assertions to a previous test, but where adding them to t=\r\nhe base test would just have overwhelmed it.\n\nNothing that can&#39;t be solved =\r\n(and made just that little bit too opaque) with another layer of indirectio=\r\nn...\n\nCheers\n\nDuncan\n\n\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, David Saff &lt;david@...=\r\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Duncan,\n&gt; \n&gt; On Fri, Jan 22, 2010 at 1:17 PM, dmcg123 &lt;duncan@=\r\n...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; After over 10 years of using JUnit, it has only just struck=\r\n me that test methods must return void, but why?\n&gt; \n&gt; I can imagine a value=\r\n in _allowing_ certain classes to override the\n&gt; validation behavior, but n=\r\not as much value in loosening the class\n&gt; validation by default.\n&gt; \n&gt; For m=\r\ne, imagine someone writes this as their first JUnit test:\n&gt; \n&gt; @Test public=\r\n boolean threeIsPrime() {\n&gt;   PrimeAnalyzer a =3D new PrimeAnalyzer();\n&gt;   =\r\nreturn a.isPrime(3);\n&gt; }\n&gt; \n&gt; This test is likely to not do what its author=\r\n intended.  Pushing this\n&gt; author to understand how JUnit works a little be=\r\ntter provides value,\n&gt; and I haven&#39;t yet seen a proposal for loosening retu=\r\nrn value\n&gt; restrictions that provides more value.\n&gt; \n&gt; As an example:\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; I&#39;ve just come across an example where a particular test did a lot of wor=\r\nk, and I wanted to piggy-back on its final state by calling the method from=\r\n another test.\n&gt; \n&gt; It seems to me that this pattern would solve this desir=\r\ne, at the cost\n&gt; of just one additional extracted method:\n&gt; \n&gt; private BigT=\r\nhing doALotOfWorkToMakeABigThing() { ... }\n&gt; \n&gt; @Test public void basicBigT=\r\nhing() {\n&gt;   assertEquals(Size.BIG, doALotOfWorkToMakeABigThing().size());\n=\r\n&gt; }\n&gt; \n&gt; @Test public void shrink() {\n&gt;   BigThing thing =3D doALotOfWorkTo=\r\nMakeABigThing();\n&gt;   thing.shrink();\n&gt;   assertEquals(Size.SMALL, thing.siz=\r\ne());\n&gt; }\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Is there any fundamental reason for not allowing me to ret=\r\nurn values? It might even be an opportunity to write an annotation expressi=\r\nng constraints about the value returned.\n&gt; \n&gt; What would be the advantage o=\r\nf writing assertions as annotations\n&gt; rather than plain old Java?\n&gt; \n&gt; Than=\r\nks,\n&gt; \n&gt;    David Saff\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Cheers\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Duncan McGregor\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
