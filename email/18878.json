Sure, my coverage can tell me that a certain part<br/>\n&gt;of my application is tested indirectly, but if I don&#39;t have unit tests for<br/>\n&gt;them, locating the bug will be harder for me since there will be multiple<br/>\n&gt;suspects for the location of the bug.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Consider the following example:  I have to display a sorted list in a web<br/>\n&gt;page, and I only have a functional test that verifies that the HTML is<br/>\n&gt;correct.  My coverage confirms that my ordering logic is run during the<br/>\n&gt;tests.  In this situation, the ordering logic is private and not directly<br/>\n&gt;tested.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;A user reports that the list is not sorted correctly, and now I find myself<br/>\n&gt;with at least two possible locations to investigate:  the HTML generation<br/>\n&gt;and the sorting logic.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;If I had written a test for the private sorting logic, I would know right<br/>\n&gt;away where the bug is.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>True enough, but there&#39;s no particular reason why the logic has to be <br/>\nprivate. I&#39;d be leery of a class that generates HTML and sorts. If the <br/>\nsort is an another class, it can be public and far easier to test.<br/>\n<br/>\nMichael Feathers<br/>\nwww.objectmentor.com</div>",
