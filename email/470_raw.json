I want to use JUnit to test a function which operates on the\n&gt; input, and compare the output of the function with the expected output\n&gt; for each test data pair.\n&gt; \n&gt; I can easily write a test method which will iterate over the test data,\n&gt; but as soon as one piece of test data causes a test failure the test\n&gt; will terminate.  I wish to have a separate JUnit test executed for each\n&gt; line of test data, which will generate information on the proportion of\n&gt; test data instances passed and failed (instead of the current situation,\n&gt; where I only know whether the entire test data set has passed or\n&gt; failed).  In other words, whenever the function fails on a line of test\n&gt; data, I want to increment the failure count, while continuing on to\n&gt; check all the other lines of test data.\n&gt; \n&gt; The only idea that has occurred to me is to write a small program that\n&gt; will generate a JUnit test class based on the test data: that is, it\n&gt; will generate one test function per line of input.  This seems\n&gt; inefficient in terms of code size (I have many thousands of test\n&gt; instances already, and may have several million in the longer term).\n&gt; \n&gt; JUnit is being used throughout the project, so I want to use JUnit for\n&gt; this testing if possible.\n&gt; \n&gt; Can anyone suggest a way to get this working?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Lyndon\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n",
