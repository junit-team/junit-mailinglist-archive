I don&#39;t object to new <br/>\npackage-private classes and methods as part of refactoring, or in <br/>\ninitial design. But we do need to be really clear about distinguishing <br/>\nbetween public and package-private. I don&#39;t think you&#39;ve always been as <br/>\nclear as you think. For instance, here&#39;s a quote from the first message <br/>\nI found from you still in my Inbox:<br/>\n<br/>\n\tWanting to test them is a symptom, to me, of a violation of the SRP.<br/>\n\t Exposing private methods as public, on an appropriate class, helps<br/>\n\tme to avoid SRP-violations, and helps promote reuse to reduce<br/>\n\tduplication.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThe other driver I have to make private methods public is explicitly<br/>\n\tto reduce duplication. For example, maybe it&#39;s you doing the<br/>\n\tString-to-Calendar trick in another class. You know where you did it<br/>\n\tbefore, so you extract it out and reuse it. However, this only works<br/>\n\tbecause you&#39;re familar with what you did earlier - it didn&#39;t work<br/>\n\tfor Jane because she wasn&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat talks about public. Now if by &quot;public&quot; you only meant non-private, <br/>\nthen we don&#39;t really disagree; but can you see why I may have thought we <br/>\ndid? This is a real flaw in Java. I really, really wish there were a <br/>\nstandard word for package-private/package-protected/default <br/>\naccess/whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n﻿Elliotte Rusty Harold  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:elharo@...\">elharo@...</a><br/>\nXML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/\">http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim\">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim</a></div>",
