This assumes that those values are available through \nthe public interface, of course.\n\n&gt; Also, with equals() method I \n&gt; cannot know which data member in the class actually caused a mis-\n&gt; match, since I assert only at the class level.\n\nThis is why you implement toString() to show the value of the object, so that \nyou can see which fields are different.\n\n&gt; This is why I am thinking what to do... hope this clarifies the \n&gt; problem. \n\nIt sounds like you&#39;re simply trying to test something that&#39;s big (not \nnecessarily difficult) and time-consuming. If you want to test the whole thing, \nthen nothing you try will be simpler than implementing equals() and following \nour suggestions. If you don&#39;t mind testing less than the whole thing, then you \ncan check individual fields that you read from XML against known values.\n\nOf course, if you have the power to do so, simplify the object model!\n\nJ.
