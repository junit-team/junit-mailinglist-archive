It would be great with &quot;one API to run them al=\r\nl\nand in darkness bind them&quot; so to speak :) Basically talk to one API to ge=\r\nt\naccess to all the different test frameworks out there. I had an idea alon=\r\ng\nthose lines that focused on the other end sort of. To &quot;just&quot; be a rosetta=\r\n\nstone, but not be the smallest common denominator between all test\nframewo=\r\nrks but rather embrace their differences.\nOne of the big challenges was sta=\r\ntuses and I think my thoughts were along\nthe lines of RDF where one could e=\r\nxpress that things that &quot;pending&quot; is a\nkind of &quot;ignored&quot; for reporting purp=\r\noses but differs in that it is yet to be\nimplemented. Basically I approache=\r\nd things from the reporting side rather\nthan the running side since most te=\r\nst frameworks seem to not want to deal\nwith guis, ide integraton and such b=\r\nut focus on what a test looks like when\nit is written.\n\nWhen I read about J=\r\numi I sort of hoped that Jumi could become this rosetta\nstone... but a more=\r\n ambitious one.\n-----------------------------------------------------\nJoaki=\r\nm Ohlrogge\nAgical AB\nV=E4sterl=E5nggatan 79, 2 tr\n111 29 Stockholm, SWEDEN\n=\r\n\nMobile: +46-708-754004\nBlog: johlrogge.wordpress.com\nTwitter: @johlrogge\nE=\r\n-mail: joakim.ohlrogge@...\n\n\nOn Wed, Jun 22, 2011 at 6:14 PM, Esko Lu=\r\nontola &lt;esko.luontola@...&gt;wrote:\n\n&gt; **\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I had the same issue wit=\r\nh Specsy and used the workaround of running the\n&gt; tests when the Runner&#39;s g=\r\netDescription() or run() method is called the\n&gt; first time.
