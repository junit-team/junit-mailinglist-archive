B. Rainsberger&quot; &lt;jbrains@r...&gt; \nwrote:\n\n&gt; The whole point of JUnit is automate those tests so that you do not \nhave to physically look at the result to verify it. You code what you \nexpect in the test and the test runner tells you whether the results \nmatch your expectations. This is in perfect alignment with the \npurpose of JUnit.\n\nThat is a good thing but there is more than one way to think about \nit. \n \n&gt; There are many reasons to write tests this way. I suggest reading \nthe available literature, especially Kent Beck&#39;s Test-Driven \nDevelopment by Example, http://www.xprogramming.com and \nhttp://www.junit.org.\n\nThanks, maybe you should do some more reading too and listen to other \ndevelopers to expand your perspective to include viewpoints other \nthan your own.\n \n&gt; \n&gt; If JUnit wastes your time, \n\nword twisting, never said that.\n\n&gt;If you think JUnit is beneficial, \n\nI do, and as I indicated I have plenty of experience with automated \ntesting using xUnit.\n\n&gt;then you have to change your approach to work with JUnit. If you \nwant to do something slightly different than JUnit, then you have to \nfind that or build it yourself.\n&gt; \n&gt; I think those are your options.\n\nHow about just hacking junit? Make it do something the designers \nnever intended. That&#39;s another option.\n\n\n\n",
