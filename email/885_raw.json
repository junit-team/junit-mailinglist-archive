Suite, generally, can include tests\n&gt; from several classes and then it would be nice to have *basic*\n&gt; tests from all classes grouped together.\n\nAh, so you mean the ability to, say, &quot;run all &#39;basic&#39; tests only&quot;\nor something like that?\n\n&gt; Now maybe some core XP funs will curicify me, but I see\n&gt; it useful to have a possibility to define dependencies between\n&gt; those above metnioned groups of tests with the same complexity level.\n&gt; I like the TestRunner which will skip more complex tests, when\n&gt; some basic tests fail. Note, that for testing some large products\n&gt; the test can take 1 hour or more. Why should I wait for\n&gt; such a long time just to know that some basic test failed and\n&gt; thus all others depending on it failed too.\n\nI typically create one test method per app method, and that test method\ncontains a number of asserts, rising in complexity.  The first one that\nfails causes the rest of the test to be bypassed.\n\nI avoid writing tests that are order-dependent to the point that #2\nfails if #1 is run after instead of before.  IE database tests where\ntest 1 adds stuff and test 2 deletes it.  I&#39;d have test 1 add stuff,\nthen leave it, and have test 2 add new stuff, delete the new stuff.\nThe tearDown() method would delete #1&#39;s leftovers, or #1 could do it\nitself within a try/catch block so that a failure here doesn&#39;t false-fail\nthe add test but prints the exception to stdout or stderr for reference.  \n\nI just try to order by complexity so that if a pile of stuff fails, I can\nstart working from the top of the list downwards, and dependent failures\ndisappear in the next test run.\n-- \nJoi Ellis                    Software Engineer\nAravox Technologies          joi@..., gyles19@...\n\nNo matter what we think of Linux versus FreeBSD, etc., the one thing I\nreally like about Linux is that it has Microsoft worried.
