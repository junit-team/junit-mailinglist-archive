Thanks.\n\nI am afraid JUnit won&#39;t do that for you.  However, I am pretty sure that you can do it through java.lang.Runtime yourself.  You&#39;ll need two\nclasses.  The first class create one run time instance for each test and passing the name of the test as parameter, the second class can have a\nmain method that will call different test method depending on the different parameters passed in.\n\nIn this way, you have a main process that spawns different testing processes.\n\nHope this helps.\n\n--\nDisclaimer:  I join all the news groups out of my own interest.

Each test will start the\n&gt; application, login, and test a specific piece of functionality. At the start\n&gt; of each test I call the application&#39;s main() method, and at the end I call\n&gt; it&#39;s shutdown() method. The application was not designed such that main() can\n&gt; be called multiple times. Doing so leads to duplicate daemon threads, and\n&gt; painfull initialization problems. Also, each test needs to start with an\n&gt; initialized data base.\n&gt;\n\n\n",
