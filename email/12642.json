There was one thread that seemed <br/>\nto be in the right vein, but didn&#39;t actually have an answer.<br/>\n<br/>\n=============<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally - my question:<br/>\n<br/>\nIs there an automated way to output the summary data (#tests, <br/>\n#errors, #failures) from my JUnit Report to an external file <br/>\n(possibly xls, or a file accessible by spreadsheet) in order to <br/>\nmaintain a history of our results?<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the ideal world, there would never be any errors or failures, but <br/>\nthe point of the testing is to make us confident in making code <br/>\nchanges.  We run a nightlybuild regression, so the next morning I <br/>\ncan see if I missed anything (sometimes the failures are well <br/>\nremoved from the actual class that was changed).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, we would like to be able to record historical data of the <br/>\nfluctuations.  In the past, manually, we have found that the <br/>\nerrors/failures go up when we get above a certain velocity.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for any insight that can be provided.<br/>\n<br/>\nDianne Doss</div>",
