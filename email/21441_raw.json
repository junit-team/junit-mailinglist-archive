Bu=\r\nt I&#39;m not sure if I should use the DirectoryBuilder, or if I should manuall=\r\ny maintain a class that launches my tests, or use annotations.\n\nIt looks li=\r\nke there is a way to simply annotate the classes I want to run and then to =\r\nbe able to kick off various test suites. But the docs don&#39;t have many examp=\r\nles of this. And it seems like there are many ways to do the same thing.\n\nT=\r\nhe cookbook just mentions using JUnitCore.runClasses(TestClass1.class, ...)=\r\n, but that doesn&#39;t seem very extendable.\n\nI&#39;m just looking for a simple bes=\r\nt practice. I&#39;d like to not have to update a main() method each time I want=\r\n to add a new test class. I&#39;d like to simply kick off one or another suite =\r\nof test classes from my IDE in most cases and get a nicely printed result p=\r\nrinted to the console.\n\nThanks!\nDavid\n\n\n\n",
