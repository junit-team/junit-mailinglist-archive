That&#39;s pretty subjective.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Ok.  I  can buy that.  Of course I have worked on small to medium\n&gt;&gt;projects that tried to incorporate almost every pattern under the\n&gt;&gt;sun--many times causing more bulk than necessary.  That is why I\n&gt;&gt;termed it &quot;overuse&quot;, although &quot;inappropreate use&quot; applies better.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;d call that inappropriate.. using patterns for the sake of using\n&gt; patterns.. and likely in the contest of BDUF, right?  Have you read\n&gt; Joshua Kerievsky&#39;s &quot;Refactoring to Patterns&quot;?  It explores/catalogs\n&gt; refactorings that move you to/toward patterns.\n\n\nBDUF?  And, no I haven&#39;t read that book.\n\n&gt;&gt;As to what you are referring to as a Fixture, I am not exactly sure.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; A fixture is the situation in which a test expects to run. \n&gt; Specifically, it&#39;s what setUp() builds.\n\nok.\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;TestSuite is a mechanism for grouping a collection of TestCase instances\n&gt;&gt;&gt;and running them sequentially.  So, TestCase has the ability to create a\n&gt;&gt;&gt;TestSuite containing all instances of itself (using reflection to create\n&gt;&gt;&gt;an instance for each constituent test).  Also, you have the ability to\n&gt;&gt;&gt;create explicit TestSuites by subclassing TestSuite and writing a custom\n&gt;&gt;&gt;suite() method.  This is useful for collecting together groups of\n&gt;&gt;&gt;smaller TestSuites which can be other custom TestSuites, or TestSuites\n&gt;&gt;&gt;generated by TestCases.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;That&#39;s the thing.  The TestSuite, while theorhetically a nice feature,\n&gt;&gt;adds too much.  You also run the risk/temptation to write tests that\n&gt;&gt;require to be run in a specific order to pass.  If the order is changed,\n&gt;&gt;or unpredictable, you have to write more robust tests.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; All tools involve a certain amount of risk and/or temptation.  It&#39;s a\n&gt; matter of using it properly.\n\ntrue.\n\n&gt;&gt;Nine times out of ten, all you really need is a TestCollector.  The\n&gt;&gt;collector finds all your tests, and runs them.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Very true. And that&#39;s easy enough to write.  In fact there&#39;s\n&gt; RecursiveTestSuite by Mike Bowler (http://gsbase.sourceforge.net) that\n&gt; does that.\n\nI use Ant, which does that very well.\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Both TestSuite and TestCase implement the Test interface. The\n&gt;&gt;&gt;TestRunners work with things that are Tests, hence we can point at any\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Test (ie TestSuite or TestCase) and recursively run all the contained\n&gt;&gt;&gt;tests.  The internal nodes are TestSuites and the leaves are TestCases.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Yes, but what happens if you don&#39;t want to extend either TestCase or\n&gt;&gt;TestSuite?  What happens if you want to access Assert from TestSuite?\n&gt;&gt;The contracts are with the *implementations* of the Test interface,\n&gt;&gt;and not with the Test interface itself.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; You can always just implement Test and use Assert.  \n\nI am not confident with Test&#39;s contracts.  They are not clear enough for\nme.\n\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;I hope that makes things clearer.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;What about the other points I had?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I only said I&#39;d address that one :-)\n\nOk.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Why not rewrite JUnit the way you are envisioning and see how it works &\n&gt; how people like it?  Nobody said you *HAVE* to use JUnit.\n\nI like JUnit for the most part.  It&#39;s those boundary cases where JUnit\nshows its limitations.  IMO the boundaries should be a little bit wider.\n\nAny way, if you want to pay me to do the work, I will be happy to do it.\nUntil then I have other projects and bigger &quot;itches&quot; to scratch that\ntake up my time--not to mention raising a family, my day job, and my\nother hobbies.\n\n\n-- \n\n&quot;They that give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety\n  deserve neither liberty nor safety.&quot;\n                 - Benjamin Franklin\n\n\n",
