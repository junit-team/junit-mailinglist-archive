There&#39;s well documented solutions.  Look it up.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; I had a short discussion with &lt;I forget&gt; at OOPSLA last week about the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; recurring questions of &quot;how would I evolve &lt;insert well known\n&gt;&gt;&gt; algorithm here&gt; using TDD&quot;.  Well.. you don&#39;t have to... it&#39;s well\n&gt;&gt;&gt; known.. just use it.  Write a few tests to make sure you have it typed\n&gt;&gt;&gt; in correctly and that it keeps working.. but I see no reason to evolve\n&gt;&gt;&gt; algorithms I learned in University from a text.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Might be good exercise, though.\n\n&gt; Especially if you&#39;re trying to prove to yourself that the method either \n&gt; will or will not work, or (assuming it will) that you&#39;re using it \n&gt; correctly to lead you to the known result.  Certainly a valid control \n&gt; experiment before trying it in the wild :)\n\nYes. Although the 8 Queens problem isn&#39;t really much about programming, and\nis a lot about conceptualizing. I think it&#39;s a good exercise, but perhaps\nnot the best for &quot;proving&quot; whether TDD works.\n\nRon Jeffries\nwww.XProgramming.com\nThe greatest mistake we make is living in constant fear that we will make one.\n  --  John Maxwell\n\n\n",
