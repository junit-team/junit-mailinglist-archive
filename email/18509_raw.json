But to really test it, I need to\nretrieve it afterwards and m=\r\nake sure it was successfully created.  And\nI need to clean it up afterwards=\r\n (or the test will fail next time I\nrun it and try to create a duplicate), =\r\nso I call my delete method. \nThere I&#39;ve exercised 3 methods of my DAO, not =\r\njust one.  So it feels\nlike it would save time to assert that each step of =\r\nthe process\nsucceeded.  \n\nExample:\n  public void testEmployeeCRUD()\n  throw=\r\ns Exception\n  {\n\tint sizeBeforeAdding =3D em.listEmployees().size();\n\t_empl=\r\noyeeId =3D em.createEmployee(_fname, _lname, _jobtitle);\n\t\n        int size=\r\nAfterAdding =3D em.listEmployees().size();\n        log.debug(&quot;Created emplo=\r\nyee &quot; + _employeeId);\n        //Make sure that the new list is longer than =\r\nthe old list\n\tassertTrue(&quot;Create employee failed&quot;, sizeAfterAdding&gt;sizeBefo=\r\nreAdding);\n               \n        Employee emp =3D em.getEmployee(_employe=\r\neId);\n        assertEquals(&quot;getEmployee failed&quot;, emp.getLName(), _lname);\n =\r\n       log.debug(&quot;Retrieved employee &quot; + emp.getLName());\n                \n=\r\n        em.deleteEmployee(emp);\n                \n        int sizeAfterDelet=\r\ne =3D em.listEmployees().size();\n                \n        //Make sure that =\r\nthe length of the list after delete \n        //is the same as it was before=\r\n we added\n        assertEquals(&quot;Delete employee failed&quot;, sizeAfterDelete,\ns=\r\nizeBeforeAdding);\n        log.debug(&quot;Deleted employee&quot;);\n    }\n\nThe precedi=\r\nng code works just fine.  If the test fails, I&#39;d look in\nthe failure messag=\r\ne to see which part of it failed, and it seems like\nthat&#39;s not too difficul=\r\nt.  I know it&#39;s not following best practices\nbecause it calls 4 separate me=\r\nthods, but when I tried writing a test\nfor each of those methods, I ended u=\r\np either calling the other ones in\nthe setup/teardown or by essentially rec=\r\nreating them in a sample data\nloading operation.  I&#39;m trying to do good TDD=\r\n and to convince a\ncolleague who resists unit tests at all, so I don&#39;t want=\r\n to do things\n&quot;wrong&quot; but I also don&#39;t want to make life tremendously more =\r\ndifficult\nwithout understanding the real reason behind the recommendations.=\r\n\n\nDoes anyone have any thoughts on this principle?  I appreciate the\nintell=\r\nigent exchanges I&#39;ve seen on the list in the past so I hope to\nget a though=\r\ntful discussion going.\n\nThanks very much!\nJulie\n\n\n",
