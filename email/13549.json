Voice Recognition system: takes orders from client<br/>\nand posts request to a Servlet<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Messenger Servlet: Takes HTTP request from Voice<br/>\nsystem and publishes message (JMS using Oracle<br/>\nadvanced queues) to a queue. (Publish/Subscribe model)<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Uniface based Billing/Order management system: <br/>\nPicks messages from the queue and process the payment<br/>\ninformation. Then publishes another message to a<br/>\ndifferent queue(say B). <br/>\n<br/>\n4. third party gateway [in java]: picks up these<br/>\nmessages from the queue (B) and makes a webservice<br/>\ncall to a third party. Gets response and publishes<br/>\nback a message to queue C (separate response queue)<br/>\n<br/>\n5. Message passed back through same path and servlet<br/>\nresponds.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, everyone had their own way of testing, and the<br/>\nonly possible integration tests were manual. The<br/>\nBilling system and the voice system were limited in<br/>\nthe level of unit testing we could do (or atleast I<br/>\ncouldnt suggest them much as they aren&#39;t in Java)<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, I would have liked to see a more consistent<br/>\ntesting strategy being used for components 2 and 4<br/>\nabove. <br/>\n<br/>\nDoes anyone have any suggestions as to how they would<br/>\napproach testing these?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nTandy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t<br/>\n\t<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n___________________________________________________________ <br/>\nYahoo!
