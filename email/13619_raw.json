Until we can measure that \nsomewhat objectively, neither one of us can say more than &quot;I don&#39;t agree \nwith him&quot;. As long as we agree not to say, &quot;He&#39;s wrong; what an idiot!&quot; \nthen I&#39;ll be very happy. So far, he doesn&#39;t appear to have called me \nwrong or an idiot, and I certainly haven&#39;t done that to him.\n\nI&#39;m intrigued by extreme heuristics like &quot;all code should be either \ntested or deleted&quot;. I suppose I should try that on a project and see \nwhat happens. Maybe I&#39;ll be pleasantly surprised.\n-- \nJ. B.
