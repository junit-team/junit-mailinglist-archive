Why make the effort to<br/>\n&gt; create a protected method that more than likely will never be used or<br/>\n&gt; will be used so rarely it won&#39;t even pay back the complexity cost of the<br/>\n&gt; extra JavaDoc? Designing for subclassing is hard. It takes roughly three<br/>\n&gt; times as much effort as designing a final class, maybe more. Most <br/>\n&gt; non-final classes in the wild are fundamentally broken. Of course <br/>\n&gt; sometimes you do need subclasses, but don&#39;t go adding extension points<br/>\n&gt; willy-nilly until you&#39;re ready to design them properly, document them<br/>\n&gt; fully, consider their implications for other dependent methods, and do<br/>\n&gt; all the other hard work required to create a truly extensible class.<br/>\n&gt; Java erred by not making final the default, but there&#39;s no reason we<br/>\n&gt; have to repeat its mistakes.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, OK, but what makes private automatically better than<br/>\nprotected? I have to put some word there. What harm does it do to<br/>\nsay protected, or even public?<br/>\n<br/>\nI answer that it depends a great deal on what the code is trying to<br/>\nbe. If a bunch of us are writing some application in XP style, then<br/>\nwhy not leave it wide open? No harm is likely to come from it.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, if we&#39;re publishing a library, then more privacy<br/>\nand more thinking is probably called for.<br/>\n<br/>\nRon Jeffries<br/>\nwww.XProgramming.com<br/>\nRon gave me a good suggestion once. -- Carlton (banshee858)</div>",
