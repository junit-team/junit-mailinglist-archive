I have an (signed) applet, that will download some jar \nfiles over the net and store them on disk. The applet will also \ncreate its  own classloader, which will be associated with the \ndirectory where the jar files (including the file containing the test \ncase) are stored. The last thing the applet will do, is to call a \nmethod in some predefined class. It is in this class that I am trying \nto start JUnit, with a call to TestRunner. The problem is that if \nJUnit starts its own CL - which, if I understand correctly, is a CL \ndirectly under the System CL - there is no way that JUnit CL will \nfind the test case class. Is there any way around this?\n\nCheers, Jonas\n\n\n\n",
