When I use the eclipse \nplugin to run the test, it seems to be working just fine. But when I \nuse the ANT, it says the BUILD failed and it does not execute the \nThread.sleep line in one of the tests. Does anyone know why is it \ndoing that? Any help on this matter would be really appreciated.\nThanks in advance!\nAbhishek \n\n\n\n",
