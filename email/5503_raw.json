I believe the class I&#39;m trying to \n&gt; test will be extending Applet, if that helps.  As far as which \n&gt; JavaScript environment...not sure I understand what you mean by \nthat, \n&gt; but I&#39;ll probably be targeting IE 5.5+ and NS 6.0+ as far as \nbrowser \n&gt; compatibility goes.\n&gt; \n&gt; As to which JSUnit I downloaded...I didn&#39;t know there were that \n&gt; many...I&#39;ll have to go take a look at them. :)\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; \n&gt; -Eric\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In junit@y..., &quot;Schaible, Jorg&quot; &lt;joerg.schaible@g...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Hi Eric,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Has anyone written unit tests trying to use the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; netscape.javascript.JSObject?  I&#39;ve been poking around, but \n&gt; haven&#39;t \n&gt; &gt; &gt; found a good way to create one containing the values I want.  \nOf \n&gt; &gt; &gt; course they would just *HAVE* to make it final, so I couldn&#39;t \n&gt; extend \n&gt; &gt; &gt; it. :p\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I have downloaded the latest JSUnit, so if that&#39;s the route I \n&gt; will \n&gt; &gt; &gt; have to take, just let me know.  And, if you&#39;ve used JSUnit to \n&gt; write \n&gt; &gt; &gt; tests for a class using JSObject, please drop me some hints. :)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Can you describe exactly what you want to test and which \nJavaScript\n&gt; &gt; environment you use? Also *which* JsUnit did you consider? \n&gt; Xprogramming.com\n&gt; &gt; lists 4 different.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; Jorg\n\n\n",
