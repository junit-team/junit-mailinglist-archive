Sounds like you have your &quot;Designer&quot; hat on. That wasn&#39;t what I<br/>\n&gt; understood to be the context of the question. &quot;How do I test a private<br/>\n&gt; method&quot; is a question someone wearing their &quot;Tester&quot; hat would ask.<br/>\n&gt; Given that context, my mind hasn&#39;t changed. If the private method is<br/>\n&gt; already tested through an existing public method then you don&#39;t need<br/>\n&gt; to do anything. In fact, exposing the method and writing an explicit<br/>\n&gt; test against it is duplication.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Is it really?<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst: the question &quot;How do I test this private method&quot; is a trigger<br/>\nto me to swap out to my Designer hat - it means that there&#39;s an<br/>\nabstraction that&#39;s worth taking out.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond: if it&#39;s already tested _enough_, then there is no need to test<br/>\nit, is there? But I don&#39;t know why I would ask that question if it&#39;s<br/>\nalready tested enough.<br/>\n<br/>\nThirdly: if it&#39;s not tested enough, then exposing the method and<br/>\nwriting new tests is not duplication - in fact, it can significantly<br/>\nreduce duplication by removing the need to duplicate extraneous setup<br/>\nwork.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobert.</div>",
