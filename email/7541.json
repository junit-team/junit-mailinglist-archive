Using JTest is in the same category as  <br/>\nturning up the warning level on your compiler all the way. It allows  <br/>\nyou to flag &quot;unsafe&quot; constructs and finds things which are likely to be  <br/>\nerrors, but no automated tool can judge intention, so they cannot find  <br/>\nreal design errors. Unit Testing does not find these errors either per  <br/>\nse, but the *process* of Unit Testing and TDD uncovers them. Take the  <br/>\nfollowing piece of (pseudo) code:<br/>\n<br/>\n/**<br/>\n  * @post return =  x * i<br/>\n  */<br/>\npublic int f(int x, int i)<br/>\n{<br/>\n     return x * i;<br/>\n}<br/>\n<br/>\nIs this code right? Who knows? What is it *supposed* to do? No  <br/>\nautomated tool can tell you that the return value should actually  <br/>\ncontain the *sum* of x and i. The only way to figure that out is to try  <br/>\nto use the code in a unit test and realize you cannot connect the  <br/>\npieces you wish to connect or that you are getting the wrong answer.<br/>\n<br/>\nA tool can generate &quot;automated&quot; test cases for the above, and those  <br/>\ntools will generate data to test the post-condition. Of course both the  <br/>\ncode *and* the postcondition are wrong. They often will be because they  <br/>\nare cut and pasted from the code. In many cases, the postcondition  <br/>\ncannot be expressed any more succinctly than the code itself.<br/>\n<br/>\nA tool cannot automate testing because a tool does not have access to  <br/>\nthe human context in which the code makes sense (or fails to). Unit  <br/>\ntesting tends to uncover these errors in profusion. Often it is not  <br/>\neven that test cases fail but that the errors are noticed when the test  <br/>\ncases are being written and a serious mistake is uncovered. Test-First  <br/>\nDesign makes this process more efficient by preventing the faulty code  <br/>\nfrom being written in the first place.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the largest advantages of TDD, therefore, is the switch in  <br/>\nfocus, from inside to outside. Writing the test cases forces one to  <br/>\nlook at the code being written from the point of view of the caller and  <br/>\nnotice errors which are not apparent from the narrow context of the  <br/>\ncode itself. Automated tools do not facilitate this thought because  <br/>\ntheir stated purpose is to remove the need to think about the issues.  <br/>\nTheir only context is internal. And so, the issues are not thought  <br/>\nabout and the coding happily continues right off a cliff.<br/>\n<br/>\nAutomated tools are useful, but they do not replace discipline and  <br/>\nprocess.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;javainsel&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:javainsel@...\">javainsel@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, April 03, 2003 9:56 AM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: [junit] About the value of JUnit<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; I am not working for Parasoft and I am completely serious.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; So don&#39;t assert false about me.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; JTest sounds very good to me, and I will test whether it will help<br/>\n&gt;&gt; our team to be more productive than using JUnit instead.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; This article is very interesting:<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-03-2001/jw-0323-lw-jtest.html\">http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-03-2001/jw-0323-lw-jtest.html</a><br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; No, I&#39;m not the author of that article!<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
