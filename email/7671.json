An &#39;inner&#39; class <br/>\nMUST be bound to an instance of the outer class, and thus can&#39;t be <br/>\nstatic.  What you are talking about here I think is referred to as a <br/>\n&#39;nested&#39; class.  Which is declared exactly like you would expect a <br/>\n&#39;static inner class&#39; to be declared if that&#39;s what it was called:-).  I <br/>\nremember hearing the term &#39;top level nested class&#39;  I think it was in <br/>\nan article on jRoundup.com.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know, not exactly relevant to the discussion.. I&#39;ll get back to work <br/>\n:-)<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t recall anyone mentioning that if for some reason you need <br/>\naccess to a private member to do your test. E.g. to verify internal <br/>\nstate of your object that is not easily verifiable via public or <br/>\nprotected methods, then a inner class would help.  I&#39;m new to Unit <br/>\nTesting so there is probably something else that is wrong with that <br/>\n:-).  It seems that there are occasionally valid reasons to do that <br/>\nthough.<br/>\n<br/>\nScott<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Wednesday, April 9, 2003, at 04:25 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Are static inner classes actually a member variable... </span></blockquote></div>",
