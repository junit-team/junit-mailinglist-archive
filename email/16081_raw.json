So I may pick a smal=\r\nl-sized project to try and find out\nfrom the real coding / testing. \n\nCheer=\r\ns, \n- Frank\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, C=C3=A9dric Beust =E2=99=81=7F  =\r\n&lt;cbeust@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Fascinating questions, Frank :-)\n&gt; \n&gt; A few thought=\r\ns.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;    - Will thorough testing make the project take longer?  Of cou=\r\nrse it\n&gt;    will.  Either in time or in programmers.  After all, we are\ntal=\r\nking about\n&gt;    writing more code, so the number of man.months is going to =\r\ngo up as\n&gt;    well.\n&gt; \n&gt;    The way to solve this problem is to include tes=\r\nting in the planning\n&gt;    and project features and deadlines accordingly, b=\r\nut for having\nbeen there as\n&gt;    well, I agree that it&#39;s not always possibl=\r\ne.\n&gt; \n&gt;    - Using debuggers less might be a good thing *if* the developers=\r\n find\n&gt;    bugs faster.  I have seen quite a few TDD enthusiasts choose not=\r\n\nto use\n&gt;    debuggers for dogmatic reasons (&quot;because I read it in a book&quot;)=\r\n\nand then\n&gt;    spend hours writing tests or even println&#39;s trying to reprod=\r\nuce a\nmysterious\n&gt;    bug that a breakpoint would have caught in a few minu=\r\ntes.\n&gt; \n&gt;    Again, the solution here is to be pragmatic:  you have two too=\r\nls at\n&gt;    your disposal (testing and debugger), both with their pros and\nc=\r\nons, and\n&gt;    you&#39;d be a fool to choose to use only one.\n&gt; \n&gt; --\n&gt; Cedric\n&gt;=\r\n http://testng.org\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
