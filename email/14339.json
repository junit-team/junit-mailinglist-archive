How to test it with junit.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\nWell...  the method is also probably doing other interesting things<br/>\nthat you /can/ verify (like changing the state of some other object or<br/>\nsome such).<br/>\n<br/>\nYou may want to look into verifying that a particular state change<br/>\nworked out as per your expectations.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomething else you may want to try is what Martin Fowler refers to as<br/>\ninteraction-based testing (depending on how involved the test is).<br/>\n<br/>\n(Let me find that link... here it is:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html)\">http://martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html)</a><br/>\n<br/>\nHere you&#39;re not so interested in testing that a certain state has been<br/>\nupdated correctly, but more so that the messages passed between<br/>\ndifferent objects during an interesting use case have been fired in<br/>\nthe right order.<br/>\n<br/>\nRead the article, there&#39;s a lot more there.  It&#39;s definitely worth<br/>\nyour time (as is most of his material  :)).<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care,<br/>\n<br/>\n-<br/>\nChristian Leskowsky </span></blockquote></div>",
