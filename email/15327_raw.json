The private method relies =\r\non external resources that are not available during unit testing (i.e. Torq=\r\nue/DBMS).\n\n \n\nMy question was not how to find an unknown failure, but how t=\r\no eliminate a known failure caused by an external dependency buried inside =\r\na private method.\n\n \n\nFor public/protected method dependencies, I extend th=\r\ne class under test and override and simplify those methods.  Unfortunately,=\r\n this doesn=E2=80=99t work for private methods.\n\n \n\nI think the answer is t=\r\no refactor the private method to support some form of dependency injection =\r\nso I can insert mock objects that eliminate the exception.\n\n \n\nMy question =\r\nwas whether they may be a better/more efficient approach?\n\n \n\nThanks again =\r\nfor your help.\n\n-Mitch\n\n \n\n  _____  \n\nFrom: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:j=\r\nunit@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of Elliotte Harold\nSent: Monday, October 31=\r\n, 2005 5:11 PM\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: Re: [junit] Private metho=\r\nd throws an exception\n\n \n\nJ. B. Rainsberger wrote:\n\n&gt; If you have a failing=\r\n test, but you aren&#39;t sure why it fails, and you \n&gt; suspect the problem is =\r\nin a private method, what do you generally do?\n\nIf I have a failing test th=\r\nat fails because an exception is thrown out \nof a private method, I debug i=\r\nt. First off I eyeball the code both in \nthe private method and the public =\r\nmethod being tested. Most of the time \nthe reason for the failure is obviou=\r\ns. If it&#39;s not, I&#39;ll generally set a \nbreakpoint or two and step through th=\r\ne code in the debugger and watch \nwhat actually happens. This is a lot more=\r\n productive than guessing at \nwhat the problem might be. If I could guess r=\r\night, then I wouldn&#39;t need \nto step through it.\n\nIt used to be common in qu=\r\nality code to do a code review by stepping \nthrough the entire program in a=\r\n debugger. This tended to reveal a lot of \nsurprises about how the code was=\r\n really working. This technique has \nfallen out of favor as applications gr=\r\new larger. It&#39;s really impractical \ntoday. However, when something is going=\r\n wrong in a known piece of code \nnothing beats single stepping through it i=\r\nn a debugger. This almost \nalways points me to the exact statement where wh=\r\nat I think the code is \ndoing diverges from what the code is actually doing=\r\n.\n\nThis requires that the bug is consistently reproducible and I have a \nte=\r\nst that reproduces it. However, once I&#39;ve got that I&#39;m good to go. \nWriting=\r\n hypothetical tests for what I think the bug might be only works \nif the bu=\r\ng is so obvious that I can eyeball it in the first place. The \ntricky bugs =\r\nare the ones where everything looks like it should work and \nI can&#39;t see wh=\r\ny it doesn&#39;t. That&#39;s when I need to isolate the problem \nmore closely than =\r\na test method can. I need to find out which statement \nis failing, not whic=\r\nh method is failing. I already know the answer to \nthe latter question.\n\nIf=\r\n the bug proves to be deep inside another piece of code, then I might \nlate=\r\nr add a second test that aims more closely at the bug. However, \nthat&#39;s onl=\r\ny done after I&#39;ve identified the bug, and often I don&#39;t even \nbother to do =\r\nthat. After all, there&#39;s already at least one test for the \nissue.\n\n-- \n=EF=\r\n=BB=BFElliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nXML in a Nutshell 3rd E=\r\ndition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/\nhttp://www.=\r\namazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=3D0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=3Dnosim\n\n\n\nSPONSOR=\r\nED LINKS \n\n\nBasic &lt;http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=3Dms&k=3DBasic+programmin=\r\ng+language&w1=3DBasic+programming+language&w2=3DComputer+programming+langua=\r\nges&w3=3DThe+c+programming+language&w4=3DList+of+programming+languages&w5=\r\n=3DSoftware+programming+language&w6=3DJava+programming+language&c=3D6&s=3D2=\r\n01&.sig=3DFYA-NOGpqiz3yaZkl17TCg&gt;  programming language \n\nComputer &lt;http://=\r\ngroups.yahoo.com/gads?t=3Dms&k=3DComputer+programming+languages&w1=3DBasic+=\r\nprogramming+language&w2=3DComputer+programming+languages&w3=3DThe+c+program=\r\nming+language&w4=3DList+of+programming+languages&w5=3DSoftware+programming+=\r\nlanguage&w6=3DJava+programming+language&c=3D6&s=3D201&.sig=3DsyaAxMqHM6MM6X=\r\nL0yP6ssA&gt;  programming languages \n\nThe &lt;http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=3Dms=\r\n&k=3DThe+c+programming+language&w1=3DBasic+programming+language&w2=3DComput=\r\ner+programming+languages&w3=3DThe+c+programming+language&w4=3DList+of+progr=\r\namming+languages&w5=3DSoftware+programming+language&w6=3DJava+programming+l=\r\nanguage&c=3D6&s=3D201&.sig=3DfsU76jjkUFIN8n6D8OM29g&gt;  c programming languag=\r\ne \n\n\nList &lt;http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=3Dms&k=3DList+of+programming+lang=\r\nuages&w1=3DBasic+programming+language&w2=3DComputer+programming+languages&w=\r\n3=3DThe+c+programming+language&w4=3DList+of+programming+languages&w5=3DSoft=\r\nware+programming+language&w6=3DJava+programming+language&c=3D6&s=3D201&.sig=\r\n=3Du3ZV4Kdrq5uAz4BoBMbYQg&gt;  of programming languages \n\nSoftware &lt;http://gro=\r\nups.yahoo.com/gads?t=3Dms&k=3DSoftware+programming+language&w1=3DBasic+prog=\r\nramming+language&w2=3DComputer+programming+languages&w3=3DThe+c+programming=\r\n+language&w4=3DList+of+programming+languages&w5=3DSoftware+programming+lang=\r\nuage&w6=3DJava+programming+language&c=3D6&s=3D201&.sig=3Da9TXzo-JCRPUCydAj-=\r\neH5g&gt;  programming language \n\nJava &lt;http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=3Dms&k=\r\n=3DJava+programming+language&w1=3DBasic+programming+language&w2=3DComputer+=\r\nprogramming+languages&w3=3DThe+c+programming+language&w4=3DList+of+programm=\r\ning+languages&w5=3DSoftware+programming+language&w6=3DJava+programming+lang=\r\nuage&c=3D6&s=3D201&.sig=3DCTS2kVE3brwRRO0rAjHznA&gt;  programming language \n\n =\r\n\n\n  _____  \n\nYAHOO!
