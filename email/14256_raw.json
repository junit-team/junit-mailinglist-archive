Note the hypothesis above: \n&gt;&gt; &quot;...when you...want to decorate a method&#39;s behavior.&quot; If you \n&gt;&gt; don&#39;t like Decorator, that&#39;s fine, \n&gt; \n&gt; I like Decorators, but most people who use JUnit have no idea what a\n&gt; Decorator is and use JUnit the way it was meant to:  by overriding setUp()\n&gt; and tearDown().\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; But Cedric, what happens when a subclass of SubClass needs to \n&gt;&gt; do even more in its setUp()? \n&gt; \n&gt; Right, this is only a stop-gap measure, but it&#39;s one step better than the\n&gt; current situation.  Here are three ways to solve this problem from worst to\n&gt; best:\n&gt; \n&gt; - Provide setUp() only and ask subclasses to override it.  As we saw, this\n&gt; is littered with problems, very fragile and against basic OO principles.\n&gt; - Provide a template method:  setUp() / onSetUp() and tearDown() /\n&gt; onTearDown().  A bit better but still won&#39;t work very well for classes that\n&gt; extend TestCase more than two levels deep.\n&gt; - Let users annotate these methods instead of relying on their names.  This\n&gt; is the best solution and it solves all the problems (and the reason why I\n&gt; chose it for TestNG).\n\nHi,\n\nAlthough annotating TestCase#setUp and TestCase#tearDown would be a \nreasonably elegant solution (it&#39;s being considered for JUnit 4, no?), \nthe existing method will have to remain for purposes of backwards \ncompatibility anyway. Compatibility with early versions of the JDK has \nalways been one of JUnit&#39;s most attractive features.\n\nCheers,\n\nSteve.\n\n--\nStephen Smith, MEng (Wales)\nhttp://www.stephen-smith.co.uk/\n\n\n\n",
