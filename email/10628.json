I tend to doubt that it comes with an integration for<br/>\nNetBeans, but perhaps you can glue it in there somehow.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour second question has an easy answer: Ant.  I would VERY surprised if the<br/>\ncoverage tools you&#39;ve already mentioned didn&#39;t have Ant integration.  So,<br/>\nit&#39;s not integrated into your IDE, but at least your tests and the coverage<br/>\ntools could run together.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck...<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: ­¸¤M [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:fly_knife_lee@...\">fly_knife_lee@...</a>] <br/>\nSent: Wednesday, March 10, 2004 8:28 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [junit] Code Coverage Analysis Tool<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy team is developing an API, which is not an executable program<br/>\n<br/>\nI would like to ask are there any code coverage analysis tools can be <br/>\nintegrated with JUnit and NetBean?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve tried Rational PureCoverage and JCover, but they both requires <br/>\nan executable test script......so how can I use these tools to <br/>\nintegrate with the test scripts written for JUnit?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nYahoo!
