The assertions\n&gt; that break tell you what the behavioral change was.  If nothing\n&gt; breaks, perhaps that says the test coverage is not sufficient,\n&gt; or the rule change had no practical effect.Paul:\n\nThank you for your comprehensive answer. Let&#39;s presume I&#39;ve reached\nthe stage where I have successfully implemented the rules engine along\nwith a full suite of unit tests. Would I be violating any canons by\nhaving JUnit output its results in some text-like form to enable quick\ncomparisons between result sets of different rules changes ? Is there\na more elegant way to accomplish this ? I&#39;m essentially trying to come\nup with a quick way to tell the user &quot;When you change Rule # 5 that\nway, loans 1, 4 and 7 fail but 2,3 and 89 now pass.&quot;.\n\nThanks again for your help.\n\nRob Rambusch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
