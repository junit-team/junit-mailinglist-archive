I&#39;m in the\n&gt; unfortunate situation of having to write tests for an existing\n&gt; application(I haven&#39;t been involved in the development). �\n\nUnfortunate? This is the standard situation in most processes: Test are\nwritten after development or in parallel to it. What&#39;s so unfortunate about\nwriting tests?\n\nI would recommend that you read Boris Beizer&#39;s &quot;Black Box Testing&quot; -\nalthough I&#39;m still struggling how to integrate its wisdom with modern\ntooling, it is definitely worth to get a grip on &quot;pure testing&quot; (the\n&quot;tester&#39;s job&quot;).\n\nTechnically, I do not see why you shouldn&#39;t be able to write unit tests for\nselected classes with JUnit - if the design is suitable.\n\nBut of course there are many more ways to skin a cat - various xUnit tools;\nbut also GUI testing tools [not for you], load testing tools (very\nexpensive!), and many more.\n\nSo you should first have an concept of \n\n* what you want to test: Functional correctness; but maybe also performance;\nusability; reliability; ...\n\n* to which level of granularity, e.g.\n  - methods of single classes; or of facade classes hiding a complete\n&quot;system&quot;;\n  - single web page clicks, or whole work-flows;\n\n* to which level of quality, e.g.\n  - only critical functions (e.g. defined by &quot;draw most bug reports in the\nlast 3 monts&quot;);\n  - everything to some coverage level; then you need to decide on \n  -- the coverage level (&quot;80%&quot; is in &quot;industry standard&quot;; &quot;100% feasible\ncoverage&quot; is the only sensible standard)\n  -- the type of coverage (code coverage; or some &quot;feature coverage&quot; - all\nthe features down written in some specification or documentation)\n\n... I hope this wasn&#39;t too general ...\n\nRegards\nHarald M.
