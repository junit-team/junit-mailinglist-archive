However, the logic would be more likely that it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; would try every possible way to run the class as a JUnit 3 test, and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; then try JUnit 4 as a fallback (since not all JUnit 4 test classes have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; @Test).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What would happen if I have:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; @Test (expected=Bar.class)<br/>\n&gt; public void testMyFoo () {}<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If we execute junit3 style, it will find this test case, but won&#39;t see<br/>\n&gt; the expected= attribute.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If the class doesn&#39;t inherit from TestCase, then only the JUnit 4 <br/>\nbehavior will work.  If it does, then you should probably disambiguate <br/>\nanyway, for which the suite() method probably makes sense.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Oh, and since I&#39;m talking to another person from a school with a great<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; CS dept ;-), I&#39;m really interested in writing good docs for students<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; on how to write test suites, especially for data structures (the focus<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of the 15-211 course). I have something that I hacked up for our first<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; homework, however, this kind of thing would be great to make into a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; tutorial that could be used by other classes.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Lecture 11 from MIT 6.170 is the best pre-prepared doc I know of around<br/>\n&gt; &gt; here:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Electrical-Engineering-and-Computer-Science/6-170Laboratory-in-Software-EngineeringFall2001/LectureNotes/index.htm\">http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Electrical-Engineering-and-Computer-Science/6-170Laboratory-in-Software-EngineeringFall2001/LectureNotes/index.htm</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;d be very interested in your materials, as well, if they&#39;re publicly<br/>\n&gt; &gt; available.  Thanks,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; That&#39;s pretty interesting. I like the formal introduction to JUnit.<br/>\n&gt; How much experience would the typical person taking this course have?<br/>\n </span></blockquote>For some of them, this is their second programming course (the first <br/>\nbeing based on Scheme)<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; The docs I have for this assignment are:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; An assignment overview<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~bmaurer/15-211/s06/snake/docs/\">http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~bmaurer/15-211/s06/snake/docs/</a> <br/>\n&gt; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/%7Ebmaurer/15-211/s06/snake/docs/\">http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/%7Ebmaurer/15-211/s06/snake/docs/</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; An introduction to testing:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~bmaurer/15-211/s06/snake/docs/testing.html\">http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~bmaurer/15-211/s06/snake/docs/testing.html</a> <br/>\n&gt; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/%7Ebmaurer/15-211/s06/snake/docs/testing.html\">http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/%7Ebmaurer/15-211/s06/snake/docs/testing.html</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I think this documentation is coming in to the idea of testing from a<br/>\n&gt; different angle than the MIT one: my goal here is to enable people to<br/>\n&gt; understand how JUnit will help them for this assignment, rather than<br/>\n&gt; to give the background of &quot;what is testing, why do we do it, etc&quot;.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I like this approach--the goals of a novice (I&#39;ll get a good grade) are <br/>\noften different than those of an expert (my code won&#39;t break the same <br/>\nway it did last time).  However, I&#39;m not sure about the definition of <br/>\n&quot;stress testing&quot; used here: in my lexicon, stress testing has more to do <br/>\nwith replicating adverse environmental conditions (unusually large <br/>\nnumbers of clients, shutdown of the backup database).<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Just for some fun stats about how people are doing on this assignment<br/>\n&gt; so far: about 50 people have submitted a solution for the problem so<br/>\n&gt; far (out of 190 students) -- it is due thursday at midnight (!!!). Of<br/>\n&gt; these people, about 20 pass the tests for the circular buffer based<br/>\n&gt; queue, about 15 pass them for hash table. Glancing over people&#39;s code,<br/>\n&gt; it looks like the people who submitted test cases along with their<br/>\n&gt; code are doing much better on the submission system&#39;s tests (nb:<br/>\n&gt; students are not allowed to see their results on all of our test<br/>\n&gt; cases. So they are &quot;blind&quot; in some ways).<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;d definitely be interested in the final tally.  I&#39;ve done some <br/>\nresearch along similar lines <br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://pag.csail.mit.edu/pubs/ct-user-study-issta2004-abstract.html)\">http://pag.csail.mit.edu/pubs/ct-user-study-issta2004-abstract.html)</a><br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; We&#39;re thinking of some fun ways we can put testing into the course.<br/>\n&gt; For example, I was thinking of giving people partial credit for the<br/>\n&gt; assignment if they 1) wrote a patch for their own code and 2) wrote<br/>\n&gt; test cases that caught their bugs. At dinner last night with another<br/>\n&gt; TA friend, we thought about an assignment where we would give people<br/>\n&gt; .jar files with a broken List/Queue/HashSet/whatever and they would<br/>\n&gt; have to 1) figure out what was wrong and 2) write a test case.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>For 6.170 a couple years ago, I wrote a mutation tester, which would <br/>\nmodify the student&#39;s production code in particular ways, and make sure <br/>\nthat the changes caused their test suite to pass.  It was quite fun, and <br/>\ntook much longer than just eyeballing the test suites.  :-)  Have fun,<br/>\n<br/>\n    David Saff</div>",
