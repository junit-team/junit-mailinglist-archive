Getters and setters are easy to test. Test them! You&#39;ll be \nsurprised how many bugs you&#39;ll find in methods that are supposedly too \nsimple to fail.\n\nThere are a few cases where you really can&#39;t test stuff. In particular \nSometimes you just have to have unreachable code. For instance, I \nsometimes find myself implementing an interface such as \njava.util.Iterator in a private inner class. My private implementation \nmay never call remove() but I still need to implement that method anyway \nto fulfill the contract of Iterator. Normally I just make the method \nthrow an exception, in case I&#39;m wrong and something does call it. \nHowever, there&#39;s just no way to reach it to test it (nor is there any \nneed to do so since this code will never run.) But aside from a few \nweird cases like that, all code should be tested or deleted.\n\n-- \nElliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nXML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim\n\n",
