If the log is important, I have to go through it, or I miss \n&gt;=\r\n something important. If it is not important (and I don&#39;t have to go \n&gt; thr=\r\nough it) I can skip it altogether. So what do you mean when you\nsay I \n&gt; do=\r\nn&#39;t have to go through it?\n&gt; \n\nI have read carefully all the posts so far a=\r\nnd I tend to agree with\nRobert. I am wonder whether I miss something import=\r\nant too.\nI want to be clear, so I will take one step backward. What is the =\r\nMAIN\npurpose of JUnit? The answer is to be able to write AUTOMATIC unit\ntes=\r\nt. Unit test should be written is the correct way, that is\ncorrectly design=\r\n. This has nothing to do with logging. Making unit\ntest AUTOMATIC contradic=\r\nt using logging.\n\n&lt;you can skip the this paragraph&gt;\nI want to step aside fo=\r\nr a while. Let assume that you&#39;re not using\nJUnit at all and write small ma=\r\nin function to test. I don&#39;t want to\ncounter why you shouldn&#39;t do this, let=\r\n focus on what tools you do use\nin this approach. In the most cases you wil=\r\nl add System.out both to\nthe code and to the main. If you&#39;re using C++, for=\r\n instance, you will\nuse preprocessor to switch on or off these output to th=\r\ne console. More\nadvance option will be to use logging mechanism and to chan=\r\nge it\nconfiguration depends on the environment your program run (that is to=\r\n\nturn on many of your log statement only in development). Everything is\ngre=\r\nat until your program is actually fails. Again, from the experience\nit is a=\r\nlmost always the case that existing System.outs are not enough,\nthat you ne=\r\ned more information or you should add some more output\nearly in the code. S=\r\no, in this point you have to option to run your\nprogram AGAIN with debugger=\r\n or to add more System.outs and to run it\nas is. In both cases it can be th=\r\ne case that you should rerun your\nprogram again (if you use debugger you co=\r\nuld simply not pointed out\nwhen some data changed and in the System.out cas=\r\ne you can figure out\nthat you need more System.outs).\n\nFrom the paragraph a=\r\nbove one should conclude that when one write unit\ntest there is 2 different=\r\n phases. First is to write them down in the\nhope that everything will be ok=\r\n (it doesn&#39;t mean, that you design\nshould be poor or you shouldn&#39;t supply a=\r\nppropriate messages to assert\nstatements etc) and the second phase is to re=\r\nrun your test if your\ntest fails. Lets see how logging will help you.\n\nIn t=\r\nhe first phase I see the only purpose using logs is for &#39;sanity\ncheck&#39; that=\r\n is to ensure that you actually test what your think is you\ntest. If you wa=\r\nnt to make something more than just &#39;sanity check&#39; you\nshould write unit te=\r\nst to your unit test, that is pretty silly.\nMoreover, you need to make such=\r\n &#39;sanity check&#39; only when you actually\nwrite this test.  For this purpose l=\r\nogging is appropriate approach, IMHO.\n\nIn the second phase, when you rerun =\r\nyour unit test when it fails, you\nshould consider to add more assert statem=\r\nent and more clearly\ndiagnostic messages first. When you done and you don&#39;t=\r\n see how to\nimprove the design (recall I consider that design is correct) y=\r\nou can\nadd log statement manually. But in this case they will not be part o=\r\nf\nnew mechanism, because no more asserts will be added. So this new\nfeature=\r\n will not be in use!\n\nUsing logging in the assert statement ONLY for &#39;sanit=\r\ny check&#39; is\noverkill, I think. As for me I make such &#39;sanity check&#39; in the\n=\r\nfollowing way. First of all, I use log4j MANUALLY that is as addition\nto JU=\r\nnit asserts. They don&#39;t duplicate what asserts does they supply\nadditional =\r\ninformation, such as what assertion was already done. In\nthis case when ass=\r\nertion will fail afterwards I can look on the log to\nsee in what part of un=\r\nit test it happened and what tests passed. I go\neven further and use JDK 1.=\r\n4 assert statement to document\nprecondition, postcondition and invariants b=\r\noth in the code and in the\nunit test.\n\nThe bottom line is that I see the se=\r\nnse using logs as a COMPLETION to\nthe JUnit and only for &#39;sanity check&#39;. Th=\r\nis use is not duplicates\nJUnit assert statements and could be written manua=\r\nlly.\n\n\n",
