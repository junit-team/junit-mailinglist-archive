ScalaTest is for all\npractical purposes a &quot;JUnit add-on&quot; that facilitates using JUnit and\nScala together. The promise is that by writing tests in Scala, you can\nreduce the lines of test code you need to maintain by half or more,\nand at the same time increase the clarity of that code. That&#39;s the\nbenefit. The up front cost is you need to learn Scala. But ScalaTest\ndoes let you mix in tests written in Scala with your existing tests\nwritten in Java, so it is easy to dip your toe in before jumping in. I\nalso think writing tests in Scala is a good way to start learning and\ngetting experience with Scala, because it is important code, but not\nyour production code. So it reduces the risk of trying a new language.\nAnd you can certainly write tests in Scala to test production code\nwritten in Java.\n\nYou can get a good overview of ScalaTest&#39;s JUnit integration on this page:\n\nhttp://www.scalatest.org/getting_started_with_junit\n\nYou can see we have good integration with both JUnit 3 and 4 (because\nI know many people are still using JUnit 3). One other thing to keep\nin mind is that because of the org.junit.runner.Runner class, which we\nextend in our org.scalatest.junit.JUnitRunner class, you can pretty\nmuch write tests in any style you want and run them with JUnit. For\nexample, you could write in a Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) style\nand still run the tests with JUnit. So ScalaTest adds BDD to JUnit in\neffect, and other styles as well. By annotating with JUnitRunner, you\ncan use JUnit to run tests written with any of the &quot;Suite&quot; or &quot;Spec&quot;\ntraits you see here:\n\nhttp://www.scalatest.org/quick_start\n\nHere&#39;s a list of the ScalaTest/JUnit integration points:\n\n- AssertionsForJUnit, ShouldMatchersForJUnit, and\nMustMatchersForJUnit, which provide concise, readable assertion and\nmatcher DSLs, ensure that assertion failures are reported as\n&quot;failures&quot; not &quot;errors&quot; by JUnit and its ecosystem\n- JUnit3Suite extends junit.framework.TestCase as well as\norg.scalatest.Suite, which allows you to write traditional TestCase\ntests that can be run by either JUnit 3 or ScalaTest\n- JUnitSuite extends org.scalatest.Suite, and allows you to write\ntraditional JUnit 4-style tests (with @Test annotation, etc.) that can\nbe run by either JUnit 4 or ScalaTest\n- JUnitWrapperSuite allows you to run existing JUnit tests written in\nJava (or Groovy, etc.) with ScalaTest&#39;s Runner\n- JUnitRunner allows you to run any ScalaTest Suite written in any\nstyle (such as BDD) with JUnit\n- ScalaTest&#39;s Runner has a -j option that allows you to specify JUnit\ntests written in Java (or Groovy, etc.) and have them run alongside\nScalaTest tests (i.e., so you get one uniform report)\n- ScalaTest&#39;s Ant task can generate the XML format produced by the\nJUnit ant task, which can then be used by JUnitReport ant task,\nHudson, etc., to produce reports.\n\nLet me know if anyone has any questions. I&#39;ll keep an eye on this\nlist, but you might get a quicker response if you cross-post\nJUnit-related ScalaTest questions to the scalatest-users mailing list\nas well.\n\nhttp://groups.google.com/group/scalatest-users\n\nThanks.\n\nBill\n----\nBill Venners\nArtima, Inc.\nhttp://www.artima.com\n\n",
