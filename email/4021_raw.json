In your production code you have to create an instance to,\none way or the other.\n\nMight be something like this:\n\npublic void setUp(){\n\tframework = MotherOfAllFrameworks.getInstance();\n\t// or = new MotherOfAllFrameworks(...);\n\tmyInstance = framework.create(...);\n} \n&gt; Makes this any sense? Perhaps I should practice a bit more \n&gt; with the JUnit framewok to get a better understand about how \n&gt; it could fit. Even more, I should practice more with complex \n&gt; structures in Java to get fluency in my designs - the \n&gt; beginnings are always hard :-).\n\nWell, thats a neverending story for all of us ;-)\n\n",
