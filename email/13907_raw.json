We didn&#39;t announce its availability widely until\nwe thought we had something useful. We have gotten early feedback from a\nhandful of developers, but we now have a release that we think can be used\nto write production tests.\n\nI understand that some people have been quoting our private to-do list out\nof context. Private communication between Erich and me will in future take\nplace more privately. It is too bad that it is not safe to let you all into\nour process. It is disturbing to find one&#39;s to-do-list quoted as promises\nbroken or ideas stolen. It was just an old  to-do list. Maybe it&#39;s time to\ninvest in an electron shredder :-)\n\nThe theme of JUnit 4 is to encourage more developers to write more tests by\nfurther simplifying JUnit. To this end, we have followed NUnit&#39;s lead in\nidentifying tests by annotation instead of subclassing and naming\nconventions. Tests can now live in any class. Tell JUnit they are there with\nthe @Test annotation:\n  @Test public void basicTransaction() {...\n\nThe assertion methods are in an Assert class which is most easily used\nthrough static import:\n  import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;\n  ...\n  @Test public void example() {...assertEquals(2, 2);...}\n\nSet up and tear down are handled with the @Before and @After annotations.\nYou can have as many @Befores and @Afters as you need. Inherited @Befores\nare executed before @Befores in subclasses and inherited @Afters are\nexecuted after @Afters in subclasses.\n\nShared setup is handled by @BeforeClass and @AfterClass. Methods with these\nannotations are executed once before (respectively after) all the tests in\nthe class run.\n\n@Ignore causes a test not to be run, but it is reported as ignored.\n\n@Test takes two optional parameters. A test annotated @Test(timeout=100)\nwill fail if the test takes longer than 100 milliseconds to complete. A test\nannotated @Test(expected=NullPointerException.class) will fail if a\nNullPointerException is not thrown and succeed if a NullPointerException is\nthrown.\n\nPreserving existing investment in tests has taken nearly half of our\ndevelopment effort. JUnit 4 is forward and backward compatible. You can run\nolder tests with the JUnit 4 test runner by passing them to the runner. You\ncan run JUnit 4 tests with older test runners by wrapping the JUnit 4 test\nclass in a compatibility class. The following method in a JUnit 4 test class\ncauses it to run correctly with the Eclipse test runner.\n  public static junit.framework.Test suite() {\n    return new JUnit4TestAdapter(AssertionTest.class);\n  }\n\nJUnit 4&#39;s command line interface can be invoked with:\n  java org.junit.runner.JUnitCore Test1 Test2\n\nThe same interface can be invoked programmatically with:\n  JUnitCore.run(Test1.class, Test2.class);\n\nIf you want to know more about the details of JUnit 4, you can browse the\ntests in org.junit.tests.*.\n\nErich and I will be participating on the JUnit lists to discuss further\nsimplification of JUnit 4, integration with test runners, and experiences\nusing it. Our experience with it (most of the tests were written JUnit 4\nstyle) has been very positive. The complexity of JUnit 3.x is like a tiny\npebble in a shoe. It doesn&#39;t seem like much until it is gone.\n\nGood testing,\n\nKent Beck\nThree Rivers Institute\n\n\n",
