My group uses both<br/>\ntools depending on the project and our specific needs so I honestly<br/>\ncan&#39;t tell you to use one vs the other. ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for Continuum... It comes from the same team working on the Maven<br/>\nbuild tool and is a very nice CI server. It is newer than<br/>\nCruiseControl but there are a number of people using it and working on<br/>\nit etc and the user list is rather active. They are working on v1.1<br/>\nwith a large number of new features etc so its taking some time.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs you mentioned, CruiseControl and Anthill are two other CI servers.<br/>\nMost people I know run CruiseControl; I actually don&#39;t know anyone<br/>\npersonally who runs Anthill, but that doesn&#39;t mean much. I would take<br/>\na look at the various CI server mailing lists, current/planned feature<br/>\nlists, SCM check-ins and bug trackers to get a feel for which one is<br/>\nthe best fit for your team.<br/>\n<br/>\nWayne<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 3/8/07, Niklas Saers &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:niklassaers@...\">niklassaers@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Thanks guys for your many answers. I have a couple of questions<br/>\n&gt; regarding your suggestions:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Céderic and Wayne: TestNG: how mature / well used is this compared to<br/>\n&gt; JUnit? I&#39;ve been using JUnit in a few projects before and see that<br/>\n&gt; lots of people use it. I&#39;ve heared about TestNG before and when<br/>\n&gt; researching my ignore problems I saw it and thought that its<br/>\n&gt; different parameters for @Test looked intriguing. Does JUnit do stuff<br/>\n&gt; that TestNG doesn&#39;t that I should know that I&#39;m sacrificing should I<br/>\n&gt; switch to TestNG?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Continuum 1.0.3 is considered a preview release from its<br/>\n&gt; documentation and was released a year ago. This tells me that it is<br/>\n&gt; not stable and well-tried and probably hasn&#39;t a big community<br/>\n&gt; submitting bugs and coming with feature requests. This of course is<br/>\n&gt; countered by 79 commits last month. :-) What is the state of Continuum?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; How do CruiseControl, Continuum and Anthill compare to one-another?<br/>\n&gt; Thanks Wayne for these pointers, it all looks like a much better deal<br/>\n&gt; than Cron. :-)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Cheers<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; \tNik </span></blockquote></div>",
