It seems like\n&gt; &gt; this is a case of overzeal=\r\nous use of the new parameterized types in\n&gt; &gt; Java 5 and a regression from =\r\nJUnit 3.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;d say merely mistaken, rather than overzealous.  :-)  Submi=\r\nt a bug\n&gt; report, and it should be easy to fix in 4.5.\n\nDone.  And I didn&#39;t=\r\n mean to sound critical - being overzealous is no\ncrime in my book.  After =\r\nall, aren&#39;t you all test-obsessed?  :-)\n\n&gt; &gt; Also, in JUnit 3 the method lo=\r\nadSuiteClass() called getLoader() to get\n&gt; &gt; the ClassLoader to use, which =\r\nopened the door for extensibility.  This\n&gt; &gt; is gone now, why?\n&gt; \n&gt; Can&#39;t s=\r\nay the why.  Can you open another bug, perhaps with a test\n&gt; you&#39;d like to =\r\nsee compile and pass?  Thanks,\n\n\nI&#39;m not sure this issue really is a bug.  =\r\nI suspect the move was\nintentional, but I would recommend that instead of j=\r\nust removing the\ngetLoader() method, it should have been deprecated.  As I =\r\nmentioned in\nthe bug report, this came to light when attempting to use JUni=\r\nt 4.4\nwith Cactus tests.  I suspect this is just the tip of the iceberg of\n=\r\nthe issues which I&#39;m sure have already been investigated by others.\n\n- Brun=\r\no\n\n\n\n\n\n",
