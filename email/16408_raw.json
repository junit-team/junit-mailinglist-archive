My interface/wrapper class\n&gt; is then tiny - and so a mocking framework just aint worth it.\n\nThe places where I&#39;ve found mocking frameworks the most useful are:\n\n1) Just getting started on a codebase, using test-driven development.  \nAs Mr. Rainsberger has mentioned, here JMock&#39;s flexibility to name \nmethods without defining them can be key.\n\n2) Just getting started on legacy code.  I can often safely introduce a \nseam between two classes by extracting an interface from one, and then \nstart characterization tests on the other by mocking the new interface.\n\n[In both of the above cases, I&#39;ve found that over time, I have fewer and \nfewer mock objects in my tests, and even old tests with mock objects \nstart losing them.  I think that as the abstractions get better, it \nbecomes easier to think of simple implementations of interfaces that \nlook less like mocks, and more like useful objects you could actually \nimagine a client using.]\n\n3) Writing plug-ins.  When the ratio of foreign interfaces to lines of \nnew business code gets high enough, I become suspicious of wrapping \nevery interface, because then the code begins to look like:\n\n// listener callback\npublic Result somethingHasChanged(FileChange change) {\n   return mySomethingHasChanged(new \nBetterAbstractionForFileChange(change)).asClientResult();\n}\n\nWhich doesn&#39;t actually help the reader understand what&#39;s going on.  In \nthis case, the mock objects tend to stick around until the plug-in \nstarts growing to the size of an application in its own right.\n\nYour mileage may vary.\n\n   David Saff\n\n",
