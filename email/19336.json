I was using a home-grown one with<br/>\n&gt; a previous employer, but that isn&#39;t (yet - I&#39;m hopeful!) open-sourced<br/>\n&gt; / externally available, so I need to make a jump to another one.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I tried EasyMock (1.x) after reading JB&#39;s book a couple of years back<br/>\n&gt; - I think the state of the art has moved on somewhat since then.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The closed framework that I used previously seems pretty similar in<br/>\n&gt; terms of look and feel to rMock 2.0 and JMock 2.0, but I&#39;m open to<br/>\n&gt; other suggestions.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What experiences to people have to share?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I wrote then that if I&#39;d been able to use JMock 1.x for real before <br/>\nwriting the book, my examples would have been with JMock 1.x. I stand by <br/>\nthat statement. I haven&#39;t used JMock 2, because I don&#39;t do Java 5, but <br/>\nif I did, I&#39;d reach for JMock 2 first. In the Java 1.4 world, I use <br/>\nJMock 1 and love it.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
