If your driver breaks, then obviously you \nare missing a test in the former test suite, but not necessarily in the \nlater.\n\n&gt; Why is it so hard to understand that I want my tests to be as close to\n&gt; my production code as possible?!?\n\nDon&#39;t know, maybe it&#39;s related to the way you try to explain?\n\nYour tests don&#39;t seem to be unit tests to me, but end to end tests. \nThey seem to do too much.\n\nAssume your data may also come from a database, not only from XML. \nDo you then write all your test that deal with the objects *again*?\nOr do you just test the objects in isolation and the the XML / DB readers \nin isolation?\n\n&gt; &gt; Please give an example where it does affect your test results\n&gt; &gt; if the setup code runs for each test and where you still\n&gt; &gt; claim that the tests are independent.\n&gt;\n&gt; How about the example I just gave?\n\nA concrete example please. A test class with at least two test methods \nthat \na) are independent of each other\nb) fail / pass if and only if setUp is / is not run\nI have seen some pretty bad code but I still don&#39;t see how you want to \nachieve that.\n\n&gt; Hint:  imagine the XML file is several megabytes big.  It&#39;s not that\n&gt; far fetched, really.\n\nHint: cut it down to simpler XML. \nI cannot believe you have no duplication in terms of features in a several \nmegabytes file. \nAnd if you do, why not use small chunks in each test?  What about one test \nper interesting feature of each XML entity? \n\nI am curious how long your test methods are... more than 3 lines on \naverage?\n\nCheers,\n\nRobert\n\n",
