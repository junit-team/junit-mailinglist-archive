You can use an @Given annotation t=\r\no declare dependencies between producer and consumer tests. JExample extend=\r\ns JUnit to take care of these dependencies. If the producer fails, all cons=\r\numers are skipped. And even better, a producer can return its fixture as re=\r\nturn value and consumers can well consume the cache value as arguments. The=\r\n framework takes care to clone return values that are used  by more than on=\r\ne consumer.\n\nhttp://scg.unibe.ch/jexample\n\ncheers,\nAdrian\n\n\n--- In junit@ya=\r\nhoogroups.com, &quot;trenton_adams2001&quot; &lt;trenta@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Guys,\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;=\r\nm just wondering.  Have the JUnit developers considered adding dependency a=\r\nnnotations to JUnit?  You could annotate your code with say \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;@TestDep=\r\nendency Test1 public void myTest() {code;}&quot;, which would cause myTest() to =\r\ndepend on Test1 running it&#39;s tests first.\n&gt; \n&gt; A scenario where this might =\r\nbe needed...\n&gt; 1. Test1 inserts DB records\n&gt; 2. Nightly job runs (but can b=\r\ne run manually by user)\n&gt; 3. Test2.myTest() then runs, as #2 has completed,=\r\n and myTest() now has data that can be used.\n&gt; \n&gt; In the case of #2, it wou=\r\nld need to give the user enough time to run the nightly job, manually.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n I&#39;m wanting to test everything in a totally automated way.  But at this po=\r\nint, it is not entirely possible.\n&gt; \n&gt; I just wanted to ask about this, as =\r\nyou guys probably have a lot more experience in why this is or is not a goo=\r\nd idea.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks.\n&gt;\n\n\n",
