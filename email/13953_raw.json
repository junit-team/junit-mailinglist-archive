Too much gets marked as public that really shouldn&#39;t be.\n\nOnly if you think that public=published. Otherwise it&#39;s just fine to use it\na lot.\n\n&gt; Internal APIs need to be distinguished from published APIs, and Java\n&gt; doesn&#39;t let you do that across package boundaries. As I said, this may\n&gt; get better in the 1.6/1.7 time frame.\n\nIn fact I think the problem is even more complex. You might even want to\npublish different things to different clients. It&#39;s probably something that\nis better solved at a custom annotation level than on the basic language\nlevel.\n\nCheers, Ilja\n\n\n",
