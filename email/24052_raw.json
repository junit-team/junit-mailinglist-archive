There have b=\r\neen a lot of contributions by a full cast of contributors. Thanks to everyo=\r\nne who took part by reporting an issue, offering his/her opinion, or even s=\r\nubmitting a pull request!\n\nToday, we are releasing a first beta version of =\r\n4.11. The reason is simple: We want to make sure the upgrade from Hamcrest =\r\n1.1 to 1.3 goes smoothly. Therefore, we are kindly asking you to give it a =\r\ntry. If you find anything we should consider, please let us know, either vi=\r\na this mailing list or directly on GitHub: https://github.com/KentBeck/juni=\r\nt/issues/512\n\nAs usual, you can download the JARs or the complete ZIP file =\r\ndirectly from https://github.com/KentBeck/junit/downloads. In addition, the=\r\n jars\nhave been submitted to Maven Central and should appear there within o=\r\nne or two hours.\n\nYou can find the preliminary release notes on GitHub and =\r\ncopied below:\nhttps://github.com/KentBeck/junit/blob/master/doc/ReleaseNote=\r\ns4.11.txt\n\nCheers,\n\nMarc Philipp\n\n\nSummary of changes in version 4.11 [unre=\r\nleased!]\n\nMatchers: Upgrade to Hamcrest 1.3\n\nJUnit now uses the latest vers=\r\nion of Hamcrest. Thus, you can use all the available matchers and benefit f=\r\nrom an improved assertThat which will now print the mismatch description fr=\r\nom the matcher when an assertion fails.\n\nExample\n\nassertThat(Long.valueOf(1=\r\n), instanceOf(Integer.class));\nOld error message:\n\nExpected: an instance of=\r\n java.lang.Integer\n     got: &lt;1L&gt;\nNew error message:\n\nExpected: an instance=\r\n of java.lang.Integer\n     but: &lt;1L&gt; is a java.lang.Long\nHamcrest=92s new F=\r\neatureMatcher makes writing custom matchers that make use of custom mismatc=\r\nh descriptions quite easy:\n\n@Test\npublic void featureMatcher() throws Excep=\r\ntion {\n    assertThat(&quot;Hello World!&quot;, length(is(0)));\n}\n\nprivate Matcher&lt;St=\r\nring&gt; length(Matcher&lt;? super Integer&gt; matcher) {\n    return new FeatureMatc=\r\nher&lt;String, Integer&gt;(matcher, &quot;a String of length that&quot;, &quot;length&quot;) {\n      =\r\n  @Override\n        protected Integer featureValueOf(String actual) {\n     =\r\n       return actual.length();\n        }\n    };\n}\nRunning this test will re=\r\nturn the following failure message:\n\nExpected: a String of length that is &lt;=\r\n0&gt;\n     but: length was &lt;12&gt;\nMost of the matchers in JUnitMatchers have bee=\r\nn deprecated. Please use org.hamcrest.CoreMatchers directly.\n\nParameterized=\r\n Tests\n\nIn order to easily identify the individual test cases in a Paramete=\r\nrized test, you may provide a name using the @Parameters annotation. This n=\r\name is allowed to contain placeholders that are replaced at runtime:\n\n{inde=\r\nx}: the current parameter index\n{0}, {1}, =85: the first, second, and so on=\r\n, parameter value\nExample\n\n@RunWith(Parameterized.class)\npublic class Fibon=\r\nacciTest {\n\n    @Parameters(name =3D &quot;{index}: fib({0})=3D{1}&quot;)\n    public =\r\nstatic Iterable&lt;Object[]&gt; data() {\n        return Arrays.asList(new Object[=\r\n][] { { 0, 0 }, { 1, 1 }, { 2, 1 },\n                { 3, 2 }, { 4, 3 }, { 5=\r\n, 5 }, { 6, 8 } });\n    }\n\n    private int input;\n    private int expected;=\r\n\n\n    public FibonacciTest(int input, int expected) {\n        this.input =\r\n=3D input;\n        this.expected =3D expected;\n    }\n\n    @Test\n    public =\r\nvoid test() {\n        assertEquals(expected, Fibonacci.compute(input));\n   =\r\n }\n}\nIn the example given above, the Parameterized runner creates names lik=\r\ne [1: fib(3)=3D2]. If you don=92t specify a name, the current parameter ind=\r\nex will be used by default.\n\nTest execution order\n\nBy design, JUnit does no=\r\nt specify the execution order of test method invocations. Until now, the me=\r\nthods were simply invoked in the order returned by the reflection API. Howe=\r\nver, using the JVM order is unwise since the Java platform does not specify=\r\n any particular order, and in fact JDK 7 returns a more or less random orde=\r\nr. Of course, well-written test code would not assume any order, but some d=\r\noes, and a predictable failure is better than a random failure on certain p=\r\nlatforms.\n\nFrom now on, JUnit will by default use a deterministic, but not =\r\npredictable, order (MethodSorters.DEFAULT). To change the test execution or=\r\nder simply annotate your test class using @FixMethodOrder and specify one o=\r\nf the available MethodSorters:\n\n@FixMethodOrder(MethodSorters.JVM): Leaves =\r\nthe test methods in the order returned by the JVM. This order may vary from=\r\n run to run.\n\n@FixMethodOrder(MethodSorters.NAME_ASCENDING): Sorts the test=\r\n methods by method name, in lexicographic order.\n\nMaven artifacts\n\nUp until=\r\n now there were two Maven artifacts for JUnit: junit:junit-dep and junit:ju=\r\nnit. From a Maven point-of-view only the former made sense because it did n=\r\not contain the Hamcrest classes but declared a dependency to the Hamcrest M=\r\naven artifact. The latter included the Hamcrest classes which was very un-M=\r\naven-like.\n\nFrom this release on, you should use junit:junit which will be =\r\nwhat junit:junit-dep used to. If you still reference junit:junit-dep, Maven=\r\n will automatically relocate you to the new junit:junit and issue a warning=\r\n for you to fix.\n\nRules\n\nA number of improvements have been made to Rules:\n=\r\n\nBoth @Rule and @ClassRule can now be used on methods that return a TestRul=\r\ne.\nExpectedException now always prints the stacktrace of the actual excepti=\r\non in case of failure.\nA parent folder can be specified for TemporaryFolder=\r\n. In addition, the newFile/newFolder methods will now fail when the file or=\r\n folder could not be created.\nTestWatcher has a new template method called =\r\nskipped that is invoked when a test is skipped due to a failed assumption.\n=\r\nImprovements to Assert and Assume\n\nassertNotEquals has been added to Assert=\r\n.\nassertEquals has been overloaded in order to check whether two floats are=\r\n equal given a certain float delta.\nMost methods in Assume now allow to pas=\r\ns a custom message.\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed=\r\n]\n\n\n",
