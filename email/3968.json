Prints out nice looking reports, similar to the HTML reports from Ant&#39;s JUnit task.  Actually somewhat more accurate coverage numbers because the Ant report task uses a reference classpath to do a delta of actual classes/bytes versus classes/bytes loaded by JProbe at runtime.<br/>\n<br/>\nScott Stirling<br/>\nJRun QA<br/>\nMacromedia<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Chris Eppstein [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ceppstein@...\">ceppstein@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks to all for your replies. To recap:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The filename matching system that David proposed was my first <br/>\n&gt; thought as<br/>\n&gt; well and it could be implemented as an Ant task easily enough <br/>\n&gt; so that can be<br/>\n&gt; used to fail a build if a test case is missing, etc... I had <br/>\n&gt; started to<br/>\n&gt; write this utility when I decided to email the list and make <br/>\n&gt; sure I wasn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; re-inventing the wheel. I think that this approach is a good <br/>\n&gt; first step but<br/>\n&gt; it doesn&#39;t give us a look into the code and it would be <br/>\n&gt; difficult to handle<br/>\n&gt; interfaces (for which I rarely write a unit test).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I looked at NoUnit but I cannot get it to run with Java 1.4 <br/>\n&gt; -- it looks<br/>\n&gt; promising though. Quilt is the most ambitious of the open <br/>\n&gt; source projects<br/>\n&gt; and it also looks to be very promising -- but is still pre-alpha and<br/>\n&gt; probably not ready for use in a corporate setting.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Integration with Ant is, of-course, a big plus for any <br/>\n&gt; utility that can be<br/>\n&gt; used for this task. Looks like there&#39;s some definate room for <br/>\n&gt; improvement in<br/>\n&gt; this area. Does anyone else have some suggestions?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Chris </span></blockquote></div>",
