I was just reading an article about a novel way of implementing\nmock objects using an anonymous inner class.  The article is at:\n\nhttp://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/library/j-mocktest.html\n\nI find, though, that when I try to run the sample code in listings 5\nand 6 through JUnit, I get a null pointer exception.\n\nSo now I&#39;m wondering two things:\n\n1- Does anyone see why this code wouldn&#39;t work?\n\n2- Does this approach to Mock classes add unnecessary complexity? \nPerhaps I&#39;d just be better off using a regular ol&#39; derived class\ninstead of an anonymous inner class.  The catch is that the regular\nol&#39; derived class would need to be passed into the class being tested\nas a constructor parameter instead of being contained completely by\nthe class being tested.\n\nAny thoughts?\n\nThanks,\n\nKen\n\n\n\n\n",
