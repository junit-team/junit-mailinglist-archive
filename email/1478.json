This is something I have often alluded to in my own company, but<br/>\n&gt;still eludes me frequently.  For that reason I wrote a utility that<br/>\n&gt;integrates with VAJ to keep the metrics coming as far as what is tested and<br/>\n&gt;what is not.  This is not a code coverage analysis; all it does is report<br/>\n </span></blockquote>on<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;which classes are tested and which are not, and of the ones that are - how<br/>\n&gt;much of their public interface is tested.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Would you be willing to publish such an utility. I think it might be usefull<br/>\nto the community. (At least I know _I_ wanted to write something that list<br/>\nwhich class has a TestClass written for and which don&#39;t). Your stuff looks<br/>\ncool.<br/>\n<br/>\nmathieu</div>",
