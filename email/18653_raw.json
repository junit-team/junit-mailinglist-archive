As for testing subset of the tests, it&#39;s just an option, when they\n&gt;  want to check something specifically and not have to test the whole suit\n&gt;  (for example, some tests fail and they need to re-test only those with\n&gt;  different parameters on another run).\n\nI see, cool.\n\nCheers...\n--MB\n\n",
