Glad to hear from you again.<br/>\n&gt; Long time since JavaOne and JavaWorld.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I wondered if that was you. THE Eric Armstrong.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It&#39;s good to know that I wasn&#39;t the only one confused by the<br/>\n&gt; overloading of the word &quot;test&quot;. My next major hurdle is getting<br/>\n&gt; a good handle on the process of TDD -- the paradigm shift<br/>\n&gt; looks as big as shyifting into O-O thinking. (I seem to be having<br/>\n&gt; as much trouble doing it, at least.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Altima looks pretty interesting. I like the separation of reporting<br/>\n&gt; from testing, and the runpath idea. The short summary doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; really tell me what a recipe file is good for, though. I guess I need<br/>\n&gt; to know more about the possible &quot;run properties of a particular<br/>\n&gt; suite&quot;, and why I would want to use them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>A recipe file contains all the ingredients and instructions needed to <br/>\nrun a test. It currently includes a runpath, a set of Suites and/or <br/>\nTestCases to run, and a list of Reporters. So for example, if you have <br/>\n5 or 6 different tests you like to run, you can save their recipes in 5 <br/>\nfiles, put shortcuts to those files as icons on your desktop, then <br/>\ndouble click on the icons to run the tests.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy next week, though, I expect to add the notion of context properties <br/>\nto the recipe. If you want to run the same test on different databases, <br/>\nfor example, you can place custom properties in the recipe that <br/>\nindicate which database to use. The recipe is what I&#39;m planning will be <br/>\nthe primary way to pass context to tests. I&#39;m hoping to get an article <br/>\nout on passing context to tests on March 3.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Most of all, I&#39;m looking forward to understanding more about<br/>\n&gt; how it &quot;can help developers create unit and conformance tests&quot;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>SuiteRunner is like JUnit in a lot of ways. You can use it to run JUnit <br/>\ntests, but you can also use it standalone. I originally started writing <br/>\nit for a conformance test I needed to do, but the project sort of got <br/>\naway from us and ended up more generic.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; ...And to understanding more about how to do TDD well in the<br/>\n&gt; first place.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There&#39;s also a testdrivendevelopment Yahoo group:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/testdrivendevelopment/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/testdrivendevelopment/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nbv<br/>\n--<br/>\nBill Venners<br/>\nArtima Software, Inc.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.artima.com\">http://www.artima.com</a></div>",
