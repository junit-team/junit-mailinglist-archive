Assertions (and mocks) have especially<br/>\n&gt; contorted themselves in ways that they might finally now be able to relax.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, assertions could probably get much benefit from lambdas.<br/>\n<br/>\nI support the idea of having assertions as a separate library which is <br/>\ndecoupled from the testing framework (the same way as Hamcrest, <br/>\nFEST-Assert and probably others). The testing framework would then focus <br/>\nfully on the test execution model (e.g. test isolation, execution order, <br/>\nrules and other metaprogramming).<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is wide variablity in how assertions can be done (especially in <br/>\ndifferent languages). I don&#39;t have strong opinions about what an assert <br/>\nshould be like, and seems that there are as many kinds of asserts as <br/>\nthere are testing frameworks.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is less variablity in testing frameworks&#39; execution model, but <br/>\nthose differences are often at a more fundamental level (e.g. test <br/>\nisolation vs. shared state). I and others hold strong opinions about them.<br/>\n<br/>\nThus I would like to be able to mix and match the frameworks and <br/>\nassertions separately, sometimes even using multiple assertion libraries <br/>\nin the same test.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;    - The fact that a Description is both the immutable single name of a test<br/>\n&gt; node, and a mutable builder for the test structure, and then later an<br/>\n&gt; immutable reference for the test structure, is exasperating.<br/>\n&gt;    - The reliance on reflectively-discovered constructors for extensibility<br/>\n&gt; causes some awkwardness.<br/>\n&gt;    - The IDE-centric idea that one should be enable to enumerate all tests<br/>\n&gt; before any is run places some binding constraints, and should be at most<br/>\n&gt; optional in a world in which tests are often run by daemons many more times<br/>\n&gt; a day than by humans.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve noticed those as well. I&#39;ve already addressed each of those in Jumi:<br/>\n<br/>\n- A testing framework must assign a unique immutable TestId for each <br/>\ntest in a test class, which is then used to send events of when the test <br/>\nwas started, finished, failed etc. The TestId implies a tree structure <br/>\nof tests (to be used in test result reports). Everything is expressed as <br/>\nimmutable events (Jumi relies heavily on Event Sourcing). See details at <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://jumi.fi/api/jumi-api/fi/jumi/api/drivers/SuiteNotifier.html\">http://jumi.fi/api/jumi-api/fi/jumi/api/drivers/SuiteNotifier.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n- The fi.jumi.api.drivers.Driver which corresponds <br/>\norg.junit.runner.Runner requires a zero-argument constructor. The test <br/>\nclass et al is passed as method argument to <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://jumi.fi/api/jumi-api/fi/jumi/api/drivers/Driver.html#findTests\">http://jumi.fi/api/jumi-api/fi/jumi/api/drivers/Driver.html#findTests</a><br/>\n<br/>\n- Jumi starts executing tests as soon as possible, at both the suite and <br/>\ntest class levels. At suite level, test class execution starts <br/>\nasynchronously before all test classes are discovered (i.e. before Jumi <br/>\nhas finished traversing the directories containing test classes). At <br/>\ntest class level, more tests can be found during test execution (for <br/>\nexample Specsy requires this) and the new test executions can be started <br/>\nasynchronously in parallel (depending on the testing framework and <br/>\nwhether the user has disabled parallelism for that test class or the <br/>\nwhole suite).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;    - There are as many perfect models of test status possibilities as there<br/>\n&gt; are developers.  Passed/Failed?  Passed/Failed/Skipped?<br/>\n&gt;   Passed/Failed/Ignored, etc.  The current design bakes one required system<br/>\n&gt; pretty deep into the internals, unnecessarily.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s been on my mind for a long time, but I haven&#39;t yet figured out a <br/>\ngood way to support all the variations, so I&#39;m deferring the decision. I <br/>\nwould love to hear your ideas.<br/>\n<br/>\nA very flexible way would be to allow tagging tests with arbitrary <br/>\nkeywords, but then the problem will be that how each of those keywords <br/>\nshould affect the user interface. There would have to be at least some <br/>\nkeywords with specific meaning, which brings us back to the original <br/>\nquestion of which states to support.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo get started we could list all the variations in use today and the use <br/>\ncases for using each of them (e.g. it&#39;s an acceptance tests for a <br/>\nfeature which has not yet been implemented). I&#39;m hoping there to be 5 or <br/>\nless different reasons that are served by test statuses.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Now, should the framework to which I&#39;d contribute time to fix these<br/>\n&gt; problems be called JUnit 5, or something entirely different?  That&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; another kettle of fish, with some interesting options to consider.  Looks<br/>\n&gt; like we have at least 9 months to consider them at length.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>9 months, like giving birth to a baby. I suppose the names of quite many <br/>\npeople have been pondered for that long. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nJUnit&#39;s name is well known, so it&#39;s a marketing bonus. On the other <br/>\nhand, the software industry moves quickly and good technology can get <br/>\npopular regardless of its name.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nEsko Luontola<br/>\nwww.orfjackal.net</div>",
