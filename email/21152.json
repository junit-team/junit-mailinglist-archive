Years back I was a contractor for the DoD. This <br/>\n&gt; statement means one of a few possible things:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 1. &quot;We don&#39;t know what jUnit it, so we&#39;re against it&quot;<br/>\n&gt; 2. &quot;We heard of something like jUnit that is actually banned, <br/>\n&gt; so just in case we&#39;ll say jUnit is banned too.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; 3. &quot;It&#39;s late, let&#39;s go home.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I would suggest that since none of the people here who work <br/>\n&gt; with jUnit have heard of this ban, plus jUnit is pretty much <br/>\n&gt; the standard, the people making the claim must corroborate it <br/>\n&gt; to a *legally* binding degree. Nothing like a &quot;well I heard <br/>\n&gt; on the internet that...&quot; or &quot;some guy who works at some other <br/>\n&gt; location says...&quot; but a copy of an actual memo or directive <br/>\n&gt; that explicitly names jUnit and explains the reason for the ban.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Otherwise, I would simply be a good negotiator, viz., <br/>\n&gt; expressions of sympathy (they are free) but don&#39;t give in to <br/>\n&gt; whatever they say until they document it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ---&gt; Exceptional claims require exceptional proof &lt;---<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Note that you should strongly take the position that jUnit is <br/>\n&gt; allowed, it is the standard and that *they* must prove their <br/>\n&gt; claim. Otherwise you will be trying to show a negative, which <br/>\n&gt; is impossible and will eat up a lot of your time in the <br/>\n&gt; process.  What will you do if you come up empty-handed and <br/>\n&gt; they say they think the memo was actually classified? <br/>\n&gt; If they are legitimate programmers then you&#39;ll get this <br/>\n&gt; settled pretty quickly and amicably. If they are <br/>\n&gt; non-technical but in charge, well... <br/>\n&gt; best of luck....<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Jeff<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; David McReynolds wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Someone popped up at a meeting this morning and announced <br/>\n&gt; that the US<br/>\n&gt; &gt; DoD does not allow the use of jUnit for unit testing.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; First, I find<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that a little hard to swallow given the second statement about junit<br/>\n&gt; &gt; being the built-in testing generator provided by java (can you say<br/>\n&gt; &gt; non-sequitor?). Secondly, I cannot corroborate that <br/>\n&gt; statement via google.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; What I need is link to a document that explicitly corroborates or<br/>\n&gt; &gt; refutes the statement. So far, it looks like the statement is false<br/>\n&gt; &gt; but I am only using deductive reasoning there.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
