The development team has created test cases for each object,<br/>\nbut has hardcoded parameters into each test case.  The actual objects<br/>\nessentially take a hash as a parameter specific to that object as<br/>\ninstructions for what to do.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy problem is this.  Before development moves along much further, I<br/>\nwould like to take the test harnesses for each object and remove the<br/>\nhardcoding from them.  Each test harness should still be able to be<br/>\nrun individually as it&#39;s own test, but I&#39;m looking to the future as<br/>\nwell, when we have the potential to do nightly builds and will want to<br/>\nrun all of the test harnesses as a suite together.  This definitely<br/>\ncannot happen if any hardcoding exists, but there needs to be some<br/>\nexternal way to pass each object the information specific to it only<br/>\nto test.  I don&#39;t want to create a properties/configuration file for<br/>\neach object, as many of of the objects can re-use the same sdf file,<br/>\nlogger, and other config files.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAny suggestions?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nAllen Reinmeyer</div>",
