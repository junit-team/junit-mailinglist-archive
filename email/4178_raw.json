I don&#39;t think so.\n&gt; \n&gt; What do you think is the right way?\n\n\nthrow an IllegalArgumentException when your method receives an argument \nthat is illegal (or you can also exit the method, but this won&#39;t give \nmuch information to the calling method).\n\nSome words about the assert keyword in JDK1.4:\n\nUnit testing is good but having unit tested your program is not a proof \nthat there is no bug in your program.  And having a 100% coverage is not \na proof, just a sign that you have to use another testing strategy to \nfind other bugs.\n\nEvery test strategy has its limits, so does unit testing.  Typically in \nunit testing, _you_ set the object to a particular state and then apply \nthe method you test.  But what happens if your object is not in that \nparticular state before the method is called?  How many times did you \nfind bugs that were discovered only because the system was in a \nparticular state?\n\nIf you use the assert keyword to ensure that your system is in a valid \nstate, you will be able (hopefully) to detect bugs that are not due to \nthe object&#39;s method but to the object&#39;s state.\n\n-Vladimir\n\n\n-- \nVladimir Bossicard\nwww.bossicard.com\n\n\n",
