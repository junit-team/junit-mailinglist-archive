NUnit<br/>\n 3.0 will be moving there. The VCS on Launchpad is bazaar.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe main attraction of Launchpad to me was their stated<br/>\ngoal of making it very easy for people to contribute to<br/>\nprojects. Anyone who wants to create a branch of a project<br/>\nin their private space on launchpad can do so and then <br/>\npropose the change for merging into the trunk. Of course,C<br/>\nthe project team has control over what they accept.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile working on such a branch, the potential contributor<br/>\nhas all the services of a source code management system<br/>\navailable to them on their own machine and can push<br/>\nupdates to a published branch on Launchpad. Regular<br/>\ncontributors or team members can do the same thing and<br/>\nyou can use your main branch (trunk) like a centralized<br/>\nrepository if you prefer, while still having the benefits<br/>\nof a distributed system where you need it. Code review<br/>\nis integrated in the process.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m still in the stage of learning to use LP and bzr,<br/>\nand there could still be glitches, but both are under<br/>\nactive development and the underlying philosophy matches<br/>\nwhat I&#39;d like to do. I suspect it&#39;s a philosophical match<br/>\nyou as well. I spent some time searching and couldn&#39;t<br/>\nfind anything about banning any countries there.<br/>\n<br/>\nLaunchpad, btw, is sponsored by Canonical, and it&#39;s <br/>\nwhere Ubuntu is developed, so it focuses on an international<br/>\naudience and has a platform for localization as well.<br/>\n <br/>\nI suggest taking the tour at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://launchpad.net/+tour/index\">http://launchpad.net/+tour/index</a><br/>\nif this sounds at all interesting.<br/>\n<br/>\nCharlie<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>] On <br/>\n&gt; Behalf Of David Saff<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, December 09, 2008 11:07 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [junit] Would JUnit moving to Subversion and/or <br/>\n&gt; Google Code have consequences for you?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Actually, it appears that JUnit has already been somewhat <br/>\n&gt; blocked from Cuba:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SourceForge#Banned_countries\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SourceForge#Banned_countries</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So now we have three variables to control:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 1) Code review ease<br/>\n&gt; 2) Source control ease<br/>\n&gt; 3) Worldwide access<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Does anyone know for sure if there&#39;s a hosting solution that <br/>\n&gt; scores 100% on Worldwide Access?
