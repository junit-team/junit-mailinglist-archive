Has it been that long since you learned a new API? <br/>\nFeaturitis isn&#39;t just a problem for applications. It applies to <br/>\nlibraries too. Smaller is better. Too large an API becomes a problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nTrying to bring this back on topic, the JUnit 3.8 API is a good example. <br/>\nIt&#39;s actually pretty small but not as small as it could or should be. <br/>\nTake a look at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.junit.org/junit/javadoc/3.8.1/index.htm\">http://www.junit.org/junit/javadoc/3.8.1/index.htm</a> How <br/>\nmuch of that does a programmer actually need to know? How easy is it for <br/>\nsomeone trying to learn the API to figure what they need to do and where <br/>\nto get started? Even experienced users can have trouble finding a <br/>\nrelatively unfamiliar class, and that&#39;s a small API as APIs go, and much <br/>\nbetter documented than most. Probably half of what&#39;s there could be <br/>\nnon-public, and users would be the better off for it if it were. What <br/>\nbenefit is served by making junit.samples or TestResult$1 public?<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n﻿Elliotte Rusty Harold  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:elharo@...\">elharo@...</a><br/>\nXML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/\">http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim\">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim</a></div>",
