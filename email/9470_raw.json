One of their tools minimizes the \nlength of\n&gt; names where possible (it&#39;s not possible where a name is part of a\n&gt; published interface). Using this and other techniques they \ntypically\n&gt; shrink Java code by well over 50% for a small one-time cost in \nterms of\n&gt; computer cycles (it takes about 4 minutes to process 3.8 MB of \ncode on an\n&gt; 800 MHz PC).\n\nThat&#39;s an interesting assertion.  I&#39;m not sure that I can relate it \nto the presence or absence of comments, particularly since comments \ndon&#39;t end up in the compiled code.  If this compression of names is \nthat beneficial, then it sounds like it should be a part of the \nautomated build process i.e.\n\nSource Code In ---&gt; Everything renamed to short names --&gt; Compiler --\n&gt; Result\n\n&gt;\n&gt; There is a reasonably reliable relationship between code size and\n&gt; speed. Less than half as many bytes typically means software that\n&gt; runs more than twice as fast.\n&gt;\n\nI would have expected that choice of algorithm, correct use of \nbuffered I/O and so on would have a larger effect on performance \nthan the relative size in bytes of the compiled result.  Is the \narticle online for us to examine?\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Sure, but bear in mind the cost of using long names and an expanded\n&gt; class hierarchy to replace comments.\n&gt;\n\nI&#39;m not clear what the cost of using long variable names is.  Could \nyou go into further detail about what the costs of the above two \nare?  I also suspect that if either of these things has a \nsignificant cost, then we are using wrong tools, or the right tools \nincorrectly.\n\nI must confess, I am definitely one of the &#39;comment extremely \nsparsely&#39; crowd.  What might be interesting is if we perhaps wrote a \nRuby program to process a Java source tree, replacing the symbols \nwith the smallest identifiers possible, unless they are tagged with \na @published tag for external compatibility reasons.  I would expect \nto be able to produce a readable and maintainable program to do this \nwith very few comments indeed.  I also expect to be able to write a \nprogram to convert a stack trace back to the original symbols, again \nwith very few comments.\n\nDo you think that might be a worthwhile or interesting exercise?\n\nI can higly recommend &#39;Refactoring&#39; by Martin Fowler.  He has lots \nof great ideas and examples relating to identifying code quality, \nand a few bits on unit testing too.\n\nKind Regards,\nShaun.\n\n\n\n\n",
