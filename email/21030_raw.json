While in\nJUnit 3, the constructor was often invoked fully minutes before the\nsetUp() method, in JUnit 4, the @Before methods are run, for all\npractical purposes, right after the constructor.  So many things can\nbe done right in the constructor, or just in field declarations.  The\none difference is that if your constructor throws an exception, the\n@After methods cannot be run (there&#39;s no instance for them to be run\non).  So anything with the potential to throw an exception should be\nin a @Before.\n\nDoes that answer your question?\n\n   David Saff\n\nOn Wed, Oct 22, 2008 at 3:26 PM, Ahmed S Ashour &lt;asashour@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Dear all,\n&gt;\n&gt; It seems that for evey case, a new instance is constructed.\n&gt;\n&gt; If this is by design, then no need for &#39;@Before&#39;, because the before\n&gt; fixure code can be put in the constructor.\n&gt;\n&gt; I don&#39;t think it should be this way, but a single instance is shared\n&gt; between all test (methods), and for each one, @Before and @After is\n&gt; called.\n&gt;\n&gt; What do you think?\n&gt;\n&gt; Ahmed\n&gt;\n&gt; public class TestClass {\n&gt;\n&gt; public TestClass() {\n&gt; System.out.println(&quot;Constructor&quot;);\n&gt; }\n&gt;\n&gt; @Before\n&gt; public void before() {\n&gt; System.out.println(&quot;Before&quot;);\n&gt; }\n&gt;\n&gt; @Test\n&gt; public void test1() {\n&gt; }\n&gt;\n&gt; @Test\n&gt; public void test2() {\n&gt; }\n&gt;\n&gt; @Test\n&gt; public void test3() {\n&gt; }\n&gt; }\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n",
