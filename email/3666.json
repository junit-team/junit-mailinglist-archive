It is not designed to be an automated GUI testing framework.  It is better<br/>\nsuited for applications where you are enforcing that an algorithm gives expected results<br/>\nor that no exceptions are thrown for correct input or that the proper exceptions are<br/>\nthrown for incorrect input.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, I find that GUIs are best tested by humans.  This is because writing the<br/>\ntest code for GUIs will take about as much time (or more) as actually writing the<br/>\nGUI.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I find effective is the MVC approach (Model, View, Controller).  The Model and<br/>\nController code should not have any GUI elements in it.  All that is handled by the<br/>\nView.  Let&#39;s say that there does need to be some sort of conversational state that<br/>\nmust be taken if the user has to answer a popup dialog.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet&#39;s say we have a delete option in your GUI app.  It is a View responsibility to<br/>\npop up the &quot;Are you sure?&quot; dialog box.  If the user is sure, View calls the Controller<br/>\nand performs the actual delete function.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow Let&#39;s say we have a more complex example.  Perhaps your system has a function<br/>\nthat needs information the first time it is called, but subsequent times no dialog<br/>\nis needed.  The perfect example is the &quot;Save&quot; option.  The first time a user clicks<br/>\non &quot;Save&quot; for a new document, there is no filename associated with the document.<br/>\nAfter that, it is safe to assume that the documents filename is ok.  In this case,<br/>\nthe Controller will return an error condition (either a flag in the return value<br/>\nor an Exception to be thrown) and the View will know that it needs to ask the<br/>\nuser for a filename.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you properly separate your concerns like this, your Controller code can be<br/>\neasily tested with JUnit--which is what it is designed for.  The same can be<br/>\nsaid of the Model.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;They that give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety<br/>\n  deserve neither liberty nor safety.&quot;<br/>\n                 - Benjamin Franklin</div>",
