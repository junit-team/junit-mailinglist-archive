The class has a few public methods, such as\nstart/stop/setFolder/setFilter, the rest are private. How do I test\nthis class the best way?\n\nIve implemented some testcases that uses this hotfolder thread that\nstarts the thread and creates files in the active folder. Then I check\nhow many times the testcase was notified and compares it to the\nnumber of actual files created.\nBut this fails sometimes, since the computer can be occupied with other\nstuff which delays the hotfolder notifying and therefore doesnt report\nthat many new files that I was expecting.\n\nThis is a common problem I have with other threads, such as a\nThumbnailLoader (singleton instance that loads jpeg thumbnails)....\n\n\nSo which way is the best to test threaded classes?\nOr is this impossible and should be avoided, and for example\nput the thread stuff into its own class. (But how do you test that\nclass :)?\n\n\nI want to have a complete threaded object and not having to put the\nobject into as a Runnable every time I want to use it. (besides there so\nmuch more work to start/stop threads that I want to hide in the\nmentioned class)\n\nAny suggestions?\n\n//erik\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nErik Mattsson\n\nimBridge AB\nVasaplatsen 8\nSE-411 34 G�teborg\n\nPhone: +46-31-138310\nMobile: +46-733-174116\nwww.imbridge.com\n\n\n",
