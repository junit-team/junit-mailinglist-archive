Also I learned something<br/>\nfrom your ideas of pusurading Project/Product manager save some time<br/>\nfor writing Testing code. <br/>\n<br/>\nCheers, <br/>\n- Frank<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, didoss@... wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I think it ultimately comes down to a question of faith.  I truly<br/>\nbelieve that the time I spend working on unit tests of my commercial<br/>\napplication saves me time on the other end.  I can spend an extra<br/>\ncouple of hours writing some tests during my development, in order to<br/>\nsave my team quite a bit of effort down the road,...take this scenario,...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I spend a couple incremental hours writing tests while I develop my<br/>\ncode;<br/>\n&gt; We run a nightly build;<br/>\n&gt; One morning I see that a test has failed;<br/>\n&gt; I spend an hour to fix it;<br/>\n&gt; It makes it to QC and our customer without further incident.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; OR<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I save a couple hours during development and don&#39;t write tests for<br/>\nmy code;<br/>\n&gt; The code gets built and released to our QC department;<br/>\n&gt; They spend a week testing the code, and then find the bug;<br/>\n&gt; I spend an hour to fix it;<br/>\n&gt; The code gets built and released to our QC department;<br/>\n&gt; They start over, with the schedule slipped a week.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; OR<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Same scenario, except that QC doesn&#39;t catch it - the customer does;<br/>\n&gt; we lose face with the customer;<br/>\n&gt; we repeat the full cycle to release, with the schedule slipped by<br/>\nhowever long it took to get to the client.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It is something that you have to sell to product management,...if<br/>\nyou can schedule time for writing tests (and writing before/during<br/>\ndevelopment is less time than after the code is written), and schedule<br/>\ntime to fix bugs correctly (and write/fix tests to make sure it<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t get through again), then you can make your commitments to your<br/>\nclients while providing a quality product that your staff can be proud of.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; my two cents,<br/>\n&gt; Dianne<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -------------- Original message -------------- <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;frank zou&quot; &lt;frankz1998@...&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hi all,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; After lots of reading and trying, I think I understand the following<br/>\n&gt; benefits that Junit-base testing can give us:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; * more robust system<br/>\n&gt; * clean / good design <br/>\n&gt; * less regression bugs <br/>\n&gt; * confidence to do refactorying, especially at the later phase of the<br/>\n&gt; project. <br/>\n&gt; * and lots more...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; These are really good things, for open-source projects where there is<br/>\n&gt; no deadline pressure and resource could almost be thought as<br/>\n&gt; un-limitted. However, for commercial software development, is this<br/>\n&gt; still possible ?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Although I knew JUnit and other JUnit-based open-source tools for a<br/>\n&gt; couple of years, my company and team never really enbrace it. The<br/>\n&gt; major reason is Product Managers always want to add cool features to<br/>\n&gt; the system quickly while programmers find the schedule is always too<br/>\n&gt; tight to spend any extra time to write testing. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I know from the mail list and books that we can take lots of advantage<br/>\n&gt; of JUnit-based testing, I myself have no real hands-on experience on<br/>\n&gt; it. So here are my questions: <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; * Will Junit-based testing make the project time longer or shorter ?<br/>\n&gt; Any hard statistic data ? ( Here I mean commercial project rather than<br/>\n&gt; open-source project. )<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; * One intersting point I found is that after Junit-based testing is<br/>\n&gt; introduced, programmers tend to use IDE debugger much less than<br/>\n&gt; before.  This would save lots of time. Is that true ?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; * Some guys say JUnit is good for biz / util code testing. But for web<br/>\n&gt; application development, where HTML/javascript would be root cause of<br/>\n&gt; lots of bugs, Junit is not so powerful. Any comments ? <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; * How can I convince managers and programmers that JUnit-based is<br/>\n&gt; really possible for commercial software development ? Any differnece<br/>\n&gt; from open-source projects ?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Can some Junit gurus shed some light here ?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks, <br/>\n&gt; - Frank<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; SPONSORED LINKS Basic programming language C programming language<br/>\nComputer programming languages <br/>\n&gt; The c programming language C programming language List of<br/>\nprogramming languages <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; YAHOO!
