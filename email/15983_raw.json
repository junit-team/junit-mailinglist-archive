B. Rainsberger apparently said:\n&gt; Jason Rogers wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; My point was that instead of using string-based reflection, you have a\n&gt; &gt; collection of Adaptors that you can iterate over to get the same\n&gt; &gt; behavior.  How do you get the adaptors?  Use a Factory.\n&gt;\n&gt; I get it; I really do. I&#39;d like to frame my original question within the\n&gt; context of JUnit itself, and not just to bring this back on-topic.[1] A\n&gt; common way to extract test methods from JUnit (3.x) tests is to use a\n&gt; naming convention with reflection. Assume that we do not have access to\n&gt; metainformation such as annotations. How could we allow people to write\n&gt; tests without having to do the kind of double-entry I prefer not to do?\n&gt; In other words, I just want to write a test and JUnit knows it&#39;s a test,\n&gt; rather than having to tell it that. How can we do that without\n&gt; reflection? If there&#39;s a way, I want to know about it, because I&#39;d be\n&gt; missing something valuable!\nAh-ha.  That is a case which the Adaptor-style of PluggableSelector will \nnot cover, but I never claimed it would cover all cases.  FWIW: I don&#39;t \nthink reflection is evil, I just prefer to avoid it if there is another \nviable-not-too-hard-to-implement solution.\n&gt;\n&gt; What I find strange in all this is that I demonstrated doing what JUnit\n&gt; does in another piece of code, and even people who use JUnit looked at\n&gt; me like I was high.[2] Why the double standard? Why does JUnit get to\n&gt; use this pattern and I don&#39;t. It&#39;s just weird, so I&#39;m looking for an\n&gt; explanation by asking the more general question, &quot;What&#39;s so bad about\n&gt; Pluggable Selector?&quot;\nTo answer the question -- nothing.\n\n-- \nJason Rogers\n\n Where there is no vision, the people perish...\n    Proverbs 29:18\n\n\n (&#92; /)\n  0 0     www.squeak.org\n  =*= \n\n\n",
