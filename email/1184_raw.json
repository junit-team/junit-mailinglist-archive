Depending on your current architecture and dependencies between\n&gt;components you will have to create lots of dummy and/or mock objects.\n&gt;Major refactorings might be necessary.\n\nI agree with the granularity point, and we&#39;re certainly trying to \nfollow that guideline.  The rub is two-fold.  First, as mentioned \nbefore, the system (a framework, actually) is some 300-400 classes at \nthis point (and you could double that if you included apps built on \ntop of the framework), and there are a number of layers each building \non those that came before.  Second, all this was designed and built \nseveral years before our lives were blessed by JUnit, so we&#39;re now \ntrying to add tests bit by bit after the fact.  Progress on this has \nbeen at best slow, with most of the added tests being in the lowest \nlayers (where the interactions are minimized).  My worry is that if \nthe only way (or the Right Way) to deal with this involves major \nrefactorings (that are not otherwise seen as important - we&#39;re \nactually quite happy with most of the design), then no one&#39;s going to \nmake it a priority and it isn&#39;t going to happen.\n\n&gt;Maybe a first step could be to give each component its own random number\n&gt;stream. Either for testing only or fpr both test and production.\n\nThis is an interesting idea, and would require further thought.  It&#39;s \nnot immediately clear to me how this would affect the \nbehavior/performance of the system, and it raises some design issues \nwe&#39;d have to work through.  It would, however, make these testing \nissues easier to deal with, and might actually be a Good Thing.\n\nThanks to all for the ideas.\n\n\tNic\n\n",
