The important thing is to identify\nresponsibilities and test them so that you are sure that they work. Some\nprefer to test larger chunks at the time, attack the problem from a\ndifferent direction and so on, that is ok too. The bottom line is that you\nhave to have a /known/ in your test. You have to know what the conditions\nare and how your system should behave with those conditions. Otherwise the\ntest will have to run the same code as the code that is tested which, as you\nsay, provides no value.\n\nI think you do know what to expect, there must be some rule, after all you\nknew how to write the code. I think the problem you are facing is that you\nmaybe want to run the tests in an environment that you don&#39;t control. Why do\nyou want to do that? What is the gain?.\nIf you take control of your environment the testing is simple and consists\nof figuring out how to force your system into situations in which you can be\nsure how it should respond and have enough of those situations so you can be\nsure that your system works. The real gain is when you can write those tests\nas you develop the code and be able to listen to your tests so that they can\ncontribute back to your design.\n\nDoes that make sense or am I completely missing something about what you are\ntrying to do?\n\n\n\nOn 11/14/06, avinash anand &lt;avinash_anand@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;   Hi Shane\n&gt; This here is something different. I want to testh this code in a dynamic\n&gt; enviroment, meaning the system will be feed with different xml files using\n&gt; diffrent permutation and combination. For instance if the current version\n&gt; installed is 7.1.1 and the xml file feed has a version 7.0.1 the code will\n&gt; return 0, if the current version is 6.1.5 and the xml file reads 7.1.0 the\n&gt; code will return 7.1.0 Hence I will never be sure of the expected result.\n&gt;\n&gt; Is there any other way to test the code sent earlier,\n&gt;\n&gt; 1. In term of usability\n&gt; 2. In term of testing exception\n&gt; 3. In term of results\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks\n&gt; Aviansh\n&gt;\n&gt; ----- Original Message ----\n&gt; From: Shane Mingins &lt;shane.mingins@... &lt;shane.mingins%40gmail.com&gt;&gt;\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com &lt;junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, 14 November, 2006 1:50:06 PM\n&gt; Subject: Re: [junit] Promlem in writing Test case\n&gt;\n&gt; On 11/14/06, avinash anand &lt;avinash_anand@ yahoo.co. uk&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Hi All\n&gt; &gt; I am writing a test case in JUnit. The original class GetInfo.java has a\n&gt; method. String getSystemVersion( String str) which is under test. This\n&gt; method is supplied with path variable in form of string from where it reads\n&gt; a xml file to get certain data and return back to the user.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The point of confussion for me is to how to test the method. What should\n&gt; be the actual and expected result. Meaning for getting the expected result I\n&gt; will have to use the same logic as it is in the main code, if I use the same\n&gt; logic to read the xml file then the assert statement would not be meaningful\n&gt; as then the expected and actual results would be same.\n&gt;\n&gt; I am not sure why you have to use the same logic to calculate the\n&gt; expected result?\n&gt;\n&gt; You have an xml file that u will use for the test (I personally might\n&gt; do something different) in which you know what version you expect back\n&gt; ... so you code assert_equals( 0,\n&gt; getinfo.getSystemVe rsion(fileToRetu rnZero)) etc.\n&gt;\n&gt; cheers\n&gt; shane\n&gt;\n&gt; Send instant messages to your online friends http://uk.messenger.yahoo.com\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
