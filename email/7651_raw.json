Cannot deliver without tests, so your delivery is bloated\n2. Personally speaking, it clutters the class definition, making it more\ntime consuming to navigate the file (yes, IDEs can help with this,\nbut...)\n3. Automated suite generation is more difficult\n4. Inner classes are member variables of the object; they usually do\nsomething for the object&#39;s functionality that the object doesn&#39;t want to\ndo itself --&gt; Are your tests really extensions/helpers to your object&#39;s\nfunctionality?\n5. Why not just put it in its own file?  It&#39;s just as easy and not at\nall hard to keep in sync.\n\n=jason\n\nOn Wed, 2003-04-09 at 10:33, Sandy McArthur wrote: Searching the message\narchive there seems to be three common places to\nput your tests.\n\n1) Next to the class you are testing but in the same directory.\n2) Next to the class you are testing but in a different directory.\n3) In a public static inner class.\n\nFrom my current point of view the third option looks the most\nappealing to me but most people seem to recomend the second.\n\nCan anyone give some good reasons to advoid the third choice?
