This way it will be reinstantiated for every single test case.<br/>\nThis is probably the desired behaviour.<br/>\n<br/>\nJohannes<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dnixon@...\">dnixon@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m just getting started using JUnit to test a Swing application.<br/>\n&gt; In my test case I want to manipulate the GUI, eg simulate button<br/>\n&gt; clicks etc. (really I want to invoke the commands the buttons<br/>\n&gt; represent). How can my test case find an instance of the GUI objects<br/>\n&gt; to call? I tried having a static variable that contains the last GUI<br/>\n&gt; screen instance, but this is null inside my test case whereas it<br/>\n&gt; returns a non-null instance when accessed from<br/>\n&gt; my non-Junit code immediately before that.<br/>\n&gt; Am I doing something silly that causes the static access to return<br/>\n&gt; null? My startup code IS a bit &quot;funky&quot; for historical reasons.<br/>\n&gt; Or is there a better way of going about running test cases in GUI<br/>\n&gt; apps?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m using JUnit 3.5 with JDK 1.3 on Windows NT. No IDEs. </span></blockquote></div>",
