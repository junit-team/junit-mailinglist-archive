It<br/>\nrequires you to put your tests in a suite, add the rule on the suite and<br/>\nannotate the rule for propagation to all sub-suites and tests.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure this is exactely what you want, but if it is, you can help by<br/>\nvoting it up it might make it to some future release of JUnit. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<br/>\nDaniel<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Fri, Dec 4, 2009 at 4:34 PM, Bogdan &lt;<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bogdan.mocanu.notifications@...\">bogdan.mocanu.notifications@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi everyone,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; as we have it currently, we can place a Rule in a test, and that rule will<br/>\n&gt; be activated for that test. To have the rule working in several tests, you<br/>\n&gt; have to place the Rule in each test.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; However, I am searching for a way to activate a Rule for all the tests that<br/>\n&gt; are executed, without needing to add the rule to each test. Perhaps by<br/>\n&gt; specifying a Java property parameter when running the tests (I could also<br/>\n&gt; set this as a global Java option, therefore being used upon each execution<br/>\n&gt; of the JVM).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Do you know if this is possible?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The reason why I need this, is: I am making the plans and gathering the<br/>\n&gt; ideas for creating a simple Swing application that will display the results<br/>\n&gt; of the executed tests (just like the JUnit view in Eclipse/Idea/Netbeans,<br/>\n&gt; but perhaps with more details, and also available for anyone, not just IDE<br/>\n&gt; users). Currently I developed a small agent rule, that you can place in your<br/>\n&gt; test, and it will report to the console the status of your tests (the Swing<br/>\n&gt; console runs remotely).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This is ok, but it means that you will have to add this rule to each and<br/>\n&gt; every test that you have. It also means that will not be an easy task to<br/>\n&gt; disable this rule, if you don&#39;t want it anymore.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Therefore a possibility to enable Rules globally for all tests I think is<br/>\n&gt; the best solution for my case, and also a good tool to have for various<br/>\n&gt; other tasks.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What do you think? Also, what do you think about the Swing console idea?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Cheers,<br/>\n&gt; Bogdan<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>-- <br/>\n---------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nDaniel Brolund<br/>\nAgical AB - www.agical.com<br/>\n<br/>\nwork: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:daniel.brolund@...\">daniel.brolund@...</a><br/>\nphone: +46708754002<br/>\nblog:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://danielbrolund.wordpress.com\">http://danielbrolund.wordpress.com</a><br/>\ntwitter: @danielbrolund<br/>\nprivate: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:daniel.brolund@...\">daniel.brolund@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
