And\n&gt; &gt; then write unit tests that make sure your code works as you expect,\n&gt; &gt; including that it detects the faulty preconditions and invariants.\n&gt;\n&gt; Absolutely. Much better than sticking my head in the sand and  \n&gt; pretending\n&gt; the preconditions will never be violated, and it&#39;s not my fault what\n&gt; happens if they are.\n\nCertainly.  Sticking your head in the sand is irresponsible.\n\nSo, to sum up.  If you are building a library for other people to  \ncall, then you should write unit tests for that library, complete  \nwith unit tests for all the exceptions that your library will throw  \nbecause of violated preconditions.  These unit tests will provide  \npart of the documentation that will help your callers avoid those  \nexceptions.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; A side note: when you write code for checking preconditions, code\n&gt; coverage tools like Cobertura will usually alert you if you&#39;ve  \n&gt; forgotten\n&gt; to test one. (Yes, I know we should have written the test first, but\n&gt; we&#39;re all imperfect and sometimes miss a case.) if there&#39;s no code to\n&gt; test the precondition, there&#39;s also no warning that you&#39;ve  \n&gt; forgotten to\n&gt; write the test for it.\n\nAgreed.  I use Clover myself, but Cobertura looks pretty good.   \nEmploying code coverage tools is an important part of any testing  \nstrategy because, as you say, even test-firsters can&#39;t think of every  \ntest case.  Ensuring your code is covered with tests is simply part  \nof every professional programmer&#39;s daily job.\n\n\n----\nRobert C.
