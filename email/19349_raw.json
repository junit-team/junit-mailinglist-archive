Let me state it better: I dislike it when \nyou bring dogma into the discussion, as it weakens--for me--the power \nand credibility of the underlying ideas. It&#39;s as though they aren&#39;t \nstrong enough to merit consideration without assuming the intent of the \n&quot;other side&quot;.\n\n&gt; As a matter of fact, thank you for taking the time to comment on it.\n&gt; Testivus is meant to start discussions, not to end them :-).\n\nAbsolutely. Still, I think I would prefer the Testivus message if it \nwere, rather than apposite to dogma, more a message of &quot;not everyone has \na clear mental model of how this works; many of us struggle with it; \nhere are some talking points or pointers that will help those in that \nposition.&quot; Of course, you&#39;d need to make it far less condescending than \nI just did. Call it a draft. :)\n-- \nJ. B.
