The most obvious question I&#39;d ask is &quot;How big is the<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, I think in same way, but I still ordered to move more code to XML<br/>\nto make it more configurable. Yes, ordered.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  application?&quot; It might be too big and needs to be modularized. Another<br/>\n&gt;  question I&#39;d ask is &quot;What do your layers look like?&quot; It might be poorly<br/>\n&gt;  layered.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Very likely there are room of improvement. However, I think, if the<br/>\nmanagement put configurable as the highest priority, moving most class<br/>\nmember to XML configuration (spring in our case) . No matter how well<br/>\nthe modularized / layering, there still a lot of config file and make<br/>\nthing more complicate than it should be.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  Also, why do we need to test our configuration files? I was under the<br/>\n&gt;  impression that the goal of externalizing configuration is to make it<br/>\n&gt;  /easy/ to change how the application behaves. If that&#39;s no longer easy,<br/>\n&gt;  we must stop externalizing configuration data and figure out what we&#39;re<br/>\n&gt;  doing wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Interesting it can be easier in some organization, once the<br/>\napplication pressed UAT and if some thing required code change, we<br/>\nneed to complete a number of process like &quot;permit to build&quot; , &quot;user<br/>\napproval&quot;, &quot;cost estimation&quot; ......  Moving code to config in fact<br/>\nprovide &quot;hole&quot; to bypassed all those procedures to make quick change.<br/>\nAnd that is the reason why management prefer more config.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can understand, what I think we can improve is there are some<br/>\nvariable that is just not make sense to be configurable, like change<br/>\nthe default will break the application, but we still ordered to make<br/>\nit configurable just because there are possible to change.....<br/>\n<br/>\nActually it is off-topic a lot. in fact I just like to make the point<br/>\nthat IoC framework is not magic and there are cases that using pattern<br/>\nlike &quot;only create once&quot; is better to make it configurable. In fact, I<br/>\nthink this case is a lot more than we expect.</div>",
