The response that preceded that one didn&#39;t get posted. The missing post contained the following:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Nice! Thanks Bill for coming up with the idea of a custom suite runner, and thanks David for writing such a runner! There were a couple of minor snags with your attempt below, but with some minor tweaks, it seems to be working nicely.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 1. [compile time issue] The @RunWith needs to fully qualify OnceOnlySuite (i.e., prefix it with &#39;All.&#39;) I decided to just make it a public top-level class since its use will not be tied to a particular suite.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Have you tested it as written?  There should only ever be one of the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; internal RunnerBuilders constructed, if my brain&#39;s on right, so it<br/>\n&gt;&gt; should work.  If it doesn&#39;t, please let me know so I can adjust my<br/>\n&gt;&gt; brain.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I tested it as written in that the Set was an instance field of the RunnerBuilder, and it didn&#39;t work because multiple RunnerBuilders are instantiated. That&#39;s because multiple OnceOnlySuite runners instantiated. In my example, I annotated A and B to each run with OnceOnlySuite. I did not annotate &#39;All&#39; to use OnceOnlySuite because in my real-world scenario, the All suite does have tests that we want to run multiple times (against different targets).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Ahh.
