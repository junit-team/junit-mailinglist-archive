The point here is building an entire set of test framework for testing this server would require tremendeous efforts and time. Which even if I achieve would not be that worthy as <br/>\n<br/>\n1. It would always have static lines around it.<br/>\n2. Productive result Vs. Man hour consumed would be very less.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo can you suggest me any other way to nail down the problem.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\nAvinash<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n----- Original Message ----<br/>\nFrom: Lasse Koskela &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lasse.koskela@...\">lasse.koskela@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Monday, 18 December, 2006 3:07:05 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [junit] Test a remote server<br/>\n<br/>\nHi Avinash,<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 12/18/06, avinash anand &lt;avinash_anand@ yahoo.co. uk&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Now the problem is I want to write unit test cases on this testServer<br/>\n&gt; which is a Java code. Since the test suite will be written in eclipse<br/>\n&gt; IDE, how will it test the actuall testServer class which is running<br/>\n&gt; in the live enviroment.<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel I need to point out that what you&#39;re describing is not a unit<br/>\ntest but more of a functional test. Unit tests test a single object or<br/>\na small group of objects collaborating together. Unit tests don&#39;t<br/>\ninvolve running the whole system.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, it&#39;s a question of vocabulary but vocabulary is important.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, on to your problem...<br/>\n<br/>\nOn 12/18/06, avinash anand &lt;avinash_anand@ yahoo.co. uk&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; There is a system which you install (a multi-box installation) Which<br/>\n&gt; has the ORB server as the parent one. Other servers are scattered<br/>\n&gt; over other machines. Now I write a test server and copy the binary<br/>\n&gt; of the test server in the BIN directory. With the help of Admin console<br/>\n&gt; I start my test server and perform various operation viz start the<br/>\n&gt; server, load configuration parameters. The actuall operation of<br/>\n&gt; server is totally dependent on other servers. When a request comes<br/>\n&gt; to this test server from say server1 it performs some operation e.g<br/>\n&gt; fetches some database records and then forward a responce to<br/>\n&gt; Server2. It is this ways the system operates.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; There is no way that this test server can be run independently.<br/>\n&gt; Neither there is any way to run this server from any IDE as all its<br/>\n&gt; inputs and behaviour are dependent on other servers and<br/>\n&gt; services which are Native code.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy do you say that there is no way for the server to run<br/>\nindependently? Why cannot the server be deployed with a set of fake<br/>\nservers?<br/>\n<br/>\nLasse<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n___________________________________________________________ <br/>\nNow you can scan emails quickly with a reading pane.
