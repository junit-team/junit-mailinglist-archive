This idea comes from a path  breaking production \ntechnique called pokayoke in which you purposefully introduce a small \ndesign change so that the product can pass over the assembly line \nonly if it is 100% free of defects.\n\nPassing over assembly line is equivalent of compiling the branch for \nour code. I will try to think over and implement this idea where I \nwork.\n\n- Nils\n\n\n",
