I use a mix of Maven 1, Ant and shell scripts for builds, and some people here prefer to write code in IntelliJ or even vim. My suggestion would be an external file, crap4j.config perhaps, in the classpath somewhere, and have it contain entries like:\n\nIgnore:\ncom.pjacobsson.crap.*\ncom.pjacobsson.SomeClass\ncom.pjacobsson.SomeOtherClass.crappyMethod\n\nAn @Ignore annotation on class or method level could be a nice addition for some cases, but it should be optional. I&#39;d prefer to not have dependencies from the code to tools like crap4j, at least not in an early stage.\n\nAlso, it could be useful to be able to set an &quot;acceptable CRAP score&quot; on method level, and if it goes above that the method should show up in the reports. Just to make sure that bad code doesn&#39;t get any worse.\n\nHope that&#39;s useful.\n/ Per\n\n________________________________\nFrom: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of Bob Evans\nSent: Thursday, November 15, 2007 10:41 PM\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: Re: [junit] Crap4j - Feedback and suggestions wanted\n\nHi Per,\n\nWe are focusing on the ability to filter tests in the Eclipse plugin\nand in the Ant task for our next\niteration. It would be great to hear how you and others would like the\nfeature to work. We&#39;ll try to incorporate those suggestions.\n\nBob\n\nhttp://www.crap4j.org/\nCompare Your Code CRAP Score\n\nOn Nov 5, 2007, at 5:58 PM, Per Jacobsson wrote:\n\n&gt; I just tried out the plug-in on some of my projects and the metrics\n&gt; look interesting.\n&gt;\n&gt; One quick suggestion: Some filtering functionality would be nice,\n&gt; perhaps just the ability to exclude certain packages from the\n&gt; reports. Right now, one-shot code that I know is crap, and already\n&gt; scheduled to be deprecated or deleted, of course shows up at the top\n&gt; of the list. That makes it harder to spot the methods that really\n&gt; need to be looked at.\n&gt; / Per\n&gt;\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
