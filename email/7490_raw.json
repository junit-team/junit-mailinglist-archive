And it can \nprovide many more benefits than JUnit and TDD can offer.\n\nLook at that example.\n\n\t/*\n\t * precondition:  dividers[n] != 0\n\t * postcondition: result[n] == denominator/dividers[n]\n\t */\n\tint[] divide(int denominator, int[] dividers) {\n\t  int[] divisions = new int[dividers.length];\n\t  \n\t  for (int i = 0; i &lt; dividers.length; i++) {\n\t\tint divider = dividers[i];\n\t\tdivisions[i] = denominator / divider;\n\t  }\n\t  return divisions;\n\t}\n\nInvariants would not be used here since invariants apply to the class \nand not to methods. They can be used for interactions or dependencies \nbetween methods.\n\nIt should be very easy to modify the java compiler to check whether \nthe implementation obeys the preconditions and postconditions and \ninvariants. If not, then either the implementation is buggy or the \ncontract.\n\nAs an alternative you can use Design by Contract to automatically \ncreate test cases (including test data).\n\nHowever you use Design by Contract: You save a lot of time compared \nto JUnit and TDD. And you aren&#39;t driven to use TDD. You are free. \nBesides this you have a very nice documentation (Contracts), much \nmore helpful than the JUnit test &quot;documentation&quot;.\n\nThink about it.\n\n\n\n",
