I&#39;m new to unit testing so please bear with me. I have a\nmetho=\r\nd that contains a lot of try and catch statements:\n\ntry{\n\tstatement1\n\tstate=\r\nment2\n}\ncatch(ExceptionType1 e1){\n\tSystem.err.println(&quot;The following except=\r\nion occurred &quot; +\ne1.toString());\n}\n\nI know that this is not a very good way=\r\n of handling exceptions but I&#39;m\nstruggling to find a better way. Another al=\r\nternative is to use a logger\nsuch as log4j, but this does not help much. Th=\r\ne problem is how do I test\nif the method is not working properly, as the ex=\r\nception was caught and\nwon&#39;t be visible to JUnit.\n\nThe most obvious solutio=\r\nn would be to let the method throw all\nexceptions that are generated. The p=\r\nroblem is that there are 5 or 6\ndifferent types of exceptions that this met=\r\nhod can generate and this\nseems to make my code very messy.\n\nCould anyone p=\r\nlease tell me what is the proper approach to this, or\nrefer me to any relev=\r\nant reading.\n\nThanks in advance.\nPico\n\n\n\n\n\n",
