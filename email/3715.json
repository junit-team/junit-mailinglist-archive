All the test runner does is to take a look at the <br/>\nclass and use reflection to see if there is a &quot;public static Test <br/>\nsuite()&quot; method to invoke.  So you don&#39;t have to extend TestSuite.  This <br/>\nis a good thing because you might want to extend some other class.<br/>\n<br/>\nShane<br/>\n<br/>\ngavinlas wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;Hello,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I worked it out. You need to define a static method:<br/>\n&gt;public static TestSuite suite() {<br/>\n&gt;    return new MyTestSuite();<br/>\n&gt;}<br/>\n&gt;in the test case. It is not enough to just extend TestSuite, as many <br/>\n&gt;of the tools do not use the extended TestSuite but instantiate their <br/>\n&gt;own.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Cheers<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
