He\n&gt; &gt; states &quot;that a test suite that covers one implementation of a\n&gt; &gt; specification does not necessarily cover a different\n&gt; &gt; implementation of the same specification&quot;.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I interpret &quot;not necessarily&quot; as &quot;there&#39;s no such thing in\n&gt; &gt; the general case&quot;. One short example which is hopefully\n&gt; &gt; obvious enough this time. Consider a function for sorting an\n&gt; &gt; array of String objects:\n&gt;\n&gt; [Snipping a bunch of stuff]\n&gt;\n&gt; In reality, you *can* have the best of both worlds.  The\n&gt; issue at hand is that a general test case excercises all the\n&gt; contracts that the public interface has.  A contract is a\n&gt; guarantee that the class must satisfy.\n&gt;\n&gt; [...]\n&gt; If what you are talking about is different than what I just\n&gt; described, perhaps it is because we&#39;re not speaking the same\n&gt; language?\n\nMaybe, let me summarize in my language:\nWhat you say is that one can have sufficiently stable software and\nsufficient coverage with test cases that consider the external contracts\nonly. What I say is that one cannot go beyond a certain level of quality,\ni.e. below a certain MTBF, without implementation-aware test cases. As long\nas your &quot;sufficiently stable&quot; is below that level, everything&#39;s fine. My\nguess is that this can be achieved for most application fields.\nHowever, I&#39;m also guessing that one can be testing more efficiently (less\ntesting effort for same quality) with looking at the implementation than\nwithout looking at it.\n\nJohannes\n\n\n",
