So, I have modified testA, which directly tests classA, but <br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t realize that I have broken something in testC.  My solution is<br/>\n&gt; that we run nightlybuilds, and I check the errors/failures the next <br/>\n&gt; morning to see if my code changes could have caused any of them.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It would be nice to be a little more proactive, though,...being able<br/>\n&gt; to (easily) find all the tests that are ultimately affected by my <br/>\n&gt; code change (iterating through the workspace references until I <br/>\n&gt; terminate at all classes that start with &quot;Test&quot;, or that are in my <br/>\n&gt; test branch).  I know that I can do this manually through Eclipse, <br/>\n&gt; but it is not fun - and therefore doesn&#39;t get done.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>How long does it take to run all your tests? That would be the obvious<br/>\nfirst answer, I&#39;d suggest.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, if you try to make your tests only test a single unit, that<br/>\nhelps a lot - and using mock objects helps there (I use EasyMock<br/>\nmyself). It certainly doesn&#39;t solve the problem 100%, but it&#39;s a good<br/>\nstart.<br/>\n<br/>\nJon</div>",
