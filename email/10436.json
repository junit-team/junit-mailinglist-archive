Custom classloaders should override loadClass(), not findClass().  findClass() should be called automatically, if necessary, by the JVM&#39;s ClassLoader.  Typically if you violate the ClassLoader API contract like this you&#39;ll run into nasty problems like the problems JUnit has with reloading classes.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy not just take JUnit and customize/fix the source for your needs?  Certainly would be easier for someone like me to comprehend your changes here, since I am more familiar with JUnit&#39;s code than your project&#39;s code.  There are definitely some corners in JUnit where you&#39;ll find it necessary (and usually much easier) to modify JUnit itself to do what you want.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest,<br/>\nScott Stirling<br/>\n<br/>\n***********************************************************************<br/>\nThis message is intended only for the use of the intended recipient and<br/>\nmay contain information that is PRIVILEGED and/or CONFIDENTIAL.
