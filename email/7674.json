The first method would be called before the <br/>\ntesting is started. The second method he wants to call after testing <br/>\nis finished.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat he wants is to do in makeTestData() is to write test data into <br/>\nthe database for testing purposes. So he thinks we don&#39;t need Mock <br/>\nobjects.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are not experienced both. But I read a lot of Mock objects.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe also objects that the JUnit testing would be done only with Mock <br/>\nobjects.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do you think? Is it better to use Mock objects or to do it like <br/>\nmy coworker wants?</div>",
