I=\r\nt\nhas more features, makes very clever use of generics and has much better\n=\r\nstatic typing than JMock (where you still specify methods with Strings).\n\nI=\r\n would suggest trying both thoroughly before making a choice.\n\n-- \nCedric\nh=\r\nttp://testng.org\n\n\nOn 12/2/06, David Saff &lt;saff@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; On 12/1=\r\n/06, Jeff Langr &lt;jeff@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; I experimented with one of =\r\nthe frameworks a good while ago.
