Only problem is, I already have those lines.\n\nThe root of the problem for me was that I had jrun.jar in my \nclasspath. jrun.jar is an 8 meg monster that comes with JRun4 and \nincludes its own copy of the sax classes. Taking jrun.jar out of my \nclasspath solved the problem and the tests ran fine.\n\nIf anyone happens to know why, I&#39;d like to hear it.\n\n\n\n\n",
