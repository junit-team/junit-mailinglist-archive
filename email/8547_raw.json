While using the junit and \njunitreport tasks in ant I found that you can control whether the \ntests show up as different line items in the report, or all as part \nof the parent. In this way, you junit reports generated by ant can \nbe truly &quot;class-based&quot;. For those familiar with ant, I use the \nbatchtest task to select my test cases based on the class name. All \nclasses that end in &quot;Test.class&quot; get run. Therefore, if my inner \nclass name ends in Test then in the report you get \nOuterClassTest$InnerTest (establishing a hierarchy in the test \nlisting. Otherwise, you can have all of the test methods appear \nunder the single OuterClassTest entry by naming the inner classes \nsomething else. Pretty handy...\n\nRegards,\n\nJosh\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Tharp, Joshua L, SOLGV&quot; \n&lt;jltharp@a...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; [JBR]\n&gt; ...Agreed, and so using nested classes for related fixtures is not \na bad\n&gt; idea at all. I just don&#39;t think that it&#39;s necessarily any clearer: \nit&#39;s\n&gt; just all in one file rather than in three.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Your points are good, but they seem to boil down to having several\n&gt; different classes with good names and all will be right with the \nworld.\n&gt; While that may be true, the problem I have is more at the package \nscope.\n&gt; When looking at a directory, how do you know where to start \nlooking? The\n&gt; reason I like the inner classes is that you can set up a test \nsuite of\n&gt; sorts in an obviously named class. With those inner classes, you \ncan\n&gt; still have several test files that support that main one, but if \nyou are\n&gt; entering a directory to investigate someone else&#39;s testing \nstrategy,\n&gt; then having a well-defined starting point is a great help. Don&#39;t \nget me\n&gt; wrong, you can still use several different files, so long as they \nare\n&gt; referenced from within an obviously named one. Using your Bag \nexamples,\n&gt; I would say that the BagTest should refer to the other two, and \npossibly\n&gt; a third that actually has the run-of-the-mill type tests. That \nway, when\n&gt; entering a directory with tests for 20 or more classes (look at\n&gt; java.util for example), I could find BagTest.java quickly and from \nthere\n&gt; discover the other test classes that are directly applicable.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Granted, this is all beginning to sound like the student teaching \nthe\n&gt; teacher, but while I lack some JUnit experience, the software\n&gt; engineering experience is there. One of the hardest things about\n&gt; approaching a body of source code (production or test) is figuring \nout\n&gt; where to start. To that end, it seems having a single, well-named\n&gt; starting point makes great strides.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Josh\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
