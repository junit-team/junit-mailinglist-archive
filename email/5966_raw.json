I want\n&gt; to walk through the tree recursively and check the URL at each node.\n&gt; If one of the URLs are corrupted I want to throw a failure or an\n&gt; error and proceed with checking.\n&gt;\n&gt; What I don&#39;t want to have is to fill a Map or something like that,\n&gt; where I collect corrupted URLs, while I don&#39;t throw a failure each\n&gt; time i foun a bad URL, but printing the corruptedLinksList after\n&gt; TestTermination.\n&gt; Insted of this, I would like to generate a TestCase for each URL in\n&gt; the tree dynamicaly at runtime and run this TestCase at each URL-node\n&gt; of the tree.\n&gt; Is this possible? Is there any example, how to do this? Does anyone\n&gt; have any better idea?\n&gt;\n&gt; Have a nice and peacefull day!\n&gt;\n&gt;     Wolfgang\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
