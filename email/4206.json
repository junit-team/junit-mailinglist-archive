I found out that &quot;use <br/>\ntest method to explain the method&quot; works well with paired programming (I <br/>\nguess it is definitely a good thing for XPers), while it is sometimes <br/>\nnot that easy to look at someone else&#39; test case and try to figure out <br/>\nwhat in the world he/she was trying to do. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nShane<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nDisclaimer:  I join all the news groups out of my own interest.

The source for the first class should <br/>\n&gt;be  src&#92;package1&#92;package2&#92;Untitled1.java and the second should be <br/>\n&gt;test&#92;package1&#92;package2&#92;TestUntitled1.  Notice how they differ at the <br/>\n&gt;root level but same all the way down?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;To compile the file, you just need to specify your source path as <br/>\n&gt;&quot;-sourcepath src;test&quot;.  Most of the IDE these days support multiple <br/>\n&gt;source paths (I cannot say ALL just becasue I haven&#39;t seen ALL).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Shane<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
