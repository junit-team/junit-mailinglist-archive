JUnit as a political gesture celebrates the ability of \n&gt; programmers\n&gt; &gt; to test their own software. The code and tests must be held to a\n&gt; &gt; higher standard, to demonstrate the techniques necessary to uphold\n&gt; &gt; our end of the bargain.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;d like to add two aspects:\n&gt; - JUnit should be the stable angle for the very unstable \n&gt; projects we all\n&gt; have to do. Changing too much jeopardizes stableness.\n&gt; - When adding too much non-core functionality one quickly \n&gt; looses focus of\n&gt; the core parts. Very often the extra functionality is not \n&gt; exactly what I\n&gt; need in a specific situation, so I have to reimplement it \n&gt; anyway. If the\n&gt; unneeded and unwanted part of a tool is prevailing many will \n&gt; move towards\n&gt; starting from scratch with a new (small) framework. That&#39;s \n&gt; why I&#39;d rather\n&gt; have JUnit as a core with hooks to plug in additional \n&gt; behaviour which is\n&gt; available in additional tools.\n&gt; \n&gt; BTW, is the move to version 4 as described in\n&gt; http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?JunitNextRelease\n&gt; an &quot;official&quot; thing, i.e. promoted by Kent and Erich?\n&gt; \n&gt; Johannes\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
