At no costs I want to manually\nexclude the test classes during shipment. Addiditonally I simply find\nthis approach more structured - in our last project we had for each\npackage a .test package. \nThe separate package however has the main drawback for me that I cant\ntest package private methods. This forces me to make more methods\npublic than I want just for testing purposes. \n\nWhat are your experiences and preferences in this area ? \n\nChris Lewold \n\n\n",
