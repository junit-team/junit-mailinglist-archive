I<br/>\nchose the words carefully because I believe that *some* dogma is<br/>\nnecessary - one has to have a basic position, some ground on which to<br/>\nstand - hence the phrase &quot;LESS unit testing dogma&quot; as opposed to &quot;NO<br/>\nunit testing dogma.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nTestivus itself can be seen as dogmatic in a few places.  For example,<br/>\n&quot;If you write code write tests&quot;, is not exactly wishy-washy about the<br/>\nfact that developers should test.  Here&#39;s the text:<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Testivus snippet ---<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you write code, write tests<br/>\n====================<br/>\n<br/>\nThe pupil asked the master programmer:<br/>\n<br/>\n     &quot;When can I stop writing tests?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe master answered:<br/>\n<br/>\n     &quot;When you stop writing code.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe pupil asked:<br/>\n<br/>\n     &quot;When do I stop writing code?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe master answered:<br/>\n<br/>\n     &quot;When you become a manager.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe pupil trembled and asked:<br/>\n<br/>\n     &quot;When do I become a manager?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe master answered:<br/>\n<br/>\n     &quot;When you stop writing tests.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe pupil rushed to write some tests. He left skid marks.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the code deserves to be written, it deserves to have tests.<br/>\n<br/>\n--- end of Testivus snippet ---<br/>\n<br/>\nThe epigram &quot;Don&#39;t get stuck on unit testing dogma&quot; is aimed as much at<br/>\nTestivus as it is to anything else, and the key part of the sentence is<br/>\n&quot;Don&#39;t get STUCK&quot;, don&#39;t let blind following of dogma kill your<br/>\ncreativity or your flexibility.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope this clarifies things somewhat.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlberto<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
