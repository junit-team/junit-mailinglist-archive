By looking at it<br/>\n&gt; I<br/>\n&gt; assume...<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, yes. I&#39;m assuming that I wrote both the tests and the production code to <br/>\npass it. This point was merely stating the obvious.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; * Are sufficiently implementation-independent to support easier<br/>\n&gt; refactoring<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; When your tests only use the public interfaces they usually don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; break<br/>\n&gt; during refactoring. They might become redundant, i.e. worthless, when<br/>\n&gt; you<br/>\n&gt; test a special case which is no special case in the new refactored<br/>\n&gt; implementation any more.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Redundant is *not* worthless in this case! If you refactor again, later, the <br/>\nredundant tests may no longer be redundant. That was the thrust of this second <br/>\npoint: it&#39;s not enough to cover the current implementation, one must try to <br/>\ncover the problem with one&#39;s tests. The idea is to have a set of tests that <br/>\nwould indicate whether any reasonable implementation of the feature would work. <br/>\nI&#39;m not saying that this is easy.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; * Run quickly, are small, easy to read...<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I realize that these are competing forces, so the challenge is<br/>\n&gt; striking<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; right balance. I find my life difficult when my tests get in the way<br/>\n&gt; of my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; refactorings... tests that have intimate knowledge of the<br/>\n&gt; implementation<br/>\n&gt; tend<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to be refactoring-resistant. I tend away from them if I can.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; That&#39;s a very [g]ood heuristic for deciding if it&#39;s worth writing a test<br/>\n&gt; or<br/>\n&gt; not: asking if the test will probably stay around with the next<br/>\n&gt; functionality or not. This is my biggest concern I have with doing<br/>\n&gt; endo-testing using mock objects.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Where do you think our views still differ?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not sure they do, and I wasn&#39;t necessarily trying to get into a long <br/>\ndiscussion of white box v. black box. JUnit allows both, and anyway, one man&#39;s <br/>\nblack box is another man&#39;s white box.<br/>\n<br/>\nJ. B.
