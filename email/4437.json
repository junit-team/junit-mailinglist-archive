We&#39;d like to <br/>\nbe able to test whether or not they have implemented the methods <br/>\nwe&#39;ve defined in our interfaces correctly. These tests will include <br/>\nverifying that the listeners, events, and graphics do what they&#39;re <br/>\nsupposed to do. Obviously, the graphics portion must be verified <br/>\nvisually, but what about the non-visual portions? <br/>\n<br/>\nCan JUnit test this? <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks, <br/>\n<br/>\nAdam</div>",
