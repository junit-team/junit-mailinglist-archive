    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1985112532\">Hi,<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m interested in this, though for slightly different reasons, maybe we<br/>\ncould exchange ideas on this. I haven&#39;t exactly thought this through in<br/>\ndetail, but I think my requirements come down to being able to store<br/>\narbitrary information in a Description, a key.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m interesting in testing with Scala, and there are (at least) two generic<br/>\nproblems:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Tests which are not linked to a specific method, but are run as separate<br/>\ntests. Scalatest for example allows the following<br/>\n<br/>\n@RunWith(classOf[JUnitRunner])<br/>\nclass FileSpec extends FlatSpec with ShouldMatchers {<br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot;A Stack&quot; should &quot;pop values in last-in-first-out order&quot; in {<br/>\n  }<br/>\n<br/>\n  it should &quot;throw NoSuchElementException if an empty stack is popped&quot; in {<br/>\n  }<br/>\n}<br/>\n<br/>\nThis creates a single method with the two tests within. However, the<br/>\nJUnitRunner runs the single method but records the two tests separately.<br/>\nThis can be seen in Eclipse, see attached scalatest1.png. Now if I double<br/>\nclick on the test name in the junit view, it tries to find a method of that<br/>\nname, and fails. Obviously, to correct this would require a fix to Eclipse,<br/>\nbut if I could store the file & line number instead of the method name, I<br/>\ncould jump to the appropriate line.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Scala allows spaces and other characters in method names, but these<br/>\nnames are munged on compilation. For instance, space gets translated to<br/>\n$0020.<br/>\n<br/>\nclass FileTest extends AssertionsForJUnit {<br/>\n@Test def `foo bar`() = {<br/>\n<br/>\n}<br/>\n}<br/>\n<br/>\nHere the jump to in Eclipse works correctly, but the displayed description<br/>\nin Eclipse isn&#39;t nice, see scalatest2.png.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo in both cases, the string I would like to display (in Eclipse, surefire<br/>\nwhatever) doesn&#39;t match the method name, either because there is no method<br/>\nname or because It&#39;s not the same thing. I think that I could work around<br/>\nmost issues is Eclipse etc if the test runner could add some arbitrary<br/>\ninformation to the description, which it could subsequently use. A string<br/>\nwould be fine, because I could define the contents of that String, but<br/>\narbitrary data would be even better. String would be simpler for everyone I<br/>\nthink.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease note that I&#39;m just thinking aloud at the minute, and I haven&#39;t<br/>\nactually done any proof of concepts as yet, but if you have any ideas,<br/>\nplease feel free to take this to email.<br/>\n<br/>\nMatthew Farwell.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
