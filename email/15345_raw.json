Sure, if you&#39;re just playing around in your \nown code base with a few people, maybe you can get away with this. \nHowever, API design techniques that work well amongst friends don&#39;t \nalways scale to the audience size achieved by JUnit. If you&#39;re \ndeveloping serious library software that&#39;s intended for many thousands \nof people to use, most of  whom you&#39;ve never met and most of whom you \nnever will, then there&#39;s no middle ground. Commit to what you&#39;re willing \nto promise, document it well, and then hide everything else.*\n\n-- \n﻿Elliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nXML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim\n\n* Current versions of Java don&#39;t actually allow one to &quot;technically \nenforce&quot; the hiding as much as I would like. The sun packages are one \nexample of things that really shouldn&#39;t be public, but need to be due to \nthe limitations of the language. This may be partially addressed in Java \n7, Dolphin. And of course reflection allows you to access even the \nprivate parts of any class you like. But to the extent, the hiding can \nbe technically enforced, it should be.\n\n\n",
