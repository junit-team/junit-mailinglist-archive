I believe that mixing languages\n&gt; &gt; &gt; rather than switching com=\r\npletely from one language to another is going\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to be more and more imp=\r\nortant. As I explored the subject i found\n&gt; &gt; &gt; myself lacking some tools. =\r\nI was frustrated by the fact that I had to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; maintain two sets of tests=\r\n and look for feedback in two different\n&gt; &gt; &gt; locations while developing.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I created a custom runner for JUnit to address the subject and I=\r\n think\n&gt; &gt; &gt; it looks promising. I created a blog entry with some more deta=\r\nils in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; case anyone is interested:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://johlrogge.wordpr=\r\ness.com/2007/09/08/hybrid-theory/\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I have some loose plans on op=\r\nen-sourcing this but I would like to see\n&gt; &gt; &gt; if there are others than me =\r\nthat find this interesting enough to be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; worth the effort before I do.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; /Joakim Ohlrogge\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yahoo!
