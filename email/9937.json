Lately, <br/>\n&gt; I have started introducing JUnit, on the grounds that the sooner I teach <br/>\n&gt; them good habits, the more likely they are to stick with them. I&#39;m using <br/>\n&gt; the java.lang.String class as the object being tested, so that we only <br/>\n&gt; have to worry about writing one class instead of two.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My question is: When testing overloaded methods (String.indexOf() in <br/>\n&gt; this specific case), is it better for each overloaded method get it&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; own testXXX() method or is it ok to lump them all in the one test? I <br/>\n&gt; have them all in one test right now, on the grounds that the test is <br/>\n&gt; against the index feature, rather than the individual methods.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thoughts please.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I prefer one assertion per test. (I am not going to debate this again, <br/>\nas I did on, I believe, the TDD or XP list for some weeks.) As a result, <br/>\neach time I verify indexOf(), it would likely be in a different test.<br/>\n<br/>\nLumping the assertions in one test:<br/>\nPRO: Easier to write the test<br/>\nCON: If assertion #3 fails, assertion #5 never executes<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a specific case of putting five tests (or n, for some n &gt; 1) <br/>\ninto one test. If one of those assertions fails, the whole test fails. <br/>\nIs that the behavior you&#39;d expect? If not, then write separate tests. If <br/>\nso, then write it as one big test.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
