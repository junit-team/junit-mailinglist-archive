Is this<br/>\n&gt; sufficient for your purposes or do you need to be notified when a class&#39;<br/>\n&gt; tests are about to be run and have finished running?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sincerely yours,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Kent Beck<br/>\n&gt; Three Rivers Institute<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hi Kent,<br/>\n<br/>\nThat sounds promising, so I&#39;ll pull my finger out and take a more thorough<br/>\nlook at the JUnit 4 source and Java 5 stuff this weekend and try to get a<br/>\nfeel for it.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy use case for JUnit 3 was to be notified when a TestSuite that I had<br/>\ncreated, rather than an implicit one that JUnit creates for you, was about<br/>\nto start processing and had finished processing. This nicely let me capture<br/>\na hierarchical view of all the TestSuites that had run. I ended up modifying<br/>\nmy TestRunner, since I had constant known case of always having the same<br/>\nlevel of nesting for my constructed TestSuites.<br/>\n<br/>\nA quick scan of the Version4 branch found the the note in the to-do.txt file<br/>\nabout meeting the needs of runner developers! I appreciate that writing a<br/>\nTestRunner like this is a somewhat specialized activity versus everyday use,<br/>\nbut was wondering if there has been any provision in JUnit 4 for authors of<br/>\nTestRunners - could you provide any more detail about envisaged use cases?<br/>\n<br/>\nJames<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
