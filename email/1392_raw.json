How did you\n&gt;&gt;accomplish it?  In particular, how could you drive a Swing GUI?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;By &quot;Functional Tests&quot;, I mean tests that check the entire application\n&gt;&gt;as a black-box (or very near to black-box testing).  It would launch\n&gt;&gt;the appliction, drive the GUI, and interpret the output of the system.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;My team has been very sucessful with Unit Testing, and we want to\n&gt;&gt;advance to running Functional Tests.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;- Greg\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt;&gt;junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Your use of Yahoo!
