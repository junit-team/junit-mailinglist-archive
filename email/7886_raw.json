B. Rainsberger&quot; &lt;jbrains@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt;What about Ant makes it difficult to manage widely-ranging dependencies\n&gt;and tasks? If Ant can do what make can do, when why is Ant any less\n&gt;suited to building the JDK/JVM than make?\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;So said Timothy Wall on 4/27/2003 --------------------\n&gt;&gt;Aside from neither of these existing when they originally set up the \n&gt;&gt;build and test processes, ant is less suited than make to managing a \n&gt;&gt;large, complex project that consists of a wide range dependencies and\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;tasks.  Can you imaging trying to use ant to build a VM?\n&gt;&gt;\n \nIn short, because ANT doesn&#39;t have built-in, precompiled and configured \ndependency rules and flags for things like &quot;cc&quot;, &quot;ld&quot;, and so on.  These are things that \nare trivially constructed in a shell call or make dependency rules, but rather complex, \nverbose, and circuitous when wrapped in XML.\n\nYes, ant *can* do other things besides compile sets of java files for use by javac and \njar, but it&#39;s not necessarily well-suited to do so.\nIt is one thing to say ant can do what make can do (after all, you can always write \nmore Java code, right?).  It is another to actually do it.  \n\n\n\n",
