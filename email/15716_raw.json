Both Eclipse and Ant, for example,\n&gt;&gt; already have built in the feature to gather and run all the tests in a\n&gt;&gt; package/directory.\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. We don&#39;t use Ant to run tests\n&gt; 2. reasons we don&#39;t use Eclipse&#39;s built-in functionality:\n&gt;   a. Eclipse seemed to skip some tests in the 3.0.x branch (we would \n&gt; select 1 project whose tests would number N, its dependent projects \n&gt; would weigh in at M tests.  So you would expect N + M tests to have been \n&gt; run.  Not so.  It was N + M - X tests.  I don&#39;t know where things were \n&gt; getting lost.  I noticed this because I had a test in which I was \n&gt; forcing a failure and it never failed.  Why?  It never ran.)\n&gt;   b. using JUnit-Addons we actually are able to be more selective in the \n&gt; types of tests we run through Eclipse Launchers.  We have launchers for \n&gt; Units only, Units and Database Tests, Functional Tests, and All Tests.  \n&gt; The suite is built on the fly via tests implementing specific interfaces.\n&gt; \n\n\n",
