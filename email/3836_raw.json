IMHO,\n&gt; that&#39;s the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;most important reason to use asserts.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Are you saying you prefer to use the assert or the\n&gt; IllegalArgumentException\n&gt; &gt; in this case ?\n&gt; &gt; In the example I would prefer the Exception, to enforce my\n&gt; preconditions.\n&gt; &gt; Asserts allow the method to be executed with a negative parameter,\n&gt; maybe\n&gt; &gt; resulting in some fictitious value being returned without\n&gt; detection.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I see more relevance in asserting assumptions being made about the\n&gt; internal\n&gt; &gt; state of an object, (but then you are probably not writing unit\n&gt; tests, if\n&gt; &gt; you need to do that...).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Using JUnit, I do not yet see the usefulness/necessity of the assert\n&gt; &gt; statement. Maybe I&#39;m just missing something ?\n&gt;\n&gt; No I do not think you are missing anything.  This is what prompted me\n&gt; to ask this question in the first place.  When would one use an\n&gt; exception vs an &#39;assert&#39;.\n&gt;\n&gt; if (n&lt;0)\n&gt;  throw new IllegalArgumentException();\n&gt;\n&gt; and\n&gt;\n&gt; assert n &lt; 0\n&gt;\n&gt; are to me the same thing.  The differences are the following:\n&gt;\n&gt; the assert:\n&gt; - is more elegant\n&gt; - is more useful at development time (as an AssertionError is\n&gt; generated versus an exception)\n&gt; - is more severe then the exception (since its an error)\n&gt; - can not be ignored (exception can be ignored via emtpy try catch\n&gt; block)\n&gt; - may lead to clear code (I cant prove this yet.. just a hunch)\n&gt;\n&gt; the exception:\n&gt; - is more standard\n&gt; - is more explicit (IllegalArgument tells me the exact problem)\n&gt; - better communicated in docs (javadoc picks it up, hopefully this\n&gt; will change for assertions one day)\n&gt;\n&gt; But at the end of the day they the look the same to me - just\n&gt; different in implementation.\n&gt;\n&gt; Jonathan\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
