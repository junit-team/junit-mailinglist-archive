I don&#39;t \n&gt; know what my nick name was. But my first topic was a discussion \n&gt; about the value of JUnit compared to Design by Contract.\n&gt; \n&gt; It was very controversial. At times I asked myself, if I was right \n&gt; when many gurus here were arguing against my opinion. I will not \n&gt; repeat the discussion.\n&gt; \n&gt; But I have seen that the DBC inventor himself seems to support my \n&gt; opinion recently: http://www.artima.com/intv/contestP.html\n&gt; \n&gt; I have only read the summary until now. Maybe you are interested in \n&gt; what he has to say in favor of Contract-Driven Development. I like \n&gt; the idea of Design by Contract. And I think that it could make \n&gt; traditional JUnit tests obsolete, since the test cases could \n&gt; automatically be generated from the Contracts. I think this is what \n&gt; Parasoft JTest already does.\n&gt; \n&gt; Don&#39;t misunderstand me. I like JUnit. But I always look for better \n&gt; ways to solve my problems. So I hope you are as open as me to new \n&gt; solutions and ideas.\n\nI will say only this: if by any reason you find that DBC suits your\npreferences/needs better than unit testing use it.  But in trying to\nconvince a TDD person of it I believe you would be wasting your time.  I\ndon&#39;t think, for instance, that DBC would have solved the recent issues\nwith the Mars rovers.\n\n-- \nJason Rogers\n\n&quot;Where there is no vision, the people perish...&quot;\nBible, Proverbs 29:18\n\n\n",
