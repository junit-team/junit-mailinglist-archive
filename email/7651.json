Personally speaking, it clutters the class definition, making it more<br/>\ntime consuming to navigate the file (yes, IDEs can help with this,<br/>\nbut...)<br/>\n3. Automated suite generation is more difficult<br/>\n4. Inner classes are member variables of the object; they usually do<br/>\nsomething for the object&#39;s functionality that the object doesn&#39;t want to<br/>\ndo itself --&gt; Are your tests really extensions/helpers to your object&#39;s<br/>\nfunctionality?<br/>\n5. Why not just put it in its own file?  It&#39;s just as easy and not at<br/>\nall hard to keep in sync.<br/>\n<br/>\n=jason<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Wed, 2003-04-09 at 10:33, Sandy McArthur wrote: Searching the message<br/>\narchive there seems to be three common places to<br/>\nput your tests.<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Next to the class you are testing but in the same directory.<br/>\n2) Next to the class you are testing but in a different directory.<br/>\n3) In a public static inner class.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom my current point of view the third option looks the most<br/>\nappealing to me but most people seem to recomend the second.<br/>\n<br/>\nCan anyone give some good reasons to advoid the third choice?
