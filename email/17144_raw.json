It contains 100 unit tests written for =\r\nDao&#39;s (all in memory right now), Components that perform simple validation =\r\nand Business Objects that do NOT follow the transfer object (anti) pattern.=\r\n (When I got to around 95 tests naturally, I went around looking for 5 more=\r\n to add).\n \nYou can just download the file and have a look at the &quot;test&quot; di=\r\nrectory under the CarRental project. Alternatively, you can follow all of t=\r\nhe instructions and get them to run.\n \nThis example has several things embe=\r\ndded in it, including:\n- A simple use of Spring\n- An aspect that outputs th=\r\ne time each unit test takes to run (mentioned earlier on this list)\n- Yet a=\r\nnother simple wrapper around Log4J that actually adds value by using variab=\r\nle arguments\n- Several examples of the use of Generics (both types and meth=\r\nods)\n- What something looks like after using both PMD and Checkstyle\n- JUni=\r\nt, of course (not TestNG - just to presempt C=C3=A9dric&#39;s question about wh=\r\nether I&#39;ve looked at TestNG (I have))\n \nI plan to extend this example over =\r\nthe next several months (as time permits). On my TO DO list (not necessaril=\r\ny in priority order):\n- Introduce Hibernate (replace all of the in-memory D=\r\nao&#39;s with hibernate)\n- Rewrite (by hand) every test using TestNG (for exper=\r\nience - I don&#39;t want to just convert them so I can learn TestNG from the gr=\r\nound up - and I figure after writing that many tests I&#39;ll have enough exper=\r\nience to intelligently speak about both JUnit and TestNG)\n- I&#39;ll add some k=\r\nind of front end, have not yet decided.\n- Plan out more possible Aspect ass=\r\nignments to be applied to this example (that&#39;s the original impetus for thi=\r\ns work - part 2 of a 3-part class on AOP and AspectJ)\n \nComments welcome.\n =\r\n\nOh, if you do follow all of the instructions and you install everything un=\r\nder the same directory, it will take up roughly 312 MB (+ some for the bloc=\r\nk size used by your hard drive).\n \nFYI, the last time I checked, the ratio =\r\nof the &quot;source&quot; code to the &quot;test&quot; code was 3:2. That is, around 1500 non-c=\r\nomment source statements for the src directory and about 1000 non-comment s=\r\nource statements for the test directory. Are your results similar?\n \nBrett\n=\r\n \nTutorials and Articles\n     http://schuchert.wikispaces.com/\n\n\n\n----- Ori=\r\nginal Message ----\nFrom: clgonsal &lt;clgonsal@...&gt;\nTo: junit@=\r\nyahoogroups.com\nSent: Monday, July 17, 2006 6:08:15 PM\nSubject: [junit] set=\r\nUp versus constructors\n\n\nI&#39;ve been using JUnit for a few years now, and one=\r\n thing that&#39;s always\nbothered me is the &quot;setUp&quot; method.\n\nI always do my ini=\r\ntialization in my constructor (if I&#39;m not just doing\nit at the field defini=\r\ntion) as constructors allow me to initialize\nfinal fields. The semantics of=\r\n using a constructor also seem far more\nobvious to me as everyone reading m=\r\ny code knows Java, while not\neveryone is a JUnit guru.\n\nThe additional comp=\r\nlexity of having the (as far as I can tell)\nredundant setUp method seems co=\r\nunterproductive, so why does setUp exist?\n\n\n \n\n[Non-text portions of this m=\r\nessage have been removed]\n\n\n\n\n",
