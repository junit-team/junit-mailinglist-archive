Apologies in advance if not.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am developing a Java application which needs to automate user GUI <br/>\ninteraction with an existing<br/>\nJava-based GUI app.  THe app runs continuously and its GUI appearance <br/>\nis not predictable (different GUIs<br/>\nmay appear during different runs of the app).  That said, the GUIs <br/>\nare fairly simple with most having an<br/>\n&quot;OK&quot; or &quot;Cancel&quot; button.  My quesiton is:<br/>\n<br/>\n1)WOuld using Java GUI Testing tools be a viable option for this <br/>\ntask?  I don&#39;t know enough about them<br/>\nto judge right off.  My final applicaiton would need to run as a <br/>\nstandalone app but also with the capability of an external user<br/>\nto start and stop the app.  I looked into using the Java Robot class <br/>\nbut it seems like it would lock the mouse/keyboard in the case<br/>\nof an app like mine which will run continuously.<br/>\n<br/>\n2)If the answer to the quesiton above is yes..which Java GUI tool <br/>\nwould be most suitable for this task?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance.<br/>\n<br/>\n-D</div>",
