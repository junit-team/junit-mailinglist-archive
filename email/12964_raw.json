We are \n&gt; facing a dilemma that I hope you can help us with. How are dependent \n&gt; unit tests handled?\n\n...by using another framework or by removing the dependency.\n\n&gt; For example, there are 2 independent methods that must be tested, but to \n&gt; test them and clean-up they become dependent. So, the methods are \n&gt; addRecordToDB() and deleteRecordFromDB(). Additionally, addRecordToDB() \n&gt; will fail if the record already exists in the database.\n&gt; \n&gt; To test that addRecordToDB() can add a new record, testAddRecordToDB() \n&gt; must ensure that the record does not already exist, which relies on a \n&gt; deleteRecordFormDB() message in setUp().\n&gt; \n&gt; To test that deleteRecordFromDB() can delete an existing record, \n&gt; testDeleteRecordFromDB() must ensure that the record already exists in \n&gt; the database, which relies on an addRecordToDB() in setUp().\n&gt; \n&gt; To test that addRecordToDB() fails if the record already exists, \n&gt; testAddRecordToDBDuplication() must ensure that either\n&gt; \n&gt; - the record does not already exist, which relies on \n&gt; deleteRecordFromDB() in setUp() and 2 addRecordToDB() messages in the \n&gt; test method OR\n&gt; \n&gt; - the record already exists, which relies on 1 addRecordToDB() message \n&gt; in setup() and 1 addRecordToDB() message in the test Method\n&gt; \n&gt; These same issues also affect the tearDown() method.\n&gt; \n&gt; Generically stated, should a test method&#39;s setUp() and tearDown() rely \n&gt; on an untested method? If not, how can we avoid it? Is there a way to \n&gt; enforce the sequence of test method runs?\n&gt; \n&gt; Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks.\n\nShort answer: Don&#39;t test the platform. JDBC works, so you don&#39;t need to \ntest it.\n\nMedium answer: Make each test start from empty tables, then you&#39;ll find \nout why that&#39;s a good solution (it works) and a bad solution (it&#39;s slow).\n\nLonger answer: JUnit Recipes, chapter 10.\n-- \nJ.
