Perhaps<br/>\n&gt;   every heretofore uncharted business domain may provide<br/>\n&gt;   artistic freedom for a software developer, but pretty soon,<br/>\n&gt;   it becomes yet another &quot;patternizable&quot;, &quot;automated testable&quot;<br/>\n&gt;   piece of software.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The software becomes those things, but not the work it takes to get to <br/>\nthat point. No process definition can make that work happen the way it <br/>\nneeds to happen. People have to think. CMM appears to be about <br/>\nMcDonaldizing work. You cannot McDonaldize building software, although <br/>\nyou can (and should!) McDonaldize other kinds of work.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  &gt;  From what I understand the goal of CMM is to define a<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; process that even<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; a monkey could follow. Monkeys do not write software; people do.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   perhaps the monkey refers to &quot;code monkeys&quot;...<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>At a minimum, but it is not limited to coding.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   Again, my point is that a large part of software being built today<br/>\n&gt;   is grunt-work, which can and should be codified in a process.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>A large of part of building software today is gruntwork because we&#39;re <br/>\nnot pushing the reusable libraries that could remove the gruntwork.<br/>\n<br/>\nI cannot believe how much work I had to do to build a HardcodedResultSet <br/>\nin Java for my tests. It amazes me that NO ONE ON THE PLANET has made <br/>\nthis available on the web and publicized it. That floors me. That&#39;s why <br/>\nI&#39;m going to do it. That&#39;s why I use Jakarta Commons. I don&#39;t want to <br/>\nbuild what I can buy -- or even get free!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe gruntwork happens when people don&#39;t choose to reuse.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  &gt; It drives towards more uniform results, certainly; but I don&#39;t know<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; about &quot;better software&quot;.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;   At the end, if you&#39;re saying the concept of the CMM is BS, I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; agree. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Since that is not what I said, don&#39;t worry.<br/>\n<br/>\nI said that a software company claiming it was CMM Level 5 is BS. I just <br/>\ndon&#39;t believe a software company could be CMM Level 5 and stay in <br/>\nbusiness. Other industries, yes; software, no.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt; The very fact that we&#39;re using JUnit and other tools to<br/>\n&gt; complement our laziness (laziness being a compliment, of course, in<br/>\n&gt; software development) is evidence that we are trying to get from<br/>\n&gt; Initial to Repeatable (this word is JUnit all the way) to Defined<br/>\n&gt; to Managed to Optimized (refactor mercilessly).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>True, but it&#39;s the PRACTICES that are moving to CMM Level 5, and not the <br/>\nactual work of writing the software. We can&#39;t turn the brains off.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; if you&#39;re saying the process (documentation, documentation and more<br/>\n&gt; documentation) is flawed, I&#39;m with you.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s true, too; although tangential to my point.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Finally, I just took a look at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sei.cmu.edu\">http://www.sei.cmu.edu</a> and found out<br/>\n&gt; that they&#39;re sunsetting the CMM and moving to CMMI, so maybe they<br/>\n&gt; did find out that most people out here cared two hoots about the<br/>\n&gt; process...<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>&lt;shrug /&gt;<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ.
