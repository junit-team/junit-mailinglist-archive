They have to manually select to use the new version that has just appeared in the repo, and this way if their tests start failing, they will know that they can either fix them to work with the new version of junit, or revert to the previous version.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Interesting.  I was under the impression that it was possible to<br/>\nsimply depend on the _latest_ version of a package--indeed, that the<br/>\nability to get upgraded versions automatically was one of the<br/>\nbenefits/risks of maven.
