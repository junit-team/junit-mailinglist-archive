It seems to me that you can\n&gt;&gt; do this kind of validation in a @BeforeClass in JUnit 4.\n&gt;&gt; Would that solve your problem?\n\n--- Jason Rogers &lt;jacaetevha@f...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Not so easily in this case.  This is a validation that is\n&gt; run before any other test in the AllTests suite, if it fails\n&gt; no other test is run.  You get a single failure, fix the\n&gt; web.xml file and then run again.  In order to get this same\n&gt; behavior in JUnit4 I would have to duplicate the @BeforeClass\n&gt; and @AfterClass annotations into every TestCase.  Annotations\n&gt; in this sense are really starting to sound like Advices in\n&gt; the AOP world.\n&gt; \n&gt; Similarly, we have functional tests that use a type of\n&gt; validation like the one I mentioned before [...].  The\n&gt; validation checks the WSDL [...].  If they don&#39;t match\n&gt; [...then...] running the tests don&#39;t make too much sense,\n&gt; so we throw a failure and refuse to run any other tests.  [...]\n\nGood points.\n\nSomething I&#39;ve done to switch banks of tests on and off is to have \nthem all inherit from a new class that is a child of TestCase, and \nthen I can override &#39;run(...)&#39;, &#39;runBare()&#39; or &#39;runTest()&#39; to check \na flag and then runs the test (by calling the super class TestCase \nimplementation) or skips is.  In this case, I might put the test in \nthe &#39;setUp&#39; method of the new base class  (if I&#39;m confident that all \nchild class setUp methods call their superclass setUp method!  ;-)  \nand set a static flag to indicate if the &quot;before all tests&quot; check \nwas done, and another flag to indicate if it was successful or not.  \n(If it was run, but it was not successful, then I don&#39;t want to run \nthe tests.)\n\nI&#39;ve used this primarily to support configuration flags like &quot;run \nthe tests that connect to the database&quot; (or not) and &quot;run the really \ntime-consuming tests&quot; (or not).  When doing this, I typically also \noverride the constructor and &#39;setName&#39; method, to call a static \nfunction that modifies the test case name to show that it&#39;s not \nbeing run.  I&#39;ll change &quot;testThis&quot; to &quot;- NOT RUN -  testThis&quot;, for \nexample, for test cases I will chose not to run.  This trick may not \nbe as useful in your case; I&#39;m doing selective disabling of just \nsome of the tests.\n\n\n\n",
