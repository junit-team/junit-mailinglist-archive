You don&#39;t want to add new feature unless=\r\n it will be useful\nto everybody. You don&#39;t want to overload the core.\n  \n&gt; =\r\nThe next steps I would suggest for you are:\n&gt;     1) Do something to accele=\r\nrate the 4.5 release, like fill in missing\n&gt; javadoc.\n&gt;     2) Add automate=\r\nd tests to your feature requests.\n\nHow can I add automated tests or add jav=\r\nadoc if I don&#39;t have write\nrights to CVS? It will be pleasure for me to hel=\r\np you. I just want to\nknow how can I technically do it.\n\n  \n&gt; Beginning to =\r\ncontribute to an existing project is a little like going to\n&gt; someone else&#39;=\r\ns home. If you are demanding, if you rearrange all the\n&gt; furniture, if, in =\r\nshort, you act like you are the most important\nperson in\n&gt; the room, then y=\r\nou are unlikely to be welcome. If you listen\ncarefully and\n&gt; offer to help,=\r\n you have a chance of building a relationship that\nwill help\n&gt; you feel at =\r\nhome and prepare the way for a closer relationship.\n\nI understand your poin=\r\nt. You see, I don&#39;t want to change your design,\nrewrite your code or to add=\r\n significant amount of new features. I want\nonly to add enhancements / impr=\r\novements to existing one. In other\nwords, I don&#39;t want to rearrange the fur=\r\nniture I want to add some\ndecorative elements to your room. \n\n\n\n",
