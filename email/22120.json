It may often be more practical to tag tests for exclusion, based on execution time or external resource constraints than to tag fast tests.<br/>\n<br/>\nI found it easier to use assumptions to exclude such tests, because I can state the assumption in a setup class that sets up the intensive resource and have the unit test automatically excluded just for writing it, but I can definitely see categories being a good exclusion mechanism.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Pigneri, Rocco&quot; &lt;rpigneri@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; But group exclusion has other uses, such as &quot;running all the tests except<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the slow ones&quot;, &quot;excluding the ui tests&quot;, &quot;excluding the Linux tests&quot;,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; etc...<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &lt;snip&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Got it. So we seem in agreement that excluded categories may be<br/>\n&gt; &gt;useful, but a &quot;broken&quot; category is not the best argument for them.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I also agree.  I almost exclusively use categories to exclude certain types of tests, such as database tests, slow tests, integration tests, etc. from my main test run.  In fact, for me, putting tests into a category is an exception rather than a rule: in other words, I only mark tests that I would *not* want to execute on each run of the test suite.  All other tests get run on every run, each time.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hope that helps,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Rocco<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>] On Behalf Of David Saff<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Sunday, November 22, 2009 10:53 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [junit] Re: Categories in JUnit 4.8<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 2009/11/22 CÃ©dric Beust â&quot; &lt;cbeust@...&lt;mailto:cbeust%40google.com&gt;&gt;:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; On Sun, Nov 22, 2009 at 7:36 PM, David Saff &lt;david@...&lt;mailto:david%40saff.net&gt;&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; The problem with @Ignore is that 1) you need to specify it on all the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; methods you want to exclude and 2) it forces a recompilation.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Being able to specify &quot;-ignore broken&quot; at runtime allows you to exclude<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; dozens of methods in one single command.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; This story makes sense to me if you have many tests in the broken<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; group, and sometimes want to run all of them, and sometimes want to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; run none of them. Is that your frequent experience? If so, I agree<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; that excludable categories would be the way to do it.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; No, I never really run all the methods in the excluded groups, most of the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; time, their purpose is just to be excluded.  When I want to start fixing the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; broken tests, I look at all the tests in that group and I take them out of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it one by one as I fix them.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; But group exclusion has other uses, such as &quot;running all the tests except<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the slow ones&quot;, &quot;excluding the ui tests&quot;, &quot;excluding the Linux tests&quot;,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; etc...<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Admittedly, this is more on the integration/functional than on the unit test<br/>\n&gt; &gt; side, so you might consider these out of scope for JUnit.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Got it.
