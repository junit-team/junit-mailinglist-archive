A test doesn&#39;t depend upon the<br/>\nside effects of a run of another, but (at some user determined level) the<br/>\nrun of one test ought depend upon the completion of and success of another.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;\tWhen I wrote a few examples, I found that when one test depends on another<br/>\n </span></blockquote>(in your sense) there is<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;\tduplication in the tests. At a minimum, the two tests make the same<br/>\n </span></blockquote>assertions.<br/>\n<br/>\nOk, another example. I have a class that walks a classpath and generates<br/>\nlistener events on things found, I test that. I have a class that listens to<br/>\nsuch events to &quot;find&quot; things that match a certain criterion, I test that. If<br/>\nthe first class fails to send events, then I ought not blame (or dig into)<br/>\nthe second for not finding anything. The tests are (I believe) unit tests of<br/>\neach, without duplication.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;\tThe closer an object is to the core of your application, the more<br/>\n </span></blockquote>important (I think) that failures in that &gt;\tobject yell loudly and<br/>\nannoyingly.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf one is goign to test, then any single test failing is loud enough. Why<br/>\nget 50 random reports when one focused one would do?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;\tIf your project has a big problem with core classes failing on a regular<br/>\n&gt;\tbasis, then maybe you have a process/people problem, as opposed to a<br/>\n </span></blockquote>technical problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo junit is for folks who don&#39;t really need good testing? ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nregards<br/>\n<br/>\nAdam</div>",
