After all, those method calls are made\nfrom the same level of the call stack. This should be easy to verify\nby adding a &quot;Thread.sleep(5000)&quot; to a tearDown() method and seeing\nwhether it affects the reported execution time. Or then you  could\njust read the source, of course.\n\n\nOn 7/10/07, Dennis &lt;dennisk@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;  If the tearDown time cannot be eliminated or if our use of the Time\n&gt;  values is completely off-base, then I would ask if going to JUnit4\n&gt;  would be better insofar as we could make use of the\n&gt;  @Before/@BeforeClass/@After/AfterClass constructs, hoping that they\n&gt;  would eliminate the set up and tear down times?\n\nNo, @Before and @After won&#39;t eliminate the setup and teardown\ntimes--they&#39;re just a new syntax for achieving the same behavior as\nJUnit 3.x achieved with setUp() and tearDown().\n\n\nLasse\n\n-- \nLasse Koskela\n* Author of &quot;Test Driven&quot; (Manning Publications, 2007) *\n* Reaktor Innovations * http://www.ri.fi/en *\n\n",
