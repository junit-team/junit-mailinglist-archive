Static typing is the illusion of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; safety, I choose the former.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Code that uses both will always be safer than code that only uses one of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; these.<br/>\n&gt; That is a very striking statement. Are you saying that (in your opinion) <br/>\n&gt; static languages are inherently safer than dynamic languages?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Here is my experience (although this could probably be derided as &quot;opinion&quot;,<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t it?):<br/>\n<br/>\n* I have written a complete OR mapping (which is in productive use in about<br/>\n6 projects of a large retail company) in Java. Java&#39;s (JDK1.2) collections<br/>\nhave dynamic typing for their contents. Using quite explicit naming<br/>\nconventions so that parameters, instance variables and local variables spell<br/>\ntheir type quite directly (childAssocNodes for a collection of<br/>\nAbstractAssociationNodes), no single letter names even for local vars etc.,<br/>\nI felt quite comfortable with this. A similar experience from a<br/>\nsmaller-sized Smalltalk project (about people, about 1 year) about 10 years<br/>\nago was the same.<br/>\n<br/>\n* Still, when I converted a few larger tools to JDK1.5 (up to now, alas, not<br/>\nthe large ORMapping) it felt like &quot;finally being there&quot;.<br/>\nI have also written a library for bidirectional associations in C#, using<br/>\nC#&#39;s generics. The &quot;good feeling&quot; (ok - it&#39;s opinion after all ...) that you<br/>\ndo not even need to run the (in that case, extensive and written TDD-style)<br/>\nunit tests, because you can be sure that &quot;if it compiles, it is correct&quot;, is<br/>\nsomething that helps (me) very much when writing intricate algorithms.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, these experiences may be because I am a &quot;static thinker&quot;: The<br/>\nmathematical concepts of static invariants and other static constraints are<br/>\na main technique for me when designing algorithms. As far as I know, there<br/>\nare many more &quot;execution type people&quot; around who need something that &quot;runs&quot;<br/>\nto be &quot;emotionally happy&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe this explains that (to me sometimes &quot;religious&quot;) discussion on static<br/>\nvs. dynamic typing - might it be the old difference between the &quot;let&#39;s<br/>\ncompute it!&quot;-type engineer and the &quot;let&#39;s build/try it!&quot;-type engineer? -<br/>\nwhere both have their well-founded arsenal of tools to support their<br/>\ntechniques - e.g. redundant over-the-thumb-checks against reality in the<br/>\ncase of the &quot;static computation&quot; guy, scaffolding/mocks/test runs in the<br/>\ncase of the &quot;executing&quot; guy - and are quite happy with it?<br/>\n<br/>\n... but probably that&#39;s now too much &quot;laymean&#39;s philosophy&quot; or something<br/>\nlike that ...<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards<br/>\nHarald M.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n10 GB Mailbox, 100 FreeSMS/Monat <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.gmx.net/de/go/topmail\">http://www.gmx.net/de/go/topmail</a><br/>\n+++ GMX - die erste Adresse f�r Mail, Message, More +++</div>",
