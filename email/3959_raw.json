This would relieve you from any reliance on \nstatic/=\r\nglobals.  I found this to be necessary for my own functional \ntesting.  Tak=\r\ne a look at this page and see if it gives you the kind of \nflexibility you =\r\nneed in your testing.  (Note: I&#39;ve never relied much on \nthe setUp and tear=\r\nDown methods so I can&#39;t say if they&#39;ll behave as \nexpected.)\n\nhttp://gnufoo=\r\n.org/junit/\n\nMany times over JUnit seems to be employed for \nfunctional/acc=\r\neptance/integration testing (usually somewhat awkwardly).  \nAre there any t=\r\nesting approaches or frameworks that can be suggested for \nthis sort of tes=\r\nting?  Because many of the methodologies suggested for \nunit testing aren&#39;t=\r\n applicable to this sort of testing.  Have the xUnit \npeople, or anyone els=\r\ne for that matter, addressed this problem space?\n\n-shane\n\n&gt;&gt; You could have=\r\n class-level attributes on the TestCase class and let the\n&gt;&gt; setUp() and te=\r\narDown() methods of the TestSetup assign values to those\n&gt;&gt; class-level att=\r\nributes. For example, suppose you want to establish a\n&gt;&gt; single database co=\r\nnnection and use it for all tests. You have two\n&gt;&gt; choices:\n&gt;\n&gt; Well, yeah.=\r\n.. But!  Forgive me, but that=B9s an extremely smelly solution.\n&gt; I find it=\r\n hard to believe the otherwise-brilliant creators of JUnit \n&gt; would\n&gt; give =\r\nus a design that forces the use of global variables!\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; public class MyDa=\r\ntabaseTestCase extends TestCase {\n&gt;&gt;   private static Connection connection=\r\n;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;   public static Test suite() {\n&gt;&gt;       return new TestSetup(new Te=\r\nstSuite(MyDatabaseTestCase.class)) {\n&gt;&gt;           protected void setUp() th=\r\nrows Exception {\n&gt;&gt;               connection =3D DriverManager.getConnectio=\r\nn(...);\n&gt;&gt;           }\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;           protected void tearDown() throws Exc=\r\neption {\n&gt;&gt;               connection.close();\n&gt;&gt;               connection =\r\n=3D null;\n&gt;&gt;           }\n&gt;&gt;       };\n&gt;&gt;   }\n&gt;&gt; }\n&gt;\n&gt; Ahh... You&#39;re using an=\r\n inner class for the TestSetup.  This is close,\n&gt; but it still makes me ver=\r\ny uncomfortable.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; or, perhaps...\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; // Danger -- connection not clos=\r\ned! Shutdown hook, perhaps?\n&gt;&gt; public class MyDatabaseTestCase extends Test=\r\nCase {\n&gt;&gt;   private static Connection connection;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;   protected void se=\r\ntUp() throws Exception {\n&gt;&gt;       if (connection =3D=3D null) {\n&gt;&gt;         =\r\n  connection =3D DriverManager.getConnection(...);\n&gt;&gt;       }\n&gt;&gt;   }\n&gt;&gt; }\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; As you note, this doesn&#39;t properly tearDown after the tests are run,\n&gt; w=\r\nhich\n&gt; is where TestSetup.tearDown would come into play.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Does that hel=\r\np?\n&gt;\n&gt; Well, it&#39;s a workable solution, but there&#39;s *got* to be a clean way =\r\nthat\n&gt; doesn&#39;t involve static variables.
