This would make end-to-end tests\n&gt;  all the less valuable.\n\nI&#39;ve found the opposite.  Many times I&#39;ve seen teams do &quot;TDD&quot; but only\nwrite unit tests.  They had integration problems that were only\nbrought under control when they started writing end-to-end tests.\n\nThe most alarming I&#39;ve seen was a team that used FIT to drive their\nbusiness objects, not drive the app end-to-end.  The business signed\noff functionality based on the FIT tests but I found that the main\nmethod contained nothing but one comment: &quot;TODO write this&quot;!  Of\ncourse, that&#39;s a process breakdown not a technical problem, but an\nentertaining scare-story nonetheless in a Daily WTF kind of way.\n\n--Nat\n\n",
