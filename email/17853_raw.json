Write your plug-in tests in a second plug-in project to the \none under test, export the packages from the first to make them visible \nand run the tests as JUnit plug-in tests to let PDE launch an Eclipse \nruntime for you in which the tests will be run. Warning, this is slow!\n\nChapter 12 of Erich Gamma and Kent Beck&#39;s &quot;Contributing to Eclipse: \nPrinciples, Patterns and Plug-ins&quot; gives good advice that may be useful.\nThat chapter is available as a pdf download: \nhttp://today.java.net/today/2004/02/02/ch12Eclipse.pdf#search=%22test%20driven%20plugin%20development%20pdf%22\n\nIt is also worth getting hold of a copy of the book because, even if the \ncode examples are a little out of date (written for Eclipse 2.1.1), the \npatterns and principles still apply.\n\nThe second edition of &quot;Eclipse Building Commercial-Quality Plug-ins&quot; by \nEric Clayberg and Dan Rubel is also helpful (and covers Eclipse \n3.1/3.2). The authors develop a plug-in over the course of the book and \nwhile they don&#39;t practice TDD, they do show how they develop unit-tests \nfor some of the functionality.\n\nAlso, look at David Saff and Michael Ernst&#39;s paper &quot;Mock Object Creation \nfor Test Factoring&quot; in which they raise the idea of mocking the Eclipse \nplatform in order to remove the time it takes to launch the Eclipse \nruntime when testing plug-ins.\nhttp://pag.csail.mit.edu/pubs/mock-factoring-paste2004-abstract.html\n\nUnit-testing plug-ins is hard work. As mentioned launching the tests in \na runtime workspace via PDE adds a significant overhead to execution \ntime which makes it frustratingly slow. Moreover, setting up the test \nfixture takes a lot of time and demands a deeper knowledge of how \nEclipse manages its components than you would expect to need at first, \nfar more than you need to develop simple plug-ins without tests. (Note, \nthis in no doubt true of writing unit-tests while working with any \nplatform: I&#39;m very much a beginner in this field and have nothing with \nwhich to compare the experience.)\n\nHope this helps\n\nTim\n\n\nisaachanstar wrote:\n&gt; hi, all\n&gt; \n&gt; Could anyone make some suggestions of how to unit test Eclipse Plugin,\n&gt; especially RCP application? There are any strategies, tips, or tools\n&gt; in your brains and toolboxes?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks!\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo!
