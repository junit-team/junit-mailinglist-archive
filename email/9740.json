The test methods are bound to the<br/>\n&gt; setup methods ie. they expected the setup to have generated some values<br/>\n&gt; which the test methods use for asserts.<br/>\n&gt; Now I want to change one particular setup method to set up the values<br/>\n&gt; differently so that I can test a different functionality, here I am<br/>\n&gt; trying to check if a proper exception is raised. The approach I trie was<br/>\n&gt; I made a sub-class of the BaseTest say ExtendedTest and here I overrided<br/>\n&gt; one of the setup functions and wrote a single test method which will<br/>\n&gt; assert for exception based on the new setup that was done in the<br/>\n&gt; ExtendtedTest.<br/>\n&gt; But when I tried to run the test I found that Junit execute all the<br/>\n&gt; tests that belonmg to the superClass testCase too and here it uses the<br/>\n&gt; overrdden setup methods and thus in my case all my super class tests<br/>\n&gt; fail.<br/>\n&gt; Is this the expected behavior ? Am I trying the right thing for my<br/>\n&gt; problem, is there a cleaner way for my kind of a requirement ?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, this is the expected behavior. If all Bs are As, then you probably <br/>\nwant Bs to behave like As; therefore, you create BTest extends ATest, <br/>\nand when you execute BTest, you test whether Bs behave like As by <br/>\ninheriting the tests from ATest. Makes sense, I think.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have two test case classes that want to share a test fixture <br/>\n(setup), then extract the setup into an abstract subclass of TestCase <br/>\n(called, say, TestFixture) and have the two test case classes extend <br/>\nTestFixture rather than TestCase.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso remember: if your TestCase adds /more/ test fixture, be sure to <br/>\ninvoke super.setUp()!<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ.
