Easier to automate most of the steps (run x n, merge,<br/>\nreport).<br/>\n<br/>\nLast time I got 0% coverage was because I accidentally had a * exclusion<br/>\nfilter.  Check your filters in the Coverage launchpad.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother benefit to Ant&#39;s jpcoverage is that the exclusion/inclusion<br/>\nmechanism is a little more &quot;in your face.&quot;  And if you use jpcovreport,<br/>\nyou get a much nicer looking report than the JProbe HTML report.<br/>\n<br/>\nScott Stirling<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: majortaylor [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:majortaylor@...\">majortaylor@...</a>] <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hi,<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m trying to get some code coverage for my junit tests. I&#39;m using <br/>\n&gt; JProbe Coverage from Sitraka software to get the code coverage <br/>\n&gt; information.<br/>\n&gt; JPCoverage calls ant which in turn runs my unit tests. I&#39;ve been <br/>\n&gt; careful to set &quot;fork=&quot;no&quot; in my junit ant task so that my tests run <br/>\n&gt; in the same jvm as ant.<br/>\n&gt; Despite this, and despite the fact that it&#39;s clear my tests are <br/>\n&gt; executing, jpcoverage is still reporting 0% coverage of my <br/>\n&gt; code. Does anybody have any experience with this? I&#39;m <br/>\n&gt; wondering what I <br/>\n&gt; could be doing wrong.<br/>\n&gt; I realize that there&#39;s also a jpcoverage ant task which would then <br/>\n&gt; run JProbe inside my ant project (rather than vice versa); would this <br/>\n&gt; be a superior approach? I suspect I would have the same problem.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks,<br/>\n&gt; MT </span></blockquote></div>",
