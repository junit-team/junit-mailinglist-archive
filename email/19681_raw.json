If you have 100 XML documents, you&#39;re almost certainly doing\n&gt;  &gt; something wrong. The most obvious question I&#39;d ask is &quot;How big is the\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes, I think in same way, but I still ordered to move more code to XML\n&gt; to make it more configurable. Yes, ordered.\n\nOK. It didn&#39;t take long to get to the organizational dysfunction in play.\n\n&gt;  &gt; application?&quot; It might be too big and needs to be modularized. Another\n&gt;  &gt; question I&#39;d ask is &quot;What do your layers look like?&quot; It might be poorly\n&gt;  &gt; layered.\n&gt; \n&gt; Very likely there are room of improvement. However, I think, if the\n&gt; management put configurable as the highest priority, moving most class\n&gt; member to XML configuration (spring in our case) . No matter how well\n&gt; the modularized / layering, there still a lot of config file and make\n&gt; thing more complicate than it should be.\n\nNot necessarily: the more modularized the system, the less complex the \nconfiguration would be. I&#39;m willing to bit there&#39;s at least one piece of \nconfiguration information you have to specify in XML that either never \nchanges or you&#39;d never want to change, but you have to put it there \nbecause something else in the same class needs to be configurable. \nThat&#39;s a sign of the layering problem I have in mind.\n\n&gt;  &gt; Also, why do we need to test our configuration files? I was under the\n&gt;  &gt; impression that the goal of externalizing configuration is to make it\n&gt;  &gt; /easy/ to change how the application behaves. If that&#39;s no longer easy,\n&gt;  &gt; we must stop externalizing configuration data and figure out what we&#39;re\n&gt;  &gt; doing wrong.\n&gt; \n&gt; Interesting it can be easier in some organization, once the\n&gt; application pressed UAT and if some thing required code change, we\n&gt; need to complete a number of process like &quot;permit to build&quot; , &quot;user\n&gt; approval&quot;, &quot;cost estimation&quot; ...... Moving code to config in fact\n&gt; provide &quot;hole&quot; to bypassed all those procedures to make quick change.\n&gt; And that is the reason why management prefer more config.\n\nAha! Another organizational dysfunction. They&#39;re everywhere! :)\n\n&gt; I can understand, what I think we can improve is there are some\n&gt; variable that is just not make sense to be configurable, like change\n&gt; the default will break the application, but we still ordered to make\n&gt; it configurable just because there are possible to change.....\n\nI would want to learn more about the two organizational problems you \ndescribed to me first. Why are you being ordered to do something that \nyou strongly believe is a bad idea? Why does your team have to create \nholes in the design to get around testing? What you describe is a \nclassic case of trying to solve people problems by changing code. It \ndoesn&#39;t work for long. :)\n\nI sympathize with your position. It&#39;s not easy.\n\n&gt; Actually it is off-topic a lot. in fact I just like to make the point\n&gt; that IoC framework is not magic and there are cases that using pattern\n&gt; like &quot;only create once&quot; is better to make it configurable. In fact, I\n&gt; think this case is a lot more than we expect.\n\nI don&#39;t know whether it&#39;s so off-topic: introducing JUnit into an \norganization tends to get people asking more interesting questions. I \nsee it over and over again.\n\nBack to your comment, of course it&#39;s the case: DI containers are no more \nmagic than any other code. It&#39;s also false, though, that DI containers \nforce you to have 100 XML configuration files. I just wanted to be sure \nboth sides were represented in the discussion.\n\nGood luck... I mean that.\n-- \nJ. B.
