As J.B Rainsberger stated, your\n&gt; Experiment tests do not\n&gt; care much about creating a project - they just want\n&gt; one.\n&gt; \n&gt; The same is true then for most of our Project tests\n&gt; as well.  You can\n&gt; one (or a few) test to make sure that writing to the\n&gt; DB works - but\n&gt; subsequent tests (that again care little about the\n&gt; creation of a\n&gt; Project but rather just want a Project) can use a\n&gt; Project that was not\n&gt; database driven.\n&gt; \n&gt; There are several advantages to following the above\n&gt; style including \n&gt; \n&gt; 1) Speed of test execution (non-database driven\n&gt; tests are usually\n&gt; faster than database tests),\n&gt; \n&gt; 2) Complexity of test setup (in its current state -\n&gt; each test that\n&gt; requires a Project also requires the database and\n&gt; managing that is\n&gt; more complex then simply using an in-memory\n&gt; Project),\n&gt; \n&gt; 3) Increased test de-coupling (if the database goes\n&gt; down, or is\n&gt; improperly configured, then all your Project tests\n&gt; will fail - instead\n&gt; of those that more concretely point to a database\n&gt; issue)\n&gt; \n&gt; To be fair, there are some disadvantages as well.\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) Fewer tests exercise a real Project (aka database\n&gt; driven) - but we\n&gt; are talking about unit tests so in most circles this\n&gt; is expected (you\n&gt; can still use a database driven Project for\n&gt; integration tests)\n&gt; \n&gt; 2) Code refactoring to support DB driven and non-db\n&gt; driven Projects. \n&gt; You could consider Mock-objects, abstracting the\n&gt; persistence layer (to\n&gt; now include an In-Memory as well as database\n&gt; implementation) as well\n&gt; as just re-thinking how objects interact with one\n&gt; another (is the\n&gt; foreign key constraint an Experiment issue, or a\n&gt; database one?)\n&gt; \n&gt; andrew f\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Fri, 03 Sep 2004 17:27:21 -0500, J. B.\n&gt; Rainsberger\n&gt; &lt;jbrains@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; sebashkw wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Say I have a Project class and Experiment class\n&gt; that I need to test using\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Junit. They are simple codes that writes into\n&gt; the database. The rule is a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Project must be added before a Experiment can be\n&gt; added. This is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; because Experiment has a foreign key that points\n&gt; to Project.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; OK. Project [1]--&gt;[*] Experiment.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; In my ProjectTest I have a testCreateProject\n&gt; test. But in my\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ExperimentTest where I have my\n&gt; testCreateExperiment test, I need to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; create a project before it will be successful.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Whats the practice for this? Do I put the\n&gt; createProject inside my\n&gt; &gt; &gt; testCreateExperiment method? Then I will be\n&gt; actually testing two different\n&gt; &gt; &gt; class (Project and Experiment) in a single\n&gt; method\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (testCreateExperiment)..\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t agree with this last statement.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In what state does your environment need to be to\n&gt; test creating an\n&gt; &gt; experiment? It appears that there must be a\n&gt; project in the database with\n&gt; &gt; a known project primary key first. In that case,\n&gt; put one there -- this\n&gt; &gt; is what setUp() is for. In TestExperiment.setUp(),\n&gt; then, invoke\n&gt; &gt; createProject().\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Rather than /testing/ createProject(), you are\n&gt; /using/ createProject()\n&gt; &gt; -- assuming that it works -- to test\n&gt; createExperiment(). I&#39;m not sure\n&gt; &gt; that that&#39;s wise, but that&#39;s another subject,\n&gt; covered in depth in _JUnit\n&gt; &gt; Recipes_.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; If anyone is going to suggest control the order\n&gt; of executing the test (i.e.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; run ProjectTest before ExperimentTest), note\n&gt; that I need the return value\n&gt; &gt; &gt; from testCreateProject in testCreateExperiment.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; That&#39;s fine -- store that value in a field of\n&gt; TestExperiment and let\n&gt; &gt; testCreateExperiment() use that field.\n&gt; &gt; --\n&gt; &gt; J.
