You may have known it all along, but\n&gt; not the rest of us.\n\nWell, no, it isn&#39;t flawed at all; but I respect your right to disagree. \nThe statement &quot;all serious people have their own test runner&quot; is just \ndownright absurd. In general, such generalizations are specious at best. \nThis is a specific instance. (That said, I&#39;m guilty of plenty of \npremature generalization.)\n\n&gt;  &gt; The problem is, I am /quite/ serious, having spent a\n&gt;  &gt; year writing about\n&gt;  &gt; it and all that. Say whatever you want about the\n&gt;  &gt; quality of the work,\n&gt;  &gt; whoever spends a year writing on a topic is almost\n&gt;  &gt; certainly serious\n&gt;  &gt; about it.\n&gt; \n&gt; This argument I accept :)\n\nExcellent! I&#39;m glad we have found some common ground.\n-- \nJ. B.
