It usually takes a\n&gt; &gt; noticeable time to run them all.\n&gt;\n&gt; Can you quantify this? GSBase, for example, runs tests at approximately\n&gt; 100/second, and that&#39;s my usual performance goal for tests. On my most\n&gt; recent project, I separated tests that required expensive, external\n&gt; resources (there were about 10) from tests than ran entirely in memory\n&gt; (there were about 400). The in-memory tests ran in about 6 seconds.\n&gt;\n&gt; Is this &quot;noticeable&quot; by your standards?

(Hmm, missing some stuff there - must sort out the\nproxy settings). More like 40s outside Eclipse (and with a working proxy).\n\nI used to run with a 0.8GHz supposedly-dula processor and we were talking\nmore like 120s. (The database tests are separate and take 60s seconds\nto run, for mySQL on Linux at least - at one point it was more like 20minutes,\nargh scream; I suspect there aren&#39;t enough of them.)\n\nThe test suite is rather a hotchpotch, as it contains ancient tests from\nbefore our more systematic use of JUnit which are more like acceptance\ntests than unit tests, but them&#39;s what we have. Usually I run the tests for\nthe bit I&#39;m tinkering with at a moments provocation and run the full suite\nwhen I reach some kind of anchor point - the necessity for loading or\nunloading tea, the final new feature working, or Oh My Stars Has It Been\nAn Hour?!\n\n-- \nChris &quot;Jena RDF HP&quot; Dollin\nC FAQs at: http://www.faqs.org/faqs/by-newsgroup/comp/comp.lang.c.html\nC welcome: http://www.angelfire.com/ms3/bchambless0/welcome_to_clc.html\n\n\n",
