I want to test that the method <br/>\ndidn&#39;t throw any errors, and objects were added to several lists.<br/>\nDo I<br/>\n1) invoke the method in setUp and have methods testNoErrors, <br/>\ntestAddedToList1, testAddedToList2 and a tearDown<br/>\nmethod which cleans up the affects of the setUp method.<br/>\n2) keep the same test methods but invoke the method in each test method<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m also having problems with test dependencies. For example, I have a <br/>\ncreate, retrieve and a delete methods. In order to test that the create <br/>\nmethod is working I have to use the retrieve method. In order to clean up <br/>\nafter I need to use the delete method.<br/>\nAny of these could fail but I&#39;m only testing one. If create does fail <br/>\nretrieve can&#39;t be tested because I need create to work to add test data to <br/>\nretrieve. How do people usually get over this?<br/>\nthanksThomas</div>",
