What happens is that I have a custom runner =\r\nthat suppresses the test (these are slow tests, so they are only run at che=\r\nck-in, not by the developer while developing).\n\nHowever, when I replace tha=\r\nt with a Rule, the setup method is still run (looks slow). So I guess the c=\r\nonclusion is that @Rule can&#39;t interrupt or override the setup and teardown =\r\nprocess, so if you need to do that you are back to a Runner? (Or making you=\r\nr own setups rule-aware I guess).\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, David Saff=\r\n &lt;david@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Yishai,\n&gt; \n&gt; I just ran a test, and the Rules in th=\r\ne superclass were picked up.\n&gt; Can you post a small example?
