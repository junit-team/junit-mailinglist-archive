Write tests for Superclass.activateOptions(), as normal\n&gt; - This means that I write test cases for the Filter() Class, Right ? but\n&gt; since the method does not do anything, what tests would I write.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2.  Everywhere in the tests you create an instance of Superclass, extract\n&gt; to a method called create().\n&gt; - How would I extract , and there is no create() method in Filter() class.\n&gt; \n&gt; In the meantime, I would follow the steps that you have written, and I think\n&gt; I am beginning to understand them better.\n\nRead the recipe about &quot;Abstract Test Case&quot;, somewhere in the first few \nchapters. It should be able to explain the idea more completely to you.\n\nBy the way, if WmLoggerFilter.activateOptions() only invokes \nsuper.activateOptions(), then why declare the method at all? Not \ndeclaring it is the same as implementing it as you have done.\n\nGood luck.\n-- \nJ. B.
