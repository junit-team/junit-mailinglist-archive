Please, give =\r\nus\n&gt; &gt; your comments.

David, why do you think using constraints\n&gt; &gt; is heavy weight?\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n Constraint in JMock has two abstract methods: eval and describeTo.\n&gt; Descr=\r\nibe is really cool, because it allows, basically for free, error\n&gt; messages=\r\n like:\n&gt;\n&gt; junit.framework.AssertionFailedError:\n&gt; Expected: not (eq(&lt;a bad=\r\n sentence&gt;) or a string containing &quot;a bad word&quot;)\n&gt; but got : This is a bad =\r\nword\n&gt;\n&gt; On the other hand, it can double the amount of work for each\n&gt; imp=\r\nlementing class. I&#39;m still split on whether this is worth it.\n&gt;\n&gt; This is a=\r\nctually a lot different than saying &quot;Constraints are heavy\n&gt; weight&quot;. It ma=\r\ny be the same thing as saying &quot;it&#39;s not yet quite clear\n&gt; what the perfect =\r\ndefinition of assertThat is&quot;.\n\nDo you mean that constraints &#39;double the amo=\r\nunt of work for each\nimplementing class&#39; because you have to implement two =\r\nmethods instead of\none? If so, I don&#39;t think that this is much of a problem=\r\n since you won&#39;t\nwrite new constraints too often - their power comes from t=\r\nheir ability to be\ncombined after all.\n\n",
