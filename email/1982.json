Your point about AT&#39;s<br/>\nis well taken.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo my way of thinking, flawed though it might be, a unit describes one<br/>\nscenario of one behavior.  For example, if we&#39;re talking about an ordering<br/>\nsystem, a specified product might exist in a number of states, onhand and<br/>\nnot committed, on hand but committed, on order (imminent arrival), on order<br/>\n(protracted arrival), out of stock at the supplier (undetermined<br/>\navailability) or perhaps even never available again.  A customer wanting to<br/>\norder that product might have patterned responses for each of these states.<br/>\nIf the task at hand is to develop a system that will automate the response<br/>\nto a customer placing an order for this item, each possible state and<br/>\noutcome combination constitutes a unit.  Each test case contributing its<br/>\nbehavioral rules to the design.<br/>\n<br/>\nOk, I&#39;ve said my bit beat it up.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards,<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Jason Rogers [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jason.rogers@...\">jason.rogers@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, July 17, 2001 6:57 PM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: RE: [junit] Why doesn&#39;t JUnit count asserts?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think that was the point.  The point was that Matthew (& co.) are<br/>\nusing JUnit for both UTs and ATs (FTs).  JUnit is actually very good for<br/>\nsome types of ATs because it is such a well designed automated testing<br/>\nframework.  They aren&#39;t violating any premises, for as Matthew said they are<br/>\nusing it for UTs in the way it was meant.  But, if it happens to work for<br/>\ntheir ATs, why not use it?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you would still like to get into the debate of what is a &quot;UNIT&quot; though,<br/>\nfeel free.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Jason<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!
