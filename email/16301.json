They also point to an observation I&#39;ve made about<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; abstract classes, explaining why I prefer not to use them.<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; Every abstract class consists of two parts: the abstract part and the<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; concrete part. The concrete part consists of all the fields and methods<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; with implementations (bodies). The abstract part consists of all the<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; declarations of abstract methods.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve had the same suspicion for a while, but have recently refined it. <br/>\n&gt; I now avoid abstract classes _with state_.  Stateless abstract classes<br/>\n&gt; work well as interfaces with default implementations, and I think of<br/>\n&gt; them more that way.  For examples, see Runner and RunListener in JUnit<br/>\n&gt; 4.  (Actually, RunListener is not abstract, but I&#39;m hard-pressed to<br/>\n&gt; think why it would be useful to instantiate it.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>A stateless abstract class is usually a Strategy, so I&#39;d rather use it <br/>\nthan extend it. One exception is the empty Strategy, otherwise known as <br/>\nan Adapter. I usually find those useful for very flexible Strategies <br/>\nwhere I only need to implement a small percentage of the methods.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I otherwise agree with your analysis.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s always comforting. (No, that&#39;s not sarcasm for those of you <br/>\nwondering.)<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
