What\n&gt; would you do to verify\n&gt; for yourself that the method reads the data\n&gt; correctly? Explain that in\n&gt; words and we can convert it to code.\n\nThe method which i want to test returns the file as a\nString object. Now, i was thinking if i have to test\nwhat is read from the file, in the testcase i would\nagain be reading from the file. The contents read from\nthe file would be converted to String which would be\ncompared to the value returned by the method for which\nthe testcase is being written (sorry no TFD). But i\nfound it to be weird idea, so i asked the question :-)\n\n\nI think, it would be correct ( as George suggested )\nto return the InputStream from the method. I can\ncertainly write a testcase for the method returning\ninputstream and checking what is returned in the\nstream. What do you think??\n\nRegards,\nManpreet\n\nP.S. Thanx Lothar, for jotting down all in points\nregarding what all should be tested.\n\n\n\n--- &quot;J. B.
