I know this is a rather broad question but I was <br/>\njust wondering if you found it to be an effective tool when used in <br/>\nconjunction with BV or if it requires a rather long and involved <br/>\nprocess of setting it up and getting broadvision to interact with <br/>\njunit?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\n<br/>\nEric</div>",
