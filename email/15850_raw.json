In=\r\n 2006 anyone who&#39;s running a desktop or a\n&gt; server with less than a gigabyt=\r\ne of RAM is being penny wise and very\n&gt; pound foolish.\n\nLike all things, th=\r\nis depends on context. If you&#39;re writing an\napplication that will dominate =\r\nthe user environment, yes, being memory\nhungry isn&#39;t a crime. If it needs t=\r\no co-exist with several other\napplications, then it is.\n\nA server app runni=\r\nng on a dedicated box can do what it wants. A Java\nGUI app to process shipp=\r\ning orders that needs to be able to accessed\nalong with Word documents, Exc=\r\nel spreadsheets, and Outlook all runing\nas well needs to be more parsimonio=\r\nus. A SWT application designed to\nrun as a status-bar extension probably ca=\r\nn&#39;t even afford the overhead\nof the JVM.\n\nEven if the application is &quot;worth=\r\ny&quot; of the extra memory, it may not be\ncheaper to give it the memory. If you=\r\n intend to deploy the application\nto 10,000 machines in a corporate environ=\r\nment, the $50,000+ in parts\nthe memory upgrade will cost (before installati=\r\non!) lets you afford a\nfew _months_ of improving the memory usage.\n\nContext=\r\n is crucial in any optimisation debate.\n\n--\n               &quot;Software is too=\r\n expensive to build cheaply&quot;\nRobert Watkins           http://twasink.net/  =\r\n         robertdw@...\n\n",
