Or is it a concrete class?\nIt is a concrete class and can be run to connect to the server and access the \ndatabase.\n\n&gt;For what its worth, I&#39;m already leaning towards mock-objects. Are you \nfamiliar w/ them?\nMy understanding of mock-objects is those are the scale-down version of the \nactual object with similar behaviours.  For example, it requires a lot more \nworks (setting up, tearing down, etc) to test a class that accesses a \nfull-scale relational database, but if a mock object of the database (may be \na 2-dimension String array) is used, as long as the object&#39;s methods behaves \nlike the database&#39;s, writing test case for it becomes much simpler.  Am I any \nclose?  I don&#39;t see how can I &#39;mock&#39; a crashed client though.\n\nThanks again for your response.\n\nRegards,\n\nSam\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n",
