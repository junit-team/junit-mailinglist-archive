B. Rainsberger [mailto:jbrains@roge=\r\nrs.com] \n&gt; That&#39;s an interesting approach. It&#39;s slightly different from \n&gt; =\r\nwhat I would do.\n\nInteresting in a good way?  :)\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Why a MockService? =\r\nIs the service not the thing you&#39;re \n&gt; testing? \n\nThe reason I created a Mo=\r\nckService class is because I wanted to test the\ncode in the abstract class =\r\nand to get an instance of the abstract class\nI need a concrete class.  Is a=\r\n mock object the correct terminology in\nthis case?\n\n\n&gt; I always get nervous=\r\n when I have to mock the thing \n&gt; I&#39;m testing. Since you&#39;re testing the eve=\r\nnt source, I would \n&gt; recommend rewriting this test so that the event sourc=\r\ne you \n&gt; test is an actual event source, and not some subclass \n&gt; (however =\r\ntrivial) of it.\n\nThe original intent of my test was to verify that an event=\r\n is fired when\ncertain methods in the abstract class are called and that th=\r\ne event\nobject contained the correct data.  Would that be considered testin=\r\ng the\nevent source?\n\n\n&gt; For example: factor out the event source from the a=\r\nbstract \n&gt; class, then test the event source on its own.\n\nI like this idea.=\r\n  I&#39;ll have to take a look at the design to see how I\ncan work it in.\n\nThan=\r\nks for your help!\n\nKris\n\n\n",
