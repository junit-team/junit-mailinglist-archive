With regards to the last two po=\r\nints,\nwhich I think are definitely interesting:\n\n1) The main thing we were =\r\nhoping to get with classes was help from the\ncompiler, based on a real-life=\r\n experience (in a different context) in which\nsomeone checked in a test tha=\r\nt should have been in the &quot;must pass&quot; group,\nbut mispeled the label name, c=\r\nausing a bug to slip through.  There was also\nthe thought that IDE&#39;s could =\r\nhelp with renames and reference counts.  I&#39;ll\nleave it to more frequent use=\r\nrs of the feature to say whether those have\nbeen worth it.\n\nI&#39;d also take q=\r\nuite seriously any recommendations for how we could enable\nstring-based cat=\r\negory names without breaking existing users.\n\n2) It&#39;s been quite a while si=\r\nnce I&#39;ve thought of JUnitCore.main as the\nprimary &quot;runtime&quot; of JUnit.  It&#39;s=\r\n been many, many years since I worked on a\nteam where invoking that directl=\r\ny was done with any frequency whatsoever.\n The vast majority of tests are r=\r\nun either through IDEs or build systems,\nwhich, as far as I&#39;ve seen, always=\r\n bypass the command-line processing\nfunctionality of JUnitCore in order to =\r\nimplement their own graphical or\nXML-based configuration system.  So adding=\r\n command-line options to\nJUnitCore has become rather low-priority in my boo=\r\nk, since it would help\nsuch a small percentage of users.\n\nThat&#39;s an explana=\r\ntion of the current status quo, which needs not\nnecessarily be maintained.\n=\r\n\nI hope that users and maintainers of other frameworks feel welcome to post=\r\n\ntheir experiences with these other frameworks here.\n\n   David Saff\n\n\n\nOn W=\r\ned, Jan 23, 2013 at 7:41 PM, Charlie Poole &lt;charliepoole@...&gt;wrote:\n\n=\r\n&gt; **\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi All,\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ve been holding my peace, since I figure you all d=\r\non&#39;t particularly want\n&gt; a long\n&gt; dissertation about another test framework=\r\n, running in a different language.\n&gt; However, Matthew&#39;s question seems to c=\r\nall for a clear answer so you can\n&gt; figure out which way you want to go.\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; On Wed, Jan 23, 2013 at 10:57 AM, Matthew Farwell matthew@...\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; **\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Ok. I&#39;m trying to understand what actually =\r\nhappens with NUnit. I mark a\n&gt; &gt; test as &quot;slow&quot;, and run all of the tests i=\r\nn my project. Are you saying\n&gt; that\n&gt; &gt; without selecting the category of t=\r\nests to run, the IDE doesn&#39;t run the\n&gt; &gt; slow tests, that is it only runs t=\r\nests which are not marked as slow? If\n&gt; &gt; this is so, how does it know whic=\r\nh are the slow tests?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; In NUnit, I can mark a test as slow by annotati=\r\nng it [Category(&quot;Slow&quot;)].\n&gt; NUnit\n&gt; has no idea what &quot;Slow&quot; means or what t=\r\no do with it. It&#39;s just a tag. In\n&gt; order\n&gt; to make use of the category I h=\r\nave to either specify it using a\n&gt; command-line\n&gt; option or select it in th=\r\ne Categories window of the NUnit Gui. In either\n&gt; case,\n&gt; I can choose to r=\r\nun all tests or just some categories. I can also choose to\n&gt; exclude some c=\r\nategories. There&#39;s actually more flexibility at the command\n&gt; line than in =\r\nthe Gui, since I can specify boolean combinations of\n&gt; categories\n&gt; there l=\r\nike &quot;Data-Slow&quot;, which means run all the Data category except those\n&gt; also =\r\nmarked as Slow.\n&gt;\n&gt; Here are differences in the implementations, as I have =\r\nobserved them. It\n&gt; may\n&gt; not be complete and could even be dead wrong in t=\r\nhe case of JUnit, so\n&gt; please\n&gt; correct me if I&#39;m off base:\n&gt;\n&gt; 1. NUnit ca=\r\ntegories are strings. JUnit&#39;s are classes.\n&gt; 2. NUnit controls what categor=\r\nies to execute at runtime, without changing\n&gt; the code.\n&gt; JUnit requires ch=\r\nanging the code or at least setting up suites for each of\n&gt; your commonly\n&gt;=\r\n used categories in advance. I suppose some IDEs may allow runtime selectio=\r\nn\n&gt; of categories for JUnit.\n&gt;\n&gt; These two differences appear to be orthogo=\r\nnal.\n&gt;\n&gt; Regarding the first difference: I once spent some time considering=\r\n\n&gt; emulating\n&gt; JUnit and using a Type rather than a string to represent a c=\r\nategory. Use of\n&gt; a\n&gt; Type (class) is more sophisticated and appealed to me=\r\n at first. In the end,\n&gt; I\n&gt; couldn&#39;t really point to an solid advantage to=\r\n the user, so we still use\n&gt; strings.\n&gt;\n&gt; Regarding the second difference: =\r\nRuntime category selection is something\n&gt; NUnit users wouldn&#39;t want to do w=\r\nithout these days. There seems to be no\n&gt; obstacle to allowing it in JUnit =\r\nwhile retaining the ability to define\n&gt; suites as now.\n&gt; That&#39;s what I woul=\r\nd do...\n&gt;\n&gt; Charlie\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been remo=\r\nved]\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
