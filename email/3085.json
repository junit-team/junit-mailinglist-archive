He has been<br/>\n&gt; &gt; doing some macroscopic integration testing with the latest<br/>\n&gt; &gt; CVS of a large number of projects including every Apache<br/>\n&gt; &gt; project and quite a few outside Apache.  He has built an<br/>\n&gt; &gt; automated notification system when changes to the code base<br/>\n&gt; &gt; affect other projects.  For instance, JUnit is used in a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; number of Apache projects, and a recent change forces all<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the current projects testing to break.  Their test cases<br/>\n&gt; &gt; won&#39;t compile.  I highly recommend allowing him to add<br/>\n&gt; &gt; this mailing list (junit@y...) to the list of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; automatic notifications.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Basically what will happen is that if JUnit fails to compile,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; due to changes in dependencies of other projects changing,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; then GUMP will notify you of that change.  Also, when a change<br/>\n&gt; &gt; you committed breaks other projects, you will be notified.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Notification that junit failed to compile can be done, but that is <br/>\nnot what<br/>\n&gt; happened here.   I&#39;m not sure that automatic notification when any <br/>\nother<br/>\n&gt; project fails would be helpful.  If I see a problem in one project <br/>\nthat<br/>\n&gt; looks to be caused by somebody else, I try to do some isolation and <br/>\nmanual<br/>\n&gt; notification.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; The whole reason for this is so that the preferred method of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; deprecating old APIs is enforced, and changes to the API are<br/>\n&gt; &gt; not concidered lightly.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In this case, there were two classes of errors introduced in last <br/>\nnight&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; build.  One was that a deprecated API was removed.  That is quite<br/>\n&gt; reasonable, and gump is helping to get the word out that if people <br/>\nwere<br/>\n&gt; ignoring this deprecation warning up to this point, they really <br/>\nshould plan<br/>\n&gt; for it at this time.  It is remotely possible that a groundswell <br/>\nwill form<br/>\n&gt; asking that this deprecated API be kept on longer, but more likely <br/>\nin my<br/>\n&gt; opinion is that people will simply move up.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The other dealt with class loader issues, and I saw that a related <br/>\nchange<br/>\n&gt; was made in junit at the same time.  It is not clear at this time, <br/>\nhowever,<br/>\n&gt; that that change caused the breakage.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I may be in the minority in this mailing list, but discussion on the<br/>\n&gt; removal of APIs that are actively seems like an appropriate topic <br/>\nfor this<br/>\n&gt; mailing list.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; =- Sam Ruby </span></blockquote></div>",
