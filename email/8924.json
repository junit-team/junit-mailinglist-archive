I don&#39;t think (especially with days delay) there is<br/>\nmuch point my trying to argue all points at once, it is too out of synch.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI think the points (one by one) that need to get agreed or dismissed are:<br/>\n<br/>\n\t1) Are test suites (as collections of tests, which have some<br/>\n\thierarchical/run order effect) are a &quot;second place&quot; to manage relationship<br/>\n\tbetween testcases? Since managing in two places is always flawed, are<br/>\nsuites<br/>\n\tflawed? [If I refactor testcases I might forget to refactor the suites, and<br/>\n\tthat is where errors creep in.]<br/>\n\t2) Are test suites becoming obsoleted by &quot;brute force collectors&quot;? How<br/>\nwould<br/>\n\twe know other than a user survey?<br/>\n\t3) If &quot;suites&quot; have outlived their purpose, why are they the &quot;framework&quot;<br/>\nway<br/>\n\tto manage run order?<br/>\n\t4) Does &quot;run order/dependency&quot; (not side-effect dependency) have any<br/>\n\tvalue -- despite it&#39;s smell?<br/>\n\t5) Is &quot;run order&quot; something that ought be in the framework, however it is<br/>\n\timplemented.<br/>\n<br/>\nregards<br/>\n<br/>\nAdam</div>",
