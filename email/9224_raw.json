I&#39;d assume that I may need to create my\nown TestRunner to perform the &quot;execute tests against remote server&quot;\napproach.  I don&#39;t want to go down a rat hole on this as I think there\nis a chunk of basic Junit knowledge that I&#39;m missing out on as to how to\nbest set up this pattern.\n\nCan anyone lend a hand or point me at some examples of solutions that\nfix similar problems?\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nTom\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
