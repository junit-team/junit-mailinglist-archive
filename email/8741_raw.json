Server starts, then clients each start \n&gt; and interact with the server and make assertions on the response from \n&gt; server.\n\nHmm.  Well, one thing you might consider is that, depending on how\nuseful the library is, it might be easiest to change the clients so that\nthey don&#39;t use that library.\n\n&gt; I&#39;d like to do this from ONE TestCase since that seems like a nicer \n&gt; solution than Ant parallel task.  e.g my TestClientServer  would spawn \n&gt; a server in a different VM and also spawn as many clients as I want \n&gt; each in its own VM and then once all client(s) test methods are done, \n&gt; the TestClientServer tears down.\n&gt; Is there a way to do this.\n\nThere is a way to do anything.  If you mean:  &quot;Does the JUnit framework\nprovide a facility that will let me do this easily?&quot; then the answer is\n&quot;No.&quot;  You will have to provide such a facility yourself.\n\nIt doesn&#39;t seem to me as though it will be a very difficult thing to do,\nthough.  For example: you could use one of the exec methods in Runtime\nto spawn the other VM processes.\n\nHow will your test method make assertions about what has happened in the\nserver VM, or the client VMs?  You&#39;ll have to have some way of allowing\ncommunication between the various virtual machines.  The easiest ways I\ncan think of are:\n\n- server and client programs communicate with their parent process (i.e.\nthe test method) using standard input and output (after spawning a new\nProcess using Runtime.exec(...), you would use the getInputStream() and\ngetOutputStream() methods of the resulting Process to establish\ncommunications with the spawned program).\n\n- server and client programs communicate with their parent process using\nnetwork connections -- perhaps the server and clients create\nServerSockets bound to ports you specify using a startup argument, and\nthe test method creates sockets to communicate with those ports.\n\nCheers,\n\nbn\n\n\n\n",
