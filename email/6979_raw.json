How, if at all, do you determine what&#39;s too little or too much?\n\nTo answer the original question, here is what the efforts I have been\ninvolved in have done:\n\n1) Get an early testing effort started. This is very important. Just get\nsomething started. If you can&#39;t convince management to do TDD, then convince\nthem to do some form of unit testing, even if it isn&#39;t the developer\nthemselves testing. Later on you can get TDD started at some level.\n\n2) Polish up your tests to be effective and efficient at finding bugs.\n\n3) Add new unit test cases to cover bugs you find later so that if the code\nis changed that particular bug is tested for on each build.\n\n4) Conduct various coverage metrics. If you don&#39;t measure you won&#39;t know,\nyou will just be guessing. One hundred percent coverage is desireable, but\nmay not always be attainable, especially in some modes, but by all means\nmeasure it.\n\n5) There are metrics you can use to measure the number and severity of bugs\nthat are being found or that exist in the code at any given time. You will\nsee patterns depending on the development and testing methodologies. In a\nmature process you will see upturns in bug numbers (maybe in severity\ndepending on the maturity of the code) as new features and logic are\nintroduced, then maybe plateaus, and hopefully drop offs. This is where the\nmetrics require some human interpretation. As you gain experience with the\nmetrics and the code, you will gain confidence in what quantity and quality\nof bugs are acceptable for the codebase.\n\nLauren\n\n=====\nLooking for an experienced Java/C++ Software Engineer?\nSee: http://developerdude.mystarband.net/resume.html\n\n\n",
