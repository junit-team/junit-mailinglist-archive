Let us say that I had test classes, Test0, Test1. Each of these<br/>\n&gt; requires a backend to be configured. I&#39;d like to do something like this:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; @RunWith(Suite.class)<br/>\n&gt; @...({Test0.class, Test1.class})<br/>\n&gt; public abstract class MySuite{<br/>\n&gt; abstract public void setBackend(Backend backend);<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; @BeforeClass<br/>\n&gt; public static void doSetup() throws Exception{<br/>\n&gt; //... stuff to get this all pulled together and configure the tests<br/>\n&gt; }<br/>\n&gt; }<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Then all a tester needs to do is extend the class MySuite, implement the<br/>\n&gt; method and s/he gets to run their backend against my tests.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Complicating factors are that java does not allow for annotations to be<br/>\n&gt; inherited unless the @interface is created with the @Inherited<br/>\n&gt; annotation, so attempts to do what is above kick back the message that<br/>\n&gt; there are no tests to run or some such. At least this is my<br/>\n&gt; understanding of java annotations...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The real life example has not just a couple of test classes, but many<br/>\n&gt; more that very rigorously exercise the backend. The kludge is to have<br/>\n&gt; the abstract MySuite class and have the annotations cut and pasted every<br/>\n&gt; time. This is bad since it will make maintainability problematic (we<br/>\n&gt; have lots of different backend configurations people want to test<br/>\n&gt; against). What&#39;s more several people who want to use this really don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; know that much about jUnit and we&#39;d really like it to be the case they<br/>\n&gt; can write a backend then get good feedback on robustness, failure modes,<br/>\n&gt; you name it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Is this clearer?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks in Advance!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Jeff<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; David Saff wrote:<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Jeff,<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Can you expand on what you mean by &quot;The problem is that making a suite<br/>\n&gt;&gt; using annotations does not really work so well.

Now,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; these run against a single backend and now several developers in my<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; group would like to use these tests against other backends to test them.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; The most natural way to do this is with the test suite mechanism in<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; jUnit. That is to say, make up a suite that requires merely that the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; backend be set and test away. Or so I thought.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; The different backends are different projects in our group and live in<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; different Maven modules.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; The problem is that making a suite using annotations does not really<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; work so well. The annotations are not inherited. The other solution<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; which is to have the developers make their own suites by annotations is<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; also very clunky and will probably break at some point.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; So here is my question: Is there any way to make a test suite that is a<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; harness and can be reused?<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; I assume that jUnit 3.8&#39;s method of explicitly creating a suite is going<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; to get deprecated soon, right? So that would be a deadend. Also, are<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; their plans to make annotations inheritable at some point in jUnit? We<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; could maybe live with cutting and pasting for the short term if we knew<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; that this issue would get resolved at some point.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Thanks!<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Jeff<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
