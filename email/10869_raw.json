I am \nrunning several .class tests in my suite() and I would like to have \nsome flexibility as far as running different subsets of tests. I have \ncreated a &quot;TestClient&quot; with a main that collects command line \narguments to know what subset of parametrized tests to run. I&#39;d also \nlike to include &quot;levels&quot; of testing. Basically, I&#39;d like to be able \nto run certain sets of tests based on a command line parameter. \neg.) java TestClient &lt;-detailed | -normal | -brief &gt; \nThe only option I can seem to think of is to have the suite add tests \nby methodName and do so conditionally (based on a static global \nvariable). \n\nif(detailed){\n   suite.addTest(newTestClient(&quot;testItemA&quot;)) \n}\n\nThe problem with this is that I&#39;d have to list every single \ntestMethod for the test. Instead, I&#39;d like to add the tests to the \nsuite as .class files and use any another approach. Can anyone think \nof anything? Any suggestions out there? \nThanks!\nClaudio\n\n\n\n",
