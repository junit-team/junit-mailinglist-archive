Maybe a set of tests in a\nsuite share so=\r\nme set up and tear down stuff.\n\nWhat it looks like here is your tests are d=\r\nependent on a nightly job\nto run and worst their order.  It has always been=\r\n my understanding\nthat each test is order independent.  I remember early on=\r\n stuff saying\nthat one was not guaranteed what order the tests would run in=\r\n.\nGranted I think this randomization was never done, but it was made to\nsho=\r\nw a concept.  The concept being, a person should be able to run a\ngiven fai=\r\nled test over and over (with some of source under test having\nmodifications=\r\n) until it passes.  There should not be a whole series of\nsteps that have t=\r\no run in order to get a single test to pass.\n\nI can speak from experience, =\r\nrequiring a procedure of tests to run\ninorder to get the desired results le=\r\nads to tests that are turned off\nor forgotten about.\n\nI have some questions=\r\n...\n\nAre you testing the nightly job?\nCould the initialization for Test2.my=\r\nTest() actually be setup in a\nsetup method?  --Then no need to rely on the =\r\nnightly job.\n\nsomething you should consider...\n- &quot;Ideally, each test case i=\r\ns independent from the others&quot; --\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_Test\n--=\r\n Along these lines, the results of one test should not dictate the\nresults =\r\nof another.\n\nHope I added some insight,\n\nBig Mike\n\nOn Fri, Aug 14, 2009 at =\r\n11:21 PM, trenton_adams2001&lt;trenta@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hi Guys,\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m=\r\n just wondering. =A0Have the JUnit developers considered adding dependency =\r\nannotations to JUnit? =A0You could annotate your code with say\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;@TestDe=\r\npendency Test1 public void myTest() {code;}&quot;, which would cause myTest() to=\r\n depend on Test1 running it&#39;s tests first.\n&gt;\n&gt; A scenario where this might =\r\nbe needed...\n&gt; 1.
