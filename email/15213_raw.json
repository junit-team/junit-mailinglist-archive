However I have hard \ntime to rerun test cases created by my suite method. You are right that \nwith &quot;keep junit running&quot; option in debug mode &quot;Run&quot; action does not \nfail, but it does not execute the test either. I&#39;ve added tracing to the \ntest method and it is just not being called. I still wonder what am I \ndoing wrong here?\n\n  I am using Eclipse 3.2M1...\n\n  regards,\n  Eugene\n\n\nJeff Grigg wrote:\n\n&gt;--- Eugene Kuleshov &lt;eu@m...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;   Thank you for cheching this. But exactly this sequence does\n&gt;&gt;not work for me and never worked giving the errors like this:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;junit.framework.AssertionFailedError: Could not create\n&gt;&gt;test &#39;testParam 0.8010281114425616&#39;\n&gt;&gt;   at junit.framework.TestResult$1.protect(TestResult.java:106)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;   Can you please confirm that you actually tried the test\n&gt;&gt;suite I&#39;ve sent? It generates 100 test cases using the\n&gt;&gt;following suite() code:\n&gt;&gt;[...]\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;I found, upon looking into it, that Eclipse does have the /option/ \n&gt;of keeping the JUnit process/JVM running, so it can restart \n&gt;individual test instances.\n&gt;\n&gt;Eclipse 3.0.1 gives me this informative error message:\n&gt;  &quot;To rerun tests they must be launched under the debugger\n&gt;   and &#39;Keep JUnit running&#39; must be set in the launch configuration&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;So this only works with DEBUG runs.  And then only if you enable \n&gt;it.  (And it can only be enabled if your JVM supports &quot;hot code \n&gt;replacement.&quot;)  This is not the default behavior.\n&gt;\n&gt;(And *good luck* if you&#39;re using NetBeans, JBuilder or ant, and you \n&gt;want process and instance preservation across runs!!!   ;-)\n&gt;\n&gt;From &quot;help&quot; documentation:\n&gt;  &#39;A JUnit launch configuration has a &quot;keep alive&quot; option. If your \n&gt;Java virtual machine supports &quot;hot code replacement&quot; you can fix the \n&gt;code and rerun the test without restarting the full test run. To \n&gt;enable this option select the Keep JUnit running after a test run \n&gt;when debugging checkbox in the JUnit launch configuration.&#39;\n&gt;\n&gt;...\n&gt;\n&gt;Otherwise, it launches a new process (new JVM, new test object \n&gt;instances) on each JUnit run.\n&gt;\n&gt;To see this behavior, select &quot;Window -&gt; Preferences&quot;, &quot;Run/Debug -&gt; \n&gt;Launching&quot; and uncheck the &quot;Remove terminated launches when a new \n&gt;launch is created&quot; option.\n&gt;\n&gt;Then, in the &quot;Debug&quot; view (so you can see the list of processes, run \n&gt;a few tests.  Each one gets its own process.\n&gt;\n&gt;Now it&#39;s true that when my &#39;suite()&#39; method builds tests from \n&gt;standard TestCase classes with standard test methods, I can rerun \n&gt;any test class or method with a right click, &quot;Run&quot;.  But each one \n&gt;spawns a separate process.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
