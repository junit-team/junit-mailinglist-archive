Writing\ntests to illustrate reported bugs sounds like an excellent approach.  I am\nworking on a decent sized system that does not have any tests so choosing\ntest areas was a question of mine as well.\n\tI have a second problem with testing this system.  How do you test a\ntightly coupled system?  One answer is to use tests to drive better design.\nHowever, it would take too long and be too risky to redesign major parts of\nthe system.  So, while the design takes time to improve, do you have any\nsuggestions for how to test a very coupled system that requires setting up\nseveral things before the class being tested will function properly?  i.e.\nWhat are some good strategies that will help locate bugs and improve\ndevelopment speed without shutting down development?\n\n",
