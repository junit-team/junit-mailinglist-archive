Not even Mr. Bertrand Meyer (the inventor \n&gt; of DBC) claims that. If you wanted to test correctnes of \n&gt; implementatio with DBC you would have to duplicate a function&#39;s \n&gt; algorithm - or an equivalent one - in its postcondition. Tests \ndon&#39;t \n&gt; suffer from that dilemma since tests can work with samples.\n\n&gt; DBC is not about compile time verification but about runtime \nchecks. \n&gt; Code verification has some relationship to DBC but is a different \n&gt; field of research. \n\n&gt; No, that&#39;s not what happens when using DBC.\n\nI don&#39;t care if the original DBC was not designed to do that. But it \nCAN be modified to do what I want to be done with DBC. As you said, \ncode verification has relationship with DBC.\n\nLets not call it DBC, call it XXX if you want.\n\nThere is a way to use preconditions, postconditions and invariants to \nreplace at least most JUnit tests.\n\nXXX can be used to create test data at compile time for each method. \nAny test data can be used randomly for that purpose as long as it \nobeys the precondition. The result of the method can be automatically \ncompared at compile time with the postcondition. Invariants never may \nbe violated.\n\nThat is all done at *compile time*. My XXX has nothing to do with \nchecking at run time but with checking at compile time.\n\nMany nice things can done with XXX. For example &quot;Liskovsches \nSubstitutionsprinzip&quot; can be checked very natively with using XXX \ninstead of JUnit. This is just one benefit of many using XXX.\n\n\n\n",
