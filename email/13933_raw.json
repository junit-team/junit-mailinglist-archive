Decorators\nintroduced in annotations also lead to code that is difficult to analyze\nstatically. Would it be possible to create a helper class that you invoke\nfrom @Befores? For example:\n\n@Before expensiveSetup() {\n  fixture= new ExpensiveFixture();\n  fixture.setUp();\n}\n\nWe simplified JUnit by unifying the two phases of creating the tests and\nexecuting the tests, but now we need to reintroduce some of the flexibility\nwe removed. We have exhausted our ideas for the API for dynamically created\ntests. We would like to see concrete proposals for the API. In the meantime,\nyou can still use old classes with suite() methods with the JUnit 4 test\nrunner.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nKent Beck\nThree Rivers Institute\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On \n&gt; Behalf Of Robert Watkins\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, June 16, 2005 5:36 AM\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: Re: [junit] JUnit 4\n&gt; \n&gt; Kent Beck wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Robert,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; This is an interesting idea. It would be very powerful. I&#39;m \n&gt; having trouble\n&gt; &gt; understanding what you would use it for beyond what you can do with\n&gt; &gt; @Before/@After and @BeforeClass and @AfterClass, though. Do \n&gt; you have an\n&gt; &gt; example?\n&gt; \n&gt; Kent,\n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s not so much that I think it couldn&#39;t be done with the existing \n&gt; annotations, as that it would be more elegant if a decorator \n&gt; annotation was \n&gt; directly available.\n&gt; \n&gt; An example that I&#39;ve got right at hand is a decorator I used \n&gt; to set up the \n&gt; JNDI space with mock objects, so that the code-under-test had \n&gt; access to \n&gt; expected resources. I used a decorator, rather than a base \n&gt; class, because I \n&gt; needed this to be available across several different test \n&gt; hierarchies, some \n&gt; of which already extended from different sub-class of TestCase. An \n&gt; alternative would have been to use a duplicated setUp() \n&gt; method. But this \n&gt; was ugly duplication... Another good example would be for using IoC \n&gt; techniques on the test itself.\n&gt; \n&gt; With the @Before/@After annotations, I could do something \n&gt; similar. But it \n&gt; would still be duplication that would be annoying. With an annotation \n&gt; decorator I&#39;d be able to reduce that duplication to a single \n&gt; declaration of \n&gt; intent.\n&gt; \n&gt; More generally, however, I&#39;d like a way to extend JUnit \n&gt; without fighting \n&gt; it. There are some powerful techniques in JUnit 3.8 that I \n&gt; wouldn&#39;t want to \n&gt; lose, for example - one such is the ability to \n&gt; programatically create test \n&gt; cases (see \n&gt; http://twasink.net/blog/archives/2003/10/junit_and_datad.html \n&gt; for more on this - or Chapter 4.8 of JB Rainsberger&#39;s &quot;JUnit \n&gt; Recipes&quot;). In \n&gt; JUnit 4, there appears to be no way to do the same thing; I&#39;d \n&gt; be forced to \n&gt; have a single test, which read the data file iteratively - \n&gt; needless to say, \n&gt; this wouldn&#39;t give me the same level of granularity in reports.\n&gt; \n&gt; In fact, in order to get the same level of flexibility in \n&gt; JUnit 4 as is in \n&gt; JUnit 3, you&#39;d need at the very least to give an equivalent \n&gt; of the suite() \n&gt; method - currently, there is no way to change the way that \n&gt; test instances \n&gt; are obtained. Perhaps a test class could define a TestFactory \n&gt; annotation, \n&gt; which would default to the TestInstropector?\n&gt; \n&gt; (Actually, for the ultimate in flexibility, you&#39;d need to \n&gt; provide a way to \n&gt; change the runner strategy, too - but that&#39;s probably overkill)\n&gt; \n&gt; Ultimately, what I would like to be able to do is have equivalents of \n&gt; popular JUnit extensions, such as DBUnit, ServletUnit, and \n&gt; JUnitPerf, which \n&gt; are configured using annotations rather than base classes. \n&gt; The annotations \n&gt; currently in JUnit 4 wouldn&#39;t allow this.\n&gt; \n&gt; (Cedric, if you&#39;re reading this... every one of these points \n&gt; applies to \n&gt; TestNG as well)\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt;                 &quot;Software is too expensive to build cheaply&quot;\n&gt; Robert Watkins         http://twasink.net/          \n&gt; robertdw@...\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo!
