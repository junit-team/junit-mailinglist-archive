What type of object should<br/>\nanswer them?  I often cringe about &#39;promising&#39; too much from my objects<br/>\nbecause it means I will end up needing to support it.  But I am soothed<br/>\nwhen I find just the right object that does just the right thing; then I<br/>\ndon&#39;t mind making those sort of promises to the system.  This comes<br/>\nthrough much refactoring! I never get it right the first time.  So, I<br/>\nhave learned to deal with the cringes, confident that sooner or later<br/>\nthey will be soothed.  So, my suggestion &lt;sorry for the long rant&gt; is<br/>\nthat you begin by opening up the methods.  When the cringe becomes to<br/>\nmuch to bear think more critically about who can answer that question<br/>\nfor you.  Refactor mercilessly!!<br/>\n<br/>\n=jason<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Mon, 2002-07-29 at 20:49, Dave Astels wrote: On Mon, 2002-07-29 at<br/>\n18:41, p_d_w_219 wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The methods that I most want to test are often the ones I want to <br/>\n&gt; declare as private.

Those methods are naturally public, since<br/>\nthey are external behaviour.  This means that all methods called by<br/>\ntests are public.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs you refactor you will be creating private methods (as you extract<br/>\nmethods and so on).  These do not need to be explicitly tested, as the<br/>\nbahaviour of the class has not changed... just details of where the code<br/>\nresides.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo... tests drive the creation of public methods, refactoring drives the<br/>\ncreation of private methods.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are times when one of these private, created-due-to-refactoring<br/>\nmethods is useful to call from outside.  Then you make it public.  With<br/>\nTDD you will already have a test in place, when you realize that an<br/>\nexisting private method does what you need.<br/>\n<br/>\nSummary: You don&#39;t need to test private methods if you&#39;re doing TDD<br/>\nrigorously.<br/>\n<br/>\nDave<br/>\n-- <br/>\nDave Astels (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dave@...\">dave@...</a>)<br/>\n  Coauthor of &quot;A Practical Guide to XP&quot;<br/>\n  Editor of the Test-Driven Development Edition of The Coad Letter<br/>\n    (subscribe at www.thecoadletter.com)<br/>\n  Presenter at XP2002 (www.xp2002.org) of:<br/>\n    the &quot;XP For One&quot; tutorial & &quot;Refactoring with UML&quot; paper<br/>\nCEO & Master Software Craftsman, Saorsa Development Inc.<br/>\nwww.saorsa.com<br/>\n&quot;An Agile Software Studio&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!
