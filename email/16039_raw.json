However, for commercial software development, is this\nstill possible ?\n\n\nAlthough I knew JUnit and other JUnit-based open-source tools for a\ncouple of years, my company and team never really enbrace it. The\nmajor reason is Product Managers always want to add cool features to\nthe system quickly while programmers find the schedule is always too\ntight to spend any extra time to write testing. \n\nI know from the mail list and books that we can take lots of advantage\nof JUnit-based testing, I myself have no real hands-on experience on\nit. So here are my questions: \n\n* Will Junit-based testing make the project time longer or shorter ?\nAny hard statistic data ? ( Here I mean commercial project rather than\nopen-source project. )\n\n* One intersting point I found is that after Junit-based testing is\nintroduced, programmers tend to use IDE debugger much less than\nbefore.  This would save lots of time. Is that true ?\n\n* Some guys say JUnit is good for biz / util code testing. But for web\napplication development, where HTML/javascript would be root cause of\nlots of bugs, Junit is not so powerful. Any comments ? \n\n* How can I convince managers and programmers that JUnit-based is\nreally possible for commercial software development ? Any differnece\nfrom open-source projects ?\n\n\n \nCan some Junit gurus shed some light here ?\n\nThanks, \n- Frank\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nYahoo! Groups Links\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n",
