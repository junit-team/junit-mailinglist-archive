I would like to have an &quot;after&quot; test that is run after all other=\r\n\ntests (no matter what tests you are running, single class, package or\nproj=\r\nect). This is because I have set up an\nThread.setDefaultUncaughtExceptionHa=\r\nndler that will pick up if threads die\nunexpectedly (and I do that by a &quot;be=\r\nfore&quot; logic that relies on a static\nblock in ALL tests, which obviously als=\r\no would be nice if I could place in a\n&quot;before&quot; test, harness). I want this =\r\n&quot;after&quot; test to check that this number\nis 0, and if not, fail the test.\n\nIt=\r\n sounds slightly like this magic-all-tests-add Rule thing could fix my\nprob=\r\nlem - if the Eclipse runner honors this, of course. Just wanted to\nmention =\r\nit, if some tools in the future could take it into account!\n\nThanks,\nEndre.=\r\n\n\nOn Fri, Dec 4, 2009 at 16:34, Bogdan\n&lt;bogdan.mocanu.notifications@gmail.c=\r\nom&gt;wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi everyone,\n&gt;\n&gt; as we have it currently, we can place a R=\r\nule in a test, and that rule will\n&gt; be activated for that test. To have the=\r\n rule working in several tests, you\n&gt; have to place the Rule in each test.\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; However, I am searching for a way to activate a Rule for all the tests =\r\nthat\n&gt; are executed, without needing to add the rule to each test. Perhaps =\r\nby\n&gt; specifying a Java property parameter when running the tests (I could a=\r\nlso\n&gt; set this as a global Java option, therefore being used upon each exec=\r\nution\n&gt; of the JVM).\n&gt;\n&gt; Do you know if this is possible?\n&gt;\n&gt; The reason wh=\r\ny I need this, is: I am making the plans and gathering the\n&gt; ideas for crea=\r\nting a simple Swing application that will display the results\n&gt; of the exec=\r\nuted tests (just like the JUnit view in Eclipse/Idea/Netbeans,\n&gt; but perhap=\r\ns with more details, and also available for anyone, not just IDE\n&gt; users). =\r\nCurrently I developed a small agent rule, that you can place in your\n&gt; test=\r\n, and it will report to the console the status of your tests (the Swing\n&gt; c=\r\nonsole runs remotely).\n&gt;\n&gt; This is ok, but it means that you will have to a=\r\ndd this rule to each and\n&gt; every test that you have. It also means that wil=\r\nl not be an easy task to\n&gt; disable this rule, if you don&#39;t want it anymore.=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Therefore a possibility to enable Rules globally for all tests I think=\r\n is\n&gt; the best solution for my case, and also a good tool to have for vario=\r\nus\n&gt; other tasks.\n&gt;\n&gt; What do you think? Also, what do you think about the =\r\nSwing console idea?\n&gt;\n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; Bogdan\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n[Non-text portions of th=\r\nis message have been removed]\n\n\n",
