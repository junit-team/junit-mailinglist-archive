I test equals() according to its contract as specified in its\ndocumentation in Object.  Joshua Bloch also explains it well in his book,\n_Effective Java_.  What I test for, then, are the following:  reflexivity,\nsymmetry, transitivity, consistency and &quot;non-nullity,&quot; to use Bloch&#39;s terms.\nI create three identical instances of a class and use them in various\nasserts.  I could share if you like.  I&#39;ll have to think about what value\nyour idea might bring to my test.\n\nRegarding an assertNotEquals() method specifically, I have not yet noticed\nthe lack of this method while writing tests.  It&#39;s clearer than using\nassertFalse() as you described.  One reason that I can think of for its\nexclusion is that it would likely need to be provided in every &quot;flavor&quot; of\nassertEquals(), virtually doubling the number of methods in Assert.\n\nThanks for sharing,\nCraig\n\n",
