Solutions based on language features are more likely to <br/>\nbe adopted than solutions based on extra-language design decisions. <br/>\nAgain, if extra-language conventions were enough, we wouldn&#39;t have <br/>\nneeded Java or C++. You can write object oriented code in C. You just <br/>\ncan&#39;t enforce it.<br/>\n<br/>\nApparently some people on this list believe they do want a language <br/>\nwithout access protection. It would be interesting to explore such a <br/>\nlanguage, and if practice proved it useful, they might even convince me. <br/>\nHowever, that would be a new language. not Java. Access protection is a <br/>\nfairly fundamental part of Java. You&#39;ll have more success working with <br/>\nthe language than against it.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n﻿Elliotte Rusty Harold  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:elharo@...\">elharo@...</a><br/>\nXML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/\">http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim\">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim</a></div>",
