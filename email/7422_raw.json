It can provide many benefits and by the same time not \nhaving all the side effects that JUnit and TDD have. Examples are \nEiffel and Java Modelling Language (JML).\n\nWhy? How? I&#39;ll explain.\n\nTesting of the code (methods) can be done with precondition, \ninvartiants and postconditions (the contracts). Thats how I \nunderstand Design by Contract. You write your method definition and \nthen you write the contract for it. Then you implement your method. \n\nNow the great thing: When you compile your code the implementation \ncan be checked whether it obeys the contract. If not, a compile error \nis thrown. That it! No JUnit test needed! Not TDD needed! Besides \nthis, a contract serves as a documentation. And it can use invariants \nwhich JUnit will always lack of.\n\nNow come on and don&#39;t tell me: &quot;We always used JUnit, most people do, \nwhy do you little inexperienced programer think you have a better \nidea than people like Gamma or Fowler?&quot;\n\nI am not satisfied with the JUnit and TDD &quot;paradigma&quot;. They are \noriginated because of a *poverty* in Java programing language. If \nJava would support proper Design by Contract and a compiler for that \nthan no one would bother with JUnit and TDD.\n\n\n\n",
