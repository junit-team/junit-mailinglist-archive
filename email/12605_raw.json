I&#39;m not afraid to write long method names, but sometimes\n&gt; it gets out of hand and I need a paragraph to explain the situation.\n&gt; Generally, this is testing some kind of complicated business logic,\n&gt; where the word &quot;logic&quot; here is often a cruel double-entendre.  An\n&gt; example:\n&gt;\n&gt; public void \n&gt; testMultipleCustomerPurchaseOrderEntriesForOneSalesOrderLine();\n&gt;\n&gt; The test method is about a page of code, on the heavy side of the\n&gt; average for our codebase but nothing gigantic.  Still, I felt it\n&gt; needed a comment in plain english, which is:\n\nIt&#39;s good that you had that feeling and didn&#39;t ignore it.  It meant \nthat you wanted to communicate something to the reader that you felt \nwas missing in the code, or that wasn&#39;t easy to grok from reading the \ncode.\n\n&gt; Tests that this mapper creates multiple customerPurchaseOrder entries\n&gt; associated with the sales order line, when multiples exist across line\n&gt; items.\n\nI try to arrange my test case classes around common text fixtures.  One \nside effect of doing that is it gives me an extra layer of context (a \nnamespace) on top of the test method name.  So, given my limited \nknowledge of your problem domain, I might have a test case like this:\n\n   public class OneSalesOrderLineTest extends TestCase {\n\n     public void setUp() {\n       // fixture for one sales order line\n     }\n\n     public void testCreateMultipleCustomerPurchaseOrderEntries() {\n     }\n\n     public void testSomethingElseAboutOneSalesOrderLine() {\n     }\n   }\n\nWhen I&#39;m reading tests in this class, I know I&#39;m in the context of one \nsales order line.  That is, there are no test methods in \nOneSalesOrderLineTest() that don&#39;t use all of the fixture objects in \nsetUp().\n\n&gt; This particular example is partly about readability (you could infer a\n&gt; lot of the information, possibly, from the method name) and part about\n&gt; disambiguity.  There are other tests involving CustomerPurchaseOrders\n&gt; and Sales Order Lines that are similar.\n\nDoes using a separate test case help with the ambiguity?\n\n&gt; Most of the time, these comments are written before the test.  I guess\n&gt; you could say I practice document-first test development.  I write a\n&gt; sentence or two about what the test is going to do (or just a method\n&gt; name if it suffices -- you&#39;re right that it often does) then I write\n&gt; the test.\n\nI often use that technique, as well.  By writing out prose, I find \nwords that I&#39;d like to use in the test method name.\n\n&gt; Ultimately, why wouldn&#39;t you want to write actual sentences?  I like\n&gt; Java a lot, but English was my first language.\n\nI&#39;m not saying you should never write sentences.  However, if I can \nconvey the same meaning in a method name, I&#39;ll do that instead of \nmaintaining two separate pieces of information (the sentence and the \nmethod name).\n\n---\nMike Clark\nClarkware Consulting, Inc.\nhttp://clarkware.com\n\n\n",
