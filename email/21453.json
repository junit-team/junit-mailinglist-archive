And in situations where that&#39;s a<br/>\ncommon edit case, it probably makes sense.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, I miss the client-interface feedback that Nat mentioned.<br/>\nUsing a car metaphor, it&#39;s like my tests can tell me &quot;hey, checking<br/>\nthe oil dipstick every couple days is annoying: why not build in a<br/>\n&#39;Oil Low&#39; indicator light?&quot;  In code in which I intend to work<br/>\nlong-term, I&#39;d prefer the different-package tests.<br/>\n<br/>\n   David Saff</div>",
