Discovered \nDBUnit, but I&#39;m not sure how I should approach my problem.\n\nWe migrate a database from one data schema to another, completely\ndifferent. I want to be sure data is migrated correctly (so that for\nexample a customer keeps its orders).\n\nMy first idea was to iterate on customers in the source database, and\ncheck its data against the new database.\nFor example, for a customer, I would have tests on, amongst others:\n-contacts\n-orders\n-address\nand each test would be run for each row coming from the source database.\n\nIs that the correct approach? \nFrom what I discovered of JUnit, I&#39;m not sure how to integrate the\niteration in the test suite ( The same test would be run against all rows\nfrom the database).\n\nThanks in advance for your help. I hope I didn&#39;t miss any obvious thing\nbefore posting this....\n\nRaph\n\n\n",
