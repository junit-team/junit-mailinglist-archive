At least that&#39;s\nthe methodology I use (no change happens to my code until there&#39;s a\nfailing test forcing the change, except for refactoring).  So the code\ncoverage tool shouldn&#39;t be (as) necessary.  I&#39;ve found I only use them\nfor those project where (someone else :) wrote the code without writing\ntests first.  In that case, it helps to know the coverage, but also can\ngive me a false sense of security.\n \n..David..\n \n\n________________________________\n\nFrom: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of\nJim Cakalic\nSent: Thursday, September 01, 2005 8:54 AM\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: [junit] Re: How to test private methods in a class.\n\n\nJ. B. Rainsberger wrote:\n&gt; JBR&#39;s postulate 1. For every testable design that requires exposing \n&gt; elements &quot;just for testing&quot;, there exists an equivalent testable \n&gt; design that does not require exposing elements &quot;just for testing&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; In other words, if I add a method &quot;just for testing&quot;, I can usually\n&gt; find a way to restructure the design so that that method either \n&gt; earns its keep or goes away. I don&#39;t have a specific example right \n&gt; now, because whenever I see one, I don&#39;t have time to write about \n&gt; it.\n&gt; \n\nNice. \n\nAfter thinking about it for awhile, here are some things I think could\nbe done (in order) before making private methods public for testing\nwhen you are practicing TDD:\n\n1. Use a code coverage tool to determine whether the method is\nalready being adequately covered by tests against the existing public\nmethods of the class. If so, stop worrying. You&#39;re done.\n    http://java-source.net/open-source/code-coverage\n\n2. If test coverage is inadequate, determine whether unit tests\nagainst the existing public methods can be added. Do it. Return to\nstep 1.\n\n3. Determine whether Extract Class should be used to split the\nresponsibilities of the class into two or more abstractions. If so,\nrefactor and write unit tests for the public methods of the new\nclasses. Return to step 1.\n\n4. Delete the code (OK! OK! -- just set the current implementation\naside) and reimplement the class using the existing unit tests.\nComment out all but one test and get to green. Do the simplest thing\nthat works. Only write code that is actually required to satisfy the\ntest. Refactor aggressively. Repeat.\n\nThoughts?\n\nRegards,\nJim\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________________________\n\nYAHOO!
