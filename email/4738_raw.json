This weekend I took those sources and \npolished them up into an actual JUnit extension, so you don&#39;t have to go \nin and patch your JUnit sources to access that functionality.  For those \nnot doing functional testing, JFunc may still have a feature or two that \nyou may find worthwhile.  The current features I have implemented:\n\n* Multiple failures\n* Easing the pains of Manual Suite Construction\n\t+ Concise, typesafe, suite construction using proxies\n\t+ Use one test object for a series of tests, rather than the one \ntest instance per test\n\t+ Test methods can accept arguments\n* Enhanced Test Runner\n\t+ Verbose assertions\n\t+ Pass arguments to tests on the CLI\n\nBeyond just coding in features, I&#39;d like to be able to put together some \ndocumentation on functional testing methodologies.\n\nThe code is licensed under the IBM Common Public License.\n\nYou can find the source and binaries on http://jfunc.sourceforge.net\n\n-shane\n\n\n",
