The &quot;catch&quot; is that I have to\ncontribute testing-related exam=\r\nples - in other words: beautiful test\ncode.  \n\nI already have some ideas of=\r\n what to cover, but I thought some of the\npeople in this group might have s=\r\nome examples of tests that they\nconsider particularly &quot;beautiful&quot; or clever=\r\n in their approach.\n\nI think it&#39;s great that developer testing has reached =\r\nthe point that\nsome authors/editors thought of including testing in such a =\r\nbook, and\nI want to make sure I pick the best possible example(s) to pick f=\r\nrom.\n\nThanks,\n\nAlberto\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
