I did have to declare the variables as=\r\n\nstatic, but that didn&#39;t bother me. I might even declare them final and ski=\r\np\nthe @BeforeClass and @AfterClass completely.\n\nAs for the rest of the disc=\r\nussion which I really wish I could follow during\nthe day, but have to wait =\r\nuntil I get home in the evening, I like the idea\nof trying the more test dr=\r\niven approach. Not totally convinced that&#39;ll work\nin this example, but wort=\r\nh a try. Also, I&#39;m trying to get up to speed on the\nnew Theories as they mi=\r\nght fit some of the invariant nature of the\nmathematics involved with fract=\r\nions. (I&#39;m still stuck in a timewarp back at\nJUnit 4.0)\n\n(As an aside, this=\r\n is why I teach JUnit using simple objects, because then\nthe object is simp=\r\nle enough to fade into the background, leaving just the\nunit testing princi=\r\nples and approaches to be mentally wrangled.)\n\nDavid: on first inspection, =\r\nI found your code to be very terse. This is a\ngood thing in some situations=\r\n, but this code was/is designed for teaching\nand that&#39;s why I created varia=\r\nbles with names like oneHalf and threeFifths,\nso that the lines of code wou=\r\nld read better. There&#39;s method to my madness!\n\nI like the concept of valuin=\r\ng more than just code coverage in our tests and\nthe thought of domain cover=\r\nage through well chosen test data is an appealing\none. I&#39;ll give that some =\r\nmore thought.\n\nThank you for a most interesting discussion.\n\nSimon\n\n\n\n2010/=\r\n8/22 C=C3=A9dric Beust =E2=99=94 &lt;cedric@...&gt;\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Simon,\n&gt;\n&gt; Actua=\r\nlly, I was wrong: using @BeforeClass will break your tests. Since\n&gt; JUnit\n&gt;=\r\n reinstantiates a brand new class before each test method, only the first\n&gt;=\r\n method will get the correct values for these fields. Subsequent methods\n&gt; =\r\nwill\n&gt; see null.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n-- \nsimonpeter.org | simonpeter.com | newlife-upc.org\n=\r\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
