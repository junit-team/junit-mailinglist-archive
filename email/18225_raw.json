I usually =\r\nrecommend to *not* use mocks until you \nactually hit a barrier ( e.g. your =\r\ntests take way too long).  Even \nso, tests that take a long time to run are=\r\n okay in my book if what \nyou are testing actually takes a long time. \n\nAls=\r\no, have you taken a look at TestNG? ( http://testng.org) \n\nIt&#39;s more geared=\r\n to functional testing than JUnit is and it might cut \ndown on your code as=\r\n well, thanks to features such as DataProviders \n(data-driven testing) and =\r\ndependent methods... \n\nLet me know if you have any questions. \n=3D=3D=3D=3D=\r\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=\r\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=\r\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D \n\n\nI replied like this : \n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=\r\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=\r\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=\r\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D \nYou make some interesting points - maybe th=\r\ne idea of less unit \ntesting and more functional testing is it... I can see=\r\n the point of \nunit testing, but it does seem to be an awful lot of work fo=\r\nr not \nmuch return. \n\nI know what you mean about the mocks, but in order to=\r\n make some of \nour objects, you need to have a pile of other objects, and o=\r\nther \nobjects to make those, and so on, and it kind of piles up! \nAlso, isn=\r\n&#39;t the point of the tests mainly to assert what methods are \ncalled on what=\r\n other objects, which you can only do with mocks? \nAnd how could I test the=\r\n result of those objects misbehaving, ie that \nthe exception I expect is th=\r\nrown from the service when the DAO fails \nto write and throws an exception?=\r\n That&#39;s not something I could make \nhappen with a mock. And actually, I don=\r\n&#39;t suppose I should try, or \nit&#39;ll go & try to write to a database, won&#39;t i=\r\nt? \nOr have I misunderstood or been misled here? \n\nI haven&#39;t heard of TestN=\r\nG - I&#39;ll take a peek... \n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=\r\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=\r\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D \n\n=\r\nMaybe this is also helpful to someone else out there, or at least \nmildly i=\r\nnteresting! :) \n\nCheers, \nTracey\n\n\n\n\n",
