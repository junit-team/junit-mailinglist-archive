All strings/characters in Java are unicode and \nthe encoding should be opaque to you.\n\nUTF-8 is an encoding for writing strings/characters out to a stream. All \nunicode characters can be written to UTF-8.\n\nI am sure there is a real requirement here, but I think we need a little \nmore information to understand what it is and to help you test for it.\n\nKevin\n\nRitesh wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Hi Guys,\n&gt; \n&gt; I have a requirement where I need to be able to assert that any given \n&gt; String object (in Java ofcourse) is UTF8 or not. Meaning all the \n&gt; characters in the string are actually UTF-8 characters.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have some ideas, but I want to see if someone has a better idea or \n&gt; the solution is already out there.\n&gt; \n&gt; Does anyone know how to do that?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks in advance\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo!
