We are offering a special discounted rate of\n$1499 through the Super-Early Bird date of May 27.  Members of the\nAgileAlliance, ACM, or IEEE are eligible for a rate of $1399.  The academic rate\nis $549 until May 27.  Please act quickly to ensure that you take advantage of\nthese special rates, a significant savings over the Just-In-Time rate of $1799.\n\nThe merger of XP Agile Universe with the Agile Development Conference has\nresulted in a record number of submissions and a very strong program.  We have\nan excellent collection of tutorials, workshops, experience reports and research\npapers.  Some of the tutorial and workshop presenters include Jim Highsmith, Ken\nSchwaber, Ron Jeffries, Mary Poppendieck, Rebecca Wirfs-Brock and many more.\nBob Martin and Brian Marick will be giving a keynote presentation.  Our fellows\nthis year are Tim Lister, Ward Cunningham and Kent Beck.\n\nFor conference agenda, session descriptions and on-line registration go to\nwww.agile2005.org\n\nWe are also putting out a call for student volunteers that would like to work at\nthe conference.\n\nCall for Student Volunteers\n\nThe local organizing committee is seeking student volunteers to assist with a\nmyriad of tasks to optimize the attendees&#39; experiences at the conference. None\nof these tasks are difficult, but all are important and critical to the success\nof the conference. Volunteering is a great way to meet other students, industry\nrepresentatives, and probably some of your favorite authors.\n\nAny student registered in a full-time undergraduate or graduate program for 2005\nmay become a student volunteer for Agile2005. You must be willing to commit to\nvolunteering to work 4 conference sessions (~16-20 hours) during the conference\nbetween July 24-29.  In return for participating as a volunteer, you will\nreceive daily access to choice conference sessions, free food, fun parties and\ninvaluable exposure to key industry leaders. You will be responsible for\nsupplying your own transportation, lodging, and other incidental costs. However,\nit may be possible to obtain support through other sources such as your\ndepartment.\n\nIf interested, please apply by sending the volunteer form\n(http://www.agileunited.org/volunteers/volunteer_form.pdf) via email to the\nvolunteer coordinator at volunteers@... with your name, educational\ninstitution, and whether or not you have volunteered at either XPAU or ADC in\npast years. If your application is accepted, your conference registration fee\nwill be waived.\n\n\n\n\n",
