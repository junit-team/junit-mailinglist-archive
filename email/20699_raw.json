I made some other smaller changes to remove\nduplication and communicate intent better as well.\n\nCheers\nDaniel\n\n\n\nOn Thu, 2008-06-19 at 08:08 -0700, Kent Beck wrote:\n&gt; Nat,\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m glad the new format worked better for you. BlockJUnit4TestRunner\n&gt; and its\n&gt; supporting cast are intended to be published in the next release.\n&gt; However,\n&gt; they are new enough that we wanted to verify their efficacy and give\n&gt; ourselves a chance to refine them before many people used them.\n&gt; \n&gt; Point well taken on the redundancy of deprecation and moving the\n&gt; classes.\n&gt; We&#39;ll move them back before releasing. We will compile the final\n&gt; release\n&gt; with Java 5 as well.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you very much for the feedback.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Kent Beck\n&gt; Three Rivers Institute\n&gt; \n&gt; _____ \n&gt; \n&gt; From: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf\n&gt; Of\n&gt; nat_pryce\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, June 19, 2008 3:16 AM\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: [junit] Re: 4.5 release candidate\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve ported the jMock runner over to the new structure. Here are some\n&gt; comments on the experience.\n&gt; \n&gt; I extended BlockJUnit4ClassRunner and override the invoke(...) method\n&gt; to verify the mock objects after the test has run, but before\n&gt; tear-down.\n&gt; \n&gt; This way reduces the amount of code in the custom runner. I also\n&gt; didn&#39;t have to duplicate existing functionality because the invoke\n&gt; method let me hook in at the right point.\n&gt; \n&gt; However, I still had to use classes in the org.junit.internal package,\n&gt; which feels wrong. Have I missed the right way of doing this?\n&gt; \n&gt; Other niggles...\n&gt; \n&gt; - The classes are compiled for Java 6 only, but only seem to need\n&gt; language features from 5 and above. Can the release be compiled for\n&gt; Java 5?\n&gt; \n&gt; - The JUnit 4.4 classes have been deprecated *and* moved to another\n&gt; package, which breaks any code that used them. There&#39;s no point in\n&gt; doing both. Either break backward compatability or keep backward\n&gt; compatability and deprecate the classes. I&#39;d prefer the latter, since\n&gt; it will allow me to do a jMock with new features supporting both JUnit\n&gt; 4.4 and 4.5 and then release a version that brings support forward to\n&gt; 4.5 onwards.\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; --Nat.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In junit@yahoogroups. &lt;mailto:junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt; com, &quot;Nat\n&gt; Pryce&quot;\n&gt; &lt;nat.pryce@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; JUnit 4.5 breaks jMock 2 because the TestMethod class has been moved\n&gt; &gt; to a different package.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; It&#39;s our fault for subclassing JUnit4ClassRunner, but it would be\n&gt; nice\n&gt; &gt; if JUnit4ClassRunner did not change at all in this release.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --Nat\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 2008/6/16 Kent Beck &lt;kentb@...&gt;:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; All,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Following our discussions last week, we have incorporated the old\n&gt; &gt; &gt; JUnit4ClassRunner into 4.5. (The new runner is called\n&gt; BlockJUnit4ClassRunner\n&gt; &gt; &gt; because it is organized as a &quot;block&quot; of &quot;statements&quot; instead of\n&gt; nested\n&gt; &gt; &gt; procedures). Those of you who have written custom runners, we&#39;d\n&gt; appreciate\n&gt; &gt; &gt; it if you could try out the release candidate to make sure it\n&gt; supports your\n&gt; &gt; &gt; existing runners.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Next up, release notes and then out the door!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Whew!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Kent Beck\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Three Rivers Institute\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n\n\n",
