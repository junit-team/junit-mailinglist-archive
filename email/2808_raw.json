Having this setup run for each test method does not slow my\n&gt; &gt; testcases down appreciably. It doesn&#39;t matter to the testcases where the\n&gt; &gt; Logger actually sends its output to- just that there is something there to\n&gt; &gt; accept events. I have a LoggerTestCase which performs this setup for me\n&gt; &gt; and I just don&#39;t worry about it.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The issue is similar with config files. Most testcases don&#39;t care where\n&gt; &gt; the configuration data comes from. I just create a Map as a fixture which\n&gt; &gt; contains exactly what is needed for particular testcases. My code doesn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; care what mechanism was used to populate the Map or what 10 gazillion\n&gt; &gt; other values might be available. The actual process of interpreting the\n&gt; &gt; config files or database or whatever is in a separate package and\n&gt; &gt; independently tested.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I think the design issue is making your classes much less dependent on the\n&gt; &gt; global state. Singletons are just one aspect of that. If these components\n&gt; &gt; are hidden behind nice interfaces, then you have a lot of freedom to\n&gt; &gt; decide just how much initialization is needed and can dumnmy out a lot of\n&gt; &gt; extra complexity.\n&gt; \n&gt; The thing to reiterate is that we are testing Components that live in a\n&gt; specific environment, and we must make sure they play nice in that environment.\n&gt; This makes sure that changes to the environment don&#39;t break the Components,\n&gt; and vice versa.  You can&#39;t test that with dummy stuff.\n&gt; \n&gt; Not all our testcases use this heavy process--Only the testcases that test\n&gt; Components.  We have a lot of helper classes that we test individually--without\n&gt; the extra bulk.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sometime during the test cycle we need to perform the environment tests, so\n&gt; I would rather do it with JUnit than with a production system ;).\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; RMI *is* an issue and is one of the places I have had significant problems\n&gt; &gt; with per-testcase fixtures. This and other testing issues led to me\n&gt; &gt; dramatically reducing my use of RMI.\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t typically use RMI in most cases, however we do have a component that\n&gt; exposes an RMI interface, so we need to test it.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
