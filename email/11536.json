Instead we should learn to accept something, in all of its flaws, as &quot;just good enough&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis email brought to you by the letter &#39;K&#39; and the number &#39;3&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nChip<br/>\n-----<br/>\n&quot;The reason the mainstream is thought of as a stream is because it&#39;s so shallow&quot; --George Carlin<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: J.

Sure, you can rely on<br/>\n&gt; everyone to implement workarounds or their own fixes (e.g.<br/>\n&gt; testrunners), but what&#39;s the point?
