Is that your frequent experience? If so, I agree<br/>\n&gt; that excludable categories would be the way to do it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No, I never really run all the methods in the excluded groups, most of the<br/>\ntime, their purpose is just to be excluded.  When I want to start fixing the<br/>\nbroken tests, I look at all the tests in that group and I take them out of<br/>\nit one by one as I fix them.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut group exclusion has other uses, such as &quot;running all the tests except<br/>\nthe slow ones&quot;, &quot;excluding the ui tests&quot;, &quot;excluding the Linux tests&quot;,<br/>\netc...<br/>\n<br/>\nAdmittedly, this is more on the integration/functional than on the unit test<br/>\nside, so you might consider these out of scope for JUnit.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; In my frequent experience, I tend to never run all the tests in the<br/>\n&gt; &quot;broken&quot; set: I enable them one by one, and fix them, when I can, so<br/>\n&gt; @Ignore works fine for me.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s also my experience for the Broken category.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n***Cédric<br/>\n*<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
