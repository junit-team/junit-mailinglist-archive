To improve my \n&gt; development skills and my=\r\n JUnit skills, I am writing some \n&gt; JUnit tests.  Today, I found that the d=\r\neveloper had \n&gt; implemented System.exit(n) throughout the application \n&gt; wh=\r\nenever there was a trapped exception.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now, the requirements call for t=\r\nhe application to return some \n&gt; exit code telling any downstream processes=\r\n whether this \n&gt; application was 100% successful with no warnings (rc=3D0),=\r\n 100% \n&gt; successful with warnings (rc=3D4), not successful at all \n&gt; (rc=3D=\r\n8).  However, the only java mechanism for reporting \n&gt; return codes is Syst=\r\nem.exit(n), based on my use of Google.\n&gt; \n&gt; My JUnit dilemma then, is that =\r\nSystem.exit(n) gives the \n&gt; required application behavior but doesn&#39;t seem =\r\nto be good for \n&gt; running JUnit tests from a test suite since System.exit(n=\r\n) \n&gt; ends the JVM.\n&gt; \n&gt; Does anyone have any insights they can share?  Sinc=\r\ne this is \n&gt; my first post to this forum, I&#39;m happy to Google some more if =\r\n\n&gt; you&#39;ll only give me some keyword hint(s) beyond what I&#39;ve \n&gt; already tri=\r\ned:  &quot;java exit code&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks!\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo!
