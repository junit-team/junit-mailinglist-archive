    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1478065878\">I have a situation similar to that in recipe 4.20 of the Java Extreme<br/>\nProgramming Cookbook by O&#39;Reilly.  This is a way to run a single test with a<br/>\nsingle test method multiple times with different arguments being passed to the<br/>\ntest method for each iteration.<br/>\n<br/>\nI assume that if I looked at the formater output from a test like this I would<br/>\nsee the same test name / test method name repeated once for each iteration.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile I have seen the API javadoc on the setName() method, I do not understand<br/>\nit, nor do I know if it would affect the formatter output.  I would _really_<br/>\nlike to read in the name  I want for a test along with the test data (in the<br/>\none-time test suite setup() I think), and have a way to dynamically set the<br/>\nmethod name (or test name), so I would see a useful list of tests in the<br/>\nformatter output.  I _could_ print the testname read in with the argumens to<br/>\nSysout, but that is so scruffy, and the versions of junit (3.8.1) and ant<br/>\n(1.5.3) I use, do not seem to display the sysout output in the junitreport html<br/>\npages.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAny hints or suggestions welcome!<br/>\n-- <br/>\nTom Porter                                       <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:txporter@...\">txporter@...</a><br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&quot;On two occasions I have been asked [by members of Parliament], <br/>\n&#39;Pray, Mr. Babbage, if you put into the machine wrong figures, will <br/>\nthe right answers come out?&#39;  I am not able rightly to apprehend the <br/>\nkind of confusion of ideas that could provoke such a question.&quot;</div>",
