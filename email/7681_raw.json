In that case, its enough to know \nthat your code has called the database appropriately.  You don&#39;t need to \ncare about what&#39;s in the database.  So you use a Mock Database.  This \nallows you to *quickly* change your code and make sure it still works \nwell with a database.\n\n+ &quot;Functional&quot; tests test the workings of the full system.  Several \ntimes, the &quot;Functional&quot; test can be exactly the same as the &quot;Unit&quot; test, \nthough using the real implementation rather than the Mock \nimplementation.  This is a pattern I&#39;ve used on occassion.\n\nMy typical pattern for an enhancement is:\n\n+ Unit test the enhancement, Mock-ing as needed.\n+ Functional test the enhanced system.\n\nIf I *HAD* to choose between the two, I&#39;d choose &quot;Unit&quot; tests.\n\nWhy?\n\n+ With only Functional tests, it is much harder to isolate where the \nproblem is.  Its also very hard to describe a precise enough functional \ntest to isolate the bug in question and avoid regression issues.\n+ Performance overhead: It can take time to initialize a database (or \nHttpConnection or whatever).  So if you can use a Mock, you can reduce \nthe runtime for non-db specific tests.  In some cases, Compilation can \nbe much faster if you don&#39;t have to drag in the database-specific \nimplementation java files either.\n+ Often, a complete and accurate set of Unit tests will mean functional \ntests succeed.  Its unusual (though *certainly* not unheard of) for our \nFunctional tests to fail after all of the Unit tests succeed.  So Unit \ntests can provide a sort-of-incomplete Functional test.\n\nNOTE: This is NOT to say I&#39;d eliminate functional tests; they do provide \nvalue and find bugs and I&#39;d *STRONGLY* encourage using them.  I&#39;m merely \nsaying that if I *HAD* to choose....\n\n-- \nPC\n\nPaul Christmann\nPrior Artisans, LLC\nmailto:paul@...\n504-587-9072\n\n\n\n",
