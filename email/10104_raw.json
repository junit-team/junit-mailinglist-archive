I meant in your \nfailing test, before and after the invocation of the Class Under Test. \nHowever, use whatever works - and the assert approach may not work at all.\n\nAlso, I&#39;ll mention another idea, although it may be anathema to this \nlist.  If you can somehow DETECT the failure, put a breakpoint in your \napplication (System.in or something to that effect), and then fire up \nyour debugger and inspect the state of everything.\n\nI know that many people on this list (and Dave Astel&#39;s in his fine book) \nsay you shouldn&#39;t need the debugger if you TDD intensively enough.  I \nmyself am unfortunately not to that level yet, and I often find it \nuseful to fire up the debugger.\n\nWhatever approach you use, I think the general idea is to gradually \nnarrow down the scope of the unknown failure until you can see what is \nthe root cause.\n\nHope this helps,\nChad\n\nDavid Corbin wrote:\n&gt; Prefectly reasonable suggestion.  I&#39;ll give it a try. For some reason, I \n&gt; don&#39;t think of asserts outside my tests.  (I&#39;m don&#39;t like the clutter).\n&gt; Chad Woolley wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;Probably not the advice you want, but have you tried to use asserts to \n&gt;&gt;&gt;get more info?  Whatever the failure is, keep adding asserts about \n&gt;&gt;&gt;anything you can think of regarding the expected state of the app and \n&gt;&gt;&gt;objects under test.  Even (especially?) add ones for things you may \n&gt;&gt;&gt;think are obviously working correctly.  This may give you some clues to \n&gt;&gt;&gt;the problem.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;David Corbin wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;  \n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I&#39;ve got one tests which fails sporadically, and I cannot figure out any \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;reason for it to be non-deterministic in MY code.  I&#39;ve added some \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;logging statements, but It&#39;s hard to get to fail.\n\n\n\n",
