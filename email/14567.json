Use a code coverage tool to determine whether the method is<br/>\nalready being adequately covered by tests against the existing public<br/>\nmethods of the class. If so, stop worrying. You&#39;re done.<br/>\n    <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://java-source.net/open-source/code-coverage\">http://java-source.net/open-source/code-coverage</a><br/>\n<br/>\n2. If test coverage is inadequate, determine whether unit tests<br/>\nagainst the existing public methods can be added. Do it. Return to<br/>\nstep 1.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Determine whether Extract Class should be used to split the<br/>\nresponsibilities of the class into two or more abstractions. If so,<br/>\nrefactor and write unit tests for the public methods of the new<br/>\nclasses. Return to step 1.<br/>\n<br/>\n4. Delete the code (OK! OK! -- just set the current implementation<br/>\naside) and reimplement the class using the existing unit tests.<br/>\nComment out all but one test and get to green. Do the simplest thing<br/>\nthat works. Only write code that is actually required to satisfy the<br/>\ntest. Refactor aggressively. Repeat.<br/>\n<br/>\nThoughts?<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards,<br/>\nJim</div>",
