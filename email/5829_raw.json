Other higher level APIs are built on the high level APIs.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have written unit tests for each of these APIs.\n&gt; \n&gt; These unit tests can be run in any sequence, however: I&#39;d like to specify\n&gt; that the unit tests for the lower level APIs should be run first.\n&gt; When these tests pass, the higher level APIs can be tested, having some\n&gt; confidence that the lower level works.\n&gt; \n&gt; The reason is that when an error occurs in a low level API, it&#39;s easier to\n&gt; diagnose when it occurs in the unit test for the lower level API, rather\n&gt; than as a result of the higher level API calling the low level API.\n&gt; \n&gt; When I add tests to a TestSuite using one of the addXXX() methods, is the\n&gt; sequence of adding the tests the same sequence if which the tests are run?\n&gt; \n&gt; If not, how can specify that a subset of all tests &#39;should&#39; be run in some\n&gt; sequence? (Note: not *must*, the unit tests can still be run in *any*\n&gt; sequence, but I&#39;d like the stuff that tests the low level parts of the code\n&gt; to run first)\n&gt; \n&gt; If TestSuite does not respect the sequence of the addXXX() calls for the\n&gt; running of the tests, can I implements this by extending TestSuite?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks in advance for any comments on this!
