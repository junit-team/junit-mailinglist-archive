During development, run just the specific test suite on the<br/>\n    code we were working on. (This took a few seconds.)<br/>\n<br/>\n    2. Before commit, run all unit tests. (This took 20-30 seconds.)<br/>\n<br/>\n    3. Before commit, decide which, if any, functional tests are likely<br/>\n    to be important to run, and run those. (This took 0-3 minutes.)<br/>\n<br/>\n    4. Before commit, if really worried, or the changes are widespread,<br/>\n    or whatever, do a full test run. (10 minutes)<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;d ocassionally get checkins, especially by the junior developers,<br/>\nthat broke stuff that they hadn&#39;t run the test for, but it was not that<br/>\ncommon an occurance, and it was caught pretty quickly, since pretty much<br/>\neverybody was doing a few full test runs per day, anyway. It was a habit<br/>\nto do an update and kick off a full test run before lunch or a coffee<br/>\nbreak.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo we were already using an informal level system, as you can see.<br/>\nWhether it&#39;s worth the bother of formalizing this, I don&#39;t know; I<br/>\nconsider it an important part of developer training to learn how to do<br/>\nanalysis of what tests should be run, which means that I would prefer<br/>\nthat all developers are doing this themselves on a continuous basis,<br/>\neven at the expense of having to deal with the ocassional mistake.<br/>\nThat&#39;s the price of learning, after all.<br/>\n<br/>\ncjs<br/>\n-- <br/>\nCurt Sampson  &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cjs@...\">cjs@...</a>&gt;   +81 90 7737 2974   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.NetBSD.org\">http://www.NetBSD.org</a><br/>\n    Don&#39;t you know, in this new Dark Age, we&#39;re all light.  --XTC</div>",
