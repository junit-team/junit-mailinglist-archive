This is the second time that you\n&gt;have\n&gt;d=\r\nistorted what we have written.\n&gt;\n&gt;J.B. you&#39;ve said this to me more than onc=\r\ne. Hopefully it is clear that I am\n&gt;trying, but there is a lot to read & mi=\r\nstakes will be made.\n\nI&#39;m not telling you do be perfect; I&#39;m asking you to =\r\ntake your time and be sure of what you read.\n\n&gt; I feel you&#39;ve\n&gt;distorted wh=\r\nat I&#39;ve said a number of times, I think it is an unfortunate\n&gt;aspect of com=\r\nmunication, on both our parts. \n\nI have not claimed that you said something=\r\n that you did not say. You have done that to me.\n\n&gt;Hopefully with us both t=\r\nrying\n&gt;we\n&gt;are getting past that.\n\nI&#39;m still here.\n\n&gt;&gt;      Your idea is no=\r\nt unwelcome. I have stated -- a few times -- that\n&gt;what you\n&gt;propose (the a=\r\nbility to\n&gt;&gt;      manage dependencies of the sort you describe) is a good i=\r\ndea and\n&gt;would\n&gt;likely be welcome to others. All &gt;      I have said is that=\r\n I do not\n&gt;believe it\n&gt;belongs at the core of JUnit.\n&gt;\n&gt;You never communica=\r\nted that to me.\n\nDo I really have to go back and quote myself again? Come o=\r\nn.\n\n&gt; Your e-mails made me think otherwise.\n&gt;Comments like:\n&gt;\n&gt;      &quot;Get t=\r\nhis straight: TEST CASE DEPENDENCY IS EVIL.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;.... kinda made me think ot=\r\nherwise.\n\nThat was before I understood what you meant by &quot;dependency&quot;. Once=\r\n we clarified that, I kept saying, &quot;Yes, yes; this is good, but it just doe=\r\nsn&#39;t belong in the framework.&quot;\n\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;      As for hoping that the JUnit team=\r\n will assist you, I guess you\n&gt;don&#39;t know\n&gt;the JUnit team very well. Kent &gt;=\r\n      and Erich are nice folks, but they\n&gt;are not\n&gt;active contributors to J=\r\nUnit these days. Just look at the gulfs &gt;      in\n&gt;time\n&gt;between releases t=\r\no convince yourself. Kent and Erich are not going to jump\n&gt;on board and hel=\r\np\n&gt;&gt;      you with this. They don&#39;t have the time or energy. The real\n&gt;acti=\r\nvity is in\n&gt;add-on projects like\n&gt;&gt;      JUnit-addons.\n&gt;\n&gt;Don&#39;t know them? =\r\nNever heard of them, sorry and all. That is no insult, and\n&gt;no measure of m=\r\ny gratitude for what they&#39;ve produced and how I and the\n&gt;community have ben=\r\nefited from their work. I also happen to have always been\n&gt;impressed w/ the=\r\n internals/design concepts in junit. That all said, none of\n&gt;this is releva=\r\nnt .... I wasn&#39;t talking to them, I was talking to this list.\n\nThey are the=\r\n JUnit team; not us. I think it&#39;s entirely relevant. We do not build JUnit;=\r\n they do.\n\nYou wrote: There are many reason why software projects fail, and=\r\n I\n&gt;don&#39;t need to start one that appears so unwelcomed by the development t=\r\neam\n&gt;for the product (that I like/use so much) that I was hoping to assist =\r\n w/\n&gt;&quot;my little epiphany&quot;.\n\nThe development team for the product is Kent an=\r\nd Erich; not the rest of us.\n\n&gt;OSS is (IMHO) a facet of the current communi=\r\nty. I don&#39;t want help, I wanted\n&gt;to share/discuss a thought. If at the end =\r\nof the day I write some code,\n&gt;then\n&gt;great, but I feel the idea needs bette=\r\nr pressure testing & don&#39;t wish to\n&gt;rush to code.\n\nBut you appeared to conc=\r\nlude that we are closed-minded based on the fact that we don&#39;t think your p=\r\nroposal belongs in the framework. Did you allow for the possiblity that we =\r\nconsidered your proposal within the context of our collective experience wi=\r\nth JUnit and other JUnit-related projects and our judgment simply led us to=\r\n the decision that your proposal does not belong in the framework?\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;  =\r\n    &lt;snip/&gt;\n&gt;&gt;      A good solution to your problem is the second: a custom=\r\n test runner\n&gt;with a\n&gt;dependency graph collector/analyzer.\n&gt;\n&gt;Ok, so have w=\r\ne moved off &quot;I can do it with suites&quot;. I agree, a runner is\n&gt;also needed. I=\r\n also think I need a way (on the TestCase) to express\n&gt;dependency. But, if =\r\nI write collector plus runner and add to testcase, how\n&gt;much of the framewo=\r\nrk have I replicated? How much benefited in my\n&gt;environment of ant and ecli=\r\npse? Not much. I also don&#39;t want to take the ant\n&gt;route and do an effective=\r\n re-write.\n\nYou have replicated none of the framework; you have built on to=\r\np of the framework. I don&#39;t know why you don&#39;t see this.\n\nYou extend (not r=\r\newrite) TestCase. You provide an extra implementation of TestListener. You =\r\nextend BaseTestRunner or use JUnit-addons&#39; Test Runner. I admit that sortin=\r\ng the dependency graph is a tough one: I don&#39;t know what to d there.\n\n&gt;&gt;   =\r\n   Excuse me: did you expect that we would suspend our lives and help\n&gt;you\n=\r\n&gt;write what you need?\n&gt;\n&gt;Actually, yes. Why not? Folks hack into junit out =\r\nof love for it, out of a\n&gt;desire to improve it. If something is a good idea=\r\n, why not?\n\nI want to clarify your answer: you *expect* us to do this? Are =\r\nyou sure you know what you&#39;re saying here?\n\n&gt;      &gt; That&#39;s not how open so=\r\nurce works.\n&gt;\n&gt;Actually, I feel it is. Convince the development team it is =\r\na good idea,\n&gt;and\n&gt;important, and they (closer to the implementation) are m=\r\nore than likely to\n&gt;do the work, and should &#39;cos they know the bigger pictu=\r\nre. Well, that is\n&gt;how\n&gt;I feel if folks come to me for something.\n\nIt&#39;s a f=\r\nine idea; it does not belong in the framework. No convincing required.\n\nWha=\r\nt is the difference between your view of open source and the student who is=\r\n too lazy to do his own homework and complains that others do not volunteer=\r\n to do it for him? Serious question.\n\n&gt;      &gt; I didn&#39;t see you handing out=\r\n invitations; but rather asking, &quot;Why\n&gt;don&#39;t\n&gt;you\n&gt;      &gt;      people add =\r\nthis to JUnit?&quot; That we don&#39;t need, thanks.\n&gt;\n&gt;Your interpretation, not min=\r\ne. I said -- is it a good thing for junit, I\n&gt;never said I&#39;d not try to hel=\r\np write it.\n\nOK. You asked, &quot;Is it a good thing for JUnit?&quot;\n\nMy answer (onc=\r\ne again): it sounds like a valuable tool; it is not a good candidate to dis=\r\nrupt the framework for, since (except for sorting the dependency graph) it =\r\nis easy to implement without changing JUnit.\n\nIt sounds to me like your bee=\r\nf is with Ant and Eclipse and not JUnit: their particular test runner imple=\r\nmentations stop you from integrating your idea with the environment you wan=\r\nt to use. So change the tools.\n\nOne does not change a framework to support =\r\nlimited tools. One expands the tools.\n\n&gt;      &gt;Yes, I know, I&#39;ve written fo=\r\nr both. I&#39;m hardly going to try to\n&gt;replicate\n&gt;      &gt; all the work for bot=\r\nh plugins just to try to get this point over.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;      Then I guess you do=\r\nn&#39;t need it that badly.\n&gt;\n&gt;Correct, but is that a measure of the idea, or t=\r\nhe hurdle put in it&#39;s way?\n\nI think you have the wrong picture of the size =\r\nof the hurdle in the way. The way I see it, except for sorting the dependen=\r\ncy graph, this doesn&#39;t require more than about 50 lines of code. Perhaps th=\r\nere is some open source topographical sort package we can add on.\n\n&gt;&gt;      =\r\nYou conclude that the community of developers is not open to\n&gt;accepting a\n&gt;=\r\ncore change.\n&gt;&gt;       The alternate conclusion is that the community of dev=\r\nelopers does\n&gt;not\n&gt;believe your particular proposed\n&gt;&gt;      change is a goo=\r\nd idea.\n&gt;&gt;      On what basis did you choose your conclusion over the alter=\r\nnative?\n&gt;\n&gt;From the fact that I only heard your voice, and (perhaps incorre=\r\nctly, it\n&gt;was\n&gt;my first posting) I felt that maybe you spoke for the commun=\r\nity.\n\nI speak for me. You choose to believe that or you don&#39;t. I don&#39;t much=\r\n care either way, but if you continue to posit that I speak for others, the=\r\nn you will continue under an unnecessary misapprehension.\n\nBy the way, othe=\r\nrs have chimed in and agreed that the framework need not be disrupted. I do=\r\nn&#39;t care that they agree with me from an ego perspective; but I would hope =\r\nyou realize that it&#39;s not just me in the discussion anymore.\n\n&gt;Nobody\n&gt;else=\r\n\n&gt;was doing so back then. For all I knew you could&#39;ve been &quot;the original\n&gt;a=\r\nuthor&quot;. Whatever, the ideas presented on the mailing list give newbies\n&gt;lik=\r\ne\n&gt;me feeling for the community. A community is what it posts...\n\nIf you&#39;re=\r\n going to conclude about a community from one person&#39;s writing, then you&#39;re=\r\n going to fool yourself regularly.\n\n&gt;&gt;      When you are ready to accept th=\r\ne possibility that we merely\n&gt;disagree with\n&gt;you, rather than are\n&gt;&gt;      n=\r\nefariously blocking your proposal, please come back and discuss\n&gt;this with\n=\r\n&gt;us again.\n&gt;\n&gt;Nice try, but wrong. I am often wrong, numerous times -- and =\r\nmore than I am\n&gt;right. Honestly, I love it when somebody proves me wrong on=\r\n something, I\n&gt;feel I&#39;ve learned something. But, I can&#39;t quit a discussion =\r\nbecause it\n&gt;becomes an argument, I couldn&#39;t let this idea die because of di=\r\nstractions.\n&gt;It didn&#39;t get a fair hearing (back then) and I&#39;m glad the rest=\r\n of the list\n&gt;has stepped in and opened things up. I was ready to quit, but=\r\n now am\n&gt;learning more & benefiting from the comments.\n\nOK, so we&#39;re past &quot;=\r\nyou people aren&#39;t listening to me&quot; and into &quot;you people just don&#39;t agree wi=\r\nth me&quot;. Good. When we do get to &quot;let&#39;s just try to do this&quot;?\n\nTake care.\n\nJ=\r\n. B.
