In an old test-setup where we used <br/>\nmainframe transactions from a RS6000 websphere setup, the mainframe <br/>\ntransaction we called would fail every 25/30 transactions. When we <br/>\n*finally* reported this to the mainframe guys, they found a bug in their <br/>\nsoftware that caused this. From then on, we were on the right track to <br/>\n100% test success.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe also created from flipover charts a progression of our testresults. <br/>\nEach time the mainframe connection failed, our score dropped to 25% <br/>\nsuccess or so. If this is a pattern for more than 2 weeks, something has <br/>\nto be done.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the database is giving you so much trouble, and you can&#39;t fix the <br/>\nsetup because the database is out of your reach, setup a local database, <br/>\nor use HSQL as development database.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe tests tell what is wrong, and in my opinion it is not JUnit. ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nMartijn Dashorst</div>",
