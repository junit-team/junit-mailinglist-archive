I&#39;ve tended to use these methods when I want to do something<br/>\nexpensive (File I/O etc.). While I know I should avoid expensive operations<br/>\nin my test cases sometimes they are very useful. So is there are a standard<br/>\nidiom for doing fixture setup? Do I resort to statics?<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW I know and like Cedric&#39;s TestNG � however our organisation is sold on<br/>\nJUnit for now and I&#39;m making enough waves on the process front.<br/>\nFinally, yes I have googled the obvious variations on this question.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\nMark Levison<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
