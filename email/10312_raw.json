That can give you a lot better\n&gt; &gt; functional coverage if you app uses Javascript.  I&#39;m pretty sure\n&gt; &gt; HTTPUnit doesn&#39;t offer this (JWebUnit is build on HTTPUnit, I believe).\n\nI checked out the JWebUnit Javadoc, but did not see any special functionality to support javascript events?(http://jwebunit.sourceforge.net/)\nThe doc also does not mention anything, Am I missing anything?\n\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;   Does HTMLUnit or any other free tool offer this?\n&gt;\n&gt; Ok, a bit of an old message to be replying to, but HttpUnit does let you\n&gt; test JavaScript, it seems; you just need to be using the Rhino classes\n&gt; (the js.jar file) that come with it.\n&gt;\n&gt; I should also mention a true unit-testing framework for servlets that I\n&gt; wrote: servtest (http://servtest.sourceforge.net/). This is essentially\n&gt; a small servlet container to which you give a servlet, set up a request,\n&gt; and ask the container to execute the servlet. At the end you can check\n&gt; what the servlet did. I find this to be a lot faster for initial testing\n&gt; of servlets than very heavyweight functional-testing systems like HttpUnit.\n&gt;\n&gt; Unfortunately, I&#39;ve not had time to write up a detailed tutorial on how\n&gt; to use it, which is probably going to halt most people in their tracks.\n&gt; I&#39;ll have to get to that one day....\n&gt;\n&gt; cjs\n&gt; --\n&gt; Curt Sampson  &lt;cjs@...&gt;   +81 90 7737 2974   http://www.NetBSD.org\n&gt;     Don&#39;t you know, in this new Dark Age, we&#39;re all light.  --XTC\n&gt;\n&gt;                                                                                                                                                                  &lt;jobs@...&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
