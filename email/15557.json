I worked with Kent and Erich on the <br/>\nparameterized support, so here&#39;s my utterly non-binding thoughts:<br/>\n<br/>\nIn general, I&#39;m a fan of the Kent and Erich&#39;s plan to keep JUnit 4.0 as <br/>\nsimple as possible, while still allowing impressive amounts of <br/>\nextension.  To that end, it would be great to have a third party work on <br/>\na souped-up parameterized test runner with features like you mention here.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wrote a separate runner a while back that parameterizes tests by <br/>\nmethod, but felt ambivalent about it--it was very different from how <br/>\nparameterized tests had been done in JUnit 3, and I hadn&#39;t really wanted <br/>\nit yet in my own development, so I wasn&#39;t sure I&#39;d gotten it &quot;right&quot;, <br/>\nand I didn&#39;t submit it to Kent.  However, you&#39;re not the first to <br/>\nrequest it.  In any case, do you really want to have parameters on both <br/>\nthe class and the methods?  That seems really complex.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;         // In actual code, these would probably be enums, in my<br/>\n&gt; experience -<br/>\n&gt;         // they would provide mechanisms for connecting to the<br/>\n&gt; appropriate database,<br/>\n&gt;         // setting it up and tearing it down etc.<br/>\n&gt;         public static String[] classParameters = {&quot;Oracle&quot;, &quot;SQL&quot;};<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Using an enum to contain the parameters is a cool idea.  Would it be <br/>\nmuch easier than<br/>\n@Parameters public static List&lt;DbType&gt; parameters() { return <br/>\nDbType.values() }?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;         @Test<br/>\n&gt;         @Parameters(strings={&quot;hello&quot;, &quot;there&quot;})<br/>\n&gt;         public void test3(String input)<br/>\n&gt;         {<br/>\n&gt;             assertEquals(input, input.toLowerCase());<br/>\n&gt;         }<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I like that a lot.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 2) Unless multiple parameters are required, a single array (rather than<br/>\n&gt; an array of arrays) causes less confusion. I know that the<br/>\n&gt; counter-argument to that is that having two forms, one for<br/>\n&gt; single-parameter tests/constructors and one for multi-parameter<br/>\n&gt; tests/constructors is ugly, but I personally believe that it&#39;s justified<br/>\n&gt; in this case.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I like your case here.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the rest of your features, I think they&#39;re cool.  I&#39;d like to see a <br/>\nrunner that did them, and play with it a while.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 5) One nasty problem: you need to construct instances of the test class<br/>\n&gt; just to count the test cases - and hope that the parameters you get back<br/>\n&gt; then is the same as the ones you get when you&#39;re ready to run the tests.<br/>\n&gt; (You could cache the results, of course...)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s a rough problem.  In general, I think that runners should avoid <br/>\nconstructing instances in order to count test cases.  Do you think it&#39;s <br/>\nworth it?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Anyway, the bottom line is that I can see *huge* benefits in this<br/>\n&gt; approach in quite a few of our existing test code. Does anyone have any<br/>\n&gt; major objections to the above, or shall I give it a whirl?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Absolutely give it a whirl.<br/>\n<br/>\n    David Saff</div>",
