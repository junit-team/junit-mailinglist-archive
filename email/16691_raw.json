I create and run the test like this: \n\nRequest r =3D Req=\r\nuest.method(OldStyleTestCase.class, &quot;testSomeMethod&quot;);\njcore.run(r);\n\nThe o=\r\nutcome is that all test methods are run, not just the one test\nmethod I spe=\r\ncified. I also tried using a custom filter, but the filter\nnever gets calle=\r\nd because the runner for this class is\norg.junit.internal.runners.OldTestCl=\r\nassRunner which does not implement\nFilter.\n\nDo I need to write my own runne=\r\nr to get this to work? Is there another\nwork around?\n\nThanks for any help.\n=\r\n\n/Shannon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
