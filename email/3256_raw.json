I then compiled TestTest \nand ProxyTestSuite using the provided jars and ran TestTest. My \nproblem is that I don&#39;t seem to be able to get testSharing() to \nshare. The initial value of sharing is false. Enter the first round \nof testSharing(), the assertion is confirmed and sharing is set to \ntrue. Enter the second testSharing(), the value is false again, as \nwould be expected with the plain vanilla JUnit.\n\nCan someone point me to the correct path?\n\nRegards,\nRichard\n\n\n",
