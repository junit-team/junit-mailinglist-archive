Those methods are naturally public, since<br/>\nthey are external behaviour.  This means that all methods called by<br/>\ntests are public.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs you refactor you will be creating private methods (as you extract<br/>\nmethods and so on).  These do not need to be explicitly tested, as the<br/>\nbahaviour of the class has not changed... just details of where the code<br/>\nresides.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo... tests drive the creation of public methods, refactoring drives the<br/>\ncreation of private methods.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are times when one of these private, created-due-to-refactoring<br/>\nmethods is useful to call from outside.  Then you make it public.  With<br/>\nTDD you will already have a test in place, when you realize that an<br/>\nexisting private method does what you need.<br/>\n<br/>\nSummary: You don&#39;t need to test private methods if you&#39;re doing TDD<br/>\nrigorously.<br/>\n<br/>\nDave<br/>\n-- <br/>\nDave Astels (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dave@...\">dave@...</a>)<br/>\n  Coauthor of &quot;A Practical Guide to XP&quot;<br/>\n  Editor of the Test-Driven Development Edition of The Coad Letter<br/>\n    (subscribe at www.thecoadletter.com)<br/>\n  Presenter at XP2002 (www.xp2002.org) of:<br/>\n    the &quot;XP For One&quot; tutorial & &quot;Refactoring with UML&quot; paper<br/>\nCEO & Master Software Craftsman, Saorsa Development Inc.<br/>\nwww.saorsa.com<br/>\n&quot;An Agile Software Studio&quot;</div>",
