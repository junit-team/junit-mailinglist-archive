Fact is, if your precondition fails or you <br/>\n&gt; get a NullPointerException, there&#39;s a bug in the client.  You can have <br/>\n&gt; checking enabled, or not, but checking is not error handling. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Then maybe we agree more than we think. If checking is not error <br/>\nhandling, then I accept that we don&#39;t need to handle the error. Indeed, <br/>\nin many cases we can&#39;t reasonably handle the error inside the method. <br/>\nHowever, I do think that it&#39;s important not to blindly accept a bad <br/>\nargument that violates a precondition and precede blindly ahead whatever <br/>\nhappens. It is important to fail fast (and in a controlled and <br/>\ndocumented way via an exception) rather than let the software corrupt <br/>\nitself. Martin Fowler has written extensively about this:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.martinfowler.com/ieeeSoftware/failFast.pdf\">http://www.martinfowler.com/ieeeSoftware/failFast.pdf</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The point <br/>\n&gt; of DbC is to build software robust enough so that you don&#39;t have to <br/>\n&gt; write error handling code at each level.  Relevant section is 11.6 <br/>\n&gt; &quot;Assertions are not an input checking mechanism.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s something very different. Meyer clearly means *user* input in <br/>\nthat section, and I agree with him on that. Assertions very much are an <br/>\nargument/parameter checking mechanism. I don&#39;t think we&#39;re talking here <br/>\nabout user input, just about how two different methods from two <br/>\ndifferent code bases communicate.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; And when you say &quot;It is my job to make sure my code works. I can&#39;t do <br/>\n&gt; that if the code that calls it violates my preconditions and class <br/>\n&gt; invariants.&quot;  Most of the time, that&#39;s trying to do too much.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Agreed. What I really should have said is something like, &quot;It&#39;s my job <br/>\nto make sure my code works, or signals an error at the earliest possible <br/>\nopportunity if it can&#39;t work due to precondition violation&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n﻿Elliotte Rusty Harold  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:elharo@...\">elharo@...</a><br/>\nJava I/O 2nd Edition Just Published!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafeaulait.org/books/javaio2/\">http://www.cafeaulait.org/books/javaio2/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596527500/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/\">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596527500/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/</a></div>",
