    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-278203004\">Hello,<br/>\n<br/>\nI have seen many discussions on testing J2EE related<br/>\ncode. I have looked at HttpUnit which is great for<br/>\ntesting the front end. I have looked at Cactus for<br/>\ntesting servlets. However I don&#39;t feel I need to test<br/>\nthe servlets directly as they are dynamically compiled<br/>\nvia the serving of JSP&#39;s. I have been using HttpUnit<br/>\nto test the JSP&#39;s. What I do want to do is test the<br/>\nEJB&#39;s in the Weblogic EJB container along with any<br/>\nclasses that make calls to EJB&#39;s. Obviously to get an<br/>\nEJB instance I need to be able to access or be inside<br/>\nan EJB container. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne approach I was thinking is to write some unit<br/>\ntests that would be available inside a weblogic<br/>\nserver. I could then either run the tests on startup<br/>\nof the server or write an admin type jsp to run the<br/>\ntests. The results could then be output the weblogic<br/>\nconsole or a jsp. <br/>\n<br/>\nHas anyone had to do something similar before. If so<br/>\nany helpfull comments would be most appreciated. In<br/>\naddition any code examples would also be a plus.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards<br/>\n<br/>\nDavid  <br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet personalized email addresses from Yahoo!
