But when the\ntests are run, the generated document shows that all these methods\npass (questionably good).  This gives a false sense that the code\nbeing tested is being tested, when it really isn&#39;t because the test\nbodies are empty.\n\nIs there a way to track the number of assertions that pass/fail\ninstead of the number of methods that are invoked in the test classes?\n This way the numbers reported (e.g., 122 tests run) would tend to\nimply better test coverage, or at least more actual tests executing,\nrather than lots of empty tests running.  (Yes, I know bad tests can\nbe written that skew the results, but we don&#39;t need to go into that\nnow.)\nThis way more the classes for which tests haven&#39;t yet been written,\nbut the skeleton is up and running, would show up in the report as 0\ntests run, rather than whatever number of test skeletons have been\ngenerated\nand may or may not be empty.\n\nThanks,\nSteve Kelem\n\n\n",
