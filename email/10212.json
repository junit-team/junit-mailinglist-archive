By which I mean they have no part in the JUnit TestCase life cycle or contractual relationship with the test runner.  They don&#39;t fire events and they don&#39;t get invoked via reflection like test*() methods do.  They&#39;re just methods for asserting boolean conditions.  As such, I think they can be useful in setUp() or tearDown() as long as they&#39;re used in the general assertion capability way that Jeff seems to be using them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess it would follow from my argument that if one is using JDK 1.4 APIs, one could just as well use the assert keyword where he&#39;s using JUnit assert() methods in setUp() and tearDown().  Eh?  Never thought of that before.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest,<br/>\nScott Stirling<br/>\nWorkscape, Inc.<br/>\n<br/>\n***********************************************************************<br/>\nThis message is intended only for the use of the intended recipient and<br/>\nmay contain information that is PRIVILEGED and/or CONFIDENTIAL.
