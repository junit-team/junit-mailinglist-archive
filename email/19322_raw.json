Do you mean write?\n\nWhy is the volume of test code a challenge? I&#39;d agree it is one if the \ncompiler chokes on it, but I don&#39;t see the connection of size of test \ncode vs size of production code you seem to imply.\n\nSame for effort -- why do you relate the effort on test code to the effort \non production code? Effort on test code pays back in less defects and \nclearer design and other things. Would you also complain about spending \nmore effort on e.g. design or documentation that on production code?\n\nWhat is the complexity in launching unit tests? If that is in fact \ncomplex, wouldn&#39;t that indicate a flawed build process?\n\nWhat are patterned objects?\n\nWhat are unique test maintenance points?\n\nWhy is it a good thing if the &quot;need for a shared understanding of \npatterned object implementation definitions&quot; (whatever that is) is \nincreased?\n\n\nSure one can reflectively gather all setters and getters and call them.\nHowever, what is really gained from that?\n\nAs you write, you may reach higher coverage. Sure, you may even find a \ndefect. However, I&#39;d be afraid this would lead to a false sense of \nsecurity. It&#39;s like testing that you can roll the windows in your car up \nand down and ignoring the engine.\n\nAlso, I cannot imagine how this should work for anything serious.\nMy tests often involve multiple objects, for example, I may want to set a \nCalender object in another object: someObject.setCalender(aCalender).\nHow do you create meaningful instances of the calender in this case?\nHow do you automatically create more complex objects where the \nconstructor may require yet other objects?\nWhat about setters that are not meant to be set easily, e.g., a file name \nmay only be set before the file is opened?\n\nAlso, only few of my objects usually have setters and getters, so I&#39;d not \neven bother downloading TestUtil. The getters and setters are certainly \ncovered in other tests anyway.\n\nLast but not least I don&#39;t see why you call this a pattern. It does not \nseem to share a lot with patterns as described by Gamma et al -- your AMT \ndoes not even involve code, besides naming conventions?\n\nSorry, I don&#39;t see how this &quot;pattern&quot; is useful at all.\n\nCheers,\n\nRobert\n\n",
