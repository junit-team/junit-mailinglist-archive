I agree with you that there \nare too many terms that mean similar things, but &quot;developer testing&quot; \nis what most people and companies out there seem to use to describe \nthe act of software developers getting seriously involved in test \ndevelopment.  Even in the Agile community, people like Brian Marick \n(one of the original authors of the Agile Manifesto) use &quot;developer \ntesting&quot;.\n\nRight or wrong, most people interpret &quot;programmer testing&quot; as the \ntesting *of* a programmer&#39;s skill (e.g. certification.)\n\nThere is also the issue that some &quot;software engineers&quot; want to be \nthough of as developers and not programmers.  What&#39;s the difference \nbetween a programmer and a developer?  I haven&#39;t seen a serious \ndefinition of the two, but below is a humorous attempt I read \nsomewhere (origins unknown):\n\n* Programmer: A biological machine designed to convert caffeine into \ncode.\n\n* Developer: A person who develops working systems by writing and \nusing software.\n\nUsing this definition, I guess all of us are sometimes programmers \nand sometimes developers :-).  Although, apparently, you can&#39;t be a \nprogrammer if you drink decaf.\n  \nIn general usage I hear and read &quot;unit testing&quot;, &quot;developer \ntesting&quot;, and &quot;programmer testing&quot; used quite interchangeably (and \nin that order of frequency).\n\n&gt;(What&#39;s a &quot;unit&quot; anyway?) \n\nThat&#39;s another challenge altogether :-), but that&#39;s the primary \nreason why I thought that &quot;developer testing&quot; was better than &quot;unit \ntesting.&quot;\n\nAlberto\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;J.

It sounds too much like Programmer \n&gt; Testing, which is already a well-known term in the Agile \ncommunity, and \n&gt; which includes more than just unit testing. (What&#39;s a &quot;unit&quot; \nanyway?) \n&gt; There are already too many terms that mean similar things. We \ndon&#39;t need \n&gt; more of them! (I wish we had fewer of them!)\n&gt; \n&gt; Still, I am intrigued by the work Agitar is doing. I would be \ninterested \n&gt; in evaluating Agitator on a future project, and I would write \nabout my \n&gt; experiences.\n&gt; -- \n&gt; J. B.
