I&#39;m really impressed with seriousness you approached to\n&gt; acceptance testing.\n&gt; \n&gt; On the other hand it seems that much work was involved to make this\n&gt; acceptance framework work fine.\n\nWell, I should say that the application sends one HTML file after\nlogging in and the rest is JavaScript working with the DOM - it&#39;s a RIA.\nIt&#39;s a first for me, a first for the client.\n\nI&#39;ve spent 40 hours to get the test agent and test conductor to work\nproperly. That&#39;s for the infrastructure and it&#39;s been running for 12\nmonths with one hickup regarding XML-RPC (had to change the http client\nfrom Sun&#39;s to some Apache variant). I don&#39;t think that&#39;s very much,\nconsidering the alternatives that were available by then.\n\nThe bash script that deploys/undeploys have had some love as well, since\nit pulls things off a maven repo (archiva) looking at metadata to get\nwhat&#39;s latest, ~8 hours.\n\n&gt; I would like to make our Selenium tests work automatically from CI\n&gt; server (linux server without X), as any JUnit test would work. This\n&gt; way our Product Owner (yes, we&#39;re Scrumming) could write all necessary\n&gt; acceptance tests instead of descriptive acceptance criteria.\n\nI&#39;d like to see that too, running browsers headless. :)\n(The test agents we use are setup on a VMware cluster, so the CI server\nnever launches anything requiring a GUI.)\n\nHTMLUnit&#39;s becoming more and more competent regarding JavaScript\n(framework) support. Crosscheck is interesting as well. \n\n&gt; CI is executing &quot;mvn clean install&quot; periodically and it would be great\n&gt; if we could automate this process.\n&gt; \n&gt; Any ideas?\n\nNot really. The Selenium tests takes ~4 minutes to run. A full build\n(compile, unit test, integration tests) takes about 5 minutes. We want\nshort feedback cycles and found it to be a good thing to separate the\nselenium test run since it takes a lot of time with little feedback\nwhile it runs (no early failure here).\n\n/ Fredrik\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
