Sounds\n&gt; &gt; weird...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ciao, Ilja\n&gt;\n&gt; Why?  I&#39;m not an EJB guy, but it seems like responsibility of an EJB\n&gt; thing is to present network accessible interface.\n\nBut an interface to *what*?\n\n&gt; Since good OO design\n&gt; avoids many responsibilities in a given class, this makes\n&gt; complete sense\n&gt; to me.  Plus it makes things much more flexible and easier to test.\n&gt; Just like I wouldn&#39;t have my GUI classes implement business logic.\n\nEJB is a distributed component modell. Why distributed? Mainly for\nreliability and scalability: As you don&#39;t care where a component\nactually resides, you can put work-intensive components on there own\ncluster, and one cluster can stand in for another one if it fails for\nsome reason.\n\nThere are two main types of EJBs: entity beans and session beans. Entity\nbeans are data classes, they are responsible for persistence. Session\nbeans are the &#39;working horses&#39;, in a typical J2EE application, here\nresides your business logic.\n\nciao, Ilja\n\n\n",
