What I want is to have things like a Description of\nthe test sui=\r\nte, which could be added to the JUnit test via something\nlike a metadata ta=\r\ng.  Then, when I run the tests and generate the\nresults into an XML file, i=\r\nt would add that description to the results\nfile.\n\n\nIs this possible?  I wo=\r\nuld like to add a few more fields than that but\nit&#39;s one example.  I&#39;d also=\r\n like to not have to create an\nimplementatin of TestCase since I already ha=\r\nve existing tests and\ninstead would just like to be able to add the new inf=\r\normation in some\nway, such as a metadata tag.\n\nThanks,\nShay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
