This is my first stab at this and I have not run it...\nOn 11/7/05, cliftonccraig &lt;cliftonccraig@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; Hello,\n&gt;\n&gt; This may sound like more of a novice question but I need to know what\n&gt; the best practice is for running all of my tests and ONLY my testable\n&gt; classes with the Ant Junit task. What I mean is this. I tried using\n&gt; the batchtest task which is severely limited. It only does a directory\n&gt; scan over my test source to pick up the test classes. The problem is\n&gt; sometimes I may include abstract classes under that umbrella for\n&gt; conveniece methods and they get picked up too. Also there is no\n&gt; garauntee that the source and class files will be one for one. (Eg.\n&gt; nested classes would go unnoticed as well as source files that\n&gt; don&#39;t/can&#39;t compile to a equivalent named class.) I would feel alot\n&gt; better if I could filter the .class files instead of the source and\n&gt; pull out only the classes that are TESTABLE. That is, classes that\n&gt; begin or end with &quot;Test&quot; and have at least one public no-arg method\n&gt; beginning with &quot;test&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; So I plugged in DirectorySuiteBuilder from the junit addons project\n&gt; and added some custom code to accomplish this. My custom code, a class\n&gt; named DirectoryScannerSuiteBuilder, is included below. The problem\n&gt; with that approach, while it is a lot more accurate, is that the\n&gt; junitreport task now lumps all tests under my custom\n&gt; DirectoryScannerSuiteBuilder class name without separating out the\n&gt; detail. So my question is what would the best approach be? Should I\n&gt; stop being anal and just go with the batchtest approach and stop\n&gt; including abstracts under the test source directory? (Incedentally\n&gt; that&#39;s what I&#39;m resoting to now.) Or is there a more elaborate\n&gt; solution sort of like a best of breed between the two approaches I&#39;ve\n&gt; tried so far?\n\n &lt;CLIP&gt;a bunch of code&lt;/CLIP&gt;\n\n ------------------------------\n&gt;\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n\n",
