Do you have some insights into that?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; About your Assurance/CPU point:  in my experience, CPU very quickly stops<br/>\n&gt; being the bottleneck for functional tests.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Network bandwidth, I/O throughput, environment setup and test data<br/>\n&gt; initialization or uninitialization are what takes most of the time of<br/>\n&gt; lengthy tests as your application grows.  And as I said before, test runs<br/>\n&gt; that take hours if not sometimes entire nights to run are pretty common in<br/>\n&gt; enterprise software.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Of course we all know that common != inevitable.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure I need JUnit to support common behavior. What I really want <br/>\nit to support is excellent behavior. Might just be me, of course.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers, Ilja</div>",
