Under section 6.6 &quot;Why do I get a\nNoClassDefFoun=\r\ndError when trying to test JUnit or run the samples?&quot;. Both of\nthem unfortu=\r\nnately point to documents which no longer exist :0(\n\nOn Mon, Sep 26, 2011 a=\r\nt 8:48 PM, lewismc2 &lt;lewis.mcgibbney@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; **\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi list,=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m embarking on a pretty monumental JUnit test writing journey as par=\r\nt of\n&gt; a larger vision of improving code integrity as well as expanding our=\r\n testing\n&gt; activities. Before I begin writing the tests I have been working=\r\n\n&gt; (frustratingly) on this particular Jira issue [1]. In summary, the issue=\r\n\n&gt; attempts to add the functionality to a script [2] that will enable us to=\r\n\n&gt; test individual test cases from the command line rather than have to run=\r\n\n&gt; every JUnit test case when we wish to review changes or review performan=\r\nce\n&gt; of new test cases. I am however not getting very far with setting the\n=\r\n&gt; correct environment variable and could do with some guidance. The patch\n&gt;=\r\n which I&#39;m trying to apply would allow us to run\n&gt;\n&gt; bin/nutch junit org.ap=\r\nache.nutch.testCase\n&gt;\n&gt; This would then run the specified test case class. =\r\nI&#39;m positive that my\n&gt; problem is the export classpath environment variable=\r\n which should point to\n&gt; the test case directory. I&#39;m just not able to add =\r\nthe class paths, therefore\n&gt; I get an exception and stack trace error (NoCl=\r\nassDef) whenever I try to run\n&gt; a test case.\n&gt;\n&gt; Finally, just to clarify, =\r\nI&#39;m using the TestRunner class to run the tests.\n&gt;\n&gt; Any help, guidance etc=\r\n would be greatly appreciated as it will enable me to\n&gt; progress with writi=\r\nng and fixing some 20-30 test classes. If I can provide\n&gt; any more informat=\r\nion please advise.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thank you in advance\n&gt;\n&gt; Lewis\n&gt;\n&gt; [1] https://issue=\r\ns.apache.org/jira/browse/NUTCH-672\n&gt; [2] https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/n=\r\nutch/trunk/src/bin/nutch\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n\n-- \n*Lewis*\n\n\n[Non-text portions of thi=\r\ns message have been removed]\n\n\n",
