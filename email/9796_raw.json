I&#39;ve created a series of tests using\n&gt; &gt; a fixture which look (in form) like the following:\n&gt; \n&gt; Jargon Alert: a fixture is what you make assertions about.  Usually\n&gt; the fixture is created in setUp() and tested in your testA(), testB(),\n&gt; etc.\n\nAh.. but in proper usage TestCase == fixture... so I have no argument\nwith his use of the word... assuming he&#39;s doing it &quot;right&quot; (i.e. his\nTestCase is maximally cohesive)\n\n&gt; &gt; Everything is working fine but now I&#39;ve added a new\n&gt; &gt; fixture and associated test cases which test a\n&gt; &gt; different aspect of the system - call this class\n&gt; &gt; &#39;TestAnotherThing.&#39;  I&#39;d like to find some way to\n&gt; &gt; launch swingui.TestRunner from a batch file and run\n&gt; &gt; all the test cases from both classes but I can&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; figure out how to make this happen.  I&#39;m sure it&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; possible so what am I missing?  Thanks in advance for\n&gt; &gt; any help anyone can offer!\n&gt; \n&gt; Short answer: try using Ant.  It allows you to specify tests using\n&gt; patterns, so that you can, for example, run all of the tests on your\n&gt; class path by writing\n\nBah!\n\nSure use Ant for your central builds, but it&#39;s useless overhead inside\nthe TDD cycle (if that&#39;s what you&#39;re doing.. if not then you should be).\n\nCreate a suite that contains the two (eventually more) TestCases.\n\nBTW, you don&#39;t need the suite method in the TestCase.  The framework\nuses reflection to collect the tests, assuming the signatures are right.\n\nYou shoudl be using Eclipse if you aren&#39;t already... the JUnit plugin\nmakes many things easier.. including creating/maintaining custom suites.\n\nDave\n\n\n\n",
