I&#39;ve grabbed XMLUnit for\n&gt; JUnit and have set up a basic XMLTestCase, however the biggest problem\n&gt; I have now is dealing with my files included by the XSL under test.\n&gt; \n&gt; So this question may be more about structuring development directories\n&gt; than actually using XMLUnit.\n&gt; \n&gt;  &gt;From my project&#39;s root in my development environment, I have my XSL\n&gt; files in this directory:\n&gt; \n&gt; ./web/xsl/html4/&lt;my XSL files here&gt;\n&gt; ./web/xsl/html4/include/&lt;common files I include in &#39;base&#39; XSL files&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Where . is the root of the project as checked out from my version\n&gt; control (other subdirectories besides /web are /src, /test, /lib,\n&gt; etc.)\n&gt; \n&gt; But my XSL include files are written to access the include directory\n&gt; assuming they are being executed from the web application context --\n&gt; that is, here&#39;s a sample include line:\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;xsl:include href=&quot;/WEB-INF/xsl/html4/includes/commonIncl.xsl&quot;/&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; When I run XMLUnit on my XSL file, the above line fails as the\n&gt; transformer can&#39;t find the resource\n&gt; file:/WEB-INF/xsl/html4/includes/commonIncl.xsl.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; How do you normally structure your build directories or handle this\n&gt; include problem when testing XSL files outside of the container?\n\nWhatever utility you&#39;re using to parse XML or transform it with XSL \nneeds to supply a &quot;current working directory&quot;. Set this in such a way -- \nhardcode it, if you have to -- to force the behavior you expect.\n\nI hope that points you in a good direction. Take care.\n-- \nJ. B.
