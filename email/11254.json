B. Rainsberger Sat, 19 Jun 2004 10:46:42 -0400<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; If the application uses the same streams as the test runner, then<br/>\n&gt;&gt; what you ask is impossible.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;&gt; The best you can do is customize the test runner (it&#39;s the path of<br/>\n&gt;&gt; least resistance) to send its output somewhere different, then<br/>\n&gt;&gt; redirect all standard output and standard error to files. You<br/>\n&gt;&gt; should be able to extend the textui TestRunner and override the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; ResultPrinter to print to a file, for example. Not too much work.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Miguel Pessoa Monteiro Mon, 21 Jun 2004 16:23:41 +0100<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I would like to point out that this kind of thing is very easy to do<br/>\n&gt; with aspect-oriented programming (though I doubt that someone is<br/>\n&gt; willing to learn AspectJ just to do that).<br/>\n <br/>\n </span></blockquote>just to &quot;scratch an itch&quot; (to use an English colloquialism).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I already did something along those lines, using a few simple<br/>\n&gt; aspects. Many people are using it to develop &quot;development aspects&quot;<br/>\n&gt; such as these, even if they do not include aspects in production<br/>\n&gt; code. Not for nothing AspectJ is considered by some people as &quot;the<br/>\n&gt; ultimate testing tool&quot;, though AspectJ is a lot more than that.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You should write that example up: sounds like an interesting article.<br/>\nFWIW I know the AspectJ tools for Eclipse include a<br/>\nrun-all-junit-tests module, but I haven&#39;t played with it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
