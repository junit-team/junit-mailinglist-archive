B. Rainsberger&quot; &lt;jbrains@r...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; This is entirely untrue. See Scott Stirling&#39;s good work in Chapter 5 of \n&gt; _JUnit Recipes_.\n&gt; \n\nSorry, I never intend to malign JUnit, while I think JUnit is a very\ngreat framework, I got lots of ideas from JUnit.\nI had missed the &quot;JUnit Recipes&quot;, I want to read this book but seems I\ncan&#39;t get it in China. Anyway, I&#39;ll change the words about JUnit in\nJetif documentation.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; You seem to frame this like a downside. Frameworks /should/ be light\nand \n&gt; supplemented by extension. That&#39;s what a good framework is; and not a \n&gt; suite of tools that do everything. That&#39;s a /platform/.\n&gt; \nYes, Frameworks should be light, but Jetif is not intended to provides\nevery thing. It&#39;s only provides the way to add extension more easier.\nI prefer that &quot;Keep it simple, while not too simple&quot;.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; It looks like a good project; but I&#39;d prefer you didn&#39;t malign JUnit \n&gt; with false statements.\n&gt; \nSorry again, I never want to malign JUnit, you have create a great\nframework, I still think it&#39;s good enough for lots of people even now,\nand in the future.\n\n&gt; Q: Why not extend JUnit with the very best data-driven suite mechanism \n&gt; on the planet? The market would love that.\n&gt; \nI had tried to extend the JUnit, but I found that I have to rewrite\nlots of classes to add desired features. It&#39;s impossible to change the\nJUnit framework since lots of people used it, so I create a new framework.\n\n&gt; Take care.\n\nThanks for your opinion and comments.\n\nBest Regards\n------------\nVicky Wang\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
