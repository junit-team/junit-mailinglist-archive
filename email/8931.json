(User in<br/>\nthis case being ant or Eclipse or...)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I consider a shame is the amount of stuff used in order to &quot;leverage<br/>\nthe framework&quot;. I&#39;m sorry, but it seems to me that there is little or no use<br/>\nof the framework, ant has effectively re-written it. Sure, it is nice that a<br/>\nframework can have extension points, but it seems a shame to need to<br/>\nleverage so many. It seems (from reading this) that ant leverages the<br/>\ntestcase class &quot;assert&quot; helper methods & little else.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW: I use the BuildFileTest class to test my ant tasks/scripts. Very nice,<br/>\nthank you ant. :-) That said, I have a problem when running them inside<br/>\nEclipse &#39;cos they (I believe) use  paths relative to the project they are<br/>\nin. The Eclipse test collector finds tests in dependent projects, but then<br/>\nruns them in this projects context, so the tests break not finding the ant<br/>\nscripts. Any thoughts on how I solve this, or if there are one or two bugs I<br/>\nought report? You just seem a good person to ask both question to & this<br/>\nseems as good a place/context as any. Thanks in advance. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nregards<br/>\n<br/>\nAdam</div>",
