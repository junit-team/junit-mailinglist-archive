Yes looks like I need to have a servlet that \ncan reload every 5 sec.  Assuming that I have such a servlet, what do \nI need to do to capture the results at some instance.  Right now I am \nusing TestResult class to store the results and then passing them as \nresponse to the browser after all the test cases are run.  But in \nthis case do I need to use TestListener interface and then use the \naddListener method of TestResult class.  Please let me know.\n\nthanks,\nSri\n\n\n\n--- In junit@y..., Jason Rogers &lt;jacaetev@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; --- sramaswa007@y... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Hi All,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   I am designing a project to run junit test cases from the \nbrowser.  \n&gt; &gt; Basically the user is given a form where in he types in the test \n&gt; &gt; class he wants to run and clicks the submit button. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The test case class is called and the results are returned back \nto \n&gt; &gt; the browser.  I am fine till that part as I am able to call the \n&gt; &gt; appropriate test case entered by the user and am able to display \nthe \n&gt; &gt; results on the browser.  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; What I also need is that, is there a way to determine and print \nwhat \n&gt; &gt; test case methods are being run.  As in case of the swingui \n&gt; &gt; (junit.swingui.TestRunner) we have the progress bar indicator \nthat \n&gt; &gt; tells us how many test cases are run, the failures and errors and \nthe \n&gt; &gt; stack trace.  Right now I am able to get all the results but once \nall \n&gt; &gt; the test cases have finished running, till then the page \ndisplayed to \n&gt; &gt; the user is blank.  Is there anyway to dynamically show which \nmethod \n&gt; &gt; in the test case is running and whether its a failure or error or \n&gt; &gt; success.  Please let me know.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thanks,\n&gt; &gt; Sri\n&gt; \n&gt; Sri,\n&gt; \n&gt; Sure this is possible.  But you are limited here by things \nextraneous to JUnit.\n&gt;  For instance, the success of the dynamic updating (i.e. the client \nseeing it\n&gt; in realtime) is going to depend on the speed of both the webserver \nand the\n&gt; browser.  So, you may never really reach a realtime effect in the \nbrowser. \n&gt; However, I suspect that this will generally be run in a business \nenvironment,\n&gt; so the speeds of the machines should be sufficient enough to \n_simulate_\n&gt; realtime.\n&gt; \n&gt; To dynamically update a page requires that you have a little more \nmagic than\n&gt; normal going on.  There will of necessity be some software on the \nclient side\n&gt; that will cause the client&#39;s browser to &quot;continuously&quot; reload.  You \ncan feed\n&gt; pages up to the server until your heart is content, but if the \nclient never\n&gt; requests them, it does no good.  I am not sure whether you can \naccomplish this\n&gt; through an applet, having never used them.  It seems to me that you \ncould write\n&gt; some script or a servlet to update every 5 seconds or so, or you \ncould just do\n&gt; this in the HTML (which is not so clean).\n&gt; \n&gt; All of that being said, is it really necessary to to have this kind \nof\n&gt; interface?  What&#39;s the motive?  Are the tests running on a server \nthat you want\n&gt; all clients to be able to see?\n&gt; \n&gt; -jason\n&gt; \n&gt; =====\n&gt; Jason Rogers\n&gt; [mailto: jacaetev@y...]\n&gt; ------------------------------\n&gt; Keep it simple...\n&gt; (1 Corinthians 2:2, Galatians 2:20, 6:14)\n&gt; \n&gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; Make a great connection at Yahoo!
