Checks to see if this action\n.     * is assignment-compatbile with the action class mapped in \n.     * struts-config.\n.     */\n.    protected void setAction(Action other) {\n.        String theActionPath = (String) getField(&quot;actionPath&quot;);\n.        theRequestProcessor.setOverrideAction(other, theActionPath);\n.    }\n\n\nThis turns out to be very useful in a variety of situations.  I can \nsubclass the Actions under test to override certain methods, etc.  \n\nWe also use this subclass to disable/enable the struts auto-\nvalidation of form beans.  Sometimes you just want to test the action \nprocessing without worrying about if the form is valid or not.  \n\nI would be happy to send you the code if you think this would be \nuseful.\n\nJeff Nielsen\nDigital Focus\nwww.digitalfocus.com\n\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, Bryce Fischer &lt;bryce@b...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; I&#39;ve posted a similar question on the Struts list, but maybe its \nmore\n&gt; appropriate for this list.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m trying to determine the best way to test my Struts Actions. I&#39;ve\n&gt; come across 2 projects that look interested.\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. StrutsTestCase (http://strutstestcase.sourceforge.net/)\n&gt; and\n&gt; 2. Mockrunner (http://mockrunner.sourceforge.net/)\n&gt; \n&gt; I like the simplicity of StrutsTestCase. I&#39;m using a delegate in my\n&gt; Action case, and would like to use a MockObject in place of the \ndelegate\n&gt; class. This way I could simulate exceptions, etc...\n&gt; \n&gt; Unfortunately, I have been unable to devise a method to tell my \nAction\n&gt; object what delegate class I&#39;d like to use. \n&gt; \n&gt; One idea would be to put the delegate class in the request \nparameter.\n&gt; This would be easy to do in StrutsTestCase, but I&#39;m not sure how \nthis\n&gt; would work in a Live system. How would I get the delegate class \ninto the\n&gt; request?\n&gt; \n&gt; Any other suggestions?\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; Bryce Fischer &lt;bryce@b...&gt;\n\n\n",
