Unfortunately, we didnt and now are trying to backfill.  We<br/>\nhave several hundred classes that I have to write test cases for.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I was just hoping for something that would at least give me a start<br/>\n(boundary conditions: null, empty string, MIN_VALUE, MAX_VALUE...). <br/>\nThen, I would go back through and fix/add in the other tests.  But at<br/>\nleast I would have a first swag at it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again for all your help<br/>\n<br/>\nJim<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Michael Silverstein&quot;<br/>\n&lt;msilverstein@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Chris Dollin wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If not, how do you explain to the tool what the test cases are? <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Inferring them from already-written code is hard (and runs <br/>\n&gt; &gt; the risk of <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; capturing subtle incorrect behaviour).<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; One thing we&#39;ve done is implement an object interaction recorder that<br/>\n&gt; captures interactions (method and constructor invocations) between an<br/>\n&gt; arbitrary object under test and objects that call it (actors). We can<br/>\n&gt; then generate unit tests that roughly mimic those interactions as a<br/>\n&gt; starting point for additional variations. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The process is:<br/>\n&gt; 1) Start recorder to capture interactions with a specific object<br/>\n&gt; 2) Execute one high-level user story, typically from the GUI<br/>\n&gt; 3) Stop recorder<br/>\n&gt; 4) Generate unit test from recording that mimics interactions between an<br/>\n&gt; actor and the object under test<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This is a good technique if you&#39;ve already got a (somewhat) working<br/>\n&gt; application and would like to rapidly add unit tests for a particular<br/>\n&gt; class before making changes or additions to it. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Anyway, you can read more about this technique at<br/>\n&gt; http://www.silvermark.com/Product/enhancedjunit/.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I also have an article coming out November in &quot;Software Testing and<br/>\n&gt; Quality Engineering&quot; magazine  (www.stqe.com) that describes a technique<br/>\n&gt; for using calls to a recording framework within an application to<br/>\n&gt; automatically generate semantically meaningful tests, at arbitrary<br/>\n&gt; levels of granularity. I can provide more information if anyone has any<br/>\n&gt; interest in this sort of thing.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Mike Silverstein<br/>\n&gt; SilverMark, Inc.<br/>\n&gt; The Object Testing Company<br/>\n&gt; www.javatesting.com<br/>\n&gt; **********************************<br/>\n&gt; * Makers of &quot;Test Mentor&quot;        *<br/>\n&gt; * and &quot;Enhanced JUnit&quot; Java      *<br/>\n&gt; * component testing tools        *<br/>\n&gt; **********************************<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ---<br/>\n&gt; Outgoing mail is certified Virus Free.<br/>\n&gt; Checked by AVG anti-virus system (http://www.grisoft.com).<br/>\n&gt; Version: 6.0.518 / Virus Database: 316 - Release Date: 9/11/2003 </span></blockquote></div>",
