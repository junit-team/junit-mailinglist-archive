And I did reuse the same<br/>\ndirectory location for all my tests.<br/>\nI did clean the directory in the @Before-method and in the<br/>\n@After-method (Using jakarta FileUtils).<br/>\n<br/>\nStandard JUnit does not spawn any threads, as far as I know. So the<br/>\ntests are run sequentially. Other runners could change this, of<br/>\ncourse.<br/>\nIf your code spawns threads, that&#39;s a different matter of course.<br/>\nAnd from afar I would also suggest to check for files that where not<br/>\nproperly closed.<br/>\n<br/>\nGreetings,<br/>\n   Malte</div>",
