JUnit would then pass this along\nto the correct test classes.\n\nI apologize for the overly vague description, but what would be the most\nefficient use of JUnit for this use case? It would seem the solution would\nbe two fold. First, I&#39;d create Parameterized tests that read the test data\nfrom the data store based on provided unique identifiers. Second, I need a\nway to pass the set of unique identifiers to the tests themselves. Would\nthe best approach for this be a custom runner?\n\nThanks for your time,\n\nCorey\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
