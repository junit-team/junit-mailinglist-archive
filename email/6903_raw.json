Typically, strong chess players are quite\ncapable of sizing up most situations and acting accordingly.  However, I\nthink social and physical problems come into play that are more\ninfluential than the position on the board.  Yikes, did I just make\nanother anology. ;)\n\nI suppose the point would be, what good is TDD if your enviroment is not\nsupportive of the other XP practices.  If you constantly have crazy\ndeadlines, your co-workers are unproductive as pairs, etc.  Time and\ntime again, I see people suggesting jumping into XP with what I like to\ncall *the coding practices* when really what they need to do is create\nthe culture to support these practices first. \n\nJust like a chess player who zones out before the game, utilizing\ncomplete focus on the position...\n\nJust an attempt at another interesting thought....\n\n--Ryan\n\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Scott Stirling\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, February 06, 2003 8:18 PM\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: RE: [junit] TDD -&gt; FSM\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; &gt; From: J. B. Rainsberger [mailto:jbr@...]\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Scott:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Have you identified how a test-driven class implements a FSM? If I\n&gt; &gt; give you some code that I test-drove, would you try \n&gt; identifying how it\n&gt; &gt; is a FSM? That would be very interesting.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;d be willing to try.  I would be interested to have an\n&gt; example that&#39;s not my own or borrowed out of a book.  But I&#39;m \n&gt; working with a few book examples right now, trying to sort \n&gt; things out and see how far I can take this FSM idea.\n&gt; \n&gt; Scott S.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
