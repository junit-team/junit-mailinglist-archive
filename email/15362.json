You are absolutely right that if we had frequent releases the optimal strategy would be to conceal everything possible in the framework and open it up &quot;on demand&quot;. I don&#39;t see how to implement frequent releases with JUnit, however, since the IDE vendors bake JUnit into their offerings and we don&#39;t have any infrastructure to push updates. Perhaps I am just fussing about this, or there is a simple solution. I am open to suggestions.<br/>\n<br/>\nSincerely yours,<br/>\n<br/>\nKent Beck<br/>\nThree Rivers Institute<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>] On <br/>\n&gt; Behalf Of Elliotte Rusty Harold<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, November 02, 2005 7:14 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [junit] JUnit 4 restructuring<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Kent Beck wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; However, as Erich is at pains to explain to me frequently, <br/>\n&gt; that is not the context in which we are writing JUnit. We <br/>\n&gt; need to balance the need for flexibility of extension with <br/>\n&gt; the need for flexibility of design evolution. Revealing all <br/>\n&gt; the details of our implementation means we can&#39;t change <br/>\n&gt; anything. And so we are left, as you said, revealing only as <br/>\n&gt; much as we are certain will be useful.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I basically agree with that. Protected methods are fine, as long as <br/>\n&gt; you&#39;re reasonably confident they&#39;re right and you&#39;re willing <br/>\n&gt; to maintain <br/>\n&gt; them in the future.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; This leaves me unsettled. I know that my frameworks aren&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; as useful as they could be, but I also know that I would <br/>\n&gt; regret opening them up completely. I don&#39;t see how to strike <br/>\n&gt; a better balance than we strike with JUnit, though, so I&#39;ll <br/>\n&gt; live with it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I think extreme programming/agile development offers a path <br/>\n&gt; out of this <br/>\n&gt; conundrum. Instead of looking for one big bang release that <br/>\n&gt; then stands <br/>\n&gt; untouched for a few years, look to more incremental releases (like in <br/>\n&gt; the earlier days of JUnit). Two week release cycles give you <br/>\n&gt; plenty of <br/>\n&gt; opportunities to open up the framework to extension as people <br/>\n&gt; actually <br/>\n&gt; need and request the extension. I&#39;ve found by experience that <br/>\n&gt; I tend to <br/>\n&gt; be very bad at predicting what actually will be needed, even <br/>\n&gt; by myself. <br/>\n&gt; Therefore the longer I can delay the decision, the more likely it is <br/>\n&gt; that the eventual decision will be correct.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Of course, at least half of this is stuff I learned first from your <br/>\n&gt; book. :-)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -- <br/>\n&gt; ﻿Elliotte Rusty Harold  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:elharo@...\">elharo@...</a><br/>\n&gt; XML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/\">http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/</a><br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/\">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/</a><br/>\n&gt; ref=nosim<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
