Besides, the original<br/>\nposter was not necessarily talking about unit testing.<br/>\n<br/>\nTime and again, I&#39;ve had the need to create tests that depend on each<br/>\nother.  It&#39;s not very common (most of my tests are isolated), but when<br/>\nyou encounter this problem, you really need a way to specify that<br/>\ncertain tests depend on each other, for two reasons:<br/>\n<br/>\n- You are testing logic that has dependencies itself, so it should<br/>\ncome as no surprise that the tests that exercise it need dependencies<br/>\nas well.<br/>\n<br/>\n- More accurate reporting.  In the case where a test that failed<br/>\ncauses dozens of others to fail as well, would you rather read &quot;1<br/>\nSUCCESS, 19 FAILURES&quot; or &quot;1 SUCCESS, 1 FAILURE, 18 SKIPS&quot;?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe latter error message singles out the test that really failed and<br/>\nalso tells you that for now, you can ignore the other 18 tests that<br/>\nwere skipped because they didn&#39;t really fail:  they simply didn&#39;t run.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe fact that JUnit doesn&#39;t support dependent testing was one of the<br/>\nreasons why I created TestNG in the first place, and David, I still<br/>\nhave some hope that at some point, JUnit is going to go beyond its<br/>\n&quot;unit testing&quot; scope and start addressing other forms of testing as<br/>\nwell :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nCedric<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://testng.org\">http://testng.org</a></div>",
