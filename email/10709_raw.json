Anyone who has any interesting suggestion or \napproach \n&gt; on how to go about testing UI?\n\n\nI&#39;ve managed to successfully build hundreds of web tests for the\napplication with my company. These tests have been running for about\n10 months now and continue to grow.\n\nThe design is:\n\n1) a tool that talks to the IE OLE object directly, using Perl -\nhttp://samie.sourceforge.net/\n\n2) adding lots of improvements (this tool will most likely need\nenhancements, since I found it didn&#39;t provide enough functionality\nas is; I&#39;m currently in the process of trying to open source the\nimprovements I made)\n\n3) linking it to talk to JUnit using XML-RPC\n\n4) JUnit\n\n5) company specific layer that simplifies test writing\n\nIf you don&#39;t care about using Java and JUnit you can skip steps 3,\n4, 5. You can try just using the tool, but I strongly encourage you\nto come up with a test pattern that eliminates duplication from your\ncode and makes it very easy to add new tests. (I happen to like the\ntemplate pattern.)\n\n\nWith this setup I&#39;ve been able to currently have over 500 web tests\nthat have been running for months and are easy to maintain. Each\nweb tests does dozens of assertions and navigations. They check for\nvery specific values on the web page - value of all form elements,\nvalue of all HTML tables, links, text, check box states, etc.\nBasically, anything that IE can normally see, I can get at\nprogrammatically, too. They also can interact with any form element,\nclick links, press the refresh button - you have programmatic\ncontrol over IE.\n\nI tried using HttpUnit before coming up with the approach described \nabove but found it too limited in its JavaScript support. I started \nat a company that already had a working product. They weren&#39;t about \nto start changing the code (JavaScript) to make it more testable or \nso that HttpUnit would like it better. Suffice it to say, I had to \ncome up with a different approach.\n\n\nMisha Rybalov\nwww.gomisha.com/autotest\n\n\n\n",
