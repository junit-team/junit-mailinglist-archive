Fact is, if your precondition fails or you<br/>\n&gt; get a NullPointerException, there&#39;s a bug in the client. You can have<br/>\n&gt; checking enabled, or not, but checking is not error handling. The point<br/>\n&gt; of DbC is to build software robust enough so that you don&#39;t have to<br/>\n&gt; write error handling code at each level. Relevant section is 11.6<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Assertions are not an input checking mechanism.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Indeed. If I violate your precondition, then I am writing defective<br/>\ncode. There are a few remedies:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Be nice and tolerate my indiscretion, say by substituting sensible<br/>\ndefault values and continuing.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Telling me directly, &quot;You shouldn&#39;t do that,&quot; by throwing a specific<br/>\nexception that explains my mistake.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Telling me indirectly, by failing is some deterministic, by<br/>\nnon-obvious way.<br/>\n<br/>\n4. Providing me examples of how not to violate your precondition.<br/>\n<br/>\n5. Documenting the precondition and warning me that violating it leads <br/>\nto &quot;undefined behavior&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n6. Providing Contract Tests that I can inherit to help me know that my <br/>\ncode won&#39;t violate your precondition.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are others, I&#39;m sure.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt looks as though you reject #5 out of hand, and I agree, but all the <br/>\nothers are viable choices. I would choose the one providing the best ROI <br/>\nfor the situation. In a language that checks preconditions for me, I <br/>\nwould get #2 for free. In Java, which doesn&#39;t, it depends on the cost of <br/>\nviolating the precondition. If it&#39;s anything like persistent data <br/>\ncorruption all the way up to loss of life, I would probably insist on <br/>\n#2. If it&#39;s nothing worse than having to retry one of a batch of <br/>\ntransactions, I might go with #1. Still, I would probably insist on #4 <br/>\nand prefer #6.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
