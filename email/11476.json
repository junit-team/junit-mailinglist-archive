Should they be<br/>\nincluded in production code packages or separated out into their own<br/>\nJUnitTest package?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, any JUnit book recommendations?  I saw JUnit.org lists quite a<br/>\nfew.  The books are so expensive, so I&#39;m looking to just get one good<br/>\nbasic one for now.  This would include approaches to writing test<br/>\ncases and using things like mock objects.  I notice a new book is<br/>\ncoming out soon called JUnit Recipes?  Any advance word on that?  Note<br/>\nthat as of now, I&#39;m not using EJB, XML or any goodies like that.  I&#39;m<br/>\njust using the basic java.utils API, though some folks in our group<br/>\nare also using JMS.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\n<br/>\nKen</div>",
