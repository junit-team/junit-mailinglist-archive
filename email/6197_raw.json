The corollary is don&#39;t test things that\ncan&#39;t\n&gt;possibly break.\n&gt;\n&gt;On the other hand, you could be paranoid and say &quot;how do I know my DDL\nis\n&gt;correct?&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt;If you&#39;re that paranoid, I would recommend using the ant sql task.\n&gt;Basically\n&gt;write a smoke test\n&gt;that preforms an insert with nulls & make sure the build fails.\n&gt;\n&gt;-- Levi\n\nI did this on a project in IBM and it helped me. Let me describe the\nscenario.\n\nI built a small software component -- about 20 classes. This component\nhad three objects that required persistence. In that organization, the\ndatabase schema was centrally controlled by a &quot;Database Group&quot;. They\ndid not necessarily have total control over the database schema, but\nthey executed all changes to the database schema. Not wanting to\ninflict incremental development on a group that didn&#39;t have the\nbandwidth to accommodate me, I built my component with no persistence,\ngot the data model &quot;right&quot;, then prepared the database schema for\nsubmission to the database group. My goal was to make them happy by not\nmaking changes on them. They hate that.\n\nSome of my tests involved checking the unique keys on the database\ntables by trying to create persistent objects with various combinations\nof values for unique keys and expecting &quot;duplicate key&quot; errors at the\nright times. Some people might have seen those tests as testing the\ndatabase management system&#39;s implementation of unique keys, but I saw\nit as testing whether the database group got my tables right.\n\nAs it turned out, they didn&#39;t. They messed up one of my unique key\nconstraint specifications because they were importing my\nexpertly-crafted DDL into ERWIN, then using ERWIN to spit DDL out\nagain. I felt that they were slaves to their tools, but I wasn&#39;t about\nto tell them that. In the end, I was happy I wrote those tests.\n\nNow, had I been in control of my own DDL, I might not have written\nthose tests; however, since I designed my component to abstract away\npersistence, I wrote those tests to ensure that my in-memory\nimplementation of the persistent objects worked correctly. It needed to\nreject the same kinds of duplicates that the database would.\n\nPerhaps this gives you some more information to use to judge whether\nyou&#39;re testing the right thing.\n\nJ. B.
