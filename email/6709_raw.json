Please consider, others may have different \nways to do things. I don&#39;t think there is THE right way that \nfits everything and everyone. Choose what fit&#39;s your needs \nand don&#39;t stop looking for ways to improve. \n\nI&#39;ve tried to program exactly the way you described. (I did this \nmonths ago.) It just didn&#39;t fit me that much. (Please remember, \nthe difference is only in the way of sketching and this depends \non the support by the IDE one uses, too.) \n\n\nIn response to J. B. Rainsberger:\n\n&gt; ...For Customer Tests, I would never expect to find a CT by\n&gt; looking for a method name; I would look for the name of a use case or\n&gt; transaction script or feature.\n\nI agree with you. That&#39;s what I ment with my PS statement \nat the bottom of that email.\n\n&gt; &gt;JUnitDoclet allows re-generating, so it&#39;s not much work \n&gt; &gt;to keep tests and app in sync.\n&gt;\n&gt; Regenerating what? Does it regenerate test stubs? \n\nYes, stubs are _regenerated_and_merged_ according to the \nnew structure of the application.Most of the tests are placed \nin the right spot and the tool points you to the few others, \nthat have been affected by the change in the application if \nthey could not been handled automatically.\n_No_test_gets_lost._\nIf one does that as part of refactoring, it&#39;s very easy to \nmanage, since refactoring is done in small steps.\n\n&gt; Do I need to reimplement my test?!\n\nNO. Definitely not.\n(I would like to write this in very large letters. :) \n\nRegards,\n\nSteffen Gemkow\n\n\n\n",
