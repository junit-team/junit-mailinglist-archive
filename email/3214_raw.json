At no costs I want to manually\n&gt; &gt;exclude the test classes during shipment. Addiditonally I simply find\n&gt; &gt;this approach more structured - in our last project we had for each\n&gt; &gt;package a .test package.\n&gt; &gt;The separate package however has the main drawback for me that I cant\n&gt; &gt;test package private methods. This forces me to make more methods\n&gt; &gt;public than I want just for testing purposes.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;What are your experiences and preferences in this area ?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I have them in the same package, and use ant to exclude them \n&gt; when I do a \n&gt; full build.\n&gt; \n&gt; This does force you to use a consistent naming scheme for the \n&gt; classes, but \n&gt; I don&#39;t find that to be too much of a problem.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --\n&gt; \n&gt;                            *   Jim Cheesman   *\n&gt;              Trabajo: \n&gt; jchees@... - (34)(91) 724 9200 x 2360\n&gt;   In retrospect it becomes clear \n&gt; that hindsight is definitely overrated\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
