If you fire up 4 threads against a single instance of RC it queues up all the requests and only runs them 1 at time.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; We run all our browser-bots on windows, and the CI is bamboo on linux. We do not use grid. Instead we let a single build run with 4 threads towards a single instance of selenium RC (with firefox). This has <br/>\n&gt; proved to be a nice, stable setup that gives us a lot of punch.<br/>\n&gt; Now we also partition the entire build into 2, so we have two separate (Windows) pizza boxes running RC+ firefox, for a grand total<br/>\n&gt; of 8 available browsers. This allows us to use firefox as the backbone in our selenium-TDD-based development that has allowed us<br/>\n&gt; virtually regression free frequent deployments. </span></blockquote></div>",
