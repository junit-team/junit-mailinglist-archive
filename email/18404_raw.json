The essay is called &quot;The Trouble With JUnit&quot; and can be found\n=\r\n&gt; at the following URL.\n&gt; \n&gt; http://simonpeter.org/technology/writings/thet=\r\nroublewithjunit.html\n\nI agree with the sentiments expressed here.  I thnk t=\r\nhat most of the\nproblem is related to the difference between writing unit t=\r\nests after\nthe code, and writing unit tests before the code.\n\nMy own person=\r\nal epiphany about TDD came from reading Jeff Langr&#39;s\nseries of articles abo=\r\nut building an object-relational database\nmapping layer. That can be found =\r\nhere:\nhttp://langrsoft.com/dbtdd.shtml  (Thanks Jeff!)\n\nHope that helps som=\r\neone,\nNick\n\n\nMinor nit:  It&#39;s nice come across an engineer that can write w=\r\nell, but\nI think you confuse &quot;its&quot; and &quot;it&#39;s&quot; in a few places.\n\n\n\n",
