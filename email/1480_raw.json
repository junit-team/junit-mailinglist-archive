Well, most probably I was not clear. I&#39;m sorry \n&gt;     &gt; for that. I&#39;ll try\n&gt;     &gt; again:\n&gt;     &gt; \n&gt;     &gt; After testing the model, I like to do integration tests \n&gt;     &gt; for model, control\n&gt;     &gt; and view. I do this by checking the view. But as the view \n&gt;     &gt; is used by users\n&gt;     &gt; only, there is no need to know state, at least for \n&gt;     &gt; programm components other\n&gt;     &gt; than the tests. This approach is (Did I get you right \n&gt;     &gt; now?) not favorable in\n&gt;     &gt; your eyes? Which would be your favorable approach?\n&gt; \n&gt; It isn&#39;t a question of being favorable or not.  It is a question \nof &quot;Do you\n&gt; want to automate the testing of your GUI with JUnit?  And if so, to \nwhat\n&gt; granularity?&quot;  I think testing the GUI is always good, but there are\n&gt; limitations for JUnit to do this.  If there is pertinent state \ninformation\n&gt; that you want to capture (which it doesn&#39;t sound like there is) you \ncan use\n&gt; the approach I mentioned before.  If you simply want to test the \noverall\n&gt; look, a one-eyed inspection is fine.  If you want to \nprogrammatically test\n&gt; the overall look, something like SilkTest would probably be a good \nway to\n&gt; go.  I think that having state inspectors on every GUI component is\n&gt; overkill!  If there is some meta-state that your controller gets \nfrom the\n&gt; view to effect a change on your model, then write an inspector on \nyour\n&gt; controller for that, but not just for testing.  The test should \nreflect (to\n&gt; some degree) the usage.  Again, this isn&#39;t a silver bullet, it&#39;s \njust one\n&gt; example.\n&gt; \n&gt; MVC can be difficult.  If it is done improperly it offers many \ntraps!!  But\n&gt; done rightly, it&#39;s a wonderful tool.  Testing is easier, \nrefactoring is\n&gt; easier, etc.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Jason\n\n\n",
