I bought the\nebook edition some days ago, and I&#39;ve already begun to apply what I&#39;ve\nlearned.  My unit tests (Programmer Tests) are simpler and clearer.\n\nThe material on organizing tests presents multiple points of view, offers\nthe authors&#39; own preferences and their reasons for having them based on\nthose points of view.  It&#39;s very practical.  Of course, J.B. is very\npractical, evidenced by his replies in this group and having met him once at\nXP/AU 2002 in Chicago.\n\nNice work J.B. and Scott!\n\nCraig Demyanovich\n\n",
