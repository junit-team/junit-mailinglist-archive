It&#39;s fine but may I ask: do you really need to test your \n&gt; class with every possibilities?  I don&#39;t think so.  You cannot test \n&gt; everything (imagine if you want to test a drawing program with\n&gt; endless possibilities).\n\nThere are often situations where it is possible to automatically\ngenerate useful tests. For example, I have a domain-specific language\nthat configures our product. Statements in the language are allowed in\nfairly unconstrained order. There are dependencies between the\nstatements. Nonetheless, the order of the statements should not affect\nthe resulting configuration. We found it valuable to write tests that\nwould permute valid code and verify it compiled to the same result. Of\ncourse, we decided to do it all in one testMethod() because that&#39;s the\neasier way to configure it. This argument assumes there is only one way\nto write tests and that any way that write either more or fewer tests\nis wrong. That&#39;s simply not the case. JUnit, despite its name, is quite\nusable for writing larger scale tests and even for automating tests.\nWhy not help it be a more complete framework rather than argue it\nshould not grow because &quot;real&quot; unit tests wouldn&#39;t need a proposed\nenhancement?\n\nI have another example of automated tests, but I can&#39;t remember the\ndetails. In this instance, we actually wrote a setUp() method that\ncreated multiple instance of the TestCase with different\nconfigurations, and ran into the naming problem. Our workaround to the\nJUnit confounding of test name with method name was to make sure all of\nour assertions include a message that indicates which test\nconfiguration is being used.\n\nRegards,\n\nRob\n\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nBuy the perfect holiday gifts at Yahoo!
