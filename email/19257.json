    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1258379079\">Thanks Todd,<br/>\nI currently use POI to read and write files.   A friend said try not to use<br/>\nFiles as puts a dependency on the files system.<br/>\n <br/>\nSo started putting the contents of small files as constants of a String<br/>\nvariable.  However for bigger files/non-test files like Excel think need to<br/>\nactually pull in a file.<br/>\n <br/>\nSo my question was how and where do people generally put there data files.<br/>\nI know we can read them via getSystemResourceAsStream() etc.  Just trying to<br/>\nsee how generally done, e.g. our tests placed in same file, are properties<br/>\nplace din a properties file with each test etc.<br/>\n <br/>\nCurrently run my tests though Inteli J.<br/>\n <br/>\nGenerally at work the main developers just have a file named test.properties<br/>\nin each test folder and they read the parameters from there, but on<br/>\nreflection think that gives a dependency on the file system for properties,<br/>\nwhich should probably be in the test.  For data files it makes sense,<br/>\nalthough I also like the idea of having a data folder for this.<br/>\n <br/>\nAnyone got an example of a JUnit testcase which uses files?  Just would like<br/>\nto see it done elsewhere, as think not totally done correct where I<br/>\nwork.....<br/>\n <br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nDarren<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n  _____  <br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of<br/>\nBradley, Todd<br/>\nSent: 06 April 2007 18:17<br/>\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com<br/>\nSubject: RE: [junit] Paramter/Data test files?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Spoke to a friend who said you should not have properties in <br/>\n&gt; a properties file as gives dependence on files for test cases <br/>\n&gt; (makes good sense).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You&#39;ve got to inject your dependencies somehow. We use Java properties<br/>\nto do that (for the purposes of test) where I work.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Are there any classes (out of the box I am not aware of) for <br/>\n&gt; reading properties files in the current test case and other <br/>\n&gt; files like Excel?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>For the first part, why don&#39;t you just load the properties file into the<br/>\nJVM and then get the properties through the regular old Java System<br/>\nobject?<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the second part, maybe I don&#39;t understand the question, but to read<br/>\nExcel files into a Java test case, I think POI-HSSF is the way to go<br/>\n(http://jakarta. &lt;http://jakarta.apache.org/poi/hssf/index.html&gt;<br/>\napache.org/poi/hssf/index.html). But you already<br/>\nmentioned POI, so maybe you already know that...<br/>\n<br/>\nTodd.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
