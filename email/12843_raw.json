To test methods that only modify private fields like you\n&gt; describe, you can use reflection (which I would personally prefer).  Use\n&gt; the object&#39;s getClass() method then Class&#39;s getField() method.  Field\n&gt; extends java.lang.reflect.AccessibleObject which has a\n&gt; setAccessible(boolean) method you can use to gain access to a private\n&gt; field through reflection.  Field has getter methods for its value.\n&gt; \n&gt; A security manager can be set up to prevent this bypassing of the\n&gt; private restriction, but by default you are allowed to do it.\n\nYou prefer jumping through all those hoops to just adding a method? To \neach his own, but I see that as much more complex than just adding a \nmethod could ever be.\n-- \nJ. B.
