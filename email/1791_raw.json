The only reason I can think of is\nif your application had the ability to run built-in diagnostics that were\nincluded in order to help track down faults due to unanticipated\nenvironmental conditions. Other than that, test cases are just dead code as\nfar as an end-user is concerned.\n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nMike Silverstein\nSilverMark, Inc.\nThe object testing company\nhttp://www.silvermark.com\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: tsmets@...

Just include them in the release.\n&gt;\n&gt;   &gt; Because we have a naming convention where every test\n&gt;   &gt; class name begins with\n&gt;   &gt; &quot;Test&quot;, it&#39;s also pretty easy to manipulate them when exporting.\n&gt;   &gt; Why hide the tests? I&#39;m proud of them! :) And I want them\n&gt;   &gt; to be seen right\n&gt;   &gt; aside the class they test, so it gives a visual clue that\n&gt;   &gt; they need to\n&gt;   &gt; follow the evolution of the class. Anyway.... :)\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;/snip&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
