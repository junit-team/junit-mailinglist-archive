The module\n&gt; as it runs at present uses the BlueJ environment. I have it in the \nback\n&gt; of my mind to introduce some Test-Driven Development. Does anyone \nhere know\n&gt; ( or better use ) a BlueJ environment that has been embellished \nwith JUnit \n&gt; support ?\n\nI can tell you that we are working on a version of BlueJ\nwith integrated support for unit testing.. the plan is for\nit to be released before the end of the year (hopefully\na beta by the end of september).\n\nWith the current version, adding the junit.jar through\nthe &quot;preferences / libraries&quot; preferences panel will make the junit \nclasses available, but then there is the problem of make the swing \nrunner interface available to the student.. I imagine a simple class \ncould be written that wraps around the swingrunner class that allows \nan interactive method call to bring the dialog up.. give me a few \ndays to think about it and I might be able to make something \navailable on the bluej website resources section to help out.\n\nAndrew\n\n---\nAndrew.Patterson@...\nMonash University\n\n\n\n\n",
