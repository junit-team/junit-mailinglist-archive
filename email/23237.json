And I also often prefer interfaces over abstract classes. But I do not always use interfaces. Interfaces and abstract classes both have their place. It&#39;s hard to find simple rules to decide what to use where.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I personally don&#39;t see having TestRule as an abstract class causing a burdon for competent developers. Since TestRule has only one method, it&#39;s very easy to use delegation to share code. You could have your Rule have many methods that delegate to another object, or your Rule could have a single accessor to get the delegate, or you could create the Rule by calling a method on another object.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In any case, what we could use is data. Can someone give concrete cases were making TestRule an abstract class has caused problems?
