Is JUnit a unit testing tool? or is it a testing manageme=\r\nnt tool in which we store test cases and test execution results\n2. I have d=\r\nownload Junit from the http://www.junit.org/, however I have not been able =\r\nto &quot;load&quot; the tool. I am not sure on which file to execute? I am running on=\r\n Windows XP SP2. \n\nI understand that these might be newbie questions, howev=\r\ner any pointers you might provide me would be very appericated\n\n\n",
