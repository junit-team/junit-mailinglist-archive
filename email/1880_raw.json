I hope that JUnit always stays as simple as it is now,\nso that it never needs support.\n\nThat&#39;s the beauty of JUnit: its simplicity.\n\nJ. B.

We are considering making it an &#39;organizationally approved&#39;\ntool for our development environment.  In order to accomplish this, we will\nperform a technical evaluation of the tool and submit an &#39;to be approved&#39;\nrecommendation to our Standards Committee. A &#39;Support Plan&#39; must accompany\nthe request for approval.  Consequently, I am researching support that is\navailable for the tool.\n\nDo you have any specific information regarding JUnit support? Have any\narticles been written on the subject? Has a &quot;Support Plan&quot; been written by\none of Junit&#39;s users.\n\nI have visited the SourceForge site as well as JUnit.org, so I am generally\nfamiliar with what is there.\n\nDoes anyone provide telephone support?\n\nThank you for any information you can provide.\n\nPenny Heatherington\nProject Lead\nOppenheimerFunds\n\n\nThis electronic mail transmission may contain confidential information and\nis intended only for the person(s) named.
