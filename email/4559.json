As such, this should be a very stable API, and changes to it<br/>\nshould go through controlled @deprecation process spanning perhaps<br/>\nseveral releases (to allow clients to catch up).<br/>\n<br/>\nI am in favor of explicit documentation for published APIs, and am quite<br/>\ncomfortable with unit tests alone (or, God forbid! no documentation at<br/>\nall) for system APIs (*).<br/>\n<br/>\nManuel Amago.<br/>\nmailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mamago@...\">mamago@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n(*)  If you find yourself having to dive into system APIs, you are<br/>\nprobably better off understanding the internals anyway, without needing<br/>\nany documentation.  Unit tests could come in handy if you make any<br/>\nmodifications, or to check that any changes you make don&#39;t disturb the<br/>\nexisting system.</div>",
