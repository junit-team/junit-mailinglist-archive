Note<br/>\n&gt; that the fixture is not just the objects, but their state as well. <br/>\n&gt; You may have instance of the same classes, but with different state<br/>\n&gt; (e.g. empty list, one element, two elements...). They are different<br/>\n&gt; fixtures and should be in different TestCase subclasses.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Question about this.  Obviously each &#39;object&#39; can have its own state <br/>\nbut through static attributes each class can have its own state <br/>\nalso.  How do you deal with that with reference to this discussion?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; This is a bit of a quibble IMHO.  My point is that you don;t mix<br/>\n&gt; fixtures in a single TestCase subclass.... the idea of building<br/>\n&gt; TestCase subclasses around distinct fixtures.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Matt Swaffer</div>",
