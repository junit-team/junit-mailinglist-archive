B. Rainsberger&quot; &lt;jbr@...&gt;\r\nReply-To: jbr@...\r\nX-Yahoo-Group-Post: member; u=89240252\r\nX-Yahoo-Profile: nails762\r\n\r\n\n&lt;quote name=&quot;Hoepner, Josh (J.M.)&quot;&gt;\n\n&gt;&lt;quote&gt;\n&gt;...let&#39;s not forget that testing is a mindful activity, and not a\nmindless \n&gt;activity. Generating test stubs, especially from classes already\nwritten, \n&gt;relieves you of the need to think about what you&#39;re testing. This is a\nbad \n&gt;thing, and often a Bad Thing.\n&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;I agree wholeheartedly with what you&#39;re saying.  Unfortunately, I was\n&gt;given the dubious honor of creating JUnit tests for code that was\nalready\n&gt;written.  The test stub generator saves me alot of time creating stubs\nfor\n&gt;methods that have 80+ &lt;ack!&gt; methods.  Then I go through and remove\nthe\n&gt;stubs for methods that don&#39;t need to be tested and add test cases for\n&gt;methods that are more complex and require multiple test cases.  Stub\n&gt;generation is a timesaver IMHO, as long as you make sure you are still\n&gt;covering all your bases.\n&lt;/quote&gt;\n\nWell, yes and no. You said, &quot;I agree...&quot; but then argued the other side\nof the issue, and I&#39;m just trying to explore that.\n\nI presume you work somewhat like this:\n\n1. Pick a class.\n2. Generate test stubs.\n3. For each test stub:\n    3.1. &quot;Hm... do I need this?&quot; Delete if &quot;no&quot;, otherwise:\n    3.2. Write the test.\n    3.3. Make it pass, if it doesn&#39;t already.\n\nMy guess is, though, that as you &quot;make it pass&quot;, you have to change\nthings. You may even add and remove methods to make the code you&#39;re\ntesting pass or to make it easier to understand. (If you truly can&#39;t do\nthis for whatever reason, then let me know, because then the rules\nchange a little.) This may invalidate a good portion of step 2. In that\ncase, perhaps better is to skip step 2 *or* see whether you can\ngenerate test stubs for only one method or group of overloaded methods\nat a time.\n\nIf it really is working for you, then great; but maybe you&#39;re falling\nfor automation: &quot;I&#39;ll automate it, and change whatever I need to change\nafterward.&quot; That&#39;s a good idea, but only if you&#39;re changing less than\nsay, half the wor the automation is doing for you.\n\nBy the way -- you have classes with 80 methods? Can you do some\nbraindead refactorings first, like extract class, to make that more\nmanageable? There are some refactorings that you can apply -- if you do\nso very carefully -- without tests, although that&#39;s not necessarily\nrecommended. :)\n\nGood luck,\n\n&gt;\n&gt;-Josh\n&gt;\n&gt;------------------------ Yahoo!
