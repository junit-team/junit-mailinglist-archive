I understand that TD=\r\nD is \na design activity , however what I wish to tackle is the test-first \n=\r\nconcept of TDD. I realise that there are many phases to TDD, but it \nseems =\r\nwhat people have problems with is the idea of writing the \ntests before wri=\r\nting the code. With that in mind, I figured if i \ncould help autogenerate s=\r\nome basic testing codes to get them off on \na start, they could get the han=\r\ng of it and probably improve on the \ntests generated later.\n\n\n\nErm does tha=\r\nt make sense?\n\n\nMost other tools out there requires additional installation=\r\n etc, \nwhich is why I hope to build on JUnit&#39;s core code itself to generate=\r\n \nthe additional test cases. In such a way, the user probably won&#39;t \nneed a=\r\nny additional application, just an updated version of the \nJUnit jar file f=\r\nor eclipse plugin or whatever?\n\nI am kinda new at this and would appreciate=\r\n any help or suggestions\n\nThanks a bunch,\nJimm\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com=\r\n, &quot;Andrew McDonagh&quot; &lt;andrewmcdonagh@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; On 12/27/06, chet hend=\r\nrickson &lt;lists@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Hello Jimm,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I can imagine some benef=\r\nit from generating some asserts as part \nof the\n&gt; &gt; second or third pass of=\r\n test creation.  Remember that TDD is a\n&gt; &gt; /design/ activity, not a testin=\r\ng activity.  I am afraid that \ngenerated\n&gt; &gt; assertions would break the bas=\r\nic cycle feedback of TDD.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I am not going to tell you not to do this=\r\n project, but calling \nit TDD\n&gt; &gt; would cause me to call into question your=\r\n understanding of TDD.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; chet\n&gt; \n&gt; Agreed, essentially Jim, what you =\r\nare describing (to me at least) \nis\n&gt; automating the unit testing of code. =\r\n It does not sound like TDD.\n&gt; \n&gt; And there&#39;s nothing wrong with that - JUn=\r\nit is a tool that makes no\n&gt; assumptions on what design process we use.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; Indeed, there are already several tools out there that can\n&gt; autogenerate=\r\n JUnit tests for code, and still others that &#39;play&#39; \nwith\n&gt; the byte code t=\r\no see if your unit tests are actually any good at\n&gt; testing.  However, none=\r\n of these tools are aimed at TDD, they are\n&gt; aimed at Unit Testing.\n&gt; \n&gt; ht=\r\nh\n&gt; \n&gt; Good luck with the course\n&gt; \n&gt; Andrew\n&gt;\n\n\n\n",
