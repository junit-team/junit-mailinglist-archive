In short, I could<br/>\n&gt; make @Ignore @BeforeClass declare the class malformed, with specific<br/>\n&gt; directions to the developer about how to accomplish what they want.<br/>\n&gt; Would that meet the actual pain point?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Not bad. You could issue a &quot;doesn&#39;t do what you think it&#39;d do&quot; warning <br/>\nin this case.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It&#39;s of course not impossible to change JUnit to have well-formed,<br/>\n&gt; somewhat well-formed, and not-at-all well-formed classes, but I&#39;m not<br/>\n&gt; yet convinced that there&#39;s pain pushing me in that direction.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Instead of thinking of the well-formedness of the test, just think of <br/>\nthe correct use of the annotation. &quot;@Ignore has no effect here.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  &gt; but at the<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; same time, users are quite logically trying to use @Ignore in a context<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; you didn&#39;t intend, but that nevertheless makes sense to them, and in<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; general.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Very true, and I hadn&#39;t given that enough credit yet.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I feel you: I don&#39;t like to deal with that stuff, either, in general. <br/>\nDamn users.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  &gt; If @Ignore-ing a @Test stops the test from running, then why doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; @Ignore-ing a @Before stop the before from running? This is, perhaps,<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; why I wouldn&#39;t support @Ignore, but would rather just ask the test<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; writer to remove the @Test annotation when he doesn&#39;t want the test to<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; run. I don&#39;t know that @Ignore provides better results than removing the<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; @Test annotation temporarily.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Is this a separate issue? Are you suggesting that, given the choice,<br/>\n&gt; you would not have included @Ignore, with the attendant reminder to<br/>\n&gt; un-@Ignore sometime in the future, in JUnit at all? I&#39;m curious about<br/>\n&gt; that position, but first want to make sure if it is your position.<br/>\n&gt; Thanks,<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I would certainly not have included @Ignore as a decorator annotation of <br/>\n@Test. Especially in light of this, I would want to change it to <br/>\n@IgnoreTest /replacing/ @Test, as that better reveals the intent behind <br/>\nthe annotation. As long-time readers here know about me, I favor <br/>\nfeatures that reflect the intent of JUnit as a TDD tool, and I don&#39;t see <br/>\n@Ignore as reflecting that intent. @Ignore is more of a regression <br/>\ntesting feature.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ.
