The project we are\nworking on involves taking initial code from an\nexternal vendor,  writing tests for it and then adding\nnew functions onto it.   We initially investigated\nRaccoon and Tibco but found that it was a little\nbuggy.   We are very keen to continue on the path of\nJunit, Tibco etc.  At the moment we have a rather\ncrude automated testing framework that compares log\nfiles using other technologies such as ant, text file\ncomparison utility to test IM workflows.  We are\ncurrently looking at how to test adapters and make\nsure they are successful.  Are you contributing the\nRacoon code back to the site or not.  Let me know and\nI can send you some more information.  Where are you\nbased?  \n\nRegards\n\nJonathan Howard\n\n\n\n\n--- darkblueavenger &lt;darkblueavenger@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hi Howard,\n&gt; \n&gt; We&#39;re using jUnit, Raccoon and TIBCO Active\n&gt; Enterprise currently in \n&gt; our projet.\n&gt; We&#39;re busy extending the jUnit extensions found in\n&gt; Raccoon so as to \n&gt; test the full TIB/IM workflows in an automated\n&gt; fashion\n&gt; Currently we&#39;re delving on having xml config files\n&gt; to have Raccoon \n&gt; send and record intermediate steps.\n&gt; \n&gt; What are you doing ?\n&gt; \n&gt;In junit@y..., &quot;jlhoward_nz&quot; &lt;jlhoward_nz@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Has anybody being using JUNIT to test EAI projects like Tibco or\n&gt; Vitria or MQ series.  We are currently building a framework around\n&gt; Tinco using Junit and racoon and would be most interested in swapping\n&gt; notes and improving the community with some good knowledge.\n\n\n\n",
