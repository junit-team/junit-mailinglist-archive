Running TestNG programmatically<br/>\n&gt;&gt;is as simple as<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;TestNG tng = new TestNG();<br/>\n&gt;&gt;tng.addTestClass(...);<br/>\n&gt;&gt;tng.addListener(...);<br/>\n&gt;&gt;tng.run();<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Generating a temporary XML file in the Eclipse and IDEA plug-ins is a choice<br/>\n&gt;&gt;made by their respective authors, and it has pros and cons.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Either way, I&#39;m not sure how this implementation detail impacts the user...<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Did this cause you any trouble?<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   I knew you&#39;d respond... Anyway, it does not cause me any trouble <br/>\n&gt; except responding to your comments, because I don&#39;t use TestNG. I guess <br/>\n&gt; this is mostly because I like existing tools for junit much better <br/>\n&gt; (especially look of the reports I get from ant tasks, cc build and few <br/>\n&gt; others)... If I&#39;ll have to write another plugin for Eclipse to run <br/>\n&gt; TestNG, because look of the current one hurt my eyes. :-)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Any suggestions are appreciated. We have tried to keep it in the same line as JUnit plugin.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   By the way, did anyone bothered to check the temporary directory after <br/>\n&gt; long time of using TestNG?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Temporary directory? The plugin does nothing there. The temp files are created in the project <br/>\ndirectory (or a better option I have in mind is to move them in the output dir). However I don&#39;t <br/>\nthink this is a real worry as way to many software are using this solution (take Idea, Acrobat <br/>\nReader, etc. as examples).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   After all, don&#39;t you think that it is much slower to create temporary <br/>\n&gt; file, especially when you don&#39;t really need it? <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If somebody comes out with an example where this file writting is increasing the execution time <br/>\ninnexplicably I will try to find out some other solution immediately.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;d understand if you <br/>\n&gt; would have an action to copy such xml to the clipboard, so one can paste <br/>\n&gt; it into email or issue tracker...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You can save it for later tests or don&#39;t know, submit it to your friend to redo the exactly test you <br/>\nhave run.<br/>\n<br/>\ncheers,<br/>\n<br/>\n./alex<br/>\n--<br/>\n.w( the_mindstorm )p.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;   regards,<br/>\n&gt;   Eugene<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
