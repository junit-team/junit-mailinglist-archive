However, an ABORTED test might be a surprise to the user: the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; test assumes that it is connected to the network, and that assumption<br/>\n&gt; &gt; failed.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Splitting out these states might allow tools depending on the test<br/>\n&gt; &gt; runs to take different actions based on the different results.  For<br/>\n&gt; &gt; example, ABORTED tests might be treated similarly to IGNORED tests<br/>\n&gt; &gt; during development, but would prevent check-in or deployment.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; This raises three very different questions:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; (1) Should we have these 4 states, or stick with our current 3?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; (2) If we choose to have 4 states, what&#39;s the best name for the new state?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; (3) Are assumption failures, by default, to be treated as IGNORED, or ABORTED?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; It might be good to get these decisions made, and move on.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   David Saff<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; On Sun, Sep 18, 2011 at 8:10 PM, Stefan Birkner &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mail@...\">mail@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Currently the Result class simply ignores testAssumptionFailure.
