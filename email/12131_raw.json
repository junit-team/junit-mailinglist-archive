Does anyone have any book recommendations to help with=\r\n \n&gt;&gt; industry accepted terms and definitions? I have seen \n&gt;references to &quot;=\r\nThe \n&gt;&gt; Art of Software Testing&quot; by Glenford Myers that describe it as the =\r\n\n&gt;&gt; seminal work on the matter. Is that book worth getting? Is there a \n&gt;&gt; =\r\nwebsite anywhere that has &quot;standard&quot; definitions that my \n&gt;co-workers and \n=\r\n&gt;&gt; I can use for enlightenment on this matter?\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; All wisdom on this ma=\r\ntter will be greatly appreciated.\n&gt;\n&gt;Here&#39;s wisdom that nevertheless doesn&#39;=\r\nt help you: it doesn&#39;t matter.\n\nJB, that&#39;s good wisdom, but you&#39;re right, i=\r\nt doesn&#39;t answer my question.\n\n&gt;If they&#39;re getting hung up on what words me=\r\nan in some ethereal objective \n&gt;sense, rather than simply finding a workabl=\r\ne vocabulary to help with \n&gt;their current discussion, then I have to wonder=\r\n whether they \n&gt;care about \n&gt;communicating at all.\n\nWe actually are working=\r\n on the shared vocabiulary at this time, which is why I asked. I would pref=\r\ner that we use accepted terminology, but I need some definitive source to s=\r\nhow people, so that they will accept it. Otherwise, we&#39;ll be using the term=\r\ninology that the process police give us. :-(\n\nRemember: large companies don=\r\n&#39;t do anything until they&#39;ve defined what they&#39;re gonna call everything.\n\nY=\r\nou know you&#39;re up against an interesting challenge, when one of the questio=\r\nns from an attendee is &quot;What&#39;s a unit?&quot;\n\nSimon\n\n",
