The problem was one<br/>\nof the stupid errors that&#39;s incredibly obvious after you see it.<br/>\nThe search path described in the documentation mentions junit.jar.<br/>\nSo, of course, I initially had a path that specified junit.jar<br/>\nwithout also listing the home directory.  I erroneously thought<br/>\nthat the test classes would be found automatically, but of course<br/>\nthe search must see<br/>\n$JUNIT_HOME:$JUNIT_HOME/junit.jar<br/>\nin order to find *both* TestRunner and the test classes.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is so obvious in hindsight I feel terribly silly.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry for having wasted the time and bandwidth.  I&#39;ll try to<br/>\nask less trivial questions in the future.</div>",
