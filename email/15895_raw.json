This is exactly \nwhat we need to make sure that JUnit 4 will meet users&#39; needs.  Just to \ngive you an idea of what you can expect:\n\nBen Maurer wrote:\n&gt; Ant XML output\n&gt; --------------\n&gt; [...]\n&gt; However, in rc2, it looks like:\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;testcase classname=&quot;junit.framework.JUnit4TestAdapterCache$2$1&quot; \n&gt; name=&quot;unknown&quot; time=&quot;0.018&quot;&gt;&lt;/testcase&gt;\nThat doesn&#39;t look good, does it?  If my initial guess as to this bug&#39;s \nsource is correct, this will be easily fixed (back to rc1&#39;s behavior, at \nleast) soon.\n&gt; Stack Trace Filtering\n&gt; ---------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; The stack trace from junit messages have always been filed with junit.*\n&gt; traces. Ant filters these out. However, now there are org.junit things\n&gt; slipping through. Also, tests with a timeout, have many\n&gt; java.util.concurrent frames in them. Why leave this kind of filtering up\n&gt; to each tool? JUnit should filter out the frames it knows are from it.\n&gt; This would make command line output look nicer. I think NUnit does this.\nThis is tricky.  The JUnit API actually reports the Exception objects to \nthe tools, which are then responsible for displaying / parsing stack \ntraces.  I don&#39;t know that there&#39;s anything we could do to make \npre-JUnit 4 tools automatically filter the org.junit lines, but we might \nlook at something for the future.\n&gt; @Test(expected=) traces\n&gt; -----------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; When you have an expected exception, and another one gets thrown, the\n&gt; error trace doesn&#39;t contain the bad exception. You only get:\n&gt;\n&gt; java.lang.AssertionError: Unexpected exception, \n&gt; expected&lt;java.util.NoSuchElementException&gt; but \n&gt; was&lt;java.lang.NullPointerException&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Having the trace of the bad exception would help TAs debug student code. \nThat&#39;s a good idea.  We&#39;ll try to have that in the next release.\n\nThanks again--let us know what other issues you see, and good luck with \nthe class!\n\n    David Saff\n\n",
