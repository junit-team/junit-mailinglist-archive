Non classic solution is to return to a composer a recordset object <br/>\n&gt; and put on the composer&#39;s shoulders to fetch it, surround by specific <br/>\n&gt; info and put out. This resolves memory wasting problem but tights two <br/>\n&gt; different activities together.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And couldn&#39;t you do this with a proxy (say a specialised recordset<br/>\nwrapper), so that you still have the decoupling of fetching information<br/>\nfrom the DB, from the building of the report.  The composer thus still<br/>\nfocuses solely on building a report, whereas the Data Object (my proxy)<br/>\ncan focus on getting data out from a store (DB, filesystem, ...).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Does it mean that every time a unit test can&#39;t be written for a <br/>\n&gt; function the function must be refactored?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>On this one, I will agree with the responses you have already received:<br/>\na design that allows for easy unit testing, usually also benefits from<br/>\nthe side-effects of low coupling, high cohesion, etc.  You have to<br/>\nbalance the work of undertaking the refactoring, with the benefits:  how<br/>\nlong do you expect to be maintaining that function/method; is this a one<br/>\noff, or further changes are expected for this functionality; ...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nManuel Amago.<br/>\nmailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mamago@...\">mamago@...</a></div>",
