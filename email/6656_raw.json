Both are put together into an ear for deployment \nto the app server. \n\nI&#39;d much prefer to keep the build process and structure for the unit \ntest ears as similar to the production ears as possible. This means \n*not* packaging everything under WEB-INF/lib, but keeping our current \nstructure. \n\nI&#39;d like to use the Smart Test Mode, but have resorted to the \ntestCase.txt file route. I can get it to pick up the txt file and \ndisplay it, but can&#39;t get it to find the associated test cases as \nthey&#39;re in the ejb.jar. I&#39;d prefer to use the Smart Test mode for \nease of use. So, how do I spec the path within the searchResources \ntarget ?, ie :\n      &lt;param-name&gt;searchResources&lt;/param-name&gt;\n      &lt;param-value&gt;test.jar&lt;/param-value&gt;\n\nThanks in advance for any help\n\nScott\n    \n\n\n",
