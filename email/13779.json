For example, to a programmer the message that there&#39;s a <br/>\nstack overflow error in the resolveXInclude() method is very useful <br/>\ninformation. A competent programmer knows how to respond to that. <br/>\nHowever &quot;stack overflow&quot; is gibberish to a typical end user. They do not <br/>\nunderstand it, and they can&#39;t plausibly do anything about it. Before <br/>\npresenting the problem to an end user it should be written in language <br/>\nthey understand. In this case, that would probably be something like, <br/>\n&quot;The programmers who wrote this software screwed up. We&#39;re sorry. It&#39;s <br/>\nnot your fault. Would you like to send a bug report to the development <br/>\nteam?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIn other cases such as an IOException, the cause might well not be a <br/>\nprogrammer error. However, the error message should still be written <br/>\nwith a focus on what the user is doing and what that particular <br/>\nexception means in that particular context. For instance, if an editor <br/>\nsuch as OpenOffice or Adobe Illustrator reads an XML document and <br/>\ndiscovers it to be malformed, it should not simply tell the user that an <br/>\nattribute value is missing a quote on line 232. Again, that&#39;s not <br/>\nsomething that makes sense to an end user. However the developer of the <br/>\nsoftware would likely understand such a message and find it useful. <br/>\nProgrammers and end users do not need the same information about problems.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nElliotte Rusty Harold  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:elharo@...\">elharo@...</a><br/>\nXML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/\">http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim\">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim</a></div>",
