Spend enough time with it, and it doesn&#39;t feel completely\n&gt; foreign, but it&#39;s not really Java.  The main driver for this is that a test\n&gt; is a named block, and reflectively-retrieved methods have, until now, been\n&gt; by far the cheapest syntactic way to create a named block.\n&gt;\n&gt; With lambdas, you can now enable an even cheaper named-block syntax:\n&gt;\n&gt; test(&quot;Here&#39;s my test name&quot;, () -&gt; {\n&gt;   assertTheRightThings();\n&gt; });\n&gt;\n&gt; Now, rather than having to enable all kinds of weird annotation-driven\n&gt; extension schemes, extensions can be built in the natural Java way, through\n&gt; function composition and inheritance.  Create a paramTest function, and\n&gt; you&#39;ve got parameterized tests:\n&gt;\n&gt; paramTest(&quot;Name&quot;, computeParameters(), (param1, param2) -&gt; {\n&gt;    assertTheRightThing(param1, param2);\n&gt; }\n&gt;\n&gt; Push further, and the line between assertions and tests begins to look a\n&gt; little fuzzy.  I&#39;m not sure what lies beyond that particular quantum limit,\n&gt; though.  :-)\n&gt;\n&gt; FYI, note that QUnit is a JavaScript test framework that does take this\n&gt; approach (http://qunitjs.com/cookbook/).\n&gt;\n&gt; In general, the first few test frameworks that get released for a language\n&gt; often include at least one whose chief advantage is its familiarity for\n&gt; XUnit users*; later, many users often settle into a framework that fits the\n&gt; grain of the language better.  Since I&#39;ve never been able to figure out\n&gt; what the grain of JavaScript is, I can&#39;t say which frameworks are in which\n&gt; camp.\n&gt;\n&gt;    David Saff\n&gt;\n&gt; *  (the most extreme example being .NET: NUnit&#39;s first release was a\n&gt; method-name-for-method-name clone of JUnit (3.7?), down to methods designed\n&gt; to detect if the test was running on the quirky VisualAge VM, which had no\n&gt; .NET equivalent)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; On Thu, Jan 10, 2013 at 12:05 PM, Kevin Cooney &lt;kcooney@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; **\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; On Jan 10, 2013 8:21 AM, &quot;tibord47&quot; tibord47@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Jens,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I have to only agree.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The time is getting still shorter for Java 8 release, and thus missing\n&gt; it\n&gt; &gt; would mean that JUnit as a nice framework will be too old.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Too old? Really?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I think we have some time. There was some delay between TestNG being\n&gt; &gt; released and the release of JUnit 4.0, but JUnit 4 still got adopted.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Also agree with David that watching the steps of other new frameworks\n&gt; is\n&gt; &gt; important as well.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I was thinking about that. JavaScript is a functional language, but all\n&gt; of\n&gt; &gt; the JS test frameworks that I am aware of use JUnit-like syntax for\n&gt; &gt; defining test cases (JsUnit defines test functions at global scope,\n&gt; &gt; JsTestDriver uses methods on a class). If functional programming could\n&gt; &gt; change the paradigm for defining tests, you would think it would have\n&gt; &gt; happened in JavaScript.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Am I missing something?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sure, you could use functional programming to write more powerful\n&gt; &gt; assertions, but that could be done in an assertion framework.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The places I see where functional programming could help are Theories\n&gt; &gt; and parametrised tests. I think we could do that in JUnit4 with at most a\n&gt; &gt; new core Runner.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sure, there are many parts of the implementation of JUnit 4 that I would\n&gt; &gt; love to change, but building a new Java test framework from scratch would\n&gt; &gt; be a large effort. One often-forgotten piece is all the tooling (IDE\n&gt; &gt; integration, build tool integration, etc).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; - Kevin\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The modularity, as somebody mentioned, has to be also considered, but\n&gt; &gt; without knowing the outcome it is quite difficult.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; So perhaps template tests under new languages without having a\n&gt; framework\n&gt; &gt; should be written first to see what wants to be reached.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Features and goals from other projects should be considered.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; BR, Tibor\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;jens_schauder&quot; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It looks like Closure will finally find their way into Java. With\n&gt; this\n&gt; &gt; feature many nice ways to do thing become possible. Therefore I am\n&gt; &gt; wondering if other people agree that it might be time for a JUnit5\n&gt; putting\n&gt; &gt; this new feature to good use.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A source for inspiration for me in this regard are the FunSuite of\n&gt; &gt; ScalaTest http://www.scalatest.org/getting_started_with_fun_suite\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There a test definition is a method call (instead of a method\n&gt; &gt; definition in JUnit) that registers a test for execution. It looks\n&gt; roughly\n&gt; &gt; like this:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; class MyTestClass{\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; test(&quot;The test name&quot;){\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; // the actual test goes here\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; }\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; }\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; With this approach things like Rules become extremly trivial, since\n&gt; all\n&gt; &gt; you have to do is wrap the code block (i.e. closure) in a new new code\n&gt; &gt; block.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Also parameterized test become fairly easy, because you would just\n&gt; put\n&gt; &gt; the call to test in a loop.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What do you think? Is this an interesting direction for JUnit to go?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; kind regards\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Jens\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
