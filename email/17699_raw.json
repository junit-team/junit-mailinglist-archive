Until you know what you need to open and why \nyou need to open it, keep it closed. That is humility. Do not assume you \ncan guess what will and will not be useful without foreknowledge of how \nthe library will be used.\n\n&gt; Assume that people will use it in ways you didn&#39;t think of,\n&gt; and make it possible for them to do so in ways that you control (always an\n&gt; interesting exercise, by the way, it forces you to think out of the box and\n&gt; to break your habits).\n&gt; \n&gt; Michael showed a pretty compelling case where the vendor forgot to make\n&gt; their methods virtual, and I&#39;ve seen this mistake and more general ones so\n&gt; many times in dozens of API&#39;s and libraries I wish people locked down their\n&gt; code a lot less.\n\nYou seem to be assuming that a library is a fixed piece of code that can \nnever change. That isn&#39;t the case. When a new need arises, new features \ncan be added to the library to support it. However, some changes are \neasier than others. I don&#39;t know C++ well enough to know if it&#39;s easy or \nhard to change a function from non-virtual to virtual. However the \nequivalent in Java (final to non-final) is straightforward. The reverse \noperation is not. Be very cautious before committing to an irreversible \noperation.\n\nClosed doors can be opened, but open doors cannot be closed. If you \nlater discover that you didn&#39;t design the API quite right, take the \nright arguments, set the proper preconditions, or generally do the right \nthing, it&#39;s really hard to fix it. Too much code already depends on the \nold, buggy, poorly designed behavior.\n\nBecause I am humble and know that I do not know how people will use my \ncode, I restrict myself to what I do know. I limit myself to the \nsimplest thing that could possibly work until it&#39;s obvious that my \nsolution no longer can work, and a more complex solution is necessary.\n\n-- \n﻿Elliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nJava I/O 2nd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeaulait.org/books/javaio2/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596527500/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/\n\n",
