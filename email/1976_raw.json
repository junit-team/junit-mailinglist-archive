I&#39;m quite new to JUnit and Java but have used the C++\n&gt; equivalent for some time.\n&gt; I&#39;m using JDK 1.3.1 for Linux.\n&gt; The junit package is downloaded and installed it on my local filesystem.\n&gt; Two things:\n&gt; 1) The junit documentation tells you to include junit.jar in\n&gt; CLASSPATH, but apparently javac for 1.3.1 is indifferent to CLASSPATH\n&gt; and I could only make it work by specifying &quot;javac -classpath\n&gt; ~/blabla/junit.jar&quot;.\n&gt; 2)The junit.jar file is apparently compiled especially for JDK 1.2.2 -\n&gt; alas I could not compile with javac. I found out that &quot;oldjavac&quot; and\n&gt; &quot;oldjava&quot; did work and so I&#39;m using them instead but this seems like a\n&gt; wrong way to solve things.\n&gt;\n&gt; I think all these problems could be solved with a junit.jar that is\n&gt; compiled for 1.3.1 but haven&#39;t been able to find one. Is anyone aware\n&gt; of a place where one can download this?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks\n&gt; /Tim\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
