I&#39;m all\n&gt; too familar with seemingly clever ideas that fail badly when a project\n&gt; gets large and would prefer to learn from other people&#39;s mistakes.\n\nAdding to the thread already in progress:\n\nHaving the testcases in inner classes complicates dependency tracking  \nand can force unnecessary builds. To some extent, this depends on how  \nsmart the compiler/dependency tracker is. If you have a class which is  \nreasonably central to your project and you change a separate test file,  \nthen the test file is the only thing that gets rebuilt. If the tests  \nare in the java file, then other dependent classes may get rebuilt even  \nif you are only changing the tests (e.g. adding a new testcase). With  \nthe tests in separate files, I can refactor tests without having to  \nrebuild or even touch the code itself. When I am refactoring tests, I  \nwant to be able to recompile/rerun after every tiny change and  \nturn-around time is important.\n\nSimilarly,  version control logs are more clear. I can readily separate  \ncode changes from test changes. Pure refactoring should not change  \ntests. Test refactoring or coverage improvement should not change code.  \nAll other changes should touch both.\n\nI find that the hit is even larger for documentation generation than  \nfor compiling the code. I prefer to have the docs automatically update  \nafter every code change.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks in advance.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
