I&#39;d be\n&gt;&gt; interested to hear a little more about your goals, to see if a different\n&gt;&gt; approach more along JUnit&#39;s grain might be what you need.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; For example, most of my test classes do not include @BeforeClass or\n&gt;&gt; @AfterClass, and many do not have @After.  You&#39;ll also have the issue\n&gt;&gt; that @BeforeClass and @AfterClass need to be on static methods which\n&gt;&gt; cannot be abstract.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; That said, depending on your goals, the following approach _might_ be\n&gt;&gt; useful:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; public abstract class ApiTestBase\n&gt;&gt; {\n&gt;&gt;   @Before public void preTest() { doPreTest(); }\n&gt;&gt;   public abstract void doPreTest();\n&gt;&gt;   // etc\n&gt;&gt; }\n&gt;&gt;     \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; This approaches pretty much defeats the purpose of annotations, doesn&#39;t it?\n&gt;   \n\nIt seems to me that the original poster&#39;s goal was to accomplish \nsomething that was beyond the purpose of annotations (a compile-time \ncheck that every test class has a @Before method).\n\n&gt; I&#39;ve had to do it many times, as have most TestNG users.\n&gt;   \n\nYou&#39;ve had to do _this_ (a compile-time check that every test class has \na @Before method), or something else that also involves annotations and \ninheritance? If it&#39;s something else, then please post about that \nsomething else on a new thread, and let&#39;s talk about it. If it&#39;s this, \nthen please confirm, because that would be a new data point for me.\n\n&gt; Inheritance of annotations is really handy (and pretty easy to implement), I\n&gt; would strongly suggest you to take a shot at it :-)\n&gt;   \n\n\nJUnit already has some features that involve inheritance and \nannotations, but probably not every conceivable one. If there are \nspecific ones that are missing, let&#39;s talk about them!\n\n\nDavid Saff\n\n",
