I put &quot;public&quot; in quotes because so far we have considered only the inward perspective, looking &quot;in&quot; toward their declarations.  Next, looking outward, I&#39;d like to hear how one prevents them from creeping into the public interface of the system as a whole, which was presumably the point of their being private in the first place.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nLance<br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my iPhone</div>",
