I&#39;m trying to set up a group of tests that runs only under\ncertain circ=\r\numstances. Because they are database tests, they have\nexpensive setup and t=\r\neardown procedures (via DBUnit), so they are\nsegregated to run separately. =\r\nThe way to get that done seems to be via\na separate runner, so I hacked up =\r\na class that looks like this:\n(Inspiration from here:\nhttp://schuchert.wiki=\r\nspaces.com/CustomJunit4RunnerJUnit4_4 but that\nexample no longer applies to=\r\n the 4.5 API):\n\npublic class SlowTestRunner extends Runner {\n\n    private R=\r\nunner runner;\n    private Class&lt;?&gt; klass;\n\n    public SlowTestRunner(Class&lt;=\r\n?&gt; klass, RunnerBuilder builder)\nthrows Throwable {\n        this.klass =3D =\r\nklass;\n        if (Boolean.getBoolean(&quot;RunSlowTests&quot;)) {\n            runner=\r\n =3D getAppropriateRunner(builder);\n        } else {\n            runner =3D=\r\n new IgnoredClassRunner(klass);\n        }\n    }\n\n    private Runner getAppr=\r\nopriateRunner(RunnerBuilder builder) {\n        List&lt;RunnerBuilder&gt; builders=\r\n =3D Arrays.asList(\n                new IgnoredBuilder(),\n                n=\r\new AnnotatedBuilder(builder),\n                new SuiteMethodBuilder(),\n   =\r\n             new JUnit3Builder(),\n                new JUnit4Builder());\n\n  =\r\n      for (RunnerBuilder each : builders) {\n            Runner runner =3D e=\r\nach.safeRunnerForClass(klass);\n            if (runner !=3D null && runner.g=\r\netClass() !=3D this.getClass())\n                return runner;\n        }\n  =\r\n      //this is actually never going to happen, at least in the\ncurrent imp=\r\nlementation because the JUnit4Builder is the Builder of\nlast resort.\n      =\r\n  return new ErrorReportingRunner(klass, new\nInitializationError(&quot;Unable to=\r\n find suitable runner to delegate for &quot;\n+ klass.getName()));\n    }\n\n    pub=\r\nlic Description getDescription() {\n        return runner.getDescription();\n=\r\n    }\n\n    public void run(RunNotifier notifier) {\n        runner.run(notif=\r\nier);\n    }\n}\n\nThe method getAppropriateRunner is basically a copy/paste fr=\r\nom\nAllDefaultPossibilitiesBuilder. I had to copy paste because the\nprotecte=\r\nd method forced a return of an AnnotatedBuilder, instead of\njust a RunnerBu=\r\nilder, so overriding wasn&#39;t working well. Note the case\nhere is that I&#39;m no=\r\nt sure if the class is a JUnit3 or 4 class, and I\nwant to support both with=\r\n one runner.\n\nAt first I tried to just do a runnerForClass on builder passe=\r\nd to the\nconstructor, but that causes an infinite loop, because the class h=\r\nas\nthe RunWith annotation on it that references the very same Runner.\n\nAm I=\r\n correct that the API isn&#39;t naturally supporting what I am trying\nto do, or=\r\n is there another way to accomplish this?\n\n\n",
