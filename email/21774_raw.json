There should indeed be a better way to do this.\nI=\r\nnterceptors have proven an impressively good model for modifying the\nbehavi=\r\nor of test methods, and a reasonable model for class\ninterceptors is coming=\r\n to mind.  Imagine this:\n\n@RunWith(Suite.class)\n@SuiteClases({A.class, B.cl=\r\nass, C.class...})\npublic class ABCSuite {\n   @ClassInterceptor Parallelize =\r\nparallelize =3D Parallelize.classesAndMethods();\n}\n\nOne line to do what you=\r\n want (although an unwieldy line at that...)\n\nWould that do the trick?\n\n   =\r\nDavid Saff\n\nOn Thu, Jun 18, 2009 at 11:39 PM, krosenvold&lt;kristian@rosenvold=\r\n.com&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Oh, sorry for not providing any good context here ;)\n&gt;\n&gt; My =\r\nreal goal is to get parallelization of *any* sort running within maven2. Th=\r\nis is because our automated build uses it; if I was able to get parallel te=\r\nst-methods it&#39;d cut the run-time of our long-running builds to about a thir=\r\nd. If I could get classes too I&#39;d probably aim for world-record swamping of=\r\n our 16-core build server ;) Reducing wall-clock execution time of all our =\r\nbuilds is a priority concern.\n&gt;\n&gt; For our daily work we use IntelliJ idea v=\r\n8, and while certainly &quot;nice to have&quot; the value of parallel tests in the de=\r\nvelopment environment is less glaringly obvious.\n&gt;\n&gt; I was looking around i=\r\nn the git-snapshot of junit-4.7 code, trying to determine how/if I could do=\r\n this. It seems to me like there&#39;s two basic approaches as to how to achiev=\r\ne this:\n&gt;\n&gt; To get parallelization for classes you need to mess around with=\r\n the runner. I&#39;m not totally familiar/comfortable with how this would be do=\r\nne.\n&gt;\n&gt; For parallel methods it seems like one *should* be able to specify =\r\na &quot;Computer&quot; on the &quot;@RunWith&quot; annotation; it even seems like a logical con=\r\nfiguration point for this information.\n&gt;\n&gt; I know this may be slightly off-=\r\ntopic, but I feel several &quot;tensions&quot; in the code-base around the &quot;Computer&quot;=\r\n. Is this still largely work in progress?\n&gt;\n&gt; Kristian\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In=\r\n junit@yahoogroups.com, David Saff &lt;david@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Kristian,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n 1) Can you use the 4.7 snapshot?\n&gt;&gt; 2) Are you trying to parallelize metho=\r\nds within a class, classes\n&gt;&gt; within a suite, or both?\n&gt;&gt; 3) What are you u=\r\nsing to run the tests?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; =A0 =A0David Saff\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; On Thu, Jun 18, 2009 a=\r\nt 6:07 AM, krosenvold&lt;kristian@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Using a RunnerBuilder and a=\r\n Computer, the JUNIT 4.7 Request class creates the Runner object.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n I am currently using @RunWith(SpringJUnit4ClassRunner.class) (from spring =\r\n3.0 rc) and I&#39;m trying to shoehorn parallel running into this regime, but i=\r\nt seems to me like these two designs are now fairly orthogonal.
