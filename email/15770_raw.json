Once that is in place we will \njavadoc everything, package it, and deploy.&quot;  We thought about it, and \nrealized that what this really meant was\n\n1) JUnit&#39;s extension mechanism should be so powerful that test suites \ncan be just another extension. \n2) Extensions should work seamlessly with IDE test runners, meaning\n    a) Since IDE&#39;s and UI&#39;s like to display the names of tests before \nthey&#39;re run, and match up successes and failures with these names, there \nmust be a standard way to display the components of an extended test suite.\n    b) There should be a standard way to run just a single method from a \ntest class, with extension-defined setup and teardown behavior\n    c) JUnit 4 should respond gracefully to user cancellation requests \nthat come in the middle of a run\n3) Extensions should work seamlessly with JUnit 3 test runners\n4) There should be a simple API for running test classes, sets of test \nclasses, single test methods, and any other test specification.\n\nTo support these goals, we needed the following concepts:\n\n- Runner.  An extension to JUnit will likely define a custom subclass of \nRunner.\n- Plan.  Each Runner must report a Plan, a hierarchical tree of the \nnames of the tests it will run.  Test events are reported with respect \nto leaves in this tree.\n- Request.  A Request is a specification of the desired tests to be \nrun.  Extensions may also define custom subclasses of Request, in order \nto, for example, read tests to be run out of an XML file--if you think \nthat&#39;s a good idea. :-)\n\nThere is an important distinction between Requests and Plans.  A Request \nmight be &quot;Please run all tests in class ValidationTest&quot;, with the \ncorresponding Plan being &quot;I will run methods foo, bar, baz, and foobar \nin class ValidationTest&quot;.\n\nAgain, nothing has changed about the basic annotation-based test \ndefinition API, so your existing test cases still work.  A revised \noverview of the packages and classes as they stand now, and how to run a \nJUnit 4 test using a JUnit 3 runner, is at\n\nhttp://people.csail.mit.edu/saff/junit4.0rc2api.txt\n\nWe believe that this robust extensibility, explicit IDE support, \nbackward compatibility, and simple API are worth the extra time you&#39;ve \nwaited.  We&#39;re very interested in feedback.  To try things out, you can \ndownload the code from CVS, or, for a limited time only, download a \nlist-members-only distribution from\n\nhttp://people.csail.mit.edu/saff/junit4.0rc2.zip\n\nWe&#39;re especially interested in:\n1) Results of running JUnit 4 tests with various JUnit 3 runners.\n2) Experiences using JUnit 4 to write tests.\n3) New Runners and Requests.\n\nRemember that this is not the final release--the implementation and API \nmay still change as we respond to your comments and shake loose the \nremaining issues.  Thanks,\n\n    David Saff\n\n",
