To have the rule working in severa=\r\nl tests, you have to place the Rule in each test.\n&gt; \n&gt; However, I am search=\r\ning for a way to activate a Rule for all the tests that are executed, witho=\r\nut needing to add the rule to each test. Perhaps by specifying a Java prope=\r\nrty parameter when running the tests (I could also set this as a global Jav=\r\na option, therefore being used upon each execution of the JVM). \n&gt; \n&gt; Do yo=\r\nu know if this is possible?\n&gt; \n&gt; The reason why I need this, is: I am makin=\r\ng the plans and gathering the ideas for creating a simple Swing application=\r\n that will display the results of the executed tests (just like the JUnit v=\r\niew in Eclipse/Idea/Netbeans, but perhaps with more details, and also avail=\r\nable for anyone, not just IDE users). Currently I developed a small agent r=\r\nule, that you can place in your test, and it will report to the console the=\r\n status of your tests (the Swing console runs remotely).\n&gt; \n&gt; This is ok, b=\r\nut it means that you will have to add this rule to each and every test that=\r\n you have. It also means that will not be an easy task to disable this rule=\r\n, if you don&#39;t want it anymore.\n&gt; \n&gt; Therefore a possibility to enable Rule=\r\ns globally for all tests I think is the best solution for my case, and also=\r\n a good tool to have for various other tasks.\n&gt; \n&gt; What do you think? Also,=\r\n what do you think about the Swing console idea?\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; Bogdan\n&gt;\n\n\n=\r\n\n",
