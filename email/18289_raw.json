B. Rainsberger&quot; &lt;jbrains762@...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Tracey Annison wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; So I don&#39;t see how you can write a test class that has failing tests\n&gt; &gt; that move over to passing tests as you write the code, (as I see TDD\n&gt; &gt; asking for) when the thing you&#39;re testing doesn&#39;t exist yet. I guess\n&gt; &gt; you could code in all the skeleton of the class, with the methods &\n&gt; &gt; such (though this won&#39;t compile unless you really do return what you\n&gt; &gt; say you will), then write the tests, then add the rest of the code.\n&gt; &gt; But I don&#39;t see the great advantage of that, to be honest...\n&gt;\n&gt; I write the test, then use Eclipse to generate classes, interfaces and\n&gt; method stubs as I go. When the test compiles, I run it to watch it\nfail.\n&gt; This way I know my test actually tests /something/. Only then do I\nmake\n&gt; it pass.\n&gt;\n&gt; When I do this, I get the opportunity to see my code in black and\nwhite\n&gt; on the screen. I get to ask myself, &quot;Is the design any good?&quot; or more\n&gt; correctly, &quot;Does the design suck in an obvious way?&quot; I&#39;m surprised how\n&gt; often it does. :) It&#39;s often not until I have to /use/ the API that I\n&gt; realize it sucks.\n&gt;\n&gt; So that&#39;s how I do it. I tried writing the skeleton code, then writing\n&gt; the test, but I found I couldn&#39;t easily enough track in my head the\ncode\n&gt; I needed for the test I wanted to write, so I decided to let the test\n&gt; pull the code out of me. It works for me.\n&gt;\n&gt; Take care.\n&gt; --\n&gt; J. B. (Joe) Rainsberger :: http://www.jbrains.ca\n&gt; Your guide to software craftsmanship\n&gt; JUnit Recipes: Practical Methods for Programmer Testing\n&gt; 2005 Gordon Pask Award for contribution Agile Software Practice\n&gt;\n\nTracey --\nJust want to add a tidbit of clarification to J.B.&#39;s response (I may\nstating the obvious, but nonetheless).\n\nFrom the sounds of your initial post, it sounds that possibly you intend\nto write many tests at once [&quot;..code the skeleton..with the\nmethods..then write the tests..&quot;].  There is a fundamental rule of TDD\nto write one and only one failing test at a time and make that pass\nbefore moving on to the next test.\n\nThis is very important because it will encourage you to constantly\nrefactor, enabling your brain to evolve a much cleaner overall design as\nyou go.  In addition, this tends to make the task of &quot;getting the test\nto compile&quot; much less tedious, as you will need to add at the very most\nonly a single class and a single method.\n\nHope that helps.\n   -- MB\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n",
