A developer\n&gt; should not release=\r\n code that they haven&#39;t tested.  They should not\n&gt; release a line of code t=\r\nhat they have not tested.  Every line, every\n&gt; statement, every condition s=\r\nhould be tested before the developer\n&gt; releases the code.  It seems to me t=\r\nhat&#39;s a minimum professional\n&gt; standard.  Releasing code that you have not =\r\nthoroughly tested is,\n&gt; simply, unprofessional.\n\n\nThat&#39;s a bit extreme, but=\r\n not contradictory with what I said earlier.\n\nI can&#39;t really think of any p=\r\nroject I worked on where I knew deep inside\nthat 100% of the code I or my c=\r\nolleagues wrote was tested.  It&#39;s a fact of\nlife:  we never ship the produc=\r\nt we want, and at some point, we need to draw\nthe line.\n\nDevelopers need to=\r\n test their code, but I&#39;m a bit more lenient on &quot;how&quot; they\ndo it.  Ideally,=\r\n I&#39;d like them to use TDD, but if they can make a reasonable\ncase for not d=\r\noing TDD, I&#39;ll be fine with it as long as they provide\nreasonable tests.\n\nT=\r\nhere is also another aspect that is often overlooked in the kind of\ndiscuss=\r\nion we&#39;re having right now:  QA departments.\n\nOpen source projects are idea=\r\nl Petri dishes:  if the developers are the\nbleeding edge kind, they will ty=\r\npically write code and supply 100% of the\ntests.  Things are quite differen=\r\nt in the industry and it&#39;s very common to\nsee engineering and QA share the =\r\nload of testing.  When you start factoring\nthis in, the impact of TDD becom=\r\nes harder to quantify.\n\nAt the very least, I expect developers to write &quot;pa=\r\nssing&quot; tests for their\ncode, but after this, it&#39;s quite common to see these=\r\n tests passed along to\nQA which will expand on them and bring their own min=\r\ndset and experience.\n\nI have been fortunate to work with very talented QA e=\r\nngineers who were\nabsolutely brilliant at improving the tests initially sup=\r\nplied by the\ndevelopers, and obviously, TDD is quite irrelevant for these Q=\r\nA departments\nsince the code has already been written.\n\n-- \nC=E9dric\n\n\n[Non=\r\n-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
