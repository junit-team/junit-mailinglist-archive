People will always distrust the &quot;the code passes all my\n&gt; tests therefore it&#39;s clean&quot; line because they won&#39;t trust me to write\n&gt; rigourous tests to find fault with my code.   And of course they&#39;re right:\n&gt; not because I&#39;m untrustworthy, merely sometimes overconfident about my code.\n&gt; That&#39;s why we need QA bods to test our code.\n\nLack of code ownership helps this some. I may be overconfident about my\ncode, but the next person who works on that unit won&#39;t be and will add\ntests as they learn about it. Using coverage analysis tools sparingly also\nhelps. Many XP groups will stop and take day for just refactoring every so\noften. This is a good time to do some coverage analysis and maybe run some\nother design quality metrics and discuss the output.\n\n&gt; In your situation maybe you could adapt the XP Pair-programming technique so\n&gt; that you have a developer and a QA-er writing test suites together.  The QA\n&gt; gains visibility of the tests, the developer has an objective set of tests\n&gt; that they have to get green.\n&gt;\n&gt; Although I don&#39;t hold out much hope: I&#39;ve tried to interest people here in\n&gt; &quot;Pair programming&quot; and you would have thought I proposing something dirty -\n&gt; in fact I would probably have got less of an adverse reaction if I *had*\n&gt; proposed something dirty ;P\n\nApproach it slowly. When a good programmer runs into trouble, they will\nsit down with someone else and pair program through it naturally, without\nthinking about it. Encourage this. Also encourage your experienced\nprogrammers to sit down with the inexperienced ones and pair program with\nthem to help them through specific problems or learn particular techniques\n(as a teaching exercise). You can generally get this far without much\nresistance and you&#39;ve already got a good bit of the benefit.\n\nNext, go to pairing off for cross training (your UNIX guru learns a\nlittle about the Windows APIs for an afternoon). Introduce the concept a\nlittle at a time in situations where it&#39;s benefits are obvious. Once\npeople get used to it, the social stigma starts to fade.\n\nRemember to give your programmers some time and space to explore things by\nthemselves, though, even when they are doing pair programming regularly.\nSome programmers are more solitary by nature and will need that space more\noften. I, for instance, need a certain amount of quiet and solitude every\nwork day to be productive whether I am programming, managing, or team\nlead/coaching.  If you make it clear you aren&#39;t going to take that away,\nyour programmers will be less reluctant to pair off.  Solitary coding time\ncan be used for self-education, prototyping, toolsmithing or research\nwhich can then be brought back into the group.\n\n&gt; Still, it might be worth your while to try.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ve though some more about your problem and logging test failures into\n&gt; Bugzilla (or whatever) is a non-starter.  Consider: new bug logged every\n&gt; time you run the same test and it fails; you have to associate a test with a\n&gt; bug number; once a test passes JUnit has to search the database and update\n&gt; the bug report.\n&gt;\n&gt; If you want something that&#39;s more generally usable you might want to\n&gt; consider something like Silvermark&#39;s TestMentor which comes with lots of\n&gt; graphical goodies and reports :) but isn&#39;t free :(\n&gt;\n&gt; rgds, APC\n&gt;\n&gt; A P Clarke\n&gt; Consultant\n&gt; CMG Admiral UK - Radio Spectrum International\n&gt; Wyndham House\n&gt; 189 Marsh Wall\n&gt; London\n&gt; E14 9SH\n&gt; Tel: +44 (0)20 7211 0603\n&gt; Fax: +44 (0)20 7211 0364\n&gt; Mobile:-----------------------\n&gt; Internet communications are not secure and therefore CMG UK Ltd does not\n&gt; accept legal responsibility for the contents of this message.

Kent says we&#39;re supposed to cycle through the\n&gt; testing and coding stages a few times until our code has no bugs.  So\n&gt; what\n&gt; is there to track?  same goes for integration: providing we&#39;re\n&gt; developing in\n&gt; small enough chunks, of course.\n&gt;\n&gt; Or look at it another way: our failed tests are their own bug\n&gt; trackingdevice.\n&gt;\n&gt; Automatically populating a bug track database from failed tests would\n&gt; only\n&gt; make sense when the people running the tests aren&#39;t the same people who\n&gt; are\n&gt; developing the code, for instance users in UAT or a &quot;black box&quot; testing\n&gt; cell.  I don&#39;t think JUnit is sufficiently abstract for the former but I\n&gt; can\n&gt; see that the latter could be writing their own JUnit suites (if they\n&gt; know\n&gt; Java).  In which case your question is simply a variant on the &quot;How do I\n&gt; log\n&gt; output from JUnit?&quot; question, only instead of writing to a logfile you\n&gt; want\n&gt; to insert the results into an error tracking database.  How difficult\n&gt; that\n&gt; is depends on the database in question: if it&#39;s something proprietary\n&gt; like\n&gt; Merant Tracker I imagine there&#39;ll be a few more problems than if (like\n&gt; us)\n&gt; you&#39;re using a homebrew system based on tables sitting in your\n&gt; development\n&gt; Oracle DB.  The Bugzilla FAQ does say we write to the database using the\n&gt; Mozilla XML API so it would be possible to do, but I think you&#39;ll be\n&gt; lucky\n&gt; to find anyone who&#39;s actually done it :P\n&gt;\n&gt; rgds, APC\n&gt;\n&gt; A P Clarke\n&gt; Consultant\n&gt; CMG Admiral UK - Radio Spectrum International\n&gt; Wyndham House\n&gt; 189 Marsh Wall\n&gt; London\n&gt; E14 9SH\n&gt; Tel: +44 (0)20 7211 0603\n&gt; Fax: +44 (0)20 7211 0364\n&gt; Mobile:-----------------------\n&gt; Internet communications are not secure and therefore CMG UK Ltd does not\n&gt; accept legal responsibility for the contents of this message.
