I want \nto walk through the tree recursively and check the URL at each node. \nIf one of the URLs are corrupted I want to throw a failure or an \nerror and proceed with checking.\n\nWhat I don&#39;t want to have is to fill a Map or something like that, \nwhere I collect corrupted URLs, while I don&#39;t throw a failure each \ntime i foun a bad URL, but printing the corruptedLinksList after \nTestTermination.\nInsted of this, I would like to generate a TestCase for each URL in \nthe tree dynamicaly at runtime and run this TestCase at each URL-node \nof the tree. \nIs this possible? Is there any example, how to do this? Does anyone \nhave any better idea?\n\nHave a nice and peacefull day!\n\n    Wolfgang\n\n\n\n\n",
