To clarify, to load a <br/>\nlicense, I <br/>\n&gt; &gt; would need to have a saved license. The load license would then <br/>\nverify<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that the information that was saved was loaded correctly.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The problem is saving, then loading, then verifying that the loaded<br/>\n&gt; object is equal to what was saved (if I understand your reasoning<br/>\n&gt; correctly) just tests that they you can load what you saved.  It<br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t verify that the format is correct.  Also, the two ate tied<br/>\n&gt; together.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou are understanding me correctly. Except that I&#39;m able to do this:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Instantiate an object.<br/>\n2. Initialize the object with known values.<br/>\n3. Serialize the object.<br/>\n4. Load object into another variable.<br/>\n5. assertEquals on 2 objects.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have implemented equals methods on my classes so if they are not <br/>\nequal (not the same, but equal). In fact, I do some tests on my <br/>\nequals functions by taking 2 objects that should be equal, and also <br/>\ncomparing 2 objects that are not. I also verify that they are not the <br/>\nsame objects (i.e. obj1 == obj2)<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I advise a separate test for each (&quot;advise&quot; because you don&#39;t work <br/>\nfor<br/>\n&gt; me.. if you did, I&#39;d &quot;insist&quot;).  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that&#39;s why I&#39;m here. Trying to learn. In fact, I just got hired <br/>\nby this company and they don&#39;t do ANY testing... I&#39;m trying to move <br/>\nthem forward in this, so I appreciate the tips.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; And don&#39;t use real files if you can<br/>\n&gt; help it.  Use a mocked file for each test.  Save to a mock that <br/>\nknows<br/>\n&gt; what *should* be saved, then verify that that is what was saved.  <br/>\nRead<br/>\n&gt; from a fake that will supply a serialized object in the correct<br/>\n&gt; format, then verify that the loaded object is correct.  If you&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; using Java you can work work with streams and not worry about files <br/>\nat<br/>\n&gt; all.  If the output format is textual (i.e. not binary) you can <br/>\nsimply<br/>\n&gt; supply string streams in the test... Mocks can result in cleaner <br/>\ntest<br/>\n&gt; code, though.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll look into Mocks. I&#39;ve read a little about them, but I&#39;m trying <br/>\nto take baby steps...<br/>\n<br/>\nMy main concern is that the functionality involved serializing to a <br/>\nfile, so I thought I&#39;d need to exercise that in a test (i.e., saving <br/>\nto a known location, then making sure it loads from the same known <br/>\nlocation, etc).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe output is binary, and I&#39;m working with streams all the way until <br/>\nI actually write the file.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again for your tips, and I hope that my emails start arriving <br/>\nsoon.... </span></blockquote></div>",
