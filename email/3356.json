It makes sense that a lot of us<br/>\nwould take an interest in the direction of junit development since we&#39;re all<br/>\ndevelopers (and pretty good ones based on the high quality of the posts I<br/>\nsee here). But certainly there are plenty of readers who are not as<br/>\ninterested. Because of this, it is generally considered bad form to cross<br/>\npost. I would suggest that those of us that are interested in development<br/>\nshould join the junit-devel list so this list can be the user list. Then<br/>\npeople can opt-in to the conversations that are interesting to them.<br/>\nAnyways, I&#39;ll leave it to the moderators to define the scope of these lists.<br/>\n<br/>\nChris<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S. On the topic at hand, I know that Vladimir Bossicard has implemented a<br/>\nscheme that will let you register services with the junit architecture for<br/>\nletting you extend it easily for custom reporting and what-not. I don&#39;t know<br/>\nthe current status of that effort though so perhaps he can comment?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: David Stagner [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dstagner@...\">dstagner@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, November 27, 2001 11:11 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [junit] Making JUnit more pluggable for add-ons<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nScott Stirling wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;m glad he did.

I don&#39;t read the dev <br/>\nlist, and probably wouldn&#39;t (i don&#39;t have enough time to read the lists <br/>\nthat are higher priority as is).  I may not be actively involved in <br/>\ndevelopment, but i&#39;m very pleased to see such a carefully thought out <br/>\nand well-written proposal on the regular list!  I think it&#39;s great to <br/>\ntoss ideas for future development onto the general list, so long as they <br/>\nare nice and clear.  It&#39;s a good way to get feedback.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n<br/>\nDavid Stagner<br/>\n<br/>\nNational Marrow Donor Program<br/>\n3001 Broadway Street NE<br/>\nBroadway Ridge Suite 500<br/>\nMinneapolis, MN  55413<br/>\n<br/>\nEmail: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dstagner@...\">dstagner@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!
