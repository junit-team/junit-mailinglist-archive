I haven&#39;t made up\nmy mind why,\nmaybe I&#39;m just envious of the cool Ruby stuff and want to squeese it in just\nbecause I can or there is\nsome better reason why I&#39;m interested.\n\nThe hole I tried to fill is when you have a mixed environment of JRuby and\nJava and\nyou want your feedback in one place. The solution should work for idea and\nnetbeans aswell\nso it&#39;s not just for eclipse (just wanted to emphasize that in case someone\nmissed it)\n\nWhen I had that done I just started thinking &quot;hey, why not test-drive\njava-code as well&quot;\nand that&#39;s about as far as I have come in that line of thoughts.\nWhat is your experience with testing java-code from RSpec? (you seem to have\nthought\nsome more about it than me)\n\nI can see that some problems can emerge like the one you had with the\nexception-class thingy...\nIs it possible to just raise a Java exception (without rspec). In that case\nI guess you could work around\nthe problem by specifying your own action for throwing java-exceptions. If\nthe problem lies deeper\nwithing JRuby so that you can&#39;t even raise Java exceptions it becomes more\ndifficult :)\n\n/J\n\nOn 9/10/07, Per Jacobsson &lt;perjacobsson@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;   I like the idea of testing Java classes with rspec and have been playing\n&gt; around with it myself. Integrating it with the JUnit runner in Eclipe\n&gt; would definitely be useful.\n&gt;\n&gt; One gotcha I ran into was where Exceptions thrown by the rspec mocks\n&gt; didn&#39;t get the right type in Java.

I believe that mixing languages\n&gt; rather than switching completely from one language to another is going\n&gt; to be more and more important. As I explored the subject i found\n&gt; myself lacking some tools. I was frustrated by the fact that I had to\n&gt; maintain two sets of tests and look for feedback in two different\n&gt; locations while developing.\n&gt;\n&gt; I created a custom runner for JUnit to address the subject and I think\n&gt; it looks promising. I created a blog entry with some more details in\n&gt; case anyone is interested:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://johlrogge.wordpress.com/2007/09/08/hybrid-theory/\n&gt; &lt;http://johlrogge.wordpress.com/2007/09/08/hybrid-theory/&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I have some loose plans on open-sourcing this but I would like to see\n&gt; if there are others than me that find this interesting enough to be\n&gt; worth the effort before I do.\n&gt;\n&gt; /Joakim Ohlrogge\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
