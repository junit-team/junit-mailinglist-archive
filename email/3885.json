It actually turns out to be the &quot;Order Now!&quot; that is the<br/>\noffending phrase. If you don&#39;t want emails containing this phrase to be<br/>\nblocked then you can delete the corresponding line in FILTERS.TXT which will<br/>\nbe located in the same directory as OUTLOOK.EXE. This is just what my<br/>\nresearch says should work... I haven&#39;t actually tried it.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can also choose to have junk email sent to a special folder rather than<br/>\nbeing deleted which will let you make sure that nothing was misrouted.<br/>\n<br/>\nChris<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Andrew Clarke [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:andrew.clarke@...\">andrew.clarke@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, January 23, 2002 6:50 AM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: [junit] Why Outlook thinks Junit postings are spam (slightly<br/>\noff topic)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving recently started receiving a lot of spam mail at my work e-mail<br/>\naddress I have been experimenting with Outlook&#39;s junk e-mail option.  This<br/>\nis a rather crude spam filter because I still get the stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I noticed that lots (but not all) of the Junit postings were being<br/>\nrouted into the spambox.  When I investigated I discovered they all had this<br/>\nin common:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Tiny Wireless Camera under $80!<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Order Now! FREE VCR Commander!<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Click Here - Only 1 Day Left!<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://us.click.yahoo.com/nuyOHD/7.PDAA/yigFAA/NhFolB/TM\">http://us.click.yahoo.com/nuyOHD/7.PDAA/yigFAA/NhFolB/TM</a><br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Presumably added by our glorious and generous sponsors in order to defray<br/>\nthe cost of supporting this list.   That is fine and I don&#39;t have any<br/>\nargument with it.  But isn&#39;t it a little counter productive if it results in<br/>\nuntold e-mails never being read by the recipients?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, this &quot;Only 1 Day Left!&quot; offer has been appended to e-mails for<br/>\nseveral weeks now, so either Yahoo! &#39;s marketing is, um, inexact or people<br/>\nare reusing existing e-mails for new postings, in which case it might be an<br/>\nidea to trim the verbiage from the bottom - which might explain why not all<br/>\nthe junit postings get treated as spam.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m waiting to see whether I receive this.<br/>\n<br/>\nrgds, APC<br/>\n<br/>\nA P Clarke <br/>\nConsultant<br/>\nCMG Admiral UK - Radio Spectrum International<br/>\nWyndham House <br/>\n189 Marsh Wall<br/>\nLondon <br/>\nE14 9SH<br/>\nTel: +44 (0)20 7211 0603<br/>\nFax: +44 (0)20 7211 0364<br/>\nMobile:-----------------------<br/>\nInternet communications are not secure and therefore CMG UK Ltd does not<br/>\naccept legal responsibility for the contents of this message.
