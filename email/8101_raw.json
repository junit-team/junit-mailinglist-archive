The run() goes off on its\n&gt; own, doing all kinds of steps using private methods, only ending upon\n&gt; death.\n&gt; \tSo for example, the Mover thread is checking for files in a given\n&gt; directory, if it finds a file it parses information from the filename\n&gt; to find its destination, them moves the file to that destination.\n&gt; Once it has finished with all of the files it sleeps for a few\n&gt; minutes. I would like to check all of parsing steps, but they are\n&gt; private only.\n\nThe quickest approach may be to change the scope of those methods from\nprivate to protected, and test them that way.  This is assuming, of\ncourse, that your test class is in the same package.  Its kind of a\nhack, but it works.  \n\nGenerally when I see myself making a lot of protected methods like\nthis, its a signal that I ought to look at the design.  Should your\nthread class have these methods as private methods, or would it make\nmore sense to have a &quot;parser&quot; class that has these operations?  \n\nI&#39;m not saying this is definitely the case, but it might be something\nto look into.  There are a lot of red flags like this when you&#39;re\ntesting, generally summed up as &quot;If its hard to test, it may be hard to\nre-use.&quot;\n\nOtherwise, you&#39;ll have to make up a bunch of test files.  I&#39;d suggest\nkeeping the data for the files in your code, and writing them out to a\ntemporary directory your code makes rather than having a set of magic\ndirectories.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; (2) A second program relies on all of its data in a MS SQL database\n&gt; (connection using jdbc). Is there so way to build a fake set of\n&gt; tables using junit so that when run under junit it would get data\n&gt; from a set of objects instead of actually going to the database. That\n&gt; way I can provide for my own data - both bad and good - and track\n&gt; those results.\n\nI think Mock objects are exactly what you want here, see\nhttp://www.mockobjects.com/\n\n-Kevin\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nThe New Yahoo!
