It certainly helps.  Here&#39;s some of my \nthoughts on your thoughts:\n\nMariano Cortesi (Cono) wrote:\n\n&gt; what if the parameters are not that easy to construct...?\n&gt; they are not plain type, but more complex classes...\n&gt; i could mock them or just populate them in some way.\n&gt; For example, one parameter could be a collection of things...\n&gt; so i would need to create and populate the collection\n\nIn this case, one might be better off not using the parameterized \nsyntax, but writing the tests individually.  Currently, there&#39;s nothing \nto stop you writing\n\n@Parameters public static int[][] data= computeComplicatedParameters();\n\nHowever, the little IDE developer sitting on my other shoulder advises \nthat you think twice about not doing that, since it would mean having to \ndo a lot of computation before even knowing how many tests are too be run.\n\n&gt; Another thing i see, is that...\n&gt; in one way, i like being able to see the test data with the test.\n&gt; but, i may have the necessity to have it outside (i.e. if i have many\n&gt; sets of test)\n&gt; so, i would be nice to have an alternative way to set the parameters.\n\nDo you mean outside as in defined in another class, or outside as in \ndefined in a data file?  Have you written such a test in JUnit 3.x?\n\n&gt; One last though. Having all the parameters in an array could make me\n&gt; in some cases to forgot what that parameter is....they are not named \n&gt; after all..\n&gt; I don&#39;t know this is a real problem, it&#39;s simpler the way it is...\n&gt; but maybe if you have 5 o 6 parameters per testcase,\n&gt; then you could easily forgot which is which... (is this expression\n&gt; alright!??? :S)\n&gt; But, i repeat, this may not be a problem of the parameter test...\n&gt; maybe is the test that shouldn&#39;t need so many arguments...\n\nI lean toward your own response; it may be that a parameterized test \nthat needs 6 parameters could actually be several smaller tests.  \nMostly, there&#39;s no strong mechanism for named parameter passing in Java, \nso this scheme is no better and no worse than many consecutive calls to \nthe same method.  If you can think of an alternate syntax that solves \nthis issue, I&#39;m certainly interested.  Thanks,\n\n    David Saff\n\n",
