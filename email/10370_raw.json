Each\n&gt; suite should contain all tests of its package and all suites of the\n&gt; direct subpackages. Furthermore it should be able to update the\n&gt; relevant suites, if anywhere a new test was added.\n&gt; \n&gt; I seek for such a tool, because i am going to intigrate TestCases one\n&gt; by one to an existing large project. For now only a few tests exist,\n&gt; but they are spread over all the packages. To be able to execute these\n&gt; tests i want a root-suite which contains all existing tests. But i\n&gt; don�t want to write suites for each package by hand.\n\nWhen you say &quot;write suites&quot;, what do you mean? What specifically do you \nexpect such a tool to do? It sounds like you want something to collect a \nnumber of test case classes together to execute as a single suite.\n\nAnt (http://ant.apache.org) already helps collect all the TestCase \nclasses from a certain part of the file system (matching by filename \npatterns) and execute them as a large test suite. Look at its \n&lt;batchtest&gt; task.\n\nAlso, look at JUnit-addons&#39; DirectorySuiteBuilder, which you can start \nusing more quickly than Ant, but which /only/ does what the Ant \n&lt;batchtest&gt; task does.\n-- \nJ.
