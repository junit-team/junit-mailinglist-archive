There are quite many different reasons for having a <br/>\nskipped/ignored/pending test, and also with some testing frameworks they <br/>\nare marked pending during the execution of the test (e.g. ScalaTest&#39;s <br/>\npendingUntilFixed) whereas some mark them before executing any test code <br/>\n(e.g. JUnit&#39;s @Ignore).<br/>\n<br/>\nAt first I&#39;ll create the simplest possible solution and have just one <br/>\nconcept of skipped tests. Later, once I get some feedback from users and <br/>\nframework developers, I&#39;ll gather the different use cases for skipping <br/>\ntests and think about supporting them better.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nEsko Luontola<br/>\nwww.orfjackal.net</div>",
