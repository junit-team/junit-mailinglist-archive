In particular, unit test code gains from<br/>\n&gt; being able to provide an arbitrary implementation of an interface that<br/>\n&gt; it just can&#39;t do with a class.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I agree with this, but this seems to be very dependent on culture: what do<br/>\nyou value more, a rigid design that tries to prevent errors as much as<br/>\npossible, or a flexible design, that is easy to adapt to new requirements.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers, Ilja</div>",
