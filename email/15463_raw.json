If all &quot;complicated&quot;\n&gt; would be like that we can get 200% test coverage...\n&gt; \n&gt;    You came to the right conclusion that SQLException is an\n&gt; unrecoverable one and should be wrapped into a runtime exception. You\n&gt; even have slight improvement there with a common exception handler.\n&gt; There is only one step left before template pattern, so you can have\n&gt; exactly one place where that exception handler would be used. Take a\n&gt; look at JDBC packages in a Spring framework and either copy its design\n&gt; or use as is.\n&gt; \n&gt;    Pretty much the same pattern can be applied to other common API&#39;s and\n&gt; many already in a very same Spring framework, so you won&#39;t have to\n&gt; invent the wheel.\n&gt; \n&gt;    As I said, there are really good ways to make code more testable.\n\nI agree that we can improve things with the Template pattern, but I&#39;d \nneed a template for JDBC, for JMS, ... for every different 3rd-party \nproduct I use. Even if I do that, I still need to test-drive the \ntemplate, or hide the template behind an interface so I can test-drive \nthe code that uses it. I suppose it is achievable, but I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s \nworth the effort.\n\nIf code blocks were\n&gt; \n&gt;    regards,\n&gt;    Eugene\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; J. B. Rainsberger wrote:\n&gt;  &gt; sachin.dholakia@... wrote:\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;&gt; I am on the other side of the shore and believe in Code coverage and so\n&gt;  &gt;&gt; very interested in knowing why you feel that 100% code coverage isn&#39;t a\n&gt;  &gt;&gt; requirement for code check in?  Can you please share your thoughts?\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Sure: 100% line/branch coverage is impossible to achieve. Even if it\n&gt;  &gt; were possible, it&#39;s not worth the effort. Example:\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; JDBC driver throws SQLException, which is checked. In my code, I have to\n&gt;  &gt; do this:\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; try {\n&gt;  &gt;      useJdbcDriver();\n&gt;  &gt; }\n&gt;  &gt; catch (SQLException e) {\n&gt;  &gt;      // What to do here?\n&gt;  &gt; }\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Well, my default checked exception handler is this:\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; try {\n&gt;  &gt;      useJdbcDriver();\n&gt;  &gt; }\n&gt;  &gt; catch (SQLException wrapped) {\n&gt;  &gt;      throw new RuntimeException(\n&gt;  &gt;          &quot;Something went wrong when I used the database&quot;, wrapped);\n&gt;  &gt; }\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; There are two problems with this:\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; 1. It takes an obscene amount of effort to simulate (or recreate) the\n&gt;  &gt; conditions under which the JDBC driver throws an SQLException.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; The vast, vast majority of the time, I don&#39;t handle those exceptions\n&gt;  &gt; anyway, but rather pass them up the chain. To avoid coupling myself to\n&gt;  &gt; my caller, I turn the checked exception into an unchecked one.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; 2. Java /forces/ me to duplicate that exception handler everywhere\n&gt;  &gt; throughout my code, although I /could/ get a little better with\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;      ExceptionHandler.shush(\n&gt;  &gt;          &quot;Something went wrong when I used the database&quot;, shushed);\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Still, I have to duplicate /that/ everywhere, but I certainly don&#39;t need\n&gt;  &gt; to test it everywhere I use it. The only thing that changes is the\n&gt;  &gt; explanation message, and I never write code that depends on that text in\n&gt;  &gt; any meaningful way.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Both of these make it unusually expensive to test-drive this code,\n&gt;  &gt; compared to the benefit I get from test-driving it. As a result, I have\n&gt;  &gt; judged that it&#39;s not worth the effort, so I don&#39;t do it.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; I hope that helps.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; YAHOO!
