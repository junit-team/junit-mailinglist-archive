I do prefix \n&gt; this with the\n&gt; caveat that I haven&#39;t yet looked at JUnit4 or Java5 beyond \n&gt; reading Elliotte\n&gt; Rusty Harold&#39;s developerworks article, so please be gentle with me.\n&gt; \n&gt; My solution essentially involved adding startSuite and endSuite method\n&gt; signatures to TestListener and then modifying TestResult to \n&gt; accept Observers\n&gt; that implemented this new interface and report when the \n&gt; particular lifecycle\n&gt; events occured. The implementation was just a first draft and could\n&gt; doubtless be made more robust - my tests were just enough to \n&gt; get it up and\n&gt; running.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m aware of Kent&#39;s stated intent that JUnit should be the \n&gt; intersection of\n&gt; test tool functionality rather than the union (somewhat \n&gt; paraphrased!), but\n&gt; I&#39;d be interested in hearing everyone&#39;s views about where \n&gt; this functionality\n&gt; should live. Presumably the logic to maintain a hierarchy of \n&gt; TestSuites must\n&gt; be reimplemented by all tool vendors interested in displaying \n&gt; a tree of the\n&gt; results, rather than a core part of JUnit. Is that the right \n&gt; place for it?\n&gt; As a counter argument, I can see that if a vendor implemented a\n&gt; multithreaded TestRunner for running TestSuites concurrently, then\n&gt; maintaining a hierarchy might be a little interesting using \n&gt; my simplistic\n&gt; implementation.\n&gt; \n&gt; James\n\n\n",
