I guess I got involved in the<br/>\n&gt; discussion, I thought it was (at times) useful. Since it was my first<br/>\n&gt; posting (and heck, I was throttled by moderation) how was I <br/>\n&gt; to know that you<br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t want discuss on the list.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \t&gt; I&#39;d suggest some folks should think more between <br/>\n&gt; posts or take a<br/>\n&gt; discussion offline until things are resolved,<br/>\n&gt; \t&gt; then come back with a summary.  But this is so <br/>\n&gt; unusual for this list<br/>\n&gt; (thinking over the past few years),<br/>\n&gt; \t&gt; it will probably return to normal soon by themselves.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;d like to think I&#39;ve been thinking, but hmm ... let me <br/>\n&gt; think about that<br/>\n&gt; some more ... Yup, I&#39;m pretty sure I was. You judge so <br/>\n&gt; harshly yet you admit<br/>\n&gt; you deleted much of what was there. Couldn&#39;t you have just <br/>\n&gt; kept on deleting<br/>\n&gt; and kept this to yourself? No, I guess you want a quiet <br/>\n&gt; mailing list. Ok,<br/>\n&gt; you win -- I&#39;m done.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Every other OSS list I know says discuss here, not in private, the<br/>\n&gt; discussion is part of the process & best archived for <br/>\n&gt; reference. Clearly the<br/>\n&gt; main two noise producers failed to come to a summary, so <br/>\n&gt; observation by<br/>\n&gt; other was needed. A bunch of folks jumped in with what I considered<br/>\n&gt; interesting perspectives, I was grateful for that, even if to <br/>\n&gt; you viewed it<br/>\n&gt; as more noise.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;\t+1<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -1 -- but hey, I clearly don&#39;t fit here. I thought I was discussing<br/>\n&gt; something of small potential with the development team of junit, but I<br/>\n&gt; clearly got that all wrong. I guess from that mistaken hypothesis all<br/>\n&gt; conclusion is obviously worthless, so I should&#39;ve just given up when I<br/>\n&gt; thought about giving up.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I learned a lot from these threads, just little of it was <br/>\n&gt; about junit & most<br/>\n&gt; of it was about this list&#39;s participants.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; No more noise from me...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; regards<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Adam </span></blockquote></div>",
