When<br/>\n&gt; person A says, &quot;You can&#39;t test everything,&quot; and person B says, &quot;Yes, you<br/>\n&gt; can,&quot; they can both be right from their perspective if person B has access<br/>\n&gt; to tools or techniques that person A does not. The cultural aspect of<br/>\n&gt; developer testing that further muddies the waters is that the global<br/>\n&gt; develoment community is changing quickly but unevenly. Once again, person A<br/>\n&gt; can say, &quot;You ought to write tests,&quot; and person B can say, &quot;You don&#39;t need<br/>\n&gt; to write tests,&quot; and they can both be correct from their perspective.  More<br/>\n&gt; precisely, one person could say, &quot;I think it is my duty as a programmer to<br/>\n&gt; write thorough, automated tests,&quot; and the other say, &quot;I think testing is one<br/>\n&gt; of many priorities that need to be balanced so it is my duty as a programmer<br/>\n&gt; to sometimes skip writing automated tests,&quot; and they could both be<br/>\n&gt; expressing valid opinions.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yours,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Kent Beck<br/>\n&gt; Three Rivers Institute<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nwww.simonpeter.org </span></blockquote></div>",
