If you can give us some information on what the &#39;void&#39; me=\r\nthod does, we may have a suggestion for you.\n\nConsider the event/listener d=\r\nesign in Java. An event source exposes &#39;addXXXListener&#39; and &#39;removeXXXListe=\r\nner&#39;, but no methods to query the list of listeners. After all, only the ev=\r\nent source needs to know who the listeners are at any given moment.\n\nYou wa=\r\nnt to test &#39;addXXXListener&#39; to see whether it really does add the listener.=\r\n You have two choices.\n\n1. Add &#39;containsXXXListener&#39; to the event source an=\r\nd use it in your tests. This is essentially the &#39;get&#39; method you don&#39;t want=\r\n to use.\n\n2. Add a listener to the event source, tell the event source to f=\r\nire an event, then check that the listener heard the event.\n\nOption #1 is c=\r\nleaner, although it adds a method &#39;just for testing&#39;. Rather than drag up m=\r\ny past comments in that direction, I suggest searching this group for the p=\r\nhrase &quot;just for testing&quot; and read the messages you find.\n\nOption #2 avoids =\r\nthe extra method, but relies on knowing how to fire an event, which kind of=\r\n event is fired and building a listener that listens for that kind of event=\r\n *and* can tell you whether it heard that event. That was a lot to type: th=\r\ne code must be more work! Also if the event source changes its internal wor=\r\nkings, your test may no longer work. With Option #1, there&#39;s not much dange=\r\nr in the event source changing in a way that might break your test.\n\nFor de=\r\ntails, look for &quot;JUnit Cookbook&quot; from Manning publications, although you&#39;ll=\r\n have to be patient -- it may not be on the shelf until early 2004.\n\nTake c=\r\nare.\n\n\nJ.
