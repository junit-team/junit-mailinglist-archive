Our goal is to\n&gt; eliminate such tests, but exposure of those tests is required to\n&gt; achieve this goal.\n&gt;\n\nIt sounds like you either want Categories, have your own annotation and\nwrite a custom Filter.\n\nAnother option would be to write a method that checks an environment\nvariable or system property and based on the results optionally calls\nAssume.assumeTrue(false).\n\n&gt;\n&gt; The following (especially the cons since I&#39;m biased and there&#39;s lots\n&gt; about JUnit I don&#39;t yet understand) will likely be missing items but\n&gt; I&#39;ll try to be fair about them. If there&#39;s anything missing, I&#39;m sure\n&gt; people will jump in.\n&gt;\n&gt; Pro&#39;s:\n&gt; * Simpler code. @Ignore processing would simply be just another\n&gt; filter. Existing duplicate code to check for @Ignore annotations will\n&gt; disappear.\n&gt; * Conceptually simpler. @Ignore and Filters aren&#39;t two separate things\n&gt; with different hard-coded nuances.\n&gt;\nBut they currently *do* have different nuances. Filtered tests do not show\nup in the Description tree; Ignored tests do. JUnit provides notifications\nwhen &quot;running&quot; an ignored test; no notification exists for filtering tests.\n\nThey are also semantically different IMHO. @Ignore is a code-level\nindication to never run a test. Filtering is a way to run a subset of the\ntests.\n\nIt sounds like you want tests that are run in some environments and not\nothers; I think Ignore is a poor choice because it doesn&#39;t allow you to\nspecify which environments you want to run them in. Again, I would use\nCategories or a custom annotation and a filter.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Con&#39;s:\n&gt; * Slower performance. Since notifications will have to be made, the\n&gt; set of tests to be run can&#39;t be culled down. Such slower performance\n&gt; is theoretical and ought to be measured.\n&gt;\n&gt; Potential alternatives:\n&gt; * Have an option (somewhere) that allows notification for filtered tests.\n&gt; * Have a fireFiltered() method for notifiers.\n&gt;\n\nFiltering can happen before RunNotifiers are added. One way to filter is to\ncreate a Request, and then call Request.filterWith(), and then run the\ntests. When you filter a request, the filtered items vanish from the\nRunner/Description tree. It would be hard to change that behavior without\nbreaking existing users.\n\n-- Kevin\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
