Rather than having all of\nyour code access the complex environment directly, write top-level\nroutines/classes which access the environment then pass just what is\nneeded to lower level routines/classes. Basically, you want to get to a\npoint where you can test most of the system in a straight-forward manner,\nthen you can figure out how to initialize or mock out the complex\nenvironment for the bit of code remaining.\n\nOn Mon, 29 Oct 2001 jack_dimas@... wrote:\n\n&gt; I &#39;m new with JUnit and I&#39;m considering the possibility to use it in\n&gt; my applications. However I&#39;m puzzled how this can be done because all\n&gt; the classes that are used in my applications depend heavily on a\n&gt; framework. To explain:\n&gt;\n&gt; I &#39;m using this framework to write my servlet applications. The\n&gt; framework consists of a main servlet that calls utility classes. This\n&gt; framework manages database connections and other resources via an\n&gt; environment object which is initialized every time I run my\n&gt; application and I request the first web page. This enviroment object\n&gt; is passed to every utility class I use in my application. Each class\n&gt; uses the environment object to make for example database queries, for\n&gt; session management, to get a handle to HttpRequest, HttpResponse and\n&gt; servlet objects and other useful things.\n&gt;\n&gt; In a case like this how could I use JUnit? How can I initialize the\n&gt; environment object from the setUp method of a TestCase? I thought of\n&gt; creating HttpServletRequest, HttpServletResponse objects to pass to\n&gt; my utility classes but I cannot figure out a way to pass a servlet\n&gt; object.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
