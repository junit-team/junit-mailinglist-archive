The absence of <br/>\n&gt;&gt; a test indicates &quot;undefined behavior&quot; and you shouldn&#39;t rely <br/>\n&gt;&gt; on undefined <br/>\n&gt;&gt; behavior. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;How can the absence of a test specify anything reliably?  (How does <br/>\n&gt;the user know that you&#39;re trying to say that the behavior is undefined<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;and that you didn&#39;t just forget to test that case?)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The user should assume, in my opinion, that unspecified behavior is --<br/>\nwell -- unspecified. I would assume it. If I am unsure what your code<br/>\ndoes under specific conditions, I have some choices. I can:<br/>\n<br/>\n* Read your documentation and trust it.<br/>\n* Ask you directly.<br/>\n* Look at your tests and find one that covers the condition or<br/>\nsomething sufficiently similar.<br/>\n* Write a Learning Test and discover the answer for myself.<br/>\n<br/>\nI could read your documentation, but I may not trust it. I would<br/>\ncertainly be able to trsut the outcome of any of the other three, so<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure whether the first is that solid an option, all other<br/>\nthings being equal.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo answer the direct question: the absence of a test specifies, by<br/>\ndefault, that behavior is undefined. Add a test -- no matter who writes<br/>\nit -- and we can define the behavior unambiguously. I prefer<br/>\nunambiguous definitions to potentially ambiguous ones by default, so in<br/>\nthe worst case, I&#39;d probably just write the test. I have tried to do<br/>\nthis without just writing the test before and regretted the wasted<br/>\ntime, so I have decided to learn from my experience.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; &gt; Because tests, being code, can&#39;t relate code to external concepts.<br/>\n <br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; (A specification can say that a function f returns the<br/>\n </span></blockquote>mathematical<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; &gt; sum of two given integers subject to the limitations of 32-bit<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; signed binary arithmetic.  How can a test say something like<br/>\n </span></blockquote>that?)<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; I would think that the name of the method says it, <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Then you completely missed the example I just gave.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I did not: I think &quot;f&quot; is a ridiculous name and would have to question<br/>\nany author who names a function like the above &quot;f&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Note the number<br/>\n&gt;of terms necessary to define the behavior of the function.  Would you <br/>\n&gt;ever name a function with that level of precision or description?  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This does not parse. I thought I specified three tests that zero in<br/>\nquite quickly on the behavior of this method. What was wrong with them?<br/>\nIs something missing?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;(Don&#39;t use that exact example, since 32-bit binary values are already <br/>\n&gt;defined in Java.)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t see how this matters: are you suggesting that we need an<br/>\nexample of a method using parameters that are &quot;not defined&quot; in Java?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; I, for one, would be very interested to see Sun&#39;s servlet API <br/>\n&gt;&gt; described in a <br/>\n&gt;&gt; test suite.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I would hate to see _only_ a test suite.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>With a gun to my head and asked to choose between Javadoc and a test<br/>\nsuite, I choose the test suite. I assume that the test suite was ample<br/>\nto provide the developers with the necessary confidence to release<br/>\ntheir code; otherwise, I simply wouldn&#39;t use the software at all.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;You know, this makes me think of things like Ada and some network<br/>\n&gt;protocols, which have a detailed specification _and_ a test suite.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Even better.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Having just the test suite would be a horrible way to learn Ada or a<br/>\n&gt;protocol enough to implement it, or even just to use it.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Do you have experience to back up this statement? I started learning<br/>\nSmalltalk using a combination of:<br/>\n<br/>\n* Well-named classes<br/>\n* A primer on the syntax<br/>\n* SUnit<br/>\n<br/>\nI found it to be quite a good experience, actually. When learning a<br/>\nprogramming language, it is more important to try to write tests than<br/>\nit is to read tests. Writing tests in an unknown language allows me to<br/>\nexplore the language without being bogged down in the details of I/O,<br/>\nwhich can create more questions than they answer. Think about all the<br/>\nnonsense one has to go over to explain &quot;public static void<br/>\nmain(String[] args)&quot; to a novice Java programmer... would it not be<br/>\nbetter to just explain how to call methods and assertEquals()?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;(Actually, doesn&#39;t Sun have a J2EE test suite?)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No idea. If they do, I&#39;d like to see it.<br/>\n<br/>\nJ. B.
