Howe=\r\nver, I have not found an article that explains the\n&gt;advantages of unit test=\r\ning vs integration testing.  My perhaps naive hunch\n&gt;is that the cost-per-b=\r\nug-eliminated of unit testing is higher than that of\n&gt;integration testing. =\r\n It appears this way because a single integration test\n&gt;tests a lot more co=\r\nde than a single unit test and takes about the same\n&gt;amount of time to cons=\r\ntruct.  Plus it seems to me that a whole suite of\n&gt;unit\n&gt;tests with 100% co=\r\nde coverage cannot guarantee that even the simplest\n&gt;system\n&gt;wide behavior =\r\nis correct (e.g. the web page appears).  Am I wrong about\n&gt;this?  Can someo=\r\nne refer me information about this topic.  A scientific\n&gt;study paper with r=\r\neal numbers would be welcome.\n\nYou have it right. Programmer Tests (your &quot;u=\r\nnit tests&quot;) play an entirely different role than Integration Tests. The goa=\r\nl of Programmer Tests is to ensure that object-level behavior is correct (a=\r\ns expected), but may not guarantee correct collaboration among objects. Tha=\r\nt&#39;s why we have Customer Tests and Integration Tests.\n\nCustomer Tests allow=\r\n us to be confident that we&#39;re building the right features.\n\nProgrammer Tes=\r\nts allow us to be confident that our objects do what we think we asked them=\r\n to do.\n\nIntegration Tests allow us to be confident that our objects play n=\r\nicely with one another. Integration Tests are often headless (UI-less) Cust=\r\nomer Tests.\n\nProgrammer Tests run faster than Integration Tests, so we run =\r\nthem more often. That&#39;s one of their biggest benefits.\n\nTake care.\n\n\nJ.
