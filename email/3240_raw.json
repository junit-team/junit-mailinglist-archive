And they\n&gt; suggest\n&gt;   &gt; where any bugs encountered might be, even by their absence (a\n&gt;   &gt; problematic condition may not be tested, and a set of tests could\n&gt; rule\n&gt;   &gt; out a bunch of possible causes for a bug).\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; This seems like a pretty weak argument to me.  They only document the\n&gt; set of\n&gt; the API that the authors chose to test, and they only test to the\n&gt; authors&#39;\n&gt; degrees of comfortability.  Truth be known, just because JUnit is in use\n&gt; does\n&gt; not mean that the code is being tested thoroughly.  Right?  You may be\n&gt; right\n&gt; that it could show you what isn&#39;t tested, but not necessarily why.  And\n&gt; it only\n&gt; gives you a clue as to what is not tested and what is.  There may not be\n&gt; a one\n&gt; to one mapping of the public API to the tests.\n\nGranted.  I was assuming that the set of unit tests theoretically\nprovided by our imaginary vendor (has anyone ever seen a non-open source\nvendor do this?) would be reasonably thorough, complete, and\nrepresentative.  If the unit tests don&#39;t exercise all the documented\nmethods and boundaries of the API, they&#39;re incomplete anyway.  The hard\npart comes with testing coupling, interaction, and state changes between\ncomponents, where the non-trivial bugs often lurk.  \n\nOn a more philosophical level, i&#39;d suggest that most unit testing is\neither very useful, or mostly useless, depending on the confidence of\nthe programmer in the testing process.  Cowardly testing is a sign of a\nlack of confidence in the code.  Once a programmer gets in the habit of\nserious unit testing, the programmer will almost always be more\nconfident in the code - and thus more likely to test thoroughly.  Good\nunit testing is a self-reinforcing feedback loop.  And if i were given a\nset of unit tests from a vendor that clearly did not thoroughly test the\npublic interface of the software, i would immediately distrust the\nsoftware in question. \n-- \n\nDavid Stagner\n\nNational Marrow Donor Program\n3001 Broadway Street NE\nBroadway Ridge Suite 500\nMinneapolis, MN  55413\n\nEmail: dstagner@...\n\n",
