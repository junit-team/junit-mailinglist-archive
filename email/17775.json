We may find ourselves performing <br/>\n&gt;&gt;checks at the edge of a system, say at the client interfaces, but I <br/>\n&gt;&gt;don&#39;t find much value in precondition checking inside application code.  <br/>\n&gt;&gt;I prefer to write my code so that usage is obvious and documented with <br/>\n&gt;&gt;test cases.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;    <br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The boundary I would pick is the public API. If a method is public (or <br/>\n&gt;protected) then there&#39;s really nothing you can do about who calls it and <br/>\n&gt;nothing you can assume about what they will pass beyond the types of the <br/>\n&gt;arguments. Internal classes not meant for public consumption need not <br/>\n&gt;rigorously verify each precondition if substantial testing demonstrates <br/>\n&gt;their correctness *provided* that they are not public. If they are <br/>\n&gt;public, all bets are off.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Let me ask you a question.. if you buy a stereo and the manufacturer <br/>\nwants to make it clear that you&#39;re on your own when you muck with the <br/>\ninternals, do they seal the stereo so that it&#39;s completely inaccessible <br/>\nor do they do something different?<br/>\n<br/>\nMichael Feathers<br/>\nwww.objectmentor.com</div>",
