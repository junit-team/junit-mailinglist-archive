It was included in Peter Frey&#39;s book -- an excellent<br/>\ncompilation of papers on the subject.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe finding that, when shown a board containing pieces placed on random<br/>\nsquares, non-experts and experts were essentially identical in their<br/>\nability to reconstruct the board, with non-experts holding a slight<br/>\nedge. (Less mental &quot;interference&quot;, no doubt.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut when shown positions arising from actual games, the experts&#39; memory<br/>\nwas far and away superior, tantamount to total recall (and I will bet<br/>\nthat it was especially keen with respect to the &quot;salient&quot; features,<br/>\nalthough there was no way to measure that concept as far as I can<br/>\nrecall) -- while the non-experts did just about as well with real<br/>\npositions as<br/>\nwith random positions.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, the point your are trying to make, I suspect, is that code<br/>\ndeveloped by TDD experts will most likely show some interesting patterns<br/>\nthat differ from code developed<br/>\nby other folks.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat appears to be Scott&#39;s thesis, as well, and I greatly look forward<br/>\nto the expansion and illustration of those views.</div>",
