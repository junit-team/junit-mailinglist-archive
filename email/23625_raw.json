In order:\n\n1) acknowledgements.txt is an attempt at a log of everyone outside of\nthe primary maintainers who has contributed in some way to JUnit.  It\nwas, I believe, originally intended to serve two purposes: (a) for\ntraceability, should any legal questions arise about the provenance of\na piece of code, (b) before github, we often ended up massaging (or\nreplacing) patches ourselves before committing them to CVS, and we\nwanted a way to genuinely thank and remember the original authors.\n\nGitHub now helps with both of these issues: since we can discuss pull\nrequests before they&#39;re accepted, we can ask contributors to fix minor\nissues, and github keeps excellent track of what came from where.  In\naddition, distributed maintenance of the acknowledgements.txt file has\nbecome a pain, since as a linear document, there is often a race\ncondition between appended items.\n\n2) I&#39;ve been asking committers to include updates to ReleaseNotes\nfiles as part of check-ins.  This has some of the same issues as\nabove: it&#39;s no longer strictly necessary given GitHub support, and\nalso leads to race conditions.\n\nSo, my proposal is:\n\n1) Drop further appends to acknowedgements.txt\n2) Adopt a more formal approach to git commit messages, following\nalong http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html,\nalong release notes to be largely auto-generated at release time.\n\nThoughts?\n\n",
