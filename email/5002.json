    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-38151259\">Hi - in my eyes data driven testing goes along with previous discussions on functional (aka &#39;acceptance&#39;) testing of the API under test. I define acceptance testing to be black box integration testing of the API, with very little, if any, usage of Mock objects, stubs, or drivers. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo - to answer your question - I would think that utilizing the services of Junit for data driven testing application is certainly a good thing in the name of reuse and consistency, but mileage will vary as to how much of the framework you will really leverage. Yes - you will definitely need something to do the verification step, and Junit&#39;s assert class is a great candidate. However, keep in mind that most of your code to implement data driven testing is the code that implements the business logic of the test cases. <br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps a combination of junit, and dbunit is a good foundation for a framework. In my eyes, it&#39;s designing and implementing the code that handles the keyword language of your data driven testing application is where the majority of the effort will be. <br/>\n<br/>\nI would love to hear some members usage of junit in the acceptance test development phase, and if anyone took their acceptance tests to the &#39;next level&#39; such that a keyword driven macro language is used to drive and customize the acceptance tests. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy background is &#39;code competent&#39; QA engineer/developer so I think with functional testing for a non technically savvy QA engineer in mind. Data driven testing is perfect for non technical staff to use as a test harness into the API. <br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\nBill <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: NOUSHI Reda <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Monday, May 13, 2002 8:04 PM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [junit] How to create data-driven tests? II!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Hi all,<br/>\n  My point is slightly different. I want to create data-driven tests<br/>\n  assuming that the data is what defines the test case&#39;s steps!<br/>\n  My input file would be something like that:<br/>\n  ? this<br/>\n  ! that<br/>\n  ? this2<br/>\n  ? this3<br/>\n  ! that2<br/>\n<br/>\n  And I want it to produce something like:<br/>\n  void Test1() <br/>\n  {<br/>\n  //do this<br/>\n<br/>\n  //assert that <br/>\n<br/>\n  //do this2<br/>\n<br/>\n  //do this3<br/>\n<br/>\n  //assert that2<br/>\n  } <br/>\n<br/>\n  I know I can write some script or class that parses the input file and<br/>\n  generates the test case class, but I want something like a single class<br/>\n  that does this job for me, like that of dbUnit. The problem with dbUnit<br/>\n  is that the data is what the test case runs on...<br/>\n<br/>\n  Thanks in advance,<br/>\n  Reda<br/>\n  -- <br/>\n  GCE/E/IT/M/SS !d---(+) s+:+(++:++) a-- C++ ULS++ P+?
