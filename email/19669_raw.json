I want one &quot;TrueDefaultPolicy&quot;\n&gt;  &gt;for when we look up a FooPolicy and can&#39;t find it, we get something\n&gt;  &gt;more useful than a null pointer. We can subclass, the GrandpaFooPolicy\n&gt;  &gt;can subclass from the &quot;TrueDefaultPolicy&quot; and the FooPolicy can extend\n&gt;  &gt;the GrandpaFooPolicy, but you need a concrete instance of a base, and\n&gt;  &gt;you really only want one of them.\n&gt;  \n&gt; It&#39;s reasonable to want only one of an object, but for me it comes down\n&gt; to one question: can I trust my team members not to create two? If I\n&gt; can, it makes sense to avoid the singleton. The enforcement that\n&gt; singleton brings is the solution to a problem, but the problem is social\n&gt; not technical. It pays to know whether you have the problem or not.\n\nIn short, no, I do not trust the team members. Nor do I trust the JVM.\n\nTeams are rarely made of just smart, dedicated, senior people. And even \nthe best make mistakes, see Murphy&#39;s Law. So the good engineering \nresponse to Murphy, who was a real engineer, is to reduce the chance \nthat folks can do things wrong. Even when the team is only me, I&#39;m not \nsure it is wise to &#39;trust the team&#39;\n\nWith the current style to WebApps, with J2EE using multiple class \nloaders, its not clear that even when done &quot;right&quot; that the singleton \npattern is feasible.\n\nWhat I&#39;m taking from this thread is:\n1) statements that &quot;singletons are evil&quot; is overly generalized\n2) sometimes singletons are very useful and even critical.\n3) many solutions are as bad as the problem\n4) testing singletons in general, and with Junit in particular, is a \nPITA if not impossible.\n5) many alternatives exist for the lazy &quot;global variable&quot; design, such \nas Context, XML files, etc.\n6) no good alternative exists if you really, really want one and only \none instance of an object. And you may not be able to do it anyway.\n\nPat\n-- \nPat Farrell\nhttp://www.pfarrell.com/\n\n\n",
