The thing we need to focus on is anything \ntha=\r\nt we can do to get them started testing. The argument I constantly \nhear fr=\r\nom developers is that they don&#39;t have time. My personal \nexperience is that=\r\n testing actually saves me time. We need some way to \nget the non-believers=\r\n to try it themselves, so they will see. \n\nMy preference is to adopt an org=\r\nanic approach to gradually incorporate \nunit testing into the project. I em=\r\nphasize the importance of building \njunit tests before modifying existing c=\r\node. It isn&#39;t essential that \nthey be write isolated unit tests, when the c=\r\nomponents of the class \nare known to work. Instead focus on testing the API=\r\n of the class in \nany way that it can possibly change due to the modificati=\r\nons. Before \nfixing a bug, write a junit test that fails. This proves that =\r\nthe \ncause of the bug is known and once the code is modified, that the bug =\r\n\nis fixed. When they see how easy it is to test at the unit level \nrather t=\r\nhan the user interface, hopefully they will become sold.\n\nJanet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
