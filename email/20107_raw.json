It would be great to hear how you and others would like the  \nfeature to work. We&#39;ll try to incorporate those suggestions.\n\nBob\n\nhttp://www.crap4j.org/\nCompare Your Code CRAP Score\n\nOn Nov 5, 2007, at 5:58 PM, Per Jacobsson wrote:\n\n&gt; I just tried out the plug-in on some of my projects and the metrics  \n&gt; look interesting.\n&gt;\n&gt; One quick suggestion: Some filtering functionality would be nice,  \n&gt; perhaps just the ability to exclude certain packages from the  \n&gt; reports. Right now, one-shot code that I know is crap, and already  \n&gt; scheduled to be deprecated or deleted, of course shows up at the top  \n&gt; of the list. That makes it harder to spot the methods that really  \n&gt; need to be looked at.\n&gt; / Per\n&gt;\n&gt; ________________________________\n&gt; From: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf  \n&gt; Of albsavoia\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, November 01, 2007 10:17 AM\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: [junit] Crap4j - Feedback and suggestions wanted\n&gt;\n&gt; A few weeks ago I wrote a blog\n&gt; &lt;http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=215899&gt; to  \n&gt; introduce\n&gt; Crap4J a prototype open-source tool that implements the C.R.A.P.\n&gt; &lt;http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=210575&gt; metric.\n&gt; CRAP is designed to detect a particularly nasty and dangerous Java  \n&gt; code\n&gt; smell:\n&gt; high complexity methods without adequate unit tests.\n&gt; The concept behind CRAP is that code without tests is rarely a good\n&gt; idea; but when you couple very complex code without adequate tests you\n&gt; are really asking for it.\n&gt;\n&gt; We did the original implementation of Crap4J as an Eclipse plug-in.  \n&gt; The\n&gt; response to Crap4J was so positive that we decided to go further and\n&gt; created a dedicated website crap4j.org &lt;http://www.crap4j.org&gt; .\n&gt;\n&gt; We&#39;ve had hundreds of downloads since we launched the site, along with\n&gt; many requests for Ant support and support for IDEs other than Eclipse.\n&gt;\n&gt; We just added Ant support in 1.1.4, and we are planning to support  \n&gt; other\n&gt; IDEs like NetBeans and IntelliJ (BTW, if you are interested in\n&gt; contribute to plug-in development please let us know).\n&gt;\n&gt; If you have a chance, please try Crap4J on your project and let us  \n&gt; know\n&gt; what you think. We are interested in getting this group&#39;s feedback on\n&gt; Crap4j and suggestions for improving and extending it.\n&gt;\n&gt; The home page is: www.crap4j.org &lt;http://www.crap4j.org&gt; ; from there\n&gt; you can navigate to the download page.\n&gt;\n&gt; If you have any problems installing it or running it, feel free to ask\n&gt; for help on the forum or file a bug report or feature request.\n&gt; &lt;http://trac.crap4j.org/&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt;\n&gt; Alberto\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
