Unit tests and<br/>\n&gt; using JUnit overgrew &quot;developer-only&quot; testing long ago. Sooner<br/>\n&gt; (better) or later they become functional tests, user acceptance tests<br/>\n&gt; and what not.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So, to me limiting test run by QA is a natural requirements. We use<br/>\n&gt; Ant&#39;s &lt;batchtest if=&quot;...&quot;&gt; to select what test groups should be run in<br/>\n&gt; a particular case.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; HTH<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Regards,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Slava Imeshev </span></blockquote></div>",
