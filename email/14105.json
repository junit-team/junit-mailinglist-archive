This didn&#39;t come as<br/>\na major shock, but I think I have an idea for a solution and I would<br/>\nlike some devil&#39;s advocates :)<br/>\n<br/>\nSuppose the following class:<br/>\n<br/>\npublic class SomeClass {<br/>\n   public boolean doSomething(double x, double y) {<br/>\n      double a = Math.random();<br/>\n      double b = Math.random();<br/>\n      return (x+a) &gt; (y+b);<br/>\n   }<br/>\n}<br/>\n<br/>\nWriting a test case for this is next to impossible because you do not<br/>\nknow the results of the method beforehand. But what if there were an<br/>\ninterface:<br/>\n<br/>\npublic interface DoubleGenerator { public double nextDouble(); }<br/>\n<br/>\nthat SomeClass depends on.<br/>\n<br/>\npublic class SomeClass {<br/>\n   private DoubleGenerator doubleGenerator;<br/>\n   //setter method<br/>\n<br/>\n   public boolean doSomething(double x, double y) {<br/>\n      double a = doubleGenerator.nextDouble();<br/>\n      double b = doubleGenerator.nextDouble();<br/>\n      return (x+a) &gt; (y+b);<br/>\n   }<br/>\n}<br/>\n<br/>\nThe implementation of DoubleGenerator in production code could be a<br/>\nwrapper around Math.random() and a testing implementation could allow<br/>\nyou to set the sequence of doubles to return.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou could also use java.util.Random instead of DoubleGenerator and<br/>\nsubclass it to allow setting of the sequence, but I don&#39;t like having<br/>\nall the extra methods when SomeClass only needs one of them. However,<br/>\nhaving the extra methods allows for flexibility later. Opinions?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, is setting a DoubleGenerator with two doubles good practice? For<br/>\nnow, doSomething() needs two doubles, but it may need three or four<br/>\nlater. Is this &quot;inside knowledge&quot; bad practice when writing tests?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your opinions.<br/>\n<br/>\nMichael.</div>",
