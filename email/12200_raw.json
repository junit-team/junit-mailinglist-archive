I am on leave at\n&gt; the moment with child #3 :-)\n\nEnjoy, and good luck.\n\n&gt; To answer your questions:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. What was my goal? \n&gt; \n&gt; It was a type of end to end test.  The test&#39;s point of\n&gt; entry was the InvestorWebService object.  I asked the\n&gt; InvestorWebService for a PersonDTO (a person is one\n&gt; investor type), modified it, and sent it to the update\n&gt; method on the InvestorWebService.  \n&gt; \n&gt; To check that this indeed worked as expected, in that\n&gt; all the tables in DB were updated as expected, I used\n&gt; DbUnit to assert that the tables matched XML datasets.\n\nIf you want to test this from end to end, and if Spring/Hibernate&#39;s \ntransaction setting is not allowing you to use automatic transaction \nhandling for this test as is, then I suppose you&#39;ll just have to begin \nand end transactions explicitly in the test. I don&#39;t know how to do \nthat, but I don&#39;t see any other way.\n\nIn my opinion, if you want to test this from end to end, then you&#39;re not \ntesting enough of the application. I imagine that if you tested this \nbehavior through the application protocol -- using HTTPUnit, say -- then \nyou wouldn&#39;t have this transaction problem.\n\nOn the other hand, if you /really/ want to test an individual class, but \ndon&#39;t see how to do so in isolation, then we have more investigating to \ndo to get to that point, with a copy of &quot;Working Effectively with Legacy \nCode&quot; at our side. :)\n\n&gt; 2.  Responsibilities\n&gt; \n&gt; The InvestorWebService is responsible for returning an\n&gt; investor as a DTO.  It uses a DAO object (this is\n&gt; instantiated using Spring) to retrieve an investor\n&gt; business object.  The DAO uses Hibernate to retreive\n&gt; the requested investor object.\n\nInvestorWebService is a web service-based Repository for Investor \nobjects. Got it.\n\n&gt; Is that enough to start some discussion on your ideas?\n\nYou tell me. :)\n-- \nJ. B.
