I liked Bob Martin&#39;s analogy of double entry\n&gt; bookkeeping, and this may be part of the confusion. As far as I know, it\n&gt; doesn&#39;t matter whether the credit is put into the books first, or the\n&gt; debit is done first. The value of the practice is that both entries have\n&gt; to be done, and both must match. We do some test first, and some test\n&gt; second, but everything gets tested.\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;snip&gt;\n&gt;\n\nThis back and forth approach seems natural, it reduced context switching\n\n&gt; in the design/implement domain, and seems to work well.  What am I\n&gt; missing?\n&gt;\n&gt; Jim\n\n\nIf &quot;testedness&quot; were the only criteria then it wouldn&#39;t matter whether the\ntest or the code were written first. But TDD is not only (not even mostly)\nabout testedness. It is also about design.\n\nA TDD&#39;d design is typically more testable than the code-first design because\nit was written with the test in mind.\n\nKevin\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
